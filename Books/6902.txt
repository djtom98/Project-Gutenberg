To the English reader _On\r\nthe Eve_ is a charmingly drawn picture of a quiet Russian household,\r\nwith a delicate analysis of a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s soul; but to Russians it is\r\nalso a deep and penetrating diagnosis of the destinies of the Russia of\r\nthe fifties.\r\n\r\nElena, the Russian girl, is the central figure of the novel. In\r\ncomparing her with Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s other women, the reader will remark that\r\nhe is allowed to come into closer spiritual contact with her than even\r\nwith Lisa. The successful portraits of women drawn by men in fiction are\r\ngenerally figures for the imagination to play on; however much that is\r\ntold to one about them, the secret springs of their character are left\r\na little obscure, but when Elena stands before us we know all the\r\ninnermost secrets of her character. Her strength of will, her serious,\r\ncourageous, proud soul, her capacity for passion, all the play of her\r\ndelicate idealistic nature troubled by the contradictions, aspirations,\r\nand unhappiness that the dawn of love brings to her, all this is\r\nconveyed to us by the simplest and the most consummate art. The diary\r\n(chapter xvi.) that Elena keeps is in itself a masterly revelation of\r\na young girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart; it has never been equalled by any other novelist.\r\nHow exquisitely Turgenev reveals his characters may be seen by an\r\nexamination of the parts Shubin the artist, and Bersenyev the student,\r\nplay towards Elena. Both young men are in love with her, and the\r\ndescription of their after relations as friends, and the feelings of\r\nElena towards them, and her own self-communings are interwoven with\r\nunfaltering skill. All the most complex and baffling shades of the\r\nmental life, which in the hands of many latter-day novelists build up\r\ncharacters far too thin and too unconvincing, in the hands of Turgenev\r\nare used with deftness and certainty to bring to light that great\r\nkingdom which is always lying hidden beneath the surface, beneath\r\nthe common-place of daily life. In the difficult art of literary\r\nperspective, in the effective grouping of contrasts in character and\r\nthe criss-cross of the influence of the different individuals, lies the\r\nsecret of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s supremacy. As an example the reader may note how he\r\nis made to judge Elena through six pairs of eyes. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s contempt\r\nfor his daughter, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate bewilderment, Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npetulant criticism, Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s half hearted enthralment, Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrecognition, and Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s indifference, being the facets for converging\r\nlight on Elena\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity and depth of soul. Again one may note\r\nTurgenev\xe2\x80\x99s method for rehabilitating Shubin in our eyes; Shubin is\r\nsimply made to criticise Stahov; the thing is done in a few seemingly\r\ncareless lines, but these lines lay bare Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s strength and weakness,\r\nthe fluidity of his nature. The reader who does not see the art which\r\nunderlies almost every line of _On the Eve_ is merely paying the highest\r\ntribute to that art; as often the clear waters of a pool conceal its\r\nsurprising depth. Taking Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s character as an example of creative\r\nskill, we cannot call to mind any instance in the range of European\r\nfiction where the typical artist mind, on its lighter sides, has been\r\nanalysed with such delicacy and truth as here by Turgenev. Hawthorne and\r\nothers have treated it, but the colour seems to fade from their artist\r\ncharacters when a comparison is made between them and Shubin. And yet\r\nTurgenev\xe2\x80\x99s is but a sketch of an artist, compared with, let us say, the\r\nadmirable figure of Roderick Hudson. The irresponsibility, alertness,\r\nthe whimsicality and mobility of Shubin combine to charm and irritate\r\nthe reader in the exact proportion that such a character affects him in\r\nactual life; there is not the least touch of exaggeration, and all the\r\nvalues are kept to a marvel. Looking at the minor characters, perhaps\r\none may say that the husband, Stahov, will be the most suggestive, and\r\nnot the least familiar character, to English households. His essentially\r\nmasculine meanness, his self-complacency, his unconscious indifference\r\nto the opinion of others, his absurdity as \xe2\x80\x98un p\xc3\xa8re de famille\xe2\x80\x99 is\r\nbalanced by the foolish affection and jealousy which his wife, Anna\r\nVassilyevna, cannot help feeling towards him. The perfect balance and\r\nduality of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s outlook is here shown by the equal cleverness with\r\nwhich he seizes on and quietly derides the typical masculine and typical\r\nfeminine attitude in such a married life as the two Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nTurning to the figure of the Bulgarian hero, it is interesting to find\r\nfrom the _Souvenirs sur Tourgu\xc3\xa9nev_ (published in 1887) that Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly distinct failure of importance in character drawing, Insarov, was\r\nnot taken from life, but was the legacy of a friend Karateieff, who\r\nimplored Turgenev to work out an unfinished conception. Insarov is a\r\nfigure of wood. He is so cleverly constructed, and the central idea\r\nbehind him is so strong, that his wooden joints move naturally, and the\r\nspectator has only the instinct, not the certainty, of being cheated.\r\nThe idea he incarnates, that of a man whose soul is aflame with\r\npatriotism, is finely suggested, but an idea, even a great one, does\r\nnot make an individuality. And in fact Insarov is not a man, he is an\r\nautomaton. To compare Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s utterances with his is to perceive that\r\nthere is no spontaneity, no inevitability in Insarov. He is a patriotic\r\nclock wound up to go for the occasion, and in truth he is very useful.\r\nOnly on his deathbed, when the unexpected happens, and the machinery\r\nruns down, do we feel moved. Then, he appears more striking dead than\r\nalive--a rather damning testimony to the power Turgenev credits him\r\nwith. This artistic failure of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s is, as he no doubt recognised,\r\ncuriously lessened by the fact that young girls of Elena\xe2\x80\x99s lofty\r\nidealistic type are particularly impressed by certain stiff types of\r\nmen of action and great will-power, whose capacity for moving straight\r\ntowards a certain goal by no means implies corresponding brain-power.\r\nThe insight of a Shubin and the moral worth of a Bersenyev are not so\r\nvaluable to the Elenas of this world, whose ardent desire to be made\r\ngood use of, and to seek some great end, is best developed by strength\r\nof aim in the men they love.\r\n\r\nAnd now to see what the novel before us means to the Russian mind, we\r\nmust turn to the infinitely suggestive background. Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s genius was\r\nof the same force in politics as in art; it was that of seeing aright.\r\nHe saw his country as it was, with clearer eyes than any man before\r\nor since. If Tolstoi is a purer native expression of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s force,\r\nTurgenev is the personification of Russian aspiration working with the\r\ninstruments of wide cosmopolitan culture. As a critic of his countrymen\r\nnothing escaped Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as a politician he foretold nearly all\r\nthat actually came to pass in his life, and as a consummate artist,\r\nled first and foremost by his love for his art, his novels are undying\r\nhistorical pictures. It is not that there is anything allegorical in\r\nhis novels--allegory is at the furthest pole from his method: it is\r\nthat whenever he created an important figure in fiction, that figure is\r\nnecessarily a revelation of the secrets of the fatherland, the soil, the\r\nrace. Turgenev, in short, was a psychologist not merely of men, but of\r\nnations; and so the chief figure of _On the Eve_, Elena, foreshadows\r\nand stands for the rise of young Russia in the sixties. Elena is young\r\nRussia, and to whom does she turn in her prayer for strength? Not to\r\nBersenyev, the philosopher, the dreamer; not to Shubin, the man carried\r\noutside himself by every passing distraction; but to the strong man,\r\nInsarov. And here the irony of Insarov being made a foreigner, a\r\nBulgarian, is significant of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of his country\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweakness. The hidden meaning of the novel is a cry to the coming men\r\nto unite their strength against the foe without and the foe within the\r\ngates; it is an appeal to them not only to hasten the death of the\r\nold regime of Nicolas I, but an appeal to them to conquer their\r\nsluggishness, their weakness, and their apathy. It is a cry for Men.\r\nTurgenev sought in vain in life for a type of man to satisfy Russia, and\r\nended by taking no living model for his hero, but the hearsay Insarov, a\r\nforeigner. Russia has not yet produced men of this type. But the artist\r\ndoes not despair of the future. Here we come upon one of the most\r\nstriking figures of Turgenev--that of Uvar Ivanovitch. He symbolises the\r\never-predominant type of Russian, the sleepy, slothful Slav of to-day,\r\nyesterday, and to-morrow. He is the Slav whose inherent force Europe is\r\nas ignorant of as he is himself. Though he speaks only twenty sentences\r\nin the book he is a creation of Tolstoian force. His very words are\r\ndark and of practically no significance. There lies the irony of the\r\nportrait. The last words of the novel, the most biting surely that\r\nTurgenev ever wrote, contain the whole essence of _On the Eve_. On the\r\nEve of What? one asks. Time has given contradictory answers to the men\r\nof all parties. The Elenas of to-day need not turn their eyes abroad\r\nto find their counterpart in spirit; so far at least the pessimists are\r\nrefuted: but the note of death that Turgenev strikes in his marvellous\r\nchapter on Venice has still for young Russia an ominous echo--so many\r\ngenerations have arisen eager, only to be flung aside helpless, that one\r\nasks, what of the generation that fronts Autocracy to-day?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember I asked you, \xe2\x80\x9cWill there ever be men among us?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nyou answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be. O primaeval force!\xe2\x80\x9d And now from here in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy poetic distance\xe2\x80\x9d, I will ask you again, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, Uvar\r\nIvanovitch, will there be?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Uvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers, and fixed his enigmatical stare\r\ninto the far distance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis creation of an universal national type, out of the flesh and blood\r\nof a fat taciturn country gentleman, brings us to see that Turgenev\r\nwas not merely an artist, but that he was a poet using fiction as his\r\nmedium. To this end it is instructive to compare Jane Austen, perhaps\r\nthe greatest English exponent of the domestic novel, with the Russian\r\nmaster, and to note that, while as a novelist she emerges favourably\r\nfrom the comparison, she is absolutely wanting in his poetic insight.\r\nHow petty and parochial appears her outlook in _Emma_, compared to the\r\nwide and unflinching gaze of Turgenev. She painted most admirably the\r\nEnglish types she knew, and how well she knew them! but she failed to\r\ncorrelate them with the national life; and yet, while her men and women\r\nwere acting and thinking, Trafalgar and Waterloo were being fought and\r\nwon. But each of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s novels in some subtle way suggests that the\r\npeople he introduces are playing their little part in a great national\r\ndrama everywhere around us, invisible, yet audible through the clamour\r\nof voices near us. And so _On the Eve_, the work of a poet, has certain\r\ndeep notes, which break through the harmonious tenor of the whole, and\r\nstrangely and swiftly transfigure the quiet story, troubling us with a\r\ndawning consciousness of the march of mighty events. Suddenly a strange\r\nsense steals upon the reader that he is living in a perilous atmosphere,\r\nfilling his heart with foreboding, and enveloping at length the\r\ncharacters themselves, all unconsciously awaiting disaster in the\r\nsunny woods and gardens of Kuntsovo. But not till the last chapters are\r\nreached does the English reader perceive that in recreating for him the\r\nmental atmosphere of a single educated Russian household, Turgenev has\r\nbeen casting before his eyes the faint shadow of the national drama\r\nwhich was indeed played, though left unfinished, on the Balkan\r\nbattlefields of 1876-7. Briefly, Turgenev, in sketching the dawn of love\r\nin a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s soul, has managed faintly, but unmistakably, to make\r\nspring and flourish in our minds the ineradicable, though hidden, idea\r\nat the back of Slav thought--the unification of the Slav races. How\r\ndoubly welcome that art should be which can lead us, the foreigners,\r\nthus straight to the heart of the national secrets of a great people,\r\nsecrets which our own critics and diplomatists must necessarily\r\nmisrepresent. Each of Turgenev\xe2\x80\x99s novels may be said to contain\r\na light-bringing rejoinder to the old-fashioned criticism of the\r\nMuscovite, current up to the rise of the Russian novel, and still,\r\nunfortunately, lingering among us; but _On the Eve_, of all the novels,\r\ncontains perhaps the most instructive political lesson England can\r\nlearn. Europe has always had, and most assuredly England has been\r\nover-rich in those alarm-monger critics, watchdogs for ever baying at\r\nSlav cupidity, treachery, intrigue, and so on and so on. It is useful to\r\nhave these well-meaning animals on the political premises, giving noisy\r\ntongue whenever the Slav stretches out his long arm and opens his drowsy\r\neyes, but how rare it is to find a man who can teach us to interpret\r\na nation\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations, to gauge its inner force, its aim, its\r\ninevitability. Turgenev gives us such clues. In the respectful, if\r\nslightly forced, silence that has been imposed by certain recent\r\npolitical events on the tribe of faithful watchdogs, it may be permitted\r\nto one to say, that whatever England\xe2\x80\x99s interest may be in relation to\r\nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s development, it is better for us to understand the force of\r\nRussian aims, before we measure our strength against it. And a novel,\r\nsuch as _On the Eve_, though now nearly forty years old, and to the\r\nshort-sighted out of date, reveals in a flash the attitude of the Slav\r\ntowards his political destiny. His aspirations may have to slumber\r\nthrough policy or necessity; they may be distorted or misrepresented, or\r\nled astray by official action, but we confess that for us, _On the Eve_\r\nsuggests the existence of a mighty lake, whose waters, dammed back for a\r\nwhile, are rising slowly, but are still some way from the brim. How long\r\nwill it take to the overflow? Nobody knows; but when the long winter\r\nof Russia\xe2\x80\x99s dark internal policy shall be broken up, will the snows,\r\nmelting on the mountains, stream south-west, inundating the Valley of\r\nthe Danube? Or, as the national poet, Pushkin, has sung, will there be\r\na pouring of many Slavonian rivulets into the Russian sea, a powerful\r\nattraction of the Slav races towards a common centre to create an era of\r\npeace and development within, whereby Russia may rise free and rejoicing\r\nto face her great destinies? Hard and bitter is the shaping of nations.\r\nUvar Ivanovitch still fixes his enigmatical stare into the far distance.\r\n\r\nEDWARD GARNETT\r\n\r\nJanuary 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAMES OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK\r\n\r\nNIKOL\xc3\x81I [Nicolas] ART\xc3\x89MYEVITCH ST\xc3\x81HOV.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x81NNA VASS\xc3\x8dLYEVNA.\r\n\r\nEL\xc3\x89NA [L\xc3\x89NOTCHKA, H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne] NIKOL\xc3\x81EVNA.\r\n\r\nZ\xc3\x93YA [Zo\xc3\xab] NIK\xc3\x8dTISHNA M\xc3\x9cLLER.\r\n\r\nANDR\xc3\x89I PETR\xc3\x93VITCH BERS\xc3\x89NYEV.\r\n\r\nP\xc3\x81VEL [Paul] Y\xc3\x81KOVLITCH (or Y\xc3\x81KOVITCH) SH\xc3\x9aBIN.\r\n\r\nDM\xc3\x8dTRI NIKAN\xc3\x93ROVITCH (or NIKAN\xc3\x93RITCH) INS\xc3\x81ROV.\r\n\r\nYEG\xc3\x93R ANDR\xc3\x89ITCH KURNAT\xc3\x93VSKY.\r\n\r\nUV\xc3\x81R IV\xc3\x81NOVITCH ST\xc3\x81HOV.\r\n\r\nAUGUST\xc3\x8dNA CHRISTI\xc3\x81NOVNA.\r\n\r\n\xc3\x81NNUSHKA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn transcribing the Russian names into English--\r\n\r\na has the sound of a in father. e,,.............a in pane.\r\ni,,.............ee. u,,............. oo. y is always consonantal except\r\nwhen it is the last letter of the word.\r\ng is always hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one of the hottest days of the summer of 1853, in the shade of a tall\r\nlime-tree on the bank of the river Moskva, not far from Kuntsovo, two\r\nyoung men were lying on the grass. One, who looked about twenty-three,\r\ntall and swarthy, with a sharp and rather crooked nose, a high forehead,\r\nand a restrained smile on his wide mouth, was lying on his back and\r\ngazing meditatively into the distance, his small grey eyes half closed.\r\nThe other was lying on his chest, his curly, fair head propped on his\r\ntwo hands; he, too, was looking away into the distance. He was three\r\nyears older than his companion, but seemed much younger. His moustache\r\nwas only just growing, and his chin was covered with a light curly down.\r\nThere was something childishly pretty, something attractively delicate,\r\nin the small features of his fresh round face, in his soft brown eyes,\r\nlovely pouting lips, and little white hands. Everything about him\r\nwas suggestive of the happy light-heartedness of perfect health and\r\nyouth--the carelessness, conceit, self-indulgence, and charm of youth.\r\nHe used his eyes, and smiled and leaned his head as boys do who know\r\nthat people look at them admiringly. He wore a loose white coat,\r\nmade like a blouse, a blue kerchief wrapped his slender throat, and a\r\nbattered straw hat had been flung on the grass beside him.\r\n\r\nHis companion seemed elderly in comparison with him; and no one would\r\nhave supposed, from his angular figure, that he too was happy and\r\nenjoying himself. He lay in an awkward attitude; his large head--wide\r\nat the crown and narrower at the base--hung awkwardly on his long neck;\r\nawkwardness was expressed in the very pose of his hands, of his body,\r\ntightly clothed in a short black coat, and of his long legs with their\r\nknees raised, like the hind-legs of a grasshopper. For all that, it was\r\nimpossible not to recognise that he was a man of good education; the\r\nwhole of his clumsy person bore the stamp of good-breeding; and his\r\nface, plain and even a little ridiculous as it was, showed a kindly\r\nnature and a thoughtful habit. His name was Andrei Petrovitch Bersenyev;\r\nhis companion, the fair-haired young man, was called Pavel Yakovlitch\r\nShubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you lie on your face, like me?\xe2\x80\x99 began Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s ever\r\nso much nicer so; especially when you kick up your heels and clap them\r\ntogether--like this. You have the grass under your nose; when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsick of staring at the landscape you can watch a fat beetle crawling on\r\na blade of grass, or an ant fussing about. It\xe2\x80\x99s really much nicer.\r\nBut you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken up a pseudo-classical pose, for all the world like a\r\nballet-dancer, when she reclines upon a rock of paste-board. You should\r\nremember you have a perfect right to take a rest now. It\xe2\x80\x99s no joking\r\nmatter to come out third! Take your ease, sir; give up all exertion, and\r\nrest your weary limbs!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin delivered this speech through his nose in a half-lazy,\r\nhalf-joking voice (spoilt children speak so to friends of the house who\r\nbring them sweetmeats), and without waiting for an answer he went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What strikes me most forcibly in the ants and beetles and other worthy\r\ninsects is their astounding seriousness. They run to and fro with such\r\na solemn air, as though their life were something of such importance!\r\nA man the lord of creation, the highest being, stares at them, if you\r\nplease, and they pay no attention to him. Why, a gnat will even settle\r\non the lord of creation\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and make use of him for food. It\xe2\x80\x99s most\r\noffensive. And, on the other hand, how is their life inferior to ours?\r\nAnd why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they take themselves seriously, if we are to be\r\nallowed to take ourselves seriously? There now, philosopher, solve that\r\nproblem for me! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you speak? Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev, starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Your friend lays his deepest thoughts before\r\nyou, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was admiring the view. Look how hot and bright those fields are in\r\nthe sun.\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev spoke with a slight lisp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s some fine colour laid on there,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Nature\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngood hand at it, that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be even more ecstatic over it than I. It\xe2\x80\x99s in your line:\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re an artist.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; it\xe2\x80\x99s not in my line,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Shubin, putting his hat on the back\r\nof his head. \xe2\x80\x98Flesh is my line; my work\xe2\x80\x99s with flesh--modelling flesh,\r\nshoulders, legs, and arms, and here there\xe2\x80\x99s no form, no finish; it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover the place.... Catch it if you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there is beauty here, too,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Bersenyev.--\xe2\x80\x98By the way, have\r\nyou finished your bas-relief?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The boy with the goat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hang it! Hang it! Hang it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin, drawling--\xe2\x80\x98I looked at the\r\ngenuine old things, the antiques, and I smashed my rubbish to pieces.\r\nYou point to nature, and say \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s beauty here, too.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s beauty in everything, even in your nose there\xe2\x80\x99s beauty; but you\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t try after all kinds of beauty. The ancients, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t try after\r\nit; beauty came down of itself upon their creations from somewhere or\r\nother--from heaven, I suppose. The whole world belonged to them; it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot for us to be so large in our reach; our arms are short. We drop our\r\nhook into one little pool, and keep watch over it. If we get a bite, so\r\nmuch the better, if not----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin put out his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bensenyev, \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s a paradox. If you have no sympathy\r\nfor beauty, if you do not love beauty wherever you meet it, it will not\r\ncome to you even in your art. If a beautiful view, if beautiful music\r\ndoes not touch your heart; I mean, if you are not sympathetic----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you are a confirmed sympathetic!\xe2\x80\x99 broke in Shubin, laughing at the\r\nnew title he had coined, while Bersenyev sank into thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin went on, \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a clever person, a\r\nphilosopher, third graduate of the Moscow University; it\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful\r\narguing with you, especially for an ignoramus like me, but I tell you\r\nwhat; besides my art, the only beauty I love is in women... in girls,\r\nand even that\xe2\x80\x99s recently.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned over on to his back and clasped his hands behind his head.\r\n\r\nA few instants passed by in silence. The hush of the noonday heat lay\r\nupon the drowsy, blazing fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speaking of women,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin began again, \xe2\x80\x98how is it no one looks after\r\nStahov? Did you see him in Moscow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s gone clean off his head. He sits for whole days\r\ntogether at his Augustina Christianovna\xe2\x80\x99s, he\xe2\x80\x99s bored to death, but\r\nstill he sits there. They gaze at one another so stupidly.... It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npositively disgusting to see them. Man\xe2\x80\x99s a strange animal. A man with\r\nsuch a home; but no, he must have his Augustina Christianovna! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow anything more repulsive than her face, just like a duck\xe2\x80\x99s! The\r\nother day I modelled a caricature of her in the style of Dantan. It\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t half bad. I will show it you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Elena Nikolaevna\xe2\x80\x99s bust?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Bersenyev, \xe2\x80\x98is it getting on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s not getting on. That face is enough to drive one\r\nto despair. The lines are pure, severe, correct; one would think there\r\nwould be no difficulty in catching a likeness. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as easy as one\r\nwould think though. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a treasure in a fairy-tale--you can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nhold of it. Have you ever noticed how she listens? There\xe2\x80\x99s not a single\r\nfeature different, but the whole expression of the eyes is constantly\r\nchanging, and with that the whole face changes. What is a sculptor--and\r\na poor one too--to do with such a face? She\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful creature--a\r\nstrange creature,\xe2\x80\x99 he added after a brief pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; she is a wonderful girl,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev repeated after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she the daughter of Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov! And after that\r\npeople talk about blood, about stock! The amusing part of it is that\r\nshe really is his daughter, like him, as well as like her mother, Anna\r\nVassilyevna. I respect Anna Vassilyevna from the depths of my heart,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s been awfully good to me; but she\xe2\x80\x99s no better than a hen. Where\r\ndid Elena get that soul of hers? Who kindled that fire in her? There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanother problem for you, philosopher!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut as before, the \xe2\x80\x98philosopher\xe2\x80\x99 made no reply. Bersenyev did not in\r\ngeneral err on the side of talkativeness, and when he did speak,\r\nhe expressed himself awkwardly, with hesitation, and unnecessary\r\ngesticulation. And at this time a kind of special stillness had fallen\r\non his soul, a stillness akin to lassitude and melancholy. He had not\r\nlong come from town after prolonged hard work, which had absorbed him\r\nfor many hours every day. The inactivity, the softness and purity of the\r\nair, the consciousness of having attained his object, the whimsical and\r\ncareless talk of his friend, and the image--so suddenly called up--of\r\none dear to him, all these impressions different--yet at the same time\r\nin a way akin--were mingled in him into a single vague emotion, which at\r\nonce soothed and excited him, and robbed him of his power. He was a very\r\nhighly strung young man.\r\n\r\nIt was cool and peaceful under the lime-tree; the flies and bees seemed\r\nto hum more softly as they flitted within its circle of shade. The fresh\r\nfine grass, of purest emerald green, without a tinge of gold, did not\r\nquiver, the tall flower stalks stood motionless, as though enchanted.\r\nOn the lower twigs of the lime-tree the little bunches of yellow flowers\r\nhung still as death. At every breath a sweet fragrance made its way to\r\nthe very depths of the lungs, and eagerly the lungs inhaled it. Beyond\r\nthe river in the distance, right up to the horizon, all was bright and\r\nglowing. At times a slight breeze passed over, breaking up the landscape\r\nand intensifying the brightness; a sunlit vapour hung over the fields.\r\nNo sound came from the birds; they do not sing in the heat of noonday;\r\nbut the grasshoppers were chirping everywhere, and it was pleasant as\r\nthey sat in the cool and quietness, to hear that hot, eager sound of\r\nlife; it disposed to slumber and inclined the heart to reveries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you noticed,\xe2\x80\x99 began Bersenyev, eking out his words with\r\ngesticulations, \xe2\x80\x98what a strange feeling nature produces in us?\r\nEverything in nature is so complete, so defined, I mean to say, so\r\ncontent with itself, and we understand that and admire it, and at the\r\nsame time, in me at least, it always excites a kind of restlessness, a\r\nkind of uneasiness, even melancholy. What is the meaning of it? Is it\r\nthat in the face of nature we are more vividly conscious of all our\r\nincompleteness, our indefiniteness, or have we little of that content\r\nwith which nature is satisfied, but something else--I mean to say, what\r\nwe need, nature has not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Andrei Petrovitch, what all that\r\ncomes from. You describe the sensations of a solitary man, who is not\r\nliving but only looking on in ecstasy. Why look on? Live, yourself, and\r\nyou will be all right. However much you knock at nature\xe2\x80\x99s door, she will\r\nnever answer you in comprehensible words, because she is dumb. She will\r\nutter a musical sound, or a moan, like a harp string, but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\na song from her. A living heart, now--that will give you your\r\nanswer--especially a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart. So, my dear fellow, I advise you\r\nto get yourself some one to share your heart, and all your distressing\r\nsensations will vanish at once. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we need,\xe2\x80\x9d as you say. This\r\nagitation, and melancholy, all that, you know, is simply a hunger of\r\na kind. Give the stomach some real food, and everything will be right\r\ndirectly. Take your place in the landscape, live in the body, my dear\r\nboy. And after all, what is nature? what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of it? Only hear the\r\nword, love--what an intense, glowing sound it has! Nature--what a cold,\r\npedantic expression. And so\xe2\x80\x99 (Shubin began humming), \xe2\x80\x98my greetings to\r\nMarya Petrovna! or rather,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98not Marya Petrovna, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nthe same! _Voo me compreny_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev got up and stood with his chin leaning on his clasped hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is there to laugh at?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, without looking at his companion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98why should you scoff? Yes, you are right: love is a grand word, a grand\r\nfeeling.... But what sort of love do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin too, got up. \xe2\x80\x98What sort? What you like, so long as it\xe2\x80\x99s there. I\r\nwill confess to you that I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in the existence of different\r\nkinds of love. If you are in love----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With your whole heart,\xe2\x80\x99 put in Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s an understood thing; the heart\xe2\x80\x99s not an apple;\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t divide it. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in love, you\xe2\x80\x99re justified. And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthinking of scoffing. My heart\xe2\x80\x99s as soft at this moment as if it had\r\nbeen melted.... I only wanted to explain why nature has the effect on us\r\nyou spoke of. It\xe2\x80\x99s because she arouses in us a need for love, and is not\r\ncapable of satisfying it. Nature is gently driving us to other living\r\nembraces, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and expect something from nature\r\nherself. Ah, Andrei, Andrei, this sun, this sky is beautiful, everything\r\naround us is beautiful, still you are sad; but if, at this instant, you\r\nwere holding the hand of a woman you loved, if that hand and the whole\r\nwoman were yours, if you were even seeing with her eyes, feeling not\r\nyour own isolated emotion, but her emotion--nature would not make you\r\nmelancholy or restless then, and you would not be observing nature\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeauty; nature herself would be full of joy and praise; she would\r\nbe re-echoing your hymn, because then you would have given her--dumb\r\nnature--speech!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin leaped on to his feet and walked twice up and down, but Bersenyev\r\nbent his head, and his face was overcast by a faint flush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether agree with you,\xe2\x80\x99 he began: \xe2\x80\x98nature does not always\r\nurge us... towards love.\xe2\x80\x99 (He could not at once pronounce the word.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nature threatens us, too; she reminds us of dreadful... yes, insoluble\r\nmysteries. Is she not destined to swallow us up, is she not swallowing\r\nus up unceasingly? She holds life and death as well; and death speaks in\r\nher as loudly as life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In love, too, there is both life and death,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev went on: \xe2\x80\x98when I, for example, stand in the spring\r\nin the forest, in a green glade, when I can fancy the romantic notes of\r\nOberon\xe2\x80\x99s fairy horn\xe2\x80\x99 (Bersenyev was a little ashamed when he had spoken\r\nthese words)--\xe2\x80\x98is that, too----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The thirst for love, the thirst for happiness, nothing more!\xe2\x80\x99 broke\r\nin Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98I, too, know those notes, I know the languor and the\r\nexpectation which come upon the soul in the forest\xe2\x80\x99s shade, in its deep\r\nrecesses, or at evening in the open fields when the sun sets and the\r\nriver mist rises behind the bushes. But forest, and river, and fields,\r\nand sky, every cloud and every blade of grass sets me expecting, hoping\r\nfor happiness, I feel the approach, I hear the voice of happiness\r\ncalling in everything. \xe2\x80\x9cGod of my worship, bright and gay!\xe2\x80\x9d That was how\r\nI tried to begin my sole poem; you must own it\xe2\x80\x99s a splendid first line,\r\nbut I could never produce a second. Happiness! happiness! as long as\r\nlife is not over, as long as we have the use of all our limbs, as long\r\nas we are going up, not down, hill! Damn it all!\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Shubin with\r\nsudden vehemence, \xe2\x80\x98we are young, and neither fools nor monsters; we will\r\nconquer happiness for ourselves!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe shook his curls, and turned a confident almost challenging glance\r\nupwards to the sky. Bersenyev raised his eyes and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there nothing higher than happiness?\xe2\x80\x99 he commented softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what, for instance?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Shubin, stopping short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, for instance, you and I are, as you say, young; we are good men,\r\nlet us suppose; each of us desires happiness for himself.... But is that\r\nword, happiness, one that could unite us, set us both on fire, and make\r\nus clasp each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that word an egoistic one; I mean,\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it a source of disunion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know words, then, that unite men?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and they are not few in number; and you know them, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? What words?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, even Art--since you are an artist--Country, Science, Freedom,\r\nJustice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what of love?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Love, too, is a word that unites; but not the love you are eager for\r\nnow; the love which is not enjoyment, the love which is self-sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for Germans; I want to love for myself; I want to\r\nbe first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be first,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98But it seems to me that to put\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s-self in the second place is the whole significance of our life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If all men were to act as you advise,\xe2\x80\x99 commented Shubin with a\r\nplaintive expression, \xe2\x80\x98none on earth would eat pine-apples; every one\r\nwould be offering them to other people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s as much as to say, pine-apples are not necessary; but you need\r\nnot be alarmed; there will always be plenty of people who like them\r\nenough to take the bread out of other men\xe2\x80\x99s mouths to get them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBoth friends were silent a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I met Insarov again the other day,\xe2\x80\x99 began Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98I invited him to\r\nstay with me; I really must introduce him to you--and to the Stahovs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is Insarov? Ah, to be sure, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it that Servian or Bulgarian you\r\nwere telling me about? The patriot? Now isn\xe2\x80\x99t it he who\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom\r\nof all these philosophical ideas?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he an exceptional individual?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clever? Talented?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clever--talented--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not? Then, what is there remarkable in him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall see. But now I think it\xe2\x80\x99s time to be going. Anna Vassilyevna\r\nwill be waiting for us, very likely. What\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Let us go. How baking it is! This conversation has set\r\nall my blood aflame. There was a moment when you, too, ... I am not an\r\nartist for nothing; I observe everything. Confess, you are interested in\r\na woman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin tried to get a look at Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s face, but he turned away and\r\nwalked out of the lime-tree\xe2\x80\x99s shade. Shubin went after him, moving\r\nhis little feet with easy grace. Bersenyev walked clumsily, with his\r\nshoulders high and his neck craned forward. Yet, he looked a man of\r\nfiner breeding than Shubin; more of a gentleman, one might say, if that\r\nword had not been so vulgarised among us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young men went down to the river Moskva and walked along its bank.\r\nThere was a breath of freshness from the water, and the soft plash of\r\ntiny waves caressed the ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would have another bathe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98only I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of being\r\nlate. Look at the river; it seems to beckon us. The ancient Greeks\r\nwould have beheld a nymph in it. But we are not Greeks, O nymph! we are\r\nthick-skinned Scythians.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have _roussalkas_,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get along with your _roussalkas!_ What\xe2\x80\x99s the use to me--a sculptor--of\r\nthose children of a cold, terror-stricken fancy, those shapes begotten\r\nin the stifling hut, in the dark of winter nights? I want light,\r\nspace.... Good God, when shall I go to Italy? When----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Little Russia, I suppose you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For shame, Andrei Petrovitch, to reproach me for an act of\r\nunpremeditated folly, which I have repented bitterly enough without\r\nthat. Oh, of course, I behaved like a fool; Anna Vassilyevna most kindly\r\ngave me the money for an expedition to Italy, and I went off to the\r\nLittle Russians to eat dumplings and----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me have the rest, please,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet still, I will say, the money was not spent in vain. I saw there\r\nsuch types, especially of women.... Of course, I know; there is no\r\nsalvation to be found outside of Italy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will go to Italy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev, without turning towards him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and will do nothing. You will always be pluming your wings and never\r\ntake flight. We know you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stavasser has taken flight.... And he\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfly, it will prove that I\xe2\x80\x99m a sea penguin, and have no wings. I\r\nam stifled here, I want to be in Italy,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98there is\r\nsunshine, there is beauty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA young girl in a large straw hat, with a pink parasol on her shoulder,\r\ncame into sight at that instant, in the little path along which the\r\nfriends were walking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what do I see? Even here, there is beauty--coming to meet us! A\r\nhumble artist\xe2\x80\x99s compliments to the enchanting Zoya!\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin cried at\r\nonce, with a theatrical flourish of his hat.\r\n\r\nThe young girl to whom this exclamation referred, stopped, threatening\r\nhim with her finger, and, waiting for the two friends to come up to her,\r\nshe said in a ringing voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why is it, gentlemen, you don\xe2\x80\x99t come in to dinner? It is on the table.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do I hear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin, throwing his arms up. \xe2\x80\x98Can it be that\r\nyou, bewitching Zoya, faced such heat to come and look for us? Dare I\r\nthink that is the meaning of your words? Tell me, can it be so? Or no,\r\ndo not utter that word; I shall die of regret on the spot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, do leave off, Pavel Yakovlitch,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the young girl with some\r\nannoyance. \xe2\x80\x98Why will you never talk to me seriously? I shall be angry,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe added with a little coquettish grimace, and she pouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not be angry with me, ideal Zoya Nikitishna; you would not\r\ndrive me to the dark depths of hopeless despair. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you\r\nseriously, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not a serious person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young girl shrugged her shoulders, and turned to Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, he\xe2\x80\x99s always like that; he treats me like a child; and I am\r\neighteen. I am grown-up now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 groaned Shubin, rolling his eyes upwards; and Bersenyev smiled\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nThe girl stamped with her little foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pavel Yakovlitch, I shall be angry! _H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne_ was coming with me,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nwent on, \xe2\x80\x98but she stopped in the garden. The heat frightened her, but I\r\nam not afraid of the heat. Come along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe moved forward along the path, slightly swaying her slender figure at\r\neach step, and with a pretty black-mittened little hand pushing her long\r\nsoft curls back from her face.\r\n\r\nThe friends walked after her (Shubin first pressed his hands, without\r\nspeaking, to his heart, and then flung them higher than his head), and\r\nin a few instants they came out in front of one of the numerous country\r\nvillas with which Kuntsovo is surrounded. A small wooden house with a\r\ngable, painted a pink colour, stood in the middle of the garden, and\r\nseemed to be peeping out innocently from behind the green trees. Zoya\r\nwas the first to open the gate; she ran into the garden, crying: \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nbrought the wanderers!\xe2\x80\x99 A young girl, with a pale and expressive face,\r\nrose from a garden bench near the little path, and in the doorway of\r\nthe house appeared a lady in a lilac silk dress, holding an embroidered\r\ncambric handkerchief over her head to screen it from the sun, and\r\nsmiling with a weary and listless air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna Stahov--her maiden name was Shubin--had been left,\r\nat seven years old, an orphan and heiress of a pretty considerable\r\nproperty. She had very rich and also very poor relations; the poor\r\nrelations were on her father\xe2\x80\x99s, the rich on her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side; the\r\nlatter including the senator Volgin and the Princes Tchikurasov. Prince\r\nArdalion Tchikurasov, who had been appointed her guardian, placed her in\r\nthe best Moscow boarding-school, and when she left school, took her into\r\nhis own home. He kept open house, and gave balls in the winter. Anna\r\nVassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s future husband, Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov, captured\r\nher heart at one of these balls when she was arrayed in a charming\r\nrose-coloured gown, with a wreath of tiny roses. She had treasured\r\nthat wreath all her life. Nikolai Artemyevitch Stahov was the son of\r\na retired captain, who had been wounded in 1812, and had received a\r\nlucrative post in Petersburg. Nikolai Artemyevitch entered the School\r\nof Cadets at sixteen, and left to go into the Guards. He was a handsome,\r\nwell-made fellow, and reckoned almost the most dashing beau at evening\r\nparties of the middling sort, which were those he frequented for the\r\nmost part; he had not gained a footing in the best society. From his\r\nyouth he had been absorbed by two ideals: to get into the Imperial\r\nadjutants, and to make a good marriage; the first ideal he soon\r\ndiscarded, but he clung all the more closely to the second, and it\r\nwas with that object that he went every winter to Moscow. Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch spoke French fairly, and passed for being a philosopher,\r\nbecause he was not a rake. Even while he was no more than an ensign, he\r\nwas given to discussing, persistently, such questions as whether it is\r\npossible for a man to visit the whole of the globe in the course of\r\nhis whole lifetime, whether it is possible for a man to know what is\r\nhappening at the bottom of the sea; and he always maintained the view\r\nthat these things were impossible.\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch was twenty-five years old when he \xe2\x80\x98hooked\xe2\x80\x99 Anna\r\nVassilyevna; he retired from the service and went into the country\r\nto manage the property. He was soon tired of country life, and as the\r\npeasants\xe2\x80\x99 labour was all commuted for rent he could easily leave the\r\nestate; he settled in Moscow in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s house. In his youth he had\r\nplayed no games of any kind, but now he developed a passion for loto,\r\nand, when loto was prohibited, for whist. At home he was bored; he\r\nformed a connection with a widow of German extraction, and spent almost\r\nall his time with her. In the year 1853 he had not moved to Kuntsovo; he\r\nstopped at Moscow, ostensibly to take advantage of the mineral waters;\r\nin reality, he did not want to part from his widow. He did not, however,\r\nhave much conversation with her, but argued more than ever as to whether\r\none can foretell the weather and such questions. Some one had once\r\ncalled him a _frondeur_; he was greatly delighted with that name. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe thought, letting the corners of his mouth drop complacently and\r\nshaking his head, \xe2\x80\x98I am not easily satisfied; you won\xe2\x80\x99t take me in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s _frondeurism_ consisted in saying, for instance,\r\nwhen he heard the word nerves: \xe2\x80\x98And what do you mean by nerves?\xe2\x80\x99 or\r\nif some one alluded in his presence to the discoveries of astronomy,\r\nasking: \xe2\x80\x98And do you believe in astronomy?\xe2\x80\x99 When he wanted to overwhelm\r\nhis opponent completely, he said: \xe2\x80\x98All that is nothing but words.\xe2\x80\x99 It\r\nmust be admitted that to many persons remarks of that kind seemed\r\n(and still seem) irrefutable arguments. But Nikolai Artemyevitch never\r\nsuspected that Augustina Christianovna, in letters to her cousin,\r\nTheodolina Peterzelius, called him _Mein Pinselchen_.\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Anna Vassilyevna, was a thin, little woman\r\nwith delicate features, and a tendency to be emotional and melancholy.\r\nAt school, she had devoted herself to music and reading novels;\r\nafterwards she abandoned all that. She began to be absorbed in\r\ndress, and that, too, she gave up. She did, for a time, undertake her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s education, but she got tired of that too, and handed her\r\nover to a governess. She ended by spending her whole time in sentimental\r\nbrooding and tender melancholy. The birth of Elena Nikolaevna had ruined\r\nher health, and she could never have another child. Nikolai Artemyevitch\r\nused to hint at this fact in justification of his intimacy with\r\nAugustina Christianovna. Her husband\xe2\x80\x99s infidelity wounded Anna\r\nVassilyevna deeply; she had been specially hurt by his once giving\r\nhis German woman, on the sly, a pair of grey horses out of her (Anna\r\nVassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s) own stable. She had never reproached him to his face, but\r\nshe complained of him secretly to every one in the house in turn, even\r\nto her daughter. Anna Vassilyevna did not care for going out, she liked\r\nvisitors to come and sit with her and talk to her; she collapsed at once\r\nwhen she was left alone. She had a very tender and loving heart; life\r\nhad soon crushed her.\r\n\r\nPavel Yakovlitch Shubin happened to be a distant cousin of hers. His\r\nfather had been a government official in Moscow. His brothers had\r\nentered cadets\xe2\x80\x99 corps; he was the youngest, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s darling, and\r\nof delicate constitution; he stopped at home. They intended him for the\r\nuniversity, and strained every effort to keep him at the gymnasium.\r\nFrom his early years he began to show an inclination for sculpture.\r\nThe ponderous senator, Volgin, saw a statuette of his one day at his\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s--he was then sixteen--and declared that he intended to protect\r\nthis youthful genius. The sudden death of Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s father very nearly\r\neffected a complete transformation in the young man\xe2\x80\x99s future. The\r\nsenator, the patron of genius, made him a present of a bust of Homer\r\nin plaster, and did nothing more. But Anna Vassilyevna helped him with\r\nmoney, and at nineteen he scraped through into the university in the\r\nfaculty of medicine. Pavel felt no inclination for medical science, but,\r\nas the university was then constituted, it was impossible for him to\r\nenter in any other faculty. Besides, he looked forward to studying\r\nanatomy. But he did not complete his anatomical studies; at the end of\r\nthe first year, and before the examination, he left the university to\r\ndevote himself exclusively to his vocation. He worked zealously, but\r\nby fits and starts; he used to stroll about the country round Moscow\r\nsketching and modelling portraits of peasant girls, and striking up\r\nacquaintance with all sorts of people, young and old, of high and low\r\ndegree, Italian models and Russian artists. He would not hear of\r\nthe Academy, and recognised no one as a teacher. He was possessed of\r\nunmistakeable talent; it began to be talked about in Moscow. His mother,\r\nwho came of a good Parisian family, a kind-hearted and clever woman, had\r\ntaught him French thoroughly and had toiled and thought for him day and\r\nnight. She was proud of him, and when, while still young in years, she\r\ndied of consumption, she entreated Anna Vassilyevna to take him under\r\nher care. He was at that time twenty-one. Anna Vassilyevna carried out\r\nher last wish; a small room in the lodge of the country villa was given\r\nup to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to dinner, come along,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lady of the house in a plaintive\r\nvoice, and they all went into the dining-room. \xe2\x80\x98Sit beside me, _Zo\xc3\xa9_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadded Anna Vassilyevna, \xe2\x80\x98and you, _H\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8ne_, take our guest; and you,\r\n_Paul_, please don\xe2\x80\x99t be naughty and tease _Zo\xc3\xa9_. My head aches to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin again turned his eyes up to the ceiling; Zo\xc3\xa9 responded with\r\na half-smile. This Zo\xc3\xa9, or, to speak more precisely, Zoya Nikitishna\r\nMueller, was a pretty, fair-haired, half-Russian German girl, with a\r\nlittle nose rather wide at the end, and tiny red lips. She sang Russian\r\nballads fairly well and could play various pieces, both lively and\r\nsentimental, very correctly on the piano. She dressed with taste, but in\r\na rather childish style, and even over-precisely. Anna Vassilyevna\r\nhad taken her as a companion for her daughter, and she kept her\r\nalmost constantly at her side. Elena did not complain of that; she was\r\nabsolutely at a loss what to say to Zoya when she happened to be left\r\nalone with her.\r\n\r\nThe dinner lasted rather a long time; Bersenyev talked with Elena about\r\nuniversity life, and his own plans and hopes; Shubin listened without\r\nspeaking, ate with an exaggerated show of greediness, and now and then\r\nthrew comic glances of despair at Zoya, who responded always with the\r\nsame phlegmatic smile. After dinner, Elena with Bersenyev and Shubin\r\nwent into the garden; Zoya looked after them, and, with a slight shrug\r\nof her shoulders, sat down to the piano. Anna Vassilyevna began: \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you go for a walk, too?\xe2\x80\x99 but, without waiting for a reply, she\r\nadded: \xe2\x80\x98Play me something melancholy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_La derni\xc3\xa8re pens\xc3\xa9e de Weber_?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Zoya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, yes, Weber,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Anna Vassilyevna. She sank into an easy chair,\r\nand the tears started on to her eyelashes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Elena led the two friends to an arbour of acacias, with a\r\nlittle wooden table in the middle, and seats round. Shubin looked round,\r\nand, whispering \xe2\x80\x98Wait a minute!\xe2\x80\x99 he ran off, skipping and hopping to his\r\nown room, brought back a piece of clay, and began modelling a bust of\r\nZoya, shaking his head and muttering and laughing to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At his old tricks again,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Elena, glancing at his work. She\r\nturned to Bersenyev, with whom she was continuing the conversation begun\r\nat dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My old tricks!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a subject that\xe2\x80\x99s simply\r\ninexhaustible! To-day, particularly, she drove me out of all patience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why so?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Elena. \xe2\x80\x98One would think you were speaking of some\r\nspiteful, disagreeable old woman. She is a pretty young girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin broke in, \xe2\x80\x98she is pretty, very pretty; I am sure\r\nthat no one who meets her could fail to think: that\xe2\x80\x99s some one I should\r\nlike to--dance a polka with; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, too, that she knows that, and\r\nis pleased.... Else, what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of those modest simpers, that\r\ndiscreet air? There, you know what I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered between his\r\nteeth. \xe2\x80\x98But now you\xe2\x80\x99re absorbed in something else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd breaking up the bust of Zoya, Shubin set hastily to modelling and\r\nkneading the clay again with an air of vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is your wish to be a professor?\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena to Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, squeezing his red hands between his knees. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy cherished dream. Of course I know very well how far I fall short\r\nof being--to be worthy of such a high--I mean that I am too little\r\nprepared, but I hope to get permission for a course of travel abroad; I\r\nshall pass three or four years in that way, if necessary, and then----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped, dropped his eyes, then quickly raising them again, he gave\r\nan embarrassed smile and smoothed his hair. When Bersenyev was talking\r\nto a woman, his words came out more slowly, and he lisped more than\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want to be a professor of history?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, or of philosophy,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, in a lower voice--\xe2\x80\x98if that is\r\npossible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect devil at philosophy already,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Shubin, making\r\ndeep lines in the clay with his nail. \xe2\x80\x98What does he want to go abroad\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And will you be perfectly contented with such a position?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Elena,\r\nleaning on her elbow and looking him straight in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly, Elena Nikolaevna, perfectly. What could be a finer vocation?\r\nTo follow, perhaps, in the steps of Timofay Nikolaevitch ... The very\r\nthought of such work fills me with delight and confusion ... yes,\r\nconfusion... which comes from a sense of my own deficiency. My dear\r\nfather consecrated me to this work... I shall never forget his last\r\nwords.\xe2\x80\x99...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your father died last winter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Elena Nikolaevna, in February.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They say,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena went on, \xe2\x80\x98that he left a remarkable work in\r\nmanuscript; is it true?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He was a wonderful man. You would have loved him, Elena\r\nNikolaevna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I should. And what was the subject of the work?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To give you an idea of the subject of the work in few words, Elena\r\nNikolaevna, would be somewhat difficult. My father was a learned man, a\r\nSchellingist; he used terms which were not always very clear----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Elena, \xe2\x80\x98excuse my ignorance, what does\r\nthat mean, a Schellingist?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev smiled slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A Schellingist means a follower of Schelling, a German philosopher; and\r\nwhat the philosophy of Schelling consists in----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Surely\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to give Elena Nikolaevna a lecture on Schelling? Have\r\npity on her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a lecture at all,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Bersenyev, turning crimson. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nmeant----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why not a lecture?\xe2\x80\x99 put in Elena. \xe2\x80\x98You and I are in need of\r\nlectures, Pavel Yakovlitch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin stared at her, and suddenly burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x99 she said coldly, and almost sharply.\r\n\r\nShubin did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after a short pause. \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry. But\r\nreally it\xe2\x80\x99s a strange taste, upon my word, to discuss philosophy in\r\nweather like this under these trees. Let us rather talk of nightingales\r\nand roses, youthful eyes and smiles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and of French novels, and of feminine frills and fal-lals,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fal-lals, too, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98if they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course. But suppose we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk of frills? You are always\r\nboasting of being a free artist; why do you encroach on the freedom of\r\nothers? And allow me to inquire, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your bent of mind, why do you\r\nattack Zoya? With her it would be peculiarly suitable to talk of frills\r\nand roses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin suddenly fired up, and rose from the garden seat. \xe2\x80\x98So that\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe began in a nervous voice. \xe2\x80\x98I understand your hint; you want to send\r\nme away to her, Elena Nikolaevna. In other words, I\xe2\x80\x99m not wanted here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never thought of sending you away from here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin continued passionately, \xe2\x80\x98that I am not\r\nworthy of other society, that I am her equal; that I am as vain, and\r\nsilly and petty as that mawkish German girl? Is that it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena frowned. \xe2\x80\x98You did not always speak like that of her, Pavel\r\nYakovlitch,\xe2\x80\x99 she remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! reproaches! reproaches now!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Well, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny there was a moment--one moment precisely, when those fresh, vulgar\r\ncheeks of hers... But if I wanted to repay you with reproaches and\r\nremind you... Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 he added suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98I feel I shall say\r\nsomething silly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd with a blow on the clay moulded into the shape of a head, he ran out\r\nof the arbour and went off to his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a baby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, looking after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s an artist,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev with a quiet smile. \xe2\x80\x98All artists\r\nare like that. One must forgive them their caprices. That is their\r\nprivilege.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Elena; \xe2\x80\x98but Pavel has not so far justified his claim to\r\nthat privilege in any way. What has he done so far? Give me your arm,\r\nand let us go along the avenue. He was in our way. We were talking of\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s works.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev took Elena\xe2\x80\x99s arm in his, and walked beside her through the\r\ngarden; but the conversation prematurely broken off was not renewed.\r\nBersenyev began again unfolding his views on the vocation of a\r\nprofessor, and on his own future career. He walked slowly beside Elena,\r\nmoving awkwardly, awkwardly holding her arm, sometimes jostling his\r\nshoulder against her, and not once looking at her; but his talk\r\nflowed more easily, even if not perfectly freely; he spoke simply and\r\ngenuinely, and his eyes, as they strayed slowly over the trunks of the\r\ntrees, the sand of the path and the grass, were bright with the quiet\r\nardour of generous emotions, while in his soothed voice there was heard\r\nthe delight of a man who feels that he is succeeding in expressing\r\nhimself to one very dear to him. Elena listened to him very attentively,\r\nand turning half towards him, did not take her eyes off his face,\r\nwhich had grown a little paler--off his eyes, which were soft and\r\naffectionate, though they avoided meeting her eyes. Her soul expanded;\r\nand something tender, holy, and good seemed half sinking into her heart,\r\nhalf springing up within it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nShubin did not leave his room before night. It was already quite dark;\r\nthe moon--not yet at the full--stood high in the sky, the milky way\r\nshone white, and the stars spotted the heavens, when Bersenyev, after\r\ntaking leave of Anna Vassilyevna, Elena, and Zoya, went up to his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s door. He found it locked. He knocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99 sounded Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me in, Pavel; don\xe2\x80\x99t be sulky; aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed of yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not sulky; I\xe2\x80\x99m asleep and dreaming about Zoya.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do stop that, please; you\xe2\x80\x99re not a baby. Let me in. I want to talk to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you had talk enough with Elena?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, come; let me in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin responded by a pretended snore.\r\n\r\nBersenyev shrugged his shoulders and turned homewards.\r\n\r\nThe night was warm and seemed strangely still, as though everything were\r\nlistening and expectant; and Bersenyev, enfolded in the still darkness,\r\nstopped involuntarily; and he, too, listened expectant. On the tree-tops\r\nnear there was a faint stir, like the rustle of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress, awaking\r\nin him a feeling half-sweet, half-painful, a feeling almost of fright.\r\nHe felt a tingling in his cheeks, his eyes were chill with momentary\r\ntears; he would have liked to move quite noiselessly, to steal along in\r\nsecret. A cross gust of wind blew suddenly on him; he almost shuddered,\r\nand his heart stood still; a drowsy beetle fell off a twig and dropped\r\nwith a thud on the path; Bersenyev uttered a subdued \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nagain stopped. But he began to think of Elena, and all these passing\r\nsensations vanished at once; there remained only the reviving sense of\r\nthe night freshness, of the walk by night; his whole soul was absorbed\r\nby the image of the young girl. Bersenyev walked with bent head,\r\nrecalling her words, her questions. He fancied he heard the tramp of\r\nquick steps behind. He listened: some one was running, some one was\r\novertaking him; he heard panting, and suddenly from a black circle of\r\nshadow cast by a huge tree Shubin sprang out before him, quite pale in\r\nthe light of the moon, with no cap on his disordered curls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you came along this path,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with an effort. \xe2\x80\x98I should\r\nnot have slept all night, if I had not overtaken you. Give me your hand.\r\nAre you going home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will see you home then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But why have you come without a cap on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I took off my neckerchief too. It is quite warm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe friends walked a few paces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was very stupid to-day, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To speak frankly, you were. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make you out. I have never\r\nseen you like that before. And what were you angry about really? Such\r\ntrifles!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s how you put it; but they were not\r\ntrifles to me. You see,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98I ought to point out to you that\r\nI--that--you may think what you please of me--I--well there! I\xe2\x80\x99m in love\r\nwith Elena.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You in love with Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bersenyev, standing still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Shubin with affected carelessness. \xe2\x80\x98Does that astonish\r\nyou? I will tell you something else. Till this evening I still had\r\nhopes that she might come to love me in time. But to-day I have seen\r\nfor certain that there is no hope for me. She is in love with some one\r\nelse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some one else? Whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom? You!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin, slapping Bersenyev on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Shubin.\r\n\r\nBersenyev stepped back a pace, and stood motionless. Shubin looked\r\nintently at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And does that astonish you? You are a modest youth. But she loves you.\r\nYou can make your mind easy on that score.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What nonsense you talk!\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev protested at last with an air of\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not nonsense. But why are we standing still? Let us go on.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s easier to talk as we walk. I have known her a long while, and I\r\nknow her well. I cannot be mistaken. You are a man after her own heart.\r\nThere was a time when she found me agreeable; but, in the first place,\r\nI am too frivolous a young man for her, while you are a serious person,\r\nyou are a morally and physically well-regulated person, you--hush, I\r\nhave not finished, you are a conscientiously disposed enthusiast,\r\na genuine type of those devotees of science, of whom--no not of\r\nwhom--whereof the middle class of Russian gentry are so justly proud!\r\nAnd, secondly, Elena caught me the other day kissing Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s arms!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s. What would you have? She has such fine shoulders.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shoulders?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well there, shoulders and arms, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all the same? Elena caught me\r\nin this unconstrained proceeding after dinner, and before dinner I had\r\nbeen abusing Zoya in her hearing. Elena unfortunately doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nhow natural such contradictions are. Then you came on the scene, you\r\nhave faith in--what the deuce is it you have faith in?... You blush and\r\nlook confused, you discuss Schiller and Schelling (she\xe2\x80\x99s always on the\r\nlook-out for remarkable men), and so you have won the day, and I, poor\r\nwretch, try to joke--and all the while----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin suddenly burst into tears, turned away, and dropping upon the\r\nground clutched at his hair.\r\n\r\nBersenyev went up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pavel,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98what childishness this is! Really! what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter\r\nwith you to-day? God knows what nonsense you have got into your head,\r\nand you are crying. Upon my word, I believe you must be putting it on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin lifted up his head. The tears shone bright on his cheeks in the\r\nmoonlight, but there was a smile on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98you may think what you please about me.\r\nI am even ready to agree with you that I\xe2\x80\x99m hysterical now, but, by God,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in love with Elena, and Elena loves you. I promised, though, to see\r\nyou home, and I will keep my promise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a night! silvery, dark, youthful! How sweet it must be to-night\r\nfor men who are loved! How sweet for them not to sleep! Will you sleep,\r\nAndrei Petrovitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev made no answer, and quickened his pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are you hurrying to?\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin went on. \xe2\x80\x98Trust my words, a night\r\nlike this will never come again in your life, and at home, Schelling\r\nwill keep. It\xe2\x80\x99s true he did you good service to-day; but you need not\r\nhurry for all that. Sing, if you can sing, sing louder than ever; if\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t sing, take off your hat, throw up your head, and smile to the\r\nstars. They are all looking at you, at you alone; the stars never do\r\nanything but look down upon lovers--that\xe2\x80\x99s why they are so charming. You\r\nare in love, I suppose, Andrei Petrovitch?... You don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me... why\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you answer?\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin began again: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if you feel happy, be quiet,\r\nbe quiet! I chatter because I am a poor devil, unloved, I am a jester,\r\nan artist, a buffoon; but what unutterable ecstasy would I quaff in the\r\nnight wind under the stars, if I knew that I were loved!... Bersenyev,\r\nare you happy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev was silent as before, and walked quickly along the smooth\r\npath. In front, between the trees, glimmered the lights of the little\r\nvillage in which he was staying; it consisted of about a dozen small\r\nvillas for summer visitors. At the very beginning of the village, to the\r\nright of the road, a little shop stood under two spreading birch-trees;\r\nits windows were all closed already, but a wide patch of light fell\r\nfan-shaped from the open door upon the trodden grass, and was cast\r\nupwards on the trees, showing up sharply the whitish undersides of\r\nthe thick growing leaves. A girl, who looked like a maid-servant, was\r\nstanding in the shop with her back against the doorpost, bargaining\r\nwith the shopkeeper; from beneath the red kerchief which she had wrapped\r\nround her head, and held with bare hand under her chin, could just be\r\nseen her round cheek and slender throat. The young men stepped into the\r\npatch of light; Shubin looked into the shop, stopped short, and cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Annushka!\xe2\x80\x99 The girl turned round quickly. They saw a nice-looking,\r\nrather broad but fresh face, with merry brown eyes and black eyebrows.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Annushka!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Shubin. The girl saw him, looked scared and\r\nshamefaced, and without finishing her purchases, she hurried down the\r\nsteps, slipped quickly past, and, hardly looking round, went along the\r\nroad to the left. The shopkeeper, a puffy man, unmoved by anything in\r\nthe world, like all country shopkeepers gasped and gaped after her,\r\nwhile Shubin turned to Bersenyev with the words: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s... you see...\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a family here I know... so at their house... you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine\xe2\x80\x99 ... and, without finishing his speech, he ran after the\r\nretreating girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99d better at least wipe your tears away,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev shouted after\r\nhim, and he could not refrain from laughing. But when he got home, his\r\nface had not a mirthful expression; he laughed no longer. He had not for\r\na single instant believed what Shubin had told him, but the words he had\r\nuttered had sunk deep into his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pavel was making a fool of me,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought; \xe2\x80\x98... but she will love one\r\nday... whom will she love?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s room there was a piano, small, and by no means new, but\r\nof a soft and sweet tone, though not perfectly in tune. Bersenyev sat\r\ndown to it, and began to strike some chords. Like all Russians of\r\ngood birth, he had studied music in his childhood, and like almost\r\nall Russian gentlemen, he played very badly; but he loved music\r\npassionately. Strictly speaking, he did not love the art, the forms in\r\nwhich music is expressed (symphonies and sonatas, even operas wearied\r\nhim), but he loved the poetry of music: he loved those vague and sweet,\r\nshapeless, and all-embracing emotions which are stirred in the soul by\r\nthe combinations and successions of sounds. For more than an hour,\r\nhe did not move from the piano, repeating many times the same chords,\r\nawkwardly picking out new ones, pausing and melting over the minor\r\nsevenths. His heart ached, and his eyes more than once filled with\r\ntears. He was not ashamed of them; he let them flow in the darkness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pavel was right,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, \xe2\x80\x98I feel it; this evening will not come\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99 At last he got up, lighted a candle, put on his dressing-gown,\r\ntook down from the bookshelf the second volume of Raumer\xe2\x80\x99s _History of\r\nthe Hohenstaufen_, and sighing twice, he set to work diligently to read\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Elena had gone to her room, and sat down at the open window,\r\nher head resting on her hands. To spend about a quarter of an hour every\r\nevening at her bedroom window had become a habit with her. At this time\r\nshe held converse with herself, and passed in review the preceding day.\r\nShe had not long reached her twentieth year. She was tall, and had a\r\npale and dark face, large grey eyes under arching brows, covered with\r\ntiny freckles, a perfectly regular forehead and nose, tightly compressed\r\nlips, and a rather sharp chin. Her hair, of a chestnut shade, fell low\r\non her slender neck. In her whole personality, in the expression of her\r\nface, intent and a little timorous, in her clear but changing glance, in\r\nher smile, which was, as it were, intense, in her soft and uneven voice,\r\nthere was something nervous, electric, something impulsive and hurried,\r\nsomething, in fact, which could never be attractive to every one, which\r\neven repelled some.\r\n\r\nHer hands were slender and rosy, with long fingers; her feet were\r\nslender; she walked swiftly, almost impetuously, her figure bent a\r\nlittle forward. She had grown up very strangely; first she idolised\r\nher father, then she became passionately devoted to her mother, and had\r\ngrown cold to both of them, especially to her father. Of late years she\r\nhad behaved to her mother as to a sick grandmother; while her father,\r\nwho had been proud of her while she had been regarded as an exceptional\r\nchild, had come to be afraid of her when she was grown up, and said of\r\nher that she was a sort of enthusiastic republican--no one could say\r\nwhere she got it from. Weakness revolted her, stupidity made her angry,\r\nand deceit she could never, never pardon. She was exacting beyond\r\nall bounds, even her prayers had more than once been mingled with\r\nreproaches. When once a person had lost her respect--and she passed\r\njudgment quickly, often too quickly--he ceased to exist for her. All\r\nimpressions cut deeply into her heart; life was bitter earnest for her.\r\n\r\nThe governess to whom Anna Vassilyevna had entrusted the finishing of\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s education--an education, we may remark in parenthesis,\r\nwhich had not even been begun by the languid lady--was a Russian, the\r\ndaughter of a ruined official, educated at a government boarding school,\r\na very emotional, soft-hearted, and deceitful creature; she was for\r\never falling in love, and ended in her fiftieth year (when Elena was\r\nseventeen) by marrying an officer of some sort, who deserted her without\r\nloss of time. This governess was very fond of literature, and wrote\r\nverses herself; she inspired Elena with a love of reading, but reading\r\nalone did not satisfy the girl; from childhood she thirsted for action,\r\nfor active well-doing--the poor, the hungry, and the sick absorbed her\r\nthoughts, tormented her, and made her heart heavy; she used to dream\r\nof them, and to ply all her friends with questions about them; she gave\r\nalms carefully, with unconscious solemnity, almost with a thrill of\r\nemotion. All ill-used creatures, starved dogs, cats condemned to death,\r\nsparrows fallen out of the nest, even insects and reptiles found a\r\nchampion and protector in Elena; she fed them herself, and felt no\r\nrepugnance for them. Her mother did not interfere with her; but her\r\nfather used to be very indignant with his daughter, for her--as he\r\ncalled it--vulgar soft-heartedness, and declared there was not room to\r\nmove for the cats and dogs in the house. \xe2\x80\x98Lenotchka,\xe2\x80\x99 he would shout to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98come quickly, here\xe2\x80\x99s a spider eating a fly; come and save the poor\r\nwretch!\xe2\x80\x99 And Lenotchka, all excitement, would run up, set the fly free,\r\nand disentangle its legs. \xe2\x80\x98Well, now let it bite you a little, since you\r\nare so kind,\xe2\x80\x99 her father would say ironically; but she did not hear him.\r\nAt ten years old Elena made friends with a little beggar-girl, Katya,\r\nand used to go secretly to meet her in the garden, took her nice things\r\nto eat, and presented her with handkerchiefs and pennies; playthings\r\nKatya would not take. She would sit beside her on the dry earth among\r\nthe bushes behind a thick growth of nettles; with a feeling of delicious\r\nhumility she ate her stale bread and listened to her stories. Katya had\r\nan aunt, an ill-natured old woman, who often beat her; Katya hated her,\r\nand was always talking of how she would run away from her aunt and live\r\nin \xe2\x80\x98_God\xe2\x80\x99s full freedom_\xe2\x80\x99; with secret respect and awe Elena drank in\r\nthese new unknown words, stared intently at Katya and everything about\r\nher--her quick black, almost animal eyes, her sun-burnt hands, her\r\nhoarse voice, even her ragged clothes--seemed to Elena at such times\r\nsomething particular and distinguished, almost holy. Elena went back\r\nhome, and for long after dreamed of beggars and God\xe2\x80\x99s freedom; she would\r\ndream over plans of how she would cut herself a hazel stick, and put on\r\na wallet and run away with Katya; how she would wander about the roads\r\nin a wreath of corn-flowers; she had seen Katya one day in just such a\r\nwreath. If, at such times, any one of her family came into the room, she\r\nwould shun them and look shy. One day she ran out in the rain to meet\r\nKatya, and made her frock muddy; her father saw her, and called her a\r\nslut and a peasant-wench. She grew hot all over, and there was something\r\nof terror and rapture in her heart. Katya often sang some half-brutal\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s song. Elena learnt this song from her.... Anna Vassilyevna\r\noverheard her singing it, and was very indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where did you pick up such horrors?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked her daughter.\r\n\r\nElena only looked at her mother, and would not say a word; she felt that\r\nshe would let them tear her to pieces sooner than betray her secret, and\r\nagain there was a terror and sweetness in her heart. Her friendship with\r\nKatya, however, did not last long; the poor little girl fell sick of\r\nfever, and in a few days she was dead.\r\n\r\nElena was greatly distressed, and spent sleepless nights for long after\r\nshe heard of Katya\xe2\x80\x99s death. The last words of the little beggar-girl\r\nwere constantly ringing in her ears, and she fancied that she was being\r\ncalled....\r\n\r\nThe years passed and passed; swiftly and noiselessly, like waters\r\nrunning under the snow, Elena\xe2\x80\x99s youth glided by, outwardly uneventful,\r\ninwardly in conflict and emotion. She had no friend; she did not get\r\non with any one of all the girls who visited the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99 house. Her\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x99 authority had never weighed heavily on Elena, and from her\r\nsixteenth year she became absolutely independent; she began to live a\r\nlife of her own, but it was a life of solitude. Her soul glowed, and the\r\nfire died away again in solitude; she struggled like a bird in a cage,\r\nand cage there was none; no one oppressed her, no one restrained her,\r\nwhile she was torn, and fretted within. Sometimes she did not understand\r\nherself, was even frightened of herself. Everything that surrounded her\r\nseemed to her half-senseless, half-incomprehensible. \xe2\x80\x98How live without\r\nlove? and there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to love!\xe2\x80\x99 she thought; and she felt terror\r\nagain at these thoughts, these sensations. At eighteen, she nearly\r\ndied of malignant fever; her whole constitution--naturally healthy\r\nand vigorous--was seriously affected, and it was long before it could\r\nperfectly recover; the last traces of the illness disappeared at last,\r\nbut Elena Nikolaevna\xe2\x80\x99s father was never tired of talking with some\r\nspitefulness of her \xe2\x80\x98nerves.\xe2\x80\x99 Sometimes she fancied that she wanted\r\nsomething which no one wanted, of which no one in all Russia dreamed.\r\nThen she would grow calmer, and even laugh at herself, and pass day\r\nafter day unconcernedly; but suddenly some over-mastering, nameless\r\nforce would surge up within her, and seem to clamour for an outlet. The\r\nstorm passed over, and the wings of her soul drooped without flight; but\r\nthese tempests of feeling cost her much. However she might strive not\r\nto betray what was passing within her, the suffering of the tormented\r\nspirit was expressed in her even external tranquillity, and her parents\r\nwere often justified in shrugging their shoulders in astonishment, and\r\nfailing to understand her \xe2\x80\x98queer ways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the day with which our story began, Elena did not leave the window\r\ntill later than usual. She thought much of Bersenyev, and of her\r\nconversation with him. She liked him; she believed in the warmth of his\r\nfeelings, and the purity of his aims. He had never before talked to her\r\nas on that evening. She recalled the expression of his timid eyes, his\r\nsmiles--and she smiled herself and fell to musing, but not of him. She\r\nbegan to look out into the night from the open window. For a long time\r\nshe gazed at the dark, low-hanging sky; then she got up, flung back her\r\nhair from her face with a shake of her head, and, herself not knowing\r\nwhy, she stretched out to it--to that sky--her bare chilled arms; then\r\nshe dropped them, fell on her knees beside her bed, pressed her face\r\ninto the pillow, and, in spite of all her efforts not to yield to the\r\npassion overwhelming her, she burst into strange, uncomprehending,\r\nburning tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Bersenyev set off in a return coach\r\nto Moscow. He had to get some money from the post-office, to buy some\r\nbooks, and he wanted to seize the opportunity to see Insarov and have\r\nsome conversation with him. The idea had occurred to Bersenyev, in the\r\ncourse of his last conversation with Shubin, to invite Insarov to stay\r\nwith him at his country lodgings. But it was some time before he found\r\nhim out; from his former lodging he had moved to another, which it was\r\nnot easy to discover; it was in the court at the back of a squalid stone\r\nhouse, built in the Petersburg style, between Arbaty Road and Povarsky\r\nStreet. In vain Bersenyev wandered from one dirty staircase to another,\r\nin vain he called first to a doorkeeper, then to a passer-by. Porters\r\neven in Petersburg try to avoid the eyes of visitors, and in Moscow much\r\nmore so; no one answered Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s call; only an inquisitive tailor,\r\nin his shirt sleeves, with a skein of grey thread on his shoulder,\r\nthrust out from a high casement window a dirty, dull, unshorn face, with\r\na blackened eye; and a black and hornless goat, clambering up on to a\r\ndung heap, turned round, bleated plaintively, and went on chewing the\r\ncud faster than before. A woman in an old cloak, and shoes trodden\r\ndown at heel, took pity at last on Bersenyev and pointed out Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodging to him. Bersenyev found him at home. He had taken a room with\r\nthe very tailor who had stared down so indifferently at the perplexity\r\nof a wandering stranger; a large, almost empty room, with dark green\r\nwalls, three square windows, a tiny bedstead in one corner, a little\r\nleather sofa in another, and a huge cage hung up to the very ceiling;\r\nin this cage there had once lived a nightingale. Insarov came to meet\r\nBersenyev directly he crossed the threshold, but he did not exclaim,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, it\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens, what happy chance has brought you?\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\ndid not even say, \xe2\x80\x98How do you do?\xe2\x80\x99 but simply pressed his hand and led\r\nhim up to the solitary chair in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and he seated himself on the edge of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am, as you see, still in disorder,\xe2\x80\x99 added Insarov, pointing to a pile\r\nof papers and books on the floor, \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got settled in as I ought.\r\nI have not had time yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov spoke Russian perfectly correctly, pronouncing every word fully\r\nand purely; but his guttural though pleasant voice sounded somehow not\r\nRussian. Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s foreign extraction (he was a Bulgarian by birth)\r\nwas still more clearly marked in his appearance; he was a young man\r\nof five-and-twenty, spare and sinewy, with a hollow chest and knotted\r\nfingers; he had sharp features, a hooked nose, blue-black hair, a low\r\nforehead, small, intent-looking, deep-set eyes, and bushy eyebrows; when\r\nhe smiled, splendid white teeth gleamed for an instant between his thin,\r\nhard, over-defined lips. He was in a rather old but tidy coat, buttoned\r\nup to the throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did you leave your old lodging?\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is cheaper, and nearer to the university.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now it\xe2\x80\x99s vacation.... And what could induce you to stay in the\r\ntown in summer! You should have taken a country cottage if you were\r\ndetermined to move.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov made no reply to this remark, and offered Bersenyev a pipe,\r\nadding: \xe2\x80\x98Excuse me, I have no cigarettes or cigars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev began smoking the pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here have I,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98taken a little house near Kuntsovo, very\r\ncheap and very roomy. In fact there is a room to spare upstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov again made no answer.\r\n\r\nBersenyev drew at the pipe: \xe2\x80\x98I have even been thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 he began\r\nagain, blowing out the smoke in a thin cloud, \xe2\x80\x98that if any one could\r\nbe found--you, for instance, I thought of--who would care, who would\r\nconsent to establish himself there upstairs, how nice it would be! What\r\ndo you think, Dmitri Nikanorovitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov turned his little eyes on him. \xe2\x80\x98You propose my staying in your\r\ncountry house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I have a room to spare there upstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks very much, Andrei Petrovitch; but I expect my means would not\r\nallow of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My means would not allow of my living in a country house. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpossible for me to keep two lodgings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But of course I\xe2\x80\x99--Bersenyev was beginning, but he stopped short. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nwould have no extra expense in that way,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on. \xe2\x80\x98Your lodging here\r\nwould remain for you, let us suppose; but then everything there is very\r\ncheap; we could even arrange so as to dine, for instance, together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov said nothing. Bersenyev began to feel awkward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You might at least pay me a visit sometime,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, after a short\r\npause. \xe2\x80\x98A few steps from me there\xe2\x80\x99s a family living with whom I want\r\nvery much to make you acquainted. If only you knew, Insarov, what a\r\nmarvellous girl there is there! There is an intimate friend of mine\r\nstaying there too, a man of great talent; I am sure you would get on\r\nwith him. [The Russian loves to be hospitable--of his friends if he can\r\noffer nothing else.] Really, you must come. And what would be better\r\nstill, come and stay with me, do. We could work and read together....\r\nI am busy, as you know, with history and philosophy. All that would\r\ninterest you. I have a lot of books.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov got up and walked about the room. \xe2\x80\x98Let me know,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98how\r\nmuch do you pay for your cottage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A hundred silver roubles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how many rooms are there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then one may reckon that one room costs twenty roubles?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, one may reckon so.... But really it\xe2\x80\x99s utterly unnecessary for me.\r\nIt simply stands empty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps so; but listen,\xe2\x80\x99 added Insarov, with a decided, but at the same\r\ntime good-natured movement of his head: \xe2\x80\x98I can only take advantage of\r\nyour offer if you agree to take the sum we have reckoned. Twenty roubles\r\nI am able to give, the more easily, since, as you say, I shall be\r\neconomising there in other things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course; but really I am ashamed to take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Otherwise it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, Andrei Petrovitch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, as you like; but what an obstinate fellow you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov again made no reply.\r\n\r\nThe young men made arrangements as to the day on which Insarov was to\r\nmove. They called the landlord; at first he sent his daughter, a little\r\ngirl of seven, with a large striped kerchief on her head; she listened\r\nattentively, almost with awe, to all Insarov said to her, and went away\r\nwithout speaking; after her, her mother, a woman far gone with child,\r\nmade her appearance, also wearing a kerchief on her head, but a very\r\ndiminutive one. Insarov informed her that he was going to stay at a\r\ncottage near Kuntsovo, but should keep on his lodging and leave all his\r\nthings in their keeping; the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s wife too seemed scared and\r\nwent away. At last the man himself came in: he seemed to understand\r\neverything from the first, and only said gloomily: \xe2\x80\x98Near Kuntsovo?\xe2\x80\x99 then\r\nall at once he opened the door and shouted: \xe2\x80\x98Are you going to keep the\r\nlodgings then?\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov reassured him. \xe2\x80\x98Well, one must know,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated\r\nthe tailor morosely, as he disappeared.\r\n\r\nBersenyev returned home, well content with the success of his proposal.\r\nInsarov escorted him to the door with cordial good manners, not common\r\nin Russia; and, when he was left alone, carefully took off his coat, and\r\nset to work upon sorting his papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day, Anna Vassilyevna was sitting in her\r\ndrawing-room and was on the verge of weeping. There were also in the\r\nroom her husband and a certain Uvar Ivanovitch Stahov, a distant cousin\r\nof Nikolai Artemyevitch, a retired cornet of sixty years old, a man\r\ncorpulent to the point of immobility, with sleepy yellowish eyes, and\r\ncolourless thick lips in a puffy yellow face. Ever since he had retired,\r\nhe had lived in Moscow on the interest of a small capital left him by\r\na wife who came of a shopkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s family. He did nothing, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether he thought of anything; if he did think, he kept his\r\nthoughts to himself. Once only in his life he had been thrown into a\r\nstate of excitement and shown signs of animation, and that was when he\r\nread in the newspapers of a new instrument at the Universal Exhibition\r\nin London, the \xe2\x80\x98contro-bombardon,\xe2\x80\x99 and became very anxious to order this\r\ninstrument for himself, and even made inquiries as to where to send\r\nthe money and through what office. Uvar Ivanovitch wore a loose\r\nsnuff-coloured coat and a white neckcloth, used to eat often and much,\r\nand in moments of great perplexity, that is to say when it happened to\r\nhim to express some opinion, he would flourish the fingers of his right\r\nhand meditatively in the air, with a convulsive spasm from the first\r\nfinger to the little finger, and back from the little finger to the\r\nfirst finger, while he articulated with effort, \xe2\x80\x98to be sure... there\r\nought to... in some sort of a way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch was sitting in an easy chair by the window, breathing\r\nheavily; Nikolai Artemyevitch was pacing with long strides up and\r\ndown the room, his hands thrust into his pockets; his face expressed\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe stood still at last and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98Yes;\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98in our\r\nday young men were brought up differently. Young men did not permit\r\nthemselves to be lacking in respect to their elders. And nowadays, I can\r\nonly look on and wonder. Possibly, I am all wrong, and they are quite\r\nright; possibly. But still I have my own views of things; I was not born\r\na fool. What do you think about it, Uvar Ivanovitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch could only look at him and work his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna, for instance,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, \xe2\x80\x98Elena\r\nNikolaevna I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to understand. I am not elevated enough for\r\nher. Her heart is so large that it embraces all nature down to the least\r\nspider or frog, everything in fact except her own father. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall very well; I know it, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble myself about it. For\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s nerves and education and lofty aspirations, and all that is not\r\nin my line. But Mr. Shubin... admitting he\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful artist--quite\r\nexceptional--that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute; to show want of respect to his\r\nelder, a man to whom, at any rate, one may say he is under great\r\nobligation; that I confess, _dans mon gros bon sens_, I cannot\r\npass over. I am not exacting by nature, no, but there is a limit to\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna rang the bell in a tremor. A little page came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why is it Pavel Yakovlitch does not come?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98what does it\r\nmean; I call him, and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what is the object, may I ask, of your wanting to send for him? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t expect that at all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it even!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the object, Nikolai Artemyevitch? He has disturbed you; very\r\nlikely he has checked the progress of your cure. I want to have an\r\nexplanation with him. I want to know how he has dared to annoy you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you again, that I do not ask that. And what can induce you ...\r\n_devant les domestiques_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna flushed a little. \xe2\x80\x98You need not say that, Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch. I never... _devant les domestiques_... Fedushka, go and\r\nsee you bring Pavel Yakovlitch here at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little page went off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch\r\nbetween his teeth, and he began again pacing up and down the room. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndid not bring up the subject with that object.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens, Paul must apologise to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens, what are his apologies to me? And what do you mean by\r\napologies? That\xe2\x80\x99s all words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, he must be corrected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you can correct him yourself. He will listen to you sooner than\r\nto me. For my part I bear him no grudge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, you\xe2\x80\x99ve not been yourself ever since you\r\narrived. You have even to my eyes grown thinner lately. I am afraid your\r\ntreatment is doing you no good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The treatment is quite indispensable,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Nikolai Artemyevitch,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my liver is affected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that instant Shubin came in. He looked tired. A slight almost\r\nironical smile played on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You asked for me, Anna Vassilyevna?\xe2\x80\x99 he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, certainly I asked for you. Really, Paul, this is dreadful. I am\r\nvery much displeased with you. How could you be wanting in respect to\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nikolai Artemyevitch has complained of me to you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Shubin, and\r\nwith the same smile on his lips he looked at Stahov. The latter turned\r\naway, dropping his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he complains of you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you have done amiss, but\r\nyou ought to apologise at once, because his health is very much deranged\r\njust now, and indeed we all ought when we are young to treat our\r\nbenefactors with respect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, what logic!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Shubin, and he turned to Stahov. \xe2\x80\x98I am ready\r\nto apologise to you, Nikolai Artemyevitch,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with a polite\r\nhalf-bow, \xe2\x80\x98if I have really offended you in any way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not at all... with that idea,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Nikolai Artemyevitch,\r\nstill as before avoiding Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. \xe2\x80\x98However, I will readily forgive\r\nyou, for, as you know, I am not an exacting person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that admits of no doubt!\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98But allow me to be\r\ninquisitive; is Anna Vassilyevna aware precisely what constituted my\r\noffence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I know nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Anna Vassilyevna, craning forward her\r\nhead expectantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Nikolai Artemyevitch hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x98how often have\r\nI prayed and besought, how often have I said how I hate these scenes\r\nand explanations! When one\xe2\x80\x99s been away an age, and comes home hoping for\r\nrest--talk of the family circle, _int\xc3\xa9rieur_, being a family man--and\r\nhere one finds scenes and unpleasantnesses. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a minute of\r\npeace. One\xe2\x80\x99s positively driven to the club... or, or elsewhere. A man is\r\nalive, he has a physical side, and it has its claims, but here----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd without concluding his sentence Nikolai Artemyevitch went quickly\r\nout, slamming the door.\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna looked after him. \xe2\x80\x98To the club!\xe2\x80\x99 she muttered bitterly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you are not going to the club, profligate? You\xe2\x80\x99ve no one at the club\r\nto give away my horses to--horses from my own stable--and the grey ones\r\ntoo! My favourite colour. Yes, yes, fickle-hearted man,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on\r\nraising her voice, \xe2\x80\x98you are not going to the club, As for you, Paul,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe pursued, getting up, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder you\xe2\x80\x99re not ashamed. I should have\r\nthought you would not be so childish. And now my head has begun to ache.\r\nWhere is Zoya, do you know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she\xe2\x80\x99s upstairs in her room. The wise little fox always hides in\r\nher hole when there\xe2\x80\x99s a storm in the air.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, please, please!\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna began searching about her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you seen my little glass of grated horse-radish? Paul, be so\r\ngood as not to make me angry for the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How make you angry, auntie? Give me your little hand to kiss. Your\r\nhorse-radish I saw on the little table in the boudoir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Darya always leaves it about somewhere,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna Vassilyevna, and she\r\nwalked away with a rustle of silk skirts.\r\n\r\nShubin was about to follow her, but he stopped on hearing Uvar\r\nIvanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s drawling voice behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would... have given it you... young puppy,\xe2\x80\x99 the retired cornet\r\nbrought out in gasps.\r\n\r\nShubin went up to him. \xe2\x80\x98And what have I done, then, most venerable Uvar\r\nIvanovitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How! you are young, be respectful. Yes indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Respectful to whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To whom? You know whom. Ay, grin away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin crossed his arms on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you type of the choice element in drama,\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nprimeval force of the black earth, cornerstone of the social fabric!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s fingers began to work. \xe2\x80\x98There, there, my boy, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprovoke me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98is a gentleman, not young to judge by\r\nappearances, but what blissful, child-like faith is still hidden in\r\nhim! Respect! And do you know, you primitive creature, what Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch was in a rage with me for? Why I spent the whole of this\r\nmorning with him at his German woman\xe2\x80\x99s; we were singing the three of\r\nus--\xe2\x80\x9cDo not leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d You should have heard us--that would have moved\r\nyou. We sang and sang, my dear sir--and well, I got bored; I could see\r\nsomething was wrong, there was an alarming tenderness in the air. And\r\nI began to tease them both. I was very successful. First she was angry\r\nwith me, then with him; and then he got angry with her, and told her\r\nthat he was never happy except at home, and he had a paradise there; and\r\nshe told him he had no morals; and I murmured \xe2\x80\x9cAch!\xe2\x80\x9d to her in German.\r\nHe walked off and I stayed behind; he came here, to his paradise that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto say, and he was soon sick of paradise, so he set to grumbling. Well\r\nnow, who do you consider was to blame?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Uvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\nShubin stared at him. \xe2\x80\x98May I venture to ask you, most reverend\r\nknight-errant,\xe2\x80\x99 he began in an obsequious voice, \xe2\x80\x98these enigmatical\r\nwords you have deigned to utter as the result of some exercise of your\r\nreflecting faculties, or under the influence of a momentary necessity to\r\nstart the vibration in the air known as sound?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tempt me, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 groaned Uvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\nShubin laughed and ran away. \xe2\x80\x98Hi,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Uvar Ivanovitch a quarter of\r\nan hour later, \xe2\x80\x98you there... a glass of spirits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little page brought the glass of spirits and some salt fish on a tray.\r\nUvar Ivanovitch slowly took the glass from the tray and gazed a long\r\nwhile with intense attention at it, as though he could not quite\r\nunderstand what it was he had in his hand. Then he looked at the page\r\nand asked him, \xe2\x80\x98Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his name Vaska?\xe2\x80\x99 Then he assumed an air of\r\nresignation, drank off the spirit, munched the herring and was slowly\r\nproceeding to get his handkerchief out of his pocket. But the page had\r\nlong ago carried off and put away the tray and the decanter, eaten up\r\nthe remains of the herring and had time to go off to sleep, curled up in\r\na great-coat of his master\xe2\x80\x99s, while Uvar Ivanovitch still continued to\r\nhold the handkerchief before him in his opened fingers, and with the\r\nsame intense attention gazed now at the window, now at the floor and\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nShubin went back to his room in the lodge and was just opening a book,\r\nwhen Nikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s valet came cautiously into his room and\r\nhanded him a small triangular note, sealed with a thick heraldic crest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 he found in the note, \xe2\x80\x98that you as a man of honour will\r\nnot allow yourself to hint by so much as a single word at a certain\r\npromissory note which was talked of this morning. You are acquainted\r\nwith my position and my rules, the insignificance of the sum in itself\r\nand the other circumstances; there are, in fine, family secrets which\r\nmust be respected, and family tranquillity is something so sacred that\r\nonly _\xc3\xaatres sans coeur_ (among whom I have no reason to reckon you) would\r\nrepudiate it! Give this note back to me.--N. S.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin scribbled below in pencil: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t excite yourself, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite\r\na sneak yet,\xe2\x80\x99 and gave the note back to the man, and again began\r\nupon the book. But it soon slipped out of his hands. He looked at the\r\nreddening sky, at the two mighty young pines standing apart from the\r\nother trees, thought \xe2\x80\x98by day pines are bluish, but how magnificently\r\ngreen they are in the evening,\xe2\x80\x99 and went out into the garden, in the\r\nsecret hope of meeting Elena there. He was not mistaken. Before him on a\r\npath between the bushes he caught a glimpse of her dress. He went after\r\nher, and when he was abreast with her, remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t look in my direction, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worth it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him a cursory glance, smiled cursorily, and walked on further\r\ninto the depths of the garden. Shubin went after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg you not to look at me,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98and then I address you;\r\nflagrant contradiction. But what of that? it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ncontradicted myself. I have just recollected that I have never begged\r\nyour pardon as I ought for my stupid behaviour yesterday. You are not\r\nangry with me, Elena Nikolaevna, are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe stood still and did not answer him at once--not because she was\r\nangry, but because her thoughts were far away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said at last, \xe2\x80\x98I am not in the least angry.\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin bit his\r\nlip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an absorbed... and what an indifferent face!\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered. \xe2\x80\x98Elena\r\nNikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, raising his voice, \xe2\x80\x98allow me to tell you a\r\nlittle anecdote. I had a friend, and this friend also had a friend, who\r\nat first conducted himself as befits a gentleman but afterwards took\r\nto drink. So one day early in the morning, my friend meets him in the\r\nstreet (and by that time, note, the acquaintance has been completely\r\ndropped) meets him and sees he is drunk. My friend went and turned his\r\nback on him. But he ran up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not be angry,\xe2\x80\x9d says he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif you refused to recognise me, but why should you turn your back\r\non me? Perhaps I have been brought to this through grief. Peace to my\r\nashes!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is that all?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. What are you hinting at? You told me just now\r\nnot to look your way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and now I have told you that it\xe2\x80\x99s too bad to turn your back on\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But did I?\xe2\x80\x99 began Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena flushed slightly and held out her hand to Shubin. He pressed it\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here you seem to have convicted me of a bad feeling,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nyour suspicion is unjust. I was not even thinking of avoiding you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Granted, granted. But you must acknowledge that at that minute you had\r\na thousand ideas in your head of which you would not confide one to me.\r\nEh? I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken the truth, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And why is it? why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My ideas are not clear to myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it\xe2\x80\x99s just the time for confiding them to some one else,\xe2\x80\x99 put in\r\nShubin. \xe2\x80\x98But I will tell you what it really is. You have a bad opinion\r\nof me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes you; you imagine that everything in me is half-humbug because I am\r\nan artist, that I am incapable not only of doing anything--in that you\r\nare very likely right--but even of any genuine deep feeling; you think\r\nthat I am not capable even of weeping sincerely, that I\xe2\x80\x99m a gossip and\r\na slanderer,--and all because I\xe2\x80\x99m an artist. What luckless, God-forsaken\r\nwretches we artists are after that! You, for instance, I am ready to\r\nadore, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in my repentance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Pavel Yakovlitch, I believe in your repentance and I believe in\r\nyour tears. But it seems to me that even your repentance amuses you--yes\r\nand your tears too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I see this is, as the doctors say, a hopeless case, _casus\r\nincurabilis_. There is nothing left but to bow the head and submit. And\r\nmeanwhile, good Heavens, can it be true, can I possibly be absorbed in\r\nmy own egoism when there is a soul like this living at my side? And to\r\nknow that one will never penetrate into that soul, never will know\r\nwhy it grieves and why it rejoices, what is working within it, what it\r\ndesires--whither it is going... Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said after a short silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98could you never under any circumstances love an artist?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena looked straight into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, Pavel Yakovlitch; no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which was to be proved,\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin with comical dejection. \xe2\x80\x98After\r\nwhich I suppose it would be more seemly for me not to intrude on your\r\nsolitary walk. A professor would ask you on what data you founded your\r\nanswer no. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a professor though, but a baby according to your\r\nideas; but one does not turn one\xe2\x80\x99s back on a baby, remember. Good-bye!\r\nPeace to my ashes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena was on the point of stopping him, but after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought she\r\ntoo said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin went out of the courtyard. At a short distance from the Stahov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse he was met by Bersenyev. He was walking with hurried steps, his\r\nhead bent and his hat pushed back on his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin.\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, go on,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98I only shouted, I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain\r\nyou--and you\xe2\x80\x99d better slip straight into the garden--you\xe2\x80\x99ll find Elena\r\nthere, I fancy she\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for you... she\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for some one\r\nanyway.... Do you understand the force of those words: she is waiting!\r\nAnd do you know, my dear boy, an astonishing circumstance? Imagine, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntwo years now that I have been living in the same house with her, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nin love with her, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only just now, this minute, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve, not\r\nunderstood, but really seen her. I have seen her and I lifted up my\r\nhands in amazement. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me, please, with that sham sarcastic\r\nsmile, which does not suit your sober features. Well, now, I suppose you\r\nwant to remind me of Annushka. What of it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. Annushkas\r\nare on my poor level. And long life to all Annushkas and Zoyas and even\r\nAugustina Christianovnas! You go to Elena now, and I will make my way\r\nto--Annushka, you fancy? No, my dear fellow, worse than that; to Prince\r\nTchikurasov. He is a Maecenas of a Kazan-Tartar stock, after the style\r\nof Volgin. Do you see this note of invitation, these letters, R.S.V.P.?\r\nEven in the country there\xe2\x80\x99s no peace for me. Addio!\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev listened\r\nto Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s tirade in silence, looking as though he were just a little\r\nashamed of him. Then he went into the courtyard of the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99 house.\r\nAnd Shubin did really go to Prince Tchikurasov, to whom with the most\r\ncordial air he began saying the most insulting things. The Maecenas of\r\nthe Tartars of Kazan chuckled; the Maecenas\xe2\x80\x99s guests laughed, but no one\r\nfelt merry, and every one was in a bad temper when the party broke up.\r\nSo two gentlemen slightly acquainted may be seen when they meet on the\r\nNevsky Prospect suddenly grinning at one another and pursing up their\r\neyes and noses and cheeks, and then, directly they have passed one\r\nanother, they resume their former indifferent, often cross, and\r\ngenerally sickly, expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nElena met Bersenyev cordially, though not in the garden, but the\r\ndrawing-room, and at once, almost impatiently, renewed the conversation\r\nof the previous day. She was alone; Nikolai Artemyevitch had quietly\r\nslipped away. Anna Vassilyevna was lying down upstairs with a wet\r\nbandage on her head. Zoya was sitting by her, the folds of her skirt\r\narranged precisely about her, and her little hands clasped on her knees.\r\nUvar Ivanovitch was reposing in the attic on a wide and comfortable\r\ndivan, known as a \xe2\x80\x98samo-son\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98dozer.\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev again mentioned his\r\nfather; he held his memory sacred. Let us, too, say a few words about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe owner of eighty-two serfs, whom he set free before his death, an\r\nold Gottingen student, and disciple of the \xe2\x80\x98Illuminati,\xe2\x80\x99 the author of\r\na manuscript work on \xe2\x80\x98transformations or typifications of the spirit in\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99--a work in which Schelling\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, Swedenborgianism\r\nand republicanism were mingled in the most original fashion--Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather brought him, while still a boy, to Moscow immediately after his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s death, and at once himself undertook his education. He\r\nprepared himself for each lesson, exerted himself with extraordinary\r\nconscientiousness and absolute lack of success: he was a dreamer, a\r\nbookworm, and a mystic; he spoke in a dull, hesitating voice, used\r\nobscure and roundabout expressions, metaphorical by preference, and was\r\nshy even of his son, whom he loved passionately. It was not surprising\r\nthat his son was simply bewildered at his lessons, and did not advance\r\nin the least. The old man (he was almost fifty, he had married late in\r\nlife) surmised at last that things were not going quite right, and he\r\nplaced his Andrei in a school. Andrei began to learn, but he was\r\nnot removed from his father\xe2\x80\x99s supervision; his father visited him\r\nunceasingly, wearying the schoolmaster to death with his instructions\r\nand conversation; the teachers, too, were bored by his uninvited visits;\r\nhe was for ever bringing them some, as they said, far-fetched books on\r\neducation. Even the schoolboys were embarrassed at the sight of the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s swarthy, pockmarked face, his lank figure, invariably clothed in\r\na sort of scanty grey dresscoat. The boys did not suspect then that this\r\ngrim, unsmiling old gentleman, with his crane-like gait and his long\r\nnose, was at heart troubling and yearning over each one of them almost\r\nas over his own son. He once conceived the idea of talking to them about\r\nWashington: \xe2\x80\x98My young nurslings,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, but at the first sounds of\r\nhis strange voice the young nurslings ran away. The good old Gottingen\r\nstudent did not lie on a bed of roses; he was for ever weighed down by\r\nthe march of history, by questions and ideas of every kind. When young\r\nBersenyev entered the university, his father used to drive with him\r\nto the lectures, but his health was already beginning to break up. The\r\nevents of the year 1848 shook him to the foundation (it necessitated the\r\nre-writing of his whole book), and he died in the winter of 1853, before\r\nhis son\xe2\x80\x99s time at the university was over, but he was able beforehand to\r\ncongratulate him on his degree, and to consecrate him to the service of\r\nscience. \xe2\x80\x98I pass on the torch to you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to him two hours before\r\nhis death. \xe2\x80\x98I held it while I could; you, too, must not let the light\r\ngrow dim before the end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev talked a long while to Elena of his father. The embarrassment\r\nhe had felt in her presence disappeared, and his lisp was less marked.\r\nThe conversation passed on to the university.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena asked him, \xe2\x80\x98were there any remarkable men among your\r\ncomrades?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev was again reminded of Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Elena Nikolaevna, to tell you the truth, there was not a single\r\nremarkable man among us. And, indeed, where are such to be found! There\r\nwas, they say, a good time once in the Moscow university! But not now.\r\nNow it\xe2\x80\x99s a school, not a university. I was not happy with my comrades,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe added, dropping his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not happy,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I ought,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Bersenyev, \xe2\x80\x98to make an exception. I know one\r\nstudent--it\xe2\x80\x99s true he is not in the same faculty--he is certainly a\r\nremarkable man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is his name?\xe2\x80\x99 Elena inquired with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Insarov Dmitri Nikanorovitch. He is a Bulgarian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a Russian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he is not a Russian,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why is he living in Moscow, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He came here to study. And do you know with what aim he is studying?\r\nHe has a single idea: the liberation of his country. And his story is\r\nan exceptional one. His father was a fairly well-to-do merchant; he came\r\nfrom Tirnova. Tirnova is now a small town, but it was the capital of\r\nBulgaria in the old days when Bulgaria was still an independent state.\r\nHe traded with Sophia, and had relations with Russia; his sister,\r\nInsarov\xe2\x80\x99s aunt, is still living in Kiev, married to a senior history\r\nteacher in the gymnasium there. In 1835, that is to say eighteen\r\nyears ago, a terrible crime was committed; Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s mother suddenly\r\ndisappeared without leaving a trace behind; a week later she was found\r\nmurdered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena shuddered. Bersenyev stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go on, go on,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There were rumours that she had been outraged and murdered by a Turkish\r\naga; her husband, Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s father, found out the truth, tried to avenge\r\nher, but only succeeded in wounding the aga with his poniard.... He was\r\nshot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shot, and without a trial?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Insarov was just eight years old at the time. He remained in\r\nthe hands of neighbours. The sister heard of the fate of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, and wanted to take the nephew to live with her. They got him\r\nto Odessa, and from there to Kiev. At Kiev he lived twelve whole years.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s how it is he speaks Russian so well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He speaks Russian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just as we do. When he was twenty (that was at the beginning of the\r\nyear 1848) he began to want to return to his country. He stayed in\r\nSophia and Tirnova, and travelled through the length and breadth of\r\nBulgaria, spending two years there, and learning his mother tongue\r\nover again. The Turkish Government persecuted him, and he was certainly\r\nexposed to great dangers during those two years; I once caught sight of\r\na broad scar on his neck, from a wound, no doubt; but he does not like\r\nto talk about it. He is reserved, too, in his own way. I have tried to\r\nquestion him about everything, but I could get nothing out of him. He\r\nanswers by generalities. He\xe2\x80\x99s awfully obstinate. He returned to Russia\r\nagain in 1850, to Moscow, with the intention of educating himself\r\nthoroughly, getting intimate with Russians, and then when he leaves the\r\nuniversity----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then?\xe2\x80\x99 broke in Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What God wills. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to forecast the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor a while Elena did not take her eyes off Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have greatly interested me by what you have told me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is he like, this friend of yours; what did you call him, Insarov?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall I say? To my mind, he\xe2\x80\x99s good-looking. But you will see him\r\nfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will bring him here to see you. He is coming to our little village\r\nthe day after tomorrow, and is going to live with me in the same\r\nlodging.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really? But will he care to come to see us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think so. He will be delighted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He isn\xe2\x80\x99t proud, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least. That\xe2\x80\x99s to say, he is proud if you like, only not in the\r\nsense you mean. He will never, for instance, borrow money from any one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he poor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t rich. When he went to Bulgaria he collected some relics\r\nleft of his father\xe2\x80\x99s property, and his aunt helps him; but it all comes\r\nto very little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must have a great deal of character,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He is a man of iron. And at the same time you will see there is\r\nsomething childlike and frank, with all his concentration and even his\r\nreserve. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, his frankness is not our poor sort of frankness--the\r\nfrankness of people who have absolutely nothing to conceal.... But\r\nthere, I will bring him to see you; wait a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And isn\xe2\x80\x99t he shy?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Elena again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not shy. It\xe2\x80\x99s only vain people who are shy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, are you vain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was confused and made a vague gesture with his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You excite my curiosity,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Elena. \xe2\x80\x98But tell me, has he not taken\r\nvengeance on that Turkish aga?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev smiled\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Revenge is only to be found in novels, Elena Nikolaevna; and, besides,\r\nin twelve years that aga may well be dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Insarov has never said anything, though, to you about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why did he go to Sophia?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His father used to live there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena grew thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To liberate one\xe2\x80\x99s country!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It is terrible even to utter\r\nthose words, they are so grand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that instant Anna Vassilyevna came into the room, and the\r\nconversation stopped.\r\n\r\nBersenyev was stirred by strange emotions when he returned home that\r\nevening. He did not regret his plan of making Elena acquainted with\r\nInsarov, he felt the deep impression made on her by his account of the\r\nyoung Bulgarian very natural... had he not himself tried to deepen that\r\nimpression! But a vague, unfathomable emotion lurked secretly in his\r\nheart; he was sad with a sadness that had nothing noble in it. This\r\nsadness did not prevent him, however, from setting to work on the\r\n_History of the Hohenstaufen_, and beginning to read it at the very page\r\nat which he had left off the evening before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Insarov in accordance with his promise arrived at\r\nBersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s with his luggage. He had no servant; but without any\r\nassistance he put his room to rights, arranged the furniture, dusted and\r\nswept the floor. He had special trouble with the writing table, which\r\nwould not fit into the recess in the wall assigned for it; but Insarov,\r\nwith the silent persistence peculiar to him succeeded in getting his own\r\nway with it. When he had settled in, he asked Bersenyev to let him pay\r\nhim ten roubles in advance, and arming himself with a thick stick, set\r\noff to inspect the country surrounding his new abode. He returned three\r\nhours later; and in response to Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to share his\r\nrepast, he said that he would not refuse to dine with him that day, but\r\nthat he had already spoken to the woman of the house, and would get her\r\nto send him up his meals for the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev, \xe2\x80\x98you will fare very badly; that old body\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t cook a bit. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you dine with me, we would go halves over\r\nthe cost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My means don\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to dine as you do,\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov replied with a\r\ntranquil smile.\r\n\r\nThere was something in that smile which forbade further insistence;\r\nBersenyev did not add a word. After dinner he proposed to Insarov that\r\nhe should take him to the Stahovs; but he replied that he had intended\r\nto devote the evening to correspondence with his Bulgarians, and so\r\nhe would ask him to put off the visit to the Stahovs till next day.\r\nBersenyev was already familiar with Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s unbending will; but it\r\nwas only now when he was under the same roof with him, that he fully\r\nrealised at last that Insarov would never alter any decision, just in\r\nthe same way as he would never fail to carry out a promise he had\r\ngiven; to Bersenyev--a Russian to his fingertips--this more than German\r\nexactitude seemed at first odd, and even rather ludicrous; but he soon\r\ngot used to it, and ended by finding it--if not deserving of respect--at\r\nleast very convenient.\r\n\r\nThe second day after his arrival, Insarov got up at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning, made a round of almost all Kuntsovo, bathed in the river, drank\r\na glass of cold milk, and then set to work. And he had plenty of work\r\nto do; he was studying Russian history and law, and political economy,\r\ntranslating the Bulgarian ballads and chronicles, collecting materials\r\non the Eastern Question, and compiling a Russian grammar for the use of\r\nBulgarians, and a Bulgarian grammar for the use of Russians. Bersenyev\r\nwent up to him and began to discuss Feuerbach. Insarov listened\r\nattentively, made few remarks, but to the point; it was clear from his\r\nobservations that he was trying to arrive at a conclusion as to whether\r\nhe need study Feuerbach, or whether he could get on without him.\r\nBersenyev turned the conversation on to his pursuits, and asked him if\r\nhe could not show him anything. Insarov read him his translation of two\r\nor three Bulgarian ballads, and was anxious to hear his opinion of them.\r\nBersenyev thought the translation a faithful one, but not sufficiently\r\nspirited. Insarov paid close attention to his criticism. From the\r\nballads Bersenyev passed on to the present position of Bulgaria, and\r\nthen for the first time he noticed what a change came over Insarov at\r\nthe mere mention of his country: not that his face flushed nor his\r\nvoice grew louder--no! but at once a sense of force and intense onward\r\nstriving was expressed in his whole personality, the lines of his mouth\r\ngrew harder and less flexible, and a dull persistent fire glowed in the\r\ndepths of his eyes. Insarov did not care to enlarge on his own travels\r\nin his country; but of Bulgaria in general he talked readily with any\r\none. He talked at length of the Turks, of their oppression, of\r\nthe sorrows and disasters of his countrymen, and of their hopes:\r\nconcentrated meditation on a single ruling passion could be heard in\r\nevery word he uttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no mistake about it,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev was reflecting\r\nmeanwhile, \xe2\x80\x98that Turkish aga, I venture to think, has been punished for\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov had not had time to say all he wanted to say, when the door\r\nopened and Shubin made his appearance.\r\n\r\nHe came into the room with an almost exaggerated air of ease and\r\ngood-humour; Bersenyev, who knew him well, could see at once that\r\nsomething had been jarring on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will introduce myself without ceremony,\xe2\x80\x99 he began with a bright and\r\nopen expression on his face. \xe2\x80\x98My name is Shubin; I\xe2\x80\x99m a friend of this\r\nyoung man here\xe2\x80\x99 (he indicated Bersenyev). \xe2\x80\x98You are Mr. Insarov, of\r\ncourse, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am Insarov.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then give me your hand and let us be friends. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Bersenyev\r\nhas talked to you about me, but he has told me a great deal about you.\r\nYou are staying here? Capital! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be offended at my staring at you\r\nso. I\xe2\x80\x99m a sculptor by trade, and I foresee I shall in a little time be\r\nbegging your permission to model your head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My head\xe2\x80\x99s at your service,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall we do to-day, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 began Shubin, sitting down suddenly on a\r\nlow chair, with his knees apart and his elbows propped on them. \xe2\x80\x98Andrei\r\nPetrovitch, has your honour any kind of plan for to-day? It\xe2\x80\x99s glorious\r\nweather; there\xe2\x80\x99s a scent of hay and dried strawberries as if one were\r\ndrinking strawberry-tea for a cold. We ought to get up some kind of\r\na spree. Let us show the new inhabitant of Kuntsov all its numerous\r\nbeauties.\xe2\x80\x99 (Something has certainly upset him, Bersenyev kept thinking\r\nto himself.) \xe2\x80\x98Well, why art thou silent, friend Horatio? Open your\r\nprophetic lips. Shall we go off on a spree, or not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Insarov feels,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98He is just\r\ngetting to work, I fancy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin turned round on his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You want to work?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired, in a somewhat condescending voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov; \xe2\x80\x98to-day I could give up to walking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 commented Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s delightful. Run along, my friend,\r\nAndrei Petrovitch, put a hat on your learned head, and let us go where\r\nour eyes lead us. Our eyes are young--they may lead us far. I know a\r\nvery repulsive little restaurant, where they will give us a very beastly\r\nlittle dinner; but we shall be very jolly. Come along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later they were all three walking along the bank of the\r\nMoskva. Insarov had a rather queer cap with flaps, over which Shubin\r\nfell into not very spontaneous raptures. Insarov walked without\r\nhaste, and looked about, breathing, talking, and smiling with the same\r\ntranquillity; he was giving this day up to pleasure, and enjoying it\r\nto the utmost. \xe2\x80\x98Just as well-behaved boys walk out on Sundays,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin\r\nwhispered in Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s ear. Shubin himself played the fool a great\r\ndeal, ran in front, threw himself into the attitudes of famous statues,\r\nand turned somersaults on the grass; Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s tranquillity did not\r\nexactly irritate him, but it spurred him on to playing antics. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\na fidget you are, Frenchman!\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev said twice to him. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am\r\nFrench, half French,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin answered, \xe2\x80\x98and you hold the happy medium\r\nbetween jest and earnest, as a waiter once said to me.\xe2\x80\x99 The young men\r\nturned away from the river and went along a deep and narrow ravine\r\nbetween two walls of tall golden rye; a bluish shadow was cast on them\r\nfrom the rye on one side; the flashing sunlight seemed to glide over the\r\ntops of the ears; the larks were singing, the quails were calling: on\r\nall sides was the brilliant green of the grass; a warm breeze stirred\r\nand lifted the leaves and shook the heads of the flowers. After\r\nprolonged wanderings, with rest and chat between (Shubin had even tried\r\nto play leap-frog with a toothless peasant they met, who did nothing but\r\nlaugh, whatever the gentlemen might do to him), the young men reached\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98repulsive little\xe2\x80\x99 restaurant: the waiter almost knocked each of\r\nthem over, and did really provide them with a very bad dinner with a\r\nsort of Balkan wine, which did not, however, prevent them from being\r\nvery jolly, as Shubin had foretold; he himself was the loudest and the\r\nleast jolly. He drank to the health of the incomprehensible but great\r\n_Venelin_, the health of the Bulgarian king Kuma, Huma, or Hroma, who\r\nlived somewhere about the time of Adam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the ninth century,\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov corrected him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the ninth century?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, how delightful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev noticed that among all his pranks, and jests and gaiety,\r\nShubin was constantly, as it were, examining Insarov; he was sounding\r\nhim and was in inward excitement, but Insarov remained as before, calm\r\nand straightforward.\r\n\r\nAt last they returned home, changed their dress, and resolved to finish\r\nthe day as they had begun it, by going that evening to the Stahovs.\r\nShubin ran on before them to announce their arrival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The conquering hero Insarov will be here directly!\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted\r\ntriumphantly, going into the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99 drawing-room, where there happened\r\nat the instant to be only Elena and Zoya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Wer_?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Zoya in German. When she was taken unawares she always\r\nused her native language. Elena drew herself up. Shubin looked at her\r\nwith a playful smile on his lips. She felt annoyed, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You heard,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Insarov is coming here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I heard,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied; \xe2\x80\x98and I heard how you spoke of him. I am\r\nsurprised at you, indeed. Mr. Insarov has not yet set foot in the house,\r\nand you already think fit to turn him into ridicule.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin was crestfallen at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are right, you are always right, Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but I meant nothing, on my honour. We have been walking together with\r\nhim the whole day, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a capital fellow, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask your opinion about that,\xe2\x80\x99 commented Elena, getting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mr. Insarov a young man?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Zoya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a hundred and forty-four,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Shubin with an air of\r\nvexation.\r\n\r\nThe page announced the arrival of the two friends. They came in.\r\nBersenyev introduced Insarov. Elena asked them to sit down, and sat\r\ndown herself, while Zoya went off upstairs; she had to inform Anna\r\nVassilyevna of their arrival. A conversation was begun of a rather\r\ninsignificant kind, like all first conversations. Shubin was silently\r\nwatching from a corner, but there was nothing to watch. In Elena he\r\ndetected signs of repressed annoyance against him--Shubin--and that was\r\nall. He looked at Bersenyev and at Insarov, and compared their\r\nfaces from a sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s point of view. \xe2\x80\x98They are neither of them\r\ngood-looking,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, \xe2\x80\x98the Bulgarian has a characteristic\r\nface--there now it\xe2\x80\x99s in a good light; the Great-Russian is better\r\nadapted for painting; there are no lines, there\xe2\x80\x99s expression. But, I\r\ndare say, one might fall in love with either of them. She is not in love\r\nyet, but she will fall in love with Bersenyev,\xe2\x80\x99 he decided to himself.\r\nAnna Vassilyevna made her appearance in the drawing-room, and\r\nthe conversation took the tone peculiar to summer villas--not the\r\ncountry-house tone but the peculiar summer visitor tone. It was a\r\nconversation diversified by plenty of subjects; but broken by short\r\nrather wearisome pauses every three minutes. In one of these pauses Anna\r\nVassilyevna turned to Zoya. Shubin understood her silent hint, and drew\r\na long face, while Zoya sat down to the piano, and played and sang all\r\nher pieces through. Uvar Ivanovitch showed himself for an instant in the\r\ndoorway, but he beat a retreat, convulsively twitching his fingers. Then\r\ntea was served; and then the whole party went out into the garden.... It\r\nbegan to grow dark outside, and the guests took leave.\r\n\r\nInsarov had really made less impression on Elena than she had expected,\r\nor, speaking more exactly, he had not made the impression she had\r\nexpected. She liked his directness and unconstraint, and she liked his\r\nface; but the whole character of Insarov--with his calm firmness and\r\neveryday simplicity--did not somehow accord with the image formed in her\r\nbrain by Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s account of him. Elena, though she did not\r\nherself suspect it, had anticipated something more fateful. \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nreflected, \xe2\x80\x98he spoke very little to-day, and I am myself to blame for\r\nit; I did not question him, we must have patience till next time...\r\nand his eyes are expressive, honest eyes.\xe2\x80\x99 She felt that she had no\r\ndisposition to humble herself before him, but rather to hold out her\r\nhand to him in friendly equality, and she was puzzled; this was not how\r\nshe had fancied men, like Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98heroes.\xe2\x80\x99 This last word reminded her\r\nof Shubin, and she grew hot and angry, as she lay in her bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you like your new acquaintances?\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev inquired of Insarov\r\non their way home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I liked them very much,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98especially the daughter.\r\nShe must be a nice girl. She is excitable, but in her it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine kind\r\nof excitability.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must go and see them a little oftener,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov; and he said nothing more all the way home.\r\nHe at once shut himself up in his room, but his candle was burning long\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\nBersenyev had had time to read a page of Raumer, when a handful of fine\r\ngravel came rattling on his window-pane. He could not help starting;\r\nopening the window he saw Shubin as white as a sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an irrepressible fellow you are, you night moth----\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev was\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sh--\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin cut him short; \xe2\x80\x98I have come to you in secret, as Max went\r\nto Agatha I absolutely must say a few words to you alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come into the room then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Shubin, and he leaned his elbows\r\non the window-sill, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s better fun like this, more as if we were in\r\nSpain. To begin with, I congratulate you, you\xe2\x80\x99re at a premium now. Your\r\nbelauded, exceptional man has quite missed fire. That I\xe2\x80\x99ll guarantee.\r\nAnd to prove my impartiality, listen--here\xe2\x80\x99s the sum and substance of\r\nMr. Insarov. No talents, none, no poetry, any amount of capacity for\r\nwork, an immense memory, an intellect not deep nor varied, but sound\r\nand quick, dry as dust, and force, and even the gift of the gab when the\r\ntalk\xe2\x80\x99s about his--between ourselves let it be said--tedious Bulgaria.\r\nWhat! do you say I am unjust? One remark more: you\xe2\x80\x99ll never come to\r\nChristian names with him, and none ever has been on such terms with him.\r\nI, of course, as an artist, am hateful to him; and I am proud of it. Dry\r\nas dust, dry as dust, but he can crush all of us to powder. He\xe2\x80\x99s devoted\r\nto his country--not like our empty patriots who fawn on the people; pour\r\ninto us, they say, thou living water! But, of course, his problem is\r\neasier, more intelligible: he has only to drive the Turks out, a mighty\r\ntask. But all these qualities, thank God, don\xe2\x80\x99t please women. There\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nfascination, no charm about them, as there is about you and me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why do you bring me in?\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98And you are wrong in\r\nall the rest; you are not in the least hateful to him, and with his own\r\ncountrymen he is on Christian name terms--that I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a different matter! For them he\xe2\x80\x99s a hero; but, to make a\r\nconfession, I have a very different idea of a hero; a hero ought not to\r\nbe able to talk; a hero should roar like a bull, but when he butts with\r\nhis horns, the walls shake. He ought not to know himself why he butts at\r\nthings, but just to butt at them. But, perhaps, in our days heroes of a\r\ndifferent stamp are needed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are you so taken up with Insarov?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98Can you have\r\nrun here only to describe his character to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came here,\xe2\x80\x99 began Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98because I was very miserable at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want to have a cry again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may laugh! I came here because I\xe2\x80\x99m at my wits\xe2\x80\x99 end, because I am\r\ndevoured by despair, anger, jealousy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Jealousy? of whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of you and him and every one. I\xe2\x80\x99m tortured by the thought that if I had\r\nunderstood her sooner, if I had set to work cleverly--But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use\r\nof talking! It must end by my always laughing, playing the fool, turning\r\nthings into ridicule as she says, and then setting to and strangling\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stuff, you won\xe2\x80\x99t strangle yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On such a night, of course not; but only let me live on till the\r\nautumn. On such a night people do die too, but only of happiness. Ah,\r\nhappiness! Every shadow that stretches across the road from every tree\r\nseems whispering now: \xe2\x80\x9cI know where there is happiness... shall I tell\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d I would ask you to come for a walk, only now you\xe2\x80\x99re under the\r\ninfluence of prose. Go to sleep, and may your dreams be visited by\r\nmathematical figures! My heart is breaking. You, worthy gentlemen, see\r\na man laughing, and that means to your notions he\xe2\x80\x99s all right; you can\r\nprove to him that he\xe2\x80\x99s humbugging himself, that\xe2\x80\x99s to say, he is not\r\nsuffering.... God bless you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin abruptly left the window. \xe2\x80\x98Annu-shka!\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev felt an impulse\r\nto shout after him, but he restrained himself; Shubin had really been\r\nwhite with emotion. Two minutes later, Bersenyev even caught the sound\r\nof sobbing; he got up and opened the window; everything was still, only\r\nsomewhere in the distance some one--a passing peasant, probably--was\r\nhumming \xe2\x80\x98The Plain of Mozdok.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first fortnight of Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s stay in the Kuntsovo\r\nneighbourhood, he did not visit the Stahovs more than four or five\r\ntimes; Bersenyev went to see them every day. Elena was always pleased to\r\nsee him, lively and interesting talk always sprang up between them,\r\nand yet he often went home with a gloomy face. Shubin scarcely showed\r\nhimself; he was working with feverish energy at his art; he either\r\nstayed locked up in his room, from which he would emerge in a blouse,\r\nsmeared all over with clay, or else he spent days in Moscow where he\r\nhad a studio, to which models and Italian sculptors, his friends and\r\nteachers, used to come to see him. Elena did not once succeed in talking\r\nwith Insarov, as she would have liked to do; in his absence she prepared\r\nquestions to ask him about many things, but when he came she felt\r\nashamed of her plans. Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s very tranquillity embarrassed her; it\r\nseemed to her that she had not the right to force him to speak out; and\r\nshe resolved to wait; for all that, she felt that at every visit however\r\ntrivial might be the words that passed between them, he attracted her\r\nmore and more; but she never happened to be left alone with him--and\r\nto grow intimate with any one, one must have at least one conversation\r\nalone with him. She talked a great deal about him to Bersenyev.\r\nBersenyev realised that Elena\xe2\x80\x99s imagination had been struck by Insarov,\r\nand was glad that his friend had not \xe2\x80\x98missed fire\xe2\x80\x99 as Shubin had\r\nasserted. He told her cordially all he knew of him down to the minutest\r\ndetails (we often, when we want to please some one, bring our friends\r\ninto our conversation, hardly ever suspecting that we are praising\r\nourselves in that way), and only at times, when Elena\xe2\x80\x99s pale cheeks\r\nflushed a little and her eyes grew bright and wide, he felt a pang in\r\nhis heart of that evil pain which he had felt before.\r\n\r\nOne day Bersenyev came to the Stahovs, not at the customary time, but at\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. Elena came down to him in the parlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 he began with a constrained smile, \xe2\x80\x98our Insarov has\r\ndisappeared.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Disappeared?\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has disappeared. The day before yesterday he went off somewhere and\r\nnothing has been seen of him since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did not tell you where he was going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena sank into a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has most likely gone to Moscow,\xe2\x80\x99 she commented, trying to seem\r\nindifferent and at the same time wondering that she should try to seem\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98He did not go alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With whom then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two people of some sort--his countrymen they must have been--came to\r\nhim the day before yesterday, before dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bulgarians! what makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why as far as I could hear, they talked to him in some language I did\r\nnot know, but Slavonic... You are always saying, Elena Nikolaevna, that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s so little mystery about Insarov; what could be more mysterious\r\nthan this visit? Imagine, they came to him--and then there was shouting\r\nand quarrelling, and such savage, angry disputing.... And he shouted\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He shouted too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He shouted at them. They seemed to be accusing each other. And\r\nif you could have had a peep at these visitors. They had swarthy, heavy\r\nfaces with high cheek bones and hook noses, both about forty years old,\r\nshabbily dressed, hot and dusty, looking like workmen--not workmen, and\r\nnot gentlemen--goodness knows what sort of people they were.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And he went away with them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He gave them something to eat and went off with them. The woman of\r\nthe house told me they ate a whole huge pot of porridge between the\r\ntwo of them. They outdid one another, she said, and gobbled it up like\r\nwolves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena gave a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will see,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98all this will be explained into something\r\nvery prosaic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it may! But you need not use that word. There is nothing prosaic\r\nabout Insarov, though Shubin does maintain----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shubin!\xe2\x80\x99 Elena broke in, shrugging her shoulders. \xe2\x80\x98But you must confess\r\nthese two good men gobbling up porridge----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even Themistocles had his supper on the eve of Salamis,\xe2\x80\x99 observed\r\nBersenyev with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but then there was a battle next day. Any way you will let me know\r\nwhen he comes back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, and she tried to change the subject,\r\nbut the conversation made little progress. Zoya made her appearance\r\nand began walking about the room on tip-toe, giving them thereby to\r\nunderstand that Anna Vassilyevna was not yet awake.\r\n\r\nBersenyev went away.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day a note from him was brought to Elena.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has come back,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote to her, \xe2\x80\x98sunburnt and dusty to his very\r\neyebrows; but where and why he went I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; won\xe2\x80\x99t you find out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you find out!\xe2\x80\x99 Elena whispered, \xe2\x80\x98as though he talked to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Elena was standing in the garden before a\r\nsmall kennel, where she was rearing two puppies. (A gardener had found\r\nthem deserted under a hedge, and brought them to the young mistress,\r\nbeing told by the laundry-maids that she took pity on beasts of\r\nall sorts. He was not wrong in his reckoning. Elena had given him a\r\nquarter-rouble.) She looked into the kennel, assured herself that the\r\npuppies were alive and well, and that they had been provided with fresh\r\nstraw, turned round, and almost uttered a cry; down an alley straight\r\ntowards her was walking Insarov, alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-morning,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, coming up to her and taking off his cap. She\r\nnoticed that he certainly had got much sunburnt during the last three\r\ndays. \xe2\x80\x98I meant to have come here with Andrei Petrovitch, but he was\r\nrather slow in starting; so here I am without him. There is no one in\r\nyour house; they are all asleep or out of doors, so I came on here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to be apologising,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Elena. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to do\r\nthat. We are always very glad to see you. Let us sit here on the bench\r\nin the shade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe seated herself. Insarov sat down near her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not been at home these last days, I think?\xe2\x80\x99 she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98I went away. Did Andrei Petrovitch tell you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov looked at her, smiled, and began playing with his cap. When he\r\nsmiled, his eyes blinked, and his lips puckered up, which gave him a\r\nvery good-humoured appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch most likely told you too that I went away with\r\nsome--unattractive people,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, still smiling.\r\n\r\nElena was a little confused, but she felt at once that Insarov must\r\nalways be told the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 she said decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you think of me?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked her suddenly.\r\n\r\nElena raised her eyes to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I thought that you always know what you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndoing, and you are incapable of doing anything wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--thanks for that. You see, Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, coming\r\ncloser to her in a confidential way, \xe2\x80\x98there is a little family of our\r\npeople here; among us there are men of little culture; but all are\r\nwarmly devoted to the common cause. Unluckily, one can never get on\r\nwithout dissensions, and they all know me, and trust me; so they sent\r\nfor me to settle a dispute. I went.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it far from here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went about fifty miles, to the Troitsky district. There, near the\r\nmonastery, there are some of our people. At any rate, my trouble was not\r\nthrown away; I settled the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And had you much difficulty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. One was obstinate through everything. He did not want to give back\r\nthe money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Was the dispute over money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and a small sum of money too. What did you suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you travelled over fifty miles for such trifling matters? Wasted\r\nthree days?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are not trifling matters, Elena Nikolaevna, when my countrymen are\r\ninvolved. It would be wicked to refuse in such cases. I see here that\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse help even to puppies, and I think well of you for it.\r\nAnd as for the time I have lost, that\xe2\x80\x99s no great harm; I will make it up\r\nlater. Our time does not belong to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To whom does it belong then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, to all who need us. I have told you all this on the spur of\r\nthe moment, because I value your good opinion. I can fancy how Andrei\r\nPetrovitch must have made you wonder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You value my good opinion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, in an undertone, \xe2\x80\x98why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov smiled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you are a good young lady, not an aristocrat... that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA short silence followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri Nikanorovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98do you know that this is the first\r\ntime you have been so unreserved with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How\xe2\x80\x99s that? I think I have always said everything I thought to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, this is the first time, and I am very glad, and I too want to be\r\nopen with you. May I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov began to laugh and said: \xe2\x80\x98You may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I warn you I am very inquisitive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, tell me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch has told me a great deal of your life, of your youth.\r\nI know of one event, one awful event.... I know you travelled afterwards\r\nin your own country.... Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer me for goodness sake, if you think\r\nmy question indiscreet, but I am fretted by one idea.... Tell me, did\r\nyou meet that man?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena caught her breath. She felt both shame and dismay at her own\r\naudacity. Insarov looked at her intently, slightly knitting his brows,\r\nand stroking his chin with his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he began at last, and his voice was much lower than\r\nusual, which almost frightened Elena, \xe2\x80\x98I understand what man you are\r\nreferring to. No, I did not meet him, and thank God I did not! I did not\r\ntry to find him. I did not try to find him: not because I did not\r\nthink I had a right to kill him--I would kill him with a very easy\r\nconscience--but because now is not the time for private revenge, when\r\nwe are concerned with the general national vengeance--or no, that is not\r\nthe right word--when we are concerned with the liberation of a people.\r\nThe one would be a hindrance to the other. In its own time that, too,\r\nwill come... that too will come,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, and he shook his head.\r\n\r\nElena looked at him from the side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You love your country very dearly?\xe2\x80\x99 she articulated timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That remains to be shown,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98When one of us dies for her,\r\nthen one can say he loved his country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So that, if you were cut off all chance of returning to Bulgaria,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncontinued Elena, \xe2\x80\x98would you be very unhappy in Russia?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov looked down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I could not bear that,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena began again, \xe2\x80\x98is it difficult to learn Bulgarian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace to a Russian not to know Bulgarian. A\r\nRussian ought to know all the Slavonic dialects. Would you like me\r\nto bring you some Bulgarian books? You will see how easy it is. What\r\nballads we have! equal to the Servian. But stop a minute, I will\r\ntranslate to you one of them. It is about... But you know a little of\r\nour history at least, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I know nothing of it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\n\r\nElena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a little and I will bring you a book. You will learn the principal\r\nfacts at least from it. Listen to the ballad then.... But I had better\r\nbring you a written translation, though. I am sure you will love us, you\r\nlove all the oppressed. If you knew what a land of plenty ours is! And,\r\nmeanwhile, it has been downtrodden, it has been ravaged,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on,\r\nwith an involuntary movement of his arm, and his face darkened; \xe2\x80\x98we\r\nhave been robbed of everything; everything, our churches, our laws, our\r\nlands; the unclean Turks drive us like cattle, butcher us----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri Nikanorovitch!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Elena.\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon. I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak of this coolly. But you asked me just\r\nnow whether I love my country. What else can one love on earth? What is\r\nthe one thing unchanging, what is above all doubts, what is it--next to\r\nGod--one must believe in? And when that country needs. ... Think; the\r\npoorest peasant, the poorest beggar in Bulgaria, and I have the same\r\ndesire. All of us have one aim. You can understand what strength, what\r\nconfidence that gives!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov was silent for an instant; then he began again to talk of\r\nBulgaria. Elena listened to him with absorbed, profound, and mournful\r\nattention. When he had finished, she asked him once more:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you would not stay in Russia for anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when he went away, for a long time she gazed after him. On that day\r\nhe had become a different man for her. When she walked back with him\r\nthrough the garden, he was no longer the man she had met two hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFrom that day he began to come more and more often, and Bersenyev less\r\nand less often. A strange feeling began to grow up between the two\r\nfriends, of which they were both conscious, but to which they could\r\nnot give a name, and which they feared to analyse. In this way a month\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna, as the reader knows already, liked staying at home;\r\nbut at times she manifested, quite unexpectedly, an irresistible longing\r\nfor something out of the common, some extraordinary _partie du\r\nplaisir_, and the more troublesome the _partie du plaisir_ was, the\r\nmore preparations and arrangements it required, and the greater Anna\r\nVassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s own agitation over it, the more pleasure it gave her. If\r\nthis mood came upon her in winter, she would order two or three boxes\r\nto be taken side by side, and, inviting all her acquaintances, would set\r\noff to the theatre or even to a masquerade; in summer she would drive\r\nfor a trip out of town to some spot as far off as possible. The next day\r\nshe would complain of a headache, groan and keep her bed; but within two\r\nmonths the same craving for something \xe2\x80\x98out of the common\xe2\x80\x99 would break\r\nout in her again. That was just what happened now. Some one chanced\r\nto refer to the beautiful scenery of Tsaritsino before her, and Anna\r\nVassilyevna suddenly announced an intention of driving to Tsaritsino the\r\nday after tomorrow. The household was thrown into a state of bustle;\r\na messenger galloped off to Moscow for Nikolai Artemyevitch; with him\r\ngalloped the butler to buy wines, pies, and all sorts of provisions;\r\nShubin was commissioned to hire an open carriage--the coach alone was\r\nnot enough--and to order relays of horses to be ready; a page was\r\ntwice despatched to Bersenyev and Insarov with two different notes of\r\ninvitation, written by Zoya, the first in Russian, the second in French;\r\nAnna Vassilyevna herself was busy over the dresses of the young ladies\r\nfor the expedition. Meanwhile the _partie du plaisir_ was very near\r\ncoming to grief. Nikolai Artemyevitch arrived from Moscow in a sour,\r\nill-natured, _frondeurish_ frame of mind. He was still sulky with\r\nAugustina Christianovna; and when he heard what the plan was, he flatly\r\ndeclared that he would not go; that to go trotting from Kuntsovo to\r\nMoscow and from Moscow to Tsaritsino, and then from Tsaritsino again to\r\nMoscow, from Moscow again to Kuntsovo, was a piece of folly; and, \xe2\x80\x98in\r\nfact,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98let them first prove to my satisfaction, that one can\r\nbe merrier on one spot of the globe than another spot, and I will\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x99 This, of course, no one could prove to his satisfaction, and Anna\r\nVassilyevna was ready to throw up the _partie du plaisir_ for lack of a\r\nsolid escort; but she recollected Uvar Ivanovitch, and in her distress\r\nshe sent to his room for him, saying: \xe2\x80\x98a drowning man catches at\r\nstraws.\xe2\x80\x99 They waked him up; he came down, listened in silence to Anna\r\nVassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s proposition, and, to the general astonishment, with a\r\nflourish of his fingers, he consented to go. Anna Vassilyevna kissed\r\nhim on the cheek, and called him a darling; Nikolai Artemyevitch smiled\r\ncontemptuously and said: _quelle bourde!_ (he liked on occasions to make\r\nuse of a \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99 French word); and the following morning the coach and\r\nthe open carriage, well-packed, rolled out of the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99 court-yard.\r\nIn the coach were the ladies, a maid, and Bersenyev; Insarov was seated\r\non the box; and in the open carriage were Uvar Ivanovitch and Shubin.\r\nUvar Ivanovitch had himself beckoned Shubin to him; he knew that\r\nhe would tease him the whole way, but there existed a queer sort of\r\nattachment, marked by abusive candour, between the \xe2\x80\x98primeval force\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthe young artist. On this occasion, however, Shubin left his fat friend\r\nin peace; he was absent-minded, silent, and gentle.\r\n\r\nThe sun stood high in a cloudless blue sky when the carriage drove up to\r\nthe ruins of Tsaritsino Castle, which looked gloomy and menacing, even\r\nat mid-day. The whole party stepped out on to the grass, and at once\r\nmade a move towards the garden. In front went Elena and Zoya with\r\nInsarov; Anna Vassilyevna, with an expression of perfect happiness on\r\nher face, walked behind them, leaning on the arm of Uvar Ivanovitch. He\r\nwaddled along panting, his new straw hat cut his forehead, and his feet\r\ntwinged in his boots, but he was content; Shubin and Bersenyev brought\r\nup the rear. \xe2\x80\x98We will form the reserve, my dear boy, like veterans,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhispered Shubin to Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s in it now!\xe2\x80\x99 he added,\r\nindicating Elena with his eyebrows.\r\n\r\nThe weather was glorious. Everything around was flowering, humming,\r\nsinging; in the distance shone the waters of the lakes; a light-hearted\r\nholiday mood took possession of all. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, how beautiful; oh, how\r\nbeautiful!\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna repeated incessantly; Uvar Ivanovitch\r\nkept nodding his head approvingly in response to her enthusiastic\r\nexclamations, and once even articulated: \xe2\x80\x98To be sure! to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99 From\r\ntime to time Elena exchanged a few words with Insarov; Zoya held the\r\nbrim of her large hat with two fingers while her little feet, shod in\r\nlight grey shoes with rounded toes, peeped coquettishly out from under\r\nher pink bar\xc3\xa8ge dress; she kept looking to each side and then behind\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x98Hey!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin suddenly in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98Zoya Nikitishna is\r\non the lookout, it seems. I will go to her. Elena Nikolaevna despises me\r\nnow, while you, Andrei Petrovitch, she esteems, which comes to the same\r\nthing. I am going; I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of being glum. I should advise you, my dear\r\nfellow, to do some botanising; that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing you could hit on in\r\nyour position; it might be useful, too, from a scientific point of\r\nview. Farewell!\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin ran up to Zoya, offered her his arm, and saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Ihre Hand, Madame_\xe2\x80\x99 caught hold of her hand, and pushed on ahead with\r\nher. Elena stopped, called to Bersenyev, and also took his arm,\r\nbut continued talking to Insarov. She asked him the words for\r\nlily-of-the-valley, clover, oak, lime, and so on in his language...\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s in it!\xe2\x80\x99 thought poor Andrei Petrovitch.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shriek was heard in front; every one looked up. Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncigar-case fell into a bush, flung by Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x98Wait a minute, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npay you out!\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted, as he crept into the bushes; he found his\r\ncigar-case, and was returning to Zoya; but he had hardly reached her\r\nside when again his cigar-case was sent flying across the road. Five\r\ntimes this trick was repeated, he kept laughing and threatening her, but\r\nZoya only smiled slyly and drew herself together, like a little cat.\r\nAt last he snatched her fingers, and squeezed them so tightly that\r\nshe shrieked, and for a long time afterwards breathed on her hand,\r\npretending to be angry, while he murmured something in her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mischievous things, young people,\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna observed gaily to\r\nUvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\nHe flourished his fingers in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a girl Zoya Nikitishna is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev to Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Shubin? What of him?\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the whole party went into the arbour, well known as Pleasant\r\nView arbour, and stopped to admire the view of the Tsaritsino lakes.\r\nThey stretched one behind the other for several miles, overshadowed by\r\nthick woods. The bright green grass, which covered the hill sloping\r\ndown to the largest lake, gave the water itself an extraordinarily vivid\r\nemerald colour. Even at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge not a ripple stirred the\r\nsmooth surface. One might fancy it a solid mass of glass lying heavy and\r\nshining in a huge font; the sky seemed to drop into its depths, while\r\nthe leafy trees gazed motionless into its transparent bosom. All were\r\nabsorbed in long and silent admiration of the view; even Shubin was\r\nstill; even Zoya was impressed. At last, all with one mind, began to\r\nwish to go upon the water. Shubin, Insarov, and Bersenyev raced each\r\nother over the grass. They succeeded in finding a large painted boat\r\nand two boatmen, and beckoned to the ladies. The ladies stepped into\r\nthe boat; Uvar Ivanovitch cautiously lowered himself into it after\r\nthem. Great was the mirth while he got in and took his seat. \xe2\x80\x98Look out,\r\nmaster, don\xe2\x80\x99t drown us,\xe2\x80\x99 observed one of the boatmen, a snubnosed\r\nyoung fellow in a gay print shirt. \xe2\x80\x98Get along, you swell!\xe2\x80\x99 said Uvar\r\nIvanovitch. The boat pushed off. The young men took up the oars, but\r\nInsarov was the oniy one of them who could row. Shubin suggested that\r\nthey should sing some Russian song in chorus, and struck up: \xe2\x80\x98Down\r\nthe river Volga\xe2\x80\x99... Bersenyev, Zoya, and even Anna Vassilyevna, joined\r\nin--Insarov could not sing--but they did not keep together; at the third\r\nverse the singers were all wrong. Only Bersenyev tried to go on in\r\nthe bass, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing on the waves is seen,\xe2\x80\x99 but he, too, was soon in\r\ndifficulties. The boatmen looked at one another and grinned in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin, turning to them, \xe2\x80\x98the gentlefolks can\xe2\x80\x99t sing, you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x99 The boy in the print shirt only shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98Wait a little\r\nsnubnose,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98we will show you. Zoya Nikitishna, sing us\r\n_Le lac_ of Niedermeyer. Stop rowing!\xe2\x80\x99 The wet oars stood still, lifted\r\nin the air like wings, and their splash died away with a tuneful drip;\r\nthe boat drifted on a little, then stood still, rocking lightly on the\r\nwater like a swan. Zoya affected to refuse at first.... \xe2\x80\x98_Allons_\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAnna Vassilyevna genially.... Zoya took off her hat and began to sing:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_O lac, l\xe2\x80\x99ann\xc3\xa9e \xc3\xa0 peine a fini sa carri\xc3\xa8re_!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer small, but pure voice, seemed to dart over the surface of the lake;\r\nevery word echoed far off in the woods; it sounded as though some one\r\nwere singing there, too, in a distinct, but mysterious and unearthly\r\nvoice. When Zoya finished, a loud bravo was heard from an arbour\r\nnear the bank, from which emerged several red-faced Germans who were\r\npicnicking at Tsaritsino. Several of them had their coats off, their\r\nties, and even their waistcoats; and they shouted \xe2\x80\x98_bis!_\xe2\x80\x99 with such\r\nunmannerly insistence that Anna Vassilyevna told the boatmen to row as\r\nquickly as possible to the other end of the lake. But before the boat\r\nreached the bank, Uvar Ivanovitch once more succeeded in surprising his\r\nfriends; having noticed that in one part of the wood the echo repeated\r\nevery sound with peculiar distinctness, he suddenly began to call like a\r\nquail. At first every one was startled, but they listened directly with\r\nreal pleasure, especially as Uvar Ivanovitch imitated the quail\xe2\x80\x99s cry\r\nwith great correctness. Spurred on by this, he tried mewing like a\r\ncat; but this did not go off so well; and after one more quail-call, he\r\nlooked at them all and stopped. Shubin threw himself on him to kiss him;\r\nhe pushed him off. At that instant the boat touched the bank, and all\r\nthe party got out and went on shore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the coachman, with the groom and the maid, had brought the\r\nbaskets out of the coach, and made dinner ready on the grass under the\r\nold lime-trees. They sat down round the outspread tablecloth, and fell\r\nupon the pies and other dainties. They all had excellent appetites,\r\nwhile Anna Vassilyevna, with unflagging hospitality, kept urging the\r\nguests to eat more, assuring them that nothing was more wholesome than\r\neating in the open air. She even encouraged Uvar Ivanovitch with such\r\nassurances. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about me!\xe2\x80\x99 he grunted with his mouth full.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such a lovely day is a God-send, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated constantly.\r\nOne would not have known her; she seemed fully twenty years younger.\r\nBersenyev said as much to her. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes.\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98I could hold my\r\nown with any one in my day.\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin attached himself to Zoya, and kept\r\npouring her out wine; she refused it, he pressed her, and finished by\r\ndrinking the glass himself, and again pressing her to take another; he\r\nalso declared that he longed to lay his head on her knee; she would on\r\nno account permit him \xe2\x80\x98such a liberty.\xe2\x80\x99 Elena seemed the most serious of\r\nthe party, but in her heart there was a wonderful sense of peace, such\r\nas she had not known for long. She felt filled with boundless goodwill\r\nand kindness, and wanted to keep not only Insarov, but Bersenyev too,\r\nalways at her side.... Andrei Petrovitch dimly understood what this\r\nmeant, and secretly he sighed.\r\n\r\nThe hours flew by; the evening was coming on. Anna Vassilyevna suddenly\r\ntook alarm. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, my dear friends, how late it is!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98All\r\ngood things must have an end; it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go home.\xe2\x80\x99 She began bustling\r\nabout, and they all hastened to get up and walk towards the castle,\r\nwhere the carriages were. As they walked past the lakes, they stopped\r\nto admire Tsaritsino for the last time. The landscape on all sides\r\nwas glowing with the vivid hues of early evening; the sky was red, the\r\nleaves were flashing with changing colours as they stirred in the rising\r\nwind; the distant waters shone in liquid gold; the reddish turrets and\r\narbours scattered about the garden stood out sharply against the dark\r\ngreen of the trees. \xe2\x80\x98Farewell, Tsaritsino, we shall not forget to-day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcursion!\xe2\x80\x99 observed Anna Vassilyevna.... But at that instant, and as\r\nthough in confirmation of her words, a strange incident occurred, which\r\ncertainly was not likely to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis was what happened. Anna Vassilyevna had hardly sent her farewell\r\ngreeting to Tsaritsino, when suddenly, a few paces from her, behind\r\na high bush of lilac, were heard confused exclamations, shouts, and\r\nlaughter; and a whole mob of disorderly men, the same devotees of song\r\nwho had so energetically applauded Zoya, burst out on the path. These\r\nmusical gentlemen seemed excessively elevated. They stopped at the sight\r\nof the ladies; but one of them, a man of immense height, with a bull\r\nneck and a bull\xe2\x80\x99s goggle eyes, separated from his companions, and,\r\nbowing clumsily and staggering unsteadily in his gait, approached Anna\r\nVassilyevna, who was petrified with alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Bonzhoor, madame_,\xe2\x80\x99 he said thickly, \xe2\x80\x98how are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna started back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the giant in vile Russian, \xe2\x80\x98sing again\r\nwhen our party shouted _bis_, and bravo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, why?\xe2\x80\x99 came from the ranks of his comrades.\r\n\r\nInsarov was about to step forward, but Shubin stopped him, and himself\r\nscreened Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Allow me,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98honoured stranger, to express to you the\r\nheartfelt amazement, into which you have thrown all of us by your\r\nconduct. You belong, as far as I can judge, to the Saxon branch of the\r\nCaucasian race; consequently we are bound to assume your acquaintance\r\nwith the customs of society, yet you address a lady to whom you have not\r\nbeen introduced. I assure you that I individually should be delighted\r\nanother time to make your acquaintance, since I observe in you a\r\nphenomenal development of the muscles, biceps, triceps and deltoid, so\r\nthat, as a sculptor, I should esteem it a genuine happiness to have you\r\nfor a model; but on this occasion kindly leave us alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98honoured stranger\xe2\x80\x99 listened to Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s speech, his head held\r\ncontemptuously on one side and his arms akimbo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what you say,\xe2\x80\x99 he commented at last. \xe2\x80\x98Do you suppose\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a cobbler or a watchmaker? Hey! I\xe2\x80\x99m an officer, an official, so\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that----\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin was beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I say is,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the stranger, putting him aside with his\r\npowerful arm, like a twig out of the path--\xe2\x80\x98why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you sing again\r\nwhen we shouted _bis_? And I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away directly, this minute, only I\r\ntell you what I want, this _fr\xc3\xa4ulein_, not that madam, no, not her, but\r\nthis one or that one (he pointed to Elena and Zoya) must give me _einen\r\nKuss_, as we say in German, a kiss, in fact; eh? That\xe2\x80\x99s not much to\r\nask.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Einen Kuss_, that\xe2\x80\x99s not much,\xe2\x80\x99 came again from the ranks of his\r\ncompanions, \xe2\x80\x98_Ih! der Stakramenter!_\xe2\x80\x99 cried one tipsy German, bursting\r\nwith laughter.\r\n\r\nZoya clutched at Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s arm, but he broke away from her, and stood\r\ndirectly facing the insolent giant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will please to move off,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a voice not loud but sharp.\r\n\r\nThe German gave a heavy laugh, \xe2\x80\x98Move off? Well, I like that. Can\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nwalk where I please? Move off? Why should I move off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you have dared to annoy a lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov, and suddenly he\r\nturned white, \xe2\x80\x98because you\xe2\x80\x99re drunk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? me drunk? Hear what he says. _H\xc3\xb6ren Sie das, Herr Provisor_? I\xe2\x80\x99m an\r\nofficer, and he dares... Now I demand _satisfaction_! _Einen Kuss will\r\nich_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you come another step nearer----\xe2\x80\x99 began Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well? What then\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw you in the water!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the water? _Herr Je_! Is that all? Well, let us see that, that would\r\nbe very curious, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe officer lifted his fists and moved forward, but suddenly something\r\nextraordinary happened. He uttered an exclamation, his whole bulky\r\nperson staggered, rose from the ground, his legs kicking in the air, and\r\nbefore the ladies had time to shriek, before any one had time to realise\r\nhow it had happened, the officer\xe2\x80\x99s massive figure went plop with a heavy\r\nsplash, and at once disappeared under the eddying water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 screamed the ladies with one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Mein Gott_!\xe2\x80\x99 was heard from the other side.\r\n\r\nAn instant passed... and a round head, all plastered\r\nover with wet hair, showed above water, it was blowing bubbles, this\r\nhead; and floundering with two hands just at its very lips. \xe2\x80\x98He will be\r\ndrowned, save him! save him!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Anna Vassilyevna to Insarov, who was\r\nstanding with his legs apart on the bank, breathing heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will swim out,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered with contemptuous and unsympathetic\r\nindifference. \xe2\x80\x98Let us go on,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, taking Anna Vassilyevna by the\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x98Come, Uvar Ivanovitch, Elena Nikolaevna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A--a--o--o\xe2\x80\x99 was heard at that instant, the plaint of the hapless German\r\nwho had managed to get hold of the rushes on the bank.\r\n\r\nThey all followed Insarov, and had to pass close by the party. But,\r\ndeprived of their leader, the rowdies were subdued and did not utter\r\na word; but one, the boldest of them, muttered, shaking his head\r\nmenacingly: \xe2\x80\x98All right... we shall see though... after that\xe2\x80\x99; but one of\r\nthe others even took his hat off. Insarov struck them as formidable,\r\nand rightly so; something evil, something dangerous could be seen in his\r\nface. The Germans hastened to pull out their comrade, who, directly he\r\nhad his feet on dry ground, broke into tearful abuse and shouted after\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Russian scoundrels,\xe2\x80\x99 that he would make a complaint, that he would\r\ngo to Count Von Kizerits himself, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut the \xe2\x80\x98Russian scoundrels\xe2\x80\x99 paid no attention to his vociferations, and\r\nhurried on as fast as they could to the castle. They were all silent, as\r\nthey walked through the garden, though Anna Vassilyevna sighed a little.\r\nBut when they reached the carriages and stood still, they broke into\r\nan irrepressible, irresistible fit of Homeric laughter. First Shubin\r\nexploded, shrieking as if he were mad, Bersenyev followed with his\r\ngurgling guffaw, then Zoya fell into thin tinkling little trills, Anna\r\nVassilyevna too suddenly broke down, Elena could not help smiling, and\r\neven Insarov at last could not resist it. But the loudest, longest, most\r\npersistent laugh was Uvar Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s; he laughed till his sides ached,\r\ntill he choked and panted. He would calm down a little, then would\r\nmurmur through his tears: \xe2\x80\x98I--thought--what\xe2\x80\x99s that splash--and\r\nthere--he--went plop.\xe2\x80\x99 And with the last word, forced out with\r\nconvulsive effort, his whole frame was shaking with another burst of\r\nlaughter. Zoya made him worse. \xe2\x80\x98I saw his legs,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98kicking in\r\nthe air.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Uvar Ivanovitch, \xe2\x80\x98his legs, his legs--and\r\nthen splash!--there he plopped in!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how did Mr. Insarov manage it? why the German was three times his\r\nsize?\xe2\x80\x99 said Zoya.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Uvar Ivanovitch, rubbing his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98I saw;\r\nwith one arm about his waist, he tripped him up, and he went plop! I\r\nheard--a splash--there he went.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLong after the carriages had started, long after the castle of\r\nTsaritsino was out of sight, Uvar Ivanovitch was still unable to regain\r\nhis composure. Shubin, who was again with him in the carriage, began to\r\ncry shame on him at last.\r\n\r\nInsarov felt ashamed. He sat in the coach facing Elena (Bersenyev had\r\ntaken his seat on the box), and he said nothing; she too was silent. He\r\nthought that she was condemning his action; but she did not condemn him.\r\nShe had been scared at the first minute; then the expression of his face\r\nhad impressed her; afterwards she pondered on it all. It was not quite\r\nclear to her what the nature of her reflections was. The emotion she had\r\nfelt during the day had passed away; that she realised; but its\r\nplace had been taken by another feeling which she did not yet fully\r\nunderstand. The _partie de plaisir_ had been prolonged too late;\r\ninsensibly evening passed into night. The carriage rolled swiftly along,\r\nnow beside ripening cornfields, where the air was heavy and fragrant\r\nwith the smell of wheat; now beside wide meadows, from which a sudden\r\nwave of freshness blew lightly in the face. The sky seemed to lie\r\nlike smoke over the horizon. At last the moon rose, dark and red. Anna\r\nVassilyevna was dozing; Zoya had poked her head out of window and was\r\nstaring at the road. It occurred to Elena at last that she had not\r\nspoken to Insarov for more than an hour. She turned to him with a\r\ntrifling question; he at once answered her, delighted. Dim sounds began\r\nstirring indistinctly in the air, as though thousands of voices were\r\ntalking in the distance; Moscow was coming to meet them. Lights twinkled\r\nafar off; they grew more and more frequent; at last there was the\r\ngrating of the cobbles under their wheels. Anna Vassilyevna awoke, every\r\none in the carriage began talking, though no one could hear what was\r\nsaid; everything was drowned in the rattle of the cobbles under the two\r\ncarriages, and the hoofs of the eight horses. Long and wearisome seemed\r\nthe journey from Moscow to Kuntsovo; all the party were asleep or\r\nsilent, leaning with their heads pressed into their respective\r\ncorners; Elena did not close her eyes; she kept them fixed on Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndimly-outlined figure. A mood of sadness had come upon Shubin; the\r\nbreeze was blowing into his eyes and irritating him; he retired into the\r\ncollar of his cloak and was on the point of tears. Uvar Ivanovitch was\r\nsnoring blissfully, rocking from side to side. The carriages came to a\r\nstandstill at last. Two men-servants lifted Anna Vassilyevna out of\r\nthe carriage; she was all to pieces, and at parting from her fellow\r\ntravellers, announced that she was \xe2\x80\x98nearly dead\xe2\x80\x99; they began thanking\r\nher, but she only repeated, \xe2\x80\x98nearly dead.\xe2\x80\x99 Elena for the first time\r\npressed Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s hand at parting, and for a long while she sat at her\r\nwindow before undressing; Shubin seized an opportunity to whisper to\r\nBersenyev:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a hero; he can pitch drunken Germans into the river!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even do that,\xe2\x80\x99 retorted Bersenyev, and he started\r\nhomewards with Insarov.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was already showing in the sky when the two friends reached\r\ntheir lodging. The sun had not yet risen, but already the chill of\r\ndaybreak was in the air, a grey dew covered the grass, and the first\r\nlarks were trilling high, high up in the shadowy infinity of air, whence\r\nlike a solitary eye looked out the great, last star.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after her acquaintance with Insarov, Elena (for the fifth or sixth\r\ntime) began a diary. Here are some extracts from it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_June_.... Andrei Petrovitch brings me books, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t read them.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed to confess it to him; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to give back the\r\nbooks, tell lies, say I have read them. I feel that would mortify him.\r\nHe is always watching me. He seems devoted to me. A very good man,\r\nAndrei Petrovitch.... What is it I want? Why is my heart so heavy, so\r\noppressed? Why do I watch the birds with envy as they fly past? I feel\r\nthat I could fly with them, fly, where I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but far from here.\r\nAnd isn\xe2\x80\x99t that desire sinful? I have here mother, father, home. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI love them? No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t love them, as I should like to love. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndreadful to put that in words, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. Perhaps I am a great\r\nsinner; perhaps that is why I am so sad, why I have no peace. Some hand\r\nseems laid on me, weighing me down, as though I were in prison, and the\r\nwalls would fall on me directly. Why is it others don\xe2\x80\x99t feel this? Whom\r\nshall I love, if I am cold to my own people? It\xe2\x80\x99s clear, papa is right;\r\nhe reproaches me for loving nothing but cats and dogs. I must think\r\nabout that. I pray very little; I must pray.... Ah, I think I should\r\nknow how to love!... I am still shy with Mr. Insarov. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why;\r\nI believe I\xe2\x80\x99m not schoolgirlish generally, and he is so simple and kind.\r\nSometimes he has a very serious face. He can\xe2\x80\x99t give much thought to us.\r\nI feel that, and am ashamed in a way to take up his time. With Andrei\r\nPetrovitch it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a different thing. I am ready to chat with him the\r\nwhole day long. But he too always talks of Insarov. And such terrible\r\nfacts he tells me about him! I saw him in a dream last night with a\r\ndagger in his hand. And he seemed to say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI will kill you and I\r\nwill kill myself!\xe2\x80\x9d What silliness!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, if some one would say to me: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you must do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Being good--isn\xe2\x80\x99t much; doing good... yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the great thing in\r\nlife. But how is one to do good? Oh, if I could learn to control myself!\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I am so often thinking of Mr. Insarov. When he comes\r\nand sits and listens intently, but makes no effort, no exertion himself,\r\nI look at him, and feel pleased, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all, and when he goes, I\r\nalways go over his words, and feel vexed with myself, and upset even. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t tell why. (He speaks French badly and isn\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed of it--I like\r\nthat.) I always think a lot about new people, though. As I talked to\r\nhim, I suddenly was reminded of our butler, Vassily, who rescued an old\r\ncripple out of a hut that was on fire, and was almost killed himself.\r\nPapa called him a brave fellow, mamma gave him five roubles, and I\r\nfelt as though I could fall at his feet. And he had a simple\r\nface--stupid-looking even--and he took to drink later on....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I gave a penny to-day to a beggar woman, and she said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are\r\nyou so sorrowful?\xe2\x80\x9d I never suspected I looked sorrowful. I think it must\r\ncome from being alone, always alone, for better, for worse! There is no\r\none to stretch out a hand to me. Those who come to me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want; and\r\nthose I would choose--pass me by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me to-day; my head is confused,\r\nI want to fall on my knees and beg and pray for mercy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know by\r\nwhom or how, but I feel as if I were being tortured, and inwardly I\r\nam shrieking in revolt; I weep and can\xe2\x80\x99t be quiet.... O my God, subdue\r\nthese outbreaks in me! Thou alone canst aid me, all else is useless; my\r\nmiserable alms-giving, my studies can do nothing, nothing, nothing to\r\nhelp me. I should like to go out as a servant somewhere, really; that\r\nwould do me good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is my youth for, what am I living for, why have I a soul, what is\r\nit all for?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... Insarov, Mr. Insarov--upon my word I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to write--still\r\ninterests me, I should like to know what he has within, in his soul? He\r\nseems so open, so easy to talk to, but I can see nothing. Sometimes he\r\nlooks at me with such searching eyes--or is that my fancy? Paul keeps\r\nteasing me. I am angry with Paul. What does he want? He\xe2\x80\x99s in love with\r\nme... but his love\xe2\x80\x99s no good to me. He\xe2\x80\x99s in love with Zoya too. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nunjust to him; he told me yesterday I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to be unjust by\r\nhalves... that\xe2\x80\x99s true. It\xe2\x80\x99s very horrid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I feel one needs unhappiness, or poverty or sickness, or else one\r\ngets conceited directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... What made Andrei Petrovitch tell me to-day about those two\r\nBulgarians! He told me it as it were with some intention. What have I to\r\ndo with Mr. Insarov? I feel cross with Andrei Petrovitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... I take my pen and don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to begin. How unexpectedly he\r\nbegan to talk to me in the garden to-day! How friendly and confiding\r\nhe was! How quickly it happened! As if we were old, old friends and had\r\nonly just recognised each other. How could I have not understood him\r\nbefore? How near he is to me now! And--what\xe2\x80\x99s so wonderful--I feel ever\r\nso much calmer now. It\xe2\x80\x99s ludicrous; yesterday I was angry with Andrei\r\nPetrovitch, and angry with him, I even called him _Mr. Insarov_, and\r\nto-day... Here at last is a true man; some one one may depend upon. He\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t tell lies; he\xe2\x80\x99s the first man I have met who never tells lies; all\r\nthe others tell lies, everything\xe2\x80\x99s lying. Andrei Petrovitch, dear good\r\nfriend, why do I wrong you? No! Andrei Petrovitch is more learned than\r\nhe is, even, perhaps more intellectual. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, he seems so\r\nsmall beside him. When he speaks of his country he seems taller, and his\r\nface grows handsome, and his voice is like steel, and... no... it seems\r\nas though there were no one in the world before whom he would flinch.\r\nAnd he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t only talk.... he has acted and he will act. I shall ask\r\nhim.... How suddenly he turned to me and smiled!... It\xe2\x80\x99s only brothers\r\nthat smile like that! Ah, how glad I am! When he came the first time, I\r\nnever dreamt that we should so soon get to know each other. And now I am\r\neven pleased that I remained indifferent to him at first. Indifferent?\r\nAm I not indifferent then now?... It\xe2\x80\x99s long since I have felt such\r\ninward peace. I feel so quiet, so quiet. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to write? I\r\nsee him often and that\xe2\x80\x99s all. What more is there to write?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... Paul shuts himself up, Andrei Petrovitch has taken to coming less\r\noften.... poor fellow! I fancy he... But that can never be, though.\r\nI like talking to Andrei Petrovitch; never a word of self, always of\r\nsomething sensible, useful. Very different from Shubin. Shubin\xe2\x80\x99s as fine\r\nas a butterfly, and admires his own finery; which butterflies don\xe2\x80\x99t do.\r\nBut both Shubin and Andrei Petrovitch.... I know what I mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... He enjoys coming to us, I see that. But why? what does he find in\r\nme? It\xe2\x80\x99s true our tastes are alike; he and I, both of us don\xe2\x80\x99t care for\r\npoetry; neither of us knows anything of art. But how much better he\r\nis than I! He is calm, I am in perpetual excitement; he has chosen his\r\npath, his aim--while I--where am I going? where is my home? He is calm,\r\nbut all his thoughts are far away. The time will come, and he will leave\r\nus for ever, will go home, there over the sea. Well? God grant he may!\r\nAny way I shall be glad that I knew him, while he was here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a Russian? No, he could not be Russian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma too likes him; she says: an unassuming young man. Dear mamma! She\r\ndoes not understand him. Paul says nothing; he guessed I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his\r\nhints, but he\xe2\x80\x99s jealous of him. Spiteful boy! And what right has he? Did\r\nI ever... All that\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense! What makes all that come into my head?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange though, that up till now, up to twenty, I have\r\nnever loved any one! I believe that the reason why D.\xe2\x80\x99s (I shall\r\ncall him D.--I like that name Dmitri) soul is so clear, is that he is\r\nentirely given up to his work, his ideal. What has he to trouble about?\r\nWhen any one has utterly... utterly... given himself up, he has little\r\nsorrow, he is not responsible for anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s not _I_ want, but _it_\r\nwants. By the way, he and I both love the same flowers. I picked a rose\r\nthis morning, one leaf fell, he picked it up.... I gave him the whole\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... D. often comes to us. Yesterday he spent the whole evening. He\r\nwants to teach me Bulgarian. I feel happy with him, quite at home, more\r\nthan at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... The days fly past.... I am happy, and somehow discontent and I am\r\nthankful to God, and tears are not far off. Oh these hot bright days!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... I am still light-hearted as before, and only at times, and only a\r\nlittle, sad. I am happy. Am I happy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... It will be long before I forget the expedition yesterday. What\r\nstrange, new, terrible impressions when he suddenly took that great\r\ngiant and flung him like a ball into the water. I was not frightened ...\r\nyet he frightened me. And afterwards--what an angry face, almost cruel!\r\nHow he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will swim out!\xe2\x80\x9d It gave me a shock. So I did not\r\nunderstand him. And afterwards when they all laughed, when I was\r\nlaughing, how I felt for him! He was ashamed, I felt that he was ashamed\r\nbefore me. He told me so afterwards in the carriage in the dark, when I\r\ntried to get a good view of him and was afraid of him. Yes, he is not\r\nto be trifled with, and he is a splendid champion. But why that wicked\r\nlook, those trembling lips, that angry fire in his eyes? Or is it,\r\nperhaps, inevitable? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible to be a man, a hero, and to\r\nremain soft and gentle? \xe2\x80\x9cLife is a coarse business,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me once\r\nlately. I repeated that saying to Andrei Petrovitch; he did not agree\r\nwith D. Which of them is right? But the beginning of that day! How happy\r\nI was, walking beside him, even without speaking. ... But I am glad of\r\nwhat happened. I see that it was quite as it should be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... Restlessness again... I am not quite well.... All these days I have\r\nwritten nothing in this book, because I have had no wish to write. I\r\nfelt, whatever I write, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be what is in my heart. ... And what\r\nis in my heart? I have had a long talk with him, which revealed a great\r\ndeal. He told me his plan (by the way, I know now how he got the wound\r\nin his neck.... Good God! when I think he was actually condemned\r\nto death, that he was only just saved, that he was wounded.... ) He\r\nprophesies war and will be glad of it. And for all that, I never saw D.\r\nso depressed. What can he... he!... be depressed by? Papa arrived home\r\nfrom town and came upon us two. He looked rather queerly at us. Andrei\r\nPetrovitch came; I noticed he had grown very thin and pale. He reproved\r\nme, saying I behave too coldly and inconsiderately to Shubin. I had\r\nutterly forgotten Paul\xe2\x80\x99s existence. I will see him, and try to smooth\r\nover my offence. He is nothing to me now... nor any one else in the\r\nworld. Andrei Petrovitch talked to me in a sort of commiserating way.\r\nWhat does it all mean? Why is everything around me and within me so\r\ndark? I feel as if about me and within me, something mysterious were\r\nhappening, for which I want to find the right word.... I did not sleep\r\nall night; my head aches. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of writing? He went away so\r\nquickly to-day and I wanted to talk to him.... He almost seems to avoid\r\nme. Yes, he avoids me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98... The word is found, light has dawned on me! My God, have pity on\r\nme.... I love him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very day on which Elena had written this last fatal line in\r\nher diary, Insarov was sitting in Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s room, and Bersenyev was\r\nstanding before him with a look of perplexity on his face. Insarov had\r\njust announced his intention of returning to Moscow the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Upon my word!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98Why, the finest part of the summer is\r\njust beginning. What will you do in Moscow? What a sudden decision! Or\r\nhave you had news of some sort?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had no news,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Insarov; \xe2\x80\x98but on thinking things over, I\r\nfind I cannot stop here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can that be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98be so kind... don\xe2\x80\x99t insist, please,\r\nI am very sorry myself to be leaving you, but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev looked at him intently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at last, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s no persuading you. And so, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsettled matter, is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely settled,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Insarov, getting up and going away.\r\n\r\nBersenyev walked about the room, then took his hat and set off for the\r\nStahovs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have something to tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena said to him, directly they were\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, how did you guess?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind; tell me what it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev told her of Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s intention.\r\n\r\nElena turned white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does it mean?\xe2\x80\x99 she articulated with effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Bersenyev, \xe2\x80\x98Dmitri Nikanorovitch does not care\r\nto give reasons for his actions. But I think... let us sit down, Elena\r\nNikolaevna, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very well.... I fancy I can guess what is the\r\nreal cause of this sudden departure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What--what cause?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Elena, and unconsciously she gripped\r\ntightly Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s hand in her chill fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see,\xe2\x80\x99 began Bersenyev, with a pathetic smile, \xe2\x80\x98how can I explain to\r\nyou? I must go back to last spring, to the time when I began to be\r\nmore intimate with Insarov. I used to meet him then at the house of a\r\nrelative, who had a daughter, a very pretty girl I thought that Insarov\r\ncared for her, and I told him so. He laughed, and answered that I was\r\nmistaken, that he was quite heart-whole, but if anything of that sort\r\ndid happen to him, he should run away directly, as he did not want,\r\nin his own words, for the sake of personal feeling, to be false to his\r\ncause and his duty. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Bulgarian,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have no need of\r\na Russian love----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--so--now you----\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Elena. She involuntarily turned away\r\nher head, like a man expecting a blow, but she still held the hand she\r\nhad clutched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and his own voice sank, \xe2\x80\x98I think that what I fancied\r\nthen has really happened now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is--you think--don\xe2\x80\x99t torture me!\xe2\x80\x99 broke suddenly from Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev continued hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x98that Insarov is in love now\r\nwith a Russian girl, and he is resolved to go, according to his word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena clasped his hand still tighter, and her head drooped still lower,\r\nas if she would hide from other eyes the flush of shame which suddenly\r\nblazed over her face and neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Andrei Petrovitch, you are kind as an angel,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but will he\r\ncome to say goodbye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I imagine so; he will be sure to come. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to go\r\naway----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him, tell him----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut here the poor girl broke down; tears rushed streaming from her eyes,\r\nand she ran out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So that\xe2\x80\x99s how she loves him,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bersenyev, as he walked slowly\r\nhome. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think she felt so strongly. I\r\nam kind, she says:\xe2\x80\x99 he pursued his reflections:... \xe2\x80\x98Who can tell what\r\nfeelings, what impulse drove me to tell Elena all that? It was not\r\nkindness; no, not kindness. It was all the accursed desire to make sure\r\nwhether the dagger is really in the wound. I ought to be content.\r\nThey love each other, and I have been of use to them.... The future\r\ngo-between between science and the Russian public Shubin calls me;\r\nit seems as though it had been decreed at my birth that I should be a\r\ngo-between. But if I\xe2\x80\x99m mistaken? No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was bitter for Andrei Petrovitch, and he could not turn his mind to\r\nRaumer.\r\n\r\nThe next day at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock Insarov arrived at the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99. As\r\nthough by express design, there was a visitor in Anna Vassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room at the time, the wife of a neighbouring chief-priest, an\r\nexcellent and worthy woman, though she had had a little unpleasantness\r\nwith the police, because she thought fit, in the hottest part of the\r\nday, to bathe in a lake near the road, along which a certain dignified\r\ngeneral\xe2\x80\x99s family used often to be passing. The presence of an outside\r\nperson was at first even a relief to Elena, from whose face every trace\r\nof colour vanished, directly she heard Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s step; but her heart\r\nsank at the thought that he might go without a word with her alone. He,\r\ntoo, seemed confused, and avoided meeting her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Surely he will not\r\ngo directly,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Elena. Insarov was, in fact, turning to take leave\r\nof Anna Vassilyevna; Elena hastily rose and called him aside to the\r\nwindow. The priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife was surprised, and tried to turn round; but\r\nshe was so tightly laced that her stays creaked at every movement, and\r\nshe stayed where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena hurriedly; \xe2\x80\x98I know what you have come for; Andrei\r\nPetrovitch told me of your intention, but I beg, I entreat you, do not\r\nsay good-bye to us to-day, but come here to-morrow rather earlier, at\r\neleven. I must have a few words with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov bent his head without speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not keep you.... You promise me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Insarov bowed, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lenotchka, come here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anna Vassilyevna, \xe2\x80\x98look, what a charming\r\nreticule.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I worked it myself,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nElena came away from the window.\r\n\r\nInsarov did not stay more than a quarter of an hour at the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nElena watched him secretly. He was restless and ill at ease. As before,\r\nhe did not know where to look, and he went away strangely and suddenly;\r\nhe seemed to vanish.\r\n\r\nSlowly passed that day for Elena; still more slowly dragged on the long,\r\nlong night. Elena sat on her bed, her arms clasping her knees, and her\r\nhead laid on them; then she walked to the window, pressed her burning\r\nforehead against the cold glass, and thought and thought, going over and\r\nover the same thoughts till she was exhausted. Her heart seemed turned\r\nto stone, she did not feel it, but the veins in her head throbbed\r\npainfully, her hair stifled her, and her lips were dry. \xe2\x80\x98He will come...\r\nhe did not say good-bye to mamma... he will not deceive me... Can Andrei\r\nPetrovitch have been right? It cannot be... He didn\xe2\x80\x99t promise to come\r\nin words... Can I have parted from him for ever----?\xe2\x80\x99 Those were the\r\nthoughts that never left her, literally never left her; they did not\r\ncome and come again; they were for ever turning like a mist moving about\r\nin her brain. \xe2\x80\x98He loves me!\xe2\x80\x99 suddenly flashed through her, setting her\r\nwhole nature on fire, and she gazed fixedly into the darkness; a secret\r\nsmile parted her lips, seen by none, but she quickly shook her head,\r\nand clasped her hands behind her neck, and again her former thought hung\r\nlike a mist about her. Before morning she undressed and went to bed,\r\nbut she could not sleep. The first fiery ray of sunlight fell upon her\r\nroom... \xe2\x80\x98Oh, if he loves me!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried suddenly, and unabashed by the\r\nlight shining on her, she opened wide her arms... She got up, dressed,\r\nand went down. No one in the house was awake yet. She went into the\r\ngarden, but in the garden it was peaceful, green, and fresh; the birds\r\nchirped so confidingly, and the flowers peeped out so gaily that she\r\ncould not bear it. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98if it is true, no blade of grass\r\nis happy as I. But is it true?\xe2\x80\x99 She went back to her room and, to kill\r\ntime, she began changing her dress. But everything slipped out of her\r\nhands, and she was still sitting half-dressed before her looking-glass\r\nwhen she was summoned to morning tea. She went down; her mother noticed\r\nher pallor, but only said: \xe2\x80\x98How interesting you are to-day,\xe2\x80\x99 and taking\r\nher in in a glance, she added: \xe2\x80\x98How well that dress suits you; you\r\nshould always put it on when you want to make an impression on any one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nElena made no reply, and sat down in a corner. Meanwhile it struck nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock; there were only two haurs now till eleven. Elena tried to read,\r\nthen to sew, then to read again, then she vowed to herself to walk a\r\nhundred times up and down one alley, and paced it a hundred times; then\r\nfor a long time she watched Anna Vassilyevna laying out the cards for\r\npatience... and looked at the clock; it was not yet ten. Shubin came\r\ninto the drawing-room. She tried to talk to him, and begged his pardon,\r\nwhat for she did not know herself.... Every word she uttered did not\r\ncost her effort exactly, but roused a kind of amazement in herself.\r\nShubin bent over her. She expected ridicule, raised her eyes, and saw\r\nbefore her a sorrowful and sympathetic face.... She smiled at this face.\r\nShubin, too, smiled at her without speaking, and gently left her. She\r\ntried to keep him, but could not at once remember what to call him. At\r\nlast it struck eleven. Then she began to wait, to wait, and to listen.\r\nShe could do nothing now; she ceased even to think. Her heart was\r\nstirred into life again, and began beating louder and louder, and\r\nstrange, to say, the time seemed flying by. A quarter of an hour passed,\r\nthen half an hour; a few minutes more, as Elena thought, had passed,\r\nwhen suddenly she started; the clock had struck not twelve, but one. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nis not coming; he is going away without saying good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99... The blood\r\nrushed to her head with this thought. She felt that she was gasping\r\nfor breath, that she was on the point of sobbing.... She ran to her own\r\nroom, and fell with her face in her clasped hands on to the bed.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour she lay motionless; the tears flowed through her\r\nfingers on to the pillow. Suddenly she raised herself and sat up,\r\nsomething strange was passing in her, her face changed, her wet eyes\r\ngrew dry and shining, her brows were bent and her lips compressed.\r\nAnother half-hour passed. Elena, for the last time, strained her ears to\r\nlisten: was not that the familiar voice floating up to her? She got\r\nup, put on her hat and gloves, threw a cape over her shoulders, and,\r\nslipping unnoticed out of the house, she went with swift steps along the\r\nroad leading to Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nElena walked with her head bent and her eyes fixed straight before her.\r\nShe feared nothing, she considered nothing; she wanted to see Insarov\r\nonce more. She went on, not noticing that the sun had long ago\r\ndisappeared behind heavy black clouds, that the wind was roaring by\r\ngusts in the trees and blowing her dress about her, that the dust had\r\nsuddenly risen and was flying in a cloud along the road.... Large drops\r\nof rain were falling, she did not even notice it; but it fell faster\r\nand heavier, there were flashes of lightning and peals of thunder. Elena\r\nstood still looking round.... Fortunately for her, there was a little\r\nold broken-down chapel that had been built over a disused well not far\r\nfrom the place where she was overtaken by the storm. She ran to it\r\nand got under the low roof. The rain fell in torrents; the sky was\r\ncompletely overcast. In dumb despair Elena stared at the thick network\r\nof fast-falling drops. Her last hope of getting a sight of Insarov\r\nwas vanishing. A little old beggar-woman came into the chapel, shook\r\nherself, said with a curtsy: \xe2\x80\x98Out of the rain, good lady,\xe2\x80\x99 and with many\r\nsighs and groans sat down on a ledge near the well. Elena put her hand\r\ninto her pocket; the old woman noticed this action and a light came into\r\nher face, yellow and wrinkled now, though once handsome. \xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\r\ndear gracious lady,\xe2\x80\x99 she was beginning. There happened to be no purse in\r\nElena\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, but the old woman was still holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no money, grannie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98but here, take this, it will be\r\nof use for something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave her her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O-oh, my pretty lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said the beggar, \xe2\x80\x98what do you give your\r\nhandkerchief to me for? For a wedding-present to my grandchild when\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s married? God reward you for your goodness!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA peal of thunder was heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord Jesus Christ,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered the beggar-woman, and she crossed herself\r\nthree times. \xe2\x80\x98Why, haven\xe2\x80\x99t I seen you before,\xe2\x80\x99 she added after a brief\r\npause. \xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you give me alms in Christ\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena looked more attentively at the old woman and recognised her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, grannie,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, \xe2\x80\x98wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it you asked me why I was so\r\nsorrowful?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, darling, yes. I fancied I knew you. And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve a\r\nheart-ache still. You seem in trouble now. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your handkerchief,\r\ntoo, wet from tears to be sure. Oh, you young people, you all have the\r\nsame sorrow, a terrible woe it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What sorrow, grannie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my good young lady, you can\xe2\x80\x99t deceive an old woman like me. I know\r\nwhat your heart is heavy over; your sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s not an uncommon one. Sure,\r\nI have been young too, darling. I have been through that trouble too.\r\nYes. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something, for your goodness to me; you\xe2\x80\x99ve won\r\na good man, not a light of love, you cling to him alone; cling to him\r\nstronger than death. If it comes off, it comes off,--if not, it\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Yes. Why are you wondering at me? I\xe2\x80\x99m a fortune-teller.\r\nThere, I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry away your sorrow with your handkerchief. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry it\r\naway, and it\xe2\x80\x99s over. See the rain\xe2\x80\x99s less; you wait a little longer. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wet. Remember, darling; you had a sorrow,\r\nthe sorrow has flown, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no memory of it. Good Lord, have mercy\r\non us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe beggar-woman got up from the edge of the well, went out of\r\nthe chapel, and stole off on her way. Elena stared after her in\r\nbewilderment. \xe2\x80\x98What does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured involuntarily.\r\n\r\nThe rain grew less and less, the sun peeped out for an instant. Elena\r\nwas just preparing to leave her shelter.... Suddenly, ten paces from the\r\nchapel, she saw Insarov. Wrapt in a cloak he was walking along the very\r\nroad by which Elena had come; he seemed to be hurrying home.\r\n\r\nShe clasped the old rail of the steps for support, and tried to call to\r\nhim, but her voice failed her... Insarov had already passed by without\r\nraising his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri Nikanorovitch!\xe2\x80\x99 she said at last.\r\n\r\nInsarov stopped abruptly, looked round.... For the first minute he\r\ndid not know Elena, but he went up to her at once. \xe2\x80\x98You! you here!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried.\r\n\r\nShe walked back in silence into the chapel. Insarov followed Elena. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\nShe was still silent, and only gazed upon him with a strange, slow,\r\ntender look. He dropped his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have come from our house?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No... not from your house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Elena, and she tried to smile. \xe2\x80\x98Is that how you keep your\r\npromises? I have been expecting you ever since the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I made no promise yesterday, if you remember, Elena Nikolaevna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAgain Elena faintly smiled, and she passed her hand over her face. Both\r\nface and hands were very white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You meant, then, to go away without saying good-bye to us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Insarov in a surly, thick voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? After our friendship, after the talks, after everything.... Then\r\nif I had not met you here by chance.\xe2\x80\x99 (Elena\xe2\x80\x99s voice began to break, and\r\nshe paused an instant)... \xe2\x80\x98you would have gone away like that, without\r\neven shaking hands for the last time, and you would not have cared?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov turned away. \xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevnas don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that, please.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not over happy as it is. Believe me, my decision has cost me great\r\neffort. If you knew----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena interposed with dismay, \xe2\x80\x98why you are\r\ngoing.... It seems it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. It seems we must part. You would not\r\nwound your friends without good reason. But, can friends part like this?\r\nAnd we are friends, aren\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Elena. Her cheeks were overspread with a faint flush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s just why I am going away--because we are not friends. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforce me into saying what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say, and what I won\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You used to be so open with me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena rather reproachfully. \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nyou remember?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to be able to be open, then I had nothing to conceal; but\r\nnow----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now?\xe2\x80\x99 queried Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now... now I must go away. Goodbye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf, at that instant, Insarov had lifted his eyes to Elena, he would have\r\nseen that her face grew brighter and brighter as he frowned and looked\r\ngloomy; but he kept his eyes obstinately fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, good-bye, Dmitri Nikanorovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 she began. \xe2\x80\x98But at least, since\r\nwe have met, give me your hand now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov was stretching out his hand. \xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t even do that,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid, and turned away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99 And he moved away to the entrance of the\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a little longer,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena. \xe2\x80\x98You seem afraid of me. But I am\r\nbraver than you,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, a faint tremor passing suddenly over her\r\nwhole body. \xe2\x80\x98I can tell you... shall I?... how it was you found me here?\r\nDo you know where I was going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov looked in bewilderment at Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was going to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena hid her face. \xe2\x80\x98You mean to force me to say that I love you,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nwhispered. \xe2\x80\x98There, I have said it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Insarov.\r\n\r\nShe took his hands, looked at him, and fell on his breast.\r\n\r\nHe held her close to him, and said nothing. There was no need for him\r\nto tell her he loved her. From that cry alone, from the instant\r\ntransformation of the whole man, from the heaving of the breast to which\r\nshe clung so confidingly, from the touch of his finger tips in her hair,\r\nElena could feel that she was loved. He did not speak, and she needed\r\nno words. \xe2\x80\x98He is here, he loves me... what need of more?\xe2\x80\x99 The peace of\r\nperfect bliss, the peace of the harbour reached after storm, of the end\r\nattained, that heavenly peace which gives significance and beauty even\r\nto death, filled her with its divine flood. She desired nothing, for she\r\nhad gained all. \xe2\x80\x98O my brother, my friend, my dear one!\xe2\x80\x99 her lips were\r\nwhispering, while she did not know whose was this heart, his or her own,\r\nwhich beat so blissfully, and melted against her bosom.\r\n\r\nHe stood motionless, folding in his strong embrace the young life\r\nsurrendered to him; he felt against his heart this new, infinitely\r\nprecious burden; a passion of tenderness, of gratitude unutterable, was\r\ncrumbling his hard will to dust, and tears unknown till now stood in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nShe did not weep; she could only repeat, \xe2\x80\x98O my friend, my brother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you will follow me everywhere?\xe2\x80\x99 he said to her, a quarter of an hour\r\nlater, still enfolding her and keeping her close to him in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everywhere, to the ends of the earth. Where you are, I will be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you are not deceiving yourself, you know your parents will never\r\nconsent to our marriage?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive myself; I know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know that I\xe2\x80\x99m poor--almost a beggar.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I\xe2\x80\x99m not a Russian, that it won\xe2\x80\x99t be my fate to live in Russia,\r\nthat you will have to break all your ties with your country, with your\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know, I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know, too, that I have given myself up to a difficult, thankless\r\ncause, that I... that we shall have to expose ourselves not to dangers\r\nonly, but to privation, humiliation, perhaps----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know, I know all--I love you----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you will have to give up all you are accustomed to, that out there\r\nalone among strangers, you will be forced perhaps to work----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand on his lips. \xe2\x80\x98I love you, my dear one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe began hotly kissing her slender, rosy hand. Elena did not draw it\r\naway from his lips, and with a kind of childish delight, with smiling\r\ncuriosity, watched how he covered with kisses, first the palm, then the\r\nfingers....\r\n\r\nAll at once she blushed and hid her face upon his breast.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her head tenderly and looked steadily into her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Welcome,\r\nthen, my wife, before God and men!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later, Elena, with her hat in one hand, her cape in the other,\r\nwalked slowly into the drawing-room of the villa. Her hair was in slight\r\ndisorder; on each cheek was to be seen a small bright spot of colour,\r\nthe smile would not leave her lips, her eyes were nearly shutting and\r\nhalf hidden under the lids; they, too, were smiling. She could scarcely\r\nmove for weariness, and this weariness was pleasant to her; everything,\r\nindeed, was pleasant to her. Everything seemed sweet and friendly to\r\nher. Uvar Ivanovitch was sitting at the window; she went up to him, laid\r\nher hand on his shoulder, stretched a little, and involuntarily, as it\r\nseemed, she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 he inquired, astonished.\r\n\r\nShe did not know what to say. She felt inclined to kiss Uvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How he splashed!\xe2\x80\x99 she explained at last.\r\n\r\nBut Uvar Ivanovitch did not stir a muscle, and continued to look with\r\namazement at Elena. She dropped her hat and cape on to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Uvar Ivanovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I am sleepy and tired,\xe2\x80\x99 and again she\r\nlaughed and sank into a low chair near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted Uvar Ivanovitch, flourishing his fingers, \xe2\x80\x98then you\r\nought--yes----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena was looking round her and thinking, \xe2\x80\x98From all this I soon must\r\npart... and strange--I have no dread, no doubt, no regret.... No, I am\r\nsorry for mamma.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the little chapel rose again before her mind,\r\nagain her voice was echoing in it, and she felt his arms about her.\r\nJoyously, though faintly, her heart fluttered; weighed down by the\r\nlanguor of happiness. The old beggar-woman recurred to her mind. \xe2\x80\x98She\r\ndid really bear away my sorrow,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, how happy I am! how\r\nundeservedly! how soon!\xe2\x80\x99 If she had let herself go in the least she\r\nwould have melted into sweet, endless tears. She could only restrain\r\nthem by laughing. Whatever attitude she fell into seemed to her the\r\neasiest, most comfortable possible; she felt as if she were being rocked\r\nto sleep. All her movements were slow and soft; what had become of her\r\nawkwardness, her haste? Zoya came in; Elena decided that she had never\r\nseen a more charming little face; Anna Vassilyevna came in; Elena felt a\r\npang--but with what tenderness she embraced her mother and kissed her on\r\nthe forehead near the hair, already slightly grey! Then she went away to\r\nher own room; how everything smiled upon her there! With what a sense\r\nof shamefaced triumph and tranquillity she sat down on her bed--the very\r\nbed on which, only three hours ago, she had spent such bitter moments!\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And yet, even then, I knew he loved me,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98even before...\r\nAh, no! it\xe2\x80\x99s a sin. You are my wife,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered, hiding her face in\r\nher hands and falling on her knees.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, she grew more thoughtful. Sadness came upon her at\r\nthe thought that she would not soon see Insarov. He could not without\r\nawakening suspicion remain at Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s, and so this was what he and\r\nElena had resolved on. Insarov was to return to Moscow and to come over\r\nto visit them twice before the autumn; on her side she promised to write\r\nhim letters, and, if it were possible, to arrange a meeting with him\r\nsomewhere near Kuntsov. She went down to the drawing-room to tea, and\r\nfound there all the household and Shubin, who looked at her sharply\r\ndirectly she came in; she tried to talk to him in a friendly way as of\r\nold, but she dreaded his penetration, she was afraid of herself. She\r\nfelt sure that there was good reason for his having left her alone\r\nfor more than a fortnight. Soon Bersenyev arrived, and gave Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespects to Anna Vassilyevna with an apology for having gone back to\r\nMoscow without calling to take leave of her. Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s name was for the\r\nfirst time during the day pronounced before Elena. She felt that she\r\nreddened; she realised at the same time that she ought to express regret\r\nat the sudden departure of such a pleasant acquaintance; but she could\r\nnot force herself to hypocrisy, and continued to sit without stirring\r\nor speaking, while Anna Vassilyevna sighed and lamented. Elena tried to\r\nkeep near Bersenyev; she was not afraid of him, though he even knew\r\npart of her secret; she was safe under his wing from Shubin, who still\r\npersisted in staring at her--not mockingly but attentively. Bersenyev,\r\ntoo, was thrown into perplexity during the evening: he had expected to\r\nsee Elena more gloomy. Happily for her, an argument sprang up about art\r\nbetween him and Shubin; she moved apart and heard their voices as it\r\nwere through a dream. By degrees, not only they, but the whole room,\r\neverything surrounding her, seemed like a dream--everything: the samovar\r\non the table, and Uvar Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s short waistcoat, and Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s polished\r\nfinger-nails, and the portrait in oils of the Grand Duke Constantine\r\nPavlovitch on the wall; everything retreated, everything was wrapped\r\nin mist, everything ceased to exist. Only she felt sorry for them all.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are they living for?\xe2\x80\x99 she thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sleepy, Lenotchka?\xe2\x80\x99 her mother asked her. She did not hear the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A half untrue insinuation, do you say?\xe2\x80\x99 These words, sharply uttered by\r\nShubin, suddenly awakened Elena\xe2\x80\x99s attention. \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nwhole sting lies in that. A true insinuation makes one wretched--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunchristian--and to an untrue insinuation a man is indifferent--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstupid, but at a half true one he feels vexed and impatient. For\r\ninstance, if I say that Elena Nikolaevna is in love with one of us, what\r\nsort of insinuation would that be, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Monsieur Paul,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98I should like to show myself vexed,\r\nbut really I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I am so tired.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go to bed?\xe2\x80\x99 observed Anna Vassilyevna, who was always\r\ndrowsy in the evening herself, and consequently always eager to send\r\nthe others to bed. \xe2\x80\x98Say good-night to me, and go in God\xe2\x80\x99s name; Andrei\r\nPetrovitch will excuse you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena kissed her mother, bowed to all and went away. Shubin accompanied\r\nher to the door. \xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered to her in the doorway,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you trample on Monsieur Paul, you mercilessly walk over him, but\r\nMonsieur Paul blesses you and your little feet, and the slippers on your\r\nlittle feet, and the soles of your little slippers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena shrugged her shoulders, reluctantly held out her hand to him--not\r\nthe one Insarov had kissed--and going up to her room, at once undressed,\r\ngot into bed, and fell asleep. She slept a deep, unstirring sleep, as\r\neven children rarely sleep--the sleep of a child convalescent after\r\nsickness, when its mother sits near its cradle and watches it, and\r\nlistens to its breathing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to my room for a minute,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin said to Bersenyev, directly the\r\nlatter had taken leave of Anna Vassilyevna: \xe2\x80\x98I have something to show\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev followed him to his attic. He was surprised to see a number of\r\nstudies, statuettes, and busts, covered with damp cloths, set about in\r\nall the corners of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well I see you have been at work in earnest,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed to Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One must do something,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered. \xe2\x80\x98If one thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do, one must\r\ntry another. However, like a true Corsican, I am more concerned with\r\nrevenge than with pure art. _Trema, Bisanzia!_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, wait a minute. Deign to look this way, gracious friend and\r\nbenefactor, my vengeance number one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin uncovered one figure, and Bersenyev saw a capital bust of\r\nInsarov, an excellent likeness. The features of the face had been\r\ncorrectly caught by Shubin to the minutest detail, and he had given him\r\na fine expression, honest, generous, and bold.\r\n\r\nBersenyev went into raptures over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s simply exquisite!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. \xe2\x80\x98I congratulate you. You must\r\nsend it to the exhibition! Why do you call that magnificent work your\r\nvengeance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because, sir, I intended to offer this magnificent work as you call it\r\nto Elena Nikolaevna on her name day. Do you see the allegory? We are not\r\nblind, we see what goes on about us, but we are gentlemen, my dear sir,\r\nand we take our revenge like gentlemen.... But here,\xe2\x80\x99 added Shubin,\r\nuncovering another figure, \xe2\x80\x98as the artist according to modern aesthetic\r\nprinciples enjoys the enviable privilege of embodying in himself every\r\nsort of baseness which he can turn into a gem of creative art, we in\r\nthe production of this gem, number two, have taken vengeance not as\r\ngentlemen, but simply _en canaille_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe deftly drew off the cloth, and displayed to Bersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s eyes a\r\nstatuette in Dantan\xe2\x80\x99s style, also of Insarov. Anything cleverer and more\r\nspiteful could not be imagined. The young Bulgarian was represented as\r\na ram standing on his hind-legs, butting forward with his horns. Dull\r\nsolemnity and aggressiveness, obstinacy, clumsiness and narrowness were\r\nsimply printed on the visage of the \xe2\x80\x98sire of the woolly flock,\xe2\x80\x99 and yet\r\nthe likeness to Insarov was so striking that Bersenyev could not help\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? is it amusing?\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Do you recognise the hero? Do you\r\nadvise me to send it too to the exhibition? That, my dear fellow, I\r\nintend as a present for myself on my own name day.... Your honour will\r\npermit me to play the fool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Shubin gave three little leaps, kicking himself behind with his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\nBersenyev picked up the cloth off the floor--and threw it over the\r\nstatuette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you, magnanimous\xe2\x80\x99--began Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98Who the devil was it in history\r\nwas so particularly magnanimous? Well, never mind! And now,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued, with melancholy triumph, uncovering a third rather large mass\r\nof clay, \xe2\x80\x98you shall behold something which will show you the humility\r\nand discernment of your friend. You will realise that he, like a true\r\nartist again, feels the need and the use of self-castigation. Behold!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cloth was lifted and Bersenyev saw two heads, modelled side by side\r\nand close as though growing together.... He did not at once know what\r\nwas the subject, but looking closer, he recognised in one of them\r\nAnnushka, in the other Shubin himself. They were, however, rather\r\ncaricatures than portraits. Annushka was represented as a handsome fat\r\ngirl with a low forehead, eyes lost in layers of fat, and a saucily\r\nturned-up nose. Her thick lips had an insolent curve; her whole\r\nface expressed sensuality, carelessness, and boldness, not without\r\ngoodnature. Himself Shubin had modelled as a lean emaciated rake, with\r\nsunken cheeks, his thin hair hanging in weak wisps about his face, a\r\nmeaningless expression in his dim eyes, and his nose sharp and thin as a\r\ndead man\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBersenyev turned away with disgust. \xe2\x80\x98A nice pair, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they, my dear\r\nfellow?\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin; \xe2\x80\x98won\xe2\x80\x99t you graciously compose a suitable title?\r\nFor the first two I have already thought of titles. On the bust shall be\r\ninscribed: \xe2\x80\x9cA hero resolving to liberate his country.\xe2\x80\x9d On the statuette:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out, sausage-eating Germans!\xe2\x80\x9d And for this work what do you think\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cThe future of the artist Pavel Yakovlitch Shubin?\xe2\x80\x9d Will that do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave off,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98Was it worth while to waste your time\r\non such a ----\xe2\x80\x99 He could not at once fix on a suitable word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Disgusting thing, you mean? No, my dear fellow, excuse me, if anything\r\nought to go to the exhibition, it\xe2\x80\x99s that group.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s simply disgusting,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98And besides, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnonsense. You have absolutely no such degrading tendencies to which,\r\nunhappily, our artists have such a frequent bent. You have simply\r\nlibelled yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin gloomily. \xe2\x80\x98I have none of them, and\r\nif they come upon me, the fault is all one person\xe2\x80\x99s. Do you know,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe added, tragically knitting his brows, \xe2\x80\x98that I have been trying\r\ndrinking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have, by God,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Shubin; and suddenly grinning and\r\nbrightening,--\xe2\x80\x98but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, my dear boy, the stuff sticks in my\r\nthroat, and my head afterwards is a perfect drum. The great Lushtchihin\r\nhimself--Harlampy Lushtchihin--the greatest drunkard in Moscow, and a\r\nGreat Russian drunkard too, declared there was nothing to be made of me.\r\nIn his words, the bottle does not speak to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev was just going to knock the group over but Shubin stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, my dear boy, don\xe2\x80\x99t smash it; it will serve as a lesson, a\r\nscare-crow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, I will spare your scarecrow then,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. And\r\nnow, \xe2\x80\x98Long live eternal true art!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Long live true art!\xe2\x80\x99 put in Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98By art the good is better and the\r\nbad is not all loss!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe friends shook hands warmly and parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nElena\xe2\x80\x99s first sensation on awakening was one of happy consternation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible? Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked herself, and her heart\r\ngrew faint with happiness. Recollections came rushing on her... she was\r\noverwhelmed by them. Then again she was enfolded by the blissful peace\r\nof triumph. But in the course of the morning, Elena gradually became\r\npossessed by a spirit of unrest, and for the remainder of the day she\r\nfelt listless and weary. It was true she knew now what she wanted, but\r\nthat made it no easier for her. That never-to-be forgotten meeting had\r\ncast her for ever out of the old groove; she was no longer at the same\r\nstandpoint, she was far away, and yet everything went on about her\r\nin its accustomed order, everything pursued its own course as though\r\nnothing were changed; the old life moved on its old way, reckoning on\r\nElena\xe2\x80\x99s interest and co-operation as of old. She tried to begin a letter\r\nto Insarov, but that too was a failure; the words came on to paper\r\neither lifeless or false. Her diary she had put an end to by drawing a\r\nthick stroke under the last line. That was the past, and every thought,\r\nall her soul, was turned now to the future. Her heart was heavy. To sit\r\nwith her mother who suspected nothing, to listen to her, answer her and\r\ntalk to her, seemed to Elena something wicked; she felt the presence of\r\na kind of falseness in her, she suffered though she had nothing to blush\r\nfor; more than once an almost irresistible desire sprang up in her\r\nheart to tell everything without reserve, whatever might come of it\r\nafterwards. \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98did not Dmitri take me away then, from\r\nthat little chapel, wherever he wanted to go? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he tell me I was\r\nhis wife before God? What am I here for?\xe2\x80\x99 She suddenly began to feel shy\r\nof every one, even of Uvar Ivanovitch, who was flourishing his fingers\r\nin more perplexity than ever. Now everything about her seemed neither\r\nsweet nor friendly, nor even a dream, but, like a nightmare, lay,\r\nan immovable dead load, on her heart; seeming to reproach her and be\r\nindignant with her, and not to care to know about her....\xe2\x80\x99You are ours\r\nin spite of everything,\xe2\x80\x99 she seemed to hear. Even her poor pets, her\r\nill-used birds and animals looked at her--so at least she fancied--with\r\nsuspicion and hostility. She felt conscience-stricken and ashamed of\r\nher feelings. \xe2\x80\x98This is my home after all,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought, \xe2\x80\x98my family, my\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x99... \xe2\x80\x98No, it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer your country, nor your family,\xe2\x80\x99 another\r\nvoice affirmed within her. Terror was overmastering her, and she was\r\nvexed with her own feebleness. The trial was only beginning and she was\r\nlosing patience already... Was this what she had promised?\r\n\r\nShe did not soon gain control of herself. But a week passed and then\r\nanother.... Elena became a little calmer, and grew used to her new\r\nposition. She wrote two little notes to Insarov, and carried them\r\nherself to the post: she could not for anything--through shame and\r\nthrough pride--have brought herself to confide in a maid. She was\r\nalready beginning to expect him in person.... But instead of Insarov,\r\none fine morning Nikolai Artemyevitch made his appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one in the house of the retired lieutenant of guards, Stahov, had\r\never seen him so sour, and at the same time so self-confident and\r\nimportant as on that day. He walked into the drawing-room in his\r\novercoat and hat, with long deliberate stride, stamping with his heels;\r\nhe approached the looking-glass and took a long look at himself,\r\nshaking his head and biting his lips with imperturbable severity. Anna\r\nVassilyevna met him with obvious agitation and secret delight (she never\r\nmet him otherwise); he did not even take off his hat, nor greet her, and\r\nin silence gave Elena his doe-skin glove to kiss. Anna Vassilyevna began\r\nquestioning him about the progress of his cure; he made her no reply.\r\nUvar Ivanovitch made his appearance; he glanced at him and said, \xe2\x80\x98bah!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe usually behaved coldly and haughtily to Uvar Ivanovitch, though\r\nhe acknowledged in him \xe2\x80\x98traces of the true Stahov blood.\xe2\x80\x99 Almost all\r\nRussian families of the nobility are convinced, as is well known, of the\r\nexistence of exceptional hereditary characteristics, peculiar to them\r\nalone; we have more than once heard discussions \xe2\x80\x98among ourselves\xe2\x80\x99 of the\r\nPodsalaskinsky \xe2\x80\x98noses,\xe2\x80\x99 and the \xe2\x80\x98Perepreyevsky\xe2\x80\x99 necks. Zoya came in and\r\nsat down facing Nikolai Artemyevitch. He grunted, sank into an armchair,\r\nasked for coffee, and only then took off his hat. Coffee was brought\r\nhim; he drank a cup, and looking at everybody in turn, he growled\r\nbetween his teeth, \xe2\x80\x98_Sortes, s\xe2\x80\x99il vous pla\xc3\xaet_,\xe2\x80\x99 and turning to his wife\r\nhe added, \xe2\x80\x98_et vous, madame, restez, je vous prie_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey all left the room, except Anna Vassilyevna. Her head was trembling\r\nwith agitation. The solemnity of Nikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s preparations\r\nimpressed her. She was expecting something extraordinary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, directly the door was closed.\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch flung an indifferent glance at Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing special; what a way you have of assuming the air of a victim at\r\nonce!\xe2\x80\x99 he began, quite needlessly dropping the corners of his mouth at\r\nevery word. \xe2\x80\x98I only want to forewarn you that we shall have a new guest\r\ndining here to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kurnatovsky, Yegor Andreyevitch. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. The head secretary\r\nin the senate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is to dine with us to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And was it only to tell me this that you made every one go away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch again flung a glance--this time one of irony--at\r\nAnna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does that surprise you? Defer your surprise a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe ceased speaking. Anna Vassilyevna too was silent for a little time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could have wished----\xe2\x80\x99 she was beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you have always looked on me as an \xe2\x80\x9cimmoral\xe2\x80\x9d man,\xe2\x80\x99 began Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Anna Vassilyevna, astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And very likely you are right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to deny that I have in\r\nfact sometimes given you just grounds for dissatisfaction\xe2\x80\x99 (\xe2\x80\x9cmy greys!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n flashed through Anna Vassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s head), \xe2\x80\x98though you must\r\nyourself allow, that in the condition, as you are aware, of your\r\nconstitution----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I make no complaint against you, Nikolai Artemyevitch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_C\xe2\x80\x99est possible_. In any case, I have no intention of justifying\r\nmyself. Time will justify me. But I regard it as my duty to prove to you\r\nthat I understand my duties, and know how to care for--for the welfare\r\nof the family entrusted--entrusted to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of all this?\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna was thinking.\r\n(She could not guess that the preceding evening at the English club\r\na discussion had arisen in a corner of the smoking-room as to the\r\nincapacity of Russians to make speeches. \xe2\x80\x98Which of us can speak? Mention\r\nany one!\xe2\x80\x99 one of the disputants had exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Well, Stahov, for\r\ninstance,\xe2\x80\x99 had answered the other, pointing to Nikolai Artemyevitch, who\r\nstood up on the spot almost squealing with delight.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For instance,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch, \xe2\x80\x98my daughter Elena. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou consider that the time has come for her to take a decisive step\r\nalong the path--to be married, I mean to say. All these intellectual\r\nand philanthropic pursuits are all very well, but only up to a certain\r\npoint, up to a certain age. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for her to drop her mistiness, to\r\nget out of the society of all these artists, scholars, and Montenegrins,\r\nand do like everybody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How am I to understand you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if you will kindly listen,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Nikolai Artemyevitch, still\r\nwith the same dropping of the corners of his lips, \xe2\x80\x98I will tell you\r\nplainly, without beating about the bush. I have made acquaintance, I\r\nhave become intimate with this young man, Mr. Kurnatovsky, in the hope\r\nof having him for a son-in-law. I venture to think that when you see\r\nhim, you will not accuse me of partiality or precipitate judgment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(Nikolai Artemyevitch was admiring his own eloquence as he talked.) \xe2\x80\x98Of\r\nexcellent education--educated in the highest legal college--excellent\r\nmanners, thirty-three years old, and upper-secretary, a councillor, and\r\na Stanislas cross on his neck. You, I hope, will do me the justice to\r\nallow that I do not belong to the number of those _p\xc3\xa8res de famille_\r\nwho are mad for position; but you yourself told me that Elena Nikolaevna\r\nlikes practical business men; Yegor Andreyevitch is in the first place\r\na business man; now on the other side, my daughter has a weakness for\r\ngenerous actions; so let me tell you that Yegor Andreyevitch, directly\r\nhe had attained the possibility--you understand me--the possibility\r\nof living without privation on his salary, at once gave up the yearly\r\nincome assigned him by his father, for the benefit of his brothers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is his father?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His father? His father is a man well-known in his own line, of the\r\nhighest moral character, _un vrai sto\xc3\xafcien_, a retired major, I think,\r\noverseer of all the estates of the Count B----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 observed Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! why ah?\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Nikolai Artemyevitch. \xe2\x80\x98Can you be infected with\r\nprejudice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I said nothing----\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna was beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you said, ah!--However that may be, I have thought it well to\r\nacquaint you with my way of thinking; and I venture to think--I venture\r\nto hope Mr. Kurnatovsky will be received _\xc3\xa0 bras ouverts_. He is no\r\nMontenegrin vagrant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course; I need only call Vanka the cook and order a few extra\r\ndishes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are aware that I will not enter into that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch; and he got up, put on his hat, and whistling (he had heard\r\nsome one say that whistling was only permissible in a country villa and\r\na riding court) went out for a stroll in the garden. Shubin watched him\r\nout of the little window of his lodge, and in silence put out his tongue\r\nat him.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes to four, a hackney-carriage drove up to the steps of the\r\nStahovs\xe2\x80\x99s villa, and a man, still young, of prepossessing appearance,\r\nsimply and elegantly dressed, stepped out of it and sent up his name.\r\nThis was Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky.\r\n\r\nThis was what, among other things, Elena wrote next day to Insarov:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Congratulate me, dear Dmitri, I have a suitor. He dined with us\r\nyesterday: papa made his acquaintance at the English club, I fancy, and\r\ninvited him. Of course he did not come yesterday as a suitor. But good\r\nmamma, to whom papa had made known his hopes, whispered in my ear\r\nwhat this guest was. His name is Yegor Andreyevitch Kurnatovsky; he\r\nis upper-secretary to the Senate. I will first describe to you his\r\nappearance. He is of medium height, shorter than you, and a good figure;\r\nhis features are regular, he is close-cropped, and wears large whiskers.\r\nHis eyes are rather small (like yours), brown, and quick; he has a flat\r\nwide mouth; in his eyes and on his lips there is a perpetual sort of\r\nofficial smile; it seems to be always on duty there. He behaves very\r\nsimply and speaks precisely, and everything about him is precise; he\r\nmoves, laughs, and eats as though he were doing a duty. \xe2\x80\x9cHow carefully\r\nshe has studied him!\xe2\x80\x9d you are thinking, perhaps, at this minute. Yes;\r\nso as to be able to describe him to you. And besides, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t study\r\nher suitor! There\xe2\x80\x99s something of iron in him--and dull and empty at the\r\nsame time--and honest; they say he is really very honest. You, too,\r\nare made of iron; but not like this man. At dinner he sat next me, and\r\nfacing us sat Shubin. At first the conversation turned on commercial\r\nundertakings; they say he is very clever in business matters, and\r\nwas almost throwing up his government post to take charge of a large\r\nmanufacturing business. Pity he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it! Then Shubin began to talk\r\nabout the theatre; Mr. Kurnatovsky declared and--I must confess--without\r\nfalse modesty, that he has no ideas about art. That reminded me of\r\nyou--but I thought; no, Dmitri and I are ignorant of art in a very\r\ndifferent way though. This man seemed to mean, \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of it,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s quite superfluous, still it may be admitted in a well-ordered\r\nstate.\xe2\x80\x9d He seems, however, to think very little about Petersburg and\r\n_comme il faut_: he once even called himself one of the proletariat.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are working people,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; I thought if Dmitri had said that, I\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have liked it; but he may talk about himself, he may boast if\r\nhe likes. With me he is very attentive; but I kept feeling that a very,\r\nvery condescending superior was talking with me. When he means to praise\r\nany one, he says So-and-so is a man of principle--that\xe2\x80\x99s his\r\nfavourite word. He seems to be self-confident, hardworking, capable of\r\nself-sacrifice (you see, I am impartial), that\xe2\x80\x99s to say, of sacrificing\r\nhis own interest; but he is a great despot. It would be woeful to fall\r\ninto his power! At dinner they began talking about bribes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in many cases the man who accepts a bribe is\r\nnot to blame; he cannot do otherwise. Still, if he is found out,\r\nhe must be punished without mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cPunish an innocent man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYes; for the sake of principle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWhat principle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Shubin. Kurnatovsky\r\nseemed annoyed or surprised, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat needs no explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa, who seems to worship him, put in \xe2\x80\x9cof course not\xe2\x80\x9d; and to my\r\nvexation the conversation stopped there. In the evening Bersenyev came\r\nand got into a terrific argument with him. I have never seen our good\r\nAndrei Petrovitch so excited. Mr. Kurnatovsky did not at all deny the\r\nutility of science, universities, and so on, but still I understood\r\nAndrei Petrovitch\xe2\x80\x99s indignation. The man looks at it all as a sort of\r\ngymnastics. Shubin came up to me after dinner, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis fellow\r\nhere and some one else (he can never bring himself to utter your name)\r\nare both practical men, but see what a difference; there\xe2\x80\x99s the real\r\nliving ideal given to life; and here there\xe2\x80\x99s not even a feeling of duty,\r\nsimply official honesty and activity without anything inside it.\xe2\x80\x9d Shubin\r\nis clever, and I remembered his words to tell you; but to my mind there\r\nis nothing in common between you. You _have faith_, and he has not; for\r\na man cannot _have faith_ in himself only.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did not go away till late; but mamma had time to inform me that he\r\nwas pleased with me, and papa is in ecstasies. Did he say, I wonder,\r\nthat I was a woman of principle? I was almost telling mamma that I was\r\nvery sorry, but I had a husband already. Why is it papa dislikes you so?\r\nMamma, we could soon manage to bring round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my dear one! I have described this gentleman in such detail to\r\ndeaden my heartache. I don\xe2\x80\x99t live without you; I am constantly seeing\r\nyou, hearing you. I look forward to seeing you--only not at our house,\r\nas you intended--fancy how wretched and ill at ease we should be!--but\r\nyou know where I wrote to you--in that wood. Oh, my dear one! How I love\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks after Kurnatovsky\xe2\x80\x99s first visit, Anna Vassilyevna, to\r\nElena\xe2\x80\x99s great delight, returned to Moscow, to her large wooden house\r\nnear Prechistenka; a house with columns, white lyres and wreaths over\r\nevery window, with an attic, offices, a palisade, a huge green court, a\r\nwell in the court and a dog\xe2\x80\x99s kennel near the well. Anna Vassilyevna\r\nhad never left her country villa so early, but this year with the first\r\nautumn chills her face swelled; Nikolai Artemyevitch for his part,\r\nhaving finished his cure, began to want his wife; besides, Augustina\r\nChristianovna had gone away on a visit to her cousin in Revel; a family\r\nof foreigners, known as \xe2\x80\x98living statues,\xe2\x80\x99 _des poses plastiques_, had\r\ncome to Moscow, and the description of them in the _Moscow Gazette_ had\r\naroused Anna Vassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s liveliest curiosity. In short, to stay longer\r\nat the villa seemed inconvenient, and even, in Nikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords, incompatible with the fulfilment of his \xe2\x80\x98cherished projects.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nlast fortnight seemed very long to Elena. Kurnatovsky came over twice\r\non Sundays; on other days he was busy. He came really to see Elena,\r\nbut talked more to Zoya, who was much pleased with him. \xe2\x80\x98_Das ist ein\r\nMann_!\xe2\x80\x99 she thought to herself, as she looked at his full manly face and\r\nlistened to his self-confident, condescending talk. To her mind, no one\r\nhad such a wonderful voice, no one could pronounce so nicely, \xe2\x80\x98I had\r\nthe hon-our,\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98I am most de-lighted.\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov did not come to the\r\nStahovs, but Elena saw him once in secret in a little copse by the\r\nMoskva river, where she arranged to meet him. They hardly had time to\r\nsay more than a few words to each other. Shubin returned to Moscow with\r\nAnna Vassilyevna; Bersenyev, a few days later.\r\n\r\nInsarov was sitting in his room, and for the third time looking through\r\nthe letters brought him from Bulgaria by hand; they were afraid to send\r\nthem by post. He was much disturbed by them. Events were developing\r\nrapidly in the East; the occupation of the Principalities by Russian\r\ntroops had thrown all men\xe2\x80\x99s minds into a ferment; the storm was\r\ngrowing--already could be felt the breath of approaching inevitable war.\r\nThe fire was kindling all round, and no one could foresee how far it\r\nwould go--where it would stop. Old wrongs, long cherished hopes--all\r\nwere astir again. Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s heart throbbed eagerly; his hopes too were\r\nbeing realised. \xe2\x80\x98But is it not too soon, will it not be in vain?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nthought, tightly clasping his hands. \xe2\x80\x98We are not ready, but so be it! I\r\nmust go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething rustled lightly at the door, it flew quickly open, and into\r\nthe room ran Elena.\r\n\r\nInsarov, all in a tremor, rushed to her, fell on his knees before her,\r\nclasped her waist and pressed it close against his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect me?\xe2\x80\x99 she said, hardly able to draw her breath, she\r\nhad run quickly up the stairs. \xe2\x80\x98Dear one! dear one!--so this is\r\nwhere you live? I\xe2\x80\x99ve quickly found you. The daughter of your landlord\r\nconducted me. We arrived the day before yesterday. I meant to write to\r\nyou, but I thought I had better come myself. I have come for a quarter\r\nof an hour. Get up, shut the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe got up, quickly shut the door, returned to her and took her by the\r\nhands. He could not speak; he was choking with delight. She looked with\r\na smile into his eyes... there was such rapture in them... she felt shy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, fondly taking her hand away from him, \xe2\x80\x98let me take off\r\nmy hat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe untied the strings of her hat, flung it down, slipped the cape off\r\nher shoulders, tidied her hair, and sat down on the little old sofa.\r\nInsarov gazed at her, without stirring, like one enchanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, not lifting her eyes to him and motioning him to a\r\nplace beside her.\r\n\r\nInsarov sat down, not on the sofa, but on the floor at her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, take off my gloves,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in an uncertain voice. She felt\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\nHe began first to unbutton and then to draw off one glove; he drew it\r\nhalf off and greedily pressed his lips to the slender, soft wrist, which\r\nwas white under it.\r\n\r\nElena shuddered, and would have pushed him back with the other hand; he\r\nbegan kissing the other hand too. Elena drew it away, he threw back his\r\nhead, she looked into his face, bent above him, and their lips touched.\r\n\r\nAn instant passed... she broke away, got up, whispered \xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwent quickly up to the writing-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am mistress here, you know, so you ought not to have any secrets from\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, trying to seem at ease, and standing with her back to\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98What a lot of papers! what are these letters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov knitted his brows. \xe2\x80\x98Those letters?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, getting up, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\ncan read them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena turned them over in her hand. \xe2\x80\x98There are so many of them, and the\r\nwriting is so fine, and I have to go directly... let them be. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot from a rival, eh?... and they\xe2\x80\x99re not in Russian,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, turning\r\nover the thin sheets.\r\n\r\nInsarov came close to her and fondly touched her waist. She turned\r\nsuddenly to him, smiled brightly at him and leant against his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those letters are from Bulgaria, Elena; my friends write to me, they\r\nwant me to come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now? To them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes... now, while there is still time, while it is still possible to\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll at once she flung both arms round his neck, \xe2\x80\x98You will take me with\r\nyou, yes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe pressed her to his heart. \xe2\x80\x98O my sweet girl, O my heroine, how\r\nyou said that! But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it wicked, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it mad for me, a homeless,\r\nsolitary man, to drag you with me... and out there too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shut his mouth.... \xe2\x80\x98Sh--or I shall be angry, and never come to see\r\nyou again. Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t it all decided, all settled between us? Am I not\r\nyour wife? Can a wife be parted from her husband?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wives don\xe2\x80\x99t go into war,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with a half-mournful smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, when they can\xe2\x80\x99t stay behind, and I cannot stay here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena, my angel!.. but think, I have, perhaps, to leave Moscow in a\r\nfortnight. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of university lectures, or finishing my work.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Elena, \xe2\x80\x98you have to go soon? If you like, I will\r\nstop at once this minute with you for ever, and not go home, shall I?\r\nShall we go at once?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov clasped her in his arms with redoubled warmth. \xe2\x80\x98May God so\r\nreward me then,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98if I am doing wrong! From to-day, we are one\r\nfor ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Am I to stay?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my pure girl; no, my treasure. You shall go back home to-day, only\r\nkeep yourself in readiness. This is a matter we can\xe2\x80\x99t manage straight\r\noff; we must plan it out well. We want money, a passport----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have money,\xe2\x80\x99 put in Elena. \xe2\x80\x98Eighty roubles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s not much,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Insarov; \xe2\x80\x98but everything\xe2\x80\x99s a help.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I can get more. I will borrow. I will ask mamma.... No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask\r\nmamma for any.... But I can sell my watch.... I have earrings, too, and\r\ntwo bracelets... and lace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Money\xe2\x80\x99s not the chief difficulty, Elena; the passport; your passport,\r\nhow about that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, how about it? Is a passport absolutely necessary?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena laughed. \xe2\x80\x98What a queer idea! I remember when I was little... a\r\nmaid of ours ran away. She was caught, and forgiven, and lived with us a\r\nlong while... but still every one used to call her Tatyana, the runaway.\r\nI never thought then that I too might perhaps be a runaway like her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you ashamed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why? Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s better to go with a passport. But if we can\xe2\x80\x99t----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will settle all that later, later, wait a little,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me look about; let me think a little. We will talk over everything\r\ntogether thoroughly. I too have money.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena pushed back the hair that fell over on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Dmitri! how glorious it will be for us two to set off together!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98but there, when we get there----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 put in Elena, \xe2\x80\x98and won\xe2\x80\x99t it be glorious to die together too?\r\nbut no, why should we die? We will live, we are young. How old are you?\r\nTwenty-six?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, twenty-six.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I am twenty. There is plenty of time before us. Ah, you tried to\r\nrun away from me? You did not want a Russian\xe2\x80\x99s love, you Bulgarian! Let\r\nme see you trying to escape from me now! What would have become of us,\r\nif I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to you then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena, you know what forced me to go away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know; you were in love, and you were afraid. But surely you must have\r\nsuspected that you were loved?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I swear on my honour, Elena, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick unexpected kiss. \xe2\x80\x98There, I love you for that too.\r\nAnd goodbye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t stop longer?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, dearest. Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for me to get out alone? The\r\nquarter of an hour was over long ago.\xe2\x80\x99 She put on her cape and hat. \xe2\x80\x98And\r\nyou come to us to-morrow evening. No, the day after to-morrow. We shall\r\nbe constrained and dreary, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t help that; at least we shall see\r\neach other. Good-bye. Let me go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe embraced her for the last time. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, take care, you have broken my\r\nwatch-chain. Oh, what a clumsy boy! There, never mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the\r\nbetter. I will go to Kuznetsky bridge, and leave it to be mended. If\r\nI am asked, I can say I have been to Kuznetsky bridge.\xe2\x80\x99 She held the\r\ndoor-handle. \xe2\x80\x98By-the-way, I forgot to tell you, Monsieur Kurnatovsky\r\nwill certainly make me an offer in a day or two. But the answer I shall\r\nmake him--will be this----\xe2\x80\x99 She put the thumb of her left hand to the\r\ntip of her nose and flourished the other fingers in the air. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye\r\ntill we see each other again. Now, I know the way... And don\xe2\x80\x99t lose any\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena opened the door a little, listened, turned round to Insarov,\r\nnodded her head, and glided out of the room.\r\n\r\nFor a minute Insarov stood before the closed door, and he too listened.\r\nThe door downstairs into the court slammed. He went up to the sofa, sat\r\ndown, and covered his eyes with his hands. Never before had anything\r\nlike this happened to him. \xe2\x80\x98What have I done to deserve such love?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x98Is it a dream?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the delicate scent of mignonette left by Elena in his poor dark\r\nlittle room told of her visit. And with it, it seemed that the air was\r\nstill full of the notes of a young voice, and the sound of a light young\r\ntread, and the warmth and freshness of a young girlish body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nInsarov decided to await more positive news, and began to make\r\npreparations for departure. The difficulty was a serious one. For\r\nhim personally there were no obstacles. He had only to ask for a\r\npassport--but how would it be with Elena? To get her a passport in the\r\nlegal way was impossible. Should he marry her secretly, and should they\r\nthen go and present themselves to the parents?... \xe2\x80\x98They would let us go\r\nthen,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought \xe2\x80\x98But if they did not? We would go all the same. But\r\nsuppose they were to make a complaint... if... No, better try to get a\r\npassport somehow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe decided to consult (of course mentioning no names) one of his\r\nacquaintances, an attorney, retired from practice, or perhaps struck\r\noff the rolls, an old and experienced hand at all sorts of clandestine\r\nbusiness. This worthy person did not live near; Insarov was a whole hour\r\nin getting to him in a very sorry droshky, and, to make matters worse,\r\nhe did not find him at home; and on his way back got soaked to the skin\r\nby a sudden downpour of rain. The next morning, in spite of a rather\r\nsevere headache, Insarov set off a second time to call on the retired\r\nattorney. The retired attorney listened to him attentively, taking snuff\r\nfrom a snuff-box decorated with a picture of a full-bosomed nymph, and\r\nglancing stealthily at his visitor with his sly, and also snuff-coloured\r\nlittle eyes; he heard him to the end, and then demanded \xe2\x80\x98greater\r\ndefiniteness in the statement of the facts of the case\xe2\x80\x99; and observing\r\nthat Insarov was unwilling to launch into particulars (it was against\r\nthe grain that he had come to him at all) he confined himself to the\r\nadvice to provide himself above all things with \xe2\x80\x98the needful,\xe2\x80\x99 and asked\r\nhim to come to him again, \xe2\x80\x98when you have,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, sniffing at the\r\nsnuff in the open snuff-box, \xe2\x80\x98augmented your confidence and decreased\r\nyour diffidence\xe2\x80\x99 (he talked with a broad accent). \xe2\x80\x98A passport,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded, as though to himself, \xe2\x80\x98is a thing that can be arranged; you go\r\na journey, for instance; who\xe2\x80\x99s to tell whether you\xe2\x80\x99re Marya Bredihin\r\nor Karolina Vogel-meier?\xe2\x80\x99 A feeling of nausea came over Insarov, but he\r\nthanked the attorney, and promised to come to him again in a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe same evening he went to the Stahovs. Anna Vassilyevna met him\r\ncordially, reproached him a little for having quite forgotten them,\r\nand, finding him pale, inquired especially after his health. Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch did not say a single word to him; he only stared at him\r\nwith elaborately careless curiosity; Shubin treated him coldly; but\r\nElena astounded him. She was expecting him; she had put on for him the\r\nvery dress she wore on the day of their first interview in the chapel;\r\nbut she welcomed him so calmly, and was so polite and carelessly gay,\r\nthat no one looking at her could have believed that this girl\xe2\x80\x99s fate was\r\nalready decided, and that it was only the secret consciousness of happy\r\nlove that gave fire to her features, lightness and charm to all her\r\ngestures. She poured out tea in Zoya\xe2\x80\x99s place, jested, chattered; she\r\nknew Shubin would be watching her, that Insarov was incapable of wearing\r\na mask, and incapable of appearing indifferent, and she had prepared\r\nherself beforehand. She was not mistaken; Shubin never took his eyes off\r\nher, and Insarov was very silent and gloomy the whole evening. Elena was\r\nso happy that she even felt an inclination to tease him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, by the way,\xe2\x80\x99 she said to him suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98is your plan getting on at\r\nall?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov was taken aback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What plan?\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, have you forgotten?\xe2\x80\x99 she rejoined, laughing in his face; he alone\r\ncould tell the meaning of that happy laugh: \xe2\x80\x98Your Bulgarian selections\r\nfor Russian readers?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Quelle bourde_!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Nikolai Artemyevitch between his teeth.\r\n\r\nZoya sat down to the piano. Elena gave a just perceptible shrug of the\r\nshoulders, and with her eyes motioned Insarov to the door. Then she\r\ntwice slowly touched the table with her finger, and looked at him. He\r\nunderstood that she was promising to see him in two days, and she gave\r\nhim a quick smile when she saw he understood her. Insarov got up and\r\nbegan to take leave; he felt unwell. Kurnatovsky arrived. Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch jumped up, raised his right hand higher than his head, and\r\nsoftly dropped it into the palm of the chief secretary. Insarov would\r\nhave remained a few minutes longer, to have a look at his rival. Elena\r\nshook her head unseen; the host did not think it necessary to introduce\r\nthem to one another, and Insarov departed, exchanging one last look with\r\nElena. Shubin pondered and pondered, and threw himself into a fierce\r\nargument with Kurnatovsky on a legislative question, about which he had\r\nnot a single idea.\r\n\r\nInsarov did not sleep all night, and in the morning he felt very ill; he\r\nset to work, however, putting his papers into order and writing letters,\r\nbut his head was heavy and confused. At dinner time he began to be in\r\na fever; he could eat nothing. The fever grew rapidly worse towards\r\nevening; he had aching pains in all his limbs, and a terrible headache.\r\nInsarov lay down on the very little sofa on which Elena had lately sat;\r\nhe thought: \xe2\x80\x98It serves me right for going to that old rascal,\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\ntried to sleep.... But the illness had by now complete mastery of him.\r\nHis veins were throbbing violently, his blood was on fire, his thoughts\r\nwere flying round like birds. He sank into forgetfulness. He lay like a\r\nman felled by a blow on his face, and suddenly, it seemed to him, some\r\none was softly laughing and whispering over him: he opened his eyes with\r\nan effort, the light of the flaring candle smote him like a knife....\r\nWhat was it? the old attorney was before him in an Oriental silk\r\ngown belted with a silk handkerchief, as he had seen him the evening\r\nbefore.... \xe2\x80\x98Karolina Vogelmeier,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered his toothless mouth. Insarov\r\nstared, and the old man grew wide and thick and tall, he was no longer a\r\nman, he was a tree.... Insarov had to climb along its gnarled branches.\r\nHe clung, and fell with his breast on a sharp stone, and Karolina\r\nVogelmeier was sitting on her heels, looking like a pedlar-woman, and\r\nlisping: \xe2\x80\x98Pies, pies, pies for sale\xe2\x80\x99; and there were streams of blood\r\nand swords flashing incessantly.... Elena! And everything vanished in a\r\ncrimson chaos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s some one here looks like a locksmith or something of the sort,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBersenyev was informed the following evening by his servant, who was\r\ndistinguished by a severe deportment and sceptical turn of mind towards\r\nhis master; \xe2\x80\x98he wants to see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask him in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bersenyev.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98locksmith\xe2\x80\x99 entered. Bersenyev recognised in him the tailor, the\r\nlandlord of Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I came to your honour,\xe2\x80\x99 began the tailor, shifting from one foot to the\r\nother, and at times waving his right hand with his cuff clutched in his\r\nthree last fingers. \xe2\x80\x98Our lodger, seemingly, is very ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Insarov?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, our lodger, to be sure; yesterday morning he was still on his\r\nlegs, in the evening he asked for nothing but drink; the missis took\r\nhim some water, and at night he began talking away; we could hear him\r\nthrough the partition-wall; and this morning he lies without a word like\r\na log, and the fever he\xe2\x80\x99s in, Lord have mercy on us! I thought, upon my\r\nword, he\xe2\x80\x99ll die for sure; I ought to send word to the police station, I\r\nthought. For he\xe2\x80\x99s so alone; but the missis said: \xe2\x80\x9cGo to that gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she says, \xe2\x80\x9cat whose country place our lodger stayed; maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou what to do, or come himself.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to your honour, for we\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, so to say----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev snatched up his cap, thrust a rouble into the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nand at once set off with him post haste to Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings.\r\n\r\nHe found him lying on the sofa, unconscious and not undressed. His face\r\nwas terribly changed. Bersenyev at once ordered the people of the house\r\nto undress him and put him to bed, while he rushed off himself\r\nand returned with a doctor. The doctor prescribed leeches,\r\nmustard-poultices, and calomel, and ordered him to be bled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he dangerously ill?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, very dangerously,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98Severe inflammation\r\nof the lungs; peripneumonia fully developed, and the brain perhaps\r\naffected, but the patient is young. His very strength is something\r\nagainst him now. I was sent for too late; still we will do all that\r\nscience dictates.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe doctor was young himself, and still believed in science.\r\n\r\nBersenyev stayed the night. The people of the house seemed kind, and\r\neven prompt directly there was some one to tell them what was to be\r\ndone. An assistant arrived, and began to carry out the medical measures.\r\n\r\nTowards morning Insarov revived for a few minutes, recognised Bersenyev,\r\nasked: \xe2\x80\x98Am I ill, then?\xe2\x80\x99 looked about him with the vague, listless\r\nbewilderment of a man dangerously ill, and again relapsed into\r\nunconsciousness. Bersenyev went home, changed his clothes, and, taking a\r\nfew books along with him, he returned to Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. He made up\r\nhis mind to stay there, at least for a time. He shut in Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\nwith screens, and arranged a little place for himself by the sofa. The\r\nday passed slowly and drearily. Bersenyev did not leave the room except\r\nto get his dinner. The evening came. He lighted a candle with a shade,\r\nand settled down to a book. Everything was still around. Through the\r\npartition wall could be heard suppressed whispering in the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, then a yawn, and a sigh. Some one sneezed, and was scolded in\r\na whisper; behind the screen was heard the patient\xe2\x80\x99s heavy, uneven\r\nbreathing, sometimes broken by a short groan, and the uneasy tossing of\r\nhis head on the pillow.... Strange fancies came over Bersenyev. He found\r\nhimself in the room of a man whose life was hanging on a thread, the man\r\nwhom, as he knew, Elena loved.... He remembered that night when Shubin\r\nhad overtaken him and declared that she loved him, him, Bersenyev! And\r\nnow.... \xe2\x80\x98What am I to do now?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x98Let Elena know of his\r\nillness? Wait a little? This would be worse news for her than what I\r\ntold her once before; strange how fate makes me the go-between between\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x99 He made up his mind that it was better to wait a little. His eyes\r\nfell on the table covered with heaps of papers... \xe2\x80\x98Will he carry out his\r\ndreams?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Bersenyev. \xe2\x80\x98Can it be that all will come to nothing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he was filled with pity for the young life struck down, and he vowed\r\nto himself to save it.\r\n\r\nThe night was an uneasy one. The sick man was very delirious. Several\r\ntimes Bersenyev got up from his little sofa, approached the bed on\r\ntip-toe, and listened with a heavy heart to his disconnected muttering.\r\nOnly once Insarov spoke with sudden distinctness: \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nshe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t....\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev started and looked at Insarov; his face,\r\nsuffering and death-like at the same time, was immovable, and his hands\r\nlay powerless. \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, scarcely audibly.\r\n\r\nThe doctor came in the morning, shook his head and wrote fresh\r\nprescriptions. \xe2\x80\x98The crisis is a long way off still,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, putting on\r\nhis hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And after the crisis?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Bersenyev.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The crisis may end in two ways, _aut Caesar aut nihil_.\r\n\r\nThe doctor went away. Bersenyev walked a few times up and down the\r\nstreet; he felt in need of fresh air. He went back and took up a book\r\nagain. Raumer he had finished long ago; he was now making a study of\r\nGrote.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door softly creaked, and the head of the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, covered as usual with a heavy kerchief, was cautiously thrust\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is the lady,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered, \xe2\x80\x98who gave me a silver piece.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe child\xe2\x80\x99s head vanished quickly, and in its place appeared Elena.\r\n\r\nBersenyev jumped up as if he had been stung; but Elena did not stir, nor\r\ncry out. It seemed as if she understood everything in a single instant.\r\nA terrible pallor overspread her face, she went up to the screen, looked\r\nbehind it, threw up her arms, and seemed turned to stone.\r\n\r\nA moment more and she would have flung herself on Insarov, but Bersenyev\r\nstopped her. \xe2\x80\x98What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x99 he said in a trembling whisper, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmight be the death of him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was reeling. He led her to the sofa, and made her sit down.\r\n\r\nShe looked into his face, then her eyes ran over him from head to foot,\r\nthen stared at the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will he die?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked so coldly and quietly that Bersenyev was\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98what are you saying? He\r\nis ill certainly--and rather seriously--but we will save him; I promise\r\nyou that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is unconscious?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked in the same tone of voice as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he is unconscious at present. That\xe2\x80\x99s always the case at the early\r\nstage of these illnesses, but it means nothing, nothing--I assure you.\r\nDrink some water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to his, and he saw she had not heard his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he dies,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in the same voice, \xe2\x80\x98I will die too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that instant Insarov uttered a slight moan; she trembled all over,\r\nclutched at her head, then began untying the strings of her hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will stay here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will stay--for long?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, perhaps all day, the night, always--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Elena Nikolaevna, control yourself. I could not of\r\ncourse have any expectation of seeing you here; but still I--assume you\r\nhave come for a short time. Remember they may miss you at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They will look for you--find you----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna! You see. He cannot now protect you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe dropped her head, seemed lost in thought, raised a handkerchief\r\nto her lips, and convulsive sobs, tearing her by their violence, were\r\nsuddenly wrung from her breast. She threw herself, face downwards, on\r\nthe sofa, trying to stifle them, but still her body heaved and throbbed\r\nlike a captured bird.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna--for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev was repeating over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 suddenly sounded the voice of Insarov.\r\n\r\nElena started up, and Bersenyev felt rooted to the spot. After waiting a\r\nlittle, he went up to the bed. Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s head lay on the pillow helpless\r\nas before; his eyes were closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he delirious?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems so,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Bersenyev, \xe2\x80\x98but that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing; it\xe2\x80\x99s always so,\r\nespecially if----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When was he taken ill?\xe2\x80\x99 Elena broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The day before yesterday; I have been here since yesterday. Rely on\r\nme, Elena Nikolaevna. I will not leave him; everything shall be done. If\r\nnecessary, we will have a consultation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will die without me,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I give you my word I will let you hear every day how his illness goes\r\non, and if there should be immediate danger----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Swear you will send for me at once whenever it may be, day or night,\r\nwrite a note straight to me--I care for nothing now. Do you hear? you\r\npromise you will do that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promise before God\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Swear it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I swear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe suddenly snatched his hand, and before he had time to pull it away,\r\nshe had bent and pressed her lips to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna, what are you----\xe2\x80\x99 he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--no--I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it----\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov muttered indistinctly, and sighed\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\nElena went up to the screen, her handkerchief pressed between her teeth,\r\nand bent a long, long look on the sick man. Silent tears rolled down her\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev said to her, \xe2\x80\x98he might come to himself\r\nand recognise you; there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing if that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do harm. Besides,\r\nfrom hour to hour I expect the doctor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena took her hat from the sofa, put it on and stood still. Her eyes\r\nstrayed mournfully over the room. She seemed to be remembering....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot go away,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered at last.\r\n\r\nBersenyev pressed her hand: \xe2\x80\x98Try to pull yourself together,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98calm yourself; you are leaving him in my care. I will come to you this\r\nvery evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena looked at him, said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, my good, kind friend!\xe2\x80\x99 broke into sobs\r\nand rushed away.\r\n\r\nBersenyev leaned against the door. A feeling of sorrow and bitterness,\r\nnot without a kind of strange consolation, overcame him. \xe2\x80\x98My good, kind\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x99 he thought and shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is here?\xe2\x80\x99 he heard Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nBersenyev went up to him. \xe2\x80\x98I am here, Dmitri Nikanorovitch. How are you?\r\nHow do you feel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you alone?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the sick man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 Bersenyev asked almost in dismay.\r\n\r\nInsarov was silent. \xe2\x80\x98Mignonette,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured, and his eyes closed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFor eight whole days Insarov lay between life and death. The doctor was\r\nincessantly visiting him, interested as a young man in a difficult case.\r\nShubin heard of Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s critical position, and made inquiries after\r\nhim. His compatriots--Bulgarians--came; among them Bersenyev recognised\r\nthe two strange figures, who had puzzled him by their unexpected visit\r\nto the cottage; they all showed genuine sympathy, some offered to take\r\nBersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s place by the patient\xe2\x80\x99s bed-side; but he would not consent\r\nto that, remembering his promise to Elena. He saw her every day and\r\nsecretly reported to her--sometimes by word of mouth, sometimes in a\r\nbrief note--every detail of the illness. With what sinkings of the heart\r\nshe awaited him, how she listened and questioned him! She was always on\r\nthe point of hastening to Insarov herself; but Bersenyev begged her not\r\nto do this: Insarov was seldom alone. On the first day she knew of his\r\nillness she herself had almost fallen ill; directly she got home,\r\nshe shut herself up in her room; but she was summoned to dinner, and\r\nappeared in the dining-room with such a face that Anna Vassilyevna was\r\nalarmed, and was anxious to put her to bed. Elena succeeded, however, in\r\ncontrolling herself. \xe2\x80\x98If he dies,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, \xe2\x80\x98it will be the end\r\nof me too.\xe2\x80\x99 This thought tranquillised her, and enabled her to seem\r\nindifferent. Besides no one troubled her much; Anna Vassilyevna was\r\ntaken up with her swollen face; Shubin was working furiously; Zoya\r\nwas given up to pensiveness, and disposed to read _Werther_; Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch was much displeased at the frequent visits of \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nscholar,\xe2\x80\x99 especially as his \xe2\x80\x98cherished projects\xe2\x80\x99 in regard to\r\nKurnatovsky were making no way; the practical chief secretary was\r\npuzzled and biding his time. Elena did not even thank Bersenyev; there\r\nare services for which thanks are cruel and shameful. Only once at her\r\nfourth interview with him--Insarov had passed a very bad night, the\r\ndoctor had hinted at a consultation--only then she reminded him of his\r\npromise. \xe2\x80\x98Very well, then let us go,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to her. She got up and\r\nwas going to get ready. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he decided, \xe2\x80\x98let us wait till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nTowards evening Insarov was rather better.\r\n\r\nFor eight days this torture was prolonged. Elena appeared calm; but she\r\ncould eat nothing, and did not sleep at night. There was a dull ache in\r\nall her limbs; her head seemed full of a sort of dry burning smoke. \xe2\x80\x98Our\r\nyoung lady\xe2\x80\x99s wasting like a candle,\xe2\x80\x99 her maid said of her.\r\n\r\nAt last by the ninth day the crisis was passing over. Elena was sitting\r\nin the drawing-room near Anna Vassilyevna, and, without knowing herself\r\nwhat she was doing, was reading her the _Moscow Gazette_; Bersenyev came\r\nin. Elena glanced at him--how rapid, and fearful, and penetrating, and\r\ntremulous, was the first glance she turned on him every time--and at\r\nonce she guessed that he brought good news. He was smiling; he nodded\r\nslightly to her, she got up to go and meet him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has regained consciousness, he is saved, he will be quite well again\r\nin a week,\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered to her.\r\n\r\nElena had stretched out her arm as though to ward off a blow, and she\r\nsaid nothing, only her lips trembled and a flush of crimson overspread\r\nher whole face. Bersenyev began to talk to Anna Vassilyevna, and Elena\r\nwent off to her own room, dropped on her knees and fell to praying, to\r\nthanking God. Light, shining tears trickled down her cheeks. Suddenly\r\nshe was conscious of intense weariness, laid her head down on the\r\npillow, whispered \xe2\x80\x98poor Andrei Petrovitch!\xe2\x80\x99 and at once fell asleep with\r\nwet cheeks and eyelashes. It was long since she had slept or wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBersenyev\xe2\x80\x99s words turned out only partly true; the danger was over,\r\nbut Insarov gained strength slowly, and the doctor talked of a complete\r\nundermining of the whole system. The patient left his bed for all\r\nthat, and began to walk about the room; Bersenyev went home to his own\r\nlodging, but he came every day to his still feeble friend; and every day\r\nas before he informed Elena of the state of his health. Insarov did\r\nnot dare to write to her, and only indirectly in his conversations with\r\nBersenyev referred to her; but Bersenyev, with assumed carelessness,\r\ntold him about his visits to the Stahovs, trying, however, to give him\r\nto understand that Elena had been deeply distressed, and that now she\r\nwas calmer. Elena too did not write to Insarov; she had a plan in her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nOne day Bersenyev had just informed her with a cheerful face that the\r\ndoctor had already allowed Insarov to eat a cutlet, and that he would\r\nprobably soon go out; she seemed absorbed, dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guess, what I want to say to you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. Bersenyev was confused. He\r\nunderstood her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, looking away, \xe2\x80\x98you want to say that you wish\r\nto see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena crimsoned, and scarcely audibly, she breathed, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what then? That, I imagine, you can easily do.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Ugh!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x98what a loathsome feeling there is in my heart!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean that I have already before...\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena. \xe2\x80\x98But I am\r\nafraid--now he is, you say, seldom alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult to get over,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Bersenyev, still not looking\r\nat her. \xe2\x80\x98I, of course, cannot prepare him; but give me a note. Who\r\ncan hinder your writing to him as a good friend, in whom you take an\r\ninterest? There\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in that. Appoint--I mean, write to him when\r\nyou will come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am ashamed,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give me the note, I will take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no need of that, but I wanted to ask you--don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with\r\nme, Andrei Petrovitch--don\xe2\x80\x99t go to him to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBersenyev bit his lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! yes, I understand; very well, very well,\xe2\x80\x99 and, adding two or three\r\nwords more, he quickly took leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much the better, so much the better,\xe2\x80\x99 he thought, as he hurried\r\nhome. \xe2\x80\x98I have learnt nothing new, but so much the better. What possessed\r\nme to go hanging on to the edge of another man\xe2\x80\x99s happiness? I regret\r\nnothing; I have done what my conscience told me; but now it is over. Let\r\nthem be! My father was right when he used to say to me: \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I,\r\nmy dear boy, are not Sybarites, we are not aristocrats, we\xe2\x80\x99re not the\r\nspoilt darlings of fortune and nature, we are not even martyrs--we are\r\nworkmen and nothing more. Put on your leather apron, workman, and take\r\nyour place at your workman\xe2\x80\x99s bench, in your dark workshop, and let the\r\nsun shine on other men! Even our dull life has its own pride, its own\r\nhappiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next morning Insarov got a brief note by the post. \xe2\x80\x98Expect me,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nElena wrote to him, \xe2\x80\x98and give orders for no one to see you. A. P. will\r\nnot come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nInsarov read Elena\xe2\x80\x99s note, and at once began to set his room to rights;\r\nasked his landlady to take away the medicine-glasses, took off his\r\ndressing-gown and put on his coat. His head was swimming and his heart\r\nthrobbing from weakness and delight. His knees were shaking; he dropped\r\non to the sofa, and began to look at his watch. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s now a quarter to\r\ntwelve,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x98She can never come before twelve: I will\r\nthink of something else for a quarter of an hour, or I shall break down\r\naltogether. Before twelve she cannot possibly come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, and in a light silk gown, all pale, all fresh,\r\nyoung and joyful, Elena came in, and with a faint cry of delight she\r\nfell on his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are alive, you are mine,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, embracing and stroking\r\nhis head. He was almost swooning, breathless at such closeness, such\r\ncaresses, such bliss.\r\n\r\nShe sat down near him, holding him fast, and began to gaze at him with\r\nthat smiling, and caressing, and tender look, only to be seen shining in\r\nthe eyes of a loving woman.\r\n\r\nHer face suddenly clouded over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How thin you have grown, my poor Dmitri,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, passing her hand\r\nover his neck; \xe2\x80\x98what a beard you have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you have grown thin, my poor Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, catching her\r\nfingers with his lips.\r\n\r\nShe shook her curls gaily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. You shall see how soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll be strong again! The storm\r\nhas blown over, just as it blew over and passed away that day when we\r\nmet in the chapel. Now we are going to live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answered her with a smile only.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, what a time we have had, Dmitri, what a cruel time! How can people\r\noutlive those they love? I knew beforehand what Andrei Petrovitch would\r\nsay to me every day, I did really; my life seemed to ebb and flow with\r\nyours. Welcome back, my Dmitri!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not know what to say to her. He was longing to throw himself at\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another thing I observed,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, pushing back his hair--\xe2\x80\x98I made\r\nso many observations all this time in my leisure--when any one is very,\r\nvery miserable, with what stupid attention he follows everything that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing on about him! I really sometimes lost myself in gazing at a fly,\r\nand all the while such chill and terror in my heart! But that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\npast, all past, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Everything\xe2\x80\x99s bright in the future, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are for me in the future,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98so it is bright for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And for me too! But do you remember, when I was here, not the last\r\ntime--no, not the last time,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated with an involuntary shudder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98when we were talking, I spoke of death, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why; I never\r\nsuspected then that it was keeping watch on us. But you are well now,\r\naren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m much better, I\xe2\x80\x99m nearly well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are well, you are not dead. Oh, how happy I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA short silence followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena?\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, my dearest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, did it never occur to you that this illness was sent us as a\r\npunishment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena looked seriously at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That idea did come into my head, Dmitri. But I thought: what am I to be\r\npunished for? What duty have I transgressed, against whom have I sinned?\r\nPerhaps my conscience is not like other people\xe2\x80\x99s, but it was silent; or\r\nperhaps I am guilty towards you? I hinder you, I stop you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t stop me, Elena; we will go together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Dmitri, let us go together; I will follow you.... That is my duty.\r\nI love you.... I know no other duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 said Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98what chains every word of yours fastens on\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why talk of chains?\xe2\x80\x99 she interposed. \xe2\x80\x98We are free people, you and I.\r\nYes,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, looking musingly on the floor, while with one hand\r\nshe still stroked his hair, \xe2\x80\x98I experienced much lately of which I had\r\nnever had any idea! If any one had told me beforehand that I, a young\r\nlady, well brought up, should go out from home alone on all sorts\r\nof made-up excuses, and to go where? to a young man\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings--how\r\nindignant I should have been! And that has all come about, and I feel no\r\nindignation whatever. Really!\xe2\x80\x99 she added, and turned to Insarov.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with such an expression of adoration, that she softly\r\ndropped her hand from his hair over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri!\xe2\x80\x99 she began again, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t know of course, I saw you there in\r\nthat dreadful bed, I saw you in the clutches of death, unconscious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a little. \xe2\x80\x98And Bersenyev was here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe nodded.\r\n\r\nInsarov bowed down before her. \xe2\x80\x98O Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 he whispered, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to\r\nlook at you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why? Andrei Petrovitch is so good. I was not ashamed before him. And\r\nwhat have I to be ashamed of? I am ready to tell all the world that I am\r\nyours.... And Andrei Petrovitch I trust like a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He saved me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Insarov. \xe2\x80\x98He is the noblest, kindest of men!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes... And do you know I owe everything to him? Do you know that it\r\nwas he who first told me that you loved me? And if I could tell you\r\neverything.... Yes, he is a noble man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov looked steadily at Elena. \xe2\x80\x98He is in love with you, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena dropped her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98He did love me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said in an undertone.\r\n\r\nInsarov pressed her hand warmly. \xe2\x80\x98Oh you Russians,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\nhearts of pure gold! And he, he has been waiting on me, he has not slept\r\nat night. And you, you, my angel.... No reproaches, no hesitations...\r\nand all this for me, for me----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, all for you, because they love you. Ah, Dmitri! How strange\r\nit is! I think I have talked to you of it before, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\r\nI like to repeat it, and you will like to hear it. When I saw you the\r\nfirst time----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why are there tears in your eyes?\xe2\x80\x99 Insarov interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tears? Are there?\xe2\x80\x99 She wiped her eyes with her handkerchief. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what\r\na silly boy! He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know yet that people weep from happiness. I\r\nwanted to tell you: when I saw you the first time, I saw nothing special\r\nin you, really. I remember, Shubin struck me much more at first, though\r\nI never loved him, and as for Andrei Petrovitch--oh, there was a moment\r\nwhen I thought: isn\xe2\x80\x99t this _he_? And with you there was nothing of that\r\nsort; but afterwards--afterwards--you took my heart by storm!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have pity on me,\xe2\x80\x99 began Insarov. He tried to get up, but dropped down\r\non to the sofa again at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Elena anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing.... I am still rather weak. I am not strong enough yet for such\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then sit quietly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to move, don\xe2\x80\x99t get excited,\xe2\x80\x99 she added,\r\nthreatening him with her finger. \xe2\x80\x98And why have you left off your\r\ndressing-gown? It\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to begin to be a dandy! Sit down and I will\r\ntell you stories. Listen and be quiet. To talk much is bad for you after\r\nyour illness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe began to talk to him about Shubin, about Kurnatovsky, and what she\r\nhad been doing for the last fortnight, of how war seemed, judging from\r\nthe newspapers, inevitable, and so directly he was perfectly well again,\r\nhe must, without losing a minute, make arrangements for them to start.\r\nAll this she told him sitting beside him, leaning on his shoulder....\r\n\r\nHe listened to her, listened, turning pale and red. Sometimes he tried\r\nto stop her; suddenly he drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to her in a strange, hard voice \xe2\x80\x98leave me, go away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 she replied in bewilderment \xe2\x80\x98You feel ill?\xe2\x80\x99 she added quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No... I\xe2\x80\x99m all right... but, please, leave me now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. You drive me away?.. What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid suddenly; he had bent over from the sofa almost to the ground,\r\nand was pressing her feet to his lips. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that, Dmitri....\r\nDmitri----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then leave me! You see, Elena, when I was taken ill, I did not lose\r\nconsciousness at first; I knew I was on the edge of the abyss; even in\r\nthe fever, in delirium I knew, I felt vaguely that it was death coming\r\nto me, I took leave of life, of you, of everything; I gave up hope....\r\nAnd this return to life so suddenly; this light after the darkness,\r\nyou--you--near me, with me--your voice, your breath.... It\xe2\x80\x99s more than\r\nI can stand! I feel I love you passionately, I hear you call yourself\r\nmine, I cannot answer for myself... You must go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Elena, and she nestled her head on his shoulder.\r\nOnly now she understood him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, \xe2\x80\x98I love you, you know that; I am ready to give my\r\nlife for you.... Why have you come to me now, when I am weak, when I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t control myself, when all my blood\xe2\x80\x99s on fire... you are mine, you\r\nsay... you love me----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated; she flushed all over, and pressed still closer\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena, have pity on me; go away, I feel as if I should die.... I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand these violent emotions... my whole soul yearns for you ... think,\r\ndeath was almost parting us.. and now you are here, you are in my\r\narms... Elena----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was trembling all over. \xe2\x80\x98Take me, then,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered scarcely\r\nabove her breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch was walking up and down in his study with a scowl\r\non his face. Shubin was sitting at the window with his legs crossed,\r\ntranquilly smoking a cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Leave off tramping from corner to corner, please,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed,\r\nknocking the ash off his cigar. \xe2\x80\x98I keep expecting you to speak;\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a rick in my neck from watching you. Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nartificial, melodramatic in your striding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can never do anything but joke,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Nikolai Artemyevitch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t enter into my position, you refuse to realise that I am used\r\nto that woman, that I am attached to her in fact, that her absence is\r\nbound to distress me. Here it\xe2\x80\x99s October, winter is upon us. ... What can\r\nshe be doing in Revel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She must be knitting stockings--for herself; for herself--not for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may laugh, you may laugh; but I tell you I know no woman like her.\r\nSuch honesty; such disinterestedness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she cashed that bill yet?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such disinterestedness,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Nikolai Artemyevitch; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nastonishing. They tell me there are a million other women in the world,\r\nbut I say, show me the million; show me the million, I say; _ces femmes,\r\nqu\xe2\x80\x99on me les montre_! And she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write--that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s killing me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re eloquent as Pythagoras,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Shubin; \xe2\x80\x98but do you know what\r\nI would advise you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Augustina Christianovna comes back--you take my meaning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes; well, what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you see her again--you follow the line of my thought?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Try beating her; see what that would do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch turned away exasperated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought he was really going to give me some practical advice. But\r\nwhat can one expect from him! An artist, a man of no principles----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No principles! By the way, I\xe2\x80\x99m told your favourite Mr. Kurnatovsky, the\r\nman of principle, cleaned you out of a hundred roubles last night. That\r\nwas hardly delicate, you must own now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What of it? We were playing high. Of course, I might expect--but they\r\nunderstand so little how to appreciate him in this house----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That he thought: get what I can!\xe2\x80\x99 put in Shubin: \xe2\x80\x98whether he\xe2\x80\x99s to be my\r\nfather-in-law or not, is still on the knees of the gods, but a hundred\r\nroubles is worth something to a man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take bribes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father-in-law! How the devil am I his father-in-law? _Vous r\xc3\xaavez, mon\r\ncher_. Of course, any other girl would be delighted with such a suitor.\r\nOnly consider: a man of spirit and intellect, who has gained a position\r\nin the world, served in two provinces----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Led the governor in one of them by the nose,\xe2\x80\x99 remarked Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very likely. To be sure, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be. Practical, a business\r\nman----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And a capital hand at cards,\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin remarked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, and a capital hand at cards. But Elena Nikolaevna.... Is\r\nthere any understanding her? I should be glad to know if there is any\r\none who would undertake to make out what it is she wants. One day she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncheerful, another she\xe2\x80\x99s dull; all of a sudden she\xe2\x80\x99s so thin there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nlooking at her, and then suddenly she\xe2\x80\x99s well again, and all without any\r\napparent reason----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA disagreeable-looking man-servant came in with a cup of coffee, cream\r\nand sugar on a tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The father is pleased with a suitor,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Nikolai Artemyevitch,\r\nbreaking off a lump of sugar; \xe2\x80\x98but what is that to the daughter! That\r\nwas all very well in the old patriarchal days, but now we have changed\r\nall that. _Nous avons chang\xc3\xa9 tout \xc3\xa7a_. Nowadays a young girl talks to\r\nany one she thinks fit, reads what she thinks fit; she goes about Moscow\r\nalone without a groom or a maid, just as in Paris; and all that is\r\npermitted. The other day I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Elena Nikolaevna?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m told\r\nshe has gone out. Where? No one knows. Is that--the proper thing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take your coffee, and let the man go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin. \xe2\x80\x98You say yourself\r\nthat one ought not _devant les domestiques_\xe2\x80\x99 he added in an undertone.\r\n\r\nThe servant gave Shubin a dubious look, while Nikolai Artemyevitch took\r\nthe cup of coffee, added some cream, and seized some ten lumps of sugar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was just going to say when the servant came in,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nI count for nothing in this house. That\xe2\x80\x99s the long and short of the\r\nmatter. For nowadays every one judges from appearances; one man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan empty-headed fool, but gives himself airs of importance, and he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespected; while another, very likely, has talents which might--which\r\nmight gain him great distinction, but through modesty----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you a born statesman?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Shubin in a jeering voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give over playing the fool!\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai Artemyevitch cried with heat. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nforget yourself! Here you have another proof that I count for nothing in\r\nthis house, nothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anna Vassilyevna ill-uses you... poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Shubin, stretching.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Nikolai Artemyevitch, we\xe2\x80\x99re a pair of sinners! You had much\r\nbetter be getting a little present ready for Anna Vassilyevna. It\xe2\x80\x99s her\r\nbirthday in a day or two, and you know how she appreciates the least\r\nattention on your part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Nikolai Artemyevitch hastily. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to\r\nyou for reminding me. Of course, of course; to be sure. I have a little\r\nthing, a dressing-case, I bought it the other day at Rosenstrauch\xe2\x80\x99s; but\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know really if it will do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you bought it for her, the lady at Revel?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, certainly.--I had some idea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, in that case, it will be sure to do.\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin got up from his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are we going out this evening, Pavel Yakovlitch, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch asked with an amicable leer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why yes, you are going to your club.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After the club... after the club.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin stretched himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Nikolai Artemyevitch, I want to work to-morrow. Another time.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nhe walked off.\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch scowled, walked twice up and down the room, took a\r\nvelvet box with the dressing-case out of the bureau and looked at it a\r\nlong while, rubbing it with a silk handkerchief. Then he sat down before\r\na looking-glass and began carefully arranging his thick black hair,\r\nturning his head to right and to left with a dignified countenance, his\r\ntongue pressed into his cheek, never taking his eyes off his parting.\r\nSome one coughed behind his back; he looked round and saw the manservant\r\nwho had brought him in his coffee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nikolai Artemyevitch,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man with a certain solemnity, \xe2\x80\x98you are\r\nour master?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know that; what next!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nikolai Artemyevitch, graciously do not be angry with me; but I, having\r\nbeen in your honour\xe2\x80\x99s service from a boy, am bound in dutiful devotion\r\nto bring you----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man shifted uneasily as he stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You condescended to say, your honour,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98that your honour did\r\nnot know where Elena Nikolaevna was pleased to go. I have information\r\nabout that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What lies are you telling, idiot?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s as your honour likes, but I saw our young lady three days ago,\r\nas she was pleased to go into a house!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where? what? what house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a house, near Povarsky. Not far from here. I even asked the\r\ndoorkeeper who were the people living there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch stamped with his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence, scoundrel! How dare you?... Elena Nikolaevna, in the goodness\r\nof her heart, goes to visit the poor and you... Be off, fool!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe terrified servant was rushing to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Nikolai Artemyevitch. \xe2\x80\x98What did the doorkeeper say to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no--nothing--he said nothing--He told me--a stu--student----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence, scoundrel! Listen, you dirty beast; if you ever breathe a word\r\nin your dreams even----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mercy on us----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Silence! if you blab--if any one--if I find out--you shall find no\r\nhiding-place even underground! Do you hear? You can go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good Heavens, merciful powers! what does it mean?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch when he was left alone. \xe2\x80\x98What did that idiot tell me? Eh? I\r\nshall have to find out, though, what house it is, and who lives there.\r\nI must go myself. Has it come to this!... _Un laquais! Quelle\r\nhumiliation!_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd repeating aloud: \xe2\x80\x98_Un laquais!_\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai Artemyevitch shut the\r\ndressing-case up in the bureau, and went up to Anna Vassilyevna. He\r\nfound her in bed with her face tied up. But the sight of her sufferings\r\nonly irritated him, and he very soon reduced her to tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the storm gathering in the East was breaking. Turkey had\r\ndeclared war on Russia; the time fixed for the evacuation of the\r\nPrincipalities had already expired, the day of the disaster of Sinope\r\nwas not far off. The last letters received by Insarov summoned him\r\nurgently to his country. His health was not yet restored; he coughed,\r\nsuffered from weakness and slight attacks of fever, but he was scarcely\r\never at home. His heart was fired, he no longer thought of his illness.\r\nHe was for ever rushing about Moscow, having secret interviews with\r\nvarious persons, writing for whole nights, disappearing for whole days;\r\nhe had informed his landlord that he was going away shortly, and had\r\npresented him already with his scanty furniture. Elena too on her side\r\nwas getting ready for departure. One wet evening she was sitting in her\r\nroom, and listening with involuntary depression to the sighing of the\r\nwind, while she hemmed handkerchiefs. Her maid came in and told her that\r\nher father was in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s room and sent for her there. \xe2\x80\x98Your mamma\r\nis crying,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered after the retreating Elena, \xe2\x80\x98and your papa is\r\nangry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena gave a slight shrug and went into Anna Vassflyevna\xe2\x80\x99s room. Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s kind-hearted spouse was half lying on a reclining chair,\r\nsniffing a handkerchief steeped in _eau de Cologne_; he himself was\r\nstanding at the hearth, every button buttoned up, in a high, hard\r\ncravat, with a stiffly starched collar; his deportment had a vague\r\nsuggestion of some parliamentary orator. With an orator\xe2\x80\x99s wave of the\r\narm he motioned his daughter to a chair, and when she, not understanding\r\nhis gesture, looked inquiringly at him, he brought out with dignity,\r\nwithout turning his head: \xe2\x80\x98I beg you to be seated.\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai Artemyevitch\r\nalways used the formal plural in addressing his wife, but only on\r\nextraordinary occasions in addressing his daughter.\r\n\r\nElena sat down.\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna blew her nose tearfully. Nikolai Artemyevitch thrust\r\nhis fingers between his coat-buttons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sent for you, Elena Nikolaevna,\xe2\x80\x99 he began after a protracted silence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98in order to have an explanation with you, or rather in order to ask you\r\nfor an explanation. I am displeased with you--or no--that is too little\r\nto say: your behaviour is a pain and an outrage to me--to me and to your\r\nmother--your mother whom you see here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch was giving vent only to the few bass notes in\r\nhis voice. Elena gazed in silence at him, then at Anna Vassilyevna and\r\nturned pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was a time,\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai Artemyevitch resumed, \xe2\x80\x98when daughters did\r\nnot allow themselves to look down on their parents--when the parental\r\nauthority forced the disobedient to tremble. That time has passed,\r\nunhappily: so at least many persons imagine; but let me tell you, there\r\nare still laws which do not permit--do not permit--in fact there are\r\nstill laws. I beg you to mark that: there are still laws----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, papa,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena was beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg you not to interrupt me. Let us turn in thought to the past. I\r\nand Anna Vassilyevna have performed our duty. I and Anna Vassilyevna\r\nhave spared nothing in your education: neither care nor expense. What\r\nyou have gained from our care--is a different question; but I had the\r\nright to expect--I and Anna Vassilyevna had the right to expect that\r\nyou would at least hold sacred the principles of morality which we\r\nhave--_que nous avons inculqu\xc3\xa9s_, which we have instilled into you,\r\nour only daughter. We had the right to expect that no new \xe2\x80\x9cideas\xe2\x80\x9d could\r\ntouch that, so to speak, holy shrine. And what do we find? I am not now\r\nspeaking of frivolities characteristic of your sex, and age, but who\r\ncould have anticipated that you could so far forget yourself----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98I know what you are going to say------\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am going to say!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Nikolai Artemyevitch\r\nin a falsetto shriek, suddenly losing the majesty of his oratorical\r\npose, the smooth dignity of his speech, and his bass notes. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow, vile hussy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, _Nicolas_,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Anna Vassilyevna, \xe2\x80\x98_vous me\r\nfaites mourir_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me _que je vous fais mourir_, Anna Vassilyevna! You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconceive what you will hear directly! Prepare yourself for the worst, I\r\nwarn you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna seemed stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Nikolai Artemyevitch, turning to Elena, \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat I am going to say!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am to blame towards you----\xe2\x80\x99 she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, at last!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am to blame towards you,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Elena, \xe2\x80\x98for not having long ago\r\nconfessed----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 Nikolai Artemyevitch interrupted, \xe2\x80\x98that I can crush\r\nyou with one word?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena raised her eyes to look at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, madam, with one word! It\xe2\x80\x99s useless to look at me!\xe2\x80\x99 (He crossed his\r\narms on his breast.) \xe2\x80\x98Allow me to ask you, do you know a certain house\r\nnear Povarsky? Have you visited that house?\xe2\x80\x99 (He stamped.) \xe2\x80\x98Answer\r\nme, worthless girl, and don\xe2\x80\x99t try to hide the truth. People, people,\r\nservants, madam, _de vils laquais_ have seen you, as you went in there,\r\nto your----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena was crimson, her eyes were blazing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no need to hide anything,\xe2\x80\x99 she declared. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have visited\r\nthat house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly! Do you hear, do you hear, Anna Vassilyevna? And you know, I\r\npresume, who lives there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know; my husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were starting out of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My husband,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Elena; \xe2\x80\x98I am married to Dmitri Nikanorovitch\r\nInsarov.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You?--married?\xe2\x80\x99--was all Anna Vassilyevna could articulate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mamma.... Forgive me. A fortnight ago, we were secretly married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna fell back in her chair; Nikolai Artemyevitch stepped\r\ntwo paces back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Married! To that vagrant, that Montenegrin! the daughter of Nikolai\r\nStahov of the higher nobility married to a vagrant, a nobody, without\r\nher parents\xe2\x80\x99 sanction! And you imagine I shall let the matter rest,\r\nthat I shall not make a complaint, that I will allow you--that\r\nyou--that----To the nunnery with you, and he shall go to prison, to hard\r\nlabour! Anna Vassilyevna, inform her at once that you will cut off her\r\ninheritance!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nikolai Artemyevitch, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x99 moaned Anna Vassilyevna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And when and how was this done? Who married you? where? how? Good\r\nGod! what will all our friends think, what will the world say! And you,\r\nshameless hypocrite, could go on living under your parents\xe2\x80\x99 roof after\r\nsuch an act! Had you no fear of--the wrath of heaven?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena (she was trembling from head to foot but her voice was\r\nsteady), \xe2\x80\x98you are at liberty to do with me as you please, but you need\r\nnot accuse me of shamelessness, and hypocrisy. I did not want--to give\r\nyou pain before, but I should have had to tell you all myself in a few\r\ndays, because we are going away--my husband and I--from here next week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Going away? Where to?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To his own country, to Bulgaria.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To the Turks!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Anna Vassilyevna and fell into a swoon.\r\n\r\nElena ran to her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Away!\xe2\x80\x99 clamoured Nikolai Artemyevitch, seizing his daughter by the arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98away, unworthy girl!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut at that instant the door of the room opened, and a pale face with\r\nglittering eyes appeared: it was the face of Shubin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nikolai Artemyevitch!\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted at the top of his voice, \xe2\x80\x98Augustina\r\nChristianovna is here and is asking for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch turned round infuriated, threatening Shubin with\r\nhis fist; he stood still a minute and rapidly went out of the room.\r\n\r\nElena fell at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s feet and embraced her knees.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch was lying on his bed. A shirt without a collar, fastened\r\nwith a heavy stud enfolded his thick neck and fell in full flowing folds\r\nover the almost feminine contours of his chest, leaving visible a large\r\ncypress-wood cross and an amulet. His ample limbs were covered with the\r\nlightest bedclothes. On the little table by the bedside a candle was\r\nburning dimly beside a jug of kvas, and on the bed at Uvar Ivanovitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet was sitting Shubin in a dejected pose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he was saying meditatively, \xe2\x80\x98she is married and getting ready\r\nto go away. Your nephew was bawling and shouting for the benefit of the\r\nwhole house; he had shut himself up for greater privacy in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom, but not merely the maids and the footmen, the coachman even\r\ncould hear it all! Now he\xe2\x80\x99s just tearing and raving round; he all but\r\ngave me a thrashing, he\xe2\x80\x99s bringing a father\xe2\x80\x99s curse on the scene now,\r\nas cross as a bear with a sore head; but that\xe2\x80\x99s of no importance. Anna\r\nVassilyevna\xe2\x80\x99s crushed, but she\xe2\x80\x99s much more brokenhearted at her daughter\r\nleaving her than at her marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A mother,\xe2\x80\x99 he commented, \xe2\x80\x98to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your nephew,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98threatens to lodge a complaint with the\r\nMetropolitan and the General-Governor and the Minister, but it will end\r\nby her going. A happy thought to ruin his own daughter! He\xe2\x80\x99ll crow a\r\nlittle and then lower his colours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99d no right,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Uvar Ivanovitch, and he drank out of the\r\njug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure. But what a storm of criticism, gossip, and comments will be\r\nraised in Moscow! She\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid of them.... Besides she\xe2\x80\x99s above them.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s going away... and it\xe2\x80\x99s awful to think where she\xe2\x80\x99s going--to such a\r\ndistance, such a wilderness! What future awaits her there? I seem to\r\nsee her setting off from a posting station in a snow-storm with thirty\r\ndegrees of frost. She\xe2\x80\x99s leaving her country, and her people; but I\r\nunderstand her doing it. Whom is she leaving here behind her? What\r\npeople has she seen? Kurnatovsky and Bersenyev and our humble selves;\r\nand these are the best she\xe2\x80\x99s seen. What is there to regret about it? One\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99s bad; I\xe2\x80\x99m told her husband--the devil, how that word sticks in my\r\nthroat!--Insarov, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, is spitting blood; that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad lookout. I\r\nsaw him the other day: his face--you could model Brutus from it straight\r\noff. Do you know who Brutus was, Uvar Ivanovitch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is there to know? a man to be sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Precisely so: he was a \xe2\x80\x9cman.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes he\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful face, but unhealthy,\r\nvery unhealthy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For fighting... it makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Uvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For fighting it makes no difference, certainly; you are pleased to\r\nexpress yourself with great justice to-day; but for living it makes all\r\nthe difference. And you see she wants to live with him a little while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A youthful affair,\xe2\x80\x99 responded Uvar Ivanovitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, a youthful, glorious, bold affair. Death, life, conflict, defeat,\r\ntriumph, love, freedom, country.... Good God, grant as much to all of\r\nus! That\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing from sitting up to one\xe2\x80\x99s neck in a\r\nbog, and pretending it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to you, when in fact it really is\r\nall the same. While there--the strings are tuned to the highest pitch,\r\nto play to all the world or to break!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShubin\xe2\x80\x99s head sank on to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he resumed, after a prolonged silence, \xe2\x80\x98Insarov deserves her.\r\nWhat nonsense, though! No one deserves her... Insarov... Insarov ...\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of pretended modesty? We\xe2\x80\x99ll own he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine fellow, he\r\nstands on his own feet, though up to the present he has done no more\r\nthan we poor sinners; and are we such absolutely worthless dirt? Am I\r\nsuch dirt, Uvar Ivanovitch? Has God been hard on me in every way? Has He\r\ngiven me no talents, no abilities? Who knows, perhaps, the name of Pavel\r\nShubin will in time be a great name? You see that bronze farthing there\r\nlying on your table. Who knows; some day, perhaps in a century, that\r\nbronze will go to a statue of Pavel Shubin, raised in his honour by a\r\ngrateful posterity!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch leaned on his elbow and stared at the enthusiastic\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a long way off,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at last with his usual gesture; \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nspeaking of other people, why bring in yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O great philosopher of the Russian world!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Shubin, \xe2\x80\x98every word\r\nof yours is worth its weight in gold, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not to me but to you a\r\nstatue ought to be raised, and I would undertake it. There, as you are\r\nlying now, in that pose; one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know which is uppermost in it,\r\nsloth or strength! That\xe2\x80\x99s how I would cast you in bronze. You aimed a\r\njust reproach at my egoism and vanity! Yes! yes! it\xe2\x80\x99s useless talking\r\nof one\xe2\x80\x99s-self; it\xe2\x80\x99s useless bragging. We have no one yet, no men, look\r\nwhere you will. Everywhere--either small fry, nibblers, Hamlets on a\r\nsmall scale, self-absorbed, or darkness and subterranean chaos, or\r\nidle babblers and wooden sticks. Or else they are like this: they study\r\nthemselves to the most shameful detail, and are for ever feeling the\r\npulse of every sensation and reporting to themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\r\nfeel, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think.\xe2\x80\x9d A useful, rational occupation! No, if we\r\nonly had some sensible men among us, that girl, that delicate soul,\r\nwould not have run away from us, would not have slipped off like a fish\r\nto the water! What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of it, Uvar Ivanovitch? When will our\r\ntime come? When will men be born among us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us time,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Uvar Ivanovitch; \xe2\x80\x98they will be----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They will be? soil of our country! force of the black earth! thou hast\r\nsaid: they will be. Look, I will write down your words. But why are you\r\nputting out the candle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sleep; good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nShubin had spoken truly. The unexpected news of Elena\xe2\x80\x99s marriage nearly\r\nkilled Anna Vassilyevna. She took to her bed. Nikolai Artemyevitch\r\ninsisted on her not admitting her daughter to her presence; he seemed to\r\nbe enjoying the opportunity of showing himself in the fullest sense the\r\nmaster of the house, with all the authority of the head of the family;\r\nhe made an incessant uproar in the household, storming at the servants,\r\nand constantly saying: \xe2\x80\x98I will show you who I am, I will let you\r\nknow--you wait a little!\xe2\x80\x99 While he was in the house, Anna Vassilyevna\r\ndid not see Elena, and had to be content with Zoya, who waited on\r\nher very devotedly, but kept thinking to herself: \xe2\x80\x98_Diesen Insarof\r\nvorziehen--und wem?_\xe2\x80\x99 But directly Nikolai Artemyevitch went out--and\r\nthat happened pretty often, Augustina Christianovna had come back in\r\nsober earnest--Elena went to her mother, and a long time her mother\r\ngazed at her in silence and in tears.\r\n\r\nThis dumb reproach, more deeply than any other, cut Elena to the heart;\r\nat such moments she felt, not remorse, but a deep, boundless pity akin\r\nto remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma, dear mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 she would repeat, kissing her hands; \xe2\x80\x98what was I to\r\ndo? I\xe2\x80\x99m not to blame, I loved him, I could not have acted differently.\r\nThrow the blame on fate for throwing me with a man whom papa doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike, and who is taking me away from you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 Anna Vassilyevna cut her short, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of that. When I\r\nthink where you mean to go, my heart is ready to burst!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Elena, \xe2\x80\x98be comforted; at least, it might have\r\nbeen worse; I might have died.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, as it is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see you again. Either you will end\r\nyour days there in a tent somewhere\xe2\x80\x99--Anna Vassilyevna pictured Bulgaria\r\nas something after the nature of the Siberian swamps,--\xe2\x80\x98or I shall not\r\nsurvive the separation----\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that, mamma dearest, we shall see each other again, please\r\nGod. There are towns in Bulgaria just as there are here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine towns there, indeed! There is war going on there now; wherever\r\nyou go, I suppose they are firing cannons off all the while... Are you\r\nmeaning to set off soon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soon... if only papa. He means to appeal to the authorities; he\r\nthreatens to separate us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna turned her eyes heavenwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Lenotchka, he will not do that. I would not myself have consented\r\nto this marriage. I would have died first; but what\xe2\x80\x99s done can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nundone, and I will not let my daughter be disgraced.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo passed a few days. At last Anna Vassilyevna plucked up her courage,\r\nand one evening she shut herself up alone with her husband in her room.\r\nThe whole house was hushed to catch every sound. At first nothing was\r\nto be heard; then Nikolai Artemyevitch\xe2\x80\x99s voice began to tune up, then\r\na quarrel broke out, shouts were raised, even groans were discerned....\r\nAlready Shubin was plotting with the maids and Zoya to rush in to the\r\nrescue; but the uproar in the bedroom began by degrees to grow less,\r\npassed into quiet talk, and ceased. Only from time to time a faint sob\r\nwas to be heard, and then those, too, were still. There was the jingling\r\nof keys, the creak of a bureau being unfastened.... The door was opened,\r\nand Nikolai Artemyevitch appeared. He looked surlily at every one who\r\nmet him, and went out to the club; while Anna Vassilyevna sent for\r\nElena, embraced her warmly, and, with bitter tears flowing down her\r\ncheeks, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything is settled, he will not make a scandal, and there is nothing\r\nnow to hinder you from going--from abandoning us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will let Dmitri come to thank you?\xe2\x80\x99 Elena begged her mother, as\r\nsoon as the latter had been restored a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a little, my darling, I cannot bear yet to see the man who has\r\ncome between us. We shall have time before you go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Before we go,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Elena mournfully.\r\n\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch had consented \xe2\x80\x98not to make a scandal,\xe2\x80\x99 but Anna\r\nVassilyevna did not tell her daughter what a price he had put on his\r\nconsent. She did not tell her that she had promised to pay all his\r\ndebts, and had given him a thousand roubles down on the spot. Moreover,\r\nhe had declared decisively to Anna Vassilyevna that he had no wish to\r\nmeet Insarov, whom he persisted in calling \xe2\x80\x98the Montenegrin vagrant,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand when he got to the club, he began, quite without occasion, talking\r\nof Elena\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, to his partner at cards, a retired general of\r\nengineers. \xe2\x80\x98You have heard,\xe2\x80\x99 he observed with a show of carelessness,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my daughter, through the higher education, has gone and married a\r\nstudent.\xe2\x80\x99 The general looked at him through his spectacles, muttered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98H\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x99 and asked him what stakes would he play for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of departure drew near. November was already over; the latest\r\ndate for starting had come. Insarov had long ago made his preparations,\r\nand was burning with anxiety to get out of Moscow as soon as possible.\r\nAnd the doctor was urging him on. \xe2\x80\x98You need a warm climate,\xe2\x80\x99 he told\r\nhim; \xe2\x80\x98you will not get well here.\xe2\x80\x99 Elena, too, was fretting with\r\nimpatience; she was worried by Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s pallor, and his emaciation. She\r\noften looked with involuntary terror at his changed face. Her position\r\nin her parents\xe2\x80\x99 house had become insupportable. Her mother mourned over\r\nher, as over the dead, while her father treated her with contemptuous\r\ncoldness; the approaching separation secretly pained him too, but he\r\nregarded it as his duty--the duty of an offended father--to disguise his\r\nfeelings, his weakness. Anna Vassilyevna at last expressed a wish to see\r\nInsarov. He was taken up to her secretly by the back stairs. After he\r\nhad entered her room, for a long time she could not speak to him, she\r\ncould not even bring herself to look at him; he sat down near her chair,\r\nand waited, with quiet respectfulness, for her first word. Elena sat\r\ndown close, and held her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers. At last Anna Vassilyevna\r\nraised her eyes, saying: \xe2\x80\x98God is your judge, Dmitri Nikanorovitch\xe2\x80\x99--she\r\nstopped short: the reproaches died away on her lips. \xe2\x80\x98Why, you are ill,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe cried: \xe2\x80\x98Elena, your husband\xe2\x80\x99s ill!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been unwell, Anna Vassilyevna,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov; \xe2\x80\x98and even\r\nnow I am not quite strong yet: but I hope my native air will make me\r\nperfectly well again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah--Bulgaria!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Anna Vassilyevna, and she thought: \xe2\x80\x98Good God,\r\na Bulgarian, and dying; a voice as hollow as a drum; and eyes like\r\nsaucers, a perfect skeleton; his coat hanging loose on his shoulders,\r\nhis face as yellow as a guinea, and she\xe2\x80\x99s his wife--she loves him--it\r\nmust be a bad dream. But----\xe2\x80\x99 she checked herself at once: \xe2\x80\x98Dmitri\r\nNikanorovitch,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98are you absolutely, absolutely bound to go\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absolutely, Anna Vassilyevna.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, Dmitri Nikanorovitch, God grant you never have to go through what\r\nI am going through now. But you will promise me to take care of her--to\r\nlove her. You will not have to face poverty while I am living!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTears choked her voice. She opened her arms, and Elena and Insarov flung\r\nthemselves into her embrace.\r\n\r\nThe fatal day had come at last. It had been arranged that Elena should\r\nsay good-bye to her parents at home, and should start on the journey\r\nfrom Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. The departure was fixed for twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nAbout a quarter of an hour before the appointed time Bersenyev arrived.\r\nHe had expected to find Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s compatriots at his lodgings, anxious\r\nto see him off; but they had already gone before; and with them the\r\ntwo mysterious persons known to the reader (they had been witnesses at\r\nInsarov\xe2\x80\x99s wedding). The tailor met the \xe2\x80\x98kind gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99 with a bow; he,\r\npresumably, to drown his grief, but possibly to celebrate his delight at\r\ngetting the furniture, had been drinking heavily; his wife soon led him\r\naway. In the room everything was by this time ready; a trunk, tied\r\nup with cord, stood on the floor. Bersenyev sank into thought: many\r\nmemories came rushing upon him.\r\n\r\nTwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock had long ago struck; and the driver had already brought\r\nround the horses, but the \xe2\x80\x98young people\xe2\x80\x99 still did not appear. At last\r\nhurrying steps were heard on the stairs, and Elena came out escorted by\r\nInsarov and Shubin. Elena\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were red; she had left her mother lying\r\nunconscious; the parting had been terrible. Elena had not seen Bersenyev\r\nfor more than a week: he had been seldom of late at the Stahovs\xe2\x80\x99. She\r\nhad not expected to meet him; and crying, \xe2\x80\x98You! thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 she threw\r\nherself on his neck; Insarov, too, embraced him. A painful silence\r\nfollowed. What could these three say to one another? what were they\r\nfeeling in their hearts? Shubin realised the necessity of cutting short\r\neverything painful with light words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our trio has come together again,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, \xe2\x80\x98for the last time. Let us\r\nsubmit to the decrees of fate; speak of the past with kindness; and in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s name go forward to the new life! In God\xe2\x80\x99s name, on our distant\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x99 he began to hum, and stopped short. He felt suddenly ashamed\r\nand awkward. It is a sin to sing where the dead are lying: and at that\r\ninstant, in that room, the past of which he had spoken was dying, the\r\npast of the people met together in it. It was dying to be born again in\r\na new life--doubtless--still it was death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 began Insarov, turning to his wife, \xe2\x80\x98I think everything\r\nis done? Everything paid, and everything packed. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more\r\nexcept to take the box down.\xe2\x80\x99 He called his landlord.\r\n\r\nThe tailor came into the room, together with his wife and daughter. He\r\nlistened, slightly reeling, to Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s instructions, dragged the box\r\nup on to his shoulders, and ran quickly down the staircases, tramping\r\nheavily with his boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, after the Russian custom, we must sit down,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Insarov.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down; Bersenyev seated himself on the old sofa, Elena sat\r\nnext him; the landlady and her daughter squatted in the doorway. All\r\nwere silent; all smiled constrainedly, though no one knew why he was\r\nsmiling; each of them wanted to say something at parting, and each\r\n(except, of course, the landlady and her daughter, they were simply\r\nrolling their eyes) felt that at such moments it is only permissible to\r\nutter common-places, that any word of importance, of sense, or even of\r\ndeep feeling, would be somehow out of place, almost insincere. Insarov\r\nwas the first to get up, and he began crossing himself. \xe2\x80\x98Farewell, our\r\nlittle room!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried.\r\n\r\nThen came kisses, the sounding but cold kisses of leave-taking, good\r\nwishes--half expressed--for the journey, promises to write, the last,\r\nhalf-smothered words of farewell.\r\n\r\nElena, all in tears, had already taken her seat in the sledge; Insarov\r\nhad carefully wrapped her feet up in a rug; Shubin, Bersenyev, the\r\nlandlord, his wife, the little daughter, with the inevitable kerchief\r\non her head, the doorkeeper, a workman in a striped bedgown, were all\r\nstanding on the steps, when suddenly a splendid sledge, harnessed with\r\nspirited horses, flew into the courtyard, and from the sledge, shaking\r\nthe snow off the collar of his cloak, leapt Nikolai Artemyevitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not too late, thank God,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, running up to their sledge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, Elena, is our last parental benediction,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, bending down\r\nunder the hood, and taking from his pocket a little holy image, sewn in\r\na velvet bag, he put it round her neck. She began to sob, and kiss\r\nhis hands; and the coachman meantime pulled out of the forepart of the\r\nsledge a half bottle of champagne, and three glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Nikolai Artemyevitch--and his own tears were trickling on\r\nto the beaver collar of his cloak--\xe2\x80\x98we must drink to--good journey--good\r\nwishes----\xe2\x80\x99 He began pouring out the champagne: his hands were shaking,\r\nthe foam rose over the edge and fell on to the snow. He took one glass,\r\nand gave the other two to Elena and Insarov, who by now was seated\r\nbeside her. \xe2\x80\x98God give you----\xe2\x80\x99 began Nikolai Artemyevitch, and he could\r\nnot go on: he drank off the wine; they, too, drank off their glasses.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you should drink, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, turning to Shubin and\r\nBersenyev, but at that instant the driver started the horses. Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch ran beside the sledge. \xe2\x80\x98Mind and write to us,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in\r\na broken voice. Elena put out her head, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, papa, Andrei\r\nPetrovitch, Pavel Yakovlitch, good-bye all, good-bye, Russia!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ndropped back in her place. The driver flourished his whip, and gave a\r\nwhistle; the sledge, its runners crunching on the snow, turned out of\r\nthe gates to the right and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a bright April day. On the broad lagoon which separates Venice\r\nfrom the narrow strip of accumulated sea sand, called the Lido, a\r\ngondola was gliding--swaying rhythmically at every push made by the\r\ngondolier as he leaned on the big pole. Under its low awning, on soft\r\nleather cushions, were sitting Elena and Insarov.\r\n\r\nElena\xe2\x80\x99s features had not changed much since the day of her departure\r\nfrom Moscow, but their expression was different; it was more thoughtful\r\nand more severe, and her eyes had a bolder look. Her whole figure had\r\ngrown finer and more mature, and the hair seemed to lie in greater\r\nthickness and luxuriance along her white brow and her fresh cheeks. Only\r\nabout her lips, when she was not smiling, a scarcely perceptible line\r\nshowed the presence of a hidden constant anxiety. In Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s face, on\r\nthe contrary, the expression had remained the same, but his features had\r\nundergone a cruel change. He had grown thin, old, pale and bent; he was\r\nconstantly coughing a short dry cough, and his sunken eyes shone with\r\na strange brilliance. On the way from Russia, Insarov had lain ill for\r\nalmost two months at Vienna, and only at the end of March had he been\r\nable to come with his wife to Venice; from there he was hoping to\r\nmake his way through Zara to Servia, to Bulgaria; the other roads were\r\nclosed. The war was now at its height about the Danube; England and\r\nFrance had declared war on Russia, all the Slavonic countries were\r\nroused and were preparing for an uprising.\r\n\r\nThe gondola put in to the inner shore of the Lido. Elena and Insarov\r\nwalked along the narrow sandy road planted with sickly trees (every year\r\nthey plant them and every year they die) to the outer shore of the Lido,\r\nto the sea.\r\n\r\nThey walked along the beach. The Adriatic rolled its muddy-blue waves\r\nbefore them; they raced into the shore, foaming and hissing, and drew\r\nback again, leaving fine shells and fragments of seaweed on the beach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a desolate place!\xe2\x80\x99 observed Elena \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s too cold for\r\nyou here, but I guess why you wanted to come here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cold!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Insarov with a rapid and bitter smile, \xe2\x80\x98I shall be a\r\nfine soldier, if I\xe2\x80\x99m to be afraid of the cold. I came here... I will\r\ntell you why. I look across that sea, and I feel as though here, I am\r\nnearer my country. It is there, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, stretching out his\r\nhand to the East, \xe2\x80\x98the wind blows from there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will not this wind bring the ship you are expecting?\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena. \xe2\x80\x98See,\r\nthere is a white sail, is not that it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov gazed seaward into the distance to where Elena was pointing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Renditch promised to arrange everything for us within a week,\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98we can rely on him, I think.... Did you hear, Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 he added with\r\nsudden animation, \xe2\x80\x98they say the poor Dalmatian fishermen have sacrificed\r\ntheir dredging weights--you know the leads they weigh their nets with\r\nfor letting them down to the bottom--to make bullets! They have no\r\nmoney, they only just live by fishing; but they have joyfully given up\r\ntheir last property, and now are starving. What a nation!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Aufgepasst_!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted a haughty voice behind them. The heavy thud of\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs was heard, and an Austrian officer in a short grey tunic\r\nand a green cap galloped past them--they had scarcely time to get out of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nInsarov looked darkly after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was not to blame,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98you know, they have no other place\r\nwhere they can ride.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was not to blame,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov \xe2\x80\x98but he made my blood boil with\r\nhis shout, his moustaches, his cap, his whole appearance. Let us go\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, let us go back, Dmitri. It\xe2\x80\x99s really cold here. You did not take\r\ncare of yourself after your Moscow illness, and you had to pay for that\r\nat Vienna. Now you must be more cautious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov did not answer, but the same bitter smile passed over his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you like,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena went on, \xe2\x80\x98we will go along to the Canal Grande.\r\nWe have not seen Venice properly, you know, all the while we have been\r\nhere. And in the evening we are going to the theatre; I have two tickets\r\nfor the stalls. They say there\xe2\x80\x99s a new opera being given. If you like,\r\nwe will give up to-day to one another; we will forget politics and\r\nwar and everything, we will forget everything but that we are alive,\r\nbreathing, thinking together; that we are one for ever--would you like\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you would like it, Elena,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98it follows that I\r\nshould like it too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew that,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Elena with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98come, let us go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went back to the gondola, took their seats, told the gondolier to\r\ntake them without hurry along the Canal Grande.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not seen Venice in April knows all the unutterable\r\nfascinations of that magic town. The softness and mildness of spring\r\nharmonise with Venice, just as the glaring sun of summer suits the\r\nmagnificence of Genoa, and as the gold and purple of autumn suits the\r\ngrand antiquity of Rome. The beauty of Venice, like the spring, touches\r\nthe soul and moves it to desire; it frets and tortures the inexperienced\r\nheart like the promise of a coming bliss, mysterious but not elusive.\r\nEverything in it is bright, and everything is wrapt in a drowsy,\r\ntangible mist, as it were, of the hush of love; everything in it is so\r\nsilent, and everything in it is kindly; everything in it is feminine,\r\nfrom its name upwards. It has well been given the name of \xe2\x80\x98the fair\r\ncity.\xe2\x80\x99 Its masses of palaces and churches stand out light and wonderful\r\nlike the graceful dream of a young god; there is something magical,\r\nsomething strange and bewitching in the greenish-grey light and silken\r\nshimmer of the silent water of the canals, in the noiseless gliding of\r\nthe gondolas, in the absence of the coarse din of a town, the coarse\r\nrattling, and crashing, and uproar. \xe2\x80\x98Venice is dead, Venice is\r\ndeserted,\xe2\x80\x99 her citizens will tell you, but perhaps this last charm--the\r\ncharm of decay--was not vouchsafed her in the very heyday of the flower\r\nand majesty of her beauty. He who has not seen her, knows her not;\r\nneither Canaletto nor Guardi (to say nothing of later painters) has been\r\nable to convey the silvery tenderness of the atmosphere, the horizon so\r\nclose, yet so elusive, the divine harmony of exquisite lines and melting\r\ncolours. One who has outlived his life, who has been crushed by it,\r\nshould not visit Venice; she will be cruel to him as the memory of\r\nunfulfilled dreams of early days; but sweet to one whose strength is at\r\nits full, who is conscious of happiness; let him bring his bliss under\r\nher enchanted skies; and however bright it may be, Venice will make it\r\nmore golden with her unfading splendour.\r\n\r\nThe gondola in which Insarov and Elena were sitting passed _Riva dei\r\nSchiavoni_, the palace of the Doges, and Piazzetta, and entered the\r\nGrand Canal. On both sides stretched marble palaces; they seemed to\r\nfloat softly by, scarcely letting the eye seize or absorb their beauty.\r\nElena felt herself deeply happy; in the perfect blue of her heavens\r\nthere was only one dark cloud--and it was in the far distance; Insarov\r\nwas much better that day. They glided as far as the acute angle of the\r\nRialto and turned back. Elena was afraid of the chill of the churches\r\nfor Insarov; but she remembered the academy _delle Belle Arti_, and told\r\nthe gondolier to go towards it. They quickly walked through all the\r\nrooms of that little museum. Being neither connoisseurs nor dilettantes,\r\nthey did not stop before every picture; they put no constraint on\r\nthemselves; a spirit of light-hearted gaiety came over them. Everything\r\nseemed suddenly very entertaining. (Children know this feeling very\r\nwell.) To the great scandal of three English visitors, Elena laughed\r\ntill she cried over the St Mark of Tintoretto, skipping down from the\r\nsky like a frog into the water, to deliver the tortured slave; Insarov\r\nin his turn fell into raptures over the back and legs of the sturdy man\r\nin the green cloak, who stands in the foreground of Titian\xe2\x80\x99s Ascension\r\nand holds his arms outstretched after the Madonna; but the Madonna--a\r\nsplendid, powerful woman, calmly and majestically making her way towards\r\nthe bosom of God the Father--impressed both Insarov and Elena; they\r\nliked, too, the austere and reverent painting of the elder Cima da\r\nConegliano. As they were leaving the academy, they took another look\r\nat the Englishmen behind them--with their long rabbit-like teeth and\r\ndrooping whiskers--and laughed; they glanced at their gondolier with his\r\nabbreviated jacket and short breeches--and laughed; they caught sight of\r\na woman selling old clothes with a knob of grey hair on the very top\r\nof her head--and laughed more than ever; they looked into one another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface--and went off into peals of laughter, and directly they had sat\r\ndown in the gondola, they clasped each other\xe2\x80\x99s hand in a close, close\r\ngrip. They reached their hotel, ran into their room, and ordered dinner\r\nto be brought in. Their gaiety did not desert them at dinner. They\r\npressed each other to eat, drank to the health of their friends in\r\nMoscow, clapped their hands at the waiter for a delicious dish of fish,\r\nand kept asking him for live _frutti di mare_; the waiter shrugged his\r\nshoulders and scraped with his feet, but when he had left them, he shook\r\nhis head and once even muttered with a sigh, _poveretti_! (poor things!)\r\nAfter dinner they set off for the theatre.\r\n\r\nThey were giving an opera of Verdi\xe2\x80\x99s, which though, honestly speaking,\r\nrather vulgar, has already succeeded in making the round of all the\r\nEuropean theatres, an opera, well-known among Russians, _La Traviata_.\r\nThe season in Venice was over, and none of the singers rose above the\r\nlevel of mediocrity; every one shouted to the best of their abilities.\r\nThe part of Violetta was performed by an artist, of no renown, and\r\njudging by the cool reception given her by the public, not a favourite,\r\nbut she was not destitute of talent. She was a young, and not very\r\npretty, black-eyed girl with an unequal and already overstrained voice.\r\nHer dress was ill-chosen and naively gaudy; her hair was hidden in a\r\nred net, her dress of faded blue satin was too tight for her, and thick\r\nSwedish gloves reached up to her sharp elbows. Indeed, how could she,\r\nthe daughter of some Bergamese shepherd, know how Parisian _dames aux\r\ncam\xc3\xa9lias_ dress! And she did not understand how to move on the stage;\r\nbut there was much truth and artless simplicity in her acting, and she\r\nsang with that passion of expression and rhythm which is only vouchsafed\r\nto Italians. Elena and Insarov were sitting alone together in a dark box\r\nclose to the stage; the mirthful mood which had come upon them in the\r\nacademy _delle Belle Arti_ had not yet passed off. When the father of\r\nthe unhappy young man who had fallen into the snares of the enchantress\r\ncame on to the stage in a yellow frock-coat and a dishevelled white wig,\r\nopened his mouth awry, and losing his presence of mind before he had\r\nbegun, only brought out a faint bass _tremolo_, they almost burst into\r\nlaughter. ... But Violetta\xe2\x80\x99s acting impressed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They hardly clap that poor girl at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elena, \xe2\x80\x98but I like her\r\na thousand times better than some conceited second-rate celebrity who\r\nwould grimace and attitudinise all the while for effect. This girl seems\r\nas though it were all in earnest; look, she pays no attention to the\r\npublic.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInsarov bent over the edge of the box, and looked attentively at\r\nVioletta.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he commented, \xe2\x80\x98she is in earnest; she\xe2\x80\x99s on the brink of the grave\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena was mute.\r\n\r\nThe third act began. The curtain rose--Elena shuddered at the sight of\r\nthe bed, the drawn curtains, the glass of medicine, the shaded lamps.\r\nShe recalled the near past. \xe2\x80\x98What of the future? What of the present?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nflashed across her mind. As though in response to her thought, the\r\nartist\xe2\x80\x99s mimic cough on the stage was answered in the box by the hoarse,\r\nterribly real cough of Insarov. Elena stole a glance at him, and at once\r\ngave her features a calm and untroubled expression; Insarov understood\r\nher, and he began himself to smile, and softly to hum the tune of the\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nBut he was soon quiet. Violetta\xe2\x80\x99s acting became steadily better,\r\nand freer. She had thrown aside everything subsidiary, everything\r\nsuperfluous, and _found herself_; a rare, a lofty delight for an artist!\r\nShe had suddenly crossed the limit, which it is impossible to define,\r\nbeyond which is the abiding place of beauty. The audience was thrilled\r\nand astonished. The plain girl with the broken voice began to get a hold\r\non it, to master it. And the singer\xe2\x80\x99s voice even did not sound broken\r\nnow; it had gained mellowness and strength. Alfredo made his entrance;\r\nVioletta\xe2\x80\x99s cry of happiness almost raised that storm in the audience\r\nknown as _fanatismo_, beside which all the applause of our northern\r\naudiences is nothing. A brief interval passed--and again the audience\r\nwere in transports. The duet began, the best thing in the opera, in\r\nwhich the composer has succeeded in expressing all the pathos of the\r\nsenseless waste of youth, the final struggle of despairing, helpless\r\nlove. Caught up and carried along by the general sympathy, with tears of\r\nartistic delight and real suffering in her eyes, the singer let\r\nherself be borne along on the wave of passion within her; her face\r\nwas transfigured, and in the presence of the threatening signs of fast\r\napproaching death, the words: \xe2\x80\x98_Lascia mi vivero--morir si giovane_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(let me live--to die so young!) burst from her in such a tempest of\r\nprayer rising to heaven, that the whole theatre shook with frenzied\r\napplause and shouts of delight.\r\n\r\nElena felt cold all over. Softly her hand sought Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s, found it,\r\nand clasped it tightly. He responded to its pressure; but she did not\r\nlook at him, nor he at her. Very different was the clasp of hands with\r\nwhich they had greeted each other in the gondola a few hours before.\r\n\r\nAgain they glided along the Canal Grande towards their hotel. Night had\r\nset in now, a clear, soft night. The same palaces met them, but they\r\nseemed different. Those that were lighted up by the moon shone with\r\npale gold, and in this pale light all details of ornaments and lines of\r\nwindows and balconies seemed lost; they stood out more clearly in the\r\nbuildings that were wrapped in a light veil of unbroken shadow.\r\nThe gondolas, with their little red lamps, seemed to flit past\r\nmore noiselessly and swiftly than ever; their steel beaks flashed\r\nmysteriously, mysteriously their oars rose and fell over the ripples\r\nstirred by little silvery fish; here and there was heard the brief,\r\nsubdued call of a gondolier (they never sing now); scarcely another\r\nsound was to be heard. The hotel where Insarov and Elena were staying\r\nwas on the _Riva dei Schiavoni_; before they reached it they left the\r\ngondola, and walked several times round the Square of St. Mark, under\r\nthe arches, where numbers of holiday makers were gathered before the\r\ntiny cafes. There is a special sweetness in wandering alone with one you\r\nlove, in a strange city among strangers; everything seems beautiful and\r\nfull of meaning, you feel peace and goodwill to all men, you wish all\r\nthe same happiness that fills your heart. But Elena could not now give\r\nherself up without a care to the sense of her happiness; her heart could\r\nnot regain its calm after the emotions that had so lately shaken it;\r\nand Insarov, as he walked by the palace of the Doges, pointed without\r\nspeaking to the mouths of the Austrian cannons, peeping out from the\r\nlower arches, and pulled his hat down over his eyes. By now he felt\r\ntired, and, with a last glance at the church of St. Mark, at its cupola,\r\nwhere on the bluish lead bright patches of phosphorescent light shone in\r\nthe rays of the moon, they turned slowly homewards.\r\n\r\nTheir little room looked out on to the lagoon, which stretches from the\r\n_Riva del Schiavoni_ to the Giudecca. Almost facing their hotel rose the\r\nslender tower of S. George; high against the sky on the right shone the\r\ngolden ball of the Customs House; and, decked like a bride, stood the\r\nloveliest of the churches, the _Redentore_ of Palladio; on the left\r\nwere the black masts and rigging of ships, the funnels of steamers;\r\na half-furled sail hung in one place like a great wing, and the flags\r\nscarcely stirred. Insarov sat down at the window, but Elena did not\r\nlet him admire the view for long; he seemed suddenly feverish, he was\r\novercome by consuming weakness. She put him to bed, and, waiting till he\r\nhad fallen asleep, she returned to the window. Oh, how still and kindly\r\nwas the night, what dovelike softness breathed in the deep-blue air!\r\nEvery suffering, every sorrow surely must be soothed to slumber under\r\nthat clear sky, under that pure, holy light! \xe2\x80\x98O God,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Elena,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98why must there be death, why is there separation, and disease and\r\ntears? or else, why this beauty, this sweet feeling of hope, this\r\nsoothing sense of an abiding refuge, an unchanging support, an\r\neverlasting protection? What is the meaning of this smiling, blessing\r\nsky; this happy, sleeping earth? Can it be that all that is only in us,\r\nand that outside us is eternal cold and silence? Can it be that we are\r\nalone... alone... and there, on all sides, in all those unattainable\r\ndepths and abysses--nothing is akin to us; all, all is strange and apart\r\nfrom us? Why, then, have we this desire for, this delight in prayer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(_Morir si giovane_ was echoing in her heart.)... \xe2\x80\x98Is it impossible,\r\nthen, to propitiate, to avert, to save... O God! is it impossible to\r\nbelieve in miracle?\xe2\x80\x99 She dropped her head on to her clasped hands.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered. \xe2\x80\x98Indeed enough! I have been happy not for\r\nmoments only, not for hours, not for whole days even, but for whole\r\nweeks together. And what right had I to happiness?\xe2\x80\x99 She felt terror at\r\nthe thought of her happiness. \xe2\x80\x98What, if that cannot be?\xe2\x80\x99 she thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, if it is not granted for nothing? Why, it has been heaven... and\r\nwe are mortals, poor sinful mortals.... _Morir si giovane_. Oh, dark\r\nomen, away! It\xe2\x80\x99s not only for me his life is needed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what, if it is a punishment,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought again; \xe2\x80\x98what, if we must\r\nnow pay the penalty of our guilt in full? My conscience was silent, it\r\nis silent now, but is that a proof of innocence? O God, can we be so\r\nguilty! Canst Thou who hast created this night, this sky, wish to punish\r\nus for having loved each other? If it be so, if he has sinned, if I have\r\nsinned,\xe2\x80\x99 she added with involuntary force, \xe2\x80\x98grant that he, O God, grant\r\nthat we both, may die at least a noble, glorious death--there, on the\r\nplains of his country, not here in this dark room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the grief of my poor, lonely mother?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked herself, and was\r\nbewildered, and could find no answer to her question. Elena did not know\r\nthat every man\xe2\x80\x99s happiness is built on the unhappiness of another, that\r\neven his advantage, his comfort, like a statue needs a pedestal, the\r\ndisadvantage, the discomfort of others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Renditch!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Insarov in his sleep.\r\n\r\nElena went up to him on tiptoe, bent over him, and wiped the\r\nperspiration from his face. He tossed a little on his pillow, and was\r\nstill again.\r\n\r\nShe went back again to the window, and again her thoughts took\r\npossession of her. She began to argue with herself, to assure herself\r\nthat there was no reason to be afraid. She even began to feel ashamed\r\nof her weakness. \xe2\x80\x98Is there any danger? isn\xe2\x80\x99t he better?\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, if we had not been at the theatre to-day, all this would never\r\nhave entered my head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that instant she saw high above the water a white sea-gull; some\r\nfisherman had scared it, it seemed, for it flew noiselessly with\r\nuncertain course, as though seeking a spot where it could alight. \xe2\x80\x98Come,\r\nif it flies here,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Elena, \xe2\x80\x98it will be a good omen.\xe2\x80\x99 ... The\r\nsea-gull flew round in a circle, folded its wings, and, as though it had\r\nbeen shot, dropped with a plaintive cry in the distance behind a dark\r\nship. Elena shuddered; then she was ashamed of having shuddered, and,\r\nwithout undressing, she lay down on the bed beside Insarov, who was\r\nbreathing quickly and heavily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nInsarov waked late with a dull pain in his head, and a feeling, as he\r\nexpressed it, of disgusting weakness all over. He got up however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Renditch has not come?\xe2\x80\x99 was his first question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Elena, and she handed him the latest number of the\r\n_Osservatore Triestino_, in which there was much upon the war, the Slav\r\nProvinces, and the Principalities. Insarov began reading it; she busied\r\nherself in getting some coffee ready for him. Some one knocked at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Renditch,\xe2\x80\x99 both thought at once, but a voice said in Russian, \xe2\x80\x98May I\r\ncome in?\xe2\x80\x99 Elena and Insarov looked at each other in astonishment; and\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, an elegantly dressed young man entered\r\nthe room, with a small sharp-featured face, and bright little eyes. He\r\nwas beaming all over, as though he had just won a fortune or heard a\r\nmost delightful piece of news.\r\n\r\nInsarov got up from his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t recognise me,\xe2\x80\x99 began the stranger, going up to him with an\r\neasy air, and bowing politely to Elena, \xe2\x80\x98Lupoyarov, do you remember, we\r\nmet at Moscow at the E----\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, at the E----\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, to be sure! I beg you to present me to your wife. Madam,\r\nI have always had the profoundest respect for Dmitri Vassilyevitch\xe2\x80\x99 (he\r\ncorrected himself)--\xe2\x80\x98for Nikanor Vassilyevitch, and am very happy\r\nto have the pleasure at last of making your acquaintance. Fancy,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued, turning to Insarov, \xe2\x80\x98I only heard yesterday evening that\r\nyou were here. I am staying at this hotel too. What a city! Venice is\r\npoetry--that\xe2\x80\x99s the only word for it! But one thing\xe2\x80\x99s really awful: the\r\ncursed Austrians meeting one at every turn! ah, these Austrians! By the\r\nway, have you heard, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a decisive battle on the Danube: three\r\nhundred Turkish officers killed, Silistria taken; Servia has declared\r\nits independence. You, as a patriot, ought to be in transports, oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? Even my Slavonic blood\xe2\x80\x99s positively on fire! I advise you to be\r\nmore careful, though; I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced there\xe2\x80\x99s a watch kept on you. The\r\nspies here are something awful! A suspicious-looking man came up to me\r\nyesterday and asked: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Russian?\xe2\x80\x9d I told him I was a Dane. But\r\nyou seem unwell, dear Nikanor Vassilyevitch. You ought to see a doctor;\r\nmadam, you ought to make your husband see a doctor. Yesterday I ran\r\nthrough the palaces and churches, as though I were crazy. I suppose\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the palace of the Doges? What magnificence everywhere!\r\nEspecially that great hall and Marino Faliero\xe2\x80\x99s place: there\xe2\x80\x99s an\r\ninscription: _decapitati pro criminibus_. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the famous\r\nprisons too; that threw me into indignation, you may fancy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always,\r\nyou remember perhaps, taken an interest in social questions, and taken\r\nsides against aristocracy--well, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I should like to send the\r\nchampions of aristocracy--to those dungeons. How well Byron said: _I\r\nstood in Venice on the Bridge of Sighs_; though he was an aristocrat\r\ntoo. I was always for progress--the younger generation are all for\r\nprogress. And what do you say to the Anglo-French business? We shall see\r\nwhether they can do much, Boustrapa and Palmerston. You know Palmerston\r\nhas been made Prime Minister. No, say what you like, the Russian fist is\r\nnot to be despised. He\xe2\x80\x99s awfully deep that Boustrapa! If you like I will\r\nlend you _Les Ch\xc3\xa2timents de Victor Hugo_--it\xe2\x80\x99s marvellous--_L\xe2\x80\x99avenir,\r\nle gendarme de Dieu_--rather boldly written, but what force in it,\r\nwhat force! That was a fine saying, too, of Prince Vyazemsky\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x9cEurope\r\nrepeats: Bash-Kadik-Lar keeping an eye on Sinope.\xe2\x80\x9d I adore poetry. I\r\nhave Proudhon\xe2\x80\x99s last work, too--I have everything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\r\nfeel, but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad of the war; only as I\xe2\x80\x99m not required at home, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing from here to Florence, and to Rome. France I can\xe2\x80\x99t go to--so I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthinking of Spain--the women there, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, are marvellous! only such\r\npoverty, and so many insects. I would be off to California--we Russians\r\nare ready to do anything--but I promised an editor to study the question\r\nof the commerce of the Mediterranean in detail. You will say that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan uninteresting, special subject, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just what we need,\r\nspecialists; we have philosophised enough, now we need the practical,\r\nthe practical. But you are very unwell, Nikanor Vassilyevitch, I am\r\ntiring you, perhaps, but still I must stay a little longer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd for a long time Lupoyarov still babbled on in the same way, and, as\r\nhe went away, he promised to come again.\r\n\r\nWorn out by the unexpected visit, Insarov lay down on the sofa.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So this,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, mournfully looking at Elena, \xe2\x80\x98is your younger\r\ngeneration! There are plenty who show off, and give themselves airs,\r\nwhile at heart they are as empty chatterboxes as that worthy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena made no reply to her husband; at that instant she was far more\r\nconcerned at Insarov\xe2\x80\x99s weakness than at the character of the whole\r\nyounger generation in Russia. She sat down near him, and took up some\r\nwork. He closed his eyes, and lay without moving, white and thin. Elena\r\nglanced at his sharp profile, at his emaciated hands, and felt a sudden\r\npang of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dmitri,\xe2\x80\x99 she began.\r\n\r\nHe started. \xe2\x80\x98Eh? Has Renditch come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not yet--but what do you think--you are in a fever, you are really not\r\nquite well, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we send for a doctor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That wretched gossip has frightened you. There\xe2\x80\x99s no necessity. I\r\nwill rest a little, and it will pass off. After dinner we will go out\r\nagain--somewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed. Insarov still lay on the sofa, but he could not sleep,\r\nthough he did not open his eyes. Elena did not leave his side; she had\r\ndropped her work upon her knee, and did not stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go to sleep?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait a little.\xe2\x80\x99 He took her hand, and placed it under his head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There--that is nice. Wake me at once directly Renditch comes. If\r\nhe says the ship is ready, we will start at once. We ought to pack\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Packing won\xe2\x80\x99t take long,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Elena.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That fellow babbled something about a battle, about Servia,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nInsarov, after a short interval. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose he made it all up. But we\r\nmust, we must start. We can\xe2\x80\x99t lose time. Be ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep, and everything was still in the room.\r\n\r\nElena let her head rest against the back of her chair, and gazed a long\r\nwhile out of the window. The weather had changed for the worse; the wind\r\nhad risen. Great white clouds were scudding over the sky, a slender mast\r\nwas swaying in the distance, a long streamer, with a red cross on it,\r\nkept fluttering, falling, and fluttering again. The pendulum of the\r\nold-fashioned clock ticked drearily, with a kind of melancholy whirr.\r\nElena shut her eyes. She had slept badly all night; gradually she, too,\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nShe had a strange dream. She thought she was floating in a boat on the\r\nTsaritsino lake with some unknown people. They did not speak, but sat\r\nmotionless, no one was rowing; the boat was moving by itself. Elena\r\nwas not afraid, but she felt dreary; she wanted to know who were these\r\npeople, and why she was with them? She looked and the lake grew broader,\r\nthe banks vanished--now it was not a lake but a stormy sea: immense blue\r\nsilent waves rocked the boat majestically; something menacing, roaring\r\nwas rising from the depths; her unknown companions jumped up, shrieking,\r\nwringing their hands... Elena recognised their faces; her father\r\nwas among them. But a kind of white whirlwind came flying over the\r\nwaves--everything was turning round, everything was confounded together.\r\n\r\nElena looked about her; as before, all around was white; but it was\r\nsnow, snow, boundless plains of snow. And she was not now in a boat, but\r\ntravelling, as she had come from Moscow, in a sledge; she was not alone;\r\nby her side was sitting a little creature muffled in an old cloak; Elena\r\nlooked closely; it was Katya, her poor little friend. Elena was seized\r\nwith terror. \xe2\x80\x98Why, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she dead?\xe2\x80\x99 she thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Katya, where are we going together?\xe2\x80\x99 Katya did not answer, and nestled\r\nherself closer in her little cloak; she was freezing. Elena too was\r\ncold; she looked along the road into the distance; far away a town could\r\nbe seen through the fine drifting snow. High white towers with silvery\r\ncupolas... \xe2\x80\x98Katya, Katya, is it Moscow? No,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Elena, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nSolovetsky Monastery; it\xe2\x80\x99s full of little narrow cells like a beehive;\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s stifling, cramping there--and Dmitri\xe2\x80\x99s shut up there. I must rescue\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99... Suddenly a grey, yawning abyss opened before her. The sledge\r\nwas falling, Katya was laughing. \xe2\x80\x98Elena, Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 came a voice from the\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 sounded distinctly in her ears. She raised her head quickly,\r\nturned round, and was stupefied: Insarov, white as snow, the snow of her\r\ndream, had half risen from the sofa, and was staring at her with large,\r\nbright, dreadful eyes. His hair hung in disorder on his forehead and his\r\nlips parted strangely. Horror, mingled with an anguish of tenderness,\r\nwas expressed on his suddenly transfigured face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Elena!\xe2\x80\x99 he articulated, \xe2\x80\x98I am dying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe fell with a scream on her knees, and clung to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Insarov: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m dying... Good-bye, my poor girl!\r\ngood-bye, my country!\xe2\x80\x99 and he fell backwards on to the sofa.\r\n\r\nElena rushed out of the room, began calling for help; a waiter ran for a\r\ndoctor. Elena clung to Insarov.\r\n\r\nAt that instant in the doorway appeared a broad-shouldered, sunburnt\r\nman, in a stout frieze coat and a low oil-skin hat. He stood still in\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Renditch!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Elena, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s you! Look, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he\xe2\x80\x99s ill!\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong? Good God! He went out yesterday, he was talking to me just\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRenditch said nothing and only moved on one side. There slipped quickly\r\npast him a little figure in a wig and spectacles; it was a doctor living\r\nin the same hotel. He went up to Insarov.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Signora,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after the lapse of a few minutes, \xe2\x80\x98the foreign\r\ngentleman is dead--_il Signore forestiere e morte_--of aneurism in\r\ncombination with disease of the lungs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the same room, Renditch was standing at the window;\r\nbefore him, wrapped in a shawl, sat Elena. In the next room, Insarov\r\nlay in his coffin. Elena\xe2\x80\x99s face was both scared and lifeless; two lines\r\ncould be seen on her forehead between her eyebrows; they gave a strained\r\nexpression to her fixed eyes. In the window lay an open letter from Anna\r\nVassilyevna. She begged her daughter to come to Moscow if only for a\r\nmonth, complained of her loneliness, and of Nikolai Artemyevitch, sent\r\ngreetings to Insarov, inquired after his health, and begged him to spare\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nRenditch was a Dalmatian, a sailor, with whom Insarov had become\r\nacquainted during his wanderings in his own country, and whom he had\r\nsought out in Venice. He was a dry, gruff man, full of daring and\r\ndevoted to the Slavonic cause. He despised the Turks and hated the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long must you remain at Venice?\xe2\x80\x99 Elena asked him in Italian. And\r\nher voice was as lifeless as her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One day for freighting and not to rouse suspicions, and then straight\r\nto Zara. I shall have sad news for our countrymen. They have long been\r\nexpecting him; they rested their hopes on him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They rested their hopes on him,\xe2\x80\x99 Elena repeated mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When will you bury him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Renditch.\r\n\r\nElena not at once replied, \xe2\x80\x98To-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To-morrow? I will stop; I should like to throw a handful of earth into\r\nhis grave. And you will want help. But it would have been better for him\r\nto lie in Slavonic earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nElena looked at Renditch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98take me and him and carry us across to the other\r\nside of the sea, away from here. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that possible?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRenditch considered: \xe2\x80\x98Possible certainly, but difficult. We shall have\r\nto come into collision with the damned authorities here. But supposing\r\nwe arrange all that and bury him there, how am I to bring you back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need not bring me back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? where will you stop?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall find some place for myself; only take us, take me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRenditch scratched the back of his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know best; but it\xe2\x80\x99s all very difficult. I will, I will try; and you\r\nexpect me here in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went away. Elena passed into the next room, leaned against the wall,\r\nand for a long time stood there as though turned to stone. Then she\r\ndropped on her knees, but she could not pray. There was no reproach in\r\nher heart; she did not dare to question God\xe2\x80\x99s will, to ask why He had\r\nnot spared, pitied, saved, why He had punished her beyond her guilt,\r\nif she were guilty. Each of us is guilty by the fact that he lives; and\r\nthere is no one so great a thinker, so great a benefactor of mankind\r\nthat he might hope to have a right to live for the service he has\r\ndone.... Still Elena could not pray; she was a stone.\r\n\r\nThe same night a broad-bottomed boat put off from the hotel where the\r\nInsarovs lived. In the boat sat Elena with Renditch and beside them\r\nstood a long box covered with a black cloth. They rowed for about an\r\nhour, and at last reached a small two-masted ship, which was riding at\r\nanchor at the very entrance of the harbour. Elena and Renditch got\r\ninto the ship; the sailors carried in the box. At midnight a storm had\r\narisen, but early in the morning the ship had passed out of the Lido.\r\nDuring the day the storm raged with fearful violence, and experienced\r\nseamen in Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s offices shook their heads and prophesied no good.\r\nThe Adriatic Sea between Venice, Trieste, and the Dalmatian coast is\r\nparticularly dangerous.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after Elena\xe2\x80\x99s departure from Vienna, Anna Vassilyevna\r\nreceived the following letter in Moscow:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My DEAR PARENTS.--I am saying goodbye to you for ever. You will never\r\nsee me again. Dmitri died yesterday. Everything is over for me. To-day\r\nI am setting off with his body to Zara. I will bury him, and what will\r\nbecome of me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But now I have no country but Dmitri\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountry. There, they are preparing for revolution, they are getting\r\nready for war. I will join the Sisters of Mercy; I will tend the sick\r\nand the wounded. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will become of me, but even after\r\nDmitri\xe2\x80\x99s death, I will be faithful to his memory, to the work of his\r\nwhole life. I have learnt Bulgarian and Servian. Very likely, I shall\r\nnot have strength to live through it all for long--so much the better.\r\nI have been brought to the edge of the precipice and I must fall over.\r\nFate did not bring us together for nothing; who knows?--perhaps I killed\r\nhim; now it is his turn to draw me after him. I sought happiness, and I\r\nshall find--perhaps death. It seems it was to be thus: it seems it was a\r\nsin.... But death covers all and reconciles all; does it not? Forgive\r\nme all the suffering I have caused you; it was not under my control. But\r\nhow could I return to Russia; What have I to do in Russia?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Accept my last kisses and blessings, and do not condemn me.\r\n\r\nR.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nNearly five years have passed since then, and no further news of Elena\r\nhas come. All letters and inquiries were fruitless; in vain did Nikolai\r\nArtemyevitch himself make a journey to Venice and to Zara after peace\r\nwas concluded. In Venice he learnt what is already known to the reader,\r\nbut in Zara no one could give him any positive information about\r\nRenditch and the ship he had taken. There were dark rumours that some\r\nyears back, after a great storm, the sea had thrown up on shore a coffin\r\nin which had been found a man\xe2\x80\x99s body... But according to other more\r\ntrustworthy accounts this coffin had not been thrown up by the sea at\r\nall, but had been carried over and buried near the shore by a foreign\r\nlady, coming from Venice; some added that they had seen this lady\r\nafterwards in Herzegovina, with the forces which were there assembled;\r\nthey even described her dress, black from head to foot. However it was,\r\nall trace of Elena had disappeared beyond recovery for ever; and no one\r\nknows whether she is still living, whether she is hidden away somewhere,\r\nor whether the petty drama of life is over--the little ferment of her\r\nexistence is at an end; and she has found death in her turn. It happens\r\nat times that a man wakes up and asks himself with involuntary horror,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I be already thirty ... forty... fifty? How is it life has passed\r\nso soon? How is it death has moved up so close?\xe2\x80\x99 Death is like a fisher\r\nwho catches fish in his net and leaves them for a while in the water;\r\nthe fish is still swimming but the net is round him, and the fisher will\r\ndraw him up--when he thinks fit.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nWhat became of the other characters of our story?\r\n\r\nAnna Vassilyevna is still living; she has aged very much since the blow\r\nthat has fallen on her; is less complaining, but far more wretched.\r\nNikolai Artemyevitch, too, has grown older and greyer, and has parted\r\nfrom Augustina Christianovna.... He has taken now to abusing everything\r\nforeign. His housekeeper, a handsome woman of thirty, a Russian, wears\r\nsilk dresses and gold rings and bracelets. Kurnatovsky, like every man\r\nof ardent temperament and dark complexion, a devoted admirer of pretty\r\nblondes, married Zoya; she is in complete subjection to him and has even\r\ngiven up thinking in German. Bersenyev is in Heidelberg; he has been\r\nsent abroad at the expense of government; he has visited Berlin and\r\nParis and is not wasting his time; he has become a thoroughly efficient\r\nprofessor. The attention of the learned public has been caught by his\r\ntwo articles: \xe2\x80\x98On some peculiarities of ancient law as regards judicial\r\nsentences,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98On the significance of cities in civilisation.\xe2\x80\x99 It\r\nis only a pity that both articles are written in rather a heavy style,\r\ndisfigured by foreign words. Shubin is in Rome; he is completely given\r\nup to his art and is reckoned one of the most remarkable and\r\npromising of young sculptors. Severe tourists consider that he has not\r\nsufficiently studied the antique, that he has \xe2\x80\x98no style,\xe2\x80\x99 and reckon\r\nhim one of the French school; he has had a great many orders from\r\nthe English and Americans. Of late, there has been much talk about\r\na Bacchante of his; the Russian Count Boboshkin, the well-known\r\nmillionaire, thought of buying it for one thousand scudi, but decided\r\nin preference to give three thousand to another sculptor, French _pur\r\nsang_, for a group entitled, \xe2\x80\x98A youthful shepherdess dying for love in\r\nthe bosom of the Genius of Spring.\xe2\x80\x99 Shubin writes from time to time to\r\nUvar Ivanovitch, who alone has remained quite unaltered in all respects.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote to him lately, \xe2\x80\x98what you said to me that\r\nnight, when poor Elena\xe2\x80\x99s marriage was made known, when I was sitting on\r\nyour bed talking to you? Do you remember I asked you, \xe2\x80\x9cWill there ever\r\nbe men among us?\xe2\x80\x9d and you answered \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be.\xe2\x80\x9d O primeval force!\r\nAnd now from here in \xe2\x80\x9cmy poetic distance,\xe2\x80\x9d I will ask you again: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndo you say, Uvar Ivanovitch, will there be?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUvar Ivanovitch flourished his fingers and fixed his enigmatical stare\r\ninto the far distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of On the eve, by Ivan Turgenev\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ON THE EVE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 6902-0.txt or 6902-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/9/0/6902/\r\n\r\nProduced by Eric Eldred\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
