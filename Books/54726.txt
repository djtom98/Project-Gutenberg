Zola\'s best books so largely appeals,--it\r\nis indeed a book with a good sound moral, fit for every thoughtful\r\nwoman to peruse--but, in endeavouring to point out its scope and\r\npurport, I must, in the first instance, refer to some matters in\r\nwhich women, as nowadays educated, take as a rule but the scantiest\r\nof interest. Still many of them may have heard that in the opinion of\r\nvarious _fin-de-si\xc3\xa8cle_ seers and prophets the future of the human race\r\nlies in collectivism, a prediction which I do not intend to discuss,\r\nbut respecting which I may remark that during the last half century\r\nin this country there has certainly been a tendency in the direction\r\nindicated, even amongst classes which profess to hold every form of\r\nsocialism in horror.\r\n\r\nThis tendency towards collectivism has manifested itself notably in\r\ncertain trades and industries by the introduction of various forms of\r\nco-operation, by the amalgamation, too, of rival businesses, and even\r\nby the formation of quasi-monopolies which, evil and unjust as they\r\nmay appear to some, nevertheless rejoice the heart of many Socialists\r\nwho consider that the fewer the individual interests to be overthrown,\r\nthe easier will be their task of conquest when the time shall come for\r\nolden society to give up the ghost. And, further, a tendency towards\r\ncollectivism is also to be traced in the establishment of those great\r\n"universal providing" concerns which we know by the name of "stores",\r\nand which many a Socialist will tell you are but the forerunners of the\r\ncolossal "magazines of distribution" which will become necessary when\r\ncollectivism shall have attained its ends.\r\n\r\nOn all sides nowadays the small trader and the small manufacturer\r\nare assailed, and in many instances can barely hold their own; for\r\ncheapness is the god of the hour, and in cheapness they cannot hope\r\nto compete with those who operate upon a colossal scale. Whether they\r\nwill ultimately be obliged to give up the contest, whether the passion\r\nfor individuality is destined to depart from the human race, these and\r\nthe many other questions which the problem suggests, I will leave to\r\nthe Collectivist prophets and to those who oppose their doctrines in\r\nour reviews and newspapers. I have merely desired to call the reader\'s\r\nattention to this problem and to the tendencies previously referred to,\r\nbecause he--or she--will find that they constitute no small portion of\r\nthe subject of the present volume of M. Zola\'s works.\r\n\r\nIn "Au Bonheur des Dames" M. Zola has taken as his theme a particular\r\nphase of the amalgamation and "universal providing" tendencies, as\r\nthey have presented themselves in France; and the phase in question is\r\ncertainly one of the most interesting, if only for the fact that it is\r\nso closely connected with the desires and needs of women. In a word\r\nthe work deals with those huge drapery establishments, like the "Bon\r\nMarch\xc3\xa9" and the "Louvre", which are renowned throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWe have no doubt several very large draper\'s emporiums in London,\r\nbut I do not think that any one of them can claim to rival either in\r\ndimensions, extent of business, or completeness of organisation the\r\ngreat French establishments to which I have referred above. I can\r\nmyself well remember the growth of the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" and the "Louvre".\r\nTransferred, when my education was but half-completed, from the\r\nsolitude of the Sussex downs to the whirling vortex of Paris, I grew\r\nup amongst those Haussmannite transformations which virtually made the\r\nFrench capital a new city--a city which became my home for well nigh\r\ntwenty years. Even now I am but a stranger in my own land, among my own\r\nkith and kin; and my memory ever dwells on those years when I saw Paris\r\ndevelop, opening her streets to air and light and health, increasing\r\nher wealth and her activity, on the one hand multiplying her workshops,\r\never busy, thanks to the taste and dexterity of her craftsmen, and on\r\nthe other, by the attraction of a thousand pleasures, becoming the\r\ncaravanserai of Europe. And my fanatical admiration for M. Zola and for\r\nall his works, the passion which has induced me to translate so many\r\nof them, arises mainly from the fact that they deal so largely with\r\nParis and her life at a period which I so well remember, with scenes\r\nand incidents which I can so readily recall and which carry me back to\r\nthe days when the heart was light and buoyant, and sorrow was a thing\r\nunknown. And when, now and again sundry supercilious English critics,\r\nqualified by a smattering of French and a few months\' residence in\r\nFrance, presume to sneer at M. Zola\'s pictures of French manners and\r\ncustoms in the days of the Second Empire, I merely shrug my shoulders\r\nat their ignorance. For my own part I believe, for like St. Thomas I\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nAmong the subjects dealt with by M. Zola in the Rougon-Macquart series,\r\nthat of the present work,--the development of the great _magasins de\r\nnouveaut\xc3\xa9s_--is to me one of the most familiar, for the reason that\r\nI have always taken a keen interest in the attire and adornment of\r\nwomen, and in my salad days wrote some hundreds of columns of fashion\'s\r\narticles for English newspapers. And my duties in those days took me\r\nnot only to the _salons_ of M. Worth, M. Pingat and other _faiseurs \xc3\xa0\r\nla mode_, but also to the great drapers\', for if, on the one hand, I\r\nlearned in the former establishments what would be worn by royalty,\r\naristocracy and fashionable depravity, on the other, in the huge\r\nbazaars similar to "Au Bonheur des Dames", I ascertained what would\r\nbe the popular craze of the hour, the material which would be seen\r\non the back of every second woman one might meet, and the one or two\r\ncolours which for a few months would catch the eye at every street\r\ncorner. All this may seem to be frivolity, but it is on such frivolity\r\nthat a goodly portion of civilized humanity subsists. I find M.\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9 Cochut, a well informed writer, holding an official position,\r\nstating in 1866--a year which comes within the period I am referring\r\nto--that there were then 26,000 shops and work-shops in Paris which\r\nsold or made (almost exclusively) articles of female attire; and these\r\n26,000 establishments (many, of course, very small) gave employment\r\nto nearly 140,000 persons of both sexes, among whom there were 1500\r\ndesigners. Moreover, the trade of Paris in materials and made-up goods\r\nwas estimated at 570 millions of francs, or \xc2\xa322,800,000! Under these\r\ncircumstances that Paris should have claimed the sovereignty of fashion\r\nis, I think, not surprising.\r\n\r\nNowadays the number of establishments selling or making goods for\r\nfeminine attire has undoubtedly decreased, but the trade is greater\r\nthan ever. Well nigh the only alteration one can trace, is that many\r\nof the smaller houses have been swallowed up by their big rivals in\r\naccordance with the usual conditions of the struggle for life. The\r\nbig establishments did not, however, step into the arena, huge like\r\nGoliaths and armed _cap-\xc3\xa0-pi\xc3\xa9_. As M. Zola relates in the following\r\npages, they likewise had humble beginnings, and would never have\r\nexpanded as they did, but for the commercial genius of their founders.\r\nI remember the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" having but one entrance (in the Rue du\r\nBac, near the corner of the Rue de S\xc3\xa8vres) and ranking, in the opinion\r\nof the women of the neighbourhood, far below the "Petit St. Thomas"\r\nwhich it has since altogether outstripped. In the same way the huge\r\nblock of building now occupied by the "Magasins du Louvre" comprised\r\nsome forty different shops held by different tenants. Indeed the pile\r\nhad originally been erected for an hotel, the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel du Louvre,\r\nand the shops, even those bearing the name of the Louvre, were at the\r\noutset, only a secondary consideration. But gradually a transformation\r\nwas effected; the drapery emporium became larger and larger, secured\r\nthe adjoining shops, and ultimately invaded the hotel itself.\r\n\r\nCertainly all this was not easily brought about. Many neighbouring\r\ntenants refused to give way to the monster and clung stubbornly\r\nto their leases, fighting the unequal battle with the utmost\r\nobstinacy,--an obstinacy such as that which the Baudus, and old\r\nBourras, the umbrella maker, will be found displaying in M. Zola\'s\r\npages. In the case of the "Louvre", the last of these stubborn\r\nantagonists was, if I recollect rightly, a stationer whose shop fronted\r\non the Place du Palais Royal, and I believe that he held out until his\r\nlease fell in. At the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" too, the Boucicauts had to contend\r\nagainst similar obstacles; and, there, the enlargement of the premises\r\nwas attended by difficulties akin to those which M. Zola describes;\r\nfor many of the adjoining houses were decrepit, tumble-down vestiges\r\nof olden Paris; and each time the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" gained a few yards of\r\nfrontage expensive building operations had to be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn his present work M. Zola has, of course, not taken as his theme the\r\nactual history of either of the great establishments to which I have\r\nbeen referring. But from that history and from the history of other\r\nimportant _magasins de nouveaut\xc3\xa9s_ he has borrowed a multitude of\r\ncurious and interesting facts, which he has blended into a realistic\r\nwhole. Curiously enough the site which he has chosen for "Au Bonheur\r\ndes Dames" was really the site of a fairly large drapery emporium,\r\nwhich became the "Grands Magasins du 4 Septembre"; but perhaps that\r\ntitle, savouring as it did of revolution (the revolution of 1870),\r\nbrought the establishment bad luck with women caring little or nothing\r\nfor politics; for it failed to attain the success to which its central\r\nsituation seemed to entitle it. The "Place Clichy," to which M. Zola\r\nwill be found referring, still exists, and does a largely increasing\r\nbusiness with all the north of Paris; whilst as for the "Four Seasons",\r\nwhich one of his characters, Bouthemont the silk-salesman, establishes\r\nnear the grand opera-house, this is really the "Printemps," that white\r\nand blue and gilded palace which the Parisians owe to the commercial\r\nenterprise of M. Jules Jaluzot, by some people unkindly nicknamed "the\r\nman with the umbrella".\r\n\r\nI have often thought that, from the commercial point of view there is\r\nconsiderable resemblance between M. Jaluzot and M. Zola\'s hero, Octave\r\nMouret. The latter figures at an earlier stage of his life in another\r\nof M. Zola\'s novels--"Pot-Bouille"--but he there appears as a graceless\r\nDon Juan without a redeeming quality; whereas, in the present work, one\r\nobserves the development of his business capacities, and the gradual\r\nprogress of his reformation, till his career culminates in a marriage\r\nwhich ought to prove a very happy one, if there be any truth in the old\r\nsaw that a reformed rake makes the best of husbands. I have, however,\r\nno desire to institute the faintest comparison between the private life\r\nof Octave Mouret and that of M. Jaluzot; but in describing the former\'s\r\ncommercial genius and boldness M. Zola has, I think, more than once\r\nthought of the latter\'s hardihood and talent in carving for himself\r\na great industrial kingdom beside those of the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" and the\r\n"Louvre".\r\n\r\nM. Jaluzot is famous in Paris for the rare ability he displays in\r\nturning everything into advertisement, and this of course is an\r\nextremely valuable gift, as advertisement is the very life of the\r\nhuge _magasins de nouveaut\xc3\xa9s_. Some years ago the "Printemps" was\r\nburnt down; and when the necessary rebuilding operations began M.\r\nJaluzot prevailed upon the Cardinal Archbishop of Paris to come and\r\nbless the foundation stone of the new edifice. This inspiration--well\r\nworthy of M. Zola\'s hero--secured to M. Jaluzot extensive patronage\r\namong the devout; and it was important at the time that he should\r\nreconcile himself with society, for on the occasion of the burning of\r\nhis establishment the entire Parisian press had reproached him with\r\nshowing greater eagerness to rush off and purchase an umbrella, for\r\nprotection against a shower, than to minister to the needs of the\r\nnumerous employees who had been cast on the pavement of Paris by the\r\ncatastrophe. Hence the nickname to which I have previously referred.\r\n\r\nWith the every-day life of the Parisian drapery employee the present\r\nwork is very largely concerned. From the personal investigations I\r\nmade at former times, the many conversations I had with employees\r\nof this class, the numerous corroborative statements I have read in\r\nthe works of other French writers, I believe M. Zola\'s pictures of\r\nthe "counter jumper\'s" existence at the period dealt with, to be\r\nscrupulously accurate. It will be noticed that these pictures slowly\r\nchange in certain respects as the story proceeds. Mouret at last begins\r\nto take more interest in the material comforts of his staff, provides\r\nit with better food, and treats it generally in a more reasonable\r\nmanner; whilst among the employees themselves, their depravity and\r\nvulgarity, hidden beneath a surface elegance and politeness, is at\r\ntimes altogether stamped out, at others thrust back far more deeply. To\r\nthe Boucicauts of the "Bon March\xc3\xa9" largely belongs the honour of having\r\nimproved the material well-being, and raised the moral tone of shopmen\r\nof this class; and their example has been very generally followed.\r\nStill, as every Paris "calicot" well knows, there is one great emporium\r\nwhose internal organization is still open to serious criticism.\r\n\r\n"Calicot," I may mention, is the French equivalent of our term\r\n"counter-jumper"; and in this introduction to a work which deals so\r\nlargely with the "calicot\'s" life it may not be out of place to explain\r\nthe origin of the nickname. It dates from 1817, when a vaudeville\r\ncalled "_Le Combat des Montagnes, ou la Folie-Beaujon_" by Scribe\r\nand Dupin was performed at the Paris Th\xc3\xa9\xc3\xa2tre des Vari\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9s. At that\r\nperiod, with the wars of the Empire still fresh in their recollection,\r\nthe Parisians generally evinced a cordial respect for those who\r\nhad seen service; and the young men of the capital, promenading on\r\nthe boulevards, were fond of affecting a military appearance and\r\ndemeanour. Matters even came to such a pass that drapers\'-assistants,\r\n_commis-marchands_ as they were then called, cultivated huge moustaches\r\nand wore spurs on their boots even when behind their counters. To\r\nthis ridiculous craze Scribe and Dupin alluded in their vaudeville,\r\ninto which they introduced a certain "counter-jumper" called Monsieur\r\nCalicot, whom the other characters of the play at first mistook\r\nfor some survivor of the Old Guard. The result, as might have been\r\nexpected, was an explosion of rage among all the drapery employees of\r\nParis. They besieged the theatre, and desperate and sanguinary battles\r\nensued in the auditorium. The authorities, however, declined to place\r\nthe vaudeville under interdict; and after several interventions on the\r\npart of the police, the irate employees were cowed by the presence of\r\na detachment of grenadiers, who, with loaded muskets, stood on either\r\nside of the stage throughout each performance. And from that time to\r\nthe present day "calicot" has been French for "counter-jumper"[1] so\r\nfar as drapery is concerned.\r\n\r\nHowever, the vaudeville did not cure the "calicot" of his partiality\r\nfor moustaches. These he still cultivates, as all who have been in\r\nParis well know; indeed he frequently grows a beard as well; but as\r\nsuch hirsute appendages have long since ceased to be the exclusive\r\nproperty of the military, nobody taunts him with affectation concerning\r\nthem. On the other hand he has wisely renounced the practice of wearing\r\nspurs behind his counter, and if he sometimes evinces a little military\r\nprecision or even swagger it would be unwise to deem this assumed;\r\nfor in these days of the universal conscription it may well have been\r\nacquired by real service in the ranks. Indeed, we must not sneer at the\r\n"calicot"; he answers his country\'s call as readily as any other of her\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nIt remains for me to say a few words concerning the moral of this book.\r\nThe story of Denise\'s struggles, hardships and temptations, her quiet\r\ncourage and gentle steadfastness is invested by M. Zola with that\r\nsimple pathos which adorns so many of his works. The young girl passes\r\nthrough the fire and emerges from it unscathed, protected by her own\r\nsense of rectitude and the purity of her love, whilst others, alas,\r\nare devoured. No more beautiful example of feminine resistance to evil\r\ncould be imagined. We follow the heroine\'s fortunes with emotional\r\ninterest and take a kindly satisfaction in her reward. Possibly, we\r\nmight wish that she had loved a somewhat worthier man than Mouret, in\r\nwhom there are many moral blemishes; but the reflection imposes itself,\r\nthat under her caressing influence these blemishes will disappear, that\r\nMouret will throw off all that remains in him of the old Adam and prove\r\nworthy of the love that he himself feels and has inspired. And surely\r\nwoman\'s love can have no holier mission than that of the reformation of\r\nman. What, moreover, would become of humanity if a woman\'s heart were\r\nto be given only to the immaculate, in accordance with the paradoxical\r\ndictum of some latter day lady-novelists? Does not the woman who brings\r\nan erring man back into the straight path that he may contribute to the\r\ncommon weal, achieve more good than she who simply plights her troth\r\nto one as blameless as herself? And thus a halo encircles M. Zola\'s\r\nheroine, Denise, the personification of all that is best and truest in\r\nthe female heart.\r\n\r\nOne word more. The compass of the present introduction does not permit\r\nme to establish a comparison between the relative positions of French\r\nand English salesmen and women in the great drapery establishments.\r\nI fear, however, from all I have heard, that several of M. Zola\'s\r\nstrictures on the treatment meted out to the employees of Octave\r\nMouret\'s bazaar, might be applied to English houses. And thus whilst I\r\nrecommend this book to women, whom its subject cannot fail to interest\r\nand who will take a warning from the extravagance of Madame Marty and\r\nfind a bright example in the unswerving rectitude of Denise, I also\r\nsubmit it to the attention of those who are seeking in this country to\r\nimprove the position of shop employees, for I feel certain that they\r\nwill find many a useful hint in its searching and accurate pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nERNEST A. VIZETELLY.\r\n\r\n_Merton_, May 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I find that Brunet who played the part of M. Calicot wore the\r\nfollowing typical costume: high boots with spurs, white trousers,\r\na buff waistcoat and a frock coat made of a green and white\r\n"mixture"--_chicor\xc3\xa9e \xc3\xa0 la cr\xc3\xaame_, as the tailors of those days termed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADIES PARADISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenise had come on foot from the Saint-Lazare railway station, where\r\na Cherbourg train had landed her and her two brothers, after a night\r\nspent on the hard seat of a third-class carriage. She was leading P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\r\nby the hand, while Jean followed her; all three of them exhausted by\r\ntheir journey, frightened and lost in that vast city of Paris, their\r\neyes raised to the house fronts and their tongues for ever inquiring\r\nthe way to the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, where their uncle Baudu lived.\r\nHowever, as she at last emerged into the Place Gaillon, the girl\r\nstopped short in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Oh! just look there, Jean," said she; and they remained stock still,\r\nnestling close to one another, dressed from head to foot in black, the\r\nold mourning bought at their father\'s death. Denise, rather puny for\r\nher twenty years, was carrying a small parcel in one hand, while on the\r\nother side, her little brother, five years old, clung to her arm, and\r\nin the rear her big brother in the flower of his sixteen summers stood\r\nerect with dangling arms.\r\n\r\n"Well I never," said she, after a pause, "that _is_ a shop!"\r\n\r\nThey were at the corner of the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re and the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin, in front of a draper\'s shop, whose windows\r\ndisplayed a wealth of bright colour in the soft, pale October light.\r\nEight o\'clock was striking at the church of Saint-Roch; and only\r\nthe early birds of Paris were abroad, a few clerks on their way to\r\nbusiness, and housewives flitting about on their morning shopping.\r\nBefore the door of the drapery establishment, two shopmen, mounted on\r\na step-ladder, were hanging up some woollen goods, whilst in a window\r\nfacing the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin another young man, kneeling with\r\nhis back to the pavement, was delicately plaiting a piece of blue silk.\r\nIn the shop, which was as yet void of customers, and whose employees\r\nwere only just beginning to arrive, there was a low buzz as in a bee\r\nhive just awakening.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said Jean, "this beats Valognes. Yours wasn\'t such a fine\r\nshop."\r\n\r\nDenise shook her head. She had spent two years at Valognes, with\r\nCornaille, the principal draper in the town; and this Parisian shop\r\nso suddenly encountered and to her so vast made her heart swell and\r\ndetained her there, interested, impressed, forgetful of everything\r\nelse. The lofty plate-glass door in a corner facing the Place Gaillon\r\nreached the first storey amidst a medley of ornaments covered with\r\ngilding. Two allegorical female figures, with laughing faces and\r\nbare bosoms unrolled a scroll bearing the inscription "The Ladies\'\r\nParadise"; then, on either side, along the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re and the\r\nRue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, stretched the windows of the establishment,\r\nnot limited merely to the corner house but comprising four others--two\r\non the right and two on the left which had been recently purchased and\r\nfitted up. It all appeared endless to Denise, thus seen in perspective,\r\nwith the display down below and the plate glass windows above, through\r\nwhich a long line of counters was to be perceived. Upstairs a young\r\nlady, dressed in silk, could be espied sharpening a pencil, while two\r\nothers, beside her, were unfolding some velvet mantles.\r\n\r\n"The Ladies\' Paradise," read Jean, with a soft laugh, like a handsome\r\nyouth who already has thoughts of women. "That\'s a pretty name--that\r\nmust draw customers--eh?"\r\n\r\nBut Denise was absorbed by the display at the principal entrance.\r\nThere, in the open street, on the very pavement, she beheld a mass of\r\ncheap goods--doorway temptations, bargains to attract the passer-by.\r\nPieces of woollen and cloth goods, merinoes, cheviots, and tweeds,\r\nhung from above like bunting, with their neutral, slate, navy-blue,\r\nand olive-green tints relieved by large white price-tickets. Close by,\r\non either side of the doorway, dangled strips of fur, narrow bands\r\nfor dress trimmings, ashen-hued Siberian squirrel-skin, swansdown of\r\nspotless snowiness, and rabbit-skin transformed into imitation ermine\r\nand imitation sable. Below, in boxes and on tables, amidst piles of\r\nremnants, appeared a quantity of hosiery which was virtually given\r\naway; knitted woollen gloves, neckerchiefs, women\'s hoods, cardigan\r\nwaistcoats, a complete winter show with colours in mixtures, patterns\r\nand stripes and here and there a flaming patch of red. Denise saw some\r\ntartan at nine sous, some strips of American bison at a franc the\r\nm\xc3\xa8tre, and some mittens at five sous a pair. An immense clearance sale\r\nwas apparently going on; the establishment seemed to be bursting with\r\ngoods, blocking up the pavement with the surplus of its contents. Uncle\r\nBaudu was forgotten. Even P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, clinging tightly to his sister\'s hand,\r\nopened his big eyes in wonder. However a vehicle in coming up forced\r\nthem to quit the roadway, and they mechanically turned into the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin, following the windows and stopping at each fresh\r\ndisplay. At first they were captivated by an intricate arrangement:\r\nup above a number of umbrellas, placed obliquely, seemed to form a\r\nrustic roof; upon rods beneath them hung a quantity of silk stockings\r\ndisplaying neat ankles and well rounded calves, some of them dotted\r\nwith rosebuds, others of divers hues, the black ones open-worked and\r\nthe red ones elegantly clocked; whilst those which were of a flesh\r\ntint, looked, with their satiny texture, as soft as skin itself. Then,\r\non the baize covering of the show-stage, came a symmetrical array of\r\ngloves with extended fingers and narrow palms recalling the hands of\r\nByzantine Virgins, all the rigid and, as it were, adolescent grace\r\nwhich characterises feminine frippery before it is worn. However, it\r\nwas especially the last window which detained their eyes. An exhibition\r\nof silks, satins and velvets, in a supple, vibrating scale of colour,\r\nhere set, as in full bloom, the most delicate hues of the floral\r\nworld. At the top were the velvets, deeply black, or white as curds;\r\nlower down came the satins, pinks and blues, bright at their folds,\r\nthen fading into paler and paler tints of infinite delicacy; and lower\r\nstill were silks, the rainbow\'s variegated scarf, the several pieces\r\ncocked shell-wise, plaited as though round some female waist, endowed,\r\nas it were, with life by the skilful manipulation of the employees;\r\nand between each _motif_, each glowing phrase of the display ran a\r\ndiscreet accompaniment, a light, puffy roll of creamy _foulard_. Here\r\ntoo at either end of the window, were huge piles of the two silks which\r\nwere the exclusive property of the establishment, the "Paris Delight"\r\nand the "Golden Grain"--articles of exceptional quality destined to\r\nrevolutionize the silk trade.\r\n\r\n"Oh! look at that _faille_ at five francs sixty!" murmured Denise,\r\ntransported with astonishment at sight of the "Paris Delight".\r\n\r\nJean, however, was getting bored and stopped a passer-by. "Which is the\r\nRue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, please, sir?"\r\n\r\nOn hearing that it was the first on the right they all turned back,\r\nmaking the tour of the establishment. But just as she was entering the\r\nstreet, Denise was again attracted by a window in which ladies\' mantles\r\nwere displayed. At Cornaille\'s the mantles had been her department,\r\nbut she had never seen anything like this, and remained rooted to the\r\nspot with admiration. At the rear a large scarf of Bruges lace, of\r\nconsiderable value, was spread out like an altar-veil, with its two\r\ncreamy wings extended; then there were flounces of Alen\xc3\xa7on, grouped in\r\ngarlands; and from the top to the bottom, like falling snow, fluttered\r\nlace of every description--Malines, Valenciennes, Brussels, and\r\nVenetian-point. On each side pieces of cloth rose up in dark columns\r\nimparting distance to the background. And the mantles were here, in\r\nthis sort of chapel raised to the worship of woman\'s beauty and grace.\r\nIn the centre was a magnificent article, a velvet mantle trimmed\r\nwith silver fox; on one side of it appeared a silk cloak lined with\r\nminiver, on the other a cloth cloak edged with cocks\' plumes; and, last\r\nof all, some opera cloaks in white cashmere and quilted silk trimmed\r\nwith swansdown or chenille. There was something for every taste, from\r\nthe opera cloaks at twenty-nine francs to the velvet mantle which was\r\nmarked eighteen hundred. The round busts of the dummies filled out\r\nthe stuff, the prominent hips exaggerating the slimness of the waists\r\nand the absent heads being replaced by large price-tickets pinned on\r\nthe necks, whilst the mirrors, on each side of the window, reflected\r\nand multiplied all these forms, peopling the street, as it were, with\r\nbeautiful women for sale, each bearing a price in big figures in lieu\r\nof a head.\r\n\r\n"How stunning they are!" murmured Jean, finding no other words to\r\nexpress his emotion.\r\n\r\nThis time he himself had become motionless, and stood there gaping.\r\nAll this female luxury turned him rosy with pleasure. He had a girl\'s\r\nbeauty--a beauty which he seemed to have stolen from his sister--a\r\nfair white skin, ruddy curly hair, lips and eyes overflowing with\r\ntenderness. By his side Denise, with her rather long face, large mouth,\r\nfading complexion and light hair, appeared thinner still. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, who\r\nwas also fair, with the fairness of infancy, now clung closer to her,\r\nas if anxious to be caressed, perturbed and delighted as he was by the\r\nsight of the beautiful ladies in the window. And those three fair ones,\r\npoorly clad in black, that sad-looking girl between the pretty child\r\nand the handsome youth, looked so strange yet so charming standing\r\nthere on the pavement, that the passers-by glanced back smilingly.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes a stout man with grey hair and a large yellow face\r\nhad been looking at them from a shop-door on the other side of the\r\nstreet. He had been standing there with bloodshot eyes and contracted\r\nmouth, beside himself with rage at the display made by The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, when the sight of the girl and her brothers had completed his\r\nexasperation. What were those three simpletons doing there, gaping in\r\nfront of the cheap-jack\'s show booth?\r\n\r\n"What about uncle?" asked Denise, suddenly, as if just waking up.\r\n\r\n"We are in the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re," replied Jean. "He must live\r\nsomewhere about here."\r\n\r\nThey raised their heads and looked round; and just in front of them,\r\nabove the stout man, they perceived a green sign-board on which in\r\nyellow letters, discoloured by the rain was the following inscription:\r\n"THE OLD ELBEUF. Cloths and Flannels. BAUDU, late HAUCHECORNE." The\r\nhouse, coated with ancient rusty paint, and quite flat and unadorned\r\namidst the surrounding mansions of the Louis XIV. period, had only\r\nthree front windows up above, square and shutterless windows simply\r\nprovided with handrails supported by two iron bars placed crosswise.\r\nBut what most struck Denise, whose eyes were full of the bright display\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise, was the low ground-floor shop, surmounted\r\nby an equally low storey with half-moon windows, of prison-like\r\nappearance. Right and left, framed round by wood work of a bottle-green\r\nhue, which time had tinted with ochre and bitumen, were two deep\r\nwindows, black and dusty, in which pieces of cloth heaped one on\r\nanother could vaguely be seen. The open doorway seemed to conduct into\r\nthe darkness and dampness of a cellar.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the house," said Jean.\r\n\r\n"Well, we must go in," declared Denise. "Come on, P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9."\r\n\r\nAll three, however, grew somewhat troubled, as if seized with fear.\r\nWhen their father had died, carried off by the same fever which a month\r\npreviously had killed their mother, their uncle Baudu, in the emotion\r\nborn of this double bereavement, had certainly written to Denise,\r\nassuring her that there would always be a place for her in his house\r\nwhenever she might like to try fortune in Paris. But this had taken\r\nplace nearly a year ago, and the young girl was now sorry that she\r\nshould have so impulsively left Valognes without informing her uncle.\r\nThe latter did not know them, never having set foot in the little town\r\nsince the day when he had left it as a boy, to enter the service of the\r\ndraper Hauchecorne, whose daughter he had subsequently married.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Baudu?" asked Denise, at last making up her mind to speak to\r\nthe stout man who was still eyeing them, surprised by their appearance\r\nand manners.\r\n\r\n"That\'s me," he replied.\r\n\r\nThen Denise blushed deeply and stammered: "Oh, I\'m so pleased! I am\r\nDenise. This is Jean, and this is P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9. You see, we have come, uncle."\r\n\r\nBaudu seemed lost in amazement. His big eyes rolled in his yellow face;\r\nhe spoke slowly and with difficulty. He had evidently been far from\r\nthinking of this family which now suddenly dropped down upon him.\r\n\r\n"What--what, you here?" he several times repeated. "But you were at\r\nValognes. Why aren\'t you at Valognes?"\r\n\r\nIn her sweet but rather faltering voice she then explained that since\r\nthe death of her father, who had spent every penny he possessed in\r\nhis dye-works, she had acted as a mother to the two children; but the\r\nlittle she had earned at Cornaille\'s did not suffice to keep the three\r\nof them. Jean certainly worked at a cabinet-maker\'s, a repairer of\r\nold furniture, but didn\'t earn a sou. Still, he had got to like the\r\nbusiness, and had even learned to carve. One day, having found a piece\r\nof ivory, he had amused himself by carving it into a head, which a\r\ngentleman staying in the town had seen and praised; and this gentleman\r\nit was who had been the cause of their leaving Valognes, as he had\r\nfound Jean a place with an ivory-carver in Paris.\r\n\r\n"So you see, uncle," continued Denise, "Jean will commence his\r\napprenticeship at his new master\'s to-morrow. They ask no premium, and\r\nwill board and lodge him. And so I felt sure that P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 and I would be\r\nable to jog along. At all events we can\'t be worse off than we were at\r\nValognes."\r\n\r\nShe said nothing about a certain love affair of Jean\'s, of certain\r\nletters which he had written to the daughter of a nobleman of the town,\r\nof the kisses which the pair had exchanged over a wall--in fact, quite\r\na scandal which had strengthened her in her determination to leave. And\r\nif she was so anxious to be in Paris herself it was that she might be\r\nable to look after her brother, feeling, as she did, quite a mother\'s\r\ntender anxiety for this gay and handsome youth, whom all the women\r\nadored. Uncle Baudu, however, couldn\'t get over it, but continued his\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n"So your father left you nothing," said he. "I certainly thought there\r\nwas still something left. Ah! how many times did I write advising him\r\nnot to take those dye-works! He was a good-hearted fellow certainly,\r\nbut he had no head for business And you were left with those two\r\nyoungsters to look after--you\'ve had to keep them, eh?"\r\n\r\nHis bilious face had now become clearer, his eyes were not so bloodshot\r\nas when he had stood glaring at The Ladies\' Paradise. All at once he\r\nnoticed that he was blocking up the doorway. "Well," said he, "come in,\r\nnow you\'re here. Come in, that\'ll be better than gaping at a parcel of\r\nrubbish."\r\n\r\nAnd after addressing a last pout of anger to The Ladies\' Paradise, he\r\nmade way for the children by entering the shop and calling his wife and\r\ndaughter: "Elizabeth, Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, come down; here\'s company for you!"\r\n\r\nDenise and the two boys, however, hesitated at sight of the darkness\r\nof the shop. Blinded by the clear outdoor light, they blinked as on\r\nthe threshold of some unknown pit, and felt their way with their feet\r\nwith an instinctive fear of encountering some treacherous step. And\r\ndrawn yet closer together by this vague fear, the child still holding\r\nthe girl\'s skirts, and the big boy behind, they made their entry with\r\na smiling, anxious grace. The clear morning light outlined the dark\r\nsilhouettes of their mourning clothes; and an oblique ray of sunshine\r\ngilded their fair hair.\r\n\r\n"Come in, come in," repeated Baudu.\r\n\r\nThen, in a few sentences he explained matters to his wife and\r\ndaughter. The former was a little woman, consumed by an\xc3\xa6mia and quite\r\nwhite--white hair, white eyes and white lips. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, the daughter,\r\nin whom the maternal degeneracy appeared yet more marked, had the\r\nsickly, colourless appearance of a plant reared in the shade. However,\r\na thick, heavy crop of magnificent black hair, marvellously vigorous\r\nfor such poor soil, gave her, as it were, a mournful charm.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said both the women in their turn; "you are welcome." And\r\nthey at once made Denise sit down behind a counter.\r\n\r\nP\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 then jumped upon his sister\'s lap, whilst Jean leant against the\r\npanelling beside her. They were regaining their assurance and looking\r\nround the shop where their eyes had grown used to the obscurity. They\r\ncould now distinctly see it all, with its low and smoky ceiling, its\r\noaken counters polished by use, and its old-fashioned nests of drawers\r\nwith strong iron fittings. Bales of dark goods reached to the beams\r\nabove; a smell of wool and dye--a sharp chemical smell--prevailed,\r\nintensified it seemed by the humidity of the floor. At the further end\r\ntwo young men and a young woman were putting away some pieces of white\r\nflannel.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps this young gentleman would like to take something?" said\r\nMadame Baudu, smiling at P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," replied Denise, "we each had a cup of milk at a caf\xc3\xa9\r\nopposite the station." And as Genevi\xc3\xa8ve looked at the small parcel she\r\nhad laid on the floor near her, she added: "I left our box there too."\r\n\r\nShe blushed as she spoke feeling that she ought not to have dropped\r\ndown on her friends in this way. Even in the train, just as she was\r\nleaving Valognes, she had been assailed by regrets and fears; and this\r\nwas why she had left the box at the station and given the children\r\ntheir breakfast immediately on arriving in Paris.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," suddenly said Baudu, "let\'s come to an understanding.\r\n\'Tis true that I wrote to you, but that was a year ago, and since then\r\nbusiness hasn\'t been flourishing, I can assure you, my girl."\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, choked by an emotion he did not wish to show.\r\nMadame Baudu and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, had cast down their eyes with an air of\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n"Oh," continued he, "it\'s a crisis which will pass, no doubt, I\'m not\r\nuneasy; but I have reduced my staff; there are only three here now, and\r\nthis is not the moment to engage a fourth. In short, my poor girl, I\r\ncannot take you as I promised."\r\n\r\nDenise listened, aghast and very pale. He repeated his words, adding:\r\n"It would do no good to either of us."\r\n\r\n"All right, uncle," at last she replied, with a painful effort, "I\'ll\r\ntry to manage all the same."\r\n\r\nThe Baudus were not bad sort of people. But they complained of never\r\nhaving had any luck. In the flourishing days of their business, they\r\nhad had to bring up five sons, of whom three had died before attaining\r\nthe age of twenty; the fourth had gone wrong, and the fifth had just\r\nstarted for Mexico, as a captain. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve was the only one now left\r\nat home. From first to last, however, this large family had cost a deal\r\nof money, and Baudu had made things worse by buying a great lumbering\r\ncountry house, at Rambouillet, near his wife\'s father\'s place. Thus,\r\na sharp, sour feeling was springing up in the honest old tradesman\'s\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"You might have warned us," he resumed, gradually getting angry at\r\nhis own harshness. "You might have written and I should have told you\r\nto stay at Valognes. When I heard of your father\'s death I said what\r\nis right on such occasions, but you drop down on us without a word of\r\nwarning. It\'s very awkward."\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice, as he thus relieved himself. His wife and\r\ndaughter still kept their eyes on the floor, like submissive persons\r\nwho would never think of interfering. Jean, however, had turned pale,\r\nwhilst Denise hugged the terrified P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 to her bosom. Hot tears of\r\ndisappointment fell from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"All right, uncle," she said, "we\'ll go away."\r\n\r\nAt that he ceased speaking, and an awkward silence ensued. Then he\r\nresumed in a surly tone: "I don\'t mean to turn you out. As you are here\r\nyou can sleep upstairs to-night; after that, we\'ll see."\r\n\r\nThen, as he glanced at them, Madame Baudu and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve understood that\r\nthey were free to arrange matters. And all was soon settled. There was\r\nno need to trouble about Jean, as he was to enter on his apprenticeship\r\nthe next day. As for P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, he would be well looked after by Madame\r\nGras, an old lady who rented a large ground floor in the Rue des\r\nOrties, where she boarded and lodged young children for forty francs a\r\nmonth. Denise said that she had sufficient to pay for the first month,\r\nand, so the only remaining question was to find a place for herself.\r\nSurely they would be able to discover some situation for her in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t Vin\xc3\xa7ard in want of a saleswoman?" asked Genevi\xc3\xa8ve.\r\n\r\n"Of course, so he was!" cried Baudu; "we\'ll go and see him after lunch.\r\nThere\'s nothing like striking the iron while it\'s hot."\r\n\r\nNot a customer had come in to interrupt this family discussion; the\r\nshop remained dark and empty as before. At the far end, the two young\r\nmen and the young woman were still working, talking in low sibilant\r\nwhispers amongst themselves. At last, however, three ladies arrived,\r\nand Denise was then left alone for a moment. She kissed P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 with a\r\nswelling heart, at the thought of their approaching separation. The\r\nchild, affectionate as a kitten, hid his little head without saying a\r\nword. When Madame Baudu and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve returned, they remarked how quiet\r\nhe was, and Denise assured them that he never made any more noise than\r\nthat, but remained for days together without speaking, living solely\r\non kisses and caresses. Then until lunch-time the three women sat and\r\ntalked together about children, housekeeping, life in Paris and life in\r\nthe country, in curt, cautious sentences, like relations whom ignorance\r\nof one another renders somewhat awkward. Jean meantime had gone to the\r\nshop-door, and stood there watching all the outdoor life and smiling\r\nat the pretty girls. At ten o\'clock a servant appeared. As a rule the\r\ncloth was then laid for Baudu, Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, and the first-hand; a second\r\nlunch being served at eleven o\'clock for Madame Baudu, the other young\r\nman, and the young woman.\r\n\r\n"Come to lunch!" exclaimed the draper, turning towards his niece; and\r\nwhen they sat ready in the narrow dining-room behind the shop, he\r\ncalled the first-hand who had lingered behind: "Colomban lunch!"\r\n\r\nThe young man entered apologising; he had wished to finish arranging\r\nthe flannels, he said. He was a big fellow of twenty-five, heavy but\r\ncrafty, for although his face, with its large weak mouth, seemed at\r\nfirst sight typical of honesty there was a veiled cunning in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a time for everything," rejoined Baudu, who sat before a\r\npiece of cold veal, carving it with a master\'s skill and prudence,\r\ncalculating the weight of each thin slice to within a quarter of an\r\nounce.\r\n\r\nHe served everybody, and even cut up the bread. Denise had placed P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\r\nnear her to see that he ate properly; but the dark close room made\r\nher feel uncomfortable. She thought it so small, after the large,\r\nwell-lighted rooms to which she had been accustomed in the country. A\r\nsingle window overlooked a small back-yard, which communicated with the\r\nstreet by a dark passage running along the side of the house. And this\r\nyard, dripping wet and evil-smelling, was like the bottom of some well\r\ninto which fell a circular glimmer of light. In the winter they were\r\nobliged to keep the gas burning all day, and when the weather enabled\r\nthem to do without it the room seemed more melancholy still. Several\r\nseconds elapsed before Denise\'s eyes got sufficiently used to the light\r\nto distinguish the food on her plate.\r\n\r\n"That young chap has a good appetite," remarked Baudu, observing that\r\nJean had finished his veal. "If he works as well as he eats, he\'ll make\r\na fine fellow. But you, my girl, you are not eating. And, I say, now\r\nthat we can talk a bit, tell us why you didn\'t get married at Valognes?"\r\n\r\nAt this Denise almost dropped the glass she held in her hand. "Oh!\r\nuncle--get married! How can you think of it? And the little ones!"\r\n\r\nShe ended by laughing, it seemed to her such a strange idea. Besides,\r\nwhat man would have cared to take her--a girl without a sou, no fatter\r\nthan a lath, and not at all pretty? No, no, she would never marry, she\r\nhad quite enough children with her two brothers.\r\n\r\n"You are wrong," said her uncle; "a woman always needs a man. If you\r\nhad found an honest young fellow over there you wouldn\'t have dropped\r\non to the Paris pavement, you and your brothers, like a party of\r\ngipsies."\r\n\r\nHe paused in order to apportion with a parsimony full of justice, a\r\ndish of bacon and potatoes which the servant had just brought in. Then,\r\npointing to Genevi\xc3\xa8ve and Colomban with his spoon, he added: "Those two\r\nwill get married next spring, if we have a good winter season."\r\n\r\nSuch was the patriarchal custom of the house. The founder, Aristide\r\nFinet, had given his daughter, D\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9e, to his first-hand, Hauchecorne;\r\nhe, Baudu, who had arrived in the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re with seven\r\nfrancs in his pocket, had married old Hauchecorne\'s daughter,\r\nElizabeth; and in his turn he intended to hand over Genevi\xc3\xa8ve and the\r\nbusiness to Colomban as soon as trade should improve. If he still\r\ndelayed the marriage which had been decided on three years previously,\r\nit was because a scruple had come to him, a fixed resolve to act in all\r\nhonesty. He himself had received the business in a prosperous state,\r\nand did not wish to pass it on to his son-in-law with fewer customers\r\nor doubtful sales. And, continuing his talk, he formally introduced\r\nColomban, who came from Rambouillet, like Madame Baudu\'s father; in\r\nfact they were distant cousins. A hard-working fellow was Colomban,\r\nsaid he; for ten years he had slaved in the shop, fairly earning all\r\nhis promotions! Besides, he was far from being a nobody; his father was\r\nthat noted toper, Colomban, the veterinary surgeon so well known all\r\nover the department of Seine-et-Oise, an artist in his line, but so\r\naddicted to the flowing bowl that his money fast slipped through his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n"Thank heaven!" said the draper in conclusion, "if the father drinks\r\nand runs after women, the son at all events has learnt the value of\r\nmoney here."\r\n\r\nWhilst he was thus speaking Denise began to examine Genevi\xc3\xa8ve and\r\nColomban. Though they sat close together at table, they remained\r\nvery quiet, without a blush or a smile. From the day of entering the\r\nestablishment the young man had counted on this marriage. He had passed\r\nthrough the various stages of junior hand, salesman, etc., at last\r\ngaining admittance into the confidence and pleasures of the family\r\ncircle, and all this patiently, whilst leading a clock-work style of\r\nlife and looking upon his marriage with Genevi\xc3\xa8ve as a legitimate\r\nstroke of business. The certainty of having her as his wife prevented\r\nhim from feeling any desire for her. On her side the girl had got to\r\nlove him with the gravity of her reserved nature, full of a real deep\r\npassion of which she was not aware, in the regulated monotony of her\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s quite right, when folks like each other, and can do it," at\r\nlast said Denise, smiling, with a view to making herself agreeable.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it always finishes like that," declared Colomban, who, slowly\r\nmasticating, had not yet spoken a word.\r\n\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve gave him a long look, and then in her turn remarked: "When\r\npeople understand each other, the rest comes naturally."\r\n\r\nTheir affection had sprung up in this gloomy nook of old Paris like a\r\nflower in a cellar. For ten years past she had known no one but him,\r\nliving by his side, behind the same bales of cloth, amidst the darkness\r\nof the shop; and morning and evening they had found themselves elbow to\r\nelbow in the tiny dining-room, so damp and vault-like. They could not\r\nhave been more concealed, more utterly lost had they been far away in\r\nthe country, under the screening foliage of the trees. Only the advent\r\nof doubt, of jealous fear, could make it plain to the girl, that she\r\nhad given herself, for ever, amidst this abetting solitude, through\r\nsheer emptiness of heart and mental weariness.\r\n\r\nAs it was, Denise, fancied she could detect a growing anxiety in the\r\nlook Genevi\xc3\xa8ve had cast at Colomban, so she good-naturedly replied:\r\n"Oh! when people are in love they always understand each other."\r\n\r\nMeantime Baudu kept a sharp eye on the table. He had distributed some\r\n"fingers" of Brie cheese, and, as a treat for the visitors, called for\r\na second dessert, a pot of red-currant jam, a liberality which seemed\r\nto surprise Colomban. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, who so far had been very good, behaved\r\nrather badly at the sight of the jam; whilst Jean, his attention\r\nattracted by the conversation about his cousin Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s marriage,\r\nbegan to take stock of the girl, whom he thought too puny and too pale,\r\ncomparing her in his own mind to a little white rabbit with black ears\r\nand pink eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve chatted enough, and must make room for the others," said\r\nthe draper, giving the signal to rise from table. "Just because we\'ve\r\nhad a treat there is no reason why we should want too much of it."\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu, the other shopman, and the young lady then came and\r\ntook their places at table. Denise, again left to herself, sat down\r\nnear the door waiting until her uncle should be able to take her to\r\nVin\xc3\xa7ard\'s. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 was playing at her feet, whilst Jean had resumed his\r\npost of observation on the threshold. And Denise sat there for nearly\r\nan hour, taking interest in what went on around her. Now and again\r\na few customers came in; a lady, then two others appeared, the shop\r\nmeanwhile retaining its musty odour and its half light, in which\r\nold-fashioned commerce, simple and good natured, seemed to weep at\r\nfinding itself so deserted. What most interested Denise, however, was\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise opposite, whose windows she could see through the\r\nopen doorway. The sky remained cloudy, a sort of humid mildness warmed\r\nthe air, notwithstanding the season; and in the clear light, permeated,\r\nas it were, by a hazy diffusion of sunshine, the great shop acquired\r\nabundant life and activity.\r\n\r\nTo Denise it seemed as if she were watching a machine working at full\r\npressure, setting even the window-shows in motion. They were no longer\r\nthe cold windows she had seen in the early morning; they seemed to\r\nhave been warmed and to vibrate with all the activity within. There\r\nwere folks before them, groups of women pushing and squeezing against\r\nthe sheets of glass, a perfect crowd excited with covetousness. And in\r\nthis passionate atmosphere the stuffs themselves seemed endowed with\r\nlife; the laces quivered, drooped, and concealed the depths of the shop\r\nwith a disturbing air of mystery; even the thick square-cut lengths\r\nof cloth breathed, exhaling a tempting odour, while the tailor-made\r\ncoats seemed to draw themselves up more erectly on the dummies, which\r\nacquired souls, and the velvet mantle expanded, supple and warm, as if\r\nfalling from real shoulders, over a heaving bosom and quivering hips.\r\nBut the factory-like glow which pervaded the house came above all from\r\nthe sales, the crush at the counters, which could be divined behind\r\nthe walls. There was the continual roaring of a machine at work, an\r\nengulfing of customers close-pressed against the counters, bewildered\r\namidst the piles of goods, and finally hurled towards the pay-desks.\r\nAnd all went on in an orderly manner, with mechanical regularity, force\r\nand logic carrying quite a nation of women through the gearing of this\r\ncommercial machine.\r\n\r\nDenise had felt tempted ever since early morning. She was bewildered\r\nand attracted by this shop, to her so vast, which she saw more people\r\nenter in an hour than she had seen enter Cornaille\'s in six months; and\r\nwith her desire to enter it was mingled a vague sense of danger which\r\nrendered her seduction complete. At the same time her uncle\'s shop\r\nmade her feel ill at ease; she felt unreasonable disdain, instinctive\r\nrepugnance for this cold, icy place, the home of old-fashioned trading.\r\nAll her sensations--her anxious entry, her relatives\' cold reception,\r\nthe dull lunch partaken of in a prison-like atmosphere, her spell of\r\nwaiting amidst the sleepy solitude of this old establishment doomed\r\nto speedy decay--all these became concentrated in mute protest, in a\r\npassionate longing for life and light. And despite her good heart, her\r\neyes ceaselessly turned to The Ladies\' Paradise, as if, saleswoman\r\nas she was, she felt the need of warming herself in the glow of that\r\nimmense business.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of customers over there at all events!" was the remark which at\r\nlast escaped her.\r\n\r\nBut she promptly regretted these words on seeing the Baudus near her.\r\nMadame Baudu, who had finished her lunch, was standing there, quite\r\nwhite, with her pale eyes fixed on the monster; and resigned though she\r\ntried to be, she could never catch sight of that place across the road,\r\nwithout mute despair filling her eyes with tears. As for Genevi\xc3\xa8ve,\r\nshe was anxiously watching Colomban, who, unaware that he was being\r\nobserved, remained in ecstasy, looking at the young saleswomen in the\r\nmantle department of the Paradise, whose counter was visible through\r\nthe first floor window. Baudu, for his part, though his anger was\r\nwritten on his face, merely remarked: "All is not gold that glitters.\r\nPatience!"\r\n\r\nThe members of the family evidently kept back the flood of rancour\r\nrising in their throats. A feeling of self-esteem prevented them from\r\ndisplaying their temper before these children, who had only that\r\nmorning arrived. At last the draper made an effort, and tore himself\r\naway from the spectacle of The Paradise and its sales.\r\n\r\n"Well!" he resumed, "we\'ll go and see Vin\xc3\xa7ard. Situations are soon\r\nsnatched up and it might be too late to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHowever, before starting, he ordered his junior salesman to go to the\r\nrailway station to fetch Denise\'s box. On her side Madame Baudu, to\r\nwhom the girl had confided P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, decided to run over to see Madame Gras\r\nin order to arrange about the child. Jean on the other hand promised\r\nhis sister not to stir from the shop.\r\n\r\n"It\'s two minutes\' walk," explained Baudu as he went down the Rue\r\nGaillon with his niece: "Vin\xc3\xa7ard has a silk business, and still does a\r\nfair trade. Oh, of course he has his worries, like every one else, but\r\nhe\'s an artful fellow, who makes both ends meet by his miserly ways. I\r\nfancy, though, he wants to retire, on account of his rheumatics."\r\n\r\nVin\xc3\xa7ard\'s shop was in the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, near the Passage\r\nChoiseul. It was clean and light, well fitted up in the modern style,\r\nbut rather small, and contained but a poor stock. Baudu and Denise\r\nfound Vin\xc3\xa7ard in consultation with two gentlemen.\r\n\r\n"Never mind us," called out the draper; "we are in no hurry; we can\r\nwait." And discreetly returning to the door he whispered to Denise:\r\n"That thin fellow is second in the silk department at The Paradise, and\r\nthe stout man is a silk manufacturer from Lyons."\r\n\r\nDenise gathered that Vin\xc3\xa7ard was trying to sell his business to\r\nRobineau of The Paradise. With a frank air, and open face, he was\r\ngiving his word of honour, with the facility of a man whom assurances\r\nnever troubled. According to him, his business was a golden one; and\r\nalbeit in the splendour of robust health he broke off to whine and\r\ncomplain of those infernal pains of his which prevented him from\r\nremaining in business and making his fortune. Robineau who seemed\r\nnervous and uneasy interrupted him impatiently. He knew what a crisis\r\nthe trade was passing through, and named a silk warehouse which had\r\nalready been ruined by the vicinity of The Paradise. Then Vin\xc3\xa7ard,\r\ninflamed, raised his voice.\r\n\r\n"No wonder! The downfall of that big booby Vabre was a foregone\r\nconclusion. His wife spent everything he earned. Besides, we are more\r\nthan five hundred yards away, whilst Vabre was almost next door to The\r\nParadise."\r\n\r\nGaujean, the silk manufacturer, then chimed in, and their voices\r\nfell again. He accused the big establishments of ruining French\r\nmanufactures; three or four laid down the law, reigning like masters\r\nover the market; and he gave it as his opinion that the only way to\r\nfight them was to favour the small traders; above all, those who dealt\r\nin specialties, for to them the future belonged. For that reason he\r\noffered Robineau plenty of credit.\r\n\r\n"See how you have been treated at The Paradise," said he. "No notice\r\nhas been taken of your long service. You had the promise of the\r\nfirst-hand\'s place long ago, when Bouthemont, an outsider without any\r\nclaim at all, came in and got it at once."\r\n\r\nRobineau was still smarting under this act of injustice. However, he\r\nhesitated to start business on his own account, explaining that the\r\nmoney came from his wife, who had inherited sixty thousand francs, and\r\nhe was full of scruples regarding this money, saying that he would\r\nrather cut off his right hand than compromise it in a doubtful affair.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "I haven\'t yet made up my mind; give me time to think\r\nover it. We\'ll have another talk about it."\r\n\r\n"As you like," replied Vin\xc3\xa7ard, concealing his disappointment under\r\na smiling countenance. "My interest, you know, is not to sell; and I\r\ncertainly shouldn\'t were it not for my rheumatics----"\r\n\r\nThen stepping to the middle of the shop, he inquired: "What can I do\r\nfor you, Monsieur Baudu?"\r\n\r\nThe draper, who had been slily listening, thereupon introduced Denise,\r\ntelling Vin\xc3\xa7ard as much as he thought necessary of her story and adding\r\nthat she had two years\' country experience. "And as I heard you are\r\nwanting a good saleswoman----" he added.\r\n\r\nBut Vin\xc3\xa7ard, affecting extreme sorrow, cut him short: "How\r\nunfortunate!" said he. "I had, indeed, been looking for a saleswoman\r\nall this week; but I\'ve just engaged one--not two hours ago."\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. Denise seemed to be in consternation. Robineau,\r\nwho was looking at her with interest, probably inspired with pity by\r\nher poverty-stricken appearance, ventured to remark: "I know they\'re\r\nwanting a young person at our place, in the mantle department."\r\n\r\nAt this Baudu could not restrain a fervent outburst: "At your place\r\nindeed! Never!"\r\n\r\nThen he stopped short in embarrassment. Denise had turned very red;\r\nshe would never dare to enter that great shop, and yet the idea of\r\nbelonging to it filled her with pride.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Robineau, surprised. "It would be a good opening\r\nfor the young lady. I advise her to go and see Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, the\r\nfirst-hand, to-morrow. The worst that can happen to her is to be\r\nrefused."\r\n\r\nThe draper, to conceal his inward revolt, then began talking vaguely.\r\nHe knew Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, or, at least, her husband, Lhomme, the cashier,\r\na stout man, who had had his right arm crushed by an omnibus. Then\r\nsuddenly turning to Denise, he added: "However, it\'s her business, it\r\nisn\'t mine. She can do as she likes."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he went off, after wishing Gaujean and Robineau\r\n"good-day". Vin\xc3\xa7ard accompanied him as far as the door, reiterating\r\nhis regrets. The girl meantime had remained in the middle of the shop,\r\nintimidated yet desirous of asking Robineau for further particulars.\r\nHowever she could not muster the courage to do so, but in her turn\r\nbowed, and simply said: "Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\nOn the way back, Baudu said nothing to his niece, but as if carried\r\naway by his reflections walked on very fast, forcing her to run in\r\norder to keep up with him. On reaching the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, he\r\nwas about to enter his establishment when a neighbouring shopkeeper,\r\nstanding at his door, called to him.\r\n\r\nDenise stopped and waited.\r\n\r\n"What is it, P\xc3\xa8re Bourras?" asked the draper.\r\n\r\nBourras was a tall old man, with a prophet\'s head, bearded and hairy,\r\nwith piercing eyes shining from under bushy brows. He kept an umbrella\r\nand walking-stick shop, did repairs, and even carved handles, which\r\nhad won for him an artistic celebrity in the neighbourhood. Denise\r\nglanced at the windows of his shop where the sticks and umbrellas were\r\narranged in straight lines. But on raising her eyes she was astonished\r\nby the appearance of the house--it was an old hovel squeezed in between\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise and a large Louis XIV. mansion; you could hardly\r\nconceive how it had sprung up in the narrow slit where its two low\r\ndumpy storeys displayed themselves. Had it not been for the support of\r\nthe buildings on either side it must have fallen; the slates of its\r\nroof were old and rotten, and its two-windowed front was cracked and\r\ncovered with stains, running down in long rusty lines to the worm-eaten\r\nsign-board over the shop.\r\n\r\n"You know he\'s written to my landlord, offering to buy the house?" said\r\nBourras, looking steadily at the draper with his fiery eyes.\r\n\r\nBaudu became paler still, and bent his shoulders. There was a silence,\r\nduring which the two men remained face to face, looking very serious.\r\n\r\n"We must be prepared for anything," murmured Baudu at last.\r\n\r\nThereupon Bourras flew into a passion, shaking his hair and flowing\r\nbeard while he shouted: "Let him buy the house, he\'ll have to pay four\r\ntimes the value for it! But I swear that as long as I live he shan\'t\r\ntouch a stone of it. My lease has twelve years to run yet. We shall\r\nsee! we shall see!"\r\n\r\nIt was a declaration of war. Bourras was looking towards The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, which neither of them had named. For a moment Baudu remained\r\nshaking his head in silence, and then crossed the street to his shop,\r\nhis legs almost failing him as he repeated: "Ah! good Lord! ah! good\r\nLord!"\r\n\r\nDenise, who had listened, followed her uncle. Madame Baudu had just\r\ncome back with P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, whom Madame Gras had agreed to receive at any\r\ntime. Jean, however, had disappeared, and this made his sister anxious.\r\nWhen he returned with a flushed face, talking in an animated way of\r\nthe boulevards, she looked at him with such a sad expression that he\r\nblushed with shame. Meantime their box had arrived, and it was arranged\r\nthat they should sleep in the attic.\r\n\r\n"Ah! By the way, how did you get on at Vin\xc3\xa7ard\'s?" inquired Madame\r\nBaudu.\r\n\r\nThe draper thereupon gave an account of his fruitless errand, adding\r\nthat Denise had heard of a situation; and, pointing to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise with a scornful gesture, he exclaimed: "There--in there!"\r\n\r\nThe whole family felt hurt at the idea. The first dinner was at five\r\no\'clock. Denise and the two children sat down to it with Baudu,\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve, and Colomban. A single gas jet lighted and warmed the little\r\ndining-room which reeked with the smell of food. The meal passed off in\r\nsilence, but at dessert Madame Baudu, who was restless, left the shop,\r\nand came and sat down behind Denise. And then the storm, kept back\r\nall day, broke out, one and all seeking to relieve their feelings by\r\nabusing the "monster".\r\n\r\n"It\'s your business, you can do as you like," repeated Baudu. "We\r\ndon\'t want to influence you. But if you only knew what sort of place\r\nit is----" And in broken sentences he commenced to relate the story\r\nof that Octave Mouret to whom The Paradise belonged. He had been\r\nwonderfully lucky! A fellow who had come up from the South of France\r\nwith the smiling audacity of an adventurer, who had no sooner arrived\r\nin Paris than he had begun to distinguish himself by all sorts of\r\ndisgraceful pranks, figuring most prominently in a matrimonial scandal,\r\nwhich was still the talk of the neighbourhood; and who, to crown all,\r\nhad suddenly and mysteriously made the conquest of Madame H\xc3\xa9douin, who\r\nhad brought him The Ladies\' Paradise as a marriage portion.\r\n\r\n"That poor Caroline!" interrupted Madame Baudu. "We were distantly\r\nrelated. If she had lived things would be different. She wouldn\'t have\r\nlet them ruin us like this. And he\'s the man who killed her. Yes, with\r\nthat very building! One morning, when she was visiting the works,\r\nshe fell into a hole, and three days after she died. A fine, strong,\r\nhealthy woman, who had never known what illness was! There\'s some of\r\nher blood in the foundations of that house."\r\n\r\nSo speaking she pointed to the establishment opposite with her pale\r\nand trembling hand. Denise, listening as to a fairy tale, slightly\r\nshuddered; the sense of fear which had mingled with the temptation\r\nshe had felt since morning, was due, perhaps, to the presence of that\r\nwoman\'s blood, which she fancied she could now detect in the red mortar\r\nof the basement.\r\n\r\n"It seems as if it brought him good luck," added Madame Baudu, without\r\nmentioning Mouret by name.\r\n\r\nBut the draper, full of disdain for these old women\'s tales, shrugged\r\nhis shoulders and resumed his story, explaining the situation\r\ncommercially. The Ladies\' Paradise had been founded in 1822 by two\r\nbrothers, named Deleuze. On the death of the elder, his daughter,\r\nCaroline, had married the son of a linen manufacturer, Charles H\xc3\xa9douin;\r\nand, later on, becoming a widow, she had married Mouret. She thus\r\nbrought him a half share in the business. Three months after the\r\nmarriage, however, the second brother Deleuze died childless; so that\r\nwhen Caroline met her death, Mouret became sole heir, sole proprietor\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise. Yes, he had been wonderfully lucky!\r\n\r\n"He\'s what they call a man of ideas, a dangerous busybody, who will\r\noverturn the whole neighbourhood if he\'s left to himself!" continued\r\nBaudu. "I fancy that Caroline, who was rather romantic also, must have\r\nbeen carried away by the gentleman\'s extravagant plans. In short, he\r\npersuaded her to buy the house on the left, then the one on the right;\r\nand he himself, on becoming his own master, bought two others; so that\r\nthe establishment has kept on growing and growing to such a point that\r\nit now threatens to swallow us all up!"\r\n\r\nHe was addressing Denise, but was in reality speaking for himself,\r\nfeeling a feverish longing to recapitulate this story which continually\r\nhaunted him. At home he was always angry and full of bile, always\r\nviolent, with fists ever clenched. Madame Baudu, ceasing to interfere,\r\nsat motionless on her chair; Genevi\xc3\xa8ve and Colomban, with eyes cast\r\ndown, were picking up and eating the crumbs off the table, just for the\r\nsake of something to do. It was so warm, so stuffy in that tiny room\r\nthat P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 had fallen asleep with his head on the table, and even Jean\'s\r\neyes were closing.\r\n\r\n"But wait a bit!" resumed Baudu, seized with a sudden fit of anger,\r\n"such jokers always go to smash! Mouret is hard-pushed just now; I\r\nknow that for a fact. He\'s been forced to spend all his savings on his\r\nmania for extensions and advertisements. Moreover, in order to raise\r\nadditional capital, he has induced most of his shop-people to invest\r\nall they possess with him. And so he hasn\'t a sou to help himself with\r\nnow; and, unless a miracle be worked, and he manages to treble his\r\nsales, as he hopes to do, you\'ll see what a crash there\'ll be! Ah! I\'m\r\nnot ill-natured, but that day I\'ll illuminate my shop-front, I will, on\r\nmy word of honour!"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on in a revengeful voice; to hear him you would have\r\nthought that the fall of The Ladies\' Paradise would restore the\r\ndignity and prestige of commerce. Had any one ever seen such doings?\r\nA draper\'s shop selling everything! Why not call it a bazaar at once?\r\nAnd the employees! a nice set they were too--a lot of puppies, who\r\ndid their work like porters at a railway station, treating both goods\r\nand customers as if they were so many parcels; taking themselves off\r\nor getting the sack at a moment\'s notice. No affection, no morals,\r\nno taste! And all at once he appealed to Colomban as a witness; he,\r\nColomban, brought up in the good old school, knew how long it took to\r\nlearn all the cunning and trickery of the trade. The art was not to\r\nsell much, but to sell dear. And then too, Colomban could tell them how\r\nhe had been treated, carefully looked after, his washing and mending\r\ndone, nursed in illness, considered as one of the family--loved, in\r\nfact!\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," repeated Colomban, after each statement made by\r\nhis governor.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you\'re the last of the old stock, my dear fellow," Baudu ended by\r\ndeclaring. "After you\'re gone there\'ll be none left. You are my sole\r\nconsolation, for if all that hurry and scurry is what they now call\r\nbusiness I understand nothing of it and would rather clear out."\r\n\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve, with her head on one side as if her thick hair were weighing\r\ndown her pale brow, sat watching the smiling shopman; and in her\r\nglance there was a gleam of suspicion, a wish to see whether Colomban,\r\nstricken with remorse, would not blush at all this praise. But, like\r\na fellow well acquainted with every trick of the old style of trade,\r\nhe retained his sedateness, his good-natured air, with just a touch of\r\ncunning about his lips. However, Baudu still went on, louder than ever,\r\naccusing the people opposite--that pack of savages who murdered each\r\nother in their struggle for existence--of even destroying all family\r\nties. And he mentioned his country neighbours, the Lhommes--mother,\r\nfather, and son--all employed in the infernal shop, people who\r\nvirtually had no home but were always out and about, leading a hotel,\r\n_table d\'h\xc3\xb4te_ kind of existence, and never taking a meal at their\r\nown place excepting on Sundays. Certainly his dining-room wasn\'t over\r\nlarge or too well aired or lighted; but at least it spoke to him of his\r\nlife, for he had lived there amidst the affection of his kith and kin.\r\nWhilst speaking, his eyes wandered about the room; and he shuddered\r\nat the unavowed idea that if those savages should succeed in ruining\r\nhis trade they might some day turn him out of this hole where he was\r\nso comfortable with his wife and child. Notwithstanding the seeming\r\nassurance with which he predicted the utter downfall of his rivals, he\r\nwas in reality terrified, feeling at heart that the neighbourhood was\r\nbeing gradually invaded and devoured.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t want to disgust you," he resumed, trying to calm\r\nhimself; "if you think it to your interest to go there, I shall be the\r\nfirst to say, \'go.\'"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of that, uncle," murmured Denise in bewilderment, her desire\r\nto enter The Ladies\' Paradise, growing keener and keener amidst all\r\nthis display of passion.\r\n\r\nBaudu had put his elbows on the table, and was wearying her with\r\nhis fixed stare. "But look here," he resumed; "you who know the\r\nbusiness, do you think it right that a simple draper\'s shop should\r\nsell everything? Formerly, when trade was trade, drapers sold nothing\r\nbut drapery. But now they are doing their best to snap up every branch\r\nof trade and ruin their neighbours. The whole neighbourhood complains\r\nof it, every small tradesman is beginning to suffer terribly. This\r\nman Mouret is ruining them. For instance, B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9 and his sister, who\r\nkeep the hosiery shop in the Rue Gaillon, have already lost half their\r\ncustomers; Mademoiselle Tatin, who sells under-linen in the Passage\r\nChoiseul, has been obliged to lower her prices, to be able to sell at\r\nall. And the effects of this scourge, this pest, are felt as far as\r\nthe Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, where I hear that Messrs. Vanpouille\r\nBrothers, the furriers, cannot hold out much longer. Ah! Drapers\r\nselling fur goods--what a farce! another of Mouret\'s ideas!"\r\n\r\n"And gloves," added Madame Baudu; "isn\'t it monstrous? He has even\r\ndared to add a glove department! Yesterday, when I passed down the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin, I saw Quinette, the glover, at his door, looking\r\nso downcast that I hadn\'t the heart to ask him how business was going."\r\n\r\n"And umbrellas," resumed Baudu; "that\'s the climax! Bourras is\r\nconvinced that Mouret simply wants to ruin him; for, in short, where\'s\r\nthe rhyme between umbrellas and drapery? But Bourras is firm on his\r\nlegs, and won\'t let himself be butchered! We shall see some fun one of\r\nthese days."\r\n\r\nThen Baudu went on to speak of other tradesmen, passing the whole\r\nneighbourhood in review. Now and again he let slip a confession. If\r\nVin\xc3\xa7ard wanted to sell it was time for the rest to pack up, for Vin\xc3\xa7ard\r\nwas like the rats who make haste to leave a house when it threatens\r\nruin. Then, however, immediately afterwards, he contradicted himself,\r\nand talked of an alliance, an understanding between the small tradesmen\r\nto enable them to fight the colossus. For a moment, his hands shaking,\r\nand his mouth twitching nervously, he hesitated as to whether he should\r\nspeak of himself. At last he made up his mind to do so.\r\n\r\n"As for me," he said, "I can\'t complain as yet. Of course he has\r\ndone me harm, the scoundrel! But up to the present he has only kept\r\nladies\' cloths, light stuffs for dresses and heavier goods for mantles.\r\nPeople still come to me for men\'s goods, velvets and velveteens for\r\nshooting suits, cloths for liveries, without speaking of flannels and\r\n_molletons_, of which I defy him to show so complete an assortment as\r\nmy own. But he thinks he will annoy me by placing his cloth department\r\nright in front of my door. You\'ve seen his display, haven\'t you? He\r\nalways places his finest mantles there, surrounded by a framework of\r\ncloth in pieces--a cheapjack parade to tempt the hussies. Upon my word,\r\nI should be ashamed to use such means! The Old Elbeuf has been known\r\nfor nearly a hundred years, and has no need of any such catchpenny\r\ndevices at its door. As long as I live, it shall remain as I took it,\r\nwith its four samples on each side, and nothing more!"\r\n\r\nThe whole family was becoming affected; and after a spell of silence\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve ventured to make a remark:\r\n\r\n"Our customers know and like us, papa," said she. "We mustn\'t lose\r\nheart. Madame Desforges and Madame de Boves have been to-day, and I am\r\nexpecting Madame Marty for some flannel."\r\n\r\n"For my part," declared Colomban, "I took an order from Madame\r\nBourdelais yesterday. \'Tis true she spoke of an English cheviot marked\r\nup opposite ten sous cheaper than ours, and the same stuff, it appears."\r\n\r\n"Fancy," murmured Madame Baudu in her weak voice, "we knew that house\r\nwhen it was scarcely larger than a handkerchief! Yes, my dear Denise,\r\nwhen the Deleuzes started it, it had only one window in the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin; and such a tiny one, there was barely room for a\r\ncouple of pieces of print and two or three pieces of calico. There was\r\nno room to turn round in the shop, it was so small. At that time The\r\nOld Elbeuf, after sixty years\' trading, was already such as you see it\r\nnow. Ah! all has greatly changed, greatly changed!"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; the drama of her whole life was expressed in those\r\nfew words. Born in the old house, she loved each of its damp stones,\r\nliving only for it and by it; and, formerly so proud of that house,\r\nthe finest, the best patronised in the neighbourhood, she had had\r\nthe daily grief of seeing the rival establishment gradually growing\r\nin importance, at first disdained, then equal to her own and finally\r\ntowering above it, and threatening all. This was to her an ever-open\r\nsore; she was slowly dying from sheer grief at seeing The Old Elbeuf\r\nhumiliated; if she still lived it was, as in the case of the shop\r\nitself, solely by the effect of impulsion; but she well realised that\r\nthe death of the shop would be hers as well, and that she would pass\r\naway on the day when it should close.\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Baudu began softly beating a tattoo with his fingers on\r\nthe American cloth on the table. He experienced a sort of lassitude,\r\nalmost a regret at having once more relieved his feelings in this way.\r\nThe whole family shared his despondency, and with dreamy eyes chewed\r\nthe cud of his bitter story. They never had had any luck. The children\r\nhad been brought up and fortune had seemed at hand, when suddenly this\r\ncompetition had arisen and ruined all their hopes. And there was, also,\r\nthat house at Rambouillet, that country house to which the draper had\r\nbeen dreaming of retiring for the last ten years--a bargain, he had\r\nthought when he acquired it, but it had proved a sorry old building,\r\nalways in want of repairs, and he had let it to people who never\r\npaid any rent. His last profits were swallowed up by this place--the\r\nonly folly he had been guilty of in his honest, upright career as a\r\ntradesman stubbornly attached to the old ways.\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" he suddenly exclaimed, "we must make room for the others.\r\nThat\'s enough of this useless talk!"\r\n\r\nIt was like an awakening. The gas was hissing in the lifeless, stifling\r\nair of the tiny room. They all jumped up, breaking the melancholy\r\nsilence. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, however, was sleeping so soundly that they decided to\r\nlay him on some bales of cloth. Jean had already returned to the street\r\ndoor yawning.\r\n\r\n"In short," repeated Baudu to his niece, "you can do as you like.\r\nWe have explained the matter to you, that\'s all. You know your own\r\nbusiness best."\r\n\r\nHe gave her an urgent glance, waiting for a decisive answer. But\r\nDenise, whom these stories had inspired with a still greater longing to\r\nenter The Ladies\' Paradise, instead of turning her from it, retained\r\nher quiet gentle demeanour beneath which lurked a genuine Norman\r\nobstinacy. And she simply replied: "We\'ll see, uncle."\r\n\r\nThen she spoke of going to bed early with the children, for they were\r\nall three very tired. But it had only just struck six, so she decided\r\nto stay in the shop a little longer. Night had now come on, and she\r\nfound the street quite dark, drenched by a fine close rain, which had\r\nbeen falling since sunset. It came on her as a surprise. A few minutes\r\nhad sufficed to fill the roadway with puddles, a stream of dirty\r\nwater was running along the gutters, the pavement was sticky with a\r\nthick black mud; and through the beating rain she saw nothing but a\r\nconfused stream of umbrellas, pushing along and swelling in the gloom\r\nlike great black wings. She started back at first, feeling very cold,\r\noppressed at heart by the badly-lighted shop, now so extremely dismal.\r\nA moist breeze, the breath of that old quarter of Paris, came in from\r\nthe street; it seemed as if the rain, streaming from the umbrellas,\r\nwas running right up to the counters, as if the pavement with its mud\r\nand its puddles was coming into the shop, putting the finishing touch\r\nto the mouldiness of that ancient, cavernous ground-floor, white with\r\nsaltpetre. It was quite a vision of old Paris in the wet, and it made\r\nher shiver with distressful astonishment at finding the great city so\r\ncold and so ugly.\r\n\r\nBut across the road The Ladies\' Paradise glowed with its deep, serried\r\nlines of gas jets. She moved nearer, again attracted and, as it were,\r\nwarmed by that ardent blaze. The machine was still roaring, active as\r\never, letting its steam escape with a last roar, whilst the salesmen\r\nfolded up the stuffs, and the cashiers counted the receipts. Seen\r\nthrough the hazy windows, the lights swarmed vaguely, revealing a\r\nconfused factory-like interior. Behind the curtain of falling rain,\r\nthe vision, blurred and distant, assumed the appearance of a giant\r\nfurnace-house, where the shadows of firemen passed black against the\r\nred glare of the furnaces. The displays in the windows likewise became\r\nindistinct: you could only distinguish the snowy lace, its whiteness\r\nheightened by the ground glass globes of a row of gas jets, and against\r\nthis chapel-like background the ready-made goods stood out vigorously,\r\nthe velvet mantle trimmed with silver fox setting amidst them all the\r\ncurved silhouette of a headless woman who seemed to be running through\r\nthe rain to some entertainment in the unknown shades of nocturnal Paris.\r\n\r\nDenise, yielding to the fascination, had gone to the door, heedless of\r\nthe raindrops dripping upon her. At this hour, The Ladies\' Paradise,\r\nwith its furnace-like brilliancy, completed its conquest of her. In the\r\ngreat metropolis, black and silent beneath the rain--in this Paris, to\r\nwhich she was a stranger, it shone out like a lighthouse, and seemed\r\nto be of itself the life and light of the city. She dreamed of her\r\nfuture there, working hard to bring up the children, with other things\r\nbesides--she hardly knew what--far-off things however, the desire and\r\nfear of which made her tremble. The idea of that woman who had met her\r\ndeath amidst the foundations came back to her; and she felt afraid,\r\nfancying that the lights were tinged with blood; but the whiteness of\r\nthe lace quieted her, a hope, quite a certainty of happiness, sprang up\r\nin her heart, whilst the fine rain, blowing on her, cooled her hands,\r\nand calmed the feverishness within her, born of her journey.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Bourras," all at once said a voice behind her.\r\n\r\nShe leant forward, and perceived the umbrella-maker, motionless before\r\nthe window containing the ingenious roof-like construction of umbrellas\r\nand walking-sticks which she had noticed in the morning. The old man\r\nhad slipped up there in the dark, to feast his eyes on that triumphant\r\nshow; and so great was his grief that he was unconscious of the rain\r\nbeating down on his bare head, and streaming off his long white hair.\r\n\r\n"How stupid he is, he\'ll make himself ill," resumed the voice.\r\n\r\nThen, turning round, Denise again found the Baudus behind her. Though\r\nthey thought Bourras so stupid, they also, despite themselves, ever\r\nand ever returned to the contemplation of that spectacle which rent\r\ntheir hearts. It was, so to say, a rageful desire to suffer. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve,\r\nvery pale, had noticed that Colomban was watching the shadows of the\r\nsaleswomen pass to and fro on the first floor opposite; and, whilst\r\nBaudu almost choked with suppressed rancour, Madame Baudu began\r\nsilently weeping.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll go and see, to-morrow, won\'t you, Denise?" asked the draper,\r\ntormented with uncertainty, but feeling that his niece was conquered\r\nlike the rest.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then gently replied: "Yes, uncle, unless it pains you\r\ntoo much."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at half-past seven, Denise was outside The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, wishing to call there before taking Jean to his new place,\r\nwhich was a long way off, at the top of the Faubourg du Temple. But,\r\naccustomed as she was to early hours, she had come down too soon; the\r\nemployees were barely arriving and, afraid of looking ridiculous,\r\novercome by timidity, she remained for a moment walking up and down the\r\nPlace Gaillon.\r\n\r\nThe cold wind that blew had already dried the pavement. From all the\r\nsurrounding streets, illumined by a pale early light, falling from an\r\nashen sky, shopmen were hurriedly approaching with their coat-collars\r\nturned up, and their hands in their pockets, taken unawares by this\r\nfirst chill of winter. Most of them hurried along alone, and vanished\r\ninto the warehouse, without addressing a word or look to their\r\ncolleagues marching along around them. Others however came up in twos\r\nand threes, talking fast, and monopolising the whole of the pavement;\r\nand all, with a similar gesture, flung away their cigarettes or cigars\r\nbefore crossing the threshold.\r\n\r\nDenise noticed that several of the gentlemen took stock of her in\r\npassing. This increased her timidity; and she no longer had courage to\r\nfollow them, but resolved to wait till they had entered, blushing at\r\nthe mere idea of being elbowed at the door by all these men. However\r\nthe stream of salesmen still flowed on, and in order to escape their\r\nlooks, she took a walk round the Place. When she came back again, she\r\nfound a tall young man, pale and awkward, who appeared to be waiting\r\nlike herself.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, mademoiselle," he finished by stammering, "but\r\nperhaps you belong to the establishment?"\r\n\r\nShe was so troubled at hearing a stranger address her that she did not\r\nat first reply.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," he continued, getting more confused than ever, "I\r\nthought of applying to see if I could get an engagement, and you might\r\nhave given me a little information."\r\n\r\nHe was as timid as she was, and had probably risked speaking to her\r\nbecause he divined that she was trembling like himself.\r\n\r\n"I would with pleasure, sir," she at last replied. "But I\'m no better\r\noff than you are; I\'m just going to apply myself."\r\n\r\n"Ah, very good," said he, quite out of countenance.\r\n\r\nThereupon they both blushed deeply, and still all timidity remained for\r\na moment face to face, affected by the striking similarity of their\r\npositions yet not daring to openly express a desire for each other\'s\r\nsuccess. Then, as nothing further fell from either and both became more\r\nand more uncomfortable, they parted awkwardly, and renewed their wait,\r\none on either side at a distance of a few steps.\r\n\r\nThe shopmen continued to arrive, and Denise could now hear them joking\r\nas they passed, casting side glances towards her. Her confusion\r\nincreased at finding herself thus on exhibition, and she had decided\r\nto take half an hour\'s walk in the neighbourhood, when the sight of a\r\nyoung man approaching rapidly by way of the Rue Port-Mahon, detained\r\nher for another moment. He was probably the manager of a department,\r\nthought she, for all the others raised their hats to him. Tall, with a\r\nclear skin and carefully trimmed beard, he had eyes the colour of old\r\ngold and of a velvety softness, which he fixed on her for a moment as\r\nhe crossed the Place. He was already entering the shop with an air of\r\nindifference, while she remained motionless, quite upset by that glance\r\nof his, filled indeed with a singular emotion, in which there was more\r\nuneasiness than pleasure. Without doubt, fear was gaining on her, and,\r\nto give herself time to collect her courage, she began slowly walking\r\ndown the Rue Gaillon, and then along the Rue Saint-Roch.\r\n\r\nThe person who had so disturbed her was more than the manager of a\r\ndepartment, it was Octave Mouret in person. He had been making a night\r\nof it, and his tightly buttoned overcoat concealed a dress suit and\r\nwhite tie. In all haste he ran upstairs to his rooms, washed himself\r\nand changed his clothes, and when he at last seated himself at his\r\ntable, in his private office on the first floor, he was at his ease\r\nand full of strength, with bright eyes and cool skin, as ready for\r\nwork as if he had enjoyed ten hours\' sleep. The spacious office,\r\nfurnished in old oak and hung with green rep, had but one ornament, the\r\nportrait of that Madame H\xc3\xa9douin, who was still the talk of the whole\r\nneighbourhood. Since her death Octave ever thought of her with tender\r\nregret, grateful as he felt to her for the fortune she had bestowed on\r\nhim with her hand. And before commencing to sign the drafts laid upon\r\nhis blotting-pad he darted upon her portrait the contented smile of a\r\nhappy man. Was it not always before her that he returned to work, after\r\nthe escapades of his present single-blessedness?\r\n\r\nThere came a knock however, and before Mouret could answer, a young\r\nman entered, a tall, bony fellow, very gentlemanly and correct in\r\nhis appearance, with thin lips, a sharp nose and smooth hair already\r\nshowing signs of turning grey. Mouret raised his eyes, then whilst\r\nstill signing the drafts, remarked:\r\n\r\n"I hope you slept well, Bourdoncle?"\r\n\r\n"Very well, thanks," replied the young man, walking about as if he were\r\nquite at home.\r\n\r\nBourdoncle, the son of a poor farmer near Limoges, had begun his career\r\nat The Ladies\' Paradise at the same time as Mouret, when it only\r\noccupied the corner of the Place Gaillon. Very intelligent and very\r\nactive, it then seemed as if he would easily supplant his comrade, who\r\nwas much less steady, and far too fond of love-affairs; but he had\r\nneither the instinctive genius of the impassioned Southerner, nor his\r\naudacity, nor his winning grace. Besides, by a wise instinct, he had,\r\nfrom the first bowed before him, obedient without a struggle. When\r\nMouret had advised his people to put their money into the business,\r\nBourdoncle had been one of the first to do so, even investing in the\r\nestablishment the proceeds of an unexpected legacy left him by an aunt;\r\nand little by little, after passing through all the various stages,\r\nsuch as salesman, second, and then first-hand in the silk department,\r\nhe had become one of Octave\'s most cherished and influential\r\nlieutenants, one of the six int\xc3\xa9ress\xc3\xa9s[1] who assisted him to govern\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise--forming something like a privy council under\r\nan absolute king. Each one watched over a department or province.\r\nBourdoncle, for his part, exercised a general surveillance.\r\n\r\n[1] In the great Paris magasins de nouveaut\xc3\xa9s such as the Louvre and\r\nBon March\xc3\xa9 there have been at various stages numerous int\xc3\xa9ress\xc3\xa9s, that\r\nis partners of a kind who whilst entitled to some share of the profits,\r\nexercise but a strictly limited control in the management of the\r\nestablishment\'s affairs.--_Trans._\r\n\r\n"And you," resumed he, familiarly, "have you slept Well?"\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret replied that he had not been to bed, he shook his head,\r\nmurmuring: "Bad habits."\r\n\r\n"Why?" replied the other, gaily. "I\'m not so tired as you are, my dear\r\nfellow. You are half asleep now, you lead too quiet a life. Take a\r\nlittle amusement, that\'ll wake you up a bit."\r\n\r\nThis was their constant friendly dispute. Bourdoncle who professed to\r\nhate all women, contented himself with encouraging the extravagance\r\nof the lady customers, feeling meantime the greatest disdain for\r\nthe frivolity which led them to ruin themselves in stupid gewgaws.\r\nMouret, on the contrary, affected to worship them, ever showed himself\r\ndelighted and cajoling in their presence and was ever embarking in\r\nfresh love-affairs. This served, as it were, as an advertisement for\r\nhis business; and you might have said that he enveloped all women in\r\nthe same caress the better to bewilder them and keep them at his mercy.\r\n\r\n"I saw Madame Desforges last night, she was looking delicious at that\r\nball," said he, beginning to relate his evening experiences. But then,\r\nabruptly breaking off, he took up another bundle of drafts, which he\r\nbegan to sign whilst Bourdoncle continued to walk about, stepping\r\ntowards the lofty plate-glass windows whence he glanced into the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin. Then, retracing his steps, he suddenly exclaimed:\r\n"You know they\'ll have their revenge."\r\n\r\n"Who will?" asked Mouret, who had lost the thread of the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Why, the women."\r\n\r\nAt this, Mouret became quite merry, displaying, beneath his adorative\r\nmanner, his really brutal character. With a shrug of the shoulders he\r\nseemed to declare he would throw them all over, like so many empty\r\nsacks, as soon as they should have finished helping him to make his\r\nfortune. But Bourdoncle in his frigid way obstinately repeated: "They\r\nwill have their revenge; there will be one who will some day avenge all\r\nthe others. It\'s bound to be."\r\n\r\n"No fear," cried Mouret, exaggerating his Southern accent. "That one\r\nisn\'t born yet, my boy. And if she comes, you know, why there----"\r\n\r\nSo saying he raised his penholder, brandishing it and pointing it in\r\nthe air, as if he were bent on stabbing some invisible heart with a\r\nknife. Bourdoncle thereupon resumed his walk, bowing as usual before\r\nthe superiority of the governor, whose genius, with all its lapses,\r\ndisconcerted him. He, himself so clear-headed, logical and passionless,\r\nincapable of falling into the toils of a syren, had yet to learn the\r\nfeminine character of success, all Paris yielding herself with a kiss\r\nto her boldest assailant.\r\n\r\nA silence fell, broken only by the sound of Mouret\'s pen. Then, in\r\nreply to his brief questions, Bourdoncle gave him various information\r\nrespecting of the great sale of winter novelties, which was to commence\r\non the following Monday. This was an important affair, the house was\r\nrisking its fortune in it; for the rumours of the neighbourhood had\r\nsome foundation, Mouret was throwing himself into speculation like\r\na poet, with such ostentation, such desire to attain the colossal,\r\nthat everything seemed likely to give way under him. It was quite a\r\nnew style of doing business, a seeming commercial phantasy which had\r\nformerly made Madame H\xc3\xa9douin anxious, and even now, notwithstanding\r\ncertain successes, quite dismayed those who had capital in the\r\nbusiness. They blamed the governor in secret for going too quick;\r\naccused him of having enlarged the establishment to a dangerous extent,\r\nbefore making sure of a sufficient increase of custom; above all, they\r\ntrembled on seeing him put all the available cash into one venture,\r\nfilling the departments with a pile of goods without leaving a copper\r\nin the reserve fund. Thus, for this winter sale, after the heavy sums\r\nrecently paid to the builders, the whole capital was exhausted and\r\nit once more became a question of victory or death. Yet Mouret in\r\nthe midst of all this excitement, preserved a triumphant gaiety, a\r\ncertainty of gaining millions, like a man so worshipped by women, that\r\nthere could be no question of betrayal. When Bourdoncle ventured to\r\nexpress certain fears with reference to the excessive development given\r\nto several departments of doubtful profit he gave vent to a laugh full\r\nof confidence, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Pooh, pooh! my dear fellow, the place is still too small!"\r\n\r\nThe other appeared dumbfounded, seized with a fear which he no longer\r\nattempted to conceal. The house too small! an establishment which\r\ncomprised nineteen departments, and numbered four hundred and three\r\nemployees!\r\n\r\n"Of course," resumed Mouret, "we shall be obliged to enlarge our\r\npremises again before another eighteen months are over. I\'m seriously\r\nthinking about the matter. Last night Madame Desforges promised to\r\nintroduce me to some one who may be useful. In short, we\'ll talk it\r\nover when the idea is ripe."\r\n\r\nThen having finished signing his drafts, he rose, and tapped his\r\nlieutenant on the shoulder in a friendly manner, but the latter could\r\nnot get over his astonishment. The fright displayed by the prudent\r\npeople around him amused Mouret. In one of those fits of brusque\r\nfrankness with which he sometimes overwhelmed his familiars, he\r\ndeclared that he was at heart a greater Jew than all the Jews in the\r\nworld; he took, said he, after his father, whom he resembled physically\r\nand morally, a fellow who knew the value of money; and, if his mother\r\nhad given him that dash of nervous fantasy which he displayed, it\r\nwas, perhaps, the principal element of his luck, for he felt that his\r\nability to dare everything was an invincible force.\r\n\r\n"Oh! You know very well that we\'ll stand by you to the last,"\r\nBourdoncle finished by saying.\r\n\r\nThen, before going down into the shop to give their usual look round,\r\nthey settled certain other details. They examined a specimen of a\r\nlittle book of account forms, which Mouret had just invented for the\r\nuse of his employees. Having remarked that the old-fashioned goods,\r\nthe dead stock, went off the more rapidly the higher the commission\r\nallowed to the employees, he had based on this observation quite a\r\nnew system, that of interesting his people in the sale of all the\r\ngoods, giving them a commission on even the smallest piece of stuff,\r\nthe most trumpery article they sold. This innovation had caused quite\r\na revolution in the drapery trade, creating between the salespeople\r\na struggle for existence of which the masters reaped the benefits.\r\nTo foment this struggle was indeed Mouret\'s favourite method, the\r\nprinciple which he constantly applied. He excited his employees\'\r\npassions, pitted one against the other, allowed the stronger to swallow\r\nup the weaker ones, and for his own part battened on this struggle of\r\nconflicting interests. The sample account book was duly approved of;\r\nat the top of each leaf on both counterfoil and bill form, appeared\r\nparticulars of the department and the salesman\'s number; then also in\r\nduplicate came columns for the measurement, the description of the\r\ngoods sold, and their price. The salesman simply signed the bill form\r\nbefore handing it to the cashier; and in this way an easy account was\r\nkept: it was only necessary to compare the bill-forms delivered by\r\nthe cashier\'s department to the clearing-house with the salesmen\'s\r\ncounterfoils. Every week the latter would receive their commission,\r\nwithout any possibility of error.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t be robbed so much," remarked Bourdoncle, with satisfaction.\r\n"This was a very good idea of yours."\r\n\r\n"And I thought of something else last night," explained Mouret. "Yes,\r\nmy dear fellow, at supper. I have an idea of giving the clearing-house\r\nclerks a little bonus for every error they detect while checking the\r\nbills. You understand, eh? Like this we shall be sure that they won\'t\r\npass any, for rather than do that they\'ll be inventing mistakes!"\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh, whilst the other looked at him admiringly. This new\r\napplication of the struggle-for-existence theory delighted Mouret;\r\nhe had a real genius for administrative functions, and dreamed of so\r\norganizing the establishment as to trade upon the selfish instincts of\r\nhis employees, for the greater satisfaction of his own appetites. He\r\noften said that to make people do their best, and even to keep them\r\nfairly honest, it was first of all necessary to excite their selfish\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s go downstairs," he resumed. "We must look after this sale.\r\nThe silk arrived yesterday, I believe, and Bouthemont must be getting\r\nit in now."\r\n\r\nBourdoncle followed him. The receiving office was in the basement on\r\nthe side of the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin. There, on a level with the\r\npavement, was a kind of glazed cage, into which the vans discharged the\r\ngoods. They were weighed, and then shot down a rapid slide, whose oak\r\nand iron work was polished by the constant chaffing of bales and cases.\r\nEverything entered by this yawning trap; it was a continuous swallowing\r\nup, a niagara of goods, falling with a roar like that of a torrent.\r\nAt the approach of big sale times especially, the slide brought down\r\nan endless stream of Lyons silks, English woollens, Flemish linens,\r\nAlsatian calicoes, and Rouen prints. The vans were sometimes obliged to\r\nwait their turn along the street; and as each bale rushed down to the\r\nbasement there arose a sound as of a stone thrown into deep water.\r\n\r\nOn his way Mouret stopped for a moment before the slide, which was in\r\nfull activity. Rows of cases were coming down of themselves, falling\r\nlike rain from some upper stream. Then bales appeared, toppling over in\r\ntheir descent like rolling stones. Mouret looked on, without saying a\r\nword. But this wealth of goods rushing in to his establishment at the\r\nrate of thousands of francs each minute, made his clear eyes glisten.\r\nHe had never before had such a clear, definite idea of the struggle he\r\nwas engaged in. It was this falling mountain of goods which he must\r\ncast to the four corners of Paris. He did not open his mouth, however,\r\nbut continued his inspection.\r\n\r\nBy the grey light which came in through the large vent-holes, a squad\r\nof men were receiving the goods, whilst others removed the lids of the\r\ncases and opened the bales in presence of the managers of different\r\ndepartments. A dockyard kind of bustle filled this basement, whose\r\nvaulted roofing was supported by wrought-iron pillars and whose bare\r\nwalls were simply cemented.\r\n\r\n"Have you got everything there, Bouthemont?" asked Mouret, approaching\r\na broad-shouldered young fellow who was checking the contents of a case.\r\n\r\n"Yes, everything seems all right," replied he, "but the counting will\r\ntake me all the morning."\r\n\r\nThen the manager of the silk department ran down an invoice he held,\r\nstanding the while before a large counter on which one of his salesmen\r\ndeposited, one by one, the pieces of silk which he took from an open\r\ncase. Behind them ran other counters, also littered with goods which\r\na small army of shopmen was examining. It was a general unpacking, a\r\nseeming confusion of stuffs, inspected, turned over, and marked, amidst\r\na continuous buzz of voices.\r\n\r\nBouthemont who was becoming a celebrity in the trade, had the round,\r\njovial face of a right good fellow, with a coal-black beard, and fine\r\nhazel eyes. Born at Montpellier, noisy, and over fond of pleasure,\r\nhe was not of much good for the sales, but in buying he had not his\r\nequal. Sent to Paris by his father, who kept a draper\'s shop in his\r\nnative town, he had absolutely refused to return home when the old\r\nfellow, thinking that he ought to know enough to succeed him in his\r\nbusiness, had summoned him to do so; and from that moment a rivalry\r\nhad sprung up between father and son, the former, absorbed in his\r\nlittle country business and shocked to see a simple shopman earning\r\nthree times as much as he did himself, and the latter joking at the\r\nold man\'s humdrum routine, chinking his money, and throwing the whole\r\nhouse into confusion at every flying visit he paid. Like the other\r\nmanagers, Bouthemont drew, besides his three thousand francs regular\r\npay, a commission on the sales. Montpellier, surprised and respectful,\r\nwhispered that young Bouthemont had made fifteen thousand francs the\r\nyear before, and that that was only a beginning--people prophesied to\r\nthe exasperated father that this figure would certainly increase.\r\n\r\nMeantime Bourdoncle had taken up one of the pieces of silk, and was\r\nexamining the texture with the eye of a connoisseur. It was a faille\r\nwith a blue and silver selvage, the famous Paris Delight, with which\r\nMouret hoped to strike a decisive blow.\r\n\r\n"It is really very good," observed Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\n"And the effect it produces is better than its real quality," said\r\nBouthemont. "Dumonteil is the only one capable of manufacturing such\r\nstuff. Last journey when I fell out with Gaujean, the latter was\r\nwilling to set a hundred looms to work on this pattern, but he asked\r\nfive sous a yard more."\r\n\r\nNearly every month Bouthemont went to Lyons, staying there days\r\ntogether, living at the best h\xc3\xb4tels, with orders to treat the\r\nmanufacturers with open purse. He enjoyed, moreover, a perfect liberty,\r\nand bought what he liked, provided that he increased the yearly\r\nbusiness of his department in a certain proportion, settled beforehand;\r\nand it was on this proportion that his commission was based. In short,\r\nhis position at The Ladies\' Paradise, like that of all the managers,\r\nwas that of a special tradesman, in a grouping of various businesses, a\r\nsort of vast trading city.\r\n\r\n"So," resumed he, "it\'s decided we mark it at five francs twelve sous?\r\nIt\'s barely the cost price, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, five francs twelve sous," said Mouret, quickly; "and if I\r\nwere alone, I\'d sell it at a loss."\r\n\r\nThe manager laughed heartily. "Oh! I don\'t mind, its cheapness will\r\ntreble the sales and my only interest is to secure heavy receipts---"\r\n\r\nBut Bourdoncle remained grave, biting his lips. For his part he drew\r\nhis commission on the total profits, and it was not to his advantage\r\nthat the prices should be lowered. As it happened, a part of his\r\nduties was to exercise a control over the prices fixed upon in order\r\nto prevent Bouthemont from selling at too small a profit for the sole\r\npurpose of increasing the sales. Moreover, all his former anxiety\r\nreappeared in the presence of these advertising combinations which\r\nhe did not understand, and he ventured to display his repugnance by\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n"If we sell it at five francs twelve sous, it will be like selling it\r\nat a loss, as we must allow for our expenses, which are considerable.\r\nIt would fetch seven francs anywhere."\r\n\r\nAt this Mouret got angry. Striking the silk with his open hand he\r\nexclaimed excitedly: "I know that, that\'s why I want to give it to our\r\ncustomers. Really, my dear fellow, you\'ll never understand women\'s\r\nways. Don\'t you see that they\'ll fight together over this silk?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt," interrupted the other, obstinately, "and the more they buy,\r\nthe more we shall lose."\r\n\r\n"We shall lose a few sous on the stuff, very likely. But what can that\r\nmatter, if in return we attract all the women here, and keep them at\r\nour mercy, fascinated, maddened by the sight of our goods, emptying\r\ntheir purses without thinking? The principal thing, my dear fellow, is\r\nto inflame them, and for that purpose you must have an article which\r\nwill flatter them and cause a sensation. Afterwards, you can sell the\r\nother articles as dear as they are sold anywhere else, they\'ll still\r\nthink yours the cheapest. For instance, our Golden Grain, that taffetas\r\nat seven francs and a half, sold everywhere at the same price, will go\r\ndown as an extraordinary bargain, and suffice to make up for the loss\r\non the Paris Delight. You\'ll see, you\'ll see!"\r\n\r\nHe was becoming quite eloquent. "Don\'t you understand?" he resumed,\r\n"In a week\'s time from to-day I want the Paris Delight to effect a\r\nrevolution in the market. It\'s our master-stroke, which will save us\r\nand send our name everything. Nothing else will be talked of; that blue\r\nand silver selvage will be known from one to the other end of France.\r\nAnd you\'ll hear the furious complaints of our competitors. The small\r\ntraders will lose another wing by it. Yes, we shall have done for all\r\nthose slop-sellers who are dying of rheumatism in their cellars!"\r\n\r\nThe shopmen checking the goods round-about were listening and smiling.\r\nMouret liked to talk in this way without contradiction. Bourdoncle\r\nyielded once more. However, the case of silk was now empty and two men\r\nwere opening another.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the manufacturers who are vexed," now said Bouthemont. "At Lyons\r\nthey are all furious with you, they pretend that your cheap trading is\r\nruining them. You are aware that Gaujean has positively declared war\r\nagainst me. Yes, he has sworn to give long credits to the little houses\r\nrather than accept my prices."\r\n\r\nMouret shrugged his shoulders. "If Gaujean doesn\'t behave sensibly," he\r\nreplied, "Gaujean will be floored. What do they all complain of? We pay\r\nready money and we take all they can make; it\'s strange if they can\'t\r\nwork cheaper at that rate. Besides, the public gets the benefit, and\r\nthat\'s everything."\r\n\r\nThe shopman now began emptying the second case, whilst Bouthemont\r\nchecked the pieces by the invoice. Another employee at the end of\r\nthe counter then marked them in plain figures, and the checking\r\nfinished, the invoice, signed by the manager, had to be sent to the\r\nchief cashier\'s office. For another minute Mouret continued looking\r\nat the work, at all the activity around this unpacking of goods which\r\nthreatened to drown the basement; then, never adding a word but with\r\nthe air of a captain satisfied with his men, he went off, again\r\nfollowed by Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\nThey slowly crossed the basement floor. The air-holes placed at\r\nintervals admitted a pale light; while in the dark corners, and\r\nalong the narrow corridors, gas was constantly burning. In these\r\ncorridors were the reserves, large vaults closed with iron railings,\r\ncontaining the surplus goods of each department. As he passed along\r\nMouret glanced at the heating apparatus which was to be lighted\r\non the following Monday for the first time, and at the firemen\r\nguarding a giant gas-meter enclosed in an iron cage. The kitchen and\r\ndining-rooms, old cellars turned into habitable apartments, were on\r\nthe left near the corner of the Place Gaillon. At last, right at\r\nthe other end of the basement, he arrived at the delivery office.\r\nHere, all the purchases which customers did not take away with them,\r\nwere sent down, sorted on tables, and placed in compartments each of\r\nwhich represented a particular district of Paris; then by a large\r\nstaircase opening just opposite The Old Elbeuf, they were sent up to\r\nthe vans standing alongside the pavement. In the mechanical working\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise, this staircase in the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re\r\nwas ever disgorging the goods devoured by the slide in the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin, after they had passed through the mill of the\r\ncounters up above.\r\n\r\n"Campion," said Mouret to the delivery manager, a retired sergeant\r\nwith a thin face, "why weren\'t six pairs of sheets, bought by a lady\r\nyesterday about two o\'clock, delivered in the evening?"\r\n\r\n"Where does the lady live?" asked the employee.\r\n\r\n"In the Rue de Rivoli, at the corner of the Rue d\'Alger--Madame\r\nDesforges."\r\n\r\nAt this early hour the sorting tables were yet bare and the\r\ncompartments only contained a few parcels left over night. Whilst\r\nCampion was searching amongst these packets, after consulting a list,\r\nBourdoncle looked at Mouret, reflecting that this wonderful fellow knew\r\neverything, thought of everything, even when he was supposed to be\r\namusing himself. At last Campion discovered the error; the cashiers\'\r\ndepartment had given a wrong number, and the parcel had come back.\r\n\r\n"What is the number of the pay-desk that debited the order?" asked\r\nMouret: "No. 10, you say?" And turning towards his lieutenant, he\r\nadded: "No. 10; that\'s Albert, isn\'t it? We\'ll just say two words to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nHowever, before starting on a tour round the shops, he wanted to go up\r\nto the postal order department, which occupied several rooms on the\r\nsecond floor. It was there that all the provincial and foreign orders\r\narrived; and he went up every morning to see the correspondence. For\r\ntwo years this correspondence had been increasing daily. At first\r\noccupying only a dozen clerks, it now required more than thirty. Some\r\nopened the letters and others read them, seated on either side of the\r\nsame table; others again classified them, giving each one a running\r\nnumber, which was repeated on a pigeon-hole. Then when the letters\r\nhad been distributed to the different departments and the latter had\r\ndelivered the articles ordered, these articles were placed in the\r\npigeon-holes as they arrived, in accordance with running numbers.\r\nNothing then remained but to check and pack them, which was done in a\r\nneighbouring room by a squad of workmen who were nailing and tying up\r\nfrom morning to night.\r\n\r\nMouret put his usual question: "How many letters this morning,\r\nLevasseur?"\r\n\r\n"Five hundred and thirty-four, sir," replied the chief clerk. "After\r\nthe new sale has begun on Monday, I\'m afraid we sha\'n\'t have enough\r\nhands. Yesterday we were driven very hard."\r\n\r\nBourdoncle expressed his satisfaction by a nod of the head. He had not\r\nreckoned on five hundred and thirty-four letters arriving on a Tuesday.\r\nRound the table, the clerks continued opening and reading the letters,\r\nthe paper rustling all the time, whilst before the pigeon-holes the\r\nvarious articles ordered began to arrive. This was one of the most\r\ncomplicated and important departments of the establishment, and the\r\nrush was continual, for, strictly speaking, all the orders received in\r\nthe morning ought to be sent off the same evening.\r\n\r\n"You shall have whatever more hands you want," replied Mouret, who had\r\nseen at a glance that the work of the department was well done. "When\r\nthere\'s work," he added, "we never refuse the men."\r\n\r\nUp above, under the roof, were the bedrooms occupied by the saleswomen.\r\nHowever, Mouret went downstairs again and entered the chief cash\r\noffice, which was near his own. It was a room with a glazed partition\r\nin which was a metal-work wicket, and it contained an enormous safe,\r\nfixed in the wall. Two cashiers here centralised the receipts which\r\nLhomme, the chief cashier of the sales\' service, brought in every\r\nevening; and with these receipts they discharged the current expenses,\r\npaid the manufacturers, the staff, all the people indeed who lived\r\nby the house. Their office communicated with another, full of green\r\ncardboard boxes, where some ten clerks checked the innumerable\r\ninvoices. Then came yet a third office, the clearing-house, so to say,\r\nwhere six young men bending over black desks, with quite a collection\r\nof registers behind them, made up the commission accounts of the\r\nsalesmen, by checking the debit notes. This department but recently\r\norganized did not as yet work particularly well.\r\n\r\nMouret and Bourdoncle crossed the cashier\'s office and the invoice\r\nroom and when they passed into the third office the young men there,\r\nwho were laughing and joking together, started with surprise. Mouret,\r\nwithout reprimanding them, thereupon explained his scheme of giving\r\nthem a little bonus for each error they might detect in the debit\r\nnotes; and when he went out the clerks, quite cured of all inclination\r\nfor idle laughter, set to work in earnest, hunting for errors.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the ground-floor, occupied by the shops, Mouret went\r\nstraight to pay-desk No. 10, where Albert Lhomme was polishing his\r\nnails, pending the arrival of customers. People currently spoke of\r\n"the Lhomme dynasty," since Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, first-hand in the mantle\r\ndepartment, after helping her husband to secure the post of chief\r\ncashier, had further managed to get a pay desk for her son, a tall,\r\npale, vicious young man who had been unable to remain in any situation,\r\nand had caused her an immense deal of anxiety. On reaching his desk,\r\nMouret, who never cared to render himself unpopular by performing\r\npolice duty, and from policy and taste preferred to play the part of a\r\nbenign Providence, retired into the back ground, after gently nudging\r\nBourdoncle with his elbow. It was Bourdoncle, the infallible and\r\nimpeccable, whom he generally charged with the duty of reprimanding.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Albert," said Bourdoncle, severely, "you have again taken an\r\naddress wrong; the parcel has come back. It is unbearable!"\r\n\r\nThe cashier, thinking it advisable to defend himself, called as a\r\nwitness the assistant who had tied up the packet. This assistant, named\r\nJoseph, also belonged to the Lhomme dynasty, for he was Albert\'s foster\r\nbrother, and likewise owed his place to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s influence.\r\nAlbert sought to make him say that the mistake had been made by the\r\ncustomer herself, but all Joseph could do was to stutter and twist the\r\nshaggy beard that ornamented his scarred face, struggling the while\r\nbetween his conscience and his gratitude to his protectors.\r\n\r\n"Let Joseph alone," Bourdoncle exclaimed at last, "and don\'t say any\r\nmore. It\'s a lucky thing for you that we are mindful of your mother\'s\r\ngood services!"\r\n\r\nHowever, at this moment Lhomme senior came running up. From his office\r\nnear the door he could see his son\'s pay-desk, which was in the\r\nglove department, and doubtless the colloquy had alarmed him. Quite\r\nwhite-haired already, deadened by his sedentary life, he had a flabby,\r\ncolourless face, blanched and worn, as it were, by the reflection of\r\nthe money he was continually handling. The circumstance that he had\r\nlost an arm did not at all incommode him in this work, and indeed\r\npeople would go to his office out of curiosity to see him verify\r\nthe receipts, so rapidly did the notes and coins slip through his\r\nleft hand, the only one remaining to him. The son of a tax-collector\r\nat Chablis, he had come to Paris as clerk to a merchant of the\r\nPort-aux-Vins. Then, whilst lodging in the Rue Cuvier, he had married\r\nthe daughter of his doorkeeper, a petty Alsatian tailor, and from that\r\nday onward he had bowed submissively before his wife, whose commercial\r\nability filled him with respect. She now earned more than twelve\r\nthousand francs a year in the mantle department, whilst he only drew\r\na fixed salary of five thousand francs. And the deference he felt for\r\nthis wife who brought such large sums into the household was extended\r\nto their son, whom he also owed to her.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" he murmured; "is Albert in fault?"\r\n\r\nThen, according to his custom, Mouret reappeared on the scene, to play\r\nthe part of an indulgent prince. When Bourdoncle had made himself\r\nfeared, he looked after his own popularity.\r\n\r\n"Oh! nothing of consequence!" he answered. "My dear Lhomme, your son\r\nAlbert is a careless fellow, who should take an example from you."\r\nThen, changing the subject, showing himself more amiable than ever, he\r\ncontinued: "And by the way, how about that concert the other day--did\r\nyou get a good seat?"\r\n\r\nA blush spread over the white cheeks of the old cashier. Music was his\r\nonly vice, a secret vice which he indulged in solitarily, frequenting\r\ntheatres, concerts and recitals. Moreover, despite the loss of his arm,\r\nhe played on the French horn, thanks to an ingenious system of claws;\r\nand as Madame Lhomme detested noise, before playing his instrument of\r\nan evening he would wrap it in cloth, and then draw from it all sorts\r\nof weird muffled sounds which delighted him to the point of ecstasy.\r\nIn the forced irregularity of their domestic life he had made himself\r\nan oasis of his passion for music--that, his cash receipts and his\r\nadmiration for his wife, summed up his whole existence.\r\n\r\n"A very good seat," he replied with sparkling eyes. "You are really too\r\nkind, sir."\r\n\r\nMouret, who took a personal pleasure in satisfying other people\'s\r\npassions, sometimes gave Lhomme the tickets forced upon him by lady\r\npatronesses and he put the finishing touch to the old man\'s delight\r\nby remarking: "Ah, Beethoven! ah, Mozart! What music!" Then, without\r\nwaiting for a reply, he went off, rejoining Bourdoncle, who had already\r\nstarted on his tour of inspection through the departments.\r\n\r\nIn the central hall--an inner courtyard with a glass roof--was the\r\nsilk department. At first Mouret and his companion turned into the\r\nRue-Saint-Augustin gallery occupied by the linen department, from one\r\nend to the other. Nothing unusual striking them, they passed on slowly\r\nthrough the crowd of respectful assistants. Next they turned into the\r\ncotton and hosiery departments, where the same good order reigned. But\r\nin the department devoted to woollens, occupying the gallery which\r\nran towards the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, Bourdoncle resumed the part of\r\nexecutioner, on observing a young man seated on the counter, looking\r\nquite knocked up by a sleepless night; and this young man, a certain\r\nLi\xc3\xa9nard, son of a rich Angers draper, bowed his head beneath the\r\nreprimand, for in the idle, careless life of pleasure which he led his\r\none great fear was that he might be recalled from Paris by his father.\r\nAnd now reprimands began to shower down on all sides like hail, and\r\nquite a storm burst in the gallery of the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re. In the\r\ndrapery department a salesman, a fresh hand, who slept in the house,\r\nhad come in after eleven o\'clock and in the haberdashery department,\r\nthe second counterman had allowed himself to be caught smoking a\r\ncigarette downstairs. But the tempest attained its greatest violence\r\nin the glove department, where it fell upon one of the few Parisians\r\nin the house, handsome Mignot, as he was called, the illegitimate son\r\nof a music-mistress. His crime was that of causing a scandal in the\r\ndining-room by complaining of the food. As there were three tables,\r\none at half-past nine, one at half-past ten, and another at half-past\r\neleven, he wished to explain that, belonging as he did to the third\r\ntable, he always had the leavings, the worst of everything for his\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n"What! the food not good?" asked Mouret, with a naive air, opening his\r\nmouth at last.\r\n\r\nHe only allowed the chief cook, a terrible Auvergnat, a franc and a\r\nhalf a head per day, out of which small sum this man still contrived\r\nto make a good profit; and indeed the food was really execrable.\r\nBut Bourdoncle shrugged his shoulders: a cook who had four hundred\r\nluncheons and four hundred dinners to serve, even in three series, had\r\nno time to waste on the refinements of his art.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said the governor, good-naturedly, "I wish all our\r\nemployees to have good and abundant food. I\'ll speak to the cook." And\r\nthus Mignot\'s complaint was shelved.\r\n\r\nThen returning to their point of departure, standing near the door,\r\namidst the umbrellas and neckties, Mouret and Bourdoncle received the\r\nreport of one of the four inspectors, who were charged with the police\r\nservice of the establishment. The inspector in question, old Jouve, a\r\nretired captain, decorated for his bravery at Constantine and still a\r\nfine-looking man with his big sensual nose and majestic baldness, drew\r\ntheir attention to a salesman, who, in reply to a simple remonstrance\r\non his part, had called him "an old humbug," and the salesman was\r\nimmediately discharged.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the shop was still without customers, that is, except a few\r\nhousewives of the neighbourhood who were passing through the almost\r\ndeserted galleries. At the door the time-keeper had just closed his\r\nbook, and was making out a separate list of the late arrivals. The\r\nsalesmen on their side were taking possession of their departments,\r\nwhich had been swept and brushed by the assistants before their\r\narrival. Each young man put away his hat and over-coat as he arrived,\r\nstifling a yawn, still half asleep as he did so. Some exchanged a few\r\nwords, gazed about the shop and sought to pull themselves together for\r\nanother day\'s work; while others leisurely removed the green baize\r\nwith which they had covered the goods over night, after folding them\r\nup. Then the piles of stuffs appeared symmetrically arranged, and the\r\nwhole shop looked clean and orderly, brilliant in the gay morning light\r\npending the rush of business which would once more obstruct it, and, as\r\nit were, reduce its dimensions by the unpacking and display of linen,\r\ncloth, silk, and lace.\r\n\r\nIn the bright light of the central hall, two young men were talking in\r\na low voice at the silk counter. One of them, short but well set and\r\ngood looking, with a pinky skin, was endeavouring to blend the colours\r\nof some silks for an indoor show. His name was Hutin, his father kept\r\na caf\xc3\xa9 at Yvetot, and after eighteen months\' service he had managed to\r\nbecome one of the principal salesmen, thanks to a natural flexibility\r\nof character and a continual flow of caressing flattery, under which\r\nwere concealed furious appetites which prompted him to grasp at\r\neverything and devour everybody just for the pleasure of the thing.\r\n\r\n"Well, Favier, I should have struck him if I had been in your place,\r\nhonour bright!" said he to his companion, a tall bilious fellow with a\r\ndry yellow skin, who had been born at Besan\xc3\xa7on of a family of weavers,\r\nand concealed under a cold graceless exterior a disquieting force of\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n"It does no good to strike people," he murmured, phlegmatically;\r\n"better wait."\r\n\r\nThey were both speaking of Robineau, the "second" in the department,\r\nwho was looking after the shopmen during the manager\'s absence in\r\nthe basement. Hutin was secretly undermining Robineau, whose place\r\nhe coveted. To wound him and induce him to leave, he had already\r\nintroduced Bouthemont to fill the post of manager which had been\r\npreviously promised to Robineau. However, the latter stood firm,\r\nand it was now an hourly battle. Hutin dreamed of setting the whole\r\ndepartment against him, of hounding him out by dint of ill-will and\r\nvexation. Still he went to work craftily, ever preserving his amiable\r\nair. And it was especially Favier whom he strove to excite against\r\nthe "second"--Favier, who stood next to himself as salesman, and who\r\nappeared willing to be led, though he had certain brusque fits of\r\nreserve by which one could divine that he was bent on some private\r\ncampaign of his own.\r\n\r\n"Hush! seventeen!" he all at once hastily remarked to his colleague,\r\nintending by this peculiar exclamation to warn him of the approach of\r\nMouret and Bourdoncle. These two, still continuing their inspection,\r\nwere now traversing the hall and stopped to ask Robineau for an\r\nexplanation respecting a stock of velvets, the boxes of which were\r\nencumbering a table. And as Robineau replied that there wasn\'t enough\r\nroom to store things away, Mouret exclaimed with a smile:\r\n\r\n"Ah! I told you so, Bourdoncle, the place is already too small. We\r\nshall soon have to knock down the walls as far as the Rue de Choiseul.\r\nYou\'ll see what a crush there\'ll be next Monday."\r\n\r\nThen, respecting the coming sale, for which they were preparing at\r\nevery counter, he asked further questions of Robineau and gave him\r\nvarious orders. For some minutes however, whilst still talking, he had\r\nbeen watching Hutin, who was slowly arranging his silks--placing blue,\r\ngrey, and yellow side by side and then stepping back to judge of the\r\nharmony of the tints. And all at once Mouret interfered: "But why are\r\nyou endeavouring to please the eye?" he asked. "Don\'t be afraid; blind\r\nthe customers! This is the style. Look! red, green, yellow."\r\n\r\nWhile speaking he had taken up some of the pieces of silk, throwing\r\nthem together, crumpling them and producing an extremely violent effect\r\nof colour. Every one allowed the governor to be the best "dresser" in\r\nParis albeit one of a revolutionary stamp, an initiator of the brutal\r\nand the colossal in the science of display. His fancy was a tumbling\r\nof stuffs, heaped pell-mell as if they had fallen by chance from the\r\nbursting boxes, and glowing with the most ardent contrasting colours,\r\nwhich heightened each other\'s intensity. The customers, said he, ought\r\nto feel their eyes aching by the time they left the shop. Hutin, who on\r\nthe contrary belonged to the classic school whose guiding principles\r\nwere symmetry and a melodious blending of shades, watched him lighting\r\nthis conflagration of silk on the table, without venturing to say a\r\nword; but on his lips appeared the pout of an artist whose convictions\r\nwere sorely hurt by such a debauch of colour.\r\n\r\n"There!" exclaimed Mouret, when he had finished.\r\n\r\n"Leave it as it is; you\'ll see if it doesn\'t fetch the women on Monday."\r\n\r\nJust then, as he rejoined Bourdoncle and Robineau, there arrived a\r\nwoman, who stopped short, breathless at sight of this show. It was\r\nDenise, who, after waiting for nearly an hour in the street, a prey to\r\na violent attack of timidity, had at last decided to enter. But she\r\nwas so beside herself with bashfulness that she mistook the clearest\r\ndirections; and the shopmen, of whom in stammering accents she asked\r\nfor Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, in vain directed her to the staircase conducting\r\nto the first floor; she thanked them, but turned to the left if they\r\ntold her to turn to the right; so that for the last ten minutes she\r\nhad been wandering about the ground-floor, going from department to\r\ndepartment, amidst the ill-natured curiosity and boorish indifference\r\nof the salesmen. She longed to run away, but was at the same time\r\nretained by a wish to stop and admire. She felt herself lost, so little\r\nin this monstrous place, this machine which was still at rest, and\r\ntrembled with fear lest she should be caught in the movement with which\r\nthe walls already began to quiver. And in her mind the thought of The\r\nOld Elbeuf, so black and narrow, increased the immensity of this vast\r\nestablishment, which seemed bathed in a golden light and similar to\r\na city with its monuments, squares, and streets, in which it seemed\r\nimpossible she should ever find her way.\r\n\r\nHowever, she had previously not dared to venture into the silk hall\r\nwhose high glass roof, luxurious counters, and cathedral-like aspect\r\nfrightened her. Then when she did venture in, to escape the shopmen of\r\nthe linen department, who were grinning at her, she stumbled right on\r\nMouret\'s display; and, despite her bewilderment, the woman was aroused\r\nwithin her, her cheeks suddenly flushed, and she forgot everything in\r\nlooking at the glow of this conflagration of silk.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said Hutin in Favier\'s ear; "there\'s the drab we saw on the\r\nPlace Gaillon."\r\n\r\nMouret, whilst affecting to listen to Bourdoncle and Robineau, was\r\nat heart flattered by the startled look of this poor girl, just as a\r\nmarchioness might be by the brutal admiration of a passing drayman. But\r\nDenise had raised her eyes, and her confusion increased at the sight\r\nof this young man, whom she took for the manager of a department. She\r\nthought he was looking at her severely. Then not knowing how to get\r\naway, quite lost, she once more applied to the nearest shopman, who\r\nhappened to be Favier.\r\n\r\n"Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, if you please?"\r\n\r\nHowever Favier, who was disagreeable, contented himself with replying\r\nsharply: "On the first floor."\r\n\r\nThen, Denise, longing to escape the looks of all these men, thanked\r\nhim, and was again turning her back to the stairs she ought to have\r\nascended when Hutin, yielding naturally to his instinctive gallantry,\r\nstopped her with his most amiable salesman\'s smile albeit he had just\r\nspoken of her as a drab.\r\n\r\n"No--this way, mademoiselle, if you please," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd he even went with her a little way, as far indeed as the foot of\r\nthe staircase on the left-hand side of the hall. There he bowed, and\r\nsmiled at her, as he smiled at all women.\r\n\r\n"When you get upstairs turn to the left," he added. "The mantle\r\ndepartment will then be in front of you."\r\n\r\nThis caressing politeness affected Denise deeply. It was like a\r\nbrotherly hand extended to her; she raised her eyes and looked at\r\nHutin, and everything in him touched her--his handsome face, his\r\nsmiling look which dissolved her fears, and his voice which seemed to\r\nher of a consoling softness. Her heart swelled with gratitude, and she\r\ngave him her friendship in the few disjointed words which her emotion\r\nallowed her to utter.\r\n\r\n"Really, sir, you are too kind. Pray don\'t trouble to come any further.\r\nThank you very much."\r\n\r\nHutin was already rejoining Favier, to whom he coarsely whispered:\r\n"What a bag of bones--eh?"\r\n\r\nUpstairs the young girl suddenly found herself in the midst of the\r\nmantle department. It was a vast room, with high carved oak cupboards\r\nall round it and clear glass windows overlooking the Rue de la\r\nMichodi\xc3\xa8re. Five or six women in silk dresses, looking very coquettish\r\nwith their frizzy chignons and crinolines drawn back, were moving\r\nabout and talking. One of them, tall and thin, with a long head, and\r\na run-away-horse appearance, was leaning against a cupboard, as if\r\nalready knocked up with fatigue.\r\n\r\n"Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie?" inquired Denise.\r\n\r\nThe saleswoman did not reply but looked at her, with an air of disdain\r\nfor her shabby dress; then turning to one of her companions, a short\r\ngirl with a sickly white skin and an innocent and disgusted expression\r\nof countenance, she asked: "Mademoiselle Vadon, do you know where\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie is?"\r\n\r\nThe girl, who was arranging some mantles according to their sizes,\r\ndid not even take the trouble to raise her head. "No, Mademoiselle\r\nPrunaire, I don\'t know at all," she replied in a mincing tone.\r\n\r\nSilence fell. Denise stood still, and no one took any further notice\r\nof her. However, after waiting a moment, she ventured to put another\r\nquestion: "Do you think Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie will be back soon?"\r\n\r\nThereupon, the second-hand, a thin, ugly woman, whom she had not\r\nnoticed before, a widow with a projecting jaw-bone and coarse hair,\r\ncried out from a cupboard, board, where she was checking some tickets:\r\n"You\'d better wait if you want to speak to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie herself."\r\nAnd, addressing another saleswoman, she added: "Isn\'t she downstairs?"\r\n\r\n"No, Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric, I don\'t think so," was the reply. "She said\r\nnothing before going, so she can\'t be far off."\r\n\r\nDenise, thus meagrely informed, remained standing. There were several\r\nchairs for the customers; but as she had not been asked to sit down,\r\nshe did not dare to take one although her perturbation well nigh\r\ndeprived her legs of strength. All these young ladies had evidently\r\nguessed that she was an applicant for the vacancy, and were taking\r\nstock of her, ill-naturedly pulling her to pieces with the secret\r\nhostility of people at table who do not like to close up to make room\r\nfor hungry outsiders. Then Denise\'s confusion increasing, she slowly\r\ncrossed the room and looked out of the window into the street, for the\r\npurpose of keeping countenance. Over the way, The Old Elbeuf, with\r\nits rusty front and lifeless windows, appeared to her so ugly and so\r\nwretched, thus viewed from amidst the luxury and life of her present\r\nstandpoint, that a sort of remorse filled her already swollen heart\r\nwith grief.\r\n\r\n"I say," whispered tall Mdlle. Prunaire to little Mdlle. Vadon, "have\r\nyou seen her boots?"\r\n\r\n"And her dress!" murmured the other.\r\n\r\nWith her eyes still turned towards the street, Denise divined that\r\nshe was being devoured. But she was not angry; she did not think\r\nthem handsome, neither the tall one with her carroty chignon falling\r\nover her horse-like neck, nor the little one with her curdled-milk\r\ncomplexion, which gave her flat and, as it were, boneless face a flabby\r\nappearance. Clara Prunaire, daughter of a clogmaker of the woods of\r\nVivet had begun to misconduct herself at the time when she was employed\r\nas needlewoman at the Ch\xc3\xa2teau de Mareuil. Later on she had come to\r\nParis from a shop at Langres, and was avenging herself in the capital\r\nfor all the kicks with which her father had regaled her when at home.\r\nOn the other hand Marguerite Vadon, born at Grenoble, where her parents\r\nkept a linen shop, had been obliged to come to Paris, where she had\r\nentered The Ladies\' Paradise, in order to conceal a misfortune due to\r\nher frailty. Since then, however, she had ever been a well-conducted\r\ngirl, and intended to return to Grenoble to take charge of her parents\'\r\nshop, and marry a cousin who was waiting for her.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well," resumed Clara, in a low voice, "that girl won\'t be of much\r\naccount here even if she does get in."\r\n\r\nBut they all at once stopped talking, for a woman of about forty-five\r\nwas coming in. It was Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, very stout and tightly laced in\r\nher black silk dress, the body of which, strained over her massive\r\nshoulders and full bust, shone like a piece of armour. Under dark folds\r\nof hair, she had big fixed eyes, a severe mouth, and broad and rather\r\ndrooping cheeks; and in the majesty of her position as manageress her\r\nface seemed to swell with pride like the puffy countenance of a C\xc3\xa6sar.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Vadon," said she, in an irritated voice, "you didn\'t\r\nreturn the pattern of that mantle to the workroom yesterday, it seems?"\r\n\r\n"There was an alteration to be made, madame," replied the saleswoman,\r\n"so Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric kept it."\r\n\r\nThe second-hand thereupon took the pattern out of a cupboard, and the\r\nexplanation continued. Every one gave way to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, when she\r\nthought it expedient to assert her authority. Very vain, even to the\r\npoint of objecting to be called by her husband\'s name, Lhomme, which\r\nannoyed her, and of denying the humble position of her father to whom\r\nshe always referred as a regularly established tailor, she only proved\r\ngracious towards those young ladies who showed themselves flexible and\r\ncaressing and bowed down in admiration before her. Formerly, whilst\r\ntrying to establish herself in a shop of her own, her temper had been\r\nsoured by continual bad luck; the feeling that she was born to fortune\r\nand encountered nothing but a series of catastrophes had exasperated\r\nher; and now, even after her success at The Ladies\' Paradise, where\r\nshe earned twelve thousand francs a year, it seemed as if she still\r\nnourished a secret spite against every one. She was in particular very\r\nhard with beginners, even as life had shown itself hard for her at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"That will do!" said she, sharply; "You are not more reasonable than\r\nthe others, Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric. Let the alteration be made immediately."\r\n\r\nDuring this explanation, Denise had ceased looking into the street.\r\nShe had no doubt this was Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie; but, frightened by her sharp\r\nvoice, she remained standing, still waiting. The two saleswomen,\r\ndelighted to have set their two superiors at variance, had returned to\r\ntheir work with an air of profound indifference. A few minutes elapsed,\r\nnobody being charitable enough to extricate the young girl from her\r\nuncomfortable position. At last, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie herself perceived her,\r\nand astonished to see her standing there motionless inquired what she\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, please."\r\n\r\n"I am Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie."\r\n\r\nDenise\'s mouth was dry and parched, her hands were cold; she felt\r\nsome such fear as when she was a child and trembled at the thought of\r\nbeing whipped. At last she stammered out her request, but was obliged\r\nto repeat it to make herself understood. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie gazed upon\r\nher with her large fixed eyes, not a line of her imperial countenance\r\ndeigning to relax.\r\n\r\n"How old are you?" she eventually inquired.\r\n\r\n"Twenty, madame."\r\n\r\n"What, twenty years old? you don\'t look sixteen!"\r\n\r\nThe saleswomen again raised their heads. Denise hastened to add: "Oh,\r\nI\'m very strong!"\r\n\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie shrugged her broad shoulders and then coldly remarked:\r\n"Well! I don\'t mind entering your name. We enter the names of all who\r\napply. Mademoiselle Prunaire, give me the book."\r\n\r\nBut the book could not be found; Jouve, the inspector, had probably got\r\nit. And just as tall Clara was about to fetch it, Mouret arrived, still\r\nfollowed by Bourdoncle. They had made the tour of the other departments\r\non the first floor--they had passed through the lace, the shawls, the\r\nfurs, the furniture and the under-linen, and were now winding up with\r\nthe mantles. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie left Denise for a moment to speak to them\r\nabout an order for some cloaks which she thought of giving to one of\r\nthe large Paris houses. As a rule, she bought direct, and on her own\r\nresponsibility; but, for important purchases, she preferred to consult\r\nthe chiefs of the house. Bourdoncle then told her of her son Albert\'s\r\nlatest act of carelessness, which seemed to fill her with despair.\r\nThat boy would kill her; his father, although not a man of talent, was\r\nat least well-conducted, careful, and honest. All this dynasty of the\r\nLhommes, of which she was the acknowledged head, very often caused her\r\na great deal of trouble. However, Mouret, surprised to come upon Denise\r\nagain, bent down to ask Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie what that young person was doing\r\nthere; and, when the first-hand replied that she was applying for a\r\nsaleswoman\'s situation, Bourdoncle, with his disdain for women, seemed\r\nsuffocated by such pretension.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean it," he murmured; "it must be a joke, she\'s too ugly!"\r\n\r\n"The fact is, there\'s nothing handsome about her," replied Mouret, not\r\ndaring to defend her, although he was still moved by the rapture she\r\nhad displayed downstairs before his arrangement of the silks.\r\n\r\nHowever, the book having been brought, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie returned to\r\nDenise, who had certainly not made a favourable impression. She looked\r\nvery clean in her thin black woollen dress; still the question of\r\nshabbiness was of no importance, as the house furnished a uniform,\r\nthe regulation silk dress; but she appeared weak and puny, and had a\r\nmelancholy face. Without insisting on handsome girls, the managers\r\nof the house liked their assistants to be of agreeable appearance.\r\nAnd beneath the gaze of all the men and women who were studying her,\r\nestimating her like farmers would a horse at a fair, Denise lost what\r\nlittle countenance had still remained to her.\r\n\r\n"Your name?" asked Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, standing at the end of a counter,\r\npen in hand, ready to write.\r\n\r\n"Denise Baudu, madame."\r\n\r\n"Your age?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty years and four months." And risking a glance at Mouret, at this\r\nsupposed manager, whom she met everywhere and whose presence troubled\r\nher so much, she repeated: "I don\'t look like it, but I am really very\r\nstrong."\r\n\r\nThey smiled. Bourdoncle showed evident signs of impatience; her remark\r\nfell, moreover, amidst a most discouraging silence.\r\n\r\n"What establishment have you been at, in Paris?" resumed Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just arrived from Valognes, madame."\r\n\r\nThis was a fresh disaster. As a rule, The Ladies\' Paradise only engaged\r\nas saleswomen such girls as had had a year\'s experience in one of the\r\nsmall houses in Paris. Denise thought all was lost; and, had it not\r\nbeen for the children, had she not been obliged to work for them, she\r\nwould have brought this futile interrogatory to an end by leaving the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n"Where were you at Valognes?" asked Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie.\r\n\r\n"At Cornaille\'s."\r\n\r\n"I know him--good house," remarked Mouret.\r\n\r\nIt was very seldom that he interfered in the engagement of the\r\nemployees, the manager of each department being responsible for his\r\nor her staff. But with his fine appreciation of women, he divined in\r\nthis girl a hidden charm, a wealth of grace and tenderness of which she\r\nherself was ignorant. The good reputation of the establishment in which\r\nthe candidate had started was of great importance, often deciding the\r\nquestion in his or her favour. Thus even Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie continued in a\r\nkinder tone: "And why did you leave Cornaille\'s?"\r\n\r\n"For family reasons," replied Denise, turning scarlet. "We have lost\r\nour parents, I have been obliged to follow my brothers. Here is a\r\ncertificate."\r\n\r\nIt was excellent. Her hopes were reviving, when another question\r\ntroubled her.\r\n\r\n"Have you any other references in Paris? Where do you live?"\r\n\r\n"At my uncle\'s," she murmured, hesitating to name him for she feared\r\nthat they would never engage the niece of a competitor. "At my uncle\r\nBaudu\'s, opposite."\r\n\r\nAt this, Mouret interfered a second time. "What! are you Baudu\'s\r\nniece?" said he, "is it Baudu who sent you here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, sir!" answered Denise; and she could not help laughing as she\r\nspoke for the idea appeared to her so singular. That laugh was like a\r\ntransfiguration; she became quite rosy, and the smile playing round her\r\nrather large mouth lighted up her whole face. Her grey eyes sparkled\r\nwith a soft flame, her cheeks filled with delicious dimples, and even\r\nher light hair seemed to partake of the frank and courageous gaiety\r\nthat pervaded her whole being.\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s really pretty," whispered Mouret to Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\nThe latter with a gesture of boredom refused to admit it. Clara on her\r\nside bit her lips, and Marguerite turned away; Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie alone\r\nseemed won over, and encouraged Mouret with a nod when he resumed:\r\n"Your uncle was wrong not to bring you here; his recommendation\r\nsufficed. It is said he has a grudge against us. We are people of\r\nmore liberal minds, and if he can\'t find employment for his niece in\r\nhis house, why we will show him that she has only had to knock at our\r\ndoor to be received. Just tell him I still like him very much, and\r\nthat if he has cause for complaint he must blame, not me, but the new\r\ncircumstances of commerce. Tell him, too, that he will ruin himself if\r\nhe insists on keeping to his ridiculous old-fashioned ways."\r\n\r\nDenise turned quite white again. It was Mouret; no one had mentioned\r\nhis name, but he revealed himself, and she guessed who he was, and\r\nunderstood why the sight of him had caused her such emotion in the\r\nstreet, in the silk department, and again here. This emotion, which\r\nshe could not analyze, pressed more and more upon her heart like an\r\nunbearable weight. All the stories related by her uncle came back to\r\nher, increasing Mouret\'s importance in her eyes, surrounding him with\r\na sort of halo in his capacity as the master of the terrible machine\r\nbetween whose wheels she had felt herself all the morning. And, behind\r\nhis handsome face, with its well-trimmed beard, and eyes the colour of\r\nold gold, she beheld the dead woman, that Madame H\xc3\xa9douin, whose blood\r\nhad helped to cement the stones of the house. The shiver she had felt\r\nthe previous night again came upon her; and she thought she was merely\r\nafraid of him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie had closed the book. She only wanted one\r\nsaleswoman, and she already had ten applications. True, she was too\r\nanxious to please the governor to hesitate for a moment, still the\r\napplication would follow its course, inspector Jouve would go and make\r\ninquiries, send in his report, and then she would come to a decision.\r\n\r\n"Very good, mademoiselle," said she majestically, as though to preserve\r\nher authority; "we will write to you."\r\n\r\nDenise stood there, unable to move for a moment, hardly knowing how to\r\ntake her leave in the midst of all these people. At last she thanked\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, and on passing Mouret and Bourdoncle, she bowed. The\r\ngentlemen, however, were examining the pattern of a mantle with Madame\r\nFr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric and took no further notice of her. Clara looked in a vexed way\r\ntowards Marguerite, as if to predict that the new-comer would not have\r\na very pleasant time of it in the establishment. Denise doubtless felt\r\nthis indifference and rancour behind her, for she went downstairs with\r\nthe same troubled feeling that had possessed her on going up, asking\r\nherself whether she ought to be sorry or glad at having come. Could she\r\ncount on having the situation? She doubted it, amidst the uneasiness\r\nwhich had prevented her from clearly understanding what had been said.\r\nOf her various sensations, two remained and gradually effaced all\r\nothers--the emotion, almost fear, with which Mouret had inspired her,\r\nand the pleasure she had derived from the amiability of Hutin, the only\r\npleasure she had enjoyed the whole morning, a souvenir of charming\r\nsweetness which filled her with gratitude. When she crossed the shop on\r\nher way out she looked for the young man, happy in the idea of thanking\r\nhim again with her eyes, and she was very sorry not to see him.\r\n\r\n"Well, mademoiselle, have you succeeded?" inquired a timid voice, as\r\nshe at last reached the pavement. She turned round and recognised the\r\ntall, awkward young fellow who had spoken to her in the morning. He\r\nalso had just come out of The Ladies\' Paradise, and seemed even more\r\nfrightened than herself, still bewildered by the examination through\r\nwhich he had just passed.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t know as yet, sir," she replied.\r\n\r\n"You\'re like me, then. What a way they have of looking at you and\r\ntalking to you in there--eh? I\'m applying for a place in the lace\r\ndepartment. I was at Crevec\xc5\x93ur\'s in the Rue du Mail."\r\n\r\nThey were once more standing face to face; and, not knowing how to take\r\nleave, they again began to blush. Then the young man, by way of saying\r\nsomething, timidly ventured to ask in his good-natured, awkward way:\r\n"What is your name, mademoiselle?"\r\n\r\n"Denise Baudu."\r\n\r\n"My name is Henri Deloche."\r\n\r\nThen they smiled, and, yielding to a fraternal feeling born of the\r\nsimilarity of their positions, shook each other by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Good luck!" said Deloche.\r\n\r\n"Yes, good luck!" was Denise\'s reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery Saturday, between four and six, Madame Desforges offered a cup\r\nof tea and a few sweet biscuits to those friends who were kind enough\r\nto visit her. She occupied the third floor of a house at the corner\r\nof the Rue de Rivoli and the Rue d\'Alger; and the windows of her two\r\ndrawing-rooms overlooked the gardens of the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThat Saturday, just as a footman was about to introduce him into the\r\nprincipal drawing-room, Mouret from the anteroom perceived, through\r\nan open doorway, Madame Desforges crossing the smaller salon. She\r\nstopped on seeing him, and he went in that way, bowing to her with a\r\nceremonious air. But when the footman had closed the door, he quickly\r\ncaught hold of the young woman\'s hand, and tenderly kissed it.\r\n\r\n"Take care, I have company!" she remarked, in a low voice, glancing\r\ntowards the door of the larger room. "I\'ve just come to fetch this fan\r\nto show them," and so saying she playfully tapped him on the face with\r\nthe tip of the fan she held. She was dark and inclined to stoutness,\r\nand had big jealous eyes.\r\n\r\nHowever, he still held her hand and inquired: "Will he come?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," she replied: "I have his promise."\r\n\r\nThey both referred to Baron Hartmann, the director of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier. Madame Desforges, daughter of a Councillor of State, was\r\nthe widow of a speculator, who had left her a fortune, underrated\r\nto the point of nothingness by some and greatly over-estimated by\r\nothers. During her husband\'s lifetime she had already known Baron\r\nHartmann, whose financial tips had proved very useful to them; and\r\nlater on, after her husband\'s death, the connection had been kept up\r\nin a discreet fashion; for she never courted notoriety in any way,\r\nand was received everywhere in the upper-middle class to which she\r\nbelonged. Even now too when she had other lovers--the passion of the\r\nbanker, a sceptical, crafty man, having subsided into a mere paternal\r\naffection--she displayed such delicate reserve and tact, such adroit\r\nknowledge of the world that appearances were saved, and no one would\r\nhave ventured to openly express any doubt of her conduct. Having met\r\nMouret at a mutual friend\'s she had at first detested him; but had\r\nbeen carried away by the violent love which he professed for her, and\r\nsince he had begun man\xc5\x93uvring to approach Baron Hartmann through her,\r\nshe had gradually got to love him with real and profound tenderness,\r\nadoring him with all the violence of a woman of thirty-five, who only\r\nacknowledged the age of twenty-nine, and distressed at feeling him\r\nyounger than herself, which made her tremble lest she should lose him.\r\n\r\n"Does he know about it?" he resumed.\r\n\r\n"No, you\'ll explain the affair to him yourself," was her reply.\r\n\r\nMeantime she looked at him, reflecting that he couldn\'t know anything\r\nor he would not employ her in this way with the baron, whom he appeared\r\nto consider simply as an old friend of hers. However, Mouret still held\r\nher hand and called her his good Henriette, at which she felt her heart\r\nmelting. Then silently she presented her lips, pressed them to his, and\r\nwhispered: "Remember they\'re waiting for me. Come in behind me."\r\n\r\nA murmur of voices, deadened by the heavy hangings, came from the\r\nprincipal drawing-room. Madame Desforges went in, leaving the folding\r\ndoors open behind her, and handed the fan to one of the four ladies who\r\nwere seated in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n"There it is," said she; "I didn\'t know exactly where it was. My maid\r\nwould never have found it." And turning round she added in her cheerful\r\nway: "Come in, Monsieur Mouret, come through the little drawing-room;\r\nit will be less solemn."\r\n\r\nMouret bowed to the ladies, whom he knew. The drawing-room, with its\r\nLouis XVI. furniture upholstered in flowered brocatel, its gilded\r\nbronzes and large green plants, had a pleasant, cozy, feminine aspect,\r\nalbeit the ceiling was so lofty; and through the two windows could be\r\nseen the chestnut trees of the Tuileries Gardens, whose leaves were\r\nblowing about in the October wind.\r\n\r\n"But this Chantilly isn\'t at all bad!" exclaimed Madam Bourdelais, who\r\nhad taken the fan.\r\n\r\nShe was a short fair woman of thirty, with a delicate nose and\r\nsparkling eyes. A former school-fellow of Henriette\'s, married to\r\na chief clerk at the Ministry of Finances, and belonging to an old\r\nmiddle-class family, she managed her household and three children with\r\nrare activity, good grace, and exquisite knowledge of practical life.\r\n\r\n"And you paid twenty-five francs for it?" she resumed, examining each\r\nmesh of the lace. "At Luc, I think you said, to a country-woman? No, it\r\nisn\'t dear; still you had to get it mounted, hadn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied Madame Desforges. "The mounting cost me two\r\nhundred francs."\r\n\r\nMadame Bourdelais began to laugh. And that was what Henriette called a\r\nbargain! Two hundred francs for a plain ivory mount, with a monogram!\r\nAnd that for a mere piece of Chantilly, over which she had perhaps\r\nsaved five francs. Similar fans could be had, ready mounted, for a\r\nhundred and twenty francs, and she named a shop in the Rue Poissonni\xc3\xa8re\r\nwhere she had seen them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fan was handed round to all the ladies. Madame Guibal\r\nbarely glanced at it. She was a tall, slim woman, with red hair, and\r\na face full of indifference, in which her grey eyes, belying her\r\nunconcerned air, occasionally cast a hungry gleam of selfishness. She\r\nwas never seen out with her husband, a barrister well-known at the\r\nPalais de Justice, who led, it was said, a pretty free life between his\r\nbriefs and his pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Oh," she murmured, passing the fan to Madame de Boves, "I\'ve scarcely\r\nbought one in my life. One always receives too many of such things."\r\n\r\n"You are fortunate, my dear, in having a gallant husband," answered the\r\ncountess in a tone of delicate irony. And bending over to her daughter,\r\na tall girl of twenty, she added: "Just look at the monogram, Blanche.\r\nWhat pretty work! It\'s the monogram that must have increased the price\r\nof the mounting like that."\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves had just turned forty. She was a superb woman, with the\r\nneck and shoulders of a goddess, a large regular face, and big sleepy\r\neyes. Her husband, an Inspector-General of the State Studs, had married\r\nher for her beauty. She appeared quite moved by the delicacy of the\r\nmonogram, seized indeed by a desire which so stirred her as to make her\r\nturn pale; and suddenly turning she continued: "Give us your opinion,\r\nMonsieur Mouret. Is it too dear--two hundred francs for this mount?"\r\n\r\nMouret had remained standing among the five women, smiling and\r\naffecting an interest in what interested them. He took the fan,\r\nexamined it, and was about to give his opinion, when the footman opened\r\nthe door and announced:\r\n\r\n"Madame Marty."\r\n\r\nThere then entered a thin, ugly woman, disfigured by small-pox but\r\ndressed with elaborate elegance. She seemed of uncertain age, her\r\nfive-and-thirty years sometimes appearing equal to thirty, and\r\nsometimes to forty, according to the intensity of the nervous fever\r\nwhich so often agitated her. A red leather bag, which she had not been\r\nwilling to leave in the anteroom, hung from her right hand.\r\n\r\n"Dear madame," said she to Henriette, "you will excuse me bringing\r\nmy bag. Just fancy, as I was coming, along I went into The Paradise,\r\nand as I have again been very extravagant, I did not like to leave\r\nit in my cab for fear of being robbed." Then, having perceived\r\nMouret, she resumed laughing: "Ah! sir, I didn\'t mean to give you an\r\nadvertisement, for I didn\'t know you were here. But you really have\r\nsome extraordinarily fine lace just now."\r\n\r\nThis turned the attention from the fan, which the young man laid on\r\nthe table. The ladies were now all anxious to see what Madame Marty\r\nhad bought. She was known to be very extravagant, totally unable to\r\nresist certain temptations. Strict in her conduct, incapable of any\r\nsexual transgression she proved weak and cowardly before the least\r\nbit of finery. Daughter of a clerk of small means, she was ruining\r\nher husband, the fifth-class professor at the Lyc\xc3\xa9e Bonaparte, who in\r\norder to meet the constantly increasing expenses of the household was\r\ncompelled to double his income of six thousand francs by giving private\r\nlessons. However, she did not open her bag, but held it tightly on her\r\nlap, and began to talk about her daughter Valentine, a girl of fourteen\r\nwhom she dressed like herself, in all the fashionable novelties to\r\nwhose irresistible fascination she succumbed.\r\n\r\n"You know," said she, "they are making girls\' dresses trimmed with\r\nnarrow lace this winter. So when I saw a very pretty Valenciennes----"\r\n\r\nThereupon she at last decided to open her bag; and the ladies were\r\ncraning their necks, when, amidst the silence, the door-bell was heard.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my husband," stammered Madame Marty, in great confusion. "He\r\npromised to call for me on leaving the Lyc\xc3\xa9e Bonaparte."\r\n\r\nForthwith she shut her bag again, and instinctively hid it away under\r\nher chair. All the ladies set up a laugh. This made her blush for her\r\nprecipitation, and she took the bag on her knees again, explaining,\r\nhowever, that men never understood matters and that they need not know\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur de Boves, Monsieur de Vallagnosc," announced the footman.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a surprise. Madame de Boves herself did not expect her\r\nhusband. The latter, a fine man, wearing a moustache and an imperial\r\nin the correct military fashion so much liked at the Tuileries, kissed\r\nthe hand of Madame Desforges, whom he had known as a young girl at her\r\nfather\'s. And then he made way so that his companion, a tall, pale\r\nfellow, of an aristocratic poverty of blood, might in his turn make his\r\nbow to the lady of the house. However, the conversation had hardly been\r\nresumed when two exclamations rang out.\r\n\r\n"What! Is that you, Paul?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Octave!"\r\n\r\nMouret and Vallagnosc thereupon shook hands, much to Madame Desforges\'s\r\nsurprise. They knew each other, then? Of course, they had grown up side\r\nby side at the college at Plassans, and it was quite by chance they had\r\nnot met at her house before. However, jesting together and with their\r\nhands still united they stepped into the little drawing-room, just as\r\nthe servant brought in the tea, a china service on a silver waiter,\r\nwhich he placed near Madame Desforges, on a small round marble table\r\nwith a light brass mounting. The ladies drew up and began talking in\r\nlouder tones, raising a cross-fire of endless chatter; whilst Monsieur\r\nde Boves, standing behind them leant over every now and then to put\r\nin a word or two with the gallantry of a handsome functionary. The\r\nspacious room, so prettily and cheerfully furnished, became merrier\r\nstill with these gossiping voices interspersed with laughter.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Paul, old boy," repeated Mouret.\r\n\r\nHe was seated near Vallagnosc, on a sofa. And alone in the little\r\ndrawing-room--which looked very coquettish with its hangings of\r\nbuttercup silk--out of hearing of the ladies, and not even seeing them,\r\nexcept through the open doorway, the two old friends commenced grinning\r\nwhilst they scrutinized each other and exchanged slaps on the knees.\r\nTheir whole youthful career was recalled, the old college at Plassans,\r\nwith its two courtyards, its damp class-rooms, and the dining-hall in\r\nwhich they had consumed so much cod-fish, and the dormitories where the\r\npillows flew from bed to bed as soon as the monitor began to snore.\r\nPaul, who belonged to an old parliamentary family, noble, poor, and\r\nproud, had proved a good scholar, always at the top of his class and\r\ncontinually held up as an example by the master, who prophesied a\r\nbrilliant future for him; whereas Octave had remained at the bottom,\r\namongst the dunces, but nevertheless fat and jolly, indulging in all\r\nsorts of pleasures outside. Notwithstanding the difference in their\r\ncharacters, a fast friendship had rendered them inseparable until they\r\nwere examined for their bachelor\'s degrees, which they took, the one\r\nwith honours, the other in just a passable manner after two vexatious\r\nrebuffs. Then they went out into the world, each on his own side, and\r\nhad now met again, after the lapse of ten years, already changed and\r\nlooking older.\r\n\r\n"Well," asked Mouret, "what\'s become of you?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all," replied the other.\r\n\r\nVallagnosc indeed, despite the pleasure of this meeting, retained a\r\ntired and disenchanted air; and as his friend, somewhat astonished,\r\ninsisted, saying: "But you must do something. What do you do?" he\r\nmerely replied: "Nothing."\r\n\r\nOctave began to laugh. Nothing! that wasn\'t enough. Little by little,\r\nhowever, he succeeded in learning Paul\'s story. It was the usual story\r\nof penniless young men, who think themselves obliged by their birth\r\nto choose a liberal profession and bury themselves in a sort of vain\r\nmediocrity, happy even when they escape starvation, notwithstanding\r\ntheir numerous degrees. For his part he had studied law by a sort of\r\nfamily tradition; and had then remained a burden on his widowed mother,\r\nwho already hardly knew how to dispose of her two daughters. Having at\r\nlast got quite ashamed of his position he had left the three women to\r\nvegetate on the remnants of their fortune, and had accepted a petty\r\nappointment at the Ministry of the Interior, where he buried himself\r\nlike a mole in his hole.\r\n\r\n"What do you get there?" resumed Mouret.\r\n\r\n"Three thousand francs."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s pitiful pay! Ah! old man, I\'m really sorry for you. What! a\r\nclever fellow like you, who floored all of us! And they only give you\r\nthree thousand francs a year, after having already ground you down for\r\nfive years! No, it isn\'t right!" He paused and then thinking of his own\r\ngood fortune resumed: "As for me, I made them a humble bow long ago.\r\nYou know what I\'m doing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Vallagnosc, "I heard you were in business. You\'ve got that\r\nbig place on the Place Gaillon, haven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it. Counter-jumper, my boy!"\r\n\r\nMouret raised his head, again slapped his friend on the knee, and\r\nrepeated, with the sterling gaiety of a man who did not blush for the\r\ntrade by which he was making his fortune:\r\n\r\n"Counter-jumper, and no mistake! You remember, no doubt, I didn\'t\r\nnibble much at their baits, although at heart I never thought myself\r\na bigger fool than the others. When I took my degree, just to please\r\nthe family, I could have become a barrister or a doctor quite as\r\neasily as any of my school-fellows, but those trades frightened me,\r\nfor one sees so many chaps starving at them. So I just threw the ass\'s\r\nskin away--oh! without the least regret and plunged head-first into\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nVallagnosc smiled with an awkward air, and ultimately muttered: "It\'s\r\nquite certain that your degree can\'t be of much use to you in selling\r\nlinen."\r\n\r\n"Well!" replied Mouret, joyously, "all I ask is, that it shan\'t\r\nstand in my way; and you know, when one has been stupid enough to\r\nburden one\'s self with such a thing, it is difficult to get rid of\r\nit. One goes at a tortoise\'s pace through life, whilst those who are\r\nbare-footed run like madmen." Then, noticing that his friend seemed\r\ntroubled, he took his hand in his, and continued: "Come, come, I don\'t\r\nwant to hurt your feelings, but confess that your degrees have not\r\nsatisfied any of your wants. Do you know that my manager in the silk\r\ndepartment will draw more than twelve thousand francs this year. Just\r\nso! a fellow of very clear intelligence, whose knowledge is confined to\r\nspelling, and the first four rules of arithmetic. The ordinary salesmen\r\nin my place make from three to four thousand francs a year, more than\r\nyou can earn yourself; and their education did not cost anything like\r\nwhat yours did, nor were they launched into the world with a written\r\npromise to conquer it. Of course, it is not everything to make money;\r\nonly between the poor devils possessed of a smattering of science who\r\nnow block up the liberal professions, without earning enough to keep\r\nthemselves from starving, and the practical fellows armed for life\'s\r\nstruggle, knowing every branch of their trade, I don\'t hesitate one\r\nmoment, I\'m for the latter against the former, I think they thoroughly\r\nunderstand the age they live in!"\r\n\r\nHis voice had become impassioned and Henriette, who was pouring out the\r\ntea, turned her head. When he caught her smile, at the further end of\r\nthe large drawing-room, and saw two other ladies listening, he was the\r\nfirst to make merry over his own big phrases.\r\n\r\n"In short, old man, every counter-jumper who commences, has, at the\r\npresent day, a chance of becoming a millionaire."\r\n\r\nVallagnosc indolently threw himself back on the sofa, half-closing his\r\neyes and assuming an attitude of mingled fatigue and disdain in which a\r\ndash of affectation was added to his real hereditary exhaustion.\r\n\r\n"Bah!" murmured he, "life isn\'t worth all that trouble. There is\r\nnothing worth living for." And as Mouret, quite shocked, looked at him\r\nwith an air of surprise, he added: "Everything happens and nothing\r\nhappens; a man may as well remain with his arms folded."\r\n\r\nHe then explained his pessimism--the mediocrities and the abortions of\r\nexistence. For a time he had thought of literature, but his intercourse\r\nwith certain poets had filled him with unlimited despair. He always\r\ncame to the conclusion that every effort was futile, every hour equally\r\nweary and empty, and the world incurably stupid and dull. All enjoyment\r\nwas a failure, there was even no pleasure in wrong-doing.\r\n\r\n"Just tell me, do you enjoy life yourself?" asked he at last.\r\n\r\nMouret was now in a state of astonished indignation, and exclaimed:\r\n"What? Do I enjoy myself? What are you talking about? Why, of course\r\nI do, my boy, and even when things give way, for then I am furious\r\nat hearing them cracking. I am a passionate fellow myself, and don\'t\r\ntake life quietly; that\'s what interests me in it perhaps." He glanced\r\ntowards the drawing-room, and lowered his voice. "Oh! there are some\r\nwomen who\'ve bothered me awfully, I must confess. Still I have my\r\nrevenge, I assure you. But it is not so much the women, for to speak\r\ntruly, I don\'t care a hang for them; the great thing in life is to be\r\nable to will and do--to create, in short. You have an idea; you fight\r\nfor it, you hammer it into people\'s heads, and you see it grow and\r\ntriumph. Ah! yes, my boy, I enjoy life!"\r\n\r\nAll the joy of action, all the gaiety of existence, resounded in\r\nMouret\'s words. He repeated that he went with the times. Really, a man\r\nmust be badly constituted, have his brain and limbs out of order, to\r\nrefuse to work in an age of such vast undertakings, when the entire\r\ncentury was pressing forward with giant strides. And he railed at the\r\ndespairing ones, the disgusted ones, the pessimists, all those weak,\r\nsickly offsprings of our budding sciences, who assumed the lachrymose\r\nairs of poets, or the affected countenances of sceptics, amidst the\r\nimmense activity of the present day. \'Twas a fine part to play, decent\r\nand intelligent, that of yawning before other people\'s labour!\r\n\r\n"But yawning in other people\'s faces is my only pleasure," said\r\nVallagnosc, smiling in his cold way.\r\n\r\nAt this Mouret\'s passion subsided, and he became affectionate again.\r\n"Ah, Paul, you\'re not changed. Just as paradoxical as ever! However,\r\nwe\'ve not met to quarrel. Each man has his own ideas, fortunately. But\r\nyou must come and see my machine at work; you\'ll see it isn\'t a bad\r\nidea. And now, what news? Your mother and sisters are quite well, I\r\nhope? And weren\'t you supposed to get married at Plassans, about six\r\nmonths ago?"\r\n\r\nA sudden movement made by Vallagnosc stopped him, and as his friend had\r\nglanced into the larger drawing-room with an anxious expression, he\r\nalso turned round, and noticed that Mademoiselle de Boves was closely\r\nwatching them. Blanche, tall and sturdy, resembled her mother; but her\r\nface was already puffed out and her features seemed large--swollen,\r\nas it were, by unhealthy fat. Then, in reply to a discreet question,\r\nPaul intimated that nothing was yet settled; perhaps nothing would\r\nbe settled. He had made the young person\'s acquaintance at Madame\r\nDesforges\'s, where he had visited a good deal the previous winter, but\r\nwhither he now very rarely came, which explained why he had not met\r\nOctave there before. In their turn, the Boves invited him, and he was\r\nespecially fond of the father, an ex-man about town who had retired\r\ninto an official position. On the other hand there was no money,\r\nMadame de Boves having brought her husband nothing but her Juno-like\r\nbeauty as a marriage portion. So the family were living poorly on\r\ntheir last mortgaged farm, to the little money derived from which were\r\nfortunately added the nine thousand francs a year drawn by the count\r\nas Inspector-General of the State Studs. Certain escapades, however,\r\ncontinued to empty his purse; and the ladies, mother and daughter,\r\nwere kept very short of money, being at times reduced to turning their\r\ndresses themselves.\r\n\r\n"In that case, why marry?" was Mouret\'s simple question.\r\n\r\n"Well! I can\'t go on like this for ever," said Vallagnosc, with a weary\r\nmovement of the eyelids. "Besides, there are certain expectations, we\r\nare waiting for the death of an aunt."\r\n\r\nHowever, Mouret still kept his eye on Monsieur de Boves, who, seated\r\nnext to Madame Guibal, proved most attentive to her, laughing softly\r\nthe while, with an amorous air. Thereupon Octave turned to his friend\r\nwith such a significant twinkle of the eye that the latter added:\r\n\r\n"Not that one--at least not yet. The misfortune is, that his duties\r\ncall him to the four corners of France, to the breeding d\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4ts, so that\r\nhe has frequent pretexts for absenting himself. Last month, whilst his\r\nwife supposed him to be at Perpignan, he was simply carrying on in\r\nParis, in an out-of-the-way neighbourhood."\r\n\r\nThere ensued a pause. Then the young man, who was also watching the\r\ncount\'s gallantry towards Madame Guibal, resumed in a low tone:\r\n"Really, I think you are right. The more so as the dear lady is not\r\nexactly a saint, if all people say be true. But just look at him! Isn\'t\r\nhe comical, trying to magnetize her with his eyes? The old-fashioned\r\ngallantry, my dear fellow! I adore that man, and if I marry his\r\ndaughter, he may safely say it\'s for his sake!"\r\n\r\nMouret laughed, greatly amused. He questioned Vallagnosc again, and\r\nwhen he found that the first idea of a marriage between him and Blanche\r\nhad come from Madame Desforges, he thought the story better still. That\r\ndear Henriette took a widow\'s delight in marrying people, so much so,\r\nthat when she had provided for the girls, she sometimes allowed their\r\nfathers to choose friends from her company.\r\n\r\nAt that moment she appeared at the door of the little drawing-room,\r\nfollowed by a gentleman apparently about sixty years old, whose arrival\r\nhad not been observed by the two friends, absorbed as they were in\r\nthe conversation they were carrying on, to the accompaniment of the\r\nladies\' voices. These voices at times rang out in a shriller key above\r\nthe tinkling of the small spoons in the china cups; and from time to\r\ntime, during a brief silence you heard a saucer being harshly laid\r\ndown on the marble table. A sudden gleam of the setting sun, which\r\nhad just emerged from behind a thick cloud, gilded the crests of the\r\nchestnut-trees in the gardens, and streamed through the windows in a\r\nred, golden flame, whose glow lighted up the brocatel and brass-work of\r\nthe furniture.\r\n\r\n"This way, my dear baron," said Madame Desforges. "Allow me to\r\nintroduce to you Monsieur Octave Mouret, who is longing to express the\r\nadmiration he feels for you." And turning round towards Octave, she\r\nadded: "Baron Hartmann."\r\n\r\nA smile played on the old man\'s lips. He was short, and vigorous, with\r\na large Alsatian head, and a heavy face, which lighted up with a gleam\r\nof intelligence at the slightest curl of his mouth, the slightest\r\nmovement of his eyelids. For the last fortnight he had resisted\r\nHenriette\'s wish that he should consent to this interview; not that he\r\nfelt any immoderate jealousy of Mouret, but because this was the third\r\nfriend Henriette had introduced to him, and he was afraid of becoming\r\nridiculous at last. And so on approaching Octave he put on the discreet\r\nsmile of one who, albeit willing to behave amiably, is not disposed to\r\nbe a dupe.\r\n\r\n"Oh! sir," said Mouret, with his Proven\xc3\xa7al enthusiasm, "the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier\'s last operation was really astonishing! You cannot think\r\nhow happy and proud I am to know you."\r\n\r\n"Too kind, sir, too kind," repeated the baron, still smiling.\r\n\r\nHenriette, robed in a lace dress, which revealed her delicate neck\r\nand wrists, looked at them with her clear eyes without any sign of\r\nembarrassment; standing between the two, raising her head, and going\r\nfrom one to the other she indeed appeared delighted to see them so\r\nfriendly together.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said she at last, "I leave you to your conversation." And,\r\nturning towards Paul, who had risen from the sofa, she resumed: "Will\r\nyou accept a cup of tea, Monsieur de Vallagnosc?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure, madame," he replied, and they both returned to the\r\nlarger drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMouret resumed his seat on the sofa, when Baron Hartmann likewise\r\nhad sat down on it; and forthwith the young man broke into renewed\r\npraise of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier\'s operations. From that he went on to\r\nthe subject so near his heart, speaking of the new thoroughfare, a\r\nlengthening of the Rue R\xc3\xa9aumur, a section of which running from the\r\nPlace de la Bourse to the Place de l\'Op\xc3\xa9ra was about to be opened under\r\nthe name of the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre. It had been declared a work of\r\npublic utility eighteen months previously; the expropriation jury had\r\njust been appointed; and the whole neighbourhood was excited about\r\nthis new street, anxiously awaiting the commencement of the works,\r\nand taking a keen interest in the houses condemned to disappear. For\r\nthree years Mouret had been waiting for this work--first, in the\r\nexpectation of an increase of his own business; secondly, for the\r\nfurtherance of certain schemes of enlargement which he dared not openly\r\navow, so extensive were his ideas. As the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre was\r\nto cut through the Rue de Choiseul and the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, he\r\npictured The Ladies\' Paradise occupying the whole block of building\r\nwhich these streets and the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin surrounded; and he\r\nalready imagined it with a princely frontage in the new thoroughfare,\r\ndominating everything around like some lord and master of the conquered\r\ncity. Hence his strong desire to make Baron Hartmann\'s acquaintance,\r\nas soon as he had learnt that the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier had contracted\r\nwith the authorities to open and build this Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, on\r\ncondition that it should receive the frontage ground on each side of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n"Really," he repeated, trying to assume a naive look, "you\'ll hand over\r\nthe street ready made, with sewers, pavements, and gas lamps. And the\r\nfrontage ground will suffice to compensate you. Oh! it\'s curious, very\r\ncurious!"\r\n\r\nAt last he came to the delicate point. He was aware that the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier was secretly buying up the houses forming part of the same\r\nblock as The Ladies\' Paradise, not only those which were to fall under\r\nthe demolishers\' pickaxes, but the others as well, those which were\r\nto remain standing; and he suspected the existence of a project for\r\nfounding some great establishment, which made him anxious about those\r\nenlargements of his own premises of which he was ever dreaming, seized\r\nwith fear at the idea that he might one day come into collision with a\r\npowerful company owning property which they certainly would not sell.\r\nIt was precisely this fear which had prompted him to seek an alliance\r\nbetween himself and the Baron under Henriette\'s auspices. No doubt he\r\ncould have seen the financier at his office, and have there talked\r\nthe affair over at his ease; but he felt that he would be stronger in\r\nHenriette\'s house. To be near her, within the beloved perfume of her\r\npresence, to have her ready to convince them both with a smile, seemed\r\nto him a certain guarantee of success.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you bought the former H\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard, that old building next\r\nto my place?" he suddenly inquired.\r\n\r\nThe baron hesitated for a moment, and then denied it. But Mouret looked\r\nhim straight in the face and smiled, from that moment beginning to play\r\nthe part of an open-hearted young man who was always straightforward in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Monsieur le Baron," said he, "as I have the unexpected\r\nhonour of meeting you, I must make a confession. Oh, I don\'t ask you\r\nfor any of your secrets, but I am going to entrust you with mine, for\r\nI\'m certain that I couldn\'t place them in better hands. Besides, I want\r\nyour advice. I have long wished to call and see you, but dared not do\r\nso."\r\n\r\nHe did make his confession, and related his debut in life, not even\r\nconcealing the financial crisis through which he was passing in the\r\nmidst of his triumph. Everything was brought up, the successive\r\nenlargements of his premises, the continual reinvestments of all\r\nprofits in the business, the sums contributed by his employees, the\r\nexistence of the establishment risked at every fresh sale, in which the\r\nentire capital was staked, as it were, on a single throw of the dice.\r\nHowever, it was not money he wanted, for he had a fanatic\'s faith in\r\nhis customers; his ambition ran higher; and he proposed to the baron\r\na partnership, in which the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier should contribute the\r\ncolossal palace which he pictured in his dreams, whilst for his part\r\nhe would give his genius and the business he had already created.\r\nEverything would be properly valued, nothing appeared to him easier to\r\nrealise.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do with your land and buildings?" he asked\r\npersistently. "You have a plan, no doubt. But I\'m quite certain\r\nthat your idea is not so good as mine. Think of it. We build fresh\r\ngalleries on the vacant ground, we pull the houses down or re-arrange\r\nthem and open the most extensive establishment in Paris--a bazaar\r\nwhich will bring in millions." And then he let this fervent, heartfelt\r\nexclamation escape him: "Ah! if I could only do without you! But you\r\nhold everything now. Besides, I shall never have the necessary capital.\r\nCome, we must come to an understanding. It would be a crime not to do\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"How you go ahead, my dear sir!" Baron Hartmann contented himself with\r\nreplying. "What an imagination you have!"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and continued to smile, resolved not to return\r\nconfidence for confidence. In point of fact the idea of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier was to found in the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre a huge rival to the\r\nGrand H\xc3\xb4tel, a luxurious hostelry whose central position would attract\r\nforeigners. At the same time, however, as the hotel was only to occupy\r\na certain frontage, the baron might also have entertained Mouret\'s\r\nidea, and have treated for the rest of the block of houses, which still\r\nrepresented a vast surface. However, he had already advanced funds to\r\ntwo of Henriette\'s friends, and he was getting tired of his lavishness.\r\nBesides, despite his passion for activity, which prompted him to\r\nopen his purse to every fellow of intelligence and courage, Mouret\'s\r\ncommercial genius astonished rather than captivated him. Was not the\r\nfounding of such a gigantic shop a fanciful, imprudent scheme? Would he\r\nnot court certain failure by thus enlarging the drapery trade beyond\r\nall reasonable bounds? In short, he didn\'t believe in the idea and\r\nrefused his support.\r\n\r\n"No doubt the idea is attractive," said he, "but it\'s a poet\'s idea.\r\nWhere would you find the customers to fill such a cathedral?"\r\n\r\nMouret looked at him for a moment in silence, as if stupefied by the\r\nrefusal which these words implied. Was it possible?--a man of such\r\nforesight, who divined the presence of money at no matter what depth!\r\nAnd suddenly, with an extremely eloquent gesture, he pointed to the\r\nladies in the drawing-room and exclaimed: "Customers?--why look there!"\r\n\r\nThe sun was paling and the golden-red flame was now but a yellowish\r\ngleam, dying away on the silk of the hangings and the panels of the\r\nfurniture. At this approach of twilight, the large room was steeped in\r\nwarm cosy pleasantness. While Monsieur de Boves and Paul de Vallagnosc\r\nstood chatting near one of the windows, their eyes wandering far away\r\ninto the gardens, the ladies had closed up, forming in the middle of\r\nthe room a small circle of skirts whence arose bursts of laughter,\r\nwhispered words, ardent questions and replies, all woman\'s passion for\r\nexpenditure and finery. They were talking about dress, and Madame de\r\nBoves was describing a gown she had seen at a ball.\r\n\r\n"First of all, a mauve silk skirt, covered with flounces of old Alen\xc3\xa7on\r\nlace, twelve inches deep."\r\n\r\n"Oh! is it possible!" exclaimed Madame Marty. "Some women are very\r\nfortunate!"\r\n\r\nBaron Hartmann, who had followed Mouret\'s gesture, was looking at\r\nthe ladies through the doorway which was wide open. And he continued\r\nlistening to them with one ear, whilst the young man, inflamed by\r\nhis desire to convince him, went yet deeper into the question,\r\nexplaining the mechanism of the new style of drapery business. This\r\nbranch of commerce was now based on a rapid and continual turning over\r\nof capital, which it was necessary to convert into goods as often\r\nas possible in the same year. For instance, that year his capital,\r\nwhich only amounted to five hundred thousand francs, had been turned\r\nover four times, and had thus produced business to the amount of two\r\nmillions. But this was a mere trifle, which could be increased tenfold,\r\nfor later on, in certain departments, he certainly hoped to turn the\r\ncapital over fifteen or twenty times in the course of the twelvemonth.\r\n\r\n"You understand, baron, the whole system lies in that. It is very\r\nsimple, but it had to be found out. We don\'t need an enormous working\r\ncapital; the sole effort we have to make is to get rid of the stock we\r\nbuy as quickly as possible so as to replace it by other stock which\r\neach time will make our capital return interest. In this way we can\r\ncontent ourselves with a very small profit; as our general expenses\r\namount to as much as sixteen per cent., and as we seldom make more than\r\ntwenty per cent. on our goods, there is only a net profit of four per\r\ncent. at the utmost; only this will finish by representing millions\r\nwhen we can operate on large quantities of goods incessantly renewed.\r\nYou follow me, don\'t you? nothing can be clearer."\r\n\r\nThe baron again shook his head doubtfully. He who had entertained the\r\nboldest schemes and whose daring at the time of the introduction of\r\ngas-lighting was still spoken of, remained in the present instance\r\nuneasy and obstinate.\r\n\r\n"I quite understand," said he; "you sell cheap in order to sell a\r\nquantity, and you sell a quantity in order to sell cheap. But you must\r\nsell, and I repeat my former question: Whom will you sell to? How do\r\nyou hope to keep up such a colossal sale?"\r\n\r\nA loud exclamation, coming from the drawing-room, interrupted Mouret\r\njust as he began to reply. It was Madame Guibal declaring that she\r\nwould have preferred the flounces of old Alen\xc3\xa7on simply round the upper\r\nskirt of the dress.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear," said Madame de Boves, "the upper skirt was covered with\r\nit as well. I never saw anything richer."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s a good idea," resumed Madame Desforges, "I\'ve got several\r\nyards of Alen\xc3\xa7on somewhere; I must look them up for a trimming."\r\n\r\nThen the voices fell again, sinking into a murmur. Prices were quoted,\r\na feverish desire to buy and bargain stirred all the ladies; they were\r\npurchasing lace by the mile.\r\n\r\n"Why?" declared Mouret, when he could at last speak, "one can sell what\r\none likes when one knows how to sell! Therein lies our triumph."\r\n\r\nAnd then with his southern enthusiasm, he pictured the new business\r\nat work in warm, glowing phrases which brought everything vividly\r\nbefore the eyes. First came the wonderful power resulting from the\r\nassemblage of goods, all accumulated on one point and sustaining and\r\nfacilitating the sale of one another. There was never any stand-still,\r\nthe article of the season was always on hand; and from counter to\r\ncounter the customer found herself caught and subjugated, at one buying\r\nthe material for a gown; at another cotton and trimming, elsewhere a\r\nmantle, in fact everything necessary to complete her costume; while in\r\naddition there were all the unforeseen purchases, chases, a surrender\r\nto a longing for the useless and the pretty. Next he began to sing\r\nthe praises of the plain figure system. The great revolution in the\r\nbusiness sprang from this fortunate inspiration. If the old-fashioned\r\nsmall shops were dying out it was because they could not struggle\r\nagainst the low prices which the tickets guaranteed. Competition now\r\nwent on under the very eyes of the public; a look in the windows\r\nenabled people to contrast the prices of different establishments; and\r\neach shop in turn was lowering its rates, contenting itself with the\r\nsmallest possible profit. There could be no deceit, no long prepared\r\nstroke of fortune by selling an article at double its value; there were\r\nsimply current operations, a regular percentage levied on all goods,\r\nand success depended solely on the skilful working of the sales which\r\nbecame the larger from the very circumstance that they were carried on\r\nopenly and honestly. Was it not altogether an astonishing development?\r\nAnd it was already revolutionizing the markets and transforming Paris,\r\nfor it was made of woman\'s flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n"I have the women, I don\'t care a hang for the rest!" exclaimed Mouret,\r\nwith a brutal frankness born of his passion.\r\n\r\nAt this cry Baron Hartmann appeared somewhat moved. His smile lost its\r\ntouch of irony and he glanced at the young man, gradually won over by\r\nthe confidence he displayed and feeling a growing friendship for him.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" he murmured, paternally, "they will hear you."\r\n\r\nBut the ladies were now all speaking at once, so excited that they\r\ndid not even listen to each other. Madame de Boves was finishing the\r\ndescription of an evening-dress; a mauve silk tunic, draped and caught\r\nup by bows of lace; the bodice cut very low, with similar bows of lace\r\non the shoulders.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," said she. "I am having a bodice made like it, with some\r\nsatin----"\r\n\r\n"For my part," interrupted Madame Bourdelais, "I was bent on buying\r\nsome velvet. Oh! such a bargain!"\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Madame Marty asked: "How much did the silk cost?"\r\n\r\nAnd off they started again, all together. Madame Guibal, Henriette, and\r\nBlanche were measuring, cutting out, and making up. It was a pillage of\r\nmaterial, a ransacking of all the shops, an appetite for luxury seeking\r\nsatisfaction in toilettes envied and dreamed of--with such happiness\r\nat finding themselves in an atmosphere of finery, that they buried\r\nthemselves in it, as in warm air necessary to their existence.\r\n\r\nMouret had glanced towards the larger drawing-room, and in a few\r\nphrases, whispered in the baron\'s ear, as if he were confiding to him\r\none of those amorous secrets which men sometimes venture to reveal\r\namong themselves, he finished explaining the mechanism of modern\r\ncommerce. And, above all that he had already spoken of, dominating\r\neverything else, appeared the exploitation of woman to which everything\r\nconduced, the capital incessantly renewed, the system of assembling\r\ngoods together, the attraction of cheapness and the tranquillizing\r\neffect of the marking in plain figures. It was for woman that all the\r\nestablishments were struggling in wild competition; it was woman whom\r\nthey were continually catching in the snares of their bargains, after\r\nbewildering her with their displays. They had awakened new desires\r\nin her flesh; they constituted an immense temptation, before which\r\nshe fatally succumbed, yielding at first to reasonable purchases\r\nof articles needed in the household, then tempted by her coquetry,\r\nand finally subjugated and devoured. By increasing their business\r\ntenfold and popularizing luxury, they--the drapers--became a terrible\r\ninstrument of prodigality, ravaging households, and preparing mad\r\nfreaks of fashion which proved ever more and more costly. And if woman\r\nreigned in their shops like a queen, cajoled, flattered and overwhelmed\r\nwith attentions, she was one on whom her subjects traffic, and who pays\r\nfor each fresh caprice, with a drop of her blood. From beneath the\r\nvery gracefulness of his gallantry, Mouret thus allowed the baron to\r\ndivine the brutality of a Jew who sells woman by the pound weight. He\r\nraised a temple to her, caused her to be steeped in incense by a legion\r\nof shopmen, prepared the ritual of a new cultus, thinking of nothing\r\nbut woman and ever seeking to imagine more powerful fascinations.\r\nBut, behind her back, when he had emptied her purse and shattered her\r\nnerves, he remained full of the secret scorn of a man to whom a woman\r\nhas been foolish enough to yield.\r\n\r\n"Once have the women on your side," he whispered to the baron, laughing\r\nboldly, "and you could sell the very world."\r\n\r\nNow the baron understood. A few sentences had sufficed, he guessed the\r\nrest, and such a gallant exploitation inflamed him, stirring up the\r\nmemories of his past life of pleasure. His eyes twinkled in a knowing\r\nway, and he ended by looking with an air of admiration at the inventor\r\nof this machine for devouring the female sex. It was really clever.\r\nAnd then he made precisely the same remark as Bourdoncle, a remark\r\nsuggested to him by his long experience: "They\'ll make you suffer for\r\nit, by and by, you know," said he.\r\n\r\nBut Mouret shrugged his shoulders with an air of overwhelming disdain.\r\nThey all belonged to him, they were his property, and he belonged to\r\nnone of them. After deriving his fortune and his pleasures from them he\r\nintended to throw them all over for those who might still find their\r\naccount in them. It was the rational, cold disdain of a Southerner and\r\na speculator.\r\n\r\n"Well! my dear baron," he asked in conclusion, "will you join me? Does\r\nthis affair appear possible to you?"\r\n\r\nAlbeit half conquered, the baron did not wish to enter into any\r\nengagement yet. A doubt remained beneath the charm which was gradually\r\noperating on him; and he was going to reply in an evasive manner, when\r\na pressing call from the ladies spared him the trouble. Amidst light\r\nbursts of laughter voices were repeating "Monsieur Mouret! Monsieur\r\nMouret!"\r\n\r\nAnd as the latter, annoyed at being interrupted, pretended not to hear,\r\nMadame de Boves, who had risen a moment previously, came as far as the\r\ndoor of the little drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"You are wanted, Monsieur Mouret. It isn\'t very gallant of you to bury\r\nyourself in a corner to talk over business."\r\n\r\nThereupon he decided to join the ladies, with an apparent good grace, a\r\nwell-feigned air of rapture which quite astonished the baron. Both of\r\nthem rose and passed into the other room.\r\n\r\n"But I am quite at your service, ladies," said Mouret on entering, a\r\nsmile on his lips.\r\n\r\nHe was greeted with an acclamation of triumph and was obliged to step\r\nforward; the ladies making room for him in their midst. The sun had\r\njust set behind the trees in the gardens, the daylight was departing,\r\ndelicate shadows were gradually invading the spacious apartment. It\r\nwas the emotional hour of twilight, that quiet voluptuous moment which\r\nreigns in Parisian flats between the dying brightness of the street\r\nand the lighting of the lamps in the kitchen. Monsieur de Boves and\r\nVallagnosc, still standing before a window, cast shadows upon the\r\ncarpet: whilst, motionless in the last gleam of light which came in by\r\nthe other window, Monsieur Marty, who had quietly entered, shewed his\r\npoverty-stricken silhouette, his worn-out, well-brushed frock coat, and\r\nhis pale face wan from constant teaching and the more haggard as what\r\nhe had heard of the ladies\' conversation had quite upset him.\r\n\r\n"Is your sale still fixed for next Monday?" Madame Marty was just\r\nasking.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, madame," replied Mouret, in a flute-like voice, an actor\'s\r\nvoice, which he assumed when speaking to women.\r\n\r\nHenriette thereupon intervened. "We are all going, you know. They say\r\nyou are preparing wonders."\r\n\r\n"Oh! wonders!" he murmured, with an air of modest fatuity. "I simply\r\ntry to deserve your patronage."\r\n\r\nBut they pressed him with questions: Madame Bourdelais, Madame Guibal,\r\neven Blanche wanted to know something.\r\n\r\n"Come, give us some particulars," repeated Madame de Boves,\r\npersistently. "You are making us die of curiosity."\r\n\r\nAnd they were surrounding him, when Henriette observed that he had not\r\neven taken a cup of tea. At this they were plunged into desolation and\r\nfour of them set about serving him, stipulating however that he must\r\nanswer them afterwards. Henriette poured the tea out, Madame Marty held\r\nthe cup, whilst Madame de Boves and Madame Bourdelais contended for the\r\nhonour of sweetening it. Then, when he had declined to sit down, and\r\nbegan to drink his tea slowly, standing up in the midst of them, they\r\nall drew nearer, imprisoning him in the circle of their skirts; and\r\nwith their heads raised and their eyes sparkling, they smiled upon him.\r\n\r\n"And what about silk, your Paris Delight which all the papers are\r\ntalking of?" resumed Madame Marty, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he replied, "it\'s an extraordinary article, large-grained faille,\r\nsupple and strong. You\'ll see it, ladies, and you\'ll see it nowhere\r\nelse, for we have bought the exclusive right to it."\r\n\r\n"Really! a fine silk at five francs sixty centimes!" said Madame\r\nBourdelais, enthusiastic. "One can hardly believe it."\r\n\r\nEver since the advertisements and puffs had appeared, this silk had\r\noccupied a considerable place in their daily life. They talked of it,\r\npromising themselves some of it, all agog with desire and doubt. And,\r\nbeneath the inquisitive chatter with which they overwhelmed the young\r\nman, one could divine their different temperaments as purchasers.\r\nMadame Marty, carried away by her rage for spending money, bought\r\neverything at The Ladies\' Paradise without selecting, just as things\r\nchanced to be placed in the windows or on the counters. Madame Guibal\r\non the other hand walked about the shop for hours without ever buying\r\nanything, happy and satisfied in simply feasting her eyes; Madame de\r\nBoves, short of money and always tortured by some immoderate desire,\r\nnourished a feeling of rancour against the goods she could not carry\r\naway with her; Madame Bourdelais, with the sharp eyes of a careful\r\nand practical housewife, made straight for the bargains, availing\r\nherself of the big establishments with such skill that she saved a\r\nlot of money; and lastly, Henriette, having very elegant tastes, only\r\npurchased certain articles there, such as gloves, hosiery, and her\r\ncoarser linen.\r\n\r\n"We have other stuffs of astonishing cheapness and richness," continued\r\nMouret, in his musical voice. "For instance, I recommend you our Golden\r\nGrain, a taffeta of incomparable brilliancy. In the fancy silks there\r\nare some charming lines, designs specially chosen from among thousands\r\nby our buyer; and in velvets you will find an exceedingly rich\r\ncollection of shades. I warn you, however, that cloth will be greatly\r\nworn this year; you\'ll see our _matelass\xc3\xa9s_ and our cheviots."\r\n\r\nThey had ceased to interrupt him, and drew yet closer, their lips\r\nparted by vague smiles, their faces eagerly out-stretched as if their\r\nwhole beings were springing towards the tempter. Their eyes grew dim,\r\nand slight quivers ran through them but he meantime retained his calm,\r\nconquering air, amidst the intoxicating perfumes which their hair\r\nexhaled; and between each sentence he continued to sip a little of\r\nhis tea, the aroma of which softened those sharper odours. At sight\r\nof such a power of fascination, so well controlled, strong enough to\r\nplay with woman without being overcome by the intoxication which she\r\ndiffuses, Baron Hartmann, who had not ceased to look at Mouret, felt\r\nhis admiration increasing.\r\n\r\n"So cloth will be worn?" resumed Madame Marty, whose rugged face\r\nsparkled with coquettish passion. "I must have a look at it."\r\n\r\nMadame Bourdelais, who kept a cool look-out, in her turn remarked:\r\n"Your remnant sales take place on Thursdays, don\'t they? I shall wait.\r\nI have all my little ones to clothe." And turning her delicate blonde\r\nhead towards the mistress of the house, she asked: "Sauveur is still\r\nyour dressmaker, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Henriette, "Sauveur is very dear, but she is the only\r\nperson in Paris who knows how to make a dress-body. Besides, Monsieur\r\nMouret may say what he likes but she has the prettiest designs, designs\r\nthat are not seen anywhere else. I can\'t bear to see the same dresses\r\nas mine on every woman\'s back."\r\n\r\nAt first Mouret slightly smiled. Then he intimated that Madame Sauveur\r\nbought her material at his shop; no doubt she went to the manufacturers\r\ndirect for certain designs of which she acquired the sole right of\r\nsale: but for black silks, for instance, she watched for The Paradise\r\nbargains, laying in a considerable stock, which she disposed of at\r\ndouble and treble the price she gave. "Thus I am quite sure that\r\nher buyers will snap up our Paris Delight. Why should she go to the\r\nmanufacturers and pay dearer for this silk than she would at my place?\r\nOn my word of honour, we shall sell it at a loss."\r\n\r\nThis was a decisive blow for the ladies. The idea of getting goods\r\nbelow cost price awoke in them all the natural greed of woman, whose\r\nenjoyment in purchasing is doubled when she thinks that she is robbing\r\nthe tradesman. He knew the sex to be incapable of resisting anything\r\ncheap.\r\n\r\n"But we sell everything for nothing!" he exclaimed gaily, taking\r\nup Madame Desforges\'s fan, which lay behind him on the table. "For\r\ninstance, here\'s this fan. How much do you say it cost."\r\n\r\n"The Chantilly cost twenty-five francs, and the mounting two hundred,"\r\nsaid Henriette.\r\n\r\n"Well, the Chantilly isn\'t dear. However, we have the same at eighteen\r\nfrancs; as for the mount, my dear madame, it\'s a shameful robbery. I\r\nshould not dare to sell one like it for more than ninety francs."\r\n\r\n"Just what I said!" exclaimed Madame Bourdelais.\r\n\r\n"Ninety francs!" murmured Madame de Boves, "one must be very poor\r\nindeed to go without one at that price."\r\n\r\nShe had taken up the fan, and was again examining it with her daughter\r\nBlanche; and, over her large regular face and in her big, sleepy\r\neyes, spread an expression of suppressed and despairing longing\r\nwhich she could not satisfy. The fan once more went the round of the\r\nladies, amidst various remarks and exclamations. Monsieur de Boves\r\nand Vallagnosc, meantime, had left the window, and whilst the former\r\nreturned to his place behind Madame Guibal, whose charms he again began\r\nto admire, with his correct and superior air, the young man leant over\r\nBlanche, endeavouring to think of some agreeable remark.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think it rather gloomy, mademoiselle, that white mount and\r\nthe black lace?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," she replied, gravely, not a blush colouring her inflated cheeks,\r\n"I saw one made of mother-of-pearl and white feathers. Something truly\r\nvirginal!"\r\n\r\nThen Monsieur de Boves, who had doubtless observed the distressful\r\nglances with which his wife was following the fan, at last added his\r\nword to the conversation. "Those flimsy things soon break," said he.\r\n\r\n"Of course they do!" declared Madame Guibal, with a pout, affecting an\r\nair of indifference. "I\'m tired of having mine mended."\r\n\r\nFor several minutes, Madame Marty, very much excited by the\r\nconversation, had been feverishly turning her red leather bag about on\r\nher lap, for she had not yet been able to show her purchases. She was\r\nburning with a sort of sensual desire to display them; and, suddenly\r\nforgetting her husband\'s presence, she opened the bag and took out of\r\nit a few yards of narrow lace wound on a piece of cardboard.\r\n\r\n"This is the Valenciennes for my daughter," said she. "It\'s an inch and\r\na half wide. Isn\'t it delicious? One franc ninety centimes the metre."\r\n\r\nThe lace passed from hand to hand. The ladies were astonished. Mouret\r\nassured them that he sold these little trimmings at cost price.\r\nHowever, Madame Marty had closed the bag, as if to conceal certain\r\nthings she must not show. But after the success obtained by the\r\nValenciennes she was unable to resist the temptation of taking out a\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n"There was this handkerchief as well. Real Brussels, my dear. Oh! a\r\nbargain! Twenty francs!"\r\n\r\nAnd after that the bag became inexhaustible. She blushed with pleasure,\r\nat each fresh article she took out. There was a Spanish blonde-lace\r\ncravat, thirty francs: she hadn\'t wanted it, but the shopman had sworn\r\nit was the last one in stock, and that in future the price would be\r\nraised. Next came a Chantilly veil: rather dear, fifty francs; if she\r\ndidn\'t wear it she could make it do for her daughter.\r\n\r\n"Really, lace is so pretty!" she repeated with her nervous laugh. "Once\r\nI\'m inside I could buy everything."\r\n\r\n"And this?" asked Madame de Boves, taking up and examining some guipure.\r\n\r\n"That," replied she, "is for an insertion. There are twenty-six\r\nyards--a franc the yard. Just fancy!"\r\n\r\n"But," asked Madame Bourdelais, in surprise, "What are you going to do\r\nwith it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know. But it was such a funny pattern!"\r\n\r\nAt that moment however, she chanced to raise her eyes and perceived her\r\nterrified husband in front of her. He had turned paler than ever, his\r\nwhole person expressive of the patient, resigned anguish of a powerless\r\nman, witnessing the reckless expenditure of his dearly earned salary.\r\nEvery fresh bit of lace to him meant disaster; bitter days of teaching,\r\nlong journeys to pupils through the mud, the whole constant effort\r\nof his life resulting in secret misery, the hell of a necessitous\r\nhousehold. And she, perceiving the increasing wildness of his look,\r\nwanted to catch up the veil, cravat and handkerchief and put them out\r\nof sight, moving her feverish hands about and repeating with forced\r\nlaughter: "You\'ll get me a scolding from my husband. I assure you, my\r\ndear, I\'ve been very reasonable; for there was a large lace flounce at\r\nfive hundred francs, oh! a marvel!"\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you buy it?" asked Madame Guibal, calmly. "Monsieur Marty\r\nis the most gallant of men."\r\n\r\nThe poor professor was obliged to bow and say that his wife was quite\r\nfree to buy what she liked. But at thought of the danger to which that\r\nlarge flounce had exposed him, an icy shiver sped down his back; and as\r\nMouret was just at that moment affirming that the new shops increased\r\nthe comfort of middle-class households, he glared at him with a\r\nterrible expression, the flash of hatred of a timid man who would like\r\nto throttle the destroyer but dares not.\r\n\r\nBut the ladies had still retained possession of the lace. They were\r\nintoxicating themselves with their prolonged contemplation of it. The\r\nseveral pieces were unrolled and then passed from one to the other,\r\ndrawing them all still closer together, linking them, as it were, with\r\ndelicate meshes. On their laps there was a continual caress of this\r\nwondrously delicate tissue amidst which their guilty fingers fondly\r\nlingered. They still kept Mouret a close prisoner and overwhelmed him\r\nwith fresh questions. As the daylight continued to decline, he was now\r\nand again obliged to bend his head, grazing their hair with his beard,\r\nas he examined a mesh, or indicated a design. Nevertheless in this soft\r\nvoluptuousness of twilight, in this warm feminine atmosphere, Mouret\r\nstill remained the master whatever the rapture he affected. He seemed\r\nto be a woman himself, they felt penetrated, overcome by the delicate\r\nsense of their secret passions which he possessed, and surrendered\r\nthemselves to him quite captivated; whilst he, certain that he had them\r\nat his mercy, appeared like the despotic monarch of finery, enthroned\r\nabove them all.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Monsieur Mouret! Monsieur Mouret!" they stammered in low,\r\nrapturous voices, amidst the increasing gloom of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe last pale gleams of the heavens were dying away on the brass-work\r\nof the furniture. The laces alone retained a snowy reflection against\r\nthe dark dresses of the ladies, who in a confused group around the\r\nyoung man had a vague appearance of kneeling, worshipping women. A\r\nfinal glow still shone on one side of the silver teapot, a gleam like\r\nthat of a night-light, burning in an alcove balmy with the perfume of\r\ntea. But suddenly the servant entered with two lamps, and the charm was\r\ndestroyed. The drawing-room awoke, light and cheerful once more. Madame\r\nMarty replaced her lace in her little bag and Madame de Boves ate\r\nanother sponge cake, whilst Henriette who had risen began talking in a\r\nlow tone to the baron, near one of the windows.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a charming fellow," said the baron.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t he?" she exclaimed, with the involuntary impulse of a woman in\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and looked at her with paternal indulgence. This was\r\nthe first time he had seen her so completely conquered; and, too\r\nhigh-minded to suffer from it, he experienced nothing but compassion at\r\nseeing her in the hands of this handsome fellow, seemingly so tender\r\nand yet so cold-hearted. He thought he ought to warn her, and so in a\r\njoking way he muttered: "Take care, my dear, or he\'ll eat you all up."\r\n\r\nA flash of jealousy darted from Henriette\'s fine eyes. Doubtless she\r\nunderstood that Mouret had simply made use of her to get at the baron;\r\nbut she vowed that she would render him mad with passion, he whose\r\nhurried style of love-making was instinct with the facile charm of a\r\nsong thrown to the four winds of heaven. "Oh," said she, affecting to\r\njoke in her turn, "the lamb always finishes by eating up the wolf."\r\n\r\nThereupon the baron, greatly amused, encouraged her with a nod. Could\r\nshe be the woman who was to avenge all the others?\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret, after reminding Vallagnosc that he wanted to show him his\r\nmachine at work, came up to take his leave, the baron retained him near\r\nthe window opposite the gardens, now steeped in darkness. He was at\r\nlast yielding to the young man\'s power of fascination; confidence had\r\ncome to him on seeing him amidst those ladies. Both conversed for a\r\nmoment in a low tone, and then the banker exclaimed: "Well, I\'ll look\r\ninto the affair. It\'s settled if your Monday\'s sale proves as important\r\nas you expect."\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and Mouret, delighted, took his leave, for he never\r\nenjoyed his dinner unless before sitting down at table he had been to\r\nglance at the day\'s receipts at The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following Monday, the 10th of October, a bright sun of victory\r\npierced through the grey clouds which had darkened Paris during the\r\nprevious week. There had even been a drizzle throughout the previous\r\nnight, a sort of watery mist whose moisture had dirtied the streets;\r\nbut in the early morning, thanks to the sharp breezes driving the\r\nclouds away, the pavement had become drier; and now the blue sky\r\ndisplayed a limpid, spring-like gaiety.\r\n\r\nThus, already at eight o\'clock, The Ladies\' Paradise blazed forth\r\nbeneath the clear sun-rays in all the glory of its great sale of\r\nwinter novelties. Flags were flying at the door, pieces of woollens\r\nwere flapping about in the fresh morning air, animating the Place\r\nGaillon with the bustle of a country fair; whilst along both streets\r\nthe windows developed symphonious displays whose brilliant tones were\r\nyet heightened by the clearness of the glass. It was like a debauch\r\nof colour, a street pleasure bursting forth, a wealth of purchasable\r\narticles publicly displayed, on which everybody could feast their eyes.\r\n\r\nBut at this early hour very few people entered, a few customers pressed\r\nfor time, housewives of the neighbourhood, women desirous of avoiding\r\nthe afternoon crush. Behind the stuffs which decorated the shop, one\r\ncould divine that it was empty, under arms and waiting for customers,\r\nwith its waxed floors and its counters overflowing with goods.\r\n\r\nThe busy morning crowd barely glanced at the windows, as it passed\r\nwithout slackening its steps. In the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin and on\r\nthe Place Gaillon, where the vehicles were to take their stand, there\r\nwere at nine o\'clock only two cabs. The inhabitants of the district,\r\nand especially the small traders, stirred up by such a show of\r\nstreamers and decorations, alone formed little groups in the doorways\r\nand at the street corners, gazing at the Paradise and venting bitter\r\nremarks. What most filled them with indignation was the sight of one of\r\nthe four delivery vans just introduced by Mouret, which was standing\r\nin the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, in front of the delivery office. These\r\nvans were green, picked out with yellow and red, their brilliantly\r\nvarnished panels gleaming with gold and purple in the sunlight. This\r\nparticular one with its brand-new medley of colours, and the name of\r\nthe establishment painted on either side, whilst up above appeared an\r\nannouncement of the day\'s sale, finished by going off at the fast trot\r\nof a splendid horse, after being filled with parcels left over from\r\nthe previous night; and Baudu, who was standing on the threshold of\r\nThe Old Elbeuf, watched it rolling off towards the boulevard, where\r\nit disappeared to spread amid a starry radiance the hated name of The\r\nLadies\' Paradise all over Paris.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a few cabs were arriving and forming in line. Each time a\r\ncustomer entered, there was a movement amongst the shop messengers,\r\nwho dressed in livery consisting of a light green coat and trousers,\r\nand red and yellow striped waistcoat were drawn up under the lofty\r\ndoorway. Jouve, the inspector and retired captain, was also there,\r\nin a frock-coat and white tie, wearing his decoration as a mark of\r\nrespectability and probity, and receiving the ladies with a gravely\r\npolite air. He bent over them to point out the departments, and then\r\nthey vanished into the vestibule, which had been transformed into an\r\noriental saloon.\r\n\r\nFrom the very threshold it was a marvel, a surprise, which enchanted\r\nall of them. It was to Mouret that this idea had occurred. Before all\r\nothers, he had been the first to purchase at very advantageous rates\r\nin the Levant a collection of old and new carpets, articles then\r\nbut seldom seen and only sold at curiosity shops, at high prices;\r\nand he intended to flood the market with them, selling them at but\r\nlittle more than cost price, and simply utilizing them as a splendid\r\ndecoration which would attract the best class of art customers to his\r\nestablishment. From the centre of the Place Gaillon you could see this\r\noriental saloon, composed solely of carpets and door-curtains hung up\r\nunder his direction. The ceiling was covered with a quantity of Smyrna\r\ncarpets, whose intricate designs stood out boldly on red grounds.\r\nThen from each side there hung Syrian and Karamanian door-curtains,\r\nstreaked with green, yellow, and vermilion; Diarbekir hangings of a\r\ncommoner type, rough to the touch, like shepherds\' cloaks; and carpets\r\nwhich could also be used as door-curtains--long Ispahan, Teheran, and\r\nKermancha rugs, broader ones from Schoumaka and Madras, a strange\r\nflorescence of peonies and palms, fantastic blooms in a garden of\r\ndreamland. On the floor too were more carpets, a heap of greasy\r\nfleeces: in the centre was an Agra carpet, an extraordinary article\r\nwith a white ground and a broad, delicate blue border, through which\r\nran a violet-coloured pattern of exquisite design. And then, here,\r\nthere and everywhere came a display of marvels; Mecca carpets with\r\nvelvety reflections, prayer carpets from Daghestan with the symbolic\r\npoints, Kurdistan carpets covered with blooming flowers; and finally,\r\nin a corner a pile of cheap goods, Gherdes, Koula, and Kirchur rugs\r\nfrom fifteen francs a-piece.\r\n\r\nThis seeming and sumptuous tent, fit for a caliph, was furnished with\r\ndivans and arm-chairs, made of camel sacks, some ornamented with\r\nvariegated lozenges, others with primitive roses. Turkey, Arabia,\r\nPersia and the Indies were all there. They had emptied the palaces,\r\nlooted the mosques and bazaars. A tawny gold prevailed in the weft of\r\nthe old carpets, whose faded tints retained still a sombre warmth, like\r\nthat of an extinguished furnace, a beautiful mellow hue suggestive of\r\nthe old masters. Visions of the East floated before you at sight of all\r\nthe luxury of this barbarous art, amid the strong odour which the old\r\nwool retained of the land of vermin and of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nIn the morning at eight o\'clock, when Denise, who was to enter on her\r\nduties that very Monday, crossed the oriental saloon, she stopped\r\nshort, lost in astonishment, unable to recognise the shop entrance,\r\nand quite overcome by this harem-like decoration planted at the door.\r\nA messenger having shown her to the top of the house, and handed her\r\nover to Madame Cabin, who cleaned and looked after the rooms, this\r\nperson installed her in No. 7, where her box had already been placed.\r\nIt was a narrow cell, opening on the roof by a skylight, and furnished\r\nwith a small bed, a walnut-wood wardrobe, a toilet-table, and two\r\nchairs. Twenty similar rooms ran along the yellow-painted convent-like\r\ncorridor; and, of the thirty-five young ladies in the house, the twenty\r\nwho had no relations in Paris slept there, whilst the remaining fifteen\r\nlodged outside, a few with borrowed aunts and cousins. Denise at once\r\ntook off her shabby woollen dress, worn thin by brushing and mended at\r\nthe sleeves, the only gown that she had brought from Valognes; and then\r\ndonned the uniform of her department, a black silk dress which had been\r\naltered for her and which she found ready on the bed. This dress was\r\nstill too large, too wide across the shoulders; but she was so flurried\r\nby her emotion that she paid no heed to petty questions of coquetry.\r\nShe had never worn silk before; and when rigged out in this unwonted\r\nfinery she went downstairs again and looked at her shining skirt, she\r\nfelt quite ashamed of the noisy rustling of the silk.\r\n\r\nDown below, as she was entering her department, a quarrel burst out and\r\nshe heard Clara exclaim in a shrill voice:\r\n\r\n"Madame, I came in before her."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t true," replied Marguerite. "She pushed past me at the door,\r\nbut I had already one foot in the room."\r\n\r\nThe matter in dispute was their inscription on the list of turns, which\r\nregulated the sales. The girls wrote their names on a slate in the\r\norder of their arrival, and whenever one of them had served a customer,\r\nshe re-inscribed her name beneath the others. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie finished\r\nby deciding in Marguerite\'s favour.\r\n\r\n"Always some injustice here!" muttered Clara, furiously.\r\n\r\nHowever Denise\'s entry reconciled these young ladies. They looked at\r\nher, then smiled at each other. How could a person truss herself up in\r\nthat way! The young girl went and awkwardly wrote her name on the list,\r\nwhere she found herself last. Meanwhile, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie examined her\r\nwith an anxious pout and could not help saying:\r\n\r\n"My dear, two like you could get into your dress; you must have it\r\ntaken in. Besides, you don\'t know how to dress yourself. Come here and\r\nlet me arrange you a bit."\r\n\r\nThen she placed her before one of the tall glasses alternating with the\r\nmassive doors of the cupboards containing the dresses. The spacious\r\napartment, surrounded by these mirrors and carved oak wood-work,\r\nits floor covered with red carpet of a large pattern, resembled the\r\ncommonplace drawing-room of an hotel, traversed by a continual stream\r\nof travellers. The young ladies dressed in regulation silk, and\r\npromenading their charms about, without ever sitting down on the dozen\r\nchairs reserved for the customers, completed the resemblance. Between\r\ntwo button-holes of their dress bodies they all wore a long pencil,\r\nwith its point in the air; and protruding from their pockets, you could\r\nsee the white leaves of a book of debit-notes. Several ventured to\r\nwear jewellery--rings, brooches and chains; but their great coquetry,\r\nthe point of display in which, given the forced uniformity of their\r\ndress they all struggled for pre-eminence, was their hair, hair ever\r\noverflowing, its volume augmented by plaits and chignons when their\r\nown did not suffice, and combed, curled, and decked in every possible\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\n"Pull the waist down in front," said Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie to Denise. "There,\r\nyou now have no hump on your back. And your hair, how can you massacre\r\nit like that? It would be superb, if you only took a little trouble."\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, Denise\'s only beauty. Of a beautiful flaxen hue, it\r\nfell to her ankles: and when she did it up, it was so troublesome that\r\nshe simply rolled it in a knot, keeping it together with the strong\r\nteeth of a bone comb. Clara, greatly annoyed by the sight of this\r\nabundant hair, affected to laugh at it, so strange did it look, twisted\r\nup anyhow with savage grace. She made a sign to a saleswoman in the\r\nunder-linen department, a girl with a broad face and agreeable manner.\r\nThe two departments, which adjoined one another, were ever at variance,\r\nstill the young ladies sometimes joined together in laughing at other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Cugnot, just look at that mane," said Clara, whom\r\nMarguerite was nudging, also feigning to be on the point of bursting\r\ninto laughter.\r\n\r\nBut Mademoiselle Cugnot was not in the humour for joking. She had\r\nbeen looking at Denise for a moment and remembered what she had\r\nsuffered herself during the first few months after her arrival in the\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\n"Well, what?" said she. "Everybody hasn\'t got such a mane as that!"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she returned to her place, leaving the two others\r\ncrestfallen. Denise, who had heard everything, followed her with\r\na glance of gratitude, while Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie gave her a book of\r\ndebit-notes with her name on it, remarking:\r\n\r\n"To-morrow you must get yourself up better; and now, try and pick up\r\nthe ways of the house, and wait your turn for selling. To-day\'s work\r\nwill be very hard; we shall be able to judge of your capabilities."\r\n\r\nDespite her prophecies, the department still remained deserted; very\r\nfew customers came to buy mantles at this early hour. The young\r\nladies husbanded their strength, prudently preparing for the exertion\r\nof the afternoon. Denise, intimidated by the thought that they were\r\nwatching her, sharpened her pencil, for the sake of something to do;\r\nthen, imitating the others, she stuck it in her bosom, between two\r\nbuttonholes, and summoned up all her courage, for it was necessary that\r\nshe should conquer a position. On the previous evening she had been\r\ntold that she was accepted as a probationer, that is to say, without\r\nany fixed salary; she would simply have the commission and allowance on\r\nwhat she sold. However, she fully hoped to earn twelve hundred francs\r\na year even in this way, knowing that the good saleswomen earned as\r\nmuch as two thousand, when they liked to take the trouble. Her expenses\r\nwere regulated; a hundred francs a month would enable her to pay P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s\r\nboard and lodging, assist Jean, who did not earn a sou, and procure\r\nsome clothes and linen for herself. Only, in order to attain to this\r\nlarge amount, she would have to prove industrious and pushing, taking\r\nno notice of the ill-will displayed by those around her but fighting\r\nfor her share and even snatching it from her comrades if necessary.\r\nWhile she was thus working herself up for the struggle, a tall young\r\nman, passing the department, smiled at her; and when she saw that\r\nit was Deloche, who had been engaged in the lace department on the\r\nprevious day, she returned his smile, happy at the friendship which\r\nthus presented itself and accepting his recognition as a good omen.\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine a bell rang for the first luncheon. Then a fresh peal\r\nannounced the second; and still no customers appeared. The second-hand,\r\nMadame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric, who, with the sulky harshness of widowhood, delighted\r\nin prophesying disasters, declared curtly that the day was lost, that\r\nthey would not see a soul, that they might close the cupboards and go\r\naway; predictions which clouded the flat face of Marguerite who was\r\neager to make money, whilst Clara, with her runaway-horse appearance,\r\nalready began dreaming of an excursion to the woods of Verri\xc3\xa8res should\r\nthe house really fail. As for Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, she remained silent\r\nand serious, promenading her C\xc3\xa6sarian countenance about the empty\r\ndepartment, like a general who has responsibility whether in victory or\r\nin defeat.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\'clock a few ladies appeared; and Denise\'s turn for\r\nserving had arrived when the approach of a customer was signalled.\r\n\r\n"The fat old girl from the country--you know whom I mean," murmured\r\nMarguerite to Clara.\r\n\r\nIt was a woman of forty-five, who occasionally journeyed to Paris\r\nfrom the depths of some out-of-the-way department where she saved\r\nher money up for months together. Then, hardly out of the train, she\r\nmade straight for The Ladies\' Paradise, and spent all her savings.\r\nShe very rarely ordered anything by letter for she liked to see and\r\nhandle the goods, and would profit by her journeys to lay in a stock of\r\neverything, even down to needles, which she said were extremely dear\r\nin her small town. The whole staff knew her, was aware that her name\r\nwas Boutarel, and that she lived at Albi, but troubled no further about\r\nher, neither about her position nor her mode of life.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, madame?" graciously asked Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, who had come\r\nforward. "And what can we show you? You shall be attended to at once."\r\nThen, turning round she added: "Now, young ladies!"\r\n\r\nDenise approached; but Clara had sprung forward. As a rule, she was\r\nvery careless and idle, not caring about the money she earned in the\r\nshop, as she could get plenty outside. However, the idea of doing the\r\nnewcomer out of a good customer spurred her on.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, it\'s my turn," said Denise, indignantly.\r\n\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie set her aside with a severe look, exclaiming: "There are\r\nno turns. I alone am mistress here. Wait till you know, before serving\r\nour regular customers."\r\n\r\nThe young girl retired, and as tears were coming to her eyes, and she\r\nwished to conceal her sensibility, she turned her back and stood up\r\nbefore the window, pretending to gaze into the street. Were they going\r\nto prevent her selling? Would they all conspire to deprive her of the\r\nimportant sales, like that? Fear for the future came over her, she\r\nfelt herself crushed between so many contending interests. Yielding\r\nto the bitterness of her abandonment, her forehead against the cold\r\nglass, she gazed at The Old Elbeuf opposite, thinking that she ought\r\nto have implored her uncle to keep her. Perhaps he himself regretted\r\nhis decision, for he had seemed to her greatly affected the previous\r\nevening. And now she was quite alone in this vast house, where no one\r\ncared for her, where she found herself hurtled, lost. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 and Jean,\r\nwho had never left her side, were living with strangers; she was parted\r\nfrom everything, and the big tears which she strove to keep back made\r\nthe street dance before her in a sort of fog. All this time, the hum of\r\nvoices continued behind her.\r\n\r\n"This one makes me look a fright," Madame Boutarel was saying.\r\n\r\n"You really make a mistake, madame," said Clara; "the shoulders fit\r\nperfectly--but perhaps you would prefer a pelisse to a mantle?"\r\n\r\nJust then Denise started. A hand was laid on her arm. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\naddressed her severely:\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re doing nothing now, eh? only looking at the people\r\npassing? Things can\'t go on like this, you know!"\r\n\r\n"But since I\'m not allowed to sell, madame?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s other work for you, mademoiselle! Begin at the beginning.\r\nDo the folding-up."\r\n\r\nIn order to please the few customers who had called, they had already\r\nbeen obliged to ransack the cupboards, and on the two long oaken\r\ntables, to the right and left, lay heaps of mantles, pelisses, and\r\ncapes, garments of all sizes and materials. Without replying, Denise\r\nbegan to sort and fold them carefully and arrange them again in the\r\ncupboards. This was the lowest work, generally performed by beginners.\r\nShe ceased to protest, however, knowing that they required the\r\nstrictest obedience, and prepared to wait until the first-hand should\r\nbe good enough to let her sell, as she seemed at first to have the\r\nintention of doing. She was still folding, when Mouret appeared upon\r\nthe scene. To her his arrival came as a shock, she blushed without\r\nknowing why, and again seized by a strange fear, thinking that he\r\nwas going to speak to her. But he did not even see her; he no longer\r\nremembered the little girl whom a momentary impression had induced him\r\nto support.\r\n\r\n"Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie," he called curtly.\r\n\r\nHe was rather pale, but his eyes were clear and resolute. In making the\r\ntour of the departments he had found them empty, and the possibility\r\nof defeat had suddenly presented itself before him amidst all his\r\nobstinate faith in fortune. True, it was only eleven o\'clock; he knew\r\nby experience that as a rule the crowd never arrived much before the\r\nafternoon. But certain symptoms troubled him. On the inaugural days\r\nof previous sales a general movement had manifested itself even in\r\nthe morning; besides, he did not see any of those bareheaded women,\r\ncustomers living in the neighbourhood, who usually dropped into his\r\nshop as into a neighbour\'s. Despite his habitual resolution, like all\r\ngreat captains, he felt at the moment of giving battle a superstitious\r\nweakness growing on him. Things would not succeed, he was lost, and\r\nhe could not have explained why; yet he thought he could read his\r\ndefeat on the faces of the passing ladies. Just at that moment, Madame\r\nBoutarel, she who always bought something, turned away, explaining,\r\n"No, you have nothing that pleases me. I\'ll see, I\'ll decide later on."\r\n\r\nMouret watched her depart. Then, as Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie ran up at his call,\r\nhe took her aside, and they exchanged a few rapid words. She waved\r\nher hands despairingly and was evidently admitting that things were\r\nbad. For a moment they remained face to face, overcome by one of those\r\ndoubts which generals conceal from their soldiers. But at last, in his\r\nbrave way, he exclaimed aloud: "If you want any assistance, take a girl\r\nfrom the workroom. She\'ll be a little help to you."\r\n\r\nThen he continued his inspection, in despair. He had avoided Bourdoncle\r\nall the morning, for his assistant\'s anxious doubts irritated him.\r\nHowever, on leaving the under-linen department, where business was\r\nstill worse than in the mantle gallery, he suddenly came upon him, and\r\nwas obliged to listen to the expression of his fears. Still he did not\r\nhesitate to send him to the devil, with the brutality which he did not\r\nspare even his principal employees when things were looking bad.\r\n\r\n"Do keep quiet!" said he, "Everything is going on all right. I shall\r\nend by pitching the tremblers out of doors."\r\n\r\nThen, alone and erect, he took his stand on the landing overlooking the\r\ncentral hall, whence he commanded a view of almost the entire shop;\r\naround him were the first-floor departments; beneath him those of the\r\nground-floor. Up above, the emptiness seemed heart-breaking; in the\r\nlace department an old woman was having every box searched and yet\r\nbuying nothing; whilst three good-for-nothing minxes in the under-linen\r\ndepartment were slowly choosing some collars at eighteen sous a-piece.\r\nDown below, in the covered galleries, in the rays of light which come\r\nin from the street, he noticed that customers were gradually becoming\r\nmore numerous. There was a slow, intermittent procession wending its\r\nway past the counters; in the mercery and the haberdashery departments\r\nsome women of the commoner class were pushing about, still there was\r\nhardly a soul among the linens or the woollens. The shop messengers, in\r\ntheir green swallow-tails with bright brass buttons, were waiting for\r\ncustomers with dangling hands. Now and again there passed an inspector\r\nwith a ceremonious air, very stiff in his white choker. And Mouret was\r\nespecially grieved by the mortal silence which reigned in the hall,\r\nwhere the light fell from a ground-glass roofing through which the\r\nsunrays filtered in a white diffuse hovering dust, whilst down below\r\nthe silk department seemed to be asleep, in a quivering, church-like\r\nquietude. A shopman\'s footstep, a few whispered words, the rustling of\r\na passing skirt, were the only faint sounds; and these the warm air of\r\nthe heating apparatus almost stifled. However, carriages were beginning\r\nto arrive, the sudden pulling up of the horses was heard, followed by\r\nthe banging of the doors of the vehicles. Outside, a distant tumult\r\nwas commencing to rise, inquisitive folks were jostling in front of\r\nthe windows, cabs were taking up their positions on the Place Gaillon,\r\nthere were all the appearances of a crowd\'s approach. Still on seeing\r\nthe idle cashiers leaning back on their chairs behind their wickets,\r\nand observing that the parcel-tables with their boxes of string and\r\nreams of blue packing-paper remained unlittered, Mouret, though\r\nindignant with himself for being afraid, thought he could feel his\r\nimmense machine ceasing to work and turning cold beneath him.\r\n\r\n"I say, Favier," murmured Hutin, "look at the governor up there. He\r\ndoesn\'t seem to be enjoying himself."\r\n\r\n"Oh! this is a rotten shop!" replied Favier. "Just fancy, I\'ve not sold\r\na thing yet."\r\n\r\nBoth of them, on the look-out for customers, from time to time\r\nwhispered such short remarks as these, without looking at each other.\r\nThe other salesmen of the department were occupied in piling up pieces\r\nof the Paris Delight under Robineau\'s orders; whilst Bouthemont, in\r\nfull consultation with a thin young woman, seemed to be taking an\r\nimportant order. Around them, on light and elegant shelves, were heaps\r\nof plain silks, folded in long pieces of creamy paper, and looking\r\nlike pamphlets of an unusual size; whilst, encumbering the counters,\r\nwere fancy silks, moires, satins and velvets, resembling beds of cut\r\nflowers, quite a harvest of delicate and precious tissues. This was the\r\nmost elegant of all the departments, a veritable drawing-room, where\r\nthe goods, so light and airy, seemed to be simply so much luxurious\r\nfurnishing.\r\n\r\n"I must have a hundred francs by Sunday," said Hutin. "If I don\'t make\r\nan average of twelve francs a day, I\'m lost. I reckoned on this sale."\r\n\r\n"By Jove! a hundred francs; that\'s rather stiff," retorted Favier. "I\r\nonly want fifty or sixty. You must go in for swell jollifications,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, my dear fellow. It\'s a stupid affair; I made a bet and lost.\r\nSo I have to stand a dinner for five persons, two fellows and three\r\ngirls. Hang me! I\'ll let the first that passes in for twenty yards of\r\nParis Delight!"\r\n\r\nThey continued talking for a few minutes, relating what they had done\r\non the previous day, and what they intended to do on the ensuing\r\nSunday. Favier followed the races while Hutin did a little boating,\r\nand patronized music-hall singers. But they were both possessed by the\r\nsame eager desire for money, fighting for it throughout the week, and\r\nspending it all on Sunday. It was their sole thought in the shop, a\r\nthought which urged them into an incessant and pitiless struggle. And\r\nto think that cunning Bouthemont had just managed to get hold of Madame\r\nSauveur\'s messenger, the skinny woman with whom he was talking! That\r\nmeant good business, three or four dozen pieces, at least, for the\r\ncelebrated dressmaker always gave large orders. A moment before too,\r\nRobineau had taken it into his head to trick Favier out of a customer.\r\n\r\n"Oh! as for that fellow, we must settle his hash," said Hutin, who took\r\nadvantage of the slightest incidents to stir up the salesmen against\r\nthe man whose place he coveted. "Ought the first and second hands to\r\nsell? \'Pon my word! my dear fellow, if ever I become second you\'ll see\r\nhow well I\'ll act with the others."\r\n\r\nThereupon, with his plump, amiable little Norman person he began\r\nenergetically playing the good-natured man. Favier could not help\r\ncasting a side glance at him; however he retained his phlegmatic air\r\nand contented himself with replying:\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. For my part I should be only too pleased." Then, as a\r\nlady came up, he added in a lower tone: "Look out! Here\'s one for you."\r\n\r\nIt was a lady with a blotchy face, wearing a yellow bonnet, and a red\r\ndress. Hutin immediately divined in her a woman who would buy nothing;\r\nso in all haste he stooped behind the counter, pretending to be doing\r\nup his boot-lace: and, thus concealed, he murmured: "No fear, let some\r\none else take her. I don\'t want to lose my turn!"\r\n\r\nHowever, Robineau was calling him: "Whose turn, gentlemen? Monsieur\r\nHutin\'s? Where\'s Monsieur Hutin?"\r\n\r\nAnd as that gentleman still gave no reply, it was the next salesman who\r\nserved the lady with the blotches. Hutin was quite right, she simply\r\nwanted some patterns with the prices; and she detained the salesman\r\nmore than ten minutes, overwhelming him with questions. However,\r\nRobineau had seen Hutin get up from behind the counter; and so when\r\nanother customer arrived, he interfered with a stern air, and stopped\r\nthe young man just as he was rushing forward.\r\n\r\n"Your turn has passed. I called you, and as you were there behind----"\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t hear you, sir."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do! write your name at the bottom. Now, Monsieur Favier, it\'s\r\nyour turn."\r\n\r\nFavier, greatly amused at heart by this adventure, gave his friend a\r\nglance, as if to excuse himself. Hutin, with pale lips, had turned his\r\nhead away. What particularly enraged him was that he knew the customer\r\nvery well, an adorable blonde who often came to their department, and\r\nwhom the salesmen called amongst themselves "the pretty lady," knowing\r\nnothing of her except her looks, not even her name. She always made\r\na good many purchases, instructed a messenger to take them to her\r\ncarriage, and then immediately disappeared. Tall, elegant, dressed with\r\nexquisite taste, she appeared to be very rich, and to belong to the\r\nbest society.\r\n\r\n"Well! and your hussy?" asked Hutin of Favier, when the latter returned\r\nfrom the pay-desk, whither he had accompanied the lady.\r\n\r\n"Oh! a hussy!" replied the other. "No, she looks far too lady-like. She\r\nmust be the wife of a stockbroker or a doctor, or something of that\r\nsort."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me! All the women get themselves up so much alike\r\nnow-a-days that it\'s impossible to tell what they are!"\r\n\r\nFavier glanced at his debit book. "I don\'t care!" he resumed, "I\'ve\r\nstuck her for two hundred and ninety-three francs. That makes nearly\r\nthree francs for me."\r\n\r\nHutin bit his lips, and vented his spleen on the debit books. Another\r\ninvention for cramming their pockets! There was a secret rivalry\r\nbetween these two. Favier, as a rule, pretended to consider himself\r\nof small account and to recognise Hutin\'s superiority, but in reality\r\ndevoured him all the while behind his back. Thus, Hutin was wild at\r\nthe thought of the three francs pocketed so easily by a salesman whom\r\nhe considered his inferior in business-talent. A fine day\'s work! If\r\nit went on like this, he would not earn enough to pay for the seltzer\r\nwater for his Sunday guests. And in the midst of the battle, which was\r\nnow becoming fiercer, he walked along the counters with hungry eyes,\r\neager for his share, jealous even of his superior, who was just showing\r\nthe thin young woman out, and saying to her:\r\n\r\n"Very well! it\'s understood. Tell her I\'ll do my best to obtain this\r\nfavour from Monsieur Mouret."\r\n\r\nMouret had quitted his post up above some time before. Suddenly he\r\nreappeared on the landing of the principal staircase which communicated\r\nwith the ground floor; and here again he commanded a view of the whole\r\nestablishment. His face was regaining its colour, his faith was coming\r\nback and increasing at sight of the crowd which was gradually filling\r\nthe place. It was the expected rush at last, the afternoon crush, which\r\nin his feverishness he had for a moment despaired of. All the shopmen\r\nwere at their posts, a last ring of the bell had announced the end\r\nof the third lunch; the disasters of the morning, due no doubt to a\r\nshower which had fallen about nine o\'clock, could still be repaired,\r\nfor the blue sky of daybreak had come back with its victorious gaiety.\r\nNow that the first-floor departments were growing animated, he was\r\nobliged to stand back to make way for the women who were coming up to\r\nthe under-clothing and mantle departments; whilst, behind him, in the\r\nlace and the shawl departments, he heard shopmen and customers talking\r\nof large sums. But the sight of the galleries on the ground-floor\r\nespecially reassured him. There was a crowd among the haberdashery, and\r\neven the linen and woollen departments were invaded. The procession of\r\nbuyers had closed up; and now nearly all of them wore hats or bonnets,\r\nit was only here and there that you espied the white caps of a few\r\nbelated housewives. In the yellow light streaming down into the silk\r\nhall, ladies had taken off their gloves to feel the Paris Delight on\r\nwhich they commented in whispers. And there was no longer any mistaking\r\nthe noises which came from outside, the rolling of cabs, the banging of\r\ncarriage-doors, all the increasing tumult of a growing crowd. Mouret\r\nfelt that his machine was again setting to work beneath him, getting\r\nup steam and reviving to activity, from the pay-desks where gold was\r\njingling, and the tables where messengers were hurriedly packing up\r\ngoods, to the delivery-room in the basement, which was quickly filling\r\nwith the parcels sent down to it, its subterraneous rumble seeming to\r\nshake the whole house. And in the midst of the crowd was inspector\r\nJouve, walking about gravely, on the look-out for thieves.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! is that you?" said Mouret, all at once recognising Paul de\r\nVallagnosc whom a messenger was conducting to him. "No, no, you are\r\nnot in my way. Besides, you\'ve only to follow me if you want to see\r\neverything, for to-day I stay in the breach."\r\n\r\nHe still felt a little anxious. No doubt there were plenty of people,\r\nbut would the sale prove to be the triumph he hoped for? However, he\r\nlaughed with Paul and gaily carried him off.\r\n\r\n"Things seem to be picking up a bit," said Hutin to Favier. "But\r\nsomehow I\'ve no luck; there are some days that are precious bad,\r\nmy word! I\'ve just made another miss, that old frump hasn\'t bought\r\nanything."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he glanced towards a lady who was walking off, casting\r\nlooks of disgust at all the goods. He was not likely to get fat on his\r\nthousand francs a year, unless he sold something; as a rule he made\r\nseven or eight francs a day in commission, which with his regular pay\r\ngave him an average of ten francs a day. Favier never made much more\r\nthan eight, and yet now that animal was literally taking the bread out\r\nof his mouth, for he had just sold another dress. To think of it, a\r\ncold-natured fellow who had never known how to amuse a customer! It was\r\nexasperating.\r\n\r\n"Those chaps over there seem to be doing very well," remarked Favier,\r\nspeaking of the salesmen in the hosiery and haberdashery departments.\r\n\r\nBut Hutin, who was looking all round the place, suddenly inquired:\r\n"Do you know Madame Desforges, the governor\'s sweetheart? Look! that\r\ndark woman in the glove department, who is having some gloves tried on\r\nby Mignot." He paused, then resumed in a low tone, as if speaking to\r\nMignot, on whom he continued to direct his eyes: "Oh, go on, old man,\r\nyou may pull her fingers about as much as you like, that won\'t do you\r\nany good! We know your conquests!"\r\n\r\nThere was a rivalry between himself and the glove-man, the rivalry\r\nof two handsome fellows, who both affected to flirt with the\r\nlady-customers. As a matter of fact neither had any real conquests to\r\nboast about, but they invented any number of mysterious adventures,\r\nseeking to make people believe in all sorts of appointments given them\r\nby titled ladies between two purchases.\r\n\r\n"You ought to get hold of her," said Favier, in his sly, artful way.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good idea!" exclaimed Hutin. "If she comes here I\'ll let her\r\nin for something extensive; I want a five-franc piece!"\r\n\r\nIn the glove department there was quite a row of ladies seated before\r\nthe narrow counter covered with green velvet and edged with nickel\r\nsilver; and before them the smiling shopmen were heaping up flat boxes\r\nof a bright pink, taken out of the counter itself, and resembling the\r\nticketed drawers of a secr\xc3\xa9taire. Mignot, in particular, was bending\r\nhis pretty doll-like face forward, and striving to impart tender\r\ninflections to his thick Parisian voice. He had already sold Madame\r\nDesforges a dozen pairs of kid gloves, the Paradise gloves, one of the\r\nspecialties of the house. She had then asked for three pairs of Su\xc3\xa8des,\r\nand was now trying on some Saxon gloves, for fear the size should not\r\nbe exact.\r\n\r\n"Oh! the fit is perfect, madame," repeated Mignot. "Six and a quarter\r\nwould be too large for a hand like yours."\r\n\r\nHalf-lying on the counter, he held her hand, taking her fingers one\r\nby one and slipping the glove on with a long, renewed, persistently\r\ncaressing touch, looking at her the while as if he expected to see in\r\nher face some sign of pleasure. But she, with her elbow on the velvet\r\ncounter and her wrist raised, surrendered her fingers to him with the\r\nsame unconcerned air as that with which she gave her foot to her maid\r\nso that she might button her boot. For her indeed he was not a man; she\r\nutilized his services with the disdain she always showed for servants\r\nand did not even look at him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t hurt you, madame?" he inquired.\r\n\r\nShe replied "No," with a shake of the head. The smell of the Saxon\r\ngloves--a savage smell resembling sugared musk--troubled her as a rule,\r\nbut seated at this commonplace counter she did not notice it.\r\n\r\n"And what next, madame?" asked Mignot.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, thanks. Be good enough to carry the parcel to pay-desk No.\r\n10, for Madame Desforges."\r\n\r\nBeing a constant customer, she gave her name at a pay-desk, and had\r\neach purchase sent there without requiring a shopman to follow her.\r\nWhen she had gone away, Mignot turned towards his neighbour and winked,\r\nand would have liked him to believe that some wonderful things had just\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Madame Desforges continued her purchases. She turned to\r\nthe left, stopping in the linen department to procure some dusters;\r\nthen she walked round and went as far as the woollen department at the\r\nfurther end of the gallery. As she was well pleased with her cook,\r\nshe wanted to make her a present of a dress. The woollen department\r\noverflowed with a compact crowd; all the lower middle-class women were\r\nthere, feeling the stuffs and absorbed in mute calculations; and she\r\nwas obliged to sit down for a moment. The shelves were piled up with\r\ngreat rolls of material which the salesmen took down one by one, with\r\na sudden pull. They were indeed getting confused with all the litter\r\non the counters, where stuffs were mingling and slipping down. It\r\nwas a sea of neutral tints, the dull hues of woollens--iron-greys,\r\nyellow-greys and blue-greys, with here and there a Scotch tartan and a\r\nblood-red flannel showing brightly. And the white tickets on the pieces\r\nlooked like a scanty shower of snow flakes, dotting a dark December\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nBehind a pile of poplin, Li\xc3\xa9nard was joking with a tall bare-headed\r\ngirl, a work-girl of the neigbourhood, sent by her mistress to match\r\nsome merino. He detested these big-sale days, which tired him to death,\r\nand endeavoured to shirk his work, getting plenty of money from his\r\nfather and not caring a fig about the business but doing only just\r\nenough to avoid being dismissed.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Mademoiselle Fanny," he was saying; "you are always in a\r\nhurry. Did the striped vicuna suit the other day? I shall come and see\r\nyou, and ask for my commission, mind."\r\n\r\nBut the girl ran off, laughing, and Li\xc3\xa9nard found himself before Madame\r\nDesforges, whom he could not help asking: "What can I serve you with,\r\nmadame?"\r\n\r\nShe wanted a dress, not too dear but yet of strong stuff. Li\xc3\xa9nard,\r\nwith the view of sparing his arms, which was his principal thought,\r\nman\xc5\x93uvred so as to make her take one of the stuffs already unfolded on\r\nthe counter. There were cashmeres, serges and vicunas there, and he\r\ndeclared that there was nothing better to be had, for you could never\r\nwear them out. However, none of these seemed to satisfy her. On one of\r\nthe shelves she had observed a blue shalloon, which she wished to see.\r\nSo he made up his mind at last, and took down the roll, but she thought\r\nthe material too rough. Then he showed her a cheviot, some diagonals,\r\nsome greys, every sort of woollens, which she felt out of curiosity,\r\njust for the pleasure of doing so, decided at heart to take no matter\r\nwhat. The young man was thus obliged to empty the highest shelves; his\r\nshoulders cracked and the counter vanished under the silky grain of the\r\ncashmeres and poplins, the rough nap of the cheviots and the tufty down\r\nof the vicunas; there were samples of every material and every tint.\r\nThough she had not the least wish to buy any, she even asked to see\r\nsome grenadine and some Chamb\xc3\xa9ry gauze. Then, when she had seen enough,\r\nshe remarked:\r\n\r\n"Oh! after all, the first is the best; it\'s for my cook. Yes, the\r\nnarrow ribbed serge, the one at two francs." And when Li\xc3\xa9nard had\r\nmeasured it, pale with suppressed anger, she added: "Have the goodness\r\nto take that to pay-desk No. 10, for Madame Desforges."\r\n\r\nJust as she was going away, she recognised Madame Marty near her,\r\naccompanied by her daughter Valentine, a tall girl of fourteen, thin\r\nand bold, who already cast a woman\'s covetous looks on the materials.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s you, dear madame?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear madame; what a crowd--is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t speak of it, it\'s stifling. And such a success! Have you\r\nseen the oriental saloon?"\r\n\r\n"Superb--wonderful!"\r\n\r\nThereupon, amidst all the jostling, pushed hither and thither by the\r\ngrowing crowd of modest purses rushing upon the cheap woollen goods,\r\nthey went into ecstasies over the exhibition of Eastern carpets.\r\nAnd afterwards Madame Marty explained that she was looking for some\r\nmaterial for a mantle; but she had not quite made up her mind and\r\nwanted to see some woollen _matelass\xc3\xa9_.\r\n\r\n"Look, mamma," murmured Valentine, "it\'s too common."\r\n\r\n"Come to the silk department," then said Madame Desforges, "you must\r\nsee their famous Paris Delight."\r\n\r\nMadame Marty hesitated for a moment. It would be very dear, and she had\r\nfaithfully promised her husband to be reasonable! She had been buying\r\nfor an hour, quite a pile of articles was following her already: a muff\r\nand some quilling for herself and some stockings for her daughter. She\r\nfinished by saying to the shopman who was showing her the _matelass\xc3\xa9_:\r\n\r\n"Well--no; I\'m going to the silk department; you\'ve nothing to suit me."\r\n\r\nThe shopman then took up the articles already purchased and walked off\r\nbefore the ladies.\r\n\r\nIn the silk department there was also a crowd, the principal crush\r\nbeing opposite the inside display arranged by Hutin, to which Mouret\r\nhad given the finishing touches. This was at the further end of the\r\nhall, around one of the slender wrought-iron columns which supported\r\nthe glass roof. A perfect torrent of material, a billowy cascade\r\nfell from above, spreading out more and more as it neared the floor.\r\nThe bright satins and soft-tinted silks--the Reine and Renaissance\r\nsatins with the pearly tones of spring water; the light silks,\r\nNile-green, Indian-azure, May-pink, and Danube-blue all of crystalline\r\ntransparency--flowed forth above. Then came the stronger fabrics:\r\nwarm-tinted Merveilleux satins, and Duchess silks, rolling in waves\r\nof increasing volume; whilst at the bottom, as in a fountain-basin,\r\nthe heavy materials, the figured armures, the damasks, and brocades,\r\nthe beaded silks and the silk embroidered with gold and silver,\r\nreposed amidst a deep bed of velvet of every sort--black, white,\r\nand coloured--with patterns stamped on silk and satin grounds, and\r\nspreading out with their medley of colours like a still lake in which\r\nreflections of sky and scenery were seemingly dancing. The women, pale\r\nwith desire, bent over as if to look at themselves in a mirror. And\r\nbefore this gushing cataract they all remained hesitating between a\r\nsecret fear of being carried away by such a flood of luxury, and an\r\nirresistible desire to jump in and be lost in it.\r\n\r\n"Here you are, then!" said Madame Desforges, on finding Madame\r\nBourdelais installed before a counter.\r\n\r\n"Ah! good day!" replied the latter, shaking hands with the other\r\nladies. "Yes, I\'ve come to have a look."\r\n\r\n"What a prodigious exhibition! It\'s like a dream. And the oriental\r\nsaloon! Have you seen the oriental saloon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; extraordinary!"\r\n\r\nBut beneath this enthusiasm, which was decidedly to be the fashionable\r\nnote of the day, Madame Bourdelais retained her practical housewifely\r\ncoolness. She was carefully examining a piece of Paris Delight, for\r\nshe had come on purpose to profit by the exceptional cheapness of this\r\nsilk, if she found it really advantageous. She was doubtless satisfied\r\nwith it, for she bought five-and-twenty yards, hoping that this\r\nquantity would prove sufficient to make a dress for herself and a cloak\r\nfor her little girl.\r\n\r\n"What! you are going already?" resumed Madame Desforges. "Take a walk\r\nround with us."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; they are waiting for me at home. I didn\'t like to risk\r\nbringing the children into this crowd."\r\n\r\nThereupon she went away, preceded by the salesman carrying the\r\ntwenty-five yards of silk, who led her to pay-desk No. 10, where young\r\nAlbert was getting confused by all the demands for invoices with which\r\nhe was besieged. When the salesman was able to approach, after having\r\ninscribed his sale on a debit-note, he called out the item, which\r\nthe cashier entered in a register; then it was checked, and the leaf\r\ntorn out of the salesman\'s debit book was stuck on a file near the\r\nreceipting stamp.\r\n\r\n"One hundred and forty francs," said Albert.\r\n\r\nMadame Bourdelais paid and gave her address, for having come on foot\r\nshe did not wish to be troubled with a parcel. Joseph had already\r\nreceived the silk behind the pay-desk, and was tying it up; and then\r\nthe parcel, thrown into a basket on wheels, was sent down to the\r\ndelivery department, which seemed to swallow up all the goods in the\r\nshop with a sluice-like roar.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the block was becoming so great in the silk department\r\nthat Madame Desforges and Madame Marty could not find a salesman\r\ndisengaged. So they remained standing, mingling with the crowd of\r\nladies who were looking at the silks and feeling them, staying there\r\nfor hours without making up their minds. However the Paris Delight\r\nproved the great success; around it pressed one of those crowds whose\r\nfeverish infatuation decrees a fashion in a day. A host of shopmen were\r\nengaged in measuring off this silk; above the customers\' heads you\r\ncould see the pale glimmer of the unfolded pieces, as the fingers of\r\nthe employees came and went along the oak yard measures hanging from\r\nbrass rods; and you could hear the noise of scissors swiftly cutting\r\nthe silk, as fast as it was unwound, as if indeed there were not\r\nshopmen enough to suffice for all the greedy outstretched hands of the\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\n"It really isn\'t bad for five francs sixty centimes," said Madame\r\nDesforges, who had succeeded in getting hold of a piece at the edge of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nMadame Marty and her daughter experienced some disappointment, however.\r\nThe newspapers had said so much about this silk, that they had expected\r\nsomething stronger and more brilliant. However, Bouthemont had just\r\nrecognised Madame Desforges, and anxious to pay his court to such a\r\nhandsome lady, who was supposed to be all-powerful with the governor,\r\nhe came forward, with rather coarse amiability. What! no one was\r\nserving her! it was unpardonable! He begged her to be indulgent, for\r\nreally they did not know which way to turn. And then he began to look\r\nfor some chairs amongst the neighbouring skirts, laughing the while\r\nwith his good-natured laugh, full of a brutal love for the sex, which\r\ndid not seem to displease Henriette.\r\n\r\n"I say," murmured Favier, as he went to take some velvet from a shelf\r\nbehind Hutin, "there\'s Bouthemont making up to your mash."\r\n\r\nBeside himself with rage with an old lady, who, after keeping him a\r\nquarter of an hour, had finished by buying a yard of black satin for\r\na pair of stays, Hutin had quite forgotten Madame Desforges. In busy\r\nmoments they took no notice of the turns, each salesman served the\r\ncustomers as they arrived. And he was answering Madame Boutarel, who\r\nwas finishing her afternoon at The Ladies\' Paradise, where she had\r\nalready spent three hours in the morning, when Favier\'s warning made\r\nhim start. What! was he going to miss the governor\'s sweetheart, from\r\nwhom he had sworn to extract a five-franc piece for himself? That would\r\nbe the height of ill-luck, for he hadn\'t made three francs as yet with\r\nall those other chignons who were mooning about the place!\r\n\r\nBouthemont was just then calling out loudly: "Come gentlemen, some one\r\nthis way!"\r\n\r\nThereupon Hutin passed Madame Boutarel over to Robineau, who was doing\r\nnothing. "Here\'s the second-hand, madame. He will answer you better\r\nthan I can."\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed off to take Madame Marty\'s purchases from the woollen\r\nsalesman who had accompanied the ladies. That day a nervous excitement\r\nmust have interfered with his usually keen scent. As a rule, the first\r\nglance told him if a customer meant to buy, and how much. Then he\r\ndomineered over the customer, hastened to serve her so as to pass on to\r\nanother, imposing his choice upon her and persuading her that he knew\r\nbetter than herself what material she required.\r\n\r\n"What sort of silk, madame?" he asked, in his most gallant manner and\r\nMadame Desforges had no sooner opened her mouth than he added: "I know,\r\nI\'ve got just what you want."\r\n\r\nWhen the piece of Paris Delight was unfolded on a corner of the\r\ncounter, between heaps of other silks, Madame Marty and her daughter\r\napproached. Hutin, rather anxious, understood that it was at first a\r\nquestion of serving these two. Whispered words were exchanged, Madame\r\nDesforges was advising her friend. "Oh! certainly," she murmured. "A\r\nsilk at five francs twelve sous will never equal one at fifteen, or\r\neven ten."\r\n\r\n"It is very light," repeated Madame Marty. "I\'m afraid that it has not\r\nsufficient body for a mantle."\r\n\r\nThis remark induced the salesman to intervene. He smiled with the\r\nexaggerated politeness of a man who cannot make a mistake. "But\r\nflexibility, madame, is the chief quality of this silk. It will not\r\ncrimple. It\'s exactly what you require."\r\n\r\nImpressed by such an assurance, the ladies said no more. They had taken\r\nthe silk up, and were again examining it, when they felt a touch on\r\ntheir shoulders. It was Madame Guibal, who had been slowly walking\r\nabout the shop for an hour past, feasting her eyes on all the assembled\r\nriches but not buying so much as a yard of calico. And now there was\r\nanother explosion of gossip.\r\n\r\n"What! Is that you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s I, rather knocked about though."\r\n\r\n"What a crowd--eh? One can\'t get about. And the oriental saloon?"\r\n\r\n"Ravishing!"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! what a success! Stay a moment, we will go upstairs\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks, I\'ve just come down."\r\n\r\nHutin was waiting, concealing his impatience beneath a smile that did\r\nnot quit his lips. Were they going to keep him there long? Really the\r\nwomen took things very coolly, it was like stealing money out of his\r\npocket. At last, however, Madame Guibal went off to resume her stroll,\r\nturning round the large display of silks with an enraptured air.\r\n\r\n"Well, if I were you I should buy the mantle ready-made," said Madame\r\nDesforges, suddenly returning to the Paris Delight. "It won\'t cost you\r\nso much."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true that the trimmings and making-up----" murmured Madame Marty.\r\n"Besides, one has more choice."\r\n\r\nAll three had risen; Madame Desforges, turning to Hutin, said to him:\r\n"Have the goodness to show us to the mantle department."\r\n\r\nHe remained dumbfounded, unaccustomed as he was to such defeats. What!\r\nthe dark lady bought nothing! Had he made a mistake then? Abandoning\r\nMadame Marty he thereupon attacked Madame Desforges, exerting all his\r\nability as a salesman on her. "And you, madame, would you not like to\r\nsee our satins, our velvets? We have some extraordinary bargains."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, another time," she coolly replied, looking at him no more than\r\nshe had looked at Mignot.\r\n\r\nHutin had to take up Madame Marty\'s purchases and walk off before the\r\nladies to show them to the mantle department. But he also had the grief\r\nof seeing that Robineau was selling Madame Boutarel a large quantity of\r\nsilk. Decidedly his scent was playing him false, he wouldn\'t make four\r\nsous! Beneath the amiable propriety of his manners his heart swelled\r\nwith the rage of a man robbed and devoured by others.\r\n\r\n"On the first floor, ladies," said he, without ceasing to smile.\r\n\r\nIt was no easy matter to reach the staircase. A compact crowd of heads\r\nwas surging under the galleries and expanding like an overflowing\r\nriver in the middle of the hall. Quite a battle of business was going\r\non, the salesmen had this population of women at their mercy, and\r\npassed them on from one to another with feverish haste. The moment\r\nof the formidable afternoon rush, when the over-heated machine led\r\nits customers such a feverish dance, extracting money from their very\r\nflesh, had at last arrived. In the silk department especially a gust\r\nof folly seemed to reign, the Paris Delight had brought such a crowd\r\ntogether that for several minutes Hutin could not advance a step; and\r\nHenriette, half-suffocated, having raised her eyes to the summit of the\r\nstairs there beheld Mouret, who ever returned thither as to a favourite\r\nposition, from which he could view victory. She smiled, hoping that he\r\nwould come down and extricate her. But he did not even recognise her in\r\nthe crowd; he was still with Vallagnosc, showing him the establishment,\r\nhis face beaming with triumph the while.\r\n\r\nThe trepidation within was now stifling all outside noise; you no\r\nlonger heard the rumbling of the vehicles, nor the banging of their\r\ndoors; apart from the loud buzzing of the sales nought remained but\r\na consciousness that the immensity of Paris stretched all around, an\r\nimmensity which would always furnish buyers. In the heavy still air,\r\nin which the fumes of the heating apparatus heightened the odours\r\nof the stuffs, there was an increasing hubbub compounded of all\r\nsorts of noises, of continual tramping, of phrases a hundred times\r\nrepeated around the counters, of gold jingling on the brass tablets\r\nof the pay-desks, which a legion of purses besieged, and of baskets\r\non wheels laden with parcels which were constantly disappearing into\r\nthe gaping cellars. And, amidst the fine dust, everything finished by\r\ngetting mixed, it became impossible to recognise the divisions of the\r\ndifferent departments; the haberdashery department over yonder seemed\r\nsubmerged; further on, in the linen department, a ray of sunshine,\r\nentering by a window facing the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, looked like\r\na golden dart in a mass of snow; while, among the gloves and woollens,\r\na dense mass of bonnets and chignons hid the background of the shop\r\nfrom view. Even the toilettes could no longer be distinctly seen, the\r\nhead-gear alone appeared, decked with feathers and ribbons, while a\r\nfew men\'s hats here and there showed like black spots, and the woman\'s\r\ncomplexions, pale with fatigue and heat, assumed the transparency of\r\ncamelias. At last, Hutin--thanks to his vigorous elbows--was able to\r\nopen a way for the ladies, by keeping in front of them. But on reaching\r\nthe landing, Henriette no longer found Mouret there, for he had just\r\nplunged Vallagnosc into the midst of the crowd in order to complete his\r\nbewilderment, he himself, too, feeling the need of a dip into this bath\r\nof success. He lost his breath with rapture, feeling the while a kind\r\nof continuous caress from all his customers.\r\n\r\n"To the left, ladies," said Hutin, still attentive despite his\r\nincreasing exasperation.\r\n\r\nUp above, however, there was the same block. People invaded even the\r\nfurnishing department, usually the quietest of all. The shawl, the fur,\r\nand the under-clothing departments literally swarmed with customers;\r\nand as the ladies crossed the lace gallery another meeting took place.\r\nMadame de Boves was there with her daughter Blanche, both buried amidst\r\nthe articles which Deloche was showing them. And again Hutin had to\r\nmake a halt, parcel in hand.\r\n\r\n"Good afternoon! I was just thinking of you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been looking for you myself. But how can you expect to find any\r\none in this crowd?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s magnificent, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Dazzling, my dear. We can hardly stand."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re buying?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, we\'re only looking round. It rests us a little to be seated."\r\n\r\nAs a fact, Madame de Boves, with scarcely more than her cab-fare in\r\nher purse, was having all sorts of laces handed down, simply for the\r\npleasure of seeing and handling them. She had guessed Deloche to be\r\na new salesman, slow and awkward, who dared not resist a customer\'s\r\nwhims; and she had taken advantage of his bewildered good-nature, to\r\nkeep him there for half an hour, still asking for fresh articles. The\r\ncounter was covered, and she plunged her hands into an increasing\r\nmountain of lace, Malines, Valenciennes, and Chantilly, her fingers\r\ntrembling with desire, her face gradually warming with a sensual\r\ndelight; whilst Blanche, close to her, agitated by the same passion,\r\nwas very pale, her flesh inflated and flabby. However, the conversation\r\ncontinued; and Hutin, standing there waiting their good pleasure, could\r\nhave slapped their faces for all the time they were making him lose.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Madame Marty, "you\'re looking at some cravats and\r\nhandkerchiefs like those I showed you the other day."\r\n\r\nThis was true; Madame de Boves, tormented by Madame Marty\'s lace ever\r\nsince the previous Saturday, had been unable to resist the desire to at\r\nleast handle some like it, since the meagre allowance which her husband\r\nmade her did not permit her to carry any away. She blushed slightly,\r\nexplaining that Blanche had wished to see the Spanish-blonde cravats.\r\nThen she added: "You\'re going to the mantles. Well! we\'ll see you\r\nagain. Shall we say in the oriental saloon?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, in the oriental saloon--Superb, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThen they separated enraptured, amidst the obstruction which the sale\r\nof insertions and small trimmings at low prices was causing. Deloche,\r\nglad to be occupied, again began emptying the boxes before the mother\r\nand daughter. And amidst the groups pressing close to the counters,\r\ninspector Jouve slowly walked about with his military air, displaying\r\nhis decoration and watching over all the fine and precious goods, so\r\neasy to conceal up a sleeve. When he passed behind Madame de Boves,\r\nsurprised to see her with her arms plunged in such a heap of lace he\r\ncast a quick glance at her feverish hands.\r\n\r\n"To the right, ladies," said Hutin, resuming his march.\r\n\r\nHe was beside himself with rage. Was it not enough that he had missed\r\na sale down below? Now they kept on delaying him at each turn of the\r\nshop! And with his annoyance was blended no little of the rancour that\r\nexisted between the textile and the ready-made departments, which\r\nwere in continual hostility, ever fighting for customers and stealing\r\neach other\'s percentages and commissions. Those of the silk hall were\r\nyet more enraged than those of the woollen department whenever a lady\r\ndecided to take a mantle after looking at numerous taffetas and failles\r\nand they were obliged to conduct her to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s gallery.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Vadon!" said Hutin, in an angry voice, when he at last\r\narrived in the department.\r\n\r\nBut Mademoiselle Vadon passed by without listening, absorbed in a sale\r\nwhich she was conducting. The room was full, a stream of people were\r\ncrossing it, entering by the door of the lace department and leaving\r\nby that of the under-clothing department, whilst on the right were\r\ncustomers trying on garments, and posing before the mirrors. The red\r\ncarpet stifled all noise of footsteps here, and the distant roar from\r\nthe ground-floor died away, giving place to a discreet murmur and a\r\ndrawing-room warmth, increased by the presence of so many women.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Prunaire!" cried out Hutin. And as she also took no\r\nnotice of him, he added between his teeth, so as not to be heard: "A\r\nset of jades!"\r\n\r\nHe was certainly not fond of them, tired to death as he was by climbing\r\nthe stairs to bring them customers and furious at the profits which\r\nhe accused them of taking out of his pocket. It was a secret warfare,\r\ninto which the young ladies themselves entered with equal fierceness;\r\nand in their mutual weariness, always on foot and worked to death, all\r\ndifference of sex disappeared and nothing remained but their contending\r\ninterests, irritated by the fever of business.\r\n\r\n"So there\'s no one here to serve?" asked Hutin.\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly caught sight of Denise. She had been kept folding all\r\nthe morning, only allowed to serve a few doubtful customers, to whom\r\nmoreover she had not sold anything. When Hutin recognised her, occupied\r\nin clearing an enormous heap of garments off the counters, he ran up to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Look here, mademoiselle! serve these ladies who are waiting."\r\n\r\nThereupon he quickly slipped Madame Marty\'s purchases into her arms,\r\ntired as he was of carrying them about. His smile returned to him\r\nbut it was instinct with the secret maliciousness of the experienced\r\nsalesman, who shrewdly guessed into what an awkward position he had\r\njust thrown both the ladies and the young girl. The latter, however,\r\nremained quite perturbed by the prospect of this unhoped-for sale which\r\nsuddenly presented itself. For the second time Hutin appeared to her as\r\nan unknown friend, fraternal and tender-hearted, always ready to spring\r\nout of the darkness to save her. Her eyes glistened with gratitude; she\r\nfollowed him with a lingering look, whilst he began elbowing his way as\r\nfast as possible towards his department.\r\n\r\n"I want a mantle," said Madame Marty.\r\n\r\nThen Denise questioned her. What style of mantle? But the lady had no\r\nidea, she wished to see what the house had got. And the young girl,\r\nalready very tired, bewildered by the crowd, quite lost her head; she\r\nhad never served any but the rare customers who came to Cornaille\'s,\r\nat Valognes; she did not even know the number of the models, nor\r\ntheir places in the cupboards. And so she was hardly able to reply to\r\nthe ladies, who were beginning to lose patience, when Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nperceived Madame Desforges, of whose connection with Mouret she was no\r\ndoubt aware, for she hastened up and asked with a smile:\r\n\r\n"Are these ladies being served?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that young person over there is attending to us," replied\r\nHenriette. "But she does not appear to be very well up to her work; she\r\ncan\'t find anything."\r\n\r\nAt this, the first-hand completely paralyzed Denise by stepping up\r\nto her and saying in a whisper: "You see very well you know nothing.\r\nDon\'t interfere any more, please." Then turning round she called out:\r\n"Mademoiselle Vadon, these ladies require a mantle!"\r\n\r\nShe remained looking on whilst Marguerite showed the models. This girl\r\nassumed a dry polite voice with customers, the disagreeable manner of\r\na young person robed in silk, accustomed to rub against elegance in\r\nevery form, and full, unknown to herself, of jealousy and rancour.\r\nWhen she heard Madame Marty say that she did not wish to pay more\r\nthan two hundred francs, she made a grimace of pity. Oh! madame would\r\ncertainly give more, for it would be impossible to find anything at\r\nall suitable for two hundred francs. Then she threw some of the common\r\nmantles on a counter with a gesture which signified: "Just see, aren\'t\r\nthey pitiful?" Madame Marty dared not think them nice after that; but\r\nbent over to murmur in Madame Desforges\'s ear: "Don\'t you prefer to be\r\nserved by men? One feels more comfortable?"\r\n\r\nAt last Marguerite brought a silk mantle trimmed with jet, which she\r\ntreated with respect. And thereupon Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie abruptly called\r\nDenise.\r\n\r\n"Come, do something at all events. Just put that on your shoulders."\r\n\r\nDenise, wounded to the heart, despairing of ever succeeding, had\r\nremained motionless, her hands dangling by her side. No doubt she would\r\nbe sent away, and the children would be without food. All the tumult\r\nof the crowd buzzed in her head, her legs were tottering and her arms\r\nbruised by the handling of so many garments, a porter\'s work which\r\nshe had never done before. However, she was obliged to obey and allow\r\nMarguerite to put the mantle on her, as on a dummy.\r\n\r\n"Stand upright," said Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie.\r\n\r\nBut a moment afterwards Denise was forgotten. Mouret had just come\r\nin with Vallagnosc and Bourdoncle; and he bowed to the ladies, who\r\ncomplimented him on his magnificent exhibition of winter novelties. Of\r\ncourse they went into raptures over the oriental saloon. Vallagnosc,\r\nwho was finishing his walk through the departments, displayed more\r\nsurprise than admiration; for, after all, thought he, with his\r\npessimist nonchalance, it was nothing more than an immense collection\r\nof drapery. Bourdoncle, however, forgetting that he himself belonged to\r\nthe establishment, likewise congratulated the governor in order to make\r\nhim forget his anxious doubts and persecutions of the earlier part of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; things are going on very well, I\'m quite satisfied,"\r\nrepeated Mouret, radiant, replying with a smile to Madame Desforges\'s\r\nloving looks. "But I must not interrupt you, ladies."\r\n\r\nThen all eyes were again turned on Denise. She placed herself entirely\r\nin the hands of Marguerite, who was making her turn round.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it--eh?" asked Madame Marty of Madame Desforges.\r\n\r\nThe latter gave her opinion, like a supreme umpire of fashion. "It\r\nisn\'t bad, the cut is original, but it doesn\'t seem to me very graceful\r\nabout the waist."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" interrupted Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, "it must be seen on the lady herself.\r\nYou can understand, it does not have much effect on this young person,\r\nwho is so slim. Hold up your head, mademoiselle, give the mantle all\r\nits importance."\r\n\r\nThey smiled. Denise had turned very pale. She felt ashamed at being\r\nthus turned into a machine, which they examined and joked about so\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nMadame Desforges, yielding to the natural antipathy of a contrary\r\nnature, annoyed by the girl\'s gentle face, maliciously added: "No\r\ndoubt it would set better if the young person\'s gown were not so\r\nloose-fitting."\r\n\r\nThereupon she cast at Mouret the mocking glance of a Parisienne amused\r\nby the ridiculous rig of a country girl. He felt the amorous caress\r\nof this glance, the triumph of a woman proud of her beauty and her\r\nart. And so out of pure gratitude, the gratitude of a man who knew\r\nhimself to be adored, he felt obliged to joke in his turn, despite his\r\ngood-will towards Denise of whose secret charm he was conscious.\r\n\r\n"Besides, her hair should be combed," he murmured.\r\n\r\nThis was the last straw. The director deigned to laugh so all the young\r\nladies ventured to do the same. Marguerite risked a slight chuckle,\r\nlike a well-behaved girl who restrains herself; but Clara left a\r\ncustomer so as to enjoy the fun at her ease; and even some saleswomen\r\nof the under-clothing department came in, attracted by the talking.\r\nAs for the lady customers they took it more quietly, with an air of\r\nwell-bred enjoyment. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie was the only one who did not smile;\r\nit was as if Denise\'s splendid wild-looking hair and slender virginal\r\nshoulders had dishonoured her, compromised the good reputation of her\r\ndepartment. Denise herself had turned paler still, amidst all these\r\npeople who were laughing at her. She felt herself violated, exposed to\r\nall their hostile glances, without defence. What had she done that they\r\nshould thus attack her spare figure, and her too luxuriant hair? But\r\nshe was especially wounded by Madame Desforges\'s and Mouret\'s laughter,\r\ninstinctively divining their connection and her heart sinking with\r\nan unknown grief. That lady was surely very ill-natured to attack a\r\npoor girl who had said nothing; and as for Mouret, he most decidedly\r\nfilled her with a freezing fear, in which all her other sentiments\r\ndisappeared. And, totally abandoned, assailed in her most cherished\r\nfeelings of modesty, indignant at such injustice, she was obliged to\r\nstifle the sobs which were rising in her throat.\r\n\r\n"I should think so; let her comb her hair to-morrow," said the terrible\r\nBourdoncle to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie. Full of scorn for Denise\'s small limbs he\r\nhad condemned her the first time he had seen her.\r\n\r\nAt last the first-hand came and took the mantle off Denise\'s shoulders,\r\nsaying to her in a low tone: "Well! mademoiselle, here\'s a fine start.\r\nReally, if this is the way you show your capabilities--It is impossible\r\nto be more stupid!"\r\n\r\nFearing that her tears might gush from her eyes Denise hastened back\r\nto the heap of garments, which she began sorting on the counter.\r\nThere at least she was lost in the crowd. Fatigue prevented her from\r\nthinking. But all at once near by she perceived the saleswoman of the\r\nunder-clothing department, who had already defended her that morning.\r\nThe latter had followed the scene, and murmured in her ear:\r\n\r\n"My poor child, you mustn\'t be so sensitive. Keep that to yourself,\r\nor they\'ll go on worse and worse. I come from Chartres. Yes, Pauline\r\nCugnot is my name; and my parents are millers. Well! the girls here\r\nwould have devoured me during the first few days if I had not stood up\r\nfirm. Come, be brave! give me your hand, we\'ll have a talk together\r\nwhenever you like."\r\n\r\nThis outstretched hand redoubled Denise\'s confusion; she shook it\r\nfurtively and hastened to take up a load of cloaks, fearing lest she\r\nmight again be accused of a transgression and receive a scolding if it\r\nwere known she had a friend.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie herself, had just put the mantle on Madame\r\nMarty, and they all exclaimed: "Oh! how nice! delightful!" It at\r\nonce looked quite different. Madame Desforges decided that it would\r\nbe impossible to improve on it. A good deal of bowing ensued, Mouret\r\ntook his leave, whilst Vallagnosc, who had perceived Madame de Boves\r\nand her daughter in the lace department, hastened to offer his arm\r\nto the former. Marguerite, standing before one of the pay-desks, was\r\nalready calling out the different purchases made by Madame Marty, who\r\nsettled for them and ordered the parcel to be taken to her cab. Madame\r\nDesforges had found her articles at pay-desk No. 10. Then the ladies\r\nmet once more in the oriental saloon. They were leaving, but it was\r\namidst a loquacious outburst of admiration. Even Madame Guibal became\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\n"Oh! delicious! it makes you think you are in the East; doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"A real harem, and not at all dear!"\r\n\r\n"And the Smyrnas! oh, the Smyrnas! what tones, what delicacy!"\r\n\r\n"And that Kurdestan! Just look, a real Delacroix!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd was thinning. The bell, at an hour\'s interval, had already\r\nannounced the first two dinners; the third was about to be served, and\r\nin the departments there now only remained a few lingering customers,\r\nwhose fever for spending money had made them forget the time. Outside\r\nnothing was heard but the rolling of the last cabs breaking upon the\r\nhusky voice of Paris, a snort like that of a satiated ogre digesting\r\nall the linens and cloths, silks and laces with which he had been\r\ngorged since the morning. Within, beneath the flaming gas-jets, which,\r\nburning in the twilight, had illumined the last supreme efforts of the\r\nsale, everything looked like a field of battle still warm with the\r\nmassacre of the materials. The salesmen, harassed and fatigued, camped\r\namidst the contents of their shelves and counters, which appeared to\r\nhave been thrown into confusion by the furious blast of a hurricane.\r\nIt was with difficulty that you traversed the galleries on the ground\r\nfloor, obstructed by straggling chairs. In the glove department it\r\nwas necessary to step over a pile of cases heaped up around Mignot;\r\nthrough the woollens there was no means of passing at all, Li\xc3\xa9nard was\r\ndozing on an ocean of bales, in which certain pieces standing on end,\r\nthough half destroyed, seemed like houses which an overflowing river\r\nwas carrying away; and, further on, the linen department appeared like\r\na heavy fall of snow, and you stumbled against icebergs of napkins, and\r\nwalked through flakes of handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThe same disorder prevailed upstairs, in the departments of the first\r\nfloor: the furs were scattered over the flooring, the mantles were\r\nheaped up like the great-coats of soldiers _hors-de-combat_, the laces\r\nand the under-linen, unfolded, crumpled, thrown about everywhere, made\r\nyou think of a nation of women who had disrobed themselves there;\r\nwhilst down below, in the depths of the establishment, the delivery\r\ndepartment, now in full activity, was still and ever disgorging the\r\nparcels which filled it to suffocation and which were carried off by\r\nthe vans, in a last effort of the overheated machine. But it was on\r\nthe silk department especially that the customers had flung themselves\r\nwith the greatest ardour. There they had cleared off everything, there\r\nwas abundant room to pass, the hall was bare; the whole of the colossal\r\nstock of Paris Delight had been cut up and carried away, as if by a\r\nswarm of devouring locusts. And in the midst of this great void, Hutin\r\nand Favier were running through the counterfoils of their debit-notes,\r\ncalculating their commission, and still short of breath from the\r\nstruggle. Favier, it turned out, had made fifteen francs while Hutin\r\nhad only managed to make thirteen; he had been thoroughly beaten that\r\nday, and was enraged at his bad luck. The eyes of both sparkled with\r\nthe passion for gain. And all around them other shopmen were likewise\r\nadding up figures, glowing with the same fever, in the brutal gaiety\r\nwhich follows victorious carnage.\r\n\r\n"Well, Bourdoncle!" cried out Mouret, "are you trembling still?"\r\n\r\nHe had returned to his favourite position against the balustrade, at\r\nthe top of the stairs, and, in presence of the massacre of stuffs\r\nspread out below him, he indulged in a victorious laugh. His fears of\r\nthe morning, that moment of unpardonable weakness which nobody would\r\never know of, inspired him with a greater desire to triumph. The battle\r\nwas definitely won, the small tradespeople of the neighbourhood were\r\ndone for, and Baron Hartmann was conquered, with his millions and his\r\nbuilding sites. Whilst Mouret gazed at the cashiers bending over their\r\nledgers, adding up long columns of figures, whilst he listened to the\r\nsound of the gold, falling from their fingers into the metal bowls, he\r\nalready beheld The Ladies\' Paradise growing and growing, enlarging its\r\nhall and prolonging its galleries as far as the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre.\r\n\r\n"And now," he resumed, "are you not convinced, Bourdoncle, that the\r\nhouse is really too small? We could have sold twice as much."\r\n\r\nBourdoncle humbled himself, enraptured, moreover, to find himself\r\nin the wrong. But another spectacle rendered them grave. As was the\r\ncustom every evening, Lhomme, the chief sales\' cashier, had just\r\ncollected the receipts from each pay-desk; and after adding them up,\r\nhe wrote the total amount on a paper which he displayed by hanging it\r\non the iron claw with which the stump of his mutilated arm, severed\r\nat the elbow, was provided. And then he took the receipts up to the\r\nchief cash office, some in a leather case and some in bags, according\r\nto the nature of the specie. On this occasion the gold and silver\r\npredominated, and he slowly walked upstairs carrying three enormous\r\nbags, which he clasped with his one arm against his breast, holding one\r\nof them with his chin in order to prevent it from slipping. His heavy\r\nbreathing could be heard at a distance as he passed along, staggering\r\nand superb, amidst the respectful shopmen.\r\n\r\n"How much, Lhomme?" asked Mouret.\r\n\r\n"Eighty thousand seven hundred and forty-two francs ten centimes,"\r\nreplied the cashier.\r\n\r\nA joyous laugh stirred up The Ladies\' Paradise. The amount ran through\r\nthe establishment. It was the highest figure ever attained in one day\'s\r\nsales by a draper\'s shop.\r\n\r\nThat evening, when Denise went up to bed, she felt so faint that she\r\nwas obliged to lean against the partition in the corridor under the\r\nzinc roof. And when she was inside her room, with the door closed, she\r\nfell down on the bed; her feet pained her so much. For a long time she\r\ncontinued gazing with a stupid air at the dressing-table, the wardrobe,\r\nall the lodginghouse-like bareness. This, then, was where she was\r\ngoing to live; and her first day--an abominable, endless day--filled\r\nher with sore distress. She would never have the courage to go through\r\nsuch another. Then she perceived that she was dressed in silk; and\r\nthis uniform depressed her. She was childish enough, before unpacking\r\nher box, to put on her old woollen gown, which hung over the back of a\r\nchair. But when she had once more donned this poor garment a painful\r\nemotion choked her; the sobs which she had kept back all day suddenly\r\nfound vent in a flood of hot tears. She fell back on the bed, weeping\r\nat the thought of the two children, and she wept on and on, without\r\neven the strength to take off her boots, so completely was she overcome\r\nwith fatigue and grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Denise had scarcely been downstairs half an hour, when\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie said to her in her sharp voice: "You are wanted at the\r\ndirector\'s office, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\nThe girl found Mouret alone, in his spacious room hung with green rep.\r\nHe had suddenly remembered that "unkempt girl," as Bourdoncle called\r\nher; and he, who usually detested the part of fault-finder, had thought\r\nof sending for her and stirring her up a bit, if she were still dressed\r\nin the style of a country wench. On the previous day, despite his\r\njocularity, he had experienced a feeling of wounded pride, on seeing\r\nthe elegance of one of his saleswomen questioned in Madame Desforges\'s\r\npresence. He harboured a mixed sentiment with regard to Denise, a\r\ncommingling, as it were, of sympathy and anger.\r\n\r\n"We engaged you, mademoiselle," he commenced, "out of regard for your\r\nuncle, and you must not put us under the sad necessity----"\r\n\r\nBut all at once he stopped. On the other side of his table stood\r\nDenise, upright, serious, and pale. Her silk gown was no longer too\r\nbig for her, but fitted tightly to her pretty figure, displayed the\r\npure lines of her virgin shoulders; and if her hair, knotted in thick\r\ntresses, still appeared somewhat wild, she had at least tried to keep\r\nit in order. After falling asleep with her clothes on, her eyes red\r\nwith weeping, she had, on waking at about four o\'clock, felt ashamed of\r\nher nervous sensibility, and had immediately set about taking-in her\r\ndress; besides spending an hour before the tiny looking-glass, combing\r\nher hair, which she was unable to reduce as much as she would have\r\nliked to.\r\n\r\n"Ah! thank heavens!" said Mouret, "you look better this morning. But\r\nthere\'s still that dreadful hair!" With these words he rose from his\r\nseat and stepped up to her to try and smooth her rebellious tresses in\r\nthe same familiar way as Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie on the previous day. "There!\r\nJust tuck that in behind your ear," he said, "The chignon is too high."\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, but let him arrange her hair. In spite of her vow\r\nto be strong and brave she had reached the office full of misgivings,\r\nfeeling certain that she had been summoned to be informed of her\r\ndismissal. And Mouret\'s evident kindliness did not reassure her; she\r\nwas still afraid of him, feeling whenever near him that uneasiness\r\nwhich she attributed to natural anxiety in the presence of a powerful\r\nman on whom her future depended. And when he saw her thus trembling\r\nunder his hands, which were grazing her neck, he began to regret his\r\ngood-natured impulse, for he feared above all to lose his authority.\r\n\r\n"In short, mademoiselle," he resumed, once more placing the table\r\nbetween himself and her, "try and look to your appearance. You are no\r\nlonger at Valognes; study our Parisian young ladies. If your uncle\'s\r\nname has sufficed to gain you admittance to our house, I at least\r\ntrust that you will seek to justify the good opinion I formed of you\r\nfrom your appearance. Unfortunately, everybody here is not of the same\r\nopinion as myself. Let this be a warning to you. Don\'t make me tell a\r\nfalsehood."\r\n\r\nHe treated her like a child, with more pity than kindness, his\r\ncuriosity simply awakened by the troublous, womanly charm which he\r\ndivined was springing up in this poor awkward girl. And she, whilst he\r\nwas lecturing her, having suddenly perceived the portrait of Madame\r\nH\xc3\xa9douin, whose handsome regular face was smiling gravely in its gold\r\nframe--felt herself shivering again, despite the encouraging words he\r\naddressed to her. That was the dead lady, she whom people accused him\r\nof having killed, in order to found the house with the blood of her\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\nMouret was still speaking. "Now you may go," he said at last, sitting\r\ndown and taking up his pen. And thereupon she went off, heaving a deep\r\nsigh of relief.\r\n\r\nFrom that day onward, Denise put forth all her courage. Beneath her\r\nattacks of sensitiveness, a strong sense of reason was constantly\r\nworking, quite a feeling of bravery at finding herself weak and alone,\r\nwith a cheerful determination to carry out her self-imposed task. She\r\nmade very little stir but went straight ahead to her goal, overcoming\r\nall obstacles, and that simply and naturally, for her nature was one of\r\nunconquerable sweetness.\r\n\r\nAt first she had to surmount the terrible fatigues of her work in the\r\ndepartment. The piles of garments strained her arms to such a degree\r\nthat during the first six weeks she cried with pain when she turned\r\nover at night, her back aching and her shoulders bruised. But she\r\nsuffered still more from her shoes, heavy shoes which she had brought\r\nfrom Valognes; lack of money preventing her from replacing them by\r\nlight boots. Always on her legs, trotting about from morning to night,\r\nscolded if she were seen leaning for a moment against a partition,\r\nher feet, small like those of a child, became swollen by prolonged\r\nimprisonment in those torturing bluchers; the heels throbbed with fever\r\nand the soles were covered with blisters, the skin of which chafed off\r\nand stuck to her stockings. She experienced, too, a shattering of her\r\nwhole frame; the constant weariness of her legs painfully affected her\r\nsystem and her face was ever pale. And yet she, so spare and frail,\r\nresisted courageously, whilst a great many other saleswomen, attacked\r\nby special maladies, were obliged to quit the business. Her readiness\r\nto suffer, her valiant stubbornness sustained her, smiling and upright,\r\nhowever, even when she felt ready to give way, thoroughly worn out by\r\nlabour to which many men would have succumbed.\r\n\r\nAnother torment was to have the whole department against her. To\r\nphysical martyrdom was added the secret persecutions of her comrades.\r\nTwo months of patience and gentleness had not disarmed them. She was\r\nconstantly exposed to offensive remarks, cruel inventions, a series of\r\nslights which cut her to the heart, in her longing for affection. For\r\na long time the others joked over her unfortunate first appearance;\r\nand such nicknames as "clogs" and "numbskull" were bestowed on her.\r\nThen those who missed a sale were advised to go to Valognes; in\r\nshort, she passed for the fool of the place. And afterwards when she\r\nrevealed herself to be a remarkably clever saleswoman, well up in the\r\nmechanism of the house, the others conspired to deprive her of all\r\ngood customers. Marguerite and Clara pursued her with instinctive\r\nhatred, allying themselves together in order that they might not be\r\nswallowed up by this new-comer, whom they really feared in spite of\r\ntheir affected disdain. As for Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, she was hurt by the\r\nproud reserve displayed by Denise, who did not hover round her skirts\r\nwith an air of caressing admiration; and she therefore abandoned her\r\nto the rancour of her favourites, the preferred ones of her court, who\r\nwere always on their knees, feeding her with the continual flattery\r\nwhich could alone impart any amiability to her proud domineering\r\nnature. For a while, the second-hand, Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric, appeared not to\r\nenter into the conspiracy, but this must have been by inadvertence, for\r\nshe showed herself equally harsh directly she saw to what annoyances\r\nher good-nature was likely to expose her. Then the abandonment became\r\ncomplete, they all made a butt of the "unkempt girl," who lived on in\r\nan hourly struggle, only managing by dint of the greatest courage to\r\nhold her own in the department.\r\n\r\nSuch then was her life now. She had to smile, look brave and gracious\r\nin a silk gown which did not belong to her, and she was ever suffering\r\nfrom fatigue, badly treated, under the continual menace of a brutal\r\ndismissal. Her room was her only refuge, the only spot where she\r\ncould indulge in the luxury of a cry, when she had suffered too much\r\nduring the day. But a terrible coldness fell from the zinc roof, now\r\ncovered with the December snow; she was obliged to nestle in her iron\r\nbedstead, pile all her clothes over her, and weep under the counterpane\r\nto prevent the frost from chapping her face. Mouret never spoke to her\r\nnow; when she noticed Bourdoncle\'s severe looks during business hours\r\nshe trembled, for she divined in him a born enemy who would not forgive\r\nher the slightest fault. And amidst this general hostility, inspector\r\nJouve\'s strange friendliness astonished her. If he met her in any\r\nout-of-the-way corner he smiled at her and made some amiable remark;\r\ntwice, too, he had saved her from being reprimanded without any show of\r\ngratitude on her part, for she was more troubled than touched by his\r\nprotecting airs.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after dinner, while the young ladies were setting the\r\ncupboards in order, Joseph came to inform Denise that a young man\r\nwanted her below. She went down, feeling very anxious.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" said Clara, "the \'unkempt girl\' has got a follower then."\r\n\r\n"He must be hard up for a sweetheart," declared Marguerite.\r\n\r\nMeantime, downstairs at the door, Denise found her brother Jean. She\r\nhad formally prohibited him from coming to the shop in this way, as it\r\nlooked so bad. But she did not dare to scold him, so excited did he\r\nappear, bareheaded, out of breath through running all the way from the\r\nFaubourg du Temple.\r\n\r\n"Have you got ten francs?" he stammered. "Give me ten francs, or I\'m a\r\nlost man."\r\n\r\nWith his flowing locks and handsome girlish face the young rascal\r\nlooked so comical, whilst launching out this melodramatic phrase,\r\nthat she could have smiled had it not been for the anguish which his\r\napplication for money caused her.\r\n\r\n"What! ten francs?" she murmured. "Whatever\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nThereupon he blushed, and explained that he had met a friend\'s sister.\r\nDenise stopped him, feeling embarrassed and not wishing to know any\r\nmore about it. Twice already had he rushed in to obtain similar loans,\r\nbut on the first occasion it had only been a matter of twenty-five\r\nsous, and on the next of thirty. He was, however, always getting into\r\nbad company.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t give you ten francs," she resumed. "P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board isn\'t paid\r\nyet, and I\'ve only just the money for it. I shall have hardly enough\r\nto buy a pair of boots, which I want very badly. You are really not\r\nreasonable, Jean. It\'s too bad of you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m lost," he repeated, with a tragical gesture. "Just listen,\r\nlittle sister; she\'s a tall, dark girl; we went to the caf\xc3\xa9 with her\r\nbrother. I never thought the drinks would----"\r\n\r\nShe had to interrupt him again, and as tears were coming into his eyes,\r\nshe took out her purse and slipped a ten-franc piece into his hand. He\r\nat once set up a laugh.\r\n\r\n"I was sure of it!--But on my honour! never again! A fellow would have\r\nto be a regular scamp."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he ran off, after kissing his sister, like a madman. The\r\nassistants in the shop seemed quite astonished.\r\n\r\nThat night Denise did not sleep much. Since her entry into The\r\nLadies\' Paradise, money had been her cruel anxiety. She was still\r\na probationer, without a salary; the other girls in her department\r\nfrequently prevented her from selling, and she only just managed to\r\npay P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board and lodging, thanks to the unimportant customers they\r\nwere good enough to leave her. It was a time of black misery--misery\r\nin a silk dress. She was often obliged to spend the night in repairing\r\nher small stock of clothes, darning her linen, mending her chemises\r\nas if they had been lace; without mentioning the patches that she put\r\non her shoes, as cleverly as any bootmaker could have done. She even\r\nrisked washing things in her hand basin. But her old woollen dress was\r\nan especial source of anxiety to her; she had no other, and was forced\r\nto put it on every evening when she quitted the uniform silk, and this\r\nwore it terribly; a stain on it gave her quite a fever, the least rent\r\nwas a catastrophe. And she had nothing, not a sou, not even enough to\r\nbuy the trifling articles which a woman always wants; she had even been\r\nobliged to wait a fortnight to renew her stock of needles and cotton.\r\nThus it was a real disaster when Jean, with his love affairs, suddenly\r\nswooped down and pillaged her purse. A franc-piece taken out of it left\r\nan abyss which she did not know how to fill up. As for finding ten\r\nfrancs on the morrow it was not to be thought of for a moment. All that\r\nnight she was haunted by nightmare in which she saw P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 thrown into\r\nthe street, whilst she turned the paving stones over with her bruised\r\nfingers to see if there might not be some money underneath them.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the next day she had to play the part of the\r\nwell-dressed girl. Some well-known customers came in, and Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie summoned her several times in order that she might show off\r\nthe new styles. And whilst she was posing there, with the stereotyped\r\ngraces of a fashion-plate, she thought all the time of P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board and\r\nlodging, which she had promised to pay that evening. She would contrive\r\nto do without any boots for another month; but even on adding the\r\nthirty francs left her of P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s money to the four francs which she had\r\nsaved up sou by sou, there would never be more than thirty-four francs,\r\nand where was she to find six francs to complete the sum she required?\r\nIt was an anguish in which her heart failed her.\r\n\r\n"You will notice that the shoulders are quite free," Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie was\r\nsaying. "It\'s very fashionable and very convenient. The young person\r\ncan fold her arms."\r\n\r\n"Oh! easily," replied Denise, who continued to smile amiably. "One\r\ncan\'t feel it. I am sure you will like it, madame."\r\n\r\nShe was now blaming herself for having gone to fetch P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 from\r\nMadame Gras\' on the previous Sunday, to take him for a walk in the\r\nChamps-Elys\xc3\xa9es. The poor child so seldom went out with her! But she had\r\nbeen obliged to buy him some gingerbread and a little spade, and then\r\ntake him to see Punch and Judy, and all that had cost twenty-nine sous.\r\nReally Jean could not think much about the little one, or he would not\r\nbe so foolish. Everything fell upon her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Of course, if it does not suit you, madame--" resumed the first-hand.\r\n"Just put this other cloak on, mademoiselle, so that the lady may\r\njudge."\r\n\r\nAnd Denise then walked slowly round, wearing the cloak and saying:\r\n"This is warmer. It\'s this year\'s fashion."\r\n\r\nAnd beneath her professional graces she continued worrying and worrying\r\nuntil the evening, at a loss as to where she might find this money. The\r\nyoung ladies, who were very busy, left her an important sale; but it\r\nwas only Tuesday, and she must wait four days before drawing any cash.\r\nAfter dinner she decided to postpone her visit to Madame Gras till\r\nthe morrow. She would excuse herself, say she had been detained, and\r\nbefore then she would perhaps have obtained the six francs. As Denise\r\navoided the slightest expense, she went to bed early. What could she do\r\nout-of-doors, penniless and wild, and still frightened by the big city\r\nin which she only knew the streets around the shop? After venturing\r\nas far as the Palais-Royal for the sake of a little fresh air, she\r\nwould quickly return, lock herself in her room and set about sewing or\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\nAlong the corridor conducting to the bed-rooms reigned a barrack-like\r\npromiscuity--the girls, who were often not very tidy, would gossip\r\nthere over dirty water and dirty linen, break into frequent quarrels\r\nand patch up continual reconciliations. They were prohibited from\r\ngoing up to their rooms in the day-time; they did not live there, but\r\nmerely slept there at night, climbing the stairs only at the last\r\nminute, and coming down again in the morning when still half asleep,\r\nhardly awakened by a rapid wash; and this hurry-skurry which night and\r\nmorning swept through the corridor, the fatigue of thirteen hours\'\r\nwork which threw them all on their beds thoroughly worn out, made the\r\nupper part of the house like an inn traversed by tired and illtempered\r\ntravellers. Denise had no friend. Of all the young ladies, one alone,\r\nPauline Cugnot, showed her a little affection; and the mantle and\r\nunder-clothing departments being close to one another, and in open war,\r\nthe sympathy between the two saleswomen had hitherto been confined\r\nto a few rare words hastily exchanged. Pauline certainly occupied a\r\nneighbouring room, to the right of Denise\'s; but as she disappeared\r\nimmediately after dinner and only returned at eleven o\'clock, the\r\nlatter simply heard her get into bed, and never met her after business\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThat evening, Denise had made up her mind to play the part of bootmaker\r\nonce more. She was holding her shoes, turning them about and wondering\r\nhow she could make them last another month. At last she decided to take\r\na strong needle and sew on the soles, which were threatening to leave\r\nthe uppers. Meantime a collar and a pair of cuffs were soaking in a\r\nbasinful of soapsuds.\r\n\r\nEvery evening she heard the same sounds, the girls coming up one by\r\none, brief whispered conversations, bursts of laughter and sometimes\r\ndisputes which they stifled as much as possible. Then the beds creaked,\r\nthe tired occupants yawned, and fell into heavy slumber. Denise\'s left\r\nhand neighbour often talked in her sleep, which at first frightened\r\nher very much. Perhaps others, like herself, stopped up to mend their\r\nthings, in spite of the regulations; but if so they probably took the\r\nsame precautions as she did, moving with prudent care, and avoiding the\r\nleast noise, for a quivering silence prevailed behind the closed doors.\r\n\r\nIt had struck eleven some ten minutes previously when a sound of\r\nfootsteps made Denise raise her head. Another young lady late, thought\r\nshe. And she realised that it was Pauline, by hearing the door next to\r\nher own open.\r\n\r\nBut she was astonished when Pauline quietly came back into the passage\r\nand knocked at her door.\r\n\r\n"Make haste, it\'s me!"\r\n\r\nThe saleswomen were forbidden to visit each other in their rooms, and\r\nDenise quickly unlocked her door, in order that her neighbour might\r\nnot be caught by Madame Cabin, who was supposed to see this regulation\r\nstrictly carried out.\r\n\r\n"Was she there?" asked Denise, when the other had entered.\r\n\r\n"Who? Madame Cabin?" replied Pauline. "Oh, I\'m not afraid of her,\r\nshe\'s easily settled with a five-franc piece!" And then she added:\r\n"I\'ve wanted to have a talk with you for a long time past. But it\'s\r\nimpossible to do so downstairs. Besides, you looked so down-hearted\r\nto-night at table."\r\n\r\nDenise thanked her, and, touched by her good-natured air invited her\r\nto sit down. But in the bewilderment, caused by this unexpected visit\r\nshe had not laid down the shoe she was mending, and Pauline at once\r\nperceived it. She shook her head, looked round and espied the collar\r\nand cuffs in the basin.\r\n\r\n"My poor child, I thought as much," resumed she. "Ah, I know what it\r\nis! When I first came up from Chartres, and old Cugnot didn\'t send me a\r\nsou, I many a time washed my own chemises! Yes, yes, my chemises! I had\r\nonly two, and there was always one in soak."\r\n\r\nShe sat down, still out of breath from running. Her broad face,\r\nwith small bright eyes, and big tender mouth, possessed a certain\r\ngrace, notwithstanding its rather coarse features. And, without any\r\ntransition, all of a sudden, she began to relate her story; her\r\nchildhood at the mill; old Cugnot ruined by a law-suit; she sent to\r\nParis to make her fortune with twenty francs in her pocket; then her\r\nstart as a saleswoman in a shop at Batignolles, then at The Ladies\'\r\nParadise--a terrible start, every suffering and privation imaginable;\r\nand at last her present life, the two hundred francs she earned each\r\nmonth, the pleasures she indulged in, the carelessness in which\r\nshe allowed her days to glide away. Some jewellery, a brooch, and\r\nwatch-chain, glistened on her close-fitting gown of dark-blue cloth;\r\nand she smiled from under a velvet toque ornamented with a large grey\r\nfeather.\r\n\r\nDenise had turned very red, worried with reference to her shoe; and\r\nbegan to stammer out an explanation.\r\n\r\n"But the same thing happened to me," repeated Pauline. "Come, come, I\'m\r\nolder than you, I\'m over twenty-six, though I don\'t look it. Just tell\r\nme your little troubles."\r\n\r\nThereupon Denise yielded to this friendship so frankly offered. She\r\nsat down in her petticoat, with an old shawl over her shoulders, near\r\nPauline in full dress; and an interesting gossip ensued.\r\n\r\nIt was freezing in the room, the cold seemed to run down the\r\nbare prison-like walls; but they were so fully taken up by their\r\nconversation that they did not notice that their fingers were almost\r\nfrost-bitten. Little by little, Denise opened her heart entirely, spoke\r\nof Jean and P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, and of how grievously the money question tortured\r\nher; which led them both to abuse the young ladies in the mantle\r\ndepartment. Pauline relieved her mind. "Oh, the hussies!" said she, "if\r\nthey treated you in a proper way, you might make more than a hundred\r\nfrancs a month."\r\n\r\n"Everybody is down on me, and I\'m sure I don\'t know why," answered\r\nDenise, beginning to cry. "Look at Monsieur Bourdoncle, he\'s always\r\nwatching me, trying to find me in fault just as if I were in his way.\r\nOld Jouve is about the only one----"\r\n\r\nThe other interrupted her. "What, that old ape of an inspector! Ah! my\r\ndear, don\'t you trust him. He may display his decoration as much as\r\nhe likes, but there\'s a story about something that happened to him in\r\nour department. But what a child you are to grieve like this! What a\r\nmisfortune it is to be so sensitive! Of course, what is happening to\r\nyou happens to every one; they are making you pay your footing."\r\n\r\nThen carried away by her good heart she caught hold of Denise\'s hands\r\nand kissed her. The money-question was a graver one. Certainly a poor\r\ngirl could not support her two brothers, pay the little one\'s board\r\nand lodging, and stand treat for the big one\'s sweethearts with the\r\nfew paltry sous she picked up from the others\' cast-off customers; for\r\nit was to be feared that she would not get any salary until business\r\nimproved in March.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, it\'s impossible for you to live in this way any longer.\r\nIf I were you----" said Pauline.\r\n\r\nBut a noise in the corridor stopped her. It was probably Marguerite,\r\nwho was accused of prowling about at night to spy upon the others.\r\nPauline, who was still pressing her friend\'s hand, looked at her for\r\na moment in silence, listening. Then, with an air of affectionate\r\nconviction, she began to whisper to her.\r\n\r\nDenise did not understand at first, and when she did, she withdrew her\r\nhands, looking very confused by what her friend had told her. "Oh! no,"\r\nshe replied simply.\r\n\r\n"Then," continued Pauline, "you\'ll never manage, I tell you so,\r\nplainly. Here are the figures: forty francs for the little one, a\r\nfive-franc piece now and again for the big one; and then there\'s\r\nyourself, you can\'t always go about dressed like a pauper, with shoes\r\nthat make the other girls laugh at you; yes, really, your shoes do you\r\na deal of harm. It would be much better to do as I tell you."\r\n\r\n"No, no," repeated Denise.\r\n\r\n"Well! you are very foolish. It\'s inevitable, my dear, we all come to\r\nit sooner or later. Look at me, I was a probationer, like you, without\r\na sou. We are boarded and lodged, it\'s true; but there\'s our dress;\r\nbesides, it\'s impossible to go without a copper in one\'s pocket and\r\nshut oneself up in one\'s room, watching the flies. So you see girls\r\nforcibly drift into it."\r\n\r\nShe then spoke of her first admirer, a lawyer\'s clerk whom she had\r\nmet at a party at Meudon. After him, had come a post-office clerk.\r\nAnd, finally, ever since the autumn, she had been keeping company with\r\na salesman at the Bon March\xc3\xa9, a very nice tall fellow. However, her\r\nadvice had no effect whatever upon Denise.\r\n\r\n"No," the latter replied in a tone of decision; and a fresh silence\r\nfell. In the small cold room they were smiling at each other, greatly\r\naffected by this whispered conversation. "Besides, one must have\r\naffection for some one," she resumed, her cheeks quite scarlet.\r\n\r\nPauline was astonished. She set up a laugh, and embraced her a second\r\ntime exclaiming: "But, my darling, when you meet and like each other!\r\nYou are really droll! Look here, would you like Baug\xc3\xa9 to take us\r\nsomewhere in the country on Sunday? He\'ll bring one of his friends."\r\n\r\n"No," again said Denise in her gently obstinate way.\r\n\r\nThen Pauline insisted no further. Each was free to act as she pleased.\r\nWhat she had said was out of pure kindness of heart, for she felt\r\nreally grieved to see a comrade so miserable. And as it was nearly\r\nmidnight, she got up to leave. But before doing so she forced Denise to\r\naccept the six francs she wanted to make up P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board-money, begging\r\nher not to trouble about the matter, but to repay her the amount\r\nwhenever she earned more.\r\n\r\n"Now," she added, "blow your candle out, so that they may not see which\r\ndoor opens; you can light it again immediately afterwards."\r\n\r\nThe candle having been extinguished, they shook hands; and then Pauline\r\nran off to her room, giving no sign of her passage through the darkness\r\nsave the vague rustling of her petticoats amidst the deep slumber that\r\nhad fallen on the occupants of the other little rooms.\r\n\r\nBefore going to bed Denise wished to finish her boot and do her\r\nwashing. The cold became sharper still as the night advanced; but\r\nshe did not feel it, the conversation had stirred her heart\'s blood.\r\nShe was not shocked; it seemed to her that every woman had a right\r\nto arrange her life as she liked, when she was alone and free in the\r\nworld. For her own part, however, she had never given way to such\r\nideas; her sense of right and her healthy nature naturally maintained\r\nher in the respectability in which she had always lived. At last,\r\ntowards one o\'clock she went to bed. No, she thought, she did not\r\nlove any one. So what was the use of upsetting her life, the maternal\r\ndevotion which she had vowed for her two brothers? However, she did not\r\nsleep; insomnia gained upon her and a crowd of indistinct forms flitted\r\nbefore her closed eyes, then vanished in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward Denise took an interest in the love-stories of\r\nthe department. During slack times the girls were constantly occupied\r\nwith their amatory affairs. Gossiping tales flew about, stories of\r\nadventures which amused them all for a week. Clara was a scandal and\r\nmerely remained at the shop under pretence of leading a respectable\r\nlife in order to shield herself from her family; for she was mortally\r\nafraid of old Prunaire, who had threatened to come to Paris and\r\nbreak her arms and legs with his clogs. Marguerite, on the contrary,\r\nbehaved very well, and was not known to have any lover; which caused\r\nsome surprise, for all knew of the circumstances which had led to her\r\narrival in Paris. The young women also joked about Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric,\r\ndeclaring that she was discreetly connected with certain great\r\npersonages; but the truth was they knew nothing of her love-affairs;\r\nfor she disappeared every evening, stiff as starch with her widow\'s\r\nsulkiness, and apparently always in a great hurry, though nobody\r\nknew whither she hastened so eagerly. As for the tittle-tattle about\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie this was certainly false; mere invention, spread abroad\r\nby discontented saleswomen just for fun. Perhaps she had formerly\r\ndisplayed rather more than a motherly feeling for one of her son\'s\r\nfriends, but she now occupied too high a position in the business to\r\nindulge in such childishness. Then there was the flock, the crowd of\r\nthe girls going off in the evening, nine out of every ten having young\r\nmen waiting for them at the door. On the Place Gaillon, along the Rue\r\nde la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, and the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, there was always a\r\ntroop of motionless sentries watching for the girls\' departure; and,\r\nwhen the _d\xc3\xa9fil\xc3\xa9_ began, each gave his arm to his lady and walked\r\naway. It was like the stage-door exit of some theatre where figurantes\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nWhat most troubled Denise, however, was that she had discovered\r\nColomban\'s secret. He was continually to be seen on the other side of\r\nthe street, on the threshold of The Old Elbeuf, his eyes raised and\r\nnever quitting the young ladies of the jacket and mantle department.\r\nWhen he espied Denise watching him he blushed and turned away his head,\r\nas if afraid that she might betray him to Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, although there\r\nhad been no further connection between the Baudus and their niece\r\nsince her engagement at The Ladies\' Paradise. At first, on seeing his\r\ndespairing airs, she had fancied that he was in love with Marguerite,\r\nfor Marguerite, being very well-conducted, and sleeping in the house,\r\nwas not easy to approach. But great was her astonishment to find that\r\nColomban\'s ardent glances were intended for Clara. For months past he\r\nhad been devoured by passion in this way, remaining on the other side\r\nof the street and lacking the courage to declare himself; and this for\r\na girl who was perfectly free, who lived in the Rue Louis-le-Grand,\r\nand whom he could have spoken to any evening! Clara herself appeared\r\nto have no idea of her conquest. Denise\'s discovery filled her with\r\npainful emotion. Was love so idiotic then? What! this fellow, who had\r\nreal happiness within his reach, was ruining his life for the sake of\r\nthat good-for-nothing girl whom he adored as reverently as if she had\r\nbeen a saint! From that day forward she felt a heart pang each time she\r\nespied Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s pale suffering face behind the greeny panes of The\r\nOld Elbeuf.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Denise could not help thinking a great deal, on seeing\r\nthe young ladies march off with their sweethearts. She was sometimes\r\nobliged to reply by a smile to a friendly nod from Pauline, for whom\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9 waited regularly every evening at half-past eight, beside the\r\nfountain on the Place Gaillon. Then, after going out the last and\r\ntaking a furtive walk, always alone, she was invariably the first\r\nto return, going upstairs to work, or to sleep, her head full of\r\ndreams, inquisitive as to the outdoor life of the others, of which she\r\nknew nothing. She certainly did not envy them, she was happy in her\r\nsolitude, in the unsociableness in which she shut herself up, as in a\r\nhiding-place; but all the same her imagination carried her away, she\r\nwould try to guess things, picture the pleasures constantly described\r\nbefore her, the caf\xc3\xa9s, the restaurants, the theatres, the Sundays spent\r\non the river and in the country taverns. Quite a weariness of mind, a\r\ndesire mingled with lassitude resulted from these imaginings; and she\r\nseemed to have already had her fill of amusements which she had never\r\ntasted.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was but little room for dangerous dreams in her daily\r\nworking life. During the thirteen hours of hard toil in the shop,\r\nthere was no time for any display of affection between the salesmen\r\nand the saleswomen. If the continual fight for money had not abolished\r\nall sexual difference, the unceasing press of business which occupied\r\ntheir minds and fatigued their bodies would have sufficed to stifle\r\ndesire. But very few love-affairs had been known in the establishment\r\namidst the various hostilities and friendships between the men and\r\nthe women, the constant elbowing from department to department. They\r\nwere all nothing but pieces of mechanism forced to contribute of the\r\nworking of the immense machine, abdicating all individuality and simply\r\ncontributing their strength to the total, commonplace, phalansterian\r\npower. It was only outside the shop that they resumed their individual\r\nlives, with a sudden flaming of awakened passion.\r\n\r\nDenise, however, one day saw Albert Lhomme slip a note into the hand\r\nof a young lady in the under-clothing department, after several times\r\npassing by with an air of indifference. The dead season, which lasts\r\nfrom December to February, was commencing; and she now had periods of\r\nrest, hours spent on her feet with her eyes wandering all over the\r\nshop whilst waiting for customers. The young ladies of her department\r\nwere especially friendly with the salesmen who served the lace, but\r\ntheir intimacy never seemed to go any further than whispered banter.\r\nIn the lace department there was a second-hand, a gay young spark who\r\npursued Clara with all sorts of suggestive stories, simply by way of\r\na joke--for he really cared so little for her that he made no effort\r\nto meet her out of doors; and thus it was from counter to counter, the\r\ngentlemen and the young ladies would exchange winks, nods, and remarks,\r\nwhich they alone understood. At times with their backs half turned and\r\na dreamy look on their faces in order to put the terrible Bourdoncle\r\noff the scent, they would indulge in some sly gossip. As for Deloche,\r\nhe long contented himself with smiling at Denise when he met her; but,\r\ngetting bolder, he at last occasionally murmured a friendly word. On\r\nthe day she had noticed Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s son giving a note to the young\r\nlady in the under-linen department, it precisely happened that Deloche\r\nwas asking her if she had enjoyed her lunch, feeling a desire to say\r\nsomething, and unable to think of anything more amiable. He also saw\r\nthe billet pass; and as he glanced at the young girl, they both blushed\r\nat thought of this intrigue carried on under their eyes.\r\n\r\nBut despite all these occurrences which gradually awoke the woman in\r\nher, Denise still retained her infantile peace of mind. The one thing\r\nthat stirred her heart was to meet Hutin. But even this was only\r\ngratitude in her eyes; she simply thought herself touched by the young\r\nman\'s politeness. He could not bring a customer to the department\r\nwithout making her feel quite confused. Several times, on returning\r\nfrom a pay-desk, she found herself making a _d\xc3\xa9tour_, and traversing\r\nthe silk hall though she had no business there, her bosom heaving the\r\nwhile with emotion. One afternoon she met Mouret there and he seemed\r\nto follow her with a smile. He paid scarcely any attention to her now,\r\nonly addressing a few words to her from time to time, to give her a few\r\nhints about her toilet, and to joke with her, as an impossible girl, a\r\nlittle savage, almost a boy, whom he would never manage to transform\r\ninto a coquette, notwithstanding all his knowledge of women. Sometimes\r\nindeed he even ventured to laugh at her and tease her, without caring\r\nto acknowledge to himself the troublous feeling, the charm which this\r\nlittle saleswoman, with such a comical head of hair, inspired in\r\nhim. And that afternoon at sight of his mute smile, Denise trembled,\r\nas if she were in fault. Did he know why she was crossing the silk\r\ndepartment, when she could not herself have explained what had impelled\r\nher to make such a _d\xc3\xa9tour_?\r\n\r\nHutin, moreover, did not seem to be at all aware of the young girl\'s\r\ngrateful looks. The shop-girls were not his style, he affected to\r\ndespise them, boasting more than ever of his pretended adventures with\r\nthe lady customers.\r\n\r\nOne day a baroness had beamed on him, he would relate, and on another\r\noccasion he had fascinated the wife of an eminent architect. But as\r\na matter of fact his only conquests were among girls at caf\xc3\xa9s and\r\nmusic-halls. Like all young men in the drapery line, he had a mania for\r\nspending, battling throughout the week with a miser\'s greediness, with\r\nthe sole object of squandering his money on Sundays on the race-courses\r\nor in the restaurants and dancing-saloons. He never thought of saving\r\na penny, but spent his salary as soon as he drew it, absolutely\r\nindifferent about the future. Favier did not join him in these pleasure\r\nparties. Hutin and he, so friendly in the shop, bowed to each other\r\nat the door, where all further intercourse between them ceased. A\r\ngreat many of the shopmen, always side by side indoors, became perfect\r\nstrangers, ignorant of each other\'s lives, as soon as they set foot in\r\nthe streets. However, Hutin, had an intimate--Li\xc3\xa9nard of the woollen\r\ndepartment. Both lived in the same lodging-house, the H\xc3\xb4tel de Smyrne,\r\nin the Rue Sainte-Anne, a murky building entirely inhabited by shop\r\nassistants. In the morning they arrived at the Paradise together; and\r\nin the evening, the first who found himself free, after the folding\r\nwas done, waited for the other at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Saint-Roch, in the Rue\r\nSaint-Roch, a little place where many employees of The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nmet, brawling, drinking, and playing cards amidst the smoke of their\r\npipes. They often stopped there till one in the morning, until indeed\r\nthe tired landlord turned them out. For the last month, however,\r\nthey had been spending three evenings a week at a free-and-easy at\r\nMontmartre; whither they would take their friends in order to fan the\r\nsuccess of Mademoiselle Laure, a music-hall singer, Hutin\'s latest\r\nconquest, whose talent they applauded with such violent rapping of\r\ntheir walking-sticks and such clamorous shouts that on two occasions\r\nthe police had been obliged to interfere.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed in this way, and at last Denise obtained a fixed\r\nsalary of three hundred francs a-year. It was quite time she did so for\r\nher shoes were completely worn out. For the last month she had avoided\r\ngoing out, for fear of bursting them altogether.\r\n\r\n"What a noise you make with your shoes, mademoiselle!" Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nvery often remarked, with an irritated look. "It\'s intolerable. What\'s\r\nthe matter with your feet?"\r\n\r\nOn the day when Denise came down wearing a pair of cloth boots,\r\nwhich had cost her five francs, Marguerite and Clara expressed their\r\nastonishment in a kind of half whisper, so as to be heard. "Hullo! the\r\nunkempt one, has given up her goloshes," said the former.\r\n\r\n"Ah," retorted the other, "she must have cried over them. They were her\r\nmother\'s."\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, there was a general uprising against Denise. The\r\ngirls of her department had discovered her friendship with Pauline, and\r\nthought they detected a certain bravado in this display of affection\r\nfor a saleswoman of a rival counter. They spoke of treason, accused her\r\nof going and repeating their slightest words to their enemies. The war\r\nbetween the two departments became more violent than ever, it had never\r\nwaxed so warm; angry words were exchanged like cannon shots, and a slap\r\neven was given one evening behind some boxes of chemises. Possibly this\r\nlong-standing quarrel arose from the fact that the young ladies in the\r\nunder-linen department wore woollen gowns, whilst those of the mantles\r\nwore silk. In any case, the former spoke of their neighbours with the\r\nshocked air of respectable women; and facts proved that they were\r\nright, for it had been remarked that the silk dresses appeared to lead\r\nto dissolute habits among the young ladies who wore them. Clara was\r\ntaunted with her troop of lovers; even Marguerite had her child thrown\r\nin her teeth, as it were; whilst Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric was accused of all\r\nsorts of secret passions. And all this solely on account of Denise!\r\n\r\n"Now, young ladies, no ugly words; behave yourselves!" Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nwould say with her imperial air, amidst the rising passions of her\r\nlittle kingdom. "Show who you are."\r\n\r\nAt heart she preferred to remain neutral. As she confessed one day,\r\nwhen talking to Mouret, these girls were all about the same, one was\r\nno better than another. But she suddenly became impassioned when she\r\nlearnt from Bourdoncle that he had just caught her son downstairs\r\nkissing a young girl belonging to the under-linen department, the\r\nsaleswoman to whom he had passed several letters. It was abominable,\r\nand she roundly accused the under-linen department of having laid a\r\ntrap for Albert. Yes, it was a got-up affair against herself, they\r\nwere trying to dishonour her by ruining an inexperienced boy, after\r\nfinding it impossible to attack her department. Her only object however\r\nin making such a noise was to complicate the business, for she was\r\nwell aware of her son\'s character and knew him to be capable of all\r\nsorts of stupid things. For a time the matter threatened to assume a\r\nserious aspect; Mignot, the glove salesman, was mixed up in it. He\r\nwas a great friend of Albert\'s, and the rumour circulated that he\r\nfavoured the girls whom Albert sent him and who rummaged in his boxes\r\nfor hours together. There was also a story about some Su\xc3\xa8de kid gloves\r\ngiven to the saleswoman of the under-linen department, which was never\r\nproperly cleared up. At last the scandal was stifled out of regard for\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, whom Mouret himself treated with deference. Bourdoncle\r\ncontented himself a week later with dismissing, for some slight\r\noffence, the girl who had allowed herself to be kissed. At all events\r\nif the managers closed their eyes to the terrible doings of their\r\nemployees out of doors, they did not tolerate the least nonsense in the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Denise who suffered for all this. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, although\r\nperfectly well aware of what was going on, nourished a secret rancour\r\nagainst her; and seeing her laughing one evening with Pauline she also\r\ntook it for bravado, concluding that they were gossiping over her son\'s\r\nlove-affairs. And she thereupon sought to increase the girl\'s isolation\r\nin the department. For some time she had been thinking of inviting the\r\nyoung ladies to spend a Sunday at Les Rigolles near Rambouillet where\r\nshe had bought a country house with the first hundred thousand francs\r\nshe had saved; and she suddenly decided to do so; it would be a means\r\nof punishing Denise, of putting her openly on one side. She was the\r\nonly one not invited. For a fortnight in advance, nothing was talked of\r\nbut this pleasure party; the girls kept their eyes on the sky already\r\nwarmed by the May sunshine, and mapped out the whole day, looking\r\nforward to all sorts of pleasures: donkey-riding, milk and brown bread.\r\nAnd they were to be all women, which was more amusing still! As a rule,\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie killed her holidays like this, in going out with lady\r\nfriends; for she was so little accustomed to being at home, she always\r\nfelt so uncomfortable, so out of her element on the rare occasions\r\nwhen she could dine with her husband and son, that she preferred\r\neven not to avail herself of the opportunity but to go and dine at a\r\nrestaurant. Lhomme went his own way, enraptured to resume his bachelor\r\nexistence, and Albert, greatly relieved, hastened off to his beauties;\r\nso that, unaccustomed to home-life, feeling they were in each other\'s\r\nway, bored to death whenever they were together on a Sunday, they paid\r\nnothing more than flying visits to the house, as to some common hotel\r\nwhere people take a bed for the night. With respect to the excursion\r\nto Rambouillet, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie simply declared that considerations of\r\npropriety would not allow Albert to join them, and that the father\r\nhimself would display great tact by refusing to come; a declaration\r\nwhich enchanted both men. However, the happy day was drawing near, and\r\nthe girls chattered away more than ever, relating their preparations\r\nin the way of dress, just as if they were going on a six months\' tour,\r\nwhilst Denise had to listen to them, pale and silent in her abandonment.\r\n\r\n"Ah, they make you wild, don\'t they?" said Pauline to her one morning.\r\n"If I were you I would just catch them nicely! They are going to enjoy\r\nthemselves. I would enjoy myself too. Come with us on Sunday, Baug\xc3\xa9 is\r\ngoing to take me to Joinville."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks," said the girl with her quiet obstinacy.\r\n\r\n"But why not? Are you still afraid of being made love to?"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon Pauline laughed heartily. Denise also smiled. She\r\nknew how such things came about; it was always during some similar\r\nexcursions that the young ladies had made the acquaintance of their\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\n"Come," resumed Pauline, "I assure you that Baug\xc3\xa9 won\'t bring any one.\r\nWe shall be all by ourselves. As you don\'t want me to, I won\'t go and\r\nmarry you off, of course."\r\n\r\nDenise hesitated, tormented by such a strong desire to go that the\r\nblood rushed to her cheeks. Since the girls had been talking about\r\ntheir country pleasures she had felt stifled, overcome by a longing\r\nfor fresh air, dreaming of tall grass into which she might sink to the\r\nneck, and of giant trees whose shadows would flow over her like so\r\nmuch cooling water. Her childhood, spent amidst the rich verdure of Le\r\nCotentin, was awakening with a regret for sun and air.\r\n\r\n"Well! yes," said she at last.\r\n\r\nThen everything was soon arranged. Baug\xc3\xa9 was to come and fetch them at\r\neight o\'clock, on the Place Gaillon; whence they would take a cab to\r\nthe Vincennes Station. Denise, whose twenty-five francs a month was\r\nquickly exhausted by the children, had only been able to do up her old\r\nblack woollen dress by trimming it with some strips of check poplin;\r\nbut she had made herself a bonnet, by covering a shape with some silk\r\nand ornamenting it with blue ribbon. In this quiet attire she looked\r\nvery young, like an overgrown girl, displaying all the cleanliness\r\nof careful poverty, and somewhat shamefaced, and embarrassed by her\r\nluxuriant hair, which waved round the bareness of her bonnet. Pauline,\r\non the contrary, displayed a pretty spring costume in silk, striped\r\nwhite and violet, a feathered bonnet, with bows matching the dress,\r\nand jewels about her neck and rings on her fingers, which gave her\r\nthe appearance of a well-to-do tradesman\'s wife. It was like a Sunday\r\nrevenge on the woollen gown which she was obliged to wear throughout\r\nthe week in the shop; whereas Denise, who wore her uniform silk from\r\nMonday to Saturday, resumed, on Sundays, her thin woollen dress of\r\npoverty-stricken aspect.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Baug\xc3\xa9," said Pauline, pointing to a tall young man standing\r\nnear the fountain.\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she introduced her lover, and Denise felt at her ease\r\nat once, he seemed such a nice fellow. Big, and strong as an ox, with\r\na long Flemish face, in which his expressionless eyes twinkled with\r\ninfantile puerility, Baug\xc3\xa9 was the younger son of a grocer of Dunkerque\r\nand had come to Paris, almost driven from home by his father and\r\nbrother, who thought him a fearful dunce. However, he now made three\r\nthousand five hundred francs a year at the Bon March\xc3\xa9. Certainly in\r\nsome things he was rather stupid, but he proved a very good hand in the\r\nlinen department.\r\n\r\n"And the cab?" asked Pauline.\r\n\r\nThey had to go on foot as far as the Boulevard. The sun was already\r\nwarming the streets and the glorious May morning seemed to be smiling\r\non the pavements. There was not a cloud in the sky; all was gay in the\r\nblue air, transparent as crystal. An involuntary smile played about\r\nDenise\'s lips; she breathed freely; it seemed to her that her bosom\r\nwas throwing off a stifling fit of six months duration. At last she no\r\nlonger felt the stuffy air and the heavy stones of The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nweighing her down! She had the prospect of a long day in the country\r\nbefore her! and it was like a new lease of life, an infinite delight,\r\ninto which she entered with all the glee of a little child. However,\r\nwhen they were in the cab, she turned her eyes away, feeling ill at\r\nease as Pauline bent over to kiss her lover.\r\n\r\n"Oh, look!" said she, her head still at the window, "there\'s Monsieur\r\nLhomme. How he does walk!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s got his French horn," added Pauline, leaning out. "What an old\r\nfool he is! One would think he was running off to meet his girl!"\r\n\r\nLhomme, with his nose in the air, and his instrument under his arm,\r\nwas spinning along past the Gymnase Theatre, laughing with delight at\r\nthe thought of the treat in store for him. He was about to spend the\r\nday with a friend, a flautist at a petty theatre, in whose rooms a\r\nfew amateurs indulged in a little chamber-music on Sundays as soon as\r\nbreakfast was over.\r\n\r\n"At eight o\'clock! what a madman!" resumed Pauline. "And you know that\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie and her clique must have taken the Rambouillet train\r\nthat left at half-past six. It\'s very certain the husband and wife\r\nwon\'t come across each other to-day."\r\n\r\nBoth then began talking of the Rambouillet excursion. They did not\r\nwish it to be rainy for the others, because they themselves might\r\nsuffer as well; still, if a cloud could only burst over there without\r\na drop falling at Joinville, it would be funny all the same. Then they\r\nattacked Clara, who hardly knew how to spend the money she made by her\r\nvices. Hadn\'t she bought three pairs of boots all at the same time, and\r\nthrown them away the next day, after slashing them with her scissors,\r\non account of her feet, which were covered with corns? In fact, the\r\nyoung ladies were just as bad as the young men, they squandered\r\neverything, never saving a sou, but wasting two or three hundred francs\r\na month on dress and dainties.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s only got one arm," all of a sudden said Baug\xc3\xa9, who had kept\r\nhis eyes on Lhomme. "How does he manage to play the French horn?"\r\n\r\nPauline, who sometimes amused herself by playing on her lover\'s\r\nstupidity, thereupon told him that the cashier kept the instrument up\r\nby leaning it against a wall. He thoroughly believed her, and thought\r\nit very ingenious. And when, stricken with remorse, she explained to\r\nhim that Lhomme had adapted to his stump a system of claws which he\r\nmade use of as fingers, he shook his head, full of doubt and declaring\r\nthat they wouldn\'t make him swallow that.\r\n\r\n"You are really too stupid!" she retorted, laughing. "Never mind, I\r\nlove you all the same."\r\n\r\nThey reached the station of the Vincennes line just in time for a\r\ntrain. Baug\xc3\xa9 paid; but Denise had previously declared that she wished\r\nto defray her share of the expenses; they would settle up in the\r\nevening. They took second-class tickets, and found the train full\r\nof a gay, noisy throng. At Nogent, a wedding-party got out, amidst\r\na storm of laughter. Then, at last they arrived at Joinville, and\r\nwent straight to the island to order lunch; and afterwards lingered\r\nthere, strolling along, under the tall poplars beside the Marne.\r\nIt was rather cold in the shade, a sharp breeze was blowing in the\r\nsunshine, gathering strength as it swept from the distance over a\r\nplain dotted with cultivated fields, on the other side of the river.\r\nDenise lingered behind Pauline and her lover, who walked along with\r\ntheir arms round each other\'s waists. She had picked a handful of\r\nbuttercups, and was watching the flow of the river, happy, but her\r\nheart beating and her head drooping, each time that Baug\xc3\xa9 leant over\r\nto kiss his sweetheart. Her eyes filled with tears. And yet she was\r\nnot suffering. What could be the matter with her that she experienced\r\nthis feeling of suffocation? Why did this vast landscape, amidst which\r\nshe had looked forward to so much enjoyment, fill her with a vague\r\nregret that she could not explain? However, at lunch, Pauline\'s noisy\r\nlaughter bewildered her. That young woman, who loved the suburbs\r\nwith the passion of an actress living in the gas-light, in the heavy\r\natmosphere of a crowd, wanted to lunch in an arbour, notwithstanding\r\nthe sharp wind. She made merry over the sudden gusts which blew up the\r\ntable-cloth, and thought the arbour very funny in its bareness, with\r\nits freshly-painted trellis-work which cast a reflection on the cloth.\r\nShe ate ravenously, devouring everything with the voracity of one who,\r\nbeing badly fed at the shop, made up for it out of doors by giving\r\nherself an indigestion of all the things she liked. This was indeed her\r\nvice, she spent most of her money on cakes and indigestible dainties,\r\ntit-bits of all kinds, which she hastily nibbled in leisure moments.\r\nNow, however, as Denise seemed to have had enough with the eggs, fried\r\nfish, and stewed chicken, she restrained herself, not daring to order\r\nany strawberries which were still very dear, for fear of running the\r\nbill up too high.\r\n\r\n"Now, what are we going to do?" asked Baug\xc3\xa9, when the coffee was served.\r\n\r\nAs a rule Pauline and he returned to Paris to dine, and finish their\r\nouting in some theatre. But at Denise\'s request, they decided to\r\nremain at Joinville all day: it would be droll, they would take a fill\r\nof the country. So they wandered about the fields all the afternoon.\r\nThey spoke for a moment of going for a row, but abandoned the idea\r\nas Baug\xc3\xa9 was not a good waterman. However, their strolls along the\r\npathways ended by bringing them back to the banks of the Marne, all\r\nthe same, and they became interested in all the river life, the\r\nsquadrons of yawls and skiffs, and the young men who formed the crews.\r\nThe sun was setting and they were returning towards Joinville, when\r\nthey saw two boats coming down stream at a racing speed, their crews\r\nmeantime exchanging volleys of insults, in which the repeated cries of\r\n"Sawbones!" and "Counter-jumpers!" predominated.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" said Pauline, "it\'s Monsieur Hutin."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Baug\xc3\xa9, shading his face with his hand, "I recognise his\r\nmahogany boat. The other one is manned by students, no doubt."\r\n\r\nThereupon he explained the deadly hatred existing between the students\r\nand the shopmen. Denise, on hearing Hutin\'s name mentioned, had\r\nsuddenly stopped, and with fixed eyes followed the frail skiff. She\r\ntried to distinguish the young man among the rowers, but could only\r\nmanage to make out the white dresses of two women, one of whom, who was\r\nsteering, wore a red hat. Then the voices of the disputants died away\r\namidst the loud flow of the river.\r\n\r\n"Pitch \'em in, the sawbones!"\r\n\r\n"Duck \'em, the counter-jumpers!"\r\n\r\nIn the evening they returned to the restaurant on the island. But it\r\nhad turned very chilly and they were obliged to dine in one of the\r\nclosed rooms, where the table-cloths were still damp from the humidity\r\nof winter. At six o\'clock the tables were already crowded, yet the\r\nexcursionists still hurried in, looking for vacant corners; and the\r\nwaiters continued bringing in more chairs and forms, putting the plates\r\ncloser and closer together and crowding the people up. Cold as it had\r\nbeen before, the atmosphere now became stifling and they had to open\r\nthe windows. Out of doors, the day was waning, a greenish twilight fell\r\nfrom the poplars so quickly that the landlord, unprepared for these\r\nrepasts under cover, and having no lamps, was obliged to put a candle\r\non each table. What with the laughter, the calls and the clatter of\r\nplates and dishes the uproar became deafening; the candles flared and\r\nguttered in the draught from the open windows, whilst moths fluttered\r\nabout in the air warmed by the odour of the food, and traversed by\r\nsudden cold gusts of wind.\r\n\r\n"What fun they\'re having, eh?" said Pauline, very busy with a plate of\r\nstewed eels, which she declared extraordinary. And she leant over to\r\nadd: "Didn\'t you see Monsieur Albert over there?"\r\n\r\nIt was really young Lhomme, in the midst of three questionable women.\r\nAlready intoxicated, he was knocking his glass on the table, and\r\ntalking of drubbing the waiter if he did not bring some _liqueurs_\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n"Well!" resumed Pauline, "there\'s a family for you! the mother is at\r\nRambouillet, the father in Paris, and the son at Joinville; they won\'t\r\ntread on one another\'s toes to-day!"\r\n\r\nDenise, though she detested noise, was smiling and tasting the delight\r\nof being unable to think, amid such uproar. But all at once they heard\r\na commotion in the other room, a burst of voices which drowned all\r\nothers. Men were yelling, and must have come to blows, for one could\r\nhear a scuffle, chairs falling, quite a struggle indeed, amid which the\r\nriver-cries again resounded:\r\n\r\n"Duck \'em, the counter-jumpers!"\r\n\r\n"Pitch \'em in, the sawbones!"\r\n\r\nAnd when the landlord\'s loud voice had calmed this tempest, Hutin,\r\nwearing a red jersey, and with a little cap at the back of his head,\r\nsuddenly made his appearance, having on his arm the tall, fair girl,\r\nwho had been steering his boat and who by way of wearing the crew\'s\r\ncolours, had planted a bunch of poppies behind her ear. Clamorous\r\napplause greeted their entry; and Hutin, his face beaming with pride\r\nat thus being remarked, threw his chest forward and assumed a nautical\r\nrolling gait, displaying the while a bruised cheek, quite blue from a\r\nblow he had received. Behind him and his companion followed the crew.\r\nThey took a table by storm, and the uproar became deafening.\r\n\r\n"It appears," explained Baug\xc3\xa9, after listening to the conversation\r\nbehind him, "it appears that the students recognised the woman with\r\nHutin as an old friend from their neighbourhood, who now sings in a\r\nmusic-hall at Montmartre. So they were kicking up a row about her."\r\n\r\n"In any case," said Pauline, stiffly, "she\'s precious ugly, with her\r\ncarroty hair. Really, I don\'t know where Monsieur Hutin picks them up,\r\nbut they\'re an ugly, dirty lot."\r\n\r\nDenise had turned pale, and felt an icy coldness, as if her heart\'s\r\nblood were flowing away, drop by drop. Already, on seeing the boats\r\nfrom the bank she had felt a shiver; but now she no longer had any\r\ndoubt at seeing that girl with Hutin. With trembling hands, and a\r\nchoking sensation in her throat, she suddenly ceased to eat.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked her friend.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," she stammered, "but it\'s rather warm here."\r\n\r\nHowever Hutin\'s table was close to theirs, and when Hutin perceived\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9, whom he knew, he commenced a conversation in a shrill voice, in\r\norder to attract further attention.\r\n\r\n"I say," he cried, "are you as virtuous as ever at the Bon March\xc3\xa9?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much as all that," replied Baug\xc3\xa9, turning very red.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do! You know there\'s a confessional box at your place for\r\nthe salesmen who venture to look at the young ladies there. No, no! A\r\nhouse where they insist on their employees marrying, that won\'t do for\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nThe other fellows began to laugh, and Li\xc3\xa9nard who was one of Hutin\'s\r\ncrew added some jocular remark about the Louvre establishment at which\r\nPauline herself burst into a merry peal.\r\n\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9, however, was annoyed by the joke about the staid propriety and\r\ninnocence of his establishment, and all at once he retorted: "Oh, you\r\nneedn\'t talk, you are not so well off at The Ladies\' Paradise. Sacked\r\nfor the slightest thing! And a governor too who is always smirking\r\nround his lady customers."\r\n\r\nHutin no longer listened to him, but began to praise the Place Clichy\r\nestablishment. He knew a girl there who was so inexpressibly dignified\r\nthat customers dared not speak to her for fear of humiliating her.\r\nThen, drawing up closer, he related that he had made a hundred and\r\nfifteen francs that week; oh! a capital week. Favier had been left\r\nbehind with merely fifty-two francs, in fact the whole lot had been\r\nfloored. And it could be seen that he was telling the truth. He was\r\nsquandering his cash as fast as possible and did not mean to go to bed\r\ntill he had rid himself of the hundred and fifteen francs. Then, as he\r\ngradually became intoxicated, he fell foul of Robineau, that fool of a\r\nsecond-hand who affected to keep himself apart, to such a point that he\r\nrefused to walk down the street with one of his salesmen.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," said Li\xc3\xa9nard; "you talk too much, old man."\r\n\r\nThe heat had yet increased, the candles were guttering down on to the\r\nwine-stained table-cloths; and through the open windows, whenever the\r\nnoise within ceased for an instant, there came a distant prolonged\r\nmurmur, the voice of the river, and of the lofty poplars falling asleep\r\nin the calm night. Baug\xc3\xa9 had just called for the bill, seeing that\r\nDenise was no better; indeed she was now quite white, choking from the\r\ntears she withheld; however, the waiter did not appear, and she had to\r\nsubmit to more of Hutin\'s loud talk. He was now boasting of being much\r\nsuperior to Li\xc3\xa9nard, because Li\xc3\xa9nard simply squandered his father\'s\r\nmoney, whereas he, Hutin, spent his own earnings, the fruit of his\r\nintelligence. At last Baug\xc3\xa9 paid, and the two girls went out.\r\n\r\nDenise heaved a sigh of relief. For a moment she had thought she was\r\ngoing to die in that suffocating heat, amidst all those cries; and she\r\nstill attributed her faintness to want of air. At present she could\r\nbreathe freely in the freshness of the starry night.\r\n\r\nAs the two young women were leaving the garden of the restaurant, a\r\ntimid voice murmured in the shade: "Good evening, ladies."\r\n\r\nIt was Deloche. They had not seen him at the further end of the front\r\nroom, where he had been dining alone, after coming from Paris on foot,\r\nfor the pleasure of the walk. On recognising his friendly voice,\r\nDenise, suffering as she was, yielded mechanically to the need of some\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Deloche," said she, "are you coming back with us? Give me\r\nyour arm."\r\n\r\nPauline and Baug\xc3\xa9 had already gone on in front. They were astonished,\r\nnever thinking it would turn out like that, and with that fellow above\r\nall. However, as there was still an hour before the train started,\r\nthey went to the end of the island, following the bank, under the tall\r\npoplars; and, from time to time, they turned round, murmuring: "But\r\nwhere have they got to? Ah, there they are. It\'s rather funny, all the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nAt first Denise and Deloche remained silent. The uproar from the\r\nrestaurant was slowly dying away, changing into a musical sweetness\r\nin the calmness of the night; and still feverish from that furnace,\r\nwhose lights were disappearing one by one behind the foliage, they\r\nwent further in amidst the coolness of the trees. Opposite them there\r\nwas a sort of shadowy wall, a mass of shadow so dense that they could\r\nnot even distinguish any trace of the path. However, they went forward\r\nquietly, without fear. Then, their eyes getting more accustomed to the\r\ndarkness, they saw on the right hand the trunks of the poplar trees,\r\nresembling sombre columns upholding the domes of their branches,\r\nbetween which gleamed the stars; whilst the water occasionally shone\r\nlike a mirror. The wind was falling and they no longer heard anything\r\nbut the loud flow of the stream.\r\n\r\n"I am very pleased to have met you," stammered Deloche at last, making\r\nup his mind to speak first. "You can\'t think how happy you render me in\r\nconsenting to walk with me."\r\n\r\nAnd, aided by the darkness, after many awkward attempts, he ventured to\r\ntell her that he loved her. He had long wanted to write to her and tell\r\nher so; but perhaps she would never have known it had it not been for\r\nthat lovely night coming to his assistance, that water which murmured\r\nso softly, and those trees which screened them with their shade.\r\nHowever, she did not reply; she continued to walk by his side with the\r\nsame suffering air. And he was trying to gaze into her face, when all\r\nat once he heard a sob.\r\n\r\n"Oh! good heavens!" he exclaimed, "you are crying, mademoiselle, you\r\nare crying! Have I offended you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," she murmured.\r\n\r\nShe strove to keep back her tears, but could not do so. Even whilst she\r\nwas at table, she had thought that her heart was about to burst. And\r\nnow in the darkness she surrendered herself to her sensibility, stifled\r\nby her sobs and thinking that if Hutin had been in Deloche\'s place and\r\nhad said such tender things to her, she would have been unable to say\r\nnay. But this self-confession suddenly filled her with confusion, and a\r\nburning flush of shame suffused her face.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to offend you," continued Deloche, almost crying also.\r\n\r\n"No, but listen," she replied, her voice still trembling; "I am not at\r\nall angry with you. But never speak to me again as you have just done.\r\nOh! you\'re a good fellow, and I\'m quite willing to be your friend, but\r\nnothing more. You understand--your friend."\r\n\r\nHe quivered, and after a few steps taken in silence, he stammered: "In\r\nfact, you don\'t love me?"\r\n\r\nAnd then as she spared him the pain of a brutal "no," he resumed in a\r\nsoft, heart-broken voice: "Oh, I was prepared for it. I have never had\r\nany luck, I know I can never be happy. At home, they used to beat me.\r\nIn Paris, I\'ve always been a drudge. You see, when a chap doesn\'t know\r\nhow to rob other fellows of their sweethearts, and is too awkward to\r\nearn as much as the others, why the best thing he can do is to go into\r\nsome corner and die. Never fear, I shan\'t torment you any more. As for\r\nloving you, you can\'t prevent me, can you? I shall love you like a dog.\r\nThere, everything escapes me, that\'s my luck in life."\r\n\r\nAnd then he, too, burst into tears. She tried to console him, and in\r\ntheir friendly effusion they found they belonged to the same part\r\nof the country--she to Valognes, he to Briquebec, eight miles from\r\neach other, and this proved a fresh tie. His father, a poor, needy\r\nprocess-server, sickly jealous, had been wont to drub him, exasperated\r\nby his long pale face and tow-like hair, which, said he, did not belong\r\nto the family. Then they got to talking of the vast Cotentin pastures,\r\nsurrounded with quick-set hedges, of the shady paths and lanes winding\r\nbeneath elm trees, and of the grass grown roads, like alleys in a park.\r\nAround them the night was yet paling and they could distinguish the\r\nrushes on the banks, and the lacework of the foliage, black against the\r\ntwinkling stars; and a peacefulness came over them, they forgot their\r\ntroubles, brought closer together, to a cordial feeling of friendship,\r\nby their ill-luck.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked Pauline of Denise, taking her aside when they reached the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe young girl, who understood her friend\'s meaning by her smile and\r\nstare of tender curiosity, turned very red and answered: "Oh! no,\r\nmy dear. Remember what I told you. But he belongs to my part of the\r\ncountry. We were talking about Valognes."\r\n\r\nPauline and Baug\xc3\xa9 were perplexed, put out in their ideas, not knowing\r\nwhat to think. Deloche left them on the Place de la Bastille; like\r\nall young probationers, he slept in the house, and had to be back by\r\neleven o\'clock. Not wishing to go in with him, Denise, who had obtained\r\nwhat was called "theatre leave" which allowed her to remain out till\r\npast midnight, accepted Baug\xc3\xa9\'s invitation to accompany Pauline to his\r\nhome in the Rue Saint-Roch. They took a cab, and on the way Denise was\r\nstupefied to learn that her friend would not return to The Paradise\r\ntill the morrow, having squared matters with Madame Cabin by giving\r\nher a five-franc piece. Baug\xc3\xa9, who did the honours of his room, which\r\nwas furnished with some old Empire furniture, given him by his father,\r\ngot angry when Denise spoke of settling up, but at last accepted the\r\nfifteen francs twelve sous which she had laid on the chest of drawers;\r\nhowever, he insisted on making her a cup of tea, and after struggling\r\nwith a spirit-lamp and saucepan, was obliged to go and fetch some\r\nsugar. Midnight struck as he was pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\n"I must be off," said Denise.\r\n\r\n"Presently," replied Pauline. "The theatres don\'t close so early."\r\n\r\nDenise however felt uncomfortable in that bachelor\'s room and a quarter\r\nof an hour later she contrived to slip away.\r\n\r\nThe private door which conducted to Mouret\'s apartments and to the\r\nassistants\' bedrooms was in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin. Madame Cabin\r\nopened it by pulling a string and then gave a glance in order to see\r\nwho was returning. A night-light was burning dimly in the hall, and\r\nDenise on finding herself in this uncertain glimmer, hesitated, and\r\nwas seized with fear, for a moment previously, on turning the corner\r\nof the street, she had seen the door close on the shadowy figure of a\r\nman. It must have been the governor coming home from a party; and the\r\nidea that he was there in the dark possibly waiting for her, caused\r\nher one of those strange fears with which he still inspired her,\r\nwithout any reasonable cause. Some one was certainly moving about on\r\nthe first-floor, for she heard a creaking of boots, whereupon quite\r\nlosing her head, she opened a door which led into the shop, and which\r\nwas always left unlocked for the night-watch to make his rounds. On\r\nentering she found herself in the printed cotton department.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! what shall I do?" she stammered, in her emotion.\r\n\r\nThen the idea occurred to her that there was another door upstairs\r\nleading to the bedrooms; but to reach it she would have to go right\r\nacross the shop. She preferred this, however, notwithstanding the\r\ndarkness reigning in the galleries. Not a gas-jet was burning there;\r\nonly a few lighted oil-lamps hung here and there from the branches\r\nof the chandeliers; and these scattered lights, like yellow specks\r\nfading away in the gloom, resembled the lanterns hung up in mines. Big\r\nshadows loomed before her; she could hardly distinguish the piles of\r\ngoods, which assumed all sorts of threatening aspects--now they looked\r\nlike fallen columns, now like squatting beasts, and now like lurking\r\nthieves. The heavy silence, broken by distant breathing, moreover\r\nincreased the darkness. However, she found her way. From the linen\r\ndepartment on her left came a paler gleam, bluey, like a house front\r\nunder a summer sky at night; then she wished to cross the central hall,\r\nbut on running up against some piles of printed calico, she thought it\r\nsafer to traverse the hosiery department, and then the woollen one.\r\nThere she was frightened by a loud noise of snoring. It was Joseph, the\r\nmessenger, sleeping behind some mourning articles. She then quickly\r\nran into the hall where the skylight cast a sort of crepuscular light,\r\nwhich made it appear larger, and, with its motionless shelves, and\r\nthe shadows of its yard-measures describing reversed crosses, lent it\r\nthe awe-inspiring aspect of a church at night. And she, indeed full\r\nof fear, now fairly fled. In the mercery and glove departments she\r\nnearly trod on some more assistants, and only felt safe when she at\r\nlast found herself on the staircase. But up above, just outside the\r\nmantle department, she was again seized with terror on perceiving a\r\nlantern twinkling in the darkness and moving forward. It was the patrol\r\nof two firemen, marking their passage on the faces of the indicators.\r\nShe stood still for a moment failing to understand their business, and\r\nwatched them passing from among the shawls to the furniture, and then\r\non to the under-linen department, terrified the while by their strange\r\nman\xc5\x93uvres, by the grating of their keys and the closing of the iron\r\ndoors which shut with a resounding clang. When they approached, she\r\ntook refuge in the lace department, but suddenly heard herself called\r\nby name and thereupon ran off to the door conducting to the private\r\nstairs. She had recognised Deloche\'s voice. He slept in his department,\r\non a little iron bedstead which he set up himself every evening; and\r\nhe was not asleep yet, but with open eyes was rememorating aloud the\r\npleasant hours he had spent that evening.\r\n\r\n"What! it\'s you, mademoiselle?" said Mouret, whom Denise despite\r\nall her man\xc5\x93uvring found before her on the staircase, a small\r\npocket-candleholder in his hand.\r\n\r\nShe stammered, and tried to explain that she had been to look for\r\nsomething. But he was not angry. He gazed at her with his paternal, and\r\nat the same time inquisitive, air.\r\n\r\n"You had permission to go to the theatre, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"And have you enjoyed yourself? What theatre did you go to?"\r\n\r\n"I have been in the country, sir."\r\n\r\nThis made him laugh. Then laying a certain stress on his words, he\r\nadded: "All alone?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; with a lady friend," she replied, her cheeks burning, shocked\r\nas she was by the suspicion which his words implied.\r\n\r\nHe said no more; but he was still looking at her in her simple black\r\ndress and bonnet trimmed with a strip of blue ribbon. Was this little\r\nsavage going to turn out a pretty girl? She looked all the better for\r\nher day in the open air, quite charming indeed with her splendid hair\r\nwaving over her forehead. And he, who during the last six months had\r\ntreated her like a child, sometimes giving her advice, yielding to a\r\ndesire to inform himself, to a wicked wish to know how a woman grew up\r\nand became lost in Paris, no longer laughed, but experienced a feeling\r\nof surprise and fear mingled with tenderness. No doubt it was a lover\r\nwho was improving her like this. At this thought he felt as if pecked\r\nto the heart by a favourite bird, with which he had been playing.\r\n\r\n"Good night, sir," murmured Denise, continuing on her way without\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but remained watching her till she had disappeared.\r\nAnd then he entered his own apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the dead summer season arrived, quite a hurricane of panic\r\nswept through The Ladies\' Paradise. The reign of terror--terror of\r\ndismissal--commenced; many employees were sent away on leave, and\r\nothers were dismissed in dozens by the principals, bent on clearing the\r\nshop, as no customers appeared there during the July and August heat.\r\nMouret, on making his daily round with Bourdoncle, would call aside\r\nthe managers, whom he had prompted during the winter to engage more\r\nmen than were really necessary, in order that the business might not\r\nsuffer; but it was now a question of reducing expenses and this was\r\neffected by casting quite a third of the shop people--the weak ones who\r\nallowed themselves to be swallowed up by the strong ones--on to the\r\npavements again.\r\n\r\n"Come," he would say, "you must have some who don\'t suit you. We can\'t\r\nkeep them all this time doing nothing."\r\n\r\nAnd if the manager hesitated, hardly knowing whom to sacrifice, he\r\nwould continue: "Make your own arrangements, six salesmen must suffice;\r\nyou can take on others in October, there are always plenty to be had!"\r\n\r\nMoreover Bourdoncle undertook the executions. He had a terrible way of\r\nsaying: "Go and be paid!" which fell on the poor devil he had singled\r\nout like a blow from an axe. Anything served him as a pretext for\r\nclearing off the superfluous staff. He invented misdeeds, speculating\r\non the slightest negligence. "You were sitting down, sir; go and get\r\npaid!" "You dare to answer me; go and get paid!" "Your shoes have not\r\nbeen blackened; go and get paid!" And even the bravest trembled in\r\npresence of the massacre which he left behind him. Then, this system\r\nnot working quickly enough, he invented a trap by which in a few days\r\nand without fatigue, he got rid of the number of salesmen condemned\r\nbeforehand. At eight o\'clock, he took his stand at the door, watch in\r\nhand; and at three minutes past the hour, the breathless young people\r\nwho arrived were greeted with his implacable "Go and get paid!" This\r\nwas a quick and cleanly manner of doing the work.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve an ugly mug," he ended by saying one day to a poor devil whose\r\nnose, all on one side, annoyed him, "go and get paid!"\r\n\r\nThe favoured ones obtained a fortnight\'s holiday without pay, which\r\nwas a more humane way of lessening the expenses. Moreover the salesmen\r\nquietly accepted their precarious situation, obliged to do so by\r\nnecessity and habit. Since their arrival in Paris, they had roamed\r\nabout, commencing their apprenticeship here, finishing it there,\r\ngetting dismissed or they themselves resigning all at once, just as\r\ninterest dictated. When business slackened the workmen lost their daily\r\nbread; and this went on amidst the subdued working of the machine, the\r\nuseless gear was quietly thrown aside, like so much old plant. There\r\nwas no gratitude shown for services rendered. So much the worse for\r\nthose who did not know how to look after themselves!\r\n\r\nNothing else was now talked of in the various departments. Fresh\r\nstories circulated every day. The dismissed salesmen were named, in the\r\nsame way as one counts the dead in time of cholera. The shawl and the\r\nwoollen departments suffered especially; seven employees disappeared\r\nfrom them in one week. Then quite a drama threw the under-linen\r\ndepartment into confusion: a customer, nearly fainting away, accused\r\nthe young person who had served her of eating garlic; and the latter\r\nwas dismissed at once, although, badly fed and dying of hunger, she\r\nhad simply been finishing a collection of bread-crusts at the counter.\r\nHowever, the authorities showed themselves pitiless at the least\r\ncomplaint from customers; no excuse was admitted, the employee was\r\nalways wrong, and had to disappear like a defective instrument, which\r\ninterfered with the proper working of the business; and the others\r\nbowed their heads, not even attempting any defence. In the panic which\r\nwas raging, each trembled for himself. Mignot, going out one day with\r\na parcel under his coat, notwithstanding the regulations, was nearly\r\ncaught, and really thought himself lost. Li\xc3\xa9nard, celebrated for his\r\nidleness, was simply indebted to his father\'s position in the drapery\r\ntrade for not being turned away one afternoon when Bourdoncle found\r\nhim dozing between two piles of English velvets. But the Lhommes were\r\nespecially anxious, each day expecting to see their son Albert sent\r\naway, as the principals were very dissatisfied with his conduct at his\r\npay-desk. He frequently had women there who diverted his attention from\r\nhis work; and twice already Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie had been obliged to plead\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nDenise was so menaced amid this general clearance, that she lived in\r\nconstant expectation of a catastrophe. It was in vain that she summoned\r\nup her courage, struggling with all her gaiety and all her reason in\r\nthe endeavour not to yield to the misgivings of her tender nature;\r\nshe burst into blinding tears as soon as she had closed the door of\r\nher bedroom, in desolation at the thought of finding herself in the\r\nstreet, on bad terms with her uncle, not knowing where to go, without a\r\ncopper saved, and with the two children to look after. The sensations\r\nshe had experienced during the first few weeks again returned, she\r\nfancied herself a grain of seed under a powerful millstone; and utter\r\ndiscouragement came over her at the thought of what a small atom she\r\nwas in this great machine, which would certainly crush her with its\r\nquiet indifference. There was no illusion possible; if they dismissed\r\nany one from her department it would certainly be herself. During the\r\nRambouillet excursion no doubt the other young ladies had incensed\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie against her, for since then that lady had treated her\r\nwith an air of severity into which entered a certain rancour. Besides,\r\nthey could not forgive her for going to Joinville, regarding it as a\r\nsign of revolt, a means of setting the whole department at defiance, by\r\nexhibiting herself out of doors with a young lady from a rival counter.\r\nNever had Denise suffered so much in the department, and she now gave\r\nup all hope of conquering it.\r\n\r\n"Let them alone!" repeated Pauline, "a lot of stuck-up things, as\r\nstupid as geese!"\r\n\r\nBut it was just these fine-lady airs which intimidated Denise. Nearly\r\nall the saleswomen, by their daily contact with rich customers,\r\nacquired certain graces, and finished by forming a vague nameless\r\nclass--something between a work-girl and a middle-class lady. But\r\nbeneath their art in dress, and the manners and phrases they had learnt\r\nby rote, there was often only a false, superficial education, the fruit\r\nof reading worthless papers, attending cheap theatres and music-halls,\r\nand picking up all the current stupidities of Paris.\r\n\r\n"You know the \'unkempt one\' has got a child?" said Clara one morning,\r\non arriving in the department. And, as the others seemed astonished,\r\nshe continued: "Yes, I saw her yesterday myself taking the child out\r\nfor a walk! She\'s got it stowed away in the neighbourhood, somewhere."\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Marguerite came up after dinner with another piece of\r\nnews. "A nice thing, I\'ve just seen the unkempt one\'s sweetheart--a\r\nworkman, just fancy! Yes, a dirty little workman, with yellow hair, who\r\nwas watching her through the windows."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it became an accepted fact: Denise had a workman for\r\na lover, and an infant concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood. They\r\noverwhelmed her with spiteful allusions. The first time she understood\r\nthem she turned quite pale at the monstrosity of their suppositions. It\r\nwas abominable; she tried to explain, and stammered out: "But they are\r\nmy brothers!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh! her brothers!" said Clara in a bantering tone.\r\n\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie was obliged to interfere. "Be quiet! young ladies. You\r\nhad better go on changing those tickets. Mademoiselle Baudu is quite\r\nfree to misbehave herself out of doors, if only she worked a bit when\r\nshe is here."\r\n\r\nThis curt defence was a condemnation. The poor girl, suffocating as\r\nif they had accused her of a crime, vainly endeavoured to explain the\r\nfacts. They laughed and shrugged their shoulders, and she felt wounded\r\nto the heart. On hearing the rumours Deloche was so indignant that he\r\nwanted to slap the faces of the young ladies in Denise\'s department;\r\nand was only restrained from doing so by the fear of compromising her.\r\nSince the evening at Joinville, he had harboured a submissive love, an\r\nalmost religious friendship for her, which he proved by his faithful\r\ndoglike looks. He was careful not to show his affection before the\r\nothers, for they would have laughed at him, still that did not prevent\r\nhim dreaming of the avenging blow he would deal if ever any one should\r\nattack her in his presence.\r\n\r\nDenise finished by not answering the insults. It was all too odious,\r\nnobody would believe it. When any of her companions ventured a fresh\r\nallusion, she contented herself with looking at her with a sad, calm\r\nair. Besides, she had other troubles, material anxieties which took\r\nup her attention. Jean went on as badly as ever, always worrying her\r\nfor money. Hardly a week passed that she did not receive some fresh\r\nstory from him, four pages long; and when the house postman brought\r\nher these letters, in a big, passionate handwriting, she hastened to\r\nhide them in her pocket, for the saleswomen affected to laugh, and\r\nhummed snatches of some doubtful ditties. Then, after inventing some\r\npretext to enable her to go to the other end of the establishment\r\nand read these letters, she became full of fear; poor Jean seemed to\r\nbe lost. All his fibs succeeded with her, she believed in all his\r\nextraordinary love adventures, her complete ignorance of such things\r\nmaking her exaggerate his dangers. Sometimes it was a two-franc piece\r\nhe wanted to enable him to escape some woman\'s jealousy, at other times\r\nfive francs, six francs, to get some poor girl out of a scrape as her\r\nfather would otherwise kill her. And so, as her salary and commission\r\ndid not suffice, Denise conceived the idea of looking for a little work\r\nafter business hours. She spoke about it to Robineau, who had shown a\r\ncertain sympathy for her since their first meeting at Vin\xc3\xa7ard\'s, and\r\nhe procured her the making of some neckties at five sous a dozen. At\r\nnight, between nine and one o\'clock, she could sew six dozen of these\r\nwhich represented thirty sous, out of which she had to deduct four sous\r\nfor a candle. And as this sum kept Jean going she did not complain of\r\nthe want of sleep, and would have thought herself very happy had not\r\nanother catastrophe once more upset her budgetary calculations. At the\r\nend of the second fortnight, when she went to the necktie-dealer\'s,\r\nshe found the door closed; the woman had failed, become bankrupt,\r\nthus carrying off her eighteen francs six sous, a considerable sum on\r\nwhich she had been relying for the last week. All the annoyances she\r\nexperienced in the department disappeared before this disaster.\r\n\r\n"You seem worried," said Pauline, meeting her one day in the furniture\r\ngallery, looking very pale. "Are you in want of anything?"\r\n\r\nBut as Denise already owed her friend twelve francs, she tried to smile\r\nand replied: "No, thanks. I\'ve not slept well, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nIt was the twentieth of July, and the panic caused by the dismissals\r\nwas at its height. Out of the four hundred employees, Bourdoncle had\r\nalready sacked fifty, and there were rumours of fresh executions. She,\r\nhowever, thought but little of the menaces which were flying about,\r\nentirely absorbed as she was by the anguish caused her by one of Jean\'s\r\nadventures, an adventure yet more terrifying than any previous one.\r\nThat very day he wanted fifteen francs, which sum alone could save him\r\nfrom somebody\'s vengeance. On the previous evening she had received\r\nthe first letter opening the drama; then, one after the other had come\r\ntwo more; and in the last, the perusal of which she was finishing when\r\nPauline met her, Jean had announced his death for that evening, if she\r\ndid not send the money. She was in agony. She couldn\'t take the sum\r\nout of P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board money as this she had paid away two days before.\r\nEvery sort of bad luck was pursuing her, for she had hoped to get her\r\neighteen francs six sous through Robineau, who might perhaps be able\r\nto find the necktie-dealer; but Robineau, having got a fortnight\'s\r\nholiday, had not returned on the previous night though expected to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pauline still questioned her in a friendly way. Whenever they\r\nmet, in an out-of-the-way department, they would thus converse for a\r\nfew minutes, keeping a sharp look-out the while. And suddenly, Pauline\r\nmade a move as if to run off, having observed the white tie of an\r\ninspector coming out of the shawl department.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s only old Jouve!" she murmured in a relieved tone. "I can\'t\r\nthink what makes the old man grin as he does when he sees us together.\r\nIn your place I should beware, for he\'s too kind to you. He\'s an old\r\nhumbug, as spiteful as a cat, and thinks he\'s still got his troopers to\r\ntalk to."\r\n\r\nThis was quite true; Jouve was detested by all the salespeople for his\r\nseverity. More than half the dismissals were the result of his reports;\r\nand, rakish ex-captain that he was, with a big red nose, he only shewed\r\nhimself lenient in the departments served by women. Thus though he must\r\nhave perceived Denise and Pauline he went away, pretending not to see\r\nthem; and they heard him dropping on a salesman of the lace department,\r\nguilty of watching a fallen horse in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin.\r\n\r\n"By the way," resumed Pauline, "weren\'t you looking for Monsieur\r\nRobineau yesterday? He\'s come back."\r\n\r\nAt this Denise thought herself saved. "Thanks," said she, "I\'ll go\r\nround the other way then, and pass through the silk department. So much\r\nthe worse! They sent me upstairs to the work-room to fetch a bodkin."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon they separated. The young girl, with a busy look, as if\r\nshe were running from pay-desk to pay-desk in search of something,\r\nreached the stairs and went down into the hall. It was a quarter to\r\nten, the first lunch-bell had rung. A warm sun was playing on the\r\nwindows, and in spite of the grey linen blinds, the heat penetrated the\r\nstagnant air. Now and then a refreshing breath arose from the floor,\r\nwhich some assistants were gently watering. A somnolence, a summer\r\nsiesta reigned in all the vacant spaces around the counters, you might\r\nhave thought yourself in a church wrapt in sleeping shadow after the\r\nlast mass. Some salesmen were standing about listlessly, and a few rare\r\ncustomers crossed the galleries and the hall, with the indolent step of\r\nwomen annoyed by the sun.\r\n\r\nJust as Denise went down, Favier was measuring a dress length of light\r\nsilk, with pink spots, for Madame Boutarel, who had arrived in Paris\r\nfrom the South on the previous day. Since the commencement of the\r\nmonth, the provinces had been sending up their detachments; you saw\r\nnothing but queerly-dressed dames in yellow shawls, green skirts, and\r\nflaring bonnets. But the shopmen were even too indolent to laugh at\r\nthem. Favier accompanied Madame Boutarel to the mercery department, and\r\non returning, remarked to Hutin:\r\n\r\n"Yesterday they were all Auvergnat women, to-day they\'re all\r\nProven\xc3\xa7ales. I\'m sick of them."\r\n\r\nBut just then Hutin rushed forward, for it was his turn, and he had\r\nrecognised "the pretty lady," the lovely blonde thus nicknamed by the\r\ndepartment which knew nothing about her, not even her name. They all\r\nsmiled at her, not a week passed without her coming to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, hitherto always alone. This time, however, she had a little\r\nboy of four or five with her, and this gave rise to various comments.\r\n\r\n"She\'s married, then?" asked Favier, when Hutin returned from the\r\npay-desk, where he had debited her with thirty yards of Duchess satin.\r\n\r\n"Possibly," replied he, "although the youngster proves nothing. Perhaps\r\nhe belongs to a lady friend. What\'s certain is, that she must have been\r\nweeping. She was awfully melancholy, and her eyes were so red!"\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. The two salesmen gazed vaguely into the depths of the\r\nshop. Then Favier resumed in a low voice: "If she\'s married, perhaps\r\nher husband\'s smacked her face."\r\n\r\n"Possibly," repeated Hutin, "unless a lover has played her false." And\r\nafter a fresh silence, he added: "Any way, I don\'t care a hang!"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Denise crossed the silk department, slackening her steps\r\nand looking around her, in search of Robineau. She could not see him,\r\nso she went into the linen department, then passed through again. The\r\ntwo salesmen had noticed her movements.\r\n\r\n"There\'s that bag of bones again," murmured Hutin.\r\n\r\n"She\'s looking for Robineau," said Favier. "I can\'t think what they get\r\nup to together. Oh! nothing wrong. But they say Robineau has procured\r\nher a little work, some neckties. What a spec, eh?"\r\n\r\nHutin was meditating something spiteful; and when Denise passed near\r\nhim, he stopped her, saying: "Is it me you\'re looking for?"\r\n\r\nShe turned very red. Since the Joinville excursion, she had not dared\r\nto read her heart, full of confused sensations. She was constantly\r\nrecalling his appearance with that red-haired girl, and if she still\r\ntrembled before him, it was doubtless from uneasiness. Had she ever\r\nloved him? Did she love him still? She hardly liked to stir up these\r\nthings, which were painful to her.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," she replied, embarrassed.\r\n\r\nHutin thereupon began to laugh at her uneasy manner. "Would you like us\r\nto serve him to you? Favier, just serve Robineau to this young lady."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him fixedly, with the sad calm look with which she had\r\nmet the wounding remarks made by the girls, her companions. Ah! so he\r\nwas spiteful, he attacked her as well as the others! And she felt a\r\nsort of supreme anguish, the breaking of a last tie. Her face expressed\r\nsuch real suffering, that Favier, although not of a very tender nature,\r\ncame to her assistance.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Robineau has gone out to match some goods," said he. "No\r\ndoubt he will be back for lunch. You\'ll find him here this afternoon,\r\nif you want to speak to him."\r\n\r\nDenise thanked him, and went up to her department, where Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nwas waiting for her in a terrible rage. What! she had been gone half an\r\nhour! Where had she just sprung from? Not from the work-room, that was\r\nquite certain! The poor girl hung her head, thinking of this avalanche\r\nof misfortunes. All would be over if Robineau should not come in.\r\nHowever, she resolved to go down again, later on.\r\n\r\nIn the silk department, Robineau\'s return had provoked quite a\r\nrevolution. The salesmen had hoped that, disgusted with the annoyances\r\nthey were incessantly causing him, he would not return to the\r\nestablishment; and, in fact, there was a moment, when pressed by\r\nVin\xc3\xa7ard to take over his business, he had almost decided to do so.\r\nHutin\'s secret labour, the mine which he had been laying under the\r\nsecond-hand\'s feet for months past, was about to explode. During\r\nRobineau\'s holidays, he had temporarily taken his place and had done\r\nhis best to injure him in the minds of the principals, and secure\r\npossession of his situation by excess of zeal; he discovered and\r\nreported all sorts of trifling irregularities, suggested improvements,\r\nand invented new designs. There was, however, nothing exceptional in\r\nall this. Everybody in the department--from the unpaid probationer,\r\nlonging to become a salesman, to the first salesman who coveted the\r\nsituation of manager--had but one fixed idea, and that was to dislodge\r\nthe comrade above them, to ascend another rung of the ladder, by\r\nknocking him over if necessary; and this battle of appetites, this\r\nconstant hurtling, even contributed to the better working of the\r\nmachine, inspiriting the sales and fanning the flame of success which\r\nwas astonishing Paris. Behind Hutin, there was Favier; and behind\r\nFavier came the others, in a long line. You heard a loud noise as\r\nof jaws working. Robineau was condemned, and each was grabbing for\r\none of his bones. So when the second-hand returned from his holiday\r\nthere was a general grumbling. The matter had to be settled at once,\r\nthe salesmen\'s attitude appearing so menacing that the head of the\r\ndepartment had sent Robineau out to match some goods at the d\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xb4ts of\r\nmanufacturers in order to give the authorities an opportunity to come\r\nto a decision.\r\n\r\n"We would sooner all leave, if he is to be kept," declared Hutin.\r\n\r\nThe affair greatly bothered Bouthemont, whose gaiety ill-accorded with\r\nsuch worries. He was pained to see nothing but scowling faces around\r\nhim. Nevertheless he desired to be just.\r\n\r\n"Come, leave him alone, he doesn\'t hurt you," he said.\r\n\r\nBut they protested energetically. "What! doesn\'t hurt us! An\r\ninsupportable being who is always irritable and so proud that he would\r\nwalk over one rather than not pass."\r\n\r\nThis was the great grievance of the department. Robineau, nervous as\r\na woman, was intolerably stiff and susceptible. They related scores\r\nof stories about him; one poor little fellow had fallen ill through\r\nhis treatment, and even lady customers had been humiliated by his curt\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, I won\'t take anything on myself," said Bouthemont.\r\n"I\'ve notified the position to the directors, and am going to speak\r\nabout it shortly."\r\n\r\nThe second lunch was being rung; the clang of a bell came up from the\r\nbasement with a distant muffled sound in the close air of the shop.\r\nHutin and Favier went down. From all the counters, came salesmen one\r\nby one, hastening, helter-skelter, through the narrow entrance to the\r\nkitchen passage down below, a damp passage always lighted by gas. The\r\nflock pushed forward, without a laugh or a word, amidst an increasing\r\nclatter of crockery and a strong odour of food. Then at the far end\r\nof the passage there was a sudden halt, before a wicket. Flanked by\r\npiles of plates, and armed with forks and spoons, which he plunged into\r\ncopper-pans, a cook was distributing the portions. And when he stood\r\naside, the flaring kitchen could be seen beyond his white-covered belly.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" muttered Hutin, consulting the bill of fare, written on a\r\nblack-board above the wicket. "Boiled beef and pungent sauce, or skate.\r\nNever any roast meat in this rotten shop! Their boiled beef and fish\r\ndon\'t do a fellow a bit of good!"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the fish was universally neglected, for the pan was quite\r\nfull. Favier, however, took some skate. Behind him, Hutin stooped down,\r\nsaying: "Beef and sauce."\r\n\r\nWith a mechanical movement of his fork, the cook picked up a piece of\r\nmeat; then poured a spoonful of sauce over it, and Hutin, suffocated by\r\nthe hot air from the kitchen, had hardly secured his portion, before\r\nthe words, "Beef, pungent sauce; beef, pungent sauce," followed each\r\nother like a litany; whilst the cook continued to pick up the meat\r\nand pour the sauce over it with the rapid rhythmical movement of a\r\nwell-regulated clock.\r\n\r\n"But the skate\'s cold," declared Favier, whose hand felt no warmth from\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nThey were now all hurrying along, with arms extended and plates held\r\nstraight, for fear of running against one another. Ten steps further\r\nwas the bar, another wicket with a shiny zinc counter, on which were\r\nranged the shares of wine, small bottles, without corks and still damp\r\nfrom rinsing. And each took one of these bottles in his empty hand\r\nas he passed, and then, completely laden, made for his table with a\r\nserious air, careful not to spill anything.\r\n\r\nHutin, however, grumbled between his teeth. "This is a fine dance, with\r\nall this crockery!"\r\n\r\nThe table at which he and Favier sat, was at the end of the corridor,\r\nin the last dining-room. The rooms were all alike, old cellars twelve\r\nfeet by fifteen, which had been cemented over and fitted up as\r\nrefectories; but the damp came through the paint-work, the yellow walls\r\nwere covered with greenish spots; and, from the narrow windows, opening\r\non the street, on a level with the pavement, there fell a livid light,\r\nincessantly traversed by the vague shadows of passers-by. In July as\r\nin December, you stifled in the warm air, laden with nauseous smells,\r\nwhich came from the kitchen near by.\r\n\r\nHutin went in first. On the table, which was fixed at one end to the\r\nwall, and covered with American cloth, there were only the glasses,\r\nknives, and forks, marking the places. A pile of clean plates stood at\r\neach end; whilst in the middle was a big loaf, a knife sticking in it,\r\nwith the handle in the air. Hutin rid himself of his bottle and laid\r\ndown his plate; then, after taking his napkin from the bottom of a set\r\nof pigeon-holes, the sole ornament on the walls, he heaved a sigh and\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m fearfully hungry, too!" he murmured.\r\n\r\n"It\'s always like that," replied Favier, seating himself on the left.\r\n"Nothing to eat when one is starving."\r\n\r\nThe table was rapidly filling. It contained twenty-two places. At\r\nfirst nothing was heard but a loud clattering of knives and forks, the\r\ngormandizing of big fellows whom thirteen hours\' daily work incessantly\r\nrendered hungry. Formerly the employees had been allowed an hour for\r\nmeals, which had enabled them to go to a caf\xc3\xa9 and take their coffee;\r\nand they would then despatch their dinner in twenty minutes, anxious\r\nto get into the street. But this excited them too much, they came back\r\ncareless, their minds bent on other things than business; and so the\r\nmanagers had decided that they should not go out, but pay an extra\r\nthree halfpence for a cup of coffee, if they wanted one. So now they\r\nwere in no hurry, but prolonged the meal, being in no wise anxious to\r\ngo back to work before time. Between their big mouthfuls a great many\r\nread newspapers which they had folded and placed against their bottles.\r\nOthers, their first hunger satisfied, talked noisily, always returning\r\nto the eternal grievance of the bad food, to the money they had earned,\r\nto what they had done on the previous Sunday, and what they were going\r\nto do on the next one.\r\n\r\n"I say, what about your Robineau?" a salesman suddenly asked Hutin.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the men of the silk department and their\r\nsecond-hand occupied all the counters. The question was discussed every\r\nevening at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Saint-Roch until midnight. Hutin, who was busy with\r\nhis piece of beef, contented himself with replying:\r\n\r\n"Well! he\'s come back." Then, suddenly getting angry, he resumed: "But\r\nconfound it! I really believe they\'ve given me a slice of donkey! It\'s\r\nbecome disgusting, my word of honour!"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t grumble!" said Favier. "I was flat enough to ask for\r\nskate. It\'s putrid."\r\n\r\nThey were all speaking at once, some complaining and some joking. At a\r\ncorner of the table, against the wall, sat Deloche silently eating. He\r\nwas afflicted with a ravenous appetite, which he had never been able to\r\nsatisfy, and not earning enough to afford any extras, he cut himself\r\nhuge chunks of bread, and bolted even the least savoury platefuls, with\r\na gormandizing air. They all laughed at him, crying: "Favier, pass your\r\nskate to Deloche. He likes it like that. And your meat, Hutin; Deloche\r\nwants it for his dessert."\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow shrugged his shoulders, and did not even reply. It\r\nwasn\'t his fault if he was dying of hunger. Besides, the others might\r\nabuse the food as much as they liked, they swallowed it all the same.\r\n\r\nBut a low whistle stopped their talk; Mouret and Bourdoncle were in\r\nthe corridor. For some time the complaints had become so frequent that\r\nthe principals pretended to come and judge the quality of the food\r\nthemselves. They gave thirty sous a head per day to the chief cook,\r\nwho had to pay for everything, provisions, coal, gas, and staff, and\r\nthey displayed a naive astonishment when the food was not good. That\r\nvery morning even, each department had deputed a spokesman. Mignot\r\nand Li\xc3\xa9nard had undertaken to speak for their comrades. And so, in\r\nthe sudden silence which fell, all ears were cocked to catch the\r\nconversation going on in the next room, which Mouret and Bourdoncle\r\nhad just entered. The latter declared the beef excellent; and Mignot,\r\nastounded by this quiet assertion, was repeating, "But chew it, and\r\nsee;" whilst Li\xc3\xa9nard, attacking the skate, gently remarked, "But it\r\nstinks, sir!" Mouret thereupon launched into a cordial speech; he would\r\ndo everything for his employees\' welfare, he was their father, and\r\nwould rather eat dry bread himself than see them badly fed.\r\n\r\n"I promise you to look into the matter," he said in conclusion, raising\r\nhis voice so that they might all hear it from one end of the passage to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry being finished, the noise of the knives and forks commenced\r\nonce more. "Yes, reckon on that, and drink water!" Hutin muttered. "Ah,\r\nthey\'re not stingy of fine words. You want some promises, there you\r\nare! But all the while they continue feeding you on old boot-leather,\r\nand chuck you out like dogs!"\r\n\r\nThe salesman who had already questioned him thereupon repeated: "You\r\nsay that Robineau----"\r\n\r\nBut a clatter of heavy crockery-ware drowned his voice. The men changed\r\ntheir plates themselves, and the piles at both ends were diminishing.\r\nWhen a kitchen-help brought in some large tin dishes, Hutin cried out:\r\n"Baked rice! this is a finisher!"\r\n\r\n"Good for a penn\'orth of gum!" said Favier, serving himself.\r\n\r\nSome liked it but others thought it too sticky. Those who were plunged\r\nin the fiction of their newspaper, not even knowing what they were\r\neating, remained silent. All, however, mopped their foreheads, and the\r\nnarrow cellar-like apartment filled with a ruddy vapour whilst the\r\nshadows of the passers-by continually passed like black bars over the\r\nlittered tables.\r\n\r\n"Pass Deloche the bread," cried one of the wags.\r\n\r\nEach one cut a piece, and then again dug the knife into the loaf up to\r\nthe handle; and the bread still went round.\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll take my rice for a dessert?" all at once asked Hutin; and\r\nwhen he had concluded his bargain with a short, thin young fellow, he\r\nattempted to sell his wine also; but no one would take it as it was\r\nknown to be detestable.\r\n\r\n"As I was telling you, Robineau is back," he continued, amid the\r\ncross-fire of laughter and conversation that went on. "Oh! his affair\r\nis serious. Just fancy, he has been leading the saleswomen astray! Yes,\r\nand he gets them cravats to make!"\r\n\r\n"Silence!" muttered Favier. "They\'re just judging him."\r\n\r\nAnd with a wink he called attention to Bouthemont, who was walking up\r\nand down the passage between Mouret and Bourdoncle, all three absorbed\r\nin an animated conversation, carried on in a low tone. The dining-room\r\nof the managers and second-hands happened to be just opposite. And\r\nso on seeing Mouret pass, Bouthemont, having finished his meal, had\r\ngot up to relate the affair and explain the awkward position he was\r\nin. The other two listened, still refusing to sacrifice Robineau, a\r\nfirst-class salesman, who dated from Madame H\xc3\xa9douin\'s time. But when\r\nBouthemont came to the story of the neckties, Bourdoncle got angry. Was\r\nthis fellow mad to interfere with the saleswomen and procure them extra\r\nwork? The house paid dearly enough for the women\'s time; if they worked\r\non their own account at night they must work less during the daytime\r\nin the shop, that was certain; therefore it was a robbery, they were\r\nrisking their health which did not belong to them. No, the night was\r\nintended for sleep; they must all sleep, or they would be sent to the\r\nright-about!\r\n\r\n"Things are getting rather warm!" remarked Hutin.\r\n\r\nEach time the three principals passed the dining-room, the shopmen\r\nwatched them, commenting on their slightest gestures. The baked rice,\r\nin which a cashier had just found a brace-button, was momentarily\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n"I just heard the word \'cravat,\'" said Favier. "And you saw how\r\nBourdoncle\'s face turned pale all at once."\r\n\r\nMouret shared his partner\'s indignation. That a saleswoman should\r\nbe reduced to work at night, seemed to him an attack on the very\r\norganization of The Ladies\' Paradise. Who was the stupid that couldn\'t\r\nearn enough in the business? But when Bouthemont named Denise he\r\nsoftened down, and invented excuses. Ah! yes, that poor little girl;\r\nshe wasn\'t very sharp, and had others dependent on her, it was said.\r\nBourdoncle interrupted him to declare they ought to send her packing\r\nimmediately. They would never do anything with such an ugly creature,\r\nhe had always said so; and he seemed to be indulging a spiteful\r\nfeeling. Thereupon Mouret, in embarrassment, affected to laugh. Dear\r\nme! what a severe man! couldn\'t they forgive her for once? They could\r\ncall in the culprit and give her a scolding. In short, Robineau was\r\nthe one to blame, for he ought to have dissuaded her, he, an old hand,\r\nknowing the ways of the house.\r\n\r\n"Well! there\'s the governor laughing now!" resumed Favier, in\r\nastonishment, as the group again passed the door.\r\n\r\n"Ah, by Jove!" exclaimed Hutin, "if they persist in shoving Robineau on\r\nour shoulders, we\'ll make it lively for them!"\r\n\r\nBourdoncle looked straight at Mouret and then simply made a gesture of\r\ndisdain, to intimate that he saw how it was, and thought it idiotic.\r\nBouthemont meantime resumed his complaints; the salesmen threatened to\r\nleave, and there were some very good men amongst them. However, what\r\nappeared to have most effect on these gentlemen, was the rumour of\r\nRobineau\'s friendly relations with Gaujean; the latter, it was said,\r\nwas urging the former to set up for himself in the neighbourhood,\r\noffering him any amount of credit, to run in opposition to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise. There was a pause. Ah! Robineau thought of showing fight, did\r\nhe! Mouret had become serious, though he affected a certain scorn, and\r\navoided coming to a decision, as if it were matter of no importance.\r\nThey would see, they would speak to him. And he immediately began to\r\njoke with Bouthemont, whose father, arriving from his little shop at\r\nMontpellier two days previously, had almost choked with stupefaction\r\nand rage on seeing the immense hall in which his son reigned. Everyone\r\nwas still laughing about the old man, who, recovering his Southern\r\nassurance, had immediately begun to run everything down, pretending\r\nthat the drapery business would soon go to the dogs.\r\n\r\n"Ah! precisely, here\'s Robineau," said Bouthemont. "I sent him to\r\nattend to some matching so as to avoid any unpleasant occurrence.\r\nExcuse me if I insist, but things have come to such a pass that\r\nsomething must really be done."\r\n\r\nRobineau, who had just come in, passed by the group with a bow, on his\r\nway to the table. Mouret simply repeated: "All right, we\'ll see about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThen all three went off. Hutin and Favier were still watching for\r\nthem, but on seeing that they did not return began to relieve their\r\nfeelings. Did the governor mean to come down like that at every meal,\r\nto count their mouthfuls? A nice thing it would be if they could not\r\neven eat in peace! The truth was, they had just seen Robineau come in,\r\nand the governor\'s good-humour made them anxious about the result of\r\nthe struggle they were engaged in. They lowered their voices, trying to\r\nfind fresh subjects for grumbling.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m dying of hunger!" continued Hutin, aloud. "One is hungrier\r\nthan ever on rising from table!" And yet he had eaten two portions of\r\njam, his own and the one which he had secured in exchange for his plate\r\nof rice. All at once he cried out: "Hang it, I\'m going in for an extra!\r\nVictor, give me another jam!"\r\n\r\nThe waiter was finishing the serving of the desserts. He then brought\r\nin the coffee, and those who took it gave him their three sous there\r\nand then. A few had gone away, dawdling along the corridor and\r\nlooking for a dark corner where they might smoke a cigarette. The\r\nothers remained at table before the greasy plates, rolling pellets of\r\nbread-crumbs and recounting the same old stories, amidst the sickly\r\nodour of victuals, which they could no longer smell, and the sweltering\r\nheat which was reddening their ears. The walls reeked with moisture,\r\na slow asphyxia fell from the mouldy vaulted ceiling. Leaning against\r\nthe wall was Deloche, stuffed with bread and digesting in silence, his\r\neyes on the window. His daily recreation, after luncheon was to watch\r\nthe feet of the passers-by spinning along the street, a continual\r\nprocession of living feet in big shoes, elegant boots, and ladies\' tiny\r\nboots, without either head or body. On rainy days all were very dirty.\r\n\r\n"What! Already?" suddenly exclaimed Hutin.\r\n\r\nA bell had begun to ring at the end of the passage and they had to\r\nmake way for the third lunch. The waiters came in with pails of warm\r\nwater and big sponges to clean the American cloth. Gradually the rooms\r\nemptied and the salesmen returned to their departments, loitering as\r\nthey went up the stairs. In the kitchen, the head cook had resumed his\r\nplace at the wicket, between the pans of skate, beef, and sauce, again\r\narmed with his forks and spoons and ready to fill the plates anew with\r\nthe rhythmical movement of a well-regulated clock. As Hutin and Favier\r\nslowly withdrew, they saw Denise coming down.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Robineau is back, mademoiselle," said the former with\r\nsneering politeness.\r\n\r\n"He is still at table," added the other. "But if you are in a very\r\ngreat hurry you can go in."\r\n\r\nDenise continued on her way without replying or turning round; but\r\nwhen she passed the dining-room of the managers and second-hands, she\r\ncould not help just looking in, and saw that Robineau was really there.\r\nShe resolved that she would try to speak to him in the afternoon, and\r\ncontinued her journey along the corridor to her own dining-room, which\r\nwas at the other end.\r\n\r\nThe women took their meals apart, in two special rooms. Denise\r\nentered the first one. This also was an old cellar, transformed into\r\na refectory; but it had been fitted up with more comfort. On the oval\r\ntable, in the middle of the apartment, the fifteen places were set\r\nfurther apart and the wine was in decanters, a dish of skate and a dish\r\nof beef with pungent sauce occupying the two ends of the table. Waiters\r\nin white aprons moreover attended to the young ladies, and spared them\r\nthe trouble of fetching their portions from the wicket. The manager had\r\nthought this arrangement more seemly.\r\n\r\n"You went round, then?" asked Pauline, already seated and cutting\r\nherself some bread.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Denise, blushing, "I was accompanying a customer."\r\n\r\nBut this was a fib. Clara nudged her neighbour. What was the matter\r\nwith the unkempt girl? She was quite strange in her ways that day. One\r\nafter the other she had received two letters from her lover and then\r\nwent running all over the shop like a madwoman, pretending she was\r\ngoing to the work-room, where she did not even put in an appearance.\r\nThere was something up, that was certain. Then Clara, eating her skate\r\nwithout any show of disgust, with the indifference of a girl who had\r\nbeen used to nothing better than rancid bacon, began speaking of a\r\nfrightful drama, accounts of which filled the newspapers.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve read about that man cutting his mistress\'s throat with a razor,\r\nhaven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Well!" said a little, quiet, delicate-looking girl belonging to the\r\nunder-linen department, "she was unfaithful to him. Serve her right!"\r\n\r\nBut Pauline protested. What! just because you had ceased to love a man,\r\nhe was to be allowed to cut your throat? Ah! no, never! And stopping\r\nall at once, she turned round to the waiter, saying: "Pierre, I can\'t\r\nget through this beef. Just tell them to do me an extra, an omelet,\r\nnice and soft, if possible."\r\n\r\nThen to while away the time, she took out some chocolate which she\r\nbegan eating with her bread, for she always had her pockets full of\r\nsweetmeats.\r\n\r\n"It certainly isn\'t very amusing," resumed Clara. "And some people are\r\nfearfully jealous, you know! Only the other day there was a workman who\r\npitched his wife into a well."\r\n\r\nShe kept her eyes on Denise, thinking she had guessed her trouble on\r\nseeing her turn pale. Evidently that little prude was afraid of being\r\nbeaten by her lover, whom she no doubt deceived. It would be a lark if\r\nhe should come into the shop after her, as she seemed to fear he would.\r\nBut the conversation took another turn, for one of the girls was giving\r\na recipe for cleaning velvet. Then they went on to speak of a piece at\r\nthe Gaiety, in which some lovely little children danced better than any\r\ngrown-up persons. Pauline, saddened for a moment at the sight of her\r\nomelet, which was overdone, recovered her spirits on finding that it\r\ntasted fairly well.\r\n\r\n"Pass the wine," said she to Denise. "You should take an omelet."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the beef is enough for me," replied the young girl, who, in order\r\nto avoid expense, contented herself with the food provided by the\r\nhouse, no matter how repugnant it might be.\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter brought in the baked rice, the other young ladies\r\nprotested. They had refused it the previous week, and had hoped it\r\nwould not appear again. Denise, inattentive, worrying the more about\r\nJean after Clara\'s stories, was the only one to eat it; and all the\r\nothers looked at her with disgust. There was a great demand for extras,\r\nthey gorged themselves with jam. Moreover this was a sort of elegance,\r\nthey considered it aristocratic to feed themselves at their own expense.\r\n\r\n"You know that the gentlemen have complained," said the delicate\r\nlittle girl from the under-linen department, "and the management has\r\npromised----"\r\n\r\nBut the others interrupted her with a burst of laughter, and began\r\nto rail at the management. Coffee was taken by all excepting Denise,\r\nwho couldn\'t bear it, she said. And they lingered there before their\r\ncups, the young ladies from the under-linen department all middle-class\r\nsimplicity in their woollen dresses, and the young ladies from the\r\nmantle department arrayed in silk, their napkins tucked under their\r\nchins, in order not to stain their gowns, like ladies who might have\r\ncome down to the servants\' hall to dine with their chamber-maids.\r\nHaving opened the glazed sash of the air-hole to change the stifling\r\npoisoned air, they were speedily obliged to close it for the cab-wheels\r\nseemed to be passing over the table.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" whispered Pauline; "here\'s that old beast!"\r\n\r\nIt was inspector Jouve, who was rather fond of prowling about at meal\r\ntimes, when the young ladies were there. He was supposed, in fact, to\r\nlook after their dining-rooms. With a smiling face he would come in\r\nand walk round the tables; sometimes he would even indulge in a little\r\ngossip, and inquire if they had made a good lunch. But as he annoyed\r\nthem and made them feel uncomfortable, they all hastened to get away.\r\nAlthough the bell had not rung, Clara was the first to disappear; the\r\nothers followed her, and soon only Denise and Pauline remained. The\r\nlatter, after drinking her coffee, was finishing her chocolate drops.\r\nBut all at once she got up, saying: "I\'m going to send a messenger for\r\nsome oranges. Are you coming?"\r\n\r\n"Presently," replied Denise, who was nibbling at a crust, determined to\r\nwait till the last, so that she might be able to see Robineau on her\r\nway upstairs.\r\n\r\nHowever, when she found herself alone with Jouve she felt uneasy and\r\nannoyed, and quitted the table; but as she was going towards the door\r\nhe stopped her saying: "Mademoiselle Baudu----"\r\n\r\nErect before her, he was smiling with a paternal air. His thick grey\r\nmoustache and short cropped hair gave him a respectable military\r\nappearance; and he threw out his chest, on which was displayed the red\r\nribbon of his decoration.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Monsieur Jouve?" asked she, feeling reassured.\r\n\r\n"I caught you again this morning talking upstairs behind the carpet\r\ndepartment. You know it is not allowed, and if I reported you--She must\r\nbe very fond of you, your friend Pauline." His moustache quivered, and\r\nhis huge nose seemed all aflame. "What makes you so fond of each other,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\nDenise had again been seized with an uneasy feeling. He was getting too\r\nclose, and was speaking in her face.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true we were talking, Monsieur Jouve," she stammered, "but\r\nthere\'s no harm in talking a bit. You are very kind to me, and I\'m very\r\nmuch obliged to you."\r\n\r\n"I ought not to be kind," said he. "Justice, and nothing more, is my\r\nmotto. But when it\'s a pretty girl----"\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he came closer still, and she felt really afraid.\r\nPauline\'s words returned to her memory and she recalled the stories\r\nwhich were told of old Jouve\'s goings-on.\r\n\r\n"Leave me alone," she murmured drawing back.\r\n\r\n"Come," said he, "you are not going to play the savage with me, who\r\nalways treat you so well. Be amiable, come and take a cup of tea and a\r\nslice of bread-and-butter with me this evening. You are very welcome."\r\n\r\nShe was struggling now. "No! no!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room remained empty, the waiter had not come back. Jouve,\r\nlistening for the sound of any footsteps, cast a rapid glance around\r\nhim; and then, very excited, losing all control over himself, he\r\nattempted to kiss her on the neck.\r\n\r\n"What a spiteful, stupid little girl you are!" he said.\r\n\r\nBut she was quite shocked and terrified by the approach of his burning\r\nface, and all at once she gave him so rough a push that he staggered\r\nand nearly fell upon the table. Fortunately, a chair saved him; but in\r\nthe shock, some wine left in a glass spurted on to his white necktie,\r\nand soaked his decoration. And he remained there, without wiping\r\nhimself, choked with anger at such brutality.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you will be sorry for this, on my word of honour!" he growled\r\nbetween his teeth.\r\n\r\nDenise ran away. Just at that moment the bell rang; but sorely\r\nperturbed, still shuddering, she forgot Robineau, and went straight up\r\nto her counter. And she did not dare to go down again. As the sun fell\r\non the frontage of the Place Gaillon of an afternoon, they were soon\r\nall stifling in the first-floor rooms, notwithstanding the grey linen\r\nblinds. A few customers came, put the young ladies into perspiration,\r\nand went away without buying anything. Every one was yawning even\r\nunder Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s big sleepy eyes. At last towards three o\'clock,\r\nDenise, seeing the first-hand falling asleep, quietly slipped off,\r\nand resumed her journey across the shop, with a busy air. To put the\r\ncurious ones, who might be watching her, off the scent, she did not go\r\nstraight to the silk department; pretending that she wanted something\r\namong the laces, she went up to Deloche, and asked him a question; and\r\nthen, on reaching the ground-floor, she passed through the printed\r\ncottons department, and was just going into the cravat gallery, when\r\nshe stopped short, startled and surprised. Jean was before her.\r\n\r\n"What! it\'s you?" she murmured, quite pale.\r\n\r\nHe was wearing his working blouse, and was bare-headed, with his hair\r\nin disorder, its curls falling over his girlish face. Standing before a\r\nshow-case of narrow black neckties, he appeared to be thinking deeply.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" resumed Denise.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" replied he. "I was waiting for you. You won\'t\r\nlet me come. So I came in all the same but haven\'t said anything to\r\nanybody. You may be quite easy. Pretend not to know me, if you like."\r\n\r\nSome salesmen were already looking at them in astonishment. Jean\r\nlowered his voice. "She wanted to come with me, you know. Yes, she is\r\nclose by, opposite the fountain. Give me the fifteen francs quick, or\r\nwe are done for as sure as the sun is shining on us!"\r\n\r\nDenise then lost her head. The lookers-on were grinning, listening\r\nto this adventure. And as behind the cravat department there was a\r\nstaircase leading to the basement, she hastily pushed her brother,\r\nand made him go down. Once below he resumed his story, embarrassed,\r\ninventing his facts as he went on, and fearing that he might not be\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\n"The money is not for her. She is too respectable for that. And as for\r\nher husband, he does not care a straw for fifteen francs. No, it\'s for\r\na low fellow, one of her friends, who saw me kissing her, and if I\r\ndon\'t give him this money this evening----"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet," murmured Denise. "Presently, do get along."\r\n\r\nThey were now in the parcels office. The dead season had steeped the\r\nvast basement in a sort of torpor, in the pale light falling from the\r\nair-holes. It was cool as well, and a silence fell from the ceiling.\r\nHowever, there was a porter collecting from one of the compartments a\r\nfew parcels for the neighbourhood of the Madeleine; and, on the large\r\nsorting-table, sat Campion, the chief clerk, his legs dangling, and his\r\neyes wandering.\r\n\r\nJean began again: "The husband, who has a big knife----"\r\n\r\n"Get along!" repeated Denise, still pushing him forward.\r\n\r\nThey followed one of the narrow passages, where the gas was always kept\r\nburning. In the dark vaults to the right and the left were the reserve\r\ngoods, shadowy behind the gratings. At last she stopped opposite one of\r\nthese. Nobody was likely to pass that way; but the assistants were not\r\nallowed there, and she shuddered.\r\n\r\n"If this rascal says anything," resumed Jean, "the husband, who has a\r\nbig knife----"\r\n\r\n"But where do you expect me to find fifteen francs?" exclaimed Denise\r\nin despair. "Can\'t you be more careful? You\'re always getting into some\r\nstupid scrape!"\r\n\r\nHe struck his chest. Amidst all his romantic inventions he had almost\r\nforgotten the exact truth. He dramatized his pecuniary wants, but there\r\nwas always some immediate necessity behind his display. "By all that\'s\r\nsacred, it\'s really true this time," said he.\r\n\r\nShe stopped him again, and lost her temper, tortured and completely at\r\na loss. "I don\'t want to know," she replied. "Keep your wicked conduct\r\nto yourself. It\'s too bad, you ought to know better! You\'re always\r\ntormenting me. I\'m killing myself to keep you in money. Yes, I have to\r\nstay up all night at work. Not only that, but you are taking the bread\r\nout of your little brother\'s mouth."\r\n\r\nJean stood there with his mouth agape, and his face paling. What! it\r\nwas wicked? And he could not understand; from infancy he had always\r\ntreated his sister like a comrade, and thought it quite a natural thing\r\nto open his heart to her. But what upset him above all else was to\r\nlearn that she stopped up all night. The idea that he was killing her,\r\nand taking P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s share as well, affected him so much that he began to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right; I\'m a scamp," he exclaimed. "Really now, I am quite\r\nfurious with myself! I could slap my face!" He had taken her hands,\r\nand was kissing them and inundating them with tears. "Give me the\r\nfifteen francs, and this shall be the last time, I swear it to you. Or\r\nrather--no!--don\'t give me anything. I prefer to die. If the husband\r\nmurders me it will be a good riddance for you." And as she was now\r\ncrying as well, he became stricken with remorse. "I say that, but of\r\ncourse I\'m not sure. Perhaps he doesn\'t want to kill any one. We\'ll\r\nmanage. I promise you that, little sister. Good-bye, I\'m off."\r\n\r\nHowever, a sound of footsteps at the end of the passage suddenly\r\nfrightened them. She quickly drew him close to the grating, in a\r\ndark corner. For an instant they heard nothing but the hissing of\r\na gas-burner near them. Then the footsteps drew nearer; and, on\r\nstretching out her neck, she recognised inspector Jouve, who had just\r\nentered the corridor, with his stiff military walk. Was he there by\r\nchance, or had some one at the door warned him of Jean\'s presence? She\r\nwas seized with such fright that she quite lost her head; and, pushing\r\nJean out of the dark spot where they were concealed, drove him before\r\nher, stammering out: "Be off! Be off!"\r\n\r\nBoth galloped along, hearing Jouve behind them, for he also had began\r\nto run. And again they crossed the parcels office, and reached the foot\r\nof the stairs leading out into the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n"Be off!" repeated Denise, "be off! If I can, I\'ll send you the fifteen\r\nfrancs all the same."\r\n\r\nJean, bewildered, scampered away. The inspector, who came up panting,\r\nout of breath, could only distinguish a corner of his white blouse, and\r\nhis locks of fair hair flying in the wind. For a moment Jouve remained\r\ntrying to get his breath back and resume his dignified demeanour. He\r\nnow wore a brand-new white necktie which he had purchased in the linen\r\ndepartment and the large bow of which glistened like snow.\r\n\r\n"Well! this is nice behaviour, mademoiselle!" said he, his lips\r\ntrembling. "Yes, it\'s nice, very nice! If you think I\'m going to stand\r\nthis sort of thing you\'re mistaken."\r\n\r\nAnd with this remark he pursued her whilst she was returning to the\r\nshop, overcome with emotion and unable to find a word of defence. She\r\nwas sorry now that she had run away. Why hadn\'t she explained the\r\nmatter, and brought her brother forward? They would now imagine all\r\nsorts of villanies, and, say what she might, they would never believe\r\nher. Once more she forgot Robineau, and went back to her counter,\r\nwhile Jouve repaired to the manager\'s office to report the matter. But\r\nthe messenger on duty told him that Monsieur Mouret was with Monsieur\r\nBourdoncle and Monsieur Robineau; they had been talking together for\r\nthe last quarter of an hour. In fact, the door was half-open, and he\r\ncould hear Mouret gaily asking Robineau if he had spent a pleasant\r\nholiday; there was not the least question of a dismissal--on the\r\ncontrary, the conversation fell on certain things to be done in the\r\nsilk department.\r\n\r\n"Do you want anything, Monsieur Jouve?" exclaimed Mouret. "Come in."\r\n\r\nBut a sudden instinct warned the inspector. As Bourdoncle had come\r\nout, he preferred to relate everything to him; and they slowly passed\r\nthrough the shawl department, walking side by side, the one leaning\r\nover and talking in a low tone, the other listening without a muscle of\r\nhis severe face betraying his impressions.\r\n\r\n"All right," he said at last.\r\n\r\nAnd as they had arrived at the mantle department, he went in. Just at\r\nthat moment Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie was scolding Denise. Where had she come from\r\nagain? This time she couldn\'t say that she had been to the work-room.\r\nReally, these continual absences could not be tolerated any longer.\r\n\r\n"Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie!" cried Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\nHe had decided on a bold stroke, not wishing to consult Mouret, for\r\nfear of some weakness. The first-hand came up, and the story was\r\nonce more related in a low voice. All the girls were waiting in the\r\nexpectation of some catastrophe. At last, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie turned round\r\nwith a solemn air.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Baudu!" she called, and her puffy C\xc3\xa6sarian countenance\r\nassumed the inexorable sternness of sovereign power: "Go and get paid!"\r\n\r\nThe terrible phrase rang out loudly in the empty department. Denise\r\nstood there pale as a ghost, without saying a word. At last she was\r\nable to ask in broken sentences:\r\n\r\n"Me! me! What for? What have I done?"\r\n\r\nBourdoncle harshly replied that she knew very well, that she had better\r\nnot provoke any explanation; and he spoke of the cravats, and added\r\nthat it would be a fine thing if all the young ladies were to receive\r\nmen down in the basement.\r\n\r\n"But it was my brother!" she cried with the grievous anger of an\r\noutraged virgin.\r\n\r\nMarguerite and Clara began to laugh. Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric, usually so\r\ndiscreet, shook her head with an incredulous air. Always her brother!\r\nReally it was very stupid! Denise looked round at all of them: at\r\nBourdoncle, who had taken a dislike to her from the first; Jouve,\r\nwho had stopped to serve as a witness, and from whom she expected no\r\njustice; and then at those girls whom she had not been able to soften\r\nby nine months of smiling courage, who were happy, in fact, to help\r\nin turning her out of doors. What was the use of struggling? what was\r\nthe use of trying to impose herself on them when none of them liked\r\nher? And she went away without a word, not even casting another look\r\nat the room where she had so long battled. But as soon as she was\r\nalone, before the hall staircase, a deeper sense of suffering filled\r\nher heart. No one cared for her, and the sudden thought of Mouret had\r\njust deprived her of all resignation. No! no! she could not accept\r\nsuch a dismissal. Perhaps he would believe that villanous story of a\r\nrendezvous with a man down in the cellars. At this thought, a feeling\r\nof shame tortured her, an anguish with which she had never before been\r\nafflicted. She wished to go and see him to explain the matter to him,\r\nsimply in order to let him know the truth; for she was quite ready to\r\ngo away as soon as he should know it. And her old fear, the shiver\r\nwhich chilled her whenever she was in his presence, suddenly developed\r\ninto an ardent desire to see him, not to leave the house in fact\r\nwithout telling him that she had never belonged to another.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o\'clock, and the shop was waking into life again\r\nin the cool evening air. She quickly started off for Mouret\'s office.\r\nBut when she reached the door, a hopeless, melancholy feeling again\r\ntook possession of her. Her tongue refused its office, the intolerable\r\nburden of existence again fell on her shoulders. He would not believe\r\nher, he would laugh like the others, she thought; and this idea made\r\nher almost faint away. All was over, she would be better alone, out\r\nof the way, dead! And thereupon, without informing either Pauline or\r\nDeloche, she at once went for her money.\r\n\r\n"You have twenty-two days, mademoiselle," said the clerk, "that makes\r\neighteen francs and fourteen sous; to which must be added seven francs\r\nfor commission. That\'s right, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Thanks."\r\n\r\nAnd Denise was about to go off with her money, when she at last met\r\nRobineau. He had already heard of her dismissal, and promised to find\r\nthe necktie-dealer. Then in a lower tone he tried to console her, but\r\nlost his temper: what an existence, to be at the continual mercy of\r\na whim! to be thrown on to the pavement at an hour\'s notice, without\r\neven being able to claim a full month\'s salary. Denise went up to\r\ninform Madame Cabin that she would endeavour to send for her box during\r\nthe evening. It was just striking five when she found herself on the\r\npavement of the Place Gaillon, bewildered, in the midst of the crowd of\r\npeople and vehicles.\r\n\r\nThat same evening when Robineau got home he received a letter from the\r\nmanagement informing him, in a few lines, that for certain reasons\r\nrelating to internal arrangements they were obliged to deprive\r\nthemselves of his services. He had been at The Paradise for seven\r\nyears, and only that afternoon had been talking to the principals. Thus\r\nit was a heavy blow for him. Hutin and Favier, however, were crowing\r\nin the silk department, as loudly as Clara and Marguerite in the other\r\none. A jolly good riddance! Such clean sweeps made room for others!\r\nDeloche and Pauline were the only ones who when they met amidst the\r\ncrush of the galleries exchanged distressful words, in their regret at\r\nthe departure of Denise, so virtuous and gentle.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said the young man, "if ever she succeeds anywhere else, I\r\nshould like to see her come back here, and trample on all those\r\ngood-for-nothing creatures!"\r\n\r\nIt was Bourdoncle who in this affair had to bear the brunt of Mouret\'s\r\nanger. When the latter heard of Denise\'s dismissal, he was exceedingly\r\nannoyed. As a rule he never interfered with the staff; but this time\r\nhe affected to see an encroachment on his attributions, an attempt to\r\nover-ride his authority. Was he no longer master in the place, that\r\nthey dared to give orders? Everything must pass through his hands,\r\nabsolutely everything; and he would immediately crush any one who\r\nshould resist. Then, after making personal inquiries, all the while in\r\na nervous torment which he could not conceal, he again lost his temper.\r\nThe poor girl had not lied; it was really her brother. Campion had\r\nfully recognised him. Why had she been sent away, then? He even spoke\r\nof taking her back.\r\n\r\nHowever, Bourdoncle, strong is his passive resistance, bent before the\r\nstorm. He studied Mouret, and one day when he saw him a little calmer\r\nhe ventured to say in a meaning voice: "It\'s better for everybody that\r\nshe\'s gone."\r\n\r\nMouret stood there looking very awkward, the blood rushing to his face.\r\n"Well!" he replied laughing, "perhaps you\'re right. Let\'s go and take a\r\nturn downstairs. Things are looking better, the receipts rose to nearly\r\na hundred thousand francs yesterday."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment Denise stood bewildered on the pavement, in the sun which\r\nstill shone fiercely at five o\'clock. The July heat warmed the gutters,\r\nParis was blazing with that white chalky light of summer-time, whose\r\nreverberations are so blinding. And the catastrophe had fallen on her\r\nso suddenly, they had turned her out so roughly, that she stood there\r\nturning her money over in her pocket in a mechanical way, while she\r\nwondered where she could go, and what she could do.\r\n\r\nA long line of cabs prevented her from quitting the pavement alongside\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise. When she at last ventured amongst the wheels\r\nshe crossed the Place Gaillon, as if intending to take the Rue\r\nLouis-le-Grand; then altering her mind, she walked towards the Rue\r\nSaint-Roch. But she still had no plan, for she stopped at the corner\r\nof the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, into which she finally turned,\r\nafter looking around her with an undecided air. The Passage Choiseul\r\nopening before her, she passed through it and found herself in the\r\nRue Monsigny, without knowing how, and ultimately came into the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin again. Her head was full of a fearful buzzing, she\r\nthought of her box on seeing a commissionaire; but where could she have\r\nit sent and why all this trouble, when but an hour ago she had still\r\nhad a bed in which to sleep that night?\r\n\r\nThen with her eyes fixed on the houses, she began examining the\r\nwindows. There were any number of bills announcing, "Apartments to\r\nLet." But repeatedly overcome by the emotion which was agitating her\r\nwhole being she saw them confusedly. Was it possible? Thrown into\r\nsolitude so suddenly, lost in this immense city in which she was a\r\nstranger, without support, without resources! She must contrive to\r\neat and sleep, however. The streets succeeded one another, after the\r\nRue des Moulins came the Rue Sainte-Anne. She wandered about the\r\nneighbourhood, frequently retracing her steps, indeed always coming\r\nback to the only spot she knew really well. And suddenly she felt quite\r\nastonished for she was again standing before The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nTo escape this obsession she hurried into the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re.\r\nFortunately Baudu was not at his door. The Old Elbeuf appeared\r\nlifeless, behind its murky windows. She would never have dared to show\r\nherself at her uncle\'s, for he now always pretended not to recognise\r\nher, and she did not wish to become a burden to him, in the misfortune\r\nwhich he had predicted to her. However, on the other side of the\r\nstreet, a yellow bill attracted her attention. "Furnished room to let."\r\nIt was the first that did not frighten her, so poor was the aspect\r\nof the house. She soon recognised it, with its two low storeys, and\r\nrusty-coloured front, squeezed between The Ladies\' Paradise and the old\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard. On the threshold of the umbrella shop, old Bourras,\r\nhairy and bearded like a prophet, and with spectacles on his nose,\r\nstood studying the ivory handle of a walking-stick. Tenanting the whole\r\nhouse, he under-let the two upper floors furnished, in order to lighten\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\n"You have a room to let, sir?" said Denise, approaching him in\r\nobedience to an instinctive impulse.\r\n\r\nHe raised his big bushy eyes, surprised to see her, for he knew all the\r\nyoung persons at The Ladies\' Paradise. And after noticing her clean\r\nlittle gown and respectable appearance, he replied: "It won\'t suit you."\r\n\r\n"How much is it, then?" replied Denise.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen francs a month."\r\n\r\nShe asked to see it. Then on entering the narrow shop, and observing\r\nthat he still eyed her with an astonished air, she told him of her\r\ndeparture from the Paradise and of her desire not to trouble her uncle.\r\nThe old man thereupon fetched a key from a shelf in the back-shop,\r\na small dark room, where he did his cooking and had his bed; beyond\r\nit, through a dirty window, you could espy a back-yard about six feet\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk in front to prevent you from falling," said Bourras,\r\nentering the damp corridor on one side of the shop.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled against a stair, and then commenced the ascent, reiterating\r\nhis warning to be careful. The rail, said he, was close against the\r\nwall, there was a hole at the corner, sometimes the lodgers left their\r\ndust-boxes there. So complete was the obscurity that Denise could\r\ndistinguish nothing, but simply felt how chilly the old damp plaster\r\nwas. On the first floor, however, a small window overlooking the yard\r\nenabled her to obtain a vague glimpse of the rotten staircase, the\r\nwalls black with dirt and the cracked, discoloured doors.\r\n\r\n"If only one of these rooms were vacant," resumed Bourras. "You would\r\nbe very comfortable there. But they are always occupied."\r\n\r\nOn the second floor the light increased, illumining with a raw pallor\r\nthe distressful aspect of the house. A journeyman-baker occupied the\r\nfirst room, and it was the other, the further one, that was vacant.\r\nWhen Bourras had opened the door he was obliged to remain on the\r\nlanding in order that Denise might enter with ease. The bed, placed\r\nin the corner nearest the door, left just sufficient room for one\r\nperson to pass. At the other end there was a small walnut-wood chest\r\nof drawers, a deal table stained black, and two chairs. Such lodgers\r\nas did any cooking were obliged to kneel before the fire-place, where\r\nthere was an earthenware stove.\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s not luxurious," said the old man, "but the view from the\r\nwindow is gay. You can see the people passing in the street." And, as\r\nDenise gazed with surprise at the ceiling just above the bed, where\r\na chance lady-lodger had written her name--Ernestine--by drawing the\r\nflame of a candle over the plaster, he added with a smile: "If I did a\r\nlot of repairs, I should never make both ends meet. There you are; it\'s\r\nall I have to offer."\r\n\r\n"I shall be very well here," declared the young girl.\r\n\r\nShe paid a month in advance, asked for the linen--a pair of sheets\r\nand two towels, and made her bed without delay, happy and relieved to\r\nknow where she would sleep that night. An hour later she had sent a\r\ncommissionaire to fetch her box, and was quite at home.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two months she had a terribly hard time of it. Being\r\nunable to pay for P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s board, she had taken him away, and slept him\r\non an old couch lent by Bourras. She could not do with less than thirty\r\nsous a day, including the rent, even by living on dry bread herself,\r\nin order to procure a bit of meat for the little one. During the first\r\nfortnight she got on fairly well, having begun her housekeeping with\r\nabout ten francs; and then too she was fortunate enough to find the\r\ncravat-dealer, who paid her the eighteen francs six sous which were due\r\nto her. But after that she became completely destitute. In vain did she\r\napply to the various large shops, the Place Clichy, the Bon March\xc3\xa9, and\r\nthe Louvre: the dead season had stopped business everywhere and she\r\nwas told to apply again in the autumn. More than five thousand drapery\r\nemployees, dismissed like herself, were wandering about Paris in want\r\nof situations. She then tried to obtain work elsewhere; but in her\r\nignorance of Paris she did not know where to apply, and often accepted\r\nmost ungrateful tasks, sometimes not even getting paid. On certain\r\nevenings she merely gave P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 his dinner, a plate of soup, telling him\r\nthat she had dined out; and she would go to bed with her head in a\r\nwhirl, nourished by the fever which was burning her hands. When Jean\r\nsuddenly dropped into the midst of this poverty, he called himself a\r\nscoundrel with such despairing violence that she was obliged to tell\r\nsome falsehood to reassure him; and she even occasionally found the\r\nmeans to slip a two-franc piece into his hand, by way of proving that\r\nshe still had money. She never wept before the children. On Sundays,\r\nwhen she was able to cook a piece of veal in the stove, on her knees\r\nbefore the fire, the tiny room re-echoed with the gaiety of children,\r\ncareless about existence. Then, when Jean had returned to his master\'s\r\nand P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 was asleep, she spent a frightful night, in anguish how to\r\nprovide for the coming day.\r\n\r\nOther fears kept her awake. Two women lodging on the first floor\r\nreceived visitors; and sometimes these visitors mistook the floor and\r\ncame banging at Denise\'s door. Bourras having quietly told her not to\r\nanswer, she buried her face under her pillow to escape hearing their\r\noaths. Then, too, her neighbour, the baker, who never came home till\r\nmorning, had shown a disposition to annoy her. But she suffered still\r\nmore from the annoyances of the street, the continual persecution of\r\npassers-by. She could not go downstairs to buy a candle, in those\r\nstreets swarming with debauchees, without feeling a man\'s hot breath\r\nbehind her, and hearing crude, insulting remarks; and some individuals\r\npursued her to the very end of the dark passage, encouraged by the\r\nsordid appearance of the house. Why had she no lover? It astonished\r\npeople and seemed ridiculous. She herself could not have explained why\r\nshe resisted, menaced as she was by hunger, and perturbed by all the\r\nsexuality in the air around her.\r\n\r\nOne evening when Denise had not even any bread for P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s soup, a\r\nwell-dressed man, wearing a decoration, commenced to follow her. On\r\nreaching the passage he became brutal, and it was with loathing and\r\nrevolt that she banged the door in his face. Then, once more upstairs,\r\nshe sat down, with her hands trembling. The little one was sleeping.\r\nWhat should she say if he woke up and asked her for bread? And yet had\r\nshe chosen her misery would have ceased, she could have had money,\r\ndresses, and a fine room. It was very simple, every one came to that,\r\nit was said; for a woman alone in Paris could not live by her labour.\r\nBut her whole being rose up in protest, against the disgrace of the\r\nthing. She considered life a matter of logic, good conduct, and courage.\r\n\r\nDenise frequently questioned herself in this way. An old love story\r\nfloated in her memory, the story of a sailor\'s betrothed whom her\r\nlove guarded from all perils. At Valognes she had often hummed this\r\nsentimental ballad whilst gazing into the deserted street. Had she\r\nlikewise some tender affection in her heart that she proved so brave?\r\nShe still thought of Hutin, full of uneasiness. Morning and evening she\r\nsaw him pass under her window. Now that he was second-hand he walked by\r\nhimself, saluted with respect by the mere salesmen. He never raised his\r\nhead, and she thought she suffered from his vanity. Still she watched\r\nhim without fear of being discovered; whereas, as soon as she saw\r\nMouret, who also passed every day, she began to tremble, and quickly\r\nconcealed herself, her bosom heaving. He had no need to know where she\r\nwas lodging. And then she would feel ashamed of the house, and suffer\r\nat the idea of what he must think of her, although perhaps they would\r\nnever meet again.\r\n\r\nDenise still lived amidst all the hubbub of The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nA mere wall separated her room from her old department; and, from\r\nearly morning, she lived her old days afresh, divining and hearing\r\nthe arrival of the crowd and the increasing bustle of business. The\r\nslightest noise shook the old hovel which clung to the side of the\r\ncolossus, and shared in its pulsations. Moreover, she could not\r\navoid certain meetings. She twice had found herself face to face\r\nwith Pauline, who had offered her services, grieved to see her so\r\nunfortunate; and she had even been obliged to tell a falsehood to avoid\r\nreceiving her friend or paying her a visit, one Sunday, at Baug\xc3\xa9\'s. But\r\nit was more difficult still for her to defend herself against Deloche\'s\r\ndesperate affection; aware of all her troubles, he watched her, waited\r\nfor her in the doorways. One day he wanted to lend her thirty francs, a\r\nbrother\'s savings, he said, with a blush. And these meetings made her\r\nregret the shop, and continually brought her back to thoughts of the\r\nlife the others led there, as if she herself had not quitted it.\r\n\r\nNo one had ever called upon her till one afternoon when she was\r\nsurprised by a knock. It was Colomban. She received him standing. For\r\nhis part he seemed greatly embarrassed and began stammering, asking how\r\nshe was getting on, and speaking of The Old Elbeuf. Perhaps, thought\r\nshe, it was Uncle Baudu who had sent him, regretting his rigour; for\r\nhe continued to pass her without taking any notice of her, although he\r\nwas well aware of her miserable position. However, when she plainly\r\nquestioned her visitor, he appeared more embarrassed than ever. No,\r\nno, it was not the governor who had sent him; and he finished by\r\nnaming Clara--he simply wanted to talk about Clara. Then little by\r\nlittle he grew bolder, and asked Denise\'s advice, imagining no doubt\r\nthat she might be willing to play the part of a go-between. And it\r\nwas in vain that she tried to dishearten him, by reproaching him with\r\nthe pain he was causing Genevi\xc3\xa8ve for such a heartless girl. He came\r\nup another day, indeed got into the habit of coming to see her. This\r\nseemed to suffice for his timid passion; he continually began the same\r\nconversation afresh, unable to resist the impulse and trembling with\r\njoy at finding himself with one who had approached Clara. And all this\r\ncaused Denise to live more than ever at The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September the poor girl experienced the blackest\r\nmisery. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 had fallen ill, having caught a severe cold. He ought to\r\nhave had plenty of good broth, and she had not even a piece of bread to\r\ngive him. One evening, completely conquered, she was sobbing, in one of\r\nthose despairing straits which drive women on to the streets, or into\r\nthe Seine, when old Bourras gently knocked at the door. He had brought\r\nwith him a loaf, and a milk-can full of broth.\r\n\r\n"There! there\'s something for the youngster," said he in his abrupt\r\nway. "Don\'t cry like that; it annoys my lodgers." And as she thanked\r\nhim with a fresh outburst of tears, he resumed: "Do keep quiet! Come\r\nand see me to-morrow. I\'ve some work for you."\r\n\r\nSince the terrible blow which The Ladies\' Paradise had dealt him by\r\nopening an umbrella department, Bourras had ceased to employ any\r\nworkwomen. In order to save expenses he did everything himself,\r\ncleaning, mending, and sewing. His trade moreover was diminishing\r\nto such a point that he sometimes remained without work. And so he\r\nwas obliged to invent some occupation on the following day when he\r\ninstalled Denise in a corner of his shop. He felt, however, that he\r\ncould not allow any one to die of hunger in his house.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have two francs a day," said he. "When you find something\r\nbetter, you can leave me."\r\n\r\nShe was afraid of him, and did the work so quickly that he was\r\nembarrassed to find her more. He had given her some silk to stitch,\r\nsome lace to repair. During the first few days she did not dare to\r\nraise her head, uneasy at feeling him near her, with his lion-like\r\nmane, hooked nose, and piercing eyes, shaded by bushy brows. His\r\nvoice was harsh, his gestures were extravagant, and the mothers of\r\nthe neighbourhood often frightened their youngsters by threatening to\r\nsend for him, as they would for a policeman. However, the boys never\r\npassed his door without calling out some insulting words, which he did\r\nnot even seem to hear. All his maniacal anger was directed against the\r\nscoundrels who dishonoured his trade by selling cheap trashy articles,\r\nwhich dogs, said he, would not consent to use.\r\n\r\nDenise trembled whenever he burst out thus: "Art is done for, I tell\r\nyou! There\'s not a single respectable handle made nowadays. They make\r\nsticks, but as for handles, it\'s all up! Bring me a proper handle, and\r\nI\'ll give you twenty francs!"\r\n\r\nHe had a real artist\'s pride; not a workman in Paris was capable of\r\nturning out a handle like his, as light and as strong. He carved the\r\nknobs with charming ingenuity, continually inventing fresh designs,\r\nflowers, fruit, animals, and heads, all executed in a free and\r\nlife-like style. A little pocket-knife sufficed him and, with his\r\nspectacles on his nose he would spend whole days in chipping bits of\r\nboxwood and ebony.\r\n\r\n"A pack of ignorant beggars," said he, "who are satisfied with sticking\r\na certain quantity of silk on so much whalebone! They buy their handles\r\nby the gross, handles ready-made. And they sell just what they like! I\r\ntell you, art is done for!"\r\n\r\nAt last Denise began to feel easier. He had desired that P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 should\r\ncome down into the shop to play, for he was wonderfully fond of\r\nchildren. When the little one was crawling about on all-fours, neither\r\nof them had room to move. She sat in her corner doing the mending, he\r\nnear the window, carving away with his little knife. Every day now\r\nbrought round the same work and the same conversation. Whilst working,\r\nhe would continually assail The Ladies\' Paradise; never weary of\r\nexplaining how affairs stood in the terrible duel between that bazaar\r\nand himself. He had occupied his house since 1845, and had a thirty\r\nyears\' lease of it at a rent of eighteen hundred francs a year; and, as\r\nhe made a thousand francs out of his four furnished rooms, he only paid\r\neight hundred for the shop. It was a mere trifle, he had no expenses,\r\nand could thus hold out for a long time still. To hear him, there was\r\nno doubt about his eventual triumph; he would certainly swallow up the\r\nmonster. Then suddenly he would break off to ask:\r\n\r\n"Have they got any dog\'s heads like that?"\r\n\r\nAnd he would blink his eyes behind his glasses, whilst judging the\r\ndog\'s head which he was carving, with its lip turned up and its fangs\r\ndisplayed, in a life-like growl. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 delighted with the dog, would\r\nthereupon get up, resting his two little arms on the old man\'s knee.\r\n\r\n"As long as I make both ends meet I don\'t care a hang about the rest,"\r\nthe latter resumed, whilst delicately shaping the dog\'s tongue with the\r\npoint of his knife. "The scoundrels have taken away my profits; but\r\nif I\'m making nothing I\'m not losing anything yet, or at least only a\r\ntrifle. And, you see, I\'m ready to sacrifice everything rather than\r\nyield."\r\n\r\nThereupon he would brandish his knife, and his white hair would blow\r\nabout in a storm of anger.\r\n\r\n"But if they made you a reasonable offer," Denise would mildly observe,\r\nwithout raising her eyes from her needle, "it would be wiser to accept\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, however, only produced an outburst of ferocious\r\nobstinacy. "Never! If my head were under the knife I should still say\r\nno, by heavens I would! I\'ve another ten years\' lease, and they shan\'t\r\nhave the house before then, even if I should have to die of hunger\r\nwithin the four bare walls. Twice already they\'ve tried to get over me.\r\nThey offered me twelve thousand francs for my good-will, and eighteen\r\nthousand francs for the last ten years of my lease; in all thirty\r\nthousand. But no, no--not for fifty thousand even! I have them in my\r\npower, and intend to see them licking the dust before me!"\r\n\r\n"Thirty thousand francs! it\'s a good sum," thereupon resumed Denise.\r\n"You could go and establish yourself elsewhere. And suppose they were\r\nto buy the house?"\r\n\r\nBourras, now putting the finishing touches to his dog\'s tongue,\r\nappeared absorbed for a moment, a childish laugh pervading his\r\nvenerable, prophet\'s face. Then he continued: "The house, no fear! They\r\nspoke of buying it last year, and offered eighty thousand francs, twice\r\nas much as it\'s worth. But the landlord, a retired fruiterer, as big a\r\nscoundrel as they, wanted to make them shell out more. Besides, they\r\nare suspicious about me; they know I should then be even less inclined\r\nto give way. No! no! here I am, and here I intend to stay. The emperor\r\nwith all his cannon could not turn me out."\r\n\r\nDenise did not dare to say any more, but went on with her work, whilst\r\nthe old man continued to vent short sentences, between two cuts of his\r\nknife; now muttering something to the effect that the game had hardly\r\nbegun; and then that they would see wonderful things later on, for he\r\nhad certain plans which would sweep their umbrella counter away; and,\r\ndeeply blended with his obstinacy, you detected the personal revolt of\r\nthe skilled manufacturer against the growing invasion of commonplace\r\nrubbish. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, however, at last climbed on his knees, and impatiently\r\nstretched out his hands towards the dog\'s head.\r\n\r\n"Give it me, sir."\r\n\r\n"Presently, youngster," the old man replied in a voice that suddenly\r\nbecame softer. "He hasn\'t any eyes as yet; we must make his eyes now."\r\nAnd whilst carving the eyes he continued talking to Denise. "Do you\r\nhear them? Isn\'t there a roar next door? That\'s what exasperates me\r\nmore than anything, my word of honour! to have them always on my back\r\nlike this with their infernal locomotive-like noise."\r\n\r\nIt made his little table tremble, he asserted. The whole shop was\r\nshaken, and he would spend the entire afternoon without a customer of\r\nhis own but amidst all the trepidation of the jostling multitude in The\r\nLadies\' Paradise. From morning to night this was a subject for eternal\r\ngrumbling. Another good day\'s work; they were knocking against the\r\nwall, the silk department must have cleared ten thousand francs; or\r\nelse he made merry, not a sound came from behind the wall, a showery\r\nday had killed the receipts. And the slightest stir, the faintest\r\nvibration, thus furnished him with matter for endless comment.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear? some one has slipped down! Ah, if they could only all\r\nfall and break their backs!--That, my dear, is a dispute between\r\nsome ladies. So much the better! So much the better!--Ah! you hear\r\nthe parcels falling into the basement? What a row they make. It\'s\r\ndisgusting!"\r\n\r\nIt did not do for Denise to discuss his remarks, for he bitterly\r\nretorted by reminding her of the shameful way in which she had been\r\ndismissed. For the hundredth time she was obliged to relate her life\r\nin the jacket and mantle department, the hardships she had at first\r\nendured, the small unhealthy bedrooms, the bad food, and the continual\r\nbattle between the salesmen; and thus they would talk about the shop\r\nfrom morning to night, absorbing it hourly in the very air they\r\nbreathed.\r\n\r\nBut with eager, outstretched hands P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 repeated: "Give it me, sir,\r\ngive it me!"\r\n\r\nThe dog\'s head was finished and Bourras held it at a distance, then\r\nexamined it closely with noisy glee. "Take care, it will bite you!" he\r\nsaid, "there, go and play, and don\'t break it, if you can help it."\r\nThen speedily reverting to his fixed idea, he shook his fist at the\r\nwall. "You may do all you can to knock the house down," he exclaimed.\r\n"You shan\'t have it, even if you invade the whole street!"\r\n\r\nDenise now had something to eat each day, and she was extremely\r\ngrateful to the old umbrella-dealer, realizing that he had a good heart\r\nbeneath his strange, violent ways. Nevertheless she felt a strong\r\ndesire to find some work elsewhere, for she often saw him inventing\r\nsome trifle for her to do and fully understood that he did not require\r\na workwoman in the present collapse of his business, and was merely\r\nemploying her out of charity. Six months had passed thus, and the dull\r\nwinter season having again returned, she was despairing of finding a\r\nsituation before March, when, one evening in January, Deloche, who was\r\nwatching for her in a doorway, gave her a bit of advice. Why did she\r\nnot call on Robineau; perhaps he might want some one?\r\n\r\nDuring the previous September, Robineau, though fearing to jeopardize\r\nhis wife\'s sixty thousand francs, had made up his mind to buy Vin\xc3\xa7ard\'s\r\nsilk-business. He had paid forty thousand for the good-will and stock,\r\nand was starting with the remaining twenty thousand. It was not much,\r\nbut he had Gaujean behind him to back him up with any amount of credit.\r\nGaujean ever since his quarrel with The Ladies\' Paradise had been\r\nlonging to stir up competitors against the colossus; and he thought\r\nvictory certain, by creating special shops in the neighbourhood, where\r\nthe public would find a large and varied choice of articles. Only the\r\nvery rich Lyons manufacturers, such as Dumonteil, could accept the\r\nbig shops\' terms, satisfied to keep their looms going with them, and\r\nseeking their profits in their sales to less important establishments.\r\nBut Gaujean was far from having the solidity and staying power\r\npossessed by Dumonteil. For a long time a mere commission agent, it\r\nwas only during the last five or six years that he had possessed looms\r\nof his own, and he still had a lot of his work done by piece-workers,\r\nfurnishing them with the raw material and paying them by the yard. It\r\nwas precisely this system which, increasing his manufacturing expenses,\r\nhad prevented him from competing with Dumonteil for the supply of the\r\nParis Delight. This had filled him with rancour, and he saw in Robineau\r\nthe instrument of a decisive battle with those drapery bazaars which he\r\naccused of ruining French manufactures.\r\n\r\nWhen Denise called she found Madame Robineau alone. Daughter of an\r\noverseer in the Highways and Bridges Service, entirely ignorant\r\nof business matters, the young wife still retained the charming\r\nawkwardness of a girl educated in a convent. She was dark, very pretty,\r\nwith a gentle, cheerful manner, which made her extremely charming.\r\nMoreover she adored her husband, living solely by his love. Just as\r\nDenise was about to leave her name Robineau himself came in, and at\r\nonce engaged her, one of his two saleswomen having left him on the\r\nprevious day to go to The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t leave us a single good hand," said he. "However, I shall\r\nfeel quite easy with you, for you are like me, you can\'t be very fond\r\nof them. Come to-morrow."\r\n\r\nIn the evening Denise hardly knew how to announce her departure to\r\nBourras. In fact, he called her an ungrateful girl, and lost his\r\ntemper. And when, with tears in her eyes, she tried to defend herself\r\nby intimating that she could see through his charitable conduct, he\r\nsoftened down, stammered that he had plenty of work, that she was\r\nleaving him indeed just as he was about to bring out a new umbrella of\r\nhis invention.\r\n\r\n"And P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThis was Denise\'s great trouble; she dared not take him back to Madame\r\nGras, and could not leave him alone in the bedroom, shut up from\r\nmorning to night.\r\n\r\n"Very good, I\'ll keep him," said the old man; "he\'ll be all right in\r\nmy shop. We\'ll do the cooking together." And then as she refused the\r\noffer fearing that it might inconvenience him, he thundered out: "Great\r\nheavens! have you no confidence in me? I shan\'t eat your child!"\r\n\r\nDenise was much happier at Robineau\'s. He only paid her sixty francs\r\na month, with her board, without giving her any commission on the\r\nsales, that not being the rule in the old-fashioned houses; but she\r\nwas treated with great kindness, especially by Madame Robineau who was\r\nalways smiling at her counter. He, nervous and worried, was sometimes\r\nrather abrupt. At the expiration of the first month, Denise had\r\nbecome quite one of the family, like the other saleswoman, a silent,\r\nconsumptive, little body. The Robineaus were not at all particular\r\nbefore them, but freely talked of the business whilst at table in the\r\nback-shop, which looked on to a large yard. And it was there they\r\ndecided one evening to start the campaign against The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nGaujean had come to dinner and, after the roast leg of mutton, had\r\nbroached the subject in his Lyonese voice, thickened by the Rh\xc3\xb4ne fogs.\r\n\r\n"It\'s getting unbearable," said he. "They go to Dumonteil, purchase the\r\nsole right to a design, and take three hundred pieces straight off,\r\ninsisting on a reduction of half a franc a yard; and, as they pay ready\r\nmoney, they also secure the profit of eighteen per cent. discount. Very\r\noften Dumonteil barely makes four sous a yard out of it. He simply\r\nworks to keep his looms going, for a loom that stands still is a dead\r\nloss. Under these circumstances how can you expect that we, with our\r\nlimited plant, and our piece-workers, can keep up the struggle?"\r\n\r\nRobineau, pensive, forgot his dinner. "Three hundred pieces!" he\r\nmurmured. "I tremble when I take a dozen, and at ninety days too.\r\nThey can sell at a franc or two francs cheaper than we can. I have\r\ncalculated that their catalogued articles are offered at fifteen per\r\ncent. less than our own prices. That\'s what kills the small Houses."\r\n\r\nHe was passing through a period of discouragement. His wife, full of\r\nanxiety, looked at him with a loving air. She understood very little\r\nabout the business, all these figures confused her; she could not\r\nunderstand why people worried over things so much, when it was so easy\r\nto be gay and love one another. However, it sufficed that her husband\r\ndesired to conquer, and she became as impassioned as he himself, and\r\nwould have stood to her counter till death.\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t all the manufacturers come to an understanding\r\ntogether?" resumed Robineau, violently. "They could then lay down the\r\nlaw, instead of submitting to it."\r\n\r\nGaujean, who had asked for another slice of mutton, was slowly chewing.\r\n"Ah! why, why? The looms must be kept going, I tell you. When you have\r\nweavers a little bit everywhere, in the neighbourhood of Lyons, in the\r\nGard, in the Is\xc3\xa8re, you can\'t stand still a day without an enormous\r\nloss. Then we who sometimes employ piece-workers with ten or fifteen\r\nlooms of their own are better able to control our output, whereas the\r\nbig manufacturers are obliged to have continual outlets, the quickest\r\nand most extensive possible. And so they are on their knees before the\r\nbig shops. I know three or four who out-bid each other, and who would\r\nsooner work at a loss than not obtain the orders. But they make up for\r\nit with the small establishments like yours. Yes, if they manage to\r\nlive through the big places, they make their profit out of you little\r\nfellows. Heaven knows how the crisis will end!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s odious!" exclaimed Robineau, relieved by this cry of anger.\r\n\r\nDenise was quietly listening. With her instinctive love of logic and\r\nlife she was secretly in favour of the big shops.\r\n\r\nThey had relapsed into silence, and were eating some preserved French\r\nbeans, when at last she ventured to remark in a cheerful tone: "The\r\npublic does not complain."\r\n\r\nAt this Madame Robineau could not restrain a little laugh, which\r\nannoyed both her husband and Gaujean. No doubt the customer was\r\nsatisfied, for, in the end, it was the customer who profited by\r\nthe fall in prices. But everybody must live; where would they all\r\nbe if, under the pretext of conducing to the general welfare, the\r\nconsumer was fattened at the expense of the producer? And then began\r\na long discussion. Denise affected to be joking, though all the\r\nwhile producing solid arguments. By the new system the middle-men\r\ndisappeared, and this greatly contributed to cheapen the articles;\r\nbesides, the manufacturers could no longer live without the big\r\nshops, for as soon as one of them lost their custom, failure became a\r\ncertainty; in short, it was a natural commercial evolution. It would\r\nbe impossible to prevent things from going on as they ought to, when\r\neverybody was working towards that result, whether they liked it or not.\r\n\r\n"So you are for those who turned you out into the street?" thereupon\r\nasked Gaujean.\r\n\r\nDenise became very red. She herself was surprised at the vivacity of\r\nher defence. What had she at heart, that such a flame should have risen\r\nin her breast?\r\n\r\n"Dear me, no!" she replied. "Perhaps I\'m wrong, for you are more\r\ncompetent to judge than I. I simply express my opinion. The prices,\r\ninstead of being settled by fifty houses as they formerly used to be,\r\nare now fixed by four or five, which have lowered them, thanks to the\r\npower of their capital, and the strength of their immense custom. So\r\nmuch the better for the public, that\'s all!"\r\n\r\nRobineau was not angry, but had become grave, and had fixed his eyes\r\non the table-cloth. He had often felt the force of the new style of\r\nbusiness, the evolution which the young girl spoke about; and in his\r\nclear, quiet moments he would ask himself why he should try to resist\r\nsuch a powerful current, which must carry everything before it. Madame\r\nRobineau herself, on seeing her husband deep in thought, glanced with\r\napproval at Denise, who had modestly resumed her silent attitude.\r\n\r\n"Come," resumed Gaujean, to cut short the argument, "all that is simply\r\ntheory. Let\'s talk of our matter."\r\n\r\nAfter the cheese, the servant brought in some jam and some pears. He\r\ntook some jam, and ate it with a spoon, with the unconscious greediness\r\nof a big man very fond sweet things.\r\n\r\n"This is it," he resumed, "you must attack their Paris Delight, which\r\nhas been their success of the year. I have come to an understanding\r\nwith several of my brother manufacturers at Lyons, and have brought you\r\nan exceptional offer--a black silk, a faille which you can sell at five\r\nfrancs fifty centimes a m\xc3\xaatre. They sell theirs at five francs sixty,\r\ndon\'t they? Well! this will be two sous cheaper, and that will suffice\r\nto upset them."\r\n\r\nAt this Robineau\'s eyes lighted up again. In his continual nervous\r\ntorment, he often skipped like this from despair to hope. "Have you\r\ngot a sample?" he asked. And when Gaujean drew from his pocket-book a\r\nlittle square of silk, he went into raptures, exclaiming: "Why, this\r\nis a handsomer silk than the Paris Delight! At all events it produces\r\na better effect, the grain is coarser. You are right, we must make the\r\nattempt. Ah! I\'ll bring them to my feet or give up for good!"\r\n\r\nMadame Robineau, sharing the enthusiasm, declared the silk superb,\r\nand even Denise herself thought they might succeed. The latter part\r\nof the dinner thus proved very gay. They talked in a loud tone; it\r\nseemed as if The Ladies\' Paradise was at its last gasp. Gaujean, who\r\nwas finishing the pot of jam, explained what enormous sacrifices he\r\nand his colleagues would be obliged to make to deliver an article of\r\nsuch quality at so low a price; but they would ruin themselves rather\r\nthan yield; they had sworn to kill the big shops. As the coffee came in\r\nthe gaiety was still further increased by the arrival of Vin\xc3\xa7ard who\r\ncalled, on his way past, just to see how his successor was getting on.\r\n\r\n"Famous!" he cried, feeling the silk. "You\'ll floor them, I stake my\r\nlife! Ah! you owe me a rare good thing; I told you that this was a\r\ngolden affair!"\r\n\r\nHe had just taken a restaurant at Vincennes. It was an old, cherished\r\nidea of his, slyly nurtured while he was struggling with his silk\r\nbusiness, trembling with fear lest he should not sell it before the\r\ncrash came, and vowing that he would afterwards put his money into\r\nsome undertaking where he could rob folks at his ease. The idea of a\r\nrestaurant had struck him at the wedding of a cousin, who had been\r\nmade to pay ten francs for a tureen of dish water, in which floated\r\nsome Italian paste. And, in presence of the Robineaus, the joy he felt\r\nat having saddled them with an unremunerative business, which he had\r\ndespaired of getting rid of, made his face with its round eyes and\r\nlarge loyal-looking mouth, a face beaming with health, expand as it had\r\nnever done before.\r\n\r\n"And your pains?" asked Madame Robineau, good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n"My pains?" he murmured, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, those rheumatic pains which tormented you so much when you were\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nHe then recollected the fibs he had told and slightly coloured. "Oh!\r\nI suffer from them still!" said he. "But the country air, you know,\r\nhas done me a deal of good. Never mind, on your side you\'ve done a\r\ngood stroke of business. Had it not been for my rheumatics, I could\r\nsoon have retired with ten thousand francs a year. Yes, on my word of\r\nhonour!"\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, the battle between Robineau and The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nbegan. It became celebrated, and for a time occupied the whole Parisian\r\nmarket. Robineau, using his adversary\'s weapons, had advertised\r\nextensively in the newspapers. Besides that, he made a fine display,\r\npiling huge bales of the famous silk in his windows and displaying\r\nimmense white tickets, on which the price, five francs and a half per\r\nm\xc3\xaatre, appeared in gigantic figures. It was this price that caused a\r\nrevolution among the women; it was two sous less than that charged at\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise, and the silk appeared more substantial. From the\r\nfirst day a crowd of customers flocked in. Madame Marty bought a dress\r\nshe did not need, pretending it to be a bargain; Madame Bourdelais\r\nalso thought the silk very fine, but preferred waiting, guessing\r\nno doubt what would happen. And, indeed during the following week,\r\nMouret boldly reduced the price of The Paris Delight by four sous,\r\nafter a lively discussion with Bourdoncle and the other managers,\r\nin which he had succeeded in convincing them that they must accept\r\nthe challenge, even at a sacrifice; for these four sous represented\r\na dead loss, the silk being already sold at strict cost price. It\r\nwas a heavy blow to Robineau, who had not imagined that his rival\r\nwould lower his price; for this suicidal style of competition, this\r\npractice of selling at a loss, was then unknown. However, the tide\r\nof customers, attracted by Mouret\'s cheapness, had immediately flown\r\nback towards the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, whilst the shop in the Rue\r\nNeuve-des-Petits-Champs gradually emptied.\r\n\r\nGaujean then hastened from Lyons; there were hurried confabulations,\r\nand they finished by coming to a heroic resolution; the silk should\r\nbe lowered in price, they would sell it at five francs six sous, and\r\nlower than that no one could go, without acting madly. But the next\r\nday Mouret marked his material at five francs four sous. Then the\r\nstruggle became rageful. Robineau replied by five francs three sous,\r\nwhereupon Mouret at once ticketed The Paris Delight at five francs and\r\ntwo sous. Neither lowered more than a sou at a time now, for both lost\r\nconsiderable sums as often as they made this present to the public.\r\nThe customers laughed, delighted with this duel, quite stirred by the\r\nterrible thrusts which the rivals dealt one another in order to please\r\nthem. At last Mouret ventured as low as five francs; and his staff\r\npaled and shuddered at such a challenge to fortune. Robineau, utterly\r\nbeaten, out of breath, also stopped at five francs, not having the\r\ncourage to go any lower. And thus they rested on their positions, face\r\nto face, with the massacre of their goods around them.\r\n\r\nBut if honour was saved on both sides, the situation was becoming\r\nfatal for Robineau. The Ladies\' Paradise had money at its disposal\r\nand a patronage which enabled it to balance its profits; whereas he,\r\nsustained by Gaujean alone, unable to recoup his losses by gaining on\r\nother articles, found himself nearing the end of his tether, slipping\r\nfurther and further down the slope toward bankruptcy. He was dying from\r\nhis hardihood, despite the numerous customers whom the hazards of the\r\nstruggle had brought him. One of his secret worries was to see these\r\ncustomers slowly quitting him, returning to The Ladies\' Paradise, after\r\nall the money he had lost in the efforts he had made to secure them.\r\n\r\nOne day he quite lost patience. A customer, Madame de Boves, had\r\ncalled at his shop for some mantles, for he had added a ready-made\r\ndepartment to his business. She would not come to a decision, however,\r\nbut complained of the quality of the material, and at last exclaimed:\r\n"Their Paris Delight is a great deal stronger."\r\n\r\nRobineau restrained himself, assuring her that she was mistaken with a\r\ntradesman\'s politeness, all the more respectful, moreover, as he feared\r\nto reveal his inward revolt.\r\n\r\n"But just look at the silk of this cloak!" she resumed, "one would\r\nreally take it for so much cobweb. You may say what you like, sir, but\r\ntheir silk at five francs is like leather compared with this."\r\n\r\nHe did not reply; with the blood rushing to his face, he kept his lips\r\ntightly closed. In point of fact he had ingeniously thought of buying\r\nsome of his rival\'s silk for these mantles; so that it was Mouret, not\r\nhe, who lost on the material. And to conceal his practice he simply cut\r\noff the selvage.\r\n\r\n"Really," he murmured at last, "you think the Paris Delight thicker?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! a hundred times!" said Madame de Boves. "There\'s no comparison."\r\n\r\nThis injustice on her part, this fixed determination to run down the\r\ngoods in spite of all evidence filled him with indignation. And, as she\r\nwas still turning the mantle over with a disgusted air, a little bit of\r\nthe blue and silver selvage, which through carelessness had not been\r\ncut off, appeared under the lining. Thereupon he could not restrain\r\nhimself any longer; but confessed the truth at all hazards.\r\n\r\n"Well, madame, this is Paris Delight. I bought it myself! Look at the\r\nselvage."\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves went away greatly annoyed, and a number of customers\r\nquitted him, for the affair became known. And he, amid this ruin, when\r\nfear for the future came upon him, only trembled for his wife, who had\r\nbeen brought up in a happy, peaceful home, and would never be able to\r\nendure a life of poverty. What would become of her if a catastrophe\r\nshould throw them into the street, with a load of debts? It was his\r\nfault, he ought never to have touched her money. She was obliged to\r\ncomfort him. Wasn\'t the money as much his as hers? He loved her dearly,\r\nand she wanted nothing more; she gave him everything, her heart and her\r\nlife. They could be heard embracing one another in the back shop. Then,\r\nlittle by little, the affairs of the house got into a regular groove;\r\neach month the losses increased, but with a slowness which postponed\r\nthe fatal issue. A tenacious hope sustained them, and they still\r\npredicted the approaching discomfiture of The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" he would say, "we are young yet. The future is ours."\r\n\r\n"And besides, what matters, if you have done what you wanted to do?"\r\nshe resumed. "As long as you are satisfied, I am as well, darling."\r\n\r\nDenise\'s affection for them increased on seeing their tenderness.\r\nShe trembled, divining their inevitable fall; however, she dared not\r\ninterfere. And it was here that she ended by fully understanding the\r\npower of the new system of business, and became impassioned for this\r\nforce which was transforming Paris. Her ideas were ripening, a woman\'s\r\ngrace was being evolved from the wildness of a child freshly arrived\r\nfrom Valognes. Her life too was a pretty pleasant one, notwithstanding\r\nits fatigue and the little money she earned. When she had spent all\r\nthe day on her feet, she had to go straight home, and look after P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9,\r\nwhom old Bourras fortunately insisted on feeding; but there was still\r\na lot to do; a shirt to wash, a blouse to mend; without mentioning the\r\nnoise made by the youngster, which made her head ache fit to split.\r\nShe never went to bed before midnight. Sunday was her hardest day: for\r\nshe then cleaned her room, and mended her own things, so busy that it\r\nwas often five o\'clock before she could comb her hair. However, she\r\nsometimes went out for health\'s sake, taking the little one for a long\r\nwalk, out towards Neuilly; and their treat over there was to drink a\r\ncup of milk at a dairyman\'s, who allowed them to sit down in his yard.\r\nJean disdained these excursions; he put in an appearance now and again\r\non week-day evenings and then disappeared, pretending he had other\r\nvisits to pay. He asked for no more money, but he arrived with such a\r\nmelancholy countenance, that his anxious sister always managed to keep\r\na five-franc piece for him. That was her sole luxury.\r\n\r\n"Five francs!" he would exclaim each time. "My stars! you\'re too good!\r\nIt just happens, there\'s the----"\r\n\r\n"Not another word," Denise would say; "I don\'t want to know."\r\n\r\nThree months passed away, spring was coming back. However Denise\r\nrefused to return to Joinville with Pauline and Baug\xc3\xa9. She sometimes\r\nmet them in the Rue Saint-Roch, on leaving the shop in the evening.\r\nPauline, on one occasion when she was alone, confided to her that she\r\nwas perhaps going to marry her lover; it was she who was hesitating,\r\nfor they did not care for married saleswomen at The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nThis idea of marriage surprised Denise and she did not dare to advise\r\nher friend. Then one day, just as Colomban had stopped her near the\r\nfountain to talk about Clara, the latter tripped across the road; and\r\nDenise was obliged to run away, for he implored her to ask her old\r\ncomrade if she would marry him. What was the matter with them all? why\r\nwere they tormenting themselves like this? She thought herself very\r\nfortunate not to be in love with anybody.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heard the news?" the umbrella dealer said to her one evening on\r\nher return from business.\r\n\r\n"No, Monsieur Bourras."\r\n\r\n"Well! the scoundrels have bought the H\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard. I\'m hemmed in on\r\nall sides!" He was waving his long arms about, in a burst of fury which\r\nmade his white mane stand up on end. "A regular underhand affair,"\r\nhe resumed. "But it seems that the hotel belonged to the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier, whose president, Baron Hartmann, has just sold it to our\r\nfamous Mouret. And now they\'ve got me on the right, on the left, and at\r\nthe back, just in the way that I\'m holding the knob of this stick in my\r\nhand!"\r\n\r\nIt was true, the sale must have been concluded on the previous day.\r\nBourras\'s small house, hemmed in between The Ladies\' Paradise and the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard, clinging there like a swallow\'s nest in a crack of\r\na wall, seemed certain to be crushed, as soon as the shop galleries\r\nshould invade the h\xc3\xb4tel. And the time had now arrived, the colossus had\r\noutflanked the feeble obstacle, and was investing it with its piles of\r\ngoods, threatening to swallow it up, absorb it by the sole force of\r\nits giant aspiratory powers. Bourras could well feel the close embrace\r\nwhich was making his shop creak. He thought he could see the place\r\ngetting smaller; he was afraid of being absorbed himself, of being\r\ncarried off into kingdom come with his sticks and umbrellas, so loudly\r\nwas the terrible machine now roaring.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear them?" he asked. "One would think they were eating the\r\nvery walls! And in my cellar and in the attic, everywhere, there\'s the\r\nsame noise--like that of a saw cutting through the plaster. But never\r\nmind! They won\'t flatten me as easily as they might a sheet of paper. I\r\nshall stick here, even if they blow up my roof, and the rain falls in\r\nbucketfuls on my bed!"\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that Mouret caused fresh proposals to\r\nbe made to Bourras; they would increase the figure of their offer,\r\nthey would give him fifty thousand francs for his good-will and the\r\nremainder of his lease. But this offer redoubled the old man\'s anger;\r\nhe refused in an insulting manner. How those scoundrels must rob people\r\nto be able to pay fifty thousand francs for a thing which wasn\'t worth\r\nten thousand! And he defended his shop as a young girl defends her\r\nvirtue, for honour\'s sake.\r\n\r\nDenise noticed that Bourras was pre-occupied during the next fortnight.\r\nHe wandered about in a feverish manner, measuring the walls of his\r\nhouse, surveying it from the middle of the street with the air of\r\nan architect. Then one morning some workmen arrived. This was the\r\ndecisive blow. He had conceived the bold idea of beating The Ladies\'\r\nParadise on its own ground by making certain concessions to modern\r\nluxury. Customers, who had often reproached him for the darkness of\r\nhis shop, would certainly come back to it again, when they saw it\r\nall bright and new. In the first place, the workmen stopped up the\r\ncrevices and whitewashed the frontage, then they painted the woodwork\r\na light green, and even carried the splendour so far as to gild the\r\nsign-board. A sum of three thousand francs, held in reserve by Bourras\r\nas a last resource, was swallowed up in this way. Moreover, the whole\r\nneighbourhood was revolutionized by it all, people came to look at\r\nhim losing his head amid all these riches, and no longer able to find\r\nthe things he was accustomed to. He did not seem to be at home in\r\nthat bright frame, that tender setting; he looked quite scared, with\r\nhis long beard and white hair. On the opposite side of the street\r\npassers-by lingered in astonishment at seeing him waving his arms\r\nabout while he carved his handles. And he was in a state of fever,\r\nperpetually afraid of dirtying his shop, more and more at sea amidst\r\nthis luxury which he did not at all understand.\r\n\r\nMeantime, as at Robineau\'s, so at Bourras\'s was the campaign against\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise carried on. Bourras had just brought out his\r\ninvention, the automatic umbrella, which later on was to become\r\npopular. But The Paradise people immediately improved on the invention,\r\nand a struggle of prices began. Bourras had an article at one franc\r\nand nineteen sous, in zanella, with a steel mounting, an everlasting\r\narticle said the ticket. But he was especially anxious to vanquish his\r\ncompetitors with his handles of bamboo, dogwood, olive, myrtle, rattan,\r\nindeed every imaginable sort of handle. The Paradise people, less\r\nartistic, paid more attention to the material, extolling their alpacas\r\nand mohairs, twills and sarcenets. And they came out victorious.\r\nBourras, in despair, repeated that art was done for, that he was\r\nreduced to carving his handles for the pleasure of doing so, without\r\nany hope of selling them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my fault!" he cried to Denise. "I never ought to have kept a lot\r\nof rotten articles, at one franc nineteen sous! That\'s where these new\r\nnotions lead one to. I wanted to follow the example of those brigands;\r\nso much the better if I\'m ruined by it!"\r\n\r\nThe month of July proved very warm, and Denise suffered greatly in her\r\ntiny room under the roof. So, after leaving the shop, she sometimes\r\nwent to fetch P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, and instead of going up-stairs at once, took a\r\nstroll in the Tuileries Gardens until the gates closed. One evening\r\nas she was walking towards the chestnut-trees she suddenly stopped\r\nshort with surprise: for a few yards off, coming straight towards her,\r\nshe fancied she recognised Hutin. But her heart commenced to beat\r\nviolently. It was Mouret, who had dined on the other side of the river\r\nand was hurrying along on foot to call on Madame Desforges. At the\r\nabrupt movement which she made to escape him, he caught sight of her.\r\nThe night was coming on, but still he recognised her clearly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s you, mademoiselle!" he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, astonished that he should deign to stop. He,\r\nsmiling, concealed his constraint beneath an air of amiable protection.\r\n"You are still in Paris?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said she at last.\r\n\r\nShe was slowly drawing back, desirous of making a bow and continuing\r\nher walk. But he abruptly turned and followed her under the dark\r\nshadows of the chestnut-trees. The air was getting cooler, some\r\nchildren were laughing in the distance, while trundling their hoops.\r\n\r\n"This is your brother, is it not?" he resumed, looking at P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nThe little boy, frightened by the unusual presence of a gentleman, was\r\nwalking gravely by his sister\'s side, holding her tightly by the hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," she replied once more; and as she did so she blushed,\r\nthinking of the abominable inventions circulated by Marguerite and\r\nClara.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Mouret understood why she was blushing, for he quickly added:\r\n"Listen, mademoiselle, I have to apologize to you. Yes, I should\r\nhave been happy to have told you sooner how much I regret the error\r\nthat was made. You were accused too lightly of a fault. However, the\r\nevil is done. I simply wanted to assure you that every one in our\r\nestablishment now knows of your affection for your brothers." Then he\r\nwent on speaking with a respectful politeness to which the saleswomen\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise were little accustomed. Denise\'s confusion had\r\nincreased; but her heart was full of joy. He knew, then, that she had\r\never remained virtuous! Both remained silent; he still lingered beside\r\nher, regulating his walk to the child\'s short steps; and the distant\r\nmurmurs of the city died away under the black shadows of the spreading\r\nchestnut-trees. "I have only one reparation to offer you," he resumed.\r\n"Naturally, if you would like to come back to us----"\r\n\r\nBut she interrupted him, refusing his offer with a feverish haste.\r\n"No, sir, I cannot. Thank you all the same, but I have found another\r\nsituation."\r\n\r\nHe knew it, they had informed him she was with Robineau; and leisurely,\r\nputting himself on a footing of amiable equality, he spoke of the\r\nlatter, rendering him full justice. He was a very intelligent fellow,\r\nno doubt, but too nervous. He would certainly come to grief: Gaujean\r\nhad burdened him with a very heavy business, in which they would both\r\nsuffer. Thereupon Denise, subjugated by this familiarity, opened her\r\nmind further, and allowed it to be seen that she was on the side of\r\nthe big shops in the war between them and the small traders. She grew\r\nanimated, citing examples, showing herself well up in the question\r\nand even expressing new and enlightened ideas. He, quite charmed,\r\nlistened to her in surprise; and turned round, trying to distinguish\r\nher features in the growing darkness. She appeared to be still the\r\nsame with her simple dress and sweet face; but from amidst her modest\r\nbashfulness, there seemed to ascend a penetrating perfume, of which he\r\nfelt the powerful influence. Doubtless this little girl had got used to\r\nthe atmosphere of Paris, she was becoming quite a woman, and was really\r\nperturbing, with her sound common-sense and her beautiful sweet-scented\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n"As you are on our side," said he, laughing, "why do you stay with our\r\nadversaries? I was told too that you lodged with Bourras."\r\n\r\n"A very worthy man," she murmured. "No, not a bit of it! he\'s an old\r\nidiot, a madman who will force me to ruin him, though I should be\r\nglad to get rid of him with a fortune! Besides, your place is not in\r\nhis house, which has a bad reputation. He lets to certain women----"\r\nBut realizing that the young girl was confused, he hastened to add:\r\n"Oh! one can be respectable anywhere, and there\'s even more merit in\r\nremaining so when one is so poor."\r\n\r\nThey took a few steps in silence. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 seemed to be listening with\r\nthe attentive air of a precocious child. Now and again he raised his\r\neyes to his sister, whose burning hand, quivering with sudden starts,\r\nastonished him.\r\n\r\n"Look here!" resumed Mouret, gaily, "will you be my ambassador? I\r\nintended increasing my offer to-morrow--of proposing eighty thousand\r\nfrancs to Bourras. Will you speak to him first about it? Tell him he\'s\r\ncutting his own throat. Perhaps he\'ll listen to you, as he has a liking\r\nfor you, and you\'ll be doing him a real service."\r\n\r\n"Very well!" said Denise, smiling also, "I will deliver your message,\r\nbut I am afraid I shall not succeed."\r\n\r\nThen a fresh silence ensued, neither of them having anything more\r\nto say. For a moment he attempted to talk of her uncle Baudu; but\r\nhad to give it up on seeing how uncomfortable this made the girl.\r\nNevertheless, they continued walking side by side, and at last found\r\nthemselves near the Rue de Rivoli, in a path where it was still light.\r\nOn emerging from the darkness of the trees this was like a sudden\r\nawakening. He understood that he could not detain her any longer.\r\n\r\n"Good night, mademoiselle," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good night, sir."\r\n\r\nNevertheless he did not go away. On raising his eyes he had perceived\r\nin front of him, at the corner of the Rue d\'Alger, the lighted windows\r\nof Madame Desforges\'s flat whither he was bound. And looking at Denise,\r\nwhom he could now see, in the pale twilight, she appeared to him very\r\npuny compared to Henriette. Why was it then that she touched his heart\r\nin this manner? It was a stupid caprice.\r\n\r\n"This little man is getting tired," he resumed, by way of saying\r\nsomething. "Remember, mind, that our house will always be open to you;\r\nyou\'ve only to knock, and I\'ll give you every compensation possible.\r\nGood night, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\n"Good night, sir."\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret had quitted her, Denise went back under the chestnut-trees,\r\ninto the black gloom. For a long time she walked on at random, between\r\nthe huge trunks, her face burning, her head in a whirl of confused\r\nideas. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 still held her hand and was stretching out his short legs\r\nto keep pace with her. She had forgotten him. But at last he said: "You\r\ngo too quick, little mother."\r\n\r\nAt this she sat down on a bench; and as he was tired, the child went to\r\nsleep on her lap. She held him there, pressing him to her virgin bosom,\r\nher eyes wandering far away into the darkness. When, an hour later,\r\nthey slowly returned to the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, she had regained her\r\nusual quiet, sensible expression.\r\n\r\n"Hell and thunder!" shouted Bourras, when he saw her coming, "the\r\nblow is struck. That rascal of a Mouret has just bought my house." He\r\nwas half mad, and was striking himself in the middle of the shop with\r\nsuch outrageous gestures that he almost broke the windows. "Ah! the\r\nscoundrel! It\'s the fruiterer who\'s written to tell me of it. And how\r\nmuch do you think the rogue, has got for the house? One hundred and\r\nfifty thousand francs, four times its value! There\'s another thief,\r\nif you like! Just fancy, he has taken advantage of my embellishments,\r\nmaking capital out of the fact that the house has been done up. How\r\nmuch longer are they going to make a fool of me?"\r\n\r\nThe thought that his money spent on paint and whitewash had brought\r\nthe fruiterer a profit exasperated him. And now Mouret would be his\r\nlandlord; he would have to pay him! It was beneath this detested\r\ncompetitor\'s roof that he must in future live! Such a thought raised\r\nhis fury to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I could hear them digging a hole through the wall. At this moment,\r\nthey are here, eating out of my very plate, so to say!"\r\n\r\nAnd the shop shook under his heavy fist as he banged it on the counter,\r\nmaking the umbrellas and the parasols dance again.\r\n\r\nDenise, bewildered, could not get in a word. She stood there,\r\nmotionless, waiting for the end of this fit; whilst P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, very tired,\r\nfell asleep again, this time on a chair. At last, when Bourras became\r\na little calmer, she resolved to deliver Mouret\'s message. No doubt\r\nthe old man was irritated, but the excess even of his anger, the blind\r\nalley, as it were, in which he found himself, might determine an abrupt\r\nacceptance on his part.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just met some one," she commenced. "Yes, a person from The\r\nParadise, who is very well informed. It appears that they are going to\r\noffer you eighty thousand francs to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Eighty thousand francs!" he interrupted, in a terrible voice; "eighty\r\nthousand francs! Not for a million now!"\r\n\r\nShe tried to reason with him. But at that moment the shop door opened,\r\nand she suddenly drew back, pale and silent. It was her uncle Baudu,\r\nwith his yellow face and aged look. Bourras caught his neighbour by the\r\nbuttonhole, and without allowing him to say a word, as if goaded on\r\nby his presence, roared in his face: "What do you think they have the\r\ncheek to offer me? Eighty thousand francs! They\'ve got to that point,\r\nthe brigands! they think I\'m going to sell myself like a prostitute.\r\nAh! they\'ve bought the house, and think they\'ve got me now! Well! it\'s\r\nall over, they shan\'t have it! I might have given way, perhaps; but now\r\nit belongs to them, let them try to take it!"\r\n\r\n"So the news is true?" said Baudu, in his slow voice. "I had heard of\r\nit, and came over to know if it was so."\r\n\r\n"Eighty thousand francs!" repeated Bourras. "Why not a hundred thousand\r\nat once? It\'s this immense sum of money that makes me so indignant. Do\r\nthey think they can make me commit a knavish trick with their money!\r\nThey shan\'t have it, by heavens! Never, never, you hear me?"\r\n\r\nThen Denise broke her silence to remark, in her calm, quiet way:\r\n"They\'ll have it in nine years\' time, when your lease expires."\r\n\r\nAnd, notwithstanding her uncle\'s presence, she begged the old man to\r\naccept. The struggle was becoming impossible, he was fighting against a\r\nsuperior force; it would be madness to refuse the fortune offered him.\r\nBut he still replied no. In nine years\' time he hoped to be dead, so as\r\nnot to see it.\r\n\r\n"You hear, Monsieur Baudu," he resumed, "your niece is on their side,\r\nit\'s she whom they have commissioned to corrupt me. She\'s with the\r\nbrigands, my word of honour!"\r\n\r\nBaudu, who had so far appeared not to notice Denise, now raised his\r\nhead, with the surly movement that he affected when standing at his\r\nshop door, every time she passed. But, slowly, he turned round and\r\nlooked at her, and his thick lips trembled.\r\n\r\n"I know it," he replied in an undertone, and he continued looking at\r\nher.\r\n\r\nDenise, affected almost to tears, thought him greatly changed by worry.\r\nPerhaps too he was stricken with remorse at not having assisted her\r\nduring the time of misery through which she had lately passed. Then\r\nthe sight of P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 sleeping on the chair, amidst the hubbub of the\r\ndiscussion, seemed to suddenly inspire him with compassion.\r\n\r\n"Denise," said he simply, "come to-morrow and have dinner with us, and\r\nbring the little one. My wife and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve asked me to invite you if I\r\nmet you."\r\n\r\nShe turned very red, went up to him and kissed him. And as he was going\r\naway, Bourras, delighted at this reconciliation, again cried out to\r\nhim: "Just give her a lecture, she isn\'t a bad sort. As for me, the\r\nhouse may fall, I shall be found in the ruins."\r\n\r\n"Our houses are already falling, neighbour," said Baudu with a gloomy\r\nair. "We shall all of us be crushed under them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the whole neighbourhood was talking of the great\r\nthoroughfare which was to be opened between the Bourse and the\r\nnew Opera House, under the name of the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre.[1]\r\nThe expropriation judgments had been delivered, and two gangs of\r\ndemolishers were already beginning operations at either end, the first\r\npulling down the old mansions in the Rue Louis-le-Grand, and the\r\nother destroying the thin walls of the old Vaudeville. You could hear\r\nthe picks getting closer, and the Rue de Choiseul and the Rue de la\r\nMichodi\xc3\xa8re waxing quite excited over their condemned houses. Before a\r\nfortnight passed, the opening would leave in both these streets a great\r\ngap full of sunlight and uproar.\r\n\r\n[1] This is at the present day the Rue du Quatre Septembre. Napoleon\r\nIII. gave as the name of the new thoroughfare the date of his\r\ncoronation (Dec. 10); and after Sedan the Republican government\r\nironically retorted by altering the name to the date of his downfall\r\n(Sept. 4).\r\n\r\nBut what stirred up the district still more, was the work undertaken\r\nat The Ladies\' Paradise. People talked of considerable enlargements,\r\nof gigantic shops with frontages on the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin, and the Rue Monsigny. Mouret, it was said, had\r\nmade arrangements with Baron Hartmann, the chairman of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit\r\nImmobilier, and would occupy the whole block, excepting the future\r\nfrontage in the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, where the baron wished to erect a\r\nrival establishment to the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel. The Paradise people were buying\r\nup leases on all sides, shops were closing, and tenants moving; and\r\nin the empty buildings an army of workmen was commencing the various\r\nalterations amidst a cloud of plaster. And alone in all this disorder,\r\nold Bourras\'s narrow hovel remained intact, still obstinately clinging\r\nbetween the high walls covered with masons.\r\n\r\nWhen on the following day, Denise went with P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 to her uncle Baudu\'s,\r\nthe street was blocked up by a line of carts discharging bricks outside\r\nthe H\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard. Baudu was standing at his shop door looking on\r\nwith a gloomy air. In proportion as The Ladies\' Paradise became larger,\r\nThe Old Elbeuf seemed to grow smaller. The young girl thought that the\r\nwindows looked blacker than ever, lower and lower still beneath the\r\nfirst storey, with its rounded prison-like windows. The damp, moreover,\r\nhad still further discoloured the old green sign-board; woefulness\r\nappeared on the whole frontage, livid in hue, and, as it were, shrunken.\r\n\r\n"Here you are, then!" said Baudu. "Take care! they would run right over\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nInside the shop, Denise experienced the same heart pang; she found it\r\ndarker, steeped more deeply than ever in the somnolence of approaching\r\nruin. Empty corners formed dark cavities, dust was covering the\r\ncounters and filling the drawers, whilst a cellar-like odour of\r\nsaltpetre rose from the bales of cloth that were no longer moved about.\r\nAt the desk Madame Baudu and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve stood mute and motionless, as in\r\nsome solitary spot, where no one would come to disturb them. The mother\r\nwas hemming some dusters. The daughter, her hands resting on her knees,\r\nwas gazing at the emptiness before her.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, aunt," said Denise; "I\'m delighted to see you again, and\r\nif I have hurt your feelings, I hope you will forgive me."\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu kissed her, greatly affected. "My poor child," said she,\r\n"if I had no other troubles, you would see me gayer than this."\r\n\r\n"Good evening, cousin," resumed Denise, kissing Genevi\xc3\xa8ve on the cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe latter woke with a sort of start, and returned her kisses but\r\nwithout finding a word to say. Then the two women took up P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, who was\r\nholding out his little arms, and the reconciliation was complete.\r\n\r\n"Well! it\'s six o\'clock, let\'s go to dinner," said Baudu. "Why haven\'t\r\nyou brought Jean?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he was to have come," murmured Denise, in embarrassment. "I saw\r\nhim this morning, and he faithfully promised me. Oh! we must not wait\r\nfor him; his master has kept him, I dare say." In reality she suspected\r\nsome extraordinary adventure, and wished to apologize for him in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n"In that case, we will commence," said her uncle and turning towards\r\nthe dim depths of the shop, he added:\r\n\r\n"You may as well dine with us, Colomban. No one will come."\r\n\r\nDenise had not noticed the assistant. Her aunt explained to her that\r\nthey had been obliged to get rid of the other salesman and the young\r\nlady. Business was getting so bad that Colomban sufficed; and even he\r\nspent many idle hours, drowsy, falling asleep with his eyes open.\r\n\r\nThe gas was burning in the dining-room, although they were now in the\r\nlong days of summer. Denise shivered slightly as she went in, chilled\r\nby the dampness oozing from the walls. She once more beheld the round\r\ntable, the places laid on the American cloth, the window deriving its\r\nair and light from the dark and fetid back-yard. And all these things\r\nappeared to her to be gloomier than ever, and tearful like the shop.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, uncomfortable for Denise\'s sake, "shall I\r\nclose the window? there\'s rather a bad smell."\r\n\r\nHe himself smelt nothing, and seemed surprised. "Shut the window if you\r\nlike," he replied at last. "But we shan\'t get any air then."\r\n\r\nAnd indeed they were almost stifled. It was a very simple family\r\ndinner. After the soup, as soon as the servant had served the boiled\r\nbeef, the old man as usual began talking about the people opposite. At\r\nfirst he showed himself very tolerant, allowing his niece to have a\r\ndifferent opinion.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said he, "you are quite free to support those big tricky\r\nshows. Each person has his ideas, my girl. If you were not disgusted\r\nat being so disgracefully chucked out you must have strong reasons for\r\nliking them; and even if you went back again, I should think none the\r\nworse of you. No one here would be offended, would they?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" murmured Madame Baudu.\r\n\r\nThereupon Denise quietly gave her reasons for her preference, just as\r\nshe had at Robineau\'s: explaining the logical evolution in business,\r\nthe necessities of modern times, the greatness of these new creations,\r\nin short, the growing well-being of the public. Baudu, his eyes\r\ndilated, and his mouth clammy, listened with a visible mental strain.\r\nThen, when she had finished, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all phantasmagoria, you know. Business is business, there\'s no\r\ngetting over that. Oh! I own that they succeed, but that\'s all. For a\r\nlong time I thought they would smash up; yes, I expected that, waiting\r\npatiently--you remember? Well, no, it appears that nowadays thieves\r\nmake fortunes, whilst honest people die of hunger. That\'s what we\'ve\r\ncome to. I\'m obliged to bow to facts. And I do bow, on my word, I do\r\nbow to them!" A deep anger was gradually rising within him. All at once\r\nhe flourished his fork. "But The Old Elbeuf will never give way! I said\r\nas much to Bourras, you know, \'Neighbour,\' said I \'you\'re going over to\r\nthe cheapjacks; your paint and your varnish are a disgrace to you.\'"\r\n\r\n"Eat your dinner!" interrupted Madame Baudu, feeling anxious, on seeing\r\nhim so excited.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, I want my niece thoroughly to understand my motto. Just\r\nlisten, my girl: I\'m like this decanter, I don\'t budge. They succeed,\r\nso much the worse for them! As for me, I protest--that\'s all!"\r\n\r\nThe servant brought in a piece of roast veal. He cut it up with\r\ntrembling hands; and no longer showed his accurate glance, his deft\r\nskill in weighing the portions. The consciousness of his defeat\r\ndeprived him of the confidence he had formerly possessed as a respected\r\nemployer. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 had thought that his uncle was getting angry, and they\r\nhad to pacify him, by giving him some dessert, some biscuits which\r\nwere near his plate. Then Baudu, lowering his voice, tried to talk of\r\nsomething else. For a moment he spoke of the demolitions going on,\r\napproving of the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, the piercing of which would\r\ncertainly increase the business of the neighbourhood. But then he\r\nagain returned to The Ladies\' Paradise; everything brought him back to\r\nit, as to a chronic complaint. They were being covered with plaster,\r\nand business had quite ceased since the builders\' carts had commenced\r\nto block up the street. Moreover the place would soon be really\r\nridiculous, in its immensity; the customers would lose themselves in\r\nit. Why not have the Central Markets at once? And, in spite of his\r\nwife\'s supplicating looks, notwithstanding his own effort, he went on\r\nfrom the works to the amount of business done in the big shop. Was it\r\nnot inconceivable? In less than four years they had increased their\r\nfigures five-fold: the annual receipts, formerly some eight million\r\nfrancs, now attained the sum of forty millions, according to the last\r\nbalance-sheet. In fact it was a piece of folly, a thing that had\r\nnever been seen before, and against which it was perfectly useless\r\nto struggle. They were always swelling and growing; they now had a\r\nthousand employees and twenty-eight departments. Those twenty-eight\r\ndepartments enraged him more than anything else. No doubt they had\r\nduplicated a few, but others were quite new; for instance a furniture\r\ndepartment, and a department for fancy goods. The idea! Fancy goods!\r\nReally those people had no pride whatever, they would even end by\r\nselling fish. Then Baudu, though still affecting to respect Denise\'s\r\nopinions, attempted to convert her.\r\n\r\n"Frankly, you can\'t defend them. What would you say if I were to add an\r\nironmongery department to my cloth business? You would say I was mad,\r\neh? Confess, at least, that you don\'t esteem them."\r\n\r\nAnd as the young girl simply smiled, feeling uncomfortable and\r\nrealizing how futile the best of reasons would be, he resumed: "In\r\nshort, you are on their side. We won\'t talk about it any more, for it\'s\r\nuseless to let that part us again. That would be the climax--to see\r\nthem come between me and my family! Go back with them, if you like; but\r\npray don\'t worry me with any more of their stories!"\r\n\r\nA silence ensued. His previous violence fell to this feverish\r\nresignation. As they were suffocating in the narrow room, heated by\r\nthe gas-burner, the servant had to open the window again; and the\r\ndamp, pestilential air from the yard blew into the apartment. A dish\r\nof _saut\xc3\xa9_ potatoes had appeared, and they helped themselves slowly,\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\n"Look at those two," began Baudu again, pointing with his knife to\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve and Colomban. "Ask them if they like your Ladies\' Paradise."\r\n\r\nSide by side in the places where they had found themselves twice a-day\r\nfor the last twelve years, Colomban and Genevi\xc3\xa8ve were eating slowly,\r\nwithout uttering a word. He, exaggerating the coarse good-nature of\r\nhis face, seemed to be concealing, behind his drooping eyelashes, the\r\ninward flame which was consuming him; whilst she, her head bowed lower\r\nbeneath her heavy hair, appeared to be giving way entirely, as if a\r\nprey to some secret grief.\r\n\r\n"Last year was very disastrous," explained Baudu, "and we have been\r\nobliged to postpone the marriage. Just to please them, ask them what\r\nthey think of your friends."\r\n\r\nIn order to pacify him, Denise interrogated the young people.\r\n\r\n"Naturally I can\'t be very fond of them, cousin," replied Genevi\xc3\xa8ve.\r\n"But never fear, every one doesn\'t detest them."\r\n\r\nAnd so speaking she looked at Colomban, who was rolling up some\r\nbread-crumbs with an absorbed air. But when he felt that the young\r\ngirl\'s gaze was turned upon him, he broke out into a series of violent\r\nexclamations: "A rotten shop! A lot of rogues, every man-jack of them!\r\nIn fact a regular pest in the neighbourhood!"\r\n\r\n"You hear him! You hear him!" exclaimed Baudu, delighted. "There\'s one\r\nwhom they\'ll never get hold of! Ah! my boy, you\'re the last of the old\r\nstock, we shan\'t see any more!"\r\n\r\nBut Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, with her severe and suffering look, did not take her\r\neyes off Colomban, but dived into the depths of his heart. And he felt\r\ntroubled, and again launched out into invective. Madame Baudu was\r\nwatching them in silence with an anxious air, as if she foresaw another\r\nmisfortune in this direction. For some time past her daughter\'s sadness\r\nhad frightened her, she felt her to be dying.\r\n\r\n"The shop is left to take care of itself," she said at last, rising\r\nfrom table, in order to put an end to the scene. "Go and see, Colomban;\r\nI fancy I heard some one."\r\n\r\nThey had finished, and got up. Baudu and Colomban went to speak to a\r\ntraveller, who had come for orders. Madame Baudu carried P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 off to\r\nshow him some pictures. The servant had quickly cleared the table, and\r\nDenise was lingering by the window, looking curiously into the little\r\nback-yard, when on turning round she saw Genevi\xc3\xa8ve still in her place,\r\nher eyes fixed on the American cloth, which was still damp from the\r\nsponge that had been passed over it.\r\n\r\n"Are you suffering, cousin?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe young girl did not reply but seemed to be obstinately studying\r\na rent in the cloth, though really absorbed in the reflections\r\npassing through her mind. But after a while she raised her head with\r\ndifficulty, and looked at the sympathizing face bent over hers. The\r\nothers had gone, then? What was she doing on that chair? And suddenly\r\nsobs stifled her, her head fell forward on the edge of the table. She\r\nwept on, wetting her sleeve with her tears.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! what\'s the matter with you?" cried Denise in dismay.\r\n"Shall I call some one?"\r\n\r\nBut Genevi\xc3\xa8ve nervously caught her by the arm, and held her back,\r\nstammering: "No, no, stay here. Don\'t let mamma know! With you I don\'t\r\nmind; but not the others--not the others! It\'s not my fault, I assure\r\nyou. It was on finding myself all alone. Wait a bit; I\'m better, I\'m\r\nnot crying now."\r\n\r\nNevertheless sudden attacks kept on seizing her, sending shudders\r\nthrough her frail body. It seemed as though her pile of hair was\r\nweighing down her neck. While she was rolling her head on her folded\r\narms, a hair-pin slipped out, and then her hair fell over her neck,\r\nburying it beneath gloomy tresses. Denise, as quietly as possible for\r\nfear of attracting attention, sought to console her. She undid her\r\ndress, and was heart-rent on seeing how fearfully thin she had become.\r\nThe poor girl\'s bosom was as hollow as a child\'s. Then Denise took\r\nhold of her hair by the handful, that superb hair, which seemed to be\r\nabsorbing all her life, and twisted it up tightly to clear her neck,\r\nand make her cooler.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, you are very kind," said Genevi\xc3\xa8ve. "Ah! I\'m not stout, am I?\r\nI used to be stouter, but it\'s all gone away. Do up my dress or mamma\r\nmight see my shoulders. I hide them as much as I can. Good heavens! I\'m\r\nnot at all well, I\'m not at all well."\r\n\r\nHowever, the attack passed away, and she sat there completely exhausted\r\nand looking fixedly at her cousin. After a pause she abruptly inquired:\r\n"Tell me the truth: does he love her?"\r\n\r\nDenise felt a blush rising to her cheeks. She was perfectly well aware\r\nthat Genevi\xc3\xa8ve referred to Colomban and Clara; but she pretended to be\r\nsurprised. "Who, dear?"\r\n\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve shook her head with an incredulous air. "Don\'t tell\r\nfalsehoods, I beg of you. Do me the favour of setting my doubts at\r\nrest. You must know, I feel it. Yes, you were that girl\'s comrade, and\r\nI\'ve seen Colomban run after you, and talk to you in a low voice. He\r\nwas giving you messages for her, wasn\'t he? Oh! for pity\'s sake, tell\r\nme the truth; I assure you it will do me good."\r\n\r\nNever before had Denise been in such an awkward position. She lowered\r\nher eyes before this girl, who was ever silent and yet guessed all.\r\nHowever, she had the strength to deceive her still. "But it\'s you he\r\nloves!" she said.\r\n\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve made a gesture of despair. "Very well, you won\'t tell me\r\nanything. However, I don\'t care, I\'ve seen them. He\'s continually going\r\noutside to look at her. She, upstairs, laughs like a bad woman. Of\r\ncourse they meet out of doors."\r\n\r\n"As for that, no, I assure you!" exclaimed Denise, forgetting herself\r\nand carried away by the desire to give her cousin at least that\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve drew a long breath, and smiled feebly. Then in the weak voice\r\nof a convalescent she said, "I should like a glass of water. Excuse me\r\nif I trouble you. Look, over there in the sideboard."\r\n\r\nWhen she got hold of the bottle, she drank a large glassful right off,\r\nkeeping Denise away with one hand. The young saleswoman was afraid that\r\nshe might do herself harm.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said she, "let me be; I\'m always thirsty. In the night I get\r\nup to drink."\r\n\r\nSilence again fell. Then Genevi\xc3\xa8ve once more began in a gentle voice.\r\n"If you only knew, I\'ve been accustomed to the idea of this marriage\r\nfor the last ten years. I was still wearing short dresses, when\r\nColomban began courting me. I can hardly remember how things came\r\nabout. By always living together, shut up here together, without any\r\nother distractions between us, I must have ended by believing him to\r\nbe my husband before he really was. I didn\'t know whether I loved him,\r\nI was his wife, that was all. And now he wants to go off with another\r\ngirl! Oh, heavens! my heart is breaking! You see, it\'s a grief that I\r\nnever felt before. It hurts me in the bosom, and in the head; then it\r\nspreads everywhere, it\'s killing me."\r\n\r\nHer eyes filled with tears. Denise, whose eyelids were also moistening\r\nwith pity, asked her: "Does my aunt suspect anything?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma has her suspicions, I think. As for papa, he is too much\r\nworried, and does not know the pain he is causing me by postponing the\r\nmarriage. Mamma has questioned me several times, greatly alarmed to see\r\nme pining away. She has never been very strong herself, and has often\r\nsaid to me: \'My poor child, you\'re like myself, by no means strong.\r\nBesides, one doesn\'t grow much in these shops. But she must find me\r\ngetting really too thin now. Look at my arms; would you believe it?"\r\n\r\nThen with a trembling hand she again took up the water bottle. Her\r\ncousin tried to prevent her from drinking.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m so thirsty," said she, "let me drink."\r\n\r\nThey could hear Baudu talking in a loud voice. Then suddenly yielding\r\nto an inspiration of her heart, Denise knelt down before Genevi\xc3\xa8ve and\r\nthrowing her sisterly arms round her neck, kissed her, and assured her\r\nthat everything would yet turn out all right, that she would marry\r\nColomban, would get well, and live happily. And then she got up quickly\r\nfor her uncle was calling her.\r\n\r\n"Jean is here. Come along."\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Jean, who, looking rather scared, had just arrived for\r\ndinner. When they told him it was striking eight, he seemed amazed.\r\nImpossible! He had only just left his master\'s. They chaffed him. No\r\ndoubt he had come by way of the Bois de Vincennes. But as soon as he\r\ncould get near his sister, he whispered to her: "It\'s all the fault of\r\na little laundry-girl. I\'ve got a cab outside by the hour. Give me five\r\nfrancs."\r\n\r\nHe went out for a minute, and then returned to dinner, for Madame Baudu\r\nwould not hear of his going away without taking, at least, a plate\r\nof soup. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve had returned to the shop in her usual silent and\r\nretiring manner. Colomban was now half asleep behind the counter; and\r\nthe evening passed away, slow and melancholy, only animated by Baudu\'s\r\ntramp, as he walked from one end of the empty shop to the other. A\r\nsingle gas-burner was alight--the shadows of the low ceiling fell in\r\nlarge masses, like black earth from a ditch.\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed away. Denise came in nearly every evening to\r\ncheer up Genevi\xc3\xa8ve a bit, but the Baudus\' home became more melancholy\r\nthan ever. The works opposite were a continual torment, which made them\r\nfeel their bad luck more and more keenly. Even when they had an hour\r\nof hope--some unexpected joy--the uproar of a tumbrel-load of bricks,\r\nthe sound of a stone-cutter\'s saw or the simple call of a mason would\r\nat once suffice to mar their pleasure. In fact, the whole neighbourhood\r\nwas stirred by it all. From behind the hoarding edging and obstructing\r\nthe three streets, there issued a movement of feverish activity.\r\nAlthough the architect was utilizing the existing buildings, he was\r\nopening them in various ways to adapt them to their new uses; and right\r\nin the centre of the vacant space supplied by the court-yards, he was\r\nbuilding a central gallery as vast as a church, which would be reached\r\nby a grand entrance in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin in the very middle\r\nof the frontage. They had, at first, experienced great difficulty in\r\nlaying the foundations, for they had come upon sewer deposits and loose\r\nearth, full of human bones; besides which the boring of the well--a\r\nwell three hundred feet deep--destined to yield two hundred gallons\r\na minute had made the neighbours very anxious. They had now got the\r\nwalls up to the first storey; and the entire block was surrounded by\r\nscaffoldings, regular towers of timber. There was an incessant noise\r\nfrom the grinding of the windlasses hoisting up the free-stone, the\r\nabrupt unloading of iron bars, the clamour of the army of workmen,\r\naccompanied by the noise of picks and hammers. But above all else, what\r\nmost deafened you was the sound of the machinery. Everything went by\r\nsteam, screeching whistles rent the air; and then too, at the slightest\r\ngust of wind, clouds of plaster flew about and covered the neighbouring\r\nroofs like a fall of snow. The despairing Baudus looked on at this\r\nimplacable dust penetrating everywhere--filtering through the closest\r\nwoodwork, soiling the goods in their shop, even gliding into their\r\nbeds; and the idea that they must continue to breathe it--that it would\r\nend by killing them--empoisoned their existence.\r\n\r\nThe situation, however, was destined to become worse still, for in\r\nSeptember, the architect, afraid of not being ready in time, decided\r\nto carry on the work at night also. Powerful electric lamps were\r\nestablished, and then the uproar became continuous. Gangs of men\r\nrelieved each other; the hammers never stopped, the engines whistled\r\nnight and day; and again the everlasting clamour seemed to raise and\r\nscatter the white dust. The exasperated Baudus now had to give up the\r\nidea of sleeping even; they were shaken in their alcove; the noises\r\nchanged into nightmare whenever they managed to doze off. Then, if they\r\ngot up to calm their fever, and went, with bare feet, to pull back\r\nthe curtains and look out of the window, they were frightened by the\r\nvision of The Ladies\' Paradise flaring in the darkness like a colossal\r\nforge, where their ruin was being forged. Along the half-built walls,\r\npierced with empty bays, the electric lamps threw broad bluey rays,\r\nof blinding intensity. Two o\'clock struck--then three, then four; and\r\nduring the painful sleep of the neighbourhood, the works, expanding in\r\nthe lunar-like brightness, became colossal and fantastic, swarming with\r\nblack shadows, noisy workmen, whose silhouettes gesticulated against\r\nthe crude whiteness of the new walls.\r\n\r\nBaudu had spoken correctly. The small traders of the adjacent streets\r\nwere receiving another mortal blow. Every time The Ladies\' Paradise\r\ncreated new departments there were fresh failures among the shopkeepers\r\nof the district. The disaster spread, one could hear the oldest houses\r\ncracking. Mademoiselle Tatin, of the under-linen shop in the Passage\r\nChoiseul, had just been declared bankrupt; Quinette, the glover,\r\ncould hardly hold out another six months; the furriers, Vanpouille,\r\nwere obliged to sub-let a part of their premises; and if the B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9s,\r\nbrother and sister, still kept on as hosiers, in the Rue Gaillon,\r\nthey were evidently living on the money they had formerly saved. And\r\nnow more smashes were on the point of being added to those long since\r\nforeseen; the fancy goods department threatened a dealer in the Rue\r\nSaint-Roch, Desligni\xc3\xa8res, a big, full-blooded man; whilst the furniture\r\ndepartment was injuring Messrs. Piot and Rivoire, whose shops slumbered\r\nin the gloom of the Passage Sainte-Anne. It was even feared that an\r\nattack of apoplexy would carry off Desligni\xc3\xa8res, who had been in a\r\nterrible rage ever since The Ladies\' Paradise had marked up purses\r\nat thirty per cent. reduction. The furniture dealers, who were much\r\ncalmer, affected to joke at these counter-jumpers who wanted to meddle\r\nwith such articles as chairs and tables; but customers were already\r\nleaving them, and the success of Mouret\'s department threatened to be\r\na formidable one. It was all over, they must bow their heads. After\r\nthese, others would be swept off in their turn and there was no reason\r\nwhy every business should not be driven away. Some day The Ladies\'\r\nParadise alone would cover the neighbourhood with its roof.\r\n\r\nAt present, when the thousand employees went in and came out morning\r\nand evening, they formed such a long procession on the Place Gaillon\r\nthat people stopped to look at them as they might at a passing\r\nregiment. For ten minutes they blocked up all the streets; and the\r\nshopkeepers standing at their doors thought bitterly of their one\r\nassistant, whom they hardly knew how to find food for. The last\r\nbalance-sheet of the big bazaar, the turn-over of forty millions, had\r\nalso revolutionized the neighbourhood. The figure passed from house\r\nto house amid cries of surprise and anger. Forty millions! Think of\r\nthat! No doubt the net profit did not exceed more than four per cent.,\r\ngiven the heavy general expenses, and the system of low prices; but\r\nsixteen hundred thousand francs was still a handsome sum; one could\r\nwell be satisfied with four per cent., when one operated on such a\r\nscale as that. It was said that Mouret\'s starting capital of five\r\nhundred thousand francs, each year increased by the total profits of\r\nthe house--a capital which must at that moment have amounted to four\r\nmillions--had in one twelvemonth passed ten times over the counters\r\nin the form of goods. Robineau, when he made this calculation in\r\nDenise\'s presence one evening, after dinner, was quite overcome for\r\na moment, and remained staring at his empty plate. She was right, it\r\nwas this incessant renewal of capital that constituted the invincible\r\npower of the new system of business. Bourras alone denied the facts,\r\nrefusing to understand, superb and stupid as a milestone. To him the\r\nParadise people were a pack of thieves and nothing more! A lying set!\r\nCheap-jacks who would be picked out of the gutter some fine morning!\r\n\r\nThe Baudus, however, despite their determination not to change anything\r\nin the system of The Old Elbeuf, tried to sustain the competition.\r\nCustomers no longer coming to them, they sought to reach the customers\r\nthrough the agency of travellers. There was at that time, in the\r\nParis market, a traveller connected with all the leading tailors,\r\nwho saved the little cloth and flannel houses when he condescended\r\nto represent them. Naturally they all tried to get hold of him; he\r\nwas quite a personage; and Baudu, having haggled with him, had the\r\nmisfortune to see him come to terms with the Matignons, of the Rue\r\nCroix-des-Petits-Champs. Then one after the other, two other travellers\r\nrobbed him; a third, an honest man, did no business. It was a slow\r\ndeath, exempt from shocks, a continual decrease of business, customers\r\nfalling away one by one. A day came when the bills to be met fell\r\non the Baudus very heavily. Until that time they had lived on their\r\nformer savings; but now they began to contract debts. In December,\r\nBaudu, terrified by the amount of his acceptances, resigned himself\r\nto a most cruel sacrifice: he sold his country-house at Rambouillet,\r\na house which cost him a lot of money in continual repairs, and whose\r\ntenants had not even paid the rent when he decided to get rid of it.\r\nThis sale killed the sole dream of his life, his heart bled as for the\r\nloss of some dear one. And for seventy thousand francs he had to part\r\nwith what had cost him more than two hundred thousand, considering\r\nhimself fortunate even in meeting the Lhommes, his neighbours, who were\r\ndesirous of adding to their property. Those seventy thousand francs\r\nwould keep the business going a little longer; for in spite of all the\r\nrepulses the idea of struggling on ever sprang up again; perhaps with\r\ngreat care they might conquer even now.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday on which the Lhommes paid the money, they condescended\r\nto dine at The Old Elbeuf. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie was the first to arrive;\r\nthey had to wait for the cashier, who came late, scared by a whole\r\nafternoon\'s music: as for young Albert, he had accepted the invitation,\r\nbut did not put in an appearance. It was, moreover, a painful evening.\r\nThe Baudus, living without air in their tiny dining-room, suffered\r\nfrom the breeze which the Lhommes, with their lack of family ties and\r\ntheir taste for a free life, brought in with them. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, wounded\r\nby Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s imperial airs, did not open her mouth; but Colomban\r\nadmired her with a shiver, on reflecting that she reigned over Clara.\r\nLater on, when Madame Baudu was already in bed, her husband remained\r\nfor a long time walking about the room. It was a mild night--damp,\r\nthawing weather--and in spite of the closed windows, and drawn\r\ncurtains, one could hear the engines snorting on the opposite side of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I\'m thinking of, Elisabeth?" said Baudu at last.\r\n"Well! those Lhommes may earn as much money as they like, I\'d rather be\r\nin my shoes than theirs. They get on well, it\'s true. The wife said,\r\ndidn\'t she? that she had made nearly twenty thousand francs this year,\r\nand that had enabled her to take my poor house. Never mind! I\'ve no\r\nlonger got the house, but I don\'t go playing music in one direction,\r\nwhilst you are gadding about in the other. No, look you, they can\'t be\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\nHe was still keenly fretting over the sacrifice he had been compelled\r\nto make, full of rancour against those people who had bought up his\r\ndarling dream. When ever he came near the bed, he leant over his wife\r\nand gesticulated, then, returning to the window, he stood silent for\r\na minute, listening to the noise of the works. And again he vented\r\nhis old accusations, his despairing complaints about the new times;\r\nnobody had ever seen such things, shop-assistants now earned more than\r\ntradesmen, cashiers bought up employers\' property. So no wonder that\r\neverything was going to the dogs; family ties no longer existed, people\r\nlived at hotels instead of eating their meals at home in a respectable\r\nmanner. At last he ended by prophesying that young Albert would swallow\r\nup the Rambouillet property later on with a lot of actresses.\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu listened to him, her head flat on the pillow, and so pale\r\nthat her face seemed the colour of the sheets. "They\'ve paid you," she\r\nat length said softly.\r\n\r\nAt this Baudu became dumb. He walked about for an instant with his\r\neyes on the ground. Then he resumed: "They\'ve paid me, \'tis true; and,\r\nafter all, their money is as good as another\'s. It would be funny if we\r\nrevived the business with this money. Ah! if I were not so old and worn\r\nout!"\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued. The draper was full of vague projects. Suddenly,\r\nwithout moving her head, her eyes fixed on the ceiling, his wife spoke\r\nagain: "Have you noticed your daughter lately?"\r\n\r\n"No," he replied.\r\n\r\n"Well! she makes me rather anxious. She\'s getting pale, she seems to be\r\npining away."\r\n\r\nHe stood before the bed, full of surprise. "Really! whatever for? If\r\nshe\'s ill she should say so. To-morrow we must send for the doctor."\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu still remained motionless; but after a time, she declared,\r\nwith her meditative air: "I think it would be better to get this\r\nmarriage with Colomban over."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and then began walking about again. Certain things\r\ncame back to his mind. Was it possible that his daughter was falling\r\nill over the shopman? Did she love him so much that she could not wait?\r\nHere was another misfortune! It worried him all the more from the\r\ncircumstance that he himself had fixed ideas about this marriage. He\r\ncould never consent to it in the present state of affairs. However, his\r\nanxiety softened him.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said he at last, "I\'ll speak to Colomban."\r\n\r\nAnd without adding another word he continued his walk. Soon afterwards\r\nhis wife fell asleep still looking quite white, as if dead; while he\r\nstill kept on tramping about. Before getting into bed he drew aside\r\nthe curtains and glanced outside; across the street through the gaping\r\nwindows of the old H\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard the workmen could be seen stirring\r\nin the dazzling glare of the electric light.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Baudu took Colomban to the further end of the\r\nstore-room on the upper floor, having made up his mind over night as to\r\nwhat he would say to him. "My boy," he began, "you know I\'ve sold my\r\nproperty at Rambouillet. That will enable us to show some fight. But I\r\nshould first of all like to have a talk with you."\r\n\r\nThe young man, who seemed to dread the interview, waited with an\r\nawkward air. His small eyes twinkled in his broad face, and he stood\r\nthere with his mouth open--with him a sign of profound agitation.\r\n\r\n"Just listen to me," resumed the draper. "When old Hauchecorne left me\r\nThe Old Elbeuf, the house was prosperous; he himself had received it\r\nfrom old Finet in a satisfactory state. You know my ideas; I should\r\nconsider it wrong if I passed this family trust over to my children in\r\na diminished state; and that\'s why I\'ve always postponed your marriage\r\nwith Genevi\xc3\xa8ve. Yes, I was obstinate; I hoped to bring back our former\r\nprosperity; I wanted to hand you the books, saying: \'Look here! the\r\nyear I commenced we sold so much cloth, and this year, the year I\r\nretire, we have sold ten thousand or twenty thousand francs\' worth\r\nmore.\' In short, you understand, it was a vow I made to myself, the\r\nvery natural desire I had to prove that the house had not declined in\r\nmy hands. Otherwise it would seem to me that I was robbing you." His\r\nvoice became husky with emotion. He blew his nose to recover himself a\r\nbit, and then asked, "You don\'t say anything?"\r\n\r\nBut Colomban had nothing to say. He shook his head, and waited, feeling\r\nmore and more perturbed, and fancying that he could guess what the\r\ngovernor was aiming at. It was the marriage without further delay. How\r\ncould he refuse? He would never have the strength to do so. And yet\r\nthere was that other girl, of whom he dreamed at night, devoured by\r\ninsensate passion.\r\n\r\n"Now," continued Baudu, "a sum of money has come in that may save us.\r\nThe situation becomes worse every day, but perhaps by making a supreme\r\neffort.--In short, I thought it right to warn you. We are going to\r\nventure our last stake. If we are beaten, why that will entirely ruin\r\nus! Only, my poor boy, your marriage must again be postponed, for I\r\ndon\'t wish to throw you two all alone into the struggle. That would be\r\ntoo cowardly, wouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nColomban, greatly relieved, had seated himself on a pile of molleton.\r\nHis legs were still trembling. He was afraid of showing his delight, so\r\nhe held down his head whilst rolling his fingers on his knees.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say anything?" repeated Baudu.\r\n\r\nNo, he said nothing, he could find nothing to say. Thereupon the draper\r\nslowly resumed: "I was sure this would grieve you. You must muster up\r\ncourage. Pull yourself together a bit, don\'t let yourself be crushed in\r\nthis way. Above all, understand my position. Can I hang such a weight\r\nabout your neck? Instead of leaving you a good business, I should leave\r\nyou a bankruptcy perhaps. No, only scoundrels play such tricks as that!\r\nNo doubt, I desire nothing but your happiness, but nobody shall ever\r\nmake me go against my conscience."\r\n\r\nAnd he went on for a long time in this way, meandering through a\r\nmaze of contradictory sentences, like a man who would have liked to\r\nbe understood at the first word but finds himself obliged to explain\r\neverything. As he had promised his daughter and the shop, strict\r\nprobity forced him to deliver both in good condition, without defects\r\nor debts. But he was weary, the burden seemed to be too much for him,\r\nand entreaty almost pierced though his stammering accents. At last\r\nhe got more entangled than ever, awaiting some sudden impulse from\r\nColomban, some heartfelt cry, which did not come.\r\n\r\n"I know," he murmured, "that old men are wanting in ardour. With young\r\nones, things light up. They are full of fire, it\'s only natural. But,\r\nno, no, I can\'t, my word of honour! If I gave it up to you, you would\r\nblame me later on."\r\n\r\nHe stopped, trembling, and as the young man still kept his head down,\r\nhe asked him for the third time, after a painful silence: "You don\'t\r\nsay anything?" Then, at last, without venturing to look at him,\r\nColomban replied: "There\'s nothing to say. You are the master, you know\r\nbetter than all of us. As you wish it we\'ll wait, we\'ll try and be\r\nreasonable."\r\n\r\nIt was all over. Baudu still hoped he was going to throw himself into\r\nhis arms, exclaiming: "Father, do you take a rest, we\'ll fight in\r\nour turn; give us the shop as it is, so that we may work a miracle\r\nand save it!" Then, however, he looked at him, and felt full of\r\nshame, reproaching himself for having wished to dupe his children.\r\nHis deep-rooted maniacal commercial honesty was awakened in him; it\r\nwas this prudent fellow who was right, for there is no such thing as\r\nsentiment in business, which is only a question of figures.\r\n\r\n"Embrace me, my boy," he said in conclusion. "It\'s settled; we won\'t\r\nspeak about the marriage for another year. One must think of the\r\nbusiness before everything."\r\n\r\nThat evening, in their room, when Madame Baudu questioned her husband\r\nas to the result of the conversation, the draper had regained his\r\nobstinate resolve to fight on in person to the bitter end. He gave\r\nColomban high praise, calling him a solid fellow, firm in his ideas,\r\nbrought up in the best principles, incapable, for instance, of joking\r\nwith the customers like those puppies at The Paradise. No, he was\r\nhonest, he belonged to the family, he didn\'t speculate on the business\r\nas though he were a stock-jobber.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, when\'s the marriage to take place?" asked Madame Baudu.\r\n\r\n"Later on," he replied, "when I am able to keep my promises."\r\n\r\nShe made no gestures but simply remarked: "It will be our daughter\'s\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\nBaudu restrained himself though hot with anger. He was the one whom it\r\nwould kill, if they continually upset him like this! Was it his fault?\r\nHe loved his daughter--would lay down his life for her; but he could\r\nnot make the business prosper when it obstinately refused to do so.\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve ought to have a little more sense, and wait patiently for a\r\nbetter balance. The deuce! Colomban would always be there, no one would\r\nrun away with him!\r\n\r\n"It\'s incredible!" he repeated; "such a well-trained girl!"\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu said no more. She had doubtless guessed Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s\r\njealous agony; but she did not dare to inform her husband of it. A\r\nsingular womanly modesty always prevented her from approaching certain\r\ntender, delicate subjects with him. When he saw her so silent, he\r\nturned his anger against the people opposite, stretching out his fists\r\ntowards the works, where they were that night setting up some large\r\niron girders, with a great noise of hammers.\r\n\r\nDenise had now decided to return to The Ladies\' Paradise, having\r\nunderstood that the Robineaus, obliged to cut down their staff, were\r\nat a loss how to dismiss her. To maintain their position they were now\r\nobliged to do everything themselves. Gaujean, still obstinate in his\r\nrancour, renewed their bills and even promised to find them funds;\r\nbut they were frightened, they wanted to try the effect of economy\r\nand order. During a whole fortnight Denise had felt that they were\r\nembarrassed about her, and it was she who spoke the first, saying that\r\nshe had found a situation elsewhere. This came as a great relief.\r\nMadame Robineau embraced her, deeply affected, and declaring that she\r\nshould always miss her. Then when, in answer to a question, the young\r\ngirl acknowledged that she was going back to Mouret\'s, Robineau turned\r\npale.\r\n\r\n"You are right!" he exclaimed violently.\r\n\r\nIt was not so easy to tell the news to old Bourras however. Still,\r\nDenise had to give him notice, and she trembled at the thought, for\r\nshe felt full of gratitude towards him. Bourras was at this time in\r\na rage from morn till night, for he more than any other suffered\r\nfrom the uproar of the adjacent works. The builder\'s carts blocked\r\nup his doorway; the picks tapped on his walls; umbrellas and sticks,\r\neverything in his place, danced about to the noise of the hammers. It\r\nseemed as if the hovel, obstinately remaining in the midst of these\r\ndemolitions, would suddenly split to pieces. But the worst was that the\r\narchitect, in order to connect the existing shops with those about to\r\nbe opened in the H\xc3\xb4tel Duvillard, had conceived the idea of tunnelling\r\na passage under the little house that separated them. This house now\r\nbelonged to the firm of Mouret & Co., and as the lease stipulated\r\nthat the tenant should submit to all necessary repairs, the workmen\r\none morning appeared on the scene. At this Bourras nearly went into a\r\nfit. Wasn\'t it enough that they should grip him on all sides, on the\r\nright, the left, and behind, without attacking him underfoot as well,\r\ntaking the very ground from under him! And he drove the masons away,\r\nand went to law. Repairs, yes! but this was a work of embellishment.\r\nThe neighbourhood thought he would win the day, without, however, being\r\nsure of anything. The case, at any rate, threatened to be a long one,\r\nand people became quite impassioned over this interminable duel.\r\n\r\nOn the day when Denise at last resolved to give him notice, Bourras had\r\njust returned from his lawyer\'s. "Would you believe it!" he exclaimed,\r\n"they now say that the house is not solid; they pretend that the\r\nfoundations must be strengthened. Confound it! they have shaken it up\r\nso much with their infernal machines, that it isn\'t astonishing if it\r\ngives way!"\r\n\r\nThen, when the girl announced she was going to leave, and was returning\r\nto The Ladies\' Paradise at a salary of a thousand francs, he became so\r\namazed that he could only raise his trembling hands in the air. Emotion\r\nmade him drop upon a chair.\r\n\r\n"You! you!" he stammered. "Ah, I\'m the only one--I\'m the only one\r\nleft!" And after a pause, he asked: "And the youngster?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll go back to Madame Gras\'s," replied Denise. "She was very fond of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThey again became silent. She would have rather seen him furious,\r\nswearing and banging the counter with his fist; the sight of this old\r\nman, suffocating and crushed, made her heart bleed. But he gradually\r\nrecovered, and began shouting out once more. "A thousand francs! that\r\nisn\'t to be refused. You\'ll all go. Go, then, leave me here alone. Yes,\r\nalone--you understand! One at all events will never bow his head. And\r\ntell them I\'ll win my lawsuit, if I have to sell my last shirt for it!"\r\n\r\nDenise was not to leave Robineau\'s till the end of the month. She had\r\nseen Mouret again and everything had been settled. One evening as\r\nshe was going up to her room, Deloche, who was watching for her in a\r\ndoorway, stopped her. He was delighted, having just heard the good\r\nnews; they were all talking about it in the shop, said he. And he gaily\r\ntold her of all the gossip at the counters.\r\n\r\n"The young ladies in the mantle department are pulling fearfully long\r\nfaces, you know." And then breaking off, he added: "By the way, you\r\nremember Clara Prunaire? Well, it appears the governor has taken a\r\nfancy to her."\r\n\r\nHe had turned quite red. She, very pale, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"What! Monsieur Mouret!"\r\n\r\n"Funny taste--eh?" he resumed. "A woman who looks like a horse.\r\nHowever, that\'s his business."\r\n\r\nOnce upstairs, Denise almost fainted away. It was surely through coming\r\nup too quickly. Leaning out of the window she had a sudden vision of\r\nValognes, the deserted street and grassy pavement, which she had seen\r\nfrom her room as a child; and she was seized with a desire to go and\r\nlive there once more--to seek refuge in the peace and forgetfulness of\r\nthe country. Paris irritated her, she hated The Ladies\' Paradise, she\r\nno longer knew why she had consented to go back. She would certainly\r\nsuffer there as much as formerly; she was already suffering from an\r\nunknown uneasiness since Deloche\'s stories. And then all at once a\r\nflood of tears forced her to leave the window. She continued weeping on\r\nfor some time, but at last found a little courage to live on still.\r\n\r\nThe next day at lunch time, as Robineau had sent her on an errand, and\r\nshe was passing The Old Elbeuf, she opened the door on seeing Colomban\r\nalone in the shop. The Baudus were having their meal; she could hear\r\nthe clatter of the knives and forks in the little dining-room.\r\n\r\n"You can come in," said the shopman. "They are at table."\r\n\r\nBut she motioned him to be silent, and drew him into a corner. Then,\r\nlowering her voice, she said: "It\'s you I want to speak to. Have you no\r\nheart? Can\'t you see that Genevi\xc3\xa8ve loves you, and that it\'s killing\r\nher."\r\n\r\nShe was trembling, her fever of the previous night had taken possession\r\nof her again. He, frightened and surprised by this sudden attack, stood\r\nlooking at her, without a word.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?" she continued. "Genevi\xc3\xa8ve knows you love another. She\r\ntold me so. She wept like a child. Ah, poor girl! she isn\'t very\r\nstrong now, I can tell you! If you had seen her thin arms! It\'s\r\nheart-breaking. You can\'t leave her to die like this!"\r\n\r\nAt last he spoke, quite overcome. "But she isn\'t ill--you exaggerate! I\r\ndon\'t see anything myself. Besides, it\'s her father who is postponing\r\nthe marriage."\r\n\r\nDenise sharply corrected this falsehood, certain as she was that\r\nthe least insistence on the young man\'s part would have decided her\r\nuncle. As for Colomban\'s surprise, however, it was not feigned; he had\r\nreally never noticed Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s slow agony. For him it was a very\r\ndisagreeable revelation; for while he remained ignorant of it, he had\r\nno great blame to tax himself with.\r\n\r\n"And who for indeed?" resumed Denise. "For an utterly worthless girl!\r\nYou can\'t know whom you are loving! So far I have not wished to hurt\r\nyour feelings, I have often avoided answering your continual questions.\r\nWell! she goes about with everybody, she laughs at you, and will never\r\nmarry you."\r\n\r\nHe listened to her, turning very pale; and at each of the sentences she\r\nthrew in his face, his lips quivered. She, in a cruel fit, yielded to a\r\ntransport of anger of which she had no consciousness. "In short," she\r\nsaid, in a final cry, "she\'s Monsieur Mouret\'s mistress if you want to\r\nknow!"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke her voice died away in her throat and she turned even\r\npaler than Colomban himself. Both stood looking at each other. Then he\r\nstammered out: "I love her!"\r\n\r\nDenise felt ashamed of herself. Why was she talking in this fashion\r\nto this young fellow? Why was she getting so excited? She stood there\r\nmute, the simple reply which he had just given her resounded in her\r\nheart like the distant but deafening clang of a bell. "I love her, I\r\nlove her!" and it seemed to spread. He was right, he could not marry\r\nanother woman.\r\n\r\nAnd as she turned round, she observed Genevi\xc3\xa8ve on the threshold of the\r\ndining-room. "Be quiet!" she said rapidly.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late, Genevi\xc3\xa8ve must have heard, for her face was white\r\nand bloodless. Just at that moment a customer opened the door--Madame\r\nBourdelais, one of the last faithful customers of The Old Elbeuf,\r\nwhere she found substantial goods for her money. For a long time past\r\nMadame de Boves had followed the fashion, and gone over to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise; Madame Marty also no longer came, being entirely subjugated\r\nby the fascinations of the display opposite. And Genevi\xc3\xa8ve was forced\r\nto come forward, and inquire in her weak voice:\r\n\r\n"What do you desire, madame?"\r\n\r\nMadame Bourdelais wished to see some flannel. Colomban took down a roll\r\nfrom a shelf. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve showed the stuff; and once again the young\r\npeople found themselves close together behind the counter. Meanwhile\r\nBaudu came out of the dining-room, behind his wife, who went to seat\r\nherself at the pay-desk. At first he did not meddle with the sale, but\r\nafter smiling at Denise stood there, looking at Madame Bourdelais.\r\n\r\n"It is not good enough," said the latter. "Show me the thickest you\r\nhave."\r\n\r\nColomban took down another bundle. There was a silence. Madame\r\nBourdelais examined the stuff.\r\n\r\n"How much?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Six francs, madame," replied Genevi\xc3\xa8ve.\r\n\r\nThe lady made an abrupt gesture. "Six francs!" said she. "But they have\r\nthe same opposite at five francs."\r\n\r\nA slight contraction passed over Baudu\'s face. He could not help\r\ninterfering politely. No doubt madame made a mistake, indeed the stuff\r\nought to have been sold at six francs and a half; it was impossible\r\nto sell it at five francs. It must be another quality that she was\r\nreferring to.\r\n\r\n"No, no," she repeated, with the obstinacy of a house-wife who prided\r\nherself on her knowledge of such matters. "The quality is the same. The\r\nother may even be a little thicker."\r\n\r\nAnd the discussion ended by becoming quite bitter. Baudu with his bile\r\nrising to his face had to make an effort to continue smiling. His\r\nrancour against The Ladies\' Paradise was bursting in his throat.\r\n\r\n"Really," said Madame Bourdelais at last, "you must treat me better for\r\notherwise I shall go opposite, like the others."\r\n\r\nThereupon he lost his head, and, shaking with all the passion he had\r\nrestrained, cried out: "Well! go opposite then!"\r\n\r\nAt this she got up, greatly wounded, and went off without turning\r\nround, but saying: "That\'s just what I am going to do, sir."\r\n\r\nA general stupor ensued. The governor\'s violence had frightened all of\r\nthem. He was himself scared, and trembled at what he had just said. The\r\nphrase had escaped him against his will in an explosion of long pent-up\r\nrancour. And the Baudus now stood there motionless, their arms hanging\r\nby their sides as they watched Madame Bourdelais cross the street. She\r\nseemed to be carrying off their fortune. When with a tranquil step she\r\npassed through the lofty portal of The Ladies\' Paradise and they saw\r\nher disappear in the crowd, they felt a sort of sudden wrench.\r\n\r\n"There\'s another they\'ve taken from us!" murmured the draper. And\r\nturning towards Denise, of whose re-engagement he was aware, he said:\r\n"You as well, they\'ve taken you back. Oh, I don\'t blame you for it. As\r\nthey\'ve got the money, they are naturally the strongest."\r\n\r\nJust then, Denise, still hoping that Genevi\xc3\xa8ve had not overheard\r\nColomban, was saying to her: "He loves you. Try and cheer up."\r\n\r\nBut in a very low and heart-broken voice the girl replied: "Why do\r\nyou tell me a falsehood? Look! he can\'t help it, he\'s glancing up\r\nthere again. I know very well that they\'ve stolen him from me, just as\r\nthey\'ve robbed us of everything else."\r\n\r\nThen she went to sit down at the desk beside her mother. The latter\r\nhad doubtless guessed the fresh blow which her daughter had received,\r\nfor her anxious eyes wandered from her to Colomban, and then to The\r\nParadise. It was true, they had stolen everything from them: from\r\nthe father, his fortune; from the mother, her dying child; from the\r\ndaughter, the husband, for whom she had waited ten long years. In\r\npresence of this condemned family, Denise, whose heart was overflowing\r\nwith pity, felt for an instant afraid that she might be wicked. For\r\nwas she not going to assist that machine which was crushing the poor?\r\nHowever, she was carried away, as it were, by an invisible force, and\r\nfelt that she could be doing no wrong.\r\n\r\n"Bah!" resumed Baudu, to give himself courage; "we shan\'t die of\r\nit, after all. For one customer lost we shall find two others. You\r\nhear, Denise, I\'ve got over seventy thousand francs there, which will\r\ncertainly make your Mouret spend some sleepless nights. Come, come, you\r\nothers, don\'t look so glum!"\r\n\r\nBut he could not enliven them. He himself relapsed into a pale\r\nconsternation; and they all remained with their eyes fixed on the\r\nmonster, attracted, possessed, glutting themselves with thoughts of\r\ntheir misfortune. The work was now nearly finished, the scaffoldings\r\nhad been removed from the front, a whole side of the colossal edifice\r\nappeared, with its white walls and large light windows. Beside the\r\nfootway, where traffic had at last been resumed, stood eight delivery\r\nvans which the messengers were loading one after the other outside the\r\nparcels-office. In the sunshine, a ray of which enfiladed the street,\r\nthe vehicles\' green panels, picked out with red and yellow, sparkled\r\nlike so many mirrors, and cast blinding reflections even into the\r\ndepths of The Old Elbeuf. The drivers, clad in black and dignified in\r\nmanner, held the horses well in--superb horses they were, champing\r\nsilvered bits. And each time a van was loaded, there came a sonorous\r\nroll over the paving stones which made all the little neighbouring\r\nshops tremble. And then in presence of this triumphal procession,\r\nthe sight of which they must needs endure twice a day, the Baudus\'\r\nhearts broke. The father half fainted away, asking himself where this\r\ncontinual stream of goods could go to; whilst the mother, sickening at\r\nthought of her daughter\'s torture, continued gazing blankly into the\r\nstreet, her eyes blurred by big tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on a Monday, the 14th of March, that The Ladies\' Paradise\r\ninaugurated its new buildings by a great exhibition of summer\r\nnovelties, which was to last three days. Outside, a sharp north wind\r\nwas blowing and the passers-by, surprised by this return of winter,\r\nhurried along buttoning up their overcoats. In the neighbouring\r\nshops, however, all was fermentation; and against the windows one\r\ncould see the pale faces of the petty tradesmen, counting the first\r\ncarriages which stopped before the new grand entrance in the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin. This doorway, lofty and deep like a church porch,\r\nand surmounted by an emblematical group of Industry and Commerce\r\nhand-in-hand amidst a variety of symbols--was sheltered by a vast\r\nglazed _marquise_, the fresh gilding of which seemed to light up the\r\npavement with a ray of sunshine. To the right and left the shop fronts,\r\nof a blinding whiteness, stretched along the Rue Monsigny and the\r\nRue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, occupying the whole block, except on the Rue\r\ndu Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre side, where the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier intended to build.\r\nAnd along these barrack-like frontages, the petty tradesmen, whenever\r\nthey raised their heads, could see the piles of goods through the\r\nlarge plate-glass windows which, from the ground floor to the second\r\nstorey, opened the house to the light of day. And this enormous cube,\r\nthis colossal bazaar which concealed the sky from them, seemed in some\r\ndegree the cause of the cold which made them shiver behind their frozen\r\ncounters.\r\n\r\nAs early as six o\'clock, Mouret was on the spot, giving his final\r\norders. In the centre, starting from the grand entrance, a large\r\ngallery ran from end to end, flanked right and left by two narrower\r\nones, the Monsigny Gallery and the Michodi\xc3\xa8re Gallery. Glass roofings\r\ncovered the court-yards turned into huge halls, iron staircases\r\nascended from the ground floor, on both upper floors iron bridges were\r\nthrown from one end to the other of the establishment. The architect,\r\nwho happened to be a young man of talent, with modern ideas, had only\r\nused stone for the basement and corner work, employing iron for all the\r\nrest of the huge carcass--columns upholding all the assemblage of beams\r\nand joists. The vaulting of the ceilings, like the partitions, was of\r\nbrick. Space had been gained everywhere; light and air entered freely,\r\nand the public circulated with the greatest ease under the bold flights\r\nof the far-stretching girders. It was the cathedral of modern commerce,\r\nlight but strong, the very thing for a nation of customers. Below, in\r\nthe central gallery, after the door bargains, came the cravat, glove,\r\nand silk departments; the Monsigny Gallery was occupied by the linen\r\nand Rouen goods; and the Michodi\xc3\xa8re Gallery by the mercery, hosiery,\r\ndrapery, and woollens. Then, on the first floor came the mantle,\r\nunder-linen, shawl, lace, and various new departments, whilst the\r\nbedding, the carpets, the furnishing materials, all the cumbersome\r\narticles difficult to handle, had been relegated to the second floor.\r\nIn all there were now thirty-nine departments with eighteen hundred\r\nemployees, two hundred of whom were women. Quite a little world abode\r\nthere, amidst the sonorous life of the high metallic naves.\r\n\r\nMouret\'s unique passion was to conquer woman. He wished her to be\r\nqueen in his house, and had built this temple that he might there\r\nhold her completely at his mercy. His sole aim was to intoxicate her\r\nwith gallant attentions, traffic on her desires, profit by her fever.\r\nNight and day he racked his brain to invent fresh attractions. He\r\nhad already introduced two velvet-padded lifts, in order to spare\r\ndelicate ladies the trouble of climbing the stairs to the upper floors.\r\nThen, too, he had just opened a bar where the customers could find\r\ngratuitous light refreshments, syrups and biscuits, and a reading-room,\r\na monumental gallery decorated with excessive luxury, in which he had\r\neven ventured on an exhibition of pictures. But his deepest scheme\r\nwas to conquer the mother through her child, when unable to do so\r\nthrough her own coquetry; and to attain this object there was no\r\nmeans that he neglected. He speculated on every sentiment, created\r\nspecial departments for little boys and girls, and waylaid the passing\r\nmothers with distributions of chromo-lithographs and air-balls for the\r\nchildren. There was real genius in his idea of presenting each buyer\r\nwith a red air-ball made of fine gutta-percha and bearing in large\r\nletters the name of the establishment. Held by a string it floated in\r\nthe air and sailed along every street like a living advertisement.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest power of all was the advertising. Mouret now spent\r\nthree hundred thousand francs a year in catalogues, advertisements,\r\nand bills.[1] For his summer sale he had launched forth two hundred\r\nthousand catalogues, fifty thousand of which went abroad, translated\r\ninto every language. He now had them illustrated with engravings,\r\nand embellished with samples, gummed to the leaves. There was an\r\noverflowing display; the name of The Ladies\' Paradise met the eye all\r\nover the world, it invaded the walls and hoardings, the newspapers,\r\nand even the curtains of the theatres. He claimed that woman was\r\npowerless against advertising, that she was bound to be attracted by\r\nuproar. Analyzing her moreover like a great moralist he laid still\r\nmore enticing traps for her. Thus he had discovered that she could\r\nnot resist a bargain, that she bought without necessity whenever she\r\nthought she saw a thing cheap, and on this observation he based his\r\nsystem of reductions, progressively lowering the price of unsold\r\narticles, and preferring to sell them at a loss rather than keep them\r\nby him, given his principle of constantly renewing his goods. And he\r\nhad penetrated still further into the heart of woman, and had just\r\nplanned the system of "returns", a masterpiece of Jesuitical seduction.\r\n"Take whatever you like, madame; you can return it if you find you\r\ndon\'t like it." And the woman who hesitated, herein found a last\r\nexcuse, the possibility of repairing an act of folly were it deemed\r\ntoo extravagant: she took the article with an easy conscience. And now\r\nthe returns and reduction of prices system formed part of the everyday\r\nworking of the new style of business.\r\n\r\n[1] After all, this is only \xc2\xa312,000 or about a quarter of the amount\r\nwhich a single English firm of soap-manufacturers spends in advertising\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nBut where Mouret revealed himself as an unrivalled master was in the\r\ninterior arrangement of his shops. He laid it down as a law that not a\r\ncorner of The Ladies\' Paradise ought to remain deserted; he required\r\na noise, a crowd, evidence of life everywhere; for life, said he,\r\nattracts life, increases and multiplies it. And this principle he\r\napplied in a variety of ways. In the first place, there ought always\r\nto be a crush at the entrance, so that the people in the street should\r\nmistake it for a riot; and he obtained this crush by placing a lot of\r\nbargains at the doors, shelves and baskets overflowing with low-priced\r\narticles; and so the common people crowded there, stopping up the\r\ndoorway and making the shop look as if it were crammed with customers,\r\nwhen it was often only half full. Then, in the galleries, he found a\r\nmeans of concealing the departments where business occasionally became\r\nslack; for instance, he surrounded the shawl department in summer, and\r\nthe printed calico department in winter, with other busy departments,\r\nsteeping them in continual uproar. It was he alone who had thought of\r\nreserving the second-floor for the carpet and furniture galleries; for\r\ncustomers were less numerous in such departments which if placed on the\r\nground floor would have often presented a chilly void. If he could only\r\nhave managed it, he would have let the street run through his shop.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, Mouret was absorbed in another wonderful\r\ninspiration. On the Saturday evening, whilst giving a last look at\r\nthe preparations for the Monday\'s great sale, he had been struck with\r\nthe idea that the arrangement of the departments adopted by him was\r\nidiotic; and yet it seemed a perfectly logical one: the stuffs on one\r\nside, the made-up articles on the other, an intelligent order of things\r\nwhich would enable customers to find their way about by themselves. He\r\nhad dreamt of some such orderly arrangement in the old days of Madame\r\nH\xc3\xa9douin\'s narrow shop; but now, just as he had carried out his idea, he\r\nfelt his faith shaken. And he suddenly cried out that they would "have\r\nto alter all that." They had forty-eight hours before them, and half of\r\nwhat had been done had to be changed. The staff, utterly bewildered,\r\nhad been obliged to work two nights and all day on Sunday, amidst\r\nfrightful disorder. On the Monday morning even, an hour before the\r\nopening, there were still some goods remaining to be placed. Decidedly\r\nthe governor was going mad, no one understood the meaning of it all,\r\nand general consternation prevailed.\r\n\r\n"Come, look sharp!" cried Mouret, with the quiet assurance of genius.\r\n"There are some more costumes to be taken upstairs. And the Japan\r\ngoods, are they placed on the central landing? A last effort, my boys,\r\nyou\'ll see the sale by-and-by."\r\n\r\nBourdoncle had also been there since daybreak. He did not understand\r\nthe alterations any more than the others did and followed the\r\ngovernor\'s movements with an anxious eye. He hardly dared to ask him\r\nany questions, knowing how Mouret received people in these critical\r\nmoments. However, he at last made up his mind, and gently inquired:\r\n"Was it really necessary to upset everything like that, on the eve of\r\nour sale?"\r\n\r\nAt first Mouret shrugged his shoulders without replying. Then as the\r\nother persisted, he burst out: "So that all the customers should heap\r\nthemselves into one corner--eh? A nice idea of mine! I should never\r\nhave got over it! Don\'t you see that it would have localised the crowd.\r\nA woman would have come in, gone straight to the department she wanted,\r\npassed from the petticoat to the dress counter, from the dress to the\r\nmantle gallery, and then have retired, without even losing herself for\r\na moment! Not one would have thoroughly seen the establishment!"\r\n\r\n"But, now that you have disarranged everything, and thrown the goods\r\nall over the place," remarked Bourdoncle, "the employees will wear out\r\ntheir legs in guiding the customers from department to department."\r\n\r\nMouret made a gesture of superb contempt. "I don\'t care a fig for\r\nthat! They\'re young, it\'ll make them grow! So much the better if they\r\ndo walk about! They\'ll appear more numerous, and increase the crowd.\r\nThe greater the crush the better; all will go well!" He laughed, and\r\nthen deigned to explain his idea, lowering his voice: "Look here,\r\nBourdoncle, this is what the result will be. First, this continual\r\ncirculation of customers will disperse them all over the shop,\r\nmultiply them, and make them lose their heads; secondly, as they must\r\nbe conducted from one end of the establishment to the other, if,\r\nfor instance, they require a lining after purchasing a dress, these\r\njourneys in every direction will triple the size of the house in their\r\neyes; thirdly, they will be forced to traverse departments where\r\nthey would never have set foot otherwise, temptations will present\r\nthemselves on their passage, and they will succumb; fourthly----"\r\nBut Bourdoncle was now laughing with him. At this Mouret, delighted,\r\nstopped to call out to the messengers: "Very good, my boys! now for a\r\nsweep, and it\'ll be splendid!"\r\n\r\nHowever, on turning round he perceived Denise. He and Bourdoncle\r\nwere standing opposite the ready-made departments, which he had just\r\ndismembered by sending the dresses and costumes up to the second-floor\r\nat the other end of the building. Denise, the first down, was opening\r\nher eyes with astonishment, quite bewildered by the new arrangements.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" she murmured; "are we going to move?"\r\n\r\nThis surprise appeared to amuse Mouret, who adored these sensational\r\neffects. Early in February Denise had returned to The Ladies\' Paradise,\r\nwhere she had been agreeably surprised to find the staff polite, almost\r\nrespectful. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie especially proved very kind; Marguerite\r\nand Clara seemed resigned; whilst old Jouve bowed his head, with an\r\nawkward, embarrassed air, as if desirous of effacing all disagreeable\r\nmemories of the past. It had sufficed for Mouret to say a few words\r\nand everybody was whispering and following her with their eyes. And in\r\nthis general amiability, the only things that hurt her were Deloche\'s\r\nsingularly melancholy glances and Pauline\'s inexplicable smiles.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mouret was still looking at her in his delighted way.\r\n\r\n"What is it you want, mademoiselle?" he asked at last.\r\n\r\nDenise had not noticed him. She blushed slightly. Since her return\r\nshe had received various marks of kindness from him which had greatly\r\ntouched her. On the other hand Pauline--she knew not why--had given\r\nher a full account of the governor\'s and Clara\'s love affairs; and\r\noften returned to the subject, alluding at the same time to that Madame\r\nDesforges, with whom the whole shop was well acquainted. Such stories\r\nstirred Denise\'s heart; and now, in Mouret\'s presence, she again felt\r\nall her former fears, an uneasiness in which her gratitude struggled\r\nagainst her anger.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all this confusion going on in the place," she murmured.\r\n\r\nThereupon Mouret approached her and said in a lower voice: "Have the\r\ngoodness to come to my office this evening after business. I wish to\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\nGreatly agitated, she bowed her head without replying a word; and went\r\ninto the department where the other saleswomen were now arriving.\r\nBourdoncle, however, had overheard Mouret, and looked at him with a\r\nsmile. He even ventured to say when they were alone: "That girl again!\r\nBe careful; it will end by becoming serious!"\r\n\r\nBut Mouret hastily defended himself, concealing his emotion beneath an\r\nair of superior indifference. "Never fear, it\'s only a joke! The woman\r\nwho\'ll catch me isn\'t born, my dear fellow!"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the shop was opening at last, he rushed off to give a\r\nfinal look at the various departments. Bourdoncle shook his head.\r\nThat girl Denise, so simple and quiet, began to make him feel uneasy.\r\nThe first time, he had conquered by a brutal dismissal. But she had\r\nreturned, and he felt her power to be so much increased that he now\r\ntreated her as a redoubtable adversary, remaining mute before her and\r\nagain patiently waiting developments. When he overtook Mouret, he found\r\nhim downstairs, in the Saint-Augustin Hall, opposite the entrance door,\r\nwhere he was shouting:\r\n\r\n"Are you playing the fool with me? I ordered the blue parasols to be\r\nput as a border. Just pull all that down, and be quick about it!"\r\n\r\nHe would listen to nothing; a gang of messengers had to come and\r\nre-arrange the exhibition of parasols. Then seeing that customers were\r\narriving, he even had the doors closed for a moment, declaring that\r\nhe would rather keep the place shut than have the blue parasols in\r\nthe centre. It ruined his composition. The renowned dressers of the\r\nParadise, Hutin, Mignot, and others, came to look at the change he was\r\ncarrying out, but they affected not to understand it, theirs being a\r\ndifferent school.\r\n\r\nAt last the doors were again opened, and the crowd flowed in. From\r\nthe outset, long before the shop was full, there was such a crush at\r\nthe doorway that they were obliged to call the police to regulate the\r\ntraffic on the foot pavement. Mouret had calculated correctly; all\r\nthe housewives, a compact troop of middle-class women and work women,\r\nswarmed around the bargains and remnants displayed in the open street.\r\nThey felt the "hung" goods at the entrance; calico at seven sous the\r\nm\xc3\xa8tre, wool and cotton grey stuff at nine sous, and, above all, some\r\nOrleans at seven sous and a half, which was fast emptying the poorer\r\npurses. Then there was feverish jostling and crushing around the\r\nshelves and baskets where articles at reduced prices, lace at two sous,\r\nribbon at five, garters at three the pair, gloves, petticoats, cravats,\r\ncotton socks, and stockings, were quickly disappearing, as if swallowed\r\nup by the voracious crowd. In spite of the cold, the shopmen who were\r\nselling in the street could not serve fast enough. One woman cried out\r\nwith pain in the crush and two little girls were nearly stifled.\r\n\r\nAll the morning this crush went on increasing. Towards one o\'clock\r\nthere was a crowd waiting to enter; the street was blocked as in a\r\ntime of riot. Just at that moment, as Madame de Boves and her daughter\r\nBlanche stood hesitating on the pavement opposite, they were accosted\r\nby Madame Marty, also accompanied by her daughter Valentine.\r\n\r\n"What a crowd--eh?" said the countess. "They\'re killing themselves\r\ninside. I ought not to have come, I was in bed, but got up to take a\r\nlittle fresh air."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just like me," said the other. "I promised my husband to go and\r\nsee his sister at Montmartre. Then just as I was passing, I thought\r\nof a piece of braid I wanted. I may as well buy it here as anywhere\r\nelse, mayn\'t I? Oh, I shan\'t spend another sou! in fact I don\'t want\r\nanything."\r\n\r\nHowever, seized, carried away as it were, by the force of the crowd,\r\nthey did not take their eyes off the door.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I\'m not going in, I\'m afraid," murmured Madame de Boves.\r\n"Blanche, let\'s go away, we should be crushed."\r\n\r\nBut her voice failed her, she was gradually yielding to a desire to\r\nfollow the others; and her fears dissolved before the irresistible\r\nattractions of the crush. Madame Marty likewise was giving way,\r\nrepeating the while: "Keep hold of my dress, Valentine. Ah, well! I\'ve\r\nnever seen such a thing before. I\'m lifted off my feet. What will it be\r\ninside?"\r\n\r\nCaught by the current the ladies could not now go back. Just as rivers\r\nattract the fugitive waters of a valley, so it seemed as if the stream\r\nof customers, flowing into the vestibule, was absorbing the passers-by,\r\ndrinking in people from the four corners of Paris. They advanced\r\nbut slowly, squeezed almost to death, and maintained upright by the\r\nshoulders around them; and their desires already derived enjoyment from\r\nthis painful entrance which heightened their curiosity. It was a medley\r\nof ladies arrayed in silk, of poorly dressed middle-class women, and of\r\nbare-headed girls, all excited and carried away by the same passion. A\r\nfew men, buried beneath the overflowing bosoms, were casting anxious\r\nglances around them. A nurse, in the thickest of the crowd, held her\r\nbaby above her head, the youngster crowing with delight. The only one\r\nto get angry was a skinny woman who broke out into bad words, accusing\r\nher neighbour of digging right into her.\r\n\r\n"I really think I shall lose my skirts in this crowd," remarked Madame\r\nde Boves.\r\n\r\nMute, her face still cool from the open air, Madame Marty was standing\r\non tip-toe in her endeavour to catch a glimpse of the depths of the\r\nshop before the others. The pupils of her grey eyes were as contracted\r\nas those of a cat coming out of the broad daylight, and she had the\r\nrestful feeling, and clear expression of a person just waking up.\r\n\r\n"Ah, at last!" said she, heaving a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe ladies had just extricated themselves. They were in the\r\nSaint-Augustin Hall, which they were greatly surprised to find almost\r\nempty. But a feeling of comfort penetrated them, they seemed to be\r\nentering into spring after emerging from the winter of the street.\r\nWhilst the piercing wind, laden with rain and hail, was still blowing\r\nout of doors, the fine season was already budding forth in The Paradise\r\ngalleries, with the light stuffs, soft flowery shades and rural gaiety\r\nof summer dresses and parasols.\r\n\r\n"Do look there!" exclaimed Madame de Boves, standing motionless, her\r\neyes in the air.\r\n\r\nIt was the exhibition of parasols. Wide-open and rounded like shields,\r\nthey covered the whole hall, from the glazed roofing to the varnished\r\noak mouldings below. They described festoons round the arches of the\r\nupper storeys; they descended in garlands down the slender columns;\r\nthey ran in close lines along the balustrades of the galleries and the\r\nstaircases; and everywhere ranged symmetrically, speckling the walls\r\nwith red, green, and yellow, they looked like huge Venetian lanterns,\r\nlighted up for some colossal entertainment. In the corners were more\r\ncomplicated designs, stars composed of parasols at thirty-nine sous\r\nwhose light shades, pale blue, cream-white, and blush rose, had the\r\nsubdued glow of night-lights; whilst, up above, immense Japanese\r\nparasols, on which golden-coloured cranes soared in purple skies,\r\nblazed forth with fiery reflections.\r\n\r\nMadame Marty endeavouring to find a phrase to express her rapture,\r\nexclaimed: "It\'s like fairyland!" And then trying to find out where she\r\nwas she continued: "Let\'s see, the braid is in the mercery department.\r\nI shall buy my braid and be off."\r\n\r\n"I will go with you," said Madame de Boves. "Eh? Blanche, we\'ll just go\r\nthrough the shop, nothing more."\r\n\r\nBut they had hardly left the door before they lost themselves. They\r\nturned to the left, and as the mercery department had been moved,\r\nthey dropped into the one devoted to collarettes, cuffs, trimmings,\r\netc. A hot-house heat, moist and close, laden with the insipid odour\r\nof the materials, and muffling the tramping of the crowd, prevailed\r\nin the galleries. Then they returned to the door, where an outward\r\ncurrent was already established, an interminable _d\xc3\xa9fil\xc3\xa9_ of women\r\nand children, above whom hovered a multitude of red air-balls. Forty\r\nthousand of these were ready; there were men specially placed for their\r\ndistribution; and to see the customers on their way out, one might have\r\nimagined that a flight of enormous soap-bubbles, reflecting the fiery\r\nglare of the parasols, was hovering in the air. The whole place was\r\nilluminated by them.\r\n\r\n"There\'s quite a world here!" declared Madame de Boves. "You hardly\r\nknow where you are."\r\n\r\nHowever, the ladies could not remain in the eddy of the door, right in\r\nthe crush of the entrance and exit. Fortunately, inspector Jouve came\r\nto their assistance. He stood in the vestibule, grave and attentive,\r\neyeing each woman as she passed. Specially charged with the indoor\r\npolice service he was on the look-out for thieves and "lifters."\r\n\r\n"The mercery department, ladies?" said he obligingly, "turn to the\r\nleft; you see! just there behind the hosiery department."\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves thanked him. But Madame Marty, on turning round, no\r\nlonger saw her daughter Valentine beside her. She was beginning to\r\nfeel frightened, when she caught sight of her, already a long way\r\noff, at the end of the Saint-Augustin Hall, deeply absorbed before a\r\ntable covered with a heap of women\'s cravats at nineteen sous. Mouret\r\npractised the system of offering articles to the customers, hooking\r\nand plundering them as they passed; for he made use of every sort of\r\nadvertisement, laughing at the discretion of certain fellow-tradesmen\r\nwho thought their goods should be left to speak for themselves. Special\r\nsalesmen, idle and smooth-tongued Parisians, in this way got rid of\r\nconsiderable quantities of small trashy things.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!" murmured Valentine, "just look at these cravats. They have\r\na bird embroidered at one corner."\r\n\r\nThe shopman cracked up the article, swore that it was all silk, that\r\nthe manufacturer had become bankrupt, and that they would never have\r\nsuch a bargain again.\r\n\r\n"Nineteen sous--is it possible?" said Madame Marty, tempted like her\r\ndaughter. "Well! I can take a couple, that won\'t ruin us."\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves, however, disdained this style of thing; she detested\r\nto have things offered to her. A shopman calling her made her run away.\r\nMadame Marty, surprised, could not understand such nervous horror of\r\ncommercial quackery, for she was of another nature; she was one of\r\nthose women who delight in being thus caressed by a public offer, in\r\nplunging their hands into everything, and wasting their time in useless\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n"Now," said she, "I\'m going for my braid. I don\'t wish to see anything\r\nelse."\r\n\r\nHowever, as she crossed the scarf and glove departments, her heart once\r\nmore failed her. Here in the diffuse light was a display made up of\r\nbright gay colours, of ravishing effect. The counters, symmetrically\r\narranged, seemed like so many flower-borders, changing the hall into\r\na French garden, where smiled a soft scale of blossoms. Lying now on\r\nthe bare wood, now in open boxes, and now protruding from overflowing\r\ndrawers was a quantity of silk handkerchiefs of every hue. You\r\nfound the bright scarlet of the geranium, the creamy white of the\r\npetunia, the golden yellow of the chrysanthemum, the celestial azure\r\nof the verbena; and higher up, on brass rods, another florescence\r\nwas entwined, a florescence of carelessly hung _fichus_ and unrolled\r\nribbons, quite a brilliant _cordon_, which extended on and on, climbing\r\nthe columns and constantly multiplying in the mirrors. But what most\r\nattracted the throng was a Swiss chalet in the glove department, a\r\nchalet made entirely of gloves, Mignot\'s _chef d\'\xc5\x93uvre_ which it had\r\ntaken him two days to arrange. In the first place, the ground-floor\r\nwas composed of black gloves; and then in turn came straw-coloured,\r\nmignonette, and tan-coloured gloves, distributed over the decoration,\r\nbordering the windows, outlining the balconies, and taking the place of\r\nthe tiles.\r\n\r\n"What do you desire, madame?" asked Mignot, on seeing Madame Marty\r\nplanted before the cottage. "Here are some Su\xc3\xa8de gloves at one franc\r\nseventy-five centimes the pair, first quality."\r\n\r\nHe offered his wares with furious energy, calling the passing customers\r\nto his counter and dunning them with his politeness. And as she shook\r\nher head in token of refusal he continued: "Tyrolian gloves, one franc\r\ntwenty-five. Turin gloves for children, embroidered gloves in all\r\ncolours."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I don\'t want anything," declared Madame Marty.\r\n\r\nBut realising that her voice was softening, he attacked her with\r\ngreater energy than ever, holding the embroidered gloves before her\r\neyes; and she could not resist, she bought a pair. Then, as Madame de\r\nBoves looked at her with a smile, she blushed.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think me childish--eh? If I don\'t make haste and get my\r\nbraid and be off, I shall be done for."\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was such a crush in the mercery department that\r\nshe could not get served. They had both been waiting for over ten\r\nminutes, and were getting annoyed, when a sudden meeting with Madame\r\nBourdelais and her three children diverted their attention. Madame\r\nBourdelais explained, with her quiet practical air, that she had\r\nbrought the little ones to see the show. Madeleine was ten, Edmond\r\neight, and Lucien four years old; and they were laughing with joy, it\r\nwas a cheap treat which they had long looked forward to.\r\n\r\n"Those red parasols are really too comical; I must buy one," said\r\nMadame Marty all at once, stamping with impatience at doing nothing.\r\n\r\nShe choose one at fourteen francs and a half; whereupon Madame\r\nBourdelais, after watching the purchase with a look of censure, said to\r\nher amicably: "You are wrong to be in such a hurry. In a month\'s time\r\nyou could have had it for ten francs. They won\'t catch me like that."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she developed quite a theory of careful housekeeping.\r\nSince the shops lowered their prices, it was simply a question of\r\nwaiting. She did not wish to be taken in by them, she preferred to\r\nprofit by their real bargains. She even showed some malice in the\r\nstruggle, boasting that she had never left them a sou of profit.\r\n\r\n"Come," said she at last, "I\'ve promised my little ones to show them\r\nthe pictures upstairs in the reading-room. Come up with us, you have\r\nplenty of time."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the braid was forgotten. Madame Marty yielded at once,\r\nwhilst Madame de Boves declined, preferring to take a turn on the\r\nground-floor first of all. Besides, they were sure to meet again\r\nupstairs. Madame Bourdelais was looking for a staircase when she\r\nperceived one of the lifts; and thereupon she pushed her children into\r\nit, in order to cap their pleasure. Madame Marty and Valentine also\r\nentered the narrow cage, where they were very closely packed; however\r\nthe mirrors, the velvet seats, and the polished brasswork took up so\r\nmuch of their attention that they reached the first floor without\r\nhaving felt the gentle ascent of the machine. Another pleasure was\r\nin store for them, in the first gallery. As they passed before the\r\nrefreshment bar, Madame Bourdelais did not fail to gorge her little\r\nfamily with syrup. It was a square room with a large marble counter;\r\nat either end there were silvered filters from which trickled small\r\nstreams of water; whilst rows of bottles stood on small shelves\r\nbehind. Three waiters were continually engaged in wiping and filling\r\nthe glasses. To restrain the thirsty crowd, they had been obliged to\r\nimitate the practice followed at theatres and railway-stations, by\r\nerecting a barrier draped with velvet. The crush was terrific. Some\r\npeople, whom these gratuitous treats rendered altogether unscrupulous,\r\nreally made themselves ill.\r\n\r\n"Well! where are they?" exclaimed Madame Bourdelais, when she\r\nextricated herself from the crowd, after wiping the children\'s faces\r\nwith her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nBut she caught sight of Madame Marty and Valentine at the further\r\nend of another gallery, a long way off. Buried beneath a heap of\r\npetticoats, they were still buying. There was no more restraint, mother\r\nand daughter vanished in the fever of expenditure which was carrying\r\nthem away. When Madame Bourdelais at last reached the reading-room she\r\ninstalled Madeleine, Edmond, and Lucien before the large table; and\r\ntaking some photographic albums from one of the book-cases she brought\r\nthem to them. The ceiling of the long apartment was covered with\r\ngilding; at either end was a monumental chimney-piece; some pictures of\r\nno great merit but very richly framed, covered the walls; and between\r\nthe columns, before each of the arched bays opening into the shop,\r\nwere tall green plants in majolica vases. A silent throng surrounded\r\nthe table, which was littered with reviews and newspapers, with here\r\nand there some ink-stands, boxes of stationery, and blotting-pads.\r\nLadies took off their gloves, and wrote letters on the paper stamped\r\nwith the name of the establishment, through which they ran their\r\npens. A few gentlemen, lolling back in armchairs, were reading the\r\nnewspapers. But a great many people sat there doing nothing: these\r\nwere husbands waiting for their wives, who were roaming through the\r\nvarious departments, young women on the watch for their lovers, and old\r\nrelations left there as in a cloak-room, to be taken away when it was\r\ntime to leave. And all these people lounged and rested whilst glancing\r\nthrough the open bays into the depths of the galleries and the halls,\r\nwhence a distant murmur ascended amidst the scratching of pens and the\r\nrustling of newspapers.\r\n\r\n"What! you here!" said Madame Bourdelais all at once. "I didn\'t\r\nrecognise you."\r\n\r\nNear the children sat a lady, her face hidden by the open pages of a\r\nreview. It was Madame Guibal. She seemed annoyed at the meeting; but\r\nquickly recovering herself, related that she had come to sit down for a\r\nmoment in order to escape the crush. And as Madame Bourdelais asked her\r\nif she was going to make any purchases, she replied with her languorous\r\nair, veiling the egoistical greediness of her glance with her eyelids:\r\n\r\n"Oh! no. On the contrary, I have come to return some goods. Yes, some\r\ndoor-curtains which I don\'t like. But there is such a crowd that I am\r\nwaiting to get near the department."\r\n\r\nThen she went on talking, saying how convenient this system of returns\r\nwas; formerly she had never bought anything, but now she sometimes\r\nallowed herself to be tempted. In fact, she returned four articles\r\nout of every five, and was getting known at all the counters for the\r\nstrange trafficking she carried on--a trafficking easily divined by the\r\nperpetual discontent which made her bring back her purchases one by\r\none, after she had kept them several days. However, whilst speaking,\r\nshe did not take her eyes off the doors of the reading-room; and she\r\nappeared greatly relieved when Madame Bourdelais rejoined her children,\r\nto explain the photographs to them. Almost at the same moment Monsieur\r\nde Boves and Paul de Vallagnosc came in. The count, who affected to\r\nbe showing the young man through the new buildings, exchanged a quick\r\nglance with Madame Guibal; and she then plunged into her review again,\r\nas if she had not seen him.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Paul!" suddenly exclaimed a voice behind the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIt was Mouret taking a glance round the various departments. They shook\r\nhands, and he at once inquired:\r\n\r\n"Has Madame de Boves done us the honour of coming?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no," replied the husband, "and she very much regrets it. She\'s\r\nnot very well. Oh! nothing dangerous, however!"\r\n\r\nBut he suddenly pretended to catch sight of Madame Guibal, and hastened\r\noff, approaching her bareheaded, whilst the others merely bowed to her\r\nfrom a distance. She also pretended to be surprised. Paul smiled; he\r\nnow understood the affair, and he related to Mouret in a low voice how\r\nBoves, whom he had met in the Rue de Richelieu, had tried to get away\r\nfrom him, and had finished by dragging him into The Ladies\' Paradise,\r\nunder the pretext that he must show him the new buildings. For the last\r\nyear the lady had drawn all the money she could from Boves, making\r\nconstant appointments with him in public places, churches, museums, and\r\nshops.\r\n\r\n"Just look at him," added the young man, "isn\'t he splendid, standing\r\nthere before her with his dignified air? It\'s the old French gallantry,\r\nmy dear fellow, the old French gallantry!"\r\n\r\n"And your marriage?" asked Mouret.\r\n\r\nPaul, without taking his eyes off the count, replied that they were\r\nstill waiting for the death of the aunt. Then, with a triumphant air,\r\nhe added: "There, did you see him? He stooped down, and slipped an\r\naddress into her hand. She\'s now accepting the rendezvous with the\r\nmost virtuous air. She\'s a terrible woman is that delicate red-haired\r\ncreature with her careless ways. Well! some fine things go on in your\r\nplace!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" replied Mouret, smiling, "these ladies are not in my house, they\r\nare at home here."\r\n\r\nThen, still continuing his gossip, he carried his old comrade along\r\nto the threshold of the reading-room, opposite the grand central\r\ngallery, whose successive halls spread out below them. In the rear,\r\nthe reading-room still retained its quietude, only disturbed by the\r\nscratching of pens and the rustling of newspapers. One old gentleman\r\nhad gone to sleep over the _Moniteur_. Monsieur de Boves was looking\r\nat the pictures, with the evident intention of losing his future\r\nson-in-law in the crowd as soon as possible. And, alone, amid this\r\ncalmness, Madame Bourdelais was amusing her children, talking very\r\nloudly, as in a conquered place.\r\n\r\n"You see, they are quite at home," said Mouret, who pointed with a\r\nbroad gesture to the multitude of women with which the departments were\r\noverflowing.\r\n\r\nJust then Madame Desforges, after nearly having her mantle carried away\r\nin the crowd, at last effected an entrance and crossed the first hall.\r\nThen, on reaching the principal gallery, she raised her eyes. It was\r\nlike a railway span, surrounded by the balustrades of the two storeys,\r\nintersected by hanging stairways and crossed by flying bridges. The\r\niron staircases developed bold curves, which multiplied the landings;\r\nthe bridges suspended in space, ran straight along at a great height;\r\nand in the white light from the windows all this iron work formed an\r\nexcessively delicate architecture, an intricate lace-work through which\r\nthe daylight penetrated, the modern realization of a dreamland palace,\r\nof a Babel with storeys piled one above the other, and spacious halls\r\naffording glimpses of other floors and other halls _ad infinitum_. In\r\nfact, iron reigned everywhere: the young architect had been honest and\r\ncourageous enough not to disguise it under a coating of paint imitating\r\nstone or wood. Down below, in order not to outshine the goods, the\r\ndecoration was sober, with large regular spaces in neutral tints; then\r\nas the metallic work ascended, the capitals of the columns became\r\nricher, the rivets formed ornaments, the shoulder-pieces and corbels\r\nwere covered with sculptured work; and at last, up above, glistened\r\npainting, green and red, amidst a prodigality of gold, floods of gold,\r\nheaps of gold, even to the glazed-work, whose panes were enamelled and\r\ninlaid with gold. In the galleries, the bare brick-work of the arches\r\nwas also decorated in bright colours. Mosaics and faience likewise\r\nformed part of the decoration, enlivening the friezes, and lighting up\r\nthe severe _ensemble_ with their fresh tints; whilst the stairs, with\r\nred-velvet covered hand-rails, were edged with bands of polished iron,\r\nwhich shone like the steel of armour.\r\n\r\nAlthough Madame Desforges was already acquainted with the new\r\nestablishment, she stopped short, struck by the ardent life which that\r\nday animated the immense nave. Below and around her continued the\r\neddying of the crowd; the double current of those entering and those\r\nleaving, making itself felt as far as the silk department. It was still\r\na crowd of very mixed elements, though the afternoon was bringing a\r\ngreater number of ladies amongst the shopkeepers and house-wives. There\r\nwere many women in mourning, with flowing veils; and there were always\r\nsome wet nurses straying about and protecting their infantile charges\r\nwith their outstretched arms. And this sea of faces, of many-coloured\r\nhats and bare heads, both dark and fair, rolled from one to the\r\nother end of the galleries, vague and discoloured amidst the glare\r\nof the stuffs. On all sides Madame Desforges saw large price-tickets\r\nbearing enormous figures and showing prominently against the bright\r\nprinted cottons, the shining silks, and the sombre woollens. Piles of\r\nribbons half hid the heads of the customers, a wall of flannel threw\r\nout a promontory; on all sides mirrors multiplied the departments,\r\nreflecting the displays and the groups of people, now showing faces\r\nreversed, and now halves of shoulders and arms; whilst to the right and\r\nto the left the lateral galleries opened up other vistas, the snowy\r\ndepths of the linen department and the speckled depths of the hosiery\r\ncounters--distant views which were illumined by rays of light from some\r\nglazed bay, and in which the crowd seemed but so much human dust. Then,\r\nwhen Madame Desforges raised her eyes, she beheld on the staircases\r\nand the flying bridges and behind the balustrades of each successive\r\nstorey, a continual buzzing ascent, an entire population in the air,\r\npassing along behind the open work of this huge carcass of metal and\r\nshowing blackly against the diffuse light from the enamelled glass.\r\nLarge gilded lustres were suspended from the ceiling; decorations of\r\nrugs, embroidered silks and stuffs worked with gold, hung down, draping\r\nthe balustrades as with gorgeous banners; and, from one to the other\r\nend were clouds of lace, palpitations of muslin, trophies of silks,\r\nfairy-like groups of half-dressed dummies; and right at the top, above\r\nall the confusion, the bedding department, hanging, as it were, in the\r\nair, displayed its little iron bedsteads provided with mattresses, and\r\nhung with curtains, the whole forming a sort of school dormitory asleep\r\namidst the tramping of the customers, who became fewer and fewer as the\r\ndepartments ascended.\r\n\r\n"Does madame require a cheap pair of garters?" asked a salesman\r\nof Madame Desforges on seeing her standing still. "All silk, at\r\ntwenty-nine sous."\r\n\r\nShe did not condescend to answer. Things were being offered around her\r\nmore feverishly than ever. She wanted, however, to find out where she\r\nwas. Albert Lhomme\'s pay-desk was on her left; he knew her by sight\r\nand ventured to give her an amiable smile, not showing the least hurry\r\namidst the heaps of bills by which he was besieged; though behind him,\r\nJoseph, struggling with the string-box, could not pack up the articles\r\nfast enough. She then saw where she was; the silk department must be\r\nin front of her. But it took her ten minutes to reach it, so dense\r\nwas the crowd becoming. Up in the air, at the end of their invisible\r\nstrings, the red air-balls had become more numerous than ever; they now\r\nformed clouds of purple, gently blowing towards the doors whence they\r\ncontinued scattering over Paris; and she had to bow her head beneath\r\ntheir flight whenever very young children held them with the string\r\nrolled round their little fingers.\r\n\r\n"What! you have ventured here, madame?" exclaimed Bouthemont gaily, as\r\nsoon as he caught sight of Madame Desforges.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the silk department, introduced to her by Mouret\r\nhimself, now occasionally called on her at her five o\'clock tea. She\r\nthought him common, but very amiable, of a fine sanguine temper, which\r\nsurprised and amused her. Moreover some two days previously he had\r\nboldly told her of the intrigue between Mouret and Clara, He had not\r\ndone this with any calculating motive but out of sheer stupidity,\r\nlike a fellow who loves a joke. She, however, stung with jealousy,\r\nconcealing her wounded feelings beneath an appearance of disdain, had\r\nthat afternoon come to try and discover her rival, a young lady in the\r\nmantle department, so Bouthemont had told her, though declining to give\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\n"Do you require anything to-day?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Of course, or I should not have come. Have you any _foulard_ for\r\nmorning gowns?"\r\n\r\nShe hoped to obtain the name of the young lady from him, for she was\r\nfull of a desire to see her. He immediately called Favier; and then\r\nwent on chatting whilst waiting for the salesman, who was just serving\r\nanother customer. This happened to be "the pretty lady," that beautiful\r\nblonde of whom the whole department occasionally spoke, without knowing\r\nanything of her life or even her name. This time the pretty lady was\r\nin deep mourning. Whom could she have lost--her husband or her father?\r\nNot her father, for she would have appeared more melancholy. What had\r\nthey all been saying then? She could not be a questionable character;\r\nshe must have had a real husband--that is unless she were in mourning\r\nfor her mother. For a few minutes, despite the press of business, the\r\ndepartment exchanged these various speculations.\r\n\r\n"Make haste! it\'s intolerable!" cried Hutin to Favier, when he returned\r\nfrom showing his customer to the pay-desk. "Whenever that lady is here\r\nyou never seem to finish. She doesn\'t care a fig for you!"\r\n\r\n"She cares a deuced sight more for me than I do for her!" replied the\r\nvexed salesman.\r\n\r\nBut Hutin threatened to report him to the directors if he did not show\r\nmore respect for the customers. The second-hand was becoming terrible,\r\nof a morose severity ever since the department had conspired to get\r\nhim Robineau\'s place. He even showed himself so intolerable, after all\r\nthe promises of good-fellowship, with which he had formerly warmed his\r\ncolleagues\' zeal, that the latter were now secretly supporting Favier\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, no back answers," replied Hutin sharply. "Monsieur\r\nBouthemont wishes you to show some _foulards_ of the lightest patterns."\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the department, an exhibition of summer silks\r\nillumined the hall with an aurora-like brilliancy, like the rising\r\nof a planet amidst the most delicate tints: pale rose, soft yellow,\r\nlimpid blue, indeed the whole scarf of Iris. There were _foulards_ of\r\na cloudy fineness, surahs lighter than the down falling from trees,\r\nsatined pekins as soft and supple as a Chinese beauty\'s skin. Then\r\ncame Japanese pongees, Indian tussores and corahs, without counting\r\nthe light French silks, the narrow stripes, the small checks and the\r\nflowered patterns, all the most fanciful designs, which made one think\r\nof ladies in furbelows, strolling in the sweet May mornings, under the\r\nspreading trees of some park.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take this, the Louis XIV, with figured roses," said Madame\r\nDesforges at last.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst Favier was measuring it, she made a last attempt with\r\nBouthemont, who had remained near her.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going up to the ready-made department to see if they have any\r\ntravelling cloaks. Is she fair, the young lady you were talking about?"\r\n\r\nThe manager, who felt rather anxious on finding her so persistent,\r\nmerely smiled. But, just at that moment, Denise passed by. She had just\r\ncome from the merinoes which were in the charge of Li\xc3\xa9nard to whom she\r\nhad escorted Madame Boutarel, that provincial lady who came to Paris\r\ntwice a year, to scatter the money she saved out of her housekeeping\r\nall over the Ladies\' Paradise. And thereupon, just as Favier was about\r\nto take up Madame Desforges\'s silk, Hutin, thinking to annoy him,\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite unnecessary, Mademoiselle will have the kindness to conduct\r\nthis lady."\r\n\r\nDenise, quite confused, at once took charge of the parcel and the\r\ndebit-note. She could never meet this young man face to face without\r\nexperiencing a feeling of shame, as if he reminded her of some former\r\nfault; and yet she had only sinned in her dreams.\r\n\r\n"But just tell me," said Madame Desforges, in a low tone, to\r\nBouthemont, "isn\'t it this awkward girl? He has taken her back, I see?\r\nIt must be she who is the heroine of the adventure!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," replied the silk manager, still smiling, but fully decided\r\nnot to tell the truth.\r\n\r\nMadame Desforges then slowly ascended the staircase, preceded by\r\nDenise; but after every two or three steps she had to pause in order\r\nto avoid being carried away by the descending crowd. In the living\r\nvibration of the whole building, the iron supports seemed to sway under\r\nyour feet as if quivering beneath the breath of the multitude. On each\r\nstair was a strongly fixed dummy, displaying some garment or other: a\r\ncostume, cloak, or dressing-gown; and the whole was like a double row\r\nof soldiers at attention whilst some triumphal procession went past.\r\n\r\nMadame Desforges was at last reaching the first storey, when a still\r\ngreater surging of the crowd forced her to stop once more. Beneath her\r\nshe now had the departments on the ground-floor, with the press of\r\ncustomers through which she had just passed. This was a new spectacle,\r\na sea of fore-shortened heads, swarming with agitation like an\r\nant-hill. The white price-tickets now seemed but so many narrow lines,\r\nthe piles of ribbon became quite squat, the promontory of flannel\r\nwas but a thin partition barring the gallery; whilst the carpets and\r\nthe embroidered silks which decked the balustrades hung down like\r\nprocessional banners suspended from the gallery of a church. In the\r\ndistance Madame Desforges could perceive some corners of the lateral\r\ngalleries, just as from the top of a steeple one perceives the corners\r\nof neighbouring streets, with black specks of passers-by moving about.\r\nBut what surprised her above all, in the weariness of her eyes blinded\r\nby the brilliant medley of colours, was, on lowering their lids,\r\nto realize the presence of the crowd more keenly than ever, by its\r\ndull roar like that of the rising tide, and the human warmth that it\r\nexhaled. A fine dust rose from the floor, laden with _odore di femina_,\r\na penetrating perfume, which seemed like the incense of this temple\r\nraised for the worship of woman.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mouret, still standing before the reading-room with\r\nVallagnosc, was inhaling this odour, intoxicating himself with it, and\r\nrepeating: "They are quite at home. I know some who spend the whole day\r\nhere, eating cakes and writing letters. There\'s only one thing left me\r\nto do, and that is, to find them beds."\r\n\r\nThis joke made Paul smile, he who, in his pessimistic boredom\r\nconsidered the turbulence of this multitude running after a lot of\r\ngew-gaws to be idiotic. Whenever he came to give his old comrade a\r\nlook-up, he went away almost vexed to find him so full of life amidst\r\nhis people of coquettes. Would not one of them, with shallow brain and\r\nempty heart, some day make him realize the stupidity and uselessness of\r\nlife? That very day Octave seemed to have lost some of his equilibrium;\r\nhe who generally inspired his customers with a fever, with the tranquil\r\ngrace of an operator, was as though caught by the passion which was\r\ngradually consuming the whole establishment. Since he had caught sight\r\nof Denise and Madame Desforges coming up the grand staircase, he had\r\nbeen talking louder, gesticulating against his will; and though he\r\naffected not to turn his face towards them, he grew more and more\r\nanimated as he felt them drawing nearer. His face became flushed and in\r\nhis eyes was a little of that bewildered rapture with which the eyes of\r\nhis customers at last quivered.\r\n\r\n"You must be fearfully robbed," murmured Vallagnosc, who thought that\r\nthe crowd looked very criminal.\r\n\r\nMouret threw his arms out. "My dear fellow, it\'s beyond all\r\nimagination," said he.\r\n\r\nAnd, nervously, delighted at having something to talk about, he gave\r\na number of details, related cases, and classified the delinquents.\r\nIn the first place, there were the professional thieves; these women\r\ndid the least harm of all, for the police knew every one of them. Then\r\ncame the kleptomaniacs, who stole from a perverse desire, a new form\r\nof nervous affection which a doctor had classed, showing it to be the\r\nresult of the temptations of the big shops. And finally came the women\r\nwho were _enceintes_ and whose thefts were invariably thefts of some\r\nespecially coveted article. For instance, at the house of one of them,\r\nthe district commissary of police had found two hundred and forty-eight\r\npairs of pink gloves stolen from well nigh every shop in Paris.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what gives the women such funny eyes here, then," murmured\r\nVallagnosc, "I\'ve been watching them with their greedy, shameful looks,\r\nlike mad creatures. A fine school for honesty!"\r\n\r\n"Hang it!" replied Mouret, "though we make them quite at home, we\r\ncan\'t let them take the goods away under their mantles. And sometimes\r\nthey are very respectable people. Last week we caught the sister of a\r\nchemist, and the wife of a judge. Yes, the wife of a judge! However, we\r\nalways try to settle these matters."\r\n\r\nHe paused to point out Jouve, who was just then looking sharply after\r\na woman at the ribbon counter below. This woman, who appeared to be\r\nsuffering a great deal from the jostling of the crowd, was accompanied\r\nby a friend, whose mission seemed to be to protect her against all\r\nhurt, and each time she stopped in a department, Jouve kept his eyes on\r\nher, whilst her friend near by ransacked the card-board boxes at her\r\nease.\r\n\r\n"Oh! he\'ll catch her!" resumed Mouret; "he knows all their tricks."\r\n\r\nBut his voice trembled and he laughed in an awkward manner. Denise and\r\nHenriette, whom he had ceased to watch, were at last passing behind\r\nhim, after having had a great deal of trouble to get out of the crush.\r\nHe turned round suddenly, and bowed to his customer with the discreet\r\nair of a friend who does not desire to compromise a woman by stopping\r\nher in a crowd of people. But Henriette, on the alert, had at once\r\nperceived the look with which he had first enveloped Denise. It must be\r\nthis girl--thought she--yes, this was the rival she had been curious to\r\ncome and see.\r\n\r\nIn the mantle department, the young ladies were fast losing their\r\nheads. Two of them had fallen ill, and Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric, the\r\nsecond-hand, had quietly given notice the previous day, and repaired to\r\nthe cashier\'s office to take her money, leaving The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nat a minute\'s notice, just as The Ladies\' Paradise itself discharged\r\nits employees. Ever since the morning, in spite of the feverish rush of\r\nbusiness, every one had been talking of this affair. Clara, still kept\r\nin the department by Mouret\'s caprice, thought it grand. Marguerite\r\nrelated how exasperated Bourdoncle was; whilst Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, greatly\r\nvexed, declared that Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric ought at least to have informed\r\nher, for such hypocrisy had never before been heard of.\r\n\r\nAlthough Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric had never confided in any one, she was\r\nsuspected of having relinquished her position to marry the proprietor\r\nof some baths in the neighbourhood of the Halles.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a travelling cloak that madame desires, I believe?" inquired\r\nDenise of Madame Desforges, after offering her a chair.\r\n\r\n"Yes," curtly replied the latter, who had made up her mind to be\r\nimpolite.\r\n\r\nThe new decorations of the department were of a rich severity: on\r\nall sides were high carved oak cupboards with mirrors filling the\r\nwhole space of their panels, while a red carpet muffled the continued\r\ntramping of the customers. Whilst Denise went off to fetch the cloaks,\r\nMadame Desforges, who was looking round, perceived her face in a glass;\r\nand she continued contemplating herself. Was she getting old then that\r\nshe should be cast aside for the first-comer? The glass reflected the\r\nentire department with all its commotion, but she only beheld her own\r\npale face; she did not hear Clara behind her, relating to Marguerite a\r\nstory of Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric\'s mysterious goings-on, the manner in which\r\nshe went out of her way night and morning so as to pass through the\r\nPassage Choiseul, and thus make people believe that she lived over the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"Here are our latest designs," said Denise. "We have them in several\r\ncolours."\r\n\r\nShe laid out four or five cloaks. Madame Desforges looked at them with\r\na scornful air, and became harsher at each fresh one that she examined.\r\nWhat was the reason of those pleats which made the garment look so\r\nscanty? And that other one, square across the shoulders, why, you might\r\nhave thought it had been cut out with a hatchet! Though people went\r\ntravelling they could not dress like sentry-boxes!\r\n\r\n"Show me something else, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\nDenise unfolded and refolded the garments without the slightest sign\r\nof ill temper. And it was just this calm, serene patience which\r\nexasperated Madame Desforges the more. Her glances continually returned\r\nto the glass in front of her. Now that she saw herself there, close to\r\nDenise she ventured on a comparison. Was it possible that he should\r\nprefer that insignificant creature to herself? She now remembered that\r\nthis was the girl whom she had formerly seen cutting such a silly\r\nfigure at the time of her d\xc3\xa9but--as clumsy as any peasant wench freshly\r\narrived from her village. No doubt she looked better now, stiff and\r\ncorrect in her silk gown. But how puny, how common-place she was!\r\n\r\n"I will show you some other patterns, madame," said Denise, quietly.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned, the scene began again. Then it was the cloth that\r\nwas too heavy or of no good whatever. And Madame Desforges turned\r\nround, raising her voice, and endeavouring to attract Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s\r\nattention, in the hope of getting the girl a scolding. But Denise,\r\nsince her return, had gradually conquered the department, and now\r\nfelt quite at home in it; the first-hand had even recognised that she\r\npossessed some rare and valuable qualities as a saleswoman--a stubborn\r\nsweetness, a smiling force of conviction. And thus when Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nheard Madame Desforges she simply shrugged her shoulders, taking care\r\nnot to interfere.\r\n\r\n"Would you kindly tell me the kind of garment you require, madame?"\r\nasked Denise, once more, with her polite persistence, which nothing\r\ncould discourage.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got nothing!" exclaimed Madame Desforges.\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, surprised to feel a hand laid on her shoulder.\r\nIt was the hand of Madame Marty, who was being carried through the\r\nestablishment by her fever for spending. Since the cravats, the\r\nembroidered gloves, and the red parasol, her purchases had increased to\r\nsuch an extent that the last salesman had just decided to place them\r\nall on a chair, as to have carried them on his arm, might have broken\r\nit; and he walked in front of her, drawing along the chair, upon which\r\npetticoats, napkins, curtains, a lamp, and three straw hats were heaped\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said she, "you are buying a travelling cloak."\r\n\r\n"Oh! dear, no," replied Madame Desforges; "they are frightful."\r\n\r\nHowever Madame Marty had just noticed a striped cloak which she rather\r\nliked. Her daughter Valentine was already examining it. So Denise\r\ncalled Marguerite to clear the article out of the department, it being\r\none of the previous year\'s patterns, and Marguerite, at a glance from\r\nher comrade, presented it as an exceptional bargain. When she had sworn\r\nthat they had twice lowered the price, that they had reduced it from\r\na hundred and fifty francs, to a hundred and thirty, and that it was\r\nnow ticketed at a hundred and ten, Madame Marty could not withstand\r\nthe temptation of its cheapness. She bought it, and the salesman who\r\naccompanied her thereupon went off, leaving the chair and the parcels\r\nbehind him with all the debit-notes attached to the goods.\r\n\r\nWhilst Marguerite was debiting the cloak, Madame Marty turned her head,\r\nand on catching sight of Clara made a slight sign to Madame Desforges,\r\nthen whispered to her: "Monsieur Mouret\'s caprice, you know!"\r\n\r\nThe other, in surprise, looked round at Clara; and then, after again\r\nturning her eyes on Denise, replied: "But it isn\'t the tall one; it\'s\r\nthe little one!"\r\n\r\nAnd as Madame Marty could not be sure which of the two it was, Madame\r\nDesforges resumed aloud, with the scorn of a lady for chambermaids:\r\n"Perhaps both!"\r\n\r\nDenise had heard everything, and raised her large, pure eyes on this\r\nlady who was thus wounding her, and whom she did not know. No doubt\r\nit was the lady of whom people had spoken to her, the lady with whom\r\nMouret\'s name was so often associated. In the glances that were\r\nexchanged between them, Denise displayed such melancholy dignity, such\r\nfrank innocence, that Henriette felt quite uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"As you have nothing presentable to show me here, conduct me to the\r\ndress and costume department," she said all at once.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go with you as well," exclaimed Madame Marty, "I wanted to see a\r\ncostume for Valentine."\r\n\r\nMarguerite thereupon took the chair by its back, and dragged it along\r\non its hind legs, which were getting rather worn by this species of\r\nlocomotion. Denise on her side only carried the few yards of silk,\r\nbought by Madame Desforges. They had, however, quite a journey before\r\nthem now that the robes and costumes were installed on the second\r\nfloor, at the other end of the establishment.\r\n\r\nAnd the long walk commenced along the crowded galleries. Marguerite\r\nwent in front, drawing the chair along, like some little vehicle,\r\nand slowly opening a passage. As soon as she reached the under-linen\r\ndepartment, Madame Desforges began to complain: wasn\'t it ridiculous,\r\na shop where you were obliged to walk a couple of leagues to find the\r\nleast thing! Madame Marty also declared that she was tired to death,\r\nyet she none the less enjoyed this fatigue, this slow exhaustion of\r\nstrength, amidst the inexhaustible wealth of merchandise displayed on\r\nevery side. Mouret\'s idea, full of genius, had absolutely subjugated\r\nher and she paused in each fresh department. She made a first halt\r\nbefore the trousseaux, tempted by some chemises which Pauline sold\r\nher; and Marguerite then found herself relieved of the burden of\r\nthe chair, which Pauline had to take, with the debit-notes. Madame\r\nDesforges might have gone on her way, and thus have liberated Denise\r\nmore speedily, but she seemed happy to feel her behind her, motionless\r\nand patient, whilst she also lingered, advising her friend. In the\r\nbaby-linen department the ladies went into ecstasies, but, of course,\r\nwithout buying anything. Then Madame Marty\'s weaknesses began anew; she\r\nsuccumbed successively before a black silk corset, a pair of fur cuffs,\r\nsold at a reduction on account of the lateness of the season, and some\r\nRussian lace much in vogue at that time for trimming table-linen. All\r\nthese things were heaped up on the chair, the number of parcels still\r\nincreased, making the chair creak; and the salesmen who succeeded\r\none another, found it more and more difficult to drag the improvised\r\nvehicle along as its load became heavier and heavier.\r\n\r\n"This way, madame," said Denise without a murmur, after each halt.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s absurd!" exclaimed Madame Desforges. "We shall never get\r\nthere. Why did they not put the dresses and costumes near the mantles\r\ndepartment? It _is_ a mess!"\r\n\r\nMadame Marty, whose eyes were sparkling, intoxicated by the succession\r\nof riches dancing before her, repeated in an undertone: "Oh, dear! What\r\nwill my husband say? You are right, there is no order in this place. A\r\nperson loses herself and commits all sorts of follies."\r\n\r\nOn the great central landing there was scarcely room for the chair to\r\npass, as Mouret had just blocked the open space with a lot of fancy\r\ngoods--cups mounted on gilt zinc, flash dressing-cases and liqueur\r\nstands--being of opinion that the crowd there was not sufficiently\r\ngreat, and that circulation was too easy. And he had also authorized\r\none of his shopmen to exhibit on a small table there some Chinese and\r\nJapanese curiosities, low-priced knick-knacks which customers eagerly\r\nsnatched up. It was an unexpected success, and he already thought of\r\nextending this branch of his business. Whilst two messengers carried\r\nthe chair up to the second floor, Madame Marty purchased six ivory\r\nstuds, some silk mice, and a lacquered match-box.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor the journey began afresh. Denise, who had been\r\nshowing customers about in this way ever since the morning, was sinking\r\nwith fatigue; but she still continued correct, gentle, and polite.\r\nShe again had to wait for the ladies in the furnishing materials\r\ndepartment, where a delightful cretonne had caught Madame Marty\'s eye.\r\nThen, in the furniture department, a work-table took her fancy. Her\r\nhands trembled, and with a laugh she was entreating Madame Desforges to\r\nprevent her from spending any more money, when a meeting with Madame\r\nGuibal furnished her with an excuse to continue her purchases. The\r\nmeeting took place in the carpet department, whither Madame Guibal had\r\ngone to return some Oriental door-curtains which she had purchased five\r\ndays previously. And she was standing there, talking to the salesman,\r\na brawny fellow with sinewy arms, who from morning to night carried\r\nloads heavy enough to break a bullock\'s back. Naturally he was in\r\nconsternation at this "return," which deprived him of his commission,\r\nand so did his best to embarrass his customer, suspecting some queer\r\nadventure, no doubt a ball given with these curtains, bought at The\r\nLadies\' Paradise, and then returned, to avoid the cost of hire at an\r\nupholsterer\'s. He knew indeed that this was frequently done by the\r\neconomical middle-class people. In short, she must have some reason\r\nfor returning them; if she did not like the designs or the colours, he\r\nwould show her others, he had a most complete assortment. To all these\r\ninsinuations, however, Madame Guibal with queenly assurance replied\r\nquietly that the curtains did not suit her; and she did not deign to\r\nadd any explanation. She refused to look at any others, and he was\r\nobliged to give way, for the salesmen had orders to take the goods back\r\neven if they saw that they had been used.\r\n\r\nAs the three ladies went off together, and Madame Marty referred\r\nremorsefully to the work-table for which she had no earthly need,\r\nMadame Guibal said in her calm voice: "Well! you can return it. You saw\r\nit was quite easy. Meantime let them send it to your house. You can put\r\nit in your drawing-room, keep it for a time and then if you don\'t like\r\nit, return it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s a good idea!" exclaimed Madame Marty. "If my husband makes\r\ntoo much fuss, I\'ll send everything back." This was for her the supreme\r\nexcuse, she ceased calculating and went on buying, with the secret\r\nwish, however, to keep everything, for she was not one of those women\r\nwho give things back.\r\n\r\nAt last they arrived in the dress and costume department. But as\r\nDenise was about to deliver to another young lady the silk which\r\nMadame Desforges had purchased the latter seemed to change her mind,\r\nand declared that she would decidedly take one of the travelling\r\ncloaks, the light grey one with the hood; and Denise then had to wait\r\ncomplacently till she was ready to return to the mantle department. The\r\ngirl felt that she was being treated like a servant by this imperious,\r\nwhimsical customer; but she had vowed to do her duty, and retained her\r\ncalm demeanour, notwithstanding the rising of her heart and rebellion\r\nof her pride. Madame Desforges bought nothing in the dress and costume\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n"Oh! mamma," said Valentine, "if that little costume should only fit\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nIn a low tone, Madame Guibal was explaining her tactics to Madame\r\nMarty. When she saw a dress she liked in a shop, she had it sent home,\r\ntook a pattern of it, and then sent it back. And thereupon Madame Marty\r\nbought the costume for her daughter remarking: "A good idea! You are\r\nvery practical, my dear madame."\r\n\r\nThey had been obliged to abandon the chair. It had been left in\r\ndistress, in the furniture department, beside the work-table, for its\r\nweight had become too great, and its hind legs threatened to break\r\noff. So it was arranged that all the purchases should be centralized\r\nat one pay-desk, and thence sent down to the delivery department.\r\nAnd then the ladies, still accompanied by Denise, began roaming all\r\nover the establishment, making a second appearance in nearly every\r\ndepartment. They were ever on the stairs and in the galleries; and at\r\neach moment some fresh meeting brought them to a standstill. Thus, near\r\nthe reading-room, they once more came across Madame Bourdelais and her\r\nthree children. The youngsters were loaded with parcels: Madeleine had\r\na dress for herself under her arm, Edmond was carrying a collection of\r\nlittle shoes, whilst the youngest, Lucien, was wearing a new cap.\r\n\r\n"You as well!" said Madame Desforges, laughingly, to her old\r\nschool-friend.\r\n\r\n"Pray, don\'t speak of it!" exclaimed Madame Bourdelais. "I\'m furious.\r\nThey get hold of us by the little ones now! You know how little I spend\r\non myself! But how can you expect me to resist the entreaties of these\r\nchildren, who want everything? I merely came to show them round, and\r\nhere am I plundering the whole establishment!"\r\n\r\nMouret, who still happened to be there, with Vallagnosc and Monsieur de\r\nBoves, listened to her with a smile. She observed it, and complained\r\ngaily, though with an undercurrent of real irritation, of these traps\r\nlaid for a mother\'s affection; the idea that she had just yielded to\r\nthe force of puffery raised her indignation, and he, still smiling,\r\nbowed, fully enjoying his triumph. Monsieur de Boves meanwhile had\r\nman\xc5\x93uvred so as to get near Madame Guibal, whom he ultimately followed,\r\nfor the second time trying to lose Vallagnosc; but the latter, weary of\r\nthe crush, hastened to rejoin him. And now once more Denise was brought\r\nto a standstill, obliged to wait for the ladies. She turned her back,\r\nand Mouret himself affected not to see her. But from that moment Madame\r\nDesforges, with the delicate scent of a jealous woman, had no further\r\ndoubt. Whilst he was complimenting her and walking beside her, like a\r\ngallant host, she became deeply absorbed in thought, wondering how she\r\ncould convict him of his treason.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Monsieur de Boves and Vallagnosc, who had gone on in front\r\nwith Madame Guibal, reached the lace department, a luxurious room,\r\nsurrounded by nests of carved oak drawers, which were constantly being\r\nopened and shut. Around the columns, covered with red velvet, spirals\r\nof white lace ascended; and from one to the other end of the department\r\nhung festoons of guipure, whilst on the counters were quantities of\r\nlarge cards, wound round with Valenciennes, Malines, and hand-made\r\npoint. At the further end two ladies were seated before a mauve silk\r\n_transparent_, on which Deloche was placing some pieces of Chantilly,\r\nthe ladies meantime looking on in silence and without making up their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" said Vallagnosc, quite surprised, "you said that Madame de\r\nBoves was unwell. But she is standing over there, near that counter,\r\nwith Mademoiselle Blanche."\r\n\r\nThe count could not help starting back, and casting a side glance at\r\nMadame Guibal. "Dear me! so she is," said he.\r\n\r\nIt was very warm in this room. The half stifled customers had pale\r\nfaces with glittering eyes. It seemed as if all the seductions of the\r\nshop converged to this supreme temptation, this secluded corner of\r\nperdition where the strongest must succumb. Women plunged their hands\r\ninto the overflowing heaps, quivering with intoxication at the contact.\r\n\r\n"I fancy those ladies are ruining you," resumed Vallagnosc, amused by\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Boves assumed the look of a husband who is perfectly sure\r\nof his wife\'s discretion, from the simple fact that he does not give\r\nher a copper to spend. The countess, after wandering through all the\r\ndepartments with her daughter, without buying anything, had just\r\nstranded in the lace department in a rage of unsated desire. Overcome\r\nwith fatigue, she was leaning against the counter while her clammy\r\nhands dived into a heap of lace whence a warmth rose to her shoulders.\r\nThen suddenly, just as her daughter turned her head and the salesman\r\nwent away, it occurred to her to slip a piece of point d\'Alen\xc3\xa7on under\r\nher mantle. But she shuddered, and dropped it, on hearing Vallagnosc\r\ngaily saying: "Ah! we\'ve caught you, madame."\r\n\r\nFor several seconds she stood there speechless and very pale. Then she\r\nexplained that, feeling much better, she had thought she would take a\r\nstroll. And on noticing that her husband was with Madame Guibal, she\r\nquite recovered herself, and looked at them with such a dignified air\r\nthat the other lady felt obliged to say: "I was with Madame Desforges,\r\nthese gentlemen just met us."\r\n\r\nAs it happened the other ladies came up just at that moment,\r\naccompanied by Mouret who again detained them to point out Jouve,\r\nwho was still following the suspicious woman and her lady friend. It\r\nwas very curious, said he, they could not form an idea of the number\r\nof thieves arrested in the lace department. Madame de Boves, who was\r\nlistening, fancied herself between a couple of gendarmes, with her\r\nforty-five years, her luxury, and her husband\'s high position; however,\r\nshe felt no remorse, but reflected that she ought to have slipped the\r\nlace up her sleeve. Jouve, however, had just decided to lay hold of\r\nthe suspicious woman, despairing of catching her in the act, but fully\r\nsuspecting that she had filled her pockets, by means of some sleight\r\nof hand which had escaped him. But when he had taken her aside and\r\nsearched her, he was wild with confusion at finding nothing on her--not\r\na cravat, not a button. Her friend had disappeared. All at once he\r\nunderstood: the woman he had searched had only been there as a blind;\r\nit was the friend who had done the trick.\r\n\r\nThis affair amused the ladies. Mouret, rather vexed, merely said: "Old\r\nJouve has been floored this time but he\'ll have his revenge."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" replied Vallagnosc, "I don\'t think he\'s equal to it. Besides, why\r\ndo you display such a quantity of goods? It serves you right, if you\r\nare robbed. You ought not to tempt these poor, defenceless women so."\r\n\r\nThis was the last word, which sounded like the supreme note of the day,\r\nin the growing fever that reigned in the establishment. The ladies\r\nseparated, crossing the crowded departments for the last time. It\r\nwas four o\'clock, the rays of the setting sun were darting obliquely\r\nthrough the large front windows and throwing a cross light on the\r\nglazed roofs of the halls; and in this red, fiery glow arose, like a\r\ngolden vapour, the thick dust raised by the circulation of the crowd\r\nsince early morning. A broad sheet of light streamed along the grand\r\ncentral gallery, showing up the staircases, the flying bridges, all\r\nthe network of suspended iron. The mosaics and faiences of the friezes\r\nglittered, the green and red paint reflected the fire of the lavish\r\ngilding. The Paradise seemed like a red-hot furnace, in which the\r\nvarious displays--the palaces of gloves and cravats, the festoons of\r\nribbons and laces, the lofty piles of linen and calico, the variegated\r\nparterres in which bloomed the light silks and foulards--were now\r\nburning. The exhibition of parasols, of shield-like roundness, threw\r\nforth metallic reflections. In the distance, beyond streaks of shadow,\r\nwere counters sparkling and swarming with a throng, ablaze with\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nAnd at this last moment, in this over-heated atmosphere, the women\r\nreigned supreme. They had taken the whole place by storm, they were\r\ncamping there as in a conquered country, like an invading horde\r\ninstalled amidst all the disorder of the goods. The salesmen, deafened\r\nand exhausted, were now nothing but their slaves, of whom they disposed\r\nwith sovereign tyranny. Fat women elbowed their way along; even the\r\nthinnest took up a deal of space, and became quite arrogant. They were\r\nall there, with heads erect and gestures abrupt, quite at home, not\r\nshowing the slightest politeness to one another but making as much\r\nuse of the house as they could, even to the point of carrying away\r\nthe dust from its walls. Madame Bourdelais, desirous of making up for\r\nher expenditure had again taken her children to the refreshment bar:\r\nwhither the crowd was now rushing with rageful thirst and appetite.\r\nEven the mothers were gorging themselves with Malaga; since the morning\r\neighty quarts of syrup and seventy bottles of wine had been drunk.\r\nAfter purchasing her travelling cloak, Madame Desforges had secured\r\nsome picture cards at the pay-desk; and she went away scheming how\r\nshe might get Denise into her house, so as to humiliate her before\r\nMouret himself, see their faces and arrive at a conclusion. And whilst\r\nMonsieur de Boves succeeded at last in plunging into the crowd and\r\ndisappearing with Madame Guibal, Madame de Boves, followed by Blanche\r\nand Vallagnosc, had the fancy to ask for a red air-ball, although she\r\nhad bought nothing. It would always be something, she would not go\r\naway empty-handed, she would make a friend of her doorkeeper\'s little\r\ngirl with it. At the distributing counter they were just starting on\r\nthe fortieth thousand: thirty nine thousand red air-balls had already\r\ntaken flight in the warm atmosphere of the shop, a perfect cloud of red\r\nair-balls which were now floating from one end of Paris to the other,\r\nbearing upwards to the sky the name of The Ladies\' Paradise!\r\n\r\nFive o\'clock struck. Of all the ladies, Madame Marty and her daughter\r\nwere the only ones to remain, in the final throes of the day\'s sales.\r\nAlthough ready to drop with fatigue she could not tear herself away,\r\nbeing retained by so strong an attraction that although she needed\r\nnothing she continually retraced her steps, scouring the departments\r\nwith insatiable curiosity. It was the moment in which the throng,\r\ngoaded on by puffery, completely lost its head; the sixty thousand\r\nfrancs paid to the newspapers, the ten thousand bills posted on the\r\nwalls, the two hundred thousand catalogues distributed all over the\r\nworld, after emptying the women\'s purses, left their minds weakened by\r\nintoxication; and they still remained shaken by Mouret\'s inventions,\r\nthe reduction of prices, the "returns," and the endless gallantries.\r\nMadame Marty lingered before the various "proposal" stalls, amidst\r\nthe hoarse cries of the salesmen, the clink of the pay-desks, and the\r\nrolling of the parcels sent down to the basement; she again traversed\r\nthe ground floor, the linen, silk, glove and woollen departments; she\r\nagain went upstairs, yielding to the metallic vibrations of the hanging\r\nstaircases and flying-bridges; she returned to the mantle, under-linen,\r\nand lace departments; she even ascended to the second floor, to the\r\nheights of the bedding and furniture galleries; and on all sides the\r\nemployees, Hutin and Favier, Mignot and Li\xc3\xa9nard, Deloche, Pauline and\r\nDenise, nearly dead with fatigue, were making a final effort, snatching\r\nvictories from the last fever of the customers. This fever had\r\ngradually increased since the morning, like the intoxication emanating\r\nfrom all the tumbled stuffs. The crowd flared under the fiery glare of\r\nthe five o\'clock sun. Madame Marty now had the animated nervous face of\r\na child after drinking pure wine. Arriving with clear eyes and fresh\r\nskin from the cold of the street, she had slowly burnt both sight and\r\ncomplexion, by the contemplation of all that luxury, those violent\r\ncolours, whose everlasting gallop irritated her passion. When she at\r\nlast went away, after saying that she would pay at home, terrified as\r\nshe was by the amount of her bill, her features were drawn, and her\r\neyes dilated like those of a sick person. She was obliged to fight her\r\nway through the stubborn crush at the door, where people were almost\r\nkilling each other, amidst the struggle for bargains. Then, when she\r\ngot into the street, and again found her daughter, whom she had lost\r\nfor a moment, the fresh air made her shiver, and she remained quite\r\nscared, her mind unhinged by the neurosis to which the great drapery\r\nestablishments give birth.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as Denise was returning from dinner, a messenger called\r\nher: "You are wanted at the director\'s office, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\nShe had forgotten the order which Mouret had given her in the morning,\r\nto go to his office when the sale was over. She found him standing,\r\nwaiting for her. On going in she did not close the door, which remained\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\n"We are very pleased with you, mademoiselle," said he, "and we have\r\nthought of proving our satisfaction. You know in what a shameful manner\r\nMadame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric has left us. From to-morrow you will take her place as\r\nsecond-hand."\r\n\r\nDenise listened to him motionless with surprise. Then she murmured in\r\na trembling voice: "But there are saleswomen in the department who are\r\nmuch my seniors, sir."\r\n\r\n"What does that matter?" he resumed. "You are the most capable, the\r\nmost trustworthy. I select you; it\'s quite natural. Are you not\r\nsatisfied?"\r\n\r\nShe blushed, feeling a delicious happiness and embarrassment, in which\r\nall her original fright vanished. Why had she, before aught else,\r\nthought of the suppositions with which this unhoped-for favour would be\r\nreceived? And she remained there full of confusion, despite her sudden\r\nburst of gratitude. With a smile he looked at her in her simple silk\r\ndress, without a single piece of jewellery, displaying only the luxury\r\nof her royal, blonde hair. She had become more refined, her skin was\r\nwhiter, her manner delicate and grave. Her former puny insignificance\r\nwas developing into a penetrating, gentle charm.\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, sir," she stammered. "I don\'t know how to tell\r\nyou----"\r\n\r\nBut she was cut short by the appearance of Lhomme on the threshold. In\r\nhis hand he held a large leather bag, and with his mutilated arm he\r\npressed an enormous note case to his chest; whilst, behind him came his\r\nson Albert weighed down by the load of bags he was carrying.\r\n\r\n"Five hundred and eighty-seven thousand two hundred and ten francs\r\nthirty centimes!" exclaimed the cashier, whose flabby, worn face seemed\r\nto light up with a ray of sunshine, in the reflection of such a huge\r\nsum of money.\r\n\r\nIt was the day\'s receipts, the highest that The Ladies\' Paradise had\r\never attained. In the distance, in the depths of the shop through which\r\nLhomme had just slowly passed with the heavy gait of an overladen beast\r\nof burden, you could hear the uproar, the ripple of surprise and joy\r\nwhich this colossal sum had left behind it as it passed.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s superb!" said Mouret, enchanted. "My good Lhomme, put it\r\ndown there, and take a rest, for you look quite done up. I\'ll have the\r\nmoney taken to the central cashier\'s office. Yes, yes, put it all on my\r\ntable, I want to see the heap."\r\n\r\nHe was full of a childish gaiety. The cashier and his son rid\r\nthemselves of their burdens. The leather bag gave out a clear, golden\r\nring, two of the other bags in bursting let a torrent of silver and\r\ncopper escape, whilst from the note-case peeped the corners of bank\r\nnotes. One end of the large table was entirely covered; it was like the\r\ntumbling of a fortune picked up in ten hours.\r\n\r\nWhen Lhomme and Albert had retired, mopping their faces, Mouret\r\nremained for a moment motionless, dreamy, his eyes fixed on the money.\r\nBut on raising his head, he perceived Denise, who had drawn back. Then\r\nhe began to smile again, forced her to come forward, and finished by\r\nsaying that he would make her a present of all the money she could\r\ntake in her hand; and there was a sort of love bargain beneath his\r\nplayfulness.\r\n\r\n"Look! out of the bag. I bet it would be less than a thousand francs,\r\nyour hand is so small!"\r\n\r\nBut she drew back again. He loved her, then? Suddenly she understood\r\neverything; she felt the growing flame of desire with which he had\r\nenveloped her ever since her return to the shop. What overcame her more\r\nthan anything else was to feel her heart beating violently. Why did he\r\nwound her with the offer of all that money, when she was overflowing\r\nwith gratitude? He was stepping nearer to her still, continuing to\r\njoke, when, to his great annoyance, Bourdoncle came in under the\r\npretence of informing him of the enormous number of entries--no fewer\r\nthan seventy thousand customers had entered The Ladies\' Paradise that\r\nday. And thereupon Denise hastened off, after again expressing her\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday in August, the stock-taking, which had to be\r\nfinished by the evening, took place. Early in the morning all the\r\nemployees were at their posts, as on a week-day, and the work began\r\nwith closed doors, not a customer was admitted.\r\n\r\nDenise, however, had not come down with the other young ladies at eight\r\no\'clock. Confined to her room since the previous Thursday through\r\nhaving sprained her ankle whilst on her way up to the work-rooms, she\r\nwas now much better; but, as Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie treated her indulgently,\r\nshe did not hurry down. Still after a deal of trouble she managed to\r\nput her boots on, having resolved that she would show herself in the\r\ndepartment. The young ladies\' bed-rooms now occupied the entire fifth\r\nstorey of the new buildings in the Rue Monsigny; there were sixty of\r\nthem, on either side of a corridor, and they were much more comfortable\r\nthan formerly, although still furnished simply with an iron bedstead,\r\nlarge wardrobe, and little mahogany toilet-table. The private life\r\nof the saleswomen was now becoming more refined and elegant; they\r\ndisplayed a taste for scented soap and fine linen, quite a natural\r\nascent towards middle-class ways as their positions improved, although\r\nhigh words and banging doors were still sometimes heard amidst the\r\nhotel-like gust that carried them away, morning and evening. Denise,\r\nbeing second-hand in her department, had one of the largest rooms with\r\ntwo attic windows looking into the street. Being now in much better\r\ncircumstances she indulged in sundry little luxuries, a red eider-down\r\nbed quilt, covered with guipure, a small carpet in front of her\r\nwardrobe, a couple of blue-glass vases containing a few fading roses on\r\nher toilet table.\r\n\r\nWhen she had succeeded in getting her boots on she tried to walk across\r\nthe room; but was obliged to lean against the furniture, being still\r\nrather lame. However that would soon come right again, she thought.\r\nAt the same time, she had been quite right in refusing an invitation\r\nto dine at uncle Baudu\'s that evening, and in asking her aunt to take\r\nP\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 out for a walk, for she had placed him with Madame Gras again.\r\nJean, who had been to see her on the previous day, was also to dine at\r\nhis uncle\'s. She was still slowly trying to walk, resolving, however,\r\nto go to bed early, in order to rest her ankle, when Madame Cabin, the\r\nhousekeeper, knocked and gave her a letter, with an air of mystery.\r\n\r\nThe door closed. Denise, astonished by the woman\'s discreet smile,\r\nopened the letter. And at once she dropped on a chair; for it was a\r\nletter from Mouret, in which he expressed himself delighted at her\r\nrecovery, and begged her to come down and dine with him that evening,\r\nsince she could not go out. The tone of this note, at once familiar and\r\npaternal, was in no way offensive; but it was impossible for her to\r\nmistake its meaning. And thus her white cheeks slowly coloured with a\r\nflush.\r\n\r\nWith the letter lying on her lap and her heart beating violently she\r\nremained with her eyes fixed on the blinding light which came in by\r\none of the windows. There was a confession which she had been obliged\r\nto make to herself in this very room, during her sleepless hours: if\r\nshe still trembled when he passed, she now knew that it was not from\r\nfear; and her former uneasiness, her old terror, could have been only\r\nthe frightened ignorance of love, the perturbation of passion springing\r\nup amidst her youthful wildness. She did not reason, she simply felt\r\nthat she had always loved him, from the hour when she had shuddered\r\nand stammered before him. She had loved him when she had feared him\r\nas a pitiless master; she had loved him when her distracted heart was\r\ndreaming of Hutin, unconsciously yielding to a desire for affection.\r\nYes, she had never loved any but this man, whose mere look terrified\r\nher. And all her past life came back to her, unfolding itself in the\r\nblinding light from the window: the hardships of her start, that sweet\r\nwalk under the dark foliage of the Tuileries Gardens, and, lastly, the\r\ndesires with which he had enveloped her ever since her return. The\r\nletter dropped on the floor and Denise was still gazing at the window,\r\ndazzled by the glare of the sun.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a knock and she hastened to pick up the missive and\r\nconceal it in her pocket. It was Pauline, who, having slipped away from\r\nher department under some pretext or other, had come up for a little\r\nchat.\r\n\r\n"How are you, my dear? We never meet now----"\r\n\r\nAs it was against the rules, however, to go up into the bed-rooms, and,\r\nabove all, for two of the saleswomen to be shut in together, Denise\r\ntook her friend to the end of the passage, to a saloon which Mouret\r\nhad gallantly fitted up for the young ladies, who could spend their\r\nevenings there, chatting or sewing, till eleven o\'clock. The apartment,\r\ndecorated in white and gold, with the vulgar nudity of an hotel room,\r\nwas furnished with a piano, a central table, and some arm-chairs and\r\nsofas protected by white covers. After spending a few evenings together\r\nthere in the first novelty of the thing, the saleswomen now never\r\nentered the place without coming to high words at once. They required\r\neducating to it; so far their little circle lacked harmony. Meanwhile,\r\nalmost the only girl that went there in the evening was the second-hand\r\nof the corset department, Miss Powell, who strummed away at Chopin on\r\nthe piano, and whose envied talents were for much in driving the others\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"You see my ankle\'s better now," said Denise, "I was just going down."\r\n\r\n"Well!" exclaimed the other, "how zealous you are! I\'d take it easy if\r\nI had the chance!"\r\n\r\nThey had both sat down on a sofa. Pauline\'s manner had changed since\r\nher friend had become second-hand in the mantle department. With her\r\ngood-natured cordiality there mingled a touch of respect, a sort of\r\nsurprise at realizing that the puny little saleswoman of former days\r\nwas on the road to fortune. Denise, however, liked her very much, and\r\namidst the continual gallop of the two hundred women that the firm now\r\nemployed, confided in her alone.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Pauline, quickly, when she remarked her\r\ncompanion\'s troubled looks.\r\n\r\n"Oh! nothing," replied Denise, with an awkward smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; there\'s something the matter with you. Have you no faith in\r\nme, that you have given up telling me your worries?"\r\n\r\nThereupon Denise, in the emotion that was swelling her bosom--an\r\nemotion she could not control--abandoned herself to her feelings. She\r\ngave her friend the letter, stammering: "Look! he has just written to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nBetween themselves, they had never openly spoken of Mouret. But this\r\nvery silence was like a confession of their secret thoughts. Pauline\r\nknew everything. After having read the letter, she clasped Denise in\r\nher arms, and softly murmured: "My dear, to speak frankly, I thought\r\nit had all happened long ago. Don\'t be shocked; I assure you the whole\r\nshop must think as I do. You see, he appointed you as second-hand so\r\nquickly, and then he\'s always looking at you. It\'s obvious!" She kissed\r\nher affectionately on the cheek and then asked her: "You will go this\r\nevening, of course?"\r\n\r\nDenise looked at her without replying and all at once burst into tears,\r\nletting her head fall on Pauline\'s shoulder. The latter was quite\r\nastonished. "Come, try and calm yourself; there\'s nothing to upset you\r\nlike this," she said.\r\n\r\n"No, no; let me be," stammered Denise. "If you only knew what trouble I\r\nam in! Since I received that letter, I have felt beside myself. Let me\r\nhave a good cry, that will relieve me."\r\n\r\nFull of pity, though not understanding, Pauline endeavoured to console\r\nher, declaring that she must not worry, for it was quite certain that\r\nM. Mouret had ceased to pay any attention to Clara; whilst as for that\r\nother lady friend of his, Madame Desforges, it was probably all but so\r\nmuch gossip. Denise listened, and had she been ignorant of her love,\r\nshe could no longer have doubted it after the suffering she felt at the\r\nallusions to those two women. She could again hear Clara\'s disagreeable\r\nvoice, and see Madame Desforges dragging her about the different\r\ndepartments with all the scorn of a rich lady for a poor shop-girl.\r\n\r\nThen the two friends went on conversing; and at last Denise in a sudden\r\nimpulse exclaimed: "But when a man loves a girl he ought to marry her.\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9 is going to marry you."\r\n\r\nThis was true, Baug\xc3\xa9, who had left the Bon March\xc3\xa9 for The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, was going to marry her about the middle of the month.\r\nBourdoncle did not like these married couples; however, they had\r\nmanaged to get the necessary permission, and even hoped to obtain a\r\nfortnight\'s holiday for their honeymoon.\r\n\r\nOn hearing Denise\'s remark Pauline laughed heartily. "But, my dear,"\r\nsaid she. "Baug\xc3\xa9 is going to marry me because he is Baug\xc3\xa9. He\'s my\r\nequal, that\'s natural. Whereas Monsieur Mouret! Do you think that\r\nMonsieur Mouret could marry one of his saleswomen?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, oh! no," exclaimed Denise, shocked by the absurdity of the\r\nquestion, "and that\'s why he ought never to have written to me."\r\n\r\nThis argument seemed to astonish Pauline. Her coarse face, with small\r\ntender eyes, assumed quite an expression of maternal pity. Then she\r\ngot up, opened the piano, and with one finger softly played the air of\r\n"King Dagobert," doubtless to enliven the situation. The noises of the\r\nstreet, the distant melop\xc5\x93ia of a woman crying out green peas, ascended\r\nto the bare saloon, whose emptiness seemed increased by the white\r\ncoverings of the furniture. Denise had thrown herself back on the sofa,\r\nher head against the woodwork and shaken by a fresh flood of sobs,\r\nwhich she stifled in her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Again!" resumed Pauline, turning round. "Really you are not\r\nreasonable. Why did you bring me here? We ought to have stopped in your\r\nroom."\r\n\r\nShe knelt down before her, and had begun lecturing her again, when a\r\nsound of footsteps was heard in the passage. And thereupon she ran to\r\nthe door and looked out.\r\n\r\n"Hush! Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie!" she murmured. "I\'m off, and just you dry your\r\neyes. She need not know what\'s up."\r\n\r\nWhen Denise was alone, she rose, and forced back her tears; and, her\r\nhands still trembling, fearful of being caught there weeping, she\r\nclosed the piano, which her friend had left open. However, on hearing\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie knocking at her door, she at once left the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"What! you are up!" exclaimed the first-hand. "It\'s very thoughtless of\r\nyou, my dear child. I just came up to see how you were, and to tell you\r\nthat we did not require you downstairs."\r\n\r\nDenise assured her, however, that she felt much better and that it\r\nwould do her good to have some occupation.\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t tire myself, madame. You can put me on a chair, and I\'ll do\r\nsome writing."\r\n\r\nBoth then went downstairs. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, most attentive, insisted on\r\nDenise leaning on her shoulder. She must have noticed the young girl\'s\r\nred eyes, for she was stealthily examining her. No doubt she was aware\r\nof much that was going on.\r\n\r\nDenise had gained an unexpected victory: she had at last conquered the\r\ndepartment. Formerly she had struggled on for six months, amidst all\r\nthe torments of drudgery, without disarming her comrades\' ill-will, but\r\nnow in a few weeks she had overcome them, and saw them submissive and\r\nrespectful around her. Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s sudden affection had greatly\r\nassisted her in this ungrateful task of propitiating her companions.\r\nIndeed the first-hand had taken the young girl under her protection\r\nwith such warmth that the latter must have been recommended to her\r\nin a very special manner. However, Denise had also brought her own\r\ncharm into play in order to disarm her enemies. The task was all the\r\nmore difficult from the fact that she had to obtain their forgiveness\r\nfor her appointment to the situation of second-hand. The other young\r\nladies spoke of this at first as an injustice, and even added a lot\r\nof abominable accusations. But in spite of their revolt, the title of\r\nsecond-hand influenced them, and Denise with her promotion assumed\r\na certain air of authority which astonished and overawed even the\r\nmost hostile spirits. Soon afterwards she actually found flatterers\r\namongst the new hands; and her sweetness and modesty completed the\r\nconquest. Marguerite came over to her side; and Clara was the only\r\none to continue her ill-natured ways, still venturing to allude to\r\nDenise as the "unkempt one," an insult in which nobody now saw any fun.\r\nDuring the short time that she had engaged Mouret\'s attention Clara had\r\nprofited by the caprice to neglect her work, being of a wonderfully\r\nidle, gossiping nature unfitted for any responsible duty. Nevertheless\r\nshe considered that Denise had robbed her of Madame Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric\'s place.\r\nShe would never have accepted it, on account of the worry; but she was\r\nvexed that no attention had been paid to her claims.\r\n\r\nNine o\'clock struck as Denise came down, leaning on Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s\r\narm. Out of doors an ardent blue sky was warming the streets, cabs\r\nwere rolling towards the railway stations, the whole population of\r\nParis rigged out in Sunday attire was streaming towards the suburban\r\nwoods. Inside the Paradise, which the large open bays flooded with\r\nsunshine, the imprisoned staff had just commenced stock-taking. They\r\nhad closed the doors and people halted on the pavement, looking through\r\nthe windows in astonishment that the shop should be shut when such\r\nextraordinary activity prevailed inside. From one end of the galleries\r\nto the other, from the top to the bottom floor, there was a continual\r\ntramping of employees; arms were ever being raised and parcels were\r\nflying about above their heads; and all this amidst a tempest of shouts\r\nand calling out of figures, ascending in confusion and becoming a\r\ndeafening roar. Each of the thirty-nine departments did its work apart,\r\nwithout troubling about its neighbour. At this early hour the shelves\r\nhad hardly been touched, there were only a few bales of goods on the\r\nfloors. They must get up a good deal more steam if they were to finish\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\n"Why have you come down?" asked Marguerite of Denise, good-naturedly.\r\n"You\'ll only make yourself worse, and we are quite numerous enough to\r\ndo the work."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I told her," declared Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, "but she insisted on\r\ncoming down to help us."\r\n\r\nAll the young ladies flocked round Denise. The work was even\r\ninterrupted for a time. They complimented her, listening with all sorts\r\nof exclamations to the story of her sprained ankle. At last Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie made her sit down at a table; and it was understood that she\r\nshould merely write down the articles as they were called out. On such\r\na day as this they requisitioned all the employees who were capable\r\nof holding a pen: the inspectors, the cashiers, the clerks, even the\r\nshop messengers; and each department annexed some of these assistants\r\nof a day in order to get the work over more quickly. It was thus that\r\nDenise found herself installed near Lhomme the cashier and Joseph the\r\nmessenger, both of whom were bending over large sheets of paper.\r\n\r\n"Five mantles, cloth, fur trimming, third size, at two hundred and\r\nforty francs!" called Marguerite. "Four ditto, first size, at two\r\nhundred and twenty!"\r\n\r\nThe work once more commenced. Behind Marguerite three saleswomen were\r\nemptying the cupboards, classifying the articles, and giving them to\r\nher in bundles; and, when she had called them out, she threw them on\r\nthe table, where they were gradually accumulating in huge piles. Lhomme\r\njotted down the articles whilst Joseph checked him by keeping another\r\nlist. Whilst this was going on, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie herself, assisted by\r\nthree other saleswomen, was counting out the silk garments, which\r\nDenise entered on the sheets of paper given to her. Clara on her side\r\nwas looking after the heaps, arranging them in such a manner that they\r\nshould occupy the least possible space on the tables. But she was\r\nnot paying much attention to her work, for many things were already\r\ntumbling down.\r\n\r\n"I say," she asked of a little saleswoman who had joined that winter,\r\n"are they going to give you a rise? You know that the second-hand is to\r\nhave two thousand francs, which, with her commission, will bring her in\r\nnearly seven thousand."\r\n\r\nThe little saleswoman, without ceasing to pass some cloaks down,\r\nreplied that if they didn\'t give her eight hundred francs she would\r\ntake her hook. The rises were always given on the day after the\r\nstock-taking; it was also then, as the amount of business done during\r\nthe year became known, that the managers of the departments drew their\r\ncommission on the increase of this amount, as compared with that of the\r\npreceding year. Thus, despite the bustle and uproar of the work, the\r\nimpassioned gossiping went on everywhere. Between every two articles\r\nthat were called out, they talked of nothing but money. The rumour ran\r\nthat Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s gains would exceed twenty-five thousand francs;\r\nand this huge sum greatly excited the young ladies. Marguerite, the\r\nbest saleswoman after Denise, had for her part made four thousand five\r\nhundred francs, that is fifteen hundred francs salary and about three\r\nthousand francs commission; whilst Clara had not made two thousand five\r\nhundred altogether.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a button for their rises!" she resumed, still talking to\r\nthe little saleswoman. "If papa were dead I would jolly soon clear out\r\nof this! Still it exasperates me to see seven thousand francs given to\r\nthat strip of a girl! What do you say?"\r\n\r\nMadame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, turning round with her imperial air, violently\r\ninterrupted the conversation. "Be quiet, young ladies! We can\'t hear\r\nourselves speak, my word of honour!"\r\n\r\nThen she again went on calling out: "Seven mantles, old style,\r\nSicilian, first size, at a hundred and thirty! Three pelisses,\r\nsurah, second size, at a hundred and fifty! Have you got that down,\r\nMademoiselle Baudu?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, madame."\r\n\r\nClara then had to look after the armfuls of garments piled upon the\r\ntables. She pushed them about, and made some more room. But she soon\r\nleft them again to reply to a salesman, who was looking for her.\r\nIt was the glover, Mignot, who had escaped from his department. He\r\nwhispered a request for twenty francs; he already owed her thirty,\r\na loan effected on the day after some races when he had lost his\r\nweek\'s money on a horse; this time he had squandered his commission,\r\ndrawn overnight, and had not ten sous left him for his Sunday. Clara\r\nhad only ten francs about her, and she lent them with a fairly good\r\ngrace. And they then went on talking of a party of six, which they had\r\nformed part of, at a restaurant at Bougival, where the women had paid\r\ntheir shares. It was much better to do that, they all felt more at\r\nease. Next, Mignot, who wanted his twenty francs, went and bent over\r\nLhomme\'s shoulder. The latter, stopped in his writing, appeared greatly\r\ntroubled. However, he dared not refuse, and was looking for a ten-franc\r\npiece in his purse, when Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, astonished at not hearing the\r\nvoice of Marguerite who had been obliged to pause, perceived Mignot,\r\nand understood everything. She roughly sent him back to his department,\r\nsaying that she didn\'t want any one to come and distract her young\r\nladies\' attention from their work. The truth was, she dreaded this\r\nyoung man, a bosom friend of Albert\'s, and his accomplice in all sorts\r\nof questionable pranks which she feared would some day turn out badly.\r\nAccordingly, when Mignot had got his ten francs, and run away, she\r\ncould not help saying to her husband: "Is it possible! to let a fellow\r\nlike that get over you!"\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, I really couldn\'t refuse the young man."\r\n\r\nShe closed his mouth with a shrug of her substantial shoulders. Then,\r\nas the saleswomen were slyly grinning at this family explanation, she\r\nresumed severely: "Now, Mademoiselle Vadon, don\'t let us go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"Twenty cloaks, cashmere extra, fourth size, at eighteen francs and a\r\nhalf," resumed Marguerite in her sing-song voice.\r\n\r\nLhomme, with his head bowed down, again began writing. They had\r\ngradually raised his salary to nine thousand francs a year; but he was\r\nvery humble before Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, who still brought nearly three times\r\nas much into the family.\r\n\r\nFor a while the work was pushed forward. Figures were bandied\r\nabout, garments rained thick and fast on the tables. But Clara had\r\ninvented another amusement: she was teasing the messenger, Joseph,\r\nabout a passion which he was said to nourish for a young lady in the\r\npattern-room. This young lady, already twenty-eight years old, and\r\nthin and pale, was a _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e_ of Madame Desforges, who had wanted\r\nMouret to engage her as a saleswoman, backing up her recommendation\r\nwith a touching story: An orphan, the last of the Fontenailles, an\r\nold and noble family of Poitou, had been thrown on to the streets\r\nof Paris with a drunken father; still she had remained virtuous\r\namidst this misfortune which was the greater as her education\r\nwas altogether too limited to enable her to secure employment as\r\ngoverness or music-mistress. Mouret generally got angry when any one\r\nrecommended these broken-down gentlewomen to him; there were no more\r\nincapable, more insupportable, more narrow-minded creatures than\r\nthese gentlewomen, said he; and, besides, a saleswoman could not be\r\nimprovised, she must serve an apprenticeship, it was an intricate and\r\ndelicate business. However, he took Madame Desforges\'s _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e_\r\nplacing her in the pattern-room, in the same way as (to oblige friends)\r\nhe had already found places for two countesses and a baroness in the\r\nadvertising department, where they addressed wrappers and envelopes.\r\nMademoiselle de Fontenailles earned three francs a day, which just\r\nenabled her to live in her modest room, in the Rue d\'Argenteuil. It was\r\non seeing her with her sad look and shabby attire, that Joseph\'s heart,\r\nvery tender despite his rough soldierly manner, had been touched. He\r\ndid not confess, but blushed, when the young ladies of the mantle\r\ndepartment chaffed him; for the pattern-room was not far off, and they\r\nhad often observed him prowling about the doorway.\r\n\r\n"Joseph is somewhat absent-minded," murmured Clara. "His nose is always\r\nturning towards the under-linen department."\r\n\r\nThey had requisitioned Mademoiselle de Fontenailles there, and she\r\nwas assisting at the trousseau counter. As the messenger continually\r\nglanced in that direction, the saleswomen began to laugh; whereupon he\r\nbecame very confused, and plunged into his accounts, whilst Marguerite,\r\nin order to arrest the burst of gaiety which was tickling her throat,\r\ncried out louder still: "Fourteen jackets, English cloth, second size,\r\nat fifteen francs!"\r\n\r\nAt this, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, who was calling out some cloaks, could not\r\nmake herself heard. She interfered with a wounded air, and a majestic\r\nslowness of manner. "A little softer, mademoiselle. We are not in\r\na market. And you are all of you very unreasonable, to be amusing\r\nyourselves with such childish matters, when our time is so precious."\r\n\r\nJust at that moment, as Clara was not paying any attention to the\r\npackages, a catastrophe took place. Several mantles tumbled down, and\r\nall the heaps on the tables, carried with them, toppled over one after\r\nthe other, so that the carpet was quite strewn with them.\r\n\r\n"There! what did I say!" cried the first-hand, beside herself. "Pray be\r\nmore careful, Mademoiselle Prunaire; it\'s altogether intolerable."\r\n\r\nBut a hum ran along: Mouret and Bourdoncle, making their round of\r\ninspection, had just appeared. The voices began calling again and\r\nthe pens sputtered, whilst Clara hastened to pick up the garments.\r\nThe governor did not interrupt the work. He stood there for several\r\nminutes, mute and smiling, with the gay victorious face of stock-taking\r\ndays; and it was only on his lips that a slight feverish quiver\r\ncould be detected. When he perceived Denise, he nearly gave way to a\r\ngesture of astonishment. She had come down, then? His eyes met Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie\'s. Then, after a moment\'s hesitation, he went away into the\r\nunder-linen department.\r\n\r\nHowever, Denise, warned by the slight noise, had raised her head.\r\nAnd, having recognised Mouret, she had immediately bent over her work\r\nagain. Since she had been writing in this mechanical way, amidst the\r\ncalling-out of the goods, a peaceful feeling had stolen over her. She\r\nhad always yielded thus to the first outburst of her sensitiveness:\r\ntears suffocated her, and passion increased her torments: but then\r\nshe regained her self-command, a grand, calm courage, a quiet but\r\ninexorable strength of will. And now, with her limpid eyes, and pale\r\ncomplexion, she was free from all agitation, entirely absorbed in her\r\nwork, resolved to silence her heart and to do nothing but her will.\r\n\r\nTen o\'clock struck, the uproar of the stock-taking was increasing; and\r\namidst the incessant shouts which rose and flew about on all sides the\r\nsame news circulated with surprising rapidity: every salesman knew\r\nthat Mouret had written that morning inviting Denise to dinner. The\r\nindiscretion came from Pauline. On going downstairs, still greatly\r\nexcited, she had met Deloche in the lace department, and, without\r\nnoticing that Li\xc3\xa9nard was talking to the young man, had immediately\r\nrelieved her mind of the secret. "It\'s all over, my dear fellow. She\'s\r\njust received a letter. He has invited her to dinner for this evening."\r\n\r\nDeloche turned very pale. He had understood, for he often questioned\r\nPauline; each day they spoke of their common friend, and Mouret\'s\r\npassion for her. Moreover, she frequently scolded him for his secret\r\nlove for Denise, with whom he would never succeed, and shrugged her\r\nshoulders when he expressed his approval of the girl\'s conduct with\r\nreference to their employer.\r\n\r\n"Her foot\'s better, she\'s coming down," continued Pauline. "Pray don\'t\r\nput on that funeral face. There\'s no reason to cry." And thereupon she\r\nhastened back to her department.\r\n\r\n"Ah! good!" murmured Li\xc3\xa9nard, who had heard everything, "you\'re talking\r\nabout the young girl with the sprain. You were quite right to make\r\nhaste in defending her last night at the caf\xc3\xa9!"\r\n\r\nThen he also ran off; but before he had returned to the woollen\r\ndepartment, he had already related the story to four or five fellows.\r\nIn less than ten minutes, it had gone the round of the whole shop.\r\n\r\nLi\xc3\xa9nard\'s last remark to Deloche referred to a scene which had occurred\r\non the previous evening, at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Saint-Roch. Deloche and he were\r\nnow constantly together. The former had taken Hutin\'s room at the H\xc3\xb4tel\r\nde Smyrne, when that gentleman, on being appointed second-hand, had\r\nhired a suite of three rooms; and the two salesmen came to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise together in the morning, and waited for each other in the\r\nevening in order to go away together. Their rooms, which adjoined one\r\nanother, overlooked a black yard, a narrow well, the stench from which\r\npervaded the hotel. They got on very well together, notwithstanding\r\ntheir difference of character, the one carelessly squandering the money\r\nwhich he drew from his father, and the other penniless, perpetually\r\ntormented by ideas of thrift; both having, however, one point in\r\ncommon, their unskilfulness as salesmen, which kept them vegetating at\r\ntheir counters, without any increase of salary. After leaving the shop,\r\nthey spent the greater part of their time at the Caf\xc3\xa9 Saint-Roch. Void\r\nof customers during the day, this caf\xc3\xa9 filled at about half-past eight\r\nwith an overflowing crowd of employees, the stream of shopmen which\r\nrolled into the street from the great doorway in the Place Gaillon.\r\nThen a deafening uproar of dominoes, laughter and yelping voices burst\r\nforth amidst dense tobacco smoke. Beer and coffee were in great demand.\r\nSeated in the left-hand corner, Li\xc3\xa9nard would order the most expensive\r\nbeverages, whilst Deloche contented himself with a glass of beer, which\r\nhe would take four hours to drink. It was here that the latter had\r\nheard Favier relating, at a neighbouring table, some abominable things\r\nabout the way in which Denise had "hooked" the governor. He had with\r\ndifficulty restrained himself from striking him. However, as the other\r\nwent on adding still viler and viler stories of the girl, he had at\r\nlast called him a liar, feeling mad with rage.\r\n\r\n"What a blackguard!" he had shouted. "It\'s a lie, it\'s a lie, I tell\r\nyou!" And in the emotion agitating him, he had added a confession,\r\nentirely opening his heart in a stammering voice. "I know her, and it\r\nisn\'t true. She has never had any affection except for one man; yes,\r\nfor Monsieur Hutin, and even he has never noticed it!"\r\n\r\nThe report of this quarrel, exaggerated and distorted, was already\r\naffording amusement to the whole shop when the story of Mouret\'s letter\r\nran round. In fact, it was to a salesman in the silk department that\r\nLi\xc3\xa9nard first confided the news. With the silk-vendors the stock-taking\r\nwas going on rapidly. Favier and two shopmen, mounted on stools, were\r\nemptying the shelves and passing the pieces of stuff to Hutin who,\r\nstanding on a table, called out the figures, after consulting the\r\ntickets; and he then dropped the pieces on to the floor over which\r\nthey spread, rising slowly like an autumn tide. Other employees were\r\nwriting, Albert Lhomme being among the helpers, his face pale and heavy\r\nafter a night spent in a low show at La Chapelle. A sheet of light\r\nfell from the glazed roof of the hall, through which could be seen the\r\nintense blue of the sky.\r\n\r\n"Draw those blinds!" cried out Bouthemont who was very busy\r\nsuperintending the work. "That sun is unbearable!"\r\n\r\nFavier, on tiptoe, trying to reach a piece of silk, then grumbled under\r\nhis breath: "A nice thing to shut people up on a lovely day like this!\r\nNo fear of it raining on stock-taking day! And they keep us under lock\r\nand key, like convicts, when all Paris is out of doors!"\r\n\r\nHe passed the silk to Hutin. On the ticket was the measurement,\r\ndiminished at each sale by the quantity sold; which greatly simplified\r\nthe work. The second-hand cried out: "Fancy silk, small check,\r\ntwenty-one yards, at six francs and a half."\r\n\r\nAnd then the piece went to increase the heap already on the floor.\r\nWhilst waiting for another he resumed a conversation previously begun,\r\nby saying to Favier: "So he wanted to fight you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was quietly drinking my glass of beer. It was hardly worth his\r\nwhile to contradict me, for she has just received a letter from the\r\ngovernor inviting her to dinner. The whole shop is talking about it."\r\n\r\n"What! hadn\'t she dined with him before!"\r\n\r\nFavier handed him another piece of silk.\r\n\r\n"No, it seems not; though my opinion was all the other way."\r\n\r\nThe whole department was now joking about the affair, without, however,\r\nallowing the work to suffer. The young girl\'s name passed from mouth\r\nto mouth and the salesmen arched their backs and winked. Bouthemont\r\nhimself, who took a rare delight in all such stories, could not help\r\nadding his joke. Just then, however, Mignot came down, with the twenty\r\nfrancs which he had just borrowed, and he stopped to slip ten francs\r\ninto Albert\'s hand, making an appointment with him for the evening:\r\na projected spree, hampered by lack of money, but still possible,\r\nnotwithstanding the smallness of the sum secured. However, when Mignot\r\nheard about the famous letter, he made such an abominable remark, that\r\nBouthemont was obliged to interfere. "That\'s enough, gentlemen. It\r\nisn\'t any of our business. Go on, Monsieur Hutin."\r\n\r\n"Fancy silk, small check, thirty-two yards, at six francs and a half,"\r\ncried out the latter.\r\n\r\nThe pens started off again, the pieces fell; the flood of material\r\nstill increased, as if the water of a river had emptied itself there.\r\nAnd there was no end to the calling out of the fancy silks. Favier,\r\nin an undertone thereupon remarked that the stock in hand would form\r\na nice total; the governors would be enchanted; that big fool of a\r\nBouthemont might be the best buyer in Paris, but as a salesman he was\r\nnot worth his salt. Hutin smiled, delighted, and giving the other\r\na friendly look of approval; for after having himself introduced\r\nBouthemont to The Ladies\' Paradise, in order to get rid of Robineau, he\r\nwas now undermining him also, with the firm intention of depriving him\r\nof his berth. It was the same war as formerly--treacherous insinuations\r\nwhispered in the partners\' ears, excessive zeal to push one\'s self\r\nforward, a regular campaign carried on with affable cunning. Hutin was\r\nagain displaying some condescension towards Favier, but the latter,\r\nthin and frigid with a bilious look, gave him a sly glance as if to\r\ncount how many mouthfuls this short, little fellow would make, and\r\nto imply that he was waiting till he had swallowed up Bouthemont, in\r\norder to eat him afterwards. He, Favier, hoped to get the second-hand\'s\r\nplace, should his friend be appointed manager. And after that they\r\nwould see. Consumed by the fever which was raging from one to the other\r\nend of the shop, both of them began talking of the probable increases\r\nof salary, without however ceasing to call out the stock of fancy\r\nsilks; they felt sure that Bouthemont would secure thirty thousand\r\nfrancs that year; Hutin for his part would exceed ten thousand whilst\r\nFavier estimated his pay and commission at five thousand five hundred.\r\nThe amount of business in the department was increasing yearly, the\r\nsalesmen secured promotion and increase of pay, like officers in time\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t those fancy silks soon be finished?" asked Bouthemont suddenly,\r\nwith an expression of annoyance. "But it was a miserable spring, always\r\nraining! People bought nothing but black silks."\r\n\r\nHis fat, jovial face became cloudy as he gazed at the growing heap\r\non the floor, whilst Hutin called out louder still, in a sonorous\r\nvoice tinged with an accent of triumph--"Fancy silks, small check,\r\ntwenty-eight yards, at six francs and a half."\r\n\r\nThere was still another shelf-full. Favier whose arms were getting\r\ntired, was now progressing but slowly. As he handed Hutin the last\r\npieces he resumed in a low tone--"Oh! I say, I forgot. Have you heard\r\nthat the second-hand in the mantle department once had a regular fancy\r\nfor you?"\r\n\r\nHutin seemed greatly surprised. "What! How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that great booby Deloche let it out to us. But I remember her\r\ncasting sheep\'s eyes at you some time back."\r\n\r\nSince his appointment as second-hand Hutin had thrown up his music-hall\r\nsingers. Flattered at heart by Favier\'s words he nevertheless replied\r\nwith a scornful air, "I don\'t care for such scraggy creatures." And\r\nthen he called out:\r\n\r\n"White Poult, thirty-five yards, at eight francs seventy-five."\r\n\r\n"Oh! at last!" murmured Bouthemont, greatly relieved.\r\n\r\nBut a bell rang, that for the second table, to which Favier belonged.\r\nHe jumped off the stool where another salesman took his place, and\r\nhe was obliged to climb over the mountain of materials with which\r\nthe floor was littered. Similar heaps were scattered about in every\r\ndepartment; the shelves, the boxes, the cupboards were being gradually\r\nemptied, whilst the goods overflowed on all sides, under-foot, between\r\nthe counters and the tables, in ever rising piles. In the linen\r\ndepartment you heard heavy bales of calico falling; in the mercery\r\ndepartment there was a clicking of boxes; whilst distant rumbling\r\nsounds came from amongst the furniture. Every sort of voice was heard\r\ntoo, shrill, full, deep, and husky, figures whizzed through the air and\r\na rustling clamour reigned in the immense nave--the clamour of forests\r\nin January when the wind whistles through the branches.\r\n\r\nFavier at last got clear and went up the dining-room staircase. Since\r\nthe enlargement of The Ladies\' Paradise the refectories had been\r\nshifted to the fourth storey of the new buildings. As he hurried up he\r\novertook Deloche and Li\xc3\xa9nard who had gone on before him, so he fell\r\nback on Mignot who was following at his heels.\r\n\r\n"The deuce!" said he, in the corridor leading to the kitchen, on\r\nreaching the black-board on which the bill of fare was inscribed, "you\r\ncan see it\'s stock-taking day. A regular feast! Chicken, or leg of\r\nmutton, and artichokes! Their mutton won\'t be much of a success!"\r\n\r\nMignot sniggered, murmuring, "Is there a poultry epidemic on, then?"\r\n\r\nHowever, Deloche and Li\xc3\xa9nard had taken their portions and gone away.\r\nFavier thereupon leant over the wicket and called out--"Chicken!"\r\n\r\nBut he had to wait; one of the kitchen helps had cut his finger in\r\ncarving, and this caused some confusion. Favier stood there with\r\nhis face to the opening, gazing into the kitchen with its giant\r\nappliances. There was a central range, over which, by a system of\r\nchains and pullies, a couple of rails fixed to the ceiling brought\r\ncolossal cauldrons which four men could not have lifted. Several\r\ncooks, quite white in the ruddy glow of the cast-iron, were attending\r\nto the evening soup mounted on metal ladders and armed with skimmers\r\nfixed to long handles. Then against the wall were grills large enough\r\nfor the roasting of martyrs, saucepans big enough for the stewing of\r\nentire sheep, a monumental plate-warmer, and a marble basin filled by\r\na continual stream of water. To the left could be seen a scullery with\r\nstone sinks as large as ponds; whilst on the other side, to the right,\r\nwas a huge meat-safe, where a glimpse was caught of numerous joints of\r\nred meat hanging from steel hooks. A machine for peeling potatoes was\r\nworking with the tic-tac of a mill; and two small trucks laden with\r\nfreshly-picked salad were being wheeled by some kitchen helps into a\r\ncool spot under a gigantic filter.\r\n\r\n"Chicken," repeated Favier, getting impatient. Then, turning round, he\r\nadded in a lower tone, "One fellow has cut himself. It\'s disgusting,\r\nhis blood\'s running over the food."\r\n\r\nMignot wanted to see. Quite a string of shopmen had now arrived; there\r\nwas a deal of laughing and pushing. The two young men, their heads at\r\nthe wicket, exchanged remarks about this phalansterian kitchen, in\r\nwhich the least important utensils, even the spits and larding pins,\r\nassumed gigantic proportions. Two thousand luncheons and two thousand\r\ndinners had to be served, and the number of employees was increasing\r\nevery week. It was quite an abyss, into which something like forty-five\r\nbushels of potatoes, one hundred and twenty pounds of butter, and\r\nsixteen hundred pounds of meat were cast every day; and at each meal\r\nthey had to broach three casks of wine, over a hundred and fifty\r\ngallons being served out at the wine counter.\r\n\r\n"Ah! at last!" murmured Favier when the cook reappeared with a large\r\npan, out of which he handed him the leg of a fowl.\r\n\r\n"Chicken," said Mignot behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd with their plates in their hands they both entered the refectory,\r\nafter taking their wine at the "bar;" whilst behind them the word\r\n"Chicken" was repeated without cessation, and one could hear the cook\r\npicking up the portions with his fork with a rapid rhythmical sound.\r\n\r\nThe men\'s dining-room was now an immense apartment, supplying ample\r\nroom for five hundred people at each repast. The places were laid at\r\nlong mahogany tables, placed parallel across the room, and at either\r\nend were similar tables reserved for the managers of departments and\r\nthe inspectors; whilst in the centre was a counter for the "extras."\r\nRight and left large windows admitted a white light to the gallery,\r\nwhose ceiling, although over twelve feet from the floor, seemed very\r\nlow, owing to the development of the other proportions. The sole\r\nornaments on the walls, painted a light yellow, were the napkin\r\ncupboards. Beyond this first refectory came that of the messengers and\r\ncarmen, where the meals were served irregularly, according to the needs\r\nof the moment.\r\n\r\n"What! you\'ve got a leg as well, Mignot?" said Favier, as he took his\r\nplace at one of the tables opposite his companion.\r\n\r\nOther young men now sat down around them. There was no tablecloth, the\r\nplates clattered on the bare mahogany, and in this particular corner\r\neverybody was raising exclamations, for the number of legs distributed\r\nwas really prodigious.\r\n\r\n"These chickens are all legs!" remarked Mignot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'re real centipedes," retorted another salesman.\r\n\r\nThose who had merely secured pieces of carcase were greatly\r\ndiscontented. However, the food had been of much better quality since\r\nthe late improvements. Mouret no longer treated with a contractor at\r\na fixed rate; he had taken the kitchen into his own hands, organizing\r\nit like one of the departments, with a head-cook, under-cooks and an\r\ninspector; and if he spent more money he got on the other hand more\r\nwork out of the staff--a practical humanitarian calculation which had\r\nlong terrified Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\n"Mine is pretty tender, all the same," said Mignot. "Pass the bread!"\r\n\r\nThe big loaf was sent round, and after cutting a slice for himself\r\nhe dug the knife into the crust. A few dilatory ones now hurried in,\r\ntaking their places; a ferocious appetite, increased by the morning\'s\r\nwork, burst forth from one to the other end of the immense tables.\r\nThere was an increasing clatter of forks, a gurgling sound of bottles\r\nbeing emptied, a noise of glasses laid down too violently amidst the\r\ngrinding rumble of five hundred pairs of powerful jaws chewing with\r\nwondrous energy. And the talk, still infrequent, seemed to be hampered\r\nby the fullness of the mouths.\r\n\r\nDeloche, however, seated between Baug\xc3\xa9 and Li\xc3\xa9nard, found himself\r\nnearly opposite Favier. They had glanced at each other with a rancorous\r\nlook. Some neighbours, aware of their quarrel on the previous day,\r\nbegan whispering together. Then there was a laugh at poor Deloche\'s\r\nill-luck. Although always famished he invariably fell on the worst\r\npiece at table, by a sort of cruel fatality. This time he had come in\r\nfor the neck of a chicken and some bits of carcase. Without saying\r\na word, however, he let them joke away, swallowing large mouthfuls\r\nof bread, and picking the neck with the infinite art of a fellow who\r\nentertains great respect for meat.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you complain?" asked Baug\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nBut he shrugged his shoulders. What would be the use of that? It was\r\nalways the same. When he did venture to complain things went worse than\r\never.\r\n\r\n"You know the Bobbinards have got their club now?" said Mignot, all at\r\nonce. "Yes, my boy, the \'Bobbin Club.\' It\'s held at a wine shop in the\r\nRue Saint-Honor\xc3\xa9, where they hire a room on Saturdays."\r\n\r\nHe was speaking of the mercery salesmen. The whole table began to joke.\r\nBetween two mouthfuls, with his voice still thick, each made some\r\nremark, adding a detail; and only the obstinate readers remained mute,\r\nwith their noses buried in their newspapers. It could not be denied\r\nthat shopmen were gradually assuming a better style; nearly half of\r\nthem now spoke English or German. It was no longer considered good form\r\nto go and kick up a row at Bullier or prowl about the music-halls for\r\nthe pleasure of hissing ugly singers. No; a score of them got together\r\nand formed a club.\r\n\r\n"Have they a piano like the linen-men?" asked Li\xc3\xa9nard.\r\n\r\n"I should rather think they had!" exclaimed Mignot. "And they play, my\r\nboy, and sing! There\'s even one of them, little Bavoux, who recites\r\nverses."\r\n\r\nThe gaiety redoubled and they chaffed little Bavoux; nevertheless\r\nbeneath their laughter lay a great respect. Then they spoke of a piece\r\nat the Vaudeville, in which a counter-jumper played a nasty part,\r\nwhich annoyed several of them, whilst others began anxiously wondering\r\nat what time they would get away that evening, having invitations to\r\npass the evening at friends\' houses. And from all points came similar\r\nconversations amidst an increasing rattle of crockery. To drive\r\naway the odour of the food--the warm steam which rose from the five\r\nhundred plates--they had opened the windows, whose lowered blinds\r\nwere scorching in the heavy August sun. Burning gusts came in from\r\nthe street, golden reflections yellowed the ceiling, steeping the\r\nperspiring eaters in a reddish light.\r\n\r\n"A nice thing to shut people up on such a fine Sunday as this!"\r\nrepeated Favier.\r\n\r\nThis remark brought them back to the stock-taking. It had been\r\na splendid year. And they went on to speak of the salaries--the\r\nrises--the eternal subject, the stirring question which occupied\r\nthem all. It was always thus on chicken days; a wonderful excitement\r\ndeclared itself, the noise at last became unbearable. When the waiters\r\nbrought the artichokes you could not hear yourself speak. However, the\r\ninspector on duty had orders to be indulgent.\r\n\r\n"By the way," cried Favier, "you\'ve heard the news?"\r\n\r\nBut his voice was drowned by Mignot asking: "Who doesn\'t like\r\nartichoke; I\'ll sell my dessert for an artichoke."\r\n\r\nNo one replied. Everybody liked artichoke. That lunch would be counted\r\namongst the good ones, for peaches were to be given for dessert.\r\n\r\n"He has invited her to dinner, my dear fellow," said Favier to his\r\nright-hand neighbour, finishing his story. "What! you didn\'t know it?"\r\n\r\nThe whole table knew it, they were tired of talking about it since\r\nearly morning. And the same poor jokes passed from mouth to mouth.\r\nDeloche was quivering again, and his eyes at last rested on Favier,\r\nwho was persisting in his shameful remarks. But all at once the silk\r\nsalesman ducked his head, for Deloche, yielding to an irresistible\r\nimpulse, had thrown his last glass of wine into his face, stammering:\r\n"Take that, you infernal liar! I ought to have drenched you yesterday!"\r\n\r\nThis caused quite a scandal. A few drops had spurted on Favier\'s\r\nneighbours, whilst he himself only had his hair slightly wetted: the\r\nwine, thrown by an awkward hand, had fallen on the other side of the\r\ntable. However, the others got angry, asking Deloche if the girl was\r\nhis property that he defended her in this way? What a brute he was!\r\nhe deserved a good drubbing to teach him better manners. However,\r\ntheir voices fell, for an inspector was observed coming along, and it\r\nwas useless to let the management interfere in the quarrel. Favier\r\ncontented himself with saying: "If it had caught me, you would have\r\nseen some sport!"\r\n\r\nThen the affair wound up in jeers. When Deloche, still trembling,\r\nwished to drink by way of hiding his confusion, and mechanically caught\r\nhold of his empty glass, they all burst out laughing. He laid his glass\r\ndown again awkwardly enough and commenced sucking the leaves of the\r\nartichoke which he had already eaten.\r\n\r\n"Pass Deloche the water bottle," said Mignot, quietly; "he\'s thirsty."\r\n\r\nThe laughter increased. The young men took clean plates from the piles\r\nstanding at equal distances on the table whilst the waiters handed\r\nround the dessert, which consisted of peaches, in baskets. And they\r\nall held their sides when Mignot added, with a grin: "Each man to his\r\ntaste. Deloche takes wine with his peaches."\r\n\r\nDeloche, however, sat motionless, with his head hanging down, as if\r\ndeaf to the joking going on around him: he was full of despairing\r\nregret at thought of what he had just done. Those fellows were\r\nright--what right had he to defend her? They would now think all sorts\r\nof villainous things: he could have killed himself for having thus\r\ncompromised her, in attempting to prove her innocence. Such was always\r\nhis luck, he might just as well kill himself at once, for he could not\r\neven yield to the promptings of his heart without doing some stupid\r\nthing. And then tears came into his eyes. Was it not also his fault\r\nif the whole shop was talking of the letter written by the governor?\r\nHe heard them grinning and making abominable remarks about this\r\ninvitation, which Li\xc3\xa9nard alone had been informed of, and he reproached\r\nhimself, he ought never to have let Pauline speak before that fellow;\r\nhe was really responsible for the annoying indiscretion which had been\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n"Why did you go and relate that?" he murmured at last in a sorrowful\r\nvoice. "It\'s very wrong."\r\n\r\n"I?" replied Li\xc3\xa9nard; "but I only told it to one or two persons,\r\nenjoining secrecy. One never knows how these things get about!"\r\n\r\nWhen Deloche made up his mind to drink a glass of water everybody burst\r\nout laughing again. They had finished their meal and were lolling back\r\non their chairs waiting for the bell to recall them to work. They had\r\nnot asked for many extras at the great central counter, especially as\r\non stock-taking day the firm treated them to coffee. The cups were\r\nsteaming, perspiring faces shone under the light vapour, floating\r\nlike bluey clouds from cigarettes. At the windows the blinds hung\r\nmotionless, without the slightest flapping. One of them, on being drawn\r\nup, admitted a ray of sunshine which sped across the room and gilded\r\nthe ceiling. The uproar of the voices beat upon the walls with such\r\nforce that the bell was at first only heard by those at the tables\r\nnear the door. Then they got up and for some time the corridors were\r\nfull of the confusion of the departure. Deloche, however, remained\r\nbehind to escape the malicious remarks that were still being made.\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9 even went out before him, and Baug\xc3\xa9 was, as a rule, the last to\r\nleave, taking a circuitous route so as to meet Pauline on he way to the\r\nladies\' dining-room; a man\xc5\x93uvre they had arranged between them--the\r\nonly chance they had of seeing one another for a minute during business\r\nhours. That day, however, just as they were indulging in a loving kiss\r\nin a corner of the passage they were surprised by Denise, who was also\r\ngoing up to lunch. She was walking slowly on account of her foot.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my dear," stammered Pauline, very red, "don\'t say anything, will\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9, with his big limbs and giant stature, was trembling like a\r\nlittle boy. He muttered, "They\'d precious soon pitch us out. Although\r\nour marriage may be announced, they don\'t allow any kissing, the\r\nbrutes!"\r\n\r\nDenise, greatly agitated, affected not to have seen them: and Baug\xc3\xa9\r\ndisappeared just as Deloche, also going the longest way round, in his\r\nturn appeared. He wished to apologize, stammering out phrases that\r\nDenise did not at first catch. Then, as he blamed Pauline for having\r\nspoken before Li\xc3\xa9nard, and she stood there looking very embarrassed,\r\nDenise at last understood the meaning of the whispers she had heard\r\naround her all the morning. It was the story of the letter circulating.\r\nAnd again was she shaken by the shiver with which this letter had\r\nagitated her.\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t know," repeated Pauline. "Besides, there\'s nothing bad in\r\nthe letter. Let them gossip; they\'re jealous, of course!"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Denise at last, with her sensible air, "I don\'t blame\r\nyou in any way! You\'ve spoken nothing but the truth. I _have_ received\r\na letter, and it is my duty to answer it."\r\n\r\nDeloche went off heart-broken, in the belief that the girl accepted the\r\nsituation and would keep the appointment that evening. When the two\r\nsaleswomen had lunched in a small room, adjoining the larger one where\r\nthe women were served much more comfortably, Pauline had to assist\r\nDenise downstairs again as her sprain was getting more painful.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon warmth below, the stock-taking was roaring more loudly\r\nthan ever. The moment for the supreme effort had arrived, when, as the\r\nwork had not made much progress during the morning, everybody put forth\r\ntheir strength in order that all might be finished that night. The\r\nvoices grew louder still, you saw nothing but waving arms continually\r\nemptying the shelves and throwing the goods down; and it was impossible\r\nto get along for the tide of the bales and packages on the floor rose\r\nas high as the counters. A sea of heads, brandished fists, and flying\r\nlimbs seemed to extend to the very depths of the departments, with\r\nthe confused aspect of a distant riot. It was the last fever of the\r\nclearing, the machine seemed ready to burst; and past the plate-glass\r\nwindows all round the closed shop there still went a few pedestrians,\r\npale with the stifling boredom of a summer Sunday. On the pavement\r\nin the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin three tall girls, bareheaded and\r\nsluttish-looking, were impudently pressing their faces against the\r\nwindows, trying to see the curious work going on inside.\r\n\r\nWhen Denise returned to the mantle department Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie told\r\nMarguerite to finish calling out the garments. There was still the\r\nchecking to be done, and for this, being desirous of silence, she\r\nretired into the pattern-room, taking Denise with her.\r\n\r\n"Come with me, we\'ll do the checking;" she said, "and then you can add\r\nup the figures."\r\n\r\nHowever, as she wished to leave the door open, in order to keep an\r\neye on her young ladies, the noise came in, and they could not hear\r\nthemselves much better even in this pattern-room--a large, square\r\napartment furnished merely with some chairs and three long tables. In\r\none corner were the great machine knives, for cutting up the patterns.\r\nEntire pieces of stuff were consumed; every year they sent away more\r\nthan sixty thousand francs\' worth of material, cut up in strips. From\r\nmorning to night, the knives were cutting silk, wool, and linen, with\r\na scythe-like noise. Then, too, the books had to be got together,\r\ngummed or sewn. And between the two windows, there was also a little\r\nprinting-press for the tickets.\r\n\r\n"Not so loud, please!" cried Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie every now and again, quite\r\nunable as she was to hear Denise reading out the articles.\r\n\r\nThen, the checking of the first lists being completed, she left the\r\nyoung girl at one of the tables, absorbed in the adding-up; but came\r\nback almost immediately, and placed Mademoiselle de Fontenailles\r\nnear her. The under-linen department not requiring Madame Desforges\'\r\n_prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e_ any longer, had placed her at her disposal. She could also\r\ndo some adding-up, it would save time. But the appearance of the\r\nmarchioness, as Clara ill-naturedly called the poor creature, had\r\ndisturbed the department. They laughed and joked at poor Joseph, and\r\ntheir ferocious sallies were wafted into the pattern-room.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t draw back, you are not at all in my way," said Denise, seized\r\nwith pity. "My inkstand will suffice, we\'ll dip together."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Fontenailles, brutified by her unfortunate position,\r\ncould not even find a word of gratitude. She looked like a woman who\r\ndrank, her meagre face had a livid hue, and her hands alone, white and\r\ndelicate, attested the distinction of her birth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the laughter all at once ceased, and the work resumed its\r\nregular roar. Mouret was once more going through the departments. But\r\nhe stopped and looked round for Denise, surprised at not seeing her\r\nthere. Then he made a sign to Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie; and both drew aside, and\r\nfor a moment talked in a low tone. He must have been questioning her.\r\nShe nodded towards the pattern-room and then seemed to be making a\r\nreport. No doubt she was relating that the young girl had been weeping\r\nthat morning.\r\n\r\n"Very good!" said Mouret, aloud, coming nearer. "Show me the lists."\r\n\r\n"This way, sir," said the first-hand. "We have run away from the noise."\r\n\r\nHe followed her into the next room. Clara was not duped by this\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre, but Marguerite threw her the garments at a quicker rate,\r\nin order to take up her attention and close her mouth. Wasn\'t the\r\nsecond-hand a good comrade? Her affairs did not concern them. The\r\nwhole department was now aiding and abetting the intrigue, the young\r\nladies grew more agitated than ever, Lhomme and Joseph affected not\r\nto see or hear anything. And inspector Jouve, who, in passing by, had\r\nremarked Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\'s tactics, began walking up and down before the\r\npattern-room door, with the regular step of a sentry guarding the will\r\nand pleasure of a superior.\r\n\r\n"Give Monsieur Mouret the lists," said the first-hand.\r\n\r\nDenise handed them over, and sat there with her eyes raised. She had\r\nstarted slightly, but had promptly conquered herself, and retained a\r\nfine calm look, although her cheeks were pale. For a moment, Mouret\r\nappeared to be absorbed in the lists of articles, never giving the girl\r\na glance. A silence reigned, then Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie all at once stepped up\r\nto Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, who had not even turned her head, and,\r\napparently dissatisfied with her counting, said to her in an undertone:\r\n\r\n"Go and help with the parcels. You are not used to figures."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Fontenailles got up, and returned to the department,\r\nwhere she was greeted with whispering. Joseph, under the laughing eyes\r\nof these young minxes, was writing anyhow. Clara though delighted to\r\nhave an assistant nevertheless treated her very roughly, hating her as\r\nshe hated all the women in the shop. What an idiotic thing to yield to\r\nthe love of a workman, when you were a marchioness! And yet she envied\r\nthe poor creature this love.\r\n\r\n"Very good!" repeated Mouret, still pretending to read.\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie hardly knew how to get away in her turn in a\r\ndecent fashion. She turned about, went to look at the machine knives,\r\nfurious with her husband for not inventing a pretext for calling her.\r\nBut then he was never of any use in serious matters, he would have died\r\nof thirst close to a pond. It was Marguerite who proved intelligent\r\nenough to go and ask the first-hand a question.\r\n\r\n"I\'m coming," replied the latter.\r\n\r\nAnd her dignity now being saved, having a pretext to join the young\r\nladies who were watching her, she at last left Denise and Mouret alone\r\ntogether, coming out of the pattern-room with a majestic step and so\r\nnoble an air, that the saleswomen did not even dare to smile.\r\n\r\nMouret had slowly laid the lists on the table, and stood looking at\r\nDenise, who had remained seated, pen in hand. She did not avert her\r\ngaze, but she had merely turned paler.\r\n\r\n"You will come this evening?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I cannot. My brothers are to be at my uncle\'s to-night, and I\r\nhave promised to dine with them."\r\n\r\n"But your foot! You walk with such difficulty."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can get so far very well. I feel much better since the morning."\r\n\r\nIn his turn he had turned pale on hearing this quiet refusal. A nervous\r\nrevolt made his lips quiver. However, he restrained himself, and with\r\nthe air of a good-natured master simply interesting himself in one of\r\nhis young ladies resumed: "Come now, if I begged of you--You know what\r\ngreat esteem I have for you."\r\n\r\nDenise retained her respectful attitude. "I am deeply touched, sir, by\r\nyour kindness to me, and thank you for this invitation. But I repeat, I\r\ncannot; my brothers expect me this evening."\r\n\r\nShe persisted in not understanding. The door remained open, and she\r\nfelt that the whole shop was urging her on to ruin. Pauline had\r\namicably called her a great simpleton; the others would laugh at her\r\nif she refused the invitation; Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, who had gone away,\r\nMarguerite, whose rising voice she could hear, Lhomme, whom she could\r\nespy, sitting motionless and discreet, all these people were wishing\r\nfor her fall. And the distant roar of the stock-taking, the millions of\r\ngoods enumerated on all sides and thrown about in every direction, were\r\nlike a warm breeze wafting the breath of passion towards her. There\r\nwas a silence. Now and again, Mouret\'s voice was drowned by the noisy\r\naccompaniment, the formidable uproar of a kingly fortune gained in\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n"When will you come, then?" he asked again. "To-morrow?"\r\n\r\nThis simple question troubled Denise. She lost her calmness for a\r\nmoment, and stammered: "I don\'t know--I can\'t----"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and tried to take her hand, which she withheld. "What are\r\nyou afraid of?" he asked.\r\n\r\nBut she quickly raised her head, looked him straight in the face, and\r\nsmiling, with her sweet, brave look replied: "I am afraid of nothing,\r\nsir. I can do as I like, can I not? I don\'t wish to, that\'s all!"\r\n\r\nAs she finished speaking, she was surprised to hear a creaking noise,\r\nand on turning round saw the door slowly closing. It was inspector\r\nJouve, who had taken upon himself to pull it to. The doors were a part\r\nof his duty, none ought ever to remain open. And he gravely resumed his\r\nposition as sentinel. No one appeared to have noticed that this door\r\nwas being closed in such a simple manner. Clara alone risked a strong\r\nremark in the ear of Mademoiselle de Fontenailles, but the latter\'s\r\nface remained expressionless.\r\n\r\nDenise, however, had risen. Mouret was saying to her in a low and\r\ntrembling voice: "Listen, Denise, I love you. You have long known it,\r\npray don\'t be so cruel as to play the ignorant. I love you, Denise!"\r\nShe was standing there very pale, listening to him and still looking\r\nstraight into his face. "Tell me," he went on. "Why do you refuse? Have\r\nyou no wants? Your brothers are a heavy burden. Anything you might ask\r\nof me, anything you might require of me----"\r\n\r\nBut with a word, she stopped him: "Thanks, I now earn more than I need."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s perfect liberty that I am offering you, an existence of\r\npleasure and luxury. I will set you up in a home of your own. I will\r\nassure you a little fortune."\r\n\r\n"No, thanks; I should soon get tired of doing nothing. I earned my own\r\nliving before I was ten years old."\r\n\r\nHe made a wild gesture. This was the first one who did not yield. With\r\nthe others he had merely had to stoop. His passion, long restrained,\r\ngoaded on by resistance, became stronger than ever, and he pressed her\r\nmore and more urgently.\r\n\r\nBut without faltering she each time replied "No--no."\r\n\r\nThen at last he let this heart-cry escape him: "But don\'t you see that\r\nI am suffering! Yes, it\'s stupid, but I am suffering like a child!"\r\n\r\nTears came into his eyes. A fresh silence reigned. They could still\r\nhear the softened roar of the stock-taking behind the closed door. It\r\nwas like a dying note of triumph, the accompaniment subsided into a\r\nlower key in presence of this defeat of the master.\r\n\r\n"And yet if I liked----" he said in an ardent voice, seizing her hands.\r\n\r\nShe left them in his, her eyes turned pale, her whole strength was\r\ndeserting her. A warmth came from this man\'s burning grasp, filling her\r\nwith a delicious cowardice. Good heavens! how she loved him, and with\r\nwhat delight she could have hung on his neck and remained there!\r\n\r\nBut in his passionate excitement he grew brutal. She set up a low\r\ncry; the pain she felt at her wrists restored her courage. With an\r\nangry shake she freed herself. Then, very stiff, looking taller in her\r\nweakness: "No, leave me alone! I am not a Clara, to be thrown over in a\r\nday. Besides, you love another; yes, that lady who comes here. I do not\r\naccept half an affection!"\r\n\r\nHe remained motionless with surprise. What was she saying, and what did\r\nshe want? The other girls had never asked to be loved. He ought to have\r\nlaughed at such an idea; yet this attitude of tender pride completely\r\nconquered his heart.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, please open the door," she resumed. "It is not proper that\r\nwe should be shut up together in this way."\r\n\r\nHe obeyed; and with his temples throbbing, hardly knowing how to\r\nconceal his anguish, he recalled Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, and broke out\r\nangrily about the stock of cloaks, saying that the prices must be\r\nlowered, until every one had been got rid of. Such was the rule of\r\nthe house--a clean sweep was made every year, they sold at sixty per\r\ncent. loss rather than keep an old pattern or any stale material.\r\nAt that moment, Bourdoncle, seeking Mouret, was waiting for him\r\noutside, having been stopped before the closed door by Jouve, who had\r\nwhispered a word in his ear with a grave air. He got very impatient,\r\nwithout however, summoning up sufficient courage to interrupt the\r\ngovernor\'s _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_. Was it possible? on such a day too, and with\r\nthat creature! And when Mouret at last came out Bourdoncle spoke to\r\nhim about the fancy silks, of which the stock left on hand would be\r\nsomething enormous This was a relief for Mouret, as it gave him an\r\nopportunity for shouting. What the devil was Bouthemont thinking about?\r\nHe went off declaring that he could not allow a buyer to display such\r\nlack of sense as to buy beyond the requirements of the business.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with him?" murmured Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, quite overcome\r\nby his reproaches; while the young ladies looked at each other in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nAt six o\'clock the stock-taking was finished. The sun was still\r\nshining--a fair summer sun, whose golden reflections streamed through\r\nthe glazed roofs of the halls. In the heavy air of the streets, tired\r\nfamilies were already returning from the suburbs laden with bouquets\r\nand dragging their children along. One by one, the departments had\r\nbecome silent. In the depths of the galleries you now only heard the\r\nlingering calls of a few men clearing a last shelf. Then even these\r\nvoices ceased, and of all the bustle of the day there only remained a\r\nquivering vibration, above the formidable piles of goods. The shelves,\r\ncupboards, boxes, and band-boxes, were now empty: not a yard of\r\nstuff, not an object of any sort had remained in its place. The vast\r\nestablishment displayed but the carcase of its usual appearance, the\r\nwoodwork was absolutely bare, as on the day of taking possession. This\r\nbareness was the visible proof of the complete, exact taking of the\r\nstock. And on the floor was sixteen million francs\' worth of goods, a\r\nrising sea, which had finished by submerging the tables and counters.\r\nHowever, the shopmen, surrounded to the shoulders, began to put each\r\narticle back into its place. They expected to finish by about ten\r\no\'clock.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie, who went to the first dinner, came back from the\r\ndining-room, she announced the amount of business done during the year,\r\nwhich the totals of the various departments had just enabled one to\r\narrive at. The figure was eighty million francs, ten millions more than\r\nthe previous year. The only real decrease had been on the fancy silks.\r\n\r\n"If Monsieur Mouret is not satisfied, I should like to know what more\r\nhe wants," added the first-hand. "See! he\'s fuming over there, at the\r\ntop of the grand staircase."\r\n\r\nThe young ladies went to look at him. He was standing alone, with a\r\nsombre countenance, above the millions scattered at his feet.\r\n\r\n"Madame," said Denise, at this moment, "would you kindly let me go away\r\nnow? I can\'t do anything more on account of my foot, and as I am to\r\ndine at my uncle\'s with my brothers----"\r\n\r\nThey were all astonished. She had not yielded, then! Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie\r\nhesitated, and speaking in a sharp and disagreeable voice, seemed\r\ninclined to forbid her going out; whilst Clara shrugged her shoulders,\r\nfull of incredulity. When Pauline learnt the news, she was in the\r\nbaby-linen department with Deloche, and the sudden joy exhibited by the\r\nyoung man made her very angry. As for Bourdoncle, who did not dare to\r\napproach Mouret in his savage isolation, he marched up and down amidst\r\nthese rumours, in despair also, and full of anxiety. However, Denise\r\nwent down. As she slowly reached the bottom of the left-hand staircase,\r\nleaning on the banister, she came upon a group of grinning salesmen.\r\nHer name was pronounced, and she realized that they were talking about\r\nher adventure. They had not noticed her descent.\r\n\r\n"Oh! all that\'s put on, you know," Favier was saying. "She\'s full of\r\nvice! Yes, I know some one whom she set her eyes on."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he glanced at Hutin, who, in order to preserve his\r\ndignity as second-hand, was standing a short distance away without\r\njoining in their conversation. However, he was so flattered by the\r\nenvious air with which the others contemplated him, that he deigned to\r\nmurmur: "She was a regular nuisance to me, was that girl!"\r\n\r\nDenise, wounded to the heart, clung to the banister. They must have\r\nseen her, for they all disappeared, laughing. He was right, she\r\nthought, and she reproached herself for her former ignorance, when\r\nshe had been wont to think of him. But what a coward he was, and how\r\nshe scorned him now! A great trouble had come upon her; was it not\r\nstrange that she should have found the strength just now to repulse\r\na man whom she adored, when she had felt herself so feeble in bygone\r\ndays before that worthless fellow, whom she had only dreamed of? Her\r\nsense of reason and her bravery foundered in these contradictions of\r\nher being, which she could not clearly read. Then she hastened to cross\r\nthe hall but a sort of instinct prompted her to raise her head, whilst\r\nan inspector was opening the door, closed since the morning. And still\r\nat the top of the stairs, on the great central landing dominating the\r\ngallery, she perceived Mouret. He had quite forgotten the stock-taking,\r\nhe no longer beheld his empire, that building bursting with riches.\r\nEverything had disappeared, his former uproarious victories, his future\r\ncolossal fortune. With a desponding look he was watching Denise and\r\nwhen she had crossed the threshold everything disappeared, a darkness\r\ncame over the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day, Bouthemont was the first to arrive at Madame Desforges\'s four\r\no\'clock tea. Waiting alone in her large Louis XVI. drawing-room, the\r\nbrasses and brocatel of which shone with a clear gaiety, she rose with\r\nan air of impatience, saying, "Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well," replied the young man, "when I told him that I should no doubt\r\ncall on you he formally promised me to come."\r\n\r\n"You made him thoroughly understand that I expected the baron to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. That\'s what appeared to decide him."\r\n\r\nThey were speaking of Mouret, who, the year before, had suddenly\r\ntaken such a liking to Bouthemont that he had admitted him to share\r\nhis pleasures; and had even introduced him to Henriette, glad to have\r\nan agreeable fellow always at hand to enliven an acquaintanceship of\r\nwhich he was getting tired. It was thus that Bouthemont had ultimately\r\nbecome the confidant of his employer and the handsome widow; he did\r\ntheir little errands, talked of the one to the other, and sometimes\r\nreconciled them. Henriette, in her jealous fits, displayed a\r\nfamiliarity which sometimes surprised and embarrassed him, for she was\r\nlosing the prudence of a woman of the world who employed all her art to\r\nsave appearances.\r\n\r\n"You ought to have brought him," she exclaimed violently. "I should\r\nhave been sure then."\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, with a good-natured laugh, "it isn\'t my fault if he\r\nescapes so frequently now. Oh! he\'s very fond of me, all the same. Were\r\nit not for him I should be in a bad way at the shop."\r\n\r\nHis situation at The Ladies\' Paradise had really been menaced since\r\nthe last stock-taking. It was in vain that he talked of the rainy\r\nseason, they could not overlook the considerable stock of fancy silks\r\nleft on hand; and as Hutin was improving the occasion--undermining him\r\nwith the governors with an increase of sly ferocity--he could feel the\r\nground giving way beneath him. Mouret had condemned him, weary already,\r\nno doubt, of this witness who prevented him from breaking off with\r\nHenriette and tired of an acquaintanceship which yielded no profit.\r\nBut, in accordance with his usual tactics, he was pushing Bourdoncle\r\nforward: it was Bourdoncle and the other partners who insisted on\r\nBouthemont\'s dismissal at each board meeting; whilst he according to\r\nhis own account resisted then, defending his friend energetically, at\r\nthe risk even of getting into serious trouble with the others.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall wait," resumed Madame Desforges. "You know that the girl\r\nis to be here at five o\'clock. I want to see them face to face. I must\r\ndiscover their secret."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she reverted to her long-meditated plan, mentioning in\r\nher agitation that she had requested Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie to send her Denise\r\nto look at a mantle which fitted badly. When she should once have got\r\nthe young girl in her room, she would find some reason for calling\r\nMouret, and would then act. Bouthemont, who had sat down opposite to\r\nher, was gazing at her with his handsome laughing eyes, which he was\r\nendeavouring to keep serious. This jovial fellow, with coal-black\r\nbeard, this dissipated blade whose warm Gascon blood empurpled his\r\ncheeks, was thinking that fine ladies were not of much account after\r\nall, and let out a nice lot of things when they ventured to open their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n"Come," he made bold to say at last, "what can that matter to you since\r\nI assure you that there is nothing whatever between them?"\r\n\r\n"Just so!" she cried, "it\'s because he loves her! I don\'t care a fig\r\nfor the others, the chance acquaintances, the friends of a day!"\r\n\r\nShe spoke of Clara with disdain. She was well aware that Mouret, after\r\nDenise\'s rejection, had fallen back on that tall, red-haired girl, with\r\nthe horse\'s head: and he had done this doubtless by calculation; for he\r\nmaintained her in the department, loading her with presents. Moreover\r\nfor the last three months he had been leading a terribly dissipated\r\nlife, squandering his money in costly and stupid caprices, with a\r\nprodigality which caused many remarks.\r\n\r\n"It\'s that creature\'s fault," repeated Henriette. "I feel sure he\'s\r\nruining himself with others because she repulses him. Besides, what\'s\r\nhis money to me? I should have preferred him poor. You know how fond I\r\nam of him, you who have become our friend."\r\n\r\nShe stopped short, half choking, ready to burst into tears; and, in her\r\nemotion, she held out her hands to him. It was true, she adored Mouret\r\nfor his youth and his triumphs, never before had any man thus conquered\r\nher; but, at the thought of losing him, she also heard the knell of her\r\nfortieth year, and asked herself with terror how she should replace\r\nthis great affection.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have my revenge," she murmured, "I\'ll have my revenge, if he\r\nbehaves badly!"\r\n\r\nBouthemont continued to hold her hands in his. She was still handsome.\r\nBut hers would be a troublesome acquaintance to keep up and he did not\r\ncare for that style of woman. The matter, however, deserved thinking\r\nover; perhaps it would be worth his while to risk some annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you set up on your own account?" she asked all at once,\r\ndrawing her hands away.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was astonished. Then he replied: "But it would require\r\nan immense sum. Last year I had such an idea in my head. I feel\r\nconvinced that there are enough customers in Paris for one or two\r\nmore big shops; but the district would have to be well chosen. The\r\nBon March\xc3\xa9 holds the left side of the river; the Louvre occupies the\r\ncentre of the city; we monopolize, at The Paradise, the rich west-end\r\ndistrict. There remains the north, where one might start a rival\r\nestablishment to the Place Clichy. And I had discovered a splendid\r\nposition, near the Opera House----"\r\n\r\n"Well, why not?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe set up a noisy laugh. "Just fancy," he replied, "I was stupid enough\r\nto go and talk to my father about it. Yes, I was simple enough to ask\r\nhim to find me some shareholders at Toulouse."\r\n\r\nAnd he gaily described the anger of the old man who remained buried\r\nin his little country shop, full of rage against the great Parisian\r\nbazaars. Bursting at the thought of the thirty thousand francs a year\r\nwhich his son earned, he had replied that he would sooner give his\r\nmoney and that of his friends to the hospitals than contribute a copper\r\nto one of those great establishments which were the pests of trade.\r\n\r\n"Besides," the young man concluded, "it would require millions."\r\n\r\n"Suppose they were found?" observed Madame Desforges, quietly.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, becoming serious all at once. Was not this merely a\r\njealous woman\'s remark? However, she did not give him time to question\r\nher, but added: "In short, you know what a great interest I take in\r\nyou. We\'ll talk about it again."\r\n\r\nThe outer bell had just rung. She got up, and he, himself, drew back\r\nhis chair with an instinctive movement, as if some one might have\r\nsurprised them. Silence reigned in the drawing-room with its gay\r\nhangings, and decorated with such a profusion of green plants that\r\nthere was like a small wood between the two windows. Henriette stood\r\nwaiting, with her ear towards the door.\r\n\r\n"It is he," she murmured.\r\n\r\nThe footman announced Monsieur Mouret and Monsieur de Vallagnosc.\r\nHenriette could not restrain a movement of anger. Why had he not come\r\nalone? He must have gone for his friend, fearful of a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_\r\nwith her. However, she smiled and shook hands with both men.\r\n\r\n"What a stranger you are becoming! I say the same for you, Monsieur de\r\nVallagnosc."\r\n\r\nHer great grief was that she was getting stout, and she now squeezed\r\nherself into the tightest fitting black silk dresses, in order to\r\nconceal her increasing corpulency. Yet her pretty head, with its dark\r\nhair, preserved its pleasing shapeliness. And Mouret could familiarly\r\ntell her, as he enveloped her with a look: "It\'s useless to ask after\r\nyour health. You are as fresh as a rose."\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'m almost too well," she replied. "Besides, I might have died;\r\nyou would have known nothing about it."\r\n\r\nShe was examining him also, and thought that he looked tired and\r\nnervous, his eyes heavy, his complexion livid.\r\n\r\n"Well," she resumed, in a tone which she endeavoured to render\r\nagreeable, "I cannot return your compliment; you don\'t look at all well\r\nthis evening."\r\n\r\n"Overwork!" remarked Vallagnosc.\r\n\r\nMouret shrugged his shoulders, without replying. He had just caught\r\nsight of Bouthemont, and nodded to him in a friendly way. During their\r\ncloser intimacy he himself had been wont to take him away from the\r\ndepartment, and bring him to Henriette\'s during the busiest moments\r\nof the afternoon. But times had changed; and he now said to him in an\r\nundertone:\r\n\r\n"You went away very early. They noticed your departure, and are furious\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nHe referred to Bourdoncle and the other persons who had an interest in\r\nthe business, as if he were not himself the master.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" murmured Bouthemont, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I want to talk to you. Wait for me, we\'ll leave together."\r\n\r\nHenriette had now sat down again; and, while listening to Vallagnosc,\r\nwho was announcing that Madame de Boves would probably pay her a\r\nvisit, she did not take her eyes off Mouret. The latter, again silent,\r\ngazed at the furniture, and seemed to be looking for something on the\r\nceiling. Then, as she laughingly complained that she now only had\r\ngentlemen at her four o\'clock tea, he so far forgot himself as to blurt\r\nout:\r\n\r\n"I expected to find Baron Hartmann here."\r\n\r\nHenriette turned pale. No doubt she well knew that he merely came to\r\nher house to meet the baron; still he might have avoided throwing his\r\nindifference in her face like that. At that moment the door had opened\r\nand the footman was standing behind her. When she had interrogated him\r\nby a sign, the servant leant over and said in a very low tone:\r\n\r\n"It\'s for that mantle. Madame wished me to let her know. The young\r\nwoman is there."\r\n\r\nHenriette at once raised her voice, so as to be heard; and all her\r\njealous suffering found relief in these scornfully harsh words: "She\r\ncan wait!"\r\n\r\n"Shall I show her into madame\'s dressing-room?" asked the servant.\r\n\r\n"No, no. Let her stay in the ante-room!"\r\n\r\nAnd, when the servant had gone, she quietly resumed her conversation\r\nwith Vallagnosc. Mouret, who had relapsed into his former lassitude,\r\nhad listened in an absent-minded way, without understanding, while\r\nBouthemont, worried by the adventure, remained buried in thought.\r\nAlmost at that moment, however, the door was opened again, and two\r\nladies were shown in.\r\n\r\n"Just fancy," said Madame Marty, "I was alighting at the door, when I\r\nsaw Madame de Boves coming along under the arcade."\r\n\r\n"Yes," explained the latter, "it\'s a fine day, and my doctor says I\r\nmust take walking exercise."\r\n\r\nThen, after a general hand-shaking, she inquired of Henriette: "So\r\nyou\'re engaging a new maid?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied the other, astonished. "Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I\'ve just seen a young woman in the ante-room."\r\n\r\nHenriette interrupted her, laughing. "It\'s true; all those shop-girls\r\nlook like ladies\' maids, don\'t they? Yes, it\'s a young person come to\r\nalter a mantle."\r\n\r\nMouret gazed at her intently, a suspicion flashing across his mind. But\r\nshe went on with a forced gaiety, explaining that she had bought the\r\nmantle in question at The Ladies\' Paradise during the previous week.\r\n\r\n"What!" asked Madame Marty, "have you deserted Sauveur, then?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, but I wished to make an experiment. Besides, I was pretty\r\nwell satisfied with a first purchase I made--a travelling cloak. But\r\nthis time it has not succeeded at all. You may say what you like, one\r\nis horribly rigged out in the big shops. I speak out plainly, even\r\nbefore Monsieur Mouret. He will never know how to dress a woman who is\r\nin the least degree stylish."\r\n\r\nMouret did not defend his establishment, but still kept his eyes on\r\nher, consoling himself with the thought that she would never have dared\r\nto do what he had suspected. And it was Bouthemont who had to plead the\r\ncause of The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\n\r\n"If all the aristocratic ladies who patronize us were to proclaim\r\nit," he retorted gaily, "you would be astonished by the names of our\r\ncustomers. Order a garment to measure at our place, it will equal one\r\nfrom Sauveur\'s and cost you but half the money. But there, just because\r\nit\'s cheaper, it\'s not so good."\r\n\r\n"So it doesn\'t fit, the mantle you speak of?" resumed Madame de\r\nBoves. "Ah! now I remember the young person. It\'s rather dark in your\r\nante-room."\r\n\r\n"Yes," added Madame Marty, "I was wondering where I had seen that\r\nfigure before. Well! go, my dear, don\'t stand on ceremony with us."\r\n\r\nHenriette assumed a look of disdainful unconcern. "Oh, presently, there\r\nis no hurry."\r\n\r\nThen the ladies continued the discussion on the garments sold at the\r\nlarge establishments; and afterwards Madame de Boves spoke of her\r\nhusband, who, said she, had gone to inspect the stud-farm at Saint-L\xc3\xb4;\r\nwhile at the same time Henriette related that, owing to the illness of\r\nan aunt, Madame Guibal had been suddenly called into Franche-Comt\xc3\xa9.\r\nMoreover, she did not reckon that day on seeing Madame Bourdelais\r\neither, for at the end of every month the latter shut herself up\r\nwith a needlewoman to look over her young people\'s clothes. Madame\r\nMarty, meantime, seemed agitated by some secret trouble. Her husband\'s\r\nposition at the Lyc\xc3\xa9e Bonaparte was menaced, in consequence of the\r\nlessons which the poor man gave in certain private establishments where\r\na regular trade was carried on in B.A. diplomas; he now feverishly\r\nearned money wherever he could, in order to meet the rage for spending\r\nwhich was pillaging his household; and his wife, on seeing him weeping\r\none evening from fear of dismissal, had conceived the idea of asking\r\nher friend Henriette to speak to a director at the Ministry of Public\r\nInstruction with whom she was acquainted. Henriette finished by\r\nquieting her with a few words. Monsieur Marty, however, was coming\r\nhimself that afternoon to learn his fate and thank her.\r\n\r\n"You look unwell, Monsieur Mouret," all at once observed Madame de\r\nBoves.\r\n\r\n"Overwork!" repeated Vallagnosc, with ironic apathy.\r\n\r\nMouret quickly rose as if ashamed of forgetting himself in this\r\nfashion. He took his accustomed place in the midst of the ladies, and\r\nrecovered all his agreeable manners. He was now busy with the winter\r\nnovelties, and spoke of a considerable arrival of lace, whereupon\r\nMadame de Boves questioned him as to the price of Alen\xc3\xa7on point: she\r\nfelt inclined to buy some. She was, however, now obliged to be sparing\r\nof even thirty sous for a cab fare and would return home quite ill from\r\nthe effects of stopping before the displays in the shop windows. Draped\r\nin a mantle which was already two years old, she tried, in imagination,\r\non her queenly shoulders all the most expensive garments she saw;\r\nand it was as though they had been torn from off her when she awoke\r\nand found herself still wearing her patched-up dresses, without the\r\nslightest hope of ever satisfying her passion.\r\n\r\n"Baron Hartmann," now announced the footman.\r\n\r\nHenriette observed with what pleasure Mouret shook hands with the new\r\narrival. The latter bowed to the ladies, and glanced at the young man\r\nwith that subtle expression which sometimes illumined his big Alsatian\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Always plunged in dress!" he murmured, with a smile; and like a friend\r\nof the house, he ventured to add: "There\'s a charming young person in\r\nthe ante-room. Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! nobody," replied Madame Desforges, in her ill-natured voice. "Only\r\na shop-girl waiting to see me."\r\n\r\nThe door had remained half-open as the servant was bringing in the tea.\r\nHe went out, came in again, placed the china service on the table and\r\nthen brought some plates of sandwiches and biscuits. In the spacious\r\nroom, a bright light, softened by the green plants, illumined the\r\nbrass-work, and bathed the silk hangings in a tender glow; and each\r\ntime the door opened one could perceive a dim corner of the ante-room,\r\nwhich was only lighted by two ground-glass windows. There, in the\r\ngloom, appeared a sombre form, motionless and patient. Denise was\r\nstanding; there was indeed a leather-covered bench there, but a feeling\r\nof pride prevented her from sitting down on it. She felt the insult\r\nintended her. She had been there for the last half-hour, without a\r\nsign, without a word. The ladies and the baron had taken stock of her\r\nin passing; she could now just hear the voices from the drawing-room;\r\nall the pleasant luxury wounded her with its indifference; and still\r\nshe did not move. Suddenly, however, through the half-open doorway, she\r\nperceived Mouret; and he, on his side, had at last guessed it to be her.\r\n\r\n"Is it one of your saleswomen?" asked Baron Hartmann.\r\n\r\nMouret had succeeded in concealing his great distress of mind; still\r\nhis voice trembled somewhat with emotion: "No doubt; but I don\'t know\r\nwhich."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the little fair girl from the mantle department," replied Madame\r\nMarty, obligingly, "the second-hand, I believe."\r\n\r\nHenriette looked at Mouret in her turn.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said he, simply.\r\n\r\nAnd then he tried to change the conversation, speaking of the f\xc3\xaates\r\nthat were being given to the King of Prussia who had arrived in Paris\r\nthe day before. But the baron maliciously reverted to the young ladies\r\nin the big establishments. He pretended to be desirous of gaining\r\ninformation, and put several questions: Where did they come from\r\nin general? Was their conduct as bad as it was said to be? Quite a\r\ndiscussion ensued.\r\n\r\n"Really," he repeated, "you think them well-behaved?"\r\n\r\nMouret defended their conduct with a conviction which made Vallagnosc\r\nsmile. Bouthemont then interfered, to save his chief. Of course, there\r\nwere some of all sorts, bad and good, though they were all improving.\r\nFormerly they had secured nothing but the refuse of the trade; a poor,\r\ndoubtful class of girls who had drifted into the drapery business;\r\nwhereas now respectable families in the Rue de S\xc3\xa8vres positively\r\nbrought up their daughters for the Bon March\xc3\xa9. In short, when they\r\nliked to conduct themselves well, they could; for they were not, like\r\nthe work-girls of Paris, obliged to board and lodge themselves; they\r\nhad bed and board given them, their existence, though an extremely hard\r\none, no doubt, was at all events provided for. The worst was their\r\nneutral, ill-defined position, something between the shopwoman and\r\nthe lady. Thrown into the midst of luxury, often without any primary\r\ninstruction, they formed a nameless class apart from all others. Their\r\nmisfortunes and vices sprang from that.\r\n\r\n"For myself," said Madame de Boves, "I don\'t know any creatures who are\r\nmore disagreeable. Really, one could slap them at times."\r\n\r\nAnd then the ladies vented their spite. Quite a battle was waged at the\r\nshop-counters, where woman was pitted against woman in a sharp rivalry\r\nof wealth and beauty. There was the sullen jealousy of the saleswomen\r\ntowards the well-dressed customers, the ladies whose manners they tried\r\nto imitate, and there was a still stronger feeling on the part of the\r\npoorly-dressed customers, those of the lower middle-class, against the\r\nsaleswomen, those girls arrayed in silk, from whom they would have\r\nliked to exact a servant\'s humility even in the serving of a half franc\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of them," said Henriette, by way of conclusion, "they are\r\na wretched lot as worthless as the goods they sell!"\r\n\r\nMouret had the strength to smile. The baron was looking at him, so\r\ntouched by his graceful command over himself that he changed the\r\nconversation, returning to the f\xc3\xaates that were being given to the\r\nKing of Prussia: they would be superb, said he, the whole trade of\r\nParis would profit by them. Henriette meanwhile remained silent and\r\nthoughtful, divided between the desire to let Denise remain forgotten\r\nin the ante-room, and the fear that Mouret, now aware of her presence,\r\nmight go away. At last she rose from her chair.\r\n\r\n"You will allow me?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my dear!" replied Madame Marty. "I will do the honours of\r\nthe house for you."\r\n\r\nShe got up, took the teapot, and filled the cups. Henriette turned\r\ntowards Baron Hartmann, saying: "You will stay a few minutes, won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I want to speak to Monsieur Mouret. We are going to invade your\r\nlittle drawing-room."\r\n\r\nShe went out, and her black silk dress, in rustling against the door,\r\nmade a noise like that of a snake wriggling through brushwood. The\r\nbaron at once man\xc5\x93uvred to carry Mouret off, leaving the ladies to\r\nBouthemont and Vallagnosc. Then they stood talking before the window\r\nof the other room in a low tone. A fresh affair was in question.\r\nFor a long time past Mouret had cherished a desire to realize his\r\nformer project, the invasion of the whole block of building from\r\nthe Rue Monsigny to the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re and from the Rue\r\nNeuve-Saint-Augustin to the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, by The Ladies\'\r\nParadise. Of this enormous square there still remained a large plot\r\nof ground fronting the last named street, which he had not acquired;\r\nand this sufficed to spoil his triumph, he was tormented by a desire\r\nto complete his conquest, to erect there a sort of apotheosis, a\r\nmonumental fa\xc3\xa7ade. As long as his principal entrance should remain in\r\nthe Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, in a dark street of olden Paris, his work\r\nwould be incomplete, deficient in logic. He wished to set it up face to\r\nface with new Paris, in one of those modern avenues through which the\r\nbusy multitude of the end of the nineteenth century passed in the full\r\nglare of the sunlight. He could imagine it dominating, imposing itself\r\nas the giant palace of commerce, casting even a greater shadow over\r\nthe city than the old Louvre itself. But hitherto he had been baulked\r\nby the obstinacy of the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier, which still clung to its\r\nfirst idea of building a rival establishment to the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel on the\r\nsite in question. The plans were ready, they were only waiting for the\r\nclearing of the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre to begin digging the foundations.\r\nAt last, however, by a supreme effort, Mouret had almost convinced\r\nBaron Hartmann.\r\n\r\n"Well!" the latter began, "we had a board-meeting yesterday, and I came\r\nto-day, thinking I should meet you, and wishing to keep you informed.\r\nThey still resist."\r\n\r\nThe young man allowed a nervous gesture to escape him. "But it\'s\r\nridiculous. What do they say?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me! they say what I have said to you myself, and what I am still\r\ninclined to think. Your fa\xc3\xa7ade is only an ornament, the new buildings\r\nwould only increase the area of your establishment by about a tenth,\r\nand it would be throwing away immense sums on a mere advertisement."\r\n\r\nAt this, Mouret burst out. "An advertisement! an advertisement! In any\r\ncase this one would be in stone, and outlive all of us. Just consider\r\nthat it would increase our business tenfold! We should see our money\r\nback in two years. How can ground be lost if it returns you an enormous\r\ninterest! You will see what crowds we shall have when our customers are\r\nno longer obliged to struggle through the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin,\r\nbut can pass freely down a thoroughfare broad enough for six carriages\r\nabreast."\r\n\r\n"No doubt," replied the baron, laughing. "But you are a poet in your\r\nway, let me tell you once more. These gentlemen think it would be\r\ndangerous for you to extend your business further. They want to be\r\nprudent for you."\r\n\r\n"How! prudent? I no longer understand. Don\'t the figures show the\r\nconstant increase in our sales? At first, with a capital of five\r\nhundred thousand francs, I did business to the extent of two millions,\r\nturning over the capital four times every year. It then became four\r\nmillion francs, which, turned over ten times, produced business to the\r\nextent of forty millions. In short, after successive increases, I have\r\njust learnt, from the last stock-taking, that the business done now\r\namounts to a total of eighty millions; the capital, which has only been\r\nslightly increased--for it does not exceed six millions--has passed\r\nover our counters, in the form of goods sold, more than twelve times in\r\nthe year!"\r\n\r\nHe raised his voice and tapped the fingers of his right hand on the\r\npalm of his left, knocking down those millions as he might have cracked\r\nnuts. The baron interrupted him. "I know, I know. But you don\'t hope to\r\nkeep on increasing in this way, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Mouret, ingenuously. "There\'s no reason why it\r\nshould stop. The capital can be turned over as many as fifteen times,\r\nI predicted as much long ago. In certain departments it can even be\r\nturned over twenty-five or thirty times. And after? well! after, we\'ll\r\nfind a means of turning it over still more."\r\n\r\n"So you\'ll finish by swallowing up all the money in Paris, as you\'d\r\nswallow a glass of water?"\r\n\r\n"Most decidedly. Doesn\'t Paris belong to the women, and don\'t the women\r\nbelong to us?"\r\n\r\nThe baron laid his hands on Mouret\'s shoulders, looking at him with a\r\npaternal air. "Listen, you\'re a fine fellow, and I like you. There\'s\r\nno resisting you. We\'ll go into the matter seriously, and I hope to\r\nmake them listen to reason. So far, we are perfectly satisfied with\r\nyou. Your dividends astonish the Bourse. You must be right; it will\r\nbe better to put more money into your business, than to risk this\r\ncompetition with the Grand H\xc3\xb4tel, which is hazardous."\r\n\r\nMouret\'s excitement at once subsided and he thanked the baron, but\r\nwithout any of his usual enthusiasm; and the other saw him turn his\r\neyes towards the door of the next room, again a prey to the secret\r\nanxiety which he was concealing. Meanwhile Vallagnosc had come up, on\r\nseeing that they had finished talking business. He stood close to them,\r\nlistening to the baron, who, with the air of an old man who had seen\r\nlife, was muttering: "I say, I fancy they\'re taking their revenge."\r\n\r\n"Who?" asked Mouret in embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Why, the women. They\'re getting tired of belonging to you, and you now\r\nbelong to them, my dear fellow: it\'s only just!"\r\n\r\nThen he joked him, well aware as he was of the young man\'s notorious\r\nlove affairs. The enormous sums squandered by Mouret in costly and\r\nstupid caprices, amused him as an excuse for the follies which he had\r\nformerly committed himself. His old experience rejoiced to think that\r\nmen had in no wise changed.\r\n\r\n"Really, I don\'t understand you," repeated Mouret.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you understand well enough," answered the baron. "They always get\r\nthe last word. In fact, I thought to myself: It isn\'t possible, he\'s\r\nboasting, he can\'t be so strong as that! And now there you are! So\r\nthough you obtain all you can from woman and work her as you would a\r\ncoal mine, it\'s simply in order that she may work you afterwards, and\r\nforce you to refund! And take care, for she\'ll draw more money from you\r\nthan you have ever drawn from her."\r\n\r\nHe laughed louder still, and Vallagnosc standing by also began to grin,\r\nwithout, however, saying a word.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! one must have a taste of everything," confessed Mouret,\r\npretending to laugh as well. "Money is worthless, if it isn\'t spent."\r\n\r\n"As for that, I agree with you," resumed the baron. "Enjoy yourself, my\r\ndear fellow. I\'ll not be the one to preach to you, or to tremble for\r\nthe great interests we have confided to your care. Every one must sow\r\nhis wild oats, and his head is generally clearer afterwards. Besides,\r\nthere\'s nothing unpleasant in ruining one\'s self when one feels capable\r\nof building up another fortune. But if money is nothing, there are\r\ncertain sufferings----"\r\n\r\nHe stopped and his smile became sad; former sufferings doubtless\r\nreturned to his mind amid the irony of his scepticism. He had watched\r\nthe duel between Henriette and Mouret with the curiosity of a man who\r\nstill felt greatly interested in other people\'s love battles; and he\r\ndivined that the crisis had arrived, he guessed the pending drama,\r\nbeing well acquainted with the story of that girl Denise whom he had\r\nseen in the ante-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh! as for suffering, that\'s not in my line," said Mouret, in a tone\r\nof bravado. "It\'s quite enough to have to pay."\r\n\r\nThe baron looked at him for a moment without speaking. And not wishing\r\nto insist on the subject he added, slowly--"Don\'t make yourself out to\r\nbe worse than you are! You\'ll lose something else besides your money.\r\nYes, you\'ll lose a part of yourself, my dear fellow."\r\n\r\nThen he broke off again, laughing, to ask: "That often happens, does it\r\nnot, Monsieur de Vallagnosc?"\r\n\r\n"So they say, baron," the latter merely replied.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the door opened. Mouret, who was about to answer\r\nin his turn, started slightly, and both he and his companions turned\r\nround. It was Madame Desforges who, looking very gay, had put her head\r\nthrough the doorway to call, in a hurried voice--"Monsieur Mouret!\r\nMonsieur Mouret!" And then perceiving the others, she added, "Oh!\r\nyou\'ll excuse me, won\'t you, gentlemen? I\'m going to take Monsieur\r\nMouret away for a minute. The least he can do, as he has sold me such\r\na frightful mantle, is to give me the benefit of his experience. This\r\ngirl is a stupid thing without an idea in her head. Come, come! I\'m\r\nwaiting for you."\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, undecided, flinching from the scene he could foresee.\r\nHowever, he had to obey.\r\n\r\n"Go, my dear fellow, go, madame wants you," the baron said to him, with\r\nhis air at once paternal and mocking.\r\n\r\nThereupon Mouret followed her. The door closed, and he thought he could\r\nhear Vallagnosc\'s laugh, muffled by the hangings. His courage was\r\nentirely exhausted. Since Henriette had quitted the drawing-room, and\r\nhe had known Denise to be there in jealous hands, he had experienced a\r\ngrowing anxiety, a nervous torment, which made him listen from time to\r\ntime, as if suddenly startled by a distant sound of weeping. What could\r\nthat woman invent to torture her? And all his love, that love which\r\nsurprised him even now, went forth to the girl like a support and a\r\nconsolation. Never before had he loved like this, found such a powerful\r\ncharm in suffering. His former affections, his love for Henriette\r\nherself--so delicate, so handsome, so flattering to his pride--had\r\nnever been more than agreeable pastimes; whereas nowadays his heart\r\nbeat with anguish, his life was taken, he could no longer even enjoy\r\nthe forgetfulness of sleep. Denise was ever in his thoughts. Even at\r\nthis moment she was the sole object of his anxiety, and he was telling\r\nhimself that he preferred to be there to protect her, notwithstanding\r\nhis fear of some regrettable scene with the one he was following.\r\n\r\nAt first, they both crossed the bed-room, silent and empty. Then\r\nMadame Desforges, pushing open a door, entered the dressing-room, with\r\nMouret behind her. It was a rather large room, hung with red silk and\r\nfurnished with a marble toilet table and a large wardrobe with three\r\ncompartments and great glass doors. As the window overlooked the\r\ncourt-yard, it was already rather dark, and the two nickel-plated gas\r\nburners on either side of the wardrobe had been lighted.\r\n\r\n"Now, let\'s see," said Henriette, "perhaps we shall get on better."\r\n\r\nOn entering, Mouret had found Denise standing upright, in the middle\r\nof the bright light. She was very pale, modestly dressed in a cashmere\r\njacket, with a black hat on her head; and she was holding the mantle\r\npurchased at The Ladies\' Paradise. When she saw the young man her hands\r\nslightly trembled.\r\n\r\n"I wish Monsieur Mouret to judge," resumed Henriette. "Just help me,\r\nmademoiselle."\r\n\r\nThen Denise, approaching, had to give her the mantle. She had already\r\nplaced some pins on the shoulders, the part that did not fit. Henriette\r\nturned round to look at herself in the glass.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? Speak frankly," said she.\r\n\r\n"It really is a failure, madame," replied Mouret, to cut the matter\r\nshort. "It\'s very simple; the young lady will take your measure, and we\r\nwill make you another."\r\n\r\n"No, I want this one, I want it immediately," she resumed with\r\nvivacity. "But it\'s too narrow across the chest, and it forms a ruck\r\nat the back between the shoulders." Then, in her sharpest voice, she\r\nadded: "It\'s no use for you to stand looking at me, mademoiselle, that\r\nwon\'t make it any better! Try and find a remedy. It\'s your business."\r\n\r\nDenise again commenced to place the pins, without saying a word. This\r\nwent on for some time: she had to pass from one shoulder to the other,\r\nand was even obliged to go almost on her knees, in order to pull the\r\nmantle down in front. Above her, placing herself entirely in her hands,\r\nwas Madame Desforges, imparting to her face the harsh expression of a\r\nmistress exceedingly difficult to please. Delighted to lower the young\r\ngirl to this servant\'s work, she gave her curt orders, watching the\r\nwhile for the least sign of suffering on Mouret\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Put a pin here! No! not there, here, near the sleeve. You don\'t seem\r\nto understand! That isn\'t it, there\'s the ruck showing again. Take\r\ncare, you\'re pricking me now!"\r\n\r\nTwice again did Mouret vainly attempt to interfere, in order to put\r\nan end to this scene. His heart was beating violently from this\r\nhumiliation of his love; and he loved Denise more than ever, with\r\na deep tenderness, in presence of her admirably silent and patient\r\ndemeanour. If the girl\'s hands still trembled somewhat, at being\r\ntreated in this way before his face, she nevertheless accepted the\r\nnecessities of her position with the proud resignation of one who was\r\ncourageous. When Madame Desforges found they were not likely to betray\r\nthemselves, she tried another device: she began to smile on Mouret,\r\ntreating him openly as a lover. The pins having run short, she said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n"Look, my dear, in the ivory box on the dressing-table. Really! it\'s\r\nempty? Well, kindly look on the chimney-piece in the bed-room; you\r\nknow, just beside the looking-glass."\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if he were quite at home there, and knew where to find\r\neverything. And when he came back with a few pins, she took them one by\r\none, and forced him to remain near her, looking at him the while and\r\nspeaking low: "I don\'t fancy I\'m hump-backed, eh? Give me your hand,\r\nfeel my shoulders, just to please me. Am I really made like that?"\r\n\r\nDenise slowly raised her eyes, paler than ever, and in silence set\r\nabout placing the pins. Mouret could only see her heavy blonde tresses,\r\ntwisted at the back of her delicate neck; but by the slight tremor\r\nwhich was raising them, he could imagine the uneasiness and shame of\r\nher face. Hereafter she would most certainly repulse him, and send\r\nhim back to this woman who did not conceal her affection even before\r\nstrangers. Brutal thoughts came into his head, he could have struck\r\nHenriette. How was he to stop her talk? How tell Denise that he adored\r\nher, that she alone existed for him at this moment, and that he was\r\nready to sacrifice for her all his former caprices of a day? The worst\r\nof women would not have indulged in the equivocal familiarities of this\r\nwell-born lady. At last he withdrew his hand, saying:\r\n\r\n"You are wrong in being so obstinate, madame, since I myself consider\r\nthe garment to be a failure."\r\n\r\nOne of the gas jets was hissing; and in the stuffy, moist air of the\r\nroom, nothing else was heard but that ardent sibilant breath. On the\r\nred silk hangings the glass-doors of the wardrobe cast broad sheets\r\nof vivid light in which the shadows of the two women played. A bottle\r\ncontaining some essence of verbena, which had been left uncorked\r\ninadvertently, emitted a vague expiring odour of fading flowers.\r\n\r\n"There, madame, that is all I can do," at last said Denise, rising up.\r\n\r\nShe felt thoroughly worn out. Twice had she run the pins into her\r\nfingers, as if blind, her eyes clouded. Was he in the plot? Had he\r\nsent for her, to avenge himself for her refusal by showing her that\r\nother women had affection for him? This thought chilled her; she could\r\nnot remember having ever stood in need of so much courage, not even\r\nduring the terrible hours of her life when she had lacked bread. It was\r\ncomparatively nothing to be humiliated in this way, but to see him so\r\nunconstrained with that other woman was dreadful. Henriette looked at\r\nherself in the glass, and once more burst into harsh words.\r\n\r\n"What nonsense, mademoiselle! It fits worse than ever. Just see how\r\ntight it is across the chest. I look like a wet nurse!"\r\n\r\nDenise, losing all patience thereupon made a rather unfortunate remark:\r\n"You are rather stout, madame. We cannot make you thinner than you are."\r\n\r\n"Stout! stout!" exclaimed Henriette, turning pale in her turn. "You\'re\r\nbecoming insolent now, mademoiselle. Really, I should advise you to\r\ncriticize others!"\r\n\r\nThey both stood looking at one another, face to face, and trembling.\r\nThere was now neither lady nor shop-girl left. They were simply two\r\nwomen, made equal by their rivalry. The one had violently taken off the\r\nmantle and cast it on a chair, whilst the other was throwing on the\r\ndressing-table the few pins still remaining in her hands.\r\n\r\n"What astonishes me," resumed Henriette, "is that Monsieur Mouret\r\nshould tolerate such insolence. I thought, sir, that you were more\r\nparticular about your employees."\r\n\r\nDenise had again recovered her brave, calm manner. "If Monsieur Mouret\r\nkeeps me in his employ," she gently replied, "it\'s because he has no\r\nfault to find. I am ready to apologize to you, if he desires it."\r\n\r\nMouret was listening, excited by this quarrel but unable to find a\r\nword to put a stop to it. He had a great horror of these explanations\r\nbetween women, whose asperity clashed with his perpetual desire for\r\ngrace and refinement. Henriette was seeking to compel him to say\r\nsomething in condemnation of the girl; and, as he still remained mute\r\nand undecided, she stung him with a final insult:\r\n\r\n"Very good, sir. It seems that I must suffer the insolence of your\r\nmistresses in my own house even! A creature you\'ve picked out of some\r\ngutter!"\r\n\r\nTwo big tears gushed from Denise\'s eyes. She had been keeping them\r\nback for some time past; but beneath this last insult her whole being\r\nsuccumbed. And when he saw her weeping like that with a silent,\r\ndespairing dignity, never making the slightest attempt at retaliation,\r\nMouret no longer hesitated; his heart went forth to her full of immense\r\naffection. He took her hands in his and stammered: "Go away quickly, my\r\nchild, and forget this house!"\r\n\r\nHenriette, perfectly amazed, choking with anger, stood looking at them.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," he continued, folding up the mantle himself, "take\r\nthis garment away. Madame will purchase another one elsewhere. And pray\r\ndon\'t cry any more. You know how greatly I esteem you."\r\n\r\nHe went with her to the door, which he closed behind her. She had not\r\nsaid a word; but a pink flame had coloured her cheeks, whilst her eyes\r\nmoistened with fresh tears, tears of a delicious sweetness. Henriette,\r\nwho was suffocating, had taken out her handkerchief and was crushing\r\nher lips with it. This was a total overthrow of her calculations; she\r\nherself had been caught in the trap she had laid. She was mortified\r\nwith herself for having carried matters too far, and bitterly tortured\r\nby jealousy. To be abandoned for such a creature as that! To see\r\nherself disdained before her! Her pride suffered even more than her\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n"So, it\'s that girl you love?" she said painfully, when they were alone.\r\n\r\nMouret did not at once reply; he was walking about from the window to\r\nthe door, seeking to stifle his violent emotion. At last, however, he\r\nstopped, and very politely, in a voice which he tried to render frigid,\r\nhe replied in all simplicity: "Yes, madame."\r\n\r\nThe gas jet was still hissing in the stuffy air of the dressing-room.\r\nBut the reflections of the glass doors were no longer traversed by\r\ndancing shadows, the room seemed bare and full of profound sadness.\r\nAnd Henriette suddenly dropped upon a chair, twisting her handkerchief\r\nbetween her febrile fingers, and, repeating amid her sobs: "Good\r\nheavens! how wretched I am!"\r\n\r\nHe stood perfectly still, looking at her for several seconds, and then\r\nwent quietly away. She, left all alone, wept on in the silence, before\r\nthe pins scattered over the dressing-table and the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret returned to the little drawing-room, he found Vallagnosc\r\nalone, the baron having gone back to the ladies. As he still felt\r\nvery agitated, he sat down at the further end of the apartment, on a\r\nsofa; and his friend on seeing him so faint charitably came and stood\r\nbefore him, to conceal him from curious eyes. At first, they looked\r\nat each other without saying a word. Then, Vallagnosc, who seemed to\r\nbe inwardly amused by Mouret\'s emotion, finished by asking in his\r\nbantering voice: "Are you enjoying yourself?"\r\n\r\nMouret did not appear to understand him at first. But when he\r\nremembered their former conversations on the empty stupidity and\r\nuseless torture of life, he replied: "Of course, I\'ve never before\r\nlived so much. Ah! my boy, don\'t you laugh, the hours that make one\r\ndie of grief are by far the shortest!" Then he lowered his voice and\r\ncontinued gaily, beneath his half-dried tears: "Yes, you know all,\r\ndon\'t you? Between them they have rent my heart. But yet the wounds\r\nthey make are nice, almost as nice as kisses. I am thoroughly exhausted\r\nbut, no matter, you can\'t think how I love life! Oh! I shall win her at\r\nlast, that little girl who still says no!"\r\n\r\nBut Vallagnosc once more trotted out his pessimism. What was the good\r\nof working so much if money could not procure everything? He would\r\nprecious soon have shut up shop and have given up work on the day he\r\nfound that his millions could not even win him the woman he loved!\r\nMouret, as he listened became grave. But all at once he protested\r\nviolently, believing as he did in the all-powerfulness of his will.\r\n\r\n"I love her, and I\'ll win her!" said he. "But even if she escapes\r\nme, you\'ll see what a place I shall build to cure myself. It will be\r\nsplendid, all the same. You don\'t understand this language, old man,\r\notherwise you would know that action contains its own recompense. To\r\nact, to create, to struggle against facts, to overcome them or be\r\noverthrown by them, all human health and joy consists in that!"\r\n\r\n"A mere way of diverting one\'s self," murmured the other.\r\n\r\n"Well! I prefer diverting myself. As one must die, I would rather die\r\nof passion than boredom!"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, this reminded them of their old discussions at\r\ncollege. Then Vallagnosc, in an effeminate voice, began to parade his\r\ntheories of the insipidity of things, making almost a boast of the\r\nimmobility and emptiness of his existence. Yes, he would be as bored at\r\nthe Ministry on the morrow as he had been on the day before. In three\r\nyears he had had a rise of six hundred francs, he was now receiving\r\nthree thousand six hundred, barely enough to pay for his cigars. Things\r\nwere getting worse than ever, and if he did not kill himself, it was\r\nsimply from idleness and a dislike of trouble. On Mouret speaking of\r\nhis marriage with Mademoiselle de Boves, he replied that despite the\r\nobstinacy of the aunt in refusing to die, the matter was about to be\r\nconcluded; at least, he thought so, the parents were agreed, and he\r\naffected to have no will of his own. What was the use of wishing or not\r\nwishing, since things never turned out as one desired?\r\n\r\nAnd as an example of this he mentioned his future father-in-law, who\r\nhad expected to find in Madame Guibal an indolent blonde, the caprice\r\nof an hour, but was now led by her with a whip, like an old horse on\r\nits last legs. Whilst they supposed him to be inspecting the stud at\r\nSaint-L\xc3\xb4, he was squandering his last resources with her in a little\r\nhouse at Versailles.\r\n\r\n"He\'s happier than you," said Mouret, getting up.\r\n\r\n"Oh! rather!" declared Vallagnosc. "Perhaps there\'s only wrong-doing\r\nthat\'s at all amusing."\r\n\r\nMouret was now himself again. He was thinking about getting away; but\r\nnot wishing his departure to resemble a flight he resolved to take\r\na cup of tea, and therefore went into the big drawing-room with his\r\nfriend, both of them in high spirits. When the ladies inquired if the\r\nmantle had been made to fit, Mouret carelessly replied that he had\r\ngiven it up as a bad job as far as he was concerned. At this the others\r\nseemed astonished, and whilst Madame Marty hastened to serve him,\r\nMadame de Boves accused the shops of never allowing enough material for\r\ntheir garments.\r\n\r\nAt last, he managed to sit down near Bouthemont, who had not stirred.\r\nThe two were forgotten for a moment, and, in reply to the anxious\r\nquestions of Bouthemont, who wished to know what he had to expect,\r\nMouret did not hesitate any longer, but abruptly informed him that the\r\nboard of directors had decided to deprive themselves of his services.\r\nHe sipped his tea between each sentence he uttered, protesting all the\r\nwhile that he was in despair. Oh! a quarrel that he had not even yet\r\ngot over, for he had left the meeting beside himself with rage. But\r\nthen what could he do? he could not break with those gentlemen about\r\na simple staff question. Bouthemont, very pale, had to thank him once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n"What a terrible mantle," at last observed Madame Marty. "Henriette\r\ncan\'t get over it."\r\n\r\nAnd really the prolonged absence of the mistress of the house had\r\nbegun to make every one feel awkward. But, at that very moment, Madame\r\nDesforges appeared.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve given it up as well?" exclaimed Madame de Boves, gaily.\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Monsieur Mouret told us that you could do nothing with it."\r\n\r\nHenriette affected the greatest surprise. "Monsieur Mouret was joking,"\r\nsaid she. "The mantle will fit splendidly."\r\n\r\nShe appeared very calm and smiling. No doubt she had bathed her eyes,\r\nfor they were quite fresh, without the slightest trace of redness.\r\nWhilst her whole being was still trembling and bleeding, she managed\r\nto conceal her torment beneath a mask of smiling, well-bred elegance.\r\nAnd she offered some sandwiches to Vallagnosc with her usual graceful\r\nsmile. Only the baron who knew her so well, remarked the slight\r\ncontraction of her lips and the sombre fire which she had not been able\r\nto extinguish in the depths of her eyes. He guessed the whole scene.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! each one to her taste," said Madame de Boves, also accepting\r\na sandwich. "I know some women who would never buy a ribbon except\r\nat the Louvre. Others swear by the Bon March\xc3\xa9. It\'s a question of\r\ntemperament, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"The Bon March\xc3\xa9 is very provincial," murmured Madame Marty, "and one\r\ngets so crushed at the Louvre."\r\n\r\nThey had again returned to the big establishments. Mouret had to give\r\nhis opinion; he came up to them and affected to be very impartial.\r\nThe Bon March\xc3\xa9 was an excellent house, solid and respectable; but the\r\nLouvre certainly had a more showy class of customers.\r\n\r\n"In short, you prefer The Ladies\' Paradise," said the baron, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Mouret, quietly. "There we really love our customers."\r\n\r\nAll the women present were of his opinion. It was indeed just that; at\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise, they found themselves as at a sort of private\r\nparty, they felt a continual caress of flattery, an overflowing\r\nadoration which made the most dignified of them linger there. The vast\r\nsuccess of the establishment sprang from that gallant fascination.\r\n\r\n"By the way," asked Henriette, who wished to appear entirely at her\r\nease, "what have you done with my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e, Monsieur Mouret? You\r\nknow--Mademoiselle de Fontenailles." And, turning towards Madame\r\nMarty, she explained, "A marchioness, my dear, a poor girl fallen into\r\npoverty."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Mouret, "she earns three francs a day by stitching\r\npattern-books, and I fancy I shall be able to marry her to one of my\r\nmessengers."\r\n\r\n"Oh! fie! what a horror!" exclaimed Madame de Boves.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, and replied in his calm voice: "Why so, madame? Isn\'t\r\nit better for her to marry an honest, hard-working messenger than\r\nto run the risk of being picked up by some good-for-nothing fellow\r\noutside?"\r\n\r\nVallagnosc wished to interfere, for the sake of a joke. "Don\'t push him\r\ntoo far, madame, or he\'ll tell you that all the old families of France\r\nought to sell calico."\r\n\r\n"Well," declared Mouret, "it would at least be an honourable end for a\r\ngreat many of them."\r\n\r\nThey set up a laugh, the paradox seemed far fetched. But he continued\r\nto sing the praises of what he called the aristocracy of work. A slight\r\nflush had coloured Madame de Boves\'s cheeks, she was wild at the shifts\r\nto which she was put by her poverty; whilst Madame Marty, on the\r\ncontrary, approved what was said, stricken with remorse on thinking of\r\nher poor husband. Just then the footman ushered in the professor, who\r\nhad called to take her home. In his thin, shiny frock-coat he looked\r\nmore shrivelled than ever by all his hard toil. When he had thanked\r\nMadame Desforges for having spoken for him at the Ministry, he cast at\r\nMouret the timid glance of a man encountering the evil that is to kill\r\nhim. And he was quite confused when he heard the other ask him:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it true, sir, that work leads to everything?"\r\n\r\n"Work and thrift," replied he, with a slight shiver of his whole body.\r\n"Add thrift, sir."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bouthemont had not moved from his chair, Mouret\'s words\r\nwere still ringing in his ears. But at last he got up, and approaching\r\nHenriette said to her in a low tone: "Do you know, he\'s given me\r\nnotice; oh! in the kindest possible manner. But may I be hanged if he\r\nshan\'t repent it! I\'ve just found my sign, The Four Seasons, and shall\r\nplant myself close to the Opera House!"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a gloomy expression. "Reckon on me, I\'m with\r\nyou. Wait a minute," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith she drew Baron Hartmann into the recess of a window, and\r\nboldly recommended Bouthemont to him, as a fellow who would in his\r\nturn revolutionize Paris, by setting up for himself. When she went\r\non to speak of an advance of funds for her new prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, the baron,\r\nthough now never astonished at anything, could not restrain a gesture\r\nof bewilderment. This was the fourth fellow of genius that she had\r\nconfided to him, and he was beginning to feel ridiculous. But he did\r\nnot directly refuse, the idea of starting a competitor to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise even pleased him somewhat; for in banking matters he had\r\nalready invented this sort of competition, to keep off others. Besides,\r\nthe adventure amused him, and he promised to look into the matter.\r\n\r\n"We must talk it over to-night," whispered Henriette on returning to\r\nBouthemont. "Don\'t fail to call about nine o\'clock. The baron is with\r\nus."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the spacious room was full of chatter. Mouret, still\r\nstanding in the midst of the ladies, had recovered his elegant\r\ngracefulness; he was gaily defending himself from the charge of ruining\r\nthem in dress and offering to prove by figures that he enabled them\r\nto save thirty per cent on their purchases. Baron Hartmann watched\r\nhim, seized with a fraternal admiration. Come! the duel was finished,\r\nHenriette was decidedly beaten, she certainly was not the woman who was\r\nto avenge all the others. And he fancied he could again see the modest\r\nprofile of the girl whom he had observed when passing through the\r\nante-room. She stood there, waiting, alone redoubtable in her sweetness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the 25th of September that the building of the new fa\xc3\xa7ade\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise commenced. Baron Hartmann, according to his\r\npromise, had managed to settle the matter at the last general meeting\r\nof the Cr\xc3\xa9dit Immobilier. And Mouret was at length approaching the\r\nrealization of his dream: this fa\xc3\xa7ade, about to arise in the Rue du\r\nDix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, was like the very blossoming of his fortune. He therefore\r\ndesired to celebrate the laying of the foundation stone; and made it a\r\nceremony, besides distributing gratuities amongst his employees, and\r\ngiving them game and champagne for dinner in the evening. Every one\r\nnoticed his wonderful good humour during the ceremony, his victorious\r\ngesture as he made the first stone fast with a flourish of the trowel.\r\nFor weeks he had been anxious, agitated by a nervous torment that he\r\ndid not always manage to conceal; and his triumph brought a respite,\r\na distraction to his suffering. During the afternoon he seemed to\r\nhave returned to his former healthy gaiety. But, at dinner-time, when\r\nhe went through the refectory to drink a glass of champagne with his\r\nstaff, he appeared feverish again, smiling with a painful look, his\r\nfeatures drawn by the unconfessed suffering which was consuming him. He\r\nwas once more mastered by it.\r\n\r\nThe next day, in the cloak and mantle department, Clara Prunaire\r\ntried to be disagreeable with Denise. She had noticed Colomban\'s\r\nlackadaisical passion, and took it into her head to joke about the\r\nBaudus. As Marguerite was sharpening her pencil while waiting for\r\ncustomers, she said to her, in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n"You know my admirer opposite. It really grieves me to see him in that\r\ndark shop which no one ever enters."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not so badly off," replied Marguerite, "he\'s going to marry the\r\ngovernor\'s daughter."\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh!" resumed Clara, "it would be good fun to flirt with him then!\r\nI\'ll try the game, on my word of honour!"\r\n\r\nAnd she continued in the same strain, happy to feel that Denise was\r\nshocked. The latter forgave her everything else; but the thought of her\r\ndying cousin Genevi\xc3\xa8ve being finished off by such cruelty, exasperated\r\nher. As it happened, at that moment a customer came in, and as Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie had just gone downstairs, she took the direction of the\r\ncounter, and called Clara.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle Prunaire, you had better attend to this lady instead of\r\ngossiping there."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t gossiping."\r\n\r\n"Have the kindness to hold your tongue, and attend to this lady\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nClara gave in, conquered. When Denise showed her authority, without\r\nraising her voice, not one of them resisted. She had acquired this\r\nabsolute authority by her very moderation. For a moment she walked up\r\nand down in silence, amidst the young ladies who had become serious\r\nagain. Marguerite had resumed sharpening her pencil, the point of which\r\nwas always breaking.\r\n\r\n"What! you\'re getting angry?" all at once said a voice behind Denise.\r\n\r\nIt was Pauline, on her way across the department. She had noticed the\r\nscene, and spoke in a low tone, smiling.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m obliged to," replied Denise in the same tone, "I can\'t manage\r\nthem otherwise."\r\n\r\nPauline shrugged her shoulders. "Nonsense, you can be queen over all of\r\nus whenever you like," she replied. She was still unable to understand\r\nher friend\'s refusal.\r\n\r\nSince the end of August, Pauline had been married to Baug\xc3\xa9; a most\r\nstupid affair, she would sometimes gaily remark. That terrible\r\nBourdoncle treated her anyhow, now, considering her as lost for trade.\r\nHer great fear was that they might some fine day send her to love her\r\nhusband elsewhere, for the managers had decreed love to be execrable\r\nand fatal to business. So great was her dread, that when she met Baug\xc3\xa9\r\nin the galleries she often affected not to know him. She had just had\r\na fright--old Jouve having nearly caught her talking to her husband\r\nbehind a pile of dusters.\r\n\r\n"See! he\'s followed me," she added, after hastily relating the\r\nadventure to Denise. "Just look at him sniffing for me with his big\r\nnose!"\r\n\r\nJouve, in fact, was just then coming from the lace department,\r\ncorrectly arrayed in a white tie, and with his nose on the scent for\r\nsome delinquent. But when he saw Denise, his face relaxed and he passed\r\nby with an amiable smile.\r\n\r\n"Saved!" murmured Pauline. "My dear, you made him swallow that! I say,\r\nif anything should happen to me, you would speak for me, wouldn\'t you?\r\nYes, yes, don\'t put on that astonished air, we know that a word from\r\nyou would revolutionize the house."\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon she ran off to her counter. Denise had blushed, troubled\r\nby these friendly allusions. It was true, however. She had a vague\r\nsensation of her power from the flattery with which she was surrounded.\r\nWhen Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie returned, and found the department quiet and busy\r\nunder the surveillance of the second-hand, she smiled at her amicably.\r\nShe threw over Mouret himself, and her amiability daily increased for\r\nthe young person who might some fine morning desire her situation as\r\nfirst-hand. In a word Denise\'s reign was commencing.\r\n\r\nBourdoncle alone still stood out. In the secret warfare which he\r\ncarried on against the young girl, there was in the first place a\r\nnatural antipathy. He detested her for her gentleness and her charm.\r\nThen too he fought against her as against a fatal influence which would\r\nplace the house in peril on the day when Mouret should succumb. The\r\ngovernor\'s commercial genius seemed certain to founder in this stupid\r\naffection: all that they had gained by women would be swallowed up by\r\nthis one. None of them touched Bourdoncle\'s heart, he treated them all\r\nwith the disdain of a passionless man whose business was to live by\r\nthem, and whose last illusions had been dispelled by seeing them so\r\nclosely amidst the worries of his trade. And what made him especially\r\nanxious in the presence of this little saleswoman, who had gradually\r\nbecome so redoubtable, was that he did not in the least believe in her\r\ndisinterestedness, in the genuineness of her refusals. In his opinion\r\nshe was playing a part, the most skilful of parts, rendering Mouret\r\nabsolutely mad, capable of any folly.\r\n\r\nThus Bourdoncle could never now catch sight of her, with her clear\r\neyes, sweet face, and simple attitude, without experiencing a real\r\nfear, as if he had before him some disguised female flesh-eater, the\r\nsombre enigma of woman, Death in the guise of a virgin. In what way\r\ncould he possibly confound the tactics of this spurious novice? He was\r\nnow only anxious to penetrate her artful ways, in the hope of exposing\r\nthem to the light of day. She would certainly commit some fault at\r\nlast; he would surprise her with one of her sweethearts, and she would\r\nagain be dismissed. The house would then resume its regular working\r\nlike a well-appointed machine.\r\n\r\n"Keep a good look-out, Monsieur Jouve," Bourdoncle kept saying to the\r\ninspector. "I\'ll take care that you shall be rewarded."\r\n\r\nBut Jouve was somewhat lukewarm for he knew something about women, and\r\nasked himself whether he had not better take the part of this girl,\r\nwho might be the sovereign mistress of the morrow. Though he did not\r\nnow dare to touch her, he still thought her bewitchingly pretty. His\r\ncolonel in bygone days had killed himself for a similar little thing,\r\nwith an insignificant face, delicate and modest, one look from whom had\r\nravaged all hearts.\r\n\r\n"I\'m watching," he replied. "But, on my word, I cannot discover\r\nanything."\r\n\r\nAnd yet stories were circulating, there was quite a current of\r\nabominable tittle-tattle running beneath the flattery and respect which\r\nDenise felt arising around her. The whole house now declared that she\r\nhad formerly had Hutin for a sweetheart; and they were suspected of\r\nstill meeting from time to time. Deloche also was said to keep company\r\nwith her; they were continually meeting in dark corners and talking for\r\nhours together. It was quite a scandal!\r\n\r\n"So, there\'s nothing about the first-hand in the silk department, or\r\nabout the young man in the lace one?" asked Bourdoncle.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, nothing yet," replied the inspector.\r\n\r\nIt was with Deloche especially that Bourdoncle expected to surprise\r\nDenise, for one morning he himself had caught them laughing together\r\ndownstairs. In the meantime, he treated her on a footing of perfect\r\nequality, for he no longer disdained her, feeling that she was strong\r\nenough to overthrow even himself notwithstanding his ten years\'\r\nservice, should he lose the game.\r\n\r\n"Keep your eye on the young man in the lace department," he concluded\r\neach time. "They are always together. If you catch them, call me, and\r\nI\'ll manage the rest."\r\n\r\nMouret, meanwhile, was living in anguish. Was it possible that such\r\na child could torture him in this manner? He could always recall her\r\narrival at The Ladies\' Paradise, with her heavy shoes, thin black\r\ndress, and wild look. She stammered, they all used to laugh at her, he\r\nhimself had thought her ugly at first. Ugly! and now she could have\r\nbrought him to his knees by a look, for he thought her nothing less\r\nthan an angel! Then she had remained the last in the house, repulsed,\r\njoked at, treated by him as a curious specimen of humanity. For months\r\nhe had wanted to see how a girl sprung up, and had amused himself with\r\nthis experiment, not understanding that he was risking his heart. She,\r\nlittle by little had grown and become redoubtable. Perhaps he had loved\r\nher from the very first, even at the time when he had thought that he\r\nfelt nothing but pity for her. And yet, he had only really begun to\r\nfeel this love on the evening of their walk under the chestnut trees\r\nof the Tuileries. His life dated from then; he could still hear the\r\nlaughter of a group of little girls, the distant fall of a jet of\r\nwater, whilst in the warm shade she walked on beside him in silence.\r\nAfter that, he knew no more, his fever had increased hour by hour; all\r\nhis blood, his whole being, in fact, had been given to her. And she,\r\nsuch a child--was it possible? When she passed by now, the slight gust\r\nfrom her dress seemed to him so powerful that he staggered.\r\n\r\nFor a long time he had struggled, and even now he frequently became\r\nindignant and endeavoured to free himself from this idiotic possession.\r\nWhat power was it she possessed that she should be able to bind him\r\nin this way? Had he not seen her without boots to her feet? Had she\r\nnot been received almost out of charity? He could have understood\r\nhad it been a question of one of those superb creatures who charm\r\nthe multitude! but this little girl; this nobody! She had, in short,\r\none of those insignificant faces which excite no remark. She could\r\nnot even be very intelligent, for he remembered her bad beginning as\r\na saleswoman. But, after every explosion of anger, he experienced a\r\nrelapse of passion, a kind of sacred terror at having insulted his\r\nidol. She possessed everything a woman can have that is good--courage,\r\ngaiety, simplicity; and from her gentleness a charm of penetrating,\r\nperfume-like subtlety was exhaled. One might at first ignore her, or\r\nelbow her like any other girl; but the charm soon began to act with\r\ninvincible force; and one belonged to her for ever, if she deigned to\r\nsmile. Everything then beamed in her white face, her soft eyes, her\r\ncheeks and chin full of dimples; whilst her heavy blonde hair also\r\nseemed to light up with a royal and conquering beauty. He acknowledged\r\nhimself vanquished; she was as intelligent as she was beautiful, her\r\nintelligence came from the best part of her being. Whilst in his eyes\r\nthe other saleswomen only possessed a superficial education, the\r\nvarnish which scales off from girls of that class, she, without any\r\nfalse elegance, retained her native grace, the savour of her origin.\r\nThe broadest commercial ideas sprang up from her experience, behind her\r\nnarrow forehead, whose pure lines clearly announced the presence of a\r\nfirm will and love of order. And he could have clasped his hands to ask\r\nher pardon for blaspheming in his hours of revolt.\r\n\r\nWhy did she still refuse with such obstinacy? Twenty times had he\r\nentreated her, increasing his offers, offering money and more money.\r\nThen, thinking that she must be ambitious, he had promised to appoint\r\nher first-hand, as soon as there should be a vacancy. And she had\r\nrefused, and still refused! For him it was a stupor, a struggle in\r\nwhich his desire became rageful.\r\n\r\nAll his days were now spent amidst the same grievous obsession.\r\nDenise\'s image rose with him. After he had dreamed of her all night,\r\nshe followed him to the desk in his office, where he signed the bills\r\nand orders from nine to ten o\'clock: a work which he accomplished\r\nmechanically, never ceasing to feel her present, still saying "no,"\r\nwith her quiet air. Then, at ten o\'clock, came the board-meeting, quite\r\na cabinet council composed of the twelve directors, at which he had to\r\npreside; they discussed matters affecting the in-door arrangements,\r\nexamined the purchases, settled the window displays; and yet she was\r\nstill there, he heard her soft voice amidst the figures, he saw her\r\nbright smile amidst the most complicated financial situations. After\r\nthe board-meeting, she accompanied him on the daily inspection of the\r\ndepartments, and returning with him to his office in the afternoon,\r\nshe remained close to his chair from two till four o\'clock, whilst he\r\nreceived a crowd of important business men, the principal manufacturers\r\nof France, bankers and inventors: a continual coming-and-going of the\r\nwealth and intelligence of the land, a mad dance of millions, rapid\r\ninterviews during which the biggest affairs of the Paris market were\r\nconcluded. If he forgot her for a moment whilst he was deciding to\r\nruin or support an industry, he found her again at a sudden twitch of\r\nhis heart; his voice died away, and he asked himself what could be\r\nthe use of this princely fortune since she still refused. At last,\r\nwhen five o\'clock struck, he had to sign the day\'s correspondence,\r\nand the mechanical working of his hand began again, whilst she rose\r\nup before him more domineering than ever, seizing him entirely, to\r\nhold possession of him throughout the solitary and ardent hours of the\r\nnight. And the morrows were the same days over again, days which were\r\nso active, so full of colossal labour but which the slight shadow of a\r\nchild sufficed to ravage with anguish.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was particularly during his daily inspection of the\r\ndepartments that he felt his misery. To have built up this giant\r\nmachine, to reign over such a world of people, and yet to be dying of\r\ngrief because a little girl would not accept him! He scorned himself,\r\ndragging the fever and shame of his pain about with him everywhere. On\r\ncertain days he became disgusted with his power; from one end to the\r\nother of the galleries he felt nothing but nausea. At other times he\r\nwould have wished to extend his empire, and make it so vast that she\r\nwould perhaps have yielded out of sheer admiration and fear.\r\n\r\nHe would begin by stopping in the basement opposite the shoot. This was\r\nstill in the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin; but it had been necessary to\r\nenlarge it, and it was now as wide as the bed of a river, down which\r\nthe continual flood of goods rolled with the loud noise of rushing\r\nwater. There was a succession of arrivals from all parts of the world,\r\nrows of waggons from every railway, a ceaseless unloading, a stream\r\nof packing-cases and bales flowing underground and absorbed by the\r\ninsatiable establishment. He gazed at this torrent pouring into his\r\nhouse, he felt that he was one of the masters of the public fortune,\r\nthat he held in his hands the fate of French manufactures, and yet was\r\nunable to buy a kiss from one of his saleswomen.\r\n\r\nThen he passed on to the receiving department, which now occupied that\r\npart of the basement skirting the Rue Monsigny. Twenty tables were\r\nranged there, in the pale light from the air-holes; quite a crowd\r\nof assistants was bustling about, emptying cases, checking goods,\r\nand marking them in plain figures, amidst the neighbouring roar of\r\nthe shoot, which almost drowned their voices. Various managers of\r\ndepartments stopped him, he had to solve difficulties and confirm\r\norders. The cellar filled with the soft glimmer of satin and the\r\nwhiteness of linen, a prodigious unpacking in which furs were mingled\r\nwith lace, French fancy goods with Eastern hangings. With a slow step\r\nhe wended his way amidst all these riches thrown about in disorder,\r\nheaped up in their rough state. Up above, they would shine in the\r\nwindow displays, set money galloping through the departments, no sooner\r\nshown than carried off, in the furious rush of business which traversed\r\nthe place. But he kept on thinking that he had offered Denise silks and\r\nvelvets, anything she might like to take in no matter what quantity,\r\nfrom among these enormous heaps, and that she had refused his offer by\r\na slight shake of her fair head.\r\n\r\nAfter that, he went to the other end of the basement, to pay his usual\r\nvisit to the delivery department. Interminable corridors ran along,\r\nlighted by gas; to the right and the left, the reserves, closed in\r\nwith gratings, seemed like so many subterranean stores, a complete\r\ncommercial district, with its haberdashery, underclothing, glove,\r\ntoy and other shops, all sleeping in the gloom. Further on stood one\r\nof the three hot-air stoves; further still, was a post of firemen\r\nguarding the main gas-meter, enclosed in its iron cage. He found, in\r\nthe delivery department, the sorting tables already littered with heaps\r\nof parcels, band-boxes, and cases which were continually arriving in\r\nlarge hampers; and Campion, the superintendent, gave him particulars\r\nabout the current work, whilst the twenty men placed under his orders\r\ndistributed the parcels among large compartments, each of which bore\r\nthe name of a district of Paris, and whence the messengers took them up\r\nto the vans waiting beside the foot pavement. There was a succession\r\nof cries, names of streets and other instructions were shouted out,\r\nquite an uproar arose, all the bustle of a mail-boat about to leave\r\nher moorings. And he stood there for a moment, motionless, watching\r\nthis emission of goods which he had just seen the house absorb at the\r\nopposite end of the basement: the huge current ended here; it was here\r\nthat it discharged itself into the street again after filling the tills\r\nwith gold. But his eyes became dim, this colossal business no longer\r\nhad any importance for him; he had but one idea, that of going away to\r\nsome distant land, and abandoning everything, should she persist in\r\nsaying no.\r\n\r\nThen he went upstairs, continuing his inspection, talking and\r\nbestirring himself more and more, but without finding any respite.\r\nOn the second floor, he entered the forwarding department, seeking\r\nquarrels and secretly exasperated with the perfect regularity of the\r\nmachine which he had himself built up. This department was the one that\r\nwas daily assuming a more considerable importance: it now occupied\r\ntwo hundred employees--some of whom opened, read, and classified the\r\nletters coming from the provinces and abroad, whilst others collected\r\nin compartments the goods ordered by customers. And the number of\r\nletters was increasing to such an extent that they no longer counted\r\nthem; they weighed them, receiving as much as a hundredweight a day. He\r\nfeverishly went through the three offices, questioning Levasseur, the\r\nchief, as to the weight of the correspondence; now it was eighty, now\r\nninety, sometimes, on a Monday, a hundred pounds. The figure increased\r\ndaily, he ought to have been delighted. But he stood quivering amid\r\nthe noise made by a neighbouring squad of packers nailing down the\r\ncases. It was in vain that he roamed about the building: his fixed\r\nidea remained fast in his mind, and as his power unfolded itself\r\nbefore him, as the mechanism of the business and the army of employees\r\npassed before his gaze, he felt more deeply than ever the taunt of\r\nhis powerlessness. Orders from all Europe were flowing in, a special\r\npost-office van was required for his correspondence; and yet she said\r\nno, always no.\r\n\r\nHe returned downstairs and visited the central cashier\'s office, where\r\nfour clerks guarded the two giant safes, through which eighty-eight\r\nmillion francs had passed during the previous year. He glanced at the\r\nclearing-house office which now occupied thirty-five clerks, chosen\r\nfrom amongst the most trustworthy. He went into the checking office,\r\nwhere twenty-five young men, junior clerks, checked the debit-notes\r\nand calculated the salesmen\'s commissions. He returned to the chief\r\ncashier\'s office, grew exasperated by the sight of the safes, wandered\r\nabout amidst these millions, the uselessness of which was driving him\r\nmad. She said no, always no.\r\n\r\nAnd it was always and ever no, in all the departments, in the\r\ngalleries, the saloons, in every part of the establishment! He went\r\nfrom the silk to the drapery department, from the linen to the lace;\r\nhe ascended to the upper floors, pausing on the hanging bridges,\r\nprolonging his inspection with a maniacal, grievous minuteness. The\r\nhouse had grown and spread beyond all bounds, he had created this\r\ndepartment, then that other; he governed that fresh domain, he extended\r\nhis empire into that industry, the last one conquered; and it was no,\r\nalways no, in spite of everything. His staff would now have sufficed\r\nto people a small town: there were fifteen hundred salesmen, and a\r\nthousand other employees of every sort, including forty inspectors and\r\nseventy cashiers; the kitchens alone gave occupation to thirty-two men;\r\nten clerks were set apart for the advertising service; there were three\r\nhundred and fifty shop messengers, all wearing livery, and twenty-four\r\nfiremen living on the premises. And the stables, royal buildings\r\nsituated in the Rue Monsigny, opposite the warehouses, accommodated\r\none hundred and forty-five horses, a splendid set of animals already\r\ncelebrated. The first four conveyances which had stirred up the whole\r\nneighbourhood formerly when the house occupied only the corner of the\r\nPlace Gaillon, had gradually increased to sixty-two: small hand-trucks,\r\none-horse vans, and heavy two-horse ones. They were continually\r\nscouring Paris, skilfully driven by coachmen clad in black, and bearing\r\nhither and thither the gold and purple sign of The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nThey even went beyond the fortifications, and sped through the\r\nsuburbs; they were to be met in the hollow roads of Bic\xc3\xaatre and along\r\nthe banks of the Marne, along even the shady drives of the Forest of\r\nSaint-Germain. Sometimes one would emerge from the depths of some sunny\r\navenue, where all was silent and deserted, the superb animals which\r\ndrew it passing by at a trot, whilst it cast the glaring advertisement\r\nof its varnished panels upon the mysterious peacefulness of nature.\r\nMouret was actually thinking of sending these vehicles further still,\r\neven into the neighbouring departments; he would have liked to hear\r\nthem rolling along every road in France, from one frontier to the\r\nother. But he no longer even crossed the street to visit his horses,\r\nthough he was passionately fond of them. Of what good was this conquest\r\nof the world, since it was no, always no?\r\n\r\nNowadays of an evening, when he arrived at Lhomme\'s desk, he still from\r\nforce of habit glanced at the amount of the takings written on a card,\r\nwhich the cashier stuck up on an iron file beside him; this figure\r\nrarely fell below a hundred thousand francs, sometimes on big sale days\r\nit ran up to eight and nine hundred thousand; but the amount no longer\r\nsounded in Mouret\'s ears like a trumpet-blast, he regretted having\r\nlooked at it, and bitterly went his way, full of hatred and scorn of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nBut his sufferings were destined to increase, for he became jealous.\r\nOne morning, in the office, before the board-meeting began, Bourdoncle\r\nventured to hint that the little girl in the mantle department was\r\nplaying with him.\r\n\r\n"How so?" he asked, turning very pale.\r\n\r\n"Why yes! she has sweethearts in this very building."\r\n\r\nMouret found strength to smile. "I don\'t think any more about her, my\r\ndear fellow. You can speak freely. Who are they?"\r\n\r\n"Hutin, they say, and then a salesman in the lace department--Deloche,\r\nthat tall awkward fellow. I can\'t speak with certainty, never having\r\nseen them together. But it appears that it\'s notorious."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Mouret affected to arrange the papers on his table\r\nin order to conceal the trembling of his hands. At last, he observed,\r\nwithout raising his head: "One must have proofs, try and bring me some\r\nproofs. As for myself, I assure you I don\'t care in the least, for I\'m\r\nquite sick of her. But we can\'t allow such things to go on here."\r\n\r\n"Never fear," replied Bouthemont, "you shall have proofs one of these\r\ndays. I\'m keeping a good look-out."\r\n\r\nThis news deprived Mouret of all rest. He had not the courage to\r\nrevert to the conversation, but lived in continual expectation of a\r\ncatastrophe, in which his heart would be crushed. And this torment\r\nrendered him terrible; he made the whole house tremble. He now\r\ndisdained to conceal himself behind Bourdoncle, and performed the\r\nexecutions in person, feeling a nervous desire for revenge, solacing\r\nhimself by abuse of his power, that power which could do nothing for\r\nthe contentment of his sole desire. Each of his inspections became a\r\nmassacre; as soon as he was seen a shudder of panic sped from counter\r\nto counter. The dead winter season was just then approaching, and he\r\nmade a clean sweep in each department, piling up victims and hustling\r\nthem into the street. His first idea had been to dismiss Hutin and\r\nDeloche; but he had reflected that if he did not keep them, he would\r\nnever discover anything; and the others suffered for them: the whole\r\nstaff trembled. In the evening, when he found himself alone again,\r\ntears made his eyelids swell.\r\n\r\nOne day especially terror reigned supreme. An inspector had the idea\r\nthat Mignot was stealing. There was always a number of strange-looking\r\ngirls prowling around his counter; and one of them had lately been\r\narrested, her hips and bosom padded with sixty pairs of gloves. From\r\nthat moment a watch was kept, and the inspector caught Mignot in the\r\nact of facilitating the sleight of hand of a tall fair girl who had\r\nformerly been a saleswoman at the Louvre. His plan was very simple,\r\nhe pretended to be trying some gloves on her, waited till she had\r\npadded herself, and then conducted her to the pay-desk, where she paid\r\nfor a single pair only. Mouret happened to be there, just at that\r\nmoment. As a rule, he preferred not to mix himself up in affairs of\r\nthis sort, which were fairly frequent; for notwithstanding the regular\r\nmachine-like working, great disorder reigned in certain departments\r\nof The Ladies\' Paradise, and scarcely a week passed by without some\r\nemployee being dismissed for theft. The management preferred to hush up\r\nsuch matters as far as possible, considering it undesirable to set the\r\npolice at work, and thus expose one of the fatal plague-spots of these\r\ngreat bazaars. But, that day, Mouret felt a real need of venting his\r\nanger on some one, and treated handsome Mignot with such violence, that\r\nthe latter stood there trembling with fear, his face pale and distorted.\r\n\r\n"I ought to call a policeman," cried Mouret, before all the other\r\nsalesmen. "But answer me! who is this woman? I swear I\'ll send for the\r\npolice commissary, if you don\'t tell me the truth."\r\n\r\nThe woman had been taken away, and two saleswomen were searching her.\r\n"I don\'t know her, sir," Mignot stammered out: "She\'s the one who\r\ncame----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell lies!" interrupted Mouret, more violently still. "And\r\nthere\'s nobody here to warn us! You are all in the plot, on my word!\r\nWe are robbed, pillaged, plundered. It\'s enough to make us have the\r\npockets of each one searched before he leaves!"\r\n\r\nMurmurs were heard. The three or four customers buying gloves stood\r\nlooking on, frightened.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" he resumed, furiously, "or I\'ll clear the whole place!"\r\n\r\nHowever, Bourdoncle came running up, all anxiety at the idea of the\r\nscandal. He whispered a few words in Mouret\'s ear, the affair was\r\nassuming exceptional gravity; and he prevailed on him to take Mignot\r\ninto the inspectors office, a room on the ground-floor near the\r\nentrance in the Rue Gaillon. The woman was there, quietly putting on\r\nher things again. She had just mentioned Albert Lhomme\'s name. Mignot,\r\non again being questioned, lost his head, and began to sob; he wasn\'t\r\nin fault, it was Albert who sent him these girls; he had at first\r\nmerely afforded them certain advantages, enabling them to profit by the\r\nbargains; and at last when they took to stealing, he was already too\r\nfar compromised to report the matter. The principals now discovered\r\na series of extraordinary robberies; goods taken away by girls who\r\nwent into the luxurious lavatories, situated near the refreshment bar\r\nand surrounded by evergreen plants, to hide them under their skirts;\r\npurchases which a salesman neglected to call out at a pay-desk, when\r\nhe accompanied a customer there and the price of which he divided with\r\nthe cashier; and even false "returns," articles which employees said\r\nhad been brought back in order that they might pocket the refunded\r\nmoney; without mentioning the common robberies of things which the\r\nsalesmen took away under their coats in the evening, sometimes rolled\r\nround their bodies, and sometimes even hung down their legs. For the\r\nlast fourteen months, thanks to Mignot and other salesmen, no doubt,\r\nwhom they refused to name, this pilfering had been going on at Albert\'s\r\ndesk--quite an impudent trafficking in articles representing a large\r\namount of money which was never correctly ascertained.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news had spread through the various departments, causing\r\nguilty consciences to tremble, whilst the most honest quaked at thought\r\nof the general sweep that seemed imminent. Albert had disappeared into\r\nthe inspector\'s office. Next his father had passed by, half choking,\r\nhis face red and showing signs of apoplexy. Then Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie herself\r\nwas called; and came down bearing the affront with head erect, her fat\r\npuffy countenance having the appearance of a wax mask. The explanation\r\nlasted for some time; no one knew the exact details, but it was said\r\nthat the first-hand had slapped her son\'s face, whilst the worthy old\r\nfather wept, and the governor, contrary to all his elegant habits,\r\nswore like a trooper, absolutely wanting to hand the offenders over\r\nto justice. However, the scandal was hushed up. Mignot was the only\r\none dismissed there and then. Albert did not disappear till two days\r\nlater; his mother had doubtless begged that the family might not be\r\ndishonoured by an immediate execution. Still the panic lasted several\r\ndays longer, for after this scene Mouret wandered from one end of the\r\nestablishment to the other, with a terrible expression, venting his\r\nanger on all those who dared even to raise their eyes.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there, sir, looking at the flies? Go and get paid!"\r\n\r\nAt last, the storm burst one day on the head of Hutin himself. Favier,\r\nnow appointed second, was undermining the first-hand, in order to\r\ndislodge him from his position. This was always the way; he addressed\r\ncrafty reports to the directors, taking advantage of every opportunity\r\nto have the first-hand caught doing something wrong. Thus, one morning,\r\nas Mouret was going through the silk department, he stopped short quite\r\nsurprised to see Favier altering the price tickets of a stock of black\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\n"Why are you lowering the prices?" he asked. "Who gave you the order to\r\ndo so?"\r\n\r\nThe second-hand, who was making a great fuss over this work, as if he\r\nwished to attract the governor\'s attention and foresaw the result,\r\nreplied with an innocent, astonished air: "Why, Monsieur Hutin told me,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Hutin! Where is Monsieur Hutin?"\r\n\r\nAnd when the latter came up from the receiving department where a\r\nsalesman had been sent to fetch him, an animated explanation ensued.\r\nWhat! he undertook to lower the prices of his own accord now! What\r\ndid that mean? But in his turn he appeared greatly astonished, having\r\nmerely talked the matter over with Favier, without giving any positive\r\norders. The latter then assumed the sorrowful air of an employee who\r\nfinds himself obliged to contradict his superior. Yet he was quite\r\nwilling to accept the blame, if it would get the latter out of a\r\nscrape. Things began to look very bad.\r\n\r\n"Understand, Monsieur Hutin!" cried Mouret, "I have never tolerated\r\nthese attempts at independence. We alone decide about the prices."\r\n\r\nHe went on speaking in a sharp voice, and with wounding intentions,\r\nwhich surprised the salesmen, for as a rule these discussions were\r\ncarried on quietly, and the affair might really have been the result\r\nof a misunderstanding. One could divine, however, that he had some\r\nunavowed spite to satisfy. He had at last caught that Hutin in fault,\r\nthat Hutin who was said to be Denise\'s sweetheart. He could now relieve\r\nhimself, by making the other feel that he, Mouret, was the master! And\r\nhe exaggerated matters, even insinuating that this reduction of price\r\nappeared to conceal very questionable intentions.\r\n\r\n"Sir," repeated Hutin, "I meant to consult you about it. It is really\r\nnecessary, as you know, for there has been no demand for these velvets."\r\n\r\nMouret cut him short with a final harsh remark. "Very good, sir; we\r\nwill look into the matter. But don\'t do such a thing again, if you\r\nvalue your situation."\r\n\r\nAnd then he walked off. Hutin, bewildered, furious, finding no one but\r\nFavier to confide in, swore that he would go and throw his resignation\r\nat the brute\'s head. But he soon left off talking of leaving, and began\r\nto stir up all the abominable accusations which were current amongst\r\nthe salesmen against their chiefs. And Favier, his eyes sparkling,\r\ndefended himself with a great show of sympathy. He was obliged to\r\nreply, wasn\'t he? Besides, could any one have foreseen such a row over\r\nso trifling a matter? What had come on the governor lately, that he\r\nshould be so unbearable?\r\n\r\n"We all know what\'s the matter with him," replied Hutin. "Is it my\r\nfault if that little jade in the mantle department is turning his\r\nhead? My dear follow, you can see that the blow comes from there. He\'s\r\naware that she fancied me, and he doesn\'t like it; or perhaps it\'s she\r\nherself who wants to get me dismissed because I\'m in her way. But I\r\nswear she shall hear from me, if ever she crosses my path."\r\n\r\nTwo days later, as Hutin was going into the work-rooms upstairs, under\r\nthe leads, to recommend a girl of his acquaintance, he started on\r\nperceiving Denise and Deloche leaning against a window at the end of a\r\npassage and plunged so deeply in private conversation that they did not\r\neven turn round. The idea of having them caught there suddenly occurred\r\nto him, when he perceived with astonishment that Deloche was weeping.\r\nHe at once went off without making any noise; and meeting Bourdoncle\r\nand Jouve on the stairs, told them some story about one of the\r\nfire-extinguishers, the door of which seemed to have been torn away;\r\nin this manner they would go upstairs and drop on to the two others.\r\nBourdoncle discovered them first. He stopped short, and told Jouve to\r\ngo and fetch the governor, whilst he remained there. The inspector had\r\nto obey, though greatly annoyed at being forced to mix himself up in\r\nsuch a matter.\r\n\r\nThis was a lost corner of the vast world where the people of The\r\nLadies\' Paradise bestirred themselves. You reached it by an intricate\r\nnetwork of stairs and passages. The work-rooms, situated in the\r\nattics, were low sloping chambers, lighted by large windows cut in\r\nthe zinc roofing, and furnished solely with long tables and large\r\ncast-iron stoves; and all along was a crowd of work-girls engaged on\r\nthe under-clothing, the lace, the upholstery and the dressmaking, and\r\nliving winter and summer in a stifling heat, amidst the odour peculiar\r\nto the business. You had to skirt all these rooms, and turn to the\r\nright after passing the dressmakers, before coming to the solitary\r\nend of the corridor. The few customers, whom a salesman occasionally\r\nbrought here for an order, gasped for breath, tired out and frightened,\r\nwith the sensation of having turned round and round for hours, and of\r\nbeing a hundred leagues above the street.\r\n\r\nDenise had often found Deloche waiting for her. As second-hand she had\r\ncharge of the arrangements between her department and the work-room\r\nwhere only the models and alterations were attended to, and was\r\nalways going up and down to give the necessary orders. The young man\r\nwould watch for her and invent any pretext to run after her; and then\r\naffected to be surprised when he met her at the work-room door. She\r\ngot to laugh about the matter and it became quite an understood thing.\r\nThe corridor ran alongside one of the cisterns, an enormous iron tank\r\ncontaining twelve thousand gallons of water; and on the roof there was\r\nanother one of equal size, reached by an iron ladder. For an instant,\r\nDeloche would stand talking, leaning one shoulder against the cistern\r\nin the continual abandonment of his long body, bent by fatigue. A\r\nsing-song noise of water was heard, a mysterious noise, the musical\r\nvibration of which the iron tank ever retained. Despite the solitude,\r\nDenise would at times turn round anxiously, thinking, she had seen a\r\nshadow pass on the bare, pale yellow walls. But the window would soon\r\nattract them, they would lean against it, and forget themselves in a\r\npleasant gossip, in endless souvenirs of their native place. Below them\r\nextended the immense glass roof of the central gallery, a lake of glass\r\nbounded by the distant housetops, as by a rocky coast. Beyond, they saw\r\nnothing but the sky, a sheet of sky, which cast in the sleeping water\r\nof the glass work a reflection of the flight of its clouds and its soft\r\nazure.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that Deloche was that day speaking of Valognes. "I was\r\nsix years old; my mother used to take me to Valognes market in a cart,"\r\nhe said. "You know it\'s ten miles away; we had to leave Briquebec at\r\nfive o\'clock. It\'s a fine country down our way. Do you know it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Denise, slowly, her glances wandering far away.\r\n"I was there once, but was very little then. Roads with grass on each\r\nside, eh? and now and again sheep browsing in couples, dragging their\r\nclog along by the rope." She stopped, then resumed with a vague smile:\r\n"Our roads run for miles as straight as arrows between rows of trees\r\nwhich afford some shade. We have meadows surrounded by hedges taller\r\nthan I am, where there are horses and cows grazing. We have a little\r\nriver too, and the water is very cold, under the brushwood, in a spot I\r\nwell know."\r\n\r\n"It is the same with us, exactly!" cried Deloche, delighted.\r\n\r\n"There\'s grass everywhere, each one encloses his plot with thorns\r\nand elms, and is at once at home; and it\'s quite green, a green far\r\ndifferent to what we see in Paris. Dear me! how I\'ve played in the\r\nhollow road, on the left, coming down from the mill!"\r\n\r\nTheir voices died away, they remained with their eyes fixed, lost on\r\nthe sunny lake of the glass work. A mirage rose up before them from\r\nthat blinding water, they beheld an endless succession of meadows,\r\nthe Cotentin country steeped in the breath of the ocean, bathed in a\r\nluminous vapour, which blurred the horizon with the delicate grey of a\r\nwater-colour. Below them, beneath the colossal iron framework, in the\r\nsilk hall, was the roar of business, the trepidation of the machine\r\nat work; the entire house vibrated with the tramping of the crowd,\r\nthe bustle of the salesmen, the life of the thirty thousand persons\r\nhurtling there; and they, carried away by their dreams, thought they\r\ncould hear the wind passing over the grass and shaking the tall trees,\r\nas they detected this deep dull clamour with which the roofs were\r\nresounding.\r\n\r\n"Ah! Mademoiselle Denise," stammered Deloche, "why aren\'t you kinder\r\nto me? I love you so much!" Tears had come into his eyes, and as she\r\nsigned to him to stop, he continued quickly: "No--let me tell you these\r\nthings once more. We should get on so well together! People always find\r\nsomething to talk about when they come from the same part."\r\n\r\nHe was choking, and she was at last able to say kindly: "You\'re\r\nnot reasonable; you promised me never to speak of that again. It\'s\r\nimpossible. I have great friendship for you, because you\'re a nice\r\nfellow; but I wish to remain free."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. I know," he replied in a broken voice, "you don\'t love\r\nme. Oh! you may say so, I quite understand it. There\'s nothing in me\r\nto make you love me. Listen, I\'ve only had one sweet moment in my\r\nlife, and that was when I met you at Joinville, do you remember? For\r\na moment, under the trees, when it was so dark, I thought your arm\r\ntrembled, and was stupid enough to imagine----"\r\n\r\nBut she again interrupted him. Her quick ear had just detected the\r\nsound of Bourdoncle\'s and Jouve\'s steps at the end of the corridor.\r\n\r\n"Hark, there\'s some one coming."\r\n\r\n"No," said he, preventing her from leaving the window, "it\'s in the\r\ncistern: all sorts of extraordinary noises come from it, as if there\r\nwere some one inside."\r\n\r\nAnd then he continued his timid caressing complaints. She was no longer\r\nlistening to him, however. Rocked into a dreamy mood by his declaration\r\nof love, her eyes wandering over the roofs of The Ladies\' Paradise. To\r\nthe right and the left of the large glazed gallery, other galleries and\r\nother halls were glistening in the sunshine, between the housetops,\r\npierced with garret windows and running along symmetrically, like the\r\nwings of a barracks. Metal ladders and bridges rose on all sides,\r\ndescribing a lacework of iron in the air; whilst the kitchen chimney\r\nbelched forth as much smoke as a factory, and the great square cistern,\r\nsupported aloft by cast-iron pillars, assumed the strange silhouette\r\nof some barbarous structure erected at this height by the pride of one\r\nman. In the distance, Paris roared.\r\n\r\nWhen Denise awoke from this dreamy contemplation of space and the\r\nsummits of The Ladies\' Paradise, where her thoughts floated as in a\r\nvast solitude, she found that Deloche had caught hold of her hand. And\r\nas he appeared so woe-begone she did not draw it away.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me," he murmured. "It\'s all over now; I should be too\r\nmiserable if you punished me by withdrawing your friendship. I\r\nassure you I intended to say something else. Yes, I had determined\r\nto understand the situation and be very good." Then his tears again\r\nbegan to flow and he tried to steady his voice. "For I know my lot in\r\nlife. It is too late for my luck to turn. Beaten at home, beaten in\r\nParis, beaten everywhere! I\'ve now been here four years and am still\r\nthe last in the department. So I wanted to tell you not to trouble on\r\nmy account. I won\'t annoy you any more. Try to be happy, love some one\r\nelse; yes, that would really be a pleasure for me. If you are happy, I\r\nshall be happy too. That will be my happiness."\r\n\r\nHe could say no more. As if to seal his promise he raised the young\r\ngirl\'s hand to his lips--kissing it with the humble kiss of a slave.\r\nShe was deeply affected, and said simply, in a tender, sisterly tone,\r\nwhich softened somewhat the pity of the words: "My poor lad!"\r\n\r\nBut they started, and turned round; Mouret was standing before them.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten minutes, Jouve had been searching all over the place\r\nfor the governor; the latter, however, was looking at the building of\r\nthe new fa\xc3\xa7ade in the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre. He spent long hours there\r\nevery day, trying to interest himself in this work, of which he had\r\nso long dreamed. There, amidst masons laying the huge corner-stones,\r\nand engineers setting up the great iron framework, he found a refuge\r\nagainst his torments. The fa\xc3\xa7ade already appeared above the level of\r\nthe street; and indications of the spacious porch, and the windows of\r\nthe first storey, a palace-like development in a crude state could be\r\nseen. Mouret scaled the ladders, discussing with the architect the\r\nornamentation which was to be something quite new, scrambled over the\r\nheaps of brick and iron, and even went down into the cellars; and the\r\nroar of the steam-engine, the tic-tac of the trowels, the loud noise\r\nof the hammers and the clamour of the army of workmen in this immense\r\ncage surrounded by sound-re\xc3\xabchoing planks, really diverted him for an\r\ninstant. He would come out white with plaster, black with iron-filings,\r\nhis feet splashed by the water from the pumps but nevertheless so far\r\nfrom being cured that his anguish returned and his heart beat more\r\nloudly than ever, as the uproar of the works died away behind him.\r\nIt so happened, on the day in question, that a slight diversion had\r\nbrought back his gaiety: he had become deeply interested in an album\r\nof drawings of the mosaics and enamelled terra-cotta which were to\r\ndecorate the friezes, when Jouve, out of breath, annoyed at being\r\nobliged to soil his frock coat amongst all the building materials came\r\nup to fetch him. At first Mouret cried out that they must wait; but, at\r\na word spoken in an undertone by the inspector, he immediately followed\r\nhim, trembling and again mastered by his passion. Nothing else existed,\r\nthe fa\xc3\xa7ade crumbled away before being built: what was the use of that\r\nsupreme triumph of his pride, if the mere name of a woman whispered in\r\nhis ear tortured him to this extent!\r\n\r\nUpstairs, Bourdoncle and Jouve thought it prudent to vanish. Deloche\r\nhad hastened away; Denise, paler than usual, alone remained face to\r\nface with Mouret, looking straight into his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Have the goodness to follow me, mademoiselle," he said in a harsh\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nShe followed him, they descended the two storeys, and crossed the\r\nfurniture and carpet departments without saying a word. When he arrived\r\nat his office, he opened the door wide, saying, "Walk in, mademoiselle."\r\n\r\nAnd, closing the door, he went to his table. The director\'s new office\r\nwas fitted up more luxuriously than the old one; the rep hangings had\r\nbeen replaced by velvet ones, and a book-case, inlaid with ivory,\r\noccupied one whole side; but on the walls there was still no other\r\npicture than the portrait of Madame H\xc3\xa9douin, a young woman with a calm\r\nhandsome face, smiling in a gilded frame.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," he said at last, trying to maintain a cold severe air,\r\n"there are certain things that we cannot tolerate. Good conduct is\r\nabsolutely necessary here."\r\n\r\nHe stopped, choosing his words, in order not to yield to the furious\r\nanger which was rising within him. What! it was that fellow she loved,\r\nthat wretched salesman, the laughing-stock of his counter! It was\r\nthe humblest, the most awkward of all that she preferred to him, the\r\nmaster! for he had seen them, she leaving her hand in his, and he\r\ncovering that hand with kisses.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been very good to you, mademoiselle," continued he, making a\r\nfresh effort. "I little expected to be rewarded in this way."\r\n\r\nDenise, immediately on entering, had been attracted by Madame\r\nH\xc3\xa9douin\'s portrait; and, notwithstanding her great trouble, was still\r\npre-occupied by it. Every time she came into the director\'s office her\r\neyes were sure to meet those of that painted lady. As a rule she was\r\nalmost afraid of her, although she knew her to have been very good.\r\nThis time, however, she felt her to be a kind of protection.\r\n\r\n"You are right, sir," she said, softly, "I was wrong to stop and talk,\r\nand I beg your pardon for doing so. This young man comes from my own\r\npart of the country."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll dismiss him!" cried Mouret, putting all his suffering into this\r\nfurious cry.\r\n\r\nAnd, completely overcome, entirely forgetting his position of director\r\nlecturing a saleswoman guilty of an infraction of the regulations,\r\nhe broke into a torrent of violent words. Had she no shame in her? a\r\nyoung girl like her to fall in love with such a being! and he even made\r\nmost atrocious accusations, introducing Hutin\'s name and the names of\r\nothers into the affair, with such a flood of words, that she could not\r\neven defend herself. But he would make a clean sweep, and kick them\r\nall out! The explanation he had resolved on, when following Jouve, had\r\ndegenerated into a violent scene of jealousy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, your lovers! They told me about it, and I was stupid enough to\r\ndoubt it. But I was the only one who did! I was the only one!"\r\n\r\nChoking and bewildered, Denise stood listening to these frightful\r\ncharges, which she had not at first understood. Did he really suppose\r\nher to be as bad as that? At another remark, harsher than all the rest,\r\nshe silently turned towards the door. And, as he made a movement to\r\nstop her, she said:\r\n\r\n"Let me alone, sir, I\'m going away. If you think me what you say, I\r\nwill not remain in the house another second."\r\n\r\nBut he rushed in front of the door, exclaiming: "Why don\'t you defend\r\nyourself? Say something!"\r\n\r\nShe stood there very stiff, maintaining an icy silence. For a long\r\ntime he pressed her with questions, with a growing anxiety; and the\r\nmute dignity of this innocent girl once more seemed to be the artful\r\ncalculation of a woman learned in all the tactics of passion. Had she\r\ndesired it, which she did not, she could not have played a game better\r\ncalculated to bring him to her feet, tortured by doubt, desirous of\r\nbeing convinced.\r\n\r\n"Come, you say he is from your part of the country? Perhaps you\'ve met\r\nthere formerly. Swear that there has been nothing between you and this\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\nAnd as she obstinately remained silent, as if still wishing to open\r\nthe door and go away, he completely lost his head, and gave way to a\r\nsupreme explosion of grief.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens! I love you! I love you! Why do you delight in tormenting\r\nme like this? You can see that nothing else exists for me, that the\r\npeople I speak about only touch me through you, that you alone can\r\noccupy my thoughts. Thinking you were jealous, I gave up all my\r\npleasures. You were told I had mistresses; well! I have them no longer;\r\nI hardly set foot outside. Did I not prefer you at that lady\'s house?\r\nhave I not quarrelled with her in order to belong solely to you? And\r\nI am still waiting for a word of thanks, a little gratitude. And if\r\nyou fear that I should return to her, you may feel quite easy: she is\r\navenging herself by helping one of our former salesmen to found a rival\r\nestablishment. Tell me, must I go on my knees to touch your heart?"\r\n\r\nHe had come to this. He, who did not tolerate the slightest peccadillo\r\namong the shopwomen, who turned them out for the least caprice,\r\nfound himself reduced to imploring one of them not to go away, not\r\nto abandon him in his misery! He held the door against her, ready to\r\nforgive her everything, to shut his eyes, if she merely deigned to\r\nlie. And he spoke the truth, he had quite reformed; he had long since\r\ngiven up Clara and had ceased to visit at Madame Desforges\'s house,\r\nwhere Bouthemont now reigned supreme, pending the opening of the\r\nnew establishment, The Four Seasons, which was already filling the\r\nnewspapers with its advertisements.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, must I go on my knees?" he repeated, almost choked by\r\nsuppressed tears.\r\n\r\nShe signed to him to cease speaking, herself quite unable to conceal\r\nher emotion, deeply affected by his suffering passion. "You are wrong,\r\nsir, to agitate yourself in this way," she at last replied. "I assure\r\nyou that all these wicked reports are untrue. That poor fellow you saw\r\njust now is no more guilty than I am."\r\n\r\nShe said this with her brave, frank air, looking with her bright eyes\r\nstraight into his face.\r\n\r\n"Very good, I believe you," he murmured. "I\'ll not dismiss any of your\r\ncomrades, since you take all these people under your protection. But\r\nwhy, then, do you repulse me, if you love no one else?"\r\n\r\nA sudden constraint, an anxious bashfulness came upon the young girl.\r\n\r\n"You love some one, do you not?" he resumed, in a trembling voice. "Oh!\r\nyou may speak out; I have no claim on your affections. Do you love any\r\none?"\r\n\r\nShe turned very red, her heart was in her mouth, and she felt all\r\nfalsehood impossible in the presence of the emotion which was betraying\r\nher, the repugnance for lying which made the truth appear in her face\r\nin spite of all.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she at last confessed, feebly. "But I beg you to let me go, sir,\r\nyou are torturing me."\r\n\r\nShe was now suffering in her turn. Was it not enough to have to defend\r\nherself against him? Must she even fight against herself, against the\r\ngust of tenderness which sometimes took away all her courage? When\r\nhe spoke to her like this, when she saw him such a prey to emotion,\r\nso overcome, she hardly knew why she still refused; and it was only\r\nafterwards that, in the depths of her healthy, girlish nature, she\r\nfound the pride and prudence which maintained her intact in her\r\nvirtuous resolutions.\r\n\r\nMouret gave way to a gesture of gloomy discouragement. He could not\r\nunderstand her. He turned towards his table, took up some papers and\r\nthen at once laid them down again, saying: "I will detain you no\r\nlonger, mademoiselle; I cannot keep you against your will."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t wish to go away," replied she, smiling. "If you believe me\r\nto be innocent, I will remain. One ought always to believe a woman to\r\nbe virtuous, sir. There are numbers who are so, I assure you."\r\n\r\nDenise had involuntarily raised her eyes towards Madame H\xc3\xa9douin\'s\r\nportrait; that lady so sensible and so beautiful, whose blood, they\r\nsaid, had brought good fortune to the house. Mouret followed the glance\r\nwith a start, for he thought he could hear his dead wife pronounce that\r\nphrase, one of her own sayings which he recognised. And it was like\r\na resurrection, he discovered in Denise the good sense, the mental\r\nequilibrium of her whom he had lost, even down to her gentle voice,\r\nsparing of useless words. He was struck by the resemblance, and it\r\nrendered him sadder still.\r\n\r\n"You know I am yours," he murmured in conclusion. "Do what you like\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nThen she resumed gaily: "That is right, sir. The advice of a woman,\r\nhowever humble she may be, is always worth listening to when she has a\r\nlittle intelligence. If you put yourself in my hands, you may be sure\r\nI\'ll make nothing but a good man of you!"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, with that simple unassuming air which possessed such a\r\ncharm. He also smiled in a feeble way, and escorted her as far as the\r\ndoor, as he might have done with a lady.\r\n\r\nThe next day Denise was appointed first-hand. The dress and costume\r\ndepartment was divided; the management creating especially for her\r\nbenefit a children\'s costume department, which was installed near that\r\nof the cloaks and mantles. Ever since her son\'s dismissal, Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie had been trembling, for she found the directors cooling towards\r\nher, and also observed the young woman\'s power increasing daily. Would\r\nthey not shortly take advantage of some pretext or other and sacrifice\r\nher in favour of Denise? Her imperial countenance, puffed up with fat,\r\nseemed to have grown thinner from the shame which now stained the\r\nLhomme dynasty; and she made a show of going away every evening on her\r\nhusband\'s arm, for they had been brought nearer together by misfortune,\r\nand vaguely felt that the evil came from the disorder of their home;\r\nwhilst the poor old man, more affected than her, a prey as he was to a\r\nsickly fear that he might himself be suspected of robbery, would count\r\nthe receipts twice over with a great deal of noise, performing miracles\r\nthe while with his injured arm. Accordingly when Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie saw\r\nDenise appointed first-hand of the children\'s costume department, she\r\nexperienced such delight that she paraded the most affectionate feeling\r\ntowards her, being indeed really grateful to her for not having taken\r\nher own place. And so she overwhelmed her with attentions, treating her\r\nas an equal, often going to talk to her in the neighbouring department,\r\nwith a stately air, like a queen-mother paying a visit to a young queen.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Denise was now at the summit. Her appointment as first-hand\r\nhad destroyed the last resistance. If some still babbled, from that\r\nitching of the tongue which infects every assemblage of men and\r\nwomen, all nevertheless bowed very low before her face. Marguerite,\r\nnow second-hand, was full of praise for her. Clara, herself, inspired\r\nwith a secret respect for this good fortune, which she felt herself\r\nincapable of achieving, bowed her head. But Denise\'s victory was still\r\nmore complete over the gentlemen; over Jouve, who now almost bent\r\ndouble whenever he addressed her; over Hutin, seized with anxiety on\r\nfeeling his position giving way under him; and over Bourdoncle, at\r\nlast reduced to powerlessness. When the latter saw her come out of the\r\ndirector\'s office, smiling, with her quiet air; and when on the morrow\r\nMouret had insisted on the board creating the new department, he had\r\nyielded, vanquished by his terror of woman. He had always thus given\r\nin to Mouret, recognising him to be the master, notwithstanding his\r\nescapades and idiotic love affairs. This time the woman had proved the\r\nstronger, and he was expecting to be swept away by the disaster.\r\n\r\nYet Denise bore her triumph in a quiet, charming manner, touched by\r\nthese marks of consideration, and desirous of interpreting them as\r\nsympathy for the miseries of her _d\xc3\xa9buts_ and the final success of\r\nher patient courage. Thus it was with laughing joy that she received\r\nthe slightest tokens of friendship, and this caused her to be really\r\nloved by some: she was so kind, sympathetic, and full of affection.\r\nThe only person for whom she still showed an invincible repugnance was\r\nClara, for she had learned that this girl had amused herself by leading\r\nColomban astray, even as she had said she would do, for a joke; and he,\r\ncarried away by his passion, was now becoming more dissipated every\r\nday, whilst poor Genevi\xc3\xa8ve was slowly dying. The affair was talked of\r\nat The Ladies\' Paradise, and thought very droll there.\r\n\r\nBut this trouble, the only one she had outside, did not in any way\r\nchange Denise\'s equable temper. It was especially in her department\r\nthat she was seen at her best, in the midst of her little world of\r\nbabies of all ages. She was passionately fond of children, and could\r\nnot have been placed in a better position. Sometimes there were fully\r\nfifty little girls and as many boys there, quite a turbulent school,\r\nall agog with the desires of budding coquetry. The mothers completely\r\nlost their heads. She, conciliatory and smiling, had the little ones\r\nplaced in a row, on chairs; and when among the number there happened\r\nto be a rosy-cheeked little angel, whose pretty face tempted her, she\r\nwould insist on serving her herself, bringing the dress and trying it\r\non the child\'s dimpled shoulders, with the tender precaution of an\r\nelder sister. Bursts of clear laughter rang out, faint cries of ecstasy\r\nwere raised amidst the scolding voices of the mothers. Sometimes a\r\nlittle girl, nine or ten years old, already a grand lady in her own\r\nestimation, would when trying on a cloth jacket stand studying it\r\nbefore a glass, now and again turning round with an absorbed air,\r\nwhile her eyes sparkled with the desire to please. The counters were\r\nlittered with unpacked goods, dresses in pink and blue Eastern cotton\r\nfor children of from one to five years old; sailor costumes in blue\r\n"zephyr" with plaited skirts and blouses trimmed with cambric; Louis\r\nXV. costumes, mantles, jackets; a medley of little garments, stiff in\r\ntheir infantile grace, something like the contents of the cloak-room\r\nof a band of big dolls, taken out of the wardrobes and given over to\r\npillage. Denise always had a few sweets in her pockets to appease the\r\ntears of some youngster in despair at not being able to carry off a\r\npair of red breeches; and she lived there amongst these little ones as\r\nin her own family, feeling quite young again herself from the contact\r\nof all the innocence and freshness incessantly renewed around her\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\nShe now at times had long friendly talks with Mouret. Whenever she\r\nwent to the office to take orders or furnish information, he would\r\nkeep her chatting, enjoying the sound of her voice. It was what she\r\nlaughingly called "making a good man of him." In her prudent, cautious\r\nNorman brain there sprang up all sorts of projects, ideas about the new\r\nstyle of business at which she had already ventured to hint when at\r\nRobineau\'s, and some of which she had expressed on the evening of their\r\ncharming walk in the Tuileries gardens. She could not be occupied in\r\nany matter or see any work going on, without being moved by a desire to\r\nintroduce some improvement into the mechanism. Thus, since her entry\r\ninto The Ladies\' Paradise, she had been particularly pained by the\r\nprecarious position of the employees; the sudden dismissals shocked\r\nher, she thought them iniquitous and stupid, hurtful to all, to the\r\nhouse as much as the staff. Her former sufferings were still fresh in\r\nher mind, and her heart filled with pity every time she saw a new-comer\r\nwith feet bruised and eyes dim with tears, dragging her misery along\r\nin her silk dress, amidst the spiteful persecution of the older\r\nhands. This dog\'s life made the best of them bad; and the sad work of\r\ndestruction commenced: they were all devoured by the business before\r\nthe age of forty, often disappearing, falling into unknown depths, a\r\ngreat many dying in harness, some of consumption and exhaustion, others\r\nof fatigue and bad air, whilst a few were thrown on the street, and\r\nthe happiest married and buried themselves in some little provincial\r\nshop. Was this frightful consumption of human life for which the big\r\nshops were responsible every year, right and just? And she pleaded the\r\ncause of the colossal machine\'s gearing not from sentimental reasons,\r\nbut by arguments appealing to the very interests of the employers. To\r\nmake a machine solid and strong, it is necessary to use good iron; if\r\nthe iron breaks or is broken, a stoppage of work, repeated expenses of\r\nrestarting, quite a loss of power, ensue.\r\n\r\nSometimes she would become quite animated, and picture an immense\r\nideal bazaar, the phalansterium of modern commerce, in which each\r\nwould secure his exact share of profits, according to his merits,\r\nwith a certainty of the future, assured to him by contract. Mouret\r\nwould make merry over this, notwithstanding his fever. He accused\r\nher of socialism, embarrassed her by pointing out the difficulties\r\nof carrying out these schemes; for she spoke in the simplicity of\r\nher soul, bravely trusting in the future, whenever she perceived a\r\ndangerous gap underlying her tender-hearted plans. Nevertheless he\r\nwas shaken, captivated by her young voice which still quivered at the\r\nthought of the hardships she had undergone, and was so instinct with\r\nearnestness as she pointed out reforms which would tend to consolidate\r\nthe house; and even while joking with her he listened. Thus the\r\nsalesmen\'s positions were gradually improved, the wholesale dismissals\r\nwere replaced by a system of holidays granted during the dead seasons,\r\nand it was decided to found a sort of benefit club which would protect\r\nthe employees against slack times and ensure them a pension. It was the\r\nembryo of the vast trades\' unions of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nMoreover Denise did not confine her attention solely to the healing\r\nof the wounds from which she had herself bled; she conceived various\r\ndelicate feminine ideas with which she prompted Mouret and which\r\ndelighted the customers. She also made Lhomme happy by supporting a\r\nscheme he had long entertained, that of creating a band of musicians,\r\nof which all the members should be chosen from amongst the staff.\r\nThree months later Lhomme had a hundred and twenty musicians under his\r\ndirection, and the dream of his whole life was realized. And a grand\r\nf\xc3\xaate was then given on the premises, a concert and a ball, to introduce\r\nthe band of The Ladies\' Paradise to the customers and the whole\r\nworld. The newspapers took the matter up, Bourdoncle himself, though\r\nstaggered by these innovations, was obliged to bow before the immense\r\nadvertisement. Afterwards came the establishment of a recreation room\r\nfor the men, with two billiard tables and backgammon and chess boards.\r\nThen classes were held in the house of an evening; lessons were given\r\nin English and German, in grammar, arithmetic, and geography; at\r\nlast too there were even riding and fencing lessons. A library was\r\nalso formed, ten thousand volumes were placed at the disposal of the\r\nemployees. And afterwards came a resident doctor, giving consultations\r\ngratis; together with baths, and hair-dressing and refreshment saloons.\r\nEvery want of life was provided for, everything--board, lodging,\r\nclothing and education--was to be obtained without going out of doors.\r\nThere, in the very heart of Paris, now all agog with the clatter of\r\nthis working city which was springing up so vigorously amidst the ruins\r\nof the olden streets, at last opened to the sunshine, The Ladies\'\r\nParadise sufficed entirely for all its own wants and pleasures.\r\n\r\nThen a further change of opinion took place in Denise\'s favour. As\r\nBourdoncle, vanquished, repeated with despair to his friends that\r\nhe would himself give a great deal to prevail upon Denise to accept\r\nMouret, it was concluded that she still refused to do so, and that her\r\nall-powerfulness resulted from her refusal. From that moment she became\r\npopular. They knew for what indulgences they were indebted to her, and\r\nthey admired her for the strength of her will. There, at all events,\r\nwas one who could master the governor, who avenged all the others, and\r\nknew how to get something more than promises out of him! So she had\r\ncome at last, she who caused him to treat the poor and humble with a\r\nlittle consideration! When she passed through the departments, with her\r\ndelicate, self-willed head, her gentle, invincible air, the salesmen\r\nsmiled at her, felt proud of her, and would willingly have exhibited\r\nher to the crowd. She, in her happiness, allowed herself to be carried\r\nalong by this increasing sympathy. But was it all possible? She again\r\nsaw herself arriving in a shabby dress, frightened, lost amidst the\r\nmechanism of the terrible machine; for a long time she had felt she was\r\nnothing, barely a grain of millet beneath the millstones which were\r\ncrushing a whole world; and now to-day she was the very soul of this\r\nworld, she alone was of any consequence, able at a word to increase or\r\nslacken the pace of the colossus lying at her feet. And yet she had\r\nnot wished for these things, she had simply presented herself, without\r\ncalculation, possessed of naught but the charm of her sweetness. Her\r\nsovereignty sometimes caused her an uneasy surprise: why did they all\r\nobey her? she was not pretty, she did nothing wrong. Then she smiled,\r\nher heart at rest, feeling within herself naught but goodness and\r\nprudence, a love of truth and logic which constituted all her strength.\r\n\r\nOne of Denise\'s greatest joys at this time was to be able to assist\r\nPauline. The latter, now about to become a mother, was trembling, for\r\nshe knew that two other saleswomen similarly circumstanced had been\r\nsent away. The principals did not tolerate maternity; they occasionally\r\nallowed marriage, but would admit of no children. Pauline, it was\r\ntrue, had her husband in the house; but still she felt anxious, and in\r\norder to postpone a probable dismissal, sought to conceal her state\r\nas long as she could. But Bourdoncle had observed that her complexion\r\nwas getting very pale and one morning while he was standing near her,\r\nin the under-linen department, a messenger, taking away a bundle, ran\r\nagainst her with such force that she cried out with pain. Bourdoncle\r\nimmediately took her on one side, made her confess, and submitted\r\nthe question of her dismissal to the board, under the pretext that\r\nshe was in need of country air. Mouret, who was not at the meeting,\r\ncould only give his opinion in the evening. But Denise having had time\r\nto interpose, he closed Bourdoncle\'s mouth, in the interests of the\r\nestablishment itself. Did they wish to wound the feelings of all the\r\nmothers and young married women amongst their customers? And so it was\r\ndecided, with great solemnity, that every married saleswoman should,\r\nwhenever necessary, be sent to a special midwife\'s at the Paradise\'s\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe next day when Denise went up to the infirmary to see Pauline, who\r\nhad been obliged to take to her bed on account of the blow she had\r\nreceived, the latter kissed her heartily on both cheeks. "How kind you\r\nare! Had it not been for you I should have been turned away. Pray don\'t\r\nbe anxious about me, the doctor says it\'s nothing."\r\n\r\nBaug\xc3\xa9, who had slipped away from his department, was also there, on the\r\nother side of the bed. He likewise stammered his thanks, disturbed in\r\nthe presence of Denise, whom he now treated as an important person of a\r\nsuperior class. Ah! if he heard any more unkind remarks about her, he\r\nwould soon close the mouths of the jealous ones! But Pauline sent him\r\naway with a good-natured shrug of the shoulders.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear, you\'re always saying something stupid. Leave us to talk\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nThe infirmary was a long, light room, containing twelve beds with\r\nwhite curtains. Those who did not wish to go home to their families\r\nwere nursed there. However, on the day in question, Pauline was the\r\nonly occupant. Her bed was near one of the large windows which looked\r\non to the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin. And amidst the white hangings,\r\nin the calm atmosphere perfumed with a faint odour of lavender, they\r\nimmediately began to exchange confidences in soft, affectionate\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\n"So he does just what you wish him to, all the same," said Pauline.\r\n"How cruel you are, to make him suffer so! Come, just explain it to me,\r\nnow that I\'ve ventured to approach the subject. Do you detest him?"\r\n\r\nPauline had retained hold of Denise\'s hand, as the latter sat near the\r\nbed, with her elbow resting on the bolster; and Denise was overcome by\r\nsudden emotion. Her cheeks flushed red and, in a momentary weakness,\r\nher secret escaped her at this direct and unexpected question.\r\n\r\n"I love him!" she murmured, burying her head in the pillow.\r\n\r\nPauline was astonished. "What! you love him?" And, after a pause, she\r\nasked: "So it\'s all to make him marry you?"\r\n\r\nBut at this, the young girl sprang up, quite confused: "Marry me! Oh,\r\nno! Oh! I assure you that I have never wished for anything of the kind!\r\nNo, never has such an idea entered my head; and you know what a horror\r\nI have of all falsehood!"\r\n\r\n"Well, dear," resumed Pauline, kindly, "you couldn\'t have acted\r\notherwise, if such had been your intention. All this must come to an\r\nend, and it is very certain that it can only finish by a marriage so\r\nfar as you are concerned. I must tell you that everybody here has the\r\nsame idea: yes, they are convinced that you are riding the high horse,\r\nin order to make him take you to church. Dear me! what a funny girl you\r\nare!"\r\n\r\nAnd then she had to console Denise, who had again sunk down with her\r\nhead on the bolster, sobbing and declaring that she would certainly go\r\naway, since they attributed to her all sorts of things that had never\r\neven crossed her mind. No doubt, when a man loved a woman he ought to\r\nmarry her. But she asked for nothing, she had made no calculations, she\r\nsimply begged that she might be allowed to live quietly, with her joys\r\nand sorrows, like other people. Yes, she would go away.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mouret was crossing the premises below, seeking to\r\nforget his thoughts by visiting the works once more. Several months\r\nhad elapsed, the fa\xc3\xa7ade now reared its monumental proportions behind\r\nthe vast hoarding which concealed it from the public. Quite an army of\r\ndecorators, marble-cutters, mosaic-workers, and others, were at work.\r\nThe central group above the door was being gilded, whilst the pedestals\r\ndestined to support statues of the manufacturing cities of France, were\r\nbeing fixed on the acroteria. Along the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, lately\r\nopened to the public, a crowd of idlers now stood from morning till\r\nnight, looking up, seeing nothing, but nevertheless interested in the\r\nmarvels related of this fa\xc3\xa7ade, the inauguration of which was expected\r\nto revolutionize Paris. And it was beside this new building full of the\r\nfever of work, amidst the artists putting the finishing touches to the\r\nrealization of his dream as commenced by the masons, that Mouret more\r\nbitterly than ever realized the vanity of his fortune. The thought of\r\nDenise suddenly came upon him, that thought which incessantly pierced\r\nhim with a flame, like the shooting of an incurable pain. And then he\r\nran away, unable to find a word of satisfaction, fearful lest he should\r\ndisplay his tears, and leaving behind him the disgust of triumph. That\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade, which was at last erected, seemed but trifling in his eyes,\r\nvery much like one of those walls of sand that children build, and\r\nit might have been prolonged from one end of the city to the other,\r\nelevated to the starry sky and yet would not have filled the void of\r\nhis heart, which only the "yes" of a mere child could satisfy.\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret returned to his office he was almost choking with sobs.\r\nWhat did she want? He dared not offer her money now; but the confused\r\nidea of marriage presented itself amidst his revolts. And, in the\r\ndebility of his powerlessness, his tears began to flow. He was indeed\r\nvery unhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning in November, Denise was giving her first orders in the\r\ndepartment when the Baudus\' servant came to tell her that Mademoiselle\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve had passed a very bad night, and wished to see her\r\nimmediately. For some time the poor girl had been getting weaker and\r\nweaker, and had been obliged to take to her bed two days before.\r\n\r\n"Say I am coming at once," replied Denise, feeling very anxious.\r\n\r\nThe blow which was finishing Genevi\xc3\xa8ve was Colomban\'s sudden\r\ndisappearance. At first, chaffed by Clara, he had grown very\r\ndissipated; then, yielding to the wild desires which at times master\r\nsly, chaste men, he had become her obedient slave; and one Monday\r\ninstead of returning to the shop had sent a farewell letter to Baudu,\r\nwritten in the studied terms of one who is about to commit suicide.\r\nPerhaps, at the bottom of this freak, there was also the calculating\r\ncraft of a man delighted at escaping from a disastrous marriage. The\r\nbusiness was in as bad a way as his betrothed, so the moment was\r\na propitious one for breaking with them both. And every one cited\r\nColomban as an unfortunate victim of love.\r\n\r\nWhen Denise reached The Old Elbeuf, Madame Baudu, with her small white\r\nface consumed by an\xc3\xa6mia, was there alone, sitting motionless behind\r\nthe pay-desk, and watching over the silence and emptiness of the shop.\r\nThere was no assistant now. The servant dusted the shelves; and it was\r\neven a question of replacing her by a charwoman. A dreary cold hung\r\nabout the ceiling; hours passed by without a customer coming to disturb\r\nthe gloom, and the goods, no longer handled, became more and more musty\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Denise, anxiously. "Is Genevi\xc3\xa8ve in danger?"\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu did not at first reply. Her eyes filled with tears. Then\r\nsuddenly she stammered: "I don\'t know; they don\'t tell me anything. Ah,\r\nit\'s all over, it\'s all over."\r\n\r\nAnd she cast a dim glance round the dark shop, as if she felt that her\r\ndaughter and The Old Elbeuf were disappearing together. The seventy\r\nthousand francs, produced by the sale of their Rambouillet property,\r\nhad in less than two years melted away in the abyss of competition.\r\nIn order to struggle against The Ladies\' Paradise, which now kept\r\nmen\'s cloths, even materials for hunting, shooting, and livery suits,\r\nthe draper had made considerable sacrifices. But at last he had been\r\naltogether crushed by the swan-skin cloths and the flannels sold by\r\nhis rival, an assortment that had not its equal in the market. Little\r\nby little his debts had increased, and, as a last resource, he had\r\nresolved to mortgage the old building in the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re,\r\nwhere Finet, their ancestor, had founded the business. And it was now\r\nonly a question of days, the crumbling away had nearly finished, the\r\nvery ceilings seemed to be falling and turning into dust, even an old\r\nworm-eaten structure is carried away by the wind.\r\n\r\n"Your uncle is upstairs," resumed Madame Baudu in her broken voice. "We\r\neach stay with her in turn for a couple of hours. Some one must stay\r\nhere; oh! but only as a precaution, for to tell the truth----"\r\n\r\nHer gesture finished the phrase. They would have put the shutters up\r\nhad it not been for their old commercial pride, which still kept them\r\nerect in the presence of the neighbours.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll go up, aunt," said Denise, whose heart ached amidst the\r\nresigned despair that even the pieces of cloth themselves exhaled.\r\n\r\n"Yes, go upstairs quick, my girl. She\'s expecting you, she\'s been\r\nasking for you all night. She had something to tell you."\r\n\r\nBut just at that moment Baudu came down. Bile had now given his yellow\r\nface a greenish hue, and his eyes were bloodshot. He was still walking\r\nwith the muffled tread with which he had quitted the sick room, and\r\nmurmured, as though he might be overheard upstairs, "She\'s asleep."\r\n\r\nThen, thoroughly worn out, he sat down on a chair, mopping his forehead\r\nwith a mechanical gesture and puffing like a man who has just finished\r\nsome hard work. A pause ensued, but at last he said to Denise: "You\'ll\r\nsee her presently. When she is sleeping, she seems to us to be all\r\nright again."\r\n\r\nAgain did silence fall. Face to face, the father and mother stood\r\nlooking at one another. Then, in a low voice he went over his grief\r\nagain, though without naming any one or addressing any one directly:\r\n"With my head on the block, I wouldn\'t have believed it! He was the\r\nlast one, I had brought him up as a son. If any one had come and said\r\nto me, \'They\'ll take him away from you as well; you\'ll see him fall,\'\r\nI should have replied, \'It\'s impossible, that can\'t happen as long as\r\nthere\'s a God on high.\' But he has fallen all the same! Ah! the poor\r\nfellow, he who was so well up in the business, who had all my ideas!\r\nAnd all through a young she-ape, a mere dummy fit for a window! No!\r\nreally, it\'s enough to drive one mad!"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, with his half-closed eyes cast upon the damp floor\r\nwhich the tread of generations of customers had worn. Then he continued\r\nin a lower voice, "Shall I tell you? Well, there are moments when I\r\nfeel myself the most culpable of all in our misfortune. Yes, it\'s my\r\nfault if our poor girl is lying upstairs devoured by fever. Ought I not\r\nto have married them at once, without yielding to my stupid pride, my\r\nobstinacy in refusing to leave them the business in a less prosperous\r\nstate than it had been before? Had I done that she would now have the\r\nman she loved, and perhaps their youthful strength united would have\r\naccomplished the miracle that I have failed to work. But I am an old\r\nfool, and saw through nothing; I didn\'t know that people fell ill over\r\nsuch things. Really, he was an extraordinary fellow: he had such a gift\r\nfor business, and such probity, such simplicity of conduct, he was so\r\norderly in every way--in short, my pupil."\r\n\r\nHe raised his head, still defending his ideas, in the person of the\r\nshopman who had betrayed him. Denise, however, could not bear to hear\r\nhim accuse himself, and carried away by her emotion, on seeing him so\r\nhumble, with his eyes full of tears, he who used formerly to reign\r\nthere as an absolute and scolding master, she told him everything.\r\n\r\n"Uncle, pray don\'t excuse him," said she. "He never loved Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, he\r\nwould have run away sooner if you had tried to hasten the marriage. I\r\nhave spoken to him myself about it; he was perfectly well aware that my\r\npoor cousin was suffering on his account, and yet you see that did not\r\nprevent him from leaving. Ask aunt."\r\n\r\nWithout opening her lips, Madame Baudu confirmed these words by a\r\nnod. The draper turned paler still, blinded by his tears. And then he\r\nstammered out: "It must have been in the blood, his father died last\r\nyear through having led a dissolute life."\r\n\r\nAnd once more he looked round the dim shop, his eyes wandering from the\r\nempty counters to the full shelves and then resting on Madame Baudu,\r\nwho was still sitting erect at the pay-desk, waiting in vain for the\r\ncustomers who did not come.\r\n\r\n"Well," said he, "it\'s all over. They\'ve ruined our business, and now\r\none of their hussies is killing our daughter."\r\n\r\nNo one spoke. The rolling of passing vehicles, which occasionally\r\nshook the floor, seemed like a funereal beating of drums in the still\r\nair, so stuffy under the low ceiling. But suddenly, amidst this gloomy\r\nsadness peculiar to old expiring shops, several dull knocks were heard\r\nproceeding from somewhere in the house. It was Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, who had just\r\nawoke, and was knocking with a stick they had left beside her.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go up at once," said Baudu, rising with a start. "And try to be\r\ncheerful, she mustn\'t know."\r\n\r\nHe himself as he went upstairs rubbed his eyes, in order to remove the\r\ntraces of his tears. As soon as he opened the door, on the first floor,\r\nthey heard a frightened, feeble voice crying: "Oh, I don\'t like to be\r\nleft alone. Don\'t leave me; I\'m afraid to be left alone." However, when\r\nshe perceived Denise, Genevi\xc3\xa8ve became calmer, and smiled joyfully.\r\n"You\'ve come, then! How I\'ve been longing to see you since yesterday! I\r\nthought you also had abandoned me!"\r\n\r\nIt was a piteous spectacle. The young woman\'s room, a little room into\r\nwhich came a livid light, looked out on to the yard. At first her\r\nparents had put her in their room, in the front part of the house; but\r\nthe sight of The Ladies\' Paradise opposite affected her so deeply, that\r\nthey had been obliged to bring her back to her own again. And there she\r\nlay, so very thin under the bed-clothes, that you could hardly divine\r\nthe form and existence of a human body. Her skinny arms, consumed by\r\nthe burning fever of consumption, were in a perpetual movement of\r\nanxious, unconscious searching; whilst her black hair, heavy with\r\npassion, seemed thicker still, and to be preying with its voracious\r\nvitality upon her poor face, that face in which was fading the final\r\ndegenerateness of a long lineage, a family that had grown and lived in\r\nthe gloom of that cellar of old commercial Paris. Denise, her heart\r\nbursting with pity, stood looking at her. She did not at first speak,\r\nfor fear of giving way to tears. However, she at last murmured: "I came\r\nat once. Can I be of any use to you? You asked for me. Would you like\r\nme to stay?"\r\n\r\n"No, thanks. I don\'t need anything. I only wanted to embrace you."\r\n\r\nTears filled her eyes. Denise quickly leant over and kissed her,\r\ntrembling at the flame which came from those hollow cheeks to her own\r\nlips. But Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, stretching out her arms caught hold of her and\r\nkept her in a desperate embrace. Then she looked towards her father.\r\n\r\n"Would you like me to stay?" repeated Denise. "Perhaps there is\r\nsomething I can do for you."\r\n\r\n"No, no." Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s glance was still obstinately fixed on her father,\r\nwho remained standing there with a bewildered air, almost choking.\r\nHowever, he at last understood her and went away, without saying a\r\nword. They heard his heavy footsteps descending the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, is he with that woman?" the sick girl then eagerly inquired\r\nwhile catching hold of her cousin\'s hand, and making her sit down on\r\nthe edge of the bed. "Yes, I wanted to see you as you are the only one\r\nwho can tell me. They\'re together, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\nIn the surprise which these questions gave her Denise began to stammer,\r\nand was obliged to confess the truth, the rumours that were current at\r\nthe Paradise. Clara, it was said, had already grown tired of Colomban,\r\nwho was pursuing her everywhere, striving to obtain an occasional\r\nappointment by a sort of canine humility. It was also said that he was\r\nabout to take a situation at the Grands Magasins du Louvre.\r\n\r\n"If you love him so much, he may yet come back," added Denise seeking\r\nto cheer the dying girl with this last hope. "Make haste and get well,\r\nhe will acknowledge his errors, and marry you."\r\n\r\nBut Genevi\xc3\xa8ve interrupted her. She had listened with all her soul, with\r\nan intense passion which had raised her in the bed. Now, however, she\r\nfell back. "No, I know it\'s all over! I don\'t say anything, because I\r\nsee papa crying, and I don\'t wish to make mamma worse than she is. But\r\nI am going, Denise, and if I called for you last night it was for fear\r\nof going off before the morning. And to think that he is not even happy\r\nafter all!"\r\n\r\nThen as Denise remonstrated with her, assuring her that she was not\r\nso bad as all that, she again cut her short by suddenly throwing back\r\nthe bed-clothes with the chaste gesture of a virgin who has nothing to\r\nconceal in death. Her bosom bare, she murmured: "Look at me! Is it not\r\nthe end?"\r\n\r\nTrembling with mingled horror and pity, Denise hastily rose from the\r\nbed, as if she feared that her very breath might suffice to destroy\r\nthat puny emaciated form. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve slowly covered her bosom again,\r\nsaying: "You see I am no longer a woman. It would be wrong to wish for\r\nhim still!"\r\n\r\nSilence fell between them. They continued gazing at each other, unable\r\nto find a word to say. At last it was Genevi\xc3\xa8ve who resumed: "Come,\r\ndon\'t stay any longer, you have your own affairs to look after. And\r\nthanks, I was tormented by the wish to know, and now am satisfied. If\r\nyou ever see him again, tell him I forgive him. Farewell, dear Denise.\r\nKiss me once more, for it\'s the last time."\r\n\r\nThe young woman kissed her, still protesting: "No, no, don\'t despair,\r\nall you want is careful nursing, nothing more."\r\n\r\nBut the sick girl smiled, shaking her head in an obstinate way, like\r\none who will not be deceived. And as her cousin at last walked towards\r\nthe door, she exclaimed: "Wait a minute, knock on the floor with this\r\nstick, so that papa may come up. I\'m afraid to stay alone."\r\n\r\nThen, when Baudu reached the little dismal room, where he spent long\r\nhours seated on a chair, she assumed an air of gaiety, saying to\r\nDenise--"Don\'t come to-morrow, I would rather not. But on Sunday I\r\nshall expect you; you can spend the afternoon with me."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at six o\'clock, Genevi\xc3\xa8ve expired after four hours\'\r\nfearful agony. The funeral took place on a Saturday, a dark cloudy day,\r\nwith a sooty sky hanging low above the shivering city. The Old Elbeuf,\r\nhung with white drapery, lighted up the street with a bright speck, and\r\nthe candles burning in the gloom seemed like so many stars enveloped in\r\ntwilight. Bead-work wreaths and a great bouquet of white roses covered\r\nthe coffin--a narrow child\'s coffin,--placed in the dark passage of the\r\nhouse close to the pavement, so near indeed to the gutter that passing\r\nvehicles had already splashed the drapery. With its continual rush of\r\npedestrians on the muddy footways the whole neighbourhood reeked of\r\ndampness, exhaled a cellar-like mouldy odour.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock Denise came over to stay with her aunt. But when the\r\nfuneral was about to start, the latter--who had ceased weeping, her\r\neyes scorched by her hot tears--begged her to follow the body and look\r\nafter her uncle, whose mute affliction and almost idiotic grief filled\r\nthe family with anxiety. Downstairs, the young woman found the street\r\nfull of people, for the small traders of the neighbourhood were anxious\r\nto give the Baudus a mark of sympathy, and in their eagerness there\r\nwas a desire for a demonstration against that Ladies\' Paradise, which\r\nthey accused of having caused Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s slow agony. All the victims\r\nof the monster were there--B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9 and Sister, the hosiers of the Rue\r\nGaillon, Vanpouille Brothers, the furriers, Desligni\xc3\xa8res the toyman,\r\nand Piot and Rivoire the furniture dealers; even Mademoiselle Tatin,\r\nthe dealer in under-linen, and Quinette the glover, though long since\r\ncleared off by bankruptcy, had made it a duty to come, the one from\r\nBatignolles, the other from the Bastille, where they had been obliged\r\nto take situations. And whilst waiting for the hearse, which was late,\r\nall these people, clad in black and tramping in the mud, cast glances\r\nof hatred towards The Ladies\' Paradise, whose bright windows and gay\r\ndisplays seemed an insult in face of The Old Elbeuf, which, with its\r\nfuneral trappings and glimmering candles, lent an air of mourning to\r\nthe other side of the street. The faces of a few inquisitive salesmen\r\nappeared at the plate-glass windows of the Paradise; but the colossus\r\nitself preserved the indifference of a machine going at full speed,\r\nunconscious of the deaths it may cause on the road.\r\n\r\nDenise looked round for her brother Jean, and at last perceived him\r\nstanding before Bourras\'s shop; whereupon she crossed over and asked\r\nhim to walk with his uncle, and assist him should he be unable to get\r\nalong. For the last few weeks Jean had been very grave, as if tormented\r\nby some worry. That morning, buttoned up in his black frock-coat, for\r\nhe was now a full-grown man, earning his twenty francs a day, he seemed\r\nso dignified and sad that his sister was surprised, having had no idea\r\nthat he loved their cousin so much. Desirous of sparing P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 a needless\r\ngrief, she had left him with Madame Gras, intending to fetch him in the\r\nafternoon to see his uncle and aunt.\r\n\r\nHowever, the hearse had still not arrived, and Denise, greatly\r\naffected, stood watching the candles burn, when she was startled by a\r\nwell-known voice behind her. It was that of Bourras who had called a\r\nchestnut-seller occupying a little box, against a wine shop opposite,\r\nin order to say to him: "Here! Vigouroux, just keep a look-out on my\r\nplace, will you? You see I\'ve taken the door handle away. If any one\r\ncomes, tell them to call again. But don\'t let that disturb you, no one\r\nwill come."\r\n\r\nThen he also took his stand at the edge of the pavement, waiting like\r\nthe others. Denise, feeling rather awkward, glanced at his shop. He\r\nnow altogether neglected it; only a disorderly collection of umbrellas\r\neaten up by damp and canes blackened by gas-light now remained in the\r\nwindow. The embellishments that he had made, the light green paint\r\nwork, the mirrors, the gilded sign, were all cracking, already getting\r\ndirty, exhibiting the rapid lamentable decrepitude of false luxury\r\nlaid over ruins. But although the old crevices were re-appearing,\r\nalthough the damp spots had sprung up through the gilding, the house\r\nstill obstinately held its ground, hanging to the flanks of The Ladies\'\r\nParadise like some shameful wart, which, although cracked and rotten,\r\nyet refused to fall.\r\n\r\n"Ah! the scoundrels," growled Bourras, "they won\'t even let her be\r\ncarried away!"\r\n\r\nThe hearse, which was at last approaching, had just come into collision\r\nwith one of The Paradise vans, which at the rapid trot of two superb\r\nhorses went spinning along shedding in the mist the starry radiance of\r\nits shining panels. And from under his bushy eyebrows the old man cast\r\na side glance at Denise.\r\n\r\nThe funeral procession started at a slow pace, splashing through\r\nmuddy puddles, amid the silence of the omnibuses and cabs which were\r\nsuddenly pulled up. When the coffin, draped with white, crossed the\r\nPlace Gaillon, the sombre looks of the followers once more plunged\r\ninto the windows of the big establishment where only two saleswomen\r\nstood looking on, pleased with the diversion. Baudu followed the\r\nhearse with a heavy mechanical step, refusing by a sign the arm\r\noffered him by Jean, who walked alongside. Then, after a long string\r\nof people, came three mourning coaches. As they crossed the Rue\r\nNeuve-des-Petits-Champs, Robineau, looking very pale and much older,\r\nran up to join the procession.\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Roch, a great many women were waiting, small traders of the\r\nneighbourhood, who had wished to escape the crowd at the house of\r\nmourning. The demonstration was developing into quite a riot; and\r\nwhen, after the funeral service, the procession started off again,\r\nall continued to follow, although it was a long walk from the Rue\r\nSaint-Honor\xc3\xa9 to the Montmartre Cemetery. They had to turn up the Rue\r\nSaint-Roch again, and once more pass The Ladies\' Paradise. It was a\r\nsort of defiance; the poor girl\'s body was paraded round the big shop\r\nlike that of a first victim fallen in time of revolution. At the door\r\nsome red flannels were flapping like so many flags, and a display\r\nof carpets blazed forth in a gory efflorescence of huge roses and\r\nfull-blown peonies. Denise had now got into one of the coaches, being\r\nagitated by such poignant doubts, her heart oppressed by such cruel\r\ngrief, that she had not the strength to walk further. In the Rue du\r\nDix-D\xc3\xa9cembre just before the scaffolding of the new fa\xc3\xa7ade which still\r\nobstructed the thoroughfare there was a stoppage, and on looking out\r\nthe girl observed old Bourras behind all the others, dragging himself\r\nalong with difficulty close to the wheels of the coach in which she was\r\nriding alone. He would never get as far as the cemetery, she thought.\r\nHowever, he raised his head, looked at her, and all at once got into\r\nthe coach.\r\n\r\n"It\'s my confounded knees," he exclaimed. "Don\'t draw back! It isn\'t\r\nyou we hate."\r\n\r\nShe felt him to be friendly and furious, as in former days. He\r\ngrumbled, declared that Baudu must be fearfully strong to be able to\r\nkeep up after such hard blows as he had received. The procession had\r\nagain started off at the same slow pace; and, on leaning out once\r\nmore, Denise saw her uncle walking behind the hearse with his heavy\r\nstep, which seemed to regulate the rumbling, painful march of the\r\ncort\xc3\xa8ge. Then she threw herself back into her corner and rocked by\r\nthe melancholy movement of the coach began listening to the endless\r\ncomplaints of the old umbrella maker.\r\n\r\n"The police ought to clear the public thoroughfares, my word!" said he,\r\n"They\'ve been blocking up our street for the last eighteen months with\r\nthe scaffolding of their fa\xc3\xa7ade--another man was killed on it the other\r\nday. Never mind! When they want to enlarge any further they\'ll have to\r\nthrow bridges over the streets. People say there are now two thousand\r\nseven hundred employees, and that the turnover will amount to a hundred\r\nmillions this year. A hundred millions! just fancy! a hundred millions!"\r\n\r\nDenise had nothing to say in reply. The procession had just turned\r\ninto the Rue de la Chauss\xc3\xa9e d\'Antin, where it was stopped by a block\r\nof vehicles. And Bourras went on, with a vague expression in his eyes,\r\nas if he were now dreaming aloud. He still failed to understand the\r\ntriumph achieved by The Ladies\' Paradise, but he acknowledged the\r\ndefeat of the old-fashioned traders.\r\n\r\n"Poor Robineau\'s done for, he looks like a drowning man," he resumed.\r\n"And the B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9s and the Vanpouilles, they can\'t keep going; they\'re\r\nlike me, played out. Desligni\xc3\xa8res will die of apoplexy, Piot and\r\nRivoire have had the jaundice. Ah! poor child! It must be comical for\r\nthose looking on to see such a string of bankrupts pass. Besides, it\r\nappears that the clean sweep is to continue. Those scoundrels are\r\ncreating departments for flowers, bonnets, perfumery, boots and shoes,\r\nall sorts of things. Grognet, the perfumer in the Rue de Grammont can\r\nclear out, and I wouldn\'t give ten francs for Naud\'s boot-shop in the\r\nRue d\'Antin. The cholera\'s even spread as far as the Rue Sainte-Anne.\r\nLacassagne, at the feather and flower shop, and Madame Chadeuil, whose\r\nbonnets are so well-known, will be swept away in less than a couple\r\nof years. And after those will come others and still others! All the\r\nbusinesses in the neighbourhood will collapse. When counter-jumpers\r\nstart selling soap and goloshes, they are quite capable of dealing in\r\nfried potatoes. \'Pon my word, the world is turning upside down!"\r\n\r\nThe hearse had just then crossed the Place de la Trinit\xc3\xa9, and from the\r\ncorner of the gloomy coach Denise, who lulled by the funereal march\r\nof the procession still listened to the old man\'s endless complaints,\r\ncould see the coffin ascending the steep Rue Blanche as they emerged\r\nfrom the Rue de la Chauss\xc3\xa9e d\'Antin. Behind her uncle, who was plodding\r\nalong with the blind, mute face of an ox about to be poleaxed, she\r\nseemed to hear the tramping of a flock of sheep likewise being led to\r\nthe slaughter-house. It was the downfall of the shops of an entire\r\ndistrict, all the small traders dragging their ruin, amidst the thud\r\nof damp shoes, through the black mud of Paris. Bourras, however, still\r\ncontinued, in a fainter voice, as if fatigued by the difficult ascent\r\nof the Rue Blanche:\r\n\r\n"As for me, I\'m settled. But I still hold on all the same, and won\'t\r\nlet him go. He\'s just lost his appeal case. Ah! that\'s cost me\r\nsomething: nearly two years\' pleading, and the solicitors and the\r\nbarristers! Never mind, he won\'t pass under my shop, the judges have\r\ndecided that such work as that could not be considered legitimate\r\nrepairing. Just fancy, he talked of creating underneath my place a\r\nsaloon where his people might judge the colours of the stuffs by\r\ngas-light, a subterranean room which would have joined the hosiery to\r\nthe drapery departments! And he can\'t get over it; he can\'t swallow the\r\nfact that an old wreck like me should stop his progress, when all the\r\nothers are on their knees before his money. But never! I won\'t have\r\nit! that\'s understood. Very likely I may be worsted. Since I have had\r\nto fight against the process-servers, I know that the villain has been\r\nbuying up my bills in the hope of playing me some villainous trick. But\r\nthat doesn\'t matter; he says \'yes,\' and I say \'no,\' and I shall still\r\nsay \'no\' even when I get between two boards like that poor child we are\r\nfollowing."\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the Boulevard de Clichy, the coach rolled on at a\r\nquicker pace and one could hear the heavy breathing, the unconscious\r\nhaste of the followers, anxious to get the sad ceremony over. What\r\nBourras did not openly mention, was the frightful misery into which he\r\nhimself had fallen, bewildered by the worries which besiege the small\r\ntrader who is on the road to ruin and yet remains obstinate even under\r\na shower of protested bills. Denise, well acquainted with his position,\r\nat last broke the silence by saying, in a voice of entreaty:\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t stand out any longer, Monsieur Bourras. Let me arrange\r\nmatters for you."\r\n\r\nBut he interrupted her with a violent gesture. "You be quiet. That\'s\r\nnobody\'s business. You\'re a good little girl, and I know you lead him a\r\nhard life, that man who thought you were for sale just like my house.\r\nBut what would you answer if I advised you to say \'yes?\' You\'d send me\r\nabout my business, eh? And so, when I say \'no,\' don\'t you interfere in\r\nthe matter."\r\n\r\nThen, the coach having stopped at the cemetery gate, he alighted from\r\nit with the young girl. The Baudus\' vault was reached by the first\r\npath on the left. In a few minutes the ceremony was over. Jean drew\r\naway his uncle, who was looking into the grave all agape. The mourners\r\nspread about amongst the neighbouring tombs, and the faces of all these\r\nshopkeepers, their blood impoverished by living in damp, unhealthy\r\nshops, assumed an ugly, suffering look under the leaden sky. When the\r\ncoffin gently slipped down, their blotched and pimpled cheeks paled,\r\nand their bleared eyes, blinded by the constant contemplation of\r\nfigures, turned away.\r\n\r\n"We ought all to jump into that hole," said Bourras to Denise, who had\r\nkept close to him. "In burying that poor girl they\'re burying the whole\r\ndistrict. Oh! I know what I say, the old style of business may go and\r\njoin the white roses they\'re throwing on her coffin."\r\n\r\nDenise brought her uncle and brother back in a mourning coach. The day\r\nwas for her dark and melancholy. In the first place, she began to get\r\nanxious at seeing Jean so pale; and when she understood that it was\r\non account of another sweetheart she tried to quiet him by opening\r\nher purse; but he shook his head and refused, saying it was a serious\r\nmatter this time, the niece of a very rich pastry-cook, who would not\r\naccept even a bunch of violets. Afterwards, in the afternoon, when\r\nDenise went to fetch P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 from Madame Gras\', the latter declared that\r\nhe was getting too big for her to keep any longer; and this was another\r\nannoyance, for it would be necessary to find him a school, perhaps\r\nsend him away. And to crown all, on bringing P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 to kiss his aunt and\r\nuncle, Denise\'s heart was rent by the gloomy sadness of The Old Elbeuf.\r\nThe shop was closed, and the old couple were sitting in the little\r\ndining-room, where they had forgotten to light the gas, notwithstanding\r\nthe complete obscurity in which it was plunged that winter\'s day. They\r\nwere now quite alone, face to face, in the house which ruin had slowly\r\nemptied, and their daughter\'s death filled the dark corners with a\r\ndeeper gloom, and seemed like the beginning of that final dismemberment\r\nwhich would break up the old rafters, preyed upon by damp. Beneath the\r\ncrushing blow, her uncle, unable to stop himself, still kept walking\r\nround and round the table, with his funeral-like step, seeing nothing\r\nand silent; whilst her aunt who said nothing either, remained huddled\r\ntogether on a chair, with the white face of one who is wounded and\r\nwhose blood is running away drop by drop. They did not even weep when\r\nP\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 covered their cold cheeks with kisses. For her part Denise was\r\nchoking with tears.\r\n\r\nThat same evening Mouret sent for the young woman to speak to her about\r\na child\'s garment which he wished to launch, a mixture of the Scotch\r\nand Zouave costumes. And, still trembling with pity, shocked by so much\r\nsuffering, she could not contain herself; and, to begin with, ventured\r\nto speak of Bourras, that poor old man who was down and whom they were\r\nabout to ruin. But, on hearing the umbrella maker\'s name, Mouret flew\r\ninto a rage. The old madman, as he called him, was the plague of his\r\nlife, and spoilt his triumph by his idiotic obstinacy in not giving\r\nup his house, that ignoble hovel which was a disgrace to The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, the only little corner of the vast block that had escaped\r\nconquest. The matter was becoming a perfect nightmare; any one else\r\nbut Denise speaking in favour of Bourras would have run the risk of\r\nimmediate dismissal, so violently was Mouret tortured by the sickly\r\ndesire to kick the old hovel down. In short, what did they wish him to\r\ndo? Could he leave that heap of ruins sticking to The Ladies\' Paradise?\r\nIt would have to go, the shop must pass along. So much the worse for\r\nthe old fool! And he spoke of his repeated proposals; he had offered\r\nhim as much as a hundred thousand francs. Wasn\'t that fair? He never\r\nhiggled, he gave whatever money was required; but in return he expected\r\npeople to be reasonable, and allow him to finish his work! Did any one\r\never try to stop engines on a railway? To all this Denise listened with\r\ndrooping eyes, unable on her side to find any but purely sentimental\r\nreasons. The poor fellow was so old, they might have waited till his\r\ndeath; a bankruptcy would kill him. Then Mouret added that he was no\r\nlonger able to prevent things following their course. Bourdoncle had\r\ntaken the matter up, for the board had resolved to put an end to it. So\r\nshe could say nothing more, notwithstanding the grievous pity which she\r\nfelt for her old friend.\r\n\r\nAfter a painful silence, Mouret himself began to speak of the Baudus,\r\nby expressing his sorrow at the death of their daughter. They were very\r\nworthy and very honest people but had been pursued by the worst of\r\nluck. Then he resumed his arguments: at bottom, they had really brought\r\nabout their own misfortunes by obstinately clinging to the old customs\r\nin their worm-eaten place. It was not astonishing that their house\r\nshould be falling about their heads. He had predicted it scores of\r\ntimes; she must even remember that he had told her to warn her uncle of\r\na fatal disaster, if he should still cling to his stupid old-fashioned\r\nways. And the catastrophe had arrived; no one in the world could now\r\nprevent it. People could not reasonably expect him to ruin himself to\r\nsave the neighbourhood. Besides, if he had been foolish enough to close\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise, another great establishment would have sprung\r\nup of itself next door, for the idea was now starting from the four\r\ncorners of the globe; the triumph of these manufacturing and trading\r\ncentres was sown by the spirit of the age, which was sweeping away\r\nthe falling edifices of ancient times. Little by little as he went on\r\nspeaking, Mouret warmed up, and with eloquent emotion defended himself\r\nagainst the hatred of his involuntary victims, against the clamour\r\nof the small moribund businesses that he could hear around him. They\r\ncould not keep their dead above ground, he continued, they must bury\r\nthem; and, with a gesture, he consigned the corpse of old-fashioned\r\ntrading to the grave, swept into the common hole all those putrifying\r\npestilential remains which were becoming a disgrace to the bright,\r\nsun-lit streets of new Paris. No, no, he felt no remorse, he was simply\r\ndoing the work of his age, and she knew it, she who loved life, who had\r\na passion for vast transactions settled in the full glare of publicity.\r\nReduced to silence, she listened to him for some time longer and then\r\nwent away, her soul full of trouble.\r\n\r\nThat night Denise slept but little. Insomnia, interspersed with\r\nnightmare, kept her turning over and over in her bed. It seemed to\r\nher that she was again quite a little girl and burst into tears, in\r\ntheir garden at Valognes, on seeing the blackcaps eat up the spiders,\r\nwhich themselves devoured the flies. Was it then really true that it\r\nwas necessary for the world to fatten on death, that it was necessary\r\nthere should be this struggle for existence whereby humanity drew\r\neven increase of life from the ossuaries of eternal destruction? And\r\nafterwards she again found herself before the grave into which they had\r\nlowered Genevi\xc3\xa8ve, and then she perceived her uncle and aunt alone in\r\ntheir gloomy dining-room. A dull sound as of something toppling sped\r\nthrough the still atmosphere; it was Bourras\'s house giving way, as\r\nif undermined by a high tide. Then silence fell again, more sinister\r\nthan ever, and a fresh crash was heard, then another, and another; the\r\nRobineaus, the B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9s, the Vanpouilles, were cracking and falling\r\nin their turn; all the small shops of the Saint-Roch quarter were\r\ndisappearing beneath an invisible pick, with the sudden, thundering\r\nnoise of bricks falling from a cart. Then intense grief awoke her with\r\na start. Heavens! what tortures! There were families weeping, old men\r\nthrown into the street, all the poignant dramas of ruin! And she could\r\nsave nobody; and even felt that it was right, that all this compost of\r\nmisery was necessary for the health of the Paris of the future. When\r\nday broke, she became calmer, but a feeling of resigned sadness still\r\nkept her awake, turned towards the window whose panes were brightening.\r\nYes, it was the needful meed of blood, every revolution required\r\nmartyrs, each step forward is taken over the bodies of the dead. Her\r\nfear of being a wicked girl, of having helped to effect the ruin of her\r\nkindred, now melted into heartfelt pity, in face of these evils beyond\r\nremedy, which are like the labour pangs of each generation\'s birth. She\r\nfinished by trying to devise some possible comfort, her kindly heart\r\ndreaming of the means to be employed in order to save her relations at\r\nleast from the final crash.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mouret appeared before her with his impassioned face and\r\ncaressing eyes. He would certainly refuse her nothing; she felt sure\r\nthat he would accord all reasonable compensations. And her thoughts\r\nstrayed, seeking to judge him. She knew his life and was aware of\r\nthe calculating nature of his former affections, his continual\r\n"exploitation" of woman, his intimacy with Madame Desforges--the sole\r\nobject of which had been to get hold of Baron Hartmann--and with\r\nall the others, such as Clara and the rest. But these Lothario-like\r\nbeginnings, which were the talk of the shop, gradually disappeared in\r\npresence of the man\'s genius and victorious grace. He was seduction\r\nitself. What she could never have forgiven was his former deception:\r\nreal coldness hidden beneath a gallant affectation of affection.\r\nBut she felt herself to be entirely without rancour now that he was\r\nsuffering through her. This suffering had elevated him. When she saw\r\nhim tortured by her refusal, atoning so fully for his former disdain\r\nfor woman, he seemed to her to make amends for many of his faults.\r\n\r\nThat very morning Denise obtained from Mouret a promise of whatever\r\ncompensation she might consider reasonable on the day when the Baudus\r\nand old Bourras should succumb. Weeks passed away, during which she\r\nwent to see her uncle nearly every afternoon, escaping from her\r\ndepartment for a few minutes and bringing her smiling face and girlish\r\ncourage to enliven the dark shop. She was especially anxious about her\r\naunt, who had fallen into a dull stupor ever since Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\'s death;\r\nit seemed as if her life was quitting her hourly; though, when people\r\nquestioned her, she would reply with an astonished air that she was not\r\nsuffering, but simply felt as if overcome by sleep. The neighbours,\r\nhowever, shook their heads, saying she would not live long to regret\r\nher daughter.\r\n\r\nOne day Denise was coming from the Baudus, when, on turning the corner\r\nof the Place Gaillon, she heard a loud cry. A crowd rushed forward, a\r\npanic arose: that breath of fear and pity which suddenly brings all the\r\npeople in a street together. It was a brown omnibus, belonging to the\r\nBastille-Batignolles line, which had run over a man, at the entrance\r\nof the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin, just opposite the fountain. Standing\r\nup in his seat, the driver whilst furiously holding in his two black\r\nhorses which were rearing cried out, in a great passion:\r\n\r\n"Confound it! Confound it! Why don\'t you look out, you idiot!"\r\n\r\nThe omnibus had now been brought to a standstill. The crowd had\r\nsurrounded the injured man, and a policeman happened to be on the\r\nspot. Still standing up and invoking the testimony of the outside\r\npassengers who had also risen, to look over and see the blood-stains,\r\nthe coachman, with exasperated gestures and choked by increasing anger,\r\nwas explaining the matter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s something fearful," said he. "Who could have expected such a\r\nthing? That fellow was walking along quite at home and when I called\r\nout to him he at once threw himself under the wheels!"\r\n\r\nThen a house-painter, who had run up, brush in hand, from a\r\nneighbouring shop-front, exclaimed in a sharp voice, amidst the\r\nclamour: "Don\'t excite yourself! I saw him, he threw himself under! He\r\njumped in, head first, like that. Another one tired of life, no doubt!"\r\n\r\nOthers spoke up, and all agreed that it was a case of suicide, whilst\r\nthe policeman pulled out his note-book and made an entry. Several\r\nladies, all very pale, quickly alighted and ran away without looking\r\nback, filled with horror by the sudden shaking which had stirred them\r\nwhen the omnibus passed over the body. Denise, however, drew nearer,\r\nattracted by a practical pity, which prompted her to interest herself\r\nin the victims of all sorts of street accidents, such as wounded\r\ndogs, horses down, and tilers falling off roofs. And she immediately\r\nrecognised the unfortunate fellow who had fainted away there in the\r\nroad, his clothes covered with mud.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Monsieur Robineau!" she exclaimed, in her grievous astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe policeman at once questioned the young woman, and she gave the\r\nvictim\'s name, profession, and address. Thanks to the driver\'s energy,\r\nthe omnibus had swerved, and thus only Robineau\'s legs had gone under\r\nthe wheels; however, it was to be feared that they were both broken.\r\nFour men carried him to a chemist\'s shop in the Rue Gaillon, whilst the\r\nomnibus slowly resumed its journey.\r\n\r\n"My stars!" said the driver, whipping up his horses, "I\'ve done a\r\nfamous day\'s work."\r\n\r\nDenise followed Robineau into the chemist\'s. The latter, pending the\r\narrival of a doctor who was not to be found, declared that there was\r\nno immediate danger, and that the injured man had better be taken\r\nhome, as he lived in the neighbourhood. A man then started off to the\r\npolice-station for a stretcher, and Denise had the happy thought of\r\ngoing on in front so as to prepare Madame Robineau for this frightful\r\nblow. But she had the greatest trouble in the world to get into the\r\nstreet again through the crowd, which was struggling before the door of\r\nthe chemist\'s shop. This crowd, attracted by death, was every minute\r\nincreasing; men, women, and children stood on tip-toe, and held their\r\nown amidst brutal pushing; and each new-comer had his version to give\r\nof the accident, so that at last the victim was said to be a husband\r\nwho had been pitched out of window by his wife\'s lover.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs, Denise perceived, from a distance,\r\nMadame Robineau on the threshold of the silk warehouse. This gave her\r\na pretext for stopping, and she talked on for a moment, trying to find\r\na means of breaking the terrible news. The place wore the disorderly,\r\nneglectful aspect of a shop in the last agony, one whose business is\r\nfast dying. It was the inevitable end of the great battle of the rival\r\nsilks; the Paris Delight had destroyed competition by a fresh reduction\r\nof a sou; it was now sold at four francs nineteen sous the m\xc3\xaatre,\r\nand Gaujean\'s silk had found its Waterloo. For the last two months\r\nRobineau, reduced to all sorts of shifts, had been leading a fearful\r\nlife, trying to avert a declaration of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n"I saw your husband crossing the Place Gaillon," murmured Denise, who\r\nhad ended by entering the shop.\r\n\r\nThereupon Madame Robineau, whom a secret anxiety seemed to be\r\ncontinually attracting towards the street, said quickly: "Ah, a little\r\nwhile ago, wasn\'t it? I\'m waiting for him, he ought to be back by now.\r\nMonsieur Gaujean came this morning, and they went out together."\r\n\r\nShe was still charming, delicate, and gay; but was in a delicate state\r\nof health and seemed more frightened, more bewildered than ever by\r\nthose dreadful business matters, which she did not understand, and\r\nwhich were all going wrong. As she often said, what was the use of it\r\nall? Would it not be better to live quietly in some small lodging, and\r\nbe contented with modest fare?\r\n\r\n"My dear child," she resumed with her pretty smile, which was becoming\r\nsadder, "we have nothing to conceal from you. Things are not going\r\nwell, and my poor darling is worried to death. Again to-day this man\r\nGaujean has been tormenting him about some overdue bills. I was dying\r\nwith anxiety at being left here all alone."\r\n\r\nAnd she was once more returning to the door when Denise stopped her,\r\nhaving heard the noise of a crowd and guessing that it was the injured\r\nman being brought along, surrounded by a mob of idlers anxious to see\r\nthe end of the affair. And thereupon with her throat parched, unable\r\nto find the consoling words she would have liked to say, she had to\r\nexplain the matter.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be anxious, there\'s no immediate danger. I\'ve seen Monsieur\r\nRobineau, he has met with an accident. They are just bringing him home,\r\npray don\'t be frightened."\r\n\r\nThe young woman listened to her, white as a sheet, and as yet not\r\nclearly understanding her. The street was full of people, and\r\ncab-drivers, unable to get along, were swearing, while the bearers set\r\nthe stretcher before the shop in order to open both glass doors.\r\n\r\n"It was an accident," continued Denise, determined to conceal the\r\nattempt at suicide. "He was on the pavement and slipped under the\r\nwheels of an omnibus. Only his feet are hurt. They\'ve sent for a\r\ndoctor. Don\'t be frightened."\r\n\r\nA great shudder shook Madame Robineau. She gave vent to a few\r\ninarticulate cries; then said no more but sank down beside the\r\nstretcher, drawing its covering aside with her trembling hands. The men\r\nwho had brought it were waiting to take it away as soon as the doctor\r\nshould arrive. They dared not touch Robineau, who had now regained\r\nconsciousness, and whose sufferings became frightful at the slightest\r\nmovement. When he saw his wife big tears ran down his cheeks. She\r\nembraced him, and stood looking at him fixedly, and weeping. Out in\r\nthe street the tumult was increasing; the people pressed forward as\r\nwith glistening eyes at a theatre; some girls, fresh from a workshop,\r\nwere almost pushing through the windows in their eagerness to see what\r\nwas going on. Then Denise in order to avoid this feverish curiosity,\r\nand thinking, moreover, that it was not right to leave the shop open,\r\ndecided to let the metal shutters down. She went and turned the winch,\r\nwhose wheels gave out a plaintive cry whilst the sheets of iron slowly\r\ndescended, like the heavy draperies of a curtain falling on the\r\ncatastrophe of a fifth act. And when she went in again, after closing\r\nthe little round door in the shutters, she found Madame Robineau still\r\nclasping her husband in her arms, in the vague half-light which came\r\nfrom the two stars cut in the sheet-iron. The ruined shop seemed to\r\nbe gliding into nothingness, those two stars alone glittered on this\r\nsudden and brutal catastrophe of the streets of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt last Madame Robineau recovered her speech. "Oh, my darling!--oh, my\r\ndarling! my darling!"\r\n\r\nThis was all she could say, and he, half choking, confessed himself, a\r\nprey to keen remorse now that he saw her kneeling thus before him. When\r\nhe did not move he only felt the burning weight of his legs.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, I must have been mad. But when the lawyer told me before\r\nGaujean that the posters would be put up to-morrow, I saw flames\r\ndancing before my eyes as if the walls were on fire. After that I\r\nremember nothing. I was coming down the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re--and I\r\nfancied that The Paradise people were laughing at me--that big rascally\r\nhouse seemed to crush me--so, when the omnibus came up, I thought of\r\nLhomme and his arm, and threw myself under the wheels."\r\n\r\nMadame Robineau had slowly fallen on to the floor, horrified by this\r\nconfession. Heavens! he had tried to kill himself. She caught hold of\r\nthe hand of Denise who was leaning towards her, also quite overcome.\r\nThe injured man, exhausted by emotion, had just fainted away again.\r\nThe doctor had still not arrived. Two men had been scouring the\r\nneighbourhood for him; and the doorkeeper belonging to the house had\r\nnow gone to seek him in his turn.\r\n\r\n"Pray, don\'t be anxious," Denise kept on repeating mechanically,\r\nherself also sobbing.\r\n\r\nThen Madame Robineau, seated on the floor, with her head on a level\r\nwith the stretcher, her cheek resting against the sacking on which\r\nher husband was lying, relieved her heart. "Oh! I must tell you.\r\nIt\'s all for me that he wanted to die. He\'s always saying, \'I\'ve\r\nrobbed you; it was your money.\' And at night he dreamed of those\r\nsixty thousand francs, waking up covered with perspiration, calling\r\nhimself an incompetent fellow and saying that those who have no head\r\nfor business ought not to risk other people\'s money. You know that\r\nhe has always been nervous, and apt to worry himself. He finished by\r\nconjuring up things that frightened me. He pictured me in the street\r\nin tatters, begging--me whom he loved so dearly, whom he longed to see\r\nrich and happy." The poor woman paused; on turning her head she saw\r\nthat her husband had opened his eyes; then she continued stammering:\r\n"My darling, why have you done this? You must think me very wicked! I\r\nassure you, I don\'t care if we are ruined. So long as we are together,\r\nwe shall never be unhappy. Let them take everything, and we will go\r\naway somewhere, where you won\'t hear any more about them. You can still\r\nwork; you\'ll see how happy we shall be!"\r\n\r\nShe let her forehead fall near her husband\'s pale face, and both\r\nremained speechless, in the emotion of their anguish. Silence fell.\r\nThe shop seemed to be sleeping, benumbed by the pale twilight which\r\nenveloped it; whilst from behind the thin metal shutters came the\r\nuproar of the street, the life of broad daylight passing along with\r\nthe rumbling of vehicles, and the hustling and pushing of the crowd.\r\nAt last Denise, who went every other minute to glance through the door\r\nleading to the hall of the house came back: "Here\'s the doctor!"\r\n\r\nIt was a young fellow with bright eyes, whom the doorkeeper had found\r\nand brought in. He preferred to examine the injured man before they\r\nput him to bed. Only one of his legs, the left one, was broken above\r\nthe ankle; it was a simple fracture, no serious complication appeared\r\nlikely to result from it. And they were about to carry the stretcher\r\ninto the back-room when Gaujean arrived. He came to give them an\r\naccount of a last attempt to settle matters, an attempt moreover which\r\nhad failed; the declaration of bankruptcy was unavoidable.\r\n\r\n"Dear me," murmured he, "what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nIn a few words, Denise informed him. Then he stopped, feeling awkward,\r\nwhile Robineau said, in a feeble voice: "I don\'t bear you any ill-will,\r\nbut all this is partly your fault."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear fellow," replied Gaujean, "it wanted stronger men than\r\nourselves. You know I\'m not in a much better position than you are."\r\n\r\nThey raised the stretcher; Robineau still found strength to say: "No,\r\nno, stronger fellows than us would have given way as we have. I can\r\nunderstand such obstinate old men as Bourras and Baudu standing out;\r\nbut for you and I, who are young, who had accepted the new style of\r\nthings, it was wrong! No, Gaujean, it\'s the last of a world."\r\n\r\nThey carried him off. Madame Robineau embraced Denise with an eagerness\r\nin which there was almost a feeling of joy at having at last got rid\r\nof all those worrying business matters. And, as Gaujean went away with\r\nthe young girl, he confessed to her that Robineau, poor devil, was\r\nright. It was idiotic to try to struggle against The Ladies\' Paradise.\r\nPersonally he felt he would be lost, if he did not get back into its\r\ngood graces. The night before, in fact, he had secretly made a proposal\r\nto Hutin, who was just leaving for Lyons. But he felt very doubtful,\r\nand tried to interest Denise in the matter, aware, no doubt, of her\r\npowerful influence.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," said he, "so much the worse for the manufacturers!\r\nEvery one would laugh at me if I ruined myself in fighting for\r\nother people\'s benefit, when those fellows are struggling as to who\r\nshall make at the cheapest price! As you said some time ago, the\r\nmanufacturers have only to follow the march of progress by a better\r\norganization and new methods. Everything will come all right; it is\r\nsufficient that the public are satisfied."\r\n\r\nDenise smiled and replied: "Go and tell that to Monsieur Mouret\r\nhimself. Your visit will please him, and he\'s not the man to display\r\nany rancour, if you offer him even a centime profit per yard."\r\n\r\nMadame Baudu died one bright sunny afternoon in January. For a\r\nfortnight she had been unable to go down into the shop which a\r\ncharwoman now looked after. She sat in the centre of her bed, propped\r\nup by some pillows. Nothing but her eyes seemed to be alive in her\r\nwhite face; and with head erect, she obstinately gazed upon The Ladies\'\r\nParadise opposite, through the small curtains of the windows. Baudu,\r\nhimself suffering from the same obsession, from the despairing fixity\r\nof her gaze, sometimes wanted to draw the larger curtains. But she\r\nstopped him with an imploring gesture, obstinately desirous of looking\r\nand looking till the last moment should come. The monster had now\r\nrobbed her of everything, her business, her daughter; she herself had\r\ngradually died away with The Old Elbeuf, losing some part of her life\r\nas the shop lost its customers; the day it succumbed, she had no more\r\nbreath left. When she felt she was dying, she still found strength to\r\ninsist on her husband opening both windows. It was very mild, a bright\r\nray of sunshine gilded The Ladies\' Paradise, whilst the bed-room of\r\nthe old house shivered in the shade. Madame Baudu lay there with eyes\r\nfixed, full of that vision of the triumphal monument, those clear,\r\nlimpid windows, behind which a gallop of millions was passing. But\r\nslowly her eyes grew dim, invaded by darkness; and when their last\r\ngleam had expired in death, they remained wide open, still gazing, and\r\nwet with tears.\r\n\r\nOnce more all the ruined traders of the district followed the funeral\r\nprocession. There were the brothers Vanpouille, pale at the thought of\r\ntheir December bills, met by a supreme effort which they would never\r\nbe able to repeat. B\xc3\xa9dor\xc3\xa9, accompanying his sister, leant on his cane,\r\nso full of worry and anxiety that his liver complaint was getting\r\nworse every day. Desligni\xc3\xa8res had had a fit, Piot and Rivoire walked\r\non in silence, with downcast looks, like men entirely played out. And\r\nthey dared not question each other about those who had disappeared,\r\nQuinette, Mademoiselle Tatin, and others, who, in the space of a day,\r\nsank, ruined, swept away by the flood of disasters: without counting\r\nRobineau, still in bed, with his broken leg. But they pointed with an\r\nespecial air of interest to the new tradesmen attacked by the plague:\r\nGrognet the perfumer, Madame Chadeuil the milliner, Lacassagne the\r\nflower-maker, and Naud the boot-maker who were still on their legs, but\r\nfull of anxiety at thought of the evil which would doubtless sweep them\r\naway in their turn. Baudu walked behind the hearse with the same heavy,\r\nstolid step as when he had followed his daughter; whilst in the first\r\nmourning coach could be seen Bourras\'s eyes sparkling under his bushy\r\neyebrows and hair of a snowy whiteness.\r\n\r\nDenise was in great trouble. For the last fortnight she had been\r\nworn out with fatigue and anxiety; she had been obliged to put P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\r\nto school, and had been running about on account of Jean, who was so\r\nstricken with the pastrycook\'s niece, that he had implored his sister\r\nto go and ask her hand in marriage. Then her aunt\'s death, this fresh\r\ncatastrophe, had quite overwhelmed the young girl, though Mouret had\r\nagain offered his services, giving her leave to do what she liked for\r\nher uncle and the others. One morning she had yet another interview\r\nwith him, at the news that Bourras had been turned into the street, and\r\nthat Baudu was going to shut up shop. Then, she went out after lunch in\r\nthe hope of at least comforting these two.\r\n\r\nIn the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, Bourras was standing on the foot pavement\r\nopposite his house, whence he had been evicted on the previous day\r\nby a fine trick, a discovery of the lawyers. As Mouret held several\r\nbills, he had easily obtained an order in bankruptcy against the\r\numbrella-maker and then had given five hundred francs for the expiring\r\nlease at the sale ordered by the court; so that the obstinate old man\r\nhad for five hundred francs allowed himself to be deprived of what he\r\nhad refused to surrender for a hundred thousand. The architect, who\r\ncame with his gang of workmen, had been obliged to employ the police\r\nto get him out. The goods had been taken and sold, the rooms cleared;\r\nhowever, he still obstinately remained in the corner where he slept,\r\nand from which out of pity they did not like to drive him. The workmen\r\neven attacked the roofing over his head. They took off the rotten\r\nslates, the ceilings fell in and the walls cracked, and yet he remained\r\nthere, under the bare old beams, amidst the ruins. At last when the\r\npolice came, he went away. But on the following morning he again\r\nappeared on the opposite side of the street, after passing the night in\r\na lodging-house of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Bourras!" said Denise, kindly.\r\n\r\nHe did not hear her for his flaming eyes were devouring the workmen who\r\nwere attacking the front of the hovel with their picks. Through the\r\nglassless windows you could see the inside of the house, the wretched\r\nrooms, and the black staircase, to which the sun had not penetrated for\r\nthe last two hundred years.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s you," he replied at last, when he recognised her. "A nice bit\r\nof work they\'re doing, eh? the robbers!"\r\n\r\nShe no longer dared to speak; her heart was stirred by the lamentable\r\nwretchedness of the old place; she was unable to take her eyes off the\r\nmouldy stones that were falling. Up above on a corner of the ceiling of\r\nher old room, she once more perceived that name--Ernestine--written in\r\nblack and shaky letters with the flame of a candle; and the remembrance\r\nof her days of misery came back to her, inspiring her with a tender\r\nsympathy for all suffering. However, the workmen, in order to knock\r\none of the walls down at a blow, had attacked it at its base. It was\r\nalready tottering.\r\n\r\n"If only it could crush them all," growled Bourras, in a savage voice.\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible cracking noise. The frightened workmen ran out\r\ninto the street. In falling, the wall shook and carried all the rest\r\nwith it. No doubt the hovel, with its flaws and cracks was ripe for\r\nthis downfall; a push had sufficed to cleave it from top to bottom. It\r\nwas a pitiful crumbling, the razing of a mud-house soddened by rain.\r\nNot a partition remained standing; on the ground there was nothing but\r\na heap of rubbish, the dung of the past cast, as it were, at the street\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n"My God!" the old man had exclaimed as if the blow had resounded in his\r\nvery entrails.\r\n\r\nHe stood there gaping; he would never have imagined that it would have\r\nbeen so quickly over. And he looked at the gap, the hollow at last\r\nyawning beside The Ladies\' Paradise, now freed of the wart which had\r\nso long disgraced it. The gnat was crushed; this was the final triumph\r\nover the galling obstinacy of the infinitely little; the whole block\r\nwas now invaded and conquered. Passers-by lingered to talk to the\r\nworkmen, who began crying out against those old buildings which were\r\nonly good for killing people.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Bourras," repeated Denise, trying to draw him on one side,\r\n"you know that you will not be abandoned. All your wants will be\r\nprovided for."\r\n\r\nHe raised his head. "I have no wants. You\'ve been sent by them, haven\'t\r\nyou? Well, tell them that old Bourras still knows how to use his hands\r\nand that he can find work wherever he likes. Really, it would be a fine\r\nthing to offer charity to those whom they assassinate!"\r\n\r\nThen she implored him: "Pray accept, Monsieur Bourras; don\'t cause me\r\nthis grief."\r\n\r\nBut he shook his bushy head. "No, no, it\'s all over. Good-bye. Go and\r\nlive happily, you who are young, and don\'t prevent old people from\r\nsticking to their ideas."\r\n\r\nHe cast a last glance at the heap of rubbish, and then went painfully\r\naway. She watched him disappear, elbowed by the crowd on the pavement.\r\nHe turned the corner of the Place Gaillon, and all was over.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Denise remained motionless, lost in thought. Then she\r\nwent over to her uncle\'s. The draper was alone in the dark shop of\r\nThe Old Elbeuf. The charwoman only came in the morning and evening to\r\ndo a little cooking, and help him take down and put up the shutters.\r\nHe spent hours in this solitude, often without being disturbed during\r\nthe whole day, and bewildered and unable to find the goods when a\r\nstray customer chanced to venture in. And there in the silence and the\r\nhalf-light he walked about unceasingly, with the same heavy step as\r\nat the two funerals; yielding to a sickly desire, to regular fits of\r\nforced marching, as if he were trying to rock his grief to sleep.\r\n\r\n"Are you feeling better, uncle?" asked Denise.\r\n\r\nHe only stopped for a second and then started off again, going from the\r\npay-desk to an obscure corner.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. Very well, thanks."\r\n\r\nShe tried to find some consoling subject, some cheerful remark, but\r\ncould think of nothing. "Did you hear the noise? The house is down."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s true," he murmured, with an astonished look, "that must have\r\nbeen the house. I felt the ground shake. Seeing them on the roof this\r\nmorning, I closed my door."\r\n\r\nThen he made a vague gesture, to intimate that such things no longer\r\ninterested him. Each time he arrived in front of the pay-desk, he\r\nlooked at the empty seat, that well-known velvet-covered seat, where\r\nhis wife and daughter had grown up. Then, when his perpetual walking\r\nbrought him to the other end, he gazed at the gloom-enveloped shelves,\r\non which a few pieces of cloth were growing more and more mouldy. It\r\nwas a widowed house; those he loved had disappeared; his business had\r\ncome to a shameful end; and he was left alone to commune with his\r\ndead heart and fallen pride, amidst all these catastrophes. He raised\r\nhis eyes to the black ceiling, he listened to the sepulchral silence\r\nwhich reigned in the little dining-room, that family nook which he had\r\nformerly loved so well, even to its stuffy odour. Not a breath was now\r\nheard in the old house, his regular heavy tread made the ancient walls\r\nresound, as if he were walking in the tomb of his affections.\r\n\r\nAt last Denise approached the subject which had brought her. "Uncle,"\r\nsaid she, "you can\'t stay like this. You must come to a decision."\r\n\r\nWithout stopping he replied: "No doubt; but what would you have me do?\r\nI\'ve tried to sell, but no one has come. One of these mornings, I shall\r\nshut up shop and go off."\r\n\r\nShe was aware that a failure was no longer to be feared. The creditors\r\nhad preferred to come to an understanding in presence of such a long\r\nseries of misfortunes. Everything paid, the old man would simply find\r\nhimself in the street, penniless.\r\n\r\n"But what will you do, then?" she murmured, seeking some transition in\r\norder to arrive at the offer which she dared not make.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he replied. "They\'ll pick me up all right." He had\r\nnow changed his route, going from the dining-room to the windows; and\r\nevery time he came to these windows he cast a mournful glance on the\r\nwretchedness of the old show-goods forgotten there. His eyes did not\r\neven turn towards the triumphal fa\xc3\xa7ade of The Ladies\' Paradise, whose\r\narchitectural lines ran right and left, to both ends of the street. He\r\nwas thoroughly annihilated, and had not even the strength left him to\r\nget angry.\r\n\r\n"Listen, uncle," said Denise at last, greatly embarrassed; "perhaps\r\nthere might be a situation for you." And after a pause she stammered,\r\n"Yes, I am charged to offer you a situation as inspector."\r\n\r\n"Where?" asked Baudu.\r\n\r\n"Why, over the road," she replied; "at our place. Six thousand francs a\r\nyear; a very easy berth."\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly in front of her. But instead of getting angry as\r\nshe feared he would, he turned very pale, succumbing to a grievous\r\nemotion, a feeling of bitter resignation.\r\n\r\n"Over the road, over the road," he stammered several times. "You want\r\nme to go there?"\r\n\r\nDenise herself was affected by his emotion. She recalled the long\r\nstruggle of the two shops, again saw herself at the funerals of\r\nGenevi\xc3\xa8ve and Madame Baudu, and beheld The Old Elbeuf overthrown,\r\nutterly ruined by The Ladies\' Paradise. And the idea of her uncle\r\ntaking a situation over the road, and walking about there in a white\r\nneck-tie, made her heart leap with pity and revolt.\r\n\r\n"Come, Denise, my girl, is it possible?" he asked simply, crossing his\r\npoor trembling hands.\r\n\r\n"No, no, uncle!" she exclaimed, in a sudden outburst of her just and\r\nexcellent nature. "It would be wrong. Forgive me, I beg of you."\r\n\r\nHe resumed his walk and again his step resounded amidst the funereal\r\nemptiness of the house. And, when she left him, he was still and ever\r\nmarching up and down, with the obstinate locomotion peculiar to great\r\ndespairs which turn and turn, unable to find an outlet.\r\n\r\nThat night also proved a sleepless one for Denise. She had discovered\r\nshe really was powerless. Even in favour of her own people she was\r\nunable to find any consolation or relief. She must to the bitter end\r\nremain a witness of the invincible work of life which requires death\r\nas its continual seed. She no longer struggled, she accepted this\r\nlaw of combat; still her womanly soul filled with tearful pity, with\r\nfraternal tenderness at the idea of humanity\'s sufferings. For years\r\npast she herself had been caught in the wheel-work of the machine. Had\r\nshe not bled in it? Had she not been bruised, dismissed, overwhelmed\r\nwith insults? Even now she was frightened, when she felt herself chosen\r\nby the logic of facts. Why should it be she, who was so puny? Why\r\nshould her small hand suddenly become so powerful amidst the monster\'s\r\nwork? And the force which swept everything away, carried her along in\r\nher turn, she, whose coming was to be revenge. It was Mouret who had\r\ninvented this world-crushing mechanism whose brutal working shocked\r\nher; he had strewn the neighbourhood with ruins, despoiled some, killed\r\nothers; and yet despite everything she loved him for the grandeur\r\nof his work, loved him still more at each fresh excess of power,\r\nnotwithstanding the flood of tears which overcame her in presence of\r\nthe hallowed wretchedness of the vanquished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, quite new with its chalk-white houses and the\r\nlast remaining scaffoldings of a few unfinished buildings, stretched\r\nout beneath a clear February sun; a stream of vehicles was passing at a\r\nconquering pace through this gap of light, intersecting the damp gloom\r\nof the old Saint-Roch quarter; and, between the Rue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re\r\nand the Rue de Choiseul, there was quite a tumult, the crush of a crowd\r\nof people who had been excited by a month\'s advertising, and with their\r\neyes in the air, were gaping at the monumental fa\xc3\xa7ade of The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, inaugurated that Monday, on the occasion of a grand display\r\nof white goods.\r\n\r\nThere was a vast development of bright, fresh polychromatic\r\narchitecture enriched with gilding, symbolical of the tumult and\r\nsparkle of the business inside, and attracting attention like a\r\ngigantic window-display flaming with the liveliest colours. In order\r\nnot to bedim the show of goods, the ground-floor decoration was of a\r\nsober description; the base of sea-green marble; the corner piers and\r\nbearing pillars covered with black marble, the severity of which was\r\nbrightened by gilded modillions; and all the rest was plate-glass,\r\nin iron sashes, nothing but glass, which seemed to throw the depths\r\nof the halls and galleries open to the full light of day. However,\r\nas the floors ascended, the hues became brighter. The frieze above\r\nthe ground-floor was formed of a series of mosaics, a garland of red\r\nand blue flowers, alternating with marble slabs on which was cut an\r\ninfinity of names of goods, encircling the colossus. Then the base of\r\nthe first floor, of enamelled brickwork, supported large windows, above\r\nwhich came another frieze formed of gilded escutcheons emblazoned with\r\nthe arms of the chief towns of France, and designs in terra-cotta, in\r\nwhose enamel one again found the light coloured tints of the base.\r\nThen, right at the top, the entablature blossomed forth like an ardent\r\nflorescence of the entire fa\xc3\xa7ade, mosaics and faience reappeared with\r\nyet warmer colourings, the zinc of the eaves was cut and gilded, while\r\nalong the acroteria ran a nation of statues, emblematical of the\r\ngreat industrial and manufacturing cities, their delicate silhouettes\r\nprofiled against the sky. The spectators were especially astonished\r\nby the central entrance which was also decorated with a profusion of\r\nmosaics, faience, and terra-cotta, and surmounted by a freshly gilt\r\nallegorical group, which glittered in the sun: Woman garmented and\r\nkissed by a flight of laughing cupids.\r\n\r\nAbout two o\'clock a special squad of police was obliged to make the\r\ncrowd move on, and to regulate the waiting carriages. The palace was\r\nbuilt, the temple raised to the extravagant folly of fashion. It\r\ndominated everything, covering a whole district with its shadows. The\r\nscar left on its flank by the demolition of Bourras\'s hovel had already\r\nbeen so skilfully cicatrized that it would now have been impossible to\r\nfind the former place of that old wart.\r\n\r\nIn their superb isolation the four frontages now ran along the four\r\nstreets, without a break. Since Baudu\'s retirement into a home, The Old\r\nElbeuf, on the other side of the way, had been closed, walled up like\r\na tomb, behind the shutters that were never now taken down; little by\r\nlittle cab-wheels had splashed them, while posters--a rising tide of\r\nadvertisements, which seemed like the last shovelful of earth thrown\r\nover old-fashioned commerce--covered them up and pasted them together;\r\nand, in the middle of this dead frontage, dirtied by the mud from the\r\nstreet, and streaked with tatters of Parisian puffery, a huge clean\r\nyellow poster, announcing in letters two feet high the great sale at\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise, was displayed like a flag planted on a conquered\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the colossus, after each enlargement, full of shame and\r\nrepugnance for the dingy district in which it had modestly sprung\r\nup, and which it had subsequently slaughtered, had just turned\r\nits back to it, leaving the mud of the narrow streets behind, and\r\npresenting its upstart face to the noisy, sunny thoroughfares of new\r\nParis. As now represented in the engravings of its advertisements,\r\nit had grown bigger and bigger, like the ogre of the legend, whose\r\nshoulders threatened to pierce the clouds. In the first place, in\r\nthe foreground of one engraving, were the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, the\r\nRue de la Michodi\xc3\xa8re, and the Rue Monsigny, filled with little black\r\nfigures, and endowed with wondrous breadth, as if to make room for\r\nthe customers of the whole world. Then came a bird\'s eye view of the\r\nbuildings themselves, of exaggerated immensity, with the roofs of the\r\ncovered galleries, the glazed courtyards in which the halls could be\r\ndivined, all the infinitude of that lake of glass and zinc shining in\r\nthe sun. Beyond, stretched Paris, but a Paris dwarfed, eaten away by\r\nthe monster: the houses, of cottage-like humbleness in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood, faded into a cloud of indistinct chimneys; the public\r\nbuildings seemed to melt into nothingness, on the left two dashes\r\nsufficed for Notre-Dame, to the right a circumflex accent represented\r\nthe Invalides, in the background the Panth\xc3\xa9on looked no larger than\r\na lentil. The horizon crumbled into powder, became no more than a\r\ncontemptible frame-work extending past the heights of Ch\xc3\xa2tillon,\r\nout into the open country, whose blurred expanses indicated how far\r\nextended the state of slavery.\r\n\r\nEver since the morning the crowd had been increasing. No establishment\r\nhad ever yet stirred up the city with such an uproarious profusion\r\nof advertisements. The Ladies\' Paradise now spent nearly six hundred\r\nthousand francs a year in posters, advertisements, and appeals of all\r\nsorts; four hundred thousand catalogues were sent away, more than a\r\nhundred thousand francs\' worth of material was cut up for patterns.\r\nIt was a complete invasion of the newspapers, the walls, and the ears\r\nof the public, as if some monstrous brass trumpet were being blown\r\nincessantly, carrying the tumult of the great sales to the four corners\r\nof the earth. And, for the future, this fa\xc3\xa7ade, before which people\r\nwere now crowding, became a living advertisement with its motley,\r\ngilded magnificence, its windows large enough for the display of the\r\nentire poem of woman\'s dress and its profusion of inscriptions painted,\r\nengraved and cut in stone, from the marble slabs of the ground-floor\r\nto the sheets of iron rounded off in semicircles above the roofs and\r\nunfolding gilded streamers on which the name of the house could be read\r\nin letters bright as the sun, against the azure blue of the sky.\r\n\r\nTrophies and flags had been added in honour of the inauguration; each\r\nstorey was gay with banners and standards bearing the arms of the\r\nprincipal towns of France; and right at the top, the flags of foreign\r\nnations, run up on masts, fluttered in the breeze. Down below the show\r\nof white goods in the windows flashed with blinding intensity. There\r\nwas nothing but white; on the left a complete trousseau and a mountain\r\nof sheets, on the right some curtains draped to imitate a chapel, and\r\nnumerous pyramids of handkerchiefs fatigued the eyes; while between the\r\nhung goods at the door--pieces of cotton, calico, and muslin, falling\r\nand spreading out like snow from a mountain summit--were placed some\r\ndressed prints, sheets of bluish cardboard, on which a young bride\r\nand a lady in ball costume, both life-size and attired in real lace\r\nand silk, smiled with their coloured faces. A group of idlers was\r\nconstantly forming there, and desire arose from the admiration of the\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\nMoreover the curiosity around The Ladies\' Paradise was increased by a\r\ncatastrophe of which all Paris was talking, the burning down of The\r\nFour Seasons, the big establishment which Bouthemont had opened near\r\nthe Opera-house, hardly three weeks before. The newspapers were full\r\nof details--the fire breaking out through an explosion of gas during\r\nthe night, the hurried flight of the frightened saleswomen in their\r\nnight-dresses, and the heroic conduct of Bouthemont, who had carried\r\nfive of them out on his shoulders. The enormous losses were covered\r\nby insurances and people had already begun to shrug their shoulders,\r\nsaying what a splendid advertisement it was. But for the time being\r\nattention again flowed back to The Ladies\' Paradise, excited by all\r\nthe stories which were flying about, occupied to a wonderful extent by\r\nthese colossal establishments which by their importance were taking up\r\nsuch a large place in public life. How wonderfully lucky that Mouret\r\nwas! Paris saluted her star, and crowded to see him still standing\r\nerect since the very flames now undertook to sweep all competition\r\nfrom before him; and the profits of his season were already being\r\ncalculated, people had begun to estimate the increase of custom which\r\nwould be brought to his doors by the forced closing of the rival house.\r\nFor a moment he had been anxious, troubled at feeling a jealous woman\r\nagainst him, that Madame Desforges to whom he owed some part of his\r\nfortune. Baron Hartmann\'s financial dilettantism in putting money into\r\nboth concerns, annoyed him also. Then he was above all exasperated at\r\nhaving missed a genial idea which had occurred to Bouthemont, who had\r\nprevailed on the vicar of the Madeleine to bless his establishment,\r\nfollowed by all his clergy; an astonishing ceremony, a religious\r\npomp paraded from the silk department to the glove department, and\r\nso on throughout the building. True, this ceremony had not prevented\r\neverything from being destroyed, but it had done as much good as a\r\nmillion francs worth of advertisements, so great an impression had it\r\nproduced on the fashionable world. From that day, Mouret dreamed of\r\nsecuring the services of the archbishop.\r\n\r\nThe clock over the door was striking three, and the afternoon crush\r\nhad commenced, nearly a hundred thousand customers struggling in the\r\nvarious galleries and halls. Outside, the vehicles were stationed from\r\none to the other end of the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre, and over against\r\nthe Opera-house another compact mass of conveyances occupied the\r\n_cul-de-sac_ where the future Avenue de l\'Op\xc3\xa9ra was to commence. Public\r\ncabs mixed with private broughams, the drivers waiting about the wheels\r\nand the horses neighing and shaking their curb-chains which sparkled in\r\nthe sun. The lines were incessantly reforming amidst the calls of the\r\nmessengers and the pushing of the animals, which closed in of their own\r\naccord, whilst fresh vehicles kept on arriving and taking their places\r\nwith the rest. The pedestrians flew on to the refuges in frightened\r\nbands, the foot pavements appeared black with people in the receding\r\nperspective of the broad straight thoroughfare. And a clamour rose up\r\nbetween the white houses, a mighty caressing breath swept along, as\r\nthough Paris were opening her soul.\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves, accompanied by her daughter Blanche and Madame Guibal,\r\nwas standing at a window, looking at a display of costumes composed of\r\nmade-up skirts with the necessary material for bodices.\r\n\r\n"Oh! do look," said she, "at those print costumes at nineteen francs\r\nfifteen sous!"\r\n\r\nIn their square pasteboard boxes lay the costumes, each tied round\r\nwith a favour, and folded so as to show the blue and red embroidered\r\ntrimmings; and, in a corner of each box, was an engraving depicting the\r\ngarment completed, as worn by a young person resembling some princess.\r\n\r\n"But they are not worth more," murmured Madame Guibal. "They fall to\r\npieces as soon as you handle them."\r\n\r\nThe two women had become quite intimate since Monsieur de Boves had\r\nbeen confined to his arm-chair by an attack of gout. His wife put up\r\nwith the acquaintance, since in this way she picked up a little pocket\r\nmoney, sums that the husband allowed himself to be robbed of, being\r\nalso in need of forbearance.\r\n\r\n"Well! let\'s go in," resumed Madame Guibal. "We must see their show.\r\nHasn\'t your son-in-law made an appointment with you inside?"\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves did not reply, being absorbed in contemplation of the\r\nstring of carriages, whose doors one by one opened and gave egress to\r\nmore customers.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Blanche, at last, in her indolent voice. "Paul is to join\r\nus at about four o\'clock in the reading-room, on leaving the ministry."\r\n\r\nThey had been married about a month, and Vallagnosc, after a three\r\nweeks\' leave of absence spent in the South of France, had just\r\nreturned to his post. The young woman already had her mother\'s portly\r\nappearance; her flesh seemed to be more puffy and coarse since her\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"But there\'s Madame Desforges over there!" exclaimed the countess,\r\nlooking at a brougham that had just pulled up.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" murmured Madame Guibal. "After all those stories!\r\nShe must still be weeping over the fire at The Four Seasons."\r\n\r\nHowever, it was indeed Henriette. On perceiving her friends, she\r\ncame up with a gay, smiling air, concealing her defeat beneath the\r\nfashionable ease of her manner.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! yes, I wanted to have a look round. It\'s better to see for\r\none\'s self, isn\'t it? Oh! we are still good friends with Monsieur\r\nMouret, though he is said to be furious since I interested myself in\r\nthat rival establishment. Personally, there is only one thing I cannot\r\nforgive him, and that is, to have urged on the marriage of my prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9e,\r\nMademoiselle de Fontenailles, with that Joseph----"\r\n\r\n"What! it\'s done?" interrupted Madame de Boves. "What a horror!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, and solely to annoy us. I know him; he wished to\r\nintimate that the daughters of our great families are only fit to marry\r\nhis shop messengers."\r\n\r\nShe was getting quite animated. They had all four remained on the\r\npavement, amidst the crush at the entrance. Little by little, however,\r\nthey were caught by the stream and only had to yield to the current to\r\npass the door without being conscious of it, talking louder the while\r\nin order to make themselves heard. They were now asking each other\r\nabout Madame Marty; it was said that poor Monsieur Marty, after some\r\nviolent scenes at home, had gone quite mad, believing himself endowed\r\nwith unexhaustible wealth. He was ever diving into the treasures of the\r\nearth, exhausting mines of gold and loading tumbrils with diamonds and\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\n"Poor old fellow!" said Madame Guibal, "he who was always so shabby,\r\nwith his teacher\'s humility! And the wife?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s ruining an uncle, now," replied Henriette, "a worthy old man who\r\nhas gone to live with her, since losing his wife. But she must be here,\r\nwe shall see her."\r\n\r\nSurprise, however, made the ladies stop short. Before them extended\r\n"the largest shops in the world," as the advertisements said. The grand\r\ncentral gallery now ran from end to end, opening on to both the Rue du\r\nDix-D\xc3\xa9cembre and the Rue Neuve-Saint-Augustin; whilst to the right and\r\nthe left, similar to the aisles of a church, the narrower Monsigny and\r\nMichodi\xc3\xa8re Galleries, extended along the two side streets without a\r\nbreak. Here and there the halls formed open spaces amidst the metallic\r\nframework of the spiral staircases and hanging bridges. The inside\r\narrangements had been all changed: the bargains were now placed on the\r\nRue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre side, the silk department was in the centre, the\r\nglove department occupied the Saint-Augustin Hall at the far end; and,\r\nfrom the new grand vestibule, you beheld, on looking up, the bedding\r\ndepartment which had been moved from one to the other end of the second\r\nfloor. The number of departments now amounted to the enormous total\r\nof fifty; several, quite fresh, were being inaugurated that very day;\r\nothers, which had become too important, had simply been divided, in\r\norder to facilitate the sales; and, owing to the continual increase of\r\nbusiness, the staff had been increased to three thousand and forty-five\r\nemployees for the new season.\r\n\r\nWhat caused the ladies to stop was the prodigious spectacle presented\r\nby the grand exhibition of white goods. In the first place, there was\r\nthe vestibule, a hall with bright mirrors, and paved with mosaics,\r\nwhere the low-priced goods detained the voracious crowd. Then the\r\ngalleries opened displaying a glittering blaze of white, a borealistic\r\nvista, a country of snow, with endless steppes hung with ermine, and an\r\naccumulation of glaciers shimmering in the sun. You here again found\r\nthe whiteness of the show windows, but vivified, and burning from one\r\nend of the enormous building to the other with the white flame of a\r\nfire in full swing. There was nothing but white goods, all the white\r\narticles from each department, a riot of white, a white constellation\r\nwhose fixed radiance was at first blinding, so that details could\r\nnot be distinguished. However, the eye soon became accustomed to\r\nthis unique whiteness; to the left, in the Monsigny Gallery, white\r\npromontories of cotton and calico jutted out, with white rocks formed\r\nof sheets, napkins, and handkerchiefs; whilst to the right, in the\r\nMichodi\xc3\xa8re Gallery, occupied by the mercery, the hosiery, and the\r\nwoollen goods, were erections of mother of pearl buttons, a grand\r\ndecoration composed of white socks and one whole room covered with\r\nwhite swanskin illumined by a stream of light from the distance. But\r\nthe greatest radiance of this nucleus of light came from the central\r\ngallery, from amidst the ribbons and the neckerchiefs, the gloves and\r\nthe silks. The counters disappeared beneath the whiteness of the silks,\r\nthe ribbons, the gloves and the neckerchiefs.\r\n\r\nRound the iron columns climbed "puffings" of white muslin, secured now\r\nand again with white silk handkerchiefs. The staircases were decorated\r\nwith white draperies, quiltings and dimities alternating along the\r\nbalustrades and encircling the halls as high as the second storey; and\r\nall this ascending whiteness assumed wings, hurried off and wandered\r\naway, like a flight of swans. And more white hung from the arches, a\r\nfall of down, a sheet of large snowy flakes; white counterpanes, white\r\ncoverlets hovered in the air, like banners in a church; long jets of\r\nguipure lace hung across, suggestive of swarms of white motionless\r\nbutterflies; other laces fluttered on all sides, floating like gossamer\r\nin a summer sky, filling the air with their white breath. And the\r\nmarvel, the altar of this religion of white was a tent formed of white\r\ncurtains, which hung from the glazed roof above the silk counter, in\r\nthe great hall. The muslin, the gauze, the art-guipures flowed in light\r\nripples, whilst very richly embroidered tulles, and pieces of oriental\r\nsilver-worked silk served as a background to this giant decoration,\r\nwhich partook both of the tabernacle and the alcove. It was like a\r\nbroad white bed, awaiting with its virginal immensity, as in the\r\nlegend, the coming of the white princess, she who was to appear some\r\nday, all powerful in her white bridal veil.\r\n\r\n"Oh! extraordinary!" repeated the ladies. "Wonderful!"\r\n\r\nThey did not weary of this song in praise of whiteness which the goods\r\nof the entire establishment were singing. Mouret had never conceived\r\nanything more vast; it was the master stroke of his genius for display.\r\nBeneath the flow of all this whiteness, amidst the seeming disorder\r\nof the tissues, fallen as if by chance from the open drawers, there\r\nwas so to say a harmonious phrase,--white followed and developed in\r\nall its tones: springing into existence, growing, and blossoming with\r\nthe complicated orchestration of some master\'s fugue, the continuous\r\ndevelopment of which carries the mind away in an ever-soaring flight.\r\nNothing but white, and yet never the same white, each different\r\ntinge showing against the other, contrasting with that next to it,\r\nor perfecting it, and attaining to the very brilliancy of light\r\nitself. It all began with the dead white of calico and linen, and the\r\ndull white of flannel and cloth; then came the velvets, silks, and\r\nsatins--quite an ascending gamut, the white gradually lighting up and\r\nfinally emitting little flashes at its folds; and then it flew away in\r\nthe transparencies of the curtains, became diffuse brightness with the\r\nmuslins, the guipures, the laces and especially the tulles, so light\r\nand airy that they formed the extreme final note; whilst the silver of\r\nthe oriental silk sounded higher than all else in the depths of the\r\ngiant alcove.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the place was full of life. The lifts were besieged\r\nby people; there was a crush at the refreshment-bar and in the\r\nreading-room; quite a nation was moving about in these snowy regions.\r\nAnd the crowd seemed to be black, like skaters on a Polish lake in\r\nDecember. On the ground-floor there was a heavy swell, ruffled by a\r\nreflux, in which nothing but the delicate enraptured faces of women\r\ncould be distinguished. In the gaps of the iron framework, up the\r\nstaircases, on the hanging bridges, there was an endless ascent of\r\nsmall figures which looked as if lost amidst the snowy peaks of\r\nmountains. A suffocating, hot-house heat surprised one at sight of\r\nthese frozen heights. The buzz of all the voices made a great noise\r\nlike that of a river carrying ice along. Up above, the profusion of\r\ngilding, the glass work and the golden roses seemed like a burst of\r\nsunshine, glittering over the Alps of this grand exhibition of white\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Madame de Boves, "we must go forward. It\'s impossible to\r\nstay here."\r\n\r\nSince she had entered, inspector Jouve, standing near the door, had\r\nnot taken his eyes off her; and when she turned round she encountered\r\nhis gaze. Then, as she resumed her walk, he let her gain ground, but\r\nfollowed her at a distance, without, however, appearing to take any\r\nfurther notice of her.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Madame Guibal again stopping amidst all the jostling as she\r\ncame to the first pay-desk, "that\'s a pretty idea, those violets!"\r\n\r\nShe referred to the new present made by The Ladies\' Paradise, one of\r\nMouret\'s ideas, which was making a great noise in the newspapers:\r\nsmall bouquets of white violets, bought by the thousand at Nice were\r\ndistributed to every lady customer who made the smallest purchase. Near\r\neach pay-desk messengers in uniform stood delivering the bouquets under\r\nthe supervision of an inspector. And gradually all the customers were\r\ndecorated in this way, the building was filling with these white bridal\r\nflowers, every woman diffusing as she passed a penetrating perfume of\r\nviolets.\r\n\r\n"Yes," murmured Madame Desforges, in a jealous voice, "it\'s a good\r\nidea."\r\n\r\nBut, just as they were moving away, they heard two salesmen joking\r\nabout these violets. A tall, thin fellow was expressing his\r\nastonishment: was the marriage between the governor and the first-hand\r\nin the costume department coming off, then? whilst a short, fat fellow\r\nreplied that he didn\'t know, but that the flowers were bought at any\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Madame de Boves, "is Monsieur Mouret going to marry?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the latest news," replied Madame Desforges, affecting the\r\ngreatest indifference. "However, one\'s bound to come to that."\r\n\r\nThe countess darted a quick glance at her new friend. They both now\r\nunderstood why Madame Desforges had come to The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nnotwithstanding the hostilities attending her rupture with Mouret. No\r\ndoubt she was yielding to an invincible desire to see and suffer.\r\n\r\n"I shall stay with you," said Madame Guibal, whose curiosity was\r\nawakened. "We can meet Madame de Boves again in the reading-room."\r\n\r\n"Very good," replied the latter. "I want to go up to the first floor.\r\nCome along, Blanche." And she went up followed by her daughter, whilst\r\ninspector Jouve still on her track, ascended by another staircase,\r\nin order not to attract her attention. The two other ladies soon\r\ndisappeared in the compact crowd on the ground-floor.\r\n\r\nAmidst the press of business all the counters were again talking of\r\nnothing but the governor\'s love matters. The affair which had for\r\nmonths been occupying the employees, who were delighted at Denise\'s\r\nlong resistance, had all at once come to a crisis: since the previous\r\nday it had been known that the girl intended to leave The Ladies\'\r\nParadise, under the pretext of requiring rest, and this despite all\r\nMouret\'s entreaties. And opinions were divided. Would she leave? Would\r\nshe stay? Bets of five francs that she would leave on the following\r\nSunday circulated from department to department. The knowing ones\r\nstaked a lunch on it all ending in a marriage; yet, the others, those\r\nwho believed in her departure, did not risk their money without good\r\nreasons. Certainly the girl had all the power of an adored woman who\r\nrefuses to yield; but the governor, on his side, was strong in his\r\nwealth, his happy widowerhood, and his pride, which a last exaction\r\nmight exasperate. At all events they were all of opinion that this\r\nlittle saleswoman had played her game with the science of a expert\r\nwoman of the world and was now venturing on the supreme stroke by\r\noffering him this bargain: Marry me, or I go.\r\n\r\nDenise, however, thought but little of these things. She had never\r\nimposed any conditions or made any calculation. And the reason of her\r\ndeparture was the very judgment which, to her continual surprise, was\r\npassed upon her conduct. Had she wished for all this? Had she shown\r\nherself artful, coquettish, ambitious? No, she had simply presented\r\nherself and had been the first to feel astonished at such a passion.\r\nAnd again, at the present time, why did they ascribe her resolution to\r\nquit The Ladies\' Paradise to craftiness? It was after all so natural!\r\nShe had begun to experience a nervous uneasiness, an intolerable\r\nanguish, amidst the continual gossip which went on in the house, and\r\nMouret\'s feverish pursuit of her, and the combats she was obliged to\r\nwage against herself; and she preferred to go away, seized with fear\r\nlest she might some day yield and regret it for ever afterwards. If in\r\nall this there were any learned tactics, she was totally unaware of it,\r\nand she asked herself in despair what she might do to avoid appearing\r\nlike one who is running after a husband. The idea of a marriage now\r\nirritated her, and she resolved to say no, and still no should he push\r\nhis folly to that extent. She alone ought to suffer. The necessity for\r\nthe separation caused her tears to flow; but, with her great courage,\r\nshe repeated that it was necessary, that she would have no rest or\r\nhappiness if she acted in any other way.\r\n\r\nWhen Mouret received her resignation, he remained mute and cold, in the\r\neffort which he made to contain himself. Then he curtly replied that he\r\ngranted her a week\'s reflection, before allowing her to commit such a\r\nstupid action. At the expiration of the week, when she returned to the\r\nsubject, and expressed a determination to go away after the great sale,\r\nhe did not lose his temper, but affected to talk the language of reason\r\nto her: she was playing with fortune, she would never find another\r\nposition equal to that she was leaving. Had she another situation in\r\nview? If so, he was quite prepared to offer her the advantages she\r\nexpected to obtain elsewhere. And when the young woman replied that she\r\nhad not looked for any other situation, but intended first of all to\r\ntake a rest at Valognes, thanks to the money she had already saved, he\r\nasked her what would prevent her from returning to The Ladies\' Paradise\r\nif her health alone were the reason of her departure. She remained\r\nsilent, tortured by this cross-examination. And thereupon he imagined\r\nthat she was about to join a sweetheart, a future husband perhaps. Had\r\nshe not confessed to him one evening that she loved somebody? From\r\nthat moment he had been carrying deep in his heart, like the stab of\r\na knife, the confession wrung from her. And, if this man was to marry\r\nher, she must be giving up all to follow him: that explained her\r\nobstinacy. It was all over; and so he simply added in an icy tone that\r\nhe would detain her no longer, since she could not tell him the real\r\ncause of her departure. These harsh words, free from anger, upset her\r\nfar more than a violent scene such as she had feared.\r\n\r\nThroughout the remaining week which Denise was obliged to spend in\r\nthe house, Mouret preserved his rigid pallor. When he crossed the\r\ndepartments, he affected not to see her; never had he seemed more\r\nindifferent, more absorbed in his work; and the bets began again, only\r\nthe brave ones dared to risk a luncheon on the wedding. Yet, beneath\r\nthis coldness, so unusual with him, Mouret hid a frightful attack of\r\nindecision and suffering. Fits of anger brought the blood seething to\r\nhis head: he saw red, he dreamed of taking Denise in a close embrace,\r\nkeeping her, and stifling her cries. Then he tried to reflect, to\r\nfind some practical means of preventing her from going away; but\r\nhe constantly ran up against his powerlessness, the uselessness of\r\nhis power and money. An idea, however, was growing amidst his wild\r\nprojects, and gradually imposing itself on him notwithstanding his\r\nrevolt. After Madame H\xc3\xa9douin\'s death he had sworn never to marry\r\nagain; having derived from a woman his first good fortune, he resolved\r\nin future to draw his fortune from all women. It was with him, as\r\nwith Bourdoncle, a superstition that the head of a great drapery\r\nestablishment ought to remain single, if he wished to retain his\r\nmasculine sovereignty over the growing desires of his world of female\r\ncustomers; for the introduction of a woman to the throne would change\r\nthe atmosphere, drive away all the others. Thus, he still resisted the\r\ninvincible logic of facts, preferring to die rather than yield, and\r\ninflamed by sudden bursts of fury against Denise, feeling that she\r\nwas Revenge and fearing he should fall vanquished upon his millions,\r\nbroken like a mere straw by the Eternal Feminine on the day he should\r\nmarry her. Then, however, he would become cowardly again, and discuss\r\nhis repugnance: why should he tremble? she was so sweet-tempered, so\r\nprudent, that he could abandon himself to her without fear. Twenty\r\ntimes an hour the battle began afresh in his distracted mind. His pride\r\ntended to irritate the wound, and he completely lost his reason when he\r\nthought that, even after this last submission, she might yet say no,\r\never no if she loved another. On the morning of the great sale, he had\r\nstill not decided on anything, and Denise was to leave on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWhen Bourdoncle, on the day in question, entered Mouret\'s private room\r\nat about three o\'clock, according to custom, he found him sitting with\r\nhis elbows on his desk, his hands over his eyes, so greatly absorbed\r\nthat he had to touch him on the shoulder. Then Mouret glanced up,\r\nhis face bathed in tears. They looked at each other, held out their\r\nhands, and a hearty grip was exchanged by these two men who had fought\r\nso many commercial battles side by side. For the past month moreover\r\nBourdoncle\'s manner had completely changed; he now bent before Denise,\r\nand even secretly urged the governor on to a marriage with her. No\r\ndoubt he was thus man\xc5\x93uvring to save himself from being swept away by\r\na power which he now recognised as superior. But beneath this change\r\nthere could also have been found the awakening of an old ambition,\r\na timid, gradually growing hope of in his turn swallowing up that\r\nMouret before whom he had so long bowed. This was in the atmosphere\r\nof the house, in the struggle for existence whose continued massacres\r\nhelped on the sales around him. He was carried away by the working of\r\nthe machine, seized by the same appetite as the others, that voracity\r\nwhich, from top to bottom, urged the lean ones to the extermination of\r\nthe fat ones. Only a sort of religious fear, the religion of chance,\r\nhad so far prevented him from showing his own teeth. But now the\r\ngovernor was becoming childish, drifting into a ridiculous marriage,\r\nruining his luck, destroying his charm over the customers. Why should\r\nhe dissuade him from it, when he might afterwards so easily pick up the\r\nbusiness of this weakling who fell at the feet of a woman? Thus it was\r\nwith the emotion of a farewell, the pity of an old friendship, that he\r\nshook his chief\'s hand, saying:\r\n\r\n"Come, come, courage! Marry her, and finish the matter."\r\n\r\nBut Mouret already felt ashamed of his momentary weakness, and got up,\r\nprotesting: "No, no, it\'s too stupid. Come, let\'s take a turn round the\r\nplace. Things are looking well, aren\'t they? I fancy we shall have a\r\nmagnificent day."\r\n\r\nThey went out and began their afternoon inspection of the crowded\r\ndepartments. Bourdoncle meanwhile cast side glances at his companion,\r\nfeeling anxious at this last display of energy and watching his lips\r\nto catch the least sign of suffering. The business was now throwing\r\nforth its fire, with an infernal roar, which made the building tremble\r\nlike a big steamer going at full speed. At Denise\'s counter was a crowd\r\nof mothers with bands of little girls and boys, swamped beneath the\r\ngarments they were trying on. The department had brought out all its\r\nwhite articles, and there, as everywhere else, was a riot of white fit\r\nfor the garmenting of a troop of shivering cupids: white cloth cloaks,\r\nwhite piqu\xc3\xa9, nainsook and cashmere dresses, white sailor costumes, and\r\neven white Zouave ones. In the centre, for the sake of effect, for the\r\nproper season had not yet arrived, there was a display of confirmation\r\ncostumes, white muslin dresses and veils and white satin shoes, a light\r\ngushing florescence like an enormous bouquet of innocence and candid\r\ndelight. Madame Bourdelais, with her three children, Madeleine, Edmond\r\nand Lucien, seated according to their size, was getting angry with the\r\nsmallest because he continued struggling whilst Denise tried to put a\r\nmuslin-de-laine jacket on him.\r\n\r\n"Do keep still! Don\'t you think it\'s rather tight, mademoiselle?" she\r\nsaid; and with the sharp look of a woman difficult to deceive, she\r\nexamined the stuff, studied the cut, and scrutinized the seams. "No,\r\nit fits well," she resumed. "It\'s no trifle to dress all these little\r\nones. Now I want a mantle for this young lady."\r\n\r\nDenise had been obliged to assist in serving as the customers had\r\nbesieged her department in great force. She was looking for the mantle\r\nrequired, when she set up a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n"What! It\'s you! what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nHer brother Jean was standing before her, a parcel in his hand. He\r\nhad been married a week before, and on the Saturday his wife, a dark\r\nlittle woman, with a provoking, charming face, had paid a long visit to\r\nThe Ladies\' Paradise to make some purchases. The young people were to\r\naccompany Denise to Valognes: it was to be a regular honeymoon trip, a\r\nmonth\'s holiday which would remind them of old times.\r\n\r\n"Just fancy," he said, "Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se has forgotten a number of things. There\r\nare some articles to be changed, and others to be bought. So, as she\r\nwas in a hurry, she sent me with this parcel. I\'ll explain----"\r\n\r\nBut she interrupted him on perceiving P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, "What! P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 too! and his\r\nschool?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Jean, "after dinner on Sunday I had not the heart to\r\ntake him back. He will return this evening. The poor child is very\r\ndownhearted at the thought of being shut up in Paris whilst we shall be\r\nenjoying ourselves."\r\n\r\nDenise smiled at them, in spite of her suffering. She handed Madame\r\nBourdelais over to one of her saleswomen and came back to her brothers\r\nin a corner of the department, which was, fortunately, getting clearer.\r\nThe youngsters, as she still called them, had now grown to be big\r\nfellows. P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 at twelve years old, was already taller and stouter than\r\nherself but still taciturn and living on caresses, looking, too, very\r\ngentle in his school-uniform; whilst broad-shouldered Jean, quite a\r\nhead taller than his sister, with blonde hair blowing about in the\r\nwind, still retained his feminine good looks. And she, always slim, no\r\nfatter than a skylark, as she said, still retained her anxious motherly\r\nauthority over them, treating them as children in need of all her\r\nattention, buttoning up Jean\'s frock coat so that he should not look\r\nlike a rake, and seeing that P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 had got a clean handkerchief. When\r\nshe perceived the latter\'s swollen eyes, she gently chided him. "You\r\nmust be reasonable, my boy. Your studies cannot be interrupted," said\r\nshe. "I\'ll take you away at the holidays. Is there anything you want?\r\nBut perhaps you prefer to have the money." Then she turned towards the\r\nother. "And you, youngster, it\'s your fault, you get making him believe\r\nthat we are going to have wonderful fun! Just try to be a little more\r\nreasonable."\r\n\r\nShe had given Jean four thousand francs, half of her savings, to enable\r\nhim to set up housekeeping. The younger one cost her a great deal for\r\nschooling, indeed all her money went for them, as in former days. They\r\nalone linked her to life and work, for she had again vowed that she\r\nwould never marry.\r\n\r\n"Well, here are the things," resumed Jean. "In the first place, there\'s\r\na light brown cloak in this parcel that Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se----"\r\n\r\nBut he stopped, and Denise, on turning round to see what had frightened\r\nhim, perceived Mouret standing behind them. For a moment he had been\r\nwatching her acting the mother towards the two big boys, scolding\r\nand embracing them and turning them round as mothers do babies when\r\nchanging their clothes. Bourdoncle had remained on one side, feigning\r\nto be interested in the sales; but he did not lose sight of this little\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n"They are your brothers, are they not?" asked Mouret, after a silence.\r\n\r\nHe had the icy tone and rigid demeanour which he now assumed with her.\r\nDenise herself made an effort to remain cold. Her smile died away, and\r\nshe replied: "Yes, sir. I\'ve married off the eldest, and his wife has\r\nsent him for some purchases."\r\n\r\nMouret continued looking at the three of them. At last he said: "The\r\nyoungest has grown very much. I recognise him, I remember having seen\r\nhim in the Tuileries Gardens one evening with you."\r\n\r\nThen his voice, which was coming more slowly, slightly trembled.\r\nShe, much moved, bent down, pretending to arrange P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9\'s belt. Both\r\nbrothers, who had turned scarlet, stood smiling at their sister\'s\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n"They\'re very much like you," said the latter.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she exclaimed, "they\'re much handsomer than I am!"\r\n\r\nFor a moment he seemed to be comparing their faces. But he could endure\r\nit no longer. How she loved them! He walked on a step or two; then\r\nreturned and whispered in her ear: "Come to my office after business. I\r\nwant to speak to you before you go away."\r\n\r\nThis time, Mouret went off and continued his inspection. The battle\r\nwas once more raging within him, for the appointment he had just given\r\ncaused him a sort of irritation. To what idea had he yielded on seeing\r\nher with her brothers? It was maddening to think that he could no\r\nlonger find the strength to assert his will. However, he could settle\r\nit by saying a few words of farewell. Bourdoncle, who had rejoined him,\r\nseemed less anxious, though he was still examining him with stealthy\r\nglances.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Denise had returned to Madame Bourdelais. "Does the mantle\r\nsuit you, madame?" she inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, very well. That\'s quite enough for one day. These little ones\r\nare ruining me!"\r\n\r\nDenise, now being able to slip off, went to listen to Jean\'s\r\nexplanations, and then accompanied him to the various counters, where\r\nhe would certainly have lost his head without her. First came the brown\r\njacket, which Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se now wished to change for a white cloth one of the\r\nsame size and same shape. And the young woman, having taken the parcel,\r\nwent to the mantle department, followed by her two brothers.\r\n\r\nThe department had laid out all its light coloured garments, summer\r\njackets and capes, of light silk and fancy woollens. But there was\r\nlittle doing there, the customers were but few and far between. Nearly\r\nall the saleswomen were new-comers. Clara had disappeared a month\r\nbefore, and some said that she had altogether gone to the bad. As for\r\nMarguerite, she was at last about to assume the management of the\r\nlittle shop at Grenoble, where her cousin was waiting for her. Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie alone remained there immutable, in the curved cuirass of her\r\nsilk dress and with her imperial face retaining the yellowish puffiness\r\nof an antique marble. However, her son Albert\'s bad conduct was a\r\nsource of great trouble to her, and she would have retired into the\r\ncountry had it not been for the inroads made on the family savings by\r\nthis scapegrace, whose terrible extravagance threatened to swallow up\r\nthe Rigolles property piece by piece. It was a sort of punishment on\r\nthem, for breaking up their home, for the mother had resumed her little\r\nexcursions with her lady friends, and the father on his side continued\r\nhis musical performances. Bourdoncle was already looking at Madame\r\nAur\xc3\xa9lie with a discontented air, surprised that she lacked the tact to\r\nresign: too old for business, such was his opinion; the knell was about\r\nto sound which would sweep away the Lhomme dynasty.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s you," said she to Denise, with exaggerated amiability. "You\r\nwant this cloak changed, eh? Certainly, at once. Ah! there are your\r\nbrothers; getting quite men, I declare!"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her pride, she would have gone on her knees to pay her\r\ncourt to the young woman. In her department, as in the others, nothing\r\nbut Denise\'s departure was being talked of; and the first-hand was\r\nquite ill over it, for she had been reckoning on the protection of her\r\nformer saleswoman. She lowered her voice to say: "It\'s reported you\'re\r\ngoing to leave us. Really, it isn\'t possible?"\r\n\r\n"But it is, though," replied Denise.\r\n\r\nMarguerite was listening. Since her marriage had been decided on,\r\nshe had marched about with more disdainful airs than ever on her\r\nputty-looking face. And she came up saying: "You are quite right.\r\nSelf-respect above everything, I say. Allow me to bid you adieu, my\r\ndear."\r\n\r\nSome customers arriving at that moment, Madame Aur\xc3\xa9lie requested her,\r\nin a harsh voice, to attend to business. Then, as Denise was taking\r\nthe cloak to effect the "return" herself, she protested, and called an\r\nauxiliary. This, again, was an innovation suggested to Mouret by the\r\nyoung woman--the engagement of persons to carry the articles about,\r\nthus relieving the saleswomen of much fatigue.\r\n\r\n"Go with Mademoiselle," said the first-hand, giving the auxiliary the\r\ncloak. Then, returning to Denise, she added: "Pray consider the matter\r\nwell. We are all heart-broken at your leaving."\r\n\r\nJean and P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, who were waiting, smiling amidst this overflowing\r\ntorrent of women, followed their sister. They now had to go to the\r\nunder-linen department, to get four chemises like the half-dozen which\r\nTh\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se had bought on the Saturday. But there, where the exhibition\r\nof white goods was snowing down from every shelf, they were almost\r\nstifled, and found it very difficult to get along.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, at the corset counter a little scene was collecting\r\nquite a crowd. Madame Boutarel, who had arrived in Paris from the\r\nsouth, this time with her husband and daughter, had been wandering all\r\nover the place since morning, collecting an outfit for the young lady,\r\nwho was about to be married. The father was consulted at every turn\r\nso that it seemed they would never finish. At last they had stranded\r\nhere; and whilst the young lady was absorbed in a profound study of\r\nsome undergarments, the mother had disappeared, having cast her eyes\r\non some corsets she herself fancied. When Monsieur Boutarel, a big,\r\nfull-blooded man, quite bewildered, left his daughter to search for\r\nhis wife, he at last found her in a sitting-room, at the door of which\r\nhe was politely invited to take a seat. These rooms were like narrow\r\ncells, glazed with ground glass, and not even husbands were allowed to\r\nenter them. Saleswomen came out and went in quickly, closing the doors\r\nbehind them, while men waited outside, seated in rows on arm-chairs,\r\nand looking very weary. Monsieur Boutarel, when he understood matters,\r\ngot really angry, crying out that he wanted his wife, and insisting on\r\nknowing what they had done with her. It was in vain that they tried to\r\ncalm him. Madame Boutarel was obliged to come out, to the delight of\r\nthe crowd, which was discussing and laughing over the affair.\r\n\r\nDenise and her brothers were at last able to get past. Every article\r\nof ladies\' underwear was here displayed in a suite of rooms classified\r\ninto various departments. The corsets and dress-improvers occupied one\r\ncounter, there were hand-sown corsets, Duchess, cuirass, and, above\r\nall, white silk corsets, fan-pointed with divers colours, these latter\r\nforming a special display, an army of dummies without heads or legs,\r\nnothing indeed but busts; and close by were horse-hair and other dress\r\nimprovers, often of fantastic aspect. But afterwards came articles\r\nof fine linen, white cuffs and cravats, white fichus and collars, an\r\ninfinite variety of light trifles, a white foam which escaped from the\r\nboxes and was heaped up like so much snow. There were loose jackets,\r\nlittle bodices, morning gowns and peignoirs in linen, nainsook, and\r\nlace, long white roomy garments, which spoke of the morning lounge.\r\nThen appeared white petticoats of every length, the petticoat that\r\nclings to the knees, and the long petticoat which sweeps the pavement,\r\na rising sea of petticoats, in which one lost oneself.\r\n\r\nAt the trousseau department there was a wonderful display of pleating,\r\nembroidery, valenciennes, percale and Cambric; and then followed\r\nanother room devoted to baby-linen, where the voluptuous whiteness of\r\nwoman\'s clothing developed into the chaste whiteness of infancy--an\r\ninnocence, a joy, the young wife become a mother, amidst flannel coifs,\r\nchemises and caps like dolls\' things, christening gowns, cashmere\r\npelisses, indeed all the white down of birth, like a fine shower of\r\nwhite feathers.\r\n\r\n"They are chemises with running-strings," said Jean, who was delighted\r\nwith the rising tide of feminine attire about him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Pauline ran up as soon as she perceived Denise; and before\r\neven asking what she wanted, began to talk in a low tone, stirred as\r\nshe was by the rumours circulating in the building. In her department,\r\ntwo saleswomen had even got to quarrelling over it, one affirming and\r\nthe other denying the favourite\'s departure.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll stay with us, I\'ll stake my life. What would become of me?"\r\nsaid Pauline; and as Denise replied that she intended to leave the\r\nnext day: "No, no," the other added, "you think so, but I know better.\r\nYou must appoint me second-hand, now that I\'ve got my baby. Baug\xc3\xa9 is\r\nreckoning on it, my dear."\r\n\r\nPauline smiled with an air of conviction. Then she gave the six\r\nchemises; and, Jean having said that he must next go to the\r\nhandkerchief counter, she called an auxiliary to carry both the\r\nchemises and the jacket left by the auxiliary from the mantle\r\ndepartment. The woman who happened to answer was Mademoiselle de\r\nFontenailles, recently married to Joseph. She had just obtained this\r\nmenial situation as a great favour, and she wore a long black blouse,\r\nmarked on the shoulder with a number in yellow wool.\r\n\r\n"Follow mademoiselle," said Pauline, and then returning to Denise and\r\nagain lowering her voice, she added: "It\'s understood that I am to be\r\nappointed second-hand, eh?"\r\n\r\nDenise promised, with a laugh, by way of joking in her turn. And she\r\nwent off, going down the stairs with Jean and P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9, all three followed\r\nby the auxiliary. On the ground-floor, they found themselves in the\r\nwoollen department, a gallery entirely hung with white swanskin cloth\r\nand white flannel. Li\xc3\xa9nard, whom his father had vainly recalled to\r\nAngers, was talking to the handsome Mignot who was now a traveller,\r\nand had boldly reappeared at The Ladies\' Paradise. No doubt they were\r\nspeaking of Denise, for they both stopped talking to bow to her with\r\na ceremonious air. In fact, as she passed through the departments the\r\nsalesmen appeared full of emotion and bent their heads before her,\r\nuncertain as they were what she might be the next day. They whispered\r\nand thought she looked triumphant; and the betting was once more\r\naltered; they again risked bottles of Argenteuil wine and fish dinners\r\nover the event. She had entered the linen-gallery in order to get\r\nto the handkerchief counter, which was at the further end. The show\r\nof white goods continued: cottons, madapolams, dimities, quiltings,\r\ncalicoes, nainsooks, muslins, tarlatans; then came the linen, in\r\nenormous piles, the pieces ranged alternately like blocks of stone:\r\nstout linen, fine linen, of all widths, white and unbleached, some of\r\npure flax, whitened in the sun; next the same thing commenced once\r\nmore, there were departments for each sort of linen: house linen,\r\ntable linen, kitchen linen, a continual crush of white goods, sheets,\r\npillow-cases, innumerable styles of napkins, table-cloths, aprons, and\r\ndusters. And the bowing continued, all made way for Denise to pass,\r\nwhile Baug\xc3\xa9 rushed out to smile on her, as on the good fairy of the\r\nhouse. At last, after crossing the counterpane department, a room\r\nhung with white banners, she arrived at the handkerchief counter, the\r\ningenious decoration of which delighted the throng; everything here was\r\narranged in white columns, white pyramids, white castles, an intricate\r\narchitecture, solely composed of handkerchiefs, some of lawn, others\r\nof cambric, Irish linen, or China silk, some marked, some embroidered\r\nby hand, some trimmed with lace, some hemstitched, and some woven\r\nwith vignettes; the whole forming a city of white bricks of infinite\r\nvariety, standing out mirage-like against an Eastern sky, warmed to a\r\nwhite heat.\r\n\r\n"You say another dozen?" asked Denise of her brother. "Cholet\r\nhandkerchiefs, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, like this one," he replied, showing a handkerchief in his parcel.\r\n\r\nJean and P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 had not quitted her side, but clung to her as they had\r\ndone formerly on arriving in Paris, knocked up by their journey. This\r\nvast establishment, in which she was quite at home, ended by troubling\r\nthem; and they sheltered themselves in her shadow, placing themselves\r\nagain under the protection of this second mother of theirs as in an\r\ninstinctive re-awakening of their infancy. The employees watching\r\nthem as they passed, smiled at those two big fellows following in the\r\nfootsteps of that grave slim girl; Jean frightened in spite of his\r\nbeard, P\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9 bewildered in his tunic, and all three of the same fair\r\ncomplexion, a fairness which made a whisper run from one end of the\r\ncounters to the other: "They are her brothers! They are her brothers!"\r\n\r\nBut, whilst Denise was looking for a salesman, there occurred another\r\nmeeting. Mouret and Bourdoncle had entered the gallery; and as the\r\nformer again stopped in front of the young woman, without, however,\r\nspeaking to her, Madame Desforges and Madame Guibal passed by.\r\nHenriette suppressed the quiver which had invaded her whole being;\r\nshe looked at Mouret and then at Denise. They also had looked at her,\r\nand it was a sort of mute _d\xc3\xa9nouement_, the common end of many great\r\ndramas of the heart,--a glance exchanged in the crush of a crowd.\r\nMouret had already moved off, whilst Denise strayed into the depths\r\nof the department, accompanied by her brothers and still in search\r\nof a disengaged salesman. But in the auxiliary following Denise,\r\nwith a yellow number on her shoulder, and a coarse, cadaverous,\r\nservant\'s-looking face, Henriette had recognised Mademoiselle de\r\nFontenailles, and relieved herself by saying to Madame Guibal, in an\r\nangry voice:\r\n\r\n"Just see what he\'s doing with that unfortunate girl. Isn\'t it\r\nshameful? A marchioness! And he makes her follow like a dog the\r\ncreatures he has picked up in the street!" Then she tried to calm\r\nherself, adding, with an affected air of indifference: "Let\'s go and\r\nsee their display of silks."\r\n\r\nThe silk department was like a great chamber of love, hung with white\r\nby the caprice of some snowy maiden wishing to show off her own\r\nspotless whiteness. Pieces of velvet hung from the columns, forming\r\na creamy white background against which silk and satin draperies\r\nshowed with a metallic and porcelain-like whiteness; and there were\r\nalso festoons of poult and gros grain silks, light foulards and\r\nsurahs, which varied from the dull white of a Norwegian blonde to the\r\ntransparent white, warmed by the sun, of a fair Italian or Spanish\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nFavier was just then engaged in measuring some white silk for "the\r\npretty lady," that elegant blonde who was such a frequent customer\r\nat the counter, and whom the salesmen never referred to except by\r\nthat name. She had dealt at the shop for years, and yet they knew\r\nnothing about her--neither her condition of life, her address, nor\r\neven her name. None of them, in fact, tried to find out, although\r\nevery time she made her appearance they all indulged in suppositions\r\njust for something to talk about. She was getting thinner, she was\r\ngetting stouter, she had slept well, or she must have been out late\r\nthe previous evening; indeed every little incident of her unknown\r\nlife, outdoor events and domestic dramas alike, found an echo at the\r\nParadise, and was commented on. That day, she seemed very gay; and so,\r\non returning from the pay-desk whither he had conducted her, Favier\r\nremarked to Hutin: "Perhaps she\'s going to marry again."\r\n\r\n"What! is she a widow?" asked the other.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but you must remember the time she was in mourning.\r\nPerhaps she\'s made some money by speculating on the Bourse." A silence\r\nensued. At last he ended by saying: "However, that\'s her business. It\r\nwouldn\'t do to take notice of all the women we see here."\r\n\r\nBut Hutin was looking very thoughtful, for two days before, he had had\r\na warm discussion with the managers, and felt himself condemned. After\r\nthe great sale his dismissal was certain. For a long time he had felt\r\nhis position giving way. At the last stock-taking they had complained\r\nthat he had not even transacted the amount of business fixed in\r\nadvance; and moreover he was threatened by the appetites of the others,\r\nnow slowly devouring him in his turn--by all the silent warfare which\r\nwas waged in the department, amidst the very motion of the machine.\r\nFavier\'s secret undermining could be heard, like a muffled sound of\r\njaw-bones at work underground. He had already received the promise of\r\nthe first-hand\'s place, but Hutin, who was aware of it, instead of\r\nattacking his old comrade looked upon him as a clever fellow. To think\r\nof it! A chap who had always appeared so cold, so humble, whom he had\r\nmade such use of to turn out both Robineau and Bouthemont! He was full\r\nof mingled surprise and respect.\r\n\r\n"By the way," all at once resumed Favier, "she\'s going to stay, you\r\nknow. The governor has just been seen casting sheep\'s eyes at her. I\r\nshall be let in for a bottle of champagne over it."\r\n\r\nHe referred to Denise. The gossip was going on more than ever, passing\r\nfrom one counter to the other, through the constantly increasing crowd\r\nof customers. The silk salesmen were especially excited, for they had\r\nbeen indulging in heavy bets on the affair.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" exclaimed Hutin, waking up as if from a dream, "wasn\'t I a\r\nflat not to pay court to her! I should be all right now!"\r\n\r\nThen on seeing Favier laugh he blushed at this confession, and\r\npretended to laugh himself, adding, as though to recall his words, that\r\nit was she who had ruined him with the management. Then a desire for\r\nviolence seizing hold of him, he finished by getting into a rage with\r\nthe salesmen whom the assault of the customers had disbanded. But all\r\nat once he again smiled, having just perceived Madame Desforges and\r\nMadame Guibal slowly crossing the department.\r\n\r\n"What can we serve you with to-day, madame?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, thanks," replied Henriette. "You see I\'m merely walking\r\nround; I\'ve only come out of curiosity."\r\n\r\nHowever, he succeeded in stopping her, and lowered his voice. Quite a\r\nplan was springing up in his head. He began to flatter her and run down\r\nthe house; he had had enough of it, and preferred to go away rather\r\nthan remain a witness of such disorder. She listened, delighted. It\r\nwas she herself who, thinking to deprive The Ladies\' Paradise of his\r\nservices offered to get him engaged by Bouthemont as first-hand in the\r\nsilk department when The Four Seasons should start again. The matter\r\nwas settled in whispers, whilst Madame Guibal interested herself in the\r\ndisplays.\r\n\r\n"May I offer you one of these bouquets of violets?" resumed Hutin,\r\naloud, pointing to a table where there were four or five bunches of the\r\nflowers, which he had procured from a pay-desk for personal presents.\r\n\r\n"Ah, no, indeed!" exclaimed Henriette, recoiling. "I don\'t wish to take\r\nany part in the wedding."\r\n\r\nThey understood each other, and separated with a laugh, exchanging\r\nglances of intelligence. Then as Madame Desforges began looking for\r\nMadame Guibal, she set up an exclamation of surprise on seeing her\r\nwith Madame Marty. The latter, followed by her daughter Valentine,\r\nhad for the last two hours been carried through the place by one of\r\nthose spending fits whence she always emerged weary and bewildered.\r\nShe had roamed about the furniture department which a show of white\r\nlacquered good had changed into a vast virginal chamber, the ribbon and\r\nneckerchief departments which formed white colonnades, the mercery and\r\ntrimming departments with white fringes surrounding ingenious trophies\r\npatiently built up of cards of buttons and packets of needles, and the\r\nhosiery department in which there was a great crush that year to see\r\nan immense piece of decoration--the resplendent name of "The Ladies\'\r\nParadise" in letters three yards high, formed of white socks on a\r\ngroundwork of red ones. But Madame Marty was especially excited by the\r\nnew departments; they could indeed never open a new department but she\r\nmust inaugurate it, she was bound to plunge in and buy something. And\r\nso at the millinery counter installed in a new room on the first-floor\r\nshe had spent an hour in having the cupboards emptied, taking the\r\nbonnets off the stands ranged on a couple of tables, and trying all\r\nof them, white hats, white bonnets and white togues, on herself and\r\nher daughter. Then she had gone down to the boot department, at the\r\nfurther end of a gallery on the ground-floor, behind the cravats, a\r\ncounter which had been opened that day, and which she had turned topsy\r\nturvy, seized with sickly desire in presence of the white silk slippers\r\ntrimmed with swansdown and the white satin boots and shoes with high\r\nLouis XV. heels.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my dear," she stammered, "you\'ve no idea! They have a wonderful\r\nassortment of bonnets. I\'ve chosen one for myself and one for my\r\ndaughter. And the boots, eh? Valentine."\r\n\r\n"They\'re marvellous!" added the latter, with the boldness of one who is\r\nat last married. "There are some boots at twenty francs and a half the\r\npair which are delicious!"\r\n\r\nA salesman was following them, dragging along the eternal chair, on\r\nwhich a mountain of articles was already heaped.\r\n\r\n"How is Monsieur Marty?" asked Madame Desforges.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I believe," replied Madame Marty, scared by this abrupt\r\nquestion, which fell ill-naturedly amidst her rage for spending. "He\'s\r\nstill shut up, you know; my uncle was to go to see him this morning."\r\n\r\nThen she paused and exclaimed: "Oh, look! isn\'t it lovely?"\r\n\r\nThe ladies, who had gone on a few steps, found themselves before the\r\nnew flowers and feathers department, installed in the central gallery,\r\nbetween the silks and the gloves. Under the bright light from the glass\r\nroof there appeared an enormous florescence, a white sheaf, tall and\r\nbroad as an oak. The base was formed of single flowers, violets, lilies\r\nof the valley, hyacinths, daisies, all the delicate white blossoms of\r\nthe garden. Then came bouquets, white roses softened by a fleshy tint,\r\ngreat white peonies slightly shaded with carmine, white chrysanthemums\r\nwith narrow petals and starred with yellow. And the flowers still\r\nascended, great mystical lilies, branches of apple blossom, bunches of\r\nwhite lilac, a continual blossoming surmounted at the height of the\r\nfirst storey by tufts of ostrich feathers, white plumes, which seemed\r\nlike the airy breath of this collection of white flowers. One corner\r\nwas devoted to the display of trimmings and orange-flower wreaths.\r\nThere were also metallic flowers, silver thistles and silver ears of\r\ncorn. And amidst the foliage and the petals, amidst all the muslin,\r\nsilk, and velvet, in which drops of gum set drops of dew, fluttered\r\nbirds of Paradise for the trimming of hats, purple Tanagers with black\r\ntails, and Kingbirds with changing rainbow-like plumage.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to buy a branch of apple-blossom," resumed Madame Marty.\r\n"It\'s delicious, isn\'t it? And that little bird, do look, Valentine! I\r\nmust take it!"\r\n\r\nHowever, Madame Guibal began to feel tired of standing still in the\r\neddying crowd, and at last exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll leave you to make your purchases. We\'re going upstairs."\r\n\r\n"No, no, wait for me!" cried the other, "I\'m going up too. There\'s the\r\nperfumery department upstairs, I must see that."\r\n\r\nThis department, created the day before, was next door to the\r\nreading-room. Madame Desforges, to avoid the crush on the stairs, spoke\r\nof going up in the lift; but they had to abandon the idea, there were\r\nso many people waiting their turn. At last they arrived, passing before\r\nthe public refreshment bar, where the crowd was becoming so great\r\nthat an inspector had to restrain the outburst of appetite by only\r\nallowing the gluttonous customers to enter in small groups. And from\r\nthis point the ladies already began to smell the perfumery department,\r\nfor its penetrating odour scented the whole gallery. There was quite a\r\nstruggle over one article, The Paradise Soap, a specialty of the house.\r\nIn the show cases, and on the crystal tablets of the shelves, were\r\nranged pots of pomade and paste, boxes of powder and paint, phials of\r\noil and toilet vinegar; whilst the fine brushes, combs, scissors, and\r\nsmelling-bottles occupied a special place. The salesmen had managed to\r\ndecorate the shelves exclusively with white porcelain pots and white\r\nglass bottles. But what delighted the customers above all was a silver\r\nfountain in the centre, a shepherdess standing on a harvest of flowers,\r\nwhence flowed a continuous stream of violet water, which fell with a\r\nmusical plash into the metal basin. An exquisite odour was diffused\r\naround and the ladies dipped their handkerchiefs in the scent as they\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n"There!" said Madame Marty, when she had loaded herself with lotions,\r\ndentrifices, and cosmetics. "Now I\'ve done, I\'m at your service. Let\'s\r\ngo and rejoin Madame de Boves."\r\n\r\nHowever, on the landing of the great central staircase they were again\r\nstopped by the Japanese department. This counter had grown wonderfully\r\nsince the day when Mouret had amused himself by setting up, in the\r\nsame place, a little "proposition" table, covered with a few soiled\r\narticles, without at all foreseeing its future success. Few departments\r\nhad had more modest beginnings and yet now it overflowed with old\r\nbronzes, old ivories and old lacquer work; it did fifteen hundred\r\nthousand francs\' worth of business a year, ransacking the Far East,\r\nwhere travellers pillaged the palaces and the temples for it. Besides,\r\nfresh departments were always springing up, they had tried two new ones\r\nin December, in order to fill up the empty spaces caused by the dead\r\nwinter season--a book department and a toy department, which would\r\ncertainly expand and sweep away certain shops in the neighbourhood.\r\nFour years had sufficed for the Japanese department to attract the\r\nentire artistic custom of Paris. This time Madame Desforges herself,\r\nnotwithstanding the rancour which had made her vow not to buy anything,\r\nsuccumbed before some finely carved ivory.\r\n\r\n"Send it to my house," said she rapidly, at a neighbouring pay-desk.\r\n"Ninety francs, is it not?" And, seeing Madame Marty and her daughter\r\nbusy with a lot of trashy porcelains, she resumed, as she carried off\r\nMadame Guibal, "You will find us in the reading-room, I really must sit\r\ndown a little while."\r\n\r\nIn the reading-room, however, they were obliged to remain standing. All\r\nthe chairs round the large table covered with newspapers were occupied.\r\nGreat fat fellows were reading and lolling about without even thinking\r\nof giving up their seats to the ladies. A few women were writing, their\r\nfaces almost on the paper, as if to conceal their letters under the\r\nflowers of their hats. Madame de Boves was not there, and Henriette was\r\ngetting impatient when she perceived Vallagnosc, who was also looking\r\nfor his wife and mother-in-law. He bowed, and said: "They must be in\r\nthe lace department--impossible to drag them away. I\'ll just see." And\r\nhe was gallant enough to procure the others two chairs before going off.\r\n\r\nIn the lace department the crush was increasing every minute. The\r\ngreat show of white was there triumphing in its most delicate and\r\ncostly whiteness. Here was the supreme temptation, the goading of a\r\nmad desire, which bewildered all the women. The department had been\r\nturned into a white temple; tulles and guipures, falling from above,\r\nformed a white sky, one of those cloudy veils whose fine network pales\r\nthe morning sun. Round the columns descended flounces of Malines and\r\nValenciennes, white dancers\' skirts, unfolding in a snowy shiver to the\r\nfloor. Then on all sides, on every counter there were snowy masses of\r\nwhite Spanish blonde as light as air, Brussels with large flowers on a\r\ndelicate mesh, hand-made point, and Venice point with heavier designs,\r\nAlen\xc3\xa7on point, and Bruges of royal and almost sacred richness. It\r\nseemed as if the god of finery had here set up his white tabernacle.\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves, after wandering about before the counters for a long\r\ntime with her daughter, and feeling a sensual longing to plunge her\r\nhands into the goods, had just made up her mind to request Deloche to\r\nshow her some Alen\xc3\xa7on point. At first he brought out some imitation\r\nstuff; but she wished to see real Alen\xc3\xa7on, and was not satisfied\r\nwith narrow pieces at three hundred francs the yard, but insisted on\r\nexamining deep flounces at a thousand francs a yard and handkerchiefs\r\nand fans at seven and eight hundred francs. The counter was soon\r\ncovered with a fortune. In a corner of the department inspector Jouve\r\nwho had not lost sight of Madame de Boves, notwithstanding the latter\'s\r\napparent dawdling, stood amidst the crowd, with an indifferent air, but\r\nstill keeping a sharp eye on her.\r\n\r\n"Have you any capes in hand-made point?" she at last inquired; "show me\r\nsome, please."\r\n\r\nThe salesman, whom she had kept there for twenty minutes, dared not\r\nresist, for she appeared so aristocratic, with her imposing air and\r\nprincess\'s voice. However, he hesitated, for the employees were\r\ncautioned against heaping up these precious fabrics, and he had allowed\r\nhimself to be robbed of ten yards of Malines only the week before. But\r\nshe perturbed him, so he yielded, and abandoned the Alen\xc3\xa7on point for a\r\nmoment in order to take the lace she had asked for from a drawer.\r\n\r\n"Oh! look, mamma," said Blanche, who was ransacking a box close\r\nby, full of cheap Valenciennes, "we might take some of this for\r\npillow-cases."\r\n\r\nMadame de Boves did not reply and her daughter on turning her flabby\r\nface saw her, with her hands plunged amidst the lace, slipping some\r\nAlen\xc3\xa7on flounces up the sleeve of her mantle. Blanche did not appear\r\nsurprised, however, but moved forward instinctively to conceal her\r\nmother, when Jouve suddenly stood before them. He leant over, and\r\npolitely murmured in the countess\'s ear,\r\n\r\n"Have the kindness to follow me, madame."\r\n\r\nFor a moment she revolted: "But what for, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Have the kindness to follow me, madame," repeated the inspector,\r\nwithout raising his voice.\r\n\r\nWith her face full of anguish, she threw a rapid glance around her.\r\nThen all at once she resigned herself, resumed her haughty bearing,\r\nand walked away by his side like a queen who deigns to accept the\r\nservices of an aide-de-camp. Not one of the many customers had observed\r\nthe scene, and Deloche, on turning to the counter, looked at her as\r\nshe was walked off, his mouth wide open with astonishment. What! that\r\none as well! that noble-looking lady! Really it was time to have them\r\nall searched! And Blanche, who was left free, followed her mother at\r\na distance, lingering amidst the sea of faces, livid, and hesitating\r\nbetween the duty of not deserting her mother and the terror of being\r\ndetained with her. At last she saw her enter Bourdoncle\'s office, and\r\nthen contented herself with walking about near the door. Bourdoncle,\r\nwhom Mouret had just got rid of, happened to be there. As a rule,\r\nhe dealt with robberies of this sort when committed by persons of\r\ndistinction. Jouve had long been watching this lady, and had informed\r\nhim of it, so that he was not astonished when the inspector briefly\r\nexplained the matter to him; in fact, such extraordinary cases passed\r\nthrough his hands that he declared woman to be capable of anything,\r\nonce the passion for finery had seized upon her. As he was aware of\r\nMouret\'s acquaintance with the thief, he treated her with the utmost\r\npoliteness.\r\n\r\n"We excuse these moments of weakness, madame," said he. "But pray\r\nconsider the consequences of such a thing. Suppose some one else had\r\nseen you slip this lace----"\r\n\r\nBut she interrupted him in great indignation. She a thief! What\r\ndid he take her for? She was the Countess de Boves, her husband,\r\nInspector-General of the State Studs, was received at Court.\r\n\r\n"I know it, I know it, madame," repeated Bourdoncle, quietly. "I have\r\nthe honour of knowing you. In the first place, will you kindly give up\r\nthe lace you have on you?"\r\n\r\nBut, not allowing him to say another word she again protested, handsome\r\nin her violence, even shedding tears like some great lady vilely and\r\nwrongfully accused. Any one else but he would have been shaken and have\r\nfeared some deplorable mistake, for she threatened to go to law to\r\navenge such an insult.\r\n\r\n"Take care, sir, my husband will certainly appeal to the Minister."\r\n\r\n"Come, you are not more reasonable than the others," declared\r\nBourdoncle, losing patience. "We must search you."\r\n\r\nStill she did not yield, but with superb assurance, declared: "Very\r\ngood, search me. But I warn you, you are risking your house."\r\n\r\nJouve went to fetch two saleswomen from the corset department. When\r\nhe returned, he informed Bourdoncle that the lady\'s daughter, left at\r\nliberty, had not quitted the doorway, and asked if she also should be\r\ndetained, although he had not seen her take anything. The manager,\r\nhowever, who always did things in a fitting way, decided that she\r\nshould not be brought in, in order not to cause her mother to blush\r\nbefore her. The two men retired into a neighbouring room, whilst the\r\nsaleswomen searched the countess. Besides the twelve yards of Alen\xc3\xa7on\r\npoint at a thousand francs the yard concealed in her sleeve, they found\r\nupon her a handkerchief, a fan, and a cravat, making a total of about\r\nfourteen thousand francs\' worth of lace. She had been stealing like\r\nthis for the last year, ravaged by a furious, irresistible passion\r\nfor dress. These fits got worse, growing daily, sweeping away all the\r\nreasonings of prudence; and the enjoyment she felt in the indulgence\r\nof them was the more violent from the fact that she was risking before\r\nthe eyes of a crowd her name, her pride, and her husband\'s high\r\nposition. Now that the latter allowed her to empty his drawers, she\r\nstole although she had her pockets full of money, she stole for the\r\nmere pleasure of stealing, goaded on by desire, urged on by the species\r\nof kleptomania which her unsatisfied luxurious tastes had formerly\r\ndeveloped in her at sight of the vast brutal temptations of the big\r\nshops.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The manager of one of the great London drapery houses was telling\r\nme, recently, that the same kind of thing is far less infrequent than\r\nmight be imagined among certain English women of fashion. And he added\r\nthat these affairs are as a rule hushed up, even as they are hushed up\r\nin Paris. _Trans._\r\n\r\n"It\'s a trap," cried she, when Bourdoncle and Jouve came in. "This lace\r\nwas placed on me, I swear it before Heaven."\r\n\r\nShe was now shedding tears of rage, and fell on a chair, suffocating.\r\nBourdoncle sent the saleswomen away and resumed, with his quiet air:\r\n"We are quite willing, madame, to hush up this painful affair for the\r\nsake of your family. But you must first sign a paper thus worded:\r\n\'I have stolen some lace from The Ladies\' Paradise,\' followed by\r\nparticulars of the lace, and the date. However, I shall be happy to\r\nreturn you this document whenever you like to bring me a sum of two\r\nthousand francs for the poor."\r\n\r\nShe again rose and declared in a fresh outburst: "I\'ll never sign that,\r\nI\'d rather die."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t die, madame; but I warn you that I shall shortly send for\r\nthe police."\r\n\r\nThen followed a frightful scene. She insulted him, she stammered that\r\nit was cowardly for a man to torture a woman in that way. Her Juno-like\r\nbeauty, her tall majestic person was distorted by vulgar rage. Then she\r\ntried to soften him and Jouve, entreating them in the name of their\r\nmothers, and speaking of dragging herself at their feet. And as they,\r\nhowever, remained quite unmoved, hardened by custom, she all at once\r\nsat down and began to write with a trembling hand. The pen sputtered;\r\nthe words "I have stolen," madly, wildly written, went almost through\r\nthe thin paper, whilst she repeated in a choking voice: "There, sir,\r\nthere. I yield to force."\r\n\r\nBourdoncle took the paper, carefully folded it, and put it in a drawer,\r\nsaying: "You see it\'s in company; for ladies, after talking of dying\r\nrather than signing, generally forget to come and redeem these _billets\r\ndoux_ of theirs. However, I hold it at your disposal. You\'ll be able to\r\njudge whether it\'s worth two thousand francs."\r\n\r\nBut now that she had paid the forfeit she became as arrogant as ever.\r\n"I can go now?" she asked, in a sharp tone.\r\n\r\nBourdoncle was already occupied with other business. On Jouve\'s report,\r\nhe decided on the dismissal of Deloche, a stupid fellow, who was always\r\nbeing robbed and who never had any authority over customers. Madame\r\nde Boves repeated her question, and as they dismissed her with an\r\naffirmative nod, she enveloped both of them in a murderous glance. Of\r\nthe flood of insulting words that she kept back, one melodramatic cry\r\nescaped her lips. "Wretches!" said she, banging the door after her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Blanche had not strayed far from the office. Her ignorance\r\nof what was going on inside and the coming and going of Jouve and the\r\ntwo saleswomen frightened her; she had visions of the police, the\r\nassize court, and the prison. But all at once she stopped short: for\r\nVallagnosc was before her, that husband whom she had married but a\r\nmonth previously, and with whom she still felt rather awkward. And he\r\nquestioned her, astonished at her bewildered appearance.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your mother? Have you lost each other? Come, tell me, you make\r\nme feel anxious."\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of a colourable fiction presented itself to her\r\nmind, and in great distress she told him everything in a low voice:\r\n"Mamma, mamma--she has been stealing."\r\n\r\n"What! stealing?" At last he understood. His wife\'s bloated, livid\r\ncountenance, ravaged by fear, terrified him.\r\n\r\n"Some lace, like that, up her sleeve," she continued stammering.\r\n\r\n"You saw her, then? You were looking on?" he murmured, chilled to feel\r\nthat she had been a sort of accomplice.\r\n\r\nThey had to stop talking as several persons were already turning round.\r\nHesitation full of anguish kept Vallagnosc motionless for a moment.\r\nWhat was to be done? He had made up his mind to go into Bourdoncle\'s\r\noffice, when he perceived Mouret crossing the gallery. Thereupon,\r\nafter telling his wife to wait for him, he caught hold of his old\r\nfriend\'s arm and informed him of the affair, in broken sentences. The\r\nlatter hastily took him into his office, where he soon put him at\r\nrest as to the possible consequences. He assured him that he need not\r\ninterfere, and without appearing at all excited about this robbery,\r\nas if he had foreseen it long ago, he explained in what way it would\r\nall be arranged. Vallagnosc, however, even when he no longer feared\r\nan immediate arrest, did not accept the affair with this admirable\r\ncoolness. He had thrown himself into an arm-chair, and now that he\r\ncould discuss the matter, began to lament his own unfortunate position.\r\nWas it possible that he had married into a family of thieves? A stupid\r\nmarriage that he had drifted into, just to please his wife\'s father!\r\nSurprised by his childish violence, Mouret watched him weeping,\r\nthinking the while of his former pessimist boasting. Had he not scores\r\nof times proclaimed the nothingness of life, in which wrong-doing alone\r\nhad any attraction? And by way of diversion Mouret amused himself for\r\na minute, by preaching indifference to his friend, in a friendly,\r\nbantering tone. But at this Vallagnosc got angry: he was quite unable\r\nto recover his philosophy, and with his middle-class breeding burst\r\ninto virtuously indignant cries against his mother-in-law. As soon\r\nas trouble fell on himself, as soon as he was just touched by human\r\nsuffering, at which he had always coldly laughed, the boastful sceptic\r\ncollapsed and bled. It was abominable, they were dragging the honour of\r\nhis race into the gutter, the world seemed to be coming to an end.\r\n\r\n"Come, calm yourself," concluded Mouret, stricken with pity. "I won\'t\r\ntell you that everything happens and nothing happens, because that does\r\nnot seem to comfort you just now. But I think that you ought to go and\r\noffer your arm to Madame de Boves--that would be more sensible than\r\ncausing a scandal. The deuce! to think of it, you who professed such\r\nscorn for the universal rascality of the present day!"\r\n\r\n"Of course," cried Vallagnosc, innocently, "when it is a question of\r\nother people!"\r\n\r\nHowever, he got up, and followed his old school-fellow\'s advice.\r\nBoth were returning to the gallery when Madame de Boves came out of\r\nBourdoncle\'s office. She accepted her son-in-law\'s arm with a majestic\r\nair, and as Mouret bowed to her with respectful gallantry, he heard\r\nher saying: "They\'ve apologized to me. Really, these mistakes are\r\nabominable."\r\n\r\nBlanche joined them, and they soon disappeared in the crowd. Then\r\nMouret, alone and pensive, crossed the shop once more. This scene,\r\nwhich had diverted his thoughts from the struggle going on within him,\r\nnow increased his fever, and decided him to make a supreme effort. A\r\nvague connection arose in his mind: the robbery perpetrated by that\r\nunfortunate woman, that last folly of the conquered customer laid low\r\nat the feet of the tempter, evoked the proud and avenging image of\r\nDenise, whose victorious heel he could feel upon his throat. He stopped\r\nat the top of the central staircase, and gazed for a long time into the\r\nimmense nave, where his nation of women was swarming.\r\n\r\nSix o\'clock was about to strike, the daylight decreasing out-of-doors\r\nwas gradually forsaking the covered galleries, already dim, and even\r\nwaning in the halls which gloom was slowly invading. And in this\r\nuncertain glimmer, the electric lamps lighted up one by one, their\r\nglobes of an opaque whiteness studding with moons the distant depths\r\nof the departments. It was a white brightness of a blinding fixity,\r\nspreading like the radiance of a discoloured star and killing the\r\ntwilight. Then, when all were lighted, there came a delighted murmur\r\nfrom the crowd, and the great show of white goods assumed a fairy\r\nsplendour. It seemed as if this colossal orgie of white was also\r\nburning, itself becoming so much light. The song of the white seemed\r\nto soar upward in the flaming whiteness of an aurora. A white glimmer\r\ndarted from the linen and calico department in the Monsigny Gallery,\r\nlike the first bright streak which lights up the eastern sky; whilst\r\nalong the Michodi\xc3\xa8re Gallery, the mercery and the passementerie,\r\nthe fancy-goods and the ribbons threw out reflections of distant\r\nhills--with the white flash of mother-of-pearl buttons, silvered\r\nbronzes and sparkling beads. But the central nave especially was\r\nfilled with a blaze of white: the white muslin "puffings" round the\r\ncolumns, the white dimities and piqu\xc3\xa9s draping the staircases, the\r\nwhite counterpanes drooping like banners, the white guipures and laces\r\nflying in the air, opened up a firmament of dreamland, a vista of the\r\ndazzling whiteness of some paradise, where the marriage of an unknown\r\nqueen was being celebrated. The tent of the silk-hall was this heaven\'s\r\ngiant alcove, with white curtains, white gauzes and white tulles, whose\r\nshimmer screened the bride in her white nudity from the gaze of the\r\ncurious. There was now nothing but this blinding nucleus of white light\r\nin which all other whites were merged, this snowy starry dust twinkling\r\nin the clear radiance.\r\n\r\nAnd Mouret still continued to watch his nation of women, amidst the\r\nshimmering blaze. Their black shadows stood out vigorously against\r\nthe pale backgrounds. Long eddies would now and again part the crowd;\r\nthe fever of the day\'s great sale swept past like a frenzy through\r\nthe disorderly, billowy sea of heads. People were beginning to leave;\r\npillaged stuffs encumbered all the counters, and gold was chinking in\r\nthe tills whilst the customers went off, their purses emptied, and\r\ntheir heads turned by the wealth of luxury amidst which they had been\r\nwandering all day. It was he who possessed them thus, who held them at\r\nhis mercy by his continuous displays of novelties, his reductions of\r\nprices, and his "returns," his gallantry, puffery, and advertisements.\r\nHe had conquered even the mothers, he reigned over all with the\r\nbrutality of a despot, whose caprices ruined many a household. His\r\ncreation was a sort of new religion; the churches, gradually deserted\r\nby wavering faith, were replaced by his bazaar, in the minds of the\r\nidle women of Paris. Woman now came and spent her leisure time in his\r\nestablishment, those shivering anxious hours which she had formerly\r\npassed in churches: a necessary consumption of nervous passion, an\r\never renewed struggle of the god of dress against the husband, an\r\never renewed worship of the body with the promise of future divine\r\nbeauty. If he had closed his doors, there would have been a rising\r\nin the street, the despairing cry of worshippers deprived of their\r\nconfessional and altar! In their still growing passion for luxury, he\r\nsaw them, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour yet obstinately\r\nlingering in the huge iron building, on the suspended staircases and\r\nflying bridges. Madame Marty and her daughter, carried away to the\r\nhighest point, were wandering amongst the furniture. Madame Bourdelais,\r\nretained by her young people, could not get away from the fancy goods.\r\nAnd then came another group, Madame de Boves, still on Vallagnosc\'s\r\narm, and followed by Blanche, stopping in each department and still\r\ndaring to examine the goods with her superb air. But amidst the crowded\r\nsea of customers, that sea of bodies inflated with life and beating\r\nwith desire, one and all decorated with bunches of violets, as though\r\nfor the bridal of some sovereign, Mouret could now only distinguish the\r\nfigure of Madame Desforges, who had stopped in the glove department\r\nwith Madame Guibal. Despite her jealous rancour, she also was buying,\r\nand he felt himself to be the master once more, having them at his\r\nfeet, beneath the dazzle of the electric light, like a drove of cattle\r\nfrom which he had drawn his fortune.\r\n\r\nWith a mechanical step, Mouret went along the galleries, so absorbed\r\nthat he yielded to the pushing of the crowd. When he raised his head\r\nagain he found himself in the new millinery department, the windows\r\nof which overlooked the Rue du Dix-D\xc3\xa9cembre. And there, his forehead\r\nagainst the glass, he made another halt and watched the departure\r\nof the throng. The setting sun was tinging the roofs of the white\r\nhouses with yellow, the blue sky was growing paler, refreshed by a\r\npure breeze; whilst in the twilight, which was already enveloping the\r\nside-walks down below, the electric lamps of The Ladies\' Paradise threw\r\nforth the fixed glimmer of stars, lighted on the horizon at the decline\r\nof day. Towards the Opera-house and the Bourse were rows of waiting\r\nvehicles, the harness of the horses still presenting reflections of\r\nbright light, the gleam of a lamp, the glitter of a silver chain. At\r\neach minute the cry of a messenger was heard, and a cab drew near, or\r\na brougham came forth from the ranks, took up a customer and went off\r\nat a rapid trot. The rows of conveyances were now diminishing, six\r\nwent off at a time, occupying the whole street from one side to the\r\nother, amidst the banging of doors, the snapping of whips, and the\r\nhum of the passers-by, who swarmed between the wheels. There was a\r\nsort of continuous enlargement, a spreading of the customers, carried\r\noff to the four corners of the city, as the building emptied with the\r\nroaring clamour of a sluice. And the roof of The Ladies\' Paradise, the\r\nbig golden letters of the sky signs, the banners fluttering in the\r\nheavens, still flamed with the reflections of the setting sun, looking\r\nso colossal in the oblique light that they evoked the thought of some\r\nmonster of advertising, some phalansterium whose buildings, incessantly\r\nmultiplied, in turn covered up every district, as far as the distant\r\nwoods of the suburbs. And the spreading soul of Paris, in a huge but\r\ngentle breath, sank asleep in the serenity of the evening, hovering in\r\nprolonged, languid caresses over the last vehicles which were spinning\r\nthrough the streets, now slowly deserted by the crowd as it disappeared\r\ninto the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nMouret, gazing around, had just felt something grand in himself;\r\nbut, amid the quiver of triumph with which his flesh trembled, in\r\nface of Paris devoured and woman conquered, he experienced a sudden\r\nweakness, a defection of his strong will, by which in his turn he was\r\noverthrown beneath a superior force. It was an unreasonable longing to\r\nbe vanquished amidst his victory, the nonsense of a warrior bending\r\nbeneath the caprice of a child, on the morrow of his conquests. He who\r\nhad struggled for months, who even that morning had sworn to stifle his\r\npassion, all at once yielded, seized by the vertigo which overcomes one\r\non mountain heights, happy to commit what he looked upon as folly. His\r\ndecision, so rapidly arrived at, acquired in a minute such energy that\r\nhe saw nothing else useful and necessary in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after the last dinner, he sat waiting in his office,\r\ntrembling like a young man about to stake his life\'s happiness, unable\r\nto keep still but incessantly going towards the door to listen to the\r\nhubbub in the shop, where the employees, submerged to the shoulders in\r\na sea of stuffs, were now doing the folding up. At each footstep his\r\nheart beat. And all at once he experienced violent emotion, and rushed\r\nforward, for he had heard in the distance a deep murmur, which had\r\ngradually increased.\r\n\r\nIt was Lhomme slowly approaching with the day\'s receipts. That day they\r\nwere so heavy, there was such a quantity of silver and copper, that\r\nhe had been obliged to enlist the services of two messengers. Behind\r\nhim came Joseph and one of his colleagues, both bending beneath the\r\nweight of the bags, enormous bags, thrown on their shoulders like sacks\r\nof plaster, whilst he walked on in front with the notes and gold, a\r\nnote-book swollen with flimsies, and two bags hung round his neck, the\r\nweight of which made him sway to the right, the same side as his broken\r\narm. Slowly, perspiring and puffing, he had come from the other end of\r\nthe shop amidst the growing emotion of the salesmen. The employees in\r\nthe glove and silk departments had laughingly offered to relieve him of\r\nhis burden, the men in the drapery and woollen departments had longed\r\nto see him make a false step, which would have scattered the gold all\r\nover the place. Then he had been obliged to mount the stairs, and cross\r\na bridge and then go higher still, turning about amidst the longing\r\nlooks of the employees of the linen, hosiery, and mercery departments,\r\nwho gazed in ecstasy at this fortune travelling in the air. On the\r\nfirst-floor the mantle, perfumery, lace, and shawl employees were\r\nranged devoutly as for the passage of the Blessed Sacrament. And from\r\ncounter to counter a tumult arose, like the clamour of a nation bowing\r\ndown before the Golden Calf.\r\n\r\nMouret had opened the door, and Lhomme appeared, followed by the two\r\nmessengers, who were staggering; and, out of breath though he was, the\r\ncashier still had strength to cry out: "One million two hundred and\r\nforty-seven francs, nineteen sous!"\r\n\r\nAt last the million had been attained, that million picked up in\r\na day, of which Mouret had so long dreamed. But he gave way to an\r\nangry gesture, and with the disappointed air of a man disturbed by\r\nsome troublesome visitor, he impatiently exclaimed, "A million! very\r\ngood, put it there." Lhomme knew that he was fond of seeing the heavy\r\nreceipts on his table before they were taken to the central cash\r\noffice. The million covered the whole table, crushing the papers and\r\nalmost overturning the ink; and the gold and the silver and the copper\r\nrunning out of the sacks and bursting the leather bags, formed a great\r\nheap, the heap of the gross receipts, such as it came still warm and\r\npalpitating from the customers\' hands.\r\n\r\nJust as the cashier was going away, heart-broken at the governor\'s\r\nindifference, Bourdoncle arrived, gaily exclaiming: "Ah! we\'ve got it\r\nthis time. We\'ve hooked the million, eh?"\r\n\r\nBut on observing Mouret\'s febrile air he understood the situation and\r\ncalmed down. His face was beaming with delight; and after a short\r\nsilence he resumed: "You\'ve made up your mind, haven\'t you? Well, I\r\napprove your decision."\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, Mouret planted himself before him, and in his\r\nterrible voice thundered: "I say, my man, you\'re rather too lively. You\r\nthink me played out, don\'t you? and you feel hungry. But be careful,\r\nI\'m not one to be swallowed up, you know!"\r\n\r\nDiscountenanced by the sharp attack of this wonderful fellow, who\r\nguessed everything, Bourdoncle stammered: "What now? Are you joking? I\r\nwho have always admired you so much!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell lies!" replied Mouret, more violently than ever. "Just\r\nlisten, we were stupid to entertain the superstition that marriage\r\nwould ruin us. Why, is it not the necessary health, the very strength\r\nand order of life? Well, my dear fellow, I\'m going to marry her, and\r\nI\'ll pitch you all out of doors at the slightest movement. Yes, you\'ll\r\ngo and get paid like the rest, Bourdoncle."\r\n\r\nAnd with a gesture he dismissed him. Bourdoncle felt himself condemned,\r\nswept away, in this victory gained by woman. He went off. Denise was\r\njust coming in, and he bowed to her with profound respect, his head\r\nswimming.\r\n\r\n"Ah! you\'ve come at last!" said Mouret gently.\r\n\r\nDenise was pale with emotion. She had just experienced another grief,\r\nDeloche had informed her of his dismissal, and when she had tried\r\nto retain him, offering to speak in his favour, he had obstinately\r\ndeclined to struggle against his bad luck; he wanted to disappear, he\r\nsaid, what was the use of staying? Why should he interfere with people\r\nwho were happy? Then Denise had bade him a sisterly farewell, her\r\neyes full of tears. Did she not herself long to sink into oblivion?\r\nEverything was now about to finish, and she asked nothing more of her\r\nexhausted strength than the courage to insist on the separation. In a\r\nfew minutes, if she could only be valiant enough to crush her heart,\r\nshe would be able to go away alone, and weep unseen.\r\n\r\n"You wished to see me, sir," she said in her calm voice. "In fact, I\r\nintended to come and thank you for all your kindness to me."\r\n\r\nOn entering, she had perceived the million on the table, and the\r\ndisplay of that money wounded her. Above her, as if watching the scene,\r\nwas the portrait of Madame H\xc3\xa9douin, in its gilded frame, and with the\r\neternal smile of its painted lips.\r\n\r\n"You are still resolved to leave us?" asked Mouret, in a trembling\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I must."\r\n\r\nThen he took her hands, and, in an outburst of tenderness, after the\r\nlong coldness he had imposed on himself exclaimed: "And if I asked you\r\nto marry me, Denise, would you still leave?"\r\n\r\nBut she rapidly drew her hands away, struggling as if under the\r\ninfluence of a great grief. "Oh! Monsieur Mouret! Pray say no more.\r\nOh! don\'t cause me even greater pain than before! I cannot! I cannot!\r\nHeaven is my witness that I was going away to avoid such a misfortune!"\r\n\r\nShe continued to defend herself in broken sentences. Had she not\r\nalready suffered too much from the gossip of the house? Did he wish her\r\nto pass in the eyes of others and his own for a worthless woman? No,\r\nno, she would be strong, she would certainly prevent him doing such a\r\nfoolish thing. He, tortured, listened to her, repeating in a passionate\r\ntone: "I wish it. I wish it!"\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s impossible. And my brothers? I have sworn not to marry. I\r\ncannot bring you those children, can I?"\r\n\r\n"They shall be my brothers, too. Say yes, Denise."\r\n\r\n"No, no, leave me. You are torturing me!"\r\n\r\nLittle by little he was losing his strength; this last obstacle drove\r\nhim frantic. What! She still refused even at this price! In the\r\ndistance he heard the clamour of his three thousand employees building\r\nup his immense fortune. And that idiotic million lying there! He\r\nsuffered from it as from a sort of irony, he could have kicked it into\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n"Go, then!" he cried at last in a flood of tears. "Go and join the man\r\nyou love. That\'s the reason, isn\'t it? You warned me, I ought to have\r\nknown it, and not have tormented you any further."\r\n\r\nShe stood there thunderstruck by the violence of this despair. Her own\r\nheart was bursting. And then, with the impetuosity of a child, she\r\nthrew herself on his neck, sobbing also, and stammering: "Oh! Monsieur\r\nMouret, it\'s you I love!"\r\n\r\nA last murmur was rising from The Ladies\' Paradise, the distant\r\nacclamation of a multitude. Madame H\xc3\xa9douin\'s portrait was still\r\nsmiling, with its painted lips; Mouret had fallen on his table, on\r\nthe million which he could no longer see. He did not quit Denise, but\r\nclasped her to his breast in a desperate embrace, telling her that she\r\nmight now go, that she could spend a month at Valognes which would\r\nsilence everybody, and that then he would go to fetch her himself, and\r\nbring her back, all-powerful, as his wedded wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ladies\' Paradise, by \xc3\x89mile Zola\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LADIES\' PARADISE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 54726-0.txt or 54726-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/4/7/2/54726/\r\n\r\nProduced by Dagny & Marc D\'Hooghe at Free Literature (online\r\nsoon in an extended version, also linking to free sources\r\nfor education worldwide ...

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
