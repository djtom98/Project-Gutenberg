The series of novels I projected\r\nbeing mainly of the kind called local, they seemed to require a\r\nterritorial definition of some sort to lend unity to their scene.\r\nFinding that the area of a single county did not afford a canvas large\r\nenough for this purpose, and that there were objections to an invented\r\nname, I disinterred the old one. The press and the public were kind\r\nenough to welcome the fanciful plan, and willingly joined me in the\r\nanachronism of imagining a Wessex population living under Queen\r\nVictoria;\xe2\x80\x94a modern Wessex of railways, the penny post, mowing and\r\nreaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer matches, labourers who\r\ncould read and write, and National school children. But I believe I am\r\ncorrect in stating that, until the existence of this contemporaneous\r\nWessex was announced in the present story, in 1874, it had never been\r\nheard of, and that the expression, \xe2\x80\x9ca Wessex peasant,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca Wessex\r\ncustom,\xe2\x80\x9d would theretofore have been taken to refer to nothing later in\r\ndate than the Norman Conquest.\r\n\r\nI did not anticipate that this application of the word to a modern use\r\nwould extend outside the chapters of my own chronicles. But the name\r\nwas soon taken up elsewhere as a local designation. The first to do so\r\nwas the now defunct _Examiner_, which, in the impression bearing date\r\nJuly 15, 1876, entitled one of its articles \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wessex Labourer,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\narticle turning out to be no dissertation on farming during the\r\nHeptarchy, but on the modern peasant of the south-west counties, and\r\nhis presentation in these stories.\r\n\r\nSince then the appellation which I had thought to reserve to the\r\nhorizons and landscapes of a merely realistic dream-country, has become\r\nmore and more popular as a practical definition; and the dream-country\r\nhas, by degrees, solidified into a utilitarian region which people can\r\ngo to, take a house in, and write to the papers from. But I ask all\r\ngood and gentle readers to be so kind as to forget this, and to refuse\r\nsteadfastly to believe that there are any inhabitants of a Victorian\r\nWessex outside the pages of this and the companion volumes in which\r\nthey were first discovered.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the village called Weatherbury, wherein the scenes of the\r\npresent story of the series are for the most part laid, would perhaps\r\nbe hardly discernible by the explorer, without help, in any existing\r\nplace nowadays; though at the time, comparatively recent, at which the\r\ntale was written, a sufficient reality to meet the descriptions, both\r\nof backgrounds and personages, might have been traced easily enough.\r\nThe church remains, by great good fortune, unrestored and intact, and a\r\nfew of the old houses; but the ancient malt-house, which was formerly\r\nso characteristic of the parish, has been pulled down these twenty\r\nyears; also most of the thatched and dormered cottages that were once\r\nlifeholds. The game of prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s base, which not so long ago seemed to\r\nenjoy a perennial vitality in front of the worn-out stocks, may, so far\r\nas I can say, be entirely unknown to the rising generation of\r\nschoolboys there. The practice of divination by Bible and key, the\r\nregarding of valentines as things of serious import, the\r\nshearing-supper, and the harvest-home, have, too, nearly disappeared in\r\nthe wake of the old houses; and with them have gone, it is said, much\r\nof that love of fuddling to which the village at one time was\r\nnotoriously prone. The change at the root of this has been the recent\r\nsupplanting of the class of stationary cottagers, who carried on the\r\nlocal traditions and humours, by a population of more or less migratory\r\nlabourers, which has led to a break of continuity in local history,\r\nmore fatal than any other thing to the preservation of legend,\r\nfolk-lore, close inter-social relations, and eccentric individualities.\r\nFor these the indispensable conditions of existence are attachment to\r\nthe soil of one particular spot by generation after generation.\r\n\r\nT. H.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1895\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nDescription of Farmer Oak\xe2\x80\x94An Incident\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth spread till they were\r\nwithin an unimportant distance of his ears, his eyes were reduced to\r\nchinks, and diverging wrinkles appeared round them, extending upon his\r\ncountenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun.\r\n\r\nHis Christian name was Gabriel, and on working days he was a young man\r\nof sound judgment, easy motions, proper dress, and general good\r\ncharacter. On Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to\r\npostponing, and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella: upon the\r\nwhole, one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of\r\nLaodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the\r\nparish and the drunken section,\xe2\x80\x94that is, he went to church, but yawned\r\nprivately by the time the congregation reached the Nicene creed, and\r\nthought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening\r\nto the sermon. Or, to state his character as it stood in the scale of\r\npublic opinion, when his friends and critics were in tantrums, he was\r\nconsidered rather a bad man; when they were pleased, he was rather a\r\ngood man; when they were neither, he was a man whose moral colour was a\r\nkind of pepper-and-salt mixture.\r\n\r\nSince he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays, Oak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own\xe2\x80\x94the mental\r\npicture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed\r\nin that way. He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out at the base by\r\ntight jamming upon the head for security in high winds, and a coat like\r\nDr. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s; his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather\r\nleggings and boots emphatically large, affording to each foot a roomy\r\napartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day\r\nlong and know nothing of damp\xe2\x80\x94their maker being a conscientious man who\r\nendeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted\r\ndimension and solidity.\r\n\r\nMr. Oak carried about him, by way of watch, what may be called a small\r\nsilver clock; in other words, it was a watch as to shape and intention,\r\nand a small clock as to size. This instrument being several years older\r\nthan Oak\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, had the peculiarity of going either too fast or\r\nnot at all. The smaller of its hands, too, occasionally slipped round\r\non the pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with precision,\r\nnobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to. The\r\nstopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes,\r\nand he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by\r\nconstant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars, and by\r\npressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 windows, till\r\nhe could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within.\r\nIt may be mentioned that Oak\xe2\x80\x99s fob being difficult of access, by reason\r\nof its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers (which\r\nalso lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch was as a\r\nnecessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side, compressing the\r\nmouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion\r\nrequired, and drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBut some thoughtful persons, who had seen him walking across one of his\r\nfields on a certain December morning\xe2\x80\x94sunny and exceedingly mild\xe2\x80\x94might\r\nhave regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these. In his face one\r\nmight notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on\r\nto manhood: there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of\r\nthe boy. His height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his\r\npresence imposing, had they been exhibited with due consideration. But\r\nthere is a way some men have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind\r\nis more responsible than flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing\r\ntheir dimensions by their manner of showing them. And from a quiet\r\nmodesty that would have become a vestal, which seemed continually to\r\nimpress upon him that he had no great claim on the world\xe2\x80\x99s room, Oak\r\nwalked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct\r\nfrom a bowing of the shoulders. This may be said to be a defect in an\r\nindividual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance\r\nthan upon his capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.\r\n\r\nHe had just reached the time of life at which \xe2\x80\x9cyoung\xe2\x80\x9d is ceasing to be\r\nthe prefix of \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d in speaking of one. He was at the brightest period\r\nof masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were clearly\r\nseparated: he had passed the time during which the influence of youth\r\nindiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse, and he had\r\nnot yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again, in the\r\ncharacter of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family. In\r\nshort, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.\r\n\r\nThe field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe\r\nHill. Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and\r\nChalk-Newton. Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming down the\r\nincline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted yellow and\r\ngaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking alongside bearing\r\na whip perpendicularly. The waggon was laden with household goods and\r\nwindow plants, and on the apex of the whole sat a woman, young and\r\nattractive. Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a\r\nminute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said the waggoner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I heard it fall,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, in a soft, though not\r\nparticularly low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard a noise I could not account for when\r\nwe were coming up the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll run back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nThe sensible horses stood\xe2\x80\x94perfectly still, and the waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s steps\r\nsank fainter and fainter in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe girl on the summit of the load sat motionless, surrounded by tables\r\nand chairs with their legs upwards, backed by an oak settle, and\r\nornamented in front by pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses,\r\ntogether with a caged canary\xe2\x80\x94all probably from the windows of the house\r\njust vacated. There was also a cat in a willow basket, from the\r\npartly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and\r\naffectionately surveyed the small birds around.\r\n\r\nThe handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the only\r\nsound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up and down\r\nthe perches of its prison. Then she looked attentively downwards. It\r\nwas not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong package tied\r\nin paper, and lying between them. She turned her head to learn if the\r\nwaggoner were coming. He was not yet in sight; and her eyes crept back\r\nto the package, her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it. At\r\nlength she drew the article into her lap, and untied the paper\r\ncovering; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed, in which she\r\nproceeded to survey herself attentively. She parted her lips and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the\r\ncrimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face\r\nand dark hair. The myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her\r\nwere fresh and green, and at such a leafless season they invested the\r\nwhole concern of horses, waggon, furniture, and girl with a peculiar\r\nvernal charm. What possessed her to indulge in such a performance in\r\nthe sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were\r\nalone its spectators,\xe2\x80\x94whether the smile began as a factitious one, to\r\ntest her capacity in that art,\xe2\x80\x94nobody knows; it ended certainly in a\r\nreal smile. She blushed at herself, and seeing her reflection blush,\r\nblushed the more.\r\n\r\nThe change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an\r\nact\xe2\x80\x94from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of\r\ndoors\xe2\x80\x94lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess.\r\nThe picture was a delicate one. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptive infirmity had\r\nstalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the freshness of an\r\noriginality. A cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he\r\nregarded the scene, generous though he fain would have been. There was\r\nno necessity whatever for her looking in the glass. She did not adjust\r\nher hat, or pat her hair, or press a dimple into shape, or do one thing\r\nto signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the\r\nglass. She simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the\r\nfeminine kind, her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely\r\ndramas in which men would play a part\xe2\x80\x94vistas of probable triumphs\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsmiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost\r\nand won. Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of\r\nactions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that\r\nintention had any part in them at all.\r\n\r\nThe waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s steps were heard returning. She put the glass in the\r\npaper, and the whole again into its place.\r\n\r\nWhen the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of\r\nespial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the\r\nturnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the object\r\nof his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll. About twenty\r\nsteps still remained between him and the gate, when he heard a dispute.\r\nIt was a difference concerning twopence between the persons with the\r\nwaggon and the man at the toll-bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99s niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough that I\xe2\x80\x99ve offered ye, you great miser, and she won\xe2\x80\x99t pay any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d These were the waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; then mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99s niece can\xe2\x80\x99t pass,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnpike-keeper,\r\nclosing the gate.\r\n\r\nOak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into a\r\nreverie. There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably\r\ninsignificant. Threepence had a definite value as money\xe2\x80\x94it was an\r\nappreciable infringement on a day\xe2\x80\x99s wages, and, as such, a higgling\r\nmatter; but twopence\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, stepping forward and handing\r\ntwopence to the gatekeeper; \xe2\x80\x9clet the young woman pass.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked up at\r\nher then; she heard his words, and looked down.\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the\r\nmiddle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas\r\nIscariot, as represented in a window of the church he attended, that\r\nnot a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of\r\ndistinction or notoriety. The red-jacketed and dark-haired maiden\r\nseemed to think so too, for she carelessly glanced over him, and told\r\nher man to drive on. She might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a\r\nminute scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she felt none,\r\nfor in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point, and we know how\r\nwomen take a favour of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome\r\nmaid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she has her faults,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, farmer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the greatest of them is\xe2\x80\x94well, what it is always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeating people down? ay, \xe2\x80\x99tis so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel, perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference, glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance\r\nover the hedge, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cVanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nNIGHT\xe2\x80\x94THE FLOCK\xe2\x80\x94AN INTERIOR\xe2\x80\x94ANOTHER INTERIOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s, the shortest day in\r\nthe year. A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill\r\nwhereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the\r\nsunshine of a few days earlier.\r\n\r\nNorcombe Hill\xe2\x80\x94not far from lonely Toller-Down\xe2\x80\x94was one of the spots\r\nwhich suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape\r\napproaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth.\r\nIt was a featureless convexity of chalk and soil\xe2\x80\x94an ordinary specimen\r\nof those smoothly-outlined protuberances of the globe which may remain\r\nundisturbed on some great day of confusion, when far grander heights\r\nand dizzy granite precipices topple down.\r\n\r\nThe hill was covered on its northern side by an ancient and decaying\r\nplantation of beeches, whose upper verge formed a line over the crest,\r\nfringing its arched curve against the sky, like a mane. To-night these\r\ntrees sheltered the southern slope from the keenest blasts, which smote\r\nthe wood and floundered through it with a sound as of grumbling, or\r\ngushed over its crowning boughs in a weakened moan. The dry leaves in\r\nthe ditch simmered and boiled in the same breezes, a tongue of air\r\noccasionally ferreting out a few, and sending them spinning across the\r\ngrass. A group or two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude\r\nhad remained till this very mid-winter time on the twigs which bore\r\nthem and in falling rattled against the trunks with smart taps.\r\n\r\nBetween this half-wooded half-naked hill, and the vague still horizon\r\nthat its summit indistinctly commanded, was a mysterious sheet of\r\nfathomless shade\xe2\x80\x94the sounds from which suggested that what it concealed\r\nbore some reduced resemblance to features here. The thin grasses, more\r\nor less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in breezes of\r\ndiffering powers, and almost of differing natures\xe2\x80\x94one rubbing the\r\nblades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing them\r\nlike a soft broom. The instinctive act of humankind was to stand and\r\nlisten, and learn how the trees on the right and the trees on the left\r\nwailed or chaunted to each other in the regular antiphonies of a\r\ncathedral choir; how hedges and other shapes to leeward then caught the\r\nnote, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and how the hurrying gust then\r\nplunged into the south, to be heard no more.\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear\xe2\x80\x94remarkably clear\xe2\x80\x94and the twinkling of all the stars\r\nseemed to be but throbs of one body, timed by a common pulse. The North\r\nStar was directly in the wind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and since evening the Bear had\r\nswung round it outwardly to the east, till he was now at a right angle\r\nwith the meridian. A difference of colour in the stars\xe2\x80\x94oftener read of\r\nthan seen in England\xe2\x80\x94was really perceptible here. The sovereign\r\nbrilliancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a steely glitter, the star\r\ncalled Capella was yellow, Aldebaran and Betelgueux shone with a fiery\r\nred.\r\n\r\nTo persons standing alone on a hill during a clear midnight such as\r\nthis, the roll of the world eastward is almost a palpable movement. The\r\nsensation may be caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past\r\nearthly objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stillness, or\r\nby the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, or by the wind,\r\nor by the solitude; but whatever be its origin, the impression of\r\nriding along is vivid and abiding. The poetry of motion is a phrase\r\nmuch in use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it is\r\nnecessary to stand on a hill at a small hour of the night, and, having\r\nfirst expanded with a sense of difference from the mass of civilised\r\nmankind, who are dreamwrapt and disregardful of all such proceedings at\r\nthis time, long and quietly watch your stately progress through the\r\nstars. After such a nocturnal reconnoitre it is hard to get back to\r\nearth, and to believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding\r\nis derived from a tiny human frame.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an unexpected series of sounds began to be heard in this place\r\nup against the sky. They had a clearness which was to be found nowhere\r\nin the wind, and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in nature.\r\nThey were the notes of Farmer Oak\xe2\x80\x99s flute.\r\n\r\nThe tune was not floating unhindered into the open air: it seemed\r\nmuffled in some way, and was altogether too curtailed in power to\r\nspread high or wide. It came from the direction of a small dark object\r\nunder the plantation hedge\xe2\x80\x94a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hut\xe2\x80\x94now presenting an outline\r\nto which an uninitiated person might have been puzzled to attach either\r\nmeaning or use.\r\n\r\nThe image as a whole was that of a small Noah\xe2\x80\x99s Ark on a small Ararat,\r\nallowing the traditionary outlines and general form of the Ark which\r\nare followed by toy-makers\xe2\x80\x94and by these means are established in men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimaginations among their firmest, because earliest impressions\xe2\x80\x94to pass\r\nas an approximate pattern. The hut stood on little wheels, which raised\r\nits floor about a foot from the ground. Such shepherds\xe2\x80\x99 huts are\r\ndragged into the fields when the lambing season comes on, to shelter\r\nthe shepherd in his enforced nightly attendance.\r\n\r\nIt was only latterly that people had begun to call Gabriel \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nOak. During the twelvemonth preceding this time he had been enabled by\r\nsustained efforts of industry and chronic good spirits to lease the\r\nsmall sheep-farm of which Norcombe Hill was a portion, and stock it\r\nwith two hundred sheep. Previously he had been a bailiff for a short\r\ntime, and earlier still a shepherd only, having from his childhood\r\nassisted his father in tending the flocks of large proprietors, till\r\nold Gabriel sank to rest.\r\n\r\nThis venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of farming as master\r\nand not as man, with an advance of sheep not yet paid for, was a\r\ncritical juncture with Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position\r\nclearly. The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of his\r\newes, and sheep having been his speciality from his youth, he wisely\r\nrefrained from deputing the task of tending them at this season to a\r\nhireling or a novice.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut, but the\r\nflute-playing ceased. A rectangular space of light appeared in the side\r\nof the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak\xe2\x80\x99s figure. He\r\ncarried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door behind him, came\r\nforward and busied himself about this nook of the field for nearly\r\ntwenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and disappearing here and\r\nthere, and brightening him or darkening him as he stood before or\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\nOak\xe2\x80\x99s motions, though they had a quiet energy, were slow, and their\r\ndeliberateness accorded well with his occupation. Fitness being the\r\nbasis of beauty, nobody could have denied that his steady swings and\r\nturns in and about the flock had elements of grace. Yet, although if\r\noccasion demanded he could do or think a thing with as mercurial a dash\r\nas can the men of towns who are more to the manner born, his special\r\npower, morally, physically, and mentally, was static, owing little or\r\nnothing to momentum as a rule.\r\n\r\nA close examination of the ground hereabout, even by the wan starlight\r\nonly, revealed how a portion of what would have been casually called a\r\nwild slope had been appropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose\r\nthis winter. Detached hurdles thatched with straw were stuck into the\r\nground at various scattered points, amid and under which the whitish\r\nforms of his meek ewes moved and rustled. The ring of the sheep-bell,\r\nwhich had been silent during his absence, recommenced, in tones that\r\nhad more mellowness than clearness, owing to an increasing growth of\r\nsurrounding wool. This continued till Oak withdrew again from the\r\nflock. He returned to the hut, bringing in his arms a new-born lamb,\r\nconsisting of four legs large enough for a full-grown sheep, united by\r\na seemingly inconsiderable membrane about half the substance of the\r\nlegs collectively, which constituted the animal\xe2\x80\x99s entire body just at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small\r\nstove, where a can of milk was simmering. Oak extinguished the lantern\r\nby blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being lighted\r\nby a candle suspended by a twisted wire. A rather hard couch, formed of\r\na few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered half the floor of this\r\nlittle habitation, and here the young man stretched himself along,\r\nloosened his woollen cravat, and closed his eyes. In about the time a\r\nperson unaccustomed to bodily labour would have decided upon which side\r\nto lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and\r\nalluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle,\r\nreflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach, flung\r\nassociations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools. In the corner\r\nstood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side were ranged\r\nbottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to ovine\r\nsurgery and physic; spirits of wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger,\r\nand castor-oil being the chief. On a triangular shelf across the corner\r\nstood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider, which was\r\nsupplied from a flagon beneath. Beside the provisions lay the flute,\r\nwhose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely watcher to\r\nbeguile a tedious hour. The house was ventilated by two round holes,\r\nlike the lights of a ship\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, with wood slides.\r\n\r\nThe lamb, revived by the warmth, began to bleat, and the sound entered\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s ears and brain with an instant meaning, as expected sounds\r\nwill. Passing from the profoundest sleep to the most alert wakefulness\r\nwith the same ease that had accompanied the reverse operation, he\r\nlooked at his watch, found that the hour-hand had shifted again, put on\r\nhis hat, took the lamb in his arms, and carried it into the darkness.\r\nAfter placing the little creature with its mother, he stood and\r\ncarefully examined the sky, to ascertain the time of night from the\r\naltitudes of the stars.\r\n\r\nThe Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restless Pleiades, were\r\nhalf-way up the Southern sky, and between them hung Orion, which\r\ngorgeous constellation never burnt more vividly than now, as it soared\r\nforth above the rim of the landscape. Castor and Pollux with their\r\nquiet shine were almost on the meridian: the barren and gloomy Square\r\nof Pegasus was creeping round to the north-west; far away through the\r\nplantation Vega sparkled like a lamp suspended amid the leafless trees,\r\nand Cassiopeia\xe2\x80\x99s chair stood daintily poised on the uppermost boughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nBeing a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some\r\ncharm in this life he led, he stood still after looking at the sky as a\r\nuseful instrument, and regarded it in an appreciative spirit, as a work\r\nof art superlatively beautiful. For a moment he seemed impressed with\r\nthe speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with the complete\r\nabstraction from all its compass of the sights and sounds of man. Human\r\nshapes, interferences, troubles, and joys were all as if they were not,\r\nand there seemed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no\r\nsentient being save himself; he could fancy them all gone round to the\r\nsunny side.\r\n\r\nOccupied thus, with eyes stretched afar, Oak gradually perceived that\r\nwhat he had previously taken to be a star low down behind the outskirts\r\nof the plantation was in reality no such thing. It was an artificial\r\nlight, almost close at hand.\r\n\r\nTo find themselves utterly alone at night where company is desirable\r\nand expected makes some people fearful; but a case more trying by far\r\nto the nerves is to discover some mysterious companionship when\r\nintuition, sensation, memory, analogy, testimony, probability,\r\ninduction\xe2\x80\x94every kind of evidence in the logician\xe2\x80\x99s list\xe2\x80\x94have united to\r\npersuade consciousness that it is quite in isolation.\r\n\r\nFarmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed through its lower\r\nboughs to the windy side. A dim mass under the slope reminded him that\r\na shed occupied a place here, the site being a cutting into the slope\r\nof the hill, so that at its back part the roof was almost level with\r\nthe ground. In front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered\r\nwith tar as a preservative. Through crevices in the roof and side\r\nspread streaks and dots of light, a combination of which made the\r\nradiance that had attracted him. Oak stepped up behind, where, leaning\r\ndown upon the roof and putting his eye close to a hole, he could see\r\ninto the interior clearly.\r\n\r\nThe place contained two women and two cows. By the side of the latter a\r\nsteaming bran-mash stood in a bucket. One of the women was past middle\r\nage. Her companion was apparently young and graceful; he could form no\r\ndecided opinion upon her looks, her position being almost beneath his\r\neye, so that he saw her in a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-eye view, as Milton\xe2\x80\x99s Satan first\r\nsaw Paradise. She wore no bonnet or hat, but had enveloped herself in a\r\nlarge cloak, which was carelessly flung over her head as a covering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder of the two, resting her\r\nknuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndo hope Daisy will fetch round again now. I have never been more\r\nfrightened in my life, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind breaking my rest if she\r\nrecovers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman, whose eyelids were apparently inclined to fall\r\ntogether on the smallest provocation of silence, yawned without parting\r\nher lips to any inconvenient extent, whereupon Gabriel caught the\r\ninfection and slightly yawned in sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we are not, we must do them ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other; \xe2\x80\x9cfor you\r\nmust help me if you stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my hat is gone, however,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cIt went over\r\nthe hedge, I think. The idea of such a slight wind catching it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cow standing erect was of the Devon breed, and was encased in a\r\ntight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely uniform from eyes to\r\ntail as if the animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her long\r\nback being mathematically level. The other was spotted, grey and white.\r\nBeside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old, looking\r\nidiotically at the two women, which showed that it had not long been\r\naccustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turning to the\r\nlantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon, inherited instinct\r\nhaving as yet had little time for correction by experience. Between the\r\nsheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill lately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better send for some oatmeal,\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder woman;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no more bran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, aunt; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride over for it as soon as it is light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no side-saddle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can ride on the other: trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak, upon hearing these remarks, became more curious to observe her\r\nfeatures, but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of\r\nthe cloak, and by his a\xc3\xabrial position, he felt himself drawing upon his\r\nfancy for their details. In making even horizontal and clear\r\ninspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us\r\nwhatever our eyes bring in. Had Gabriel been able from the first to get\r\na distinct view of her countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome\r\nor slightly so would have been as his soul required a divinity at the\r\nmoment or was ready supplied with one. Having for some time known the\r\nwant of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing void within him, his\r\nposition moreover affording the widest scope for his fancy, he painted\r\nher a beauty.\r\n\r\nBy one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature, like a busy\r\nmother, seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn\r\nand make her children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and forth\r\ntumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket. Oak knew her instantly\r\nas the heroine of the yellow waggon, myrtles, and looking-glass:\r\nprosily, as the woman who owed him twopence.\r\n\r\nThey placed the calf beside its mother again, took up the lantern, and\r\nwent out, the light sinking down the hill till it was no more than a\r\nnebula. Gabriel Oak returned to his flock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nA GIRL ON HORSEBACK\xe2\x80\x94CONVERSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sluggish day began to break. Even its position terrestrially is one\r\nof the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason save\r\nthat the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again into\r\nthe plantation. Lingering and musing here, he heard the steps of a\r\nhorse at the foot of the hill, and soon there appeared in view an\r\nauburn pony with a girl on its back, ascending by the path leading past\r\nthe cattle-shed. She was the young woman of the night before. Gabriel\r\ninstantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having lost in the\r\nwind; possibly she had come to look for it. He hastily scanned the\r\nditch and after walking about ten yards along it found the hat among\r\nthe leaves. Gabriel took it in his hand and returned to his hut. Here\r\nhe ensconced himself, and peeped through the loophole in the direction\r\nof the rider\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\r\n\r\nShe came up and looked around\xe2\x80\x94then on the other side of the hedge.\r\nGabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when an\r\nunexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for the\r\npresent. The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the plantation.\r\nIt was not a bridle-path\xe2\x80\x94merely a pedestrian\xe2\x80\x99s track, and the boughs\r\nspread horizontally at a height not greater than seven feet above the\r\nground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath them. The girl,\r\nwho wore no riding-habit, looked around for a moment, as if to assure\r\nherself that all humanity was out of view, then dexterously dropped\r\nbackwards flat upon the pony\xe2\x80\x99s back, her head over its tail, her feet\r\nagainst its shoulders, and her eyes to the sky. The rapidity of her\r\nglide into this position was that of a kingfisher\xe2\x80\x94its noiselessness\r\nthat of a hawk. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had scarcely been able to follow her.\r\nThe tall lank pony seemed used to such doings, and ambled along\r\nunconcerned. Thus she passed under the level boughs.\r\n\r\nThe performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\nits tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased\r\nwith the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt another, even\r\nmore obviously convenient than the first. She had no side-saddle, and\r\nit was very apparent that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath\r\nher was unattainable sideways. Springing to her accustomed\r\nperpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying herself that nobody\r\nwas in sight, she seated herself in the manner demanded by the saddle,\r\nthough hardly expected of the woman, and trotted off in the direction\r\nof Tewnell Mill.\r\n\r\nOak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and hanging up the hat in\r\nhis hut, went again among his ewes. An hour passed, the girl returned,\r\nproperly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of her. On nearing the\r\ncattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking-pail, who held the\r\nreins of the pony whilst she slid off. The boy led away the horse,\r\nleaving the pail with the young woman.\r\n\r\nSoon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular\r\nsuccession from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person milking\r\na cow. Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand, and waited beside the\r\npath she would follow in leaving the hill.\r\n\r\nShe came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left arm\r\nwas extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make Oak\r\nwish that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole would\r\nhave been revealed. There was a bright air and manner about her now, by\r\nwhich she seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could\r\nnot be questioned; and this rather saucy assumption failed in being\r\noffensive because a beholder felt it to be, upon the whole, true. Like\r\nexceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius, that which would have\r\nmade mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to recognised power. It was\r\nwith some surprise that she saw Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s face rising like the moon\r\nbehind the hedge.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s hazy conceptions of her charms to the\r\nportrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution\r\nthan a difference. The starting-point selected by the judgment was her\r\nheight. She seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the hedge\r\ndiminutive; hence, making allowance for error by comparison with these,\r\nshe could have been not above the height to be chosen by women as best.\r\nAll features of consequence were severe and regular. It may have been\r\nobserved by persons who go about the shires with eyes for beauty, that\r\nin Englishwoman a classically-formed face is seldom found to be united\r\nwith a figure of the same pattern, the highly-finished features being\r\ngenerally too large for the remainder of the frame; that a graceful and\r\nproportionate figure of eight heads usually goes off into random facial\r\ncurves. Without throwing a Nymphean tissue over a milkmaid, let it be\r\nsaid that here criticism checked itself as out of place, and looked at\r\nher proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure. From the\r\ncontours of her figure in its upper part, she must have had a beautiful\r\nneck and shoulders; but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them.\r\nHad she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her\r\nhead into a bush. Yet she was not a shy girl by any means; it was\r\nmerely her instinct to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen\r\nhigher than they do it in towns.\r\n\r\nThat the girl\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as she\r\ncaught Oak\xe2\x80\x99s eyes conning the same page was natural, and almost\r\ncertain. The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if a\r\nlittle more pronounced, dignity if a little less. Rays of male vision\r\nseem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural districts;\r\nshe brushed hers with her hand, as if Gabriel had been irritating its\r\npink surface by actual touch, and the free air of her previous\r\nmovements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of itself.\r\nYet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found a hat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to a\r\nsmall smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: \xe2\x80\x9cit flew away last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne o\xe2\x80\x99clock this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94it was.\xe2\x80\x9d She was surprised. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you know?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are Farmer Oak, are you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat or thereabouts. I\xe2\x80\x99m lately come to this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA large farm?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, casting her eyes round, and swinging back\r\nher hair, which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass; but it\r\nbeing now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves\r\nwith a colour of their own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not large. About a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d (In speaking of farms the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cacres\xe2\x80\x9d is omitted by the natives, by analogy to such old expressions\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9ca stag of ten.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted my hat this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to ride to Tewnell\r\nMill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired, a misgiving bringing every muscle of her\r\nlineaments and frame to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94going through the plantation, and all down the hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farmer\r\nOak, with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in\r\nhis mind, as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and\r\nthen turned back to meet his colloquist\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nA perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly\r\nas if he had been caught in a theft. Recollection of the strange antics\r\nshe had indulged in when passing through the trees was succeeded in the\r\ngirl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot face. It was a time to\r\nsee a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule; not a\r\npoint in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour. From the\r\nMaiden\xe2\x80\x99s Blush, through all varieties of the Provence down to the\r\nCrimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance quickly\r\ngraduated; whereupon he, in considerateness, turned away his head.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she\r\nwould recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again.\r\nHe heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze,\r\nand looked. She had gone away.\r\n\r\nWith an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFive mornings and evenings passed. The young woman came regularly to\r\nmilk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed\r\nher vision to stray in the direction of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s person. His want of tact\r\nhad deeply offended her\xe2\x80\x94not by seeing what he could not help, but by\r\nletting her know that he had seen it. For, as without law there is no\r\nsin, without eyes there is no indecorum; and she appeared to feel that\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s espial had made her an indecorous woman without her own\r\nconnivance. It was food for great regret with him; it was also a\r\n_contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he had experienced\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in a slow forgetting,\r\nbut for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week. One\r\nafternoon it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening,\r\nwhich drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time when\r\nin cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets; when\r\nround the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the sitters\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbacks are cold, even whilst their faces are all aglow. Many a small\r\nbird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.\r\n\r\nAs the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his usual watch upon the\r\ncowshed. At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of bedding\r\nround the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon\r\nthe stove. The wind came in at the bottom of the door, and to prevent\r\nit Oak laid a sack there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the\r\nsouth. Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating hole\xe2\x80\x94of which there\r\nwas one on each side of the hut.\r\n\r\nGabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door\r\nclosed one of these must be kept open\xe2\x80\x94that chosen being always on the\r\nside away from the wind. Closing the slide to windward, he turned to\r\nopen the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered that he would\r\nfirst sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two, till the\r\ntemperature of the hut was a little raised. He sat down.\r\n\r\nHis head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself\r\nweary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak\r\ndecided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall\r\nasleep. He fell asleep, however, without having performed the necessary\r\npreliminary.\r\n\r\nHow long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew. During the first\r\nstages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be in\r\ncourse of enactment. His dog was howling, his head was aching\r\nfearfully\xe2\x80\x94somebody was pulling him about, hands were loosening his\r\nneckerchief.\r\n\r\nOn opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange\r\nmanner of unexpectedness. The young girl with the remarkably pleasant\r\nlips and white teeth was beside him. More than this\xe2\x80\x94astonishingly\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94his head was upon her lap, his face and neck were disagreeably\r\nwet, and her fingers were unbuttoning his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, vacantly.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignificant a kind to\r\nstart enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing now,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9csince you are not dead. It is a wonder\r\nyou were not suffocated in this hut of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the hut!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave ten pounds for that hut. But\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll sell it, and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times,\r\nand curl up to sleep in a lock of straw! It played me nearly the same\r\ntrick the other day!\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel, by way of emphasis, brought down his\r\nfist upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not exactly the fault of the hut,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed in a tone which\r\nshowed her to be that novelty among women\xe2\x80\x94one who finished a thought\r\nbefore beginning the sentence which was to convey it. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should, I\r\nthink, have considered, and not have been so foolish as to leave the\r\nslides closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I suppose I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, absently. He was endeavouring to\r\ncatch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her, his head\r\nupon her dress, before the event passed on into the heap of bygone\r\nthings. He wished she knew his impressions; but he would as soon have\r\nthought of carrying an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the\r\nintangibilities of his feeling in the coarse meshes of language. So he\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nShe made him sit up, and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking\r\nhimself like a Samson. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank \xe2\x80\x99ee?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last,\r\ngratefully, some of the natural rusty red having returned to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, smiling, and allowing her smile\r\nto hold good for Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s next remark, whatever that might prove to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when I\r\ncame to the milking (it was so lucky, Daisy\xe2\x80\x99s milking is almost over\r\nfor the season, and I shall not come here after this week or the next).\r\nThe dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of my skirt. I\r\ncame across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the\r\nslides were closed. My uncle has a hut like this one, and I have heard\r\nhim tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open.\r\nI opened the door, and there you were like dead. I threw the milk over\r\nyou, as there was no water, forgetting it was warm, and no use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I should have died?\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said, in a low voice, which\r\nwas rather meant to travel back to himself than to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl replied. She seemed to prefer a less tragic\r\nprobability; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should\r\nharmonise with the dignity of such a deed\xe2\x80\x94and she shunned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you saved my life, Miss\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name. I know your\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s, but not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would just as soon not tell it\xe2\x80\x94rather not. There is no reason either\r\nwhy I should, as you probably will never have much to do with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I should like to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can inquire at my aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94she will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Gabriel Oak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd mine isn\xe2\x80\x99t. You seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively,\r\nGabriel Oak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, it is the only one I shall ever have, and I must make the\r\nmost of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you might soon get a new one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x94how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people,\r\nGabriel Oak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss\xe2\x80\x94excuse the words\xe2\x80\x94I thought you would like them. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatch you, I know, in mapping out my mind upon my tongue. I never was\r\nvery clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come, give me your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak\xe2\x80\x99s old-fashioned earnest\r\nconclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and\r\ngave him her hand, compressing her lips to a demure impassivity. He\r\nheld it but an instant, and in his fear of being too demonstrative,\r\nswerved to the opposite extreme, touching her fingers with the\r\nlightness of a small-hearted person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said the instant after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLetting your hand go so quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have it again if you like; there it is.\xe2\x80\x9d She gave him her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOak held it longer this time\xe2\x80\x94indeed, curiously long. \xe2\x80\x9cHow soft it\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94being winter time, too\xe2\x80\x94not chapped or rough or anything!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s long enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, though without pulling it away.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it? You may if\r\nyou want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of any such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, simply; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\nwill\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d She snatched back her hand.\r\n\r\nGabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow find out my name,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, teasingly; and withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nGABRIEL\xe2\x80\x99S RESOLVE\xe2\x80\x94THE VISIT\xe2\x80\x94THE MISTAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only superiority in women that is tolerable to the rival sex is, as\r\na rule, that of the unconscious kind; but a superiority which\r\nrecognizes itself may sometimes please by suggesting possibilities of\r\ncapture to the subordinated man.\r\n\r\nThis well-favoured and comely girl soon made appreciable inroads upon\r\nthe emotional constitution of young Farmer Oak.\r\n\r\nLove, being an extremely exacting usurer (a sense of exorbitant profit,\r\nspiritually, by an exchange of hearts, being at the bottom of pure\r\npassions, as that of exorbitant profit, bodily or materially, is at the\r\nbottom of those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were\r\nas sensitive as the money-market in calculations upon his chances. His\r\ndog waited for his meals in a way so like that in which Oak waited for\r\nthe girl\xe2\x80\x99s presence, that the farmer was quite struck with the\r\nresemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at the dog. However,\r\nhe continued to watch through the hedge for her regular coming, and\r\nthus his sentiments towards her were deepened without any corresponding\r\neffect being produced upon herself. Oak had nothing finished and ready\r\nto say as yet, and not being able to frame love phrases which end where\r\nthey begin; passionate tales\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x94Full of sound and fury,\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Signifying nothing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\nhe said no word at all.\r\n\r\nBy making inquiries he found that the girl\xe2\x80\x99s name was Bathsheba\r\nEverdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days. He dreaded\r\nthe eighth day.\r\n\r\nAt last the eighth day came. The cow had ceased to give milk for that\r\nyear, and Bathsheba Everdene came up the hill no more. Gabriel had\r\nreached a pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a short\r\ntime before. He liked saying \xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba\xe2\x80\x9d as a private enjoyment instead\r\nof whistling; turned over his taste to black hair, though he had sworn\r\nby brown ever since he was a boy, isolated himself till the space he\r\nfilled in the public eye was contemptibly small. Love is a possible\r\nstrength in an actual weakness. Marriage transforms a distraction into\r\na support, the power of which should be, and happily often is, in\r\ndirect proportion to the degree of imbecility it supplants. Oak began\r\nnow to see light in this direction, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make her\r\nmy wife, or upon my soul I shall be good for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this while he was perplexing himself about an errand on which he\r\nmight consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s aunt.\r\n\r\nHe found his opportunity in the death of a ewe, mother of a living\r\nlamb. On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution\xe2\x80\x94a fine\r\nJanuary morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible to make\r\ncheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional gleam of\r\nsilvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday basket,\r\nand stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x94George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great\r\nconcern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking.\r\n\r\nGabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with\r\nstrange meditation. At evening he had fancifully traced it down the\r\nchimney to the spot of its origin\xe2\x80\x94seen the hearth and Bathsheba beside\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had worn on the\r\nhill were by association equally with her person included in the\r\ncompass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of his love a\r\nnecessary ingredient of the sweet mixture called Bathsheba Everdene.\r\n\r\nHe had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind\xe2\x80\x94of a nature between the\r\ncarefully neat and the carelessly ornate\xe2\x80\x94of a degree between\r\nfine-market-day and wet-Sunday selection. He thoroughly cleaned his\r\nsilver watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his boots,\r\nlooked to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost heart of the\r\nplantation for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vigorously on his\r\nway back; took a new handkerchief from the bottom of his clothes-box,\r\nput on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprigs of an elegant\r\nflower uniting the beauties of both rose and lily without the defects\r\nof either, and used all the hair-oil he possessed upon his usually dry,\r\nsandy, and inextricably curly hair, till he had deepened it to a\r\nsplendidly novel colour, between that of guano and Roman cement, making\r\nit stick to his head like mace round a nutmeg, or wet seaweed round a\r\nboulder after the ebb.\r\n\r\nNothing disturbed the stillness of the cottage save the chatter of a\r\nknot of sparrows on the eaves; one might fancy scandal and rumour to be\r\nno less the staple topic of these little coteries on roofs than of\r\nthose under them. It seemed that the omen was an unpropitious one, for,\r\nas the rather untoward commencement of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s overtures, just as he\r\narrived by the garden gate, he saw a cat inside, going into various\r\narched shapes and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George.\r\nThe dog took no notice, for he had arrived at an age at which all\r\nsuperfluous barking was cynically avoided as a waste of breath\xe2\x80\x94in fact,\r\nhe never barked even at the sheep except to order, when it was done\r\nwith an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of\r\nCommination-service, which, though offensive, had to be gone through\r\nonce now and then to frighten the flock for their own good.\r\n\r\nA voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into which the cat had run:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it;\xe2\x80\x94did he, poor\r\ndear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak to the voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut George was walking on\r\nbehind me with a temper as mild as milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlmost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving\r\nas to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and\r\nhe heard the person retreat among the bushes.\r\n\r\nGabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into his\r\nforehead by sheer force of reverie. Where the issue of an interview is\r\nas likely to be a vast change for the worse as for the better, any\r\ninitial difference from expectation causes nipping sensations of\r\nfailure. Oak went up to the door a little abashed: his mental rehearsal\r\nand the reality had had no common grounds of opening.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s aunt was indoors. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell Miss Everdene that\r\nsomebody would be glad to speak to her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oak. (Calling one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself merely Somebody, without giving a name, is not to be taken as an\r\nexample of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs from a\r\nrefined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and\r\nannouncements, have no notion whatever.)\r\n\r\nBathsheba was out. The voice had evidently been hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you come in, Mr. Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thank \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbrought a lamb for Miss Everdene. I thought she might like one to rear;\r\ngirls do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; \xe2\x80\x9cthough she\xe2\x80\x99s only a visitor\r\nhere. If you will wait a minute, Bathsheba will be in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, sitting down. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lamb isn\xe2\x80\x99t really\r\nthe business I came about, Mrs. Hurst. In short, I was going to ask her\r\nif she\xe2\x80\x99d like to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd were you indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her. D\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\nknow if she\xe2\x80\x99s got any other young man hanging about her at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire superfluously....\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94bless you, ever so many young men. You see, Farmer Oak, she\xe2\x80\x99s so\r\ngood-looking, and an excellent scholar besides\xe2\x80\x94she was going to be a\r\ngoverness once, you know, only she was too wild. Not that her young men\r\never come here\xe2\x80\x94but, Lord, in the nature of women, she must have a\r\ndozen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Farmer Oak, contemplating a crack in the\r\nstone floor with sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only an every-day sort of man, and my\r\nonly chance was in being the first comer.... Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in my\r\nwaiting, for that was all I came about: so I\xe2\x80\x99ll take myself off\r\nhome-along, Mrs. Hurst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the down, he heard\r\na \xe2\x80\x9choi-hoi!\xe2\x80\x9d uttered behind him, in a piping note of more treble\r\nquality than that in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when\r\nshouted across a field. He looked round, and saw a girl racing after\r\nhim, waving a white handkerchief.\r\n\r\nOak stood still\xe2\x80\x94and the runner drew nearer. It was Bathsheba Everdene.\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s colour deepened: hers was already deep, not, as it appeared,\r\nfrom emotion, but from running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Oak\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pausing for want of breath pulling up in\r\nfront of him with a slanted face and putting her hand to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just called to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, pending her further\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said panting like a robin, her face red and\r\nmoist from her exertions, like a peony petal before the sun dries off\r\nthe dew. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you had come to ask to have me, or I should\r\nhave come in from the garden instantly. I ran after you to say\xe2\x80\x94that my\r\naunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel expanded. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to have made you run so fast, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, with a grateful sense of favours to come. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit till you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nfound your breath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94It was quite a mistake\xe2\x80\x94aunt\xe2\x80\x99s telling you I had a young man already,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBathsheba went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a sweetheart at all\xe2\x80\x94and I never had one,\r\nand I thought that, as times go with women, it was _such_ a pity to\r\nsend you away thinking that I had several.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally and truly I am glad to hear that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Farmer Oak, smiling one\r\nof his long special smiles, and blushing with gladness. He held out his\r\nhand to take hers, which, when she had eased her side by pressing it\r\nthere, was prettily extended upon her bosom to still her loud-beating\r\nheart. Directly he seized it she put it behind her, so that it slipped\r\nthrough his fingers like an eel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a nice snug little farm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, with half a degree less\r\nassurance than when he had seized her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man has advanced me money to begin with, but still, it will soon be\r\npaid off, and though I am only an every-day sort of man, I have got on\r\na little since I was a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel uttered \xe2\x80\x9ca little\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone to\r\nshow her that it was the complacent form of \xe2\x80\x9ca great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ncontinued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we be married, I am quite sure I can work twice as\r\nhard as I do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went forward and stretched out his arm again. Bathsheba had\r\novertaken him at a point beside which stood a low stunted holly bush,\r\nnow laden with red berries. Seeing his advance take the form of an\r\nattitude threatening a possible enclosure, if not compression, of her\r\nperson, she edged off round the bush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Farmer Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, over the top, looking at him with rounded\r\neyes, \xe2\x80\x9cI never said I was going to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94that _is_ a tale!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, with dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cTo run after anybody\r\nlike this, and then say you don\xe2\x80\x99t want him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I meant to tell you was only this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly, and yet\r\nhalf conscious of the absurdity of the position she had made for\r\nherself\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat nobody has got me yet as a sweetheart, instead of my\r\nhaving a dozen, as my aunt said; I _hate_ to be thought men\xe2\x80\x99s property\r\nin that way, though possibly I shall be had some day. Why, if I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwanted you I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have run after you like this; \xe2\x80\x99twould have been\r\nthe _forwardest_ thing! But there was no harm in hurrying to correct a\r\npiece of false news that had been told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\xe2\x80\x94no harm at all.\xe2\x80\x9d But there is such a thing as being too\r\ngenerous in expressing a judgment impulsively, and Oak added with a\r\nmore appreciative sense of all the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am not quite\r\ncertain it was no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to think before starting whether I wanted to\r\nmarry or not, for you\xe2\x80\x99d have been gone over the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, freshening again; \xe2\x80\x9cthink a minute or two. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwait a while, Miss Everdene. Will you marry me? Do, Bathsheba. I love\r\nyou far more than common!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to think,\xe2\x80\x9d she observed, rather more timorously; \xe2\x80\x9cif I can\r\nthink out of doors; my mind spreads away so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can give a guess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen give me time.\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the distance,\r\naway from the direction in which Gabriel stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can make you happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the back of her head, across the\r\nbush. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have a piano in a year or two\xe2\x80\x94farmers\xe2\x80\x99 wives are\r\ngetting to have pianos now\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll practise up the flute right well to\r\nplay with you in the evenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I should like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have one of those little ten-pound gigs for market\xe2\x80\x94and nice\r\nflowers, and birds\xe2\x80\x94cocks and hens I mean, because they be useful,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Gabriel, feeling balanced between poetry and practicality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a frame for cucumbers\xe2\x80\x94like a gentleman and lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the wedding was over, we\xe2\x80\x99d have it put in the newspaper list\r\nof marriages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearly I should like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the babies in the births\xe2\x80\x94every man jack of \xe2\x80\x99em! And at home by the\r\nfire, whenever you look up, there I shall be\xe2\x80\x94and whenever I look up\r\nthere will be you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, wait, and don\xe2\x80\x99t be improper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer countenance fell, and she was silent awhile. He regarded the red\r\nberries between them over and over again, to such an extent, that holly\r\nseemed in his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of\r\nmarriage. Bathsheba decisively turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; \xe2\x80\x99tis no use,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have tried hard all the time I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking; for a marriage\r\nwould be very nice in one sense. People would talk about me, and think\r\nI had won my battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all that. But a\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he\xe2\x80\x99d always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he would\xe2\x80\x94I, that is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what I mean is that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a bride at a wedding,\r\nif I could be one without having a husband. But since a woman can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshow off in that way by herself, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t marry\xe2\x80\x94at least yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible wooden story!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her\r\ndignity by a slight sweep away from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my heart and soul, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a maid can say stupider than\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cBut dearest,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued in a palliative voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be like it!\xe2\x80\x9d Oak sighed a deep honest sigh\xe2\x80\x94none the less so in\r\nthat, being like the sigh of a pine plantation, it was rather\r\nnoticeable as a disturbance of the atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t you have me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe appealed, creeping round the holly to reach her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, retreating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted, standing still at last in despair of ever\r\nreaching her, and facing over the bush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe contracted a yawn to an inoffensive smallness, so that it was\r\nhardly ill-mannered at all. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I love you\xe2\x80\x94and, as for myself, I am content to be liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Mr. Oak\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s very fine! You\xe2\x80\x99d get to despise me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he seemed to be coming, by the\r\nforce of his words, straight through the bush and into her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshall do one thing in this life\xe2\x80\x94one thing certain\xe2\x80\x94that is, love you,\r\nand long for you, and _keep wanting you_ till I die.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice had a\r\ngenuine pathos now, and his large brown hands perceptibly trembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems dreadfully wrong not to have you when you feel so much!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid with a little distress, and looking hopelessly around for some\r\nmeans of escape from her moral dilemma. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t run after\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d However she seemed to have a short cut for getting back to\r\ncheerfulness, and set her face to signify archness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\r\nMr. Oak. I want somebody to tame me; I am too independent; and you\r\nwould never be able to, I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying that it was useless\r\nto attempt argument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with luminous distinctness and common sense, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nare better off than I. I have hardly a penny in the world\xe2\x80\x94I am staying\r\nwith my aunt for my bare sustenance. I am better educated than you\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t love you a bit: that\xe2\x80\x99s my side of the case. Now yours: you are\r\na farmer just beginning; and you ought in common prudence, if you marry\r\nat all (which you should certainly not think of doing at present), to\r\nmarry a woman with money, who would stock a larger farm for you than\r\nyou have now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing I had been thinking myself!\xe2\x80\x9d he na\xc3\xafvely said.\r\n\r\nFarmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to\r\nsucceed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a superfluous moiety of\r\nhonesty. Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, why did you come and disturb me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, almost\r\nangrily, if not quite, an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do what I think would be\xe2\x80\x94would be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo: wise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have made an admission _now_, Mr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with even\r\nmore hauteur, and rocking her head disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, do you\r\nthink I could marry you? Not if I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke in passionately. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake me like that! Because I am\r\nopen enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought of,\r\nyou make your colours come up your face, and get crabbed with me. That\r\nabout your not being good enough for me is nonsense. You speak like a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x94all the parish notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury is, I have\r\nheerd, a large farmer\xe2\x80\x94much larger than ever I shall be. May I call in\r\nthe evening, or will you walk along with me o\xe2\x80\x99 Sundays? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nyou to make-up your mind at once, if you\xe2\x80\x99d rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94I cannot. Don\xe2\x80\x99t press me any more\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t love you\xe2\x80\x94so\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twould be ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nNo man likes to see his emotions the sport of a merry-go-round of\r\nskittishness. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, firmly, with the bearing of one\r\nwho was going to give his days and nights to Ecclesiastes for ever.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nDEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA\xe2\x80\x94A PASTORAL TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene had\r\nleft the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might have\r\nsurprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the\r\nrenunciation the less absolute its character.\r\n\r\nIt may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting out\r\nof love as there is for getting in. Some people look upon marriage as a\r\nshort cut that way, but it has been known to fail. Separation, which\r\nwas the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisappearance, though effectual with people of certain humours, is apt\r\nto idealize the removed object with others\xe2\x80\x94notably those whose\r\naffection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep and long. Oak\r\nbelonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the secret\r\nfusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a finer flame now\r\nthat she was gone\xe2\x80\x94that was all.\r\n\r\nHis incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the failure\r\nof his suit, and all that Oak learnt of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s movements was done\r\nindirectly. It appeared that she had gone to a place called\r\nWeatherbury, more than twenty miles off, but in what capacity\xe2\x80\x94whether\r\nas a visitor, or permanently, he could not discover.\r\n\r\nGabriel had two dogs. George, the elder, exhibited an ebony-tipped\r\nnose, surrounded by a narrow margin of pink flesh, and a coat marked in\r\nrandom splotches approximating in colour to white and slaty grey; but\r\nthe grey, after years of sun and rain, had been scorched and washed out\r\nof the more prominent locks, leaving them of a reddish-brown, as if the\r\nblue component of the grey had faded, like the indigo from the same\r\nkind of colour in Turner\xe2\x80\x99s pictures. In substance it had originally\r\nbeen hair, but long contact with sheep seemed to be turning it by\r\ndegrees into wool of a poor quality and staple.\r\n\r\nThis dog had originally belonged to a shepherd of inferior morals and\r\ndreadful temper, and the result was that George knew the exact degrees\r\nof condemnation signified by cursing and swearing of all descriptions\r\nbetter than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhood. Long experience\r\nhad so precisely taught the animal the difference between such\r\nexclamations as \xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 ye, come in!\xe2\x80\x9d that he knew to a\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth the rate of trotting back from the ewes\xe2\x80\x99 tails that each\r\ncall involved, if a staggerer with the sheep crook was to be escaped.\r\nThough old, he was clever and trustworthy still.\r\n\r\nThe young dog, George\xe2\x80\x99s son, might possibly have been the image of his\r\nmother, for there was not much resemblance between him and George. He\r\nwas learning the sheep-keeping business, so as to follow on at the\r\nflock when the other should die, but had got no further than the\r\nrudiments as yet\xe2\x80\x94still finding an insuperable difficulty in\r\ndistinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too well.\r\nSo earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had no name\r\nin particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any pleasant\r\ninterjection), that if sent behind the flock to help them on, he did it\r\nso thoroughly that he would have chased them across the whole county\r\nwith the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded when to stop\r\nby the example of old George.\r\n\r\nThus much for the dogs. On the further side of Norcombe Hill was a\r\nchalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and spread\r\nover adjacent farms. Two hedges converged upon it in the form of a V,\r\nbut without quite meeting. The narrow opening left, which was\r\nimmediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough railing.\r\n\r\nOne night, when Farmer Oak had returned to his house, believing there\r\nwould be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he called\r\nas usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the outhouse\r\ntill next morning. Only one responded\xe2\x80\x94old George; the other could not\r\nbe found, either in the house, lane, or garden. Gabriel then remembered\r\nthat he had left the two dogs on the hill eating a dead lamb (a kind of\r\nmeat he usually kept from them, except when other food ran short), and\r\nconcluding that the young one had not finished his meal, he went\r\nindoors to the luxury of a bed, which latterly he had only enjoyed on\r\nSundays.\r\n\r\nIt was a still, moist night. Just before dawn he was assisted in waking\r\nby the abnormal reverberation of familiar music. To the shepherd, the\r\nnote of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock to other people,\r\nis a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing or\r\naltering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle twinkle which\r\nsignifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that all is well in\r\nthe fold. In the solemn calm of the awakening morn that note was heard\r\nby Gabriel, beating with unusual violence and rapidity. This\r\nexceptional ringing may be caused in two ways\xe2\x80\x94by the rapid feeding of\r\nthe sheep bearing the bell, as when the flock breaks into new pasture,\r\nwhich gives it an intermittent rapidity, or by the sheep starting off\r\nin a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation. The experienced ear\r\nof Oak knew the sound he now heard to be caused by the running of the\r\nflock with great velocity.\r\n\r\nHe jumped out of bed, dressed, tore down the lane through a foggy dawn,\r\nand ascended the hill. The forward ewes were kept apart from those\r\namong which the fall of lambs would be later, there being two hundred\r\nof the latter class in Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s flock. These two hundred seemed to\r\nhave absolutely vanished from the hill. There were the fifty with their\r\nlambs, enclosed at the other end as he had left them, but the rest,\r\nforming the bulk of the flock, were nowhere. Gabriel called at the top\r\nof his voice the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s call:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOvey, ovey, ovey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot a single bleat. He went to the hedge; a gap had been broken through\r\nit, and in the gap were the footprints of the sheep. Rather surprised\r\nto find them break fence at this season, yet putting it down instantly\r\nto their great fondness for ivy in winter-time, of which a great deal\r\ngrew in the plantation, he followed through the hedge. They were not in\r\nthe plantation. He called again: the valleys and farthest hills\r\nresounded as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian\r\nshore; but no sheep. He passed through the trees and along the ridge of\r\nthe hill. On the extreme summit, where the ends of the two converging\r\nhedges of which we have spoken were stopped short by meeting the brow\r\nof the chalk-pit, he saw the younger dog standing against the sky\xe2\x80\x94dark\r\nand motionless as Napoleon at St. Helena.\r\n\r\nA horrible conviction darted through Oak. With a sensation of bodily\r\nfaintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through, and\r\nthere he saw the footprints of his ewes. The dog came up, licked his\r\nhand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward for\r\nsignal services rendered. Oak looked over the precipice. The ewes lay\r\ndead and dying at its foot\xe2\x80\x94a heap of two hundred mangled carcasses,\r\nrepresenting in their condition just now at least two hundred more.\r\n\r\nOak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in\r\npieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and\r\ncarried him on as by gravitation. A shadow in his life had always been\r\nthat his flock ended in mutton\xe2\x80\x94that a day came and found every shepherd\r\nan arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep. His first feeling now was\r\none of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\nIt was a second to remember another phase of the matter. The sheep were\r\nnot insured. All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a\r\nblow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were laid low\xe2\x80\x94possibly\r\nfor ever. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s energies, patience, and industry had been so\r\nseverely taxed during the years of his life between eighteen and\r\neight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of progress that no more\r\nseemed to be left in him. He leant down upon a rail, and covered his\r\nface with his hands.\r\n\r\nStupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from\r\nhis. It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one\r\nsentence he uttered was in thankfulness:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God I am not married: what would _she_ have done in the poverty\r\nnow coming upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly\r\nsurveyed the scene. By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond,\r\nand over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon which\r\nhad only a few days to last\xe2\x80\x94the morning star dogging her on the left\r\nhand. The pool glittered like a dead man\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and as the world awoke\r\na breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of the moon\r\nwithout breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a phosphoric\r\nstreak upon the water. All this Oak saw and remembered.\r\n\r\nAs far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still\r\nunder the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep,\r\nthe more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal off\r\nthe dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and spirits,\r\ncollected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid creatures\r\nthrough the hedge, across the upper field, and by main force of\r\nworrying had given them momentum enough to break down a portion of the\r\nrotten railing, and so hurled them over the edge.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s son had done his work so thoroughly that he was considered too\r\ngood a workman to live, and was, in fact, taken and tragically shot at\r\ntwelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that same day\xe2\x80\x94another instance of the untoward fate\r\nwhich so often attends dogs and other philosophers who follow out a\r\ntrain of reasoning to its logical conclusion, and attempt perfectly\r\nconsistent conduct in a world made up so largely of compromise.\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s farm had been stocked by a dealer\xe2\x80\x94on the strength of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromising look and character\xe2\x80\x94who was receiving a percentage from the\r\nfarmer till such time as the advance should be cleared off. Oak found\r\nthat the value of stock, plant, and implements which were really his\r\nown would be about sufficient to pay his debts, leaving himself a free\r\nman with the clothes he stood up in, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nTHE FAIR\xe2\x80\x94THE JOURNEY\xe2\x80\x94THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months passed away. We are brought on to a day in February, on\r\nwhich was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town of\r\nCasterbridge.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and\r\nhearty labourers waiting upon Chance\xe2\x80\x94all men of the stamp to whom\r\nlabour suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and\r\npleasure nothing better than a renunciation of the same. Among these,\r\ncarters and waggoners were distinguished by having a piece of whip-cord\r\ntwisted round their hats; thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw;\r\nshepherds held their sheep-crooks in their hands; and thus the\r\nsituation required was known to the hirers at a glance.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior\r\nappearance to the rest\xe2\x80\x94in fact, his superiority was marked enough to\r\nlead several ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as\r\nto a farmer, and to use \xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x9d as a finishing word. His answer always\r\nwas,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking for a place myself\xe2\x80\x94a bailiff\xe2\x80\x99s. Do ye know of anybody who\r\nwants one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was paler now. His eyes were more meditative, and his\r\nexpression was more sad. He had passed through an ordeal of\r\nwretchedness which had given him more than it had taken away. He had\r\nsunk from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very\r\nslime-pits of Siddim; but there was left to him a dignified calm he had\r\nnever before known, and that indifference to fate which, though it\r\noften makes a villain of a man, is the basis of his sublimity when it\r\ndoes not. And thus the abasement had been exaltation, and the loss\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town, and a sergeant\r\nand his party had been beating up for recruits through the four\r\nstreets. As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself not hired,\r\nGabriel almost wished that he had joined them, and gone off to serve\r\nhis country. Weary of standing in the market-place, and not much\r\nminding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided to offer\r\nhimself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.\r\n\r\nAll the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds. Sheep-tending was\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s speciality. Turning down an obscure street and entering an\r\nobscurer lane, he went up to a smith\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long would it take you to make a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s crook?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nHe then went to a ready-made clothes\xe2\x80\x99 shop, the owner of which had a\r\nlarge rural connection. As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for a\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s regulation smock-frock.\r\n\r\nThis transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the\r\ncentre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a\r\nshepherd, crook in hand.\r\n\r\nNow that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that\r\nbailiffs were most in demand. However, two or three farmers noticed him\r\nand drew near. Dialogues followed, more or less in the subjoined form:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do you come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNorcombe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a long way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s farm were you upon last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera. The inquiring\r\nfarmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously. Gabriel, like his\r\ndog, was too good to be trustworthy, and he never made advance beyond\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nIt is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and extemporize a\r\nprocedure to fit it, than to get a good plan matured, and wait for a\r\nchance of using it. Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his colours as\r\na shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of\r\nlabour that was required in the fair. It grew dusk. Some merry men were\r\nwhistling and singing by the corn-exchange. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which had\r\nlain for some time idle in his smock-frock pocket, touched his flute\r\nwhich he carried there. Here was an opportunity for putting his dearly\r\nbought wisdom into practice.\r\n\r\nHe drew out his flute and began to play \xe2\x80\x9cJockey to the Fair\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nstyle of a man who had never known a moment\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow. Oak could pipe\r\nwith Arcadian sweetness, and the sound of the well-known notes cheered\r\nhis own heart as well as those of the loungers. He played on with\r\nspirit, and in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small\r\nfortune to a destitute man.\r\n\r\nBy making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at Shottsford\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is Shottsford?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen miles t\xe2\x80\x99other side of Weatherbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWeatherbury! It was where Bathsheba had gone two months before. This\r\ninformation was like coming from night into noon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far is it to Weatherbury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive or six miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before this time, but the\r\nplace had enough interest attaching to it to lead Oak to choose\r\nShottsford fair as his next field of inquiry, because it lay in the\r\nWeatherbury quarter. Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no means\r\nuninteresting intrinsically. If report spoke truly they were as hardy,\r\nmerry, thriving, wicked a set as any in the whole county. Oak resolved\r\nto sleep at Weatherbury that night on his way to Shottsford, and struck\r\nout at once into the high road which had been recommended as the direct\r\nroute to the village in question.\r\n\r\nThe road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks,\r\nwhose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres, and folded\r\ninto creases at the sides; or, where the flow was more rapid, the\r\nstream was pied with spots of white froth, which rode on in undisturbed\r\nserenity. On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves\r\ntapped the ground as they bowled along helter-skelter upon the\r\nshoulders of the wind, and little birds in the hedges were rustling\r\ntheir feathers and tucking themselves in comfortably for the night,\r\nretaining their places if Oak kept moving, but flying away if he\r\nstopped to look at them. He passed by Yalbury Wood where the game-birds\r\nwere rising to their roosts, and heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccu-uck, cuck,\xe2\x80\x9d and the wheezy whistle of the hens.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the\r\nlandscape had assumed a uniform hue of blackness. He descended Yalbury\r\nHill and could just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up under a\r\ngreat over-hanging tree by the roadside.\r\n\r\nOn coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the spot\r\nbeing apparently quite deserted. The waggon, from its position, seemed\r\nto have been left there for the night, for beyond about half a truss of\r\nhay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty. Gabriel sat\r\ndown on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his position. He\r\ncalculated that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey;\r\nand having been on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted to lie down\r\nupon the hay in the waggon instead of pushing on to the village of\r\nWeatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.\r\n\r\nEating his last slices of bread and ham, and drinking from the bottle\r\nof cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him, he got into the\r\nlonely waggon. Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as well as\r\nhe could in the darkness, pulled the other half over him by way of\r\nbed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and feeling, physically, as\r\ncomfortable as ever he had been in his life. Inward melancholy it was\r\nimpossible for a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours,\r\nto banish quite, whilst conning the present untoward page of his\r\nhistory. So, thinking of his misfortunes, amorous and pastoral, he fell\r\nasleep, shepherds enjoying, in common with sailors, the privilege of\r\nbeing able to summon the god instead of having to wait for him.\r\n\r\nOn somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no\r\nidea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion. He was being carried\r\nalong the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without\r\nsprings, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his head being\r\ndandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrum-stick.\r\nHe then distinguished voices in conversation, coming from the forpart\r\nof the waggon. His concern at this dilemma (which would have been\r\nalarm, had he been a thriving man; but misfortune is a fine opiate to\r\npersonal terror) led him to peer cautiously from the hay, and the first\r\nsight he beheld was the stars above him. Charles\xe2\x80\x99s Wain was getting\r\ntowards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it\r\nmust be about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\xe2\x80\x94in other words, that he had slept two hours.\r\nThis small astronomical calculation was made without any positive\r\neffort, and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover, if possible,\r\ninto whose hands he had fallen.\r\n\r\nTwo figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with their legs\r\noutside the waggon, one of whom was driving. Gabriel soon found that\r\nthis was the waggoner, and it appeared they had come from Casterbridge\r\nfair, like himself.\r\n\r\nA conversation was in progress, which continued thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe as \xe2\x80\x99twill, she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine handsome body as far\xe2\x80\x99s looks be concerned.\r\nBut that\xe2\x80\x99s only the skin of the woman, and these dandy cattle be as\r\nproud as a lucifer in their insides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94so \xe2\x80\x99a do seem, Billy Smallbury\xe2\x80\x94so \xe2\x80\x99a do seem.\xe2\x80\x9d This utterance was\r\nvery shaky by nature, and more so by circumstance, the jolting of the\r\nwaggon not being without its effect upon the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s larynx. It came\r\nfrom the man who held the reins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a very vain feymell\xe2\x80\x94so \xe2\x80\x99tis said here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, now. If so be \xe2\x80\x99tis like that, I can\xe2\x80\x99t look her in the face. Lord,\r\nno: not I\xe2\x80\x94heh-heh-heh! Such a shy man as I be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s very vain. \xe2\x80\x99Tis said that every night at going to bed she\r\nlooks in the glass to put on her night-cap properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not a married woman. Oh, the world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd \xe2\x80\x99a can play the peanner, so \xe2\x80\x99tis said. Can play so clever that \xe2\x80\x99a\r\ncan make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a man\r\ncan wish for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye tell o\xe2\x80\x99t! A happy time for us, and I feel quite a new man! And\r\nhow do she pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Master Poorgrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild thought flashed into\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba. There were,\r\nhowever, no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon,\r\nthough going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going beyond it,\r\nand the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate. They\r\nwere now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the\r\nspeakers unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon unseen.\r\n\r\nHe turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate, and\r\nmounting thereon, he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in\r\nthe village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or\r\ncorn-stack. The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon his ear. He\r\nwas about to walk on, when he noticed on his left hand an unusual\r\nlight\xe2\x80\x94appearing about half a mile distant. Oak watched it, and the glow\r\nincreased. Something was on fire.\r\n\r\nGabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side\r\nupon what he found to be ploughed soil, made across the field in the\r\nexact direction of the fire. The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by\r\nhis approach and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer the\r\noutlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great distinctness. A\r\nrick-yard was the source of the fire. His weary face now began to be\r\npainted over with a rich orange glow, and the whole front of his\r\nsmock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of\r\nthorn-twigs\xe2\x80\x94the light reaching him through a leafless intervening\r\nhedge\xe2\x80\x94and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright in\r\nthe same abounding rays. He came up to the boundary fence, and stood to\r\nregain breath. It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by a living\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which was so far gone as\r\nto preclude a possibility of saving it. A rick burns differently from a\r\nhouse. As the wind blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames\r\ncompletely disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is lost to\r\nthe eye. However, a hay or a wheat-rick, well put together, will resist\r\ncombustion for a length of time, if it begins on the outside.\r\n\r\nThis before Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes was a rick of straw, loosely put together,\r\nand the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness. It glowed on\r\nthe windward side, rising and falling in intensity, like the coal of a\r\ncigar. Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking noise;\r\nflames elongated, and bent themselves about with a quiet roar, but no\r\ncrackle. Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing\r\nclouds, and behind these burned hidden pyres, illuminating the\r\nsemi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity.\r\nIndividual straws in the foreground were consumed in a creeping\r\nmovement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms, and above\r\nshone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring eyes,\r\nand other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks flew in clusters\r\nlike birds from a nest.\r\n\r\nOak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case\r\nto be more serious than he had at first imagined. A scroll of smoke\r\nblew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition\r\nwith the decaying one, and behind this a series of others, composing\r\nthe main corn produce of the farm; so that instead of the straw-stack\r\nstanding, as he had imagined comparatively isolated, there was a\r\nregular connection between it and the remaining stacks of the group.\r\n\r\nGabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone. The first\r\nman he came to was running about in a great hurry, as if his thoughts\r\nwere several yards in advance of his body, which they could never drag\r\non fast enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, man\xe2\x80\x94fire, fire! A good master and a bad servant is fire, fire!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nmane a bad servant and a good master. Oh, Mark Clark\xe2\x80\x94come! And you,\r\nBilly Smallbury\xe2\x80\x94and you, Maryann Money\xe2\x80\x94and you, Jan Coggan, and Matthew\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d Other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among\r\nthe smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from being alone he was in a\r\ngreat company\xe2\x80\x94whose shadows danced merrily up and down, timed by the\r\njigging of the flames, and not at all by their owners\xe2\x80\x99 movements. The\r\nassemblage\xe2\x80\x94belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts\r\ninto the form of feeling, and its feelings into the form of\r\ncommotion\xe2\x80\x94set to work with a remarkable confusion of purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop the draught under the wheat-rick!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gabriel to those nearest\r\nto him. The corn stood on stone staddles, and between these, tongues of\r\nyellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully. If the\r\nfire once got _under_ this stack, all would be lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet a tarpaulin\xe2\x80\x94quick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nA rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a curtain across the\r\nchannel. The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the\r\ncorn-stack, and stood up vertical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet.\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGabriel again.\r\n\r\nThe flames, now driven upwards, began to attack the angles of the huge\r\nroof covering the wheat-stack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ladder,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\na spectre-like form in the smoke.\r\n\r\nOak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he were going to engage\r\nin the operation of \xe2\x80\x9creed-drawing,\xe2\x80\x9d and digging in his feet, and\r\noccasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook, he clambered up\r\nthe beetling face. He at once sat astride the very apex, and began with\r\nhis crook to beat off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon,\r\nshouting to the others to get him a bough and a ladder, and some water.\r\n\r\nBilly Smallbury\xe2\x80\x94one of the men who had been on the waggon\xe2\x80\x94by this time\r\nhad found a ladder, which Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak\r\nupon the thatch. The smoke at this corner was stifling, and Clark, a\r\nnimble fellow, having been handed a bucket of water, bathed Oak\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nand sprinkled him generally, whilst Gabriel, now with a long\r\nbeech-bough in one hand, in addition to his crook in the other, kept\r\nsweeping the stack and dislodging all fiery particles.\r\n\r\nOn the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all\r\nthey could to keep down the conflagration, which was not much. They\r\nwere all tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying pattern.\r\nRound the corner of the largest stack, out of the direct rays of the\r\nfire, stood a pony, bearing a young woman on its back. By her side was\r\nanother woman, on foot. These two seemed to keep at a distance from the\r\nfire, that the horse might not become restive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman on foot. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94he is. See how his\r\ncrook shines as he beats the rick with it. And his smock-frock is burnt\r\nin two holes, I declare! A fine young shepherd he is too, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose shepherd is he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the equestrian in a clear voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t any of the others know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked \xe2\x80\x99em. Quite a stranger, they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked\r\nanxiously around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think the barn is safe?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coggan?\xe2\x80\x9d said the second woman,\r\npassing on the question to the nearest man in that direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe now\xe2\x80\x94leastwise I think so. If this rick had gone the barn would\r\nhave followed. \xe2\x80\x99Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done the most\r\ngood\xe2\x80\x94he sitting on the top o\xe2\x80\x99 rick, whizzing his great long arms about\r\nlike a windmill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does work hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young woman on horseback, looking up at\r\nGabriel through her thick woollen veil. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he was shepherd here.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t any of you know his name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever heard the man\xe2\x80\x99s name in my life, or seed his form afore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s elevated position being no\r\nlonger required of him, he made as if to descend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaryann,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl on horseback, \xe2\x80\x9cgo to him as he comes down, and\r\nsay that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he has\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the\r\nladder. She delivered her message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your master the farmer?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gabriel, kindling with the\r\nidea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tisn\xe2\x80\x99t a master; \xe2\x80\x99tis a mistress, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman farmer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, and a rich one too!\xe2\x80\x9d said a bystander. \xe2\x80\x9cLately \xe2\x80\x99a came\r\nhere from a distance. Took on her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s farm, who died suddenly. Used\r\nto measure his money in half-pint cups. They say now that she\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbusiness in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks no more of playing\r\npitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I do pitch-halfpenny\xe2\x80\x94not a bit in\r\nthe world, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s she, back there upon the pony,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann; \xe2\x80\x9cwi\xe2\x80\x99 her face\r\na-covered up in that black cloth with holes in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak, his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable from the smoke and\r\nheat, his smock-frock burnt into holes and dripping with water, the ash\r\nstem of his sheep-crook charred six inches shorter, advanced with the\r\nhumility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to the slight female\r\nform in the saddle. He lifted his hat with respect, and not without\r\ngallantry: stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating\r\nvoice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to want a shepherd, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and looked all\r\nastonishment. Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba Everdene,\r\nwere face to face.\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically repeated in an abashed and\r\nsad voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a shepherd, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nRECOGNITION\xe2\x80\x94A TIMID GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba withdrew into the shade. She scarcely knew whether most to be\r\namused at the singularity of the meeting, or to be concerned at its\r\nawkwardness. There was room for a little pity, also for a very little\r\nexultation: the former at his position, the latter at her own.\r\nEmbarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of\r\nlove to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, putting on an air of dignity, and turning again to\r\nhim with a little warmth of cheek; \xe2\x80\x9cI do want a shepherd. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the very man, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the villagers, quietly.\r\n\r\nConviction breeds conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, that \xe2\x80\x99a is,\xe2\x80\x9d said a second,\r\ndecisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d said a third, with heartiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s all there!\xe2\x80\x9d said number four, fervidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you tell him to speak to the bailiff?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nAll was practical again now. A summer eve and loneliness would have\r\nbeen necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance.\r\n\r\nThe bailiff was pointed out to Gabriel, who, checking the palpitation\r\nwithin his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange report\r\nwas only a modification of Venus the well-known and admired, retired\r\nwith him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.\r\n\r\nThe fire before them wasted away. \xe2\x80\x9cMen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, \xe2\x80\x9cyou shall\r\ntake a little refreshment after this extra work. Will you come to the\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could knock in a bit and a drop a good deal freer, Miss, if so be\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99d send it to Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Malthouse,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the spokesman.\r\n\r\nBathsheba then rode off into the darkness, and the men straggled on to\r\nthe village in twos and threes\xe2\x80\x94Oak and the bailiff being left by the\r\nrick alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the bailiff, finally, \xe2\x80\x9call is settled, I think, about\r\nyour coming, and I am going home-along. Good-night to ye, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you get me a lodging?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I can\xe2\x80\x99t, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, moving past Oak as a Christian edges\r\npast an offertory-plate when he does not mean to contribute. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nfollow on the road till you come to Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Malthouse, where they are\r\nall gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay some of \xe2\x80\x99em will\r\ntell you of a place. Good-night to ye, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bailiff who showed this nervous dread of loving his neighbour as\r\nhimself, went up the hill, and Oak walked on to the village, still\r\nastonished at the reencounter with Bathsheba, glad of his nearness to\r\nher, and perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl of\r\nNorcombe had developed into the supervising and cool woman here. But\r\nsome women only require an emergency to make them fit for one.\r\n\r\nObliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order to find the way, he\r\nreached the churchyard, and passed round it under the wall where\r\nseveral ancient trees grew. There was a wide margin of grass along\r\nhere, and Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps were deadened by its softness, even at\r\nthis indurating period of the year. When abreast of a trunk which\r\nappeared to be the oldest of the old, he became aware that a figure was\r\nstanding behind it. Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in another\r\nmoment he accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise was enough to\r\ndisturb the motionless stranger, who started and assumed a careless\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl to Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThe voice was unexpectedly attractive; it was the low and dulcet note\r\nsuggestive of romance; common in descriptions, rare in experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll thank you to tell me if I\xe2\x80\x99m in the way for Warren\xe2\x80\x99s Malthouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGabriel resumed, primarily to gain the information, indirectly to get\r\nmore of the music.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. It\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom of the hill. And do you know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ngirl hesitated and then went on again. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how late they keep\r\nopen the Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Head Inn?\xe2\x80\x9d She seemed to be won by Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheartiness, as Gabriel had been won by her modulations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Head is, or anything about it. Do you\r\nthink of going there to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The woman again paused. There was no necessity for any\r\ncontinuance of speech, and the fact that she did add more seemed to\r\nproceed from an unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a\r\nremark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they are acting by\r\nstealth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a Weatherbury man?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timorously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not. I am the new shepherd\xe2\x80\x94just arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a shepherd\xe2\x80\x94and you seem almost a farmer by your ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel repeated, in a dull cadence of finality. His\r\nthoughts were directed to the past, his eyes to the feet of the girl;\r\nand for the first time he saw lying there a bundle of some sort. She\r\nmay have perceived the direction of his face, for she said coaxingly,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything in the parish about having seen me here, will\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94at least, not for a day or two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t if you wish me not to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d the other replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am rather poor, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant people to know anything about me.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she was silent and\r\nshivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have a cloak on such a cold night,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel observed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould advise \xe2\x80\x99ee to get indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no! Would you mind going on and leaving me? I thank you much for\r\nwhat you have told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; adding hesitatingly,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSince you are not very\r\nwell off, perhaps you would accept this trifle from me. It is only a\r\nshilling, but it is all I have to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will take it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger gratefully.\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand; Gabriel his. In feeling for each other\xe2\x80\x99s palm in\r\nthe gloom before the money could be passed, a minute incident occurred\r\nwhich told much. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s fingers alighted on the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s wrist.\r\nIt was beating with a throb of tragic intensity. He had frequently felt\r\nthe same quick, hard beat in the femoral artery of his lambs when\r\noverdriven. It suggested a consumption too great of a vitality which,\r\nto judge from her figure and stature, was already too little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no! Let your having seen me be a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I will. Good-night, again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl remained motionless by the tree, and Gabriel descended\r\ninto the village of Weatherbury, or Lower Longpuddle as it was\r\nsometimes called. He fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra\r\nof a very deep sadness when touching that slight and fragile creature.\r\nBut wisdom lies in moderating mere impressions, and Gabriel endeavoured\r\nto think little of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE MALTHOUSE\xe2\x80\x94THE CHAT\xe2\x80\x94NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall inwrapped with ivy, and\r\nthough not much of the exterior was visible at this hour, the character\r\nand purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline\r\nupon the sky. From the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to\r\na point in the centre, upon which rose a small wooden lantern, fitted\r\nwith louvre-boards on all the four sides, and from these openings a\r\nmist was dimly perceived to be escaping into the night air. There was\r\nno window in front; but a square hole in the door was glazed with a\r\nsingle pane, through which red, comfortable rays now stretched out upon\r\nthe ivied wall in front. Voices were to be heard inside.\r\n\r\nOak\xe2\x80\x99s hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to an\r\nElymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap, which he\r\npulled. This lifted a wooden latch, and the door swung open.\r\n\r\nThe room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln mouth,\r\nwhich shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality of the\r\nsetting sun, and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities\r\nin those assembled around. The stone-flag floor was worn into a path\r\nfrom the doorway to the kiln, and into undulations everywhere. A curved\r\nsettle of unplaned oak stretched along one side, and in a remote corner\r\nwas a small bed and bedstead, the owner and frequent occupier of which\r\nwas the maltster.\r\n\r\nThis aged man was now sitting opposite the fire, his frosty white hair\r\nand beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen\r\nupon a leafless apple-tree. He wore breeches and the laced-up shoes\r\ncalled ankle-jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire.\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell\r\nof new malt. The conversation (which seemed to have been concerning the\r\norigin of the fire) immediately ceased, and every one ocularly\r\ncriticised him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of\r\ntheir foreheads and looking at him with narrowed eyelids, as if he had\r\nbeen a light too strong for their sight. Several exclaimed\r\nmeditatively, after this operation had been completed:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis the new shepherd, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin, but\r\nweren\xe2\x80\x99t sure \xe2\x80\x99twere not a dead leaf blowed across,\xe2\x80\x9d said another. \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nin, shepherd; sure ye be welcome, though we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yer name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel Oak, that\xe2\x80\x99s my name, neighbours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned at this\xe2\x80\x94his turning\r\nbeing as the turning of a rusty crane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s never Gable Oak\xe2\x80\x99s grandson over at Norcombe\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as\r\na formula expressive of surprise, which nobody was supposed for a\r\nmoment to take literally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father and my grandfather were old men of the name of Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the shepherd, placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThought I knowed the man\xe2\x80\x99s face as I seed him on the rick!\xe2\x80\x94thought I\r\ndid! And where be ye trading o\xe2\x80\x99t to now, shepherd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of biding here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowed yer grandfather for years and years!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the maltster,\r\nthe words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum\r\npreviously imparted had been sufficient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94and did you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnowed yer grandmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise knowed yer father when he was a child. Why, my boy Jacob\r\nthere and your father were sworn brothers\xe2\x80\x94that they were sure\xe2\x80\x94weren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye, Jacob?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said his son, a young man about sixty-five, with a\r\nsemi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw, which\r\nmade much of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut \xe2\x80\x99twas Joe had most to do with him. However, my son William must\r\nhave knowed the very man afore us\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye, Billy, afore ye left\r\nNorcombe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, \xe2\x80\x99twas Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s son Billy, a child of forty, or\r\nthereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful\r\nsoul in a gloomy body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla\r\nshade here and there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can mind Andrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, \xe2\x80\x9cas being a man in the place when I was\r\nquite a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94the other day I and my youngest daughter, Liddy, were over at my\r\ngrandson\xe2\x80\x99s christening,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Billy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking about this\r\nvery family, and \xe2\x80\x99twas only last Purification Day in this very world,\r\nwhen the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor folk, you know,\r\nshepherd, and I can mind the day because they all had to traypse up to\r\nthe vestry\xe2\x80\x94yes, this very man\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, shepherd, and drink. \xe2\x80\x99Tis gape and swaller with us\xe2\x80\x94a drap of\r\nsommit, but not of much account,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster, removing from the\r\nfire his eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing into it\r\nfor so many years. \xe2\x80\x9cTake up the God-forgive-me, Jacob. See if \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nwarm, Jacob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJacob stooped to the God-forgive-me, which was a two-handled tall mug\r\nstanding in the ashes, cracked and charred with heat: it was rather\r\nfurred with extraneous matter about the outside, especially in the\r\ncrevices of the handles, the innermost curves of which may not have\r\nseen daylight for several years by reason of this encrustation\r\nthereon\xe2\x80\x94formed of ashes accidentally wetted with cider and baked hard;\r\nbut to the mind of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that,\r\nbeing incontestably clean on the inside and about the rim. It may be\r\nobserved that such a class of mug is called a God-forgive-me in\r\nWeatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons; probably because\r\nits size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself when he sees its\r\nbottom in drinking it empty.\r\n\r\nJacob, on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough,\r\nplacidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer, and\r\nhaving pronounced it nearly of the proper degree, raised the cup and\r\nvery civilly attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with\r\nthe skirt of his smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak was a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clane cup for the shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster commandingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, in a reproving tone of considerateness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never fuss about dirt in its pure state, and when I know what sort\r\nit is.\xe2\x80\x9d Taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its\r\ncontents, and duly passed it to the next man. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\ngiving such trouble to neighbours in washing up when there\xe2\x80\x99s so much\r\nwork to be done in the world already,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Oak in a moister tone,\r\nafter recovering from the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by\r\npulls at large mugs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA right sensible man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be gainsaid!\xe2\x80\x9d observed a brisk young man\xe2\x80\x94Mark\r\nClark by name, a genial and pleasant gentleman, whom to meet anywhere\r\nin your travels was to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink\r\nwith was, unfortunately, to pay for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis\xe2\x80\x99ess have sent,\r\nshepherd. The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye chaw quite close, shepherd, for I let the bacon fall in the road\r\noutside as I was bringing it along, and may be \xe2\x80\x99tis rather gritty.\r\nThere, \xe2\x80\x99tis clane dirt; and we all know what that is, as you say, and\r\nyou bain\xe2\x80\x99t a particular man we see, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true\xe2\x80\x94not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friendly Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let your teeth quite meet, and you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel the sandiness at\r\nall. Ah! \xe2\x80\x99tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own mind exactly, neighbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s his grandfer\xe2\x80\x99s own grandson!\xe2\x80\x94his grandfer were just such a\r\nnice unparticular man!\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, Henry Fray\xe2\x80\x94drink,\xe2\x80\x9d magnanimously said Jan Coggan, a person who\r\nheld Saint-Simonian notions of share and share alike where liquor was\r\nconcerned, as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual\r\nrevolution among them.\r\n\r\nHaving at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into mid-air,\r\nHenry did not refuse. He was a man of more than middle age, with\r\neyebrows high up in his forehead, who laid it down that the law of the\r\nworld was bad, with a long-suffering look through his listeners at the\r\nworld alluded to, as it presented itself to his imagination. He always\r\nsigned his name \xe2\x80\x9cHenery\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94strenuously insisting upon that spelling, and\r\nif any passing schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second \xe2\x80\x9ce\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nsuperfluous and old-fashioned, he received the reply that \xe2\x80\x9cH-e-n-e-r-y\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas the name he was christened and the name he would stick to\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ntone of one to whom orthographical differences were matters which had a\r\ngreat deal to do with personal character.\r\n\r\nMr. Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery, was a crimson man\r\nwith a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye, whose name\r\nhad appeared on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbouring\r\nparishes as best man and chief witness in countless unions of the\r\nprevious twenty years; he also very frequently filled the post of head\r\ngodfather in baptisms of the subtly-jovial kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mark Clark\xe2\x80\x94come. Ther\xe2\x80\x99s plenty more in the barrel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94that I will, \xe2\x80\x99tis my only doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Clark, who, twenty\r\nyears younger than Jan Coggan, revolved in the same orbit. He secreted\r\nmirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han\xe2\x80\x99t had a drop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Coggan to a\r\nself-conscious man in the background, thrusting the cup towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a modest man as he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob Smallbury. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, ye\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly\r\nhad strength of eye enough to look in our young mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99s face, so I\r\nhear, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly looked at her at all,\xe2\x80\x9d simpered Joseph, reducing his\r\nbody smaller whilst talking, apparently from a meek sense of undue\r\nprominence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I seed her, \xe2\x80\x99twas nothing but blushes with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor feller,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a curious nature for a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Joseph Poorgrass\xe2\x80\x94his shyness, which was so painful as\r\na defect, filling him with a mild complacency now that it was regarded\r\nas an interesting study. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twere blush, blush, blush with me every\r\nminute of the time, when she was speaking to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know ye to be a very\r\nbashful man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a\xe2\x80\x99 awkward gift for a man, poor soul,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhow long have ye have suffered from it, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ever since I was a boy. Yes\xe2\x80\x94mother was concerned to her heart\r\nabout it\xe2\x80\x94yes. But \xe2\x80\x99twas all nought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid ye ever go into the world to try and stop it, Joseph Poorgrass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ay, tried all sorts o\xe2\x80\x99 company. They took me to Greenhill Fair, and\r\ninto a great gay jerry-go-nimble show, where there were women-folk\r\nriding round\xe2\x80\x94standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their\r\nsmocks; but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t cure me a morsel. And then I was put errand-man\r\nat the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Skittle Alley at the back of the Tailor\xe2\x80\x99s Arms in\r\nCasterbridge. \xe2\x80\x99Twas a horrible sinful situation, and a very curious\r\nplace for a good man. I had to stand and look ba\xe2\x80\x99dy people in the face\r\nfrom morning till night; but \xe2\x80\x99twas no use\xe2\x80\x94I was just as bad as ever\r\nafter all. Blushes hev been in the family for generations. There, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\na happy providence that I be no worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob Smallbury, deepening his thoughts to a profounder\r\nview of the subject. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a thought to look at, that ye might have\r\nbeen worse; but even as you be, \xe2\x80\x99tis a very bad affliction for \xe2\x80\x99ee,\r\nJoseph. For ye see, shepherd, though \xe2\x80\x99tis very well for a woman, dang\r\nit all, \xe2\x80\x99tis awkward for a man like him, poor feller?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, recovering from a meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, very\r\nawkward for the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very timid, too,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Jan Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce he had been\r\nworking late at Yalbury Bottom, and had had a drap of drink, and lost\r\nhis way as he was coming home-along through Yalbury Wood, didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye,\r\nMaster Poorgrass?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no; not that story!\xe2\x80\x9d expostulated the modest man, forcing a\r\nlaugh to bury his concern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And so \xe2\x80\x99a lost himself quite,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Coggan, with an\r\nimpassive face, implying that a true narrative, like time and tide,\r\nmust run its course and would respect no man. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he was coming\r\nalong in the middle of the night, much afeared, and not able to find\r\nhis way out of the trees nohow, \xe2\x80\x99a cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Man-a-lost! man-a-lost!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nA owl in a tree happened to be crying \xe2\x80\x98Whoo-whoo-whoo!\xe2\x80\x99 as owls do, you\r\nknow, shepherd\xe2\x80\x9d (Gabriel nodded), \xe2\x80\x9cand Joseph, all in a tremble, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, now\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s too much!\xe2\x80\x9d said the timid man, becoming a man of\r\nbrazen courage all of a sudden. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say _sir_. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x98Joseph Poorgrass o\xe2\x80\x99 Weatherbury, sir.\xe2\x80\x99 No, no; what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very well\r\nthat no man of a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s rank would be hollering there at that time\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 night. \xe2\x80\x98Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s every word I said,\r\nand I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 said that if \xe2\x80\x99t hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for Keeper Day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmetheglin.... There, \xe2\x80\x99twas a merciful thing it ended where it did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company,\r\nJan went on meditatively:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s the fearfullest man, bain\xe2\x80\x99t ye, Joseph? Ay, another time ye\r\nwere lost by Lambing-Down Gate, weren\xe2\x80\x99t ye, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Poorgrass, as if there were some conditions too\r\nserious even for modesty to remember itself under, this being one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that were the middle of the night, too. The gate would not open,\r\ntry how he would, and knowing there was the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s hand in it, he\r\nkneeled down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire,\r\nthe cider, and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the\r\nexperience alluded to. \xe2\x80\x9cMy heart died within me, that time; but I\r\nkneeled down and said the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer, and then the Belief right\r\nthrough, and then the Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer. But no, the\r\ngate wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t open; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren,\r\nand, thinks I, this makes four, and \xe2\x80\x99tis all I know out of book, and if\r\nthis don\xe2\x80\x99t do it nothing will, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a lost man. Well, when I got to\r\nSaying After Me, I rose from my knees and found the gate would\r\nopen\xe2\x80\x94yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and\r\nduring its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit, which\r\nglowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their\r\neyes long and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the depth\r\nof the subject discussed.\r\n\r\nGabriel broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a place is this to live at,\r\nand what sort of a mis\xe2\x80\x99ess is she to work under?\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s bosom\r\nthrilled gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the\r\ninner-most subject of his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe d\xe2\x80\x99 know little of her\xe2\x80\x94nothing. She only showed herself a few days\r\nago. Her uncle was took bad, and the doctor was called with his\r\nworld-wide skill; but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t save the man. As I take it, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to keep on the farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s about the shape o\xe2\x80\x99t, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cAy, \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\nvery good family. I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon be under \xe2\x80\x99em as under one here and there.\r\nHer uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know en, shepherd\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nbachelor-man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI used to go to his house a-courting my first wife, Charlotte, who was\r\nhis dairymaid. Well, a very good-hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and\r\nI being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see her and\r\ndrink as much ale as I liked, but not to carry away any\xe2\x80\x94outside my skin\r\nI mane of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer maning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you see \xe2\x80\x99twas beautiful ale, and I wished to value his kindness\r\nas much as I could, and not to be so ill-mannered as to drink only a\r\nthimbleful, which would have been insulting the man\xe2\x80\x99s generosity\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Master Coggan, \xe2\x80\x99twould so,\xe2\x80\x9d corroborated Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going, and then by the\r\ntime I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket\xe2\x80\x94so thorough dry that\r\nthat ale would slip down\xe2\x80\x94ah, \xe2\x80\x99twould slip down sweet! Happy times!\r\nHeavenly times! Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that house! You\r\ncan mind, Jacob? You used to go wi\xe2\x80\x99 me sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x94I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob. \xe2\x80\x9cThat one, too, that we had at Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Head\r\non a White Monday was a pretty tipple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas. But for a wet of the better class, that brought you no nearer\r\nto the horned man than you were afore you begun, there was none like\r\nthose in Farmer Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen. Not a single damn allowed; no, not\r\na bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment when all were\r\nblindest, though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there at\r\nsuch times is a great relief to a merry soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster. \xe2\x80\x9cNater requires her swearing at the regular\r\ntimes, or she\xe2\x80\x99s not herself; and unholy exclamations is a necessity of\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Coggan\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot a word of the sort would\r\nCharlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain.... Ay, poor\r\nCharlotte, I wonder if she had the good fortune to get into Heaven when\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a died! But \xe2\x80\x99a was never much in luck\xe2\x80\x99s way, and perhaps \xe2\x80\x99a went\r\ndownwards after all, poor soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did any of you know Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nthe shepherd, who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in\r\nthe desired channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew them a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob Smallbury; \xe2\x80\x9cbut they were townsfolk,\r\nand didn\xe2\x80\x99t live here. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been dead for years. Father, what sort of\r\npeople were mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99 father and mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster, \xe2\x80\x9che wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much to look at; but she was a\r\nlovely woman. He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsed to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o\xe2\x80\x99 times, so \xe2\x80\x99twas said,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was very proud of her, too, when they were married, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntold,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cHe admired her so much that he used to light the\r\ncandle three times a night to look at her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoundless love; I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have supposed it in the universe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually spoke on a large scale in his\r\nmoral reflections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis true enough. I knowed the man and woman both well. Levi\r\nEverdene\xe2\x80\x94that was the man\xe2\x80\x99s name, sure. \xe2\x80\x98Man,\xe2\x80\x99 saith I in my hurry, but\r\nhe were of a higher circle of life than that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99a was a gentleman-tailor\r\nreally, worth scores of pounds. And he became a very celebrated\r\nbankrupt two or three times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought he was quite a common man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! That man failed for heaps of money; hundreds in gold and\r\nsilver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maltster being rather short of breath, Mr. Coggan, after absently\r\nscrutinising a coal which had fallen among the ashes, took up the\r\nnarrative, with a private twirl of his eye:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, you\xe2\x80\x99d hardly believe it, but that man\xe2\x80\x94our Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94was one of the ficklest husbands alive, after a while.\r\nUnderstand? \xe2\x80\x99a didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be fickle, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it. The\r\npore feller were faithful and true enough to her in his wish, but his\r\nheart would rove, do what he would. He spoke to me in real tribulation\r\nabout it once. \xe2\x80\x98Coggan,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I could never wish for a handsomer\r\nwoman than I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, but feeling she\xe2\x80\x99s ticketed as my lawful wife, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help my wicked heart wandering, do what I will.\xe2\x80\x99 But at last I\r\nbelieve he cured it by making her take off her wedding-ring and calling\r\nher by her maiden name as they sat together after the shop was shut,\r\nand so \xe2\x80\x99a would get to fancy she was only his sweetheart, and not\r\nmarried to him at all. And as soon as he could thoroughly fancy he was\r\ndoing wrong and committing the seventh, \xe2\x80\x99a got to like her as well as\r\never, and they lived on a perfect picture of mutel love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99twas a most ungodly remedy,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Joseph Poorgrass; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we\r\nought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it from\r\nbeing any worse. You see, he might have gone the bad road and given his\r\neyes to unlawfulness entirely\xe2\x80\x94yes, gross unlawfulness, so to say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Billy Smallbury, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man\xe2\x80\x99s will was to do right, sure\r\nenough, but his heart didn\xe2\x80\x99t chime in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe got so much better, that he was quite godly in his later years,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Jan?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cHe got himself confirmed over\r\nagain in a more serious way, and took to saying \xe2\x80\x98Amen\xe2\x80\x99 almost as loud\r\nas the clerk, and he liked to copy comforting verses from the\r\ntombstones. He used, too, to hold the money-plate at Let Your Light so\r\nShine, and stand godfather to poor little come-by-chance children; and\r\nhe kept a missionary box upon his table to nab folks unawares when they\r\ncalled; yes, and he would box the charity-boys\xe2\x80\x99 ears, if they laughed\r\nin church, till they could hardly stand upright, and do other deeds of\r\npiety natural to the saintly inclined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, at that time he thought of nothing but high things,\xe2\x80\x9d added Billy\r\nSmallbury. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day Parson Thirdly met him and said, \xe2\x80\x98Good-Morning,\r\nMister Everdene; \xe2\x80\x99tis a fine day!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Amen\xe2\x80\x99 said Everdene, quite\r\nabsent-like, thinking only of religion when he seed a parson. Yes, he\r\nwas a very Christian man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir daughter was not at all a pretty chiel at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHenery Fray. \xe2\x80\x9cNever should have thought she\xe2\x80\x99d have growed up such a\r\nhandsome body as she is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; but the baily will have most to do with the business and\r\nourselves. Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d Henery gazed into the ashpit, and smiled volumes of\r\nironical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA queer Christian, like the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s head in a cowl,[1] as the saying\r\nis,\xe2\x80\x9d volunteered Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery, implying that irony must cease at a certain\r\npoint. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween we two, man and man, I believe that man would as soon\r\ntell a lie Sundays as working-days\xe2\x80\x94that I do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood faith, you do talk!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of bitter moods, looking round upon the\r\ncompany with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener\r\nappreciation of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there\xe2\x80\x99s people of one sort, and people of another, but that\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94bless your souls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel thought fit to change the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be a very aged\r\nman, malter, to have sons growed mild and ancient,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather\xe2\x80\x99s so old that \xe2\x80\x99a can\xe2\x80\x99t mind his age, can ye, father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninterposed Jacob. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s growed terrible crooked too, lately,\xe2\x80\x9d Jacob\r\ncontinued, surveying his father\xe2\x80\x99s figure, which was rather more bowed\r\nthan his own. \xe2\x80\x9cReally one may say that father there is three-double.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrooked folk will last a long while,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster, grimly, and\r\nnot in the best humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life, father\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye, shepherd?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that I should,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel with the heartiness of a man who had\r\nlonged to hear it for several months. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat may your age be, malter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis,\r\nand elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit, said, in\r\nthe slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so\r\ngenerally felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the year I were born in, but perhaps I can reckon\r\nup the places I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived at, and so get it that way. I bode at Upper\r\nLongpuddle across there\xe2\x80\x9d (nodding to the north) \xe2\x80\x9ctill I were eleven. I\r\nbode seven at Kingsbere\xe2\x80\x9d (nodding to the east) \xe2\x80\x9cwhere I took to\r\nmalting. I went therefrom to Norcombe, and malted there two-and-twenty\r\nyears, and-two-and-twenty years I was there turnip-hoeing and\r\nharvesting. Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe, years afore you were\r\nthought of, Master Oak\xe2\x80\x9d (Oak smiled sincere belief in the fact). \xe2\x80\x9cThen\r\nI malted at Durnover four year, and four year turnip-hoeing; and I was\r\nfourteen times eleven months at Millpond St. Jude\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d (nodding\r\nnorth-west-by-north). \xe2\x80\x9cOld Twills wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hire me for more than eleven\r\nmonths at a time, to keep me from being chargeable to the parish if so\r\nbe I was disabled. Then I was three year at Mellstock, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nhere one-and-thirty year come Candlemas. How much is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and seventeen,\xe2\x80\x9d chuckled another old gentleman, given to\r\nmental arithmetic and little conversation, who had hitherto sat\r\nunobserved in a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, that\xe2\x80\x99s my age,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, father!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob. \xe2\x80\x9cYour turnip-hoeing were in the summer and\r\nyour malting in the winter of the same years, and ye don\xe2\x80\x99t ought to\r\ncount-both halves, father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChok\xe2\x80\x99 it all! I lived through the summers, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? That\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nquestion. I suppose ye\xe2\x80\x99ll say next I be no age at all to speak of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure we shan\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, soothingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe be a very old aged person, malter,\xe2\x80\x9d attested Jan Coggan, also\r\nsoothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know that, and ye must have a wonderful talented\r\nconstitution to be able to live so long, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t he, neighbours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true; ye must, malter, wonderful,\xe2\x80\x9d said the meeting unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe maltster, being now pacified, was even generous enough to\r\nvoluntarily disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a\r\ngreat many years, by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out of\r\nwas three years older than he.\r\n\r\nWhile the cup was being examined, the end of Gabriel Oak\xe2\x80\x99s flute became\r\nvisible over his smock-frock pocket, and Henery Fray exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, shepherd, I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at\r\nCasterbridge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, blushing faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in great trouble,\r\nneighbours, and was driven to it. I used not to be so poor as I be\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cYou should take it\r\ncareless-like, shepherd, and your time will come. But we could thank ye\r\nfor a tune, if ye bain\xe2\x80\x99t too tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither drum nor trumpet have I heard since Christmas,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan\r\nCoggan. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, raise a tune, Master Oak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, pulling out his flute and putting it\r\ntogether. \xe2\x80\x9cA poor tool, neighbours; but such as I can do ye shall have\r\nand welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak then struck up \xe2\x80\x9cJockey to the Fair,\xe2\x80\x9d and played that sparkling\r\nmelody three times through, accenting the notes in the third round in a\r\nmost artistic and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and\r\ntapping with his foot to beat time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can blow the flute very well\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x99a can,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young married\r\nman, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as \xe2\x80\x9cSusan\r\nTall\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d as lief as not be able to blow into\r\na flute as well as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a clever man, and \xe2\x80\x99tis a true comfort for us to have such a\r\nshepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in a soft cadence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to\r\nfeel full o\xe2\x80\x99 thanksgiving that he\xe2\x80\x99s not a player of ba\xe2\x80\x99dy songs instead\r\nof these merry tunes; for \xe2\x80\x99twould have been just as easy for God to\r\nhave made the shepherd a loose low man\xe2\x80\x94a man of iniquity, so to speak\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94as what he is. Yes, for our wives\xe2\x80\x99 and daughters\xe2\x80\x99 sakes we should\r\nfeel real thanksgiving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x94real thanksgiving!\xe2\x80\x9d dashed in Mark Clark conclusively, not\r\nfeeling it to be of any consequence to his opinion that he had only\r\nheard about a word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Joseph, beginning to feel like a man in the Bible; \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nevil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the\r\ncleanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon\r\nthe turnpike, if I may term it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I can mind yer face now, shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery Fray, criticising\r\nGabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second tune. \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94now I\r\nsee \xe2\x80\x99ee blowing into the flute I know \xe2\x80\x99ee to be the same man I see play\r\nat Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes a-staring\r\nout like a strangled man\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94just as they be now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a\r\nscarecrow,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Mark Clark, with additional criticism of\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, the latter person jerking out, with the ghastly\r\ngrimace required by the instrument, the chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cDame Durden:\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas Moll\xe2\x80\x99 and Bet\xe2\x80\x99, and Doll\xe2\x80\x99 and Kate\xe2\x80\x99,\r\nAnd Dor\xe2\x80\x99-othy Drag\xe2\x80\x99-gle Tail\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that young man\xe2\x80\x99s bad manners in naming your\r\nfeatures?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Joseph to Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor by nature ye be a very handsome man, shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Joseph\r\nPoorgrass, with winning sauvity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that ye be, shepard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, in the modest tone good manners\r\ndemanded, thinking, however, that he would never let Bathsheba see him\r\nplaying the flute; in this resolve showing a discretion equal to that\r\nrelated to its sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old\r\nmaltster, not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nwere called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94everybody said\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanged if ye bain\xe2\x80\x99t altered now, malter,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice with the vigour\r\nnatural to the enunciation of a remarkably evident truism. It came from\r\nthe old man in the background, whose offensiveness and spiteful ways\r\nwere barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he contributed to\r\ngeneral laughs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye play no more shepherd\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband, the young\r\nmarried man who had spoken once before. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be moving and when\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires. If I thought after\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d left that music was still playing, and I not there, I should be\r\nquite melancholy-like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s yer hurry then, Laban?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used to bide as\r\nlate as the latest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy vocation now, and so ye see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The young man halted lamely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband, in a tone intended\r\nto imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all.\r\nThe young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.\r\n\r\nHenery Fray was the first to follow. Then Gabriel arose and went off\r\nwith Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging. A few minutes later,\r\nwhen the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray\r\ncame back again in a hurry. Flourishing his finger ominously he threw a\r\ngaze teeming with tidings just where his eye alighted by accident,\r\nwhich happened to be in Joseph Poorgrass\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Henery?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, starting\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a-brewing, Henery?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jacob and Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaily Pennyways\xe2\x80\x94Baily Pennyways\xe2\x80\x94I said so; yes, I said so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, found out stealing anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStealing it is. The news is, that after Miss Everdene got home she\r\nwent out again to see all was safe, as she usually do, and coming in\r\nfound Baily Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a\r\nbushel of barley. She fleed at him like a cat\xe2\x80\x94never such a tomboy as\r\nshe is\xe2\x80\x94of course I speak with closed doors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do\xe2\x80\x94you do, Henery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe fleed at him, and, to cut a long story short, he owned to having\r\ncarried off five sack altogether, upon her promising not to persecute\r\nhim. Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s turned out neck and crop, and my question is, who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoing to be baily now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink\r\nthere and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly\r\nvisible inside. Before he had replaced it on the table, in came the\r\nyoung man, Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband, in a still greater hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave ye heard the news that\xe2\x80\x99s all over parish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Baily Pennyways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut besides that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not a morsel of it!\xe2\x80\x9d they replied, looking into the very midst of\r\nLaban Tall as if to meet his words half-way down his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a night of horrors!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Joseph Poorgrass, waving his hands\r\nspasmodically. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad\r\nenough for a murder, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a magpie all alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny Robin\xe2\x80\x94Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s youngest servant\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t be found. They\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeen wanting to lock up the door these two hours, but she isn\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nin. And they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do about going to bed for fear of\r\nlocking her out. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so concerned if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nnoticed in such low spirits these last few days, and Maryann d\xe2\x80\x99 think\r\nthe beginning of a crowner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest has happened to the poor girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis burned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis burned!\xe2\x80\x9d came from Joseph Poorgrass\xe2\x80\x99s dry lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis drowned!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr \xe2\x80\x99tis her father\xe2\x80\x99s razor!\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Billy Smallbury, with a vivid\r\nsense of detail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go to\r\nbed. What with this trouble about the baily, and now about the girl,\r\nmis\xe2\x80\x99ess is almost wild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse, excepting the old\r\nmaltster, whom neither news, fire, rain, nor thunder could draw from\r\nhis hole. There, as the others\xe2\x80\x99 footsteps died away he sat down again\r\nand continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red, bleared\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s head and\r\nshoulders, robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre any of my men among you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, several,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in the\r\nvillages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin. Do it\r\nquietly; there is no reason for alarm as yet. She must have left whilst\r\nwe were all at the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the\r\nparish, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jacob Smallbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of any such thing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said two or three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hardly likely, either,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cFor any lover of\r\nhers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad. The\r\nmost mysterious matter connected with her absence\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the only\r\nthing which gives me serious alarm\xe2\x80\x94is that she was seen to go out of\r\nthe house by Maryann with only her indoor working gown on\xe2\x80\x94not even a\r\nbonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, excusing my words, that a young woman would\r\nhardly go to see her young man without dressing up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob,\r\nturning his mental vision upon past experiences. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true\xe2\x80\x94she would\r\nnot, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nfemale voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nshe had no young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, and I\r\nbelieve he\xe2\x80\x99s a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know his name?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mistress; she was very close about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I might be able to find out if I went to Casterbridge\r\nbarracks,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Smallbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t return to-morrow, mind you go there and try\r\nto discover which man it is, and see him. I feel more responsible than\r\nI should if she had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope she\r\nhas come to no harm through a man of that kind.... And then there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis disgraceful affair of the bailiff\xe2\x80\x94but I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak of him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did not\r\nthink it worth while to dwell upon any particular one. \xe2\x80\x9cDo as I told\r\nyou, then,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in conclusion, closing the casement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, mistress; we will,\xe2\x80\x9d they replied, and moved away.\r\n\r\nThat night at Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s, Gabriel Oak, beneath the screen of closed\r\neyelids, was busy with fancies, and full of movement, like a river\r\nflowing rapidly under its ice. Night had always been the time at which\r\nhe saw Bathsheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of shadow he\r\ntenderly regarded her image now. It is rarely that the pleasures of the\r\nimagination will compensate for the pain of sleeplessness, but they\r\npossibly did with Oak to-night, for the delight of merely seeing her\r\neffaced for the time his perception of the great difference between\r\nseeing and possessing.\r\n\r\nHe also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from\r\nNorcombe. _The Young Man\xe2\x80\x99s Best Companion_, _The Farrier\xe2\x80\x99s Sure Guide_,\r\n_The Veterinary Surgeon_, _Paradise Lost_, _The Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress_,\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_, Ash\xe2\x80\x99s _Dictionary_, and Walkingame\xe2\x80\x99s _Arithmetic_,\r\nconstituted his library; and though a limited series, it was one from\r\nwhich he had acquired more sound information by diligent perusal than\r\nmany a man of opportunities has done from a furlong of laden shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE HOMESTEAD\xe2\x80\x94A VISITOR\xe2\x80\x94HALF-CONFIDENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy daylight, the bower of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s new-found mistress, Bathsheba Everdene,\r\npresented itself as a hoary building, of the early stage of Classic\r\nRenaissance as regards its architecture, and of a proportion which told\r\nat a glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once been the\r\nmemorial hall upon a small estate around it, now altogether effaced as\r\na distinct property, and merged in the vast tract of a non-resident\r\nlandlord, which comprised several such modest demesnes.\r\n\r\nFluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone, decorated its front, and\r\nabove the roof the chimneys were panelled or columnar, some coped\r\ngables with finials and like features still retaining traces of their\r\nGothic extraction. Soft brown mosses, like faded velveteen, formed\r\ncushions upon the stone tiling, and tufts of the houseleek or sengreen\r\nsprouted from the eaves of the low surrounding buildings. A gravel walk\r\nleading from the door to the road in front was encrusted at the sides\r\nwith more moss\xe2\x80\x94here it was a silver-green variety, the nut-brown of the\r\ngravel being visible to the width of only a foot or two in the centre.\r\nThis circumstance, and the generally sleepy air of the whole prospect\r\nhere, together with the animated and contrasting state of the reverse\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade, suggested to the imagination that on the adaptation of the\r\nbuilding for farming purposes the vital principle of the house had\r\nturned round inside its body to face the other way. Reversals of this\r\nkind, strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often seen to be\r\ninflicted by trade upon edifices\xe2\x80\x94either individual or in the aggregate\r\nas streets and towns\xe2\x80\x94which were originally planned for pleasure alone.\r\n\r\nLively voices were heard this morning in the upper rooms, the main\r\nstaircase to which was of hard oak, the balusters, heavy as bed-posts,\r\nbeing turned and moulded in the quaint fashion of their century, the\r\nhandrail as stout as a parapet-top, and the stairs themselves\r\ncontinually twisting round like a person trying to look over his\r\nshoulder. Going up, the floors above were found to have a very\r\nirregular surface, rising to ridges, sinking into valleys; and being\r\njust then uncarpeted, the face of the boards was seen to be eaten into\r\ninnumerable vermiculations. Every window replied by a clang to the\r\nopening and shutting of every door, a tremble followed every bustling\r\nmovement, and a creak accompanied a walker about the house, like a\r\nspirit, wherever he went.\r\n\r\nIn the room from which the conversation proceeded Bathsheba and her\r\nservant-companion, Liddy Smallbury, were to be discovered sitting upon\r\nthe floor, and sorting a complication of papers, books, bottles, and\r\nrubbish spread out thereon\xe2\x80\x94remnants from the household stores of the\r\nlate occupier. Liddy, the maltster\xe2\x80\x99s great-granddaughter, was about\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s equal in age, and her face was a prominent advertisement of\r\nthe light-hearted English country girl. The beauty her features might\r\nhave lacked in form was amply made up for by perfection of hue, which\r\nat this winter-time was the softened ruddiness on a surface of high\r\nrotundity that we meet with in a Terburg or a Gerard Douw; and, like\r\nthe presentations of those great colourists, it was a face which kept\r\nwell back from the boundary between comeliness and the ideal. Though\r\nelastic in nature she was less daring than Bathsheba, and occasionally\r\nshowed some earnestness, which consisted half of genuine feeling, and\r\nhalf of mannerliness superadded by way of duty.\r\n\r\nThrough a partly-opened door the noise of a scrubbing-brush led up to\r\nthe charwoman, Maryann Money, a person who for a face had a circular\r\ndisc, furrowed less by age than by long gazes of perplexity at distant\r\nobjects. To think of her was to get good-humoured; to speak of her was\r\nto raise the image of a dried Normandy pippin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop your scrubbing a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba through the door to her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaryann suspended the brush.\r\n\r\nThe tramp of a horse was apparent, approaching the front of the\r\nbuilding. The paces slackened, turned in at the wicket, and, what was\r\nmost unusual, came up the mossy path close to the door. The door was\r\ntapped with the end of a crop or stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat impertinence!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cTo ride up the\r\nfootpath like that! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he stop at the gate? Lord! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a\r\ngentleman! I see the top of his hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThe further expression of Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s concern was continued by aspect\r\ninstead of narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mrs. Coggan go to the door?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba continued.\r\n\r\nRat-tat-tat-tat resounded more decisively from Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaryann, you go!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, fluttering under the onset of a crowd of\r\nromantic possibilities.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x94see, here\xe2\x80\x99s a mess!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe argument was unanswerable after a glance at Maryann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy\xe2\x80\x94you must,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nLiddy held up her hands and arms, coated with dust from the rubbish\r\nthey were sorting, and looked imploringly at her mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Coggan is going!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, exhaling her relief in\r\nthe form of a long breath which had lain in her bosom a minute or more.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a deep voice said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Everdene at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coggan, and in a minute appeared in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, what a thirtover place this world is!\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Coggan (a\r\nwholesome-looking lady who had a voice for each class of remark\r\naccording to the emotion involved; who could toss a pancake or twirl a\r\nmop with the accuracy of pure mathematics, and who at this moment\r\nshowed hands shaggy with fragments of dough and arms encrusted with\r\nflour). \xe2\x80\x9cI am never up to my elbows, Miss, in making a pudding but one\r\nof two things do happen\xe2\x80\x94either my nose must needs begin tickling, and I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t live without scratching it, or somebody knocks at the door.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Boldwood wanting to see you, Miss Everdene.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress being a part of her countenance, and any disorder in\r\nthe one being of the same nature with a malformation or wound in the\r\nother, Bathsheba said at once\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see him in this state. Whatever shall I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury farmhouses, so\r\nLiddy suggested\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSay you\xe2\x80\x99re a fright with dust, and can\xe2\x80\x99t come down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that sounds very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coggan, critically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him\xe2\x80\x94that will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Coggan went downstairs, and returned the answer as requested,\r\nadding, however, on her own responsibility, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss is dusting bottles,\r\nsir, and is quite a object\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s why \xe2\x80\x99tis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the deep voice indifferently. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I wanted to\r\nask was, if anything had been heard of Fanny Robin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, sir\xe2\x80\x94but we may know to-night. William Smallbury is gone to\r\nCasterbridge, where her young man lives, as is supposed, and the other\r\nmen be inquiring about everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse\xe2\x80\x99s tramp then recommenced and retreated, and the door closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mr. Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman-farmer at Little Weatherbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty, I should say\xe2\x80\x94very handsome\xe2\x80\x94rather stern-looking\xe2\x80\x94and rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bother this dusting is! I am always in some unfortunate plight\r\nor other,\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba said, complainingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he inquire about\r\nFanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, because, as she had no friends in her childhood, he took her and\r\nput her to school, and got her her place here under your uncle. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nvery kind man that way, but Lord\xe2\x80\x94there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever was such a hopeless man for a woman! He\xe2\x80\x99s been courted by sixes\r\nand sevens\xe2\x80\x94all the girls, gentle and simple, for miles round, have\r\ntried him. Jane Perkins worked at him for two months like a slave, and\r\nthe two Miss Taylors spent a year upon him, and he cost Farmer Ives\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter nights of tears and twenty pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of new clothes; but\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x94the money might as well have been thrown out of the window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little boy came up at this moment and looked in upon them. This child\r\nwas one of the Coggans, who, with the Smallburys, were as common among\r\nthe families of this district as the Avons and Derwents among our\r\nrivers. He always had a loosened tooth or a cut finger to show to\r\nparticular friends, which he did with an air of being thereby elevated\r\nabove the common herd of afflictionless humanity\xe2\x80\x94to which exhibition\r\npeople were expected to say \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child!\xe2\x80\x9d with a dash of congratulation\r\nas well as pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pen-nee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Master Coggan in a scanning measure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94who gave it you, Teddy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMis-terr Bold-wood! He gave it to me for opening the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going, my little man?\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98To Miss\r\nEverdene\xe2\x80\x99s please,\xe2\x80\x99 and he said, \xe2\x80\x98She is a staid woman, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she, my\r\nlittle man?\xe2\x80\x99 and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty child! What did you say that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Cause he gave me the penny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pucker everything is in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, discontentedly when\r\nthe child had gone. \xe2\x80\x9cGet away, Maryann, or go on with your scrubbing,\r\nor do something! You ought to be married by this time, and not here\r\ntroubling me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, mistress\xe2\x80\x94so I did. But what between the poor men I won\xe2\x80\x99t have, and\r\nthe rich men who won\xe2\x80\x99t have me, I stand as a pelican in the\r\nwilderness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anybody ever want to marry you miss?\xe2\x80\x9d Liddy ventured to ask when\r\nthey were again alone. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of \xe2\x80\x99em, I daresay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but the temptation to\r\nsay yes, since it was really in her power was irresistible by aspiring\r\nvirginity, in spite of her spleen at having been published as old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man wanted to once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a highly experienced tone, and the\r\nimage of Gabriel Oak, as the farmer, rose before her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow nice it must seem!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, with the fixed features of mental\r\nrealization. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite good enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow sweet to be able to disdain, when most of us are glad to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 I seem I hear it. \xe2\x80\x98No, sir\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m your better.\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Kiss my\r\nfoot, sir; my face is for mouths of consequence.\xe2\x80\x99 And did you love him,\r\nmiss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. But I rather liked him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94what footsteps are those I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy looked from a back window into the courtyard behind, which was\r\nnow getting low-toned and dim with the earliest films of night. A\r\ncrooked file of men was approaching the back door. The whole string of\r\ntrailing individuals advanced in the completest balance of intention,\r\nlike the remarkable creatures known as Chain Salp\xc3\xa6, which, distinctly\r\norganized in other respects, have one will common to a whole family.\r\nSome were, as usual, in snow-white smock-frocks of Russia duck, and\r\nsome in whitey-brown ones of drabbet\xe2\x80\x94marked on the wrists, breasts,\r\nbacks, and sleeves with honeycomb-work. Two or three women in pattens\r\nbrought up the rear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Philistines be upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, making her nose white against\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. Maryann, go down and keep them in the kitchen till I am\r\ndressed, and then show them in to me in the hall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nMISTRESS AND MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later Bathsheba, in finished dress, and followed by Liddy,\r\nentered the upper end of the old hall to find that her men had all\r\ndeposited themselves on a long form and a settle at the lower\r\nextremity. She sat down at a table and opened the time-book, pen in her\r\nhand, with a canvas money-bag beside her. From this she poured a small\r\nheap of coin. Liddy chose a position at her elbow and began to sew,\r\nsometimes pausing and looking round, or, with the air of a privileged\r\nperson, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying before her and\r\nsurveying it merely as a work of art, while strictly preventing her\r\ncountenance from expressing any wish to possess it as money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow before I begin, men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, \xe2\x80\x9cI have two matters to speak\r\nof. The first is that the bailiff is dismissed for thieving, and that I\r\nhave formed a resolution to have no bailiff at all, but to manage\r\neverything with my own head and hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men breathed an audible breath of amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next matter is, have you heard anything of Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you done anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met Farmer Boldwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jacob Smallbury, \xe2\x80\x9cand I went with him and\r\ntwo of his men, and dragged Newmill Pond, but we found nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the new shepherd have been to Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Head, by Yalbury, thinking\r\nshe had gone there, but nobody had seed her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laban Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t William Smallbury been to Casterbridge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet come home. He promised to be back by\r\nsix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wants a quarter to six at present,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, looking at her\r\nwatch. \xe2\x80\x9cI daresay he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in directly. Well, now then\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she looked into\r\nthe book\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJoseph Poorgrass, are you there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir\xe2\x80\x94ma\xe2\x80\x99am I mane,\xe2\x80\x9d said the person addressed. \xe2\x80\x9cI be the personal\r\nname of Poorgrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in my own eye. In the eye of other people\xe2\x80\x94well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nit; though public thought will out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do on the farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do do carting things all the year, and in seed time I shoots the\r\nrooks and sparrows, and helps at pig-killing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease nine and ninepence and a good halfpenny where \xe2\x80\x99twas a bad one,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x94ma\xe2\x80\x99am I mane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite correct. Now here are ten shillings in addition as a small\r\npresent, as I am a new comer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being generous in public,\r\nand Henery Fray, who had drawn up towards her chair, lifted his\r\neyebrows and fingers to express amazement on a small scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much do I owe you\xe2\x80\x94that man in the corner\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x99s your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Moon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said a singular framework of clothes with\r\nnothing of any consequence inside them, which advanced with the toes in\r\nno definite direction forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to\r\nswing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Mark, did you say?\xe2\x80\x94speak out\xe2\x80\x94I shall not hurt you,\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\nthe young farmer, kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Moon, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery Fray, correctingly, from behind her\r\nchair, to which point he had edged himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bathsheba, turning her bright eyes to the\r\nbook. \xe2\x80\x9cTen and twopence halfpenny is the sum put down to you, I see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mis\xe2\x80\x99ess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew, as the rustle of wind among dead leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, and ten shillings. Now the next\xe2\x80\x94Andrew Randle, you are a\r\nnew man, I hear. How come you to leave your last farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, p-p-p-p-pl-pl-\r\npl-pl-please, ma\xe2\x80\x99am-please\xe2\x80\x99m-please\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99A\xe2\x80\x99s a stammering man, mem,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery Fray in an undertone, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthey turned him away because the only time he ever did speak plain he\r\nsaid his soul was his own, and other iniquities, to the squire. \xe2\x80\x99A can\r\ncuss, mem, as well as you or I, but \xe2\x80\x99a can\xe2\x80\x99t speak a common speech to\r\nsave his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew Randle, here\xe2\x80\x99s yours\xe2\x80\x94finish thanking me in a day or two.\r\nTemperance Miller\xe2\x80\x94oh, here\xe2\x80\x99s another, Soberness\xe2\x80\x94both women I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m. Here we be, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve,\xe2\x80\x9d was echoed in shrill unison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTending thrashing-machine and wimbling haybonds, and saying \xe2\x80\x98Hoosh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto the cocks and hens when they go upon your seeds, and planting Early\r\nFlourballs and Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s Wonderfuls with a dibble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I see. Are they satisfactory women?\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired softly of Henery\r\nFray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh mem\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me! Yielding women\xe2\x80\x94as scarlet a pair as ever was!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ngroaned Henery under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, mem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, in the background twitched, and his lips became dry\r\nwith fear of some terrible consequences, as he saw Bathsheba summarily\r\nspeaking, and Henery slinking off to a corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow the next. Laban Tall, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stay on working for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you or anybody that pays me well, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94the man must live!\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman in the back quarter, who had\r\njust entered with clicking pattens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat woman is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI be his lawful wife!\xe2\x80\x9d continued the voice with greater prominence of\r\nmanner and tone. This lady called herself five-and-twenty, looked\r\nthirty, passed as thirty-five, and was forty. She was a woman who\r\nnever, like some newly married, showed conjugal tenderness in public,\r\nperhaps because she had none to show.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Laban, will you stay on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll stay, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said again the shrill tongue of Laban\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlawful wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he can speak for himself, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord, not he, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! A simple tool. Well enough, but a poor\r\ngawkhammer mortal,\xe2\x80\x9d the wife replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh-heh-heh!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the married man with a hideous effort of\r\nappreciation, for he was as irrepressibly good-humoured under ghastly\r\nsnubs as a parliamentary candidate on the hustings.\r\n\r\nThe names remaining were called in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I think I have done with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, closing the book\r\nand shaking back a stray twine of hair. \xe2\x80\x9cHas William Smallbury\r\nreturned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe new shepherd will want a man under him,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Henery Fray,\r\ntrying to make himself official again by a sideway approach towards her\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94he will. Who can he have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Cain Ball is a very good lad,\xe2\x80\x9d Henery said, \xe2\x80\x9cand Shepherd Oak\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mind his youth?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning with an apologetic smile to\r\nthe shepherd, who had just appeared on the scene, and was now leaning\r\nagainst the doorpost with his arms folded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did Cain come by such a name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you see, mem, his pore mother, not being a Scripture-read woman,\r\nmade a mistake at his christening, thinking \xe2\x80\x99twas Abel killed Cain, and\r\ncalled en Cain, meaning Abel all the time. The parson put it right, but\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas too late, for the name could never be got rid of in the parish.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis very unfortunate for the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. However, we soften it down as much as we can, and call him Cainy.\r\nAh, pore widow-woman! she cried her heart out about it almost. She was\r\nbrought up by a very heathen father and mother, who never sent her to\r\nchurch or school, and it shows how the sins of the parents are visited\r\nupon the children, mem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degree of melancholy\r\nrequired when the persons involved in the given misfortune do not\r\nbelong to your own family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well then, Cainey Ball to be under-shepherd. And you quite\r\nunderstand your duties?\xe2\x80\x94you I mean, Gabriel Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite well, I thank you, Miss Everdene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shepherd Oak from the\r\ndoorpost. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel was rather staggered by\r\nthe remarkable coolness of her manner. Certainly nobody without\r\nprevious information would have dreamt that Oak and the handsome woman\r\nbefore whom he stood had ever been other than strangers. But perhaps\r\nher air was the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced\r\nher from a cottage to a large house and fields. The case is not\r\nunexampled in high places. When, in the writings of the later poets,\r\nJove and his family are found to have moved from their cramped quarters\r\non the peak of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show a\r\nproportionate increase of arrogance and reserve.\r\n\r\nFootsteps were heard in the passage, combining in their character the\r\nqualities both of weight and measure, rather at the expense of\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\n(All.) \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Billy Smallbury come from Casterbridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the news?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, as William, after marching to\r\nthe middle of the hall, took a handkerchief from his hat and wiped his\r\nforehead from its centre to its remoter boundaries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have been sooner, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the\r\nweather.\xe2\x80\x9d He then stamped with each foot severely, and on looking down\r\nhis boots were perceived to be clogged with snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome at last, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in round numbers, she\xe2\x80\x99s run away with the soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not a steady girl like Fanny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell ye all particulars. When I got to Casterbridge Barracks,\r\nthey said, \xe2\x80\x98The Eleventh Dragoon-Guards be gone away, and new troops\r\nhave come.\xe2\x80\x99 The Eleventh left last week for Melchester and onwards. The\r\nRoute came from Government like a thief in the night, as is his nature\r\nto, and afore the Eleventh knew it almost, they were on the march. They\r\npassed near here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel had listened with interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw them go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued William, \xe2\x80\x9cthey pranced down the street playing \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nGirl I Left Behind Me,\xe2\x80\x99 so \xe2\x80\x99tis said, in glorious notes of triumph.\r\nEvery looker-on\xe2\x80\x99s inside shook with the blows of the great drum to his\r\ndeepest vitals, and there was not a dry eye throughout the town among\r\nthe public-house people and the nameless women!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99re not gone to any war?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but they be gone to take the places of them who may, which\r\nis very close connected. And so I said to myself, Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s young man was\r\none of the regiment, and she\xe2\x80\x99s gone after him. There, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that\xe2\x80\x99s it\r\nin black and white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you find out his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; nobody knew it. I believe he was higher in rank than a private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel remained musing and said nothing, for he was in doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are not likely to know more to-night, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one of you had better run across to Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand tell him that much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then rose; but before retiring, addressed a few words to them with\r\na pretty dignity, to which her mourning dress added a soberness that\r\nwas hardly to be found in the words themselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow mind, you have a mistress instead of a master. I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know my\r\npowers or my talents in farming; but I shall do my best, and if you\r\nserve me well, so shall I serve you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t any unfair ones among you\r\n(if there are any such, but I hope not) suppose that because I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\nwoman I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the difference between bad goings-on and\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(All.) \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Liddy.) \xe2\x80\x9cExcellent well said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be up before you are awake; I shall be afield before you are\r\nup; and I shall have breakfasted before you are afield. In short, I\r\nshall astonish you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(All.) \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x99m!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(All.) \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen this small thesmothete stepped from the table, and surged out of\r\nthe hall, her black silk dress licking up a few straws and dragging\r\nthem along with a scratching noise upon the floor. Liddy, elevating her\r\nfeelings to the occasion from a sense of grandeur, floated off behind\r\nBathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely free from travesty, and\r\nthe door was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nOUTSIDE THE BARRACKS\xe2\x80\x94SNOW\xe2\x80\x94A MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nFor dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a\r\ncertain town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury, at\r\na later hour on this same snowy evening\xe2\x80\x94if that may be called a\r\nprospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.\r\n\r\nIt was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing\r\nany great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love\r\nbecomes solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope:\r\nwhen the exercise of memory does not stir feelings of regret at\r\nopportunities for ambition that have been passed by, and anticipation\r\ndoes not prompt to enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river,\r\nbehind which rose a high wall. On the right was a tract of land, partly\r\nmeadow and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide\r\nundulating upland.\r\n\r\nThe changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this kind\r\nthan amid woodland scenery. Still, to a close observer, they are just\r\nas perceptible; the difference is that their media of manifestation are\r\nless trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the bursting of\r\nthe buds or the fall of the leaf. Many are not so stealthy and gradual\r\nas we may be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a\r\nmoor or waste. Winter, in coming to the country hereabout, advanced in\r\nwell-marked stages, wherein might have been successively observed the\r\nretreat of the snakes, the transformation of the ferns, the filling of\r\nthe pools, a rising of fogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse of\r\nthe fungi, and an obliteration by snow.\r\n\r\nThis climax of the series had been reached to-night on the aforesaid\r\nmoor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were\r\nforms without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing,\r\nand without more character than that of being the limit of something\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x94the lowest layer of a firmament of snow. From this chaotic skyful\r\nof crowding flakes the mead and moor momentarily received additional\r\nclothing, only to appear momentarily more naked thereby. The vast arch\r\nof cloud above was strangely low, and formed as it were the roof of a\r\nlarge dark cavern, gradually sinking in upon its floor; for the\r\ninstinctive thought was that the snow lining the heavens and that\r\nencrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass without any\r\nintervening stratum of air at all.\r\n\r\nWe turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics; which were\r\nflatness in respect of the river, verticality in respect of the wall\r\nbehind it, and darkness as to both. These features made up the mass. If\r\nanything could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any\r\nthing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath. The\r\nindistinct summit of the fa\xc3\xa7ade was notched and pronged by chimneys\r\nhere and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong\r\nshapes of windows, though only in the upper part. Below, down to the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.\r\n\r\nAn indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their\r\nregularity, sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy\r\natmosphere. It was a neighbouring clock striking ten. The bell was in\r\nthe open air, and being overlaid with several inches of muffling snow,\r\nhad lost its voice for the time.\r\n\r\nAbout this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell where twenty had\r\nfallen, then one had the room of ten. Not long after a form moved by\r\nthe brink of the river.\r\n\r\nBy its outline upon the colourless background, a close observer might\r\nhave seen that it was small. This was all that was positively\r\ndiscoverable, though it seemed human.\r\n\r\nThe shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow,\r\nthough sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep. At this time\r\nsome words were spoken aloud:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne. Two. Three. Four. Five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBetween each utterance the little shape advanced about half a dozen\r\nyards. It was evident now that the windows high in the wall were being\r\ncounted. The word \xe2\x80\x9cFive\xe2\x80\x9d represented the fifth window from the end of\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\nHere the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller. The figure was stooping.\r\nThen a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window.\r\nIt smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark. The\r\nthrow was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman. No\r\nman who had ever seen bird, rabbit, or squirrel in his childhood, could\r\npossibly have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.\r\n\r\nAnother attempt, and another; till by degrees the wall must have become\r\npimpled with the adhering lumps of snow. At last one fragment struck\r\nthe fifth window.\r\n\r\nThe river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort\r\nwhich races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any\r\nirregularities of speed being immediately corrected by a small\r\nwhirlpool. Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle and\r\ncluck of one of these invisible wheels\xe2\x80\x94together with a few small sounds\r\nwhich a sad man would have called moans, and a happy man\r\nlaughter\xe2\x80\x94caused by the flapping of the waters against trifling objects\r\nin other parts of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe window was struck again in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThen a noise was heard, apparently produced by the opening of the\r\nwindow. This was followed by a voice from the same quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tones were masculine, and not those of surprise. The high wall\r\nbeing that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with disfavour\r\nin the army, assignations and communications had probably been made\r\nacross the river before to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Sergeant Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the blurred spot in the snow, tremulously.\r\n\r\nThis person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the other\r\nspeaker so much a part of the building, that one would have said the\r\nwall was holding a conversation with the snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d came suspiciously from the shadow. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat girl are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you know me?\xe2\x80\x9d said the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cYour wife, Fanny Robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny!\xe2\x80\x9d said the wall, in utter astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of emotion.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s tone which is not that of the wife,\r\nand there was a manner in the man which is rarely a husband\xe2\x80\x99s. The\r\ndialogue went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked which was your window. Forgive me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect you to-night. Indeed, I did not think you would come\r\nat all. It was a wonder you found me here. I am orderly to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said I was to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94I said that you might.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I mean that I might. You are glad to see me, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you\xe2\x80\x94come to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fan, no! The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are closed,\r\nand I have no leave. We are all of us as good as in the county gaol\r\ntill to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shan\xe2\x80\x99t see you till then!\xe2\x80\x9d The words were in a faltering tone\r\nof disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get here from Weatherbury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI walked\xe2\x80\x94some part of the way\xe2\x80\x94the rest by the carriers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94so am I. And Frank, when will it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite recollect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO you do! Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak like that. It weighs me to the earth. It makes\r\nme say what ought to be said first by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, must I?\xe2\x80\x94it is, when shall we be married, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. Well\xe2\x80\x94you have to get proper clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have money. Will it be by banns or license?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBanns, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we live in two parishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo we? What then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lodgings are in St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, and this is not. So they will have to\r\nbe published in both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. O Frank\xe2\x80\x94you think me forward, I am afraid! Don\xe2\x80\x99t, dear Frank\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94for I love you so. And you said lots of times you would marry me,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, now! It is foolish. If I said so, of course I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall I put up the banns in my parish, and will you in yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-morrow. We\xe2\x80\x99ll settle in a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the permission of the officers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x94how is it? You said you almost had before you left Casterbridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I forgot to ask. Your coming like this is so sudden and\r\nunexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94it is. It was wrong of me to worry you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go away now. Will\r\nyou come and see me to-morrow, at Mrs. Twills\xe2\x80\x99s, in North Street? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to come to the Barracks. There are bad women about, and they\r\nthink me one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite, so. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you, my dear. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Frank\xe2\x80\x94good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the noise was again heard of a window closing. The little spot\r\nmoved away. When she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was heard\r\ninside the wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo\xe2\x80\x94ho\xe2\x80\x94Sergeant\xe2\x80\x94ho\xe2\x80\x94ho!\xe2\x80\x9d An expostulation followed, but it was\r\nindistinct; and it became lost amid a low peal of laughter, which was\r\nhardly distinguishable from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nFARMERS\xe2\x80\x94A RULE\xe2\x80\x94AN EXCEPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first public evidence of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s decision to be a farmer in her\r\nown person and by proxy no more was her appearance the following\r\nmarket-day in the cornmarket at Casterbridge.\r\n\r\nThe low though extensive hall, supported by beams and pillars, and\r\nlatterly dignified by the name of Corn Exchange, was thronged with hot\r\nmen who talked among each other in twos and threes, the speaker of the\r\nminute looking sideways into his auditor\xe2\x80\x99s face and concentrating his\r\nargument by a contraction of one eyelid during delivery. The greater\r\nnumber carried in their hands ground-ash saplings, using them partly as\r\nwalking-sticks and partly for poking up pigs, sheep, neighbours with\r\ntheir backs turned, and restful things in general, which seemed to\r\nrequire such treatment in the course of their peregrinations. During\r\nconversations each subjected his sapling to great varieties of\r\nusage\xe2\x80\x94bending it round his back, forming an arch of it between his two\r\nhands, overweighting it on the ground till it reached nearly a\r\nsemicircle; or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the arm whilst the\r\nsample-bag was pulled forth and a handful of corn poured into the palm,\r\nwhich, after criticism, was flung upon the floor, an issue of events\r\nperfectly well known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which had as\r\nusual crept into the building unobserved, and waited the fulfilment of\r\ntheir anticipations with a high-stretched neck and oblique eye.\r\n\r\nAmong these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided, the single one of\r\nher sex that the room contained. She was prettily and even daintily\r\ndressed. She moved between them as a chaise between carts, was heard\r\nafter them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them like a\r\nbreeze among furnaces. It had required a little determination\xe2\x80\x94far more\r\nthan she had at first imagined\xe2\x80\x94to take up a position here, for at her\r\nfirst entry the lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every face had\r\nbeen turned towards her, and those that were already turned rigidly\r\nfixed there.\r\n\r\nTwo or three only of the farmers were personally known to Bathsheba,\r\nand to these she had made her way. But if she was to be the practical\r\nwoman she had intended to show herself, business must be carried on,\r\nintroductions or none, and she ultimately acquired confidence enough to\r\nspeak and reply boldly to men merely known to her by hearsay. Bathsheba\r\ntoo had her sample-bags, and by degrees adopted the professional pour\r\ninto the hand\xe2\x80\x94holding up the grains in her narrow palm for inspection,\r\nin perfect Casterbridge manner.\r\n\r\nSomething in the exact arch of her upper unbroken row of teeth, and in\r\nthe keenly pointed corners of her red mouth when, with parted lips, she\r\nsomewhat defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a tall man,\r\nsuggested that there was potentiality enough in that lithe slip of\r\nhumanity for alarming exploits of sex, and daring enough to carry them\r\nout. But her eyes had a softness\xe2\x80\x94invariably a softness\xe2\x80\x94which, had they\r\nnot been dark, would have seemed mistiness; as they were, it lowered an\r\nexpression that might have been piercing to simple clearness.\r\n\r\nStrange to say of a woman in full bloom and vigor, she always allowed\r\nher interlocutors to finish their statements before rejoining with\r\nhers. In arguing on prices, she held to her own firmly, as was natural\r\nin a dealer, and reduced theirs persistently, as was inevitable in a\r\nwoman. But there was an elasticity in her firmness which removed it\r\nfrom obstinacy, as there was a _na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9_ in her cheapening which saved\r\nit from meanness.\r\n\r\nThose of the farmers with whom she had no dealings (by far the greater\r\npart) were continually asking each other, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d The reply would\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s niece; took on Weatherbury Upper Farm; turned away\r\nthe baily, and swears she\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other man would then shake his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99tis a pity she\xe2\x80\x99s so headstrong,\xe2\x80\x9d the first would say. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\r\nought to be proud of her here\xe2\x80\x94she lightens up the old place. \xe2\x80\x99Tis such\r\na shapely maid, however, that she\xe2\x80\x99ll soon get picked up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be ungallant to suggest that the novelty of her engagement in\r\nsuch an occupation had almost as much to do with the magnetism as had\r\nthe beauty of her face and movements. However, the interest was\r\ngeneral, and this Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s _d\xc3\xa9but_ in the forum, whatever it may have\r\nbeen to Bathsheba as the buying and selling farmer, was unquestionably\r\na triumph to her as the maiden. Indeed, the sensation was so pronounced\r\nthat her instinct on two or three occasions was merely to walk as a\r\nqueen among these gods of the fallow, like a little sister of a little\r\nJove, and to neglect closing prices altogether.\r\n\r\nThe numerous evidences of her power to attract were only thrown into\r\ngreater relief by a marked exception. Women seem to have eyes in their\r\nribbons for such matters as these. Bathsheba, without looking within a\r\nright angle of him, was conscious of a black sheep among the flock.\r\n\r\nIt perplexed her first. If there had been a respectable minority on\r\neither side, the case would have been most natural. If nobody had\r\nregarded her, she would have taken the matter indifferently\xe2\x80\x94such cases\r\nhad occurred. If everybody, this man included, she would have taken it\r\nas a matter of course\xe2\x80\x94people had done so before. But the smallness of\r\nthe exception made the mystery.\r\n\r\nShe soon knew thus much of the recusant\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. He was a\r\ngentlemanly man, with full and distinctly outlined Roman features, the\r\nprominences of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like richness of\r\ntone. He was erect in attitude, and quiet in demeanour. One\r\ncharacteristic pre-eminently marked him\xe2\x80\x94dignity.\r\n\r\nApparently he had some time ago reached that entrance to middle age at\r\nwhich a man\xe2\x80\x99s aspect naturally ceases to alter for the term of a dozen\r\nyears or so; and, artificially, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s does likewise. Thirty-five\r\nand fifty were his limits of variation\xe2\x80\x94he might have been either, or\r\nanywhere between the two.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that married men of forty are usually ready and generous\r\nenough to fling passing glances at any specimen of moderate beauty they\r\nmay discern by the way. Probably, as with persons playing whist for\r\nlove, the consciousness of a certain immunity under any circumstances\r\nfrom that worst possible ultimate, the having to pay, makes them unduly\r\nspeculative. Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person was not a\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\nWhen marketing was over, she rushed off to Liddy, who was waiting for\r\nher beside the yellow gig in which they had driven to town. The horse\r\nwas put in, and on they trotted\xe2\x80\x94Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s sugar, tea, and drapery\r\nparcels being packed behind, and expressing in some indescribable\r\nmanner, by their colour, shape, and general lineaments, that they were\r\nthat young lady-farmer\xe2\x80\x99s property, and the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s and draper\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been through it, Liddy, and it is over. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t mind it again,\r\nfor they will all have grown accustomed to seeing me there; but this\r\nmorning it was as bad as being married\xe2\x80\x94eyes everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knowed it would be,\xe2\x80\x9d Liddy said. \xe2\x80\x9cMen be such a terrible class of\r\nsociety to look at a body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was one man who had more sense than to waste his time upon\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d The information was put in this form that Liddy might not for a\r\nmoment suppose her mistress was at all piqued. \xe2\x80\x9cA very good-looking\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cupright; about forty, I should think. Do you know\r\nat all who he could be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you guess at all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba with some disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t a notion; besides, \xe2\x80\x99tis no difference, since he took less\r\nnotice of you than any of the rest. Now, if he\xe2\x80\x99d taken more, it would\r\nhave mattered a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba was suffering from the reverse feeling just then, and they\r\nbowled along in silence. A low carriage, bowling along still more\r\nrapidly behind a horse of unimpeachable breed, overtook and passed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there he is!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nLiddy looked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat! That\xe2\x80\x99s Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94of course \xe2\x80\x99tis\xe2\x80\x94the man you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the other day when he called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Farmer Boldwood,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bathsheba, and looked at him as he\r\noutstripped them. The farmer had never turned his head once, but with\r\neyes fixed on the most advanced point along the road, passed as\r\nunconsciously and abstractedly as if Bathsheba and her charms were thin\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting man\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d she remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, very. Everybody owns it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Liddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why he is so wrapt up and indifferent, and seemingly so far\r\naway from all he sees around him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is said\xe2\x80\x94but not known for certain\xe2\x80\x94that he met with some bitter\r\ndisappointment when he was a young man and merry. A woman jilted him,\r\nthey say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always say that\xe2\x80\x94and we know very well women scarcely ever jilt\r\nmen; \xe2\x80\x99tis the men who jilt us. I expect it is simply his nature to be\r\nso reserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSimply his nature\xe2\x80\x94I expect so, miss\xe2\x80\x94nothing else in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, \xe2\x80\x99tis more romantic to think he has been served cruelly, poor\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99! Perhaps, after all, he has!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDepend upon it he has. Oh yes, miss, he has! I feel he must have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we are very apt to think extremes of people. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder after all if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a little of both\xe2\x80\x94just between the\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x94rather cruelly used and rather reserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear no, miss\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t think it between the two!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s most likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, so it is. I am convinced it is most likely. You may take my\r\nword, miss, that that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nSORTES SANCTORUM\xe2\x80\x94THE VALENTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday afternoon in the farmhouse, on the thirteenth of\r\nFebruary. Dinner being over, Bathsheba, for want of a better companion,\r\nhad asked Liddy to come and sit with her. The mouldy pile was dreary in\r\nwinter-time before the candles were lighted and the shutters closed;\r\nthe atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the walls; every nook\r\nbehind the furniture had a temperature of its own, for the fire was not\r\nkindled in this part of the house early in the day; and Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\npiano, which was an old one in other annals, looked particularly\r\nsloping and out of level on the warped floor before night threw a shade\r\nover its less prominent angles and hid the unpleasantness. Liddy, like\r\na little brook, though shallow, was always rippling; her presence had\r\nnot so much weight as to task thought, and yet enough to exercise it.\r\n\r\nOn the table lay an old quarto Bible, bound in leather. Liddy looking\r\nat it said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever find out, miss, who you are going to marry by means of\r\nthe Bible and key?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so foolish, Liddy. As if such things could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal in it, all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it makes your heart beat fearful. Some believe in it; some don\xe2\x80\x99t;\r\nI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, let\xe2\x80\x99s try it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, bounding from her seat with\r\nthat total disregard of consistency which can be indulged in towards a\r\ndependent, and entering into the spirit of divination at once. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and\r\nget the front door key.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy fetched it. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, on returning.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps \xe2\x80\x99tis wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s right week days is right Sundays,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her mistress in a\r\ntone which was a proof in itself.\r\n\r\nThe book was opened\xe2\x80\x94the leaves, drab with age, being quite worn away at\r\nmuch-read verses by the forefingers of unpractised readers in former\r\ndays, where they were moved along under the line as an aid to the\r\nvision. The special verse in the Book of Ruth was sought out by\r\nBathsheba, and the sublime words met her eye. They slightly thrilled\r\nand abashed her. It was Wisdom in the abstract facing Folly in the\r\nconcrete. Folly in the concrete blushed, persisted in her intention,\r\nand placed the key on the book. A rusty patch immediately upon the\r\nverse, caused by previous pressure of an iron substance thereon, told\r\nthat this was not the first time the old volume had been used for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow keep steady, and be silent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThe verse was repeated; the book turned round; Bathsheba blushed\r\nguiltily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did you try?\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s doings in church this morning, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLiddy continued, adumbrating by the remark the track her thoughts had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, with serene indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis pew is exactly opposite yours, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did not see his goings on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I did not, I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy assumed a smaller physiognomy, and shut her lips decisively.\r\n\r\nThis move was unexpected, and proportionately disconcerting. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did\r\nhe do?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba said perforce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t turn his head to look at you once all the service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he?\xe2\x80\x9d again demanded her mistress, wearing a nettled look.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. But everybody else was noticing you; and it was odd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThere, \xe2\x80\x99tis like him. Rich and gentlemanly, what does he care?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba dropped into a silence intended to express that she had\r\nopinions on the matter too abstruse for Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s comprehension, rather\r\nthan that she had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94I had nearly forgotten the valentine I bought yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cValentine! who for, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy. \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the single name among all possible wrong ones that just at this\r\nmoment seemed to Bathsheba more pertinent than the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no. It is only for little Teddy Coggan. I have promised him\r\nsomething, and this will be a pretty surprise for him. Liddy, you may\r\nas well bring me my desk and I\xe2\x80\x99ll direct it at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba took from her desk a gorgeously illuminated and embossed\r\ndesign in post-octavo, which had been bought on the previous market-day\r\nat the chief stationer\xe2\x80\x99s in Casterbridge. In the centre was a small\r\noval enclosure; this was left blank, that the sender might insert\r\ntender words more appropriate to the special occasion than any\r\ngeneralities by a printer could possibly be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a place for writing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I put?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of this sort, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Liddy promptly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rose is red,\r\nThe violet blue,\r\nCarnation\xe2\x80\x99s sweet,\r\nAnd so are you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that shall be it. It just suits itself to a chubby-faced child\r\nlike him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. She inserted the words in a small though\r\nlegible handwriting; enclosed the sheet in an envelope, and dipped her\r\npen for the direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fun it would be to send it to the stupid old Boldwood, and how he\r\nwould wonder!\xe2\x80\x9d said the irrepressible Liddy, lifting her eyebrows, and\r\nindulging in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she thought of the\r\nmoral and social magnitude of the man contemplated.\r\n\r\nBathsheba paused to regard the idea at full length. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s had\r\nbegun to be a troublesome image\xe2\x80\x94a species of Daniel in her kingdom who\r\npersisted in kneeling eastward when reason and common sense said that\r\nhe might just as well follow suit with the rest, and afford her the\r\nofficial glance of admiration which cost nothing at all. She was far\r\nfrom being seriously concerned about his nonconformity. Still, it was\r\nfaintly depressing that the most dignified and valuable man in the\r\nparish should withhold his eyes, and that a girl like Liddy should talk\r\nabout it. So Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s idea was at first rather harassing than piquant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do that. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see any humour in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d worry to death,\xe2\x80\x9d said the persistent Liddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care particularly to send it to Teddy,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked her\r\nmistress. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s rather a naughty child sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94that he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s toss as men do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, idly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then, head,\r\nBoldwood; tail, Teddy. No, we won\xe2\x80\x99t toss money on a Sunday, that would\r\nbe tempting the devil indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToss this hymn-book; there can\xe2\x80\x99t be no sinfulness in that, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Open, Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94shut, Teddy. No; it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to fall\r\nopen. Open, Teddy\xe2\x80\x94shut, Boldwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe book went fluttering in the air and came down shut.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, a small yawn upon her mouth, took the pen, and with off-hand\r\nserenity directed the missive to Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow light a candle, Liddy. Which seal shall we use? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a unicorn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in that. What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x94two doves\xe2\x80\x94no. It ought to be\r\nsomething extraordinary, ought it not, Liddy? Here\xe2\x80\x99s one with a motto\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nremember it is some funny one, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t read it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try this, and\r\nif it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do we\xe2\x80\x99ll have another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA large red seal was duly affixed. Bathsheba looked closely at the hot\r\nwax to discover the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, throwing down the letter frolicsomely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould upset the solemnity of a parson and clerke too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy looked at the words of the seal, and read\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARRY ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening the letter was sent, and was duly sorted in\r\nCasterbridge post-office that night, to be returned to Weatherbury\r\nagain in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo very idly and unreflectingly was this deed done. Of love as a\r\nspectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge; but of love subjectively she\r\nknew nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nEFFECT OF THE LETTER\xe2\x80\x94SUNRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, Boldwood sat down to\r\nsupper as usual, by a beaming fire of aged logs. Upon the mantel-shelf\r\nbefore him was a time-piece, surmounted by a spread eagle, and upon the\r\neagle\xe2\x80\x99s wings was the letter Bathsheba had sent. Here the bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngaze was continually fastening itself, till the large red seal became\r\nas a blot of blood on the retina of his eye; and as he ate and drank he\r\nstill read in fancy the words thereon, although they were too remote\r\nfor his sight\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMARRY ME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pert injunction was like those crystal substances which, colourless\r\nthemselves, assume the tone of objects about them. Here, in the quiet\r\nof Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s parlour, where everything that was not grave was\r\nextraneous, and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday\r\nlasting all the week, the letter and its dictum changed their tenor\r\nfrom the thoughtlessness of their origin to a deep solemnity, imbibed\r\nfrom their accessories now.\r\n\r\nSince the receipt of the missive in the morning, Boldwood had felt the\r\nsymmetry of his existence to be slowly getting distorted in the\r\ndirection of an ideal passion. The disturbance was as the first\r\nfloating weed to Columbus\xe2\x80\x94the contemptibly little suggesting\r\npossibilities of the infinitely great.\r\n\r\nThe letter must have had an origin and a motive. That the latter was of\r\nthe smallest magnitude compatible with its existence at all, Boldwood,\r\nof course, did not know. And such an explanation did not strike him as\r\na possibility even. It is foreign to a mystified condition of mind to\r\nrealize of the mystifier that the processes of approving a course\r\nsuggested by circumstance, and of striking out a course from inner\r\nimpulse, would look the same in the result. The vast difference between\r\nstarting a train of events, and directing into a particular groove a\r\nseries already started, is rarely apparent to the person confounded by\r\nthe issue.\r\n\r\nWhen Boldwood went to bed he placed the valentine in the corner of the\r\nlooking-glass. He was conscious of its presence, even when his back was\r\nturned upon it. It was the first time in Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s life that such an\r\nevent had occurred. The same fascination that caused him to think it an\r\nact which had a deliberate motive prevented him from regarding it as an\r\nimpertinence. He looked again at the direction. The mysterious\r\ninfluences of night invested the writing with the presence of the\r\nunknown writer. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94some _woman\xe2\x80\x99s_\xe2\x80\x94hand had travelled softly\r\nover the paper bearing his name; her unrevealed eyes had watched every\r\ncurve as she formed it; her brain had seen him in imagination the\r\nwhile. Why should she have imagined him? Her mouth\xe2\x80\x94were the lips red or\r\npale, plump or creased?\xe2\x80\x94had curved itself to a certain expression as\r\nthe pen went on\xe2\x80\x94the corners had moved with all their natural\r\ntremulousness: what had been the expression?\r\n\r\nThe vision of the woman writing, as a supplement to the words written,\r\nhad no individuality. She was a misty shape, and well she might be,\r\nconsidering that her original was at that moment sound asleep and\r\noblivious of all love and letter-writing under the sky. Whenever\r\nBoldwood dozed she took a form, and comparatively ceased to be a\r\nvision: when he awoke there was the letter justifying the dream.\r\n\r\nThe moon shone to-night, and its light was not of a customary kind. His\r\nwindow admitted only a reflection of its rays, and the pale sheen had\r\nthat reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward and lighting up\r\nhis ceiling in an unnatural way, casting shadows in strange places, and\r\nputting lights where shadows had used to be.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the epistle had occupied him but little in comparison\r\nwith the fact of its arrival. He suddenly wondered if anything more\r\nmight be found in the envelope than what he had withdrawn. He jumped\r\nout of bed in the weird light, took the letter, pulled out the flimsy\r\nsheet, shook the envelope\xe2\x80\x94searched it. Nothing more was there. Boldwood\r\nlooked, as he had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent\r\nred seal: \xe2\x80\x9cMarry me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said aloud.\r\n\r\nThe solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the letter, and stuck it in\r\nthe frame of the glass. In doing so he caught sight of his reflected\r\nfeatures, wan in expression, and insubstantial in form. He saw how\r\nclosely compressed was his mouth, and that his eyes were wide-spread\r\nand vacant. Feeling uneasy and dissatisfied with himself for this\r\nnervous excitability, he returned to bed.\r\n\r\nThen the dawn drew on. The full power of the clear heaven was not equal\r\nto that of a cloudy sky at noon, when Boldwood arose and dressed\r\nhimself. He descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of a\r\nfield to the east, leaning over which he paused and looked around.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of the year, and the\r\nsky, pure violet in the zenith, was leaden to the northward, and murky\r\nto the east, where, over the snowy down or ewe-lease on Weatherbury\r\nUpper Farm, and apparently resting upon the ridge, the only half of the\r\nsun yet visible burnt rayless, like a red and flameless fire shining\r\nover a white hearthstone. The whole effect resembled a sunset as\r\nchildhood resembles age.\r\n\r\nIn other directions, the fields and sky were so much of one colour by\r\nthe snow, that it was difficult in a hasty glance to tell whereabouts\r\nthe horizon occurred; and in general there was here, too, that\r\nbefore-mentioned preternatural inversion of light and shade which\r\nattends the prospect when the garish brightness commonly in the sky is\r\nfound on the earth, and the shades of earth are in the sky. Over the\r\nwest hung the wasting moon, now dull and greenish-yellow, like\r\ntarnished brass.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was listlessly noting how the frost had hardened and glazed\r\nthe surface of the snow, till it shone in the red eastern light with\r\nthe polish of marble; how, in some portions of the slope, withered\r\ngrass-bents, encased in icicles, bristled through the smooth wan\r\ncoverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old Venetian glass; and\r\nhow the footprints of a few birds, which had hopped over the snow\r\nwhilst it lay in the state of a soft fleece, were now frozen to a short\r\npermanency. A half-muffled noise of light wheels interrupted him.\r\nBoldwood turned back into the road. It was the mail-cart\xe2\x80\x94a crazy,\r\ntwo-wheeled vehicle, hardly heavy enough to resist a puff of wind. The\r\ndriver held out a letter. Boldwood seized it and opened it, expecting\r\nanother anonymous one\xe2\x80\x94so greatly are people\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of probability a\r\nmere sense that precedent will repeat itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is for you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, when he saw\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s action. \xe2\x80\x9cThough there is no name, I think it is for your\r\nshepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked then at the address\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTo the New Shepherd,\r\nWeatherbury Farm,\r\nNear Casterbridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94what a mistake!\xe2\x80\x94it is not mine. Nor is it for my shepherd. It is\r\nfor Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s. You had better take it on to him\xe2\x80\x94Gabriel Oak\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nsay I opened it in mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing sky, a figure was\r\nvisible, like the black snuff in the midst of a candle-flame. Then it\r\nmoved and began to bustle about vigorously from place to place,\r\ncarrying square skeleton masses, which were riddled by the same rays. A\r\nsmall figure on all fours followed behind. The tall form was that of\r\nGabriel Oak; the small one that of George; the articles in course of\r\ntransit were hurdles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man on the hill. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the\r\nletter to him myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Boldwood it was now no longer merely a letter to another man. It was\r\nan opportunity. Exhibiting a face pregnant with intention, he entered\r\nthe snowy field.\r\n\r\nGabriel, at that minute, descended the hill towards the right. The glow\r\nstretched down in this direction now, and touched the distant roof of\r\nWarren\xe2\x80\x99s Malthouse\xe2\x80\x94whither the shepherd was apparently bent: Boldwood\r\nfollowed at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nA MORNING MEETING\xe2\x80\x94THE LETTER AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did not penetrate to\r\nits interior, which was, as usual, lighted by a rival glow of similar\r\nhue, radiating from the hearth.\r\n\r\nThe maltster, after having lain down in his clothes for a few hours,\r\nwas now sitting beside a three-legged table, breakfasting off bread and\r\nbacon. This was eaten on the plateless system, which is performed by\r\nplacing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat upon the bread,\r\na mustard plaster upon the meat, and a pinch of salt upon the whole,\r\nthen cutting them vertically downwards with a large pocket-knife till\r\nwood is reached, when the severed lump is impaled on the knife,\r\nelevated, and sent the proper way of food.\r\n\r\nThe maltster\xe2\x80\x99s lack of teeth appeared not to sensibly diminish his\r\npowers as a mill. He had been without them for so many years that\r\ntoothlessness was felt less to be a defect than hard gums an\r\nacquisition. Indeed, he seemed to approach the grave as a hyperbolic\r\ncurve approaches a straight line\xe2\x80\x94less directly as he got nearer, till\r\nit was doubtful if he would ever reach it at all.\r\n\r\nIn the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting, and a boiling pipkin of\r\ncharred bread, called \xe2\x80\x9ccoffee\xe2\x80\x9d, for the benefit of whomsoever should\r\ncall, for Warren\xe2\x80\x99s was a sort of clubhouse, used as an alternative to\r\nthe inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, says I, we get a fine day, and then down comes a snapper at\r\nnight,\xe2\x80\x9d was a remark now suddenly heard spreading into the malthouse\r\nfrom the door, which had been opened the previous moment. The form of\r\nHenery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow from his boots when\r\nabout half-way there. The speech and entry had not seemed to be at all\r\nan abrupt beginning to the maltster, introductory matter being often\r\nomitted in this neighbourhood, both from word and deed, and the\r\nmaltster having the same latitude allowed him, did not hurry to reply.\r\nHe picked up a fragment of cheese, by pecking upon it with his knife,\r\nas a butcher picks up skewers.\r\n\r\nHenery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat, buttoned over his\r\nsmock-frock, the white skirts of the latter being visible to the\r\ndistance of about a foot below the coat-tails, which, when you got used\r\nto the style of dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental\xe2\x80\x94it\r\ncertainly was comfortable.\r\n\r\nMatthew Moon, Joseph Poorgrass, and other carters and waggoners\r\nfollowed at his heels, with great lanterns dangling from their hands,\r\nwhich showed that they had just come from the cart-horse stables, where\r\nthey had been busily engaged since four o\xe2\x80\x99clock that morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is she getting on without a baily?\xe2\x80\x9d the maltster inquired.\r\nHenery shook his head, and smiled one of the bitter smiles, dragging\r\nall the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll rue it\xe2\x80\x94surely, surely!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBenjy Pennyways were not a\r\ntrue man or an honest baily\xe2\x80\x94as big a betrayer as Judas Iscariot\r\nhimself. But to think she can carr\xe2\x80\x99 on alone!\xe2\x80\x9d He allowed his head to\r\nswing laterally three or four times in silence. \xe2\x80\x9cNever in all my\r\ncreeping up\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was recognized by all as the conclusion of some gloomy speech\r\nwhich had been expressed in thought alone during the shake of the head;\r\nHenery meanwhile retained several marks of despair upon his face, to\r\nimply that they would be required for use again directly he should go\r\non speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll will be ruined, and ourselves too, or there\xe2\x80\x99s no meat in\r\ngentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s houses!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA headstrong maid, that\xe2\x80\x99s what she is\xe2\x80\x94and won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to no advice at\r\nall. Pride and vanity have ruined many a cobbler\xe2\x80\x99s dog. Dear, dear,\r\nwhen I think o\xe2\x80\x99 it, I sorrows like a man in travel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, Henery, you do, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass in a voice\r\nof thorough attestation, and with a wire-drawn smile of misery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould do a martel man no harm to have what\xe2\x80\x99s under her bonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBilly Smallbury, who had just entered, bearing his one tooth before\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cShe can spaik real language, and must have some sense somewhere.\r\nDo ye foller me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, I do; but no baily\xe2\x80\x94I deserved that place,\xe2\x80\x9d wailed Henery,\r\nsignifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at visions of a high destiny\r\napparently visible to him on Billy Smallbury\xe2\x80\x99s smock-frock. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twas to be, I suppose. Your lot is your lot, and Scripture is nothing;\r\nfor if you do good you don\xe2\x80\x99t get rewarded according to your works, but\r\nbe cheated in some mean way out of your recompense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with\xe2\x80\x99ee there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nperfect gentleman in that respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood works good pay, so to speak it,\xe2\x80\x9d attested Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\nA short pause ensued, and as a sort of _entr\xe2\x80\x99acte_ Henery turned and\r\nblew out the lanterns, which the increase of daylight rendered no\r\nlonger necessary even in the malthouse, with its one pane of glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a harpsichord, dulcimer,\r\npianner, or whatever \xe2\x80\x99tis they d\xe2\x80\x99call it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster. \xe2\x80\x9cLiddy\r\nsaith she\xe2\x80\x99ve a new one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot a pianner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. Seems her old uncle\xe2\x80\x99s things were not good enough for her. She\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbought all but everything new. There\xe2\x80\x99s heavy chairs for the stout, weak\r\nand wiry ones for the slender; great watches, getting on to the size of\r\nclocks, to stand upon the chimbley-piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPictures, for the most part wonderful frames.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd long horse-hair settles for the drunk, with horse-hair pillows at\r\neach end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cLikewise looking-glasses for the pretty,\r\nand lying books for the wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside; the door was opened\r\nabout six inches, and somebody on the other side exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeighbours, have ye got room for a few new-born lambs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure, shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the conclave.\r\n\r\nThe door was flung back till it kicked the wall and trembled from top\r\nto bottom with the blow. Mr. Oak appeared in the entry with a steaming\r\nface, hay-bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow, a leather\r\nstrap round his waist outside the smock-frock, and looking altogether\r\nan epitome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s health and vigour. Four lambs hung in various\r\nembarrassing attitudes over his shoulders, and the dog George, whom\r\nGabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe, stalked solemnly behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Shepherd Oak, and how\xe2\x80\x99s lambing this year, if I mid say it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninquired Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible trying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been wet through twice a-day, either\r\nin snow or rain, this last fortnight. Cainy and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t tined our\r\neyes to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good few twins, too, I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo many by half. Yes; \xe2\x80\x99tis a very queer lambing this year. We shan\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave done by Lady Day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd last year \xe2\x80\x99twer all over by Sexajessamine Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring on the rest Cain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cand then run back to the ewes.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCainy Ball\xe2\x80\x94a cheery-faced young lad, with a small circular orifice by\r\nway of mouth, advanced and deposited two others, and retired as he was\r\nbidden. Oak lowered the lambs from their unnatural elevation, wrapped\r\nthem in hay, and placed them round the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve no lambing-hut here, as I used to have at Norcombe,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cand \xe2\x80\x99tis such a plague to bring the weakly ones to a house.\r\nIf \xe2\x80\x99twasn\xe2\x80\x99t for your place here, malter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should do\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 this keen weather. And how is it with you to-day, malter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, neither sick nor sorry, shepherd; but no younger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, Shepherd Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the ancient man of malt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\r\nwas the old place at Norcombe, when ye went for your dog? I should like\r\nto see the old familiar spot; but faith, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know a soul there\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x99Tis altered very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that Dicky Hill\xe2\x80\x99s wooden cider-house is pulled down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94years ago, and Dicky\xe2\x80\x99s cottage just above it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and Tompkins\xe2\x80\x99s old apple-tree is rooted that used to bear two\r\nhogsheads of cider; and no help from other trees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRooted?\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t say it! Ah! stirring times we live in\xe2\x80\x94stirring\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can mind the old well that used to be in the middle of the\r\nplace? That\xe2\x80\x99s turned into a solid iron pump with a large stone trough,\r\nand all complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear\xe2\x80\x94how the face of nations alter, and what we live to see\r\nnowadays! Yes\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x99tis the same here. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking but now of\r\nthe mis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x99s strange doings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been saying about her?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Oak, sharply turning to\r\nthe rest, and getting very warm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese middle-aged men have been pulling her over the coals for pride\r\nand vanity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I say, let her have rope enough.\r\nBless her pretty face\xe2\x80\x94shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I like to do so\xe2\x80\x94upon her cherry lips!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe gallant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and well known sound with\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cnow you mind this! none of that\r\ndalliance-talk\xe2\x80\x94that smack-and-coddle style of yours\xe2\x80\x94about Miss\r\nEverdene. I don\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no chance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Clark,\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve been speaking against her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, turning to\r\nJoseph Poorgrass with a very grim look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94not a word I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis a real joyful thing that she\xe2\x80\x99s no worse,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, trembling and blushing with terror.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew just said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew Moon, what have you been saying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Why ye know I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t harm a worm\xe2\x80\x94no, not one underground worm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Matthew Moon, looking very uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, somebody has\xe2\x80\x94and look here, neighbours,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel, though one of\r\nthe quietest and most gentle men on earth, rose to the occasion, with\r\nmartial promptness and vigour. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my fist.\xe2\x80\x9d Here he placed his\r\nfist, rather smaller in size than a common loaf, in the mathematical\r\ncentre of the maltster\xe2\x80\x99s little table, and with it gave a bump or two\r\nthereon, as if to ensure that their eyes all thoroughly took in the\r\nidea of fistiness before he went further. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94the first man in the\r\nparish that I hear prophesying bad of our mistress, why\xe2\x80\x9d (here the fist\r\nwas raised and let fall as Thor might have done with his hammer in\r\nassaying it)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll smell and taste that\xe2\x80\x94or I\xe2\x80\x99m a Dutchman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll earnestly expressed by their features that their minds did not\r\nwander to Holland for a moment on account of this statement, but were\r\ndeploring the difference which gave rise to the figure; and Mark Clark\r\ncried \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear; just what I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 said.\xe2\x80\x9d The dog George looked\r\nup at the same time after the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s menace, and though he\r\nunderstood English but imperfectly, began to growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery, with a\r\ndeprecating peacefulness equal to anything of the kind in Christianity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hear that ye be a extraordinary good and clever man, shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Joseph Poorgrass with considerable anxiety from behind the\r\nmaltster\xe2\x80\x99s bedstead, whither he had retired for safety. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a great\r\nthing to be clever, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, making movements associated\r\nwith states of mind rather than body; \xe2\x80\x9cwe wish we were, don\xe2\x80\x99t we,\r\nneighbours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, that we do, sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Moon, with a small anxious laugh\r\ntowards Oak, to show how very friendly disposed he was likewise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s been telling you I\xe2\x80\x99m clever?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis blowed about from pillar to post quite common,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhear that ye can tell the time as well by the stars as we can by the\r\nsun and moon, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can do a little that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, as a man of medium\r\nsentiments on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that ye can make sun-dials, and prent folks\xe2\x80\x99 names upon their\r\nwaggons almost like copper-plate, with beautiful flourishes, and great\r\nlong tails. A excellent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man,\r\nshepherd. Joseph Poorgrass used to prent to Farmer James Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwaggons before you came, and \xe2\x80\x99a could never mind which way to turn the\r\nJ\xe2\x80\x99s and E\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94could ye, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph shook his head to express how\r\nabsolute was the fact that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you used to do \xe2\x80\x99em the\r\nwrong way, like this, didn\xe2\x80\x99t ye, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d Matthew marked on the dusty\r\nfloor with his whip-handle\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The word J A M E S appears here with the \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x9d, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d printed backwards]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how Farmer James would cuss, and call thee a fool, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he,\r\nJoseph, when \xe2\x80\x99a seed his name looking so inside-out-like?\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nMatthew Moon with feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99a would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you see, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much to\r\nblame, for them J\xe2\x80\x99s and E\xe2\x80\x99s be such trying sons o\xe2\x80\x99 witches for the\r\nmemory to mind whether they face backward or forward; and I always had\r\nsuch a forgetful memory, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a very bad affliction for ye, being such a man of calamities in\r\nother ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis; but a happy Providence ordered that it should be no worse,\r\nand I feel my thanks. As to shepherd, there, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure mis\xe2\x80\x99ess ought to\r\nhave made ye her baily\xe2\x80\x94such a fitting man for\xe2\x80\x99t as you be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind owning that I expected it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, frankly. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I\r\nhoped for the place. At the same time, Miss Everdene has a right to be\r\nher own baily if she choose\xe2\x80\x94and to keep me down to be a common shepherd\r\nonly.\xe2\x80\x9d Oak drew a slow breath, looked sadly into the bright ashpit, and\r\nseemed lost in thoughts not of the most hopeful hue.\r\n\r\nThe genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate the nearly\r\nlifeless lambs to bleat and move their limbs briskly upon the hay, and\r\nto recognize for the first time the fact that they were born. Their\r\nnoise increased to a chorus of baas, upon which Oak pulled the milk-can\r\nfrom before the fire, and taking a small tea-pot from the pocket of his\r\nsmock-frock, filled it with milk, and taught those of the helpless\r\ncreatures which were not to be restored to their dams how to drink from\r\nthe spout\xe2\x80\x94a trick they acquired with astonishing aptitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she don\xe2\x80\x99t even let ye have the skins of the dead lambs, I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nresumed Joseph Poorgrass, his eyes lingering on the operations of Oak\r\nwith the necessary melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe be very badly used, shepherd,\xe2\x80\x9d hazarded Joseph again, in the hope\r\nof getting Oak as an ally in lamentation after all. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99s took\r\nagainst ye\xe2\x80\x94that I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gabriel, hastily, and a sigh escaped him,\r\nwhich the deprivation of lamb skins could hardly have caused.\r\n\r\nBefore any further remark had been added a shade darkened the door, and\r\nBoldwood entered the malthouse, bestowing upon each a nod of a quality\r\nbetween friendliness and condescension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Oak, I thought you were here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI met the mail-cart ten\r\nminutes ago, and a letter was put into my hand, which I opened without\r\nreading the address. I believe it is yours. You must excuse the\r\naccident please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes\xe2\x80\x94not a bit of difference, Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94not a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel,\r\nreadily. He had not a correspondent on earth, nor was there a possible\r\nletter coming to him whose contents the whole parish would not have\r\nbeen welcome to peruse.\r\n\r\nOak stepped aside, and read the following in an unknown hand:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,\xe2\x80\x94I do not know your name, but I think these few lines will\r\nreach you, which I wrote to thank you for your kindness to me the night\r\nI left Weatherbury in a reckless way. I also return the money I owe\r\nyou, which you will excuse my not keeping as a gift. All has ended\r\nwell, and I am happy to say I am going to be married to the young man\r\nwho has courted me for some time\xe2\x80\x94Sergeant Troy, of the 11th Dragoon\r\nGuards, now quartered in this town. He would, I know, object to my\r\nhaving received anything except as a loan, being a man of great\r\nrespectability and high honour\xe2\x80\x94indeed, a nobleman by blood.\r\n    I should be much obliged to you if you would keep the contents of\r\n    this letter a secret for the present, dear friend. We mean to\r\n    surprise Weatherbury by coming there soon as husband and wife,\r\n    though I blush to state it to one nearly a stranger. The sergeant\r\n    grew up in Weatherbury. Thanking you again for your kindness,\r\n\r\n\r\nI am, your sincere well-wisher,\r\nFANNY ROBIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read it, Mr. Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel; \xe2\x80\x9cif not, you had better\r\ndo so. I know you are interested in Fanny Robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood read the letter and looked grieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny\xe2\x80\x94poor Fanny! the end she is so confident of has not yet come, she\r\nshould remember\xe2\x80\x94and may never come. I see she gives no address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not one to build much hope upon in such a case as\r\nthis,\xe2\x80\x9d the farmer murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cthough he\xe2\x80\x99s a clever fellow, and up to\r\neverything. A slight romance attaches to him, too. His mother was a\r\nFrench governess, and it seems that a secret attachment existed between\r\nher and the late Lord Severn. She was married to a poor medical man,\r\nand soon after an infant was born; and while money was forthcoming all\r\nwent on well. Unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died; and he\r\ngot then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s in Casterbridge. He\r\nstayed there for some time, and might have worked himself into a\r\ndignified position of some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak\r\nof enlisting. I have much doubt if ever little Fanny will surprise us\r\nin the way she mentions\xe2\x80\x94very much doubt. A silly girl!\xe2\x80\x94silly girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was hurriedly burst open again, and in came running Cainy Ball\r\nout of breath, his mouth red and open, like the bell of a penny\r\ntrumpet, from which he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension\r\nof face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Cain Ball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy will you run so fast and lose\r\nyour breath so? I\xe2\x80\x99m always telling you of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94a puff of mee breath\xe2\x80\x94went\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94wrong way, please, Mister Oak, and\r\nmade me cough\xe2\x80\x94hok\xe2\x80\x94hok!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94what have you come for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve run to tell ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said the junior shepherd, supporting his\r\nexhausted youthful frame against the doorpost, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you must come\r\ndirectly. Two more ewes have twinned\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Shepherd\r\nOak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, jumping up, and dimissing for the present\r\nhis thoughts on poor Fanny. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a good boy to run and tell me,\r\nCain, and you shall smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat.\r\nBut, before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll mark this lot and\r\nhave done with \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron, dipped it into\r\nthe pot, and imprinted on the buttocks of the infant sheep the initials\r\nof her he delighted to muse on\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cB. E.,\xe2\x80\x9d which signified to all the\r\nregion round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer Bathsheba\r\nEverdene, and to no one else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Cainy, shoulder your two, and off. Good morning, Mr. Boldwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe shepherd lifted the sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had\r\nhimself brought, and vanished with them in the direction of the lambing\r\nfield hard by\xe2\x80\x94their frames being now in a sleek and hopeful state,\r\npleasantly contrasting with their death\xe2\x80\x99s-door plight of half an hour\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBoldwood followed him a little way up the field, hesitated, and turned\r\nback. He followed him again with a last resolve, annihilating return.\r\nOn approaching the nook in which the fold was constructed, the farmer\r\ndrew out his pocket-book, unfastened it, and allowed it to lie open on\r\nhis hand. A letter was revealed\xe2\x80\x94Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to ask you, Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with unreal carelessness, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nyou know whose writing this is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak glanced into the book, and replied instantly, with a flushed face,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak had coloured simply at the consciousness of sounding her name. He\r\nnow felt a strangely distressing qualm from a new thought. The letter\r\ncould of course be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry would not\r\nhave been necessary.\r\n\r\nBoldwood mistook his confusion: sensitive persons are always ready with\r\ntheir \xe2\x80\x9cIs it I?\xe2\x80\x9d in preference to objective reasoning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question was perfectly fair,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned\xe2\x80\x94and there was something\r\nincongruous in the serious earnestness with which he applied himself to\r\nan argument on a valentine. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it is always expected that privy\r\ninquiries will be made: that\xe2\x80\x99s where the\xe2\x80\x94fun lies.\xe2\x80\x9d If the word \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhad been \xe2\x80\x9ctorture,\xe2\x80\x9d it could not have been uttered with a more\r\nconstrained and restless countenance than was Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s then.\r\n\r\nSoon parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved man returned to his\r\nhouse to breakfast\xe2\x80\x94feeling twinges of shame and regret at having so far\r\nexposed his mood by those fevered questions to a stranger. He again\r\nplaced the letter on the mantelpiece, and sat down to think of the\r\ncircumstances attending it by the light of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nALL SAINTS\xe2\x80\x99 AND ALL SOULS\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a week-day morning a small congregation, consisting mainly of women\r\nand girls, rose from its knees in the mouldy nave of a church called\r\nAll Saints\xe2\x80\x99, in the distant barrack-town before-mentioned, at the end\r\nof a service without a sermon. They were about to disperse, when a\r\nsmart footstep, entering the porch and coming up the central passage,\r\narrested their attention. The step echoed with a ring unusual in a\r\nchurch; it was the clink of spurs. Everybody looked. A young cavalry\r\nsoldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons of a sergeant upon\r\nhis sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment which was only\r\nthe more marked by the intense vigour of his step, and by the\r\ndetermination upon his face to show none. A slight flush had mounted\r\nhis cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these women; but,\r\npassing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till he came close\r\nto the altar railing. Here for a moment he stood alone.\r\n\r\nThe officiating curate, who had not yet doffed his surplice, perceived\r\nthe new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space. He whispered to\r\nthe soldier, and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his turn whispered\r\nto an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and they also went up the\r\nchancel steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a wedding!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured some of the women, brightening. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe majority again sat down.\r\n\r\nThere was a creaking of machinery behind, and some of the young ones\r\nturned their heads. From the interior face of the west wall of the\r\ntower projected a little canopy with a quarter-jack and small bell\r\nbeneath it, the automaton being driven by the same clock machinery that\r\nstruck the large bell in the tower. Between the tower and the church\r\nwas a close screen, the door of which was kept shut during services,\r\nhiding this grotesque clockwork from sight. At present, however, the\r\ndoor was open, and the egress of the jack, the blows on the bell, and\r\nthe mannikin\xe2\x80\x99s retreat into the nook again, were visible to many, and\r\naudible throughout the church.\r\n\r\nThe jack had struck half-past eleven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the woman?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered some of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe young sergeant stood still with the abnormal rigidity of the old\r\npillars around. He faced the south-east, and was as silent as he was\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the minutes went on, and\r\nnobody else appeared, and not a soul moved. The rattle of the\r\nquarter-jack again from its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its\r\nfussy retreat, were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the\r\ncongregation to start palpably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder where the woman is!\xe2\x80\x9d a voice whispered again.\r\n\r\nThere began now that slight shifting of feet, that artificial coughing\r\namong several, which betrays a nervous suspense. At length there was a\r\ntitter. But the soldier never moved. There he stood, his face to the\r\nsouth-east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe clock ticked on. The women threw off their nervousness, and titters\r\nand giggling became more frequent. Then came a dead silence. Every one\r\nwas waiting for the end. Some persons may have noticed how\r\nextraordinarily the striking of quarters seems to quicken the flight of\r\ntime. It was hardly credible that the jack had not got wrong with the\r\nminutes when the rattle began again, the puppet emerged, and the four\r\nquarters were struck fitfully as before. One could almost be positive\r\nthat there was a malicious leer upon the hideous creature\xe2\x80\x99s face, and a\r\nmischievous delight in its twitchings. Then followed the dull and\r\nremote resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower above. The\r\nwomen were impressed, and there was no giggle this time.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk vanished. The\r\nsergeant had not yet turned; every woman in the church was waiting to\r\nsee his face, and he appeared to know it. At last he did turn, and\r\nstalked resolutely down the nave, braving them all, with a compressed\r\nlip. Two bowed and toothless old almsmen then looked at each other and\r\nchuckled, innocently enough; but the sound had a strange weird effect\r\nin that place.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the church was a paved square, around which several\r\noverhanging wood buildings of old time cast a picturesque shade. The\r\nyoung man on leaving the door went to cross the square, when, in the\r\nmiddle, he met a little woman. The expression of her face, which had\r\nbeen one of intense anxiety, sank at the sight of his nearly to terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a suppressed passion, fixedly looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank\xe2\x80\x94I made a mistake!\xe2\x80\x94I thought that church with the spire was\r\nAll Saints\xe2\x80\x99, and I was at the door at half-past eleven to a minute as\r\nyou said. I waited till a quarter to twelve, and found then that I was\r\nin All Souls\xe2\x80\x99. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much frightened, for I thought it could be\r\nto-morrow as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou fool, for so fooling me! But say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall it be to-morrow, Frank?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go through\r\nthat experience again for some time, I warrant you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut after all,\xe2\x80\x9d she expostulated in a trembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthe mistake\r\nwas not such a terrible thing! Now, dear Frank, when shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, when? God knows!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a light irony, and turning from\r\nher walked rapidly away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nIN THE MARKET-PLACE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday Boldwood was in Casterbridge market house as usual, when\r\nthe disturber of his dreams entered and became visible to him. Adam had\r\nawakened from his deep sleep, and behold! there was Eve. The farmer\r\ntook courage, and for the first time really looked at her.\r\n\r\nMaterial causes and emotional effects are not to be arranged in regular\r\nequation. The result from capital employed in the production of any\r\nmovement of a mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause\r\nitself is absurdly minute. When women are in a freakish mood, their\r\nusual intuition, either from carelessness or inherent defect, seemingly\r\nfails to teach them this, and hence it was that Bathsheba was fated to\r\nbe astonished to-day.\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked at her\xe2\x80\x94not slily, critically, or understandingly, but\r\nblankly at gaze, in the way a reaper looks up at a passing train\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nsomething foreign to his element, and but dimly understood. To Boldwood\r\nwomen had been remote phenomena rather than necessary\r\ncomplements\xe2\x80\x94comets of such uncertain aspect, movement, and permanence,\r\nthat whether their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and as\r\nsubject to laws as his own, or as absolutely erratic as they\r\nsuperficially appeared, he had not deemed it his duty to consider.\r\n\r\nHe saw her black hair, her correct facial curves and profile, and the\r\nroundness of her chin and throat. He saw then the side of her eyelids,\r\neyes, and lashes, and the shape of her ear. Next he noticed her figure,\r\nher skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.\r\n\r\nBoldwood thought her beautiful, but wondered whether he was right in\r\nhis thought, for it seemed impossible that this romance in the flesh,\r\nif so sweet as he imagined, could have been going on long without\r\ncreating a commotion of delight among men, and provoking more inquiry\r\nthan Bathsheba had done, even though that was not a little. To the best\r\nof his judgement neither nature nor art could improve this perfect one\r\nof an imperfect many. His heart began to move within him. Boldwood, it\r\nmust be remembered, though forty years of age, had never before\r\ninspected a woman with the very centre and force of his glance; they\r\nhad struck upon all his senses at wide angles.\r\n\r\nWas she really beautiful? He could not assure himself that his opinion\r\nwas true even now. He furtively said to a neighbour, \xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Everdene\r\nconsidered handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; she was a good deal noticed the first time she came, if you\r\nremember. A very handsome girl indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man is never more credulous than in receiving favourable opinions on\r\nthe beauty of a woman he is half, or quite, in love with; a mere\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s word on the point has the weight of an R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s. Boldwood was\r\nsatisfied now.\r\n\r\nAnd this charming woman had in effect said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cMarry me.\xe2\x80\x9d Why\r\nshould she have done that strange thing? Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s blindness to the\r\ndifference between approving of what circumstances suggest, and\r\noriginating what they do not suggest, was well matched by Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninsensibility to the possibly great issues of little beginnings.\r\n\r\nShe was at this moment coolly dealing with a dashing young farmer,\r\nadding up accounts with him as indifferently as if his face had been\r\nthe pages of a ledger. It was evident that such a nature as his had no\r\nattraction for a woman of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s taste. But Boldwood grew hot down\r\nto his hands with an incipient jealousy; he trod for the first time the\r\nthreshold of \xe2\x80\x9cthe injured lover\xe2\x80\x99s hell.\xe2\x80\x9d His first impulse was to go\r\nand thrust himself between them. This could be done, but only in one\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94by asking to see a sample of her corn. Boldwood renounced the idea.\r\nHe could not make the request; it was debasing loveliness to ask it to\r\nbuy and sell, and jarred with his conceptions of her.\r\n\r\nAll this time Bathsheba was conscious of having broken into that\r\ndignified stronghold at last. His eyes, she knew, were following her\r\neverywhere. This was a triumph; and had it come naturally, such a\r\ntriumph would have been the sweeter to her for this piquing delay. But\r\nit had been brought about by misdirected ingenuity, and she valued it\r\nonly as she valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit.\r\n\r\nBeing a woman with some good sense in reasoning on subjects wherein her\r\nheart was not involved, Bathsheba genuinely repented that a freak which\r\nhad owed its existence as much to Liddy as to herself, should ever have\r\nbeen undertaken, to disturb the placidity of a man she respected too\r\nhighly to deliberately tease.\r\n\r\nShe that day nearly formed the intention of begging his pardon on the\r\nvery next occasion of their meeting. The worst features of this\r\narrangement were that, if he thought she ridiculed him, an apology\r\nwould increase the offence by being disbelieved; and if he thought she\r\nwanted him to woo her, it would read like additional evidence of her\r\nforwardness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nBoldwood in Meditation\xe2\x80\x94Regret\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood was tenant of what was called Little Weatherbury Farm, and his\r\nperson was the nearest approach to aristocracy that this remoter\r\nquarter of the parish could boast of. Genteel strangers, whose god was\r\ntheir town, who might happen to be compelled to linger about this nook\r\nfor a day, heard the sound of light wheels, and prayed to see good\r\nsociety, to the degree of a solitary lord, or squire at the very least,\r\nbut it was only Mr. Boldwood going out for the day. They heard the\r\nsound of wheels yet once more, and were re-animated to expectancy: it\r\nwas only Mr. Boldwood coming home again.\r\n\r\nHis house stood recessed from the road, and the stables, which are to a\r\nfarm what a fireplace is to a room, were behind, their lower portions\r\nbeing lost amid bushes of laurel. Inside the blue door, open half-way\r\ndown, were to be seen at this time the backs and tails of half-a-dozen\r\nwarm and contented horses standing in their stalls; and as thus viewed,\r\nthey presented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a Moorish\r\narch, the tail being a streak down the midst of each. Over these, and\r\nlost to the eye gazing in from the outer light, the mouths of the same\r\nanimals could be heard busily sustaining the above-named warmth and\r\nplumpness by quantities of oats and hay. The restless and shadowy\r\nfigure of a colt wandered about a loose-box at the end, whilst the\r\nsteady grind of all the eaters was occasionally diversified by the\r\nrattle of a rope or the stamp of a foot.\r\n\r\nPacing up and down at the heels of the animals was Farmer Boldwood\r\nhimself. This place was his almonry and cloister in one: here, after\r\nlooking to the feeding of his four-footed dependants, the celibate\r\nwould walk and meditate of an evening till the moon\xe2\x80\x99s rays streamed in\r\nthrough the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness enveloped the scene.\r\n\r\nHis square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the\r\ncrowd and bustle of the market-house. In this meditative walk his foot\r\nmet the floor with heel and toe simultaneously, and his fine\r\nreddish-fleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure\r\nthe still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent and broad\r\nchin. A few clear and thread-like horizontal lines were the only\r\ninterruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead.\r\n\r\nThe phases of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s life were ordinary enough, but his was not an\r\nordinary nature. That stillness, which struck casual observers more\r\nthan anything else in his character and habit, and seemed so precisely\r\nlike the rest of inanition, may have been the perfect balance of\r\nenormous antagonistic forces\xe2\x80\x94positives and negatives in fine\r\nadjustment. His equilibrium disturbed, he was in extremity at once. If\r\nan emotion possessed him at all, it ruled him; a feeling not mastering\r\nhim was entirely latent. Stagnant or rapid, it was never slow. He was\r\nalways hit mortally, or he was missed.\r\n\r\nHe had no light and careless touches in his constitution, either for\r\ngood or for evil. Stern in the outlines of action, mild in the details,\r\nhe was serious throughout all. He saw no absurd sides to the follies of\r\nlife, and thus, though not quite companionable in the eyes of merry men\r\nand scoffers, and those to whom all things show life as a jest, he was\r\nnot intolerable to the earnest and those acquainted with grief. Being a\r\nman who read all the dramas of life seriously, if he failed to please\r\nwhen they were comedies, there was no frivolous treatment to reproach\r\nhim for when they chanced to end tragically.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and silent shape upon\r\nwhich she had so carelessly thrown a seed was a hotbed of tropic\r\nintensity. Had she known Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s moods, her blame would have been\r\nfearful, and the stain upon her heart ineradicable. Moreover, had she\r\nknown her present power for good or evil over this man, she would have\r\ntrembled at her responsibility. Luckily for her present, unluckily for\r\nher future tranquillity, her understanding had not yet told her what\r\nBoldwood was. Nobody knew entirely; for though it was possible to form\r\nguesses concerning his wild capabilities from old floodmarks faintly\r\nvisible, he had never been seen at the high tides which caused them.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood came to the stable-door and looked forth across the\r\nlevel fields. Beyond the first enclosure was a hedge, and on the other\r\nside of this a meadow belonging to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s farm.\r\n\r\nIt was now early spring\xe2\x80\x94the time of going to grass with the sheep, when\r\nthey have the first feed of the meadows, before these are laid up for\r\nmowing. The wind, which had been blowing east for several weeks, had\r\nveered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come\r\nabruptly\xe2\x80\x94almost without a beginning. It was that period in the vernal\r\nquarter when we may suppose the Dryads to be waking for the season. The\r\nvegetable world begins to move and swell and the saps to rise, till in\r\nthe completest silence of lone gardens and trackless plantations, where\r\neverything seems helpless and still after the bond and slavery of\r\nfrost, there are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and\r\npulls-all-together, in comparison with which the powerful tugs of\r\ncranes and pulleys in a noisy city are but pigmy efforts.\r\n\r\nBoldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw there three figures.\r\nThey were those of Miss Everdene, Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Ball.\r\n\r\nWhen Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s figure shone upon the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes it lighted him up\r\nas the moon lights up a great tower. A man\xe2\x80\x99s body is as the shell, or\r\nthe tablet, of his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or\r\nself-contained. There was a change in Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s exterior from its\r\nformer impassibleness; and his face showed that he was now living\r\noutside his defences for the first time, and with a fearful sense of\r\nexposure. It is the usual experience of strong natures when they love.\r\n\r\nAt last he arrived at a conclusion. It was to go across and inquire\r\nboldly of her.\r\n\r\nThe insulation of his heart by reserve during these many years, without\r\na channel of any kind for disposable emotion, had worked its effect. It\r\nhas been observed more than once that the causes of love are chiefly\r\nsubjective, and Boldwood was a living testimony to the truth of the\r\nproposition. No mother existed to absorb his devotion, no sister for\r\nhis tenderness, no idle ties for sense. He became surcharged with the\r\ncompound, which was genuine lover\xe2\x80\x99s love.\r\n\r\nHe approached the gate of the meadow. Beyond it the ground was\r\nmelodious with ripples, and the sky with larks; the low bleating of the\r\nflock mingling with both. Mistress and man were engaged in the\r\noperation of making a lamb \xe2\x80\x9ctake,\xe2\x80\x9d which is performed whenever an ewe\r\nhas lost her own offspring, one of the twins of another ewe being given\r\nher as a substitute. Gabriel had skinned the dead lamb, and was tying\r\nthe skin over the body of the live lamb, in the customary manner,\r\nwhilst Bathsheba was holding open a little pen of four hurdles, into\r\nwhich the mother and foisted lamb were driven, where they would remain\r\ntill the old sheep conceived an affection for the young one.\r\n\r\nBathsheba looked up at the completion of the man\xc5\x93uvre and saw the\r\nfarmer by the gate, where he was overhung by a willow tree in full\r\nbloom. Gabriel, to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April\r\nday, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and instantly\r\ndiscerned thereon the mark of some influence from without, in the form\r\nof a keenly self-conscious reddening. He also turned and beheld\r\nBoldwood.\r\n\r\nAt once connecting these signs with the letter Boldwood had shown him,\r\nGabriel suspected her of some coquettish procedure begun by that means,\r\nand carried on since, he knew not how.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood had read the pantomime denoting that they were aware of\r\nhis presence, and the perception was as too much light turned upon his\r\nnew sensibility. He was still in the road, and by moving on he hoped\r\nthat neither would recognize that he had originally intended to enter\r\nthe field. He passed by with an utter and overwhelming sensation of\r\nignorance, shyness, and doubt. Perhaps in her manner there were signs\r\nthat she wished to see him\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not\xe2\x80\x94he could not read a woman. The\r\ncabala of this erotic philosophy seemed to consist of the subtlest\r\nmeanings expressed in misleading ways. Every turn, look, word, and\r\naccent contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious import, and\r\nnot one had ever been pondered by him until now.\r\n\r\nAs for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the belief that Farmer\r\nBoldwood had walked by on business or in idleness. She collected the\r\nprobabilities of the case, and concluded that she was herself\r\nresponsible for Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s appearance there. It troubled her much to\r\nsee what a great flame a little wildfire was likely to kindle.\r\nBathsheba was no schemer for marriage, nor was she deliberately a\r\ntrifler with the affections of men, and a censor\xe2\x80\x99s experience on seeing\r\nan actual flirt after observing her would have been a feeling of\r\nsurprise that Bathsheba could be so different from such a one, and yet\r\nso like what a flirt is supposed to be.\r\n\r\nShe resolved never again, by look or by sign, to interrupt the steady\r\nflow of this man\xe2\x80\x99s life. But a resolution to avoid an evil is seldom\r\nframed till the evil is so far advanced as to make avoidance\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nTHE SHEEP-WASHING\xe2\x80\x94THE OFFER\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood did eventually call upon her. She was not at home. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured. In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he had\r\nforgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist\xe2\x80\x94that being\r\nas much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself, her\r\nprobable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year. This,\r\nand the other oversights Boldwood was guilty of, were natural to the\r\nmood, and still more natural to the circumstances. The great aids to\r\nidealization in love were present here: occasional observation of her\r\nfrom a distance, and the absence of social intercourse with her\xe2\x80\x94visual\r\nfamiliarity, oral strangeness. The smaller human elements were kept out\r\nof sight; the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living\r\nand doing were disguised by the accident of lover and loved-one not\r\nbeing on visiting terms; and there was hardly awakened a thought in\r\nBoldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her, or that\r\nshe, like all others, had moments of commonplace, when to be least\r\nplainly seen was to be most prettily remembered. Thus a mild sort of\r\napotheosis took place in his fancy, whilst she still lived and breathed\r\nwithin his own horizon, a troubled creature like himself.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of May when the farmer determined to be no longer\r\nrepulsed by trivialities or distracted by suspense. He had by this time\r\ngrown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less even\r\nwhen it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the\r\nsituation. On inquiring for her at her house they had told him she was\r\nat the sheep-washing, and he went off to seek her there.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-washing pool was a perfectly circular basin of brickwork in\r\nthe meadows, full of the clearest water. To birds on the wing its\r\nglassy surface, reflecting the light sky, must have been visible for\r\nmiles around as a glistening Cyclops\xe2\x80\x99 eye in a green face. The grass\r\nabout the margin at this season was a sight to remember long\xe2\x80\x94in a minor\r\nsort of way. Its activity in sucking the moisture from the rich damp\r\nsod was almost a process observable by the eye. The outskirts of this\r\nlevel water-meadow were diversified by rounded and hollow pastures,\r\nwhere just now every flower that was not a buttercup was a daisy. The\r\nriver slid along noiselessly as a shade, the swelling reeds and sedge\r\nforming a flexible palisade upon its moist brink. To the north of the\r\nmead were trees, the leaves of which were new, soft, and moist, not yet\r\nhaving stiffened and darkened under summer sun and drought, their\r\ncolour being yellow beside a green\xe2\x80\x94green beside a yellow. From the\r\nrecesses of this knot of foliage the loud notes of three cuckoos were\r\nresounding through the still air.\r\n\r\nBoldwood went meditating down the slopes with his eyes on his boots,\r\nwhich the yellow pollen from the buttercups had bronzed in artistic\r\ngradations. A tributary of the main stream flowed through the basin of\r\nthe pool by an inlet and outlet at opposite points of its diameter.\r\nShepherd Oak, Jan Coggan, Moon, Poorgrass, Cain Ball, and several\r\nothers were assembled here, all dripping wet to the very roots of their\r\nhair, and Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding-habit\xe2\x80\x94the most\r\nelegant she had ever worn\xe2\x80\x94the reins of her horse being looped over her\r\narm. Flagons of cider were rolling about upon the green. The meek sheep\r\nwere pushed into the pool by Coggan and Matthew Moon, who stood by the\r\nlower hatch, immersed to their waists; then Gabriel, who stood on the\r\nbrink, thrust them under as they swam along, with an instrument like a\r\ncrutch, formed for the purpose, and also for assisting the exhausted\r\nanimals when the wool became saturated and they began to sink. They\r\nwere let out against the stream, and through the upper opening, all\r\nimpurities flowing away below. Cainy Ball and Joseph, who performed\r\nthis latter operation, were if possible wetter than the rest; they\r\nresembled dolphins under a fountain, every protuberance and angle of\r\ntheir clothes dribbling forth a small rill.\r\n\r\nBoldwood came close and bade her good morning, with such constraint\r\nthat she could not but think he had stepped across to the washing for\r\nits own sake, hoping not to find her there; more, she fancied his brow\r\nsevere and his eye slighting. Bathsheba immediately contrived to\r\nwithdraw, and glided along by the river till she was a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw\r\noff. She heard footsteps brushing the grass, and had a consciousness\r\nthat love was encircling her like a perfume. Instead of turning or\r\nwaiting, Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but Boldwood\r\nseemed determined, and pressed on till they were completely past the\r\nbend of the river. Here, without being seen, they could hear the\r\nsplashing and shouts of the washers above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene!\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer.\r\n\r\nShe trembled, turned, and said \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning.\xe2\x80\x9d His tone was so utterly\r\nremoved from all she had expected as a beginning. It was lowness and\r\nquiet accentuated: an emphasis of deep meanings, their form, at the\r\nsame time, being scarcely expressed. Silence has sometimes a remarkable\r\npower of showing itself as the disembodied soul of feeling wandering\r\nwithout its carcase, and it is then more impressive than speech. In the\r\nsame way, to say a little is often to tell more than to say a great\r\ndeal. Boldwood told everything in that word.\r\n\r\nAs the consciousness expands on learning that what was fancied to be\r\nthe rumble of wheels is the reverberation of thunder, so did\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s at her intuitive conviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel\xe2\x80\x94almost too much\xe2\x80\x94to think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a solemn simplicity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to speak to you without preface. My life is not my own\r\nsince I have beheld you clearly, Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94I come to make you an\r\noffer of marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral countenance, and all\r\nthe motion she made was that of closing lips which had previously been\r\na little parted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am now forty-one years old,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have been called a\r\nconfirmed bachelor, and I was a confirmed bachelor. I had never any\r\nviews of myself as a husband in my earlier days, nor have I made any\r\ncalculation on the subject since I have been older. But we all change,\r\nand my change, in this matter, came with seeing you. I have felt\r\nlately, more and more, that my present way of living is bad in every\r\nrespect. Beyond all things, I want you as my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel, Mr. Boldwood, that though I respect you much, I do not\r\nfeel\xe2\x80\x94what would justify me to\xe2\x80\x94in accepting your offer,\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered.\r\n\r\nThis giving back of dignity for dignity seemed to open the sluices of\r\nfeeling that Boldwood had as yet kept closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy life is a burden without you,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in a low voice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant you\xe2\x80\x94I want you to let me say I love you again and again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba answered nothing, and the horse upon her arm seemed so\r\nimpressed that instead of cropping the herbage she looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think and hope you care enough for me to listen to what I have to\r\ntell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s momentary impulse at hearing this was to ask why he thought\r\nthat, till she remembered that, far from being a conceited assumption\r\non Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious\r\nreflection based on deceptive premises of her own offering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could say courteous flatteries to you,\xe2\x80\x9d the farmer continued\r\nin an easier tone, \xe2\x80\x9cand put my rugged feeling into a graceful shape:\r\nbut I have neither power nor patience to learn such things. I want you\r\nfor my wife\xe2\x80\x94so wildly that no other feeling can abide in me; but I\r\nshould not have spoken out had I not been led to hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe valentine again! O that valentine!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, but not a\r\nword to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can love me say so, Miss Everdene. If not\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Boldwood, it is painful to have to say I am surprised, so that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how to answer you with propriety and respect\xe2\x80\x94but am only\r\njust able to speak out my feeling\xe2\x80\x94I mean my meaning; that I am afraid I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t marry you, much as I respect you. You are too dignified for me to\r\nsuit you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Miss Everdene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I know I ought never to have dreamt of sending that\r\nvalentine\xe2\x80\x94forgive me, sir\xe2\x80\x94it was a wanton thing which no woman with any\r\nself-respect should have done. If you will only pardon my\r\nthoughtlessness, I promise never to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say thoughtlessness! Make me think it was something\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94that it was a sort of prophetic instinct\xe2\x80\x94the beginning of a\r\nfeeling that you would like me. You torture me to say it was done in\r\nthoughtlessness\xe2\x80\x94I never thought of it in that light, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t endure\r\nit. Ah! I wish I knew how to win you! but that I can\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x94I can only\r\nask if I have already got you. If I have not, and it is not true that\r\nyou have come unwittingly to me as I have to you, I can say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not fallen in love with you, Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94certainly I must say\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d She allowed a very small smile to creep for the first time over\r\nher serious face in saying this, and the white row of upper teeth, and\r\nkeenly-cut lips already noticed, suggested an idea of heartlessness,\r\nwhich was immediately contradicted by the pleasant eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will just think\xe2\x80\x94in kindness and condescension think\xe2\x80\x94if you\r\ncannot bear with me as a husband! I fear I am too old for you, but\r\nbelieve me I will take more care of you than would many a man of your\r\nown age. I will protect and cherish you with all my strength\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nindeed! You shall have no cares\xe2\x80\x94be worried by no household affairs, and\r\nlive quite at ease, Miss Everdene. The dairy superintendence shall be\r\ndone by a man\xe2\x80\x94I can afford it well\xe2\x80\x94you shall never have so much as to\r\nlook out of doors at haymaking time, or to think of weather in the\r\nharvest. I rather cling to the chaise, because it is the same my poor\r\nfather and mother drove, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it I will sell it, and\r\nyou shall have a pony-carriage of your own. I cannot say how far above\r\nevery other idea and object on earth you seem to me\xe2\x80\x94nobody knows\xe2\x80\x94God\r\nonly knows\xe2\x80\x94how much you are to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s heart was young, and it swelled with sympathy for the\r\ndeep-natured man who spoke so simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say it! don\xe2\x80\x99t! I cannot bear you to feel so much, and me to feel\r\nnothing. And I am afraid they will notice us, Mr. Boldwood. Will you\r\nlet the matter rest now? I cannot think collectedly. I did not know you\r\nwere going to say this to me. Oh, I am wicked to have made you suffer\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d She was frightened as well as agitated at his vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay then, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t absolutely refuse. Do not quite refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing. I cannot answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may speak to you again on the subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may think of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose you may think of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hope to obtain you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94do not hope! Let us go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will call upon you again to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94please not. Give me time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I will give you any time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said earnestly and gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhappier now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I beg you! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be happier if happiness only comes from my\r\nagreeing. Be neutral, Mr. Boldwood! I must think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then she turned away. Boldwood dropped his gaze to the ground, and\r\nstood long like a man who did not know where he was. Realities then\r\nreturned upon him like the pain of a wound received in an excitement\r\nwhich eclipses it, and he, too, then went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nPERPLEXITY\xe2\x80\x94GRINDING THE SHEARS\xe2\x80\x94A QUARREL\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is so disinterested and kind to offer me all that I can desire,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBathsheba mused.\r\n\r\nYet Farmer Boldwood, whether by nature kind or the reverse to kind, did\r\nnot exercise kindness here. The rarest offerings of the purest loves\r\nare but a self-indulgence, and no generosity at all.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able to\r\nlook calmly at his offer. It was one which many women of her own\r\nstation in the neighbourhood, and not a few of higher rank, would have\r\nbeen wild to accept and proud to publish. In every point of view,\r\nranging from politic to passionate, it was desirable that she, a lonely\r\ngirl, should marry, and marry this earnest, well-to-do, and respected\r\nman. He was close to her doors: his standing was sufficient: his\r\nqualities were even supererogatory. Had she felt, which she did not,\r\nany wish whatever for the married state in the abstract, she could not\r\nreasonably have rejected him, being a woman who frequently appealed to\r\nher understanding for deliverance from her whims. Boldwood as a means\r\nto marriage was unexceptionable: she esteemed and liked him, yet she\r\ndid not want him. It appears that ordinary men take wives because\r\npossession is not possible without marriage, and that ordinary women\r\naccept husbands because marriage is not possible without possession;\r\nwith totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides. But\r\nthe understood incentive on the woman\xe2\x80\x99s part was wanting here. Besides,\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s position as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a\r\nnovel one, and the novelty had not yet begun to wear off.\r\n\r\nBut a disquiet filled her which was somewhat to her credit, for it\r\nwould have affected few. Beyond the mentioned reasons with which she\r\ncombated her objections, she had a strong feeling that, having been the\r\none who began the game, she ought in honesty to accept the\r\nconsequences. Still the reluctance remained. She said in the same\r\nbreath that it would be ungenerous not to marry Boldwood, and that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it to save her life.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s was an impulsive nature under a deliberative aspect. An\r\nElizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart in spirit, she often performed\r\nactions of the greatest temerity with a manner of extreme discretion.\r\nMany of her thoughts were perfect syllogisms; unluckily they always\r\nremained thoughts. Only a few were irrational assumptions; but,\r\nunfortunately, they were the ones which most frequently grew into\r\ndeeds.\r\n\r\nThe next day to that of the declaration she found Gabriel Oak at the\r\nbottom of her garden, grinding his shears for the sheep-shearing. All\r\nthe surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same\r\noperation; the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts of\r\nthe village as from an armoury previous to a campaign. Peace and war\r\nkiss each other at their hours of preparation\xe2\x80\x94sickles, scythes, shears,\r\nand pruning-hooks, ranking with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their\r\ncommon necessity for point and edge.\r\n\r\nCainy Ball turned the handle of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s grindstone, his head\r\nperforming a melancholy see-saw up and down with each turn of the\r\nwheel. Oak stood somewhat as Eros is represented when in the act of\r\nsharpening his arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his body\r\nthrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side-ways, with a\r\ncritical compression of the lips and contraction of the eyelids to\r\ncrown the attitude.\r\n\r\nHis mistress came up and looked upon them in silence for a minute or\r\ntwo; then she said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare. I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn the winch\r\nof the grindstone. I want to speak to you, Gabriel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCain departed, and Bathsheba took the handle. Gabriel had glanced up in\r\nintense surprise, quelled its expression, and looked down again.\r\nBathsheba turned the winch, and Gabriel applied the shears.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar motion involved in turning a wheel has a wonderful\r\ntendency to benumb the mind. It is a sort of attenuated variety of\r\nIxion\xe2\x80\x99s punishment, and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of\r\ngaols. The brain gets muddled, the head grows heavy, and the body\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncentre of gravity seems to settle by degrees in a leaden lump somewhere\r\nbetween the eyebrows and the crown. Bathsheba felt the unpleasant\r\nsymptoms after two or three dozen turns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhead is in a whirl, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel turned. Bathsheba then began, with some awkwardness, allowing\r\nher thoughts to stray occasionally from her story to attend to the\r\nshears, which required a little nicety in sharpening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to ask you if the men made any observations on my going\r\nbehind the sedge with Mr. Boldwood yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the shears right, miss\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know the way\xe2\x80\x94hold like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two hands completely in\r\nhis own (taking each as we sometimes slap a child\xe2\x80\x99s hand in teaching\r\nhim to write), grasped the shears with her. \xe2\x80\x9cIncline the edge so,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHands and shears were inclined to suit the words, and held thus for a\r\npeculiarly long time by the instructor as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cLoose my hands. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have them\r\nheld! Turn the winch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel freed her hands quietly, retired to his handle, and the\r\ngrinding went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the men think it odd?\xe2\x80\x9d she said again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOdd was not the idea, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s name and your own were likely to be flung over\r\npulpit together before the year was out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so by the look of them! Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in it. A more\r\nfoolish remark was never made, and I want you to contradict it: that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I came for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel looked incredulous and sad, but between his moments of\r\nincredulity, relieved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have heard our conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, Bathsheba!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, stopping the handle, and gazing into\r\nher face with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean this, that if Mr. Boldwood really spoke of marriage, I bain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to tell a story and say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t to please you. I have already\r\ntried to please you too much for my own good!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity. She did not know\r\nwhether to pity him for disappointed love of her, or to be angry with\r\nhim for having got over it\xe2\x80\x94his tone being ambiguous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I wanted you just to mention that it was not true I was going\r\nto be married to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, with a slight decline in her\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can say that to them if you wish, Miss Everdene. And I could\r\nlikewise give an opinion to \xe2\x80\x99ee on what you have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel bitterly, and going on with his turning,\r\nhis words rising and falling in a regular swell and cadence as he\r\nstooped or rose with the winch, which directed them, according to his\r\nposition, perpendicularly into the earth, or horizontally along the\r\ngarden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon the ground.\r\n\r\nWith Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act; but, as does not always\r\nhappen, time gained was prudence insured. It must be added, however,\r\nthat time was very seldom gained. At this period the single opinion in\r\nthe parish on herself and her doings that she valued as sounder than\r\nher own was Gabriel Oak\xe2\x80\x99s. And the outspoken honesty of his character\r\nwas such that on any subject, even that of her love for, or marriage\r\nwith, another man, the same disinterestedness of opinion might be\r\ncalculated on, and be had for the asking. Thoroughly convinced of the\r\nimpossibility of his own suit, a high resolve constrained him not to\r\ninjure that of another. This is a lover\xe2\x80\x99s most stoical virtue, as the\r\nlack of it is a lover\xe2\x80\x99s most venial sin. Knowing he would reply truly\r\nshe asked the question, painful as she must have known the subject\r\nwould be. Such is the selfishness of some charming women. Perhaps it\r\nwas some excuse for her thus torturing honesty to her own advantage,\r\nthat she had absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is your opinion of my conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and meek, and comely woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s face coloured with the angry crimson of a\r\nDanby sunset. But she forbore to utter this feeling, and the reticence\r\nof her tongue only made the loquacity of her face the more noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the rudeness of my reprimanding you, for I know\r\nit is rudeness; but I thought it would do good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe instantly replied sarcastically\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that I see in your abuse\r\nthe praise of discerning people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, for I said it honestly and with every\r\nserious meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. But, unfortunately, when you try not to speak in jest you are\r\namusing\xe2\x80\x94just as when you wish to avoid seriousness you sometimes say a\r\nsensible word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a hard hit, but Bathsheba had unmistakably lost her temper, and\r\non that account Gabriel had never in his life kept his own better. He\r\nsaid nothing. She then broke out\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may ask, I suppose, where in particular my unworthiness lies? In my\r\nnot marrying you, perhaps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot by any means,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have long given up\r\nthinking of that matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr wishing it, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and it was apparent that she\r\nexpected an unhesitating denial of this supposition.\r\n\r\nWhatever Gabriel felt, he coolly echoed her words\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr wishing it either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA woman may be treated with a bitterness which is sweet to her, and\r\nwith a rudeness which is not offensive. Bathsheba would have submitted\r\nto an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel protested that\r\nhe was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity of passion\r\nunrequited is bearable, even if it stings and anathematizes\xe2\x80\x94there is a\r\ntriumph in the humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife. This was\r\nwhat she had been expecting, and what she had not got. To be lectured\r\nbecause the lecturer saw her in the cold morning light of\r\nopen-shuttered disillusion was exasperating. He had not finished,\r\neither. He continued in a more agitated voice:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is (since you ask it) that you are greatly to blame for\r\nplaying pranks upon a man like Mr. Boldwood, merely as a pastime.\r\nLeading on a man you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for is not a praiseworthy action. And\r\neven, Miss Everdene, if you seriously inclined towards him, you might\r\nhave let him find it out in some way of true loving-kindness, and not\r\nby sending him a valentine\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba laid down the shears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot allow any man to\xe2\x80\x94to criticise my private conduct!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNor will I for a minute. So you\xe2\x80\x99ll please leave the farm at\r\nthe end of the week!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may have been a peculiarity\xe2\x80\x94at any rate it was a fact\xe2\x80\x94that when\r\nBathsheba was swayed by an emotion of an earthly sort her lower lip\r\ntrembled: when by a refined emotion, her upper or heavenward one. Her\r\nnether lip quivered now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, so I will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel calmly. He had been held to her by\r\na beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking, rather\r\nthan by a chain he could not break. \xe2\x80\x9cI should be even better pleased to\r\ngo at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo at once then, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, her eyes flashing at\r\nhis, though never meeting them. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me see your face any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94so it shall be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he took his shears and went away from her in placid dignity, as\r\nMoses left the presence of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nTROUBLES IN THE FOLD\xe2\x80\x94A MESSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nGabriel Oak had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came\r\nrunning up to the house of the mistress of the Upper Farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever _is_ the matter, men?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, meeting them at the door\r\njust as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a\r\nmoment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which she\r\nhad accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeventy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty-nine!\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Sheep have broke fence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94And got into a field of young clover,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Young clover!\xe2\x80\x9d said Moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Clover!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they be getting blasted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery Fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat they be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will all die as dead as nits, if they bain\xe2\x80\x99t got out and cured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Tall.\r\n\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern.\r\nFray\xe2\x80\x99s forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise, after\r\nthe pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban\r\nTall\xe2\x80\x99s lips were thin, and his face was rigid. Matthew\xe2\x80\x99s jaws sank, and\r\nhis eyes turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, \xe2\x80\x9cand I was sitting at home, looking for Ephesians,\r\nand says I to myself, \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians\r\nin this danged Testament,\xe2\x80\x99 when who should come in but Henery there:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joseph,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98the sheep have blasted theirselves\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech\r\nexclamation. Moreover, she had hardly recovered her equanimity since\r\nthe disturbance which she had suffered from Oak\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x94oh, you fools!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, throwing the\r\nparasol and Prayer-book into the passage, and running out of doors in\r\nthe direction signified. \xe2\x80\x9cTo come to me, and not go and get them out\r\ndirectly! Oh, the stupid numskulls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer eyes were at their darkest and brightest now. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s beauty\r\nbelonging rather to the demonian than to the angelic school, she never\r\nlooked so well as when she was angry\xe2\x80\x94and particularly when the effect\r\nwas heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress, carefully put on\r\nbefore a glass.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the\r\nclover-field, Joseph sinking down in the midst when about half-way,\r\nlike an individual withering in a world which was more and more\r\ninsupportable. Having once received the stimulus that her presence\r\nalways gave them they went round among the sheep with a will. The\r\nmajority of the afflicted animals were lying down, and could not be\r\nstirred. These were bodily lifted out, and the others driven into the\r\nadjoining field. Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several more\r\nfell down, and lay helpless and livid as the rest.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest\r\nspecimens of her prime flock as they rolled there\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nSwoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and\r\nshort, whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what can I do, what can I do!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, helplessly. \xe2\x80\x9cSheep\r\nare such unfortunate animals!\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s always something happening to\r\nthem! I never knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape\r\nor other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one way of saving them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat way? Tell me quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you do it? Can I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. We can\xe2\x80\x99t, nor you neither. It must be done in a particular\r\nspot. If ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab the ewe and\r\nkill her. Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they must die,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a resigned tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, now\r\njust come up. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could cure \xe2\x80\x99em all if he were here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he? Let\xe2\x80\x99s get him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShepherd Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, he\xe2\x80\x99s a clever man in talents!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that he is so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laban Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you name that man in my presence!\xe2\x80\x9d she said excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntold you never to allude to him, nor shall you if you stay with me.\r\nAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, brightening, \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Boldwood knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo of his store ewes got into some\r\nvetches t\xe2\x80\x99other day, and were just like these. He sent a man on\r\nhorseback here post-haste for Gable, and Gable went and saved \xe2\x80\x99em.\r\nFarmer Boldwood hev got the thing they do it with. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a holler pipe,\r\nwith a sharp pricker inside. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94a holler pipe,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Joseph. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sure\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the machine,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in Henery Fray, reflectively,\r\nwith an Oriental indifference to the flight of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Bathsheba, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t stand there with your \xe2\x80\x98ayes\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nyour \xe2\x80\x98sures\xe2\x80\x99 talking at me! Get somebody to cure the sheep instantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll then stalked off in consternation, to get somebody as directed,\r\nwithout any idea of who it was to be. In a minute they had vanished\r\nthrough the gate, and she stood alone with the dying flock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever will I send for him\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d she said firmly.\r\n\r\nOne of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly, extended itself,\r\nand jumped high into the air. The leap was an astonishing one. The ewe\r\nfell heavily, and lay still.\r\n\r\nBathsheba went up to it. The sheep was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what shall I do\xe2\x80\x94what shall I do!\xe2\x80\x9d she again exclaimed, wringing\r\nher hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t send for him. No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most vigorous expression of a resolution does not always coincide\r\nwith the greatest vigour of the resolution itself. It is often flung\r\nout as a sort of prop to support a decaying conviction which, whilst\r\nstrong, required no enunciation to prove it so. The \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nBathsheba meant virtually, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed her assistants through the gate, and lifted her hand to\r\none of them. Laban answered to her signal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Oak staying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAcross the valley at Nest Cottage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he must return\r\ninstantly\xe2\x80\x94that I say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes was on Poll, the\r\nbay, bare-backed, and with only a halter by way of rein. He diminished\r\ndown the hill.\r\n\r\nBathsheba watched. So did all the rest. Tall cantered along the\r\nbridle-path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The Flats,\r\nCappel\xe2\x80\x99s Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge, and\r\nascended from the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the other\r\nside. The cottage to which Gabriel had retired before taking his final\r\ndeparture from the locality was visible as a white spot on the opposite\r\nhill, backed by blue firs. Bathsheba walked up and down. The men\r\nentered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb\r\ncreatures by rubbing them. Nothing availed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba continued walking. The horse was seen descending the hill,\r\nand the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order:\r\nWhitepits, Springmead, Cappel\xe2\x80\x99s Piece, The Flats, Middle Field,\r\nSheeplands, Sixteen Acres. She hoped Tall had had presence of mind\r\nenough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot. The\r\nrider neared them. It was Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what folly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nGabriel was not visible anywhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is already gone!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nTall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his face tragic as\r\nMorton\xe2\x80\x99s after the battle of Shrewsbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal\r\n_lettre-de-cachet_ could possibly have miscarried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says _beggars mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be choosers_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Laban.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young farmer, opening her eyes and drawing in her\r\nbreath for an outburst. Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a\r\nhurdle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he shall not come onless you request en to come civilly and in\r\na proper manner, as becomes any \xe2\x80\x99ooman begging a favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s his answer! Where does he get his airs? Who am I, then,\r\nto be treated like that? Shall I beg to a man who has begged to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother of the flock sprang into the air, and fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe men looked grave, as if they suppressed opinion.\r\n\r\nBathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears. The strait she was in\r\nthrough pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer: she burst\r\nout crying bitterly; they all saw it; and she attempted no further\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cry about it, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Smallbury,\r\ncompassionately. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not ask him softer like? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d come then.\r\nGable is a true man in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is a wicked\r\ncruelty to me\xe2\x80\x94it is\xe2\x80\x94it is!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he drives me to do what\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; yes, he does!\xe2\x80\x94Tall, come indoors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this collapse, not very dignified for the head of an\r\nestablishment, she went into the house, Tall at her heels. Here she sat\r\ndown and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive sobs of\r\nconvalescence which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell follows a\r\nstorm. The note was none the less polite for being written in a hurry.\r\nShe held it at a distance, was about to fold it, then added these words\r\nat the bottom:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Do not desert me, Gabriel!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed her lips, as if\r\nthereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in examining\r\nwhether such strategy were justifiable. The note was despatched as the\r\nmessage had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the\r\nmessenger\xe2\x80\x99s departure and the sound of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s tramp again outside.\r\nShe could not watch this time, but, leaning over the old bureau at\r\nwhich she had written the letter, closed her eyes, as if to keep out\r\nboth hope and fear.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, was a promising one. Gabriel was not angry: he was\r\nsimply neutral, although her first command had been so haughty. Such\r\nimperiousness would have damned a little less beauty; and on the other\r\nhand, such beauty would have redeemed a little less imperiousness.\r\n\r\nShe went out when the horse was heard, and looked up. A mounted figure\r\npassed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field of sheep,\r\nthe rider turning his face in receding. Gabriel looked at her. It was a\r\nmoment when a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and tongue tell distinctly opposite tales.\r\nBathsheba looked full of gratitude, and she said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the one\r\nspeech in the language that he could pardon for not being commendation\r\nof his readiness now.\r\n\r\nGabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on. She knew from the\r\nlook which sentence in her note had brought him. Bathsheba followed to\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nGabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms. He had flung off\r\nhis coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and taken from his pocket the\r\ninstrument of salvation. It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance\r\npassing down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a dexterity\r\nthat would have graced a hospital surgeon. Passing his hand over the\r\nsheep\xe2\x80\x99s left flank, and selecting the proper point, he punctured the\r\nskin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube; then he suddenly\r\nwithdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place. A current of air\r\nrushed up the tube, forcible enough to have extinguished a candle held\r\nat the orifice.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time;\r\nand the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now.\r\nForty-nine operations were successfully performed. Owing to the great\r\nhurry necessitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock, Gabriel\r\nmissed his aim in one case, and in one only\xe2\x80\x94striking wide of the mark,\r\nand inflicting a mortal blow at once upon the suffering ewe. Four had\r\ndied; three recovered without an operation. The total number of sheep\r\nwhich had thus strayed and injured themselves so dangerously was\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\nWhen the love-led man had ceased from his labours, Bathsheba came and\r\nlooked him in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel, will you stay on with me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling winningly, and\r\nnot troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end,\r\nbecause there was going to be another smile soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled on him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\nTHE GREAT BARN AND THE SHEEP-SHEARERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMen thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as often by not\r\nmaking the most of good spirits when they have them as by lacking good\r\nspirits when they are indispensable. Gabriel lately, for the first time\r\nsince his prostration by misfortune, had been independent in thought\r\nand vigorous in action to a marked extent\xe2\x80\x94conditions which, powerless\r\nwithout an opportunity as an opportunity without them is barren, would\r\nhave given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable conjunction\r\nshould have occurred. But this incurable loitering beside Bathsheba\r\nEverdene stole his time ruinously. The spring tides were going by\r\nwithout floating him off, and the neap might soon come which could not.\r\n\r\nIt was the first day of June, and the sheep-shearing season culminated,\r\nthe landscape, even to the leanest pasture, being all health and\r\ncolour. Every green was young, every pore was open, and every stalk was\r\nswollen with racing currents of juice. God was palpably present in the\r\ncountry, and the devil had gone with the world to town. Flossy catkins\r\nof the later kinds, fern-sprouts like bishops\xe2\x80\x99 croziers, the\r\nsquare-headed moschatel, the odd cuckoo-pint,\xe2\x80\x94like an apoplectic saint\r\nin a niche of malachite,\xe2\x80\x94snow-white ladies\xe2\x80\x99-smocks, the toothwort,\r\napproximating to human flesh, the enchanter\xe2\x80\x99s night-shade, and the\r\nblack-petaled doleful-bells, were among the quainter objects of the\r\nvegetable world in and about Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of\r\nthe animal, the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the\r\nmaster-shearer; the second and third shearers, who travelled in the\r\nexercise of their calling, and do not require definition by name;\r\nHenery Fray the fourth shearer, Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband the fifth, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass the sixth, young Cain Ball as assistant-shearer, and Gabriel\r\nOak as general supervisor. None of these were clothed to any extent\r\nworth mentioning, each appearing to have hit in the matter of raiment\r\nthe decent mean between a high and low caste Hindoo. An angularity of\r\nlineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general, proclaimed that\r\nserious work was the order of the day.\r\n\r\nThey sheared in the great barn, called for the nonce the Shearing-barn,\r\nwhich on ground-plan resembled a church with transepts. It not only\r\nemulated the form of the neighbouring church of the parish, but vied\r\nwith it in antiquity. Whether the barn had ever formed one of a group\r\nof conventual buildings nobody seemed to be aware; no trace of such\r\nsurroundings remained. The vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to\r\nadmit a waggon laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were\r\nspanned by heavy-pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut, whose\r\nvery simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not apparent in erections\r\nwhere more ornament has been attempted. The dusky, filmed, chestnut\r\nroof, braced and tied in by huge collars, curves, and diagonals, was\r\nfar nobler in design, because more wealthy in material, than\r\nnine-tenths of those in our modern churches. Along each side wall was a\r\nrange of striding buttresses, throwing deep shadows on the spaces\r\nbetween them, which were perforated by lancet openings, combining in\r\ntheir proportions the precise requirements both of beauty and\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nOne could say about this barn, what could hardly be said of either the\r\nchurch or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the purpose\r\nwhich had dictated its original erection was the same with that to\r\nwhich it was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of those two\r\ntypical remnants of medi\xc3\xa6valism, the old barn embodied practices which\r\nhad suffered no mutilation at the hands of time. Here at least the\r\nspirit of the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern\r\nbeholder. Standing before this abraded pile, the eye regarded its\r\npresent usage, the mind dwelt upon its past history, with a satisfied\r\nsense of functional continuity throughout\xe2\x80\x94a feeling almost of\r\ngratitude, and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea which had\r\nheaped it up. The fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be\r\nfounded on a mistake, inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given\r\nrise to any reaction that had battered it down, invested this simple\r\ngrey effort of old minds with a repose, if not a grandeur, which a too\r\ncurious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and\r\nmilitary compeers. For once medi\xc3\xa6valism and modernism had a common\r\nstand-point. The lanceolate windows, the time-eaten archstones and\r\nchamfers, the orientation of the axis, the misty chestnut work of the\r\nrafters, referred to no exploded fortifying art or worn-out religious\r\ncreed. The defence and salvation of the body by daily bread is still a\r\nstudy, a religion, and a desire.\r\n\r\nTo-day the large side doors were thrown open towards the sun to admit a\r\nbountiful light to the immediate spot of the shearers\xe2\x80\x99 operations,\r\nwhich was the wood threshing-floor in the centre, formed of thick oak,\r\nblack with age and polished by the beating of flails for many\r\ngenerations, till it had grown as slippery and as rich in hue as the\r\nstate-room floors of an Elizabethan mansion. Here the shearers knelt,\r\nthe sun slanting in upon their bleached shirts, tanned arms, and the\r\npolished shears they flourished, causing these to bristle with a\r\nthousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man. Beneath them a\r\ncaptive sheep lay panting, quickening its pants as misgiving merged in\r\nterror, till it quivered like the hot landscape outside.\r\n\r\nThis picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred years ago did not\r\nproduce that marked contrast between ancient and modern which is\r\nimplied by the contrast of date. In comparison with cities, Weatherbury\r\nwas immutable. The citizen\xe2\x80\x99s _Then_ is the rustic\xe2\x80\x99s _Now_. In London,\r\ntwenty or thirty-years ago are old times; in Paris ten years, or five;\r\nin Weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere\r\npresent, and nothing less than a century set a mark on its face or\r\ntone. Five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter, the embroidery\r\nof a smock-frock, by the breadth of a hair. Ten generations failed to\r\nalter the turn of a single phrase. In these Wessex nooks the busy\r\noutsider\xe2\x80\x99s ancient times are only old; his old times are still new; his\r\npresent is futurity.\r\n\r\nSo the barn was natural to the shearers, and the shearers were in\r\nharmony with the barn.\r\n\r\nThe spacious ends of the building, answering ecclesiastically to nave\r\nand chancel extremities, were fenced off with hurdles, the sheep being\r\nall collected in a crowd within these two enclosures; and in one angle\r\na catching-pen was formed, in which three or four sheep were\r\ncontinuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without loss of time.\r\nIn the background, mellowed by tawny shade, were the three women,\r\nMaryann Money, and Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering up the\r\nfleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying them round.\r\nThey were indifferently well assisted by the old maltster, who, when\r\nthe malting season from October to April had passed, made himself\r\nuseful upon any of the bordering farmsteads.\r\n\r\nBehind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that there\r\nwas no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the animals\r\nwere shorn close. Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her bright\r\neyes like a moth, did not shear continuously, half his time being spent\r\nin attending to the others and selecting the sheep for them. At the\r\npresent moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of mild liquor,\r\nsupplied from a barrel in the corner, and cut pieces of bread and\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and lecturing\r\none of the younger operators who had allowed his last finished sheep to\r\ngo off among the flock without re-stamping it with her initials, came\r\nagain to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to drag a frightened ewe\r\nto his shear-station, flinging it over upon its back with a dexterous\r\ntwist of the arm. He lopped off the tresses about its head, and opened\r\nup the neck and collar, his mistress quietly looking on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe blushes at the insult,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Bathsheba, watching the pink\r\nflush which arose and overspread the neck and shoulders of the ewe\r\nwhere they were left bare by the clicking shears\xe2\x80\x94a flush which was\r\nenviable, for its delicacy, by many queens of coteries, and would have\r\nbeen creditable, for its promptness, to any woman in the world.\r\n\r\nPoor Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s soul was fed with a luxury of content by having her over\r\nhim, her eyes critically regarding his skilful shears, which apparently\r\nwere going to gather up a piece of the flesh at every close, and yet\r\nnever did so. Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in that he was not over\r\nhappy. He had no wish to converse with her: that his bright lady and\r\nhimself formed one group, exclusively their own, and containing no\r\nothers in the world, was enough.\r\n\r\nSo the chatter was all on her side. There is a loquacity that tells\r\nnothing, which was Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s; and there is a silence which says much:\r\nthat was Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s. Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he went on to\r\nfling the ewe over upon her other side, covering her head with his\r\nknee, gradually running the shears line after line round her dewlap;\r\nthence about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done, and done quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, looking at her watch as\r\nthe last snip resounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, wiping his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree-and-twenty minutes and a half since you took the first lock from\r\nits forehead. It is the first time that I have ever seen one done in\r\nless than half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clean, sleek creature arose from its fleece\xe2\x80\x94how perfectly like\r\nAphrodite rising from the foam should have been seen to be\r\nrealized\xe2\x80\x94looking startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which lay\r\non the floor in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion visible\r\nbeing the inner surface only, which, never before exposed, was white as\r\nsnow, and without flaw or blemish of the minutest kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain Ball!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mister Oak; here I be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCainy now runs forward with the tar-pot. \xe2\x80\x9cB. E.\xe2\x80\x9d is newly stamped upon\r\nthe shorn skin, and away the simple dam leaps, panting, over the board\r\ninto the shirtless flock outside. Then up comes Maryann; throws the\r\nloose locks into the middle of the fleece, rolls it up, and carries it\r\ninto the background as three-and-a-half pounds of unadulterated warmth\r\nfor the winter enjoyment of persons unknown and far away, who will,\r\nhowever, never experience the superlative comfort derivable from the\r\nwool as it here exists, new and pure\xe2\x80\x94before the unctuousness of its\r\nnature whilst in a living state has dried, stiffened, and been washed\r\nout\xe2\x80\x94rendering it just now as superior to anything _woollen_ as cream is\r\nsuperior to milk-and-water.\r\n\r\nBut heartless circumstance could not leave entire Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s happiness\r\nof this morning. The rams, old ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly\r\nundergone their stripping, and the men were proceeding with the\r\nshearlings and hogs, when Oak\xe2\x80\x99s belief that she was going to stand\r\npleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully\r\ninterrupted by Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in the extremest corner of\r\nthe barn. Nobody seemed to have perceived his entry, but there he\r\ncertainly was. Boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere of\r\nhis own, which everybody felt who came near him; and the talk, which\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\nHe crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to greet him with a\r\ncarriage of perfect ease. He spoke to her in low tones, and she\r\ninstinctively modulated her own to the same pitch, and her voice\r\nultimately even caught the inflection of his. She was far from having a\r\nwish to appear mysteriously connected with him; but woman at the\r\nimpressionable age gravitates to the larger body not only in her choice\r\nof words, which is apparent every day, but even in her shades of tone\r\nand humour, when the influence is great.\r\n\r\nWhat they conversed about was not audible to Gabriel, who was too\r\nindependent to get near, though too concerned to disregard. The issue\r\nof their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer to\r\nhelp her over the spreading-board into the bright June sunlight\r\noutside. Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went on talking\r\nagain. Concerning the flock? Apparently not. Gabriel theorized, not\r\nwithout truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter within reach of\r\nthe speakers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, these are usually fixed upon it. Bathsheba demurely\r\nregarded a contemptible straw lying upon the ground, in a way which\r\nsuggested less ovine criticism than womanly embarrassment. She became\r\nmore or less red in the cheek, the blood wavering in uncertain flux and\r\nreflux over the sensitive space between ebb and flood. Gabriel sheared\r\non, constrained and sad.\r\n\r\nShe left Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s side, and he walked up and down alone for nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour. Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of\r\nmyrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit;\r\nand young Bob Coggan led on her mare, Boldwood fetching his own horse\r\nfrom the tree under which it had been tied.\r\n\r\nOak\xe2\x80\x99s eyes could not forsake them; and in endeavouring to continue his\r\nshearing at the same time that he watched Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s manner, he snipped\r\nthe sheep in the groin. The animal plunged; Bathsheba instantly gazed\r\ntowards it, and saw the blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gabriel!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with severe remonstrance, \xe2\x80\x9cyou who are so\r\nstrict with the other men\xe2\x80\x94see what you are doing yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo an outsider there was not much to complain of in this remark; but to\r\nOak, who knew Bathsheba to be well aware that she herself was the cause\r\nof the poor ewe\xe2\x80\x99s wound, because she had wounded the ewe\xe2\x80\x99s shearer in a\r\nstill more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding sense of his\r\ninferiority to both herself and Boldwood was not calculated to heal.\r\nBut a manly resolve to recognize boldly that he had no longer a lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in her, helped him occasionally to conceal a feeling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBottle!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine. Cainy Ball ran\r\nup, the wound was anointed, and the shearing continued.\r\n\r\nBoldwood gently tossed Bathsheba into the saddle, and before they\r\nturned away she again spoke out to Oak with the same dominative and\r\ntantalizing graciousness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going now to see Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s Leicesters. Take my place in the\r\nbarn, Gabriel, and keep the men carefully to their work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads were put about, and they trotted away.\r\n\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s deep attachment was a matter of great interest among all\r\naround him; but, after having been pointed out for so many years as the\r\nperfect exemplar of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an anticlimax\r\nsomewhat resembling that of St. John Long\xe2\x80\x99s death by consumption in the\r\nmidst of his proofs that it was not a fatal disease.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means matrimony,\xe2\x80\x9d said Temperance Miller, following them out of\r\nsight with her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon that\xe2\x80\x99s the size o\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, working along without\r\nlooking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, better wed over the mixen than over the moor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laban Tall,\r\nturning his sheep.\r\n\r\nHenery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the same time: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee why a maid should take a husband when she\xe2\x80\x99s bold enough to fight\r\nher own battles, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want a home; for \xe2\x80\x99tis keeping another woman\r\nout. But let it be, for \xe2\x80\x99tis a pity he and she should trouble two\r\nhouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invariably provoked the\r\ncriticism of individuals like Henery Fray. Her emblazoned fault was to\r\nbe too pronounced in her objections, and not sufficiently overt in her\r\nlikings. We learn that it is not the rays which bodies absorb, but\r\nthose which they reject, that give them the colours they are known by;\r\nand in the same way people are specialized by their dislikes and\r\nantagonisms, whilst their goodwill is looked upon as no attribute at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHenery continued in a more complaisant mood: \xe2\x80\x9cI once hinted my mind to\r\nher on a few things, as nearly as a battered frame dared to do so to\r\nsuch a froward piece. You all know, neighbours, what a man I be, and\r\nhow I come down with my powerful words when my pride is boiling wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nscarn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do, we do, Henery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I said, \xe2\x80\x98Mistress Everdene, there\xe2\x80\x99s places empty, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngifted men willing; but the spite\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94no, not the spite\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nspite\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98but the villainy of the contrarikind,\xe2\x80\x99 I said (meaning\r\nwomankind), \xe2\x80\x98keeps \xe2\x80\x99em out.\xe2\x80\x99 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too strong for her, say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassably well put.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I would have said it, had death and salvation overtook me for\r\nit. Such is my spirit when I have a mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA true man, and proud as a lucifer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the artfulness? Why, \xe2\x80\x99twas about being baily really; but I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t put it so plain that she could understand my meaning, so I could\r\nlay it on all the stronger. That was my depth!... However, let her\r\nmarry an she will. Perhaps \xe2\x80\x99tis high time. I believe Farmer Boldwood\r\nkissed her behind the spear-bed at the sheep-washing t\xe2\x80\x99other day\xe2\x80\x94that I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, neighbour Oak\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99st know?\xe2\x80\x9d said, Henery, mildly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she told me all that passed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, with a pharisaical\r\nsense that he was not as other shearers in this matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have a right to believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Henery, with dudgeon; \xe2\x80\x9ca very\r\ntrue right. But I mid see a little distance into things! To be\r\nlong-headed enough for a baily\xe2\x80\x99s place is a poor mere trifle\xe2\x80\x94yet a\r\ntrifle more than nothing. However, I look round upon life quite cool.\r\nDo you heed me, neighbours? My words, though made as simple as I can,\r\nmid be rather deep for some heads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, Henery, we quite heed ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange old piece, goodmen\xe2\x80\x94whirled about from here to yonder, as if\r\nI were nothing! A little warped, too. But I have my depths; ha, and\r\neven my great depths! I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to\r\nbrain. But no\xe2\x80\x94O no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange old piece, ye say!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the maltster, in a querulous\r\nvoice. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time ye be no old man worth naming\xe2\x80\x94no old man at\r\nall. Yer teeth bain\xe2\x80\x99t half gone yet; and what\xe2\x80\x99s a old man\xe2\x80\x99s standing if\r\nso be his teeth bain\xe2\x80\x99t gone? Weren\xe2\x80\x99t I stale in wedlock afore ye were\r\nout of arms? \xe2\x80\x99Tis a poor thing to be sixty, when there\xe2\x80\x99s people far\r\npast four-score\xe2\x80\x94a boast weak as water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the unvarying custom in Weatherbury to sink minor differences\r\nwhen the maltster had to be pacified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeak as water! yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cMalter, we feel ye to be a\r\nwonderful veteran man, and nobody can gainsay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cYe be a very rare old spectacle,\r\nmalter, and we all admire ye for that gift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and as a young man, when my senses were in prosperity, I was\r\nlikewise liked by a good-few who knowed me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the maltster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Ithout doubt you was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99ithout doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bent and hoary man was satisfied, and so apparently was Henery\r\nFray. That matters should continue pleasant Maryann spoke, who, what\r\nwith her brown complexion, and the working wrapper of rusty linsey, had\r\nat present the mellow hue of an old sketch in oils\xe2\x80\x94notably some of\r\nNicholas Poussin\xe2\x80\x99s:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo anybody know of a crooked man, or a lame, or any second-hand fellow\r\nat all that would do for poor me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann. \xe2\x80\x9cA perfect one I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect to get at my time of life. If I could hear of such a thing\r\n\xe2\x80\x99twould do me more good than toast and ale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoggan furnished a suitable reply. Oak went on with his shearing, and\r\nsaid not another word. Pestilent moods had come, and teased away his\r\nquiet. Bathsheba had shown indications of anointing him above his\r\nfellows by installing him as the bailiff that the farm imperatively\r\nrequired. He did not covet the post relatively to the farm: in relation\r\nto herself, as beloved by him and unmarried to another, he had coveted\r\nit. His readings of her seemed now to be vapoury and indistinct. His\r\nlecture to her was, he thought, one of the absurdest mistakes. Far from\r\ncoquetting with Boldwood, she had trifled with himself in thus feigning\r\nthat she had trifled with another. He was inwardly convinced that, in\r\naccordance with the anticipations of his easy-going and worse-educated\r\ncomrades, that day would see Boldwood the accepted husband of Miss\r\nEverdene. Gabriel at this time of his life had out-grown the\r\ninstinctive dislike which every Christian boy has for reading the\r\nBible, perusing it now quite frequently, and he inwardly said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I find\r\nmore bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nwas mere exclamation\xe2\x80\x94the froth of the storm. He adored Bathsheba just\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe workfolk shall have some lordly junketing to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cainy\r\nBall, casting forth his thoughts in a new direction. \xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I\r\nsee \xe2\x80\x99em making the great puddens in the milking-pails\xe2\x80\x94lumps of fat as\r\nbig as yer thumb, Mister Oak! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seed such splendid large knobs\r\nof fat before in the days of my life\xe2\x80\x94they never used to be bigger then\r\na horse-bean. And there was a great black crock upon the brandish with\r\nhis legs a-sticking out, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what was in within.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s two bushels of biffins for apple-pies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope to do my duty by it all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass, in a\r\npleasant, masticating manner of anticipation. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; victuals and drink\r\nis a cheerful thing, and gives nerves to the nerveless, if the form of\r\nwords may be used. \xe2\x80\x99Tis the gospel of the body, without which we\r\nperish, so to speak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\nEVENTIDE\xe2\x80\x94A SECOND DECLARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the grass-plot\r\nbeside the house, the end of the table being thrust over the sill of\r\nthe wide parlour window and a foot or two into the room. Miss Everdene\r\nsat inside the window, facing down the table. She was thus at the head\r\nwithout mingling with the men.\r\n\r\nThis evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her red cheeks and lips\r\ncontrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair. She\r\nseemed to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table\r\nwas at her request left vacant until after they had begun the meal. She\r\nthen asked Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining to\r\nthat end, which he did with great readiness.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the green\r\nto Bathsheba at the window. He apologized for his lateness: his arrival\r\nwas evidently by arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you move again, please, and let Mr. Boldwood\r\ncome there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak moved in silence back to his original seat.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat and\r\nwhite waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey.\r\nInwardy, too, he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional\r\ndegree. So also was Bathsheba now that he had come, though the\r\nuninvited presence of Pennyways, the bailiff who had been dismissed for\r\ntheft, disturbed her equanimity for a while.\r\n\r\nSupper being ended, Coggan began on his own private account, without\r\nreference to listeners:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my love, and I care not,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my love, and I care not;\r\n    I shall soon have another\r\n    That\xe2\x80\x99s better than t\xe2\x80\x99other;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my love, and I care not.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lyric, when concluded, was received with a silently appreciative\r\ngaze at the table, implying that the performance, like a work by those\r\nestablished authors who are independent of notices in the papers, was a\r\nwell-known delight which required no applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Master Poorgrass, your song!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI be all but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph,\r\ndiminishing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense; wou\xe2\x80\x99st never be so ungrateful, Joseph\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan,\r\nexpressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mistress is\r\nlooking hard at ye, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98Sing at once, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, so she is; well, I must suffer it!... Just eye my features, and\r\nsee if the tell-tale blood overheats me much, neighbours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, yer blushes be quite reasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty\xe2\x80\x99s eyes get\r\nfixed on me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph, differently; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if so be \xe2\x80\x99tis willed they\r\ndo, they must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joseph, your song, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, from the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, in a yielding tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to say. It would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the supper-party.\r\n\r\nPoorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth a flickering yet commendable\r\npiece of sentiment, the tune of which consisted of the key-note and\r\nanother, the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon. This was so\r\nsuccessful that he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath,\r\nafter a few false starts:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI sow\xe2\x80\xb2-ed th\xe2\x80\xb2-e.....\r\nI sow\xe2\x80\xb2-ed.....\r\nI sow\xe2\x80\xb2-ed th\xe2\x80\xb2-e seeds\xe2\x80\xb2 of\xe2\x80\xb2 love\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\n    I-it was\xe2\x80\xb2 all\xe2\x80\xb2 i\xe2\x80\xb2-in the\xe2\x80\xb2-e spring\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nI-in A\xe2\x80\xb2-pril\xe2\x80\xb2, Ma\xe2\x80\xb2-ay, a\xe2\x80\xb2-nd sun\xe2\x80\xb2-ny\xe2\x80\xb2 June\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\n    When sma\xe2\x80\xb2-all bi\xe2\x80\xb2-irds they\xe2\x80\xb2 do\xe2\x80\xb2 sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell put out of hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, at the end of the verse. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98They do\r\nsing\xe2\x80\x99 was a very taking paragraph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy; and there was a pretty place at \xe2\x80\x98seeds of love.\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x99twas well\r\nheaved out. Though \xe2\x80\x98love\xe2\x80\x99 is a nasty high corner when a man\xe2\x80\x99s voice is\r\ngetting crazed. Next verse, Master Poorgrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut during this rendering young Bob Coggan exhibited one of those\r\nanomalies which will afflict little people when other persons are\r\nparticularly serious: in trying to check his laughter, he pushed down\r\nhis throat as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,\r\nafter continuing hermetically sealed for a short time, his mirth burst\r\nout through his nose. Joseph perceived it, and with hectic cheeks of\r\nindignation instantly ceased singing. Coggan boxed Bob\xe2\x80\x99s ears\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Joseph\xe2\x80\x94go on, and never mind the young scamp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a very catching ballet. Now then again\xe2\x80\x94the next bar; I\xe2\x80\x99ll help ye\r\nto flourish up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOh the wi\xe2\x80\xb2-il-lo\xe2\x80\xb2-ow tree\xe2\x80\xb2 will\xe2\x80\xb2 twist\xe2\x80\xb2,\r\nAnd the wil\xe2\x80\xb2-low\xe2\x80\xb2 tre\xe2\x80\xb2-ee wi\xe2\x80\xb2-ill twine\xe2\x80\xb2.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the singer could not be set going again. Bob Coggan was sent home\r\nfor his ill manners, and tranquility was restored by Jacob Smallbury,\r\nwho volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with\r\nwhich the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion the\r\nswains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs of his day.\r\n\r\nIt was still the beaming time of evening, though night was stealthily\r\nmaking itself visible low down upon the ground, the western lines of\r\nlight raking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent, or\r\nilluminating the dead levels at all. The sun had crept round the tree\r\nas a last effort before death, and then began to sink, the shearers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlower parts becoming steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst their heads\r\nand shoulders were still enjoying day, touched with a yellow of\r\nself-sustained brilliancy that seemed inherent rather than acquired.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they sat, and talked on, and\r\ngrew as merry as the gods in Homer\xe2\x80\x99s heaven. Bathsheba still remained\r\nenthroned inside the window, and occupied herself in knitting, from\r\nwhich she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene outside. The\r\nslow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely before the signs\r\nof moving were shown.\r\n\r\nGabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom of\r\nthe table. How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he had\r\napparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk. Whilst he was thinking\r\nof this, Liddy brought candles into the back part of the room\r\noverlooking the shearers, and their lively new flames shone down the\r\ntable and over the men, and dispersed among the green shadows behind.\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s form, still in its original position, was now again\r\ndistinct between their eyes and the light, which revealed that Boldwood\r\nhad gone inside the room, and was sitting near her.\r\n\r\nNext came the question of the evening. Would Miss Everdene sing to them\r\nthe song she always sang so charmingly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Banks of Allan\r\nWater\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94before they went home?\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to\r\nGabriel, who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought your flute?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlay to my singing, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood up in the window-opening, facing the men, the candles behind\r\nher, Gabriel on her right hand, immediately outside the sash-frame.\r\nBoldwood had drawn up on her left, within the room. Her singing was\r\nsoft and rather tremulous at first, but it soon swelled to a steady\r\nclearness. Subsequent events caused one of the verses to be remembered\r\nfor many months, and even years, by more than one of those who were\r\ngathered there:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFor his bride a soldier sought her,\r\n    And a winning tongue had he:\r\nOn the banks of Allan Water\r\n    None was gay as she!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s flute, Boldwood supplied\r\na bass in his customary profound voice, uttering his notes so softly,\r\nhowever, as to abstain entirely from making anything like an ordinary\r\nduet of the song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow, which\r\nthrew her tones into relief. The shearers reclined against each other\r\nas at suppers in the early ages of the world, and so silent and\r\nabsorbed were they that her breathing could almost be heard between the\r\nbars; and at the end of the ballad, when the last tone loitered on to\r\nan inexpressible close, there arose that buzz of pleasure which is the\r\nattar of applause.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could not avoid noting\r\nthe farmer\xe2\x80\x99s bearing to-night towards their entertainer. Yet there was\r\nnothing exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to his time\r\nof performing them. It was when the rest were all looking away that\r\nBoldwood observed her; when they regarded her he turned aside; when\r\nthey thanked or praised he was silent; when they were inattentive he\r\nmurmured his thanks. The meaning lay in the difference between actions,\r\nnone of which had any meaning of itself; and the necessity of being\r\njealous, which lovers are troubled with, did not lead Oak to\r\nunderestimate these signs.\r\n\r\nBathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew from the window, and\r\nretired to the back part of the room, Boldwood thereupon closing the\r\nsash and the shutters, and remaining inside with her. Oak wandered away\r\nunder the quiet and scented trees. Recovering from the softer\r\nimpressions produced by Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s voice, the shearers rose to leave,\r\nCoggan turning to Pennyways as he pushed back the bench to pass out:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like to give praise where praise is due, and the man deserves\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x99a do so,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, looking at the worthy thief, as if he\r\nwere the masterpiece of some world-renowned artist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I should never have believed it if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t proved it, so to\r\nallude,\xe2\x80\x9d hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass, \xe2\x80\x9cthat every cup, every one of the\r\nbest knives and forks, and every empty bottle be in their place as\r\nperfect now as at the beginning, and not one stole at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve half the praise you give me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nvirtuous thief, grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this for Pennyways,\xe2\x80\x9d added Coggan, \xe2\x80\x9cthat whenever he do\r\nreally make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good\r\naction, as I could see by his face he did to-night afore sitting down,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s generally able to carry it out. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say, neighbours,\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s stole nothing at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it, Pennyways,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoseph; to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nAt this time of departure, when nothing more was visible of the inside\r\nof the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between the\r\nshutters, a passionate scene was in course of enactment there.\r\n\r\nMiss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her cheeks had lost a great deal\r\nof their healthful fire from the very seriousness of her position; but\r\nher eye was bright with the excitement of a triumph\xe2\x80\x94though it was a\r\ntriumph which had rather been contemplated than desired.\r\n\r\nShe was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which she had just risen,\r\nand he was kneeling in it\xe2\x80\x94inclining himself over its back towards her,\r\nand holding her hand in both his own. His body moved restlessly, and it\r\nwas with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness. This unwonted\r\nabstraction by love of all dignity from a man of whom it had ever\r\nseemed the chief component, was, in its distressing incongruity, a pain\r\nto her which quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the proof\r\nthat she was idolized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try to love you,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying, in a trembling voice quite\r\nunlike her usual self-confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if I can believe in any way that\r\nI shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you.\r\nBut, Mr. Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable in any\r\nwoman, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give a solemn promise to-night. I would\r\nrather ask you to wait a few weeks till I can see my situation better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have every reason to believe that _then_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or six weeks,\r\nbetween this time and harvest, that you say you are going to be away\r\nfrom home, I shall be able to promise to be your wife,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nfirmly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut remember this distinctly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t promise yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough; I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask more. I can wait on those dear words. And\r\nnow, Miss Everdene, good-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, graciously\xe2\x80\x94almost tenderly; and Boldwood\r\nwithdrew with a serene smile.\r\n\r\nBathsheba knew more of him now; he had entirely bared his heart before\r\nher, even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a\r\ngrand bird without the feathers that make it grand. She had been\r\nawe-struck at her past temerity, and was struggling to make amends\r\nwithout thinking whether the sin quite deserved the penalty she was\r\nschooling herself to pay. To have brought all this about her ears was\r\nterrible; but after a while the situation was not without a fearful\r\njoy. The facility with which even the most timid women sometimes\r\nacquire a relish for the dreadful when that is amalgamated with a\r\nlittle triumph, is marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\nTHE SAME NIGHT\xe2\x80\x94THE FIR PLANTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had voluntarily imposed\r\nupon herself by dispensing with the services of a bailiff, was the\r\nparticular one of looking round the homestead before going to bed, to\r\nsee that all was right and safe for the night. Gabriel had almost\r\nconstantly preceded her in this tour every evening, watching her\r\naffairs as carefully as any specially appointed officer of surveillance\r\ncould have done; but this tender devotion was to a great extent unknown\r\nto his mistress, and as much as was known was somewhat thanklessly\r\nreceived. Women are never tired of bewailing man\xe2\x80\x99s fickleness in love,\r\nbut they only seem to snub his constancy.\r\n\r\nAs watching is best done invisibly, she usually carried a dark lantern\r\nin her hand, and every now and then turned on the light to examine\r\nnooks and corners with the coolness of a metropolitan policeman. This\r\ncoolness may have owed its existence not so much to her fearlessness of\r\nexpected danger as to her freedom from the suspicion of any; her worst\r\nanticipated discovery being that a horse might not be well bedded, the\r\nfowls not all in, or a door not closed.\r\n\r\nThis night the buildings were inspected as usual, and she went round to\r\nthe farm paddock. Here the only sounds disturbing the stillness were\r\nsteady munchings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from all but\r\ninvisible noses, ending in snores and puffs like the blowing of bellows\r\nslowly. Then the munching would recommence, when the lively imagination\r\nmight assist the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils, shaped\r\nas caverns, and very clammy and humid on their surfaces, not exactly\r\npleasant to the touch until one got used to them; the mouths beneath\r\nhaving a great partiality for closing upon any loose end of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napparel which came within reach of their tongues. Above each of these a\r\nstill keener vision suggested a brown forehead and two staring though\r\nnot unfriendly eyes, and above all a pair of whitish crescent-shaped\r\nhorns like two particularly new moons, an occasional stolid \xe2\x80\x9cmoo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nproclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt that these phenomena were the\r\nfeatures and persons of Daisy, Whitefoot, Bonny-lass, Jolly-O, Spot,\r\nTwinkle-eye, etc., etc.\xe2\x80\x94the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging\r\nto Bathsheba aforesaid.\r\n\r\nHer way back to the house was by a path through a young plantation of\r\ntapering firs, which had been planted some years earlier to shelter the\r\npremises from the north wind. By reason of the density of the\r\ninterwoven foliage overhead, it was gloomy there at cloudless noontide,\r\ntwilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and black as the\r\nninth plague of Egypt at midnight. To describe the spot is to call it a\r\nvast, low, naturally formed hall, the plumy ceiling of which was\r\nsupported by slender pillars of living wood, the floor being covered\r\nwith a soft dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with a\r\ntuft of grass-blades here and there.\r\n\r\nThis bit of the path was always the crux of the night\xe2\x80\x99s ramble, though,\r\nbefore starting, her apprehensions of danger were not vivid enough to\r\nlead her to take a companion. Slipping along here covertly as Time,\r\nBathsheba fancied she could hear footsteps entering the track at the\r\nopposite end. It was certainly a rustle of footsteps. Her own instantly\r\nfell as gently as snowflakes. She reassured herself by a remembrance\r\nthat the path was public, and that the traveller was probably some\r\nvillager returning home; regretting, at the same time, that the meeting\r\nshould be about to occur in the darkest point of her route, even though\r\nonly just outside her own door.\r\n\r\nThe noise approached, came close, and a figure was apparently on the\r\npoint of gliding past her when something tugged at her skirt and pinned\r\nit forcibly to the ground. The instantaneous check nearly threw\r\nBathsheba off her balance. In recovering she struck against warm\r\nclothes and buttons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rum start, upon my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said a masculine voice, a foot or so above\r\nher head. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I hurt you, mate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have got hitched together somehow, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lady, I should have said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a dark lantern you have? I fancy so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me I\xe2\x80\x99ll open it, and set you free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the rays burst out from\r\ntheir prison, and Bathsheba beheld her position with astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scarlet. He\r\nwas a soldier. His sudden appearance was to darkness what the sound of\r\na trumpet is to silence. Gloom, the _genius loci_ at all times\r\nhitherto, was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern-light than by\r\nwhat the lantern lighted. The contrast of this revelation with her\r\nanticipations of some sinister figure in sombre garb was so great that\r\nit had upon her the effect of a fairy transformation.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately apparent that the military man\xe2\x80\x99s spur had become\r\nentangled in the gimp which decorated the skirt of her dress. He caught\r\na view of her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll unfasten you in one moment, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with new-born\r\ngallantry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I can do it, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastily replied, and stooped for\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nThe unfastening was not such a trifling affair. The rowel of the spur\r\nhad so wound itself among the gimp cords in those few moments, that\r\nseparation was likely to be a matter of time.\r\n\r\nHe too stooped, and the lantern standing on the ground betwixt them\r\nthrew the gleam from its open side among the fir-tree needles and the\r\nblades of long damp grass with the effect of a large glowworm. It\r\nradiated upwards into their faces, and sent over half the plantation\r\ngigantic shadows of both man and woman, each dusky shape becoming\r\ndistorted and mangled upon the tree-trunks till it wasted to nothing.\r\n\r\nHe looked hard into her eyes when she raised them for a moment;\r\nBathsheba looked down again, for his gaze was too strong to be received\r\npoint-blank with her own. But she had obliquely noticed that he was\r\nyoung and slim, and that he wore three chevrons upon his sleeve.\r\n\r\nBathsheba pulled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a prisoner, miss; it is no use blinking the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nsoldier, drily. \xe2\x80\x9cI must cut your dress if you are in such a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94please do!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, helplessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary if you could wait a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d and he unwound a\r\ncord from the little wheel. She withdrew her own hand, but, whether by\r\naccident or design, he touched it. Bathsheba was vexed; she hardly knew\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nHis unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end.\r\nShe looked at him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!\xe2\x80\x9d said the young\r\nsergeant, without ceremony.\r\n\r\nShe coloured with embarrassment. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas unwillingly shown,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, stiffly, and with as much dignity\xe2\x80\x94which was very little\xe2\x80\x94as she\r\ncould infuse into a position of captivity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you the better for that incivility, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have liked\xe2\x80\x94I wish\xe2\x80\x94you had never shown yourself to me by\r\nintruding here!\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled again, and the gathers of her dress began\r\nto give way like liliputian musketry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deserve the chastisement your words give me. But why should such a\r\nfair and dutiful girl have such an aversion to her father\xe2\x80\x99s sex?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on your way, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Beauty, and drag you after me? Do but look; I never saw such a\r\ntangle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, \xe2\x80\x99tis shameful of you; you have been making it worse on purpose to\r\nkeep me here\xe2\x80\x94you have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, with a merry twinkle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you you have!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in high temper. \xe2\x80\x9cI insist upon\r\nundoing it. Now, allow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, miss; I am not of steel.\xe2\x80\x9d He added a sigh which had as much\r\narchness in it as a sigh could possess without losing its nature\r\naltogether. \xe2\x80\x9cI am thankful for beauty, even when \xe2\x80\x99tis thrown to me like\r\na bone to a dog. These moments will be over too soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe closed her lips in a determined silence.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate\r\nrush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily\r\nbehind her. The thought was too dreadful. The dress\xe2\x80\x94which she had put\r\non to appear stately at the supper\xe2\x80\x94was the head and front of her\r\nwardrobe; not another in her stock became her so well. What woman in\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s position, not naturally timid, and within call of her\r\nretainers, would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear a\r\nprice?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive,\xe2\x80\x9d said her cool\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis trifling provokes, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot too cruel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Insults me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done in order that I may have the pleasure of apologizing to so\r\ncharming a woman, which I straightway do most humbly, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nbowing low.\r\n\r\nBathsheba really knew not what to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a good many women in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the young man in a\r\nmurmur, and more thoughtfully than hitherto, critically regarding her\r\nbent head at the same time; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a woman so beautiful\r\nas you. Take it or leave it\xe2\x80\x94be offended or like it\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you, then, who can so well afford to despise opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo stranger. Sergeant Troy. I am staying in this place.\xe2\x80\x94There! it is\r\nundone at last, you see. Your light fingers were more eager than mine.\r\nI wish it had been the knot of knots, which there\xe2\x80\x99s no untying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was worse and worse. She started up, and so did he. How to\r\ndecently get away from him\xe2\x80\x94that was her difficulty now. She sidled off\r\ninch by inch, the lantern in her hand, till she could see the redness\r\nof his coat no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Beauty; good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, and, reaching a distance of twenty or thirty yards,\r\nturned about, and ran indoors.\r\n\r\nLiddy had just retired to rest. In ascending to her own chamber,\r\nBathsheba opened the girl\xe2\x80\x99s door an inch or two, and, panting, said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy, is any soldier staying in the village\xe2\x80\x94sergeant somebody\xe2\x80\x94rather\r\ngentlemanly for a sergeant, and good looking\xe2\x80\x94a red coat with blue\r\nfacings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss.... No, I say; but really it might be Sergeant Troy home on\r\nfurlough, though I have not seen him. He was here once in that way when\r\nthe regiment was at Casterbridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s the name. Had he a moustache\xe2\x80\x94no whiskers or beard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a person is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! miss\xe2\x80\x94I blush to name it\xe2\x80\x94a gay man! But I know him to be very quick\r\nand trim, who might have made his thousands, like a squire. Such a\r\nclever young dandy as he is! He\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s son by name, which is a\r\ngreat deal; and he\xe2\x80\x99s an earl\xe2\x80\x99s son by nature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is a great deal more. Fancy! Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And, he was brought up so well, and sent to Casterbridge Grammar\r\nSchool for years and years. Learnt all languages while he was there;\r\nand it was said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese in\r\nshorthand; but that I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer for, as it was only reported.\r\nHowever, he wasted his gifted lot, and listed a soldier; but even then\r\nhe rose to be a sergeant without trying at all. Ah! such a blessing it\r\nis to be high-born; nobility of blood will shine out even in the ranks\r\nand files. And is he really come home, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so. Good-night, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter all, how could a cheerful wearer of skirts be permanently\r\noffended with the man? There are occasions when girls like Bathsheba\r\nwill put up with a great deal of unconventional behaviour. When they\r\nwant to be praised, which is often, when they want to be mastered,\r\nwhich is sometimes; and when they want no nonsense, which is seldom.\r\nJust now the first feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a\r\ndash of the second. Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the ministrant\r\nwas antecedently made interesting by being a handsome stranger who had\r\nevidently seen better days.\r\n\r\nSo she could not clearly decide whether it was her opinion that he had\r\ninsulted her or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas ever anything so odd!\xe2\x80\x9d she at last exclaimed to herself, in her\r\nown room. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd was ever anything so meanly done as what I did\xe2\x80\x94to skulk\r\naway like that from a man who was only civil and kind!\xe2\x80\x9d Clearly she did\r\nnot think his barefaced praise of her person an insult now.\r\n\r\nIt was a fatal omission of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s that he had never once told her\r\nshe was beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\nTHE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED\r\n\r\n\r\nIdiosyncrasy and vicissitude had combined to stamp Sergeant Troy as an\r\nexceptional being.\r\n\r\nHe was a man to whom memories were an incumbrance, and anticipations a\r\nsuperfluity. Simply feeling, considering, and caring for what was\r\nbefore his eyes, he was vulnerable only in the present. His outlook\r\nupon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then: that\r\nprojection of consciousness into days gone by and to come, which makes\r\nthe past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word for\r\ncircumspection, was foreign to Troy. With him the past was yesterday;\r\nthe future, to-morrow; never, the day after.\r\n\r\nOn this account he might, in certain lights, have been regarded as one\r\nof the most fortunate of his order. For it may be argued with great\r\nplausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a disease, and\r\nthat expectation in its only comfortable form\xe2\x80\x94that of absolute faith\xe2\x80\x94is\r\npractically an impossibility; whilst in the form of hope and the\r\nsecondary compounds, patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a\r\nconstant fluctuation between pleasure and pain.\r\n\r\nSergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the practice of expectation,\r\nwas never disappointed. To set against this negative gain there may\r\nhave been some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the higher\r\ntastes and sensations which it entailed. But limitation of the capacity\r\nis never recognized as a loss by the loser therefrom: in this attribute\r\nmoral or \xc3\xa6sthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, since\r\nthose who suffer do not mind it, whilst those who mind it soon cease to\r\nsuffer. It is not a denial of anything to have been always without it,\r\nand what Troy had never enjoyed he did not miss; but, being fully\r\nconscious that what sober people missed he enjoyed, his capacity,\r\nthough really less, seemed greater than theirs.\r\n\r\nHe was moderately truthful towards men, but to women lied like a\r\nCretan\xe2\x80\x94a system of ethics above all others calculated to win popularity\r\nat the first flush of admission into lively society; and the\r\npossibility of the favour gained being transitory had reference only to\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nHe never passed the line which divides the spruce vices from the ugly;\r\nand hence, though his morals had hardly been applauded, disapproval of\r\nthem had frequently been tempered with a smile. This treatment had led\r\nto his becoming a sort of regrater of other men\xe2\x80\x99s gallantries, to his\r\nown aggrandizement as a Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of\r\nhis hearers.\r\n\r\nHis reason and his propensities had seldom any reciprocating influence,\r\nhaving separated by mutual consent long ago: thence it sometimes\r\nhappened that, while his intentions were as honourable as could be\r\nwished, any particular deed formed a dark background which threw them\r\ninto fine relief. The sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s vicious phases being the offspring of\r\nimpulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter had a\r\nmodest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen.\r\n\r\nTroy was full of activity, but his activities were less of a locomotive\r\nthan a vegetative nature; and, never being based upon any original\r\nchoice of foundation or direction, they were exercised on whatever\r\nobject chance might place in their way. Hence, whilst he sometimes\r\nreached the brilliant in speech because that was spontaneous, he fell\r\nbelow the commonplace in action, from inability to guide incipient\r\neffort. He had a quick comprehension and considerable force of\r\ncharacter; but, being without the power to combine them, the\r\ncomprehension became engaged with trivialities whilst waiting for the\r\nwill to direct it, and the force wasted itself in useless grooves\r\nthrough unheeding the comprehension.\r\n\r\nHe was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle class\xe2\x80\x94exceptionally\r\nwell educated for a common soldier. He spoke fluently and unceasingly.\r\nHe could in this way be one thing and seem another: for instance, he\r\ncould speak of love and think of dinner; call on the husband to look at\r\nthe wife; be eager to pay and intend to owe.\r\n\r\nThe wondrous power of flattery in _passados_ at woman is a perception\r\nso universal as to be remarked upon by many people almost as\r\nautomatically as they repeat a proverb, or say that they are Christians\r\nand the like, without thinking much of the enormous corollaries which\r\nspring from the proposition. Still less is it acted upon for the good\r\nof the complemental being alluded to. With the majority such an opinion\r\nis shelved with all those trite aphorisms which require some\r\ncatastrophe to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home. When\r\nexpressed with some amount of reflectiveness it seems co-ordinate with\r\na belief that this flattery must be reasonable to be effective. It is\r\nto the credit of men that few attempt to settle the question by\r\nexperiment, and it is for their happiness, perhaps, that accident has\r\nnever settled it for them. Nevertheless, that a male dissembler who by\r\ndeluging her with untenable fictions charms the female wisely, may\r\nacquire powers reaching to the extremity of perdition, is a truth\r\ntaught to many by unsought and wringing occurrences. And some profess\r\nto have attained to the same knowledge by experiment as aforesaid, and\r\njauntily continue their indulgence in such experiments with terrible\r\neffect. Sergeant Troy was one.\r\n\r\nHe had been known to observe casually that in dealing with womankind\r\nthe only alternative to flattery was cursing and swearing. There was no\r\nthird method. \xe2\x80\x9cTreat them fairly, and you are a lost man.\xe2\x80\x9d he would\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThis person\xe2\x80\x99s public appearance in Weatherbury promptly followed his\r\narrival there. A week or two after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling a\r\nnameless relief of spirits on account of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s absence, approached\r\nher hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the haymakers. They\r\nconsisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and flexuous forms, the\r\nformer being the men, the latter the women, who wore tilt bonnets\r\ncovered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon their shoulders.\r\nCoggan and Mark Clark were mowing in a less forward meadow, Clark\r\nhumming a tune to the strokes of his scythe, to which Jan made no\r\nattempt to keep time with his. In the first mead they were already\r\nloading hay, the women raking it into cocks and windrows, and the men\r\ntossing it upon the waggon.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the waggon a bright scarlet spot emerged, and went on\r\nloading unconcernedly with the rest. It was the gallant sergeant, who\r\nhad come haymaking for pleasure; and nobody could deny that he was\r\ndoing the mistress of the farm real knight-service by this voluntary\r\ncontribution of his labour at a busy time.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had entered the field Troy saw her, and sticking his\r\npitchfork into the ground and picking up his crop or cane, he came\r\nforward. Bathsheba blushed with half-angry embarrassment, and adjusted\r\nher eyes as well as her feet to the direct line of her path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\nSCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Miss Everdene!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, touching his diminutive cap.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle did I think it was you I was speaking to the other night. And\r\nyet, if I had reflected, the \xe2\x80\x98Queen of the Corn-market\xe2\x80\x99 (truth is truth\r\nat any hour of the day or night, and I heard you so named in\r\nCasterbridge yesterday), the \xe2\x80\x98Queen of the Corn-market.\xe2\x80\x99 I say, could\r\nbe no other woman. I step across now to beg your forgiveness a thousand\r\ntimes for having been led by my feelings to express myself too strongly\r\nfor a stranger. To be sure I am no stranger to the place\xe2\x80\x94I am Sergeant\r\nTroy, as I told you, and I have assisted your uncle in these fields no\r\nend of times when I was a lad. I have been doing the same for you\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must thank you for that, Sergeant Troy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queen of\r\nthe Corn-market, in an indifferently grateful tone.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked hurt and sad. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you must not, Miss Everdene,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy could you think such a thing necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad it is not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? if I may ask without offence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t much want to thank you for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue that my heart will never\r\nmend. O these intolerable times: that ill-luck should follow a man for\r\nhonestly telling a woman she is beautiful! \xe2\x80\x99Twas the most I said\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nmust own that; and the least I could say\xe2\x80\x94that I own myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some talk I could do without more easily than money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed. That remark is a sort of digression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It means that I would rather have your room than your company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I would rather have curses from you than kisses from any other\r\nwoman; so I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba was absolutely speechless. And yet she could not help feeling\r\nthat the assistance he was rendering forbade a harsh repulse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Troy, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there is a praise which is rudeness,\r\nand that may be mine. At the same time there is a treatment which is\r\ninjustice, and that may be yours. Because a plain blunt man, who has\r\nnever been taught concealment, speaks out his mind without exactly\r\nintending it, he\xe2\x80\x99s to be snapped off like the son of a sinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed there\xe2\x80\x99s no such case between us,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning away. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t allow strangers to be bold and impudent\xe2\x80\x94even in praise of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94it is not the fact but the method which offends you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ncarelessly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have the sad satisfaction of knowing that my words,\r\nwhether pleasing or offensive, are unmistakably true. Would you have\r\nhad me look at you, and tell my acquaintance that you are quite a\r\ncommon-place woman, to save you the embarrassment of being stared at if\r\nthey come near you? Not I. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell any such ridiculous lie\r\nabout a beauty to encourage a single woman in England in too excessive\r\na modesty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all pretence\xe2\x80\x94what you are saying!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bathsheba, laughing\r\nin spite of herself at the sly method. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a rare invention,\r\nSergeant Troy. Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have passed by me that night, and said\r\nnothing?\xe2\x80\x94that was all I meant to reproach you for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to. Half the pleasure of a feeling lies in\r\nbeing able to express it on the spur of the moment, and I let out mine.\r\nIt would have been just the same if you had been the reverse\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x94ugly and old\xe2\x80\x94I should have exclaimed about it in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since you have been so afflicted with strong feeling,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ever since I was big enough to know loveliness from deformity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis to be hoped your sense of the difference you speak of doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop at faces, but extends to morals as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of morals or religion\xe2\x80\x94my own or anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. Though\r\nperhaps I should have been a very good Christian if you pretty women\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t made me an idolater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba moved on to hide the irrepressible dimplings of merriment.\r\nTroy followed, whirling his crop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94you do forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say such things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said you were beautiful, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say so still; for, by G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 so you\r\nare! The most beautiful ever I saw, or may I fall dead this instant!\r\nWhy, upon my \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you\xe2\x80\x94you are so profane!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a\r\nrestless state between distress at hearing him and a _penchant_ to hear\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI again say you are a most fascinating woman. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nremarkable in my saying so, is there? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the fact is evident\r\nenough. Miss Everdene, my opinion may be too forcibly let out to please\r\nyou, and, for the matter of that, too insignificant to convince you,\r\nbut surely it is honest, and why can\xe2\x80\x99t it be excused?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x94it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a correct one,\xe2\x80\x9d she femininely murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fie\xe2\x80\x94fie! Am I any worse for breaking the third of that Terrible\r\nTen than you for breaking the ninth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem _quite_ true to me that I am fascinating,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied evasively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so to you: then I say with all respect that, if so, it is owing to\r\nyour modesty, Miss Everdene. But surely you must have been told by\r\neverybody of what everybody notices? And you should take their words\r\nfor it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t say so exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, they must!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I mean to my face, as you do,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, allowing herself to\r\nbe further lured into a conversation that intention had rigorously\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you know they think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94I certainly have heard Liddy say they do, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She paused.\r\n\r\nCapitulation\xe2\x80\x94that was the purport of the simple reply, guarded as it\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94capitulation, unknown to herself. Never did a fragile tailless\r\nsentence convey a more perfect meaning. The careless sergeant smiled\r\nwithin himself, and probably too the devil smiled from a loop-hole in\r\nTophet, for the moment was the turning-point of a career. Her tone and\r\nmien signified beyond mistake that the seed which was to lift the\r\nfoundation had taken root in the chink: the remainder was a mere\r\nquestion of time and natural changes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere the truth comes out!\xe2\x80\x9d said the soldier, in reply. \xe2\x80\x9cNever tell me\r\nthat a young lady can live in a buzz of admiration without knowing\r\nsomething about it. Ah, well, Miss Everdene, you are\xe2\x80\x94pardon my blunt\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94you are rather an injury to our race than otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x94indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, opening her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is true enough. I may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb (an\r\nold country saying, not of much account, but it will do for a rough\r\nsoldier), and so I will speak my mind, regardless of your pleasure, and\r\nwithout hoping or intending to get your pardon. Why, Miss Everdene, it\r\nis in this manner that your good looks may do more harm than good in\r\nthe world.\xe2\x80\x9d The sergeant looked down the mead in critical abstraction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably some one man on an average falls in love with each ordinary\r\nwoman. She can marry him: he is content, and leads a useful life. Such\r\nwomen as you a hundred men always covet\xe2\x80\x94your eyes will bewitch scores\r\non scores into an unavailing fancy for you\xe2\x80\x94you can only marry one of\r\nthat many. Out of these say twenty will endeavour to drown the\r\nbitterness of despised love in drink; twenty more will mope away their\r\nlives without a wish or attempt to make a mark in the world, because\r\nthey have no ambition apart from their attachment to you; twenty\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94the susceptible person myself possibly among them\xe2\x80\x94will be always\r\ndraggling after you, getting where they may just see you, doing\r\ndesperate things. Men are such constant fools! The rest may try to get\r\nover their passion with more or less success. But all these men will be\r\nsaddened. And not only those ninety-nine men, but the ninety-nine women\r\nthey might have married are saddened with them. There\xe2\x80\x99s my tale. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy I say that a woman so charming as yourself, Miss Everdene, is\r\nhardly a blessing to her race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe handsome sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s features were during this speech as rigid and\r\nstern as John Knox\xe2\x80\x99s in addressing his gay young queen.\r\n\r\nSeeing she made no reply, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you read French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I began, but when I got to the verbs, father died,\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x94when I have an opportunity, which latterly has not been often (my\r\nmother was a Parisienne)\xe2\x80\x94and there\xe2\x80\x99s a proverb they have, _Qui aime\r\nbien, ch\xc3\xa2tie bien_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98He chastens who loves well.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and there was even a little tremulousness in the\r\nusually cool girl\xe2\x80\x99s voice; \xe2\x80\x9cif you can only fight half as winningly as\r\nyou can talk, you are able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthen poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this\r\nadmission: in hastily trying to retrieve it, she went from bad to\r\nworse. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, however, suppose that _I_ derive any pleasure from what\r\nyou tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you do not\xe2\x80\x94I know it perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, with much hearty\r\nconviction on the exterior of his face: and altering the expression to\r\nmoodiness; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a dozen men are ready to speak tenderly to you, and\r\ngive the admiration you deserve without adding the warning you need, it\r\nstands to reason that my poor rough-and-ready mixture of praise and\r\nblame cannot convey much pleasure. Fool as I may be, I am not so\r\nconceited as to suppose that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you\xe2\x80\x94are conceited, nevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, looking\r\naskance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand, having lately\r\ngrown feverish under the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s system of procedure\xe2\x80\x94not because the\r\nnature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but because its vigour\r\nwas overwhelming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not own it to anybody else\xe2\x80\x94nor do I exactly to you. Still,\r\nthere might have been some self-conceit in my foolish supposition the\r\nother night. I knew that what I said in admiration might be an opinion\r\ntoo often forced upon you to give any pleasure, but I certainly did\r\nthink that the kindness of your nature might prevent you judging an\r\nuncontrolled tongue harshly\xe2\x80\x94which you have done\xe2\x80\x94and thinking badly of\r\nme and wounding me this morning, when I am working hard to save your\r\nhay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you need not think more of that: perhaps you did not mean to be\r\nrude to me by speaking out your mind: indeed, I believe you did not,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the shrewd woman, in painfully innocent earnest. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I thank you\r\nfor giving help here. But\xe2\x80\x94but mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me again in that\r\nway, or in any other, unless I speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Bathsheba! That is too hard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Why is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never speak to me; for I shall not be here long. I am soon\r\ngoing back again to the miserable monotony of drill\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps our\r\nregiment will be ordered out soon. And yet you take away the one little\r\newe-lamb of pleasure that I have in this dull life of mine. Well,\r\nperhaps generosity is not a woman\xe2\x80\x99s most marked characteristic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going from here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with some interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you ask Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94knowing as you do\xe2\x80\x94what my offence is based\r\non?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do care so much for a silly trifle of that kind, then, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind doing it,\xe2\x80\x9d she uncertainly and doubtingly answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally care for a word from me? you only say so\xe2\x80\x94I think you only say\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s unjust\xe2\x80\x94but I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat the remark. I am too gratified to get\r\nsuch a mark of your friendship at any price to cavil at the tone. I\r\n_do_, Miss Everdene, care for it. You may think a man foolish to want a\r\nmere word\xe2\x80\x94just a good morning. Perhaps he is\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But you have\r\nnever been a man looking upon a woman, and that woman yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know nothing of what such an experience is like\xe2\x80\x94and Heaven\r\nforbid that you ever should!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, flatterer! What is it like? I am interested in knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or look in any\r\ndirection except one without wretchedness, nor there without torture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, sergeant, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do\xe2\x80\x94you are pretending!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shaking her\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x9cYour words are too dashing to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not, upon the honour of a soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut _why_ is it so?\xe2\x80\x94Of course I ask for mere pastime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are so distracting\xe2\x80\x94and I am so distracted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you only saw me the other night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes no difference. The lightning works instantaneously. I loved\r\nyou then, at once\xe2\x80\x94as I do now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the feet upward, as high as she\r\nliked to venture her glance, which was not quite so high as his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot and you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d she said demurely. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no such sudden\r\nfeeling in people. I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to you any longer. Hear me, I wish I\r\nknew what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it is\xe2\x80\x94I am going\xe2\x80\x94I have wasted too much time here\r\nalready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked at his watch and told her. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a\r\nwatch, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not just at present\xe2\x80\x94I am about to get a new one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You shall be given one. Yes\xe2\x80\x94you shall. A gift, Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd before she knew what the young man was intending, a heavy gold\r\nwatch was in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess,\xe2\x80\x9d he quietly\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cThat watch has a history. Press the spring and open the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA crest and a motto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA coronet with five points, and beneath, _Cedit amor rebus_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Love\r\nyields to circumstance.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s the motto of the Earls of Severn. That\r\nwatch belonged to the last lord, and was given to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s husband,\r\na medical man, for his use till I came of age, when it was to be given\r\nto me. It was all the fortune that ever I inherited. That watch has\r\nregulated imperial interests in its time\xe2\x80\x94the stately ceremonial, the\r\ncourtly assignation, pompous travels, and lordly sleeps. Now it is\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Sergeant Troy, I cannot take this\xe2\x80\x94I cannot!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with\r\nround-eyed wonder. \xe2\x80\x9cA gold watch! What are you doing? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be such a\r\ndissembler!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his gift, which she held\r\nout persistently towards him. Bathsheba followed as he retired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it\xe2\x80\x94do, Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x94keep it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the erratic child of impulse.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact of your possessing it makes it worth ten times as much to me.\r\nA more plebeian one will answer my purpose just as well, and the\r\npleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats against\xe2\x80\x94well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nspeak of that. It is in far worthier hands than ever it has been in\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut indeed I can\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a perfect simmer of\r\ndistress. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how can you do such a thing; that is if you really mean\r\nit! Give me your dead father\xe2\x80\x99s watch, and such a valuable one! You\r\nshould not be so reckless, indeed, Sergeant Troy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI loved my father: good; but better, I love you more. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I can\r\ndo it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, with an intonation of such exquisite\r\nfidelity to nature that it was evidently not all acted now. Her beauty,\r\nwhich, whilst it had been quiescent, he had praised in jest, had in its\r\nanimated phases moved him to earnest; and though his seriousness was\r\nless than she imagined, it was probably more than he imagined himself.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was brimming with agitated bewilderment, and she said, in\r\nhalf-suspicious accents of feeling, \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be! Oh, how can it be, that\r\nyou care for me, and so suddenly! You have seen so little of me: I may\r\nnot be really so\xe2\x80\x94so nice-looking as I seem to you. Please, do take it;\r\nOh, do! I cannot and will not have it. Believe me, your generosity is\r\ntoo great. I have never done you a single kindness, and why should you\r\nbe so kind to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA factitious reply had been again upon his lips, but it was again\r\nsuspended, and he looked at her with an arrested eye. The truth was,\r\nthat as she now stood\xe2\x80\x94excited, wild, and honest as the day\xe2\x80\x94her alluring\r\nbeauty bore out so fully the epithets he had bestowed upon it that he\r\nwas quite startled at his temerity in advancing them as false. He said\r\nmechanically, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, why?\xe2\x80\x9d and continued to look at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd my workfolk see me following you about the field, and are\r\nwondering. Oh, this is dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, unconscious of the\r\ntransmutation she was effecting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not quite mean you to accept it at first, for it was my one poor\r\npatent of nobility,\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out, bluntly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, upon my soul, I wish\r\nyou would now. Without any shamming, come! Don\xe2\x80\x99t deny me the happiness\r\nof wearing it for my sake? But you are too lovely even to care to be\r\nkind as others are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! I have reasons for reserve which I cannot\r\nexplain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it be, then, let it be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, receiving back the watch at\r\nlast; \xe2\x80\x9cI must be leaving you now. And will you speak to me for these\r\nfew weeks of my stay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will. Yet, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I will! Oh, why did you come and\r\ndisturb me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps in setting a gin, I have caught myself. Such things have\r\nhappened. Well, will you let me work in your fields?\xe2\x80\x9d he coaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so; if it is any pleasure to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene, I thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the slope of his head,\r\nsaluted, and returned to the distant group of haymakers.\r\n\r\nBathsheba could not face the haymakers now. Her heart erratically\r\nflitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and almost\r\ntearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what have I done! What\r\ndoes it mean! I wish I knew how much of it was true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\nHIVING THE BEES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weatherbury bees were late in their swarming this year. It was in\r\nthe latter part of June, and the day after the interview with Troy in\r\nthe hayfield, that Bathsheba was standing in her garden, watching a\r\nswarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place. Not only\r\nwere they late this year, but unruly. Sometimes throughout a whole\r\nseason all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable bough\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nas part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next year they would,\r\nwith just the same unanimity, make straight off to the uppermost member\r\nof some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden, and there defy all invaders\r\nwho did not come armed with ladders and staves to take them.\r\n\r\nThis was the case at present. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, shaded by one hand,\r\nwere following the ascending multitude against the unexplorable stretch\r\nof blue till they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trees spoken\r\nof. A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged formations of the\r\nuniverse, time and times ago, was observable. The bustling swarm had\r\nswept the sky in a scattered and uniform haze, which now thickened to a\r\nnebulous centre: this glided on to a bough and grew still denser, till\r\nit formed a solid black spot upon the light.\r\n\r\nThe men and women being all busily engaged in saving the hay\xe2\x80\x94even Liddy\r\nhad left the house for the purpose of lending a hand\xe2\x80\x94Bathsheba resolved\r\nto hive the bees herself, if possible. She had dressed the hive with\r\nherbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and crook, made herself\r\nimpregnable with armour of leather gloves, straw hat, and large gauze\r\nveil\xe2\x80\x94once green but now faded to snuff colour\xe2\x80\x94and ascended a dozen\r\nrungs of the ladder. At once she heard, not ten yards off, a voice that\r\nwas beginning to have a strange power in agitating her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene, let me assist you; you should not attempt such a thing\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy was just opening the garden gate.\r\n\r\nBathsheba flung down the brush, crook, and empty hive, pulled the skirt\r\nof her dress tightly round her ankles in a tremendous flurry, and as\r\nwell as she could slid down the ladder. By the time she reached the\r\nbottom Troy was there also, and he stooped to pick up the hive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate I am to have dropped in at this moment!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nsergeant.\r\n\r\nShe found her voice in a minute. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! and will you shake them in for\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in what, for a defiant girl, was a faltering way;\r\nthough, for a timid girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill I!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I will. How blooming you are\r\nto-day!\xe2\x80\x9d Troy flung down his cane and put his foot on the ladder to\r\nascend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have on the veil and gloves, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be stung\r\nfearfully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes. I must put on the veil and gloves. Will you kindly show me\r\nhow to fix them properly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you must have the broad-brimmed hat, too, for your cap has no brim\r\nto keep the veil off, and they\xe2\x80\x99d reach your face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe broad-brimmed hat, too, by all means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be taken off\xe2\x80\x94veil and\r\nall attached\xe2\x80\x94and placed upon his head, Troy tossing his own into a\r\ngooseberry bush. Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round\r\nhis collar and the gloves put on him.\r\n\r\nHe looked such an extraordinary object in this guise that, flurried as\r\nshe was, she could not avoid laughing outright. It was the removal of\r\nyet another stake from the palisade of cold manners which had kept him\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBathsheba looked on from the ground whilst he was busy sweeping and\r\nshaking the bees from the tree, holding up the hive with the other hand\r\nfor them to fall into. She made use of an unobserved minute whilst his\r\nattention was absorbed in the operation to arrange her plumes a little.\r\nHe came down holding the hive at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, behind which trailed a\r\ncloud of bees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, through the veil, \xe2\x80\x9cholding up this hive\r\nmakes one\xe2\x80\x99s arm ache worse than a week of sword-exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d When the\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre was complete he approached her. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you be good enough to\r\nuntie me and let me out? I am nearly stifled inside this silk cage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo hide her embarrassment during the unwonted process of untying the\r\nstring about his neck, she said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen that you spoke of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sword-exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! would you like to?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\nBathsheba hesitated. She had heard wondrous reports from time to time\r\nby dwellers in Weatherbury, who had by chance sojourned awhile in\r\nCasterbridge, near the barracks, of this strange and glorious\r\nperformance, the sword-exercise. Men and boys who had peeped through\r\nchinks or over walls into the barrack-yard returned with accounts of\r\nits being the most flashing affair conceivable; accoutrements and\r\nweapons glistening like stars\xe2\x80\x94here, there, around\xe2\x80\x94yet all by rule and\r\ncompass. So she said mildly what she felt strongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I should like to see it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you shall; you shall see me go through it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me consider.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with a walking-stick\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to see that. It must be a real\r\nsword.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know; and I have no sword here; but I think I could get one by\r\nthe evening. Now, will you do this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy bent over her and murmured some suggestion in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, blushing. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you very much, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t on any account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely you might? Nobody would know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, but with a weakened negation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI must bring Liddy too. Might I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy looked far away. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you want to bring her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\nAn unconscious look of assent in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s eyes betrayed that\r\nsomething more than his coldness had made her also feel that Liddy\r\nwould be superfluous in the suggested scene. She had felt it, even\r\nwhilst making the proposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won\xe2\x80\x99t bring Liddy\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come. But only for a very short\r\ntime,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; \xe2\x80\x9ca very short time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not take five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\nTHE HOLLOW AMID THE FERNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hill opposite Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling extended, a mile off, into an\r\nuncultivated tract of land, dotted at this season with tall thickets of\r\nbrake fern, plump and diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and radiant\r\nin hues of clear and untainted green.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock this midsummer evening, whilst the bristling ball of\r\ngold in the west still swept the tips of the ferns with its long,\r\nluxuriant rays, a soft brushing-by of garments might have been heard\r\namong them, and Bathsheba appeared in their midst, their soft, feathery\r\narms caressing her up to her shoulders. She paused, turned, went back\r\nover the hill and half-way to her own door, whence she cast a farewell\r\nglance upon the spot she had just left, having resolved not to remain\r\nnear the place after all.\r\n\r\nShe saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the\r\nrise. It disappeared on the other side.\r\n\r\nShe waited one minute\xe2\x80\x94two minutes\xe2\x80\x94thought of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment at\r\nher non-fulfilment of a promised engagement, till she again ran along\r\nthe field, clambered over the bank, and followed the original\r\ndirection. She was now literally trembling and panting at this her\r\ntemerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath came and went\r\nquickly, and her eyes shone with an infrequent light. Yet go she must.\r\nShe reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns. Troy stood\r\nin the bottom, looking up towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you rustling through the fern before I saw you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ncoming up and giving her his hand to help her down the slope.\r\n\r\nThe pit was a saucer-shaped concave, naturally formed, with a top\r\ndiameter of about thirty feet, and shallow enough to allow the sunshine\r\nto reach their heads. Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was met\r\nby a circular horizon of fern: this grew nearly to the bottom of the\r\nslope and then abruptly ceased. The middle within the belt of verdure\r\nwas floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled,\r\nso yielding that the foot was half-buried within it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, producing the sword, which, as he raised it into the\r\nsunlight, gleamed a sort of greeting, like a living thing, \xe2\x80\x9cfirst, we\r\nhave four right and four left cuts; four right and four left thrusts.\r\nInfantry cuts and guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;\r\nbut they are not so swashing. They have seven cuts and three thrusts.\r\nSo much as a preliminary. Well, next, our cut one is as if you were\r\nsowing your corn\xe2\x80\x94so.\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in\r\nthe air, and Troy\xe2\x80\x99s arm was still again. \xe2\x80\x9cCut two, as if you were\r\nhedging\xe2\x80\x94so. Three, as if you were reaping\xe2\x80\x94so. Four, as if you were\r\nthreshing\xe2\x80\x94in that way. Then the same on the left. The thrusts are\r\nthese: one, two, three, four, right; one, two, three, four, left.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nrepeated them. \xe2\x80\x9cHave \xe2\x80\x99em again?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hurriedly interrupted: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather not; though I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your\r\ntwos and fours; but your ones and threes are terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you off the ones and threes. Next, cuts, points\r\nand guards altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d Troy duly exhibited them. \xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npursuing practice, in this way.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the movements as before.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, those are the stereotyped forms. The infantry have two most\r\ndiabolical upward cuts, which we are too humane to use. Like\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94three, four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow murderous and bloodthirsty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are rather deathly. Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll be more interesting, and let you see\r\nsome loose play\xe2\x80\x94giving all the cuts and points, infantry and cavalry,\r\nquicker than lightning, and as promiscuously\xe2\x80\x94with just enough rule to\r\nregulate instinct and yet not to fetter it. You are my antagonist, with\r\nthis difference from real warfare, that I shall miss you every time by\r\none hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, or perhaps two. Mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t flinch, whatever you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure not to!\xe2\x80\x9d she said invincibly.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to about a yard in front of him.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s adventurous spirit was beginning to find some grains of\r\nrelish in these highly novel proceedings. She took up her position as\r\ndirected, facing Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow just to learn whether you have pluck enough to let me do what I\r\nwish, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a preliminary test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flourished the sword by way of introduction number two, and the next\r\nthing of which she was conscious was that the point and blade of the\r\nsword were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just above her\r\nhip; then of their reappearance on her right side, emerging as it were\r\nfrom between her ribs, having apparently passed through her body. The\r\nthird item of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword,\r\nperfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in Troy\xe2\x80\x99s hand (in\r\nthe position technically called \xe2\x80\x9crecover swords\xe2\x80\x9d). All was as quick as\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out in affright, pressing her hand to her side. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou run me through?\xe2\x80\x94no, you have not! Whatever have you done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not touched you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was mere sleight of\r\nhand. The sword passed behind you. Now you are not afraid, are you?\r\nBecause if you are I can\xe2\x80\x99t perform. I give my word that I will not only\r\nnot hurt you, but not once touch you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am afraid. You are quite sure you will not hurt me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the sword very sharp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no\xe2\x80\x94only stand as still as a statue. Now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant the atmosphere was transformed to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Beams\r\nof light caught from the low sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays, above, around, in front of\r\nher, well-nigh shut out earth and heaven\xe2\x80\x94all emitted in the marvellous\r\nevolutions of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s reflecting blade, which seemed everywhere at once,\r\nand yet nowhere specially. These circling gleams were accompanied by a\r\nkeen rush that was almost a whistling\xe2\x80\x94also springing from all sides of\r\nher at once. In short, she was enclosed in a firmament of light, and of\r\nsharp hisses, resembling a sky-full of meteors close at hand.\r\n\r\nNever since the broadsword became the national weapon had there been\r\nmore dexterity shown in its management than by the hands of Sergeant\r\nTroy, and never had he been in such splendid temper for the performance\r\nas now in the evening sunshine among the ferns with Bathsheba. It may\r\nsafely be asserted with respect to the closeness of his cuts, that had\r\nit been possible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a\r\npermanent substance wherever it flew past, the space left untouched\r\nwould have been almost a mould of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s figure.\r\n\r\nBehind the luminous streams of this _aurora militaris_, she could see\r\nthe hue of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s sword arm, spread in a scarlet haze over the space\r\ncovered by its motions, like a twanged harpstring, and behind all Troy\r\nhimself, mostly facing her; sometimes, to show the rear cuts, half\r\nturned away, his eye nevertheless always keenly measuring her breadth\r\nand outline, and his lips tightly closed in sustained effort. Next, his\r\nmovements lapsed slower, and she could see them individually. The\r\nhissing of the sword had ceased, and he stopped entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat outer loose lock of hair wants tidying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before she had\r\nmoved or spoken. \xe2\x80\x9cWait: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword had descended. The\r\nlock dropped to the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravely borne!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t flinch a shade\xe2\x80\x99s thickness.\r\nWonderful in a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it. Oh, you have spoilt my hair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no! I am afraid of you\xe2\x80\x94indeed I am!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t touch you at all\xe2\x80\x94not even your hair. I am only going to kill\r\nthat caterpillar settling on you. Now: still!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared that a caterpillar had come from the fern and chosen the\r\nfront of her bodice as his resting place. She saw the point glisten\r\ntowards her bosom, and seemingly enter it. Bathsheba closed her eyes in\r\nthe full persuasion that she was killed at last. However, feeling just\r\nas usual, she opened them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is, look,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, holding his sword before her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar was spitted upon its point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it is magic!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94dexterity. I merely gave point to your bosom where the\r\ncaterpillar was, and instead of running you through checked the\r\nextension a thousandth of an inch short of your surface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how could you chop off a curl of my hair with a sword that has no\r\nedge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo edge! This sword will shave like a razor. Look here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched the palm of his hand with the blade, and then, lifting it,\r\nshowed her a thin shaving of scarf-skin dangling therefrom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said before beginning that it was blunt and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cut me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was to get you to stand still, and so make sure of your safety.\r\nThe risk of injuring you through your moving was too great not to force\r\nme to tell you a fib to escape it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been within an inch of my life, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore precisely speaking, you have been within half an inch of being\r\npared alive two hundred and ninety-five times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCruel, cruel, \xe2\x80\x99tis of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been perfectly safe, nevertheless. My sword never errs.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nTroy returned the weapon to the scabbard.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, overcome by a hundred tumultuous feelings resulting from the\r\nscene, abstractedly sat down on a tuft of heather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must leave you now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, softly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll venture to take\r\nand keep this in remembrance of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe saw him stoop to the grass, pick up the winding lock which he had\r\nsevered from her manifold tresses, twist it round his fingers, unfasten\r\na button in the breast of his coat, and carefully put it inside. She\r\nfelt powerless to withstand or deny him. He was altogether too much for\r\nher, and Bathsheba seemed as one who, facing a reviving wind, finds it\r\nblow so strongly that it stops the breath. He drew near and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust be leaving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew nearer still. A minute later and she saw his scarlet form\r\ndisappear amid the ferny thicket, almost in a flash, like a brand\r\nswiftly waved.\r\n\r\nThat minute\xe2\x80\x99s interval had brought the blood beating into her face, set\r\nher stinging as if aflame to the very hollows of her feet, and enlarged\r\nemotion to a compass which quite swamped thought. It had brought upon\r\nher a stroke resulting, as did that of Moses in Horeb, in a liquid\r\nstream\xe2\x80\x94here a stream of tears. She felt like one who has sinned a great\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance had been the gentle dip of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth downwards upon\r\nher own. He had kissed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\nPARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now see the element of folly distinctly mingling with the many\r\nvarying particulars which made up the character of Bathsheba Everdene.\r\nIt was almost foreign to her intrinsic nature. Introduced as lymph on\r\nthe dart of Eros, it eventually permeated and coloured her whole\r\nconstitution. Bathsheba, though she had too much understanding to be\r\nentirely governed by her womanliness, had too much womanliness to use\r\nher understanding to the best advantage. Perhaps in no minor point does\r\nwoman astonish her helpmate more than in the strange power she\r\npossesses of believing cajoleries that she knows to be false\xe2\x80\x94except,\r\nindeed, in that of being utterly sceptical on strictures that she knows\r\nto be true.\r\n\r\nBathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when\r\nthey abandon their self-reliance. When a strong woman recklessly throws\r\naway her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any\r\nstrength to throw away. One source of her inadequacy is the novelty of\r\nthe occasion. She has never had practice in making the best of such a\r\ncondition. Weakness is doubly weak by being new.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was not conscious of guile in this matter. Though in one\r\nsense a woman of the world, it was, after all, that world of daylight\r\ncoteries and green carpets wherein cattle form the passing crowd and\r\nwinds the busy hum; where a quiet family of rabbits or hares lives on\r\nthe other side of your party-wall, where your neighbour is everybody in\r\nthe tything, and where calculation is confined to market-days. Of the\r\nfabricated tastes of good fashionable society she knew but little, and\r\nof the formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at all. Had her\r\nutmost thoughts in this direction been distinctly worded (and by\r\nherself they never were), they would only have amounted to such a\r\nmatter as that she felt her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her\r\ndiscretion. Her love was entire as a child\xe2\x80\x99s, and though warm as summer\r\nit was fresh as spring. Her culpability lay in her making no attempt to\r\ncontrol feeling by subtle and careful inquiry into consequences. She\r\ncould show others the steep and thorny way, but \xe2\x80\x9creck\xe2\x80\x99d not her own\r\nrede.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Troy\xe2\x80\x99s deformities lay deep down from a woman\xe2\x80\x99s vision, whilst his\r\nembellishments were upon the very surface; thus contrasting with homely\r\nOak, whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose virtues were\r\nas metals in a mine.\r\n\r\nThe difference between love and respect was markedly shown in her\r\nconduct. Bathsheba had spoken of her interest in Boldwood with the\r\ngreatest freedom to Liddy, but she had only communed with her own heart\r\nconcerning Troy.\r\n\r\nAll this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled thereby from the\r\ntime of his daily journey a-field to the time of his return, and on to\r\nthe small hours of many a night. That he was not beloved had hitherto\r\nbeen his great sorrow; that Bathsheba was getting into the toils was\r\nnow a sorrow greater than the first, and one which nearly obscured it.\r\nIt was a result which paralleled the oft-quoted observation of\r\nHippocrates concerning physical pains.\r\n\r\nThat is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love which not even the\r\nfear of breeding aversion in the bosom of the one beloved can deter\r\nfrom combating his or her errors. Oak determined to speak to his\r\nmistress. He would base his appeal on what he considered her unfair\r\ntreatment of Farmer Boldwood, now absent from home.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity occurred one evening when she had gone for a short walk\r\nby a path through the neighbouring cornfields. It was dusk when Oak,\r\nwho had not been far a-field that day, took the same path and met her\r\nreturning, quite pensively, as he thought.\r\n\r\nThe wheat was now tall, and the path was narrow; thus the way was quite\r\na sunken groove between the embowing thicket on either side. Two\r\npersons could not walk abreast without damaging the crop, and Oak stood\r\naside to let her pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are taking a walk too. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would come to meet you, as it is rather late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak,\r\nturning and following at her heels when she had brushed somewhat\r\nquickly by him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, indeed, but I am not very fearful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; but there are bad characters about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never meet them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Oak, with marvellous ingenuity, had been going to introduce the\r\ngallant sergeant through the channel of \xe2\x80\x9cbad characters.\xe2\x80\x9d But all at\r\nonce the scheme broke down, it suddenly occurring to him that this was\r\nrather a clumsy way, and too barefaced to begin with. He tried another\r\npreamble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from home,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94I mean Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94why, thinks I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d She walked on without turning her head, and for many steps\r\nnothing further was heard from her quarter than the rustle of her dress\r\nagainst the heavy corn-ears. Then she resumed rather tartly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand what you meant by saying that Mr. Boldwood\r\nwould naturally come to meet me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI meant on account of the wedding which they say is likely to take\r\nplace between you and him, miss. Forgive my speaking plainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say what is not true.\xe2\x80\x9d she returned quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cNo marriage is\r\nlikely to take place between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for the moment had come.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Everdene,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cputting aside what people say, I never\r\nin my life saw any courting if his is not a courting of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba would probably have terminated the conversation there and\r\nthen by flatly forbidding the subject, had not her conscious weakness\r\nof position allured her to palter and argue in endeavours to better it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince this subject has been mentioned,\xe2\x80\x9d she said very emphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam glad of the opportunity of clearing up a mistake which is very\r\ncommon and very provoking. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t definitely promise Mr. Boldwood\r\nanything. I have never cared for him. I respect him, and he has urged\r\nme to marry him. But I have given him no distinct answer. As soon as he\r\nreturns I shall do so; and the answer will be that I cannot think of\r\nmarrying him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are full of mistakes, seemingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other day they said you were trifling with him, and you almost\r\nproved that you were not; lately they have said that you be not, and\r\nyou straightway begin to show\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am, I suppose you mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope they speak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do, but wrongly applied. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with him; but then, I\r\nhave nothing to do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s rival in a wrong\r\ntone to her after all. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had never met that young Sergeant\r\nTroy, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s steps became faintly spasmodic. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not good enough for \xe2\x80\x99ee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid any one tell you to speak to me like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it appears to me that Sergeant Troy does not concern us here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, intractably. \xe2\x80\x9cYet I must say that Sergeant Troy is an\r\neducated man, and quite worthy of any woman. He is well born.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis being higher in learning and birth than the ruck o\xe2\x80\x99 soldiers is\r\nanything but a proof of his worth. It show\xe2\x80\x99s his course to be\r\ndown\xe2\x80\x99ard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see what this has to do with our conversation. Mr. Troy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourse is not by any means downward; and his superiority _is_ a proof\r\nof his worth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe him to have no conscience at all. And I cannot help begging\r\nyou, miss, to have nothing to do with him. Listen to me this once\xe2\x80\x94only\r\nthis once! I don\xe2\x80\x99t say he\xe2\x80\x99s such a bad man as I have fancied\xe2\x80\x94I pray to\r\nGod he is not. But since we don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what he is, why not\r\nbehave as if he _might_ be bad, simply for your own safety? Don\xe2\x80\x99t trust\r\nhim, mistress; I ask you not to trust him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like soldiers, but this one I do not like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sturdily. \xe2\x80\x9cHis\r\ncleverness in his calling may have tempted him astray, and what is\r\nmirth to the neighbours is ruin to the woman. When he tries to talk to\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee again, why not turn away with a short \xe2\x80\x98Good day\xe2\x80\x99; and when you see\r\nhim coming one way, turn the other. When he says anything laughable,\r\nfail to see the point and don\xe2\x80\x99t smile, and speak of him before those\r\nwho will report your talk as \xe2\x80\x98that fantastical man,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98that Sergeant\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That man of a family that has come to the dogs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be unmannerly towards en, but harmless-uncivil, and so get rid of\r\nthe man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo Christmas robin detained by a window-pane ever pulsed as did\r\nBathsheba now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say\xe2\x80\x94I say again\xe2\x80\x94that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become you to talk about him. Why he\r\nshould be mentioned passes me quite!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow this, th-th-that he is a thoroughly conscientious man\xe2\x80\x94blunt\r\nsometimes even to rudeness\xe2\x80\x94but always speaking his mind about you plain\r\nto your face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is as good as anybody in this parish! He is very particular, too,\r\nabout going to church\xe2\x80\x94yes, he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afeard nobody saw him there. I never did, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason of that is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he goes in privately\r\nby the old tower door, just when the service commences, and sits at the\r\nback of the gallery. He told me so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis supreme instance of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s goodness fell upon Gabriel ears like\r\nthe thirteenth stroke of crazy clock. It was not only received with\r\nutter incredulity as regarded itself, but threw a doubt on all the\r\nassurances that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nOak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him. He brimmed with\r\ndeep feeling as he replied in a steady voice, the steadiness of which\r\nwas spoilt by the palpableness of his great effort to keep it so:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, mistress, that I love you, and shall love you always. I only\r\nmention this to bring to your mind that at any rate I would wish to do\r\nyou no harm: beyond that I put it aside. I have lost in the race for\r\nmoney and good things, and I am not such a fool as to pretend to \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nnow I am poor, and you have got altogether above me. But Bathsheba,\r\ndear mistress, this I beg you to consider\xe2\x80\x94that, both to keep yourself\r\nwell honoured among the workfolk, and in common generosity to an\r\nhonourable man who loves you as well as I, you should be more discreet\r\nin your bearing towards this soldier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre ye not more to me than my own affairs, and even life!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, listen to me! I am six years older than you, and Mr. Boldwood is\r\nten years older than I, and consider\xe2\x80\x94I do beg of \xe2\x80\x99ee to consider before\r\nit is too late\xe2\x80\x94how safe you would be in his hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to his own love for her lessened, to some extent, her\r\nanger at his interference; but she could not really forgive him for\r\nletting his wish to marry her be eclipsed by his wish to do her good,\r\nany more than for his slighting treatment of Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to go elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she commanded, a paleness of face\r\ninvisible to the eye being suggested by the trembling words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not\r\nremain on this farm any longer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you\xe2\x80\x94I beg you to go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the second time you have\r\npretended to dismiss me; and what\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99 it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretended! You shall go, sir\xe2\x80\x94your lecturing I will not hear! I am\r\nmistress here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, indeed\xe2\x80\x94what folly will you say next? Treating me like Dick, Tom\r\nand Harry when you know that a short time ago my position was as good\r\nas yours! Upon my life, Bathsheba, it is too barefaced. You know, too,\r\nthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t go without putting things in such a strait as you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget out of I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell when. Unless, indeed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to have an\r\nunderstanding man as bailiff, or manager, or something. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have no bailiff; I shall continue to be my own manager,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid decisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; you should be thankful to me for biding. How would\r\nthe farm go on with nobody to mind it but a woman? But mind this, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish \xe2\x80\x99ee to feel you owe me anything. Not I. What I do, I do.\r\nSometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to leave the place\xe2\x80\x94for\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m content to be a nobody. I was made for better things.\r\nHowever, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see your concerns going to ruin, as they must\r\nif you keep in this mind.... I hate taking my own measure so plain,\r\nbut, upon my life, your provoking ways make a man say what he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndream of at other times! I own to being rather interfering. But you\r\nknow well enough how it is, and who she is that I like too well, and\r\nfeel too much like a fool about to be civil to her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that she privately and unconsciously respected\r\nhim a little for this grim fidelity, which had been shown in his tone\r\neven more than in his words. At any rate she murmured something to the\r\neffect that he might stay if he wished. She said more distinctly, \xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nyou leave me alone now? I don\xe2\x80\x99t order it as a mistress\xe2\x80\x94I ask it as a\r\nwoman, and I expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I will, Miss Everdene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, gently. He wondered\r\nthat the request should have come at this moment, for the strife was\r\nover, and they were on a most desolate hill, far from every human\r\nhabitation, and the hour was getting late. He stood still and allowed\r\nher to get far ahead of him till he could only see her form upon the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nA distressing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of him at that\r\npoint now ensued. A figure apparently rose from the earth beside her.\r\nThe shape beyond all doubt was Troy\xe2\x80\x99s. Oak would not be even a possible\r\nlistener, and at once turned back till a good two hundred yards were\r\nbetween the lovers and himself.\r\n\r\nGabriel went home by way of the churchyard. In passing the tower he\r\nthought of what she had said about the sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s virtuous habit of\r\nentering the church unperceived at the beginning of service. Believing\r\nthat the little gallery door alluded to was quite disused, he ascended\r\nthe external flight of steps at the top of which it stood, and examined\r\nit. The pale lustre yet hanging in the north-western heaven was\r\nsufficient to show that a sprig of ivy had grown from the wall across\r\nthe door to a length of more than a foot, delicately tying the panel to\r\nthe stone jamb. It was a decisive proof that the door had not been\r\nopened at least since Troy came back to Weatherbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\nHOT CHEEKS AND TEARFUL EYES\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house. There burnt upon\r\nher face when she met the light of the candles the flush and excitement\r\nwhich were little less than chronic with her now. The farewell words of\r\nTroy, who had accompanied her to the very door, still lingered in her\r\nears. He had bidden her adieu for two days, which were, so he stated,\r\nto be spent at Bath in visiting some friends. He had also kissed her a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a little fact which did\r\nnot come to light till a long time afterwards: that Troy\xe2\x80\x99s presentation\r\nof himself so aptly at the roadside this evening was not by any\r\ndistinctly preconcerted arrangement. He had hinted\xe2\x80\x94she had forbidden;\r\nand it was only on the chance of his still coming that she had\r\ndismissed Oak, fearing a meeting between them just then.\r\n\r\nShe now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed by all these new and\r\nfevering sequences. Then she jumped up with a manner of decision, and\r\nfetched her desk from a side table.\r\n\r\nIn three minutes, without pause or modification, she had written a\r\nletter to Boldwood, at his address beyond Casterbridge, saying mildly\r\nbut firmly that she had well considered the whole subject he had\r\nbrought before her and kindly given her time to decide upon; that her\r\nfinal decision was that she could not marry him. She had expressed to\r\nOak an intention to wait till Boldwood came home before communicating\r\nto him her conclusive reply. But Bathsheba found that she could not\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to send this letter till the next day; yet to quell\r\nher uneasiness by getting it out of her hands, and so, as it were,\r\nsetting the act in motion at once, she arose to take it to any one of\r\nthe women who might be in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe paused in the passage. A dialogue was going on in the kitchen, and\r\nBathsheba and Troy were the subject of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he marry her, she\xe2\x80\x99ll gie up farming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twill be a gallant life, but may bring some trouble between the\r\nmirth\xe2\x80\x94so say I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish I had half such a husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba had too much sense to mind seriously what her servitors said\r\nabout her; but too much womanly redundance of speech to leave alone\r\nwhat was said till it died the natural death of unminded things. She\r\nburst in upon them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you speaking of?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before anybody replied. At last Liddy said frankly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was passing was a bit of a word about yourself, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so! Maryann and Liddy and Temperance\xe2\x80\x94now I forbid you to\r\nsuppose such things. You know I don\xe2\x80\x99t care the least for Mr. Troy\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nI. Everybody knows how much I hate him.\xe2\x80\x94Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the froward\r\nyoung person, \xe2\x80\x9c_hate_ him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know you do, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy; \xe2\x80\x9cand so do we all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaryann\xe2\x80\x94Oh you perjured woman! How can you speak that wicked story!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Bathsheba, excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou admired him from your heart only this\r\nmorning in the very world, you did. Yes, Maryann, you know it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss, but so did you. He is a wild scamp now, and you are right\r\nto hate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s _not_ a wild scamp! How dare you to my face! I have no right to\r\nhate him, nor you, nor anybody. But I am a silly woman! What is it to\r\nme what he is? You know it is nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to defend his good name, not I. Mind this, if any of you say a\r\nword against him you\xe2\x80\x99ll be dismissed instantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe flung down the letter and surged back into the parlour, with a big\r\nheart and tearful eyes, Liddy following her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh miss!\xe2\x80\x9d said mild Liddy, looking pitifully into Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam sorry we mistook you so! I did think you cared for him; but I see\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut the door, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy closed the door, and went on: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople always say such foolery,\r\nmiss. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make answer hencefor\xe2\x80\x99ard, \xe2\x80\x98Of course a lady like Miss\r\nEverdene can\xe2\x80\x99t love him\xe2\x80\x99; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it out in plain black and white.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba burst out: \xe2\x80\x9cO Liddy, are you such a simpleton? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you read\r\nriddles? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Are you a woman yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy\xe2\x80\x99s clear eyes rounded with wonderment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you must be a blind thing, Liddy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in reckless\r\nabandonment and grief. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I love him to very distraction and misery\r\nand agony! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened at me, though perhaps I am enough to\r\nfrighten any innocent woman. Come closer\xe2\x80\x94closer.\xe2\x80\x9d She put her arms\r\nround Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cI must let it out to somebody; it is wearing me\r\naway! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you yet know enough of me to see through that miserable\r\ndenial of mine? O God, what a lie it was! Heaven and my Love forgive\r\nme. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that a woman who loves at all thinks nothing of\r\nperjury when it is balanced against her love? There, go out of the\r\nroom; I want to be quite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy went towards the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy, come here. Solemnly swear to me that he\xe2\x80\x99s not a fast man; that\r\nit is all lies they say about him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, miss, how can I say he is not if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou graceless girl! How can you have the cruel heart to repeat what\r\nthey say? Unfeeling thing that you are.... But _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ see if you or\r\nanybody else in the village, or town either, dare do such a thing!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstarted off, pacing from fireplace to door, and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I know it is not true!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, frightened at\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s unwonted vehemence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you only agree with me like that to please me. But, Liddy,\r\nhe _cannot be_ bad, as is said. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, miss, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to say, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, beginning to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nsay No, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me; and if I say Yes, you rage at me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x94say you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe him to be so bad as they make out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not bad at all.... My poor life and heart, how weak I am!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmoaned, in a relaxed, desultory way, heedless of Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s presence. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nhow I wish I had never seen him! Loving is misery for women always. I\r\nshall never forgive God for making me a woman, and dearly am I\r\nbeginning to pay for the honour of owning a pretty face.\xe2\x80\x9d She freshened\r\nand turned to Liddy suddenly. \xe2\x80\x9cMind this, Lydia Smallbury, if you\r\nrepeat anywhere a single word of what I have said to you inside this\r\nclosed door, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never trust you, or love you, or have you with me a\r\nmoment longer\xe2\x80\x94not a moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to repeat anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, with womanly dignity of\r\na diminutive order; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to stay with you. And, if you\r\nplease, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at the end of the harvest, or this week, or to-day....\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nconcluded the small woman, bigly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Liddy; you must stay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, dropping from\r\nhaughtiness to entreaty with capricious inconsequence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must not\r\nnotice my being in a taking just now. You are not as a servant\xe2\x80\x94you are\r\na companion to me. Dear, dear\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am doing since this\r\nmiserable ache of my heart has weighted and worn upon me so! What shall\r\nI come to! I suppose I shall get further and further into troubles. I\r\nwonder sometimes if I am doomed to die in the Union. I am friendless\r\nenough, God knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t notice anything, nor will I leave you!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Liddy,\r\nimpulsively putting up her lips to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s, and kissing her.\r\n\r\nThen Bathsheba kissed Liddy, and all was smooth again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t often cry, do I, Lidd? but you have made tears come into my\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a smile shining through the moisture. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to think\r\nhim a good man, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear Liddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, miss, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a sort of steady man in a wild way, you know. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than\r\nto be as some are, wild in a steady way. I am afraid that\xe2\x80\x99s how I am.\r\nAnd promise me to keep my secret\xe2\x80\x94do, Liddy! And do not let them know\r\nthat I have been crying about him, because it will be dreadful for me,\r\nand no good to him, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath\xe2\x80\x99s head himself shan\xe2\x80\x99t wring it from me, mistress, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind\r\nto keep anything; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll always be your friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Liddy,\r\nemphatically, at the same time bringing a few more tears into her own\r\neyes, not from any particular necessity, but from an artistic sense of\r\nmaking herself in keeping with the remainder of the picture, which\r\nseems to influence women at such times. \xe2\x80\x9cI think God likes us to be\r\ngood friends, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, dear miss, you won\xe2\x80\x99t harry me and storm at me, will you? because\r\nyou seem to swell so tall as a lion then, and it frightens me! Do you\r\nknow, I fancy you would be a match for any man when you are in one o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour takings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! do you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, slightly laughing, though somewhat\r\nseriously alarmed by this Amazonian picture of herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am\r\nnot a bold sort of maid\xe2\x80\x94mannish?\xe2\x80\x9d she continued with some anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, not mannish; but so almighty womanish that \xe2\x80\x99tis getting on that\r\nway sometimes. Ah! miss,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, after having drawn her breath very\r\nsadly in and sent it very sadly out, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had half your failing\r\nthat way. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a great protection to a poor maid in these illegit\xe2\x80\x99mate\r\ndays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\nBLAME\xe2\x80\x94FURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of getting out of the way of\r\nMr. Boldwood in the event of his returning to answer her note in\r\nperson, proceeded to fulfil an engagement made with Liddy some few\r\nhours earlier. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s companion, as a gauge of their\r\nreconciliation, had been granted a week\xe2\x80\x99s holiday to visit her sister,\r\nwho was married to a thriving hurdler and cattle-crib-maker living in a\r\ndelightful labyrinth of hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury. The\r\narrangement was that Miss Everdene should honour them by coming there\r\nfor a day or two to inspect some ingenious contrivances which this man\r\nof the woods had introduced into his wares.\r\n\r\nLeaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann, that they were to\r\nsee everything carefully locked up for the night, she went out of the\r\nhouse just at the close of a timely thunder-shower, which had refined\r\nthe air, and daintily bathed the coat of the land, though all beneath\r\nwas dry as ever. Freshness was exhaled in an essence from the varied\r\ncontours of bank and hollow, as if the earth breathed maiden breath;\r\nand the pleased birds were hymning to the scene. Before her, among the\r\nclouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of fierce light\r\nwhich showed themselves in the neighbourhood of a hidden sun, lingering\r\non to the farthest north-west corner of the heavens that this midsummer\r\nseason allowed.\r\n\r\nShe had walked nearly two miles of her journey, watching how the day\r\nwas retreating, and thinking how the time of deeds was quietly melting\r\ninto the time of thought, to give place in its turn to the time of\r\nprayer and sleep, when she beheld advancing over Yalbury hill the very\r\nman she sought so anxiously to elude. Boldwood was stepping on, not\r\nwith that quiet tread of reserved strength which was his customary\r\ngait, in which he always seemed to be balancing two thoughts. His\r\nmanner was stunned and sluggish now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood had for the first time been awakened to woman\xe2\x80\x99s privileges in\r\ntergiversation even when it involves another person\xe2\x80\x99s possible blight.\r\nThat Bathsheba was a firm and positive girl, far less inconsequent than\r\nher fellows, had been the very lung of his hope; for he had held that\r\nthese qualities would lead her to adhere to a straight course for\r\nconsistency\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and accept him, though her fancy might not flood\r\nhim with the iridescent hues of uncritical love. But the argument now\r\ncame back as sorry gleams from a broken mirror. The discovery was no\r\nless a scourge than a surprise.\r\n\r\nHe came on looking upon the ground, and did not see Bathsheba till they\r\nwere less than a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw apart. He looked up at the sound of her\r\npit-pat, and his changed appearance sufficiently denoted to her the\r\ndepth and strength of the feelings paralyzed by her letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d she faltered, a guilty warmth pulsing in\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nThose who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a means\r\nmore effective than words. There are accents in the eye which are not\r\non the tongue, and more tales come from pale lips than can enter an\r\near. It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter moods that\r\nthey avoid the pathway of sound. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s look was unanswerable.\r\n\r\nSeeing she turned a little aside, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are you afraid of\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancied you looked so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is most strange, because of\r\nits contrast with my feeling for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe regained self-possession, fixed her eyes calmly, and waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what that feeling is,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Boldwood, deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nthing strong as death. No dismissal by a hasty letter affects that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you did not feel so strongly about me,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\ngenerous of you, and more than I deserve, but I must not hear it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear it? What do you think I have to say, then? I am not to marry you,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Your letter was excellently plain. I want you to\r\nhear nothing\xe2\x80\x94not I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for\r\nfreeing herself from this fearfully awkward position. She confusedly\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening,\xe2\x80\x9d and was moving on. Boldwood walked up to her\r\nheavily and dully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba\xe2\x80\x94darling\xe2\x80\x94is it final indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x94have pity upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood burst out. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nyes\xe2\x80\x94I am come to that low, lowest stage\xe2\x80\x94to ask a woman for pity! Still,\r\nshe is you\xe2\x80\x94she is you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba commanded herself well. But she could hardly get a clear\r\nvoice for what came instinctively to her lips: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is little honour\r\nto the woman in that speech.\xe2\x80\x9d It was only whispered, for something\r\nunutterably mournful no less than distressing in this spectacle of a\r\nman showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a passion enervated\r\nthe feminine instinct for punctilios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am beyond myself about this, and am mad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am no stoic at\r\nall to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you. I wish you\r\nknew what is in me of devotion to you; but it is impossible, that. In\r\nbare human mercy to a lonely man, don\xe2\x80\x99t throw me off now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t throw you off\xe2\x80\x94indeed, how can I? I never had you.\xe2\x80\x9d In her\r\nnoon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment\r\nher thoughtless angle on that day in February.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was a time when you turned to me, before I thought of you! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold\r\ndarkness that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by\r\nthat letter\xe2\x80\x94valentine you call it\xe2\x80\x94would have been worse than my\r\nknowledge of you, though it has brought this misery. But, I say, there\r\nwas a time when I knew nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and\r\nyet you drew me on. And if you say you gave me no encouragement, I\r\ncannot but contradict you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you call encouragement was the childish game of an idle minute. I\r\nhave bitterly repented of it\xe2\x80\x94ay, bitterly, and in tears. Can you still\r\ngo on reminding me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t accuse you of it\xe2\x80\x94I deplore it. I took for earnest what you\r\ninsist was jest, and now this that I pray to be jest you say is awful,\r\nwretched earnest. Our moods meet at wrong places. I wish your feeling\r\nwas more like mine, or my feeling more like yours! Oh, could I but have\r\nforeseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into, how\r\nI should have cursed you; but only having been able to see it since, I\r\ncannot do that, for I love you too well! But it is weak, idle\r\ndrivelling to go on like this.... Bathsheba, you are the first woman of\r\nany shade or nature that I have ever looked at to love, and it is the\r\nhaving been so near claiming you for my own that makes this denial so\r\nhard to bear. How nearly you promised me! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak now to move\r\nyour heart, and make you grieve because of my pain; it is no use, that.\r\nI must bear it; my pain would get no less by paining you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do pity you\xe2\x80\x94deeply\xe2\x80\x94O, so deeply!\xe2\x80\x9d she earnestly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo no such thing\xe2\x80\x94do no such thing. Your dear love, Bathsheba, is such\r\na vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as well as\r\nyour love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the gain of your\r\npity make it sensibly less. O sweet\xe2\x80\x94how dearly you spoke to me behind\r\nthe spear-bed at the washing-pool, and in the barn at the shearing, and\r\nthat dearest last time in the evening at your home! Where are your\r\npleasant words all gone\xe2\x80\x94your earnest hope to be able to love me? Where\r\nis your firm conviction that you would get to care for me very much?\r\nReally forgotten?\xe2\x80\x94really?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe checked emotion, looked him quietly and clearly in the face, and\r\nsaid in her low, firm voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Boldwood, I promised you nothing.\r\nWould you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,\r\nhighest compliment a man can pay a woman\xe2\x80\x94telling her he loves her? I\r\nwas bound to show some feeling, if I would not be a graceless shrew.\r\nYet each of those pleasures was just for the day\xe2\x80\x94the day just for the\r\npleasure. How was I to know that what is a pastime to all other men was\r\ndeath to you? Have reason, do, and think more kindly of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind arguing\xe2\x80\x94never mind. One thing is sure: you were all\r\nbut mine, and now you are not nearly mine. Everything is changed, and\r\nthat by you alone, remember. You were nothing to me once, and I was\r\ncontented; you are now nothing to me again, and how different the\r\nsecond nothing is from the first! Would to God you had never taken me\r\nup, since it was only to throw me down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba, in spite of her mettle, began to feel unmistakable signs\r\nthat she was inherently the weaker vessel. She strove miserably against\r\nthis femininity which would insist upon supplying unbidden emotions in\r\nstronger and stronger current. She had tried to elude agitation by\r\nfixing her mind on the trees, sky, any trivial object before her eyes,\r\nwhilst his reproaches fell, but ingenuity could not save her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not take you up\xe2\x80\x94surely I did not!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered as heroically as\r\nshe could. \xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t be in this mood with me. I can endure being told\r\nI am in the wrong, if you will only tell it me gently! O sir, will you\r\nnot kindly forgive me, and look at it cheerfully?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheerfully! Can a man fooled to utter heart-burning find a reason for\r\nbeing merry? If I have lost, how can I be as if I had won? Heavens you\r\nmust be heartless quite! Had I known what a fearfully bitter sweet this\r\nwas to be, how I would have avoided you, and never seen you, and been\r\ndeaf of you. I tell you all this, but what do you care! You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe returned silent and weak denials to his charges, and swayed her\r\nhead desperately, as if to thrust away the words as they came showering\r\nabout her ears from the lips of the trembling man in the climax of\r\nlife, with his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDearest, dearest, I am wavering even now between the two opposites of\r\nrecklessly renouncing you, and labouring humbly for you again. Forget\r\nthat you have said No, and let it be as it was! Say, Bathsheba, that\r\nyou only wrote that refusal to me in fun\xe2\x80\x94come, say it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be untrue, and painful to both of us. You overrate my\r\ncapacity for love. I don\xe2\x80\x99t possess half the warmth of nature you\r\nbelieve me to have. An unprotected childhood in a cold world has beaten\r\ngentleness out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe immediately said with more resentment: \xe2\x80\x9cThat may be true, somewhat;\r\nbut ah, Miss Everdene, it won\xe2\x80\x99t do as a reason! You are not the cold\r\nwoman you would have me believe. No, no! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t because you have no\r\nfeeling in you that you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me. You naturally would have me\r\nthink so\xe2\x80\x94you would hide from me that you have a burning heart like\r\nmine. You have love enough, but it is turned into a new channel. I know\r\nwhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe swift music of her heart became hubbub now, and she throbbed to\r\nextremity. He was coming to Troy. He did then know what had occurred!\r\nAnd the name fell from his lips the next moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did Troy not leave my treasure alone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, fiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\r\nhad no thought of injuring him, why did he force himself upon your\r\nnotice! Before he worried you your inclination was to have me; when\r\nnext I should have come to you your answer would have been Yes. Can you\r\ndeny it\xe2\x80\x94I ask, can you deny it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe delayed the reply, but was too honest to withhold it. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you cannot. But he stole in in my absence and robbed me. Why\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t he win you away before, when nobody would have been\r\ngrieved?\xe2\x80\x94when nobody would have been set tale-bearing. Now the people\r\nsneer at me\xe2\x80\x94the very hills and sky seem to laugh at me till I blush\r\nshamefully for my folly. I have lost my respect, my good name, my\r\nstanding\xe2\x80\x94lost it, never to get it again. Go and marry your man\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh sir\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Boldwood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may as well. I have no further claim upon you. As for me, I had\r\nbetter go somewhere alone, and hide\xe2\x80\x94and pray. I loved a woman once. I\r\nam now ashamed. When I am dead they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, miserable love-sick man\r\nthat he was. Heaven\xe2\x80\x94heaven\xe2\x80\x94if I had got jilted secretly, and the\r\ndishonour not known, and my position kept! But no matter, it is gone,\r\nand the woman not gained. Shame upon him\xe2\x80\x94shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis unreasonable anger terrified her, and she glided from him, without\r\nobviously moving, as she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI am only a girl\xe2\x80\x94do not speak to me\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the time you knew\xe2\x80\x94how very well you knew\xe2\x80\x94that your new freak was\r\nmy misery. Dazzled by brass and scarlet\xe2\x80\x94Oh, Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x94this is woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfolly indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fired up at once. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are taking too much upon yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is upon me\xe2\x80\x94everybody. It is unmanly to\r\nattack a woman so! I have nobody in the world to fight my battles for\r\nme; but no mercy is shown. Yet if a thousand of you sneer and say\r\nthings against me, I _will not_ be put down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll chatter with him doubtless about me. Say to him, \xe2\x80\x98Boldwood\r\nwould have died for me.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, and you have given way to him, knowing\r\nhim to be not the man for you. He has kissed you\xe2\x80\x94claimed you as his. Do\r\nyou hear\xe2\x80\x94he has kissed you. Deny it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most tragic woman is cowed by a tragic man, and although Boldwood\r\nwas, in vehemence and glow, nearly her own self rendered into another\r\nsex, Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s cheek quivered. She gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave me, sir\xe2\x80\x94leave me! I\r\nam nothing to you. Let me go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeny that he has kissed you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa\xe2\x80\x94then he has!\xe2\x80\x9d came hoarsely from the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, slowly, and, in spite of her fear, defiantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot ashamed to speak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen curse him; and curse him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, breaking into a\r\nwhispered fury. \xe2\x80\x9cWhilst I would have given worlds to touch your hand,\r\nyou have let a rake come in without right or ceremony and\xe2\x80\x94kiss you!\r\nHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s mercy\xe2\x80\x94kiss you!... Ah, a time of his life shall come when he\r\nwill have to repent, and think wretchedly of the pain he has caused\r\nanother man; and then may he ache, and wish, and curse, and yearn\xe2\x80\x94as I\r\ndo now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t pray down evil upon him!\xe2\x80\x9d she implored in a\r\nmiserable cry. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything but that\xe2\x80\x94anything. Oh, be kind to him, sir,\r\nfor I love him true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s ideas had reached that point of fusion at which outline and\r\nconsistency entirely disappear. The impending night appeared to\r\nconcentrate in his eye. He did not hear her at all now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll punish him\xe2\x80\x94by my soul, that will I! I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet him, soldier or no,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll horsewhip the untimely stripling for this reckless theft of my\r\none delight. If he were a hundred men I\xe2\x80\x99d horsewhip him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped\r\nhis voice suddenly and unnaturally. \xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba, sweet, lost coquette,\r\npardon me! I\xe2\x80\x99ve been blaming you, threatening you, behaving like a\r\nchurl to you, when he\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest sinner. He stole your dear heart\r\naway with his unfathomable lies!... It is a fortunate thing for him\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s gone back to his regiment\xe2\x80\x94that he\xe2\x80\x99s away up the country, and\r\nnot here! I hope he may not return here just yet. I pray God he may not\r\ncome into my sight, for I may be tempted beyond myself. Oh, Bathsheba,\r\nkeep him away\xe2\x80\x94yes, keep him away from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment Boldwood stood so inertly after this that his soul seemed\r\nto have been entirely exhaled with the breath of his passionate words.\r\nHe turned his face away, and withdrew, and his form was soon covered\r\nover by the twilight as his footsteps mixed in with the low hiss of the\r\nleafy trees.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, who had been standing motionless as a model all this latter\r\ntime, flung her hands to her face, and wildly attempted to ponder on\r\nthe exhibition which had just passed away. Such astounding wells of\r\nfevered feeling in a still man like Mr. Boldwood were incomprehensible,\r\ndreadful. Instead of being a man trained to repression he was\xe2\x80\x94what she\r\nhad seen him.\r\n\r\nThe force of the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s threats lay in their relation to a\r\ncircumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming\r\nback to Weatherbury in the course of the very next day or two. Troy had\r\nnot returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others supposed,\r\nbut had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath, and had yet a\r\nweek or more remaining to his furlough.\r\n\r\nShe felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this nick\r\nof time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a fierce quarrel would be\r\nthe consequence. She panted with solicitude when she thought of\r\npossible injury to Troy. The least spark would kindle the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nswift feelings of rage and jealousy; he would lose his self-mastery as\r\nhe had this evening; Troy\xe2\x80\x99s blitheness might become aggressive; it\r\nmight take the direction of derision, and Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s anger might then\r\ntake the direction of revenge.\r\n\r\nWith almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing girl, this\r\nguileless woman too well concealed from the world under a manner of\r\ncarelessness the warm depths of her strong emotions. But now there was\r\nno reserve. In her distraction, instead of advancing further she walked\r\nup and down, beating the air with her fingers, pressing on her brow,\r\nand sobbing brokenly to herself. Then she sat down on a heap of stones\r\nby the wayside to think. There she remained long. Above the dark margin\r\nof the earth appeared foreshores and promontories of coppery cloud,\r\nbounding a green and pellucid expanse in the western sky. Amaranthine\r\nglosses came over them then, and the unresting world wheeled her round\r\nto a contrasting prospect eastward, in the shape of indecisive and\r\npalpitating stars. She gazed upon their silent throes amid the shades\r\nof space, but realised none at all. Her troubled spirit was far away\r\nwith Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\nNIGHT\xe2\x80\x94HORSES TRAMPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village of Weatherbury was quiet as the graveyard in its midst, and\r\nthe living were lying well-nigh as still as the dead. The church clock\r\nstruck eleven. The air was so empty of other sounds that the whirr of\r\nthe clock-work immediately before the strokes was distinct, and so was\r\nalso the click of the same at their close. The notes flew forth with\r\nthe usual blind obtuseness of inanimate things\xe2\x80\x94flapping and rebounding\r\namong walls, undulating against the scattered clouds, spreading through\r\ntheir interstices into unexplored miles of space.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s crannied and mouldy halls were to-night occupied only by\r\nMaryann, Liddy being, as was stated, with her sister, whom Bathsheba\r\nhad set out to visit. A few minutes after eleven had struck, Maryann\r\nturned in her bed with a sense of being disturbed. She was totally\r\nunconscious of the nature of the interruption to her sleep. It led to a\r\ndream, and the dream to an awakening, with an uneasy sensation that\r\nsomething had happened. She left her bed and looked out of the window.\r\nThe paddock abutted on this end of the building, and in the paddock she\r\ncould just discern by the uncertain gray a moving figure approaching\r\nthe horse that was feeding there. The figure seized the horse by the\r\nforelock, and led it to the corner of the field. Here she could see\r\nsome object which circumstances proved to be a vehicle, for after a few\r\nminutes spent apparently in harnessing, she heard the trot of the horse\r\ndown the road, mingled with the sound of light wheels.\r\n\r\nTwo varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with the\r\nghostlike glide of that mysterious figure. They were a woman and a\r\ngipsy man. A woman was out of the question in such an occupation at\r\nthis hour, and the comer could be no less than a thief, who might\r\nprobably have known the weakness of the household on this particular\r\nnight, and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt.\r\nMoreover, to raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies\r\nin Weatherbury Bottom.\r\n\r\nMaryann, who had been afraid to shout in the robber\xe2\x80\x99s presence, having\r\nseen him depart had no fear. She hastily slipped on her clothes,\r\nstumped down the disjointed staircase with its hundred creaks, ran to\r\nCoggan\xe2\x80\x99s, the nearest house, and raised an alarm. Coggan called\r\nGabriel, who now again lodged in his house as at first, and together\r\nthey went to the paddock. Beyond all doubt the horse was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nThey listened. Distinct upon the stagnant air came the sounds of a\r\ntrotting horse passing up Longpuddle Lane\xe2\x80\x94just beyond the gipsies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nencampment in Weatherbury Bottom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our Dainty\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear to her step,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMighty me! Won\xe2\x80\x99t mis\xe2\x80\x99ess storm and call us stupids when she comes\r\nback!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Maryann. \xe2\x80\x9cHow I wish it had happened when she was at\r\nhome, and none of us had been answerable!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must ride after,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, decisively. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be responsible to\r\nMiss Everdene for what we do. Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cAll our horses are too heavy\r\nfor that trick except little Poppet, and what\xe2\x80\x99s she between two of\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x94If we only had that pair over the hedge we might do something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich pair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s Tidy and Moll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait here till I come hither again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. He ran down\r\nthe hill towards Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Boldwood is not at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what he\xe2\x80\x99s gone for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLess than five minutes brought up Oak again, running at the same pace,\r\nwith two halters dangling from his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you find \xe2\x80\x99em?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, turning round and leaping upon\r\nthe hedge without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the eaves. I knew where they were kept,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, following\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cCoggan, you can ride bare-backed? there\xe2\x80\x99s no time to look for\r\nsaddles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a hero!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaryann, you go to bed,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel shouted to her from the top of the\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nSpringing down into Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s pastures, each pocketed his halter to\r\nhide it from the horses, who, seeing the men empty-handed, docilely\r\nallowed themselves to be seized by the mane, when the halters were\r\ndexterously slipped on. Having neither bit nor bridle, Oak and Coggan\r\nextemporized the former by passing the rope in each case through the\r\nanimal\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and looping it on the other side. Oak vaulted astride,\r\nand Coggan clambered up by aid of the bank, when they ascended to the\r\ngate and galloped off in the direction taken by Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s horse and\r\nthe robber. Whose vehicle the horse had been harnessed to was a matter\r\nof some uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWeatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes. They scanned\r\nthe shady green patch by the roadside. The gipsies were gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe villains!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich way have they gone, I wonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight on, as sure as God made little apples,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; we are better mounted, and must overtake \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x9d, said Oak.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow on at full speed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo sound of the rider in their van could now be discovered. The\r\nroad-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left behind,\r\nand the late rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but not\r\nmuddy state. They came to cross-roads. Coggan suddenly pulled up Moll\r\nand slipped off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must try to track \xe2\x80\x99em, since we can\xe2\x80\x99t hear \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan, fumbling\r\nin his pockets. He struck a light, and held the match to the ground.\r\nThe rain had been heavier here, and all foot and horse tracks made\r\nprevious to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops, and\r\nthey were now so many little scoops of water, which reflected the flame\r\nof the match like eyes. One set of tracks was fresh and had no water in\r\nthem; one pair of ruts was also empty, and not small canals, like the\r\nothers. The footprints forming this recent impression were full of\r\ninformation as to pace; they were in equidistant pairs, three or four\r\nfeet apart, the right and left foot of each pair being exactly opposite\r\none another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStraight on!\xe2\x80\x9d Jan exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cTracks like that mean a stiff gallop. No\r\nwonder we don\xe2\x80\x99t hear him. And the horse is harnessed\xe2\x80\x94look at the ruts.\r\nAy, that\xe2\x80\x99s our mare sure enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and I\xe2\x80\x99d swear to his make\r\namong ten thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest of the gipsies must ha\xe2\x80\x99 gone on earlier, or some other way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cYou saw there were no other tracks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\xe2\x80\x9d They rode along silently for a long weary time. Coggan carried\r\nan old pinchbeck repeater which he had inherited from some genius in\r\nhis family; and it now struck one. He lighted another match, and\r\nexamined the ground again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a canter now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, throwing away the light. \xe2\x80\x9cA twisty,\r\nrickety pace for a gig. The fact is, they over-drove her at starting;\r\nwe shall catch \xe2\x80\x99em yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they hastened on, and entered Blackmore Vale. Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s watch\r\nstruck one. When they looked again the hoof-marks were so spaced as to\r\nform a sort of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a trot, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a trot now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, cheerfully. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall overtake him in\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJan. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see how she was driven up this hill. \xe2\x80\x99Twill help us.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nlight was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and the\r\nexamination made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cShe walked up here\xe2\x80\x94and well she might. We shall\r\nget them in two miles, for a crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rode three, and listened. No sound was to be heard save a millpond\r\ntrickling hoarsely through a hatch, and suggesting gloomy possibilities\r\nof drowning by jumping in. Gabriel dismounted when they came to a\r\nturning. The tracks were absolutely the only guide as to the direction\r\nthat they now had, and great caution was necessary to avoid confusing\r\nthem with some others which had made their appearance lately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x94though I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, looking up at\r\nCoggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning. Coggan,\r\nwho, no less than the panting horses, had latterly shown signs of\r\nweariness, again scrutinized the mystic characters. This time only\r\nthree were of the regular horseshoe shape. Every fourth was a dot.\r\n\r\nHe screwed up his face and emitted a long \xe2\x80\x9cWhew-w-w!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLame,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Dainty is lamed; the near-foot-afore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan slowly,\r\nstaring still at the footprints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll push on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, remounting his humid steed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the road along its greater part had been as good as any\r\nturnpike-road in the country, it was nominally only a byway. The last\r\nturning had brought them into the high road leading to Bath. Coggan\r\nrecollected himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have him now!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSherton Turnpike. The keeper of that gate is the sleepiest man between\r\nhere and London\xe2\x80\x94Dan Randall, that\xe2\x80\x99s his name\xe2\x80\x94knowed en for years, when\r\nhe was at Casterbridge gate. Between the lameness and the gate \xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\ndone job.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey now advanced with extreme caution. Nothing was said until, against\r\na shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible, crossing\r\ntheir route a little way ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush\xe2\x80\x94we are almost close!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmble on upon the grass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\nThe white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in front\r\nof them. The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an exclamation\r\nfrom that quarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoy-a-hoy! Gate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not\r\nnoticed, for on their close approach the door of the turnpike-house\r\nopened, and the keeper came out half-dressed, with a candle in his\r\nhand. The rays illumined the whole group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep the gate close!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has stolen the horse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnpike-man.\r\n\r\nGabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a woman\xe2\x80\x94Bathsheba, his\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nOn hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.\r\nCoggan had, however, caught sight of her in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99tis mistress\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, amazed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba it certainly was, and she had by this time done the trick she\r\ncould do so well in crises not of love, namely, mask a surprise by\r\ncoolness of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she inquired quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d began Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am driving to Bath,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, taking for her own use the assurance\r\nthat Gabriel lacked. \xe2\x80\x9cAn important matter made it necessary for me to\r\ngive up my visit to Liddy, and go off at once. What, then, were you\r\nfollowing me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought the horse was stole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94what a thing! How very foolish of you not to know that I had\r\ntaken the trap and horse. I could neither wake Maryann nor get into the\r\nhouse, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.\r\nFortunately, I could get the key of the coach-house, so I troubled no\r\none further. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you think it might be me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. Why, those are never Farmer Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s horses! Goodness\r\nmercy! what have you been doing\xe2\x80\x94bringing trouble upon me in this way?\r\nWhat! mustn\xe2\x80\x99t a lady move an inch from her door without being dogged\r\nlike a thief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how was we to know, if you left no account of your doings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexpostulated Coggan, \xe2\x80\x9cand ladies don\xe2\x80\x99t drive at these hours, miss, as a\r\njineral rule of society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did leave an account\xe2\x80\x94and you would have seen it in the morning. I\r\nwrote in chalk on the coach-house doors that I had come back for the\r\nhorse and gig, and driven off; that I could arouse nobody, and should\r\nreturn soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that till it got\r\ndaylight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and though vexed at first she had too much sense to\r\nblame them long or seriously for a devotion to her that was as valuable\r\nas it was rare. She added with a very pretty grace, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I really\r\nthank you heartily for taking all this trouble; but I wish you had\r\nborrowed anybody\xe2\x80\x99s horses but Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDainty is lame, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cCan ye go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a stone in her shoe. I got down and pulled it out a\r\nhundred yards back. I can manage very well, thank you. I shall be in\r\nBath by daylight. Will you now return, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her head\xe2\x80\x94the gateman\xe2\x80\x99s candle shimmering upon her quick,\r\nclear eyes as she did so\xe2\x80\x94passed through the gate, and was soon wrapped\r\nin the embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs. Coggan and\r\nGabriel put about their horses, and, fanned by the velvety air of this\r\nJuly night, retraced the road by which they had come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange vagary, this of hers, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan,\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t be in Bath by no daylight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoggan, suppose we keep this night\xe2\x80\x99s work as quiet as we can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am of one and the same mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. We shall be home by three o\xe2\x80\x99clock or so, and can creep into\r\nthe parish like lambs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s perturbed meditations by the roadside had ultimately\r\nevolved a conclusion that there were only two remedies for the present\r\ndesperate state of affairs. The first was merely to keep Troy away from\r\nWeatherbury till Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s indignation had cooled; the second to\r\nlisten to Oak\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties, and Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s denunciations, and give up\r\nTroy altogether.\r\n\r\nAlas! Could she give up this new love\xe2\x80\x94induce him to renounce her by\r\nsaying she did not like him\xe2\x80\x94could no more speak to him, and beg him,\r\nfor her good, to end his furlough in Bath, and see her and Weatherbury\r\nno more?\r\n\r\nIt was a picture full of misery, but for a while she contemplated it\r\nfirmly, allowing herself, nevertheless, as girls will, to dwell upon\r\nthe happy life she would have enjoyed had Troy been Boldwood, and the\r\npath of love the path of duty\xe2\x80\x94inflicting upon herself gratuitous\r\ntortures by imagining him the lover of another woman after forgetting\r\nher; for she had penetrated Troy\xe2\x80\x99s nature so far as to estimate his\r\ntendencies pretty accurately, but unfortunately loved him no less in\r\nthinking that he might soon cease to love her\xe2\x80\x94indeed, considerably\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe jumped to her feet. She would see him at once. Yes, she would\r\nimplore him by word of mouth to assist her in this dilemma. A letter to\r\nkeep him away could not reach him in time, even if he should be\r\ndisposed to listen to it.\r\n\r\nWas Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support of\r\na lover\xe2\x80\x99s arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a resolve to\r\nrenounce him? Or was she sophistically sensible, with a thrill of\r\npleasure, that by adopting this course for getting rid of him she was\r\nensuring a meeting with him, at any rate, once more?\r\n\r\nIt was now dark, and the hour must have been nearly ten. The only way\r\nto accomplish her purpose was to give up her idea of visiting Liddy at\r\nYalbury, return to Weatherbury Farm, put the horse into the gig, and\r\ndrive at once to Bath. The scheme seemed at first impossible: the\r\njourney was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong horse, at her own\r\nestimate; and she much underrated the distance. It was most venturesome\r\nfor a woman, at night, and alone.\r\n\r\nBut could she go on to Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s and leave things to take their course?\r\nNo, no; anything but that. Bathsheba was full of a stimulating\r\nturbulence, beside which caution vainly prayed for a hearing. She\r\nturned back towards the village.\r\n\r\nHer walk was slow, for she wished not to enter Weatherbury till the\r\ncottagers were in bed, and, particularly, till Boldwood was secure. Her\r\nplan was now to drive to Bath during the night, see Sergeant Troy in\r\nthe morning before he set out to come to her, bid him farewell, and\r\ndismiss him: then to rest the horse thoroughly (herself to weep the\r\nwhile, she thought), starting early the next morning on her return\r\njourney. By this arrangement she could trot Dainty gently all the day,\r\nreach Liddy at Yalbury in the evening, and come home to Weatherbury\r\nwith her whenever they chose\xe2\x80\x94so nobody would know she had been to Bath\r\nat all. Such was Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s scheme. But in her topographical ignorance\r\nas a late comer to the place, she misreckoned the distance of her\r\njourney as not much more than half what it really was.\r\n\r\nThis idea she proceeded to carry out, with what initial success we have\r\nalready seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\nIN THE SUN\xe2\x80\x94A HARBINGER\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed, and there were no tidings of Bathsheba; nor was there\r\nany explanation of her Gilpin\xe2\x80\x99s rig.\r\n\r\nThen a note came for Maryann, stating that the business which had\r\ncalled her mistress to Bath still detained her there; but that she\r\nhoped to return in the course of another week.\r\n\r\nAnother week passed. The oat-harvest began, and all the men were\r\na-field under a monochromatic Lammas sky, amid the trembling air and\r\nshort shadows of noon. Indoors nothing was to be heard save the droning\r\nof blue-bottle flies; out-of-doors the whetting of scythes and the hiss\r\nof tressy oat-ears rubbing together as their perpendicular stalks of\r\namber-yellow fell heavily to each swath. Every drop of moisture not in\r\nthe men\xe2\x80\x99s bottles and flagons in the form of cider was raining as\r\nperspiration from their foreheads and cheeks. Drought was everywhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThey were about to withdraw for a while into the charitable shade of a\r\ntree in the fence, when Coggan saw a figure in a blue coat and brass\r\nbuttons running to them across the field.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who that is?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope nothing is wrong about mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maryann, who with some\r\nother women was tying the bundles (oats being always sheafed on this\r\nfarm), \xe2\x80\x9cbut an unlucky token came to me indoors this morning. I went to\r\nunlock the door and dropped the key, and it fell upon the stone floor\r\nand broke into two pieces. Breaking a key is a dreadful bodement. I\r\nwish mis\xe2\x80\x99ess was home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis Cain Ball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, pausing from whetting his reaphook.\r\n\r\nOak was not bound by his agreement to assist in the corn-field; but the\r\nharvest month is an anxious time for a farmer, and the corn was\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s, so he lent a hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dressed up in his best clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Moon. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hev been\r\naway from home for a few days, since he\xe2\x80\x99s had that felon upon his\r\nfinger; for \xe2\x80\x99a said, since I can\xe2\x80\x99t work I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a hollerday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good time for one\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x99 excellent time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass,\r\nstraightening his back; for he, like some of the others, had a way of\r\nresting a while from his labour on such hot days for reasons\r\npreternaturally small; of which Cain Ball\xe2\x80\x99s advent on a week-day in his\r\nSunday-clothes was one of the first magnitude. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas a bad leg allowed\r\nme to read the _Pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s Progress_, and Mark Clark learnt All-Fours in\r\na whitlow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and my father put his arm out of joint to have time to go\r\ncourting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan Coggan, in an eclipsing tone, wiping his face with\r\nhis shirt-sleeve and thrusting back his hat upon the nape of his neck.\r\n\r\nBy this time Cainy was nearing the group of harvesters, and was\r\nperceived to be carrying a large slice of bread and ham in one hand,\r\nfrom which he took mouthfuls as he ran, the other being wrapped in a\r\nbandage. When he came close, his mouth assumed the bell shape, and he\r\nbegan to cough violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Cainy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many more times must I tell\r\nyou to keep from running so fast when you be eating? You\xe2\x80\x99ll choke\r\nyourself some day, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Cain Ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHok-hok-hok!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cain. \xe2\x80\x9cA crumb of my victuals went the wrong\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94hok-hok! That\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis, Mister Oak! And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been visiting to\r\nBath because I had a felon on my thumb; yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\xe2\x80\x94ahok-hok!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDirectly Cain mentioned Bath, they all threw down their hooks and forks\r\nand drew round him. Unfortunately the erratic crumb did not improve his\r\nnarrative powers, and a supplementary hindrance was that of a sneeze,\r\njerking from his pocket his rather large watch, which dangled in front\r\nof the young man pendulum-wise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, directing his thoughts to Bath and letting his\r\neyes follow, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seed the world at last\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seed our\r\nmis\xe2\x80\x99ess\xe2\x80\x94ahok-hok-hok!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething is always going the wrong\r\nway down your throat, so that you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to be\r\ntold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhok! there! Please, Mister Oak, a gnat have just fleed into my\r\nstomach and brought the cough on again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s just it. Your mouth is always open, you young rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis terrible bad to have a gnat fly down yer throat, pore boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMatthew Moon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at Bath you saw\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d prompted Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw our mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the junior shepherd, \xe2\x80\x9cand a sojer,\r\nwalking along. And bymeby they got closer and closer, and then they\r\nwent arm-in-crook, like courting complete\xe2\x80\x94hok-hok! like courting\r\ncomplete\xe2\x80\x94hok!\xe2\x80\x94courting complete\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Losing the thread of his narrative at\r\nthis point simultaneously with his loss of breath, their informant\r\nlooked up and down the field apparently for some clue to it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\nsee our mis\xe2\x80\x99ess and a soldier\xe2\x80\x94a-ha-a-wk!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis only my manner, Mister Oak, if ye\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cain Ball,\r\nlooking reproachfully at Oak, with eyes drenched in their own dew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s some cider for him\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99ll cure his throat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan Coggan,\r\nlifting a flagon of cider, pulling out the cork, and applying the hole\r\nto Cainy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth; Joseph Poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think\r\napprehensively of the serious consequences that would follow Cainy\r\nBall\xe2\x80\x99s strangulation in his cough, and the history of his Bath\r\nadventures dying with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my poor self, I always say \xe2\x80\x98please God\xe2\x80\x99 afore I do anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoseph, in an unboastful voice; \xe2\x80\x9cand so should you, Cain Ball. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a\r\ngreat safeguard, and might perhaps save you from being choked to death\r\nsome day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liberality at the suffering\r\nCain\xe2\x80\x99s circular mouth; half of it running down the side of the flagon,\r\nand half of what reached his mouth running down outside his throat, and\r\nhalf of what ran in going the wrong way, and being coughed and sneezed\r\naround the persons of the gathered reapers in the form of a cider fog,\r\nwhich for a moment hung in the sunny air like a small exhalation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a great clumsy sneeze! Why can\xe2\x80\x99t ye have better manners, you\r\nyoung dog!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, withdrawing the flagon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cider went up my nose!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cainy, as soon as he could speak;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand now \xe2\x80\x99tis gone down my neck, and into my poor dumb felon, and over\r\nmy shiny buttons and all my best cloze!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s cough is terrible unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Moon. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\na great history on hand, too. Bump his back, shepherd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis my nater,\xe2\x80\x9d mourned Cain. \xe2\x80\x9cMother says I always was so excitable\r\nwhen my feelings were worked up to a point!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Balls were always a very\r\nexcitable family. I knowed the boy\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather\xe2\x80\x94a truly nervous and\r\nmodest man, even to genteel refinery. \xe2\x80\x99Twas blush, blush with him,\r\nalmost as much as \xe2\x80\x99tis with me\xe2\x80\x94not but that \xe2\x80\x99tis a fault in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, Master Poorgrass,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a very noble quality\r\nin ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeh-heh! well, I wish to noise nothing abroad\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmurmured Poorgrass, diffidently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we be born to things\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\r\nYet I would rather my trifle were hid; though, perhaps, a high nater is\r\na little high, and at my birth all things were possible to my Maker,\r\nand he may have begrudged no gifts.... But under your bushel, Joseph!\r\nunder your bushel with \xe2\x80\x99ee! A strange desire, neighbours, this desire\r\nto hide, and no praise due. Yet there is a Sermon on the Mount with a\r\ncalendar of the blessed at the head, and certain meek men may be named\r\ntherein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCainy\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather was a very clever man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Moon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvented a\xe2\x80\x99 apple-tree out of his own head, which is called by his\r\nname to this day\xe2\x80\x94the Early Ball. You know \xe2\x80\x99em, Jan? A Quarrenden\r\ngrafted on a Tom Putt, and a Rathe-ripe upon top o\xe2\x80\x99 that again. \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\ntrew \xe2\x80\x99a used to bide about in a public-house wi\xe2\x80\x99 a \xe2\x80\x99ooman in a way he\r\nhad no business to by rights, but there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99a were a clever man in the\r\nsense of the term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat did you see, Cain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI seed our mis\xe2\x80\x99ess go into a sort of a park place, where there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseats, and shrubs and flowers, arm-in-crook with a sojer,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nCainy, firmly, and with a dim sense that his words were very effective\r\nas regarded Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s emotions. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think the sojer was Sergeant\r\nTroy. And they sat there together for more than half-an-hour, talking\r\nmoving things, and she once was crying a\xe2\x80\x99most to death. And when they\r\ncame out her eyes were shining and she was as white as a lily; and they\r\nlooked into one another\xe2\x80\x99s faces, as far-gone friendly as a man and\r\nwoman can be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s features seemed to get thinner. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did you see\r\nbesides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all sorts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhite as a lily? You are sure \xe2\x80\x99twas she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat glass windows to the shops, and great clouds in the sky, full of\r\nrain, and old wooden trees in the country round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stun-poll! What will ye say next?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet en alone,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Joseph Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s meaning is that\r\nthe sky and the earth in the kingdom of Bath is not altogether\r\ndifferent from ours here. \xe2\x80\x99Tis for our good to gain knowledge of\r\nstrange cities, and as such the boy\xe2\x80\x99s words should be suffered, so to\r\nspeak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the people of Bath,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Cain, \xe2\x80\x9cnever need to light their\r\nfires except as a luxury, for the water springs up out of the earth\r\nready boiled for use.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis true as the light,\xe2\x80\x9d testified Matthew Moon. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard other\r\nnavigators say the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey drink nothing else there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cain, \xe2\x80\x9cand seem to enjoy it, to\r\nsee how they swaller it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it seems a barbarian practice enough to us, but I daresay the\r\nnatives think nothing o\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t victuals spring up as well as drink?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Coggan, twirling\r\nhis eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I own to a blot there in Bath\xe2\x80\x94a true blot. God didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide \xe2\x80\x99em\r\nwith victuals as well as drink, and \xe2\x80\x99twas a drawback I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nover at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, \xe2\x80\x99tis a curious place, to say the least,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Moon; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\r\nmust be a curious people that live therein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Everdene and the soldier were walking about together, you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Gabriel, returning to the group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and she wore a beautiful gold-colour silk gown, trimmed with black\r\nlace, that would have stood alone \xe2\x80\x99ithout legs inside if required.\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Twas a very winsome sight; and her hair was brushed splendid. And when\r\nthe sun shone upon the bright gown and his red coat\xe2\x80\x94my! how handsome\r\nthey looked. You could see \xe2\x80\x99em all the length of the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I went into Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s to hae my boots hobbed, and then I went\r\nto Riggs\xe2\x80\x99s batty-cake shop, and asked \xe2\x80\x99em for a penneth of the cheapest\r\nand nicest stales, that were all but blue-mouldy, but not quite. And\r\nwhilst I was chawing \xe2\x80\x99em down I walked on and seed a clock with a face\r\nas big as a baking trendle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to that, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll leave me alone, Mister Oak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremonstrated Cainy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you excites me, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll bring on my\r\ncough, and then I shan\xe2\x80\x99t be able to tell ye nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94let him tell it his own way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\nGabriel settled into a despairing attitude of patience, and Cainy went\r\non:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there were great large houses, and more people all the week long\r\nthan at Weatherbury club-walking on White Tuesdays. And I went to grand\r\nchurches and chapels. And how the parson would pray! Yes; he would\r\nkneel down and put up his hands together, and make the holy gold rings\r\non his fingers gleam and twinkle in yer eyes, that he\xe2\x80\x99d earned by\r\npraying so excellent well!\xe2\x80\x94Ah yes, I wish I lived there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur poor Parson Thirdly can\xe2\x80\x99t get no money to buy such rings,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMatthew Moon, thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as good a man as ever walked. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve poor Thirdly have a single one, even of humblest tin or copper.\r\nSuch a great ornament as they\xe2\x80\x99d be to him on a dull afternoon, when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s up in the pulpit lighted by the wax candles! But \xe2\x80\x99tis impossible,\r\npoor man. Ah, to think how unequal things be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s made of different stuff than to wear \xe2\x80\x99em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel,\r\ngrimly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough of this. Go on, Cainy\xe2\x80\x94quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94and the new style of parsons wear moustaches and long beards,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the illustrious traveller, \xe2\x80\x9cand look like Moses and Aaron\r\ncomplete, and make we fokes in the congregation feel all over like the\r\nchildren of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very right feeling\xe2\x80\x94very,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s two religions going on in the nation now\xe2\x80\x94High Church and\r\nHigh Chapel. And, thinks I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll play fair; so I went to High Church in\r\nthe morning, and High Chapel in the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA right and proper boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at High Church they pray singing, and worship all the colours of\r\nthe rainbow; and at High Chapel they pray preaching, and worship drab\r\nand whitewash only. And then\xe2\x80\x94I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see no more of Miss Everdene at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so afore, then?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Oak, with much\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Moon, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99ll wish her cake dough if so be she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover intimate with that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s not over intimate with him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe would know better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cOur mis\xe2\x80\x99ess has too much sense\r\nunder they knots of black hair to do such a mad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a coarse, ignorant man, for he was well brought up,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Matthew, dubiously. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas only wildness that made him a soldier,\r\nand maids rather like your man of sin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Cain Ball,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel restlessly, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you swear in the most\r\nawful form that the woman you saw was Miss Everdene?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain Ball, you be no longer a babe and suckling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph in the\r\nsepulchral tone the circumstances demanded, \xe2\x80\x9cand you know what taking\r\nan oath is. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a horrible testament mind ye, which you say and seal\r\nwith your blood-stone, and the prophet Matthew tells us that on\r\nwhomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder. Now, before all\r\nthe work-folk here assembled, can you swear to your words as the\r\nshepherd asks ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease no, Mister Oak!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cainy, looking from one to the other with\r\ngreat uneasiness at the spiritual magnitude of the position. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind saying \xe2\x80\x99tis true, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say \xe2\x80\x99tis damn true, if\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what you mane.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain, Cain, how can you!\xe2\x80\x9d asked Joseph sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou be asked to swear\r\nin a holy manner, and you swear like wicked Shimei, the son of Gera,\r\nwho cursed as he came. Young man, fie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t! \xe2\x80\x99Tis you want to squander a pore boy\xe2\x80\x99s soul, Joseph\r\nPoorgrass\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cain, beginning to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I mane\r\nis that in common truth \xe2\x80\x99twas Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy, but in\r\nthe horrible so-help-me truth that ye want to make of it perhaps \xe2\x80\x99twas\r\nsomebody else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no getting at the rights of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, turning to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain Ball, you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to a bit of bread!\xe2\x80\x9d groaned Joseph Poorgrass.\r\n\r\nThen the reapers\xe2\x80\x99 hooks were flourished again, and the old sounds went\r\non. Gabriel, without making any pretence of being lively, did nothing\r\nto show that he was particularly dull. However, Coggan knew pretty\r\nnearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook together he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take on about her, Gabriel. What difference does it make whose\r\nsweetheart she is, since she can\xe2\x80\x99t be yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the very thing I say to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\nHOME AGAIN\xe2\x80\x94A TRICKSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngarden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey before retiring to rest.\r\n\r\nA vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of\r\nthe lane. From it spread the tones of two women talking. The tones were\r\nnatural and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the voices to be\r\nthose of Bathsheba and Liddy.\r\n\r\nThe carriage came opposite and passed by. It was Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s gig,\r\nand Liddy and her mistress were the only occupants of the seat. Liddy\r\nwas asking questions about the city of Bath, and her companion was\r\nanswering them listlessly and unconcernedly. Both Bathsheba and the\r\nhorse seemed weary.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite relief of finding that she was here again, safe and\r\nsound, overpowered all reflection, and Oak could only luxuriate in the\r\nsense of it. All grave reports were forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe lingered and lingered on, till there was no difference between the\r\neastern and western expanses of sky, and the timid hares began to limp\r\ncourageously round the dim hillocks. Gabriel might have been there an\r\nadditional half-hour when a dark form walked slowly by. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\r\nGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d the passer said.\r\n\r\nIt was Boldwood. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nBoldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak shortly afterwards\r\nturned indoors to bed.\r\n\r\nFarmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s house. He reached the\r\nfront, and approaching the entrance, saw a light in the parlour. The\r\nblind was not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba, looking\r\nover some papers or letters. Her back was towards Boldwood. He went to\r\nthe door, knocked, and waited with tense muscles and an aching brow.\r\n\r\nBoldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with\r\nBathsheba in the road to Yalbury. Silent and alone, he had remained in\r\nmoody meditation on woman\xe2\x80\x99s ways, deeming as essentials of the whole\r\nsex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever closely\r\nbeheld. By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded him, and this\r\nwas the reason of his sally to-night. He had come to apologize and beg\r\nforgiveness of Bathsheba with something like a sense of shame at his\r\nviolence, having but just now learnt that she had returned\xe2\x80\x94only from a\r\nvisit to Liddy, as he supposed, the Bath escapade being quite unknown\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe inquired for Miss Everdene. Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s manner was odd, but he did not\r\nnotice it. She went in, leaving him standing there, and in her absence\r\nthe blind of the room containing Bathsheba was pulled down. Boldwood\r\naugured ill from that sign. Liddy came out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress cannot see you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe farmer instantly went out by the gate. He was unforgiven\xe2\x80\x94that was\r\nthe issue of it all. He had seen her who was to him simultaneously a\r\ndelight and a torture, sitting in the room he had shared with her as a\r\npeculiarly privileged guest only a little earlier in the summer, and\r\nshe had denied him an entrance there now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood did not hurry homeward. It was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at least, when,\r\nwalking deliberately through the lower part of Weatherbury, he heard\r\nthe carrier\xe2\x80\x99s spring van entering the village. The van ran to and from\r\na town in a northern direction, and it was owned and driven by a\r\nWeatherbury man, at the door of whose house it now pulled up. The lamp\r\nfixed to the head of the hood illuminated a scarlet and gilded form,\r\nwho was the first to alight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood to himself, \xe2\x80\x9ccome to see her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy entered the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s house, which had been the place of his\r\nlodging on his last visit to his native place. Boldwood was moved by a\r\nsudden determination. He hastened home. In ten minutes he was back\r\nagain, and made as if he were going to call upon Troy at the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nBut as he approached, some one opened the door and came out. He heard\r\nthis person say \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night\xe2\x80\x9d to the inmates, and the voice was Troy\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThis was strange, coming so immediately after his arrival. Boldwood,\r\nhowever, hastened up to him. Troy had what appeared to be a carpet-bag\r\nin his hand\xe2\x80\x94the same that he had brought with him. It seemed as if he\r\nwere going to leave again this very night.\r\n\r\nTroy turned up the hill and quickened his pace. Boldwood stepped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergeant Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m Sergeant Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust arrived from up the country, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust arrived from Bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am William Boldwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted to\r\nbring Boldwood to the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to speak a word with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout her who lives just ahead there\xe2\x80\x94and about a woman you have\r\nwronged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder at your impertinence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, moving on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, standing in front of him, \xe2\x80\x9cwonder or\r\nnot, you are going to hold a conversation with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy heard the dull determination in Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s voice, looked at his\r\nstalwart frame, then at the thick cudgel he carried in his hand. He\r\nremembered it was past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It seemed worth while to be civil\r\nto Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll listen with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, placing his bag on\r\nthe ground, \xe2\x80\x9conly speak low, for somebody or other may overhear us in\r\nthe farmhouse there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then\xe2\x80\x94I know a good deal concerning your Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s attachment\r\nto you. I may say, too, that I believe I am the only person in the\r\nvillage, excepting Gabriel Oak, who does know it. You ought to marry\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I ought. Indeed, I wish to, but I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy was about to utter something hastily; he then checked himself and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI am too poor.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice was changed. Previously it had had a\r\ndevil-may-care tone. It was the voice of a trickster now.\r\n\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s present mood was not critical enough to notice tones. He\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cI may as well speak plainly; and understand, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish\r\nto enter into the questions of right or wrong, woman\xe2\x80\x99s honour and\r\nshame, or to express any opinion on your conduct. I intend a business\r\ntransaction with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we sit down here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn old tree trunk lay under the hedge immediately opposite, and they\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was engaged to be married to Miss Everdene,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\r\ncame and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot engaged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs good as engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not turned up she might have become engaged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang might!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not come I should certainly\xe2\x80\x94yes, _certainly_\xe2\x80\x94have been\r\naccepted by this time. If you had not seen her you might have been\r\nmarried to Fanny. Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s too much difference between Miss\r\nEverdene\xe2\x80\x99s station and your own for this flirtation with her ever to\r\nbenefit you by ending in marriage. So all I ask is, don\xe2\x80\x99t molest her\r\nany more. Marry Fanny. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it worth your while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you well now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle a sum of money upon her, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee that you don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer from poverty in the future. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it\r\nclearly. Bathsheba is only playing with you: you are too poor for her\r\nas I said; so give up wasting your time about a great match you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnever make for a moderate and rightful match you may make to-morrow;\r\ntake up your carpet-bag, turn about, leave Weatherbury now, this night,\r\nand you shall take fifty pounds with you. Fanny shall have fifty to\r\nenable her to prepare for the wedding, when you have told me where she\r\nis living, and she shall have five hundred paid down on her\r\nwedding-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn making this statement Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s voice revealed only too clearly a\r\nconsciousness of the weakness of his position, his aims, and his\r\nmethod. His manner had lapsed quite from that of the firm and dignified\r\nBoldwood of former times; and such a scheme as he had now engaged in he\r\nwould have condemned as childishly imbecile only a few months ago. We\r\ndiscern a grand force in the lover which he lacks whilst a free man;\r\nbut there is a breadth of vision in the free man which in the lover we\r\nvainly seek. Where there is much bias there must be some narrowness,\r\nand love, though added emotion, is subtracted capacity. Boldwood\r\nexemplified this to an abnormal degree: he knew nothing of Fanny\r\nRobin\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances or whereabouts, he knew nothing of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossibilities, yet that was what he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like Fanny best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy; \xe2\x80\x9cand if, as you say, Miss Everdene is\r\nout of my reach, why I have all to gain by accepting your money, and\r\nmarrying Fan. But she\xe2\x80\x99s only a servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind\xe2\x80\x94do you agree to my arrangement?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, in a more elastic voice. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Troy, if you like\r\nher best, why then did you step in here and injure my happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love Fanny best now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Bathsh\xe2\x80\x94Miss Everdene inflamed\r\nme, and displaced Fanny for a time. It is over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it be over so soon? And why then did you come here again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are weighty reasons. Fifty pounds at once, you said!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, \xe2\x80\x9cand here they are\xe2\x80\x94fifty sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed\r\nTroy a small packet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have everything ready\xe2\x80\x94it seems that you calculated on my accepting\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, taking the packet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might accept them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only my word that the programme shall be adhered to, whilst I\r\nat any rate have fifty pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had thought of that, and I have considered that if I can\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to\r\nyour honour I can trust to your\xe2\x80\x94well, shrewdness we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it\xe2\x80\x94not to\r\nlose five hundred pounds in prospect, and also make a bitter enemy of a\r\nman who is willing to be an extremely useful friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, listen!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy in a whisper.\r\n\r\nA light pit-pat was audible upon the road just above them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis she,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cI must go on and meet her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x94who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba\xe2\x80\x94out alone at this time o\xe2\x80\x99 night!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood in\r\namazement, and starting up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy must you meet her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was expecting me to-night\xe2\x80\x94and I must now speak to her, and wish\r\nher good-bye, according to your wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the necessity of speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can do no harm\xe2\x80\x94and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be wandering about looking for me if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. You shall hear all I say to her. It will help you in your\r\nlove-making when I am gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour tone is mocking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. And remember this, if she does not know what has become of me,\r\nshe will think more about me than if I tell her flatly I have come to\r\ngive her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you confine your words to that one point?\xe2\x80\x94Shall I hear every word\r\nyou say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word. Now sit still there, and hold my carpet bag for me, and\r\nmark what you hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light footstep came closer, halting occasionally, as if the walker\r\nlistened for a sound. Troy whistled a double note in a soft, fluty\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to that, is it!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Boldwood, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promised silence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy stepped forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrank, dearest, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d The tones were Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO God!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow late you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you come by the\r\ncarrier? I listened and heard his wheels entering the village, but it\r\nwas some time ago, and I had almost given you up, Frank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frank. \xe2\x80\x9cYou knew I should, did you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I thought you would,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, playfully; \xe2\x80\x9cand, Frank, it is so\r\nlucky! There\xe2\x80\x99s not a soul in my house but me to-night. I\xe2\x80\x99ve packed them\r\nall off so nobody on earth will know of your visit to your lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbower. Liddy wanted to go to her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s to tell him about her\r\nholiday, and I said she might stay with them till to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94when you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe gone again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapital,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, dear me, I had better go back for my bag,\r\nbecause my slippers and brush and comb are in it; you run home whilst I\r\nfetch it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to be in your parlour in ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned and tripped up the hill again.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of this dialogue there was a nervous twitching of\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s tightly closed lips, and his face became bathed in a clammy\r\ndew. He now started forward towards Troy. Troy turned to him and took\r\nup the bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell her I have come to give her up and cannot marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the soldier, mockingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; wait a minute. I want to say more to you\xe2\x80\x94more to you!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBoldwood, in a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou see my dilemma. Perhaps I am a bad man\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nvictim of my impulses\xe2\x80\x94led away to do what I ought to leave undone. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, however, marry them both. And I have two reasons for choosing\r\nFanny. First, I like her best upon the whole, and second, you make it\r\nworth my while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Boldwood sprang upon him, and held him by the neck.\r\nTroy felt Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s grasp slowly tightening. The move was absolutely\r\nunexpected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are injuring her you love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said the farmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me breath,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\nBoldwood loosened his hand, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBy Heaven, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to kill\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd ruin her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSave her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how can she be saved now, unless I marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood groaned. He reluctantly released the soldier, and flung him\r\nback against the hedge. \xe2\x80\x9cDevil, you torture me!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nTroy rebounded like a ball, and was about to make a dash at the farmer;\r\nbut he checked himself, saying lightly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not worth while to measure my strength with you. Indeed it is a\r\nbarbarous way of settling a quarrel. I shall shortly leave the army\r\nbecause of the same conviction. Now after that revelation of how the\r\nland lies with Bathsheba, \xe2\x80\x99twould be a mistake to kill me, would it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be a mistake to kill you,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Boldwood, mechanically,\r\nwith a bowed head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter kill yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroy, make her your wife, and don\xe2\x80\x99t act upon what I arranged just now.\r\nThe alternative is dreadful, but take Bathsheba; I give her up! She\r\nmust love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as she has\r\ndone. Wretched woman\xe2\x80\x94deluded woman\xe2\x80\x94you are, Bathsheba!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut about Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba is a woman well to do,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Boldwood, in nervous\r\nanxiety, \xe2\x80\x9cand, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is\r\nworth your hastening on your marriage with her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she has a will\xe2\x80\x94not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave to\r\nher. I could do anything with poor Fanny Robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTroy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, imploringly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything for you, only\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t desert her; pray don\xe2\x80\x99t desert her, Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich, poor Fanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; Bathsheba Everdene. Love her best! Love her tenderly! How shall I\r\nget you to see how advantageous it will be to you to secure her at\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to secure her in any new way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s arm moved spasmodically towards Troy\xe2\x80\x99s person again. He\r\nrepressed the instinct, and his form drooped as with pain.\r\n\r\nTroy went on\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall soon purchase my discharge, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish you to hasten on this marriage! It will be better for you\r\nboth. You love each other, and you must let me help you to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, by settling the five hundred on Bathsheba instead of Fanny, to\r\nenable you to marry at once. No; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it of me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\r\nit down to you on the wedding-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy paused in secret amazement at Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s wild infatuation. He\r\ncarelessly said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd am I to have anything now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you wish to. But I have not much additional money with me. I\r\ndid not expect this; but all I have is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood, more like a somnambulist than a wakeful man, pulled out the\r\nlarge canvas bag he carried by way of a purse, and searched it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have twenty-one pounds more with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo notes and a\r\nsovereign. But before I leave you I must have a paper signed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPay me the money, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to her parlour, and make any\r\narrangement you please to secure my compliance with your wishes. But\r\nshe must know nothing of this cash business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the sum, and if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to my house we\xe2\x80\x99ll write out the agreement for the\r\nremainder, and the terms also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst we\xe2\x80\x99ll call upon her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? Come with me to-night, and go with me to-morrow to the\r\nsurrogate\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she must be consulted; at any rate informed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went up the hill to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s house. When they stood at the\r\nentrance, Troy said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait here a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d Opening the door, he glided\r\ninside, leaving the door ajar.\r\n\r\nBoldwood waited. In two minutes a light appeared in the passage.\r\nBoldwood then saw that the chain had been fastened across the door.\r\nTroy appeared inside, carrying a bedroom candlestick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, did you think I should break in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it is merely my humour to secure things. Will you read this a\r\nmoment? I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold the light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy handed a folded newspaper through the slit between door and\r\ndoorpost, and put the candle close. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the paragraph,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nplacing his finger on a line.\r\n\r\nBoldwood looked and read\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMARRIAGES.\r\nOn the 17th inst., at St. Ambrose\xe2\x80\x99s Church, Bath, by the Rev. G.\r\nMincing, B.A., Francis Troy, only son of the late Edward Troy, Esq.,\r\nM.D., of Weatherbury, and sergeant with Dragoon Guards, to Bathsheba,\r\nonly surviving daughter of the late Mr. John Everdene, of Casterbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey, Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy. A\r\nlow gurgle of derisive laughter followed the words.\r\n\r\nThe paper fell from Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Troy continued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFifty pounds to marry Fanny. Good. Twenty-one pounds not to marry\r\nFanny, but Bathsheba. Good. Finale: already Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s husband. Now,\r\nBoldwood, yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends\r\ninterference between a man and his wife. And another word. Bad as I am,\r\nI am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any woman\r\na matter of huckster and sale. Fanny has long ago left me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere she is. I have searched everywhere. Another word yet. You say you\r\nlove Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence you instantly\r\nbelieve in her dishonour. A fig for such love! Now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taught you\r\na lesson, take your money back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not; I will not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, in a hiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, contemptuously. He wrapped the\r\npacket of gold in the notes, and threw the whole into the road.\r\n\r\nBoldwood shook his clenched fist at him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou juggler of Satan! You\r\nblack hound! But I\xe2\x80\x99ll punish you yet; mark me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll punish you yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother peal of laughter. Troy then closed the door, and locked himself\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of that night Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s dark form might have been\r\nseen walking about the hills and downs of Weatherbury like an unhappy\r\nShade in the Mournful Fields by Acheron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\nAT AN UPPER WINDOW\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very early the next morning\xe2\x80\x94a time of sun and dew. The confused\r\nbeginnings of many birds\xe2\x80\x99 songs spread into the healthy air, and the\r\nwan blue of the heaven was here and there coated with thin webs of\r\nincorporeal cloud which were of no effect in obscuring day. All the\r\nlights in the scene were yellow as to colour, and all the shadows were\r\nattenuated as to form. The creeping plants about the old manor-house\r\nwere bowed with rows of heavy water drops, which had upon objects\r\nbehind them the effect of minute lenses of high magnifying power.\r\n\r\nJust before the clock struck five Gabriel Oak and Coggan passed the\r\nvillage cross, and went on together to the fields. They were yet barely\r\nin view of their mistress\xe2\x80\x99s house, when Oak fancied he saw the opening\r\nof a casement in one of the upper windows. The two men were at this\r\nmoment partially screened by an elder bush, now beginning to be\r\nenriched with black bunches of fruit, and they paused before emerging\r\nfrom its shade.\r\n\r\nA handsome man leaned idly from the lattice. He looked east and then\r\nwest, in the manner of one who makes a first morning survey. The man\r\nwas Sergeant Troy. His red jacket was loosely thrown on, but not\r\nbuttoned, and he had altogether the relaxed bearing of a soldier taking\r\nhis ease.\r\n\r\nCoggan spoke first, looking quietly at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has married him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nGabriel had previously beheld the sight, and he now stood with his back\r\nturned, making no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancied we should know something to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard\r\nwheels pass my door just after dark\xe2\x80\x94you were out somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d He glanced\r\nround upon Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens above us, Oak, how white your face\r\nis; you look like a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLean on the gate: I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood by the gate awhile, Gabriel listlessly staring at the\r\nground. His mind sped into the future, and saw there enacted in years\r\nof leisure the scenes of repentance that would ensue from this work of\r\nhaste. That they were married he had instantly decided. Why had it been\r\nso mysteriously managed? It had become known that she had had a fearful\r\njourney to Bath, owing to her miscalculating the distance: that the\r\nhorse had broken down, and that she had been more than two days getting\r\nthere. It was not Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s way to do things furtively. With all her\r\nfaults, she was candour itself. Could she have been entrapped? The\r\nunion was not only an unutterable grief to him: it amazed him,\r\nnotwithstanding that he had passed the preceding week in a suspicion\r\nthat such might be the issue of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s meeting her away from home. Her\r\nquiet return with Liddy had to some extent dispersed the dread. Just as\r\nthat imperceptible motion which appears like stillness is infinitely\r\ndivided in its properties from stillness itself, so had his hope\r\nundistinguishable from despair differed from despair indeed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they moved on again towards the house. The sergeant\r\nstill looked from the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning, comrades!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted, in a cheery voice, when they came up.\r\n\r\nCoggan replied to the greeting. \xe2\x80\x9cBain\xe2\x80\x99t ye going to answer the man?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthen said to Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d say good morning\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a hapenny\r\nof meaning upon it, and yet keep the man civil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel soon decided too that, since the deed was done, to put the best\r\nface upon the matter would be the greatest kindness to her he loved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Sergeant Troy,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, in a ghastly voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rambling, gloomy house this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x94they _may_ not be married!\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel shook his head. The soldier turned a little towards the east,\r\nand the sun kindled his scarlet coat to an orange glow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a nice old house,\xe2\x80\x9d responded Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so; but I feel like new wine in an old bottle here. My\r\nnotion is that sash-windows should be put throughout, and these old\r\nwainscoted walls brightened up a bit; or the oak cleared quite away,\r\nand the walls papered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a pity, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no. A philosopher once said in my hearing that the old builders,\r\nwho worked when art was a living thing, had no respect for the work of\r\nbuilders who went before them, but pulled down and altered as they\r\nthought fit; and why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we? \xe2\x80\x98Creation and preservation don\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwell together,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98and a million of antiquarians can\xe2\x80\x99t invent a\r\nstyle.\xe2\x80\x99 My mind exactly. I am for making this place more modern, that\r\nwe may be cheerful whilst we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe military man turned and surveyed the interior of the room, to\r\nassist his ideas of improvement in this direction. Gabriel and Coggan\r\nbegan to move on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Coggan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, as if inspired by a recollection \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know\r\nif insanity has ever appeared in Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJan reflected for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI once heard that an uncle of his was queer in his head, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow the rights o\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is of no importance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, lightly. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall be down in\r\nthe fields with you some time this week; but I have a few matters to\r\nattend to first. So good-day to you. We shall, of course, keep on just\r\nas friendly terms as usual. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a proud man: nobody is ever able to\r\nsay that of Sergeant Troy. However, what is must be, and here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-a-crown to drink my health, men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy threw the coin dexterously across the front plot and over the\r\nfence towards Gabriel, who shunned it in its fall, his face turning to\r\nan angry red. Coggan twirled his eye, edged forward, and caught the\r\nmoney in its ricochet upon the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94you keep it, Coggan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel with disdain and almost\r\nfiercely. \xe2\x80\x9cAs for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do without gifts from him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t show it too much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cFor if he\xe2\x80\x99s married\r\nto her, mark my words, he\xe2\x80\x99ll buy his discharge and be our master here.\r\nTherefore \xe2\x80\x99tis well to say \xe2\x80\x98Friend\xe2\x80\x99 outwardly, though you say\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Troublehouse\xe2\x80\x99 within.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94perhaps it is best to be silent; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t go further than\r\nthat. I can\xe2\x80\x99t flatter, and if my place here is only to be kept by\r\nsmoothing him down, my place must be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA horseman, whom they had for some time seen in the distance, now\r\nappeared close beside them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Boldwood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what Troy meant by his\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoggan and Oak nodded respectfully to the farmer, just checked their\r\npaces to discover if they were wanted, and finding they were not stood\r\nback to let him pass on.\r\n\r\nThe only signs of the terrible sorrow Boldwood had been combating\r\nthrough the night, and was combating now, were the want of colour in\r\nhis well-defined face, the enlarged appearance of the veins in his\r\nforehead and temples, and the sharper lines about his mouth. The horse\r\nbore him away, and the very step of the animal seemed significant of\r\ndogged despair. Gabriel, for a minute, rose above his own grief in\r\nnoticing Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s. He saw the square figure sitting erect upon the\r\nhorse, the head turned to neither side, the elbows steady by the hips,\r\nthe brim of the hat level and undisturbed in its onward glide, until\r\nthe keen edges of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s shape sank by degrees over the hill. To\r\none who knew the man and his story there was something more striking in\r\nthis immobility than in a collapse. The clash of discord between mood\r\nand matter here was forced painfully home to the heart; and, as in\r\nlaughter there are more dreadful phases than in tears, so was there in\r\nthe steadiness of this agonized man an expression deeper than a cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\nWEALTH IN JEOPARDY\xe2\x80\x94THE REVEL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night, at the end of August, when Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s experiences as a\r\nmarried woman were still new, and when the weather was yet dry and\r\nsultry, a man stood motionless in the stockyard of Weatherbury Upper\r\nFarm, looking at the moon and sky.\r\n\r\nThe night had a sinister aspect. A heated breeze from the south slowly\r\nfanned the summits of lofty objects, and in the sky dashes of buoyant\r\ncloud were sailing in a course at right angles to that of another\r\nstratum, neither of them in the direction of the breeze below. The\r\nmoon, as seen through these films, had a lurid metallic look. The\r\nfields were sallow with the impure light, and all were tinged in\r\nmonochrome, as if beheld through stained glass. The same evening the\r\nsheep had trailed homeward head to tail, the behaviour of the rooks had\r\nbeen confused, and the horses had moved with timidity and caution.\r\n\r\nThunder was imminent, and, taking some secondary appearances into\r\nconsideration, it was likely to be followed by one of the lengthened\r\nrains which mark the close of dry weather for the season. Before twelve\r\nhours had passed a harvest atmosphere would be a bygone thing.\r\n\r\nOak gazed with misgiving at eight naked and unprotected ricks, massive\r\nand heavy with the rich produce of one-half the farm for that year. He\r\nwent on to the barn.\r\n\r\nThis was the night which had been selected by Sergeant Troy\xe2\x80\x94ruling now\r\nin the room of his wife\xe2\x80\x94for giving the harvest supper and dance. As Oak\r\napproached the building the sound of violins and a tambourine, and the\r\nregular jigging of many feet, grew more distinct. He came close to the\r\nlarge doors, one of which stood slightly ajar, and looked in.\r\n\r\nThe central space, together with the recess at one end, was emptied of\r\nall incumbrances, and this area, covering about two-thirds of the\r\nwhole, was appropriated for the gathering, the remaining end, which was\r\npiled to the ceiling with oats, being screened off with sail-cloth.\r\nTufts and garlands of green foliage decorated the walls, beams, and\r\nextemporized chandeliers, and immediately opposite to Oak a rostrum had\r\nbeen erected, bearing a table and chairs. Here sat three fiddlers, and\r\nbeside them stood a frantic man with his hair on end, perspiration\r\nstreaming down his cheeks, and a tambourine quivering in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe dance ended, and on the black oak floor in the midst a new row of\r\ncouples formed for another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and no offence I hope, I ask what dance you would like\r\nnext?\xe2\x80\x9d said the first violin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, it makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clear voice of Bathsheba,\r\nwho stood at the inner end of the building, observing the scene from\r\nbehind a table covered with cups and viands. Troy was lolling beside\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the fiddler, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll venture to name that the right and\r\nproper thing is \xe2\x80\x98The Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Joy\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94there being a gallant soldier\r\nmarried into the farm\xe2\x80\x94hey, my sonnies, and gentlemen all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be \xe2\x80\x98The Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Joy,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed a chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks for the compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant gaily, taking Bathsheba\r\nby the hand and leading her to the top of the dance. \xe2\x80\x9cFor though I have\r\npurchased my discharge from Her Most Gracious Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s regiment of\r\ncavalry the 11th Dragoon Guards, to attend to the new duties awaiting\r\nme here, I shall continue a soldier in spirit and feeling as long as I\r\nlive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the dance began. As to the merits of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Joy,\xe2\x80\x9d there\r\ncannot be, and never were, two opinions. It has been observed in the\r\nmusical circles of Weatherbury and its vicinity that this melody, at\r\nthe end of three-quarters of an hour of thunderous footing, still\r\npossesses more stimulative properties for the heel and toe than the\r\nmajority of other dances at their first opening. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Soldier\xe2\x80\x99s Joy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhas, too, an additional charm, in being so admirably adapted to the\r\ntambourine aforesaid\xe2\x80\x94no mean instrument in the hands of a performer who\r\nunderstands the proper convulsions, spasms, St. Vitus\xe2\x80\x99s dances, and\r\nfearful frenzies necessary when exhibiting its tones in their highest\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe immortal tune ended, a fine DD rolling forth from the bass-viol\r\nwith the sonorousness of a cannonade, and Gabriel delayed his entry no\r\nlonger. He avoided Bathsheba, and got as near as possible to the\r\nplatform, where Sergeant Troy was now seated, drinking\r\nbrandy-and-water, though the others drank without exception cider and\r\nale. Gabriel could not easily thrust himself within speaking distance\r\nof the sergeant, and he sent a message, asking him to come down for a\r\nmoment. The sergeant said he could not attend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell him, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I only stepped ath\xe2\x80\x99art\r\nto say that a heavy rain is sure to fall soon, and that something\r\nshould be done to protect the ricks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Troy says it will not rain,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the messenger, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\r\ncannot stop to talk to you about such fidgets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn juxtaposition with Troy, Oak had a melancholy tendency to look like\r\na candle beside gas, and ill at ease, he went out again, thinking he\r\nwould go home; for, under the circumstances, he had no heart for the\r\nscene in the barn. At the door he paused for a moment: Troy was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends, it is not only the harvest home that we are celebrating\r\nto-night; but this is also a Wedding Feast. A short time ago I had the\r\nhappiness to lead to the altar this lady, your mistress, and not until\r\nnow have we been able to give any public flourish to the event in\r\nWeatherbury. That it may be thoroughly well done, and that every man\r\nmay go happy to bed, I have ordered to be brought here some bottles of\r\nbrandy and kettles of hot water. A treble-strong goblet will be handed\r\nround to each guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba put her hand upon his arm, and, with upturned pale face, said\r\nimploringly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t give it to them\xe2\x80\x94pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, Frank! It will only\r\ndo them harm: they have had enough of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for no more, thank ye,\xe2\x80\x9d said one or two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant contemptuously, and raised his voice as if\r\nlighted up by a new idea. \xe2\x80\x9cFriends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll send the\r\nwomen-folk home! \xe2\x80\x99Tis time they were in bed. Then we cockbirds will\r\nhave a jolly carouse to ourselves! If any of the men show the white\r\nfeather, let them look elsewhere for a winter\xe2\x80\x99s work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba indignantly left the barn, followed by all the women and\r\nchildren. The musicians, not looking upon themselves as \xe2\x80\x9ccompany,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nslipped quietly away to their spring waggon and put in the horse. Thus\r\nTroy and the men on the farm were left sole occupants of the place.\r\nOak, not to appear unnecessarily disagreeable, stayed a little while;\r\nthen he, too, arose and quietly took his departure, followed by a\r\nfriendly oath from the sergeant for not staying to a second round of\r\ngrog.\r\n\r\nGabriel proceeded towards his home. In approaching the door, his toe\r\nkicked something which felt and sounded soft, leathery, and distended,\r\nlike a boxing-glove. It was a large toad humbly travelling across the\r\npath. Oak took it up, thinking it might be better to kill the creature\r\nto save it from pain; but finding it uninjured, he placed it again\r\namong the grass. He knew what this direct message from the Great Mother\r\nmeant. And soon came another.\r\n\r\nWhen he struck a light indoors there appeared upon the table a thin\r\nglistening streak, as if a brush of varnish had been lightly dragged\r\nacross it. Oak\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed the serpentine sheen to the other side,\r\nwhere it led up to a huge brown garden-slug, which had come indoors\r\nto-night for reasons of its own. It was Nature\xe2\x80\x99s second way of hinting\r\nto him that he was to prepare for foul weather.\r\n\r\nOak sat down meditating for nearly an hour. During this time two black\r\nspiders, of the kind common in thatched houses, promenaded the ceiling,\r\nultimately dropping to the floor. This reminded him that if there was\r\none class of manifestation on this matter that he thoroughly\r\nunderstood, it was the instincts of sheep. He left the room, ran across\r\ntwo or three fields towards the flock, got upon a hedge, and looked\r\nover among them.\r\n\r\nThey were crowded close together on the other side around some furze\r\nbushes, and the first peculiarity observable was that, on the sudden\r\nappearance of Oak\xe2\x80\x99s head over the fence, they did not stir or run away.\r\nThey had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man.\r\nBut this was not the most noteworthy feature: they were all grouped in\r\nsuch a way that their tails, without a single exception, were towards\r\nthat half of the horizon from which the storm threatened. There was an\r\ninner circle closely huddled, and outside these they radiated wider\r\napart, the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a\r\nvandyked lace collar, to which the clump of furze-bushes stood in the\r\nposition of a wearer\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to re-establish him in his original opinion. He knew\r\nnow that he was right, and that Troy was wrong. Every voice in nature\r\nwas unanimous in bespeaking change. But two distinct translations\r\nattached to these dumb expressions. Apparently there was to be a\r\nthunder-storm, and afterwards a cold continuous rain. The creeping\r\nthings seemed to know all about the later rain, but little of the\r\ninterpolated thunder-storm; whilst the sheep knew all about the\r\nthunder-storm and nothing of the later rain.\r\n\r\nThis complication of weathers being uncommon, was all the more to be\r\nfeared. Oak returned to the stack-yard. All was silent here, and the\r\nconical tips of the ricks jutted darkly into the sky. There were five\r\nwheat-ricks in this yard, and three stacks of barley. The wheat when\r\nthreshed would average about thirty quarters to each stack; the barley,\r\nat least forty. Their value to Bathsheba, and indeed to anybody, Oak\r\nmentally estimated by the following simple calculation:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n 5 \xc3\x97 30 = 150 quarters = 500 \xc2\xa3.\r\n3 \xc3\x97 40 = 120 quarters = 250 \xc2\xa3.\r\n\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93\r\nTotal . . 750 \xc2\xa3.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred and fifty pounds in the divinest form that money can\r\nwear\xe2\x80\x94that of necessary food for man and beast: should the risk be run\r\nof deteriorating this bulk of corn to less than half its value, because\r\nof the instability of a woman? \xe2\x80\x9cNever, if I can prevent it!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGabriel.\r\n\r\nSuch was the argument that Oak set outwardly before him. But man, even\r\nto himself, is a palimpsest, having an ostensible writing, and another\r\nbeneath the lines. It is possible that there was this golden legend\r\nunder the utilitarian one: \xe2\x80\x9cI will help to my last effort the woman I\r\nhave loved so dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went back to the barn to endeavour to obtain assistance for covering\r\nthe ricks that very night. All was silent within, and he would have\r\npassed on in the belief that the party had broken up, had not a dim\r\nlight, yellow as saffron by contrast with the greenish whiteness\r\noutside, streamed through a knot-hole in the folding doors.\r\n\r\nGabriel looked in. An unusual picture met his eye.\r\n\r\nThe candles suspended among the evergreens had burnt down to their\r\nsockets, and in some cases the leaves tied about them were scorched.\r\nMany of the lights had quite gone out, others smoked and stank, grease\r\ndropping from them upon the floor. Here, under the table, and leaning\r\nagainst forms and chairs in every conceivable attitude except the\r\nperpendicular, were the wretched persons of all the work-folk, the hair\r\nof their heads at such low levels being suggestive of mops and brooms.\r\nIn the midst of these shone red and distinct the figure of Sergeant\r\nTroy, leaning back in a chair. Coggan was on his back, with his mouth\r\nopen, huzzing forth snores, as were several others; the united\r\nbreathings of the horizonal assemblage forming a subdued roar like\r\nLondon from a distance. Joseph Poorgrass was curled round in the\r\nfashion of a hedge-hog, apparently in attempts to present the least\r\npossible portion of his surface to the air; and behind him was dimly\r\nvisible an unimportant remnant of William Smallbury. The glasses and\r\ncups still stood upon the table, a water-jug being overturned, from\r\nwhich a small rill, after tracing its course with marvellous precision\r\ndown the centre of the long table, fell into the neck of the\r\nunconscious Mark Clark, in a steady, monotonous drip, like the dripping\r\nof a stalactite in a cave.\r\n\r\nGabriel glanced hopelessly at the group, which, with one or two\r\nexceptions, composed all the able-bodied men upon the farm. He saw at\r\nonce that if the ricks were to be saved that night, or even the next\r\nmorning, he must save them with his own hands.\r\n\r\nA faint \xe2\x80\x9cting-ting\xe2\x80\x9d resounded from under Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat. It was\r\nCoggan\xe2\x80\x99s watch striking the hour of two.\r\n\r\nOak went to the recumbent form of Matthew Moon, who usually undertook\r\nthe rough thatching of the home-stead, and shook him. The shaking was\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nGabriel shouted in his ear, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s your thatching-beetle and\r\nrick-stick and spars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the staddles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moon, mechanically, with the unconscious\r\npromptness of a medium.\r\n\r\nGabriel let go his head, and it dropped upon the floor like a bowl. He\r\nthen went to Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the key of the granary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo answer. The question was repeated, with the same result. To be\r\nshouted to at night was evidently less of a novelty to Susan Tall\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband than to Matthew Moon. Oak flung down Tall\xe2\x80\x99s head into the\r\ncorner again and turned away.\r\n\r\nTo be just, the men were not greatly to blame for this painful and\r\ndemoralizing termination to the evening\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment. Sergeant Troy\r\nhad so strenuously insisted, glass in hand, that drinking should be the\r\nbond of their union, that those who wished to refuse hardly liked to be\r\nso unmannerly under the circumstances. Having from their youth up been\r\nentirely unaccustomed to any liquor stronger than cider or mild ale, it\r\nwas no wonder that they had succumbed, one and all, with extraordinary\r\nuniformity, after the lapse of about an hour.\r\n\r\nGabriel was greatly depressed. This debauch boded ill for that wilful\r\nand fascinating mistress whom the faithful man even now felt within him\r\nas the embodiment of all that was sweet and bright and hopeless.\r\n\r\nHe put out the expiring lights, that the barn might not be endangered,\r\nclosed the door upon the men in their deep and oblivious sleep, and\r\nwent again into the lone night. A hot breeze, as if breathed from the\r\nparted lips of some dragon about to swallow the globe, fanned him from\r\nthe south, while directly opposite in the north rose a grim misshapen\r\nbody of cloud, in the very teeth of the wind. So unnaturally did it\r\nrise that one could fancy it to be lifted by machinery from below.\r\nMeanwhile the faint cloudlets had flown back into the south-east corner\r\nof the sky, as if in terror of the large cloud, like a young brood\r\ngazed in upon by some monster.\r\n\r\nGoing on to the village, Oak flung a small stone against the window of\r\nLaban Tall\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, expecting Susan to open it; but nobody stirred.\r\nHe went round to the back door, which had been left unfastened for\r\nLaban\xe2\x80\x99s entry, and passed in to the foot of the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Tall, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for the key of the granary, to get at the\r\nrick-cloths,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, in a stentorian voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Susan Tall, half awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along to bed, do, you drawlatching rogue\xe2\x80\x94keeping a body awake\r\nlike this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t Laban\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis Gabriel Oak. I want the key of the granary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel! What in the name of fortune did you pretend to be Laban for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I thought you meant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you did! What do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe key of the granary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it then. \xe2\x80\x99Tis on the nail. People coming disturbing women at this\r\ntime of night ought\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel took the key, without waiting to hear the conclusion of the\r\ntirade. Ten minutes later his lonely figure might have been seen\r\ndragging four large water-proof coverings across the yard, and soon two\r\nof these heaps of treasure in grain were covered snug\xe2\x80\x94two cloths to\r\neach. Two hundred pounds were secured. Three wheat-stacks remained\r\nopen, and there were no more cloths. Oak looked under the staddles and\r\nfound a fork. He mounted the third pile of wealth and began operating,\r\nadopting the plan of sloping the upper sheaves one over the other; and,\r\nin addition, filling the interstices with the material of some untied\r\nsheaves.\r\n\r\nSo far all was well. By this hurried contrivance Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s property\r\nin wheat was safe for at any rate a week or two, provided always that\r\nthere was not much wind.\r\n\r\nNext came the barley. This it was only possible to protect by\r\nsystematic thatching. Time went on, and the moon vanished not to\r\nreappear. It was the farewell of the ambassador previous to war. The\r\nnight had a haggard look, like a sick thing; and there came finally an\r\nutter expiration of air from the whole heaven in the form of a slow\r\nbreeze, which might have been likened to a death. And now nothing was\r\nheard in the yard but the dull thuds of the beetle which drove in the\r\nspars, and the rustle of thatch in the intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\nTHE STORM\xe2\x80\x94THE TWO TOGETHER\r\n\r\n\r\nA light flapped over the scene, as if reflected from phosphorescent\r\nwings crossing the sky, and a rumble filled the air. It was the first\r\nmove of the approaching storm.\r\n\r\nThe second peal was noisy, with comparatively little visible lightning.\r\nGabriel saw a candle shining in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and soon a shadow\r\nswept to and fro upon the blind.\r\n\r\nThen there came a third flash. Man\xc5\x93uvres of a most extraordinary kind\r\nwere going on in the vast firmamental hollows overhead. The lightning\r\nnow was the colour of silver, and gleamed in the heavens like a mailed\r\narmy. Rumbles became rattles. Gabriel from his elevated position could\r\nsee over the landscape at least half-a-dozen miles in front. Every\r\nhedge, bush, and tree was distinct as in a line engraving. In a paddock\r\nin the same direction was a herd of heifers, and the forms of these\r\nwere visible at this moment in the act of galloping about in the\r\nwildest and maddest confusion, flinging their heels and tails high into\r\nthe air, their heads to earth. A poplar in the immediate foreground was\r\nlike an ink stroke on burnished tin. Then the picture vanished, leaving\r\nthe darkness so intense that Gabriel worked entirely by feeling with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nHe had stuck his ricking-rod, or poniard, as it was indifferently\r\ncalled\xe2\x80\x94a long iron lance, polished by handling\xe2\x80\x94into the stack, used to\r\nsupport the sheaves instead of the support called a groom used on\r\nhouses. A blue light appeared in the zenith, and in some indescribable\r\nmanner flickered down near the top of the rod. It was the fourth of the\r\nlarger flashes. A moment later and there was a smack\xe2\x80\x94smart, clear, and\r\nshort. Gabriel felt his position to be anything but a safe one, and he\r\nresolved to descend.\r\n\r\nNot a drop of rain had fallen as yet. He wiped his weary brow, and\r\nlooked again at the black forms of the unprotected stacks. Was his life\r\nso valuable to him after all? What were his prospects that he should be\r\nso chary of running risk, when important and urgent labour could not be\r\ncarried on without such risk? He resolved to stick to the stack.\r\nHowever, he took a precaution. Under the staddles was a long tethering\r\nchain, used to prevent the escape of errant horses. This he carried up\r\nthe ladder, and sticking his rod through the clog at one end, allowed\r\nthe other end of the chain to trail upon the ground. The spike attached\r\nto it he drove in. Under the shadow of this extemporized\r\nlightning-conductor he felt himself comparatively safe.\r\n\r\nBefore Oak had laid his hands upon his tools again out leapt the fifth\r\nflash, with the spring of a serpent and the shout of a fiend. It was\r\ngreen as an emerald, and the reverberation was stunning. What was this\r\nthe light revealed to him? In the open ground before him, as he looked\r\nover the ridge of the rick, was a dark and apparently female form.\r\nCould it be that of the only venturesome woman in the parish\xe2\x80\x94Bathsheba?\r\nThe form moved on a step: then he could see no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel to the darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there?\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice of Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel. I am on the rick, thatching.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gabriel!\xe2\x80\x94and are you? I have come about them. The weather awoke\r\nme, and I thought of the corn. I am so distressed about it\xe2\x80\x94can we save\r\nit anyhow? I cannot find my husband. Is he with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where he is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsleep in the barn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe promised that the stacks should be seen to, and now they are all\r\nneglected! Can I do anything to help? Liddy is afraid to come out.\r\nFancy finding you here at such an hour! Surely I can do something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can bring up some reed-sheaves to me, one by one, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; if you\r\nare not afraid to come up the ladder in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery\r\nmoment is precious now, and that would save a good deal of time. It is\r\nnot very dark when the lightning has been gone a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, resolutely. She instantly took a sheaf\r\nupon her shoulder, clambered up close to his heels, placed it behind\r\nthe rod, and descended for another. At her third ascent the rick\r\nsuddenly brightened with the brazen glare of shining majolica\xe2\x80\x94every\r\nknot in every straw was visible. On the slope in front of him appeared\r\ntwo human shapes, black as jet. The rick lost its sheen\xe2\x80\x94the shapes\r\nvanished. Gabriel turned his head. It had been the sixth flash which\r\nhad come from the east behind him, and the two dark forms on the slope\r\nhad been the shadows of himself and Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThen came the peal. It hardly was credible that such a heavenly light\r\ncould be the parent of such a diabolical sound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, and clutched him by the sleeve. Gabriel\r\nturned, and steadied her on her aerial perch by holding her arm. At the\r\nsame moment, while he was still reversed in his attitude, there was\r\nmore light, and he saw, as it were, a copy of the tall poplar tree on\r\nthe hill drawn in black on the wall of the barn. It was the shadow of\r\nthat tree, thrown across by a secondary flash in the west.\r\n\r\nThe next flare came. Bathsheba was on the ground now, shouldering\r\nanother sheaf, and she bore its dazzle without flinching\xe2\x80\x94thunder and\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94and again ascended with the load. There was then a silence\r\neverywhere for four or five minutes, and the crunch of the spars, as\r\nGabriel hastily drove them in, could again be distinctly heard. He\r\nthought the crisis of the storm had passed. But there came a burst of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, taking the sheaf from her shoulder, and\r\ngrasping her arm again.\r\n\r\nHeaven opened then, indeed. The flash was almost too novel for its\r\ninexpressibly dangerous nature to be at once realized, and they could\r\nonly comprehend the magnificence of its beauty. It sprang from east,\r\nwest, north, south, and was a perfect dance of death. The forms of\r\nskeletons appeared in the air, shaped with blue fire for bones\xe2\x80\x94dancing,\r\nleaping, striding, racing around, and mingling altogether in\r\nunparalleled confusion. With these were intertwined undulating snakes\r\nof green, and behind these was a broad mass of lesser light.\r\nSimultaneously came from every part of the tumbling sky what may be\r\ncalled a shout; since, though no shout ever came near it, it was more\r\nof the nature of a shout than of anything else earthly. In the meantime\r\none of the grisly forms had alighted upon the point of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s rod,\r\nto run invisibly down it, down the chain, and into the earth. Gabriel\r\nwas almost blinded, and he could feel Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s warm arm tremble in\r\nhis hand\xe2\x80\x94a sensation novel and thrilling enough; but love, life,\r\neverything human, seemed small and trifling in such close juxtaposition\r\nwith an infuriated universe.\r\n\r\nOak had hardly time to gather up these impressions into a thought, and\r\nto see how strangely the red feather of her hat shone in this light,\r\nwhen the tall tree on the hill before mentioned seemed on fire to a\r\nwhite heat, and a new one among these terrible voices mingled with the\r\nlast crash of those preceding. It was a stupefying blast, harsh and\r\npitiless, and it fell upon their ears in a dead, flat blow, without\r\nthat reverberation which lends the tones of a drum to more distant\r\nthunder. By the lustre reflected from every part of the earth and from\r\nthe wide domical scoop above it, he saw that the tree was sliced down\r\nthe whole length of its tall, straight stem, a huge riband of bark\r\nbeing apparently flung off. The other portion remained erect, and\r\nrevealed the bared surface as a strip of white down the front. The\r\nlightning had struck the tree. A sulphurous smell filled the air; then\r\nall was silent, and black as a cave in Hinnom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a narrow escape!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba said nothing; but he could distinctly hear her rhythmical\r\npants, and the recurrent rustle of the sheaf beside her in response to\r\nher frightened pulsations. She descended the ladder, and, on second\r\nthoughts, he followed her. The darkness was now impenetrable by the\r\nsharpest vision. They both stood still at the bottom, side by side.\r\nBathsheba appeared to think only of the weather\xe2\x80\x94Oak thought only of her\r\njust then. At last he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe storm seems to have passed now, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cThough there are multitudes of\r\ngleams, look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sky was now filled with an incessant light, frequent repetition\r\nmelting into complete continuity, as an unbroken sound results from the\r\nsuccessive strokes on a gong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot understand no rain falling. But\r\nHeaven be praised, it is all the better for us. I am now going up\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel, you are kinder than I deserve! I will stay and help you yet.\r\nOh, why are not some of the others here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would have been here if they could,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, in a hesitating\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I know it all\xe2\x80\x94all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding slowly: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all asleep\r\nin the barn, in a drunken sleep, and my husband among them. That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\r\nis it not? Don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am a timid woman and can\xe2\x80\x99t endure things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not certain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the barn, leaving her there alone. He looked through the\r\nchinks of the door. All was in total darkness, as he had left it, and\r\nthere still arose, as at the former time, the steady buzz of many\r\nsnores.\r\n\r\nHe felt a zephyr curling about his cheek, and turned. It was\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s breath\xe2\x80\x94she had followed him, and was looking into the same\r\nchink.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to put off the immediate and painful subject of their\r\nthoughts by remarking gently, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll come back again, miss\xe2\x80\x94ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\r\nand hand up a few more; it would save much time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Oak went back again, ascended to the top, stepped off the ladder\r\nfor greater expedition, and went on thatching. She followed, but\r\nwithout a sheaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a strange and impressive voice.\r\n\r\nOak looked up at her. She had not spoken since he left the barn. The\r\nsoft and continual shimmer of the dying lightning showed a marble face\r\nhigh against the black sky of the opposite quarter. Bathsheba was\r\nsitting almost on the apex of the stack, her feet gathered up beneath\r\nher, and resting on the top round of the ladder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you thought that when I galloped away to Bath that night it\r\nwas on purpose to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did at last\xe2\x80\x94not at first,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, somewhat surprised at the\r\nabruptness with which this new subject was broached.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd others thought so, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you blamed me for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought so. Now, I care a little for your good opinion, and I want\r\nto explain something\xe2\x80\x94I have longed to do it ever since I returned, and\r\nyou looked so gravely at me. For if I were to die\xe2\x80\x94and I may die soon\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwould be dreadful that you should always think mistakenly of me. Now,\r\nlisten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel ceased his rustling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to Bath that night in the full intention of breaking off my\r\nengagement to Mr. Troy. It was owing to circumstances which occurred\r\nafter I got there that\xe2\x80\x94that we were married. Now, do you see the matter\r\nin a new light?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x94somewhat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, I suppose, say more, now that I have begun. And perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno harm, for you are certainly under no delusion that I ever loved you,\r\nor that I can have any object in speaking, more than that object I have\r\nmentioned. Well, I was alone in a strange city, and the horse was lame.\r\nAnd at last I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I saw, when it was too late, that\r\nscandal might seize hold of me for meeting him alone in that way. But I\r\nwas coming away, when he suddenly said he had that day seen a woman\r\nmore beautiful than I, and that his constancy could not be counted on\r\nunless I at once became his.... And I was grieved and troubled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ncleared her voice, and waited a moment, as if to gather breath. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nthen, between jealousy and distraction, I married him!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered\r\nwith desperate impetuosity.\r\n\r\nGabriel made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was not to blame, for it was perfectly true about\xe2\x80\x94about his seeing\r\nsomebody else,\xe2\x80\x9d she quickly added. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish for a single\r\nremark from you upon the subject\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I forbid it. I only wanted you\r\nto know that misunderstood bit of my history before a time comes when\r\nyou could never know it.\xe2\x80\x94You want some more sheaves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went down the ladder, and the work proceeded. Gabriel soon\r\nperceived a languor in the movements of his mistress up and down, and\r\nhe said to her, gently as a mother\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better go indoors now, you are tired. I can finish the\r\nrest alone. If the wind does not change the rain is likely to keep\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am useless I will go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, in a flagging cadence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut O, if your life should be lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not useless; but I would rather not tire you longer. You have\r\ndone well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you better!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for your devotion, a\r\nthousand times, Gabriel! Goodnight\xe2\x80\x94I know you are doing your very best\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe diminished in the gloom, and vanished, and he heard the latch of\r\nthe gate fall as she passed through. He worked in a reverie now, musing\r\nupon her story, and upon the contradictoriness of that feminine heart\r\nwhich had caused her to speak more warmly to him to-night than she ever\r\nhad done whilst unmarried and free to speak as warmly as she chose.\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed in his meditation by a grating noise from the\r\ncoach-house. It was the vane on the roof turning round, and this change\r\nin the wind was the signal for a disastrous rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\nRAIN\xe2\x80\x94ONE SOLITARY MEETS ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the dawn was promising to break in hues of\r\ndrab and ash.\r\n\r\nThe air changed its temperature and stirred itself more vigorously.\r\nCool breezes coursed in transparent eddies round Oak\xe2\x80\x99s face. The wind\r\nshifted yet a point or two and blew stronger. In ten minutes every wind\r\nof heaven seemed to be roaming at large. Some of the thatching on the\r\nwheat-stacks was now whirled fantastically aloft, and had to be\r\nreplaced and weighted with some rails that lay near at hand. This done,\r\nOak slaved away again at the barley. A huge drop of rain smote his\r\nface, the wind snarled round every corner, the trees rocked to the\r\nbases of their trunks, and the twigs clashed in strife. Driving in\r\nspars at any point and on any system, inch by inch he covered more and\r\nmore safely from ruin this distracting impersonation of seven hundred\r\npounds. The rain came on in earnest, and Oak soon felt the water to be\r\ntracking cold and clammy routes down his back. Ultimately he was\r\nreduced well-nigh to a homogeneous sop, and the dyes of his clothes\r\ntrickled down and stood in a pool at the foot of the ladder. The rain\r\nstretched obliquely through the dull atmosphere in liquid spines,\r\nunbroken in continuity between their beginnings in the clouds and their\r\npoints in him.\r\n\r\nOak suddenly remembered that eight months before this time he had been\r\nfighting against fire in the same spot as desperately as he was\r\nfighting against water now\xe2\x80\x94and for a futile love of the same woman. As\r\nfor her\xe2\x80\x94But Oak was generous and true, and dismissed his reflections.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the dark leaden morning when Gabriel came\r\ndown from the last stack, and thankfully exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is done!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nwas drenched, weary, and sad, and yet not so sad as drenched and weary,\r\nfor he was cheered by a sense of success in a good cause.\r\n\r\nFaint sounds came from the barn, and he looked that way. Figures\r\nstepped singly and in pairs through the doors\xe2\x80\x94all walking awkwardly,\r\nand abashed, save the foremost, who wore a red jacket, and advanced\r\nwith his hands in his pockets, whistling. The others shambled after\r\nwith a conscience-stricken air: the whole procession was not unlike\r\nFlaxman\xe2\x80\x99s group of the suitors tottering on towards the infernal\r\nregions under the conduct of Mercury. The gnarled shapes passed into\r\nthe village, Troy, their leader, entering the farmhouse. Not a single\r\none of them had turned his face to the ricks, or apparently bestowed\r\none thought upon their condition.\r\n\r\nSoon Oak too went homeward, by a different route from theirs. In front\r\nof him against the wet glazed surface of the lane he saw a person\r\nwalking yet more slowly than himself under an umbrella. The man turned\r\nand plainly started; he was Boldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you this morning, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is a wet day.\xe2\x80\x94Oh, I am well, very well, I thank you; quite\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood seemed to awake to the present by degrees. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look tired and\r\nill, Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said then, desultorily regarding his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired. You look strangely altered, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Not a bit of it: I am well enough. What put that into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you didn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite so topping as you used to, that was\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, then you are mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing hurts\r\nme. My constitution is an iron one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been working hard to get our ricks covered, and was barely in\r\ntime. Never had such a struggle in my life.... Yours of course are\r\nsafe, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood added, after an interval of silence: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you\r\nask, Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ricks are all covered before this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, the large ones upon the stone staddles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThem under the hedge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I forgot to tell the thatcher to set about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor the little one by the stile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor the little one by the stile. I overlooked the ricks this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen not a tenth of your corn will come to measure, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOverlooked them,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Gabriel slowly to himself. It is difficult\r\nto describe the intensely dramatic effect that announcement had upon\r\nOak at such a moment. All the night he had been feeling that the\r\nneglect he was labouring to repair was abnormal and isolated\xe2\x80\x94the only\r\ninstance of the kind within the circuit of the county. Yet at this very\r\ntime, within the same parish, a greater waste had been going on,\r\nuncomplained of and disregarded. A few months earlier Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforgetting his husbandry would have been as preposterous an idea as a\r\nsailor forgetting he was in a ship. Oak was just thinking that whatever\r\nhe himself might have suffered from Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, here was a\r\nman who had suffered more, when Boldwood spoke in a changed voice\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nof one who yearned to make a confidence and relieve his heart by an\r\noutpouring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOak, you know as well as I that things have gone wrong with me lately.\r\nI may as well own it. I was going to get a little settled in life; but\r\nin some way my plan has come to nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought my mistress would have married you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, not\r\nknowing enough of the full depths of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s love to keep silence on\r\nthe farmer\xe2\x80\x99s account, and determined not to evade discipline by doing\r\nso on his own. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it is so sometimes, and nothing happens that\r\nwe expect,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with the repose of a man whom misfortune had\r\ninured rather than subdued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay I am a joke about the parish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, as if the\r\nsubject came irresistibly to his tongue, and with a miserable lightness\r\nmeant to express his indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94But the real truth of the matter is that there was not, as some\r\nfancy, any jilting on\xe2\x80\x94her part. No engagement ever existed between me\r\nand Miss Everdene. People say so, but it is untrue: she never promised\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood stood still now and turned his wild face to Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI am weak and foolish, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what,\r\nand I can\xe2\x80\x99t fend off my miserable grief!... I had some faint belief in\r\nthe mercy of God till I lost that woman. Yes, He prepared a gourd to\r\nshade me, and like the prophet I thanked Him and was glad. But the next\r\nday He prepared a worm to smite the gourd and wither it; and I feel it\r\nis better to die than to live!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA silence followed. Boldwood aroused himself from the momentary mood of\r\nconfidence into which he had drifted, and walked on again, resuming his\r\nusual reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, with a carelessness which was like the smile\r\non the countenance of a skull: \xe2\x80\x9cit was made more of by other people\r\nthan ever it was by us. I do feel a little regret occasionally, but no\r\nwoman ever had power over me for any length of time. Well, good\r\nmorning; I can trust you not to mention to others what has passed\r\nbetween us two here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\nCOMING HOME\xe2\x80\x94A CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the turnpike road, between Casterbridge and Weatherbury, and about\r\nthree miles from the former place, is Yalbury Hill, one of those steep\r\nlong ascents which pervade the highways of this undulating part of\r\nSouth Wessex. In returning from market it is usual for the farmers and\r\nother gig-gentry to alight at the bottom and walk up.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday evening in the month of October Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle was\r\nduly creeping up this incline. She was sitting listlessly in the second\r\nseat of the gig, whilst walking beside her in a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s marketing suit\r\nof unusually fashionable cut was an erect, well-made young man. Though\r\non foot, he held the reins and whip, and occasionally aimed light cuts\r\nat the horse\xe2\x80\x99s ear with the end of the lash, as a recreation. This man\r\nwas her husband, formerly Sergeant Troy, who, having bought his\r\ndischarge with Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s money, was gradually transforming himself\r\ninto a farmer of a spirited and very modern school. People of\r\nunalterable ideas still insisted upon calling him \xe2\x80\x9cSergeant\xe2\x80\x9d when they\r\nmet him, which was in some degree owing to his having still retained\r\nthe well-shaped moustache of his military days, and the soldierly\r\nbearing inseparable from his form and training.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for that wretched rain I should have cleared\r\ntwo hundred as easy as looking, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee, it altered all the chances? To speak like a book I once read, wet\r\nweather is the narrative, and fine days are the episodes, of our\r\ncountry\xe2\x80\x99s history; now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the time of year is come for changeable weather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes. The fact is, these autumn races are the ruin of everybody.\r\nNever did I see such a day as \xe2\x80\x99twas! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a wild open place, just out\r\nof Budmouth, and a drab sea rolled in towards us like liquid misery.\r\nWind and rain\xe2\x80\x94good Lord! Dark? Why, \xe2\x80\x99twas as black as my hat before the\r\nlast race was run. \xe2\x80\x99Twas five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the horses\r\ntill they were almost in, leave alone colours. The ground was as heavy\r\nas lead, and all judgment from a fellow\xe2\x80\x99s experience went for nothing.\r\nHorses, riders, people, were all blown about like ships at sea. Three\r\nbooths were blown over, and the wretched folk inside crawled out upon\r\ntheir hands and knees; and in the next field were as many as a dozen\r\nhats at one time. Ay, Pimpernel regularly stuck fast, when about sixty\r\nyards off, and when I saw Policy stepping on, it did knock my heart\r\nagainst the lining of my ribs, I assure you, my love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean, Frank,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, sadly\xe2\x80\x94her voice was painfully\r\nlowered from the fulness and vivacity of the previous summer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nhave lost more than a hundred pounds in a month by this dreadful\r\nhorse-racing? O, Frank, it is cruel; it is foolish of you to take away\r\nmy money so. We shall have to leave the farm; that will be the end of\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumbug about cruel. Now, there \xe2\x80\x99tis again\xe2\x80\x94turn on the waterworks;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s just like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll promise me not to go to Budmouth second meeting, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d she implored. Bathsheba was at the full depth for tears, but she\r\nmaintained a dry eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I should; in fact, if it turns out to be a fine day, I\r\nwas thinking of taking you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go a hundred miles the other way first. I hate the\r\nsound of the very word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the question of going to see the race or staying at home has very\r\nlittle to do with the matter. Bets are all booked safely enough before\r\nthe race begins, you may depend. Whether it is a bad race for me or a\r\ngood one, will have very little to do with our going there next\r\nMonday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that you have risked anything on this one\r\ntoo!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, with an agonized look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be a little fool. Wait till you are told. Why,\r\nBathsheba, you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you formerly had,\r\nand upon my life if I had known what a chicken-hearted creature you\r\nwere under all your boldness, I\xe2\x80\x99d never have\xe2\x80\x94I know what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flash of indignation might have been seen in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes as\r\nshe looked resolutely ahead after this reply. They moved on without\r\nfurther speech, some early-withered leaves from the trees which hooded\r\nthe road at this spot occasionally spinning downward across their path\r\nto the earth.\r\n\r\nA woman appeared on the brow of the hill. The ridge was in a cutting,\r\nso that she was very near the husband and wife before she became\r\nvisible. Troy had turned towards the gig to remount, and whilst putting\r\nhis foot on the step the woman passed behind him.\r\n\r\nThough the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped\r\nthem in gloom, Bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the\r\nextreme poverty of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s garb, and the sadness of her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge Union-house closes\r\nat night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman said these words to Troy over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nTroy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet he seemed to\r\nrecover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving way\r\nto his impulse to suddenly turn and face her. He said, slowly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman, on hearing him speak, quickly looked up, examined the side\r\nof his face, and recognized the soldier under the yeoman\xe2\x80\x99s garb. Her\r\nface was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both\r\namong its elements. She uttered an hysterical cry, and fell down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly preparing to alight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are, and attend to the horse!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, peremptorily\r\nthrowing her the reins and the whip. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk the horse to the top: I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee to the woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear? Clk\xe2\x80\x94Poppet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth did you come here? I thought you were miles away, or\r\ndead! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you write to me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy to the woman, in a\r\nstrangely gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heaven\xe2\x80\x94I wish I had more to give you! Here\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94wretched\xe2\x80\x94the merest\r\ntrifle. It is every farthing I have left. I have none but what my wife\r\ngives me, you know, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t ask her now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only another moment,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Troy; \xe2\x80\x9cand now listen. Where\r\nare you going to-night? Casterbridge Union?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I thought to go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t go there; yet, wait. Yes, perhaps for to-night; I can do\r\nnothing better\xe2\x80\x94worse luck! Sleep there to-night, and stay there\r\nto-morrow. Monday is the first free day I have; and on Monday morning,\r\nat ten exactly, meet me on Grey\xe2\x80\x99s Bridge just out of the town. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring all the money I can muster. You shan\xe2\x80\x99t want\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that, Fanny;\r\nthen I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a lodging somewhere. Good-bye till then. I am a\r\nbrute\xe2\x80\x94but good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter advancing the distance which completed the ascent of the hill,\r\nBathsheba turned her head. The woman was upon her feet, and Bathsheba\r\nsaw her withdrawing from Troy, and going feebly down the hill by the\r\nthird milestone from Casterbridge. Troy then came on towards his wife,\r\nstepped into the gig, took the reins from her hand, and without making\r\nany observation whipped the horse into a trot. He was rather agitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who that woman was?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, looking searchingly\r\ninto his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking boldly back into hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you did,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with angry hauteur, and still regarding\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly seemed to think that frankness would benefit neither of the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to either of us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know her by sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink if you will, and be\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The sentence was completed by a smart cut\r\nof the whip round Poppet\xe2\x80\x99s flank, which caused the animal to start\r\nforward at a wild pace. No more was said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\nON CASTERBRIDGE HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time the woman walked on. Her steps became feebler,\r\nand she strained her eyes to look afar upon the naked road, now\r\nindistinct amid the penumbr\xc3\xa6 of night. At length her onward walk\r\ndwindled to the merest totter, and she opened a gate within which was a\r\nhaystack. Underneath this she sat down and presently slept.\r\n\r\nWhen the woman awoke it was to find herself in the depths of a moonless\r\nand starless night. A heavy unbroken crust of cloud stretched across\r\nthe sky, shutting out every speck of heaven; and a distant halo which\r\nhung over the town of Casterbridge was visible against the black\r\nconcave, the luminosity appearing the brighter by its great contrast\r\nwith the circumscribing darkness. Towards this weak, soft glow the\r\nwoman turned her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get there!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMeet him the day after\r\nto-morrow: God help me! Perhaps I shall be in my grave before then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA manor-house clock from the far depths of shadow struck the hour, one,\r\nin a small, attenuated tone. After midnight the voice of a clock seems\r\nto lose in breadth as much as in length, and to diminish its\r\nsonorousness to a thin falsetto.\r\n\r\nAfterwards a light\xe2\x80\x94two lights\xe2\x80\x94arose from the remote shade, and grew\r\nlarger. A carriage rolled along the road, and passed the gate. It\r\nprobably contained some late diners-out. The beams from one lamp shone\r\nfor a moment upon the crouching woman, and threw her face into vivid\r\nrelief. The face was young in the groundwork, old in the finish; the\r\ngeneral contours were flexuous and childlike, but the finer lineaments\r\nhad begun to be sharp and thin.\r\n\r\nThe pedestrian stood up, apparently with revived determination, and\r\nlooked around. The road appeared to be familiar to her, and she\r\ncarefully scanned the fence as she slowly walked along. Presently there\r\nbecame visible a dim white shape; it was another milestone. She drew\r\nher fingers across its face to feel the marks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo more!\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nShe leant against the stone as a means of rest for a short interval,\r\nthen bestirred herself, and again pursued her way. For a slight\r\ndistance she bore up bravely, afterwards flagging as before. This was\r\nbeside a lone copsewood, wherein heaps of white chips strewn upon the\r\nleafy ground showed that woodmen had been faggoting and making hurdles\r\nduring the day. Now there was not a rustle, not a breeze, not the\r\nfaintest clash of twigs to keep her company. The woman looked over the\r\ngate, opened it, and went in. Close to the entrance stood a row of\r\nfaggots, bound and unbound, together with stakes of all sizes.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the wayfarer stood with that tense stillness which\r\nsignifies itself to be not the end, but merely the suspension, of a\r\nprevious motion. Her attitude was that of a person who listens, either\r\nto the external world of sound, or to the imagined discourse of\r\nthought. A close criticism might have detected signs proving that she\r\nwas intent on the latter alternative. Moreover, as was shown by what\r\nfollowed, she was oddly exercising the faculty of invention upon the\r\nspeciality of the clever Jacquet Droz, the designer of automatic\r\nsubstitutes for human limbs.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of the Casterbridge aurora, and by feeling with her hands,\r\nthe woman selected two sticks from the heaps. These sticks were nearly\r\nstraight to the height of three or four feet, where each branched into\r\na fork like the letter Y. She sat down, snapped off the small upper\r\ntwigs, and carried the remainder with her into the road. She placed one\r\nof these forks under each arm as a crutch, tested them, timidly threw\r\nher whole weight upon them\xe2\x80\x94so little that it was\xe2\x80\x94and swung herself\r\nforward. The girl had made for herself a material aid.\r\n\r\nThe crutches answered well. The pat of her feet, and the tap of her\r\nsticks upon the highway, were all the sounds that came from the\r\ntraveller now. She had passed the last milestone by a good long\r\ndistance, and began to look wistfully towards the bank as if\r\ncalculating upon another milestone soon. The crutches, though so very\r\nuseful, had their limits of power. Mechanism only transfers labour,\r\nbeing powerless to supersede it, and the original amount of exertion\r\nwas not cleared away; it was thrown into the body and arms. She was\r\nexhausted, and each swing forward became fainter. At last she swayed\r\nsideways, and fell.\r\n\r\nHere she lay, a shapeless heap, for ten minutes and more. The morning\r\nwind began to boom dully over the flats, and to move afresh dead leaves\r\nwhich had lain still since yesterday. The woman desperately turned\r\nround upon her knees, and next rose to her feet. Steadying herself by\r\nthe help of one crutch, she essayed a step, then another, then a third,\r\nusing the crutches now as walking-sticks only. Thus she progressed till\r\ndescending Mellstock Hill another milestone appeared, and soon the\r\nbeginning of an iron-railed fence came into view. She staggered across\r\nto the first post, clung to it, and looked around.\r\n\r\nThe Casterbridge lights were now individually visible. It was getting\r\ntowards morning, and vehicles might be hoped for, if not expected soon.\r\nShe listened. There was not a sound of life save that acme and\r\nsublimation of all dismal sounds, the bark of a fox, its three hollow\r\nnotes being rendered at intervals of a minute with the precision of a\r\nfuneral bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess than a mile!\xe2\x80\x9d the woman murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; more,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, after a\r\npause. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mile is to the county hall, and my resting-place is on the\r\nother side Casterbridge. A little over a mile, and there I am!\xe2\x80\x9d After\r\nan interval she again spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cFive or six steps to a yard\xe2\x80\x94six perhaps.\r\nI have to go seventeen hundred yards. A hundred times six, six hundred.\r\nSeventeen times that. O pity me, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHolding to the rails, she advanced, thrusting one hand forward upon the\r\nrail, then the other, then leaning over it whilst she dragged her feet\r\non beneath.\r\n\r\nThis woman was not given to soliloquy; but extremity of feeling lessens\r\nthe individuality of the weak, as it increases that of the strong. She\r\nsaid again in the same tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll believe that the end lies five posts\r\nforward, and no further, and so get strength to pass them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a practical application of the principle that a half-feigned\r\nand fictitious faith is better than no faith at all.\r\n\r\nShe passed five posts and held on to the fifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pass five more by believing my longed-for spot is at the next\r\nfifth. I can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed five more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lies only five further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed five more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is five further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat stone bridge is the end of my journey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when the bridge\r\nover the Froom was in view.\r\n\r\nShe crawled to the bridge. During the effort each breath of the woman\r\nwent into the air as if never to return again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for the truth of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sitting down. \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth\r\nis, that I have less than half a mile.\xe2\x80\x9d Self-beguilement with what she\r\nhad known all the time to be false had given her strength to come over\r\nhalf a mile that she would have been powerless to face in the lump. The\r\nartifice showed that the woman, by some mysterious intuition, had\r\ngrasped the paradoxical truth that blindness may operate more\r\nvigorously than prescience, and the short-sighted effect more than the\r\nfar-seeing; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness, is needed for\r\nstriking a blow.\r\n\r\nThe half-mile stood now before the sick and weary woman like a stolid\r\nJuggernaut. It was an impassive King of her world. The road here ran\r\nacross Durnover Moor, open to the road on either side. She surveyed the\r\nwide space, the lights, herself, sighed, and lay down against a\r\nguard-stone of the bridge.\r\n\r\nNever was ingenuity exercised so sorely as the traveller here exercised\r\nhers. Every conceivable aid, method, stratagem, mechanism, by which\r\nthese last desperate eight hundred yards could be overpassed by a human\r\nbeing unperceived, was revolved in her busy brain, and dismissed as\r\nimpracticable. She thought of sticks, wheels, crawling\xe2\x80\x94she even thought\r\nof rolling. But the exertion demanded by either of these latter two was\r\ngreater than to walk erect. The faculty of contrivance was worn out.\r\nHopelessness had come at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo further!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the stripe of shadow on the opposite side of the bridge a portion\r\nof shade seemed to detach itself and move into isolation upon the pale\r\nwhite of the road. It glided noiselessly towards the recumbent woman.\r\n\r\nShe became conscious of something touching her hand; it was softness\r\nand it was warmth. She opened her eyes, and the substance touched her\r\nface. A dog was licking her cheek.\r\n\r\nHe was a huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing darkly against the\r\nlow horizon, and at least two feet higher than the present position of\r\nher eyes. Whether Newfoundland, mastiff, bloodhound, or what not, it\r\nwas impossible to say. He seemed to be of too strange and mysterious a\r\nnature to belong to any variety among those of popular nomenclature.\r\nBeing thus assignable to no breed, he was the ideal embodiment of\r\ncanine greatness\xe2\x80\x94a generalization from what was common to all. Night,\r\nin its sad, solemn, and benevolent aspect, apart from its stealthy and\r\ncruel side, was personified in this form. Darkness endows the small and\r\nordinary ones among mankind with poetical power, and even the suffering\r\nwoman threw her idea into figure.\r\n\r\nIn her reclining position she looked up to him just as in earlier times\r\nshe had, when standing, looked up to a man. The animal, who was as\r\nhomeless as she, respectfully withdrew a step or two when the woman\r\nmoved, and, seeing that she did not repulse him, he licked her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA thought moved within her like lightning. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I can make use of\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94I might do it then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and the dog seemed to\r\nmisunderstand: he trotted on. Then, finding she could not follow, he\r\ncame back and whined.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate and saddest singularity of woman\xe2\x80\x99s effort and invention\r\nwas reached when, with a quickened breathing, she rose to a stooping\r\nposture, and, resting her two little arms upon the shoulders of the\r\ndog, leant firmly thereon, and murmured stimulating words. Whilst she\r\nsorrowed in her heart she cheered with her voice, and what was stranger\r\nthan that the strong should need encouragement from the weak was that\r\ncheerfulness should be so well stimulated by such utter dejection. Her\r\nfriend moved forward slowly, and she with small mincing steps moved\r\nforward beside him, half her weight being thrown upon the animal.\r\nSometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking erect, from the\r\ncrutches, from the rails. The dog, who now thoroughly understood her\r\ndesire and her incapacity, was frantic in his distress on these\r\noccasions; he would tug at her dress and run forward. She always called\r\nhim back, and it was now to be observed that the woman listened for\r\nhuman sounds only to avoid them. It was evident that she had an object\r\nin keeping her presence on the road and her forlorn state unknown.\r\n\r\nTheir progress was necessarily very slow. They reached the bottom of\r\nthe town, and the Casterbridge lamps lay before them like fallen\r\nPleiads as they turned to the left into the dense shade of a deserted\r\navenue of chestnuts, and so skirted the borough. Thus the town was\r\npassed, and the goal was reached.\r\n\r\nOn this much-desired spot outside the town rose a picturesque building.\r\nOriginally it had been a mere case to hold people. The shell had been\r\nso thin, so devoid of excrescence, and so closely drawn over the\r\naccommodation granted, that the grim character of what was beneath\r\nshowed through it, as the shape of a body is visible under a\r\nwinding-sheet.\r\n\r\nThen Nature, as if offended, lent a hand. Masses of ivy grew up,\r\ncompletely covering the walls, till the place looked like an abbey; and\r\nit was discovered that the view from the front, over the Casterbridge\r\nchimneys, was one of the most magnificent in the county. A neighbouring\r\nearl once said that he would give up a year\xe2\x80\x99s rental to have at his own\r\ndoor the view enjoyed by the inmates from theirs\xe2\x80\x94and very probably the\r\ninmates would have given up the view for his year\xe2\x80\x99s rental.\r\n\r\nThis stone edifice consisted of a central mass and two wings, whereon\r\nstood as sentinels a few slim chimneys, now gurgling sorrowfully to the\r\nslow wind. In the wall was a gate, and by the gate a bellpull formed of\r\na hanging wire. The woman raised herself as high as possible upon her\r\nknees, and could just reach the handle. She moved it and fell forwards\r\nin a bowed attitude, her face upon her bosom.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on towards six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and sounds of movement were to\r\nbe heard inside the building which was the haven of rest to this\r\nwearied soul. A little door by the large one was opened, and a man\r\nappeared inside. He discerned the panting heap of clothes, went back\r\nfor a light, and came again. He entered a second time, and returned\r\nwith two women.\r\n\r\nThese lifted the prostrate figure and assisted her in through the\r\ndoorway. The man then closed the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did she get here?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord knows,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a dog outside,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the overcome traveller. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he\r\ngone? He helped me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stoned him away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\nThe little procession then moved forward\xe2\x80\x94the man in front bearing the\r\nlight, the two bony women next, supporting between them the small and\r\nsupple one. Thus they entered the house and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\nSUSPICION\xe2\x80\x94FANNY IS SENT FOR\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba said very little to her husband all that evening of their\r\nreturn from market, and he was not disposed to say much to her. He\r\nexhibited the unpleasant combination of a restless condition with a\r\nsilent tongue. The next day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the\r\nsame manner as regarded their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church\r\nboth morning and afternoon. This was the day before the Budmouth races.\r\nIn the evening Troy said, suddenly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer countenance instantly sank. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, I want it badly.\xe2\x80\x9d The anxiety upon Troy\xe2\x80\x99s face was\r\nunusual and very marked. It was a culmination of the mood he had been\r\nin all the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! for those races to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy for the moment made no reply. Her mistake had its advantages to a\r\nman who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nsuppose I do want it for races?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of entreaty\r\nin the words. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly such a few weeks ago you said that I was far\r\nsweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that you would\r\ngive them all up for me; and now, won\xe2\x80\x99t you give up this one, which is\r\nmore a worry than a pleasure? Do, Frank. Come, let me fascinate you by\r\nall I can do\xe2\x80\x94by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I can\r\nthink of\xe2\x80\x94to stay at home. Say yes to your wife\xe2\x80\x94say yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s nature were prominent\r\nnow\xe2\x80\x94advanced impulsively for his acceptance, without any of the\r\ndisguises and defences which the wariness of her character when she was\r\ncool too frequently threw over them. Few men could have resisted the\r\narch yet dignified entreaty of the beautiful face, thrown a little back\r\nand sideways in the well known attitude that expresses more than the\r\nwords it accompanies, and which seems to have been designed for these\r\nspecial occasions. Had the woman not been his wife, Troy would have\r\nsuccumbed instantly; as it was, he thought he would not deceive her\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe money is not wanted for racing debts at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it for?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou worry me a great deal by these\r\nmysterious responsibilities, Frank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy hesitated. He did not now love her enough to allow himself to be\r\ncarried too far by her ways. Yet it was necessary to be civil. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwrong me by such a suspicious manner,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch\r\nstrait-waistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so\r\nearly a date.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nwith features between a smile and a pout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the latter.\r\nBathsheba, fun is all very well, but don\xe2\x80\x99t go too far, or you may have\r\ncause to regret something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reddened. \xe2\x80\x9cI do that already,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you regret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat my romance has come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll romances end at marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that. You grieve me to my soul by being\r\nsmart at my expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot you\xe2\x80\x94only your faults. I do hate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twould be much more becoming if you set yourself to cure them. Come,\r\nlet\xe2\x80\x99s strike a balance with the twenty pounds, and be friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave a sigh of resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cI have about that sum here for\r\nhousehold expenses. If you must have it, take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Thank you. I expect I shall have gone away before you are\r\nin to breakfast to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must you go? Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have taken\r\na good many promises to other people to drag you away from me. You used\r\nto call me darling, then. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to you how my days are\r\npassed now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go, in spite of sentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d Troy, as he spoke, looked at his\r\nwatch, and, apparently actuated by _non lucendo_ principles, opened the\r\ncase at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil of\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she\r\nsaw the action and saw the hair. She flushed in pain and surprise, and\r\nsome words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it was\r\nwise to utter them. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s curl of hair!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Frank,\r\nwhose is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy had instantly closed his watch. He carelessly replied, as one who\r\ncloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yours, of\r\ncourse. Whose should it be? I had quite forgotten that I had it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a dreadful fib, Frank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I had forgotten it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that\xe2\x80\x94it was yellow hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s insulting me. I know it was yellow. Now whose was it? I want to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, so make no more ado. It is the hair of a\r\nyoung woman I was going to marry before I knew you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to tell me her name, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she married yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful\r\naffliction!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffliction\xe2\x80\x94what affliction?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving hair of that dreadful colour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94ho\xe2\x80\x94I like that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, recovering himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, her hair has\r\nbeen admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose,\r\nwhich has not been long. It is beautiful hair. People used to turn\r\ntheir heads to look at it, poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, in incipient\r\naccents of pique. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I cared for your love as much as I used to I\r\ncould say people had turned to look at mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so fitful and jealous. You knew what married life\r\nwould be like, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have entered it if you feared these\r\ncontingencies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in\r\nher throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full. Ashamed as\r\nshe was to show emotion, at last she burst out:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all I get for loving you so well! Ah! when I married you your\r\nlife was dearer to me than my own. I would have died for you\xe2\x80\x94how truly\r\nI can say that I would have died for you! And now you sneer at my\r\nfoolishness in marrying you. O! is it kind to me to throw my mistake in\r\nmy face? Whatever opinion you may have of my wisdom, you should not\r\ntell me of it so mercilessly, now that I am in your power.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help how things fall out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy; \xe2\x80\x9cupon my heart, women\r\nwill be the death of me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep people\xe2\x80\x99s hair. You\xe2\x80\x99ll burn it, won\xe2\x80\x99t you,\r\nFrank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrank went on as if he had not heard her. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are considerations\r\neven before my consideration for you; reparations to be made\xe2\x80\x94ties you\r\nknow nothing of. If you repent of marrying, so do I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled tones\r\nof wretchedness and coaxing, \xe2\x80\x9cI only repent it if you don\xe2\x80\x99t love me\r\nbetter than any woman in the world! I don\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise, Frank. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrepent because you already love somebody better than you love me, do\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Why do you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t burn that curl. You like the woman who owns that pretty\r\nhair\xe2\x80\x94yes; it is pretty\xe2\x80\x94more beautiful than my miserable black mane!\r\nWell, it is no use; I can\xe2\x80\x99t help being ugly. You must like her best, if\r\nyou will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have never looked upon\r\nthat bit of hair for several months\xe2\x80\x94that I am ready to swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut just now you said \xe2\x80\x98ties\xe2\x80\x99; and then\xe2\x80\x94that woman we met?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it hers, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are\r\ncontent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are the ties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that meant nothing\xe2\x80\x94a mere jest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mere jest!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in mournful astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you jest when I\r\nam so wretchedly in earnest? Tell me the truth, Frank. I am not a fool,\r\nyou know, although I am a woman, and have my woman\xe2\x80\x99s moments. Come!\r\ntreat me fairly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking honestly and fearlessly into his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want much; bare justice\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all! Ah! once I felt I\r\ncould be content with nothing less than the highest homage from the\r\nhusband I should choose. Now, anything short of cruelty will content\r\nme. Yes! the independent and spirited Bathsheba is come to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t be so desperate!\xe2\x80\x9d Troy said, snappishly,\r\nrising as he did so, and leaving the room.\r\n\r\nDirectly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs\xe2\x80\x94dry-eyed sobs,\r\nwhich cut as they came, without any softening by tears. But she\r\ndetermined to repress all evidences of feeling. She was conquered; but\r\nshe would never own it as long as she lived. Her pride was indeed\r\nbrought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by marriage\r\nwith a less pure nature than her own. She chafed to and fro in\r\nrebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her whole soul was in arms, and\r\nthe blood fired her face. Until she had met Troy, Bathsheba had been\r\nproud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to know\r\nthat her lips had been touched by no man\xe2\x80\x99s on earth\xe2\x80\x94that her waist had\r\nnever been encircled by a lover\xe2\x80\x99s arm. She hated herself now. In those\r\nearlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for girls who\r\nwere the slaves of the first good-looking young fellow who should\r\nchoose to salute them. She had never taken kindly to the idea of\r\nmarriage in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about\r\nher. In the turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to\r\nmarry him; but the perception that had accompanied her happiest hours\r\non this account was rather that of self-sacrifice than of promotion and\r\nhonour. Although she scarcely knew the divinity\xe2\x80\x99s name, Diana was the\r\ngoddess whom Bathsheba instinctively adored. That she had never, by\r\nlook, word, or sign, encouraged a man to approach her\xe2\x80\x94that she had felt\r\nherself sufficient to herself, and had in the independence of her\r\ngirlish heart fancied there was a certain degradation in renouncing the\r\nsimplicity of a maiden existence to become the humbler half of an\r\nindifferent matrimonial whole\xe2\x80\x94were facts now bitterly remembered. Oh,\r\nif she had never stooped to folly of this kind, respectable as it was,\r\nand could only stand again, as she had stood on the hill at Norcombe,\r\nand dare Troy or any other man to pollute a hair of her head by his\r\ninterference!\r\n\r\nThe next morning she rose earlier than usual, and had the horse saddled\r\nfor her ride round the farm in the customary way. When she came in at\r\nhalf-past eight\xe2\x80\x94their usual hour for breakfasting\xe2\x80\x94she was informed that\r\nher husband had risen, taken his breakfast, and driven off to\r\nCasterbridge with the gig and Poppet.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast she was cool and collected\xe2\x80\x94quite herself in fact\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe rambled to the gate, intending to walk to another quarter of the\r\nfarm, which she still personally superintended as well as her duties in\r\nthe house would permit, continually, however, finding herself preceded\r\nin forethought by Gabriel Oak, for whom she began to entertain the\r\ngenuine friendship of a sister. Of course, she sometimes thought of him\r\nin the light of an old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what life\r\nwith him as a husband would have been like; also of life with Boldwood\r\nunder the same conditions. But Bathsheba, though she could feel, was\r\nnot much given to futile dreaming, and her musings under this head were\r\nshort and entirely confined to the times when Troy\xe2\x80\x99s neglect was more\r\nthan ordinarily evident.\r\n\r\nShe saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood. It was Mr.\r\nBoldwood. Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched. The farmer stopped\r\nwhen still a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel Oak, who was\r\nin a footpath across the field. The two men then approached each other\r\nand seemed to engage in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\nThus they continued for a long time. Joseph Poorgrass now passed near\r\nthem, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\r\nBoldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a few minutes, and\r\nthen all three parted, Joseph immediately coming up the hill with his\r\nbarrow.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise, experienced\r\ngreat relief when Boldwood turned back again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmessage, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect\r\nthat a conversation with a lady required, spoke to Bathsheba over the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll never see Fanny Robin no more\xe2\x80\x94use nor principal\xe2\x80\x94ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s dead in the Union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFanny dead\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she die from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was\r\nfrom general neshness of constitution. She was such a limber maid that\r\n\xe2\x80\x99a could stand no hardship, even when I knowed her, and \xe2\x80\x99a went like a\r\ncandle-snoff, so \xe2\x80\x99tis said. She was took bad in the morning, and, being\r\nquite feeble and worn out, she died in the evening. She belongs by law\r\nto our parish; and Mr. Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this\r\nafternoon to fetch her home here and bury her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I shall not let Mr. Boldwood do any such thing\xe2\x80\x94I shall do it!\r\nFanny was my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s servant, and, although I only knew her for a\r\ncouple of days, she belongs to me. How very, very sad this is!\xe2\x80\x94the idea\r\nof Fanny being in a workhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba had begun to know what\r\nsuffering was, and she spoke with real feeling.... \xe2\x80\x9cSend across to Mr.\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s, and say that Mrs. Troy will take upon herself the duty of\r\nfetching an old servant of the family.... We ought not to put her in a\r\nwaggon; we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a hearse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will hardly be time, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, will there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, musingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you say we must be at the\r\ndoor\xe2\x80\x94three o\xe2\x80\x99clock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree o\xe2\x80\x99clock this afternoon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, so to speak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well\xe2\x80\x94you go with it. A pretty waggon is better than an ugly\r\nhearse, after all. Joseph, have the new spring waggon with the blue\r\nbody and red wheels, and wash it very clean. And, Joseph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her\r\ncoffin\xe2\x80\x94indeed, gather a great many, and completely bury her in them.\r\nGet some boughs of laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew, and\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s-love; ay, and some bunches of chrysanthemum. And let old Pleasant\r\ndraw her, because she knew him so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of\r\nfour labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate,\r\nand take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of\r\nGuardians, as by law ordained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me\xe2\x80\x94Casterbridge Union\xe2\x80\x94and is Fanny come to this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba,\r\nmusing. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had known of it sooner. I thought she was far away.\r\nHow long has she lived there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn\xe2\x80\x99y been there a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x94then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. She first went to live in a garrison-town t\xe2\x80\x99other side o\xe2\x80\x99 Wessex,\r\nand since then she\xe2\x80\x99s been picking up a living at seampstering in\r\nMelchester for several months, at the house of a very respectable\r\nwidow-woman who takes in work of that sort. She only got handy the\r\nUnion-house on Sunday morning \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve, and \xe2\x80\x99tis supposed here and\r\nthere that she had traipsed every step of the way from Melchester. Why\r\nshe left her place, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and as to a lie,\r\nwhy, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the short of the story, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-h!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than\r\nchanged the young wife\xe2\x80\x99s countenance whilst this word came from her in\r\na long-drawn breath. \xe2\x80\x9cDid she walk along our turnpike-road?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nin a suddenly restless and eager voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe she did.... Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, shall I call Liddy? You bain\xe2\x80\x99t well,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, surely? You look like a lily\xe2\x80\x94so pale and fainty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; don\xe2\x80\x99t call her; it is nothing. When did she pass Weatherbury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast Saturday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do, Joseph; now you may go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoseph, come hither a moment. What was the colour of Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, mistress, now that \xe2\x80\x99tis put to me so judge-and-jury like, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind, if ye\xe2\x80\x99ll believe me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; go on and do what I told you. Stop\xe2\x80\x94well no, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned herself away from him, that he might no longer notice the\r\nmood which had set its sign so visibly upon her, and went indoors with\r\na distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow. About an hour\r\nafter, she heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a\r\npainful consciousness of her bewildered and troubled look. Joseph,\r\ndressed in his best suit of clothes, was putting in the horse to start.\r\nThe shrubs and flowers were all piled in the waggon, as she had\r\ndirected; Bathsheba hardly saw them now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDied of what? did you say, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, quite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died\r\nin the evening without further parley. What Oak and Mr. Boldwood told\r\nme was only these few words. \xe2\x80\x98Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nGabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very\r\nsorry, and I said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x94and how did she come to die?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead\r\nin Casterbridge Union,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and perhaps \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t much matter about\r\nhow she came to die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and\r\ndied in the afternoon\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s clear enough.\xe2\x80\x99 Then I asked what she\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbeen doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood turned round to me then, and left\r\noff spitting a thistle with the end of his stick. He told me about her\r\nhaving lived by seampstering in Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and\r\nthat she walked therefrom at the end of last week, passing near here\r\nSaturday night in the dusk. They then said I had better just name a\r\nhint of her death to you, and away they went. Her death might have been\r\nbrought on by biding in the night wind, you know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; for people\r\nused to say she\xe2\x80\x99d go off in a decline: she used to cough a good deal in\r\nwinter time. However, \xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t much odds to us about that now, for \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nall over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard a different story at all?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him so\r\nintently that Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s eyes quailed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word, mistress, I assure \xe2\x80\x99ee!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHardly anybody in the\r\nparish knows the news yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why Gabriel didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring the message to me himself. He mostly\r\nmakes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand.\xe2\x80\x9d These words\r\nwere merely murmured, and she was looking upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he was busy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd sometimes he seems\r\nto suffer from things upon his mind, connected with the time when he\r\nwas better off than \xe2\x80\x99a is now. \xe2\x80\x99A\xe2\x80\x99s rather a curious item, but a very\r\nunderstanding shepherd, and learned in books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot but say that there did, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He was terrible down, and so\r\nwas Farmer Boldwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Joseph. That will do. Go on now, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again. In the course of the\r\nafternoon she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the colour of poor Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s hair? Do you know? I cannot\r\nrecollect\xe2\x80\x94I only saw her for a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was light, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away\r\nunder her cap, so that you would hardly notice it. But I have seen her\r\nlet it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful then.\r\nReal golden hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer young man was a soldier, was he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. In the same regiment as Mr. Troy. He says he knew him very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Mr. Troy says so? How came he to say that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nman. He said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, he knew the young man as well as he knew\r\nhimself, and that there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man in the regiment he liked better.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Said that, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and he said there was a strong likeness between himself and the\r\nother young man, so that sometimes people mistook them\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake stop your talking!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, with the\r\nnervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\nJOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN\xe2\x80\x94BUCK\xe2\x80\x99S HEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nA wall bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-house, except along a\r\nportion of the end. Here a high gable stood prominent, and it was\r\ncovered like the front with a mat of ivy. In this gable was no window,\r\nchimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind. The single feature\r\nappertaining to it, beyond the expanse of dark green leaves, was a\r\nsmall door.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the door was peculiar. The sill was three or four feet\r\nabove the ground, and for a moment one was at a loss for an explanation\r\nof this exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately beneath suggested\r\nthat the door was used solely for the passage of articles and persons\r\nto and from the level of a vehicle standing on the outside. Upon the\r\nwhole, the door seemed to advertise itself as a species of Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGate translated to another sphere. That entry and exit hereby was only\r\nat rare intervals became apparent on noting that tufts of grass were\r\nallowed to flourish undisturbed in the chinks of the sill.\r\n\r\nAs the clock over the South-street Alms-house pointed to five minutes\r\nto three, a blue spring waggon, picked out with red, and containing\r\nboughs and flowers, passed the end of the street, and up towards this\r\nside of the building. Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out a\r\nshattered form of \xe2\x80\x9cMalbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d Joseph Poorgrass rang the bell, and\r\nreceived directions to back his waggon against the high door under the\r\ngable. The door then opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust\r\nforth, and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nOne of the men then stepped up beside it, took from his pocket a lump\r\nof chalk, and wrote upon the cover the name and a few other words in a\r\nlarge scrawling hand. (We believe that they do these things more\r\ntenderly now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a black\r\ncloth, threadbare, but decent, the tail-board of the waggon was\r\nreturned to its place, one of the men handed a certificate of registry\r\nto Poorgrass, and both entered the door, closing it behind them. Their\r\nconnection with her, short as it had been, was over for ever.\r\n\r\nJoseph then placed the flowers as enjoined, and the evergreens around\r\nthe flowers, till it was difficult to divine what the waggon contained;\r\nhe smacked his whip, and the rather pleasing funeral car crept down the\r\nhill, and along the road to Weatherbury.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon drew on apace, and, looking to the right towards the sea\r\nas he walked beside the horse, Poorgrass saw strange clouds and scrolls\r\nof mist rolling over the long ridges which girt the landscape in that\r\nquarter. They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently crept across\r\nthe intervening valleys, and around the withered papery flags of the\r\nmoor and river brinks. Then their dank spongy forms closed in upon the\r\nsky. It was a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had their\r\nroots in the neighbouring sea, and by the time that horse, man, and\r\ncorpse entered Yalbury Great Wood, these silent workings of an\r\ninvisible hand had reached them, and they were completely enveloped,\r\nthis being the first arrival of the autumn fogs, and the first fog of\r\nthe series.\r\n\r\nThe air was as an eye suddenly struck blind. The waggon and its load\r\nrolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and\r\nopacity, but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor\r\nthroughout. There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a visible\r\ndrop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches, and firs\r\ncomposing the wood on either side. The trees stood in an attitude of\r\nintentness, as if they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock\r\nthem. A startling quiet overhung all surrounding things\xe2\x80\x94so completely,\r\nthat the crunching of the waggon-wheels was as a great noise, and small\r\nrustles, which had never obtained a hearing except by night, were\r\ndistinctly individualized.\r\n\r\nJoseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed faintly\r\nthrough the flowering laurustinus, then at the unfathomable gloom amid\r\nthe high trees on each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectre-like\r\nin their monochrome of grey. He felt anything but cheerful, and wished\r\nhe had the company even of a child or dog. Stopping the horse, he\r\nlistened. Not a footstep or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the\r\ndead silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from a tree\r\nthrough the evergreens and alighting with a smart rap upon the coffin\r\nof poor Fanny. The fog had by this time saturated the trees, and this\r\nwas the first dropping of water from the overbrimming leaves. The\r\nhollow echo of its fall reminded the waggoner painfully of the grim\r\nLeveller. Then hard by came down another drop, then two or three.\r\nPresently there was a continual tapping of these heavy drops upon the\r\ndead leaves, the road, and the travellers. The nearer boughs were\r\nbeaded with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and the rusty-red\r\nleaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops, like diamonds on\r\nauburn hair.\r\n\r\nAt the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond this wood, was the\r\nold inn Buck\xe2\x80\x99s Head. It was about a mile and a half from Weatherbury,\r\nand in the meridian times of stage-coach travelling had been the place\r\nwhere many coaches changed and kept their relays of horses. All the old\r\nstabling was now pulled down, and little remained besides the habitable\r\ninn itself, which, standing a little way back from the road, signified\r\nits existence to people far up and down the highway by a sign hanging\r\nfrom the horizontal bough of an elm on the opposite side of the way.\r\n\r\nTravellers\xe2\x80\x94for the variety _tourist_ had hardly developed into a\r\ndistinct species at this date\xe2\x80\x94sometimes said in passing, when they cast\r\ntheir eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond of\r\nrepresenting the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves had\r\nnever before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working order. It\r\nwas near this tree that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak\r\ncrept on his first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing to the darkness,\r\nthe sign and the inn had been unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the inn were of the old-established type. Indeed, in the\r\nminds of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formul\xc3\xa6: _e.g._\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nRap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.\r\nFor tobacco, shout.\r\nIn calling for the girl in waiting, say, \xe2\x80\x9cMaid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDitto for the landlady, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Soul!\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to Joseph\xe2\x80\x99s heart when the friendly signboard came in\r\nview, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to\r\nfulfil an intention made a long time before. His spirits were oozing\r\nout of him quite. He turned the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head to the green bank, and\r\nentered the hostel for a mug of ale.\r\n\r\nGoing down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor of which was a step\r\nbelow the passage, which in its turn was a step below the road outside,\r\nwhat should Joseph see to gladden his eyes but two copper-coloured\r\ndiscs, in the form of the countenances of Mr. Jan Coggan and Mr. Mark\r\nClark. These owners of the two most appreciative throats in the\r\nneighbourhood, within the pale of respectability, were now sitting face\r\nto face over a three-legged circular table, having an iron rim to keep\r\ncups and pots from being accidentally elbowed off; they might have been\r\nsaid to resemble the setting sun and the full moon shining _vis-\xc3\xa0-vis_\r\nacross the globe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, \xe2\x80\x99tis neighbour Poorgrass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure your face\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t praise your mistress\xe2\x80\x99s table, Joseph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very pale companion for the last four miles,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph,\r\nindulging in a shudder toned down by resignation. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to speak the\r\ntruth, \xe2\x80\x99twas beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t seed the\r\ncolour of victuals or drink since breakfast time this morning, and that\r\nwas no more than a dew-bit afield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen drink, Joseph, and don\xe2\x80\x99t restrain yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, handing\r\nhim a hooped mug three-quarters full.\r\n\r\nJoseph drank for a moderately long time, then for a longer time,\r\nsaying, as he lowered the jug, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis pretty drinking\xe2\x80\x94very pretty\r\ndrinking, and is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to\r\nspeak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, drink is a pleasant delight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jan, as one who repeated a\r\ntruism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over\r\nhis tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head gradually\r\nbackwards, with closed eyes, that his expectant soul might not be\r\ndiverted for one instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must be on again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cNot but that I should like\r\nanother nip with ye; but the parish might lose confidence in me if I\r\nwas seed here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere be ye trading o\xe2\x80\x99t to to-day, then, Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack to Weatherbury. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got poor little Fanny Robin in my waggon\r\noutside, and I must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five\r\nwith her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it. And so she\xe2\x80\x99s nailed up in parish boards after\r\nall, and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave half-crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe parish pays the grave half-crown, but not the bell shilling,\r\nbecause the bell\xe2\x80\x99s a luxery: but \xe2\x80\x99a can hardly do without the grave,\r\npoor body. However, I expect our mistress will pay all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty maid as ever I see! But what\xe2\x80\x99s yer hurry, Joseph? The pore\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s dead, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t bring her to life, and you may as well sit\r\ndown comfortable, and finish another with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more\r\nwith ye, sonnies. But only a few minutes, because \xe2\x80\x99tis as \xe2\x80\x99tis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have another drop. A man\xe2\x80\x99s twice the man afterwards.\r\nYou feel so warm and glorious, and you whop and slap at your work\r\nwithout any trouble, and everything goes on like sticks a-breaking. Too\r\nmuch liquor is bad, and leads us to that horned man in the smoky house;\r\nbut after all, many people haven\xe2\x80\x99t the gift of enjoying a wet, and\r\nsince we be highly favoured with a power that way, we should make the\r\nmost o\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a talent the Lord has mercifully\r\nbestowed upon us, and we ought not to neglect it. But, what with the\r\nparsons and clerks and school-people and serious tea-parties, the merry\r\nold ways of good life have gone to the dogs\xe2\x80\x94upon my carcase, they\r\nhave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, I must be onward again now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, now, Joseph; nonsense! The poor woman is dead, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she, and\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope Providence won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a way with me for my doings,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoseph, again sitting down. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been troubled with weak moments\r\nlately, \xe2\x80\x99tis true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been drinky once this month already, and I did\r\nnot go to church a-Sunday, and I dropped a curse or two yesterday; so I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to go too far for my safety. Your next world is your next\r\nworld, and not to be squandered offhand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe ye to be a chapelmember, Joseph. That I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no! I don\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m staunch Church of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, and faith, so be I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t say much for myself; I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to,\xe2\x80\x9d Coggan continued, with\r\nthat tendency to talk on principles which is characteristic of the\r\nbarley-corn. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve never changed a single doctrine: I\xe2\x80\x99ve stuck like\r\na plaster to the old faith I was born in. Yes; there\xe2\x80\x99s this to be said\r\nfor the Church, a man can belong to the Church and bide in his cheerful\r\nold inn, and never trouble or worry his mind about doctrines at all.\r\nBut to be a meetinger, you must go to chapel in all winds and weathers,\r\nand make yerself as frantic as a skit. Not but that chapel members be\r\nclever chaps enough in their way. They can lift up beautiful prayers\r\nout of their own heads, all about their families and shipwrecks in the\r\nnewspaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x94they can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark, with corroborative feeling; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwe Churchmen, you see, must have it all printed aforehand, or, dang it\r\nall, we should no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the Lord\r\nthan babes unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChapelfolk be more hand-in-glove with them above than we,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoseph, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know very well that if anybody do go to heaven,\r\nthey will. They\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard for it, and they deserve to have it,\r\nsuch as \xe2\x80\x99tis. I bain\xe2\x80\x99t such a fool as to pretend that we who stick to\r\nthe Church have the same chance as they, because we know we have not.\r\nBut I hate a feller who\xe2\x80\x99ll change his old ancient doctrines for the\r\nsake of getting to heaven. I\xe2\x80\x99d as soon turn king\xe2\x80\x99s-evidence for the few\r\npounds you get. Why, neighbours, when every one of my taties were\r\nfrosted, our Parson Thirdly were the man who gave me a sack for seed,\r\nthough he hardly had one for his own use, and no money to buy \xe2\x80\x99em. If\r\nit hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for him, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hae had a tatie to put in my\r\ngarden. D\xe2\x80\x99ye think I\xe2\x80\x99d turn after that? No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to my side; and\r\nif we be in the wrong, so be it: I\xe2\x80\x99ll fall with the fallen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell said\xe2\x80\x94very well said,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joseph.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, folks, I must be\r\nmoving now: upon my life I must. Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Thirdly will be waiting at the\r\nchurch gates, and there\xe2\x80\x99s the woman a-biding outside in the waggon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoseph Poorgrass, don\xe2\x80\x99t be so miserable! Pa\xe2\x80\x99son Thirdly won\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a generous man; he\xe2\x80\x99s found me in tracts for years, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nconsumed a good many in the course of a long and shady life; but he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnever been the man to cry out at the expense. Sit down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his spirit was troubled\r\nby the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon. The minutes\r\nglided by uncounted, until the evening shades began perceptibly to\r\ndeepen, and the eyes of the three were but sparkling points on the\r\nsurface of darkness. Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s repeater struck six from his pocket in\r\nthe usual still small tones.\r\n\r\nAt that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry, and the door opened\r\nto admit the figure of Gabriel Oak, followed by the maid of the inn\r\nbearing a candle. He stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round\r\nfaces of the sitters, which confronted him with the expressions of a\r\nfiddle and a couple of warming-pans. Joseph Poorgrass blinked, and\r\nshrank several inches into the background.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul, I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of you; \xe2\x80\x99tis disgraceful, Joseph,\r\ndisgraceful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cCoggan, you call yourself a\r\nman, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know better than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other of his eyes\r\noccasionally opening and closing of its own accord, as if it were not a\r\nmember, but a dozy individual with a distinct personality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take on so, shepherd!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark, looking reproachfully at\r\nthe candle, which appeared to possess special features of interest for\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody can hurt a dead woman,\xe2\x80\x9d at length said Coggan, with the\r\nprecision of a machine. \xe2\x80\x9cAll that could be done for her is done\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeyond us: and why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for\r\nlifeless clay that can neither feel nor see, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you do\r\nwith her at all? If she\xe2\x80\x99d been alive, I would have been the first to\r\nhelp her. If she now wanted victuals and drink, I\xe2\x80\x99d pay for it, money\r\ndown. But she\xe2\x80\x99s dead, and no speed of ours will bring her to life. The\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s past us\xe2\x80\x94time spent upon her is throwed away: why should we\r\nhurry to do what\xe2\x80\x99s not required? Drink, shepherd, and be friends, for\r\nto-morrow we may be like her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mark Clark, emphatically, at once drinking himself, to\r\nrun no further risk of losing his chance by the event alluded to, Jan\r\nmeanwhile merging his additional thoughts of to-morrow in a song:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n        To-mor-row, to-mor-row!\r\nAnd while peace and plen-ty I find at my board,\r\n    With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row,\r\nWith my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford,\r\n    And let them spread the ta-ble to-mor-row.\r\n        To-mor-row, to-mor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo hold thy horning, Jan!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak; and turning upon Poorgrass, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nfor you, Joseph, who do your wicked deeds in such confoundedly holy\r\nways, you are as drunk as you can stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Shepherd Oak, no! Listen to reason, shepherd. All that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmatter with me is the affliction called a multiplying eye, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhow it is I look double to you\xe2\x80\x94I mean, you look double to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA multiplying eye is a very bad thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Clark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt always comes on when I have been in a public-house a little time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Joseph Poorgrass, meekly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I see two of every sort, as if I\r\nwere some holy man living in the times of King Noah and entering into\r\nthe ark.... Y-y-y-yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, becoming much affected by the picture\r\nof himself as a person thrown away, and shedding tears; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel too\r\ngood for England: I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights, like the\r\nother men of sacrifice, and then I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have b-b-been called a\r\nd-d-drunkard in such a way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you\xe2\x80\x99d show yourself a man of spirit, and not sit whining\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow myself a man of spirit?... Ah, well! let me take the name of\r\ndrunkard humbly\xe2\x80\x94let me be a man of contrite knees\xe2\x80\x94let it be! I know\r\nthat I always do say \xe2\x80\x98Please God\xe2\x80\x99 afore I do anything, from my getting\r\nup to my going down of the same, and I be willing to take as much\r\ndisgrace as there is in that holy act. Hah, yes!... But not a man of\r\nspirit? Have I ever allowed the toe of pride to be lifted against my\r\nhinder parts without groaning manfully that I question the right to do\r\nso? I inquire that query boldly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t say that you have, Hero Poorgrass,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Jan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever have I allowed such treatment to pass unquestioned! Yet the\r\nshepherd says in the face of that rich testimony that I be not a man of\r\nspirit! Well, let it pass by, and death is a kind friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel, seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to take\r\ncharge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey, made no reply,\r\nbut, closing the door again upon them, went across to where the vehicle\r\nstood, now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy\r\ntime. He pulled the horse\xe2\x80\x99s head from the large patch of turf it had\r\neaten bare, readjusted the boughs over the coffin, and drove along\r\nthrough the unwholesome night.\r\n\r\nIt had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be\r\nbrought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate\r\nFanny Robin who had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through\r\nMelchester and onwards. But, thanks to Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s reticence and Oak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerosity, the lover she had followed had never been individualized as\r\nTroy. Gabriel hoped that the whole truth of the matter might not be\r\npublished till at any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few\r\ndays, when the interposing barriers of earth and time, and a sense that\r\nthe events had been somewhat shut into oblivion, would deaden the sting\r\nthat revelation and invidious remark would have for Bathsheba just now.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Gabriel reached the old manor-house, her residence,\r\nwhich lay in his way to the church, it was quite dark. A man came from\r\nthe gate and said through the fog, which hung between them like blown\r\nflour\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that Poorgrass with the corpse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe corpse is here, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the\r\nreason of the delay. I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral to\r\nbe performed with proper decency. Have you the registrar\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncertificate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect Poorgrass has that; and he\xe2\x80\x99s at the\r\nBuck\xe2\x80\x99s Head. I forgot to ask him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen that settles the matter. We\xe2\x80\x99ll put off the funeral till to-morrow\r\nmorning. The body may be brought on to the church, or it may be left\r\nhere at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning. They waited\r\nmore than an hour, and have now gone home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable\r\nplan, notwithstanding that Fanny had been an inmate of the farm-house\r\nfor several years in the lifetime of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. Visions of\r\nseveral unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay flitted\r\nbefore him. But his will was not law, and he went indoors to inquire of\r\nhis mistress what were her wishes on the subject. He found her in an\r\nunusual mood: her eyes as she looked up to him were suspicious and\r\nperplexed as with some antecedent thought. Troy had not yet returned.\r\nAt first Bathsheba assented with a mien of indifference to his\r\nproposition that they should go on to the church at once with their\r\nburden; but immediately afterwards, following Gabriel to the gate, she\r\nswerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s account, and\r\ndesired that the girl might be brought into the house. Oak argued upon\r\nthe convenience of leaving her in the waggon, just as she lay now, with\r\nher flowers and green leaves about her, merely wheeling the vehicle\r\ninto the coach-house till the morning, but to no purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unkind\r\nand unchristian,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto leave the poor thing in a coach-house\r\nall night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the parson. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will arrange that the\r\nfuneral shall take place early to-morrow. Perhaps Mrs. Troy is right in\r\nfeeling that we cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too thoughtfully.\r\nWe must remember that though she may have erred grievously in leaving\r\nher home, she is still our sister: and it is to be believed that God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuncovenanted mercies are extended towards her, and that she is a member\r\nof the flock of Christ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe parson\xe2\x80\x99s words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet unperturbed\r\ncadence, and Gabriel shed an honest tear. Bathsheba seemed unmoved. Mr.\r\nThirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted a lantern. Fetching three\r\nother men to assist him, they bore the unconscious truant indoors,\r\nplacing the coffin on two benches in the middle of a little\r\nsitting-room next the hall, as Bathsheba directed.\r\n\r\nEvery one except Gabriel Oak then left the room. He still indecisively\r\nlingered beside the body. He was deeply troubled at the wretchedly\r\nironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with regard to\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and at his own powerlessness to counteract them. In spite\r\nof his careful man\xc5\x93uvering all this day, the very worst event that\r\ncould in any way have happened in connection with the burial had\r\nhappened now. Oak imagined a terrible discovery resulting from this\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x99s work that might cast over Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s life a shade which\r\nthe interposition of many lapsing years might but indifferently\r\nlighten, and which nothing at all might altogether remove.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from, at any rate,\r\nimmediate anguish, he looked again, as he had looked before, at the\r\nchalk writing upon the coffin-lid. The scrawl was this simple one,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fanny Robin and child_.\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully\r\nrubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible the inscription\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Fanny Robin_\xe2\x80\x9d only. He then left the room, and went out quietly by\r\nthe front door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\nFANNY\xe2\x80\x99S REVENGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me any longer ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Liddy, at a later hour the\r\nsame evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in her\r\nhand and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the large\r\nparlour beside the first fire of the season.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more to-night, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit up for master if you like, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. I am not at all afraid of\r\nFanny, if I may sit in my own room and have a candle. She was such a\r\nchildlike, nesh young thing that her spirit couldn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to anybody\r\nif it tried, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! You go to bed. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit up for him myself till twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and if he has not arrived by that time, I shall give him up\r\nand go to bed too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is half-past ten now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you sit upstairs, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, desultorily. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth\r\nwhile\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a fire here, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d She suddenly exclaimed in an\r\nimpulsive and excited whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard anything strange said of\r\nFanny?\xe2\x80\x9d The words had no sooner escaped her than an expression of\r\nunutterable regret crossed her face, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not a word!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, looking at the weeping woman with\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it makes you cry so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; has anything hurt\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d She came to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s side with a face full of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Liddy\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you any more. I can hardly say why I have taken\r\nto crying lately: I never used to cry. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy then left the parlour and closed the door.\r\n\r\nBathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than she\r\nhad been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that of\r\nthe present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a\r\ncave. And within the last day or two had come these disquieting\r\nthoughts about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s past. Her wayward sentiment that evening\r\nconcerning Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s temporary resting-place had been the result of a\r\nstrange complication of impulses in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s bosom. Perhaps it would\r\nbe more accurately described as a determined rebellion against her\r\nprejudices, a revulsion from a lower instinct of uncharitableness,\r\nwhich would have withheld all sympathy from the dead woman, because in\r\nlife she had preceded Bathsheba in the attentions of a man whom\r\nBathsheba had by no means ceased from loving, though her love was sick\r\nto death just now with the gravity of a further misgiving.\r\n\r\nIn five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door. Liddy\r\nreappeared, and coming in a little way stood hesitating, until at\r\nlength she said, \xe2\x80\x9cMaryann has just heard something very strange, but I\r\nknow it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true. And we shall be sure to know the rights of it in a\r\nday or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nothing connected with you or us, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. It is about Fanny. That\r\nsame thing you have heard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury within this last\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the\r\nremainder of the sentence slowly into her ear, inclining her head as\r\nshe spoke in the direction of the room where Fanny lay.\r\n\r\nBathsheba trembled from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s only one name\r\nwritten on the coffin-cover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. And a good many others don\xe2\x80\x99t; for we should surely have\r\nbeen told more about it if it had been true\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe might or we might not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that Liddy might not see her\r\nface. Finding that her mistress was going to say no more, Liddy glided\r\nout, closed the door softly, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s face, as she continued looking into the fire that evening,\r\nmight have excited solicitousness on her account even among those who\r\nloved her least. The sadness of Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s fate did not make\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s glorious, although she was the Esther to this poor Vashti,\r\nand their fates might be supposed to stand in some respects as\r\ncontrasts to each other. When Liddy came into the room a second time\r\nthe beautiful eyes which met hers had worn a listless, weary look. When\r\nshe went out after telling the story they had expressed wretchedness in\r\nfull activity. Her simple country nature, fed on old-fashioned\r\nprinciples, was troubled by that which would have troubled a woman of\r\nthe world very little, both Fanny and her child, if she had one, being\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own\r\nhistory and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s end which Oak and\r\nBoldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing. The meeting\r\nwith the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been\r\nunwitnessed and unspoken of. Oak may have had the best of intentions in\r\nwithholding for as many days as possible the details of what had\r\nhappened to Fanny; but had he known that Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions had\r\nalready been exercised in the matter, he would have done nothing to\r\nlengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing, when the\r\ncertainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than\r\nherself, and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with\r\ndignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism. Where could she find such\r\na friend? nowhere in the house. She was by far the coolest of the women\r\nunder her roof. Patience and suspension of judgement for a few hours\r\nwere what she wanted to learn, and there was nobody to teach her. Might\r\nshe but go to Gabriel Oak!\xe2\x80\x94but that could not be. What a way Oak had,\r\nshe thought, of enduring things. Boldwood, who seemed so much deeper\r\nand higher and stronger in feeling than Gabriel, had not yet learnt,\r\nany more than she herself, the simple lesson which Oak showed a mastery\r\nof by every turn and look he gave\xe2\x80\x94that among the multitude of interests\r\nby which he was surrounded, those which affected his personal\r\nwell-being were not the most absorbing and important in his eyes. Oak\r\nmeditatively looked upon the horizon of circumstances without any\r\nspecial regard to his own standpoint in the midst. That was how she\r\nwould wish to be. But then Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the\r\ninmost matter of his bosom, as she was at this moment. Oak knew all\r\nabout Fanny that he wished to know\xe2\x80\x94she felt convinced of that. If she\r\nwere to go to him now at once and say no more than these few words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the truth of the story?\xe2\x80\x9d he would feel bound in honour to tell\r\nher. It would be an inexpressible relief. No further speech would need\r\nto be uttered. He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in\r\nher would alarm him.\r\n\r\nShe flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it. Every\r\nblade, every twig was still. The air was yet thick with moisture,\r\nthough somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady\r\nsmack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost\r\nmusical in its soothing regularity. It seemed better to be out of the\r\nhouse than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked slowly\r\ndown the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, where he now\r\nlived alone, having left Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s house through being pinched for room.\r\nThere was a light in one window only, and that was downstairs. The\r\nshutters were not closed, nor was any blind or curtain drawn over the\r\nwindow, neither robbery nor observation being a contingency which could\r\ndo much injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes, it was Gabriel\r\nhimself who was sitting up: he was reading. From her standing-place in\r\nthe road she could see him plainly, sitting quite still, his light\r\ncurly head upon his hand, and only occasionally looking up to snuff the\r\ncandle which stood beside him. At length he looked at the clock, seemed\r\nsurprised at the lateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose. He\r\nwas going to bed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.\r\n\r\nAlas for her resolve! She felt she could not do it. Not for worlds now\r\ncould she give a hint about her misery to him, much less ask him\r\nplainly for information on the cause of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s death. She must\r\nsuspect, and guess, and chafe, and bear it all alone.\r\n\r\nLike a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank, as if lulled and\r\nfascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from\r\nthat little dwelling, and was so sadly lacking in her own. Gabriel\r\nappeared in an upper room, placed his light in the window-bench, and\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94knelt down to pray. The contrast of the picture with her\r\nrebellious and agitated existence at this same time was too much for\r\nher to bear to look upon longer. It was not for her to make a truce\r\nwith trouble by any such means. She must tread her giddy distracting\r\nmeasure to its last note, as she had begun it. With a swollen heart she\r\nwent again up the lane, and entered her own door.\r\n\r\nMore fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings which Oak\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexample had raised in her, she paused in the hall, looking at the door\r\nof the room wherein Fanny lay. She locked her fingers, threw back her\r\nhead, and strained her hot hands rigidly across her forehead, saying,\r\nwith a hysterical sob, \xe2\x80\x9cWould to God you would speak and tell me your\r\nsecret, Fanny!... Oh, I hope, hope it is not true that there are two of\r\nyou!... If I could only look in upon you for one little minute, I\r\nshould know all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few moments passed, and she added, slowly, \xe2\x80\x9c_And I will_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood which carried her\r\nthrough the actions following this murmured resolution on this\r\nmemorable evening of her life. She went to the lumber-closet for a\r\nscrew-driver. At the end of a short though undefined time she found\r\nherself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her\r\neyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her brain, standing beside the\r\nuncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely\r\nengrossed her, and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed\r\nwithin\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was best to know the worst, and I know it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series of\r\nactions done as by one in an extravagant dream; of following that idea\r\nas to method, which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring\r\nobviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs, assuring herself by\r\nlistening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep,\r\ngliding down again, turning the handle of the door within which the\r\nyoung girl lay, and deliberately setting herself to do what, if she had\r\nanticipated any such undertaking at night and alone, would have\r\nhorrified her, but which, when done, was not so dreadful as was the\r\nconclusive proof of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s conduct which came with knowing\r\nbeyond doubt the last chapter of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s story.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s head sank upon her bosom, and the breath which had been\r\nbated in suspense, curiosity, and interest, was exhaled now in the form\r\nof a whispered wail: \xe2\x80\x9cOh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and the silent room added\r\nlength to her moan.\r\n\r\nHer tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the coffin: tears of\r\na complicated origin, of a nature indescribable, almost indefinable\r\nexcept as other than those of simple sorrow. Assuredly their wonted\r\nfires must have lived in Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s ashes when events were so shaped as to\r\nchariot her hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet effectual manner.\r\nThe one feat alone\xe2\x80\x94that of dying\xe2\x80\x94by which a mean condition could be\r\nresolved into a grand one, Fanny had achieved. And to that had destiny\r\nsubjoined this reencounter to-night, which had, in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s wild\r\nimagining, turned her companion\xe2\x80\x99s failure to success, her humiliation\r\nto triumph, her lucklessness to ascendency; it had thrown over herself\r\na garish light of mockery, and set upon all things about her an\r\nironical smile.\r\n\r\nFanny\xe2\x80\x99s face was framed in by that yellow hair of hers; and there was\r\nno longer much room for doubt as to the origin of the curl owned by\r\nTroy. In Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s heated fancy the innocent white countenance\r\nexpressed a dim triumphant consciousness of the pain she was\r\nretaliating for her pain with all the merciless rigour of the Mosaic\r\nlaw: \xe2\x80\x9cBurning for burning; wound for wound: strife for strife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba indulged in contemplations of escape from her position by\r\nimmediate death, which, thought she, though it was an inconvenient and\r\nawful way, had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not\r\nbe overpassed; whilst the shames of life were measureless. Yet even\r\nthis scheme of extinction by death was but tamely copying her rival\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmethod without the reasons which had glorified it in her rival\xe2\x80\x99s case.\r\nShe glided rapidly up and down the room, as was mostly her habit when\r\nexcited, her hands hanging clasped in front of her, as she thought and\r\nin part expressed in broken words: \xe2\x80\x9cO, I hate her, yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nthat I hate her, for it is grievous and wicked; and yet I hate her a\r\nlittle! Yes, my flesh insists upon hating her, whether my spirit is\r\nwilling or no!... If she had only lived, I could have been angry and\r\ncruel towards her with some justification; but to be vindictive towards\r\na poor dead woman recoils upon myself. O God, have mercy! I am\r\nmiserable at all this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her own state of mind\r\nthat she looked around for some sort of refuge from herself. The vision\r\nof Oak kneeling down that night recurred to her, and with the imitative\r\ninstinct which animates women she seized upon the idea, resolved to\r\nkneel, and, if possible, pray. Gabriel had prayed; so would she.\r\n\r\nShe knelt beside the coffin, covered her face with her hands, and for a\r\ntime the room was silent as a tomb. Whether from a purely mechanical,\r\nor from any other cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted\r\nspirit, and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which had seized\r\nupon her just before.\r\n\r\nIn her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the\r\nwindow, and began laying them around the dead girl\xe2\x80\x99s head. Bathsheba\r\nknew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by\r\ngiving them flowers. She knew not how long she remained engaged thus.\r\nShe forgot time, life, where she was, what she was doing. A slamming\r\ntogether of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to herself\r\nagain. An instant after, the front door opened and closed, steps\r\ncrossed the hall, and her husband appeared at the entrance to the room,\r\nlooking in upon her.\r\n\r\nHe beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as if\r\nhe thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation.\r\nBathsheba, pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same\r\nwild way.\r\n\r\nSo little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction\r\nthat, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy never\r\nonce thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw. His first\r\nconfused idea was that somebody in the house had died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, blankly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go! I must go!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.\r\nShe came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name? who\xe2\x80\x99s dead?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say; let me go out. I want air!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no; stay, I insist!\xe2\x80\x9d He seized her hand, and then volition seemed\r\nto leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity. He, still\r\nholding her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and\r\nBathsheba approached the coffin\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nThe candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light\r\nslanted down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother\r\nand babe. Troy looked in, dropped his wife\xe2\x80\x99s hand, knowledge of it all\r\ncame over him in a lurid sheen, and he stood still.\r\n\r\nSo still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no\r\nmotive power whatever. The clashes of feeling in all directions\r\nconfounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion in\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from\r\nthe interior of a cell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had originally stood perfectly erect. And now, in the well-nigh\r\ncongealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient\r\nmovement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a while.\r\nHe was gradually sinking forwards. The lines of his features softened,\r\nand dismay modulated to illimitable sadness. Bathsheba was regarding\r\nhim from the other side, still with parted lips and distracted eyes.\r\nCapacity for intense feeling is proportionate to the general intensity\r\nof the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings, much greater\r\nrelatively to her strength, there never was a time she suffered in an\r\nabsolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.\r\n\r\nWhat Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of\r\nremorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,\r\ngently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid\r\nawakening it.\r\n\r\nAt the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable act, Bathsheba\r\nsprang towards him. All the strong feelings which had been scattered\r\nover her existence since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered\r\ntogether into one pulsation now. The revulsion from her indignant mood\r\na little earlier, when she had meditated upon compromised honour,\r\nforestalment, eclipse in maternity by another, was violent and entire.\r\nAll that was forgotten in the simple and still strong attachment of\r\nwife to husband. She had sighed for her self-completeness then, and now\r\nshe cried aloud against the severance of the union she had deplored.\r\nShe flung her arms round Troy\xe2\x80\x99s neck, exclaiming wildly from the\r\ndeepest deep of her heart\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t kiss them! O, Frank, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t! I love you\r\nbetter than she did: kiss me too, Frank\xe2\x80\x94kiss me! _You will, Frank, kiss\r\nme too!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain and\r\nsimplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s calibre and\r\nindependence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his\r\nneck, looked at her in bewilderment. It was such an unexpected\r\nrevelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different\r\nin their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy could\r\nhardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba. Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nspirit seemed to be animating her frame. But this was the mood of a few\r\ninstants only. When the momentary surprise had passed, his expression\r\nchanged to a silencing imperious gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not kiss you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said pushing her away.\r\n\r\nHad the wife now but gone no further. Yet, perhaps, under the harrowing\r\ncircumstances, to speak out was the one wrong act which can be better\r\nunderstood, if not forgiven in her, than the right and politic one, her\r\nrival being now but a corpse. All the feeling she had been betrayed\r\ninto showing she drew back to herself again by a strenuous effort of\r\nself-command.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say as your reason?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, her bitter voice\r\nbeing strangely low\xe2\x80\x94quite that of another woman now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to say that I have been a bad, black-hearted man,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that this woman is your victim; and I not less than she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! don\xe2\x80\x99t taunt me, madam. This woman is more to me, dead as she is,\r\nthan ever you were, or are, or can be. If Satan had not tempted me with\r\nthat face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have married\r\nher. I never had another thought till you came in my way. Would to God\r\nthat I had; but it is all too late!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Fanny then. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nnever mind, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cin the sight of Heaven you are my very,\r\nvery wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words there arose from Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s lips a long, low cry of\r\nmeasureless despair and indignation, such a wail of anguish as had\r\nnever before been heard within those old-inhabited walls. It was the\r\n\xce\xa4\xce\xb5\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb3\xce\xbb\xce\xb5\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xce\xb1\xce\xb9[*] of her union with Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that,\xe2\x80\x94what\xe2\x80\x94am I?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as a continuation of the same\r\ncry, and sobbing pitifully: and the rarity with her of such abandonment\r\nonly made the condition more dire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, heartlessly. \xe2\x80\x9cA ceremony\r\nbefore a priest doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a marriage. I am not morally yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from this place, hide, and\r\nescape his words at any price, not stopping short of death itself,\r\nmastered Bathsheba now. She waited not an instant, but turned to the\r\ndoor and ran out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\nUNDER A TREE\xe2\x80\x94REACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba went along the dark road, neither knowing nor caring about\r\nthe direction or issue of her flight. The first time that she\r\ndefinitely noticed her position was when she reached a gate leading\r\ninto a thicket overhung by some large oak and beech trees. On looking\r\ninto the place, it occurred to her that she had seen it by daylight on\r\nsome previous occasion, and that what appeared like an impassable\r\nthicket was in reality a brake of fern now withering fast. She could\r\nthink of nothing better to do with her palpitating self than to go in\r\nhere and hide; and entering, she lighted on a spot sheltered from the\r\ndamp fog by a reclining trunk, where she sank down upon a tangled couch\r\nof fronds and stems. She mechanically pulled some armfuls round her to\r\nkeep off the breezes, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nWhether she slept or not that night Bathsheba was not clearly aware.\r\nBut it was with a freshened existence and a cooler brain that, a long\r\ntime afterwards, she became conscious of some interesting proceedings\r\nwhich were going on in the trees above her head and around.\r\n\r\nA coarse-throated chatter was the first sound.\r\n\r\nIt was a sparrow just waking.\r\n\r\nNext: \xe2\x80\x9cChee-weeze-weeze-weeze!\xe2\x80\x9d from another retreat.\r\n\r\nIt was a finch.\r\n\r\nThird: \xe2\x80\x9cTink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink!\xe2\x80\x9d from the hedge.\r\n\r\nIt was a robin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChuck-chuck-chuck!\xe2\x80\x9d overhead.\r\n\r\nA squirrel.\r\n\r\nThen, from the road, \xe2\x80\x9cWith my ra-ta-ta, and my rum-tum-tum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a ploughboy. Presently he came opposite, and she believed from\r\nhis voice that he was one of the boys on her own farm. He was followed\r\nby a shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through the ferns\r\nBathsheba could just discern in the wan light of daybreak a team of her\r\nown horses. They stopped to drink at a pond on the other side of the\r\nway. She watched them flouncing into the pool, drinking, tossing up\r\ntheir heads, drinking again, the water dribbling from their lips in\r\nsilver threads. There was another flounce, and they came out of the\r\npond, and turned back again towards the farm.\r\n\r\nShe looked further around. Day was just dawning, and beside its cool\r\nair and colours her heated actions and resolves of the night stood out\r\nin lurid contrast. She perceived that in her lap, and clinging to her\r\nhair, were red and yellow leaves which had come down from the tree and\r\nsettled silently upon her during her partial sleep. Bathsheba shook her\r\ndress to get rid of them, when multitudes of the same family lying\r\nround about her rose and fluttered away in the breeze thus created,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clike ghosts from an enchanter fleeing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an opening towards the east, and the glow from the as yet\r\nunrisen sun attracted her eyes thither. From her feet, and between the\r\nbeautiful yellowing ferns with their feathery arms, the ground sloped\r\ndownwards to a hollow, in which was a species of swamp, dotted with\r\nfungi. A morning mist hung over it now\xe2\x80\x94a fulsome yet magnificent\r\nsilvery veil, full of light from the sun, yet semi-opaque\xe2\x80\x94the hedge\r\nbehind it being in some measure hidden by its hazy luminousness. Up the\r\nsides of this depression grew sheaves of the common rush, and here and\r\nthere a peculiar species of flag, the blades of which glistened in the\r\nemerging sun, like scythes. But the general aspect of the swamp was\r\nmalignant. From its moist and poisonous coat seemed to be exhaled the\r\nessences of evil things in the earth, and in the waters under the\r\nearth. The fungi grew in all manner of positions from rotting leaves\r\nand tree stumps, some exhibiting to her listless gaze their clammy\r\ntops, others their oozing gills. Some were marked with great splotches,\r\nred as arterial blood, others were saffron yellow, and others tall and\r\nattenuated, with stems like macaroni. Some were leathery and of richest\r\nbrowns. The hollow seemed a nursery of pestilences small and great, in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of comfort and health, and Bathsheba arose\r\nwith a tremor at the thought of having passed the night on the brink of\r\nso dismal a place.\r\n\r\nThere were now other footsteps to be heard along the road. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnerves were still unstrung: she crouched down out of sight again, and\r\nthe pedestrian came into view. He was a schoolboy, with a bag slung\r\nover his shoulder containing his dinner, and a book in his hand. He\r\npaused by the gate, and, without looking up, continued murmuring words\r\nin tones quite loud enough to reach her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord, O Lord\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x94that I know out o\xe2\x80\x99 book.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give us, give us, give us, give us, give us\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x94that I know. \xe2\x80\x98Grace\r\nthat, grace that, grace that, grace that\xe2\x80\x99:\xe2\x80\x94that I know.\xe2\x80\x9d Other words\r\nfollowed to the same effect. The boy was of the dunce class apparently;\r\nthe book was a psalter, and this was his way of learning the collect.\r\nIn the worst attacks of trouble there appears to be always a\r\nsuperficial film of consciousness which is left disengaged and open to\r\nthe notice of trifles, and Bathsheba was faintly amused at the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmethod, till he too passed on.\r\n\r\nBy this time stupor had given place to anxiety, and anxiety began to\r\nmake room for hunger and thirst. A form now appeared upon the rise on\r\nthe other side of the swamp, half-hidden by the mist, and came towards\r\nBathsheba. The woman\xe2\x80\x94for it was a woman\xe2\x80\x94approached with her face\r\naskance, as if looking earnestly on all sides of her. When she got a\r\nlittle further round to the left, and drew nearer, Bathsheba could see\r\nthe newcomer\xe2\x80\x99s profile against the sunny sky, and knew the wavy sweep\r\nfrom forehead to chin, with neither angle nor decisive line anywhere\r\nabout it, to be the familiar contour of Liddy Smallbury.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was\r\nnot altogether deserted, and she jumped up. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Liddy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, or\r\nattempted to say; but the words had only been framed by her lips; there\r\ncame no sound. She had lost her voice by exposure to the clogged\r\natmosphere all these hours of night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ma\xe2\x80\x99am! I am so glad I have found you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, as soon as\r\nshe saw Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t come across,\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba said in a whisper, which she vainly\r\nendeavoured to make loud enough to reach Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s ears. Liddy, not\r\nknowing this, stepped down upon the swamp, saying, as she did so, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwill bear me up, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of Liddy crossing\r\nthe swamp to her there in the morning light. Iridescent bubbles of dank\r\nsubterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside the\r\nwaiting-maid\xe2\x80\x99s feet as she trod, hissing as they burst and expanded\r\naway to join the vapoury firmament above. Liddy did not sink, as\r\nBathsheba had anticipated.\r\n\r\nShe landed safely on the other side, and looked up at the beautiful\r\nthough pale and weary face of her young mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, with tears in her eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cDo hearten yourself\r\nup a little, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. However did\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t speak above a whisper\xe2\x80\x94my voice is gone for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBathsheba, hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the damp air from that hollow has\r\ntaken it away. Liddy, don\xe2\x80\x99t question me, mind. Who sent you\xe2\x80\x94anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody. I thought, when I found you were not at home, that something\r\ncruel had happened. I fancy I heard his voice late last night; and so,\r\nknowing something was wrong\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he left just before I came out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Fanny taken away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. She will soon be\xe2\x80\x94at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t go home at present, then. Suppose we walk about in this\r\nwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy, without exactly understanding everything, or anything, in this\r\nepisode, assented, and they walked together further among the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you had better come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, and have something to eat. You will\r\ndie of a chill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not come indoors yet\xe2\x80\x94perhaps never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you something to eat, and something else to put over your\r\nhead besides that little shawl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you will, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLiddy vanished, and at the end of twenty minutes returned with a cloak,\r\nhat, some slices of bread and butter, a tea-cup, and some hot tea in a\r\nlittle china jug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Fanny gone?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said her companion, pouring out the tea.\r\n\r\nBathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank sparingly. Her voice was\r\nthen a little clearer, and trifling colour returned to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll walk about again,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThey wandered about the wood for nearly two hours, Bathsheba replying\r\nin monosyllables to Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s prattle, for her mind ran on one subject,\r\nand one only. She interrupted with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came back with the information that the men were just taking away\r\nthe corpse; that Bathsheba had been inquired for; that she had replied\r\nto the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen they think I am in my bedroom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Liddy then ventured to add: \xe2\x80\x9cYou said when I first found you\r\nthat you might never go home again\xe2\x80\x94you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99ve altered my mind. It is only women with no pride in them who\r\nrun away from their husbands. There is one position worse than that of\r\nbeing found dead in your husband\xe2\x80\x99s house from his ill usage, and that\r\nis, to be found alive through having gone away to the house of somebody\r\nelse. I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of it all this morning, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen my course. A\r\nrunaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody, a burden to herself and a\r\nbyword\xe2\x80\x94all of which make up a heap of misery greater than any that\r\ncomes by staying at home\xe2\x80\x94though this may include the trifling items of\r\ninsult, beating, and starvation. Liddy, if ever you marry\xe2\x80\x94God forbid\r\nthat you ever should!\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself in a fearful situation; but\r\nmind this, don\xe2\x80\x99t you flinch. Stand your ground, and be cut to pieces.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mistress, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, taking her hand; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I knew\r\nyou had too much sense to bide away. May I ask what dreadful thing it\r\nis that has happened between you and him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may ask; but I may not tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes they returned to the house by a circuitous route,\r\nentering at the rear. Bathsheba glided up the back stairs to a disused\r\nattic, and her companion followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a lighter heart, for youth and hope had begun\r\nto reassert themselves; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to be my confidante for the\r\npresent\xe2\x80\x94somebody must be\xe2\x80\x94and I choose you. Well, I shall take up my\r\nabode here for a while. Will you get a fire lighted, put down a piece\r\nof carpet, and help me to make the place comfortable. Afterwards, I\r\nwant you and Maryann to bring up that little stump bedstead in the\r\nsmall room, and the bed belonging to it, and a table, and some other\r\nthings.... What shall I do to pass the heavy time away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHemming handkerchiefs is a very good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, no! I hate needlework\xe2\x80\x94I always did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnitting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might finish your sampler. Only the carnations and peacocks want\r\nfilling in; and then it could be framed and glazed, and hung beside\r\nyour aunt\xe2\x80\x99s ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSamplers are out of date\xe2\x80\x94horribly countrified. No Liddy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll read.\r\nBring up some books\xe2\x80\x94not new ones. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heart to read anything\r\nnew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s old ones, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Some of those we stowed away in boxes.\xe2\x80\x9d A faint gleam of humour\r\npassed over her face as she said: \xe2\x80\x9cBring Beaumont and Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Maid\xe2\x80\x99s Tragedy_, and the _Mourning Bride_, and\xe2\x80\x94let me see\xe2\x80\x94_Night\r\nThoughts_, and the _Vanity of Human Wishes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that story of the black man, who murdered his wife Desdemona? It\r\nis a nice dismal one that would suit you excellent just now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Liddy, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking into my books without telling me; and\r\nI said you were not to! How do you know it would suit me? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsuit me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if the others do\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they don\xe2\x80\x99t; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t read dismal books. Why should I read\r\ndismal books, indeed? Bring me _Love in a Village_, and _Maid of the\r\nMill_, and _Doctor Syntax_, and some volumes of the _Spectator_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll that day Bathsheba and Liddy lived in the attic in a state of\r\nbarricade; a precaution which proved to be needless as against Troy,\r\nfor he did not appear in the neighbourhood or trouble them at all.\r\nBathsheba sat at the window till sunset, sometimes attempting to read,\r\nat other times watching every movement outside without much purpose,\r\nand listening without much interest to every sound.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down almost blood-red that night, and a livid cloud\r\nreceived its rays in the east. Up against this dark background the west\r\nfront of the church tower\xe2\x80\x94the only part of the edifice visible from the\r\nfarm-house windows\xe2\x80\x94rose distinct and lustrous, the vane upon the summit\r\nbristling with rays. Hereabouts, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the young men of the\r\nvillage gathered, as was their custom, for a game of Prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 base.\r\nThe spot had been consecrated to this ancient diversion from time\r\nimmemorial, the old stocks conveniently forming a base facing the\r\nboundary of the churchyard, in front of which the ground was trodden\r\nhard and bare as a pavement by the players. She could see the brown and\r\nblack heads of the young lads darting about right and left, their white\r\nshirt-sleeves gleaming in the sun; whilst occasionally a shout and a\r\npeal of hearty laughter varied the stillness of the evening air. They\r\ncontinued playing for a quarter of an hour or so, when the game\r\nconcluded abruptly, and the players leapt over the wall and vanished\r\nround to the other side behind a yew-tree, which was also half behind a\r\nbeech, now spreading in one mass of golden foliage, on which the\r\nbranches traced black lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did the base-players finish their game so suddenly?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba\r\ninquired, the next time that Liddy entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think \xe2\x80\x99twas because two men came just then from Casterbridge and\r\nbegan putting up a grand carved tombstone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lads went\r\nto see whose it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know?\xe2\x80\x9d Bathsheba asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\nTROY\xe2\x80\x99S ROMANTICISM\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Troy\xe2\x80\x99s wife had left the house at the previous midnight his first\r\nact was to cover the dead from sight. This done he ascended the stairs,\r\nand throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was, he waited\r\nmiserably for the morning.\r\n\r\nFate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-and-twenty hours.\r\nHis day had been spent in a way which varied very materially from his\r\nintentions regarding it. There is always an inertia to be overcome in\r\nstriking out a new line of conduct\xe2\x80\x94not more in ourselves, it seems,\r\nthan in circumscribing events, which appear as if leagued together to\r\nallow no novelties in the way of amelioration.\r\n\r\nTwenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba, he had managed to add\r\nto the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account, which had\r\nbeen seven pounds ten. With this money, twenty-seven pounds ten in all,\r\nhe had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his\r\nappointment with Fanny Robin.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn, and at\r\nfive minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end of the\r\ntown, and sat himself upon the parapet. The clocks struck the hour, and\r\nno Fanny appeared. In fact, at that moment she was being robed in her\r\ngrave-clothes by two attendants at the Union poorhouse\xe2\x80\x94the first and\r\nlast tiring-women the gentle creature had ever been honoured with. The\r\nquarter went, the half hour. A rush of recollection came upon Troy as\r\nhe waited: this was the second time she had broken a serious engagement\r\nwith him. In anger he vowed it should be the last, and at eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, when he had lingered and watched the stone of the bridge till\r\nhe knew every lichen upon their face and heard the chink of the ripples\r\nunderneath till they oppressed him, he jumped from his seat, went to\r\nthe inn for his gig, and in a bitter mood of indifference concerning\r\nthe past, and recklessness about the future, drove on to Budmouth\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nHe reached the race-course at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and remained either there or\r\nin the town till nine. But Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s image, as it had appeared to him in\r\nthe sombre shadows of that Saturday evening, returned to his mind,\r\nbacked up by Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s reproaches. He vowed he would not bet, and he\r\nkept his vow, for on leaving the town at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening he\r\nhad diminished his cash only to the extent of a few shillings.\r\n\r\nHe trotted slowly homeward, and it was now that he was struck for the\r\nfirst time with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by\r\nillness from keeping her promise. This time she could have made no\r\nmistake. He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge and made\r\ninquiries. Reaching home he quietly unharnessed the horse and came\r\nindoors, as we have seen, to the fearful shock that awaited him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects, Troy arose from\r\nthe coverlet of the bed, and in a mood of absolute indifference to\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, and almost oblivious of her existence, he\r\nstalked downstairs and left the house by the back door. His walk was\r\ntowards the churchyard, entering which he searched around till he found\r\na newly dug unoccupied grave\xe2\x80\x94the grave dug the day before for Fanny.\r\nThe position of this having been marked, he hastened on to\r\nCasterbridge, only pausing and musing for a while at the hill whereon\r\nhe had last seen Fanny alive.\r\n\r\nReaching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a pair\r\nof gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, \xe2\x80\x9cLester, stone and\r\nmarble mason.\xe2\x80\x9d Within were lying about stones of all sizes and designs,\r\ninscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons who had not\r\nyet died.\r\n\r\nTroy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and deed, that the want\r\nof likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness. His method\r\nof engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was that of\r\nan absolutely unpractised man. He could not bring himself to consider,\r\ncalculate, or economize. He waywardly wished for something, and he set\r\nabout obtaining it like a child in a nursery. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a good tomb,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to the man who stood in a little office within the yard. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\nas good a one as you can give me for twenty-seven pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all the money he possessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sum to include everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything. Cutting the name, carriage to Weatherbury, and erection.\r\nAnd I want it now, at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could not get anything special worked this week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like one of these in stock it could be got ready\r\nimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see what you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best I have in stock is this one,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stone-cutter, going\r\ninto a shed. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a marble headstone beautifully crocketed, with\r\nmedallions beneath of typical subjects; here\xe2\x80\x99s the footstone after the\r\nsame pattern, and here\xe2\x80\x99s the coping to enclose the grave. The polishing\r\nalone of the set cost me eleven pounds\xe2\x80\x94the slabs are the best of their\r\nkind, and I can warrant them to resist rain and frost for a hundred\r\nyears without flying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I could add the name, and put it up at Weatherbury for the sum\r\nyou mention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it done to-day, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the money now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man agreed, and wondered at such a mood in a visitor who wore not a\r\nshred of mourning. Troy then wrote the words which were to form the\r\ninscription, settled the account and went away. In the afternoon he\r\ncame back again, and found that the lettering was almost done. He\r\nwaited in the yard till the tomb was packed, and saw it placed in the\r\ncart and starting on its way to Weatherbury, giving directions to the\r\ntwo men who were to accompany it to inquire of the sexton for the grave\r\nof the person named in the inscription.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Troy came out of Casterbridge. He carried rather\r\na heavy basket upon his arm, with which he strode moodily along the\r\nroad, resting occasionally at bridges and gates, whereon he deposited\r\nhis burden for a time. Midway on his journey he met, returning in the\r\ndarkness, the men and the waggon which had conveyed the tomb. He merely\r\ninquired if the work was done, and, on being assured that it was,\r\npassed on again.\r\n\r\nTroy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock and went\r\nimmediately to the corner where he had marked the vacant grave early in\r\nthe morning. It was on the obscure side of the tower, screened to a\r\ngreat extent from the view of passers along the road\xe2\x80\x94a spot which until\r\nlately had been abandoned to heaps of stones and bushes of alder, but\r\nnow it was cleared and made orderly for interments, by reason of the\r\nrapid filling of the ground elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHere now stood the tomb as the men had stated, snow-white and shapely\r\nin the gloom, consisting of head and foot-stone, and enclosing border\r\nof marble-work uniting them. In the midst was mould, suitable for\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTroy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and vanished for a few\r\nminutes. When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern, the light\r\nof which he directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst he read\r\nthe inscription. He hung his lantern on the lowest bough of the\r\nyew-tree, and took from his basket flower-roots of several varieties.\r\nThere were bundles of snow-drop, hyacinth and crocus bulbs, violets and\r\ndouble daisies, which were to bloom in early spring, and of carnations,\r\npinks, picotees, lilies of the valley, forget-me-not, summer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarewell, meadow-saffron and others, for the later seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nTroy laid these out upon the grass, and with an impassive face set to\r\nwork to plant them. The snowdrops were arranged in a line on the\r\noutside of the coping, the remainder within the enclosure of the grave.\r\nThe crocuses and hyacinths were to grow in rows; some of the summer\r\nflowers he placed over her head and feet, the lilies and forget-me-nots\r\nover her heart. The remainder were dispersed in the spaces between\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nTroy, in his prostration at this time, had no perception that in the\r\nfutility of these romantic doings, dictated by a remorseful reaction\r\nfrom previous indifference, there was any element of absurdity.\r\nDeriving his idiosyncrasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed\r\nat such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the Englishman,\r\ntogether with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on\r\nmawkishness, characteristic of the French.\r\n\r\nIt was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and the rays from Troy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating power,\r\nflickering, as it seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud above. He\r\nfelt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and presently one\r\ncame and entered one of the holes of the lantern, whereupon the candle\r\nsputtered and went out. Troy was weary and it being now not far from\r\nmidnight, and the rain threatening to increase, he resolved to leave\r\nthe finishing touches of his labour until the day should break. He\r\ngroped along the wall and over the graves in the dark till he found\r\nhimself round at the north side. Here he entered the porch, and,\r\nreclining upon the bench within, fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\nTHE GURGOYLE: ITS DOINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tower of Weatherbury Church was a square erection of\r\nfourteenth-century date, having two stone gurgoyles on each of the four\r\nfaces of its parapet. Of these eight carved protuberances only two at\r\nthis time continued to serve the purpose of their erection\xe2\x80\x94that of\r\nspouting the water from the lead roof within. One mouth in each front\r\nhad been closed by bygone church-wardens as superfluous, and two others\r\nwere broken away and choked\xe2\x80\x94a matter not of much consequence to the\r\nwellbeing of the tower, for the two mouths which still remained open\r\nand active were gaping enough to do all the work.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes argued that there is no truer criterion of the\r\nvitality of any given art-period than the power of the master-spirits\r\nof that time in grotesque; and certainly in the instance of Gothic art\r\nthere is no disputing the proposition. Weatherbury tower was a somewhat\r\nearly instance of the use of an ornamental parapet in parish as\r\ndistinct from cathedral churches, and the gurgoyles, which are the\r\nnecessary correlatives of a parapet, were exceptionally prominent\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nthe boldest cut that the hand could shape, and of the most original\r\ndesign that a human brain could conceive. There was, so to speak, that\r\nsymmetry in their distortion which is less the characteristic of\r\nBritish than of Continental grotesques of the period. All the eight\r\nwere different from each other. A beholder was convinced that nothing\r\non earth could be more hideous than those he saw on the north side\r\nuntil he went round to the south. Of the two on this latter face, only\r\nthat at the south-eastern corner concerns the story. It was too human\r\nto be called like a dragon, too impish to be like a man, too animal to\r\nbe like a fiend, and not enough like a bird to be called a griffin.\r\nThis horrible stone entity was fashioned as if covered with a wrinkled\r\nhide; it had short, erect ears, eyes starting from their sockets, and\r\nits fingers and hands were seizing the corners of its mouth, which they\r\nthus seemed to pull open to give free passage to the water it vomited.\r\nThe lower row of teeth was quite washed away, though the upper still\r\nremained. Here and thus, jutting a couple of feet from the wall against\r\nwhich its feet rested as a support, the creature had for four hundred\r\nyears laughed at the surrounding landscape, voicelessly in dry weather,\r\nand in wet with a gurgling and snorting sound.\r\n\r\nTroy slept on in the porch, and the rain increased outside. Presently\r\nthe gurgoyle spat. In due time a small stream began to trickle through\r\nthe seventy feet of aerial space between its mouth and the ground,\r\nwhich the water-drops smote like duckshot in their accelerated\r\nvelocity. The stream thickened in substance, and increased in power,\r\ngradually spouting further and yet further from the side of the tower.\r\nWhen the rain fell in a steady and ceaseless torrent the stream dashed\r\ndownward in volumes.\r\n\r\nWe follow its course to the ground at this point of time. The end of\r\nthe liquid parabola has come forward from the wall, has advanced over\r\nthe plinth mouldings, over a heap of stones, over the marble border,\r\ninto the midst of Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s grave.\r\n\r\nThe force of the stream had, until very lately, been received upon some\r\nloose stones spread thereabout, which had acted as a shield to the soil\r\nunder the onset. These during the summer had been cleared from the\r\nground, and there was now nothing to resist the down-fall but the bare\r\nearth. For several years the stream had not spouted so far from the\r\ntower as it was doing on this night, and such a contingency had been\r\nover-looked. Sometimes this obscure corner received no inhabitant for\r\nthe space of two or three years, and then it was usually but a pauper,\r\na poacher, or other sinner of undignified sins.\r\n\r\nThe persistent torrent from the gurgoyle\xe2\x80\x99s jaws directed all its\r\nvengeance into the grave. The rich tawny mould was stirred into motion,\r\nand boiled like chocolate. The water accumulated and washed deeper\r\ndown, and the roar of the pool thus formed spread into the night as the\r\nhead and chief among other noises of the kind created by the deluging\r\nrain. The flowers so carefully planted by Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s repentant lover began\r\nto move and writhe in their bed. The winter-violets turned slowly\r\nupside down, and became a mere mat of mud. Soon the snowdrop and other\r\nbulbs danced in the boiling mass like ingredients in a cauldron. Plants\r\nof the tufted species were loosened, rose to the surface, and floated\r\noff.\r\n\r\nTroy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day.\r\nNot having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff, his\r\nfeet tender, and his head heavy. He remembered his position, arose,\r\nshivered, took the spade, and again went out.\r\n\r\nThe rain had quite ceased, and the sun was shining through the green,\r\nbrown, and yellow leaves, now sparkling and varnished by the raindrops\r\nto the brightness of similar effects in the landscapes of Ruysdael and\r\nHobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that arise from the\r\nunion of water and colour with high lights. The air was rendered so\r\ntransparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn hues of the\r\nmiddle distance were as rich as those near at hand, and the remote\r\nfields intercepted by the angle of the tower appeared in the same plane\r\nas the tower itself.\r\n\r\nHe entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower. The\r\npath, instead of being stony as it had been the night before, was\r\nbrowned over with a thin coating of mud. At one place in the path he\r\nsaw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle of\r\ntendons. He picked it up\xe2\x80\x94surely it could not be one of the primroses he\r\nhad planted? He saw a bulb, another, and another as he advanced. Beyond\r\ndoubt they were the crocuses. With a face of perplexed dismay Troy\r\nturned the corner and then beheld the wreck the stream had made.\r\n\r\nThe pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground, and in its\r\nplace was a hollow. The disturbed earth was washed over the grass and\r\npathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and it\r\nspotted the marble tombstone with the same stains. Nearly all the\r\nflowers were washed clean out of the ground, and they lay, roots\r\nupwards, on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream.\r\n\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s brow became heavily contracted. He set his teeth closely, and\r\nhis compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain. This singular\r\naccident, by a strange confluence of emotions in him, was felt as the\r\nsharpest sting of all. Troy\xe2\x80\x99s face was very expressive, and any\r\nobserver who had seen him now would hardly have believed him to be a\r\nman who had laughed, and sung, and poured love-trifles into a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near. To curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse, but even that\r\nlowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose absence was\r\nnecessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid misery which\r\nwrung him. The sight, coming as it did, superimposed upon the other\r\ndark scenery of the previous days, formed a sort of climax to the whole\r\npanorama, and it was more than he could endure. Sanguine by nature,\r\nTroy had a power of eluding grief by simply adjourning it. He could put\r\noff the consideration of any particular spectre till the matter had\r\nbecome old and softened by time. The planting of flowers on Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave had been perhaps but a species of elusion of the primary grief,\r\nand now it was as if his intention had been known and circumvented.\r\n\r\nAlmost for the first time in his life, Troy, as he stood by this\r\ndismantled grave, wished himself another man. It is seldom that a\r\nperson with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his life\r\nbeing his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a more\r\nhopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him in every\r\nparticular. Troy had felt, in his transient way, hundreds of times,\r\nthat he could not envy other people their condition, because the\r\npossession of that condition would have necessitated a different\r\npersonality, when he desired no other than his own. He had not minded\r\nthe peculiarities of his birth, the vicissitudes of his life, the\r\nmeteor-like uncertainty of all that related to him, because these\r\nappertained to the hero of his story, without whom there would have\r\nbeen no story at all for him; and it seemed to be only in the nature of\r\nthings that matters would right themselves at some proper date and wind\r\nup well. This very morning the illusion completed its disappearance,\r\nand, as it were, all of a sudden, Troy hated himself. The suddenness\r\nwas probably more apparent than real. A coral reef which just comes\r\nshort of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon than if it had\r\nnever been begun, and the mere finishing stroke is what often appears\r\nto create an event which has long been potentially an accomplished\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nHe stood and meditated\xe2\x80\x94a miserable man. Whither should he go? \xe2\x80\x9cHe that\r\nis accursed, let him be accursed still,\xe2\x80\x9d was the pitiless anathema\r\nwritten in this spoliated effort of his new-born solicitousness. A man\r\nwho has spent his primal strength in journeying in one direction has\r\nnot much spirit left for reversing his course. Troy had, since\r\nyesterday, faintly reversed his; but the merest opposition had\r\ndisheartened him. To turn about would have been hard enough under the\r\ngreatest providential encouragement; but to find that Providence, far\r\nfrom helping him into a new course, or showing any wish that he might\r\nadopt one, actually jeered his first trembling and critical attempt in\r\nthat kind, was more than nature could bear.\r\n\r\nHe slowly withdrew from the grave. He did not attempt to fill up the\r\nhole, replace the flowers, or do anything at all. He simply threw up\r\nhis cards and forswore his game for that time and always. Going out of\r\nthe churchyard silently and unobserved\xe2\x80\x94none of the villagers having yet\r\nrisen\xe2\x80\x94he passed down some fields at the back, and emerged just as\r\nsecretly upon the high road. Shortly afterwards he had gone from the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic. The\r\ndoor was kept locked, except during the entries and exits of Liddy, for\r\nwhom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room. The light of\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock by the\r\nmaid-servant, who casually glanced from the window in that direction\r\nwhilst taking her supper, and she called Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s attention to it.\r\nThey looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time, until Liddy was\r\nsent to bed.\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night. When her attendant was\r\nunconscious and softly breathing in the next room, the mistress of the\r\nhouse was still looking out of the window at the faint gleam spreading\r\nfrom among the trees\xe2\x80\x94not in a steady shine, but blinking like a\r\nrevolving coast-light, though this appearance failed to suggest to her\r\nthat a person was passing and repassing in front of it. Bathsheba sat\r\nhere till it began to rain, and the light vanished, when she withdrew\r\nto lie restlessly in her bed and re-enact in a worn mind the lurid\r\nscene of yesternight.\r\n\r\nAlmost before the first faint sign of dawn appeared she arose again,\r\nand opened the window to obtain a full breathing of the new morning\r\nair, the panes being now wet with trembling tears left by the night\r\nrain, each one rounded with a pale lustre caught from primrose-hued\r\nslashes through a cloud low down in the awakening sky. From the trees\r\ncame the sound of steady dripping upon the drifted leaves under them,\r\nand from the direction of the church she could hear another\r\nnoise\xe2\x80\x94peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl of water\r\nfalling into a pool.\r\n\r\nLiddy knocked at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and Bathsheba unlocked the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a heavy rain we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, when her\r\ninquiries about breakfast had been made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, very heavy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear the strange noise from the churchyard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard one strange noise. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking it must have been the\r\nwater from the tower spouts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the shepherd was saying, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He\xe2\x80\x99s now gone on to\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Gabriel has been here this morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly just looked in in passing\xe2\x80\x94quite in his old way, which I thought\r\nhe had left off lately. But the tower spouts used to spatter on the\r\nstones, and we are puzzled, for this was like the boiling of a pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay\r\nand breakfast with her. The tongue of the more childish woman still ran\r\nupon recent events. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you going across to the church, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might like to go and see where they have put Fanny. The\r\ntrees hide the place from your window.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cHas Mr.\r\nTroy been in to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I think he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Budmouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBudmouth! The sound of the word carried with it a much diminished\r\nperspective of him and his deeds; there were thirteen miles interval\r\nbetwixt them now. She hated questioning Liddy about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements, and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided doing so; but now\r\nall the house knew that there had been some dreadful disagreement\r\nbetween them, and it was futile to attempt disguise. Bathsheba had\r\nreached a stage at which people cease to have any appreciative regard\r\nfor public opinion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think he has gone there?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaban Tall saw him on the Budmouth road this morning before\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba was momentarily relieved of that wayward heaviness of the\r\npast twenty-four hours which had quenched the vitality of youth in her\r\nwithout substituting the philosophy of maturer years, and she resolved\r\nto go out and walk a little way. So when breakfast was over, she put on\r\nher bonnet, and took a direction towards the church. It was nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and the men having returned to work again from their first\r\nmeal, she was not likely to meet many of them in the road. Knowing that\r\nFanny had been laid in the reprobates\xe2\x80\x99 quarter of the graveyard, called\r\nin the parish \xe2\x80\x9cbehind church,\xe2\x80\x9d which was invisible from the road, it\r\nwas impossible to resist the impulse to enter and look upon a spot\r\nwhich, from nameless feelings, she at the same time dreaded to see. She\r\nhad been unable to overcome an impression that some connection existed\r\nbetween her rival and the light through the trees.\r\n\r\nBathsheba skirted the buttress, and beheld the hole and the tomb, its\r\ndelicately veined surface splashed and stained just as Troy had seen it\r\nand left it two hours earlier. On the other side of the scene stood\r\nGabriel. His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her arrival having\r\nbeen noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his attention. Bathsheba\r\ndid not at once perceive that the grand tomb and the disturbed grave\r\nwere Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s, and she looked on both sides and around for some humbler\r\nmound, earthed up and clodded in the usual way. Then her eye followed\r\nOak\xe2\x80\x99s, and she read the words with which the inscription opened:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nErected by Francis Troy\r\nIn Beloved Memory of\r\nFanny Robin\r\n\r\n\r\nOak saw her, and his first act was to gaze inquiringly and learn how\r\nshe received this knowledge of the authorship of the work, which to\r\nhimself had caused considerable astonishment. But such discoveries did\r\nnot much affect her now. Emotional convulsions seemed to have become\r\nthe commonplaces of her history, and she bade him good morning, and\r\nasked him to fill in the hole with the spade which was standing by.\r\nWhilst Oak was doing as she desired, Bathsheba collected the flowers,\r\nand began planting them with that sympathetic manipulation of roots and\r\nleaves which is so conspicuous in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s gardening, and which\r\nflowers seem to understand and thrive upon. She requested Oak to get\r\nthe churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the mouth of the gurgoyle\r\nthat hung gaping down upon them, that by this means the stream might be\r\ndirected sideways, and a repetition of the accident prevented. Finally,\r\nwith the superfluous magnanimity of a woman whose narrower instincts\r\nhave brought down bitterness upon her instead of love, she wiped the\r\nmud spots from the tomb as if she rather liked its words than\r\notherwise, and went again home.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\nADVENTURES BY THE SHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nTroy wandered along towards the south. A composite feeling, made up of\r\ndisgust with the, to him, humdrum tediousness of a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\ngloomy images of her who lay in the churchyard, remorse, and a general\r\naverseness to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s society, impelled him to seek a home in any\r\nplace on earth save Weatherbury. The sad accessories of Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s end\r\nconfronted him as vivid pictures which threatened to be indelible, and\r\nmade life in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s house intolerable. At three in the afternoon\r\nhe found himself at the foot of a slope more than a mile in length,\r\nwhich ran to the ridge of a range of hills lying parallel with the\r\nshore, and forming a monotonous barrier between the basin of cultivated\r\ncountry inland and the wilder scenery of the coast. Up the hill\r\nstretched a road nearly straight and perfectly white, the two sides\r\napproaching each other in a gradual taper till they met the sky at the\r\ntop about two miles off. Throughout the length of this narrow and\r\nirksome inclined plane not a sign of life was visible on this garish\r\nafternoon. Troy toiled up the road with a languor and depression\r\ngreater than any he had experienced for many a day and year before. The\r\nair was warm and muggy, and the top seemed to recede as he approached.\r\n\r\nAt last he reached the summit, and a wide and novel prospect burst upon\r\nhim with an effect almost like that of the Pacific upon Balboa\xe2\x80\x99s gaze.\r\nThe broad steely sea, marked only by faint lines, which had a semblance\r\nof being etched thereon to a degree not deep enough to disturb its\r\ngeneral evenness, stretched the whole width of his front and round to\r\nthe right, where, near the town and port of Budmouth, the sun bristled\r\ndown upon it, and banished all colour, to substitute in its place a\r\nclear oily polish. Nothing moved in sky, land, or sea, except a frill\r\nof milkwhite foam along the nearer angles of the shore, shreds of which\r\nlicked the contiguous stones like tongues.\r\n\r\nHe descended and came to a small basin of sea enclosed by the cliffs.\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s nature freshened within him; he thought he would rest and bathe\r\nhere before going farther. He undressed and plunged in. Inside the cove\r\nthe water was uninteresting to a swimmer, being smooth as a pond, and\r\nto get a little of the ocean swell, Troy presently swam between the two\r\nprojecting spurs of rock which formed the pillars of Hercules to this\r\nminiature Mediterranean. Unfortunately for Troy a current unknown to\r\nhim existed outside, which, unimportant to craft of any burden, was\r\nawkward for a swimmer who might be taken in it unawares. Troy found\r\nhimself carried to the left and then round in a swoop out to sea.\r\n\r\nHe now recollected the place and its sinister character. Many bathers\r\nhad there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like Gonzalo\r\nalso, had been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible that he\r\nmight be added to their number. Not a boat of any kind was at present\r\nwithin sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon the sea, as it\r\nwere quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the town the harbour\r\nshowed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and spars. After\r\nwell-nigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to the mouth of\r\nthe cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper than was his\r\nwont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils, turning upon\r\nhis back a dozen times over, swimming _en papillon_, and so on, Troy\r\nresolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight incline, and so\r\nendeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely giving himself a\r\ngentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the general direction of\r\nthe tide. This, necessarily a slow process, he found to be not\r\naltogether so difficult, and though there was no choice of a\r\nlanding-place\xe2\x80\x94the objects on shore passing by him in a sad and slow\r\nprocession\xe2\x80\x94he perceptibly approached the extremity of a spit of land\r\nyet further to the right, now well defined against the sunny portion of\r\nthe horizon. While the swimmer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were fixed upon the spit as his\r\nonly means of salvation on this side of the Unknown, a moving object\r\nbroke the outline of the extremity, and immediately a ship\xe2\x80\x99s boat\r\nappeared manned with several sailor lads, her bows towards the sea.\r\n\r\nAll Troy\xe2\x80\x99s vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a\r\nlittle further. Swimming with his right arm, he held up his left to\r\nhail them, splashing upon the waves, and shouting with all his might.\r\nFrom the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly\r\nvisible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the sea to the east of the\r\nboat, and the men saw him at once. Backing their oars and putting the\r\nboat about, they pulled towards him with a will, and in five or six\r\nminutes from the time of his first halloo, two of the sailors hauled\r\nhim in over the stern.\r\n\r\nThey formed part of a brig\xe2\x80\x99s crew, and had come ashore for sand.\r\nLending him what little clothing they could spare among them as a\r\nslight protection against the rapidly cooling air, they agreed to land\r\nhim in the morning; and without further delay, for it was growing late,\r\nthey made again towards the roadstead where their vessel lay.\r\n\r\nAnd now night drooped slowly upon the wide watery levels in front; and\r\nat no great distance from them, where the shoreline curved round, and\r\nformed a long riband of shade upon the horizon, a series of points of\r\nyellow light began to start into existence, denoting the spot to be the\r\nsite of Budmouth, where the lamps were being lighted along the parade.\r\nThe cluck of their oars was the only sound of any distinctness upon the\r\nsea, and as they laboured amid the thickening shades the lamp-lights\r\ngrew larger, each appearing to send a flaming sword deep down into the\r\nwaves before it, until there arose, among other dim shapes of the kind,\r\nthe form of the vessel for which they were bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\nDOUBTS ARISE\xe2\x80\x94DOUBTS LINGER\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba underwent the enlargement of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s absence from hours\r\nto days with a slight feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling of\r\nrelief; yet neither sensation rose at any time far above the level\r\ncommonly designated as indifference. She belonged to him: the\r\ncertainties of that position were so well defined, and the reasonable\r\nprobabilities of its issue so bounded that she could not speculate on\r\ncontingencies. Taking no further interest in herself as a splendid\r\nwoman, she acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in\r\ncontemplating her probable fate as a singular wretch; for Bathsheba\r\ndrew herself and her future in colours that no reality could exceed for\r\ndarkness. Her original vigorous pride of youth had sickened, and with\r\nit had declined all her anxieties about coming years, since anxiety\r\nrecognizes a better and a worse alternative, and Bathsheba had made up\r\nher mind that alternatives on any noteworthy scale had ceased for her.\r\nSoon, or later\xe2\x80\x94and that not very late\xe2\x80\x94her husband would be home again.\r\nAnd then the days of their tenancy of the Upper Farm would be numbered.\r\nThere had originally been shown by the agent to the estate some\r\ndistrust of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as James Everdene\xe2\x80\x99s successor, on the\r\nscore of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty; but the peculiar\r\nnature of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s will, his own frequent testimony before his death\r\nto her cleverness in such a pursuit, and her vigorous marshalling of\r\nthe numerous flocks and herds which came suddenly into her hands before\r\nnegotiations were concluded, had won confidence in her powers, and no\r\nfurther objections had been raised. She had latterly been in great\r\ndoubt as to what the legal effects of her marriage would be upon her\r\nposition; but no notice had been taken as yet of her change of name,\r\nand only one point was clear\xe2\x80\x94that in the event of her own or her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s inability to meet the agent at the forthcoming January\r\nrent-day, very little consideration would be shown, and, for that\r\nmatter, very little would be deserved. Once out of the farm, the\r\napproach of poverty would be sure.\r\n\r\nHence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her purposes were broken\r\noff. She was not a woman who could hope on without good materials for\r\nthe process, differing thus from the less far-sighted and energetic,\r\nthough more petted ones of the sex, with whom hope goes on as a sort of\r\nclockwork which the merest food and shelter are sufficient to wind up;\r\nand perceiving clearly that her mistake had been a fatal one, she\r\naccepted her position, and waited coldly for the end.\r\n\r\nThe first Saturday after Troy\xe2\x80\x99s departure she went to Casterbridge\r\nalone, a journey she had not before taken since her marriage. On this\r\nSaturday Bathsheba was passing slowly on foot through the crowd of\r\nrural business-men gathered as usual in front of the market-house, who\r\nwere as usual gazed upon by the burghers with feelings that those\r\nhealthy lives were dearly paid for by exclusion from possible\r\naldermanship, when a man, who had apparently been following her, said\r\nsome words to another on her left hand. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s ears were keen as\r\nthose of any wild animal, and she distinctly heard what the speaker\r\nsaid, though her back was towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am looking for Mrs. Troy. Is that she there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s the young lady, I believe,\xe2\x80\x9d said the the person addressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some awkward news to break to her. Her husband is drowned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba gasped out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nit is not true; it cannot be true!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she said and heard no more.\r\nThe ice of self-command which had latterly gathered over her was\r\nbroken, and the currents burst forth again, and overwhelmed her. A\r\ndarkness came into her eyes, and she fell.\r\n\r\nBut not to the ground. A gloomy man, who had been observing her from\r\nunder the portico of the old corn-exchange when she passed through the\r\ngroup without, stepped quickly to her side at the moment of her\r\nexclamation, and caught her in his arms as she sank down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, looking up at the bringer of the big news,\r\nas he supported her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer husband was drowned this week while bathing in Lulwind Cove. A\r\ncoastguardsman found his clothes, and brought them into Budmouth\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon a strange fire lighted up Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and his face\r\nflushed with the suppressed excitement of an unutterable thought.\r\nEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s glance was now centred upon him and the unconscious\r\nBathsheba. He lifted her bodily off the ground, and smoothed down the\r\nfolds of her dress as a child might have taken a storm-beaten bird and\r\narranged its ruffled plumes, and bore her along the pavement to the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s Arms Inn. Here he passed with her under the archway into a\r\nprivate room; and by the time he had deposited\xe2\x80\x94so lothly\xe2\x80\x94the precious\r\nburden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had opened her eyes. Remembering all that\r\nhad occurred, she murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood left the room. He stood for a moment in the passage to recover\r\nhis senses. The experience had been too much for his consciousness to\r\nkeep up with, and now that he had grasped it it had gone again. For\r\nthose few heavenly, golden moments she had been in his arms. What did\r\nit matter about her not knowing it? She had been close to his breast;\r\nhe had been close to hers.\r\n\r\nHe started onward again, and sending a woman to her, went out to\r\nascertain all the facts of the case. These appeared to be limited to\r\nwhat he had already heard. He then ordered her horse to be put into the\r\ngig, and when all was ready returned to inform her. He found that,\r\nthough still pale and unwell, she had in the meantime sent for the\r\nBudmouth man who brought the tidings, and learnt from him all there was\r\nto know.\r\n\r\nBeing hardly in a condition to drive home as she had driven to town,\r\nBoldwood, with every delicacy of manner and feeling, offered to get her\r\na driver, or to give her a seat in his phaeton, which was more\r\ncomfortable than her own conveyance. These proposals Bathsheba gently\r\ndeclined, and the farmer at once departed.\r\n\r\nAbout half-an-hour later she invigorated herself by an effort, and took\r\nher seat and the reins as usual\xe2\x80\x94in external appearance much as if\r\nnothing had happened. She went out of the town by a tortuous back\r\nstreet, and drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the scene.\r\nThe first shades of evening were showing themselves when Bathsheba\r\nreached home, where, silently alighting and leaving the horse in the\r\nhands of the boy, she proceeded at once upstairs. Liddy met her on the\r\nlanding. The news had preceded Bathsheba to Weatherbury by\r\nhalf-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\nBathsheba had nothing to say.\r\n\r\nShe entered her bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and thought\r\ntill night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her shape were\r\nvisible. Somebody came to the door, knocked, and opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it, Liddy?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking there must be something got for you to wear,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLiddy, with hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMourning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose there must be something done for poor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at present, I think. It is not necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know it. But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been different, or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nhave heard more, or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have found him, Liddy?\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how it is, but death would have been different from how this is. I\r\nam perfectly convinced that he is still alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday, when two\r\ncircumstances conjoined to shake it. The first was a short paragraph in\r\nthe local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing pen\r\nformidable presumptive evidence of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s death by drowning, contained\r\nthe important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of Budmouth, who\r\nspoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, in a letter to the\r\neditor. In this he stated that he was passing over the cliff on the\r\nremoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting. At that time he\r\nsaw a bather carried along in the current outside the mouth of the\r\ncove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a poor chance for\r\nhim unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular powers. He\r\ndrifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker followed along\r\nthe shore in the same direction. But by the time that he could reach an\r\nelevation sufficiently great to command a view of the sea beyond, dusk\r\nhad set in, and nothing further was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes, when it became\r\nnecessary for her to examine and identify them\xe2\x80\x94though this had\r\nvirtually been done long before by those who inspected the letters in\r\nhis pockets. It was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation\r\nthat Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing again almost\r\nimmediately, that the notion that anything but death could have\r\nprevented him was a perverse one to entertain.\r\n\r\nThen Bathsheba said to herself that others were assured in their\r\nopinion; strange that she should not be. A strange reflection occurred\r\nto her, causing her face to flush. Suppose that Troy had followed Fanny\r\ninto another world. Had he done this intentionally, yet contrived to\r\nmake his death appear like an accident? Nevertheless, this thought of\r\nhow the apparent might differ from the real\xe2\x80\x94made vivid by her bygone\r\njealousy of Fanny, and the remorse he had shown that night\xe2\x80\x94did not\r\nblind her to the perception of a likelier difference, less tragic, but\r\nto herself far more disastrous.\r\n\r\nWhen alone late that evening beside a small fire, and much calmed down,\r\nBathsheba took Troy\xe2\x80\x99s watch into her hand, which had been restored to\r\nher with the rest of the articles belonging to him. She opened the case\r\nas he had opened it before her a week ago. There was the little coil of\r\npale hair which had been as the fuze to this great explosion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was hers and she was his; they should be gone together,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am nothing to either of them, and why should I keep her hair?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ntook it in her hand, and held it over the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll not burn\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it in memory of her, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d she added, snatching\r\nback her hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\nOAK\xe2\x80\x99S ADVANCEMENT\xe2\x80\x94A GREAT HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later autumn and the winter drew on apace, and the leaves lay thick\r\nupon the turf of the glades and the mosses of the woods. Bathsheba,\r\nhaving previously been living in a state of suspended feeling which was\r\nnot suspense, now lived in a mood of quietude which was not precisely\r\npeacefulness. While she had known him to be alive she could have\r\nthought of his death with equanimity; but now that it might be she had\r\nlost him, she regretted that he was not hers still. She kept the farm\r\ngoing, raked in her profits without caring keenly about them, and\r\nexpended money on ventures because she had done so in bygone days,\r\nwhich, though not long gone by, seemed infinitely removed from her\r\npresent. She looked back upon that past over a great gulf, as if she\r\nwere now a dead person, having the faculty of meditation still left in\r\nher, by means of which, like the mouldering gentlefolk of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstory, she could sit and ponder what a gift life used to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, one excellent result of her general apathy was the\r\nlong-delayed installation of Oak as bailiff; but he having virtually\r\nexercised that function for a long time already, the change, beyond the\r\nsubstantial increase of wages it brought, was little more than a\r\nnominal one addressed to the outside world.\r\n\r\nBoldwood lived secluded and inactive. Much of his wheat and all his\r\nbarley of that season had been spoilt by the rain. It sprouted, grew\r\ninto intricate mats, and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in armfuls.\r\nThe strange neglect which had produced this ruin and waste became the\r\nsubject of whispered talk among all the people round; and it was\r\nelicited from one of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s men that forgetfulness had nothing to\r\ndo with it, for he had been reminded of the danger to his corn as many\r\ntimes and as persistently as inferiors dared to do. The sight of the\r\npigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed to arouse Boldwood,\r\nand he one evening sent for Oak. Whether it was suggested by\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s recent act of promotion or not, the farmer proposed at the\r\ninterview that Gabriel should undertake the superintendence of the\r\nLower Farm as well as of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s, because of the necessity Boldwood\r\nfelt for such aid, and the impossibility of discovering a more\r\ntrustworthy man. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s malignant star was assuredly setting fast.\r\n\r\nBathsheba, when she learnt of this proposal\xe2\x80\x94for Oak was obliged to\r\nconsult her\xe2\x80\x94at first languidly objected. She considered that the two\r\nfarms together were too extensive for the observation of one man.\r\nBoldwood, who was apparently determined by personal rather than\r\ncommercial reasons, suggested that Oak should be furnished with a horse\r\nfor his sole use, when the plan would present no difficulty, the two\r\nfarms lying side by side. Boldwood did not directly communicate with\r\nher during these negotiations, only speaking to Oak, who was the\r\ngo-between throughout. All was harmoniously arranged at last, and we\r\nnow see Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting the length and\r\nbreadth of about two thousand acres in a cheerful spirit of\r\nsurveillance, as if the crops all belonged to him\xe2\x80\x94the actual mistress\r\nof the one-half and the master of the other, sitting in their\r\nrespective homes in gloomy and sad seclusion.\r\n\r\nOut of this there arose, during the spring succeeding, a talk in the\r\nparish that Gabriel Oak was feathering his nest fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever d\xe2\x80\x99ye think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Susan Tall, \xe2\x80\x9cGable Oak is coming it quite\r\nthe dand. He now wears shining boots with hardly a hob in \xe2\x80\x99em, two or\r\nthree times a-week, and a tall hat a-Sundays, and \xe2\x80\x99a hardly knows the\r\nname of smockfrock. When I see people strut enough to be cut up into\r\nbantam cocks, I stand dormant with wonder, and says no more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was eventually known that Gabriel, though paid a fixed wage by\r\nBathsheba independent of the fluctuations of agricultural profits, had\r\nmade an engagement with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a share of\r\nthe receipts\xe2\x80\x94a small share certainly, yet it was money of a higher\r\nquality than mere wages, and capable of expansion in a way that wages\r\nwere not. Some were beginning to consider Oak a \xe2\x80\x9cnear\xe2\x80\x9d man, for though\r\nhis condition had thus far improved, he lived in no better style than\r\nbefore, occupying the same cottage, paring his own potatoes, mending\r\nhis stockings, and sometimes even making his bed with his own hands.\r\nBut as Oak was not only provokingly indifferent to public opinion, but\r\na man who clung persistently to old habits and usages, simply because\r\nthey were old, there was room for doubt as to his motives.\r\n\r\nA great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood, whose unreasoning\r\ndevotion to Bathsheba could only be characterized as a fond madness\r\nwhich neither time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could weaken\r\nor destroy. This fevered hope had grown up again like a grain of\r\nmustard-seed during the quiet which followed the hasty conjecture that\r\nTroy was drowned. He nourished it fearfully, and almost shunned the\r\ncontemplation of it in earnest, lest facts should reveal the wildness\r\nof the dream. Bathsheba having at last been persuaded to wear mourning,\r\nher appearance as she entered the church in that guise was in itself a\r\nweekly addition to his faith that a time was coming\xe2\x80\x94very far off\r\nperhaps, yet surely nearing\xe2\x80\x94when his waiting on events should have its\r\nreward. How long he might have to wait he had not yet closely\r\nconsidered. What he would try to recognize was that the severe\r\nschooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba much more\r\nconsiderate than she had formerly been of the feelings of others, and\r\nhe trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the future to\r\nmarry any man at all, that man would be himself. There was a substratum\r\nof good feeling in her: her self-reproach for the injury she had\r\nthoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much greater\r\nextent than before her infatuation and disappointment. It would be\r\npossible to approach her by the channel of her good nature, and to\r\nsuggest a friendly businesslike compact between them for fulfilment at\r\nsome future day, keeping the passionate side of his desire entirely out\r\nof her sight. Such was Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s hope.\r\n\r\nTo the eyes of the middle-aged, Bathsheba was perhaps additionally\r\ncharming just now. Her exuberance of spirit was pruned down; the\r\noriginal phantom of delight had shown herself to be not too bright for\r\nhuman nature\xe2\x80\x99s daily food, and she had been able to enter this second\r\npoetical phase without losing much of the first in the process.\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s return from a two months\xe2\x80\x99 visit to her old aunt at Norcombe\r\nafforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for inquiring\r\ndirectly after her\xe2\x80\x94now possibly in the ninth month of her widowhood\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nendeavouring to get a notion of her state of mind regarding him. This\r\noccurred in the middle of the haymaking, and Boldwood contrived to be\r\nnear Liddy, who was assisting in the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia,\xe2\x80\x9d he said pleasantly.\r\n\r\nShe simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so frankly\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her long absence,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nin a manner expressing that the coldest-hearted neighbour could\r\nscarcely say less about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is quite well, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd cheerful, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFearful, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no. I merely said she was cheerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTells you all her affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia, and very wisely,\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe do, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been with her all through her troubles, and was with\r\nher at the time of Mr. Troy\xe2\x80\x99s going and all. And if she were to marry\r\nagain I expect I should bide with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe promises that you shall\xe2\x80\x94quite natural,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strategic lover,\r\nthrobbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s words\r\nappeared to warrant\xe2\x80\x94that his darling had thought of re-marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t promise it exactly. I merely judge on my own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I understand. When she alludes to the possibility of\r\nmarrying again, you conclude\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never do allude to it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, thinking how very stupid\r\nMr. Boldwood was getting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned hastily, his hope falling again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t take quite such long reaches with your rake, Lydia\xe2\x80\x94short and\r\nquick ones are best. Well, perhaps, as she is absolute mistress again\r\nnow, it is wise of her to resolve never to give up her freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress did certainly once say, though not seriously, that she\r\nsupposed she might marry again at the end of seven years from last\r\nyear, if she cared to risk Mr. Troy\xe2\x80\x99s coming back and claiming her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, six years from the present time. Said that she might. She might\r\nmarry at once in every reasonable person\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, whatever the\r\nlawyers may say to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to ask them?\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, growing red. \xe2\x80\x9cLiddy, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t stay here a\r\nminute later than you wish, so Mr. Oak says. I am now going on a little\r\nfarther. Good-afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went away vexed with himself, and ashamed of having for this one\r\ntime in his life done anything which could be called underhand. Poor\r\nBoldwood had no more skill in finesse than a battering-ram, and he was\r\nuneasy with a sense of having made himself to appear stupid and, what\r\nwas worse, mean. But he had, after all, lighted upon one fact by way of\r\nrepayment. It was a singularly fresh and fascinating fact, and though\r\nnot without its sadness it was pertinent and real. In little more than\r\nsix years from this time Bathsheba might certainly marry him. There was\r\nsomething definite in that hope, for admitting that there might have\r\nbeen no deep thought in her words to Liddy about marriage, they showed\r\nat least her creed on the matter.\r\n\r\nThis pleasant notion was now continually in his mind. Six years were a\r\nlong time, but how much shorter than never, the idea he had for so long\r\nbeen obliged to endure! Jacob had served twice seven years for Rachel:\r\nwhat were six for such a woman as this? He tried to like the notion of\r\nwaiting for her better than that of winning her at once. Boldwood felt\r\nhis love to be so deep and strong and eternal, that it was possible she\r\nhad never yet known its full volume, and this patience in delay would\r\nafford him an opportunity of giving sweet proof on the point. He would\r\nannihilate the six years of his life as if they were minutes\xe2\x80\x94so little\r\ndid he value his time on earth beside her love. He would let her see,\r\nall those six years of intangible ethereal courtship, how little care\r\nhe had for anything but as it bore upon the consummation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in which\r\nGreenhill Fair was held. This fair was frequently attended by the folk\r\nof Weatherbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\nTHE SHEEP FAIR\xe2\x80\x94TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE\xe2\x80\x99S HAND\r\n\r\n\r\nGreenhill was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest,\r\nmerriest, noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of the\r\nsheep fair. This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a hill which\r\nretained in good preservation the remains of an ancient earthwork,\r\nconsisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval form\r\nencircling the top of the hill, though somewhat broken down here and\r\nthere. To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a winding\r\nroad ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen acres\r\nenclosed by the bank was the site of the fair. A few permanent\r\nerections dotted the spot, but the majority of visitors patronized\r\ncanvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their\r\nsojourn here.\r\n\r\nShepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started\r\nfrom home two or three days, or even a week, before the fair, driving\r\ntheir charges a few miles each day\xe2\x80\x94not more than ten or twelve\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nresting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at previously\r\nchosen points, where they fed, having fasted since morning. The\r\nshepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit for\r\nthe week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook, which\r\nhe used as the staff of his pilgrimage. Several of the sheep would get\r\nworn and lame, and occasionally a lambing occurred on the road. To meet\r\nthese contingencies, there was frequently provided, to accompany the\r\nflocks from the remoter points, a pony and waggon into which the weakly\r\nones were taken for the remainder of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such long distance from the\r\nhill, and those arrangements were not necessary in their case. But the\r\nlarge united flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a valuable\r\nand imposing multitude which demanded much attention, and on this\r\naccount Gabriel, in addition to Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s shepherd and Cain Ball,\r\naccompanied them along the way, through the decayed old town of\r\nKingsbere, and upward to the plateau,\xe2\x80\x94old George the dog of course\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nWhen the autumn sun slanted over Greenhill this morning and lighted the\r\ndewy flat upon its crest, nebulous clouds of dust were to be seen\r\nfloating between the pairs of hedges which streaked the wide prospect\r\naround in all directions. These gradually converged upon the base of\r\nthe hill, and the flocks became individually visible, climbing the\r\nserpentine ways which led to the top. Thus, in a slow procession, they\r\nentered the opening to which the roads tended, multitude after\r\nmultitude, horned and hornless\xe2\x80\x94blue flocks and red flocks, buff flocks\r\nand brown flocks, even green and salmon-tinted flocks, according to the\r\nfancy of the colourist and custom of the farm. Men were shouting, dogs\r\nwere barking, with greatest animation, but the thronging travellers in\r\nso long a journey had grown nearly indifferent to such terrors, though\r\nthey still bleated piteously at the unwontedness of their experiences,\r\na tall shepherd rising here and there in the midst of them, like a\r\ngigantic idol amid a crowd of prostrate devotees.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of sheep in the fair consisted of South Downs and the\r\nold Wessex horned breeds; to the latter class Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s and Farmer\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s mainly belonged. These filed in about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, their\r\nvermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in\r\ngeometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling\r\nunder each horn. Before and behind came other varieties, perfect\r\nleopards as to the full rich substance of their coats, and only lacking\r\nthe spots. There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed, whose wool\r\nwas beginning to curl like a child\xe2\x80\x99s flaxen hair, though surpassed in\r\nthis respect by the effeminate Leicesters, which were in turn less\r\ncurly than the Cotswolds. But the most picturesque by far was a small\r\nflock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year. Their pied faces\r\nand legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses of wool hanging round their\r\nswarthy foreheads, quite relieved the monotony of the flocks in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAll these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had entered and were\r\npenned before the morning had far advanced, the dog belonging to each\r\nflock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it. Alleys for\r\npedestrians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded with buyers\r\nand sellers from far and near.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the hill an altogether different scene began to\r\nforce itself upon the eye towards midday. A circular tent, of\r\nexceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here. As the\r\nday drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities; and they turned their attention to this\r\ntent and inquired of a man at work there, whose soul seemed\r\nconcentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin\xe2\x80\x99s Ride to York and the\r\nDeath of Black Bess,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man promptly, without turning his\r\neyes or leaving off tying.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly stimulating\r\nharmonies, and the announcement was publicly made, Black Bess standing\r\nin a conspicuous position on the outside, as a living proof, if proof\r\nwere wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances from the stage\r\nover which the people were to enter. These were so convinced by such\r\ngenuine appeals to heart and understanding both that they soon began to\r\ncrowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible Jan Coggan and\r\nJoseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping here to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the great ruffen pushing me!\xe2\x80\x9d screamed a woman in front of Jan\r\nover her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I help pushing ye when the folk behind push me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan,\r\nin a deprecating tone, turning his head towards the aforesaid folk as\r\nfar as he could without turning his body, which was jammed as in a\r\nvice.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence; then the drums and trumpets again sent forth their\r\nechoing notes. The crowd was again ecstasied, and gave another lurch in\r\nwhich Coggan and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind upon the\r\nwomen in front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of such ruffens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed one of these ladies again, as she swayed like a reed shaken\r\nby the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice to the public at\r\nlarge as it stood clustered about his shoulder-blades, \xe2\x80\x9cdid ye ever\r\nhear such onreasonable woman as that? Upon my carcase, neighbours, if I\r\ncould only get out of this cheese-wring, the damn women might eat the\r\nshow for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ye lose yer temper, Jan!\xe2\x80\x9d implored Joseph Poorgrass, in a\r\nwhisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThey might get their men to murder us, for I think by the\r\nshine of their eyes that they be a sinful form of womankind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJan held his tongue, as if he had no objection to be pacified to please\r\na friend, and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder, Poorgrass\r\nbeing flattened like a jumping-jack, and the sixpence, for admission,\r\nwhich he had got ready half-an-hour earlier, having become so reeking\r\nhot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the woman in\r\nspangles, brazen rings set with glass diamonds, and with chalked face\r\nand shoulders, who took the money of him, hastily dropped it again from\r\na fear that some trick had been played to burn her fingers. So they all\r\nentered, and the cloth of the tent, to the eyes of an observer on the\r\noutside, became bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on a\r\nsack of potatoes, caused by the various human heads, backs, and elbows\r\nat high pressure within.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the large tent there were two small dressing-tents. One\r\nof these, alloted to the male performers, was partitioned into halves\r\nby a cloth; and in one of the divisions there was sitting on the grass,\r\npulling on a pair of jack-boots, a young man whom we instantly\r\nrecognise as Sergeant Troy.\r\n\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for. The\r\nbrig aboard which he was taken in Budmouth Roads was about to start on\r\na voyage, though somewhat short of hands. Troy read the articles and\r\njoined, but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the bay to\r\nLulwind cove; as he had half expected, his clothes were gone. He\r\nultimately worked his passage to the United States, where he made a\r\nprecarious living in various towns as Professor of Gymnastics, Sword\r\nExercise, Fencing, and Pugilism. A few months were sufficient to give\r\nhim a distaste for this kind of life. There was a certain animal form\r\nof refinement in his nature; and however pleasant a strange condition\r\nmight be whilst privations were easily warded off, it was\r\ndisadvantageously coarse when money was short. There was ever present,\r\ntoo, the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts did he but\r\nchose to return to England and Weatherbury Farm. Whether Bathsheba\r\nthought him dead was a frequent subject of curious conjecture. To\r\nEngland he did return at last; but the fact of drawing nearer to\r\nWeatherbury abstracted its fascinations, and his intention to enter his\r\nold groove at the place became modified. It was with gloom he\r\nconsidered on landing at Liverpool that if he were to go home his\r\nreception would be of a kind very unpleasant to contemplate; for what\r\nTroy had in the way of emotion was an occasional fitful sentiment which\r\nsometimes caused him as much inconvenience as emotion of a strong and\r\nhealthy kind. Bathsheba was not a woman to be made a fool of, or a\r\nwoman to suffer in silence; and how could he endure existence with a\r\nspirited wife to whom at first entering he would be beholden for food\r\nand lodging? Moreover, it was not at all unlikely that his wife would\r\nfail at her farming, if she had not already done so; and he would then\r\nbecome liable for her maintenance: and what a life such a future of\r\npoverty with her would be, the spectre of Fanny constantly between\r\nthem, harrowing his temper and embittering her words! Thus, for reasons\r\ntouching on distaste, regret, and shame commingled, he put off his\r\nreturn from day to day, and would have decided to put it off altogether\r\nif he could have found anywhere else the ready-made establishment which\r\nexisted for him there.\r\n\r\nAt this time\xe2\x80\x94the July preceding the September in which we find at\r\nGreenhill Fair\xe2\x80\x94he fell in with a travelling circus which was performing\r\nin the outskirts of a northern town. Troy introduced himself to the\r\nmanager by taming a restive horse of the troupe, hitting a suspended\r\napple with a pistol-bullet fired from the animal\xe2\x80\x99s back when in full\r\ngallop, and other feats. For his merits in these\xe2\x80\x94all more or less based\r\nupon his experiences as a dragoon-guardsman\xe2\x80\x94Troy was taken into the\r\ncompany, and the play of Turpin was prepared with a view to his\r\npersonation of the chief character. Troy was not greatly elated by the\r\nappreciative spirit in which he was undoubtedly treated, but he thought\r\nthe engagement might afford him a few weeks for consideration. It was\r\nthus carelessly, and without having formed any definite plan for the\r\nfuture, that Troy found himself at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the\r\ncompany on this day.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in front of the pavilion the\r\nfollowing incident had taken place. Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x94who was driven to the\r\nfair that day by her odd man Poorgrass\xe2\x80\x94had, like every one else, read\r\nor heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great Cosmopolitan\r\nEquestrian and Roughrider, would enact the part of Turpin, and she was\r\nnot yet too old and careworn to be without a little curiosity to see\r\nhim. This particular show was by far the largest and grandest in the\r\nfair, a horde of little shows grouping themselves under its shade like\r\nchickens around a hen. The crowd had passed in, and Boldwood, who had\r\nbeen watching all the day for an opportunity of speaking to her, seeing\r\nher comparatively isolated, came up to her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the centre\r\nof her cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI was fortunate enough to sell them all just as we got\r\nupon the hill, so we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t to pen at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you are entirely at leisure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, except that I have to see one more dealer in two hours\xe2\x80\x99 time:\r\notherwise I should be going home. He was looking at this large tent and\r\nthe announcement. Have you ever seen the play of \xe2\x80\x98Turpin\xe2\x80\x99s Ride to\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x99? Turpin was a real man, was he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, perfectly true\xe2\x80\x94all of it. Indeed, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Jan\r\nCoggan say that a relation of his knew Tom King, Turpin\xe2\x80\x99s friend, quite\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoggan is rather given to strange stories connected with his\r\nrelations, we must remember. I hope they can all be believed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; we know Coggan. But Turpin is true enough. You have never\r\nseen it played, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. I was not allowed to go into these places when I was young.\r\nHark! What\xe2\x80\x99s that prancing? How they shout!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack Bess just started off, I suppose. Am I right in supposing you\r\nwould like to see the performance, Mrs. Troy? Please excuse my mistake,\r\nif it is one; but if you would like to, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a seat for you with\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d Perceiving that she hesitated, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI myself shall not\r\nstay to see it: I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Bathsheba did care a little to see the show, and had only withheld\r\nher feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone. She had\r\nbeen hoping that Oak might appear, whose assistance in such cases was\r\nalways accepted as an inalienable right, but Oak was nowhere to be\r\nseen; and hence it was that she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThen if you will just look in\r\nfirst, to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s room, I think I will go in for a minute or\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared in the tent with\r\nBoldwood at her elbow, who, taking her to a \xe2\x80\x9creserved\xe2\x80\x9d seat, again\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nThis feature consisted of one raised bench in a very conspicuous part\r\nof the circle, covered with red cloth, and floored with a piece of\r\ncarpet, and Bathsheba immediately found, to her confusion, that she was\r\nthe single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of the crowded\r\nspectators, one and all, standing on their legs on the borders of the\r\narena, where they got twice as good a view of the performance for half\r\nthe money. Hence as many eyes were turned upon her, enthroned alone in\r\nthis place of honour, against a scarlet background, as upon the ponies\r\nand clown who were engaged in preliminary exploits in the centre,\r\nTurpin not having yet appeared. Once there, Bathsheba was forced to\r\nmake the best of it and remain: she sat down, spreading her skirts with\r\nsome dignity over the unoccupied space on each side of her, and giving\r\na new and feminine aspect to the pavilion. In a few minutes she noticed\r\nthe fat red nape of Coggan\xe2\x80\x99s neck among those standing just below her,\r\nand Joseph Poorgrass\xe2\x80\x99s saintly profile a little further on.\r\n\r\nThe interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade. The strange luminous\r\nsemi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into\r\nRembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and\r\ndivisions in the canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust across the\r\ndusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent, until they alighted\r\non inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like little lamps\r\nsuspended there.\r\n\r\nTroy, on peeping from his dressing-tent through a slit for a\r\nreconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious wife on high before\r\nhim as described, sitting as queen of the tournament. He started back\r\nin utter confusion, for although his disguise effectually concealed his\r\npersonality, he instantly felt that she would be sure to recognize his\r\nvoice. He had several times during the day thought of the possibility\r\nof some Weatherbury person or other appearing and recognizing him; but\r\nhe had taken the risk carelessly. If they see me, let them, he had\r\nsaid. But here was Bathsheba in her own person; and the reality of the\r\nscene was so much intenser than any of his prefigurings that he felt he\r\nhad not half enough considered the point.\r\n\r\nShe looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury\r\npeople was changed. He had not expected her to exercise this power over\r\nhim in the twinkling of an eye. Should he go on, and care nothing? He\r\ncould not bring himself to do that. Beyond a politic wish to remain\r\nunknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of shame at the\r\npossibility that his attractive young wife, who already despised him,\r\nshould despise him more by discovering him in so mean a condition after\r\nso long a time. He actually blushed at the thought, and was vexed\r\nbeyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards Weatherbury\r\nshould have led him to dally about the country in this way.\r\n\r\nBut Troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit\xe2\x80\x99s end.\r\nHe hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing\r\nspace from that of the manager and proprietor, who now appeared as the\r\nindividual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and as the\r\naforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the devil to pay!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a blackguard creditor in the tent I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if I open my mouth.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must appear now, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the play must proceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you give out that Turpin has got a bad cold, and can\xe2\x80\x99t speak his\r\npart, but that he\xe2\x80\x99ll perform it just the same without speaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proprietor shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, play or no play, I won\xe2\x80\x99t open my mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then let me see. I tell you how we\xe2\x80\x99ll manage,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nother, who perhaps felt it would be extremely awkward to offend his\r\nleading man just at this time. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tell \xe2\x80\x99em anything about your\r\nkeeping silence; go on with the piece and say nothing, doing what you\r\ncan by a judicious wink now and then, and a few indomitable nods in the\r\nheroic places, you know. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never find out that the speeches are\r\nomitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis seemed feasible enough, for Turpin\xe2\x80\x99s speeches were not many or\r\nlong, the fascination of the piece lying entirely in the action; and\r\naccordingly the play began, and at the appointed time Black Bess leapt\r\ninto the grassy circle amid the plaudits of the spectators. At the\r\nturnpike scene, where Bess and Turpin are hotly pursued at midnight by\r\nthe officers, and the half-awake gatekeeper in his tasselled nightcap\r\ndenies that any horseman has passed, Coggan uttered a broad-chested\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d which could be heard all over the fair above the bleating,\r\nand Poorgrass smiled delightedly with a nice sense of dramatic contrast\r\nbetween our hero, who coolly leaps the gate, and halting justice in the\r\nform of his enemies, who must needs pull up cumbersomely and wait to be\r\nlet through. At the death of Tom King, he could not refrain from\r\nseizing Coggan by the hand, and whispering, with tears in his eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse he\xe2\x80\x99s not really shot, Jan\xe2\x80\x94only seemingly!\xe2\x80\x9d And when the last sad\r\nscene came on, and the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had to be\r\ncarried out on a shutter by twelve volunteers from among the\r\nspectators, nothing could restrain Poorgrass from lending a hand,\r\nexclaiming, as he asked Jan to join him, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twill be something to tell\r\nof at Warren\xe2\x80\x99s in future years, Jan, and hand down to our children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFor many a year in Weatherbury, Joseph told, with the air of a man who\r\nhad had experiences in his time, that he touched with his own hand the\r\nhoof of Bess as she lay upon the board upon his shoulder. If, as some\r\nthinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmemories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never had\r\ndone so before.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make-up for the\r\ncharacter, the more effectually to disguise himself, and though he had\r\nfelt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis effected by\r\njudiciously \xe2\x80\x9clining\xe2\x80\x9d his face with a wire rendered him safe from the\r\neyes of Bathsheba and her men. Nevertheless, he was relieved when it\r\nwas got through.\r\n\r\nThere was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was lighted\r\nup. Troy had taken his part very quietly this time, venturing to\r\nintroduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just concluding it when,\r\nwhilst standing at the edge of the circle contiguous to the first row\r\nof spectators, he observed within a yard of him the eye of a man darted\r\nkeenly into his side features. Troy hastily shifted his position, after\r\nhaving recognized in the scrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.\r\n\r\nAt first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances.\r\nThat he had been recognized by this man was highly probable; yet there\r\nwas room for a doubt. Then the great objection he had felt to allowing\r\nnews of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the event of his\r\nreturn, based on a feeling that knowledge of his present occupation\r\nwould discredit him still further in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, returned in full\r\nforce. Moreover, should he resolve not to return at all, a tale of his\r\nbeing alive and being in the neighbourhood would be awkward; and he was\r\nanxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s temporal affairs before\r\ndeciding which to do.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma Troy at once went out to reconnoitre. It occurred to\r\nhim that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible, would\r\nbe a very wise act. He had put on a thick beard borrowed from the\r\nestablishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field. It was now\r\nalmost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts and gigs\r\nready to go home.\r\n\r\nThe largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an innkeeper\r\nfrom a neighbouring town. This was considered an unexceptionable place\r\nfor obtaining the necessary food and rest: Host Trencher (as he was\r\njauntily called by the local newspaper) being a substantial man of high\r\nrepute for catering through all the country round. The tent was divided\r\ninto first and second-class compartments, and at the end of the\r\nfirst-class division was a yet further enclosure for the most\r\nexclusive, fenced off from the body of the tent by a luncheon-bar,\r\nbehind which the host himself stood bustling about in white apron and\r\nshirt-sleeves, and looking as if he had never lived anywhere but under\r\ncanvas all his life. In these penetralia were chairs and a table,\r\nwhich, on candles being lighted, made quite a cozy and luxurious show,\r\nwith an urn, plated tea and coffee pots, china teacups, and plum cakes.\r\n\r\nTroy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a gipsy-woman was frying\r\npancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a penny\r\na-piece, and looked over the heads of the people within. He could see\r\nnothing of Pennyways, but he soon discerned Bathsheba through an\r\nopening into the reserved space at the further end. Troy thereupon\r\nretreated, went round the tent into the darkness, and listened. He\r\ncould hear Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s voice immediately inside the canvas; she was\r\nconversing with a man. A warmth overspread his face: surely she was not\r\nso unprincipled as to flirt in a fair! He wondered if, then, she\r\nreckoned upon his death as an absolute certainty. To get at the root of\r\nthe matter, Troy took a penknife from his pocket and softly made two\r\nlittle cuts crosswise in the cloth, which, by folding back the corners\r\nleft a hole the size of a wafer. Close to this he placed his face,\r\nwithdrawing it again in a movement of surprise; for his eye had been\r\nwithin twelve inches of the top of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s head. It was too near to\r\nbe convenient. He made another hole a little to one side and lower\r\ndown, in a shaded place beside her chair, from which it was easy and\r\nsafe to survey her by looking horizontally.\r\n\r\nTroy took in the scene completely now. She was leaning back, sipping a\r\ncup of tea that she held in her hand, and the owner of the male voice\r\nwas Boldwood, who had apparently just brought the cup to her,\r\nBathsheba, being in a negligent mood, leant so idly against the canvas\r\nthat it was pressed to the shape of her shoulder, and she was, in fact,\r\nas good as in Troy\xe2\x80\x99s arms; and he was obliged to keep his breast\r\ncarefully backward that she might not feel its warmth through the cloth\r\nas he gazed in.\r\n\r\nTroy found unexpected chords of feeling to be stirred again within him\r\nas they had been stirred earlier in the day. She was handsome as ever,\r\nand she was his. It was some minutes before he could counteract his\r\nsudden wish to go in, and claim her. Then he thought how the proud girl\r\nwho had always looked down upon him even whilst it was to love him,\r\nwould hate him on discovering him to be a strolling player. Were he to\r\nmake himself known, that chapter of his life must at all risks be kept\r\nfor ever from her and from the Weatherbury people, or his name would be\r\na byword throughout the parish. He would be nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cTurpin\xe2\x80\x9d as long\r\nas he lived. Assuredly before he could claim her these few past months\r\nof his existence must be entirely blotted out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get you another cup before you start, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d said Farmer\r\nBoldwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must be going at once. It was great\r\nneglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late. I should have\r\ngone two hours ago, if it had not been for him. I had no idea of coming\r\nin here; but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing so refreshing as a cup of tea, though I\r\nshould never have got one if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t helped me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles, and watched each\r\nvarying shade thereon, and the white shell-like sinuosities of her\r\nlittle ear. She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on\r\npaying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered\r\nthe tent. Troy trembled: here was his scheme for respectability\r\nendangered at once. He was about to leave his hole of espial, attempt\r\nto follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had recognized him,\r\nwhen he was arrested by the conversation, and found he was too late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pennyways; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve some private information for\r\nyour ear alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot hear it now,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coldly. That Bathsheba could not\r\nendure this man was evident; in fact, he was continually coming to her\r\nwith some tale or other, by which he might creep into favour at the\r\nexpense of persons maligned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll write it down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pennyways, confidently. He stooped over the\r\ntable, pulled a leaf from a warped pocket-book, and wrote upon the\r\npaper, in a round hand\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your husband is here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the fool now?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis he folded small, and handed towards her. Bathsheba would not read\r\nit; she would not even put out her hand to take it. Pennyways, then,\r\nwith a laugh of derision, tossed it into her lap, and, turning away,\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\nFrom the words and action of Pennyways, Troy, though he had not been\r\nable to see what the ex-bailiff wrote, had not a moment\xe2\x80\x99s doubt that\r\nthe note referred to him. Nothing that he could think of could be done\r\nto check the exposure. \xe2\x80\x9cCurse my luck!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, and added\r\nimprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind.\r\nMeanwhile Boldwood said, taking up the note from her lap\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy? If not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll destroy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps it is unjust not to\r\nread it; but I can guess what it is about. He wants me to recommend\r\nhim, or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected\r\nwith my work-people. He\xe2\x80\x99s always doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba held the note in her right hand. Boldwood handed towards her\r\na plate of cut bread-and-butter; when, in order to take a slice, she\r\nput the note into her left hand, where she was still holding the purse,\r\nand then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to the canvas. The\r\nmoment had come for saving his game, and Troy impulsively felt that he\r\nwould play the card. For yet another time he looked at the fair hand,\r\nand saw the pink finger-tips, and the blue veins of the wrist,\r\nencircled by a bracelet of coral chippings which she wore: how familiar\r\nit all was to him! Then, with the lightning action in which he was such\r\nan adept, he noiselessly slipped his hand under the bottom of the\r\ntent-cloth, which was far from being pinned tightly down, lifted it a\r\nlittle way, keeping his eye to the hole, snatched the note from her\r\nfingers, dropped the canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank\r\nand ditch, smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from her.\r\nTroy then slid down on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in\r\nthe bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards,\r\nascended again, and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front\r\nentrance of the tent. His object was now to get to Pennyways, and\r\nprevent a repetition of the announcement until such time as he should\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nTroy reached the tent door, and standing among the groups there\r\ngathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways, evidently not wishing to make\r\nhimself prominent by inquiring for him. One or two men were speaking of\r\na daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young lady by lifting\r\nthe canvas of the tent beside her. It was supposed that the rogue had\r\nimagined a slip of paper which she held in her hand to be a bank note,\r\nfor he had seized it, and made off with it, leaving her purse behind.\r\nHis chagrin and disappointment at discovering its worthlessness would\r\nbe a good joke, it was said. However, the occurrence seemed to have\r\nbecome known to few, for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who had\r\nlately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor the four bowed old\r\nmen with grim countenances and walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor Malley\xe2\x80\x99s Reel\xe2\x80\x9d to the tune. Behind these stood Pennyways. Troy\r\nglided up to him, beckoned, and whispered a few words; and with a\r\nmutual glance of concurrence the two men went into the night together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\nBATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement for getting back again to Weatherbury had been that Oak\r\nshould take the place of Poorgrass in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s conveyance and drive\r\nher home, it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph was\r\nsuffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye, and was,\r\ntherefore, hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman. But\r\nOak had found himself so occupied, and was full of so many cares\r\nrelative to those portions of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s flocks that were not disposed\r\nof, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or anybody, resolved to drive\r\nhome herself, as she had many times done from Casterbridge Market, and\r\ntrust to her good angel for performing the journey unmolested. But\r\nhaving fallen in with Farmer Boldwood accidentally (on her part at\r\nleast) at the refreshment-tent, she found it impossible to refuse his\r\noffer to ride on horseback beside her as escort. It had grown twilight\r\nbefore she was aware, but Boldwood assured her that there was no cause\r\nfor uneasiness, as the moon would be up in half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the incident in the tent, she had risen to go\xe2\x80\x94now\r\nabsolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotection\xe2\x80\x94though regretting Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s absence, whose company she would\r\nhave much preferred, as being more proper as well as more pleasant,\r\nsince he was her own managing-man and servant. This, however, could not\r\nbe helped; she would not, on any consideration, treat Boldwood harshly,\r\nhaving once already ill-used him, and the moon having risen, and the\r\ngig being ready, she drove across the hilltop in the wending way\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhich led downwards\xe2\x80\x94to oblivious obscurity, as it seemed, for the moon\r\nand the hill it flooded with light were in appearance on a level, the\r\nrest of the world lying as a vast shady concave between them. Boldwood\r\nmounted his horse, and followed in close attendance behind. Thus they\r\ndescended into the lowlands, and the sounds of those left on the hill\r\ncame like voices from the sky, and the lights were as those of a camp\r\nin heaven. They soon passed the merry stragglers in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the hill, traversed Kingsbere, and got upon the high road.\r\n\r\nThe keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s staunch\r\ndevotion to herself was still undiminished, and she sympathized deeply.\r\nThe sight had quite depressed her this evening; had reminded her of her\r\nfolly; she wished anew, as she had wished many months ago, for some\r\nmeans of making reparation for her fault. Hence her pity for the man\r\nwho so persistently loved on to his own injury and permanent gloom had\r\nbetrayed Bathsheba into an injudicious considerateness of manner, which\r\nappeared almost like tenderness, and gave new vigour to the exquisite\r\ndream of a Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s seven years service in poor Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nHe soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear,\r\nand rode close by her side. They had gone two or three miles in the\r\nmoonlight, speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning\r\nthe fair, farming, Oak\xe2\x80\x99s usefulness to them both, and other indifferent\r\nsubjects, when Boldwood said suddenly and simply\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy, you will marry again some day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis point-blank query unmistakably confused her, and it was not till a\r\nminute or more had elapsed that she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have not seriously thought\r\nof any such subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand that. Yet your late husband has been dead nearly\r\none year, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget that his death was never absolutely proved, and may not\r\nhave taken place; so that I may not be really a widow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ncatching at the straw of escape that the fact afforded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved circumstantially. A\r\nman saw him drowning, too. No reasonable person has any doubt of his\r\ndeath; nor have you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I should imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have none now, or I should have acted differently,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\ngently. \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly, at first, had a strange unaccountable feeling\r\nthat he could not have perished, but I have been able to explain that\r\nin several ways since. But though I am fully persuaded that I shall see\r\nhim no more, I am far from thinking of marriage with another. I should\r\nbe very contemptible to indulge in such a thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent now awhile, and having struck into an unfrequented\r\ntrack across a common, the creaks of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s saddle and her gig\r\nsprings were all the sounds to be heard. Boldwood ended the pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when I carried you fainting in my arms into the King\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nArms, in Casterbridge? Every dog has his day: that was mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know it all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, for one, shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as to\r\ndeny you to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, too, am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and then checked herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean,\r\nyou know, I am sorry you thought I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times\r\nwith you\xe2\x80\x94that I was something to you before _he_ was anything, and that\r\nyou belonged _almost_ to me. But, of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. You never\r\nliked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did; and respected you, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like me, or do you respect me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94at least, I cannot tell you. It is difficult for a woman\r\nto define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to\r\nexpress theirs. My treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable,\r\nwicked! I shall eternally regret it. If there had been anything I could\r\nhave done to make amends I would most gladly have done it\xe2\x80\x94there was\r\nnothing on earth I so longed to do as to repair the error. But that was\r\nnot possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself\xe2\x80\x94you were not so far in the wrong as you suppose.\r\nBathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are what, in\r\nfact, you are\xe2\x80\x94a widow\xe2\x80\x94would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t yet, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you might at some future time of your life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I might at some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, do you know that without further proof of any kind you may\r\nmarry again in about six years from the present\xe2\x80\x94subject to nobody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobjection or blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know all that. But don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94seven or six years\xe2\x80\x94where may we all be by that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will soon glide by, and it will seem an astonishingly short time\r\nto look back upon when they are past\xe2\x80\x94much less than to look forward to\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow listen once more,\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I wait that time, will\r\nyou marry me? You own that you owe me amends\xe2\x80\x94let that be your way of\r\nmaking them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94six years\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be the wife of any other man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed! I mean, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about this matter now.\r\nPerhaps it is not proper, and I ought not to allow it. Let us drop it.\r\nMy husband may be living, as I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop the subject if you wish. But propriety has\r\nnothing to do with reasons. I am a middle-aged man, willing to protect\r\nyou for the remainder of our lives. On your side, at least, there is no\r\npassion or blamable haste\xe2\x80\x94on mine, perhaps, there is. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nseeing that if you choose from a feeling of pity, and, as you say, a\r\nwish to make amends, to make a bargain with me for a far-ahead time\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nagreement which will set all things right and make me happy, late\r\nthough it may be\xe2\x80\x94there is no fault to be found with you as a woman.\r\nHadn\xe2\x80\x99t I the first place beside you? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been almost mine once\r\nalready? Surely you can say to me as much as this, you will have me\r\nback again should circumstances permit? Now, pray speak! O Bathsheba,\r\npromise\xe2\x80\x94it is only a little promise\xe2\x80\x94that if you marry again, you will\r\nmarry me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment, even\r\nwhilst she sympathized. It was a simple physical fear\xe2\x80\x94the weak of the\r\nstrong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance. She said,\r\nwith some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly his\r\noutburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his\r\nanger:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,\r\nwhatever comes\xe2\x80\x94but to say more\xe2\x80\x94you have taken me so by surprise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let it stand in these simple words\xe2\x80\x94that in six years\xe2\x80\x99 time you\r\nwill be my wife? Unexpected accidents we\xe2\x80\x99ll not mention, because those,\r\nof course, must be given way to. Now, this time I know you will keep\r\nyour word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I hesitate to give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do give it! Remember the past, and be kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe breathed; and then said mournfully: \xe2\x80\x9cOh what shall I do? I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlove you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a\r\nwoman ought to love a husband. If you, sir, know that, and I can yet\r\ngive you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six years,\r\nif my husband should not come back, it is a great honour to me. And if\r\nyou value such an act of friendship from a woman who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t esteem\r\nherself as she did, and has little love left, why I\xe2\x80\x94I will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Consider, if I cannot promise soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut soon is perhaps never?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, it is not! I mean soon. Christmas, we\xe2\x80\x99ll say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristmas!\xe2\x80\x9d He said nothing further till he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say no\r\nmore to you about it till that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind, which showed how\r\nentirely the soul is the slave of the body, the ethereal spirit\r\ndependent for its quality upon the tangible flesh and blood. It is\r\nhardly too much to say that she felt coerced by a force stronger than\r\nher own will, not only into the act of promising upon this singularly\r\nremote and vague matter, but into the emotion of fancying that she\r\nought to promise. When the weeks intervening between the night of this\r\nconversation and Christmas day began perceptibly to diminish, her\r\nanxiety and perplexity increased.\r\n\r\nOne day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential dialogue\r\nwith Gabriel about her difficulty. It afforded her a little relief\xe2\x80\x94of a\r\ndull and cheerless kind. They were auditing accounts, and something\r\noccurred in the course of their labours which led Oak to say, speaking\r\nof Boldwood, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, never.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen out came her trouble before she was aware; and she told him how\r\nshe had again got into the toils; what Boldwood had asked her, and how\r\nhe was expecting her assent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most mournful reason of all for my\r\nagreeing to it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sadly, \xe2\x80\x9cand the true reason why I think to do\r\nso for good or for evil, is this\xe2\x80\x94it is a thing I have not breathed to a\r\nliving soul as yet\xe2\x80\x94I believe that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t give my word, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go out\r\nof his mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, do ye?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe this,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, with reckless frankness; \xe2\x80\x9cand Heaven\r\nknows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved\r\nand troubled to my soul about it\xe2\x80\x94I believe I hold that man\xe2\x80\x99s future in\r\nmy hand. His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him. O\r\nGabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for it is terrible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think this much, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, as I told you years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat his life is a total blank whenever he isn\xe2\x80\x99t hoping for \xe2\x80\x99ee; but I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t suppose\xe2\x80\x94I hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you\r\nfancy. His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you know.\r\nBut since the case is so sad and odd-like, why don\xe2\x80\x99t ye give the\r\nconditional promise? I think I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it right? Some rash acts of my past life have taught me that a\r\nwatched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a very\r\nlittle credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this! And six\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94why we may all be in our graves by that time, even if Mr. Troy\r\ndoes not come back again, which he may not impossibly do! Such thoughts\r\ngive a sort of absurdity to the scheme. Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it preposterous,\r\nGabriel? However he came to dream of it, I cannot think. But is it\r\nwrong? You know\xe2\x80\x94you are older than I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight years older, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, eight years\xe2\x80\x94and is it wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to make:\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything really wrong about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact\r\nthe very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under\r\nany condition, that is, your not caring about him\xe2\x80\x94for I may suppose\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may suppose that love is wanting,\xe2\x80\x9d she said shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cLove is\r\nan utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me\xe2\x80\x94for him or\r\nany one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away harm\r\nfrom such an agreement with him. If wild heat had to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 it, making\r\nye long to over-come the awkwardness about your husband\xe2\x80\x99s vanishing, it\r\nmid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige a man seems\r\ndifferent, somehow. The real sin, ma\xe2\x80\x99am in my mind, lies in thinking of\r\never wedding wi\xe2\x80\x99 a man you don\xe2\x80\x99t love honest and true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to pay the penalty of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow, Gabriel, this is what I cannot get off my conscience\xe2\x80\x94that I once\r\nseriously injured him in sheer idleness. If I had never played a trick\r\nupon him, he would never have wanted to marry me. Oh if I could only\r\npay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm I did, and so get\r\nthe sin off my soul that way!... Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s the debt, which can only\r\nbe discharged in one way, and I believe I am bound to do it if it\r\nhonestly lies in my power, without any consideration of my own future\r\nat all. When a rake gambles away his expectations, the fact that it is\r\nan inconvenient debt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make him the less liable. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a\r\nrake, and the single point I ask you is, considering that my own\r\nscruples, and the fact that in the eye of the law my husband is only\r\nmissing, will keep any man from marrying me until seven years have\r\npassed\xe2\x80\x94am I free to entertain such an idea, even though \xe2\x80\x99tis a sort of\r\npenance\xe2\x80\x94for it will be that? I _hate_ the act of marriage under such\r\ncircumstances, and the class of women I should seem to belong to by\r\ndoing it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that all depends upon whe\xe2\x80\x99r you think, as everybody\r\nelse do, that your husband is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve long ceased to doubt that. I well know what would have\r\nbrought him back long before this time if he had lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, in a religious sense you will be as free to _think_ o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarrying again as any real widow of one year\xe2\x80\x99s standing. But why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nye ask Mr. Thirdly\xe2\x80\x99s advice on how to treat Mr. Boldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. When I want a broad-minded opinion for general enlightenment,\r\ndistinct from special advice, I never go to a man who deals in the\r\nsubject professionally. So I like the parson\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on law, the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s on doctoring, the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s on business, and my\r\nbusiness-man\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94that is, yours\xe2\x80\x94on morals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99s a hitch in that argument,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, with a grave\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nShe did not reply at once, and then saying, \xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, Mr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor expected any reply from\r\nGabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained. Yet in the\r\ncentremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute\r\na little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not allow\r\nherself to recognize. Oak had not once wished her free that he might\r\nmarry her himself\xe2\x80\x94had not once said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could wait for you as well as\r\nhe.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the insect sting. Not that she would have listened to any\r\nsuch hypothesis. O no\xe2\x80\x94for wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she saying all the time that such\r\nthoughts of the future were improper, and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Gabriel far too poor a\r\nman to speak sentiment to her? Yet he might have just hinted about that\r\nold love of his, and asked, in a playful off-hand way, if he might\r\nspeak of it. It would have seemed pretty and sweet, if no more; and\r\nthen she would have shown how kind and inoffensive a woman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d can\r\nsometimes be. But to give such cool advice\xe2\x80\x94the very advice she had\r\nasked for\xe2\x80\x94it ruffled our heroine all the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\nCONVERGING COURSES\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nChristmas-eve came, and a party that Boldwood was to give in the\r\nevening was the great subject of talk in Weatherbury. It was not that\r\nthe rarity of Christmas parties in the parish made this one a wonder,\r\nbut that Boldwood should be the giver. The announcement had had an\r\nabnormal and incongruous sound, as if one should hear of\r\ncroquet-playing in a cathedral aisle, or that some much-respected judge\r\nwas going upon the stage. That the party was intended to be a truly\r\njovial one there was no room for doubt. A large bough of mistletoe had\r\nbeen brought from the woods that day, and suspended in the hall of the\r\nbachelor\xe2\x80\x99s home. Holly and ivy had followed in armfuls. From six that\r\nmorning till past noon the huge wood fire in the kitchen roared and\r\nsparkled at its highest, the kettle, the saucepan, and the three-legged\r\npot appearing in the midst of the flames like Shadrach, Meshach, and\r\nAbednego; moreover, roasting and basting operations were continually\r\ncarried on in front of the genial blaze.\r\n\r\nAs it grew later the fire was made up in the large long hall into which\r\nthe staircase descended, and all encumbrances were cleared out for\r\ndancing. The log which was to form the back-brand of the evening fire\r\nwas the uncleft trunk of a tree, so unwieldy that it could be neither\r\nbrought nor rolled to its place; and accordingly two men were to be\r\nobserved dragging and heaving it in by chains and levers as the hour of\r\nassembly drew near.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, the spirit of revelry was wanting in the\r\natmosphere of the house. Such a thing had never been attempted before\r\nby its owner, and it was now done as by a wrench. Intended gaieties\r\nwould insist upon appearing like solemn grandeurs, the organization of\r\nthe whole effort was carried out coldly, by hirelings, and a shadow\r\nseemed to move about the rooms, saying that the proceedings were\r\nunnatural to the place and the lone man who lived therein, and hence\r\nnot good.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBathsheba was at this time in her room, dressing for the event. She had\r\ncalled for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side of\r\nher mistress\xe2\x80\x99s glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go away, Liddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, almost timidly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am foolishly\r\nagitated\xe2\x80\x94I cannot tell why. I wish I had not been obliged to go to this\r\ndance; but there\xe2\x80\x99s no escaping now. I have not spoken to Mr. Boldwood\r\nsince the autumn, when I promised to see him at Christmas on business,\r\nbut I had no idea there was to be anything of this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I would go now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, who was going with her; for Boldwood\r\nhad been indiscriminate in his invitations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall make my appearance, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am\r\n_the cause_ of the party, and that upsets me!\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell, Liddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. You the cause of it, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am the reason of the party\xe2\x80\x94I. If it had not been for me, there\r\nwould never have been one. I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain any more\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no more to\r\nbe explained. I wish I had never seen Weatherbury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wicked of you\xe2\x80\x94to wish to be worse off than you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Liddy. I have never been free from trouble since I have lived\r\nhere, and this party is likely to bring me more. Now, fetch my black\r\nsilk dress, and see how it sits upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will leave off that, surely, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? You have been a widow-lady\r\nfourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on such a night as\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it necessary? No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear any\r\nlight dress people would say things about me, and I should seem to be\r\nrejoicing when I am solemn all the time. The party doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit me a\r\nbit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBoldwood was dressing also at this hour. A tailor from Casterbridge was\r\nwith him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat that\r\nhad just been brought home.\r\n\r\nNever had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit, and\r\ngenerally difficult to please. The tailor walked round and round him,\r\ntugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar, and for\r\nthe first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored. Times had been\r\nwhen the farmer had exclaimed against all such niceties as childish,\r\nbut now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever was provoked by this\r\nman for attaching as much importance to a crease in the coat as to an\r\nearthquake in South America. Boldwood at last expressed himself nearly\r\nsatisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor passing out of the door just\r\nas Oak came in to report progress for the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall of course see you here to-night.\r\nMake yourself merry. I am determined that neither expense nor trouble\r\nshall be spared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Gabriel, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad indeed to see such a change in \xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nfrom what it used to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94I must own it\xe2\x80\x94I am bright to-night: cheerful and more than\r\ncheerful\xe2\x80\x94so much so that I am almost sad again with the sense that all\r\nof it is passing away. And sometimes, when I am excessively hopeful and\r\nblithe, a trouble is looming in the distance: so that I often get to\r\nlook upon gloom in me with content, and to fear a happy mood. Still\r\nthis may be absurd\xe2\x80\x94I feel that it is absurd. Perhaps my day is dawning\r\nat last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it \xe2\x80\x99ill be a long and a fair one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you\xe2\x80\x94thank you. Yet perhaps my cheerfulness rests on a slender\r\nhope. And yet I trust my hope. It is faith, not hope. I think this time\r\nI reckon with my host.\xe2\x80\x94Oak, my hands are a little shaky, or something;\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t tie this neckerchief properly. Perhaps you will tie it for me.\r\nThe fact is, I have not been well lately, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear that, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I want it done as well as you can, please. Is there\r\nany late knot in fashion, Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. His tone had sunk to sadness.\r\n\r\nBoldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the farmer\r\nwent on feverishly\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not inconvenient to her she may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Or rather an implied promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t answer for her implying,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, with faint bitterness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a word as full o\xe2\x80\x99 holes as a sieve with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOak, don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that. You have got quite cynical lately\xe2\x80\x94how is\r\nit? We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the young and\r\nhopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one. However, does a woman\r\nkeep a promise, not to marry, but to enter on an engagement to marry at\r\nsome time? Now you know women better than I\xe2\x80\x94tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afeard you honour my understanding too much. However, she may\r\nkeep such a promise, if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not gone far yet, but I think it will soon\xe2\x80\x94yes, I know it\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in an impulsive whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cI have pressed her upon the\r\nsubject, and she inclines to be kind to me, and to think of me as a\r\nhusband at a long future time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me. How can I\r\nexpect more? She has a notion that a woman should not marry within\r\nseven years of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance\xe2\x80\x94that her own self shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nI mean\xe2\x80\x94because his body was not found. It may be merely this legal\r\nreason which influences her, or it may be a religious one, but she is\r\nreluctant to talk on the point. Yet she has promised\xe2\x80\x94implied\xe2\x80\x94that she\r\nwill ratify an engagement to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven years,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cFive years,\r\nnine months, and a few days. Fifteen months nearly have passed since he\r\nvanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of little\r\nmore than five years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems long in a forward view. Don\xe2\x80\x99t build too much upon such\r\npromises, sir. Remember, you have once be\xe2\x80\x99n deceived. Her meaning may\r\nbe good; but there\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s young yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeceived? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cShe never promised me at\r\nthat first time, and hence she did not break her promise! If she\r\npromises me, she\xe2\x80\x99ll marry me. Bathsheba is a woman to her word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTroy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at Casterbridge,\r\nsmoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass. A knock was given\r\nat the door, and Pennyways entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoldwood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94Lawyer Long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wadn\xe2\x80\x99 at home. I went there first, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a nuisance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis rather, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was not,\r\nhe should be liable for anything. I shan\xe2\x80\x99t ask any lawyer\xe2\x80\x94not I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not it, exactly. If a man changes his name and so forth,\r\nand takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he\xe2\x80\x99s a cheat,\r\nand that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless a\r\nlammocken vagabond; and that\xe2\x80\x99s a punishable situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha! Well done, Pennyways,\xe2\x80\x9d Troy had laughed, but it was with some\r\nanxiety that he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what I want to know is this, do you think\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s really anything going on between her and Boldwood? Upon my\r\nsoul, I should never have believed it! How she must detest me! Have you\r\nfound out whether she has encouraged him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haen\xe2\x80\x99t been able to learn. There\xe2\x80\x99s a deal of feeling on his side\r\nseemingly, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer for her. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know a word about any\r\nsuch thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was gwine\r\nto the party at his house to-night. This is the first time she has ever\r\ngone there, they say. And they say that she\xe2\x80\x99ve not so much as spoke to\r\nhim since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk believe o\xe2\x80\x99t?\r\nHowever, she\xe2\x80\x99s not fond of him\xe2\x80\x94quite offish and quite careless, I\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure of that.... She\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome woman, Pennyways, is she\r\nnot? Own that you never saw a finer or more splendid creature in your\r\nlife. Upon my honour, when I set eyes upon her that day I wondered what\r\nI could have been made of to be able to leave her by herself so long.\r\nAnd then I was hampered with that bothering show, which I\xe2\x80\x99m free of at\r\nlast, thank the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d He smoked on awhile, and then added, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did\r\nshe look when you passed by yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well fancy; but she looked\r\nwell enough, far\xe2\x80\x99s I know. Just flashed her haughty eyes upon my poor\r\nscram body, and then let them go past me to what was yond, much as if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d been no more than a leafless tree. She had just got off her mare to\r\nlook at the last wring-down of cider for the year; she had been riding,\r\nand so her colours were up and her breath rather quick, so that her\r\nbosom plimmed and fell\xe2\x80\x94plimmed and fell\xe2\x80\x94every time plain to my eye. Ay,\r\nand there were the fellers round her wringing down the cheese and\r\nbustling about and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Ware o\xe2\x80\x99 the pommy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am: \xe2\x80\x99twill spoil yer\r\ngown.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Never mind me,\xe2\x80\x99 says she. Then Gabe brought her some of the new\r\ncider, and she must needs go drinking it through a strawmote, and not\r\nin a nateral way at all. \xe2\x80\x98Liddy,\xe2\x80\x99 says she, \xe2\x80\x98bring indoors a few\r\ngallons, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make some cider-wine.\xe2\x80\x99 Sergeant, I was no more to her\r\nthan a morsel of scroff in the fuel-house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go and find her out at once\xe2\x80\x94O yes, I see that\xe2\x80\x94I must go. Oak is\r\nhead man still, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve. And at Little Weatherbury Farm too. He manages\r\neverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Twill puzzle him to manage her, or any other man of his compass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that. She can\xe2\x80\x99t do without him, and knowing it well\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s pretty independent. And she\xe2\x80\x99ve a few soft corners to her mind,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been able to get into one, the devil\xe2\x80\x99s in\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, baily, she\xe2\x80\x99s a notch above you, and you must own it: a higher\r\nclass of animal\xe2\x80\x94a finer tissue. However, stick to me, and neither this\r\nhaughty goddess, dashing piece of womanhood, Juno-wife of mine (Juno\r\nwas a goddess, you know), nor anybody else shall hurt you. But all this\r\nwants looking into, I perceive. What with one thing and another, I see\r\nthat my work is well cut out for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I look to-night, Liddy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, giving a final\r\nadjustment to her dress before leaving the glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw you look so well before. Yes\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you when you looked\r\nlike it\xe2\x80\x94that night, a year and a half ago, when you came in so\r\nwildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody will think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr.\r\nBoldwood, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least they\xe2\x80\x99ll say so. Can\xe2\x80\x99t my\r\nhair be brushed down a little flatter? I dread going\xe2\x80\x94yet I dread the\r\nrisk of wounding him by staying away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you can\xe2\x80\x99t well be dressed plainer than you are, unless\r\nyou go in sackcloth at once. \xe2\x80\x99Tis your excitement is what makes you\r\nlook so noticeable to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, I feel wretched at one time, and\r\nbuoyant at another. I wish I could have continued quite alone as I have\r\nbeen for the last year or so, with no hopes and no fears, and no\r\npleasure and no grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow just suppose Mr. Boldwood should ask you\xe2\x80\x94only just suppose it\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nrun away with him, what would you do, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy\xe2\x80\x94none of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cMind, I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear\r\njoking on any such matter. Do you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. But knowing what rum things we women be, I just\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94however, I won\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, \xe2\x80\x99twill be for reasons\r\nvery, very different from those you think, or others will believe! Now\r\nget my cloak, for it is time to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go I want to mention what has been\r\npassing in my mind lately\xe2\x80\x94that little arrangement we made about your\r\nshare in the farm I mean. That share is small, too small, considering\r\nhow little I attend to business now, and how much time and thought you\r\ngive to it. Well, since the world is brightening for me, I want to show\r\nmy sense of it by increasing your proportion in the partnership. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake a memorandum of the arrangement which struck me as likely to be\r\nconvenient, for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t time to talk about it now; and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ndiscuss it at our leisure. My intention is ultimately to retire from\r\nthe management altogether, and until you can take all the expenditure\r\nupon your shoulders, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a sleeping partner in the stock. Then, if\r\nI marry her\xe2\x80\x94and I hope\xe2\x80\x94I feel I shall, why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nmay happen. So many upsets may befall \xe2\x80\x99ee. There\xe2\x80\x99s many a slip, as they\r\nsay\xe2\x80\x94and I would advise you\xe2\x80\x94I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon me this once\xe2\x80\x94not to be\r\n_too sure_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, I know. But the feeling I have about increasing your share is\r\non account of what I know of you. Oak, I have learnt a little about\r\nyour secret: your interest in her is more than that of bailiff for an\r\nemployer. But you have behaved like a man, and I, as a sort of\r\nsuccessful rival\xe2\x80\x94successful partly through your goodness of\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94should like definitely to show my sense of your friendship under\r\nwhat must have been a great pain to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary, thank \xe2\x80\x99ee,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, hurriedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI must get\r\nused to such as that; other men have, and so shall I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak then left him. He was uneasy on Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s account, for he saw anew\r\nthat this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man he once\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nAs Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone\xe2\x80\x94ready and dressed to\r\nreceive his company\xe2\x80\x94the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed to\r\npass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity. He looked out of\r\nthe window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the sky, and\r\nthe twilight deepening to darkness.\r\n\r\nThen he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer therein\r\na small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to put it\r\ninto his pocket. But he lingered to open the cover and take a momentary\r\nglance inside. It contained a woman\xe2\x80\x99s finger-ring, set all the way\r\nround with small diamonds, and from its appearance had evidently been\r\nrecently purchased. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dwelt upon its many sparkles a long\r\ntime, though that its material aspect concerned him little was plain\r\nfrom his manner and mien, which were those of a mind following out the\r\npresumed thread of that jewel\xe2\x80\x99s future history.\r\n\r\nThe noise of wheels at the front of the house became audible. Boldwood\r\nclosed the box, stowed it away carefully in his pocket, and went out\r\nupon the landing. The old man who was his indoor factotum came at the\r\nsame moment to the foot of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey be coming, sir\xe2\x80\x94lots of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94a-foot and a-driving!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was coming down this moment. Those wheels I heard\xe2\x80\x94is it Mrs. Troy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis not she yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s face again,\r\nbut it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s name;\r\nand his feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a galloping\r\nmotion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh as he went down the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does this cover me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy to Pennyways. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody would\r\nrecognize me now, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of Noachian cut, with cape\r\nand high collar, the latter being erect and rigid, like a girdling\r\nwall, and nearly reaching to the verge of a travelling cap which was\r\npulled down over his ears.\r\n\r\nPennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up and deliberately\r\ninspected Troy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made up your mind to go then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade up my mind? Yes; of course I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not write to her? \xe2\x80\x99Tis a very queer corner that you have got into,\r\nsergeant. You see all these things will come to light if you go back,\r\nand they won\xe2\x80\x99t sound well at all. Faith, if I was you I\xe2\x80\x99d even bide as\r\nyou be\xe2\x80\x94a single man of the name of Francis. A good wife is good, but\r\nthe best wife is not so good as no wife at all. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s my outspoke\r\nmind, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been called a long-headed feller here and there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, angrily. \xe2\x80\x9cThere she is with plenty of money,\r\nand a house and farm, and horses, and comfort, and here am I living\r\nfrom hand to mouth\xe2\x80\x94a needy adventurer. Besides, it is no use talking\r\nnow; it is too late, and I am glad of it; I\xe2\x80\x99ve been seen and recognized\r\nhere this very afternoon. I should have gone back to her the day after\r\nthe fair, if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for you talking about the law, and rubbish\r\nabout getting a separation; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t put it off any longer. What the\r\ndeuce put it into my head to run away at all, I can\xe2\x80\x99t think! Humbugging\r\nsentiment\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was. But what man on earth was to know that\r\nhis wife would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have known it. She\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough for anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPennyways, mind who you are talking to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sergeant, all I say is this, that if I were you I\xe2\x80\x99d go abroad\r\nagain where I came from\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tisn\xe2\x80\x99t too late to do it now. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stir\r\nup the business and get a bad name for the sake of living with her\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nall that about your play-acting is sure to come out, you know, although\r\nyou think otherwise. My eyes and limbs, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a racket if you go\r\nback just now\xe2\x80\x94in the middle of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s Christmasing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m, yes. I expect I shall not be a very welcome guest if he has her\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, with a slight laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cA sort of Alonzo the\r\nBrave; and when I go in the guests will sit in silence and fear, and\r\nall laughter and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the chamber\r\nburn blue, and the worms\xe2\x80\x94Ugh, horrible!\xe2\x80\x94Ring for some more brandy,\r\nPennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then! Well, what is there\r\nbesides? A stick\xe2\x80\x94I must have a walking-stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for\r\nshould Bathsheba and Troy become reconciled it would be necessary to\r\nregain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her\r\nhusband. \xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman at\r\nbottom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as a saving sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no telling to a\r\ncertainty from a body\xe2\x80\x99s outside. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll do as you like about\r\ngoing, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as you tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let me see what the time is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Troy, after emptying his glass\r\nin one draught as he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf-past six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I shall not hurry\r\nalong the road, and shall be there then before nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\nCONCURRITUR\xe2\x80\x94HOR\xc3\x86 MOMENTO\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the front of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s house a group of men stood in the dark,\r\nwith their faces towards the door, which occasionally opened and closed\r\nfor the passage of some guest or servant, when a golden rod of light\r\nwould stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again, leaving\r\nnothing outside but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid the\r\nevergreens over the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon\xe2\x80\x94so the boy said,\xe2\x80\x9d one of\r\nthem remarked in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I for one believe it. His body was\r\nnever found, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a strange story,\xe2\x80\x9d said the next. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may depend upon\xe2\x80\x99t that she\r\nknows nothing about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that she shall,\xe2\x80\x9d said another man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s alive and here in the neighbourhood, he means mischief,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe first. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor young thing: I do pity her, if \xe2\x80\x99tis true. He\xe2\x80\x99ll drag\r\nher to the dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no; he\xe2\x80\x99ll settle down quiet enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said one disposed to take a\r\nmore hopeful view of the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with\r\nthe man! She is so self-willed and independent too, that one is more\r\nminded to say it serves her right than pity her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with \xe2\x80\x99ee there. She was no otherwise than a girl\r\nmind, and how could she tell what the man was made of? If \xe2\x80\x99tis really\r\ntrue, \xe2\x80\x99tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to\r\nhae.\xe2\x80\x94Hullo, who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d This was to some footsteps that were heard\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Smallbury,\xe2\x80\x9d said a dim figure in the shades, coming up and\r\njoining them. \xe2\x80\x9cDark as a hedge, to-night, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I all but missed\r\nthe plank over the river ath\xe2\x80\x99art there in the bottom\xe2\x80\x94never did such a\r\nthing before in my life. Be ye any of Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s workfolk?\xe2\x80\x9d He peered\r\ninto their faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94all o\xe2\x80\x99 us. We met here a few minutes ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I hear now\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Samway: thought I knowed the voice, too.\r\nGoing in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresently. But I say, William,\xe2\x80\x9d Samway whispered, \xe2\x80\x9chave ye heard this\r\nstrange tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x94that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean, souls?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSmallbury, also lowering his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy: in Casterbridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have. Laban Tall named a hint of it to me but now\xe2\x80\x94but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink it. Hark, here Laban comes himself, \xe2\x80\x99a b\xe2\x80\x99lieve.\xe2\x80\x9d A footstep drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaban?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, \xe2\x80\x99tis I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave ye heard any more about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall, joining the group. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m inclined to think we\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter keep quiet. If so be \xe2\x80\x99tis not true, \xe2\x80\x99twill flurry her, and do\r\nher much harm to repeat it; and if so be \xe2\x80\x99tis true, \xe2\x80\x99twill do no good\r\nto forestall her time o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble. God send that it mid be a lie, for\r\nthough Henery Fray and some of \xe2\x80\x99em do speak against her, she\xe2\x80\x99s never\r\nbeen anything but fair to me. She\xe2\x80\x99s hot and hasty, but she\xe2\x80\x99s a brave\r\ngirl who\xe2\x80\x99ll never tell a lie however much the truth may harm her, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve no cause to wish her evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never do tell women\xe2\x80\x99s little lies, that\xe2\x80\x99s true; and \xe2\x80\x99tis a thing\r\nthat can be said of very few. Ay, all the harm she thinks she says to\r\nyer face: there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing underhand wi\xe2\x80\x99 her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stood silent then, every man busied with his own thoughts, during\r\nwhich interval sounds of merriment could be heard within. Then the\r\nfront door again opened, the rays streamed out, the well-known form of\r\nBoldwood was seen in the rectangular area of light, the door closed,\r\nand Boldwood walked slowly down the path.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis master,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the men whispered, as he neared them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter stand quiet\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99ll go in again directly. He would think it\r\nunseemly o\xe2\x80\x99 us to be loitering here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood came on, and passed by the men without seeing them, they being\r\nunder the bushes on the grass. He paused, leant over the gate, and\r\nbreathed a long breath. They heard low words come from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to God she\xe2\x80\x99ll come, or this night will be nothing but misery to\r\nme! Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense like\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it. Boldwood\r\nremained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again just\r\naudible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be\r\ndistinguished coming down the hill. They drew nearer, and ceased at the\r\ngate. Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it; and the light\r\nshone upon Bathsheba coming up the path.\r\n\r\nBoldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her\r\nlight laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house; and\r\nthe door closed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious heaven, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was like that with him!\xe2\x80\x9d said one of\r\nthe men. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that fancy of his was over long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know much of master, if you thought that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he should know we heard what \xe2\x80\x99a said for the world,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nremarked a third.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had told of the report at once,\xe2\x80\x9d the first uneasily\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cMore harm may come of this than we know of. Poor Mr.\r\nBoldwood, it will be hard upon en. I wish Troy was in\xe2\x80\x94Well, God forgive\r\nme for such a wish! A scoundrel to play a poor wife such tricks.\r\nNothing has prospered in Weatherbury since he came here. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nno heart to go in. Let\xe2\x80\x99s look into Warren\xe2\x80\x99s for a few minutes first,\r\nshall us, neighbours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSamway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren\xe2\x80\x99s, and went out at\r\nthe gate, the remaining ones entering the house. The three soon drew\r\nnear the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and not\r\nby way of the street. The pane of glass was illuminated as usual.\r\nSmallbury was a little in advance of the rest when, pausing, he turned\r\nsuddenly to his companions and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHist! See there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the\r\nivied wall as usual, but upon some object close to the glass. It was a\r\nhuman face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s come closer,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Samway; and they approached on tiptoe.\r\nThere was no disbelieving the report any longer. Troy\xe2\x80\x99s face was almost\r\nclose to the pane, and he was looking in. Not only was he looking in,\r\nbut he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation which was in\r\nprogress in the malt-house, the voices of the interlocutors being those\r\nof Oak and the maltster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spree is all in her honour, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x94hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough he made believe \xe2\x80\x99tis only keeping up o\xe2\x80\x99 Christmas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh \xe2\x80\x99tis true enough, faith. I cannot understand Farmer Boldwood being\r\nsuch a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after this woman in\r\nthe way \xe2\x80\x99a do, and she not care a bit about en.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe men, after recognizing Troy\xe2\x80\x99s features, withdrew across the orchard\r\nas quietly as they had come. The air was big with Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes\r\nto-night: every word everywhere concerned her. When they were quite out\r\nof earshot all by one instinct paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gave me quite a turn\xe2\x80\x94his face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall, breathing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it did me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see that \xe2\x80\x99tis any business of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d Smallbury murmured\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is! \xe2\x80\x99Tis a thing which is everybody\xe2\x80\x99s business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe know very well that master\xe2\x80\x99s on a wrong tack, and that she\xe2\x80\x99s quite\r\nin the dark, and we should let \xe2\x80\x99em know at once. Laban, you know her\r\nbest\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d better go and ask to speak to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bain\xe2\x80\x99t fit for any such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laban, nervously. \xe2\x80\x9cI should\r\nthink William ought to do it if anybody. He\xe2\x80\x99s oldest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have nothing to do with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smallbury. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis a ticklish\r\nbusiness altogether. Why, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to her himself in a few minutes,\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he will. Come, Laban.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, if I must I must, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Tall reluctantly answered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust ask to see master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; I shan\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Mr. Boldwood. If I tell anybody, \xe2\x80\x99twill be\r\nmistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway.\r\n\r\nLaban then went to the door. When he opened it the hum of bustle rolled\r\nout as a wave upon a still strand\xe2\x80\x94the assemblage being immediately\r\ninside the hall\xe2\x80\x94and was deadened to a murmur as he closed it again.\r\nEach man waited intently, and looked around at the dark tree tops\r\ngently rocking against the sky and occasionally shivering in a slight\r\nwind, as if he took interest in the scene, which neither did. One of\r\nthem began walking up and down, and then came to where he started from\r\nand stopped again, with a sense that walking was a thing not worth\r\ndoing now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSmallbury, breaking the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she won\xe2\x80\x99t come and speak to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened. Tall appeared, and joined them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t like to ask for her after all,\xe2\x80\x9d Laban faltered out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nwere all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the party.\r\nSomehow the fun seems to hang fire, though everything\xe2\x80\x99s there that a\r\nheart can desire, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for my soul interfere and throw damp\r\nupon it\xe2\x80\x94if \xe2\x80\x99twas to save my life, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we had better all go in together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway, gloomily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the men entered the hall, which was the room selected and arranged\r\nfor the gathering because of its size. The younger men and maids were\r\nat last just beginning to dance. Bathsheba had been perplexed how to\r\nact, for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself, and the\r\nweight of stateliness sat heavy upon her. Sometimes she thought she\r\nought not to have come under any circumstances; then she considered\r\nwhat cold unkindness that would have been, and finally resolved upon\r\nthe middle course of staying for about an hour only, and gliding off\r\nunobserved, having from the first made up her mind that she could on no\r\naccount dance, sing, or take any active part in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nHer allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on,\r\nBathsheba told Liddy not to hurry herself, and went to the small\r\nparlour to prepare for departure, which, like the hall, was decorated\r\nwith holly and ivy, and well lighted up.\r\n\r\nNobody was in the room, but she had hardly been there a moment when the\r\nmaster of the house entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy\xe2\x80\x94you are not going?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve hardly begun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, I should like to go now.\xe2\x80\x9d Her manner was restive,\r\nfor she remembered her promise, and imagined what he was about to say.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as it is not late,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI can walk home, and leave my man\r\nand Liddy to come when they choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBoldwood. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know perhaps what I long to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba silently looked on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do give it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s evasion! Why, the promise. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to intrude upon\r\nyou at all, or to let it become known to anybody. But do give your\r\nword! A mere business compact, you know, between two people who are\r\nbeyond the influence of passion.\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood knew how false this picture\r\nwas as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the only tone in\r\nwhich she would allow him to approach her. \xe2\x80\x9cA promise to marry me at\r\nthe end of five years and three-quarters. You owe it to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel that I do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba; \xe2\x80\x9cthat is, if you demand it. But I\r\nam a changed woman\xe2\x80\x94an unhappy woman\xe2\x80\x94and not\xe2\x80\x94not\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still a very beautiful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood. Honesty and pure\r\nconviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception that\r\nit might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her.\r\n\r\nHowever, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless\r\nmurmur which was in itself a proof of her words: \xe2\x80\x9cI have no feeling in\r\nthe matter at all. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all know what is right to do in my\r\ndifficult position, and I have nobody to advise me. But I give my\r\npromise, if I must. I give it as the rendering of a debt,\r\nconditionally, of course, on my being a widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll marry me between five and six years hence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t press me too hard. I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry nobody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut surely you will name the time, or there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the promise\r\nat all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, pray let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her bosom beginning to\r\nrise. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be that\r\nseems to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the\r\ncommandments. There is considerable doubt of his death, and then it is\r\ndreadful; let me ask a solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed; a\r\nblissful loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage\xe2\x80\x94O Bathsheba,\r\nsay them!\xe2\x80\x9d he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of\r\nmere friendship any longer. \xe2\x80\x9cPromise yourself to me; I deserve it,\r\nindeed I do, for I have loved you more than anybody in the world! And\r\nif I said hasty words and showed uncalled-for heat of manner towards\r\nyou, believe me, dear, I did not mean to distress you; I was in agony,\r\nBathsheba, and I did not know what I said. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let a dog\r\nsuffer what I have suffered, could you but know it! Sometimes I shrink\r\nfrom your knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am\r\ndistressed that all of it you never will know. Be gracious, and give up\r\na little to me, when I would give up my life for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trimmings of her dress, as they quivered against the light, showed\r\nhow agitated she was, and at last she burst out crying. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94press me\xe2\x80\x94about anything more\xe2\x80\x94if I say in five or six years?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsobbed, when she had power to frame the words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll marry you in six years from this\r\nday, if we both live,\xe2\x80\x9d she said solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99ll take this as a token from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her\r\nhands in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Oh I cannot wear a ring!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, on seeing what he\r\nheld; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a soul know that it\xe2\x80\x99s an engagement!\r\nPerhaps it is improper? Besides, we are not engaged in the usual sense,\r\nare we? Don\xe2\x80\x99t insist, Mr. Boldwood\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d In her trouble at not being\r\nable to get her hand away from him at once, she stamped passionately on\r\nthe floor with one foot, and tears crowded to her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means simply a pledge\xe2\x80\x94no sentiment\xe2\x80\x94the seal of a practical\r\ncompact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in his\r\nfirm grasp. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, now!\xe2\x80\x9d And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot wear it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, weeping as if her heart would break. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nfrighten me, almost. So wild a scheme! Please let me go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her face in her handkerchief,\r\nthough Boldwood kept her hand yet. At length she said, in a sort of\r\nhopeless whisper\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly. Now\r\nloosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six\r\nyears, with a wedding at the end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, fairly\r\nbeaten into non-resistance.\r\n\r\nBoldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nhappy now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently\r\ncomposed sent one of the maids to her. Bathsheba cloaked the effects of\r\nthe late scene as she best could, followed the girl, and in a few\r\nmoments came downstairs with her hat and cloak on, ready to go. To get\r\nto the door it was necessary to pass through the hall, and before doing\r\nso she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended into one\r\ncorner, to take a last look at the gathering.\r\n\r\nThere was no music or dancing in progress just now. At the lower end,\r\nwhich had been arranged for the work-folk specially, a group conversed\r\nin whispers, and with clouded looks. Boldwood was standing by the\r\nfireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising from her\r\npromise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment to have\r\nobserved their peculiar manner, and their looks askance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you are in doubt about, men?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nOne of them turned and replied uneasily: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was something Laban heard\r\nof, that\xe2\x80\x99s all, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews? Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the farmer,\r\ngaily. \xe2\x80\x9cTell it to us, Tall. One would think from your looks and\r\nmysterious ways that it was something very dreadful indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, sir, nobody is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish somebody was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, Samway?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Boldwood, somewhat sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nhave anything to say, speak out; if not, get up another dance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy has come downstairs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samway to Tall. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to\r\ntell her, you had better do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what they mean?\xe2\x80\x9d the farmer asked Bathsheba, across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t in the least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba.\r\n\r\nThere was a smart rapping at the door. One of the men opened it\r\ninstantly, and went outside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy is wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, on returning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell them to send.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a stranger, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man by the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stranger?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Boldwood.\r\n\r\nThe message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to his eyes as we have seen\r\nhim, stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\nThere was an unearthly silence, all looking towards the newcomer. Those\r\nwho had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized him\r\ninstantly; those who did not were perplexed. Nobody noted Bathsheba.\r\nShe was leaning on the stairs. Her brow had heavily contracted; her\r\nwhole face was pallid, her lips apart, her eyes rigidly staring at\r\ntheir visitor.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in,\r\ncome in!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9cand drain a Christmas beaker with\r\nus, stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTroy next advanced into the middle of the room, took off his cap,\r\nturned down his coat-collar, and looked Boldwood in the face. Even then\r\nBoldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s persistent\r\nirony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his bliss,\r\nscourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do these\r\nthings a second time. Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh: Boldwood\r\nrecognized him now.\r\n\r\nTroy turned to Bathsheba. The poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s wretchedness at this time was\r\nbeyond all fancy or narration. She had sunk down on the lowest stair;\r\nand there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes fixed\r\nvacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all a\r\nterrible illusion.\r\n\r\nThen Troy spoke. \xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba, I come here for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome home with me: come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise. Troy went across\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, madam, do you hear what I say?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, peremptorily.\r\n\r\nA strange voice came from the fireplace\xe2\x80\x94a voice sounding far off and\r\nconfined, as if from a dungeon. Hardly a soul in the assembly\r\nrecognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood. Sudden despair had\r\ntransformed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba, go with your husband!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she did not move. The truth was that Bathsheba was beyond\r\nthe pale of activity\xe2\x80\x94and yet not in a swoon. She was in a state of\r\nmental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally deprived of\r\nlight at the same time no obscuration was apparent from without.\r\n\r\nTroy stretched out his hand to pull her towards him, when she quickly\r\nshrank back. This visible dread of him seemed to irritate Troy, and he\r\nseized her arm and pulled it sharply. Whether his grasp pinched her, or\r\nwhether his mere touch was the cause, was never known, but at the\r\nmoment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a quick, low scream.\r\n\r\nThe scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by\r\nsudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied them\r\nall. The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place was\r\nfilled with grey smoke.\r\n\r\nIn bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood. At his back, as\r\nstood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in farmhouses,\r\nconstructed to hold two guns. When Bathsheba had cried out in her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s grasp, Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s face of gnashing despair had changed. The\r\nveins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in his eye. He had\r\nturned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it, and at once\r\ndischarged it at Troy.\r\n\r\nTroy fell. The distance apart of the two men was so small that the\r\ncharge of shot did not spread in the least, but passed like a bullet\r\ninto his body. He uttered a long guttural sigh\xe2\x80\x94there was a\r\ncontraction\xe2\x80\x94an extension\xe2\x80\x94then his muscles relaxed, and he lay still.\r\n\r\nBoldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the\r\ngun. It was double-barrelled, and he had, meanwhile, in some way\r\nfastened his hand-kerchief to the trigger, and with his foot on the\r\nother end was in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself.\r\nSamway his man was the first to see this, and in the midst of the\r\ngeneral horror darted up to him. Boldwood had already twitched the\r\nhandkerchief, and the gun exploded a second time, sending its contents,\r\nby a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which crossed the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it makes no difference!\xe2\x80\x9d Boldwood gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is another way\r\nfor me to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed\r\nher hand. He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the\r\ndarkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\nAFTER THE SHOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nBoldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of\r\nCasterbridge. Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury Hill,\r\nalong the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and between eleven\r\nand twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock crossed the Moor into the town. The streets were\r\nnearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only lighted up rows of\r\ngrey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving upon which his step\r\nechoed as his passed along. He turned to the right, and halted before\r\nan archway of heavy stonework, which was closed by an iron studded pair\r\nof doors. This was the entrance to the gaol, and over it a lamp was\r\nfixed, the light enabling the wretched traveller to find a bell-pull.\r\n\r\nThe small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared. Boldwood\r\nstepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a delay,\r\nanother man came. Boldwood entered, and the door was closed behind him,\r\nand he walked the world no more.\r\n\r\nLong before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and the\r\nwild deed which had terminated Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s merrymaking became known to\r\nall. Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to hear of the\r\ncatastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was about five minutes\r\nafter Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s exit, the scene was terrible. All the female guests\r\nwere huddled aghast against the walls like sheep in a storm, and the\r\nmen were bewildered as to what to do. As for Bathsheba, she had\r\nchanged. She was sitting on the floor beside the body of Troy, his head\r\npillowed in her lap, where she had herself lifted it. With one hand she\r\nheld her handkerchief to his breast and covered the wound, though\r\nscarcely a single drop of blood had flowed, and with the other she\r\ntightly clasped one of his. The household convulsion had made her\r\nherself again. The temporary coma had ceased, and activity had come\r\nwith the necessity for it. Deeds of endurance, which seem ordinary in\r\nphilosophy, are rare in conduct, and Bathsheba was astonishing all\r\naround her now, for her philosophy was her conduct, and she seldom\r\nthought practicable what she did not practise. She was of the stuff of\r\nwhich great men\xe2\x80\x99s mothers are made. She was indispensable to high\r\ngeneration, hated at tea parties, feared in shops, and loved at crises.\r\nTroy recumbent in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s lap formed now the sole spectacle in the\r\nmiddle of the spacious room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, automatically, when he entered, turning up a face\r\nof which only the well-known lines remained to tell him it was hers,\r\nall else in the picture having faded quite. \xe2\x80\x9cRide to Casterbridge\r\ninstantly for a surgeon. It is, I believe, useless, but go. Mr.\r\nBoldwood has shot my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer statement of the fact in such quiet and simple words came with more\r\nforce than a tragic declamation, and had somewhat the effect of setting\r\nthe distorted images in each mind present into proper focus. Oak,\r\nalmost before he had comprehended anything beyond the briefest abstract\r\nof the event, hurried out of the room, saddled a horse and rode away.\r\nNot till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to him that he\r\nwould have done better by sending some other man on this errand,\r\nremaining himself in the house. What had become of Boldwood? He should\r\nhave been looked after. Was he mad\xe2\x80\x94had there been a quarrel? Then how\r\nhad Troy got there? Where had he come from? How did this remarkable\r\nreappearance effect itself when he was supposed by many to be at the\r\nbottom of the sea? Oak had in some slight measure been prepared for the\r\npresence of Troy by hearing a rumour of his return just before entering\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s house; but before he had weighed that information, this\r\nfatal event had been superimposed. However, it was too late now to\r\nthink of sending another messenger, and he rode on, in the excitement\r\nof these self-inquiries not discerning, when about three miles from\r\nCasterbridge, a square-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark\r\nhedge in the same direction as his own.\r\n\r\nThe miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental to\r\nthe lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed the\r\narrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours passed\r\nbetween the time at which the shot was fired and that of his entering\r\nthe house. Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge through having\r\nto give notice to the authorities of what had happened; and he then\r\nfound that Boldwood had also entered the town, and delivered himself\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the surgeon, having hastened into the hall at\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s, found it in darkness and quite deserted. He went on to the\r\nback of the house, where he discovered in the kitchen an old man, of\r\nwhom he made inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s had him took away to her own house, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said his informant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has?\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Troy. \xe2\x80\x99A was quite dead, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was astonishing information. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had no right to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will have to be an inquest, and she should have\r\nwaited to know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; it was hinted to her that she had better wait till the law\r\nwas known. But she said law was nothing to her, and she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nher dear husband\xe2\x80\x99s corpse bide neglected for folks to stare at for all\r\nthe crowners in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Aldritch drove at once back again up the hill to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s. The\r\nfirst person he met was poor Liddy, who seemed literally to have\r\ndwindled smaller in these few latter hours. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been done?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy, with suspended breath. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mistress\r\nhas done it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpstairs with him, sir. When he was brought home and taken upstairs,\r\nshe said she wanted no further help from the men. And then she called\r\nme, and made me fill the bath, and after that told me I had better go\r\nand lie down because I looked so ill. Then she locked herself into the\r\nroom alone with him, and would not let a nurse come in, or anybody at\r\nall. But I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d wait in the next room in case she should want\r\nme. I heard her moving about inside for more than an hour, but she only\r\ncame out once, and that was for more candles, because hers had burnt\r\ndown into the socket. She said we were to let her know when you or Mr.\r\nThirdly came, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak entered with the parson at this moment, and they all went upstairs\r\ntogether, preceded by Liddy Smallbury. Everything was silent as the\r\ngrave when they paused on the landing. Liddy knocked, and Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndress was heard rustling across the room: the key turned in the lock,\r\nand she opened the door. Her looks were calm and nearly rigid, like a\r\nslightly animated bust of Melpomene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Aldritch, you have come at last,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured from her lips\r\nmerely, and threw back the door. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, and Mr. Thirdly. Well, all is\r\ndone, and anybody in the world may see him now.\xe2\x80\x9d She then passed by\r\nhim, crossed the landing, and entered another room.\r\n\r\nLooking into the chamber of death she had vacated they saw by the light\r\nof the candles which were on the drawers a tall straight shape lying at\r\nthe further end of the bedroom, wrapped in white. Everything around was\r\nquite orderly. The doctor went in, and after a few minutes returned to\r\nthe landing again, where Oak and the parson still waited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all done, indeed, as she says,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Aldritch, in a\r\nsubdued voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe body has been undressed and properly laid out in\r\ngrave clothes. Gracious Heaven\xe2\x80\x94this mere girl! She must have the nerve\r\nof a stoic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe heart of a wife merely,\xe2\x80\x9d floated in a whisper about the ears of\r\nthe three, and turning they saw Bathsheba in the midst of them. Then,\r\nas if at that instant to prove that her fortitude had been more of will\r\nthan of spontaneity, she silently sank down between them and was a\r\nshapeless heap of drapery on the floor. The simple consciousness that\r\nsuperhuman strain was no longer required had at once put a period to\r\nher power to continue it.\r\n\r\nThey took her away into a further room, and the medical attendance\r\nwhich had been useless in Troy\xe2\x80\x99s case was invaluable in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwho fell into a series of fainting-fits that had a serious aspect for a\r\ntime. The sufferer was got to bed, and Oak, finding from the bulletins\r\nthat nothing really dreadful was to be apprehended on her score, left\r\nthe house. Liddy kept watch in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s chamber, where she heard her\r\nmistress, moaning in whispers through the dull slow hours of that\r\nwretched night: \xe2\x80\x9cOh it is my fault\xe2\x80\x94how can I live! O Heaven, how can I\r\nlive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\nTHE MARCH FOLLOWING\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without\r\nsunshine, frost, or dew. On Yalbury Hill, about midway between\r\nWeatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over the\r\ncrest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of the\r\ngreater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly\r\ndirection. The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of\r\njavelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one\r\nof which contained the high sheriff. With the idlers, many of whom had\r\nmounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several\r\nWeatherbury men and boys\xe2\x80\x94among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain Ball.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected\r\nquarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the\r\ntwo judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the\r\ntop. The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the\r\nbig-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles\r\nand javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the\r\nWeatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off\r\nreturned home again to their work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, as\r\nthey walked. \xe2\x80\x9cDid ye notice my lord judge\xe2\x80\x99s face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poorgrass. \xe2\x80\x9cI looked hard at en, as if I would read his\r\nvery soul; and there was mercy in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94or to speak with the exact\r\ntruth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was towards\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope for the best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, \xe2\x80\x9cthough bad that must be.\r\nHowever, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t go to the trial, and I\xe2\x80\x99d advise the rest of ye that\r\nbain\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to bide away. \xe2\x80\x99Twill disturb his mind more than anything\r\nto see us there staring at him as if he were a show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing I said this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joseph, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Justice is\r\ncome to weigh him in the balances,\xe2\x80\x99 I said in my reflectious way, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s found wanting, so be it unto him,\xe2\x80\x99 and a bystander said \xe2\x80\x98Hear,\r\nhear! A man who can talk like that ought to be heard.\xe2\x80\x99 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\ndwelling upon it, for my few words are my few words, and not much;\r\nthough the speech of some men is rumoured abroad as though by nature\r\nformed for such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x99tis, Joseph. And now, neighbours, as I said, every man bide at\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adhered to; and all waited anxiously for the news\r\nnext day. Their suspense was diverted, however, by a discovery which\r\nwas made in the afternoon, throwing more light on Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nand condition than any details which had preceded it.\r\n\r\nThat he had been from the time of Greenhill Fair until the fatal\r\nChristmas Eve in excited and unusual moods was known to those who had\r\nbeen intimate with him; but nobody imagined that there had shown in him\r\nunequivocal symptoms of the mental derangement which Bathsheba and Oak,\r\nalone of all others and at different times, had momentarily suspected.\r\nIn a locked closet was now discovered an extraordinary collection of\r\narticles. There were several sets of ladies\xe2\x80\x99 dresses in the piece, of\r\nsundry expensive materials; silks and satins, poplins and velvets, all\r\nof colours which from Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s style of dress might have been judged\r\nto be her favourites. There were two muffs, sable and ermine. Above all\r\nthere was a case of jewellery, containing four heavy gold bracelets and\r\nseveral lockets and rings, all of fine quality and manufacture. These\r\nthings had been bought in Bath and other towns from time to time, and\r\nbrought home by stealth. They were all carefully packed in paper, and\r\neach package was labelled \xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba Boldwood,\xe2\x80\x9d a date being subjoined\r\nsix years in advance in every instance.\r\n\r\nThese somewhat pathetic evidences of a mind crazed with care and love\r\nwere the subject of discourse in Warren\xe2\x80\x99s malt-house when Oak entered\r\nfrom Casterbridge with tidings of the sentence. He came in the\r\nafternoon, and his face, as the kiln glow shone upon it, told the tale\r\nsufficiently well. Boldwood, as every one supposed he would do, had\r\npleaded guilty, and had been sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that Boldwood had not been morally responsible for his\r\nlater acts now became general. Facts elicited previous to the trial had\r\npointed strongly in the same direction, but they had not been of\r\nsufficient weight to lead to an order for an examination into the state\r\nof Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It was astonishing, now that a presumption of\r\ninsanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were remembered\r\nto which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford the only\r\nexplanation\xe2\x80\x94among others, the unprecedented neglect of his corn stacks\r\nin the previous summer.\r\n\r\nA petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing the\r\ncircumstances which appeared to justify a request for a reconsideration\r\nof the sentence. It was not \xe2\x80\x9cnumerously signed\xe2\x80\x9d by the inhabitants of\r\nCasterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for Boldwood had never made\r\nmany friends over the counter. The shops thought it very natural that a\r\nman who, by importing direct from the producer, had daringly set aside\r\nthe first great principle of provincial existence, namely that God made\r\ncountry villages to supply customers to county towns, should have\r\nconfused ideas about the Decalogue. The prompters were a few merciful\r\nmen who had perhaps too feelingly considered the facts latterly\r\nunearthed, and the result was that evidence was taken which it was\r\nhoped might remove the crime in a moral point of view, out of the\r\ncategory of wilful murder, and lead it to be regarded as a sheer\r\noutcome of madness.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the petition was waited for in Weatherbury with\r\nsolicitous interest. The execution had been fixed for eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock on\r\na Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was passed, and\r\nup to Friday afternoon no answer had been received. At that time\r\nGabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been to wish\r\nBoldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the town. When\r\npast the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting his bowed head he\r\nlooked back for a moment. Over the chimneys he could see the upper part\r\nof the gaol entrance, rich and glowing in the afternoon sun, and some\r\nmoving figures were there. They were carpenters lifting a post into a\r\nvertical position within the parapet. He withdrew his eyes quickly, and\r\nhastened on.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when he reached home, and half the village was out to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo tidings,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said, wearily. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid there\xe2\x80\x99s no hope.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been with him more than two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo ye think he _really_ was out of his mind when he did it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nSmallbury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly say that I do,\xe2\x80\x9d Oak replied. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, that we can\r\ntalk of another time. Has there been any change in mistress this\r\nafternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she downstairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And getting on so nicely as she was too. She\xe2\x80\x99s but very little\r\nbetter now again than she was at Christmas. She keeps on asking if you\r\nbe come, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s news, till one\xe2\x80\x99s wearied out wi\xe2\x80\x99 answering her.\r\nShall I go and say you\xe2\x80\x99ve come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a chance yet; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in town any\r\nlonger\xe2\x80\x94after seeing him too. So Laban\xe2\x80\x94Laban is here, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing\r\nto-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home\r\nabout twelve. If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they say\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no chance at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do so hope his life will be spared,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is not,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll go out of her mind too. Poor thing; her sufferings have been\r\ndreadful; she deserves anybody\xe2\x80\x99s pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she altered much?\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liddy. \xe2\x80\x9cHer eyes are so miserable that she\xe2\x80\x99s not the same\r\nwoman. Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she\xe2\x80\x99s this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaban departed as directed, and at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock that night several of\r\nthe villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited his\r\narrival\xe2\x80\x94among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s men.\r\nGabriel\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even though\r\nin his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had been\r\nqualities in the farmer which Oak loved. At last, when they all were\r\nweary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFirst dead, as if on turf it trode,\r\nThen, clattering on the village road\r\nIn other pace than forth he yode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon know now, one way or other.\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, and they all\r\nstepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the\r\nroad, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Laban?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis come. He\xe2\x80\x99s not to die. \xe2\x80\x99Tis confinement during Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, with a swelling heart. \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s above the devil\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\nBEAUTY IN LONELINESS\xe2\x80\x94AFTER ALL\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba revived with the spring. The utter prostration that had\r\nfollowed the low fever from which she had suffered diminished\r\nperceptibly when all uncertainty upon every subject had come to an end.\r\n\r\nBut she remained alone now for the greater part of her time, and stayed\r\nin the house, or at furthest went into the garden. She shunned every\r\none, even Liddy, and could be brought to make no confidences, and to\r\nask for no sympathy.\r\n\r\nAs the summer drew on she passed more of her time in the open air, and\r\nbegan to examine into farming matters from sheer necessity, though she\r\nnever rode out or personally superintended as at former times. One\r\nFriday evening in August she walked a little way along the road and\r\nentered the village for the first time since the sombre event of the\r\npreceding Christmas. None of the old colour had as yet come to her\r\ncheek, and its absolute paleness was heightened by the jet black of her\r\ngown, till it appeared preternatural. When she reached a little shop at\r\nthe other end of the place, which stood nearly opposite to the\r\nchurchyard, Bathsheba heard singing inside the church, and she knew\r\nthat the singers were practising. She crossed the road, opened the\r\ngate, and entered the graveyard, the high sills of the church windows\r\neffectually screening her from the eyes of those gathered within. Her\r\nstealthy walk was to the nook wherein Troy had worked at planting\r\nflowers upon Fanny Robin\xe2\x80\x99s grave, and she came to the marble tombstone.\r\n\r\nA motion of satisfaction enlivened her face as she read the complete\r\ninscription. First came the words of Troy himself:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nErected by Francis Troy\r\nIn Beloved Memory of\r\nFanny Robin\r\nWho died October 9, 18\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nAged 20 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderneath this was now inscribed in new letters:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIn the Same Grave lie\r\nThe Remains of the aforesaid\r\nFrancis Troy,\r\nWho died December 24th, 18\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nAged 26 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst she stood and read and meditated the tones of the organ began\r\nagain in the church, and she went with the same light step round to the\r\nporch and listened. The door was closed, and the choir was learning a\r\nnew hymn. Bathsheba was stirred by emotions which latterly she had\r\nassumed to be altogether dead within her. The little attenuated voices\r\nof the children brought to her ear in distinct utterance the words they\r\nsang without thought or comprehension\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nLead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,\r\nLead Thou me on.\r\n\r\n\r\nBathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s feeling was always to some extent dependent upon her whim,\r\nas is the case with many other women. Something big came into her\r\nthroat and an uprising to her eyes\xe2\x80\x94and she thought that she would allow\r\nthe imminent tears to flow if they wished. They did flow and\r\nplenteously, and one fell upon the stone bench beside her. Once that\r\nshe had begun to cry for she hardly knew what, she could not leave off\r\nfor crowding thoughts she knew too well. She would have given anything\r\nin the world to be, as those children were, unconcerned at the meaning\r\nof their words, because too innocent to feel the necessity for any such\r\nexpression. All the impassioned scenes of her brief experience seemed\r\nto revive with added emotion at that moment, and those scenes which had\r\nbeen without emotion during enactment had emotion then. Yet grief came\r\nto her rather as a luxury than as the scourge of former times.\r\n\r\nOwing to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s face being buried in her hands she did not notice\r\na form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing her, first\r\nmoved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her. Bathsheba did not\r\nraise her head for some time, and when she looked round her face was\r\nwet, and her eyes drowned and dim. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she,\r\ndisconcerted, \xe2\x80\x9chow long have you been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few minutes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba; and there came from within the\r\nchurch as from a prompter\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,\r\nPride ruled my will: remember not past years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of the bass singers, you know. I have\r\nsung bass for several months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed: I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich I have loved long since, and lost awhile,\r\n\r\n\r\nsang the children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me drive you away, mistress. I think I won\xe2\x80\x99t go in\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t drive me away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they stood in a state of some embarrassment, Bathsheba trying to\r\nwipe her dreadfully drenched and inflamed face without his noticing\r\nher. At length Oak said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen you\xe2\x80\x94I mean spoken to you\xe2\x80\x94since\r\never so long, have I?\xe2\x80\x9d But he feared to bring distressing memories\r\nback, and interrupted himself with: \xe2\x80\x9cWere you going into church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI came to see the tombstone privately\xe2\x80\x94to see if they\r\nhad cut the inscription as I wished. Mr. Oak, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind speaking\r\nto me, if you wish to, on the matter which is in both our minds at this\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have they done it as you wished?\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Come and see it, if you have not already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo together they went and read the tomb. \xe2\x80\x9cEight months ago!\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel\r\nmurmured when he saw the date. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like yesterday to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to me as if it were years ago\xe2\x80\x94long years, and I had been dead\r\nbetween. And now I am going home, Mr. Oak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak walked after her. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to name a small matter to you as soon\r\nas I could,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with hesitation. \xe2\x80\x9cMerely about business, and I\r\nthink I may just mention it now, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll allow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that I may soon have to give up the management of your farm,\r\nMrs. Troy. The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England\xe2\x80\x94not yet, you\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94next spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving England!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought it best,\xe2\x80\x9d Oak stammered out. \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia is the\r\nspot I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in my mind to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s farm on your own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had the refusal o\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\x99tis true; but nothing is settled yet, and\r\nI have reasons for giving up. I shall finish out my year there as\r\nmanager for the trustees, but no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall I do without you? Oh, Gabriel, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought\r\nto go away. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been with me so long\xe2\x80\x94through bright times and dark\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94such old friends as we are\xe2\x80\x94that it seems unkind almost. I had\r\nfancied that if you leased the other farm as master, you might still\r\ngive a helping look across at mine. And now going away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet now that I am more helpless than ever you go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the ill fortune o\xe2\x80\x99 it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, in a distressed\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is because of that very helplessness that I feel bound to\r\ngo. Good afternoon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, in evident anxiety to get\r\naway, and at once went out of the churchyard by a path she could follow\r\non no pretence whatever.\r\n\r\nBathsheba went home, her mind occupied with a new trouble, which being\r\nrather harassing than deadly was calculated to do good by diverting her\r\nfrom the chronic gloom of her life. She was set thinking a great deal\r\nabout Oak and of his wish to shun her; and there occurred to Bathsheba\r\nseveral incidents of her latter intercourse with him, which, trivial\r\nwhen singly viewed, amounted together to a perceptible disinclination\r\nfor her society. It broke upon her at length as a great pain that her\r\nlast old disciple was about to forsake her and flee. He who had\r\nbelieved in her and argued on her side when all the rest of the world\r\nwas against her, had at last like the others become weary and\r\nneglectful of the old cause, and was leaving her to fight her battles\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThree weeks went on, and more evidence of his want of interest in her\r\nwas forthcoming. She noticed that instead of entering the small parlour\r\nor office where the farm accounts were kept, and waiting, or leaving a\r\nmemorandum as he had hitherto done during her seclusion, Oak never came\r\nat all when she was likely to be there, only entering at unseasonable\r\nhours when her presence in that part of the house was least to be\r\nexpected. Whenever he wanted directions he sent a message, or note with\r\nneither heading nor signature, to which she was obliged to reply in the\r\nsame offhand style. Poor Bathsheba began to suffer now from the most\r\ntorturing sting of all\xe2\x80\x94a sensation that she was despised.\r\n\r\nThe autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy conjectures,\r\nand Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal widowhood, and\r\ntwo years and a quarter of her life alone. On examining her heart it\r\nappeared beyond measure strange that the subject of which the season\r\nmight have been supposed suggestive\xe2\x80\x94the event in the hall at\r\nBoldwood\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94was not agitating her at all; but instead, an agonizing\r\nconviction that everybody abjured her\xe2\x80\x94for what she could not tell\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat Oak was the ringleader of the recusants. Coming out of church that\r\nday she looked round in hope that Oak, whose bass voice she had heard\r\nrolling out from the gallery overhead in a most unconcerned manner,\r\nmight chance to linger in her path in the old way. There he was, as\r\nusual, coming down the path behind her. But on seeing Bathsheba turn,\r\nhe looked aside, and as soon as he got beyond the gate, and there was\r\nthe barest excuse for a divergence, he made one, and vanished.\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought the culminating stroke; she had been expecting\r\nit long. It was a formal notice by letter from him that he should not\r\nrenew his engagement with her for the following Lady-day.\r\n\r\nBathsheba actually sat and cried over this letter most bitterly. She\r\nwas aggrieved and wounded that the possession of hopeless love from\r\nGabriel, which she had grown to regard as her inalienable right for\r\nlife, should have been withdrawn just at his own pleasure in this way.\r\nShe was bewildered too by the prospect of having to rely on her own\r\nresources again: it seemed to herself that she never could again\r\nacquire energy sufficient to go to market, barter, and sell. Since\r\nTroy\xe2\x80\x99s death Oak had attended all sales and fairs for her, transacting\r\nher business at the same time with his own. What should she do now? Her\r\nlife was becoming a desolation.\r\n\r\nSo desolate was Bathsheba this evening, that in an absolute hunger for\r\npity and sympathy, and miserable in that she appeared to have outlived\r\nthe only true friendship she had ever owned, she put on her bonnet and\r\ncloak and went down to Oak\xe2\x80\x99s house just after sunset, guided on her way\r\nby the pale primrose rays of a crescent moon a few days old.\r\n\r\nA lively firelight shone from the window, but nobody was visible in the\r\nroom. She tapped nervously, and then thought it doubtful if it were\r\nright for a single woman to call upon a bachelor who lived alone,\r\nalthough he was her manager, and she might be supposed to call on\r\nbusiness without any real impropriety. Gabriel opened the door, and the\r\nmoon shone upon his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am Mr. Oak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel. \xe2\x80\x9cWho have I the honour\xe2\x80\x94O how stupid\r\nof me, not to know you, mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be your mistress much longer, shall I Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nin pathetic tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no. I suppose\xe2\x80\x94But come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Oh\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get a light,\xe2\x80\x9d Oak\r\nreplied, with some awkwardness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; not on my account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so seldom that I get a lady visitor that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nproper accommodation. Will you sit down, please? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a chair, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s one, too. I am sorry that my chairs all have wood seats, and\r\nare rather hard, but I\xe2\x80\x94was thinking of getting some new ones.\xe2\x80\x9d Oak\r\nplaced two or three for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are quite easy enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo down she sat, and down sat he, the fire dancing in their faces, and\r\nupon the old furniture,\r\n\r\nall a-sheenen\r\nWi\xe2\x80\x99 long years o\xe2\x80\x99 handlen,[3]\r\n\r\n\r\nthat formed Oak\xe2\x80\x99s array of household possessions, which sent back a\r\ndancing reflection in reply. It was very odd to these two persons, who\r\nknew each other passing well, that the mere circumstance of their\r\nmeeting in a new place and in a new way should make them so awkward and\r\nconstrained. In the fields, or at her house, there had never been any\r\nembarrassment; but now that Oak had become the entertainer their lives\r\nseemed to be moved back again to the days when they were strangers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll think it strange that I have come, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no; not at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought\xe2\x80\x94Gabriel, I have been uneasy in the belief that I have\r\noffended you, and that you are going away on that account. It grieved\r\nme very much and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffended me! As if you could do that, Bathsheba!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, gladly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, what are you going away for\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to emigrate, you know; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware that you would\r\nwish me not to when I told \xe2\x80\x99ee or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought of doing it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe said, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI have arranged for Little Weatherbury Farm and shall\r\nhave it in my own hands at Lady-day. You know I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a share in it\r\nfor some time. Still, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent my attending to your\r\nbusiness as before, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t it been that things have been said about\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, in surprise. \xe2\x80\x9cThings said about you and me!\r\nWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be wiser if you were to, I think. You have played the part of\r\nmentor to me many times, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should fear to do it\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing that you have done, this time. The top and tail o\xe2\x80\x99t is\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor Boldwood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfarm, with a thought of getting you some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting me! What does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarrying of \xe2\x80\x99ee, in plain British. You asked me to tell, so you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t blame me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been\r\ndischarged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected. \xe2\x80\x9cMarrying me! I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t know it was that you meant,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a thing as\r\nthat is too absurd\xe2\x80\x94too soon\xe2\x80\x94to think of, by far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; of course, it is too absurd. I don\xe2\x80\x99t desire any such thing; I\r\nshould think that was plain enough by this time. Surely, surely you be\r\nthe last person in the world I think of marrying. It is too absurd, as\r\nyou say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Too\xe2\x80\x94s-s-soon\xe2\x80\x99 were the words I used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg your pardon for correcting you, but you said, \xe2\x80\x98too absurd,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand so do I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon too!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Too\r\nsoon\xe2\x80\x99 was what I said. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter a bit\xe2\x80\x94not at all\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nonly meant, \xe2\x80\x98too soon.\xe2\x80\x99 Indeed, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Mr. Oak, and you must believe\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel looked her long in the face, but the firelight being faint\r\nthere was not much to be seen. \xe2\x80\x9cBathsheba,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, tenderly and in\r\nsurprise, and coming closer: \xe2\x80\x9cif I only knew one thing\xe2\x80\x94whether you\r\nwould allow me to love you and win you, and marry you after all\xe2\x80\x94if I\r\nonly knew that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you never will know,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you never ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel, with a low laugh of joyousness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own dear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought not to have sent me that harsh letter this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninterrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows you didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a bit about me, and were ready\r\nto desert me like all the rest of them! It was very cruel of you,\r\nconsidering I was the first sweetheart that you ever had, and you were\r\nthe first I ever had; and I shall not forget it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Bathsheba, was ever anybody so provoking,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, laughing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it was purely that I, as an unmarried man, carrying on a\r\nbusiness for you as a very taking young woman, had a proper hard part\r\nto play\xe2\x80\x94more particular that people knew I had a sort of feeling for\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee; and I fancied, from the way we were mentioned together, that it\r\nmight injure your good name. Nobody knows the heat and fret I have been\r\ncaused by it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how glad I am I came!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, thankfully, as she rose from\r\nher seat. \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought so much more of you since I fancied you did\r\nnot want even to see me again. But I must be going now, or I shall be\r\nmissed. Why Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a slight laugh, as they went to\r\nthe door, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems exactly as if I had come courting you\xe2\x80\x94how\r\ndreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd quite right too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve danced at your skittish heels,\r\nmy beautiful Bathsheba, for many a long mile, and many a long day; and\r\nit is hard to begrudge me this one visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe accompanied her up the hill, explaining to her the details of his\r\nforthcoming tenure of the other farm. They spoke very little of their\r\nmutual feeling; pretty phrases and warm expressions being probably\r\nunnecessary between such tried friends. Theirs was that substantial\r\naffection which arises (if any arises at all) when the two who are\r\nthrown together begin first by knowing the rougher sides of each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s character, and not the best till further on, the romance\r\ngrowing up in the interstices of a mass of hard prosaic reality. This\r\ngood-fellowship\xe2\x80\x94_camaraderie_\xe2\x80\x94usually occurring through similarity of\r\npursuits, is unfortunately seldom superadded to love between the sexes,\r\nbecause men and women associate, not in their labours, but in their\r\npleasures merely. Where, however, happy circumstance permits its\r\ndevelopment, the compounded feeling proves itself to be the only love\r\nwhich is strong as death\xe2\x80\x94that love which many waters cannot quench, nor\r\nthe floods drown, beside which the passion usually called by the name\r\nis evanescent as steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\nA FOGGY NIGHT AND MORNING\xe2\x80\x94CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose had been Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s words to Oak one evening, some time after\r\nthe event of the preceding chapter, and he meditated a full hour by the\r\nclock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA license\xe2\x80\x94O yes, it must be a license,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself at last.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; first, a license.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps from\r\nthe surrogate\xe2\x80\x99s door, in Casterbridge. On the way home he heard a heavy\r\ntread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to be Coggan.\r\nThey walked together into the village until they came to a little lane\r\nbehind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban Tall, who had\r\nlately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was yet in mortal\r\nterror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone voice among certain\r\nhard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured to follow him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-night, Coggan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going down this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan, surprised; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on to-night then, make so\r\nbold Mr. Oak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the\r\ncircumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time\r\nof Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\r\nkeep a secret, Coggan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve proved me, and you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have, and I do know. Well, then, mistress and I mean to get\r\nmarried to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven\xe2\x80\x99s high tower! And yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of such a thing from time to\r\ntime; true, I have. But keeping it so close! Well, there, \xe2\x80\x99tis no\r\nconsarn of of mine, and I wish \xe2\x80\x99ee joy o\xe2\x80\x99 her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Coggan. But I assure \xe2\x80\x99ee that this great hush is not what I\r\nwished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the\r\nthing. Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shall not be in\r\nchurch, looking at her\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s shy-like and nervous about it, in fact\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nI be doing this to humour her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say. And you be now\r\ngoing down to the clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you may as well come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Coggan, as they walked along. \xe2\x80\x9cLabe Tall\xe2\x80\x99s old woman will horn it\r\nall over parish in half-an-hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak,\r\npausing. \xe2\x80\x9cYet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he\xe2\x80\x99s working so\r\nfar off, and leaves early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x99ee how we could tackle her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll knock and\r\nask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the background.\r\nThen he\xe2\x80\x99ll come out, and you can tell yer tale. She\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess what\r\nI want en for; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make up a few words about the farm-work, as a\r\nblind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and\r\nrapped at Mrs. Tall\xe2\x80\x99s door. Mrs. Tall herself opened it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to have a word with Laban.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not at home, and won\xe2\x80\x99t be this side of eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. He\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nforced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work. I shall do quite\r\nas well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly think you will. Stop a moment;\xe2\x80\x9d and Coggan stepped round the\r\ncorner of the porch to consult Oak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s t\xe2\x80\x99other man, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Tall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay he\xe2\x80\x99s wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning\r\nat ten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, in a whisper. \xe2\x80\x9cThat he must come without fail, and\r\nwear his best clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe clothes will floor us as safe as houses!\xe2\x80\x9d said Coggan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cTell her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Coggan delivered the message. \xe2\x80\x9cMind, het or wet, blow or snow, he\r\nmust come,\xe2\x80\x9d added Jan. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis very particular, indeed. The fact is, \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nto witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi\xe2\x80\x99 another\r\nfarmer for a long span o\xe2\x80\x99 years. There, that\xe2\x80\x99s what \xe2\x80\x99tis, and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ntold \xe2\x80\x99ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ha\xe2\x80\x99 done if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t loved\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ee so hopeless well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCoggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called\r\nat the vicar\xe2\x80\x99s in a manner which excited no curiosity at all. Then\r\nGabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to\r\ncall me at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow, in case I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you always do wake afore then, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I have something important to do, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you of when\r\nthe time comes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s best to make sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any\r\ncontrivance get to sleep again. About six, being quite positive that\r\nher watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer. She\r\nwent and tapped at Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s door, and after some labour awoke her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought it was I who had to call you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the bewildered\r\nLiddy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it isn\xe2\x80\x99t six yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy? I know it must be\r\never so much past seven. Come to my room as soon as you can; I want you\r\nto give my hair a good brushing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Liddy came to Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s room her mistress was already waiting.\r\nLiddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever\r\n_is_ going on, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in her\r\nbright eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarmer Oak\xe2\x80\x94and nobody else?\xe2\x80\x94you two alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it safe, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, after what\xe2\x80\x99s been said?\xe2\x80\x9d asked her companion,\r\ndubiously. \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s good name is such a perishable article that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy\xe2\x80\x99s ear,\r\nalthough there was nobody present. Then Liddy stared and exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouls alive, what news! It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes mine rather furious, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bathsheba. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno getting out of it now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a damp disagreeable morning. Nevertheless, at twenty minutes to\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Oak came out of his house, and\r\n\r\nWent up the hill side\r\nWith that sort of stride\r\nA man puts out when walking in search of a bride,\r\n\r\n\r\nand knocked at Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s door. Ten minutes later a large and a\r\nsmaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and\r\nthrough the mist along the road to the church. The distance was not\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed it\r\nunnecessary to drive. An observer must have been very close indeed to\r\ndiscover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of Oak and\r\nBathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a\r\ngreatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that reached\r\nher clogs. Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a certain\r\nrejuvenated appearance about her:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAs though a rose should shut and be a bud again.\r\n\r\n\r\nRepose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on\r\nNorcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that\r\nfascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only three or\r\nfour-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful. In the church were\r\nTall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short space of time\r\nthe deed was done.\r\n\r\nThe two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba\xe2\x80\x99s parlour in the\r\nevening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak\r\nshould go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house, nor\r\nfurniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards them,\r\nwhilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all three.\r\n\r\nJust as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were greeted\r\nby the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a tremendous\r\nblowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Oak, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew those fellows were up to\r\nsomething, by the look on their faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba\r\nwith a shawl over her head. The rays fell upon a group of male figures\r\ngathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly-married\r\ncouple in the porch, set up a loud \xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d and at the same moment\r\nbang again went the cannon in the background, followed by a hideous\r\nclang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy,\r\ntenor-viol, and double-bass\xe2\x80\x94the only remaining relics of the true and\r\noriginal Weatherbury band\xe2\x80\x94venerable worm-eaten instruments, which had\r\ncelebrated in their own persons the victories of Marlborough, under the\r\nfingers of the forefathers of those who played them now. The performers\r\ncame forward, and marched up to the front.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Oak. \xe2\x80\x9cCome in, souls, and have something to eat and drink wi\xe2\x80\x99 me\r\nand my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial. \xe2\x80\x9cThank ye all\r\nthe same; but we\xe2\x80\x99ll call at a more seemly time. However, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of letting the day pass without a note of admiration of some\r\nsort.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
