I had sometimes thought of\r\npaying a visit to North America, and was now tempted to cross the\r\nAtlantic on board this gigantic boat. First of all the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthen the country celebrated by Cooper.\r\n\r\nThis steam-ship is indeed a masterpiece of naval construction; more than\r\na vessel, it is a floating city, part of the country, detached from\r\nEnglish soil, which after having crossed the sea, unites itself to the\r\nAmerican Continent. I pictured to myself this enormous bulk borne on the\r\nwaves, her defiant struggle with the wind, her boldness before the\r\npowerless sea, her indifference to the billows, her stability in the\r\nmidst of that element which tosses \xe2\x80\x9cWarriors\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSolferinos\xe2\x80\x9d like\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s boats. But my imagination carried me no farther; all these things\r\nI did indeed see during the passage, and many others which do not\r\nexclusively belong to the maritime domain. If the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d is not\r\nmerely a nautical engine, but rather a microcosm, and carries a small\r\nworld with it, an observer will not be astonished to meet here, as on a\r\nlarger theatre, all the instincts, follies, and passions of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the station, I went to the Adelphi Hotel. The \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas announced to sail on the 20th of March, and as I wished to witness\r\nthe last preparations, I asked permission of Captain Anderson, the\r\ncommander, to take my place on board immediately, which permission he\r\nvery obligingly granted.\r\n\r\nThe next day I went down towards the basins which form a double line of\r\ndocks on the banks of the Mersey. The gate-keepers allowed me to go on\r\nto Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Landing-Stage, a kind of movable raft which rises and falls\r\nwith the tide, and is a landing place for the numerous boats which run\r\nbetween Liverpool, and the opposite town of Birkenhead on the left bank\r\nof the Mersey.\r\n\r\nThe Mersey, like the Thames, is only an insignificant stream, unworthy\r\nthe name of river, although it falls into the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is an immense depression of the land filled with water, in fact\r\nnothing more than a hole, the depth of which allows it to receive ships\r\nof the heaviest tonnage, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d to which almost\r\nevery other port in the world is closed. Thanks to this natural\r\ncondition, the streams of the Thames and the Mersey have seen two\r\nimmense commercial cities, London and Liverpool, built almost at their\r\nmouths, and from a similar cause has Glasgow arisen on the Clyde.\r\n\r\nAt Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Landing-Stage, a small tug in the service of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\r\nEastern\xe2\x80\x9d was getting up steam. I went on board and found it already\r\ncrowded with workmen and mechanics. As the clock in Victoria Tower\r\nstruck seven, the tender left her moorings and quickly ascended the\r\nMersey with the rising tide.\r\n\r\nScarcely had we started, when I saw on the quay a tall young man, with\r\nthat aristocratic look which so distinguishes the English officer. I\r\nthought I recognized in him a friend whom I had not seen for several\r\nyears, a captain in the Indian army; but I must have been mistaken, for\r\nCaptain Mac Elwin could not have left Bombay, as I ought to have known,\r\nbesides Mac Elwin was a gay, careless fellow, and a jovial companion,\r\nbut this person, if he resembled him in feature, seemed melancholy, and\r\nas though burdened with a secret grief. Be it as it may, I had not time\r\nto observe him more closely, for the tender was moving rapidly away, and\r\nthe impression founded on this resemblance soon vanished from my mind.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was anchored about three miles up the river, at a\r\ndepth equal to the height of the tallest houses in Liverpool. She was\r\nnot to be seen from Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Stage, but I caught a glimpse of her\r\nimposing bulk from the first bend in the river.\r\n\r\nOne would have taken her for a small island, hardly discernible in the\r\nmist. She appeared with her bows towards us, having swung round with the\r\ntide; but soon the tender altered her course, and the whole length of\r\nthe steam-ship was presented to our view; she seemed what in fact she\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94enormous! Three or four colliers alongside were pouring their\r\ncargoes of coal into her port-holes. Beside the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d these\r\nthree-mast ships looked like barges; their chimneys did not even reach\r\nthe first line of light-ports in her hull; the yards of their\r\ngallant-sails did not come up to her bulwarks. The giant could have\r\nhoisted these ships on its davits like shore-boats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tender approached the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d whose chains were\r\nviolently strained by the pressure of the tide, and ranged up to the\r\nfoot of an immense winding staircase, on the larboard side. In this\r\nposition the deck of the tender was only on a level with the load\r\nwater-line of the steam-ship, to which line she would be depressed when\r\nin full cargo, and which still emerged two yards.\r\n\r\nThe workmen were now hurriedly disembarking and clambering up the\r\nnumerous steps which terminated at the fore-part of the ship. I, with\r\nhead upturned, and my body thrown back, surveyed the wheels of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d like a tourist looking up at a high edifice.\r\n\r\nSeen from the side, these wheels looked narrow and contracted, although\r\ntheir paddles were four yards broad, but in front they had a monumental\r\naspect. Their elegant fittings, the arrangements of the whole plan, the\r\nstays crossing each other to support the division of the triple centre\r\nrim, the radius of red spokes, the machinery half lost in the shadow of\r\nthe wide paddle-boards, all this impressed the mind, and awakened an\r\nidea of some gigantic and mysterious power.\r\n\r\nWith what force must these wooden paddles strike the waves which are now\r\ngently breaking over them! what a boiling of water when this powerful\r\nengine strikes it blow after blow! what a thundering noise engulfed in\r\nthis paddle-box cavern! when the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d goes at full speed,\r\nunder the pressure of wheels measuring fifty-three feet in diameter and\r\n166 in circumference, weighing ninety tons, and making eleven\r\nrevolutions a minute. The tender had disembarked her crew; I stepped on\r\nto the fluted iron steps, and in a few minutes had crossed the fore-part\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deck was still nothing but an immense timber-yard given up to an\r\narmy of workmen. I could not believe I was on board a ship. Several\r\nthousand men\xe2\x80\x94workmen, crew, engineers, officers, mechanics,\r\nlookers-on\xe2\x80\x94mingled and jostled together without the least concern, some\r\non deck, others in the engine-room; here pacing the upper decks, there\r\nscattered in the rigging, all in an indescribable pell-mell. Here\r\nfly-wheel cranes were raising enormous pieces of cast-iron, there heavy\r\njoists were hoisted by steam-windlasses; above the engine-rooms an iron\r\ncylinder, a metal shaft in fact, was balanced. At the bows, the yards\r\ncreaked as the sails were hoisted; at the stern rose a scaffolding\r\nwhich, doubtless, concealed some building in construction. Building,\r\nfixing, carpentering, rigging, and painting, were going on in the midst\r\nof the greatest disorder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPENTERING, RIGGING, AND PAINTING.]\r\n\r\nMy luggage was already on board. I asked to see Captain Anderson, and\r\nwas told that he had not yet arrived; but one of the stewards undertook\r\nto install me, and had my packages carried to one of the aft-cabins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 was announced to\r\nsail on the 20th of March, but is it possible that we can be ready in\r\ntwenty-four hours? Can you tell me when we may expect to leave\r\nLiverpool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut in this respect the steward knew no more than I did, and he left me\r\nto myself. I then made up my mind to visit all the ins and outs of this\r\nimmense ant-hill, and began my walk like a tourist in a foreign town. A\r\nblack mire\xe2\x80\x94that British mud which is so rarely absent from the pavement\r\nof English towns\xe2\x80\x94covered the deck of the steam-ship; dirty gutters wound\r\nhere and there. One might have thought oneself in the worst part of\r\nUpper Thames Street, near London Bridge. I walked on, following the\r\nupper decks towards the stern. Stretching on either side were two wide\r\nstreets, or rather boulevards, filled with a compact crowd; thus\r\nwalking, I came to the centre of the steam-ship between the paddles,\r\nunited by a double set of bridges.\r\n\r\nHere opened the pit containing the machinery of the paddle-wheels, and I\r\nhad an opportunity of looking at this admirable locomotive engine. About\r\nfifty workmen were scattered on the metallic skylights, some clinging to\r\nthe long suction-pumps fixing the eccentric wheels, others hanging on\r\nthe cranks riveting iron wedges with enormous wrenches. After having\r\ncast a rapid glance over these fitting works, I continued my walk till I\r\nreached the bows, where the carpenters were finishing the decoration of\r\na large saloon called the \xe2\x80\x9csmoking-room,\xe2\x80\x9d a magnificent apartment with\r\nfourteen windows; the ceiling white and gold, and wainscoted with\r\nlemon-coloured panels. Then, after having crossed a small triangular\r\nspace at the bows, I reached the stem, which descends perpendicularly\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\nTurning round from this extreme point, through an opening in the mists,\r\nI saw the stern of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d at a distance of more than two\r\nhundred yards.\r\n\r\nI returned by the boulevards on the starboard side, avoiding contact\r\nwith the swaying pulleys and the ropes of the rigging, lashed in all\r\ndirections by the wind; now keeping out of the way, here of the blows of\r\na fly-wheel crane, and further on, of the flaming scoria which were\r\nshowering from a forge like a display of fireworks. I could hardly see\r\nthe tops of the masts, two hundred feet in height, which lost themselves\r\nin the mist, increased by the black smoke from the tenders and colliers.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed the great hatchway of the engine-rooms, I observed a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csmall hotel\xe2\x80\x9d on my left, and then the spacious side walls of a palace\r\nsurmounted by a terrace, the railings of which were being varnished. At\r\nlast I reached the stern of the steam-ship, and the place I had already\r\nnoticed where the scaffolding was erected. Here between the last small\r\ndeck cabin and the enormous gratings of the hatchways, above which rose\r\nthe four wheels of the rudder, some engineers had just finished placing\r\na steam-engine. The engine was composed of two horizontal cylinders, and\r\npresented a system of pinions, levers, and blocks which seemed to me\r\nvery complicated. I did not understand at first for what it was\r\nintended, but it appeared that here, as everywhere else, the\r\npreparations were far from complete.\r\n\r\nAnd now, why all these delays? Why so many new arrangements on board the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d a comparatively new ship? The reason may be explained\r\nin a few words.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty passages from England to America, one of which was marked\r\nby very serious disasters, the use of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\ntemporarily abandoned, and this immense ship, arranged to accommodate\r\npassengers, seemed no longer good for anything. When the first attempt\r\nto lay the Atlantic cable had failed,\xe2\x80\x94partly because the number of ships\r\nwhich carried it was insufficient\xe2\x80\x94engineers thought of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\r\nEastern.\xe2\x80\x9d She alone could store on board the 2100 miles of metallic\r\nwire, weighing 4500 tons. She alone, thanks to her perfect indifference\r\nto the sea, could unroll and immerse this immense cable. But special\r\narrangements were necessary for storing away the cable in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhold. Two out of six boilers were removed, and one chimney out of three\r\nbelonging to the screw engine; in their places large tanks were placed\r\nfor the cable, which was immersed in water to preserve it from the\r\neffects of variation of the atmosphere; the wire thus passed from these\r\ntanks of water into the sea without suffering the least contact with the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe laying of the cable having been successfully accomplished, and the\r\nobject in view attained, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was once more left in her\r\ncostly idleness. A French company, called the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern Company,\r\nLimited,\xe2\x80\x9d was floated with a capital of 2,000,000 francs, with the\r\nintention of employing the immense ship for the conveyance of passengers\r\nacross the Atlantic. Thus the reason for rearranging the ship to this\r\npurpose, and the consequent necessity of filling up the tanks and\r\nreplacing the boilers, of enlarging the saloons in which so many people\r\nwere to live during the voyage, and of building extra dining saloons,\r\nfinally the arrangement of a thousand berths in the sides of the\r\ngigantic hull.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was freighted to the amount of 25,000 francs a\r\nmonth. Two contracts were arranged with G. Forrester and Co., of\r\nLiverpool, the first to the amount of 538,750 francs, for making new\r\nboilers for the screw; the second to the amount of 662,500 francs for\r\ngeneral repairs, and fixings on board.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the last undertaking, the Board of Trade required\r\nthat the ship\xe2\x80\x99s hull should undergo a strict examination. This costly\r\noperation accomplished, a long crack in her exterior plates was\r\ncarefully repaired at a great expense, and the next proceeding was to\r\nfix the new boilers; the driving main-shaft of the wheels, which had\r\nbeen damaged during the last voyage, had to be replaced by a shaft,\r\nprovided with two eccentric wheels, which insured the solidity of this\r\nimportant part. And now for the first time the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was to be\r\nsteered by steam.\r\n\r\nIt was for this delicate operation that the engineers intended the\r\nengine which they had placed at the stern. The steersman standing on the\r\nbridge between the signal apparatus of the wheels and the screw, has\r\nbefore his eyes a dial provided with a moving needle, which tells him\r\nevery moment the position of his rudder. In order to modify it, he has\r\nonly to press his hand lightly on a small wheel, measuring hardly a foot\r\nin diameter, and placed within his reach. Immediately the valves open,\r\nthe steam from the boilers rushes along the conducting tubes into the\r\ntwo cylinders of the small engine, the pistons move rapidly, and the\r\nrudder instantly obeys. If this plan succeeds, a man will be able to\r\ndirect the gigantic body of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d with one finger.\r\n\r\nFor five days operations continued with distracting activity. These\r\ndelays considerably affected the enterprise of the freighters, but the\r\ncontractors could do no more. The day for setting sail was irrevocably\r\nsettled for the 26th of March. The 25th still saw the deck strewn with\r\nall kinds of tools.\r\n\r\nDuring this last day, however, little by little the gangways were\r\ncleared, the scaffoldings were taken down, the fly-wheel cranes\r\ndisappeared, the fixing of the engines was accomplished, the last screws\r\nand nails were driven in, the reservoirs filled with oil, and the last\r\nslab rested on its metal mortise. This day the chief engineer tried the\r\nboilers. The engine-rooms were full of steam; leaning over the hatchway,\r\nenveloped in a hot mist, I could see nothing, but I heard the long\r\npistons groaning, and the huge cylinders noisily swaying to and fro on\r\ntheir solid swing blocks. The muddy waters of the Mersey were lashed\r\ninto foam by the slowly revolving paddle-wheels; at the stern, the screw\r\nbeat the waves with its four blades; the two engines, entirely\r\nindependent of each other, were in complete working order.\r\n\r\nTowards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock a small steamer, intended as a shore-boat for the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d came alongside. Her movable engine was first hoisted on\r\nboard by means of windlasses, but as for the steamer herself, she could\r\nnot be embarked. Her steel hull was so heavy that the davits to which it\r\nwas attached bent under the weight, undoubtedly this would not have\r\noccurred had they supported them with lifts. Therefore they were obliged\r\nto abandon the steamer, but there still remained on the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na string of sixteen boats hanging to the davits.\r\n\r\nEverything was finished by evening; not a trace of mud was visible on\r\nthe well-swept boulevards, for an army of sweepers had been at work.\r\nThere was a full cargo; provisions, goods, and coal filled the stewards\xe2\x80\x99\r\nroom, the store, and the coal houses. However, the steamer had not yet\r\nsunk to the load water-line, and did not draw the necessary thirty-three\r\nfeet. It was an inconvenient position for the wheels, for the paddles\r\nnot being sufficiently immersed, caused a great diminution in the speed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was possible to set sail, and I went to bed with the\r\nhope of starting next day. I was not disappointed, for at break of dawn\r\nI saw the English, French, and American flags floating from the masts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was indeed preparing to sail. Already volumes of\r\nblack smoke were issuing from the five chimneys, and hot steam filled\r\nthe engine-rooms. Some sailors were brightening up the four great\r\nfog-cannons which were to salute Liverpool as we sailed by. The top-men\r\nclimbed the yards, disentangled the rigging, and tightened the shrouds\r\non the thick ropes fastened to the barricades. About eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\ncarpenters and painters put the finishing touches to their work, and\r\nthen embarked on board the tender which awaited them. As soon as there\r\nwas a sufficient pressure, the steam rushed into the cylinders of the\r\nrudder engine, and the engineers had the pleasure of seeing that this\r\ningenious contrivance was an entire success.\r\n\r\nThe weather was fine, with bright gleams of sunshine darting through the\r\nrapidly-moving clouds. There must have been a strong breeze at sea, but\r\nwe did not feel it.\r\n\r\nThe officers were all dispersed about the deck, making preparations for\r\ngetting under sail. The ship\xe2\x80\x99s officers were composed of the Captain,\r\nthe first officer, two assistant officers, five lieutenants, of whom one\r\nwas a Frenchman, M. H\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and a volunteer who was also French.\r\n\r\nCaptain Anderson holds a high place in the commercial marine of England.\r\nIt is to him we are indebted for the laying of the Transatlantic cable,\r\nthough it is true that if he succeeded where his predecessors had\r\nfailed, it was because he worked under more favourable circumstances,\r\nhaving the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d at his command. Be it as it may, his success\r\ngained for him the title of \xe2\x80\x9cSir.\xe2\x80\x9d I found him to be a very agreeable\r\ncommander. He was a man of about fifty years of age, with that tawny\r\ncomplexion which remains unchanged by weather or age; a thorough\r\nEnglishman, with a tall figure, a broad smiling face, and merry eyes;\r\nwalking with a quiet dignified step, his hands never in his pockets,\r\nalways irreproachably gloved and elegantly dressed, and invariably with\r\na little piece of his white handkerchief peeping out of the pocket of\r\nhis blue and gold-laced overcoat.\r\n\r\nThe first officer presented a singular contrast to Captain Anderson, and\r\nhis appearance is easily described:\xe2\x80\x94an active little man, with a very\r\nsunburnt skin, a black beard almost covering his face, and legs which\r\ndefied every lurch of the vessel. A skilful, energetic seaman, he gave\r\nhis orders in a clear, decided tone, the boatswain repeating them with a\r\nvoice like the roaring of a hoarse lion. The second officer\xe2\x80\x99s name was\r\nW\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94: I think he was a naval officer, on board the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nspecial permission; he had all the appearance of a regular \xe2\x80\x9cJack-tar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBesides the ship officers, the engines were under the command of a chief\r\nengineer, assisted by eight or ten engineering officers, and a battalion\r\nof two hundred and fifty men, some stokers, others oilers, who hardly\r\never left the engine-rooms.\r\n\r\nThis army of men was well occupied night and day, having ten boilers\r\nwith ten furnaces and about a hundred fires to attend to.\r\n\r\nAs for the crew of the steam-ship proper, what with quartermasters,\r\ntop-men, steersmen, and cabin-boys, it comprised about one hundred men,\r\nand besides these, there were two hundred stewards employed for serving\r\nthe passengers.\r\n\r\nEvery man was at his post; the pilot who was to conduct the vessel out\r\nof the Mersey had been on board since the evening before. I saw also a\r\nFrench pilot, who was to make the passage with us, and on her return to\r\ntake the steam-ship into anchorage at Brest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think we shall sail to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Lieutenant H\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are only waiting for our passengers,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my countryman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve or thirteen hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven the tender was hailed, laden with passengers, who,\r\nas I afterwards learnt, were Californians, Canadians, Americans,\r\nPeruvians, English, Germans, and two or three Frenchmen. Among the most\r\ndistinguished were the celebrated Cyrus Field of New York, the\r\nHonourable John Rose of Canada, the Honourable J. Mac Alpine of New\r\nYork, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Cohen of San Francisco, Mr. and Mrs. Whitney\r\nof Montreal, Captain Mc Ph\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and his wife. Among the French was the\r\nfounder of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern Freight Company,\xe2\x80\x9d M. Jules D\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nrepresentative of the \xe2\x80\x9cTelegraph Construction and Maintenance Company,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwho had made a contribution of twenty thousand pounds to the fund.\r\n\r\nThe tender ranged herself at the foot of a flight of steps, and then\r\nbegan the slow, interminable ascent of passengers and luggage.\r\n\r\nThe first care of each passenger, when he had once set foot on the\r\nsteamer, was to go and secure his place in the dining-room; his card, or\r\nhis name written on a scrap of paper, was enough to insure his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEN BEGAN THE SLOW INTERMINABLE ASCENT.]\r\n\r\nI remained on deck in order to notice all the details of embarkation. At\r\nhalf-past twelve the luggage was all on board, and I saw thousands of\r\npackages of every description, from chests large enough to contain a\r\nsuite of furniture, to elegant little travelling-cases and fanciful\r\nAmerican and English trunks, heaped together pell-mell. All these were\r\nsoon cleared from the deck, and stowed away in the store-rooms; workmen\r\nand porters returned to the tender, which steered off, after having\r\nblackened the side of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d with her smoke.\r\n\r\nI was going back towards the bows, when suddenly I found myself face to\r\nface with the young man I had seen on Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Landing-Stage. He stopped\r\non seeing me, and held out his hand, which I warmly shook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Fabian!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven so, my dear friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not mistaken, then; it was really you I saw on the quay a day or\r\ntwo since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most likely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fabian, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I did not see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are going to America?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! Do you think I could spend a month\xe2\x80\x99s leave better than in\r\ntravelling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow fortunate that you thought of making your tour in the \xe2\x80\x98Great\r\nEastern\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not chance at all, my dear fellow. I read in the newspaper that\r\nyou were one of the passengers; and as we have not met for some years\r\nnow, I came on board, in order to make the passage with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you come from India?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by the \xe2\x80\x98Godavery,\xe2\x80\x99 which arrived at Liverpool the day before\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are travelling, Fabian?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, noticing his pale, sad face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo divert my mind, if I can,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Captain Mac Elwin, warmly\r\npressing my hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFabian left me, to look for his cabin, which, according to the ticket he\r\nheld in his hand, was number seventy-three of the grand saloon series.\r\nAt this moment large volumes of smoke curled from the chimneys; the\r\nsteam hissed with a deafening noise through the escape-pipes, and fell\r\nin a fine rain over the deck; a noisy eddying of water announced that\r\nthe engines were at work. We were at last going to start.\r\n\r\nFirst of all the anchor had to be raised. The \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d swung\r\nround with the tide; all was now clear, and Captain Anderson was obliged\r\nto choose this moment to set sail, for the width of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndid not allow of her turning round in the Mersey. He was more master of\r\nhis ship and more certain of guiding her skilfully in the midst of the\r\nnumerous boats always plying on the river when stemming the rapid\r\ncurrent than when driven by the ebb-tide; the least collision with this\r\ngigantic body would have proved disastrous.\r\n\r\nTo weigh anchor under these circumstances required considerable\r\nexertion, for the pressure of the tide stretched the chains by which the\r\nship was moored, and besides this, a strong south-wester blew with full\r\nforce on her hull, so that it required powerful engines to hoist the\r\nheavy anchors from their muddy beds. An anchor-boat, intended for this\r\npurpose, had just stoppered on the chains, but the windlasses were not\r\nsufficiently powerful, and they were obliged to use the steam apparatus\r\nwhich the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had at her disposal.\r\n\r\nAt the bows was an engine of sixty-six horse-power. In order to raise\r\nthe anchors it was only necessary to send the steam from the boilers\r\ninto its cylinders to obtain immediately a considerable power, which\r\ncould be directly applied to the windlass on which the chains were\r\nfastened. This was done; but powerful as it was, this engine was found\r\ninsufficient, and fifty of the crew were set to turn the capstan with\r\nbars, thus the anchors were gradually drawn in, but it was slow work.\r\n\r\nI was on the poop at the bows with several other passengers at this\r\nmoment, watching the details of departure. Near me stood a traveller,\r\nwho frequently shrugged his shoulders impatiently, and did not spare\r\ndisparaging jokes on the tardiness of the work. He was a thin, nervous\r\nlittle man, with quick, restless eyes: a physiognomist could easily see\r\nthat the things of this life always appeared on their funny side to this\r\nphilosopher of Democrates school, for his risible muscles were never\r\nstill for a moment; but without describing him further, I need only say\r\nI found him a very pleasant fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought until now, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat engines were made to\r\nhelp men, not men to help engines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to reply to this wise observation, when there was a loud\r\ncry, and immediately my companion and I were hurled towards the bows;\r\nevery man at the capstan-bars was knocked down; some got up again,\r\nothers lay scattered on the deck. A catch had broken, and the capstan\r\nbeing forced round by the frightful pressure of the chains, the men,\r\ncaught by the rebound, were struck violently on the head and chest.\r\nFreed from their broken rope-bands, the capstan-bars flew in all\r\ndirections like grape-shot, killing four sailors, and wounding twelve\r\nothers; among the latter was the boatswain, a Scotchman from Dundee.\r\n\r\nThe spectators hurried towards the unfortunate men, the wounded were\r\ntaken to the hospital at the stern; as for the four already dead,\r\npreparations were immediately made to send them on shore: so lightly do\r\nAnglo-Saxons regard death, that this event made very little impression\r\non board. These unhappy men, killed and wounded, were only tools, which\r\ncould be replaced at very little expense. The tender, already some\r\ndistance off, was hailed, and in a few minutes she was alongside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVERY MAN AT THE CAPSTAN-BARS WAS KNOCKED DOWN.]\r\n\r\nI went towards the fore-part of the vessel, the staircase had not yet\r\nbeen raised. The four corpses, enveloped in coverings, were let down,\r\nand placed on the deck of the tender. One of the surgeons on board\r\nembarked to go with them to Liverpool, with injunctions to rejoin the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d as quickly as possible. The tender immediately sheered\r\noff, and the sailors went to the bows, to wash the stains of blood from\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\nI ought to add that one of the passengers, slightly wounded by the\r\nbreaking of the pinion, took advantage of this circumstance to leave by\r\nthe tender; he had already had enough of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI watched the little boat going off full steam, and, turning round, I\r\nheard my ironical fellow-traveller mutter,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good beginning for a voyage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very bad one, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTo whom have I the honour of speaking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Dr. Dean Pitferge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of weighing anchors was resumed; with the help of the\r\nanchor-boat the chains were eased, and the anchors at last left their\r\ntenacious depths. A quarter past one sounded from the Birkenhead\r\nclock-towers, the moment of departure could not be deferred, if it was\r\nintended to make use of the tide. The captain and pilot went on the\r\nfoot-bridge; one lieutenant placed himself near the screw-signal\r\napparatus, another near that of the paddle-wheel, in case of the failure\r\nof the steam-engine; four other steersmen watched at the stern, ready to\r\nput in action the great wheels placed on the gratings of the hatchings.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d making head against the current, was now only\r\nwaiting to descend the river with the ebb-tide.\r\n\r\nThe order for departure was given, the paddles slowly struck the water,\r\nthe screw bubbled at the stern, and the enormous vessel began to move.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the passengers on the poop were gazing at the double\r\nlandscape of Liverpool and Birkenhead, studded with manufactory\r\nchimneys. The Mersey, covered with ships, some lying at anchor, others\r\nascending and descending the river, offered only a winding passage for\r\nour steam-ship. But under the hand of a pilot, sensible to the least\r\ninclinations of her rudder, she glided through the narrow passages, like\r\na whale-boat beneath the oar of a vigorous steersman. At one time I\r\nthought that we were going to run foul of a brig, which was drifting\r\nacross the stream, her bows nearly grazing the hull of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\r\nEastern,\xe2\x80\x9d but a collision was avoided, and when from the height of the\r\nupper deck I looked at this ship, which was not of less than seven or\r\neight hundred tons burden, she seemed to me no larger than the tiny\r\nboats which children play with on the lakes of Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park or the\r\nSerpentine. It was not long before the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was opposite the\r\nLiverpool landing-stages, but the four cannons which were to have\r\nsaluted the town, were silent out of respect to the dead, for the tender\r\nwas disembarking them at this moment; however, loud hurrahs replaced the\r\nreports which are the last expressions of national politeness.\r\nImmediately there was a vigorous clapping of hands and waving of\r\nhandkerchiefs, with all the enthusiasm with which the English hail the\r\ndeparture of every vessel, be it only a simple yacht sailing round a\r\nbay. But with what shouts they were answered! what echoes they called\r\nforth from the quays! There were thousands of spectators on both the\r\nLiverpool and Birkenhead sides, and boats laden with sight-seers swarmed\r\non the Mersey. The sailors manning the yards of the \xe2\x80\x9cLord Clyde,\xe2\x80\x9d lying\r\nat anchor opposite the docks, saluted the giant with their hearty\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\nBut even the noise of the cheering could not drown the frightful discord\r\nof several bands playing at the same time. Flags were incessantly\r\nhoisted in honour of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d but soon the cries grew faint\r\nin the distance. Our steam-ship ranged near the \xe2\x80\x9cTripoli,\xe2\x80\x9d a Cunard\r\nemigrant-boat, which in spite of her 2000 tons burden looked like a mere\r\nbarge; then the houses grew fewer and more scattered on both shores, the\r\nlandscape was no longer blackened with smoke; and brick walls, with the\r\nexception of some long regular buildings intended for workmen\xe2\x80\x99s houses,\r\ngave way to the open country, with pretty villas dotted here and there.\r\nOur last salutation reached us from the platform of the lighthouse and\r\nthe walls of the bastion.\r\n\r\nAt three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had crossed the bar of the Mersey,\r\nand shaped her course down St. George\xe2\x80\x99s Channel. There was a strong\r\nsou\xe2\x80\x99wester blowing, and a heavy swell on the sea, but the steam-ship did\r\nnot feel it.\r\n\r\nTowards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the Captain gave orders to heave to; the tender put\r\non full steam to rejoin us, as she was bringing back the doctor. When\r\nthe boat came alongside a rope-ladder was thrown out, by which he\r\nascended, not without some difficulty. Our more agile pilot slid down by\r\nthe same way into his boat, which was awaiting him, each rower provided\r\nwith a cork jacket. Some minutes after he went on board a charming\r\nlittle schooner waiting to catch the breeze.\r\n\r\nOur course was immediately continued; under the pressure of the paddles\r\nand the screw, the speed of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d greatly increased; in\r\nspite of the wind ahead, she neither rolled nor pitched. Soon the shades\r\nof night stretched across the sea, and Holyhead Point was lost in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 27th of March, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d coasted along the\r\ndeeply-indented Irish shore. I had chosen my cabin at the bows; it was a\r\nsmall room well lighted by two skylights. A second row of cabins\r\nseparated it from the first saloon, so that neither the noise of\r\nconversation, nor the rattling of pianos, which were not wanting on\r\nboard, could reach me. It was an isolated cabin; the furniture consisted\r\nof a sofa, a bedstead, and a toilet-table.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, having crossed the first two rooms, I\r\nwent on deck. A few passengers were already pacing the upper decks; an\r\nalmost imperceptible swell balanced the steamer; the wind, however, was\r\nhigh, but the sea, protected by the coast, was comparatively calm.\r\n\r\nFrom the poop of the smoking-room, I perceived that long line of shore,\r\nthe continual verdure of which has won for it the name of \xe2\x80\x9cEmerald\r\nCoast.\xe2\x80\x9d A few solitary houses, a string of tide-waiters, a wreath of\r\nwhite smoke curling from between two hills, indicating the passing of a\r\ntrain, an isolated signal-post making grimacing gestures to the vessels\r\nat large, here and there animated the scene.\r\n\r\nThe sea between us and the coast was of a dull green shade; there was a\r\nfresh breeze blowing, mists floated above the water like spray. Numerous\r\nvessels, brigs and schooners, were awaiting the tide; steamers puffing\r\naway their black smoke were soon distanced by the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nalthough she was going at a very moderate speed.\r\n\r\nSoon we came in sight of Queenstown, a small \xe2\x80\x9ccalling-place,\xe2\x80\x9d before\r\nwhich several fishermen\xe2\x80\x99s boats were at work. It is here that all ships\r\nbound for Liverpool, whether steamers or sailing-ships, throw out their\r\ndespatch-bags, which are carried to Dublin in a few hours by an express\r\ntrain always in readiness. From Dublin they are conveyed across the\r\nchannel to Holyhead by a fast steamer, so that despatches thus sent are\r\none day in advance of the most rapid Transatlantic steamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF QUEENSTOWN.]\r\n\r\nAbout nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock the bearings of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d were\r\nwest-north-west. I was just going on deck, when I met Captain Mac Elwin,\r\naccompanied by a friend, a tall, robust man, with a light beard and long\r\nmoustache which mingled with the whiskers and left the chin bare, after\r\nthe fashion of the day. This tall fellow was the exact type of an\r\nEnglish officer; his figure was erect without stiffness, his look calm,\r\nhis walk dignified but easy; his whole appearance seemed to indicate\r\nunusual courage, and I was not mistaken in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, Archibald Corsican,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fabian to me, \xe2\x80\x9ca captain in the\r\n22nd regiment of the Indian army, like myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus introduced, Captain Corsican and I bowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN CORSICAN AND I BOWED.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe hardly saw each other yesterday, Fabian,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shaking Captain\r\nMac Elwin\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were in the bustle of departure, so that all I\r\nknow about you is that it was not chance which brought you on board the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern.\xe2\x80\x99 I must confess that if I have anything to do with your\r\ndecision\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Fabian; \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Corsican and\r\nI came to Liverpool with the intention of taking our berths on board the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98China,\xe2\x80\x99 a Cunard steamer, when we heard that the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\ngoing to attempt another passage from England to America; it was a\r\nchance we might not get again, and learning that you were on board I did\r\nnot hesitate, as I had not seen you since we took that delightful trip\r\nin the Scandinavian States three years ago; so now you know how it was\r\nthat the tender brought us here yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Fabian,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that neither Captain Corsican\r\nnor yourself will regret your decision, as a passage across the Atlantic\r\nin this huge boat cannot fail to be interesting even to you who are so\r\nlittle used to the sea. But now let us talk about yourself. Your last\r\nletter, and it is not more than six weeks since I received it, bore the\r\nBombay post-mark, so that I was justified in believing you were still\r\nwith your regiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were so three weeks ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fabian, \xe2\x80\x9cleading the half-military,\r\nhalf-country life of Indian officers, employing most of our time in\r\nhunting; my friend here is a famed tiger-killer; however, as we are both\r\nsingle and without family ties, we thought we would let the poor wild\r\nbeasts of the peninsula rest for a time, while we came to Europe to\r\nbreathe a little of our native air. We obtained a year\xe2\x80\x99s leave, and\r\ntravelling by way of the Red Sea, Suez, and France, we reached Old\r\nEngland with the utmost possible speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld England,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Corsican, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cwe are there no longer,\r\nFabian; we are on board an English ship, but it is freighted by a French\r\ncompany, and it is taking us to America; three different flags float\r\nover our heads, signifying that we are treading on Franco-Anglo-American\r\nboards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Fabian, and a painful expression passed\r\nover his face; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it matter, so long as it whiles away the time?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Movement is life;\xe2\x80\x99 and it is well to be able to forget the past, and\r\nkill the present by continual change. In a few days I shall be at New\r\nYork, where I hope to meet again my sister and her children, whom I have\r\nnot seen for several years; then we shall visit the great lakes, and\r\ndescend the Mississippi as far as New Orleans, where we shall look for\r\nsport on the Amazon. From America we are going to Africa, where the\r\nlions and elephants will make the Cape their \xe2\x80\x98rendezvous,\xe2\x80\x99 in order to\r\ncelebrate the arrival of Captain Corsican. Finally, we shall return and\r\nimpose on the Sepoys the caprices of the metropolis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFabian spoke with a nervous volubility, and his breast heaved; evidently\r\nthere was some great grief weighing on his mind, the cause of which I\r\nwas as yet ignorant of, but with which Archibald seemed to be well\r\nacquainted. He evinced a warm friendship for Fabian, who was several\r\nyears younger than himself, treating him like a younger brother, with a\r\ndevotion which at times almost amounted to heroism.\r\n\r\nAt this moment our conversation was interrupted by the sound of a horn,\r\nwhich announced the half-past twelve lunch. Four times a day, to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of the passengers, this shrill horn sounded: at\r\nhalf-past eight for breakfast, half-past twelve for lunch, four o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\nfor dinner, and at seven for tea. In a few minutes the long streets were\r\ndeserted, and soon the tables in the immense saloons were filled with\r\nguests. I succeeded in getting a place near Fabian and Captain Corsican.\r\n\r\nThe dining-rooms were provided with four long rows of tables; the\r\nglasses and bottles placed in swing-racks kept perfectly steady; the\r\nroll of the steamer was almost imperceptible, so that the guests\xe2\x80\x94men,\r\nwomen, and children\xe2\x80\x94could eat their lunch without any fear. Numerous\r\nwaiters were busy carrying round the tastily-arranged dishes, and\r\nsupplying the demands for wine and beer; the Californians certainly\r\ndistinguished themselves by their proclivities for champagne. Near her\r\nhusband sat an old laundress, who had found gold in the San Francisco\r\nwashing-tubs, emptying a bottle of champagne in no time; two or three\r\npale, delicate-looking young ladies were eagerly devouring slices of red\r\nbeef; and others discussing with evident satisfaction the merits of\r\nrhubarb tart, &c. Every one worked away in the highest spirits; one\r\ncould have fancied oneself at a restaurant in the middle of Paris\r\ninstead of the open sea.\r\n\r\nLunch over, the decks were again filled; people bowed and spoke to each\r\nother in passing as formally as if they were walking in Hyde Park;\r\nchildren played and ran about, throwing their balls and bowling hoops as\r\nthey might have done on the gravel walks of the Tuileries; the greater\r\npart of the men walked up and down smoking; the ladies, seated on\r\nfolding-chairs, worked, read, or talked together, whilst the governesses\r\nand nurses looked after the children. A few corpulent Americans swung\r\nthemselves backwards and forwards in their rocking-chairs; the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nofficers were continually passing to and fro, some going to their watch\r\non the bridge, others answering the absurd questions put to them by some\r\nof the passengers; whilst the tones of an organ and two or three pianos\r\nmaking a distracting discord, reached us through the lulls in the wind.\r\n\r\nAbout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock a loud shouting was heard; the passengers crowded on\r\nto the poop; the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had ranged within two cable-lengths of\r\na vessel which she had overhauled. It was the \xe2\x80\x9cPropontis,\xe2\x80\x9d on her way to\r\nNew York, which was saluting the giant of the seas on her passage, which\r\ncompliment the giant returned.\r\n\r\nLand was still in sight at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, but hardly discernible through\r\nthe mist which had suddenly surrounded us. Soon we saw the light of\r\nFastenet Beacon, situated on an isolated rock. Night set in, during\r\nwhich we must have doubled Cape Clear, the most southerly point of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI said that the length of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d exceeded two hectometres.\r\nFor the benefit of those partial to comparisons, I will add that it is a\r\nthird longer than the \xe2\x80\x9cPont des Arts;\xe2\x80\x9d in reality this steam-ship\r\nmeasures 673 feet at the load water-line, between the perpendiculars;\r\nthe upper deck is 680 feet from stem to stern; that is to say, its\r\nlength is double that of the largest transatlantic steamers; its width\r\namidships is about 71 feet, and behind the paddles about 107 feet.\r\n\r\nThe hull of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d is proof against the most formidable\r\nseas; it is double, and is composed of a number of cells placed between\r\nthe deck and hold; besides these, thirteen compartments, separated by\r\nwater-tight partitions, increase the security against fire or the inlet\r\nof water. Ten thousand tons of iron were used in the construction of\r\nthis hull, and 3,000,000 rivets secured the iron plates on her sides.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d draws 30 feet of water with a cargo of 28,500 tons,\r\nand with a light cargo, from 20 to 30 feet. She is capable of receiving\r\n10,000 passengers, so that out of the 373 principal districts in France,\r\n274 are less populated than this floating sub-prefecture with its\r\naverage number of passengers.\r\n\r\nThe lines of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d are very elongated; her straight stem\r\nis pierced with hawse-holes, through which the anchor-chains pass; no\r\nsigns of dents or protuberances are to be seen on her finely-cut bows,\r\nbut the slight sweep of her rounded stern somewhat mars the general\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nFrom the deck rise six masts and five chimneys. The three masts in front\r\nare the \xe2\x80\x9cfore-gigger\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cfore-mast\xe2\x80\x9d (both of them mizen-masts) and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cmain-mast.\xe2\x80\x9d The last three astern are the \xe2\x80\x9cafter-main-mast,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmizen-mast,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cafter-gigger.\xe2\x80\x9d The fore-masts and the main-masts\r\ncarry the schooner-sails, the top-sails, and the gallant-sails; the four\r\nother masts are only rigged with ordinary sails; the whole forming 5400\r\nsquare yards of good canvas. On the spacious mastheads of the second and\r\nthird masts a band of soldiers could easily man\xc5\x93uvre. Of these six\r\nmasts, supported by shrouds and metallic back-stays, the second, third,\r\nand fourth are made of sheet-iron, and are really masterpieces of\r\nironwork. At the base they measure 43 inches in diameter, and the\r\nlargest (the main-mast) rises to the height of 207 French feet, which is\r\nhigher than the towers of Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nAs to the chimneys, the two belonging to the paddle-engine and the three\r\nbelonging to the screw, they are enormous cylinders, 90 feet high,\r\nsupported by chains fastened to the upper deck.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements with regard to the interior are admirable. The\r\nlaundries and the crew\xe2\x80\x99s berths are shut off at the fore-part, then come\r\nthe ladies\xe2\x80\x99 saloon and a grand saloon ornamented with lustres, swinging\r\nlamps, and pictures. These magnificent rooms are lighted by side\r\nskylights, supported on elegant-gilded pillars, and communicate with the\r\nupper deck by wide staircases with metallic steps and mahogany\r\nbalusters.\r\n\r\nOn deck are arranged four rows of cabins separated by a passage, some\r\nare reached by a landing, others on a lower story by private staircases.\r\nAt the stern the three immense dining-rooms run in the same direction as\r\nthe cabins, a passage leads from the saloons at the stern to those at\r\nthe bows round the paddle-engine, between its sheet-iron partitions and\r\nthe ship\xe2\x80\x99s offices.\r\n\r\nThe engines of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d are justly considered as\r\nmasterpieces\xe2\x80\x94I was going to say of clock-work, for there is nothing more\r\nastonishing than to see this enormous machine working with the precision\r\nand ease of a clock, a singular contrast to the screw, which works\r\nrapidly and furiously, as though getting itself into a rage.\r\n\r\nIndependently of these two engines, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d possesses six\r\nauxiliary ones to work the capstans, so that it is evident steam plays\r\nan important part on board.\r\n\r\nSuch is this steam-ship, without equal and known everywhere; which,\r\nhowever, did not hinder a French captain from making this _na\xc3\xafve_ remark\r\nin his log-book: \xe2\x80\x9cPassed a ship with six masts and five chimneys,\r\nsupposed to be the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday night the weather was very bad, my balance was strangely\r\nvariable, and I was obliged to lean with my knees and elbows against the\r\nsideboard, to prevent myself from falling. Portmanteaus and bags came in\r\nand out of my cabin; an unusual hubbub reigned in the adjoining saloon,\r\nin which two or three hundred packages were making expeditions from one\r\nend to the other, knocking the tables and chairs with loud crashes;\r\ndoors slammed, the boards creaked, the partitions made that groaning\r\nnoise peculiar to pine wood; bottles and glasses jingled together in\r\ntheir racks, and a cataract of plates and dishes rolled about on the\r\npantry floors. I heard the irregular roaring of the screw, and the\r\nwheels beating the water, sometimes entirely immersed, and at others\r\nstriking the empty air; by all these signs I concluded that the wind had\r\nfreshened, and the steam-ship was no longer indifferent to the billows.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning, after passing a sleepless night, I got up\r\nand dressed myself, as well as I could with one hand, while with the\r\nother I clutched at the sides of my cabin, for without support it was\r\nimpossible to keep one\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and I had quite a serious struggle to get\r\non my overcoat. I left my cabin, and helping myself with hands and feet\r\nthrough the billows of luggage, I crossed the saloon, scrambling up the\r\nstairs on my knees, like a Roman peasant devoutly climbing the steps of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cScala santa\xe2\x80\x9d of Pontius Pilate; and at last, reaching the deck, I\r\nhung on firmly to the nearest kevel.\r\n\r\nNo land in sight; we had doubled Cape Clear in the night, and around us\r\nwas that vast circumference bounded by the line, where water and sky\r\nappear to meet. The slate-coloured sea broke in great foamless billows.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d struck amidships, and, supported by no sail, rolled\r\nfrightfully, her bare masts describing immense circles in the air. There\r\nwas no heaving to speak of, but the rolling was dreadful, it was\r\nimpossible to stand upright. The officer on watch, clinging to the\r\nbridge, looked as if he was in a swing.\r\n\r\nFrom kevel to kevel, I managed to reach the paddles on the starboard\r\nside, the deck was damp and slippery from the spray and mist: I was just\r\ngoing to fasten myself to a stanchion of the bridge when a body rolled\r\nat my feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN A BODY ROLLED AT MY FEET.]\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Pitferge, my quaint friend: he scrambled on to his knees, and\r\nlooking at me, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, the amplitude of the arc, described by the sides of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern,\xe2\x80\x99 is forty degrees; that is, twenty degrees below the\r\nhorizontal, and twenty above it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, laughing, not at the observation, but at the\r\ncircumstances under which it was made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the oscillation the speed of the\r\nsides is fifty-nine inches per second, a transatlantic boat half the\r\nsize takes but the same time to recover her equilibrium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9csince that is the case, there is an excess of\r\nstability in the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor her, yes, but not for her passengers,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dean Pitferge\r\ngaily, \xe2\x80\x9cfor you see they come back to the horizontal quicker than they\r\ncare for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, delighted with his repartee, raised himself, and holding\r\neach other up, we managed to reach a seat on the poop. Dean Pitferge had\r\ncome off very well, with only a few bruises, and I congratulated him on\r\nhis lucky escape, as he might have broken his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is not over yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is more trouble coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the steamer, and consequently to me, to us, and to all the\r\npassengers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are speaking seriously, why did you come on board?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see what is going to happen, for I should not be at all ill-pleased\r\nto witness a shipwreck!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, looking at me knowingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the first time you have been on board the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have already made several voyages in her, to satisfy my\r\ncuriosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not complain, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not complain; I merely state facts, and patiently await the hour\r\nof the catastrophe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWas the Doctor making fun of me? I did not know what to think, his small\r\ntwinkling eyes looked very roguish; but I thought I would try him\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know on what facts your painful prognostics\r\nare founded, but allow me to remind you that the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 has\r\ncrossed the Atlantic twenty times, and most of her passages have been\r\nsatisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence; this ship is bewitched, to use a common\r\nexpression, she cannot escape her fate; I know it, and therefore have no\r\nconfidence in her. Remember what difficulties the engineers had to\r\nlaunch her; I believe even that Brunel, who built her, died from the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98effects of the operation,\xe2\x80\x99 as we doctors say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9care you inclined to be a materialist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy ask me that question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have noticed that many who do not believe in God believe in\r\neverything else, even in the evil eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake fun if you like, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut allow me to\r\ncontinue my argument. The \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 has already ruined several\r\ncompanies. Built for the purpose of carrying emigrants to Australia, she\r\nhas never once been there; intended to surpass the ocean steamers in\r\nspeed, she even remains inferior to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit is to be concluded that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready one of her captains\r\nhas been drowned, and he one of the most skilful, for he knew how to\r\nprevent this rolling by keeping the ship a little ahead of the waves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthe death of that able man is to be regretted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Dean Pitferge, without noticing my incredulity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstrange stories are told about this ship; they say that a passenger who\r\nlost his way in the hold of the ship, like a pioneer in the forests of\r\nAmerica, has never yet been found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed I ironically, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s a fact!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say, also, that during the construction of the boilers an engineer\r\nwas melted by mistake in the steam-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I; \xe2\x80\x9cthe melted engineer! \xe2\x80\x98\xc3\x88 ben trovato.\xe2\x80\x99 Do you believe\r\nit, Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pitferge, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe quite seriously that our\r\nvoyage began badly, and that it will end in the same manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 is a solid structure,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand built so\r\nfirmly that she is able to resist the most furious seas like a solid\r\nblock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSolid she is, undoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let her fall into\r\nthe hollow of the waves, and see if she will rise again. Maybe she is a\r\ngiant, but a giant whose strength is not in proportion to her size; her\r\nengines are too feeble for her. Have you ever heard speak of her\r\nnineteenth passage from Liverpool to New York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was on board. We left Liverpool on a Tuesday, the 10th of\r\nDecember; there were numerous passengers, and all full of confidence.\r\nEverything went well so long as we were protected by the Irish coast\r\nfrom the billows of the open sea; no rolling, no sea-sickness; the next\r\nday, even, the same stability; the passengers were delighted. On the\r\n12th, however, the wind freshened towards morning; the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheading the waves, rolled considerably; the passengers, men and women,\r\ndisappeared into the cabins. At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the wind blew a hurricane;\r\nthe furniture began to dance; a mirror in the saloon was broken by a\r\nblow from the head of your humble servant; all the crockery was smashed\r\nto atoms; there was a frightful uproar; eight shore-boats were torn from\r\nthe davits in one swoop. At this moment our situation was serious; the\r\npaddle-wheel-engine had to be stopped; an enormous piece of lead,\r\ndisplaced by a lurch of the vessel, threatened to fall into its\r\nmachinery; however, the screw continued to send us on. Soon the wheels\r\nbegan turning again, but very slowly; one of them had been damaged\r\nduring the stoppage, and its spokes and paddles scraped the hull of the\r\nship. The engine had to be stopped again, and we had to content\r\nourselves with the screw. The night was fearful; the fury of the tempest\r\nwas redoubled; the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 had fallen into the trough of the sea\r\nand could not right herself; at break of day there was not a piece of\r\nironwork remaining on the wheels. They hoisted a few sails in order to\r\nright the ship, but no sooner were they hoisted than they were carried\r\naway; confusion reigned everywhere; the cable-chains, torn from their\r\nbeds, rolled from one side of the ship to the other; a cattle-pen was\r\nknocked in, and a cow fell into the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 saloon through the hatchway;\r\nanother misfortune was the breaking of the rudder-chock, so that\r\nsteering was no longer possible. Frightful crashes were heard; an oil\r\ntank, weighing over three tons, had broken from its fixings, and,\r\nrolling across the tween-decks, struck the sides alternately like a\r\nbattering-ram. Saturday passed in the midst of a general terror, the\r\nship in the trough of the sea all the time. Not until Sunday did the\r\nwind begin to abate, an American engineer on board then succeeded in\r\nfastening the chains on the rudder; we turned little by little, and the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 righted herself. A week after we left Liverpool we\r\nreached Queenstown. Now, who knows, sir, where we shall be in a week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s words were not very comforting, the\r\npassengers would not have heard them without shuddering. Was he joking,\r\nor did he speak seriously? Was it, indeed true, that he went with the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d in all her voyages, to be present at some catastrophe?\r\nEvery thing is possible for an eccentric, especially when he is English.\r\n\r\nHowever, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d continued her course, tossing like a canoe,\r\nand keeping strictly to the loxodromic line of steamers. It is well\r\nknown, that on a flat surface, the nearest way from one point to another\r\nis by a straight line. On a sphere it is the curved line formed by the\r\ncircumference of great circles. Ships have an interest in following this\r\nroute, in order to make the shortest passage, but sailing vessels cannot\r\npursue this track against a head-wind, so that steamers alone are able\r\nto maintain a direct course, and take the route of the great circles.\r\nThis is what the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d did, making a little for the\r\nnorth-west.\r\n\r\nThe rolling never ceased, that horrible sea-sickness, at the same time\r\ncontagious and epidemic, made rapid progress. Several of the passengers,\r\nwith wan, pallid faces, and sunken cheeks, remained on deck, in order to\r\nbreathe the fresh air, the greater part of them were furious at the\r\nunlucky steam-ship, which was conducting herself like a mere buoy, and\r\nat the freighter\xe2\x80\x99s advertisements, which had stated that sea-sickness\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cunknown on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning an object three or four miles off was\r\nsignalled from the larboard quarter. Was it a waif, the carcass of a\r\nwhale, or the hull of a ship? As yet it was not distinguishable. A group\r\nof convalescent passengers stood on the upper deck, at the bows, looking\r\nat this waif which was floating three hundred miles from the nearest\r\nland.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was bearing towards the object signalled;\r\nall opera-glasses were promptly raised, and there was no lack of\r\nconjecture. Between the Americans, and English, to whom every pretext\r\nfor a wager is welcome, betting at once commenced. Among the most\r\ndesperate of the betters I noticed a tall man, whose countenance struck\r\nme as one of profound duplicity. His features were stamped with a look\r\nof general hatred, which neither a physiognomist, nor physiologist could\r\nmistake; his forehead was seamed with a deep furrow, his manner was at\r\nthe same time audacious and listless, his eyebrows nearly meeting,\r\npartly concealed the stony eyes beneath, his shoulders were high and his\r\nchin thrust forward, in fact all the indications of insolence and\r\nknavery were united in his appearance. He spoke in loud pompous tones,\r\nwhile some of his worthy associates laughed at his coarse jokes. This\r\npersonage pretended to recognize in the waif the carcass of a whale, and\r\nhe backed his opinion by heavy stakes, which soon found ready\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nThese wagers, amounting to several hundred dollars, he lost every one;\r\nin fact, the waif was the hull of a ship; the steamer rapidly drew near\r\nit, and we could already see the rusty copper of her keel. It was a\r\nthree-mast ship of about five or six hundred tons, deprived of her masts\r\nand rigging, and lying on one side, with broken chains hanging from her\r\ndavits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WAIF WAS THE HULL OF A SHIP.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad this steam-ship been abandoned by her crew?\xe2\x80\x9d This was now the\r\nprevailing question, however no one appeared on the deck, perhaps the\r\nshipwrecked ones had taken refuge inside. I saw an object moving for\r\nseveral moments at the bows, but it turned out to be only the remains of\r\nthe jib lashed to and fro by the wind.\r\n\r\nThe hull was quite visible at the distance of half a mile; she was a\r\ncomparatively new ship, and in a perfect state of preservation; her\r\ncargo, which had been shifted by the wind, obliged her to lie along on\r\nher starboard side.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d drew nearer, and, passing round, gave notice of her\r\npresence by several shrill whistles; but the waif remained silent, and\r\nunanimated; nothing was to be seen, not even a shore-boat from the\r\nwrecked vessel was visible on the wide expanse of water.\r\n\r\nThe crew had undoubtedly had time to leave her, but could they have\r\nreached land, which was three hundred miles off? Could a frail boat live\r\non a sea like that which had rocked the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d so frightfully?\r\nAnd when could this catastrophe have happened? It was evident that the\r\nshipwreck had taken place farther west, for the wind and waves must have\r\ndriven the hull far out of her course. These questions were destined to\r\nremain unanswered.\r\n\r\nWhen the steam-ship came alongside the stern of the wreck, I could read\r\ndistinctly the name \xe2\x80\x9cLerida,\xe2\x80\x9d but the port she belonged to was not\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nA merchant-vessel or a man-of-war would have had no hesitation in\r\nmanning this hull which, undoubtedly, contained a valuable cargo, but as\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was on regular service, she could not take this waif\r\nin tow for so many hundreds of miles; it was equally impossible to\r\nreturn and take it to the nearest port. Therefore, to the great regret\r\nof the sailors, it had to be abandoned, and it was soon a mere speck in\r\nthe distance. The group of passengers dispersed, some to the saloons,\r\nothers to their cabins, and even the lunch-bell failed to awaken the\r\nslumberers, worn out by sea-sickness. About noon Captain Anderson\r\nordered sail to be hoisted, so that the ship, better supported, did not\r\nroll so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the ship\xe2\x80\x99s disorderly conduct, life on board was becoming\r\norganized, for with the Anglo-Saxon nothing is more simple. The\r\nsteam-boat is his street and his house for the time being; the\r\nFrenchman, on the contrary, always looks like a traveller.\r\n\r\nWhen the weather was favourable, the boulevards were thronged with\r\npromenaders, who managed to maintain the perpendicular, in spite of the\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s motion, but with the peculiar gyrations of tipsy men. When the\r\npassengers did not go on deck, they remained either in their private\r\nsitting rooms or in the grand saloon, and then began the noisy discords\r\nof pianos, all played at the same time, which, however, seemed not to\r\naffect Saxon ears in the least. Among these amateurs, I noticed a tall,\r\nbony woman, who must have been a good musician, for, in order to\r\nfacilitate reading her piece of music, she had marked all the notes with\r\na number, and the piano-keys with a number corresponding, so that if it\r\nwas note twenty-seven, she struck key twenty-seven, if fifty-three, key\r\nfifty-three, and so on, perfectly indifferent to the noise around her,\r\nor the sound of other pianos in the adjoining saloons, and her\r\nequanimity was not even disturbed when some disagreeable little children\r\nthumped with their fists on the unoccupied keys.\r\n\r\nWhilst this concert was going on, a bystander would carelessly take up\r\none of the books scattered here and there on the tables, and, having\r\nfound an interesting passage, would read it aloud, whilst his audience\r\nlistened good-humouredly, and complimented him with a flattering murmur\r\nof applause. Newspapers were scattered on the sofas, generally American\r\nand English, which always look old, although the pages have never been\r\ncut; it is a very tiresome operation reading these great sheets, which\r\ntake up so much room, but the fashion being to leave them uncut, so they\r\nremain. One day I had the patience to read the _New York Herald_ from\r\nbeginning to end under these circumstances, and judge if I was rewarded\r\nfor my trouble when I turned to the column headed \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate:\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cM. X. begs\r\nthe pretty Miss Z\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, whom he met yesterday in Twenty-fifth Street\r\nomnibus, to come to him to-morrow, at his rooms, No. 17, St. Nicholas\r\nHotel; he wishes to speak of marriage with her.\xe2\x80\x9d What did the pretty\r\nMiss Z\xe2\x80\x94 do? I don\xe2\x80\x99t even care to know.\r\n\r\nI passed the whole of the afternoon in the grand saloon talking, and\r\nobserving what was going on about me. Conversation could not fail to be\r\ninteresting, for my friend Dean Pitferge was sitting near me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you quite recovered from the effects of your tumble?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s no go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is no go? You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, our steam-ship; the screw boilers are not working well; we cannot\r\nget enough pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are anxious, then, to get to New York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, I speak as an engineer, that is all. I am very\r\ncomfortable here, and shall sincerely regret leaving this collection of\r\noriginals which chance has thrown together ... for my recreation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOriginals!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, looking at the passengers who crowded the saloon;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut all those people are very much alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cone can see you have hardly looked at\r\nthem, the species is the same, I allow, but in that species what a\r\nvariety there is! Just notice that group of men down there, with their\r\neasy-going air, their legs stretched on the sofas, and hats screwed down\r\non their heads. They are Yankees, pure Yankees, from the small states of\r\nMaine, Vermont, and Connecticut, the produce of New England. Energetic\r\nand intelligent men, rather too much influenced by \xe2\x80\x98the Reverends,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwho have the disagreeable fault of never putting their hands before\r\ntheir mouths when they sneeze. Ah! my dear sir, they are true Saxons,\r\nalways keenly alive to a bargain; put two Yankees in a room together,\r\nand in an hour they will each have gained ten dollars from the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not ask how,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, smiling at the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut among them\r\nI see a little man with a consequential air, looking like a\r\nweather-cock, and dressed in a long overcoat, with rather short black\r\ntrousers,\xe2\x80\x94who is that gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Protestant minister, a man of \xe2\x80\x98importance\xe2\x80\x99 in Massachusetts,\r\nwhere he is going to join his wife, an ex-governess advantageously\r\nimplicated in a celebrated lawsuit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that tall, gloomy-looking fellow, who seems to be absorbed in\r\ncalculation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat man calculates: in fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9che is for ever\r\ncalculating.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProblems?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, his fortune, he is a man of \xe2\x80\x98importance,\xe2\x80\x99 at any moment he knows\r\nalmost to a farthing what he is worth; he is rich, a fourth part of New\r\nYork is built on his land; a quarter of an hour ago he possessed\r\n1,625,367 dollars and a half, but now he has only 1,625,367 dollars and\r\na quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came this difference in his fortune?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! he has just smoked a quarter-dollar cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoctor Dean Pitferge amused me with his clever repartees, so I pointed\r\nout to him another group stowed away in a corner of the saloon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cTHEY,\xe2\x80\x9d SAID HE, \xe2\x80\x9cARE PEOPLE FROM THE FAR WEST.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9care people from the Far West, the tallest, who looks\r\nlike a head clerk, is a man of \xe2\x80\x98importance,\xe2\x80\x99 the head of a Chicago bank,\r\nhe always carries an album under his arm, with the principal views of\r\nhis beloved city. He is, and has reason to be, proud of a city founded\r\nin a desert in 1836, which at the present day has a population of more\r\nthan 400,000 souls. Near him you see a Californian couple, the young\r\nwife is delicate and charming, her well-polished husband was once a\r\nplough-boy, who one fine day turned up some nuggets. That gentleman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a man of \xe2\x80\x98importance,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cfor his assets count by the\r\nmillion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray who may this tall individual be, who moves his head backwards\r\nand forwards like the pendulum of a clock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat person,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cis the celebrated Cockburn of\r\nRochester, the universal statistician, who has weighed, measured,\r\nproportioned, and calculated everything. Question this harmless maniac,\r\nhe will tell you how much bread a man of fifty has eaten in his life,\r\nand how many cubic feet of air he has breathed. He will tell you how\r\nmany volumes in quarto the words of a Temple lawyer would fill, and how\r\nmany miles the postman goes daily carrying nothing but love-letters; he\r\nwill tell you the number of widows who pass in one hour over London\r\nBridge, and what would be the height of a pile of sandwiches consumed by\r\nthe citizens of the Union in a year; he will tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, in his excitement, would have continued for a long time in\r\nthis strain, but other passengers passing us were attracted by the\r\ninexhaustible stock of his original remarks. What different characters\r\nthere were in this crowd of passengers! not one idler, however, for one\r\ndoes not go from one continent to the other without some serious motive.\r\nThe most part of them were undoubtedly going to seek their fortunes on\r\nAmerican ground, forgetting that at twenty years of age a Yankee has\r\nmade his fortune, and that at twenty-five he is already too old to begin\r\nthe struggle.\r\n\r\nAmong these adventurers, inventors, and fortune-hunters, Dean Pitferge\r\npointed out to me some singularly interesting characters. Here was a\r\nchemist, a rival of Dr. Liebig, who pretended to have discovered the art\r\nof condensing all the nutritious parts of a cow into a meat-tablet, no\r\nlarger than a five-shilling piece. He was going to coin money out of the\r\ncattle of the Pampas. Another, the inventor of a portable motive-power\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsteam horse in a watch-case\xe2\x80\x94was going to exhibit his patent in New\r\nEngland. Another, a Frenchman from the \xe2\x80\x9cRue Chapon,\xe2\x80\x9d was carrying to\r\nAmerica 30,000 cardboard dolls, which said \xe2\x80\x9cpapa\xe2\x80\x9d with a very successful\r\nYankee accent, and he had no doubt but that his fortune was made.\r\n\r\nBut besides these originals, there were still others whose secrets we\r\ncould not guess; perhaps among them was some cashier flying from his\r\nempty cash-box, and a detective making friends with him, only waiting\r\nfor the end of the passage to take him by the collar; perhaps also we\r\nmight have found in this crowd clever genii, who always find people\r\nready to believe in them, even when they advocate the affairs of \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nOceanic Company for lighting Polynesia with gas,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Royal Society\r\nfor making incombustible coal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at this moment my attention was attracted by the entrance of a young\r\ncouple who seemed to be under the influence of a precocious weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are Peruvians, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9ca couple married a\r\nyear ago, who have been to all parts of the world for their honeymoon.\r\nThey adored each other in Japan, loved in Australia, bore with one\r\nanother in India, bored each other in France, quarrelled in England, and\r\nwill undoubtedly separate in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is that tall, haughty-looking man just coming in?\r\nfrom his appearance I should take him for an officer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Mormon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9can elder, Mr. Hatch, one of the\r\ngreat preachers in the city of Saints. What a fine type of manhood he\r\nis! Look at his proud eye, his noble countenance, and dignified bearing,\r\nso different from the Yankee. Mr. Hatch is returning from Germany and\r\nEngland, where he has preached Mormonism with great success, for there\r\nare numbers of this sect in Europe, who are allowed to conform to the\r\nlaws of their country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cI quite thought that polygamy was forbidden them in\r\nEurope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, my dear sir, but do not think that polygamy is obligatory\r\non Mormons; Brigham Young has his harem, because it suits him, but all\r\nhis followers do not imitate him, not even those dwelling on the banks\r\nof the Salt Lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! and Mr. Hatch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hatch has only one wife, and he finds that quite enough; besides,\r\nhe proposes to explain his system in a meeting that he will hold one of\r\nthese evenings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe saloon will be filled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pitferge, \xe2\x80\x9cif the gambling does not attract too many of the\r\naudience; you know that they play in a room at the bows? There is an\r\nEnglishman there with an evil, disagreeable face, who seems to take the\r\nlead among them, he is a bad man, with a detestable reputation. Have you\r\nnoticed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s description, I had no doubt but that he was the same\r\nman who that morning had made himself conspicuous by his foolish wagers\r\nwith regard to the waif. My opinion of him was not wrong. Dean Pitferge\r\ntold me his name was Harry Drake, and that he was the son of a merchant\r\nat Calcutta, a gambler, a dissolute character, a duellist, and now that\r\nhe was almost ruined, he was most likely going to America to try a life\r\nof adventures. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch people,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9calways find followers\r\nwilling to flatter them, and this fellow has already formed his circle\r\nof scamps, of which he is the centre. Among them I have noticed a little\r\nshort man, with a round face, a turned-up nose, wearing gold spectacles,\r\nand having the appearance of a German Jew; he calls himself a doctor, on\r\nthe way to Quebec; but I take him for a low actor and one of Drake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadmirers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dean Pitferge, who easily skipped from one subject to\r\nanother, nudged my elbow. I turned my head towards the saloon door: a\r\nyoung man about twenty-eight, and a girl of seventeen, were coming in\r\narm in arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA newly-married pair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, in a softened tone, \xe2\x80\x9can engaged couple, who\r\nare only waiting for their arrival in New York to get married, they have\r\njust made the tour of Europe, of course with their family\xe2\x80\x99s consent, and\r\nthey know now that they are made for one another. Nice young people; it\r\nis a pleasure to look at them. I often see them leaning over the\r\nrailings of the engine-rooms, counting the turns of the wheels, which do\r\nnot go half fast enough for their liking. Ah! sir, if our boilers were\r\nheated like those two youthful hearts, see how our speed would\r\nincrease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I OFTEN SEE THEM LEANING OVER THE RAILINGS OF THE\r\nENGINE-ROOM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis day, at half-past twelve, a steersman posted up on the grand saloon\r\ndoor the following observation:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat.    51\xc2\xb0 15\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Long.   18\xc2\xb0 13\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Dist.:  Fastenet, 323 miles.\r\n\r\nThis signified that at noon we were three hundred and twenty-three miles\r\nfrom the Fastenet lighthouse, the last which we had passed on the Irish\r\ncoast, and at 51\xc2\xb0 15\xc2\xb4 north latitude, and 18\xc2\xb0 13\xc2\xb4 west longitude, from\r\nthe meridian of Greenwich. It was the ship\xe2\x80\x99s bearing, which the captain\r\nthus made known to the passengers every day. By consulting this bearing,\r\nand referring it to a chart, the course of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d might be\r\nfollowed. Up to this time she had only made three hundred and twenty\r\nmiles in thirty-six hours, it was not satisfactory, for a steamer at its\r\nordinary speed does not go less than three hundred miles in twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAfter having left the Doctor, I spent the rest of the day with Fabian;\r\nwe had gone to the stern, which Pitferge called \xe2\x80\x9cwalking in the\r\ncountry.\xe2\x80\x9d There alone, and leaning over the taffrail, we surveyed the\r\ngreat expanse of water, while around us rose the briny vapours distilled\r\nfrom the spray; small rainbows, formed by the refraction of the sun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrays, spanned the foaming waves. Below us, at a distance of forty feet,\r\nthe screw was beating the water with a tremendous force, making its\r\ncopper gleam in the midst of what appeared to be a vast conglomeration\r\nof liquefied emeralds, the fleecy track extending as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, mingled in a milky path the foam from the screw, and the\r\npaddle engines, whilst the white and black fringed plumage of the\r\nsea-gulls flying above, cast rapid shadows over the sea.\r\n\r\nFabian was looking at the magic of the waves without speaking. What did\r\nhe see in this liquid mirror, which gave scope to the most capricious\r\nflights of imagination? Was some vanished face passing before his eyes,\r\nand bidding him a last farewell? Did he see a drowning shadow in these\r\neddying waters? He seemed to me sadder than usual, and I dared not ask\r\nhim the cause of his grief.\r\n\r\nAfter the long separation which had estranged us from each other, it was\r\nfor him to confide in me, and for me to await his confidences. He had\r\ntold me as much of his past life as he wished me to know; his life in\r\nthe Indian garrison, his hunting, and adventures; but not a word had he\r\nsaid of the emotions which swelled in his heart, or the cause of the\r\nsighs which heaved his breast; undoubtedly Fabian was not one who tried\r\nto lessen his grief by speaking of it, and therefore he suffered the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThus we remained leaning over the sea, and as I turned my head I saw the\r\ngreat paddles emerging under the regular action of the engine.\r\n\r\nOnce Fabian said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cThis track is indeed magnificent. One would\r\nthink that the waves were amusing themselves with tracing letters! Look\r\nat the \xe2\x80\x98l\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98e\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99. Am I deceived? No, they are indeed always the\r\nsame letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFabian\xe2\x80\x99s excited imagination saw in these eddyings that which it wished\r\nto see. But what could these letters signify? What remembrance did they\r\ncall forth in Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s mind? The latter had resumed his silent\r\ncontemplation, when suddenly he said to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to me, come; that gulf will draw me in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, Fabian,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking him by both hands;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pressing his hand on his heart, \xe2\x80\x9cI have here a\r\ndisease which will kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA disease?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him, \xe2\x80\x9ca disease with no hope of cure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd without another word Fabian went to the saloon, and then on to his\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Saturday, 30th of March, the weather was fine, and the sea\r\ncalm; our progress was more rapid, and the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was now going\r\nat the rate of twelve knots an hour.\r\n\r\nThe wind had set south, and the first officer ordered the mizen and the\r\ntop-mast sails to be hoisted, so that the ship was perfectly steady.\r\nUnder this fine sunny sky the upper decks again became crowded; ladies\r\nappeared in fresh costumes, some walking about, others sitting down\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwas going to say on the grass-plats beneath the shady trees, and the\r\nchildren resumed their interrupted games. With a few soldiers in\r\nuniform, strutting about with their hands in their pockets, one might\r\nhave fancied oneself on a French promenade.\r\n\r\nAt noon, the weather being favourable, Captain Anderson and two officers\r\nwent on to the bridge, in order to take the sun\xe2\x80\x99s altitude; each held a\r\nsextant in his hand, and from time to time scanned the southern horizon,\r\ntowards which their horizon-glasses were inclined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoon,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Captain, after a short time.\r\n\r\nImmediately a steersman rang a bell on the bridge, and all the watches\r\non board were regulated by the statement which had just been made.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour later, the following observation was posted up:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                   Lat.    51\xc2\xb0 10\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                   Long.   24\xc2\xb0 13\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                   Course, 227 miles. Distance 550.\r\n\r\nWe had thus made two hundred and twenty-seven miles since noon the day\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nI did not see Fabian once during the day. Several times, uneasy about\r\nhis absence, I passed his cabin, and was convinced that he had not left\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe must have wished to avoid the crowd on deck, and evidently sought to\r\nisolate himself from this tumult. I met Captain Corsican, and for an\r\nhour we walked on the poop. He often spoke of Fabian, and I could not\r\nhelp telling him what had passed between Fabian and myself the evening\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Corsican, with an emotion he did not try to\r\ndisguise. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago Fabian had the right to think himself the\r\nhappiest of men, and now he is the most unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d Archibald Corsican\r\ntold me, in a few words, that at Bombay Fabian had known a charming\r\nyoung girl, a Miss Hodges. He loved her, and was beloved by her. Nothing\r\nseemed to hinder a marriage between Miss Hodges and Captain Mac Elwin;\r\nwhen, by her father\xe2\x80\x99s consent, the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand was sought by the\r\nson of a merchant at Calcutta. It was an old business affair, and\r\nHodges, a harsh, obstinate, and unfeeling man, who happened at this time\r\nto be in a delicate position with his Calcutta correspondent, thinking\r\nthat the marriage would settle everything well, sacrificed his daughter\r\nto the interests of his fortune. The poor child could not resist; they\r\nput her hand into that of the man she did not and could not love, and\r\nwho, from all appearance, had no love for her. It was a mere business\r\ntransaction, and a barbarous deed. The husband carried off his wife the\r\nday after they were married, and since then Fabian has never seen her\r\nwhom he has always loved.\r\n\r\nThis story showed me clearly that the grief which seemed to oppress\r\nFabian was indeed serious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I of Captain Corsican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen Hodges,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen,\xe2\x80\x94that name explains the letters which Fabian thought he saw\r\nyesterday in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s track. And what is the name of this poor young\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s husband?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry Drake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrake!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that man is on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe here!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Corsican, seizing my hand, and looking straight at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9che is on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven grant that they may not meet!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain gravely.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappily they do not know each other, at least Fabian does not know\r\nHarry Drake; but that name uttered in his hearing would be enough to\r\ncause an outburst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI then related to Captain Corsican what I knew of Harry Drake, that is\r\nto say, what Dr. Dean Pitferge had told me of him. I described him such\r\nas he was, an insolent, noisy adventurer, already ruined by gambling,\r\nand other vices, and ready to do anything to get money; at this moment\r\nHarry Drake passed close to us; I pointed him out to the Captain, whose\r\neyes suddenly grew animated, and he made an angry gesture, which I\r\narrested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is the face of a villain. But where is he going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo America, they say, to try and get by chance what he does not care to\r\nwork for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Ellen!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps this wretch has abandoned her, or why should she not be on\r\nboard?\xe2\x80\x9d said Corsican, looking at me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE MADE AN ANGRY GESTURE WHICH I ARRESTED.]\r\n\r\nThis idea crossed my mind for the first time, but I rejected it. No;\r\nEllen was not, could not be on board; she could not have escaped Dr.\r\nPitferge\xe2\x80\x99s inquisitive eye. No! she cannot have accompanied Drake on\r\nthis voyage!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay what you say be true, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Corsican; \xe2\x80\x9cfor the\r\nsight of that poor victim reduced to so much misery would be a terrible\r\nblow to Fabian: I do not know what would happen, for Fabian is a man who\r\nwould kill Drake like a dog. I ask you, as a proof of your friendship,\r\nnever to lose sight of him; so that if anything should happen, one of us\r\nmay be near, to throw ourselves between him and his enemy. You\r\nunderstand a duel must not take place between these two men. Alas!\r\nneither here nor elsewhere. A woman cannot marry her husband\xe2\x80\x99s murderer,\r\nhowever unworthy that husband may have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI well understood Captain Corsican\xe2\x80\x99s reason. Fabian could not be his own\r\njusticiary. It was foreseeing, from a distance, coming events, but how\r\nis it that the uncertainty of human things is so little taken into\r\naccount? A presentiment was boding in my mind. Could it be possible,\r\nthat in this common life on board, in this every-day mingling together,\r\nthat Drake\xe2\x80\x99s noisy personality could remain unnoticed by Fabian? An\r\naccident, a trifle, a mere name uttered, would it not bring them face to\r\nface? Ah! how I longed to hasten the speed of the steamer which carried\r\nthem both! Before leaving Captain Corsican I promised to keep a watch on\r\nour friend, and to observe Drake, whom on his part he engaged not to\r\nlose sight of; then he shook my hand, and we parted.\r\n\r\nTowards evening a dense mist swept over the ocean, and the darkness was\r\nintense. The brilliantly-lighted saloons contrasted singularly with the\r\nblackness of the night. Waltzes and ballad songs followed each other;\r\nall received with frantic applause, and even hurrahs were not wanting,\r\nwhen the actor from T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, sitting at the piano, bawled his songs with the\r\nself-possession of a strolling player.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 31st of March, was Sunday. How would this day be kept\r\non board? Would it be the English or American Sunday, which closes the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbars\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9ctaps\xe2\x80\x9d during service hours; which withholds the\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s hand from his victim; which keeps the baker\xe2\x80\x99s shovel from the\r\noven; which causes a suspension of business; extinguishes the fires of\r\nthe manufactories; which closes the shops, opens the churches, and\r\nmoderates the speed of the railway trains, contrary to the customs in\r\nFrance? Yes, it must be kept thus, or almost thus.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, during the service, although the weather was fine, and we\r\nmight have gained some knots, the Captain did not order the sails to be\r\nhoisted, as it would have been \xe2\x80\x9cimproper.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought myself very\r\nfortunate that the screw was allowed to continue its work, and when I\r\ninquired of a fierce Puritan the reason for this tolerance, \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat which comes directly from God must be respected; the\r\nwind is in His hand, the steam is in the power of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was willing to content myself with this reason, and in the meantime\r\nobserved what was going on on board.\r\n\r\nAll the crew were in full uniform, and dressed with extreme propriety. I\r\nshould not have been surprised to see the stokers working in black\r\nclothes; the officers and engineers wore their finest uniforms, with\r\ngilt buttons; their shoes shone with a British lustre, and rivalled\r\ntheir glazed hats with an intense irradiation. All these good people\r\nseemed to have hats and boots of a dazzling brightness. The Captain and\r\nthe first officer set the example, and with new gloves and military\r\nattire, glittering and perfumed, they paced up and down the bridges\r\nawaiting the hour for service.\r\n\r\nThe sea was magnificent and resplendent beneath the first rays of a\r\nspring sun; not a sail in sight. The \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d occupied alone the\r\ncentre of the immense expanse. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the bell on deck tolled\r\nslowly and at regular intervals; the ringer, who was a steersman,\r\ndressed in his best, managed to obtain from this bell a kind of solemn,\r\nreligious tone, instead of the metallic peals with which it accompanied\r\nthe whistling of the boilers, when the ship was surrounded by fog.\r\nInvoluntarily one looked for the village steeple which was calling to\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nAt this moment numerous groups appeared at the doors of the cabins, at\r\nthe bows and stern; the boulevards were soon filled with men, women, and\r\nchildren carefully dressed for the occasion. Friends exchanged quiet\r\ngreetings; every one held a Prayer-book in his hand, and all were\r\nwaiting for the last bell which would announce the beginning of service.\r\nI saw also piles of Bibles, which were to be distributed in the church,\r\nheaped upon trays generally used for sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe church was the great saloon, formed by the upper deck at the stern,\r\nthe exterior of which, from its width and regularity of structure,\r\nreminded one very much of the hotel of the Minist\xc3\xa8re des Finances, in\r\nthe Rue de Rivoli. I entered. Numbers of the faithful were already in\r\ntheir places. A profound silence reigned among the congregation; the\r\nofficers occupied the apsis of the church, and, in the midst of them,\r\nstood Captain Anderson, as pastor. My friend Dean Pitferge was near him,\r\nhis quick little eyes running over the whole assembly. I will venture to\r\nsay he was there more out of curiosity than anything else.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten the Captain rose, and the service began; he read a\r\nchapter from the Old Testament. After each verse the congregation\r\nmurmured the one following; the shrill soprano voices of the women and\r\nchildren distinctly separate from the baritone of the men. This Biblical\r\ndialogue lasted for about half-an-hour, and the simple, at the same time\r\nimpressive ceremony, was performed with a puritanical gravity. Captain\r\nAnderson assuming the office of pastor on board, in the midst of the\r\nvast ocean, and speaking to a crowd of listeners, hanging, as it were,\r\nover the verge of an abyss, claimed the respect and attention of the\r\nmost indifferent. It would have been well if the service had concluded\r\nwith the reading; but when the Captain had finished a speaker arose, who\r\ncould not fail to arouse feelings of violence and rebellion where\r\ntolerance and meditation should reign.\r\n\r\nIt was the reverend gentleman of whom I have before spoken\xe2\x80\x94a little,\r\nfidgety man, an intriguing Yankee; one of those ministers who exercise\r\nsuch a powerful influence over the States of New England. His sermon was\r\nalready prepared, the occasion was good, and he intended to make use of\r\nit. Would not the good Yorrick have done the same? I looked at Dean\r\nPitferge; the Doctor did not frown, but seemed inclined to try the\r\npreacher\xe2\x80\x99s zeal.\r\n\r\nThe latter gravely buttoned his black overcoat, placed his silk cap on\r\nthe table, drew out his handkerchief, with which he touched his lips\r\nlightly, and taking in the assembly at a glance\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cGod created America, and rested on the\r\nseventh day.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nThereupon I reached the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt lunch Dean Pitferge told me that the reverend gentleman had admirably\r\nenlarged on his text. Battering rams, armed forts, and submarine\r\ntorpedoes had figured in his discourse; as for himself, he was made\r\ngreat by the greatness of America. If it pleases America to be thus\r\nextolled, I have nothing to say.\r\n\r\nEntering the grand saloon, I read the following note:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat     50\xc2\xb0 8\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Long.   30\xc2\xb0 44\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Course, 255 miles.\r\n\r\nAlways the same result. We had only made eleven hundred miles, including\r\nthe three hundred and ten between Fastenet and Liverpool, about a third\r\npart of our voyage. During the remainder of the day officers, sailors,\r\nand passengers continued to rest in accordance with established custom.\r\nNot a piano sounded in the silent saloons; the chess-men did not leave\r\ntheir box, or the cards their case; the billiard-room was deserted. I\r\nhad an opportunity this day to introduce Dean Pitferge to Captain\r\nCorsican. My original very much amused the Captain by telling him the\r\nstories whispered about the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern.\xe2\x80\x9d He attempted to prove to\r\nhim that it was a bewitched ship, to which fatal misfortune must happen.\r\nThe yarn of the melted engineer greatly pleased the Captain, who, being\r\na Scotchman, was a lover of the marvellous, but he could not repress an\r\nincredulous smile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cI SEE\xe2\x80\x9d SAID DR. PITFERGE.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Pitferge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Captain has not much faith in my\r\nstories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch! that is saying a great deal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Corsican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you believe me, Captain, if I affirm that this ship is haunted at\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor, in a serious tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaunted!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat next? Ghosts? and you believe in\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pitferge, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe what people who can be\r\ndepended on have told me. Now, I know some of the officers on watch, and\r\nthe sailors also, are quite unanimous on this point, that during the\r\ndarkness of the night a shadow, a vague form, walks the ship. How it\r\ncomes there they do not know, neither do they know how it disappears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy St. Dunstan!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Corsican, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will watch it well\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, if you like; and you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Captain, turning to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwill you keep us company?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to trouble the solitude of this phantom;\r\nbesides, I would rather think that our Doctor is joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not joking,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the obstinate Pitferge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really believe in the dead coming back\r\nto the decks of ships?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in the dead who come to life again,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthis is the more astonishing as I am a physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA physician!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain, drawing back as if the word had made\r\nhim uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, smiling, good-humouredly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t practise while travelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 1st of April, the aspect of the sea was truly\r\nspring-like; it was as green as the meadows beneath the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays. This\r\nApril sunrise on the Atlantic was superb; the waves spread themselves\r\nout voluptuously, while porpoises gambolled in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s milky track.\r\n\r\nWhen I met Captain Corsican, he informed me that the ghost announced by\r\nthe Doctor had not thought proper to make its appearance. Undoubtedly,\r\nthe night was not dark enough for it. Then the idea crossed my mind that\r\nit was a joke of Dean Pitferge\xe2\x80\x99s, sanctioned by the 1st of April; for in\r\nAmerica, England, and France this custom is very popular. Mystifiers and\r\nmystified were not wanting; some laughed, others were angry; I even\r\nbelieve that blows were exchanged among some of the Saxons, but these\r\nblows never ended in fighting; for it is well known that in England\r\nduels are liable to very severe punishment; even officers and soldiers\r\nare not allowed to fight under any pretext whatever. The homicide is\r\nsubject to the most painful and ignominious punishments. I remember the\r\nDoctor telling me the name of an officer who was sent to a convict\r\nprison, for ten years, for having mortally wounded his adversary in a\r\nvery honourable engagement. One can understand, that in face of this\r\nsevere law duels have entirely disappeared from British customs.\r\n\r\nThe weather being so fine, a good observation could be made, which\r\nresulted in the following statement: Lat. 48\xc2\xb0 47\xc2\xb4, and 36\xc2\xb0 48\xc2\xb4 W. L.;\r\ndist., 250 miles only. The slowest of the Transatlantic steamers would\r\nhave had the right to offer to take us in tow. This state of things very\r\nmuch annoyed Captain Anderson. The engineers attributed the failure of\r\npressure to the insufficient ventilation of the new furnaces; but for my\r\npart, I thought that the diminution of speed was owing to the diameter\r\nof the wheels having been imprudently made smaller.\r\n\r\nHowever, to-day, about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, there was an improvement in the\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s speed; it was the attitude of the two young lovers which revealed\r\nthis change to me. Leaning against the bulwarks, they murmured joyful\r\nwords, clapped their hands, and looked smilingly at the escape-pipes,\r\nwhich were placed near the chimneys, the apertures of which were crowned\r\nwith a white wreath of vapour. The pressure had risen in the screw\r\nboilers; as yet it was only a feeble breath of air, a wavering blast;\r\nbut our young friends drank it in eagerly with their eyes. No, not even\r\nDenis Papin could have been more delighted, when he saw the steam half\r\nraise the lid of his celebrated saucepan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey smoke! they smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, whilst a light breath\r\nalso escaped from her parted lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and look at the engine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, placing her arm\r\nin his.\r\n\r\nDean Pitferge had joined me, and we followed the loving couple on to the\r\nupper deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful is youth!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyouth affianced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon we also were leaning over the railing of the engine-rooms. There,\r\nin the deep abyss, at a distance of sixty feet below us, we saw the four\r\nlong horizontal pistons swaying one towards the other, and with each\r\nmovement moistened by drops of lubricating oil.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the young man had taken out his watch, and the girl,\r\nleaning over his shoulder, followed the movement of the minute-hand,\r\nwhilst her lover counted the revolutions of the screw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-seven turns,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-seven and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Doctor, who had entered into the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a half,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear, Edward! Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, favouring the worthy Pitferge with one of her most pleasing\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing back to the grand saloon, I saw the following programme posted on\r\nthe door:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THIS NIGHT!\r\n\r\n                               PART FIRST\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Time\xe2\x80\x9d                        Mr. Mac Alpine.\r\n        Song: \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful Isle of the Sea\xe2\x80\x9d   Mr. Ewing.\r\n        Reading                             Mr. Affleet.\r\n        Piano solo: \xe2\x80\x9cChant du Berger\xe2\x80\x9d       Mrs. Alloway.\r\n        Scotch Song                         Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\n                        (Ten minutes interval.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PART SECOND.\r\n\r\n        Piano solo                          Mr. Paul V\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n        Burlesque: \xe2\x80\x9cLady of Lyons\xe2\x80\x9d          Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n        Entertainment                       Sir James Anderson.\r\n        Song: \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Moment\xe2\x80\x9d                Mr. Norville.\r\n        Song: \xe2\x80\x9cYou Remember\xe2\x80\x9d                Mr. Ewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FINALE.\r\n\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x9cGOD SAVE THE QUEEN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, it was a complete concert, with a first part, entr\xe2\x80\x99acte,\r\nsecond part, and finale; but it seems there was something wanting in the\r\nprogramme; for I heard some one mutter behind me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat! no\r\nMendelssohn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned, and saw that it was a steward, who thus protested against the\r\nomission of his favourite music.\r\n\r\nI went on deck, and began to look for Mac Elwin. Corsican had just told\r\nme that Fabian had left his cabin, and I wanted, without intruding\r\nmyself on him, to draw him out of his isolation. I found him at the\r\nbows; we talked for some time, but he made no allusion to his past life.\r\nAt times he was silent and pensive, absorbed in his thoughts, no longer\r\nlistening to me, and pressing his breast, as if to restrain a painful\r\nspasm.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were walking together, Harry Drake passed us several times,\r\nalways the same noisy, gesticulating man, obstructive as would be a\r\nwindmill in a ball-room. Was I mistaken? I could not say; for I had\r\nalready anticipated it in my mind; but it seemed to me that Harry Drake\r\nstared at Fabian with a persistency which the latter must have noticed;\r\nfor he said to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like his looks,\xe2\x80\x9d added Fabian.\r\n\r\nPut two ships in the open sea, without wind or tide, and, at last, they\r\nwill come together. Throw two planets into space, and they will fall one\r\non the other. Place two enemies in the midst of a crowd, and they will\r\ninevitably meet; it is a fatality, a question of time, that is all.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the concert took place according to the programme; the\r\ngrand saloon, filled with the audience, was brilliantly lighted. Through\r\nthe half-open hatchways might be seen the broad, sunburnt faces, and the\r\ngreat black hands of the sailors; the doorways were crowded with\r\nstewards; the greater part of the audience\xe2\x80\x94men and women\xe2\x80\x94were seated on\r\nside sofas, and in the centre of the saloon, in arm-chairs and lounges,\r\nall facing the piano, firmly fastened between the two doors, which\r\nopened into the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 saloon. From time to time a rolling motion\r\ndisturbed the audience; arm-chairs and folding-chairs glided about, a\r\nkind of swell caused a similar undulatory movement to all; they caught\r\nhold of one another silently, and without making any joke; but upon the\r\nwhole there was not much fear of falling, thanks to the subsidence.\r\n\r\nThe concert opened with the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Times.\xe2\x80\x9d The \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Times\xe2\x80\x9d was a daily\r\nnewspaper, political, commercial, and literary, which certain passengers\r\nhad started for the requirements on board. Americans and English took to\r\nthis sort of pastime; they wrote out their sheet during the day; and let\r\nme say, that if the editors were not particular, as to the quality of\r\ntheir articles, their readers were not more so. They were content with\r\nlittle, even with \xe2\x80\x9cnot enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis number for the 1st of April contained a \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d leader\xe2\x80\x94tame\r\nenough, on general politics\xe2\x80\x94also various facts quite uninteresting to a\r\nFrenchman; articles on the money-markets, not particularly comic;\r\ncurious telegrams, and some rather insipid home news. After all this\r\nkind of fun is only amusing to those who make it. The Honourable Mac\r\nAlpine, a dogmatical American, read, with earnest gravity, some rather\r\ndull lucubrations, which were received by his audience with great\r\napplause. He finished his reading with the following news:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is announced that President Johnson has resigned in favour of\r\nGeneral Grant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that Fernando Cortez is going to attack the Emperor Napoleon\r\nthe Third, piratically, out of revenge for the latter\xe2\x80\x99s conquest of\r\nMexico.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are told for a certainty that Pope Pius IX. has designated the\r\nPrince Imperial as his successor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Times\xe2\x80\x9d had been sufficiently applauded, the Honourable\r\nMr. Ewing, a fine-looking young fellow, with a tenor voice, warbled\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful Isle of the Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d with all the harshness of an English\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FINE-LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW.]\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9creading\xe2\x80\x9d appeared to me to have a questionable charm; it was simply\r\ntwo or three pages of a book, read by a worthy Texian, who began in a\r\nlow voice, and gradually got higher and higher; he also was very much\r\napplauded.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cShepherd\xe2\x80\x99s Song,\xe2\x80\x9d a piano solo, by Mrs. Alloway, and a Scotch song,\r\nsung by Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, concluded the first part of the programme.\r\n\r\nAfter the ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 interval, during which some of the audience left\r\ntheir seats, the second part of the concert began. The Frenchman, Paul\r\nV\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, played some charming waltzes, which were noisily encored. One of\r\nthe ship\xe2\x80\x99s doctors on board, a very conceited young man, recited a\r\nburlesque scene, a kind of parody on the \xe2\x80\x9cLady of Lyons,\xe2\x80\x9d a drama very\r\nmuch in vogue in England.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cburlesque\xe2\x80\x9d was succeeded by the \xe2\x80\x9centertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d What had Sir James\r\nAnderson prepared under this name? Was it a conference or a sermon?\r\nNeither the one nor the other. Sir James Anderson rose smilingly, drew a\r\npack of cards from his pocket, turned back his white cuffs, and\r\nperformed some tricks, the simplicity of which was redeemed by the\r\ngraceful manner in which they were done. Hurrahs and applause.\r\n\r\nAfter the \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Moment,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou Remember,\xe2\x80\x9d sung by Mr. Norville and\r\nMr. Ewing, the programme announced \xe2\x80\x9cGod Save the Queen;\xe2\x80\x9d but some\r\nAmericans begged Paul V\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, as he was a Frenchman, to play the national\r\nFrench Anthem. Immediately my agreeable countryman began the inevitable\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPartant pour la Syrie.\xe2\x80\x9d Energetic demands from a party of north-men,\r\nwho wished to hear the \xe2\x80\x9cMarseillaise,\xe2\x80\x9d and without being pressed\r\nfurther, the obedient pianist, with a compliance which betokened rather\r\na musical facility than political convictions, vigorously attacked the\r\nsong of Rouget de l\xe2\x80\x99Ile.\r\n\r\nThis was the grand success of the evening, and the assembly, standing,\r\nslowly sang the \xe2\x80\x9cNational Anthem,\xe2\x80\x9d which prays God to bless the Queen.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole this soir\xc3\xa9e was as good as amateur soir\xc3\xa9es generally are;\r\nthat is to say, it was chiefly a success for the performers and their\r\nfriends. Fabian did not show himself there at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring Monday night the sea was very stormy. Once more the partitions\r\nbegan creaking, and again the luggage made its way through the saloons.\r\nWhen I went on deck, about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the wind had\r\nfreshened, and it was raining. The officer on watch had ordered the\r\nsails to be taken in, so that the steam-ship, left without any support,\r\nrolled dreadfully. All this day, the 2nd of April, the deck was\r\ndeserted, even the saloons were empty, for the passengers had taken\r\nrefuge in their cabins; and two-thirds of the guests were missing at\r\nlunch and dinner. Whist was impossible, for the tables glided from under\r\nthe players\xe2\x80\x99 hands. The chess-men were unmanageable. A few of the more\r\nfearless stretched themselves on the sofas, reading or sleeping, as many\r\npreferred to brave the rain on deck, where the sailors, in their\r\noil-skin jackets and glazed hats, were sedately pacing to and fro. The\r\nfirst officer, well wrapped in his macintosh, and perched on the bridge,\r\nwas on watch, and in the midst of the hurricane his small eyes sparkled\r\nwith delight. This was what the little man loved, and the steamer rolled\r\nto his liking.\r\n\r\nThe water from the skies and sea mingled in a dense fog. The atmosphere\r\nwas grey, and birds flew screeching through the damp mists. At ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock a three-mast ship was hailed, sailing astern of us, but her\r\nnationality could not be recognized.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the wind abated, and veered to the north-west.\r\nThe rain ceased, almost suddenly, blue sky appeared through the opening\r\nin the clouds, the sun shone out again, and permitted a more or less\r\nperfect observation to be made, which was posted up as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat.    46\xc2\xb0 29\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Long.   42\xc2\xb0 25\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Dist.,  356 miles.\r\n\r\nSo that, although the pressure of the boilers had risen, the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeed had not increased; but this might be attributed to the westerly\r\nwind, which caught the ship ahead, and considerably impeded her\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock the fog grew dense again, the wind fell and rose at the\r\nsame time. The thickness of the fog was so intense that the officers on\r\nthe bridge could not see the men at the bows. These accumulated vapours\r\nrising from the sea constitute the greatest danger of navigation. They\r\ncause accidents which it is impossible to avoid, and a collision at sea\r\nis more to be dreaded than a fire.\r\n\r\nThus, in the midst of the fog, officers and sailors were obliged to keep\r\na strict watch, which soon proved to be necessary, for about three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock a three-master appeared at less than two hundred yards from the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d her sails disabled by a gust of wind, and no longer\r\nanswering to her helm. The \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d turned in time to avoid her,\r\nthanks to the promptitude with which the men on watch warned the\r\nsteersman. These well-regulated signals are given by means of a bell,\r\nfastened to the poop at the bows. One ring signifies ship ahead; two,\r\nship-starboard; three, ship a-larboard; and immediately the man at the\r\nhelm steers in order to avoid a collision.\r\n\r\nThe wind did not abate until evening; however the rolling was nothing to\r\nspeak of, as the sea was protected by the Newfoundland heights. Another\r\nentertainment, by Sir James Anderson, was announced for this day. At the\r\nappointed hour the saloon was filled; but this time it had nothing to do\r\nwith cards. Sir James Anderson told us the history of the Transatlantic\r\nCable, which he had himself laid. He showed us photographs representing\r\nthe different engines used for the immersion. He sent round a model of\r\nthe splice which was used to fasten together the pieces of cable.\r\nFinally, very justly merited, the three cheers with which his lecture\r\nwas received, a great part of which was meant for the Honourable Cyrus\r\nField, promoter of the enterprise, who was present on this occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 3rd of April, from early dawn the horizon wore that\r\npeculiar aspect which the English call \xe2\x80\x9cblink.\xe2\x80\x9d It was of that misty\r\nwhite colour which signifies that icebergs are not far distant; in fact\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was ploughing those seas on which float the first\r\nblocks of ice detached from the icebergs in Davis\xe2\x80\x99 Straits. A special\r\nwatch was kept, in order to avoid the rude collision with these enormous\r\nblocks.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong westerly wind blowing; strips of clouds, or rather\r\nshreds of vapour, hung over the sea, through which glimpses of blue sky\r\nappeared. A dull thudding noise came from the waves tossed by the wind,\r\nand drops of water, seemingly pulverized, evaporated in foam.\r\n\r\nNeither Fabian, Captain Corsican, nor Doctor Pitferge had yet come on\r\ndeck, so I went towards the bows, where the junction of the bulwarks\r\nformed a comfortable angle, a kind of retreat, in which like a hermit,\r\none could retire from the world. I took my place in this corner, sitting\r\non a skylight, and my feet resting on an enormous pulley; the wind being\r\ndead ahead passed over without touching me. This was a good place for\r\nreflection. From here I had a view of the whole immensity of the ship; I\r\ncould see the long slanting ropes of the rigging at the stern. On the\r\nfirst level a top-man, hanging in the mizen-shrouds, held himself up\r\nwith one hand, whilst with the other he worked with a remarkable\r\ndexterity. On the deck below him paced the officer on watch, peering\r\nthrough the mists. On the bridge, at the stern, I caught a glimpse of an\r\nofficer, his back rounded, and his head muffled in a hood, struggling\r\nagainst the gusts of wind. I could distinguish nothing of the sea,\r\nexcept a bluish horizontal line discernible behind the paddles. Urged on\r\nby her powerful engines, the narrow stem of the steam-ship cut the\r\nwaves, with a hissing sound, like that when the sides of a boiler are\r\nheated by a roaring fire. But the colossal ship, with the wind ahead,\r\nand borne on three waves, hardly felt the movement of the sea, which\r\nwould have shaken any other steamer with its pitchings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIS BACK ROUNDED, AND HIS HEAD MUFFLED IN A HOOD.]\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve the notice stated that we were in 44\xc2\xb0 53\xc2\xb4 North\r\nlat., and 47\xc2\xb0 6\xc2\xb4 W. long., and had made two hundred and twenty-seven\r\nmiles in twenty-four hours only. The young couple must have scolded the\r\nwheels which did not turn, and the steam which was not at all strong\r\nenough to please them.\r\n\r\nAbout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the sky, swept by the wind, cleared up; the line of\r\nthe horizon was once more clearly defined, the wind fell, but for a long\r\nwhile the sea rose in great foam-crested billows. Such a gentle breeze\r\ncould not cause this swell; one might have said that the Atlantic was\r\nstill sulky.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-five minutes to four a three-mast ship was hailed to larboard.\r\nShe hoisted her name; it was the \xe2\x80\x9cIllinois,\xe2\x80\x9d an American ship, on her\r\nway to England.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Lieutenant H\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 informed me that we were passing Cape Race\r\npoint. We were now in the rich coasts where are obtained cod-fish, three\r\nof which would suffice to supply England and America if all the roe were\r\nhatched. The day passed without any remarkable occurrence; no accident\r\nhad as yet thrown Fabian and Harry Drake together, for the Captain and I\r\nnever lost sight of them. In the evening the same harmless amusement,\r\nthe same reading, and songs in the grand saloon called forth, as usual,\r\nfrantic applauses. As an extraordinary occurrence a lively discussion\r\nbroke out between a Northerner and a Texian. The latter demanded an\r\nEmperor for the Southern States. Happily this political discussion,\r\nwhich threatened to degenerate into a quarrel, was put an end to by the\r\ntimely arrival of an imaginary despatch, addressed to the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Times,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand conceived in these terms: \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Semmes, Minister of War, has made\r\nthe South compensate for its ravages in Alabama.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving the brilliantly lighted saloon I went on deck with Captain\r\nCorsican. The night was dark; not a star in the firmament; an\r\nimpenetrable gloom surrounded the ship. The windows of the saloon shone\r\nlike the mouths of furnaces; the man on watch, heavily pacing the poop,\r\nwas scarcely discernible, but one could breathe the fresh air, and the\r\nCaptain inhaled it with expanded lungs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was stifled in the saloon,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chere at least I can breathe. I\r\nrequire my hundred cubic yards of pure air every twenty-four hours, or I\r\nget half suffocated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreathe, Captain, breathe at your ease,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him; \xe2\x80\x9cthe breeze\r\ndoes not stint your wants. Oxygen is a good thing, but it must be\r\nconfessed Parisians and Londoners know it only by reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand they prefer carbonic acid. Ah well!\r\nevery one to his liking; for my own part I detest it, even in\r\nchampagne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus talking, we paced up and down the deck on the starboard side,\r\nsheltered from the wind by the high partitions of the deck cabins. Great\r\nwreaths of smoke, illuminated with sparks, curled from the black\r\nchimneys; the noise of the engines accompanied the whistling of the wind\r\nin the shrouds, which sounded like the cords of a harp. Mingling with\r\nthis hubbub, each quarter of an hour, came the cry of the sailors on\r\ndeck, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\xe2\x80\x99s well, all\xe2\x80\x99s well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact no precaution had been neglected to insure the safety of the\r\nship on these coasts frequented by icebergs. The Captain had a bucket of\r\nwater drawn every half-hour, in order to ascertain the temperature, and\r\nif it had fallen one degree he immediately changed his course, for he\r\nknew that the \xe2\x80\x9cPeruvian\xe2\x80\x9d had been seen but a fortnight since blocked up\r\nby icebergs in this latitude; it was therefore a danger to be avoided.\r\nHis orders for night were to keep a strict look-out. He himself remained\r\non the bridge with an officer each side of him, one at the wheel signal,\r\nthe other at the screw; besides these a lieutenant and two men kept\r\nwatch on the poop, whilst a quarter-master with a sailor stood at the\r\nstern; the passengers might therefore rest quietly.\r\n\r\nAfter noticing these arrangements we went back again to the stern, as we\r\nhad made up our minds to stay some time longer, walking on deck like\r\npeaceful citizens taking an evening stroll in their town squares.\r\n\r\nThe place seemed deserted. Soon, however, our eyes grew accustomed to\r\nthe darkness, and we perceived a man leaning perfectly motionless, with\r\nhis elbow on the railing. Corsican, after looking at him attentively for\r\nsome time, said to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Fabian.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Fabian. We recognized him, but absorbed as he was in a\r\nprofound contemplation he did not see us. His eyes were fixed on an\r\nangle of the upper deck; I saw them gleam in the dark. What was he\r\nlooking at? How could he pierce this black gloom? I thought it better to\r\nleave him to his reflections, but Captain Corsican went up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFabian,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nFabian did not answer; he had not heard. Again Corsican called him. He\r\nshuddered, and turned his head for a moment, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen with his hand he pointed to a shadow which was slowly moving at the\r\nfurther end of the upper deck. It was this almost invisible figure that\r\nFabian was looking at, and smiling sadly he murmured,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe black lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shuddered. Captain Corsican took hold of my arm, and I felt that he\r\nalso was trembling. The same thought had struck us both. This shadow was\r\nthe apparition about which Dean Pitferge had spoken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLACK LADY.]\r\n\r\nFabian had relapsed into his dreamy contemplation. I, with a heaving\r\nbreast and awe-struck glance, looked at this human figure, the outline\r\nof which was hardly discernible; but presently it became more defined.\r\nIt came forward, stopped, turned back, and then again advanced, seeming\r\nto glide rather than walk. At ten steps from us it stood perfectly\r\nstill. I was then able to distinguish the figure of a slender female,\r\nclosely wrapped in a kind of brown burnous, and her face covered with a\r\nthick veil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mad woman, a mad woman, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Fabian.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a mad woman; but Fabian was not asking us: he was\r\nspeaking to himself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the poor creature came still nearer to us. I thought I\r\ncould see her eyes sparkle through her veil, when they were fixed on\r\nFabian. She went up to him, Fabian started to his feet, electrified. The\r\nveiled woman put her hand on her heart as though counting its pulsation,\r\nthen, gliding swiftly away, she disappeared behind the angle of the\r\nupper deck. Fabian staggered, and fell on his knees, his hands stretched\r\nout before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is she,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\nThen shaking his head,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an hallucination!\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corsican then took him by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Fabian, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and he led away his unhappy friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorsican and I could no longer doubt but that it was Ellen, Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetrothed, and Harry Drake\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Chance had brought all three together\r\non the same ship. Fabian had not recognized her, although he had cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is she, it is she!\xe2\x80\x9d and how was it possible that he could have done\r\nso? But he was not mistaken in saying, \xe2\x80\x9cA mad woman!\xe2\x80\x9d Ellen was mad,\r\nundoubtedly; grief, despair, love frozen in her heart, contact with the\r\nworthless man who had snatched her from Fabian, ruin, misery, and shame\r\nhad broken her spirit. It was on this subject that Corsican and I spoke\r\nthe following morning. We had no doubt as to the identity of the young\r\nwoman; it was Ellen, whom Harry Drake was dragging with him to the\r\nAmerican continent. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s eyes glowed with a dark fire at the\r\nthought of this wretch, and I felt my heart stir within me. What were we\r\nagainst the husband, the master? Nothing. But now, what was most\r\nimportant, was to prevent another meeting between Fabian and Ellen, for\r\nFabian could not fail at last to recognize his betrothed, and thus the\r\ncatastrophe we wished to avoid would be brought about.\r\n\r\nAt the same time we had reason to hope that these two poor creatures\r\nwould not see each other again, as the unhappy Ellen never appeared in\r\nthe daytime, either in the saloons or on the deck. Only at night,\r\nperhaps eluding her gaoler, she came out to bathe herself in the damp\r\nair, and demand of the wind a smooth passage. In four days, at the\r\nlatest, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d must reach New York harbour; therefore we\r\nmight hope that accident would not dally with our watchfulness, and that\r\nFabian would not discover Ellen during this time; but we made our\r\ncalculations without thinking of events.\r\n\r\nThe steamer\xe2\x80\x99s course had been slightly altered in the night, three times\r\nthe ship, being in water twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\nfive degrees below zero, had been turned towards the south. There was no\r\nlonger any doubt of icebergs being very near, for the sky that morning\r\nhad a peculiarly brilliant aspect; the atmosphere was misty, and the\r\nnorthern sky glittered with an intense reverberation, evidently produced\r\nby the powerful reflection from the icebergs. There was a piercing wind,\r\nand about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the deck was powdered by a slight snow-fall; then\r\ndense fog surrounded us, in which we gave warning of our approach, by\r\ndeafening whistles, which scared away the flocks of sea-gulls in the\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s yards. At half-past ten, the fog having cleared off, a screw\r\nsteamer appeared on the horizon, a-starboard, the white tops of her\r\nchimneys indicating that she was an emigrant ship, belonging to the\r\nInman Company.\r\n\r\nBefore lunch several of the passengers organized a pool, which could not\r\nfail to please those fond of betting and gambling. The result of this\r\npool was not to be known for four days; it was what is called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpilot\xe2\x80\x99s pool.\xe2\x80\x9d When a ship arrives at the land-falls every one knows\r\nthat a pilot comes on board; so they divide the twenty-four hours of the\r\nday and night into forty-eight half-hours, or ninety-six quarters,\r\naccording to the number of the passengers. Each player stakes one\r\ndollar, and draws one of the half or quarter hours: the winner of the\r\nforty-eight or ninety-six dollars is the one during whose quarter of an\r\nhour the pilot comes on board. From this it may be seen that the game is\r\nvery simple; it is not a race-course, but a quarter-of-an-hour race.\r\n\r\nIt was a Canadian, the Honourable MacAlpine, who undertook the\r\nmanagement of the affair. He easily collected ninety-six players,\r\nincluding several professed gamblers, not the least among those ready\r\nfor gain. I, following the general example, staked my dollar, and fate\r\nallotted me the ninety-fourth quarter; it was a bad number, and one\r\nwhich left me no chance of profit. The fact is, these divisions are\r\nreckoned from noon to noon, so that there are night as well as day\r\nquarters; and as it is very seldom that ships venture close in in the\r\ndark, the chance of a pilot coming on board then is very small. However,\r\nI easily consoled myself. Going down into the saloon, I saw a lecture\r\nannounced. The Utah missionary was going to hold a meeting on Mormonism;\r\na good opportunity for those wishing to initiate themselves in the\r\nmysteries of the City of Saints; besides, this Elder, Mr. Hatch, was an\r\norator of no mean power. The execution could not fail to be worthy of\r\nthe work. The announcement of the conference was received very\r\nfavourably by the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe observation posted up was as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat.    42\xc2\xb0 32\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Long.   51\xc2\xb0 59\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Course, 254 miles.\r\n\r\nAbout three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon the steersman signaled a large\r\nfour-mast steamer, which slightly changed its course, in order to give\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d its number. It was the \xe2\x80\x9cAtlanta,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the largest\r\nboats running between London and New York, calling at Brest on the way.\r\nAfter having saluted us, which we returned, in a short time she was out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dean Pitferge, in a vexed tone, informed me that Mr.\r\nHatch\xe2\x80\x99s lecture was forbidden, as the wives of the puritans on board did\r\nnot approve of their husbands becoming acquainted with the mysteries of\r\nMormonism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the sky, which had been overcast, cleared up, the sea\r\ngrew calm, and the ship was so steady, one might almost have thought\r\noneself on _terra firma_\xe2\x80\x94this gave the passengers the idea of getting up\r\nraces. Epsom turf could not have afforded a better coursing-ground, and\r\nas for horses, they were well replaced by pure Scotchmen, as good as any\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGladiator,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLa Touque.\xe2\x80\x9d The news soon spread, sportsmen immediately\r\nhurried to the field. An Englishman, the Hon. J. Mac Carthy, was\r\nappointed commissioner, and the competitors presented themselves without\r\ndelay. They were half a dozen sailors, kind of centaurs, man and horse\r\nat the same time, all ready to try for the prize.\r\n\r\nThe two boulevards formed the race-course, the runners were to go three\r\ntimes round the ship, thus making a course of about 1300 yards, which\r\nwas quite enough. Soon the galleries were invaded by crowds of\r\nspectators, all armed with opera-glasses. Some of them had hoisted the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgreen sail,\xe2\x80\x9d no doubt to shelter themselves from the spray of the\r\nAtlantic. Carriages were missing, I must confess, but not the rank,\r\nwhere they might have ranged in file. Ladies in gay costumes were\r\nhurrying on to the upper decks; the scene was charming.\r\n\r\nFabian, Captain Corsican, Dr. Pitferge and I had taken our places on the\r\npoop, which was what might be called the centre of action. Here the real\r\ngentlemen riders were assembled; in front of us was the starting and\r\nwinning post. Betting soon began with a true British animation.\r\nConsiderable sums of money were staked, but only from the appearance of\r\nthe racers, whose qualifications had not as yet been inscribed in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstud-book.\xe2\x80\x9d It was not without uneasiness that I saw Harry Drake\r\ninterfering in the preparations with his usual audacity, discussing,\r\ndisputing, and settling affairs in a tone which admitted of no reply.\r\nHappily, although Fabian had risked some pounds in the race, he appeared\r\nquite indifferent to the noise; he kept himself aloof from the others,\r\nand it was quite evident his thoughts were far off.\r\n\r\nAmong the racers who offered themselves, two particularly attracted the\r\npublic attention. Wilmore, a small, thin, wiry Scotchman, with a broad\r\nchest and sharp eyes, was one of the favourites; the other, an Irishman\r\nnamed O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly, a tall, supple fellow, balanced the chance with Wilmore,\r\nin the eyes of connoisseurs. Three to one was asked on him, and for\r\nmyself partaking the general infatuation, I was going to risk a few\r\ndollars on him, when the Doctor said to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose the little one; believe me, the tall one is no go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the tall one is not genuine; he may\r\nhave a certain amount of speed, but he has no bottom. The little one, on\r\nthe contrary, is of pure Scotch race; look how straight his body is on\r\nhis legs, and how broad and pliant his chest is; he is a man who will\r\nlead more than once in the race. Bet on him, I tell you; you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nregret it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the learned doctor\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and bet on Wilmore; as to the other\r\nfour, they were not even discussed.\r\n\r\nThey drew for places; chance favoured the Irishman, who had the\r\nrope-side; the six runners were placed along the line, bounded by the\r\nposts, so that there was no unfair start to be feared.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner gave the signal, and the departure was hailed by a loud\r\nhurrah. It was soon evident that Wilmore and O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly were professional\r\nrunners; without taking any notice of their rivals, who passed them\r\nbreathless, they ran with their bodies thrown slightly forward, heads\r\nvery erect, arms tightly pressed against their chests, and holding their\r\nfists firmly in front.\r\n\r\nIn the second round O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly and Wilmore were in a line, having distanced\r\ntheir exhausted competitors. They obviously verified the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsaying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not with the legs, but with the chest that one runs; ham-strings\r\nare good, but lungs are better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the last turning but one the spectators again cheered their\r\nfavourites. Cries and hurrahs broke out on all sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little one will win,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pitferge to me. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, he is not even\r\npanting, and his rival is breathless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWilmore indeed looked calm and pale, whilst O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly was steaming like a\r\ndamp hay-stack; he was \xe2\x80\x9cpumped out,\xe2\x80\x9d to use a sportsman\xe2\x80\x99s slang\r\nexpression, but both of them kept the same line. At last they passed the\r\nupper decks; the hatchway of the engine-rooms, the winning-post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah! for Wilmore,\xe2\x80\x9d cried some.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! for O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly,\xe2\x80\x9d chimed in others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilmore has won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they are together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth was Wilmore had won, but by hardly half a head so the\r\nHonourable Mac Carthy decided. However, the discussion continued, and\r\neven came to words. The partisans of the Irishman, and particularly\r\nHarry Drake, maintained that it was a \xe2\x80\x9cdead heat,\xe2\x80\x9d and that they ought\r\nto go again.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment, urged by an irresistible impulse, Fabian went up to\r\nHarry Drake, and said to him in a cold tone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong, sir, the winner was the Scotch sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a threatening tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say you are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Fabian quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drake, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you bet on Wilmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was for O\xe2\x80\x99Kelly, like yourself; I lost, and I have paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Drake, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you pretend to teach me?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he did not finish his sentence, for Captain Corsican had interposed\r\nbetween him and Fabian, with the intention of taking up the quarrel. He\r\ntreated Drake with supreme contempt, but evidently Drake would not pick\r\na quarrel with him; so when Corsican had finished, he crossed his arms,\r\nand addressing himself to Fabian,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with an evil smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthis gentleman wants\r\nsome one to fight his battles for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFabian grew pale, he would have sprung at Drake, but I held him back,\r\nand the scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99s companions dragged him away; not, however, before he\r\nhad cast a look of hatred at his enemy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Corsican and I went below with Fabian, who contented himself by\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe first opportunity I have, I will box that impudent fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE TREATED DRAKE WITH SUPREME CONTEMPT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Thursday night to Saturday the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was crossing the\r\nGulf Stream, the water of which is of a dark colour, the surface of the\r\ncurrent forcing its way against the waters of the Atlantic, is even\r\nslightly convex. It is, in fact, a river running between two liquid\r\nshores, and one of the largest in the world, for it reduces the Amazon\r\nand Mississippi to mere brooks in comparison.\r\n\r\nThis day, the 5th of April, began with a magnificent sunrise, the waves\r\nglittered, and a warm south-west wind was wafted through the rigging. It\r\nwas the beginning of the fine weather; the sun, which had clothed the\r\nfields of the continent with verdure, caused fresh costumes to bloom on\r\nboard. Vegetation is sometimes behind-hand, but fashion never. Soon the\r\nBoulevards, filled with groups of promenaders, looked like the Champs\r\nElys\xc3\xa9es on a fine Sunday afternoon in May.\r\n\r\nI did not see Captain Corsican once that morning; wishing to hear of\r\nFabian, I went to his cabin, and knocked at the door, but getting no\r\nanswer I opened it and went in. Fabian was not there. I went on deck\r\nagain, but could find neither my friends nor the Doctor; the idea then\r\ncrossed my mind to find out where the unfortunate Ellen was confined.\r\nWhat cabin did she occupy? Where had Drake shut her up? In whose care\r\nwas the poor creature left, when Drake abandoned her for whole days?\r\nMost likely with some disinterested stewardess, or an indifferent nurse.\r\nI wished to know how it was, not from any vain motive of curiosity, but\r\nsimply in Ellen and Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s interest, if it was only to prevent a\r\nmeeting, always to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nI began my search with the cabin near the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 saloon, and went along\r\nthe passages of both stories. This inspection was easy enough, as the\r\nnames of the occupants were written on each door, in order to facilitate\r\nthe steward\xe2\x80\x99s work. I did not see Harry Drake\xe2\x80\x99s name, but this did not\r\nsurprise me much, as I had no doubt he had preferred the more isolated\r\ncabins at the stern. In matter of comfort, however, no difference\r\nexisted between the cabins at the bows and those at the stern, for the\r\n_Freighters_ had only admitted one class of passengers.\r\n\r\nI next went towards the dining saloons, keeping carefully to the side\r\npassages which wound between the double row of cabins. All these rooms\r\nwere occupied, and all had the name of the passengers outside, but Harry\r\nDrake\xe2\x80\x99s name was not to be seen. This time the absence of his name\r\nastonished me, for I thought I had been all over our Floating City, and\r\nI was not aware of any part more secluded than this.\r\n\r\nI inquired of a steward, who told me there were yet a hundred cabins\r\nbehind the dining saloons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get to them?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy a staircase at the end of the upper deck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, and can you tell me which cabin Mr. Harry Drake occupies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the steward.\r\n\r\nAgain I went on deck, and following the steward\xe2\x80\x99s direction at last came\r\nto the door at the top of the stairs. This staircase did not lead to any\r\nlarge saloons, but simply to a dimly-lighted landing, round which was\r\narranged a double row of cabins. Harry Drake could hardly have found a\r\nmore favourable place in which to hide Ellen.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the cabins were unoccupied. I went along the\r\nlanding, a few names were written on the doors, but only two or three at\r\nthe most. Harry Drake\xe2\x80\x99s name was not among them, and as I had made a\r\nvery minute inspection of this compartment, I was very much disappointed\r\nat my ill success. I was going away when suddenly a vague, almost\r\ninaudible murmur caught my ear, it proceeded from the left side of the\r\npassage. I went towards the place; the sounds, at first faint, grew\r\nlouder, and I distinguished a kind of plaintive song, or rather\r\nmelop\xc5\x93ia, the words of which did not reach me.\r\n\r\nI listened; it was a woman singing, but in this unconscious voice one\r\ncould recognize a mournful wail. Might not this voice belong to the mad\r\nwoman? My presentiments could not deceive me. I went quietly nearer to\r\nthe cabin, which was numbered 775. It was the last in this dim passage,\r\nand must have been lighted by the lowest light-ports in the hull of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern;\xe2\x80\x9d there was no name on the door, and Harry Drake had no\r\ndesire that any one should know the place where he confined Ellen.\r\n\r\nI could not distinctly hear the voice of the unfortunate woman; her song\r\nwas only a string of unconnected sentences like one speaking in sleep,\r\nbut at the same time it was sweet and plaintive.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had no means of recognizing her identity, I had no doubt but\r\nthat it was Ellen singing.\r\n\r\nI listened for some minutes, and was just going away, when I heard a\r\nstep on the landing. Could it be Harry Drake? I did not wish him to find\r\nme here, for Fabian and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s sake; fortunately I could get on deck,\r\nwithout being seen, by a passage leading round the cabins. However, I\r\nstopped to know who it really was that I had heard. The darkness\r\npartially hid me, and standing behind an angle of the passage I could\r\nsee without being myself in sight.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sound of the footsteps had ceased, and with it, as a\r\nstrange coincident, Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s voice. I waited and soon the song began\r\nagain, and the boards creaked under a stealthy tread; I leaned forward\r\nand, in the dim, uncertain light which glimmered through the cracks of\r\nthe cabin doors, I recognized Fabian.\r\n\r\nIt was my unhappy friend! What instinct could have led him to this\r\nplace? Had he then discovered the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s retreat before me? I did\r\nnot know what to think. Fabian slowly advanced along the passage,\r\nlistening, following the voice, as if it was a thread drawing him\r\nunconsciously on, and in spite of himself. It seemed to me that the song\r\ngrew fainter as he approached, and that the thread thus held was about\r\nto break. Fabian went quite near to the cabin doors and then stopped.\r\n\r\nHow those sad accents must have rent his heart! and how his whole being\r\nmust have thrilled as he caught some tone in the voice, which reminded\r\nhim of the past! But how was it, ignorant as he was of Harry Drake being\r\non board, that he had any suspicion of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s presence? No, it was\r\nimpossible; he had only been attracted by the plaintive accents which\r\ninsensibly responded to the great grief weighing down his spirit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FABIAN WENT NEAR TO THE CABIN DOORS.]\r\n\r\nFabian was still listening. What was he going to do? Would he call to\r\nthe mad woman? And what if Ellen suddenly appeared? Everything was\r\ndangerous in this situation! However, Fabian came nearer still to the\r\ndoor of her cabin; the song, which was growing fainter and fainter,\r\nsuddenly died away, and a piercing shriek was heard.\r\n\r\nHad Ellen, by a magnetic communication, felt him whom she loved so near\r\nher? Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was desperate; he had gathered himself up. Was he\r\ngoing to break the door open? I thought he would, so I rushed up to him.\r\n\r\nHe recognized me; I dragged him away, and he made no resistance, but\r\nasked me in a hollow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who that unhappy woman is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Fabian, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the mad woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in an unnatural voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this madness\r\nis not without remedy. I feel that a little devotion, a little love,\r\nwould cure the poor woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Fabian,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccome away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went on deck, but Fabian did not utter another word. I did not leave\r\nhim, however, until he had reached his cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome moments later I met Captain Corsican, and told him of the scene I\r\nhad just witnessed. He understood, as well as I did, that the situation\r\nof affairs was growing more and more serious. Ah! could I have foreseen\r\nall that would happen, how I should have longed to hasten the speed of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d and put the broad ocean between Fabian and Harry\r\nDrake!\r\n\r\nOn leaving each other, Captain Corsican and I agreed to watch the actors\r\nin this drama more narrowly than ever.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cAustralasian,\xe2\x80\x9d a Cunard steamer, running between Liverpool and New\r\nYork, was expected this day. She was to leave America on Wednesday\r\nmorning, and therefore would not be long before passing us. A watch was\r\nkept; however, she did not come in sight.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the English passengers organized a subscription on\r\nbehalf of the wounded on board, some of whom had not been able to leave\r\nthe hospital; among them was the boatswain, threatened with an incurable\r\nlameness. There was soon a long list of signatures, not however, without\r\nsome objections having been raised.\r\n\r\nAt noon a very exact observation was able to be made\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Long.   58\xc2\xb0, 37\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Lat.    41\xc2\xb0 41\xc2\xb4 11\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Course, 257 miles.\r\n\r\nWe had the latitude to a second. When the young engaged couple read the\r\nnotice they did not look remarkably pleased, and they had good reason to\r\nbe discontented with the steam.\r\n\r\nBefore lunch, Captain Anderson wishing to divert the passengers from the\r\ntedium of their long voyage, arranged some gymnastic exercises, which he\r\ndirected in person. About fifty unemployed men, each armed, like\r\nhimself, with a stick, imitated all his movements with a strict\r\nexactitude. These improvised gymnasts, with their firm set mouths,\r\nworked as methodically as a band of riflemen on parade.\r\n\r\nAnother entertainment was announced for this evening. I was not present,\r\nfor the same amusement, night after night, only wearied me. A new paper,\r\na rival of the \xe2\x80\x9cOcean Times,\xe2\x80\x9d was to be the great attraction.\r\n\r\nI passed the first hours of the night on deck; the sea heaved, and gave\r\nwarning of stormy weather, and although the sky was perfectly serene,\r\nthe rolling grew more emphasized. Lying on a seat of the upper deck, I\r\ncould admire the host of constellations with which the firmament was\r\nbespangled, and although there are only 5000 stars, in the whole extent\r\nof the celestial sphere, which are visible to the naked eye, this\r\nevening I thought I could see millions. There, along the horizon,\r\ntrailed the tail of Pegasus, in all its zodiacal magnificence, like the\r\nstarry robe of the queen of fairies. The Pleiades ascended the celestial\r\nheights with Gemini, who, in spite of their name, do not rise one after\r\nthe other, like the heroes of the fable. Taurus looked down on me with\r\nhis great fiery eye, whilst Vega, our future polar-star, shone\r\nbrilliantly, high up in the azure vault, and not far from her was the\r\ncircle of diamonds, which form the constellation of Corona Borealis. All\r\nthese stationary constellations seemed to move with the pitching of the\r\nvessel, and in one lurch I saw the main-mast describe a distinct arc of\r\na circle from \xce\xb2, in the Great Bear, to Altair in the Eagle, whilst the\r\nmoon, already low in the heavens, dipped her crescent in the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was stormy, the steam-ship, beaten by the waves, rolled\r\nfrightfully, without being disabled; the furniture was knocked about\r\nwith loud crashes, and the crockery began its clatter again. The wind\r\nhad evidently freshened, and besides this the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was now in\r\nthose coasts where the sea is always rough.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning I dragged myself to the staircase, leading\r\non to the upper decks. By clutching at the balusters, and taking\r\nadvantage of a lurch or two, I succeeded in climbing the steps, and with\r\nsome difficulty managed to reach the poop. The place was deserted, if\r\none may so qualify a place where was Dr. Pitferge. The worthy man, with\r\nhis back rounded as a protection against the wind, was leaning against\r\nthe railing, with his right leg wound tightly round one of the rails. He\r\nbeckoned for me to go to him\xe2\x80\x94with his head, of course, for he could not\r\nspare his hands, which held him up against the violence of the tempest.\r\nAfter several queer movements, twisting myself like an analide, I\r\nreached the upper deck, where I buttressed myself, after the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfashion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in for it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he to me; \xe2\x80\x9cthis will last. Heigh ho!\r\nthis \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern!\xe2\x80\x99 Just at the moment of arrival, a cyclone, a\r\nveritable cyclone is commanded on purpose for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor spoke in broken sentences, for the wind cut short his words,\r\nbut I understood him; the word cyclone carried its explanation with it.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that these whirlwinds, called hurricanes in the Indian\r\nand Atlantic Oceans, tornadoes on the coast of Africa, simoons in the\r\ndesert, and typhoons in the Chinese Sea, are tempests of such formidable\r\npower, that they imperil the largest ships.\r\n\r\nNow the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was caught in a cyclone. How would this giant\r\nmake head against it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarm will come to her,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Dean Pitferge. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, how she dives\r\ninto the billows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was, indeed, the exact position of the steam-ship, whose stern\r\ndisappeared beneath the mountains of waves, which swept violently\r\nagainst her. It was not possible to see to any distance: there were all\r\nthe symptoms of a storm, which broke forth in its fury about seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. The ocean heaved terrifically, the small undulations between\r\nthe large waves entirely disappeared under an overwhelming wind, the\r\nfoam-crested billows clashed together, in the wildest uproar, every\r\nmoment; the waves grew higher, and the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d cutting through\r\nthem, pitched frightfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are but two courses now to choose from,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, with\r\nthe self-possession of a seaman, \xe2\x80\x9ceither to put the ship\xe2\x80\x99s head on to\r\nthe waves, working with a minimum speed, or take flight and give up the\r\nstruggle with this baffling sea; but Captain Anderson will do neither\r\none thing nor the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d replied the doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause something must happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning round, I saw the Captain, the first officer, and the chief\r\nengineer, muffled in their macintoshes, and clutching at the railings of\r\nthe bridge; they were enveloped in spray from head to foot. The Captain\r\nwas smiling as usual, the first officer laughed, and showed his white\r\nteeth, at the sight of the ship pitching enough to make one think the\r\nmasts and chimneys were coming down.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I was really astonished at the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s obstinacy. At\r\nhalf-past seven, the aspect of the Atlantic was terrible; the sea swept\r\nright across the deck at the bows. I watched this grand sight; this\r\nstruggle between the giant and the billows, and to a certain extent I\r\ncould sympathize with the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s wilfulness; but I was forgetting\r\nthat the power of the sea is infinite, and that nothing made by the hand\r\nof man can resist it; and, indeed, powerful as she was, our ship was at\r\nlast obliged to fly before the tempest.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a violent shock was felt, caused by a\r\nformidable swoop of the sea, which struck the ship on her fore larboard\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not a box on the ear, it was a blow in the face,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nDoctor to me.\r\n\r\nAnd the blow had evidently bruised us, for spars appeared on the crests\r\nof the waves. Was it part of our ship that was making off in this\r\nmanner, or the _d\xc3\xa9bris_ of a wreck?\r\n\r\nOn a sign from the Captain, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d shifted her course, in\r\norder to avoid the spars, which threatened to get entangled in the\r\npaddles. Looking more attentively, I saw that the sea had carried off\r\nthe bulwarks on the larboard side, which were fifty feet above the\r\nsurface of the water; the jambs were broken, the taggers torn away, and\r\nthe shattered remnants of glass still trembled in their casements. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had staggered beneath the shock, but she continued her\r\nway with an indomitable audacity. It was necessary, as quickly as\r\npossible, to remove the spars which encumbered the ship at the bows, and\r\nin order to do this it was indispensable to avoid the sea, but the\r\nsteam-ship obstinately continued to make head against the waves. The\r\nspirit of her captain seemed to animate her; he did not want to yield,\r\nand yield he would not. An officer and some men were sent to the bows to\r\nclear the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor to me, \xe2\x80\x9cthe moment of the catastrophe is not far\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailors went towards the bows, whilst we fastened ourselves to the\r\nsecond mast, and looked through the spray, which fell in showers over us\r\nwith each wave. Suddenly there was another swoop more violent than the\r\nfirst, and the sea poured through the barricading by the opened breach,\r\ntore off an enormous sheet of cast-iron which covered the bit of the\r\nbows, broke away the massive top of the hatchway leading to the crew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nberths, and lashing against the starboard barricadings, swept them off\r\nlike the sheets of a sail.\r\n\r\nThe men were knocked down; one of them, an officer, half-drowned, shook\r\nhis red whiskers, and picked himself up; then seeing one of the sailors\r\nlying unconscious across an anchor, he hurried towards him, lifted him\r\non his shoulders and carried him away. At this moment the rest of the\r\ncrew escaped through the broken hatchway. There were three feet of water\r\nin the tween-decks, new spars covered the sea, and amongst other things\r\nseveral thousand of the dolls, which my countryman had thought to\r\nacclimatize in America; these little bodies, torn from their cases by\r\nthe sea, danced on the summits of the waves, and under less serious\r\ncircumstances the sight would have been truly ludicrous. In the meantime\r\nthe inundation was gaining on us, large bodies of water were pouring in\r\nthrough the opened gaps, and according to the engineer, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\r\nEastern\xe2\x80\x9d shipped more than two thousand tons of water, enough to float a\r\nfrigate of the largest size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE SAILORS LYING UNCONSCIOUS.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Doctor, whose hat had been blown off in the\r\nhurricane, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep in this position is impossible; it is fool-hardy to\r\nhold on any longer; we ought to take flight, the steam-ship going with\r\nher battered stem ahead, is like a man swimming between two currents,\r\nwith his mouth open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis Captain Anderson understood at last, for I saw him run to the\r\nlittle wheel on the bridge which commanded the movement of the rudder,\r\nthe steam immediately rushed into the cylinders at the stern, and the\r\ngiant turning like a canoe made head towards the north, and fled before\r\nthe storm.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, the Captain, generally so calm and self-possessed, cried\r\nangrily,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ship is disgraced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d tacked and presented her stern to the\r\nwaves, than the pitching gave way to perfect steadiness; breakfast was\r\nserved, and the greater part of the passengers, reassured by the ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstillness, came into the dining-rooms, and took their repast without\r\nfear of another shock. Not a plate fell off the table, and not a glass\r\nemptied its contents on to the cloth, although the racks had not even\r\nbeen put up. But three quarters of an hour later the furniture was set\r\nin motion again, and the crockery clattered together on the pantry\r\nshelves, for the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had resumed her westerly course, which\r\nfor the time had been interrupted.\r\n\r\nI went on deck again with Dr. Pitferge, who seeing the man belonging to\r\nthe dolls said to him,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour little people have been put to a severe test, sir; those poor\r\nbabies will never prattle in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the enterprising Parisian, \xe2\x80\x9cthe stock was insured, and\r\nmy secret has not perished with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was evident my countryman was not a man to be easily disheartened, he\r\nbowed to us with a pleasant smile, and we continued our way to the\r\nstern, where a steersman told us that the rudder-chains had been jammed\r\nin the interval between the two swoops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that accident had happened when we were turning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pitferge to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say what would have become of us, for the sea would have\r\nrushed in, in overwhelming torrents; the steam pumps have already begun\r\nto reduce the water, but there is more coming yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what of the unfortunate sailor?\xe2\x80\x9d asked I of the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is severely wounded on his head, poor fellow! he is a young married\r\nfisherman, the father of two children, and this is his first voyage. The\r\nDoctor seems to think there is hope of his recovery, and that is what\r\nmakes me fear for him, but we shall soon see for ourselves. A report was\r\nspread that several men had been washed overboard, but happily there was\r\nno foundation for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have resumed our course at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe westerly course, against wind and tide,\r\nthere is no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, catching hold of a kevel to\r\nprevent himself from rolling on the deck. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I should do\r\nwith the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 if she belonged to me? No. Well, I would make a\r\npleasure-boat of her, and charge 10,000 francs a head; there would only\r\nbe millionnaires on board, and people who were not pressed for time. I\r\nwould take a month or six weeks going from England to America; the ship\r\nnever against the waves, and the wind always ahead or astern; there\r\nshould be no rolling, no pitching, and I would pay a 100_F._ in any case\r\nof sea-sickness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a practical idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pitferge, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s money to be gained or lost by that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was slowly but steadily continuing\r\nher way; the swell was frightful, but her straight stem cut the waves\r\nregularly, and shipped no more water. It was no longer a metal mountain\r\nmaking against a mountain of water, but as sedentary as a rock; the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d received the billows with perfect indifference. The rain\r\nfell in torrents, and we were obliged to take refuge under the eaves of\r\nthe grand saloon; with the shower the violence of the wind and sea\r\nassuaged; the western sky grew clear, and the last black clouds vanished\r\nin the opposite horizon; at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the hurricane sent us a farewell\r\ngust.\r\n\r\nAt noon an observation was able to be made and was as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat.    49\xc2\xb0 50\xc2\xb4, N.\r\n                      Long.   61\xc2\xb0 57\xc2\xb4, W.\r\n                      Course, 193 miles.\r\n\r\nThis considerable diminution in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s speed could only be\r\nattributed to the tempest, which during the night and morning had\r\nincessantly beaten against the ship, and a tempest so terrible that one\r\nof the passengers, almost an inhabitant of the Atlantic, which he had\r\ncrossed forty-four times, declared he had never seen the like. The\r\nengineer even said that during the storm, when the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthree days in the trough of the sea, the ship had never been attacked\r\nwith such violence, and it must be repeated that even if this admirable\r\nsteam-ship did go at an inferior speed, and rolled decidedly too much,\r\nshe nevertheless presented a sure security against the fury of the sea,\r\nwhich she resisted like a block, owing to the perfect homogeneity of her\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nBut let me also say, however powerful she might be, it was not right to\r\nexpose her, without any reason whatever, to a baffling sea; for however\r\nstrong, however imposing a ship may appear, it is not \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraced\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbecause it flies before the tempest. A commander ought always to\r\nremember that a man\xe2\x80\x99s life is worth more than the mere satisfaction of\r\nhis own pride. In any case, to be obstinate is blameable, and to be\r\nwilful is dangerous. A recent incident in which a dreadful catastrophe\r\nhappened to a Transatlantic steamer shows us that a captain ought not to\r\nstruggle blindly against the sea, even when he sees the boat of a rival\r\ncompany creeping ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the pumps were exhausting the lake which had been formed\r\nin the hold of the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d like a lagoon in the middle of an\r\nisland; powerfully and rapidly worked by steam they speedily restored to\r\nthe Atlantic that which belonged to it. The rain had ceased and the wind\r\nfreshened again, but the sky, swept by the tempest, was clear. I stayed\r\nseveral hours after dark walking on deck. Great floods of light poured\r\nfrom the half-opened hatchways of the saloons, and at the stern\r\nstretched a phosphorescent light as far as the eye could reach, streaked\r\nhere and there by the luminous crests of the waves. The stars reflected\r\nin the lactescent water appeared and disappeared, as though peering\r\nthrough rapidly driving clouds. Night had spread her sombre covering far\r\nand near; forward roared the thunder of the wheels, whilst beneath me I\r\nheard the clanking of the rudder-chains.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the saloon door I was surprised to see there a compact\r\ncrowd of spectators, and to hear vociferous applauses, for, in spite of\r\nthe day\xe2\x80\x99s disasters, the entertainment was taking place as usual. Not a\r\nthought of the wounded and, perhaps, dying sailor. The assembly seemed\r\nhighly animated, and loud hurrahs hailed the appearance of a troop of\r\nminstrels on board the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern.\xe2\x80\x9d The niggers\xe2\x80\x94black, or blackened,\r\naccording to their origin\xe2\x80\x94were no others than sailors in disguise. They\r\nwere dressed in cast-off trumpery, ornamented with sea-biscuits for\r\nbuttons; the opera-glasses which they sported were composed of two\r\nbottles fastened together, and their jew\xe2\x80\x99s-harps consisted of catgut\r\nstretched on cork. These merry-andrews were amusing enough upon the\r\nwhole; they sang comic songs, and improvised a mixture of puns and\r\ncock-and-bull stories. The uproarious cheers with which their\r\nperformances were greeted only made them increase their contortions and\r\ngrimaces, until one of them, as nimble as a monkey, finished the\r\nperformance by dancing the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s hornpipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TROOP OF MINSTRELS.]\r\n\r\nHowever amusing the minstrels may have been, they had not succeeded in\r\nattracting all the passengers. Numbers of them had flocked to their\r\nusual haunt, the \xe2\x80\x9csmoking-room,\xe2\x80\x9d and were eagerly pressing round the\r\ngaming-tables, where enormous stakes were being made, some defending\r\ntheir acquisitions during the voyage, others trying to conquer fate by\r\nmaking rash wagers at the last moment. The room was in a violent uproar,\r\none could hear the voice of the money agent crying the stakes, the oaths\r\nof the losers, the clinking of gold, and the rustling of dollar-papers;\r\nthen there was a sudden lull, the uproar was silenced by a bold stake,\r\nbut as soon as the result was known the noise was redoubled.\r\n\r\nI very seldom entered the smoking-room, for I have a horror of gambling.\r\nIt is always a vulgar and often an unhealthy pastime, and it is a vice\r\nwhich does not go alone; the man who gambles will find himself capable\r\nof any evil. Here reigned Harry Drake in the midst of his parasites,\r\nhere also flourished those adventurers who were going to seek their\r\nfortunes in America. I always avoided a meeting with these boisterous\r\nmen, so this evening I passed the door without going in, when my\r\nattention was arrested by a violent outburst of cries and curses. I\r\nlistened, and, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silence, to my great astonishment I\r\nthought I could distinguish Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s voice. What could he be doing in\r\nthis place? Had he come here to look for his enemy, and thus the\r\ncatastrophe, until now avoided, been brought about?\r\n\r\nI quickly pushed the door open: at this moment the uproar was at its\r\nheight. In the midst of the crowd of gamblers I saw Fabian standing\r\nfacing Harry Drake. I hurried towards him, Harry Drake had undoubtedly\r\ngrossly insulted him, for Fabian was aiming a blow with his fist at him,\r\nand if it did not reach the place it was intended for, it was only\r\nbecause Corsican suddenly appeared and stopped him with a quick gesture.\r\n\r\nBut, addressing himself to his enemy, Fabian said, in a cold, sarcastic\r\ntone,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you accept that blow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Drake, \xe2\x80\x9cand here is my card!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of our efforts, an inevitable fatality had brought these\r\ntwo deadly enemies together. It was too late to separate them now,\r\nevents must take their course. Captain Corsican looked at me, and I was\r\nsurprised to see sadness rather than annoyance in his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cDO YOU ACCEPT THAT BLOW?\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Fabian picked up the card which Harry Drake had thrown\r\non the table. He held it between the tips of his fingers as if loath to\r\ntouch it. Corsican was pale, and my heart beat wildly. At last Fabian\r\nlooked at the card, and read the name on it, then with a voice stifled\r\nby passion he cried,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry Drake! you! you! you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same, Captain Mac Elwin,\xe2\x80\x9d quietly replied Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s rival.\r\n\r\nWe were not deceived, if Fabian was ignorant until now of Drake\xe2\x80\x99s name,\r\nthe latter was only too well aware of Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat\r\nEastern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, at break of dawn, I went in search of Captain Corsican,\r\nwhom I found in the grand saloon. He had passed the night with Fabian,\r\nwho was still suffering from the shock which the name of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s husband\r\nhad given him. Did a secret intuition tell him that Drake was not alone\r\non board? Had Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s presence been revealed to him by the appearance of\r\nthis man? Lastly, could he guess that the poor crazed woman was the\r\nyoung girl whom he so fondly loved? Corsican could not say, for Fabian\r\nhad not uttered one word all night.\r\n\r\nCorsican resented Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s wrongs with a kind of brotherly feeling. The\r\nintrepid nature of the latter had from childhood irresistibly attracted\r\nhim, and he was now in the greatest despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came in too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore Fabian could have raised\r\nhis hand, I ought to have struck that wretch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUseless violence,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I. \xe2\x80\x9cHarry Drake would not have risked a\r\nquarrel with you; he has a grudge against Fabian, and a meeting between\r\nthe two had become inevitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cThat rascal has got what he wanted;\r\nhe knew Fabian, his past life, and his love. Perhaps Ellen, deprived of\r\nreason, betrayed her secret thoughts, or, rather, did not Drake before\r\nhis marriage learn from the loyal young woman all he was ignorant of\r\nregarding her past life? Urged by a base impulse, and finding himself in\r\ncontact with Fabian, he has waited for an opportunity in which he could\r\nassume the part of the offended. This scoundrel ought to be a clever\r\nduellist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has already had three or four encounters of the\r\nkind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not the duel in itself which I\r\nfear for Fabian. Captain Mac Elwin is one of those who never trouble\r\nthemselves about danger, but it is the result of this engagement which\r\nis to be dreaded. If Fabian were to kill this man, however vile he may\r\nbe, it would place an impossible barrier between Ellen and himself, and\r\nHeaven knows, the unhappy woman needs a support, like Fabian, in the\r\nstate she now is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever happens we can but hope that Harry Drake will\r\nfall. Justice is on our side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cbut one cannot help feeling\r\ndistressed to think that even at the risk of my own life I could not\r\nhave spared Fabian this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking the hand of this devoted friend, \xe2\x80\x9cDrake has\r\nnot sent his seconds yet, so that, although circumstances are against\r\nus, I do not despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any means of preventing the duel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone at present; at the same time, if the meeting must take place, it\r\nseems to me that it can only do so in America, and before we get there,\r\nchance, which has brought about this state of things, will, perhaps,\r\nturn the scales in our favour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCaptain Corsican shook his head like a man who had no faith in the\r\nefficacy of chance in human affairs. At this moment Fabian went up the\r\nstairs leading to the deck. I only saw him for a moment, but I was\r\nstruck by the deadly pallor of his face. The wound had been reopened,\r\nand it was sad to see him wandering aimlessly about, trying to avoid us.\r\n\r\nEven friendship may be troublesome at times, and Corsican and I thought\r\nit better to respect his grief rather than interfere with him. But\r\nsuddenly Fabian turned, and coming towards us, said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mad woman, was she! It was Ellen, was it not? Poor Ellen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was still doubtful, and went away without waiting for an answer,\r\nwhich we had not the courage to give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon, Drake had not sent Fabian his seconds to my knowledge, and\r\nthese were preliminaries which could not be dispensed with, if Drake\r\ndetermined to demand immediate satisfaction. Might we not take hope from\r\nthis delay? I knew that the Saxon race do not regard a debt of honour as\r\nwe do, and that duels had almost disappeared from English customs, for,\r\nas I have already said, not only is there a severe law against\r\nduellists, but, moreover, the public opinion is strongly averse to them.\r\nAt the same time, in this, which was an uncommon case, the engagement\r\nhad evidently been voluntarily sought for; the offended had, so to\r\nspeak, provoked the offender, and my reasonings always tended to the\r\nsame conclusion, that a meeting between Fabian and Harry Drake was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nThe deck was at this moment crowded with passengers and crew returning\r\nfrom service.\r\n\r\nAt half-past twelve the observation resulted in the following note:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Lat.    40\xc2\xb0 33\xc2\xb4 N.\r\n                      Long.   66\xc2\xb0 24\xc2\xb4 W.\r\n                      Course, 214 miles.\r\n\r\nThus the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was only 348 miles from Sandy Hook Point, a\r\nnarrow tongue of land which forms the entrance to the New York harbour;\r\nit would not be long before we were in American seas.\r\n\r\nI did not see Fabian in his usual place at lunch, but Drake was there,\r\nand although talkative, he did not appear to be quite at his ease. Was\r\nhe trying to drown his fears in wine? I cannot say, but he indulged in\r\nbountiful libations with his friends. Several times I saw him leering at\r\nme, but insolent as he was, he dared not look me in the face. Was he\r\nlooking for Fabian among the crowd of guests? I noticed he left the\r\ntable abruptly before the meal was finished, and I got up immediately,\r\nin order to observe him, but he went to his cabin and shut himself up\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI went up on deck. Not a wave disturbed the calm surface of the sea, and\r\nthe sky was unsullied by a cloud; the two mirrors mutually reflected\r\ntheir azure hue. I met Doctor Pitferge, who gave me bad news of the\r\nwounded sailor. The invalid was getting worse, and, in spite of the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s assurance, it was difficult to think that he could recover.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a few minutes before dinner, a ship was hailed to\r\nlarboard. The first officer told me he thought it must be the \xe2\x80\x9cCity of\r\nParis,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the finest steamers of the \xe2\x80\x9cInman Company,\xe2\x80\x9d but he was\r\nmistaken, for the steamer coming nearer, sent us her name, which was the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaxonia,\xe2\x80\x9d belonging to the \xe2\x80\x9cNational Steamship Company.\xe2\x80\x9d For a few\r\nminutes the two boats came alongside, within two or three cables\xe2\x80\x99 length\r\nof each other. The deck of the \xe2\x80\x9cSaxonia\xe2\x80\x9d was covered with passengers,\r\nwho saluted us with loud cheers.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock another ship on the horizon, but too far off for her\r\nnationality to be recognized. This time it was undoubtedly the \xe2\x80\x9cCity of\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d This meeting with ships, and the salutation between the\r\nAtlantic\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, caused great excitement on board. One can\r\nunderstand that as there is little difference between one ship and\r\nanother, the common danger of facing the uncertain element unites even\r\nstrangers by a friendly bond.\r\n\r\nAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock a third ship appeared, the \xe2\x80\x9cPhiladelphia,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the\r\nInman line, used for the transportation of emigrants from Liverpool to\r\nNew York. We were evidently in frequented seas, and land could not be\r\nfar off. How I longed to reach it!\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cEurope,\xe2\x80\x9d a steamer belonging to the \xe2\x80\x9cTransatlantic Company,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncarrying passengers from Havre to New York, was expected, but she did\r\nnot come in sight, and had most likely taken a more northerly course.\r\n\r\nNight closed in about half-past seven. As the sun sank below the\r\nhorizon, the moon grew brighter and for some time hung shining in the\r\nheavens. A prayer-meeting, held by Captain Anderson, interspersed with\r\nhymns, lasted until nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThe day passed without either Captain Corsican or myself receiving a\r\nvisit from Drake\xe2\x80\x99s seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Monday, the 8th of April, the weather was very fine. I\r\nfound the Doctor on deck basking in the sun. He came up to me. \xe2\x80\x9cAh\r\nwell!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cour poor sufferer died in the night. The doctor never\r\ngave him up\xe2\x80\x94oh, those doctors! they never will give in. This is the\r\nfourth man we have lost since we left Liverpool, the fourth gone towards\r\npaying the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 debt, and we are not at the end of our\r\nvoyage yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cjust as we are nearing port, and the American\r\ncoast almost in sight. What will become of his widow and little\r\nchildren?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have it otherwise, my dear sir. It is the law, the great law!\r\nwe must die! We must give way to others. It is my opinion we die simply\r\nbecause we are occupying a place which by rights belongs to another. Now\r\ncan you tell me how many people will have died during my existence if I\r\nlive to be sixty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea, Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe calculation is simple enough,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Dean Pitferge. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I live\r\nsixty years, I shall have been in the world 21,900 days, or 525,600\r\nhours, or 31,536,000 minutes, or lastly, 1,892,160,000 seconds, in round\r\nnumbers 2,000,000,000 seconds. Now in that time two thousand millions\r\nindividuals who were in the way of their successors will have died, and\r\nwhen I have become inconvenient, I shall be put out of the way in the\r\nsame manner, so that the long and short of the matter is to put off\r\nbecoming inconvenient as long as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Doctor continued for some time arguing on this subject, tending to\r\nprove to me a very simple theory, the mortality of human creatures. I\r\ndid not think it worth while to discuss the point with him, so I let him\r\nhave his say. Whilst we paced backwards and forwards, the Doctor\r\ntalking, and I listening, I noticed that the carpenters on board were\r\nbusy repairing the battered stem. If Captain Anderson did not wish to\r\narrive in New York with damages, the carpenters would have to hurry over\r\ntheir work, for the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was rapidly speeding through the\r\ntranquil waters; this I understood from the lively demeanour of the\r\nyoung lovers, who no longer thought of counting the turns of the wheels.\r\nThe long pistons expanded, and the enormous cylinders heaving on their\r\naxle-swings, looked like a great peal of bells clanging together at\r\nrandom. The wheels made eleven revolutions a minute, and the steam-ship\r\nwent at the rate of thirteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAt noon the officers dispensed with making an observation; they knew\r\ntheir situation by calculation, and land must be signalled before long.\r\n\r\nWhile I was walking on deck after lunch, Captain Corsican came up. I\r\nsaw, from the thoughtful expression on his face, that he had something\r\nto tell me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFabian,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chas received Drake\xe2\x80\x99s seconds. I am to be his second,\r\nand he begs me to ask you if you would kindly be present on the\r\noccasion. He may rely on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain; so all hope of deferring or preventing this meeting has\r\nvanished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut tell me, how did the quarrel arise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA discussion about the play was a pretext for it, nothing else. The\r\nfact is if Fabian was not aware who Harry Drake was, it is quite evident\r\nhe knew Fabian, and the name of Fabian is so odious to him that he would\r\ngladly slay the man to whom it belongs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are Drake\xe2\x80\x99s seconds?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of them is that actor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so; the other is a Yankee I do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you to expect them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just as he spoke I saw the seconds coming towards us. Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\ncleared his throat; he undoubtedly thought a great deal more of himself\r\nas the representative of a rogue. His companion, another of Drake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassociates, was one of those extraordinary merchants who has always for\r\nsale anything you may ask him to buy.\r\n\r\nDoctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 spoke first, after making a very emphatic bow, which Captain\r\nCorsican hardly condescended to acknowledge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, in a grave tone, \xe2\x80\x9cour friend Drake, a\r\ngentleman whose merit and deportment cannot fail to be appreciated by\r\nevery one, has sent us to arrange a somewhat delicate affair with you;\r\nthat is to say, Captain Fabian Mac Elwin, to whom we first addressed\r\nourselves, referred us to you as his representative. I hope that we\r\nshall be able to come to an understanding between ourselves worthy the\r\nposition of gentlemen touching the delicate object of our mission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe made no reply, but allowed the gentleman to become embarrassed with\r\nhis delicacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not the remotest doubt but that\r\nCaptain Mac Elwin is in the wrong. That gentleman has unreasonably, and\r\nwithout the slightest pretext, questioned the honour of Harry Drake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings in a matter of play, and without any provocation offered him\r\nthe greatest insult a gentleman could receive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese honeyed words made the Captain impatient, he bit his moustache,\r\nand could refrain speaking no longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d said he sharply to Doctor T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, whose speech he had\r\ninterrupted, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t want so many words; the affair is simple enough;\r\nCaptain Mac Elwin raised his hand against Mr. Drake, your friend\r\naccepted the blow, he assumes the part of the offended, and demands\r\nsatisfaction. He has the choice of arms. What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Captain Mac Elwin accept the challenge?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Doctor, baffled\r\nby Corsican\xe2\x80\x99s tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur friend, Harry Drake, has chosen swords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, and where is the engagement to take place? In New York?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, here on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn board, be it so; at what time? To-morrow morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the end of the upper deck, which will\r\nbe deserted at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying, the Captain took my arm, and turned his back on Dr. T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was no longer possible to put off the duel. Only a few hours\r\nseparated us from the moment when Fabian and Harry Drake must meet. What\r\ncould be the reason of this haste? How was it that Harry Drake had not\r\ndelayed the duel until he and his enemy had disembarked? Was it because\r\nthis ship, freighted by a French company, seemed to him the most\r\nfavourable ground for a meeting which must be a deadly struggle? Or\r\nrather, might not Drake have a secret interest in freeing himself of\r\nFabian before the latter could set foot on the American continent, or\r\nsuspect the presence of Ellen on board, which he must have thought was\r\nunknown to all save himself? Yes, it must have been for this reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle matter, after all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cfar better to have it\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ask Dr. Pitferge to be present at the duel as a doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it would be well to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorsican left me to go to Fabian. At this moment the bell on deck began\r\ntolling, and when I inquired of a steersman the reason of this unusual\r\noccurrence, he told me that it was for the burial of the sailor who had\r\ndied in the night, and that the sad ceremony was about to take place.\r\nThe sky, until now so clear, became overcast, and dark clouds loomed\r\nthreateningly in the south.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the bell the passengers flocked to the starboard side.\r\nThe bridges, paddle-boards, bulwarks, masts and shore-boats, hanging\r\nfrom their davits, were crowded with spectators, the officers, sailors,\r\nand stokers off duty, stood in ranks on deck.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock a group of sailors appeared at the far end of the upper\r\ndeck, they had left the hospital, and were passing the rudder-engine.\r\nThe corpse, sewn in a piece of sail and stretched on a board, with a\r\ncannon ball at the feet, was carried by four men. The body, covered with\r\nthe British flag, and followed by the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s comrades, slowly\r\nadvanced into the midst of the spectators, who uncovered their heads as\r\nthe procession passed.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the starboard paddle-wheel, the corpse was deposited\r\non a landing of a staircase which terminated at the main deck.\r\n\r\nIn front of the row of spectators, standing one above the other, were\r\nCaptain Anderson and his principal officers in full uniform. The\r\nCaptain, holding a prayer-book in his hand, took his hat off, and for\r\nsome minutes, during a profound silence, which not even the breeze\r\ninterrupted, he solemnly read the prayer for the dead, every word of\r\nwhich was distinctly audible in the deathlike silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRAYER FOR THE DEAD.]\r\n\r\nOn a sign from the Captain the body, released by the bearers, sank into\r\nthe sea. For one moment it floated on the surface, became upright, and\r\nthen disappeared in a circle of foam.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the voice of the sailor on watch was heard crying \xe2\x80\x9cLand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land announced at the moment when the sea was closing over the\r\ncorpse of the poor sailor was low-lying and of a yellow colour. This\r\nline of slightly elevated downs was Long Island, a great sandy bank\r\nenlivened with vegetation, which stretches along the American coast from\r\nMontauk Point to Brooklyn, adjoining New York. Several yachts were\r\ncoasting along this island, which is covered with villas and\r\npleasure-houses, the favourite resorts of the New Yorkists.\r\n\r\nEvery passenger waved his hand to the land so longed for after the\r\ntedious voyage, which had not been exempt from painful accidents. Every\r\ntelescope was directed towards this first specimen of the American\r\ncontinent, and each saw it under a different aspect. The Yankee beheld\r\nin it his mother-land; the Southerner regarded these northern lands with\r\na kind of scorn, the scorn of the conquered for the conqueror; the\r\nCanadian looked upon it as a man who had only one step to take to call\r\nhimself a citizen of the Union; the Californian in his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\ntraversed the plains of the Far West, and crossing the Rocky Mountains\r\nhad already set foot on their inexhaustible mines. The Mormonite, with\r\nelevated brow and scornful lip, hardly noticed these shores, but peered\r\nbeyond to where stood the City of the Saints on the borders of Salt\r\nLake, in the far-off deserts. As for the young lovers, this continent\r\nwas to them the Promised Land.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the sky was growing more and more threatening. A dark\r\nline of clouds gathered in the zenith, and a suffocating heat penetrated\r\nthe atmosphere as though a July sun was shining directly above us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like me to astonish you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, who had joined me\r\non the gangway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonish me, Doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, we shall have a storm, perhaps a thunder-storm, before the\r\nday is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thunder-storm in the month of April!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 does not trouble herself about seasons,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nDean Pitferge, shrugging his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a tempest called forth\r\nexpressly on her account. Look at the threatening aspect of those clouds\r\nwhich cover the sky; they look like antediluvian animals, and before\r\nlong they will devour each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sky looks stormy, and were it three months\r\nlater I should be of your opinion, but not at this time of year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor, growing animated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe storm will\r\nburst out before many hours are past. I feel it like a barometer. Look\r\nat those vapours rising in a mass, observe that cirrus, those mares\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntails which are blending together, and those thick circles which\r\nsurround the horizon. Soon there will be a rapid condensing of vapour,\r\nwhich will consequently produce electricity. Besides the mercury has\r\nsuddenly fallen, and the prevailing wind is south-west, the only one\r\nwhich can brew a storm in winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour observations may be very true, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, not willing to\r\nyield, \xe2\x80\x9cbut who has ever witnessed a thunder-storm at this season, and\r\nin this latitude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have proof, sir, we have proof on record. Mild winters are often\r\nmarked by storms. You ought only to have lived in 1772, or even in 1824,\r\nand you would have heard the roaring of the thunder, in the first\r\ninstance in February, and in the second in December. In the month of\r\nJanuary, 1837, a thunder-bolt fell near Drammen in Norway, and did\r\nconsiderable mischief. Last year, in the month of February,\r\nfishing-smacks from Tr\xc3\xa9port were struck by lightning. If I had time to\r\nconsult statistics I would soon put you to silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Doctor, since you will have it so, we shall soon see. At any\r\nrate, you are not afraid of thunder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thunder is my friend; better still, it\r\nis my doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour doctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly. I was struck by lightning in my bed on the 13th July,\r\n1867, at Kew, near London, and it cured me of paralysis in my right arm,\r\nwhen the doctors had given up the case as hopeless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. It is an economical treatment by electricity. My dear sir,\r\nthere are many very authentic facts which prove that thunder surpasses\r\nthe most skilful physicians, and its intervention is truly marvellous in\r\napparently hopeless cases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have little trust in your doctor, and would\r\nnot willingly consult him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you have never seen him at work. Stay; here is an instance\r\nwhich I have heard of as occurring in 1817. A peasant in Connecticut,\r\nwho was suffering from asthma, supposed to be incurable, was struck by\r\nlightning in a field, and radically cured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact I believe the Doctor would have been capable of making the\r\nthunder into pills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh, ignoramus!\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing either of the\r\nweather or medicine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDean Pitferge left me, but I remained on deck, watching the storm rise.\r\nCorsican was still closeted with Fabian, who was undoubtedly making some\r\narrangements in case of misfortune. I then remembered that he had a\r\nsister in New York, and I shuddered at the thought that perhaps we\r\nshould have to carry to her the news of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s death. I should\r\nlike to have seen Fabian, but I thought it better not to disturb either\r\nhim or Captain Corsican.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I REMAINED ON DECK WATCHING THE STORM RISE.]\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock we came in sight of land stretching before Long Island.\r\nIt was Fire Island. In the centre rose a lighthouse, which shone over\r\nthe surrounding land. The passengers again invaded the upper decks and\r\nbridges. All eyes were strained towards the coast, distant about six\r\nmiles. They were waiting for the moment when the arrival of the pilot\r\nshould settle the great pool business. It may be thought that those who\r\nhad night quarters, and I was of the number, had given up all\r\npretensions, and that those with the day quarters, except those included\r\nbetween four and six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, had no longer any chance. Before night the\r\npilot would come on board and settle this affair, so that all the\r\ninterest was now concentrated in the seven or eight persons to whom fate\r\nhad attributed the next quarters. The latter were taking advantage of\r\ntheir good luck\xe2\x80\x94selling, buying, and reselling their chances, bartering\r\nwith such energy one might almost have fancied oneself in the Royal\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen minutes past four a small schooner, bearing towards the\r\nsteam-ship, was signalled to starboard. There was no longer any possible\r\ndoubt of its being the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s boat, and he would be on board in\r\nfourteen or fifteen minutes at the most. The struggle was now between\r\nthe possessors of the second and third quarters from four to five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Demands and offers were made with renewed vivacity. Then absurd\r\nwagers were laid even on the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s person, the tenor of which I have\r\nfaithfully given.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen dollars that the pilot is married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty that he is a widower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty dollars that he has a moustache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixty that he has a wart on his nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred dollars that he will step on board with his right foot\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will have a pipe in his mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! a cigar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd twenty other wagers quite as ridiculous, which found those more\r\nabsurd still to accept them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SMALL SCHOONER WAS SIGNALLED TO STARBOARD.]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the little schooner was sensibly approaching the\r\nsteam-ship, and we could distinguish her graceful proportions. These\r\ncharming little pilot-boats, of about fifty or sixty tons, are good\r\nsea-boats, skimming over the water like sea-gulls. The schooner,\r\ngracefully inclined, was bearing windward in spite of the breeze, which\r\nhad begun to freshen. Her mast and foresails stood out clearly against\r\nthe dark background of clouds, and the sea foamed beneath her bows. When\r\nat two cables\xe2\x80\x99 length from the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d she suddenly veered and\r\nlaunched a shore-boat. Captain Anderson gave orders to heave-to, and for\r\nthe first time during a fortnight the wheels of the screw were\r\nmotionless. A man got into the boat, which four sailors quickly pulled\r\nto the steam-ship. A rope-ladder was thrown over the side of the giant\r\ndown to the pilot in his little nutshell, which the latter caught, and,\r\nskilfully climbing, sprang on deck.\r\n\r\nHe was received with joyous cries by the winners, and exclamations of\r\ndisappointment from the losers. The pool was regulated by the following\r\nstatements:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pilot was married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had no wart on his nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a light moustache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had jumped on board with both feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLastly, it was thirty-six minutes past four o\xe2\x80\x99clock when he set foot on\r\nthe deck of the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe possessor of the thirty-third quarter thus gained the ninety-six\r\ndollars, and it was Captain Corsican, who had hardly thought of the\r\nunexpected gain. It was not long before he appeared on deck, and when\r\nthe pool was presented to him, he begged Captain Anderson to keep it for\r\nthe widow of the young sailor whose death had been caused by the inroad\r\nof the sea. The Captain shook his hand without saying a word, but a\r\nmoment afterwards a sailor came up to Corsican, and, bowing awkwardly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy mates have sent me to say that you are a very kind\r\ngentleman, and they all thank you in the name of poor Wilson, who cannot\r\nthank you for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain, moved by the rough sailor\xe2\x80\x99s speech, silently pressed his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAs for the pilot, he was a man of short stature, with not much of the\r\nsailor-look about him. He wore a glazed hat, black trousers, a brown\r\novercoat lined with red, and carried an umbrella. He was master on board\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIn springing on deck, before he went to the bridge, he had thrown a\r\nbundle of papers among the passengers, who eagerly pounced on them. They\r\nwere European and American journals\xe2\x80\x94the political and civil bonds which\r\nagain united the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d to the two continents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm was gathering, and a black arch of clouds had formed over our\r\nheads; the atmosphere was misty; nature was evidently about to justify\r\nDr. Pitferge\xe2\x80\x99s presentiments. The steam-ship had slackened her speed,\r\nand the wheels only made three or four revolutions a minute; volumes of\r\nwhite steam escaped from the half-open valves, the anchor-chains were\r\ncleared, and the British flag floated from the main-mast; these\r\narrangements Captain Anderson had made preparatory to mooring. The\r\npilot, standing on the top of the starboard paddle, guided the\r\nsteam-ship through the narrow passages; but the tide was already\r\nturning, so that the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d could not yet cross the bar of the\r\nHudson, and we must wait till next day.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter to five by the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s order the anchors were let go; the\r\nchains rattled through the hawse-holes with a noise like thunder. I even\r\nthought for a moment that the storm had burst forth. When the anchors\r\nwere firmly embedded in the sand, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d swung round by the\r\nebb tide, remained motionless, and not a wave disturbed the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the steward\xe2\x80\x99s trumpet sounded for the last time; it\r\ncalled the passengers to their farewell dinner. The \xe2\x80\x9cSociety of\r\nFreighters\xe2\x80\x9d would be prodigal with the champagne, and no one wished to\r\nbe absent. An hour later the saloons were crowded with guests, and the\r\ndeck deserted.\r\n\r\nHowever, seven persons left their places unoccupied; the two\r\nadversaries, who were going to stake their lives in a duel, the four\r\nseconds, and the Doctor, who was to be present at the engagement. The\r\ntime and the place for the meeting had been well chosen; there was not a\r\ncreature on deck; the passengers were in the dining-rooms, the sailors\r\nin their berths, the officers absorbed with their own particular\r\nbottles, and not a steersman on board, for the ship was motionless at\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes past five the Doctor and I were joined by Fabian and\r\nCaptain Corsican. I had not seen Fabian since the scene in the\r\nsmoking-room. He seemed to me sad, but very calm. The thought of the\r\nduel troubled him little, apparently; his mind was elsewhere, and his\r\neyes wandered restlessly in search of Ellen. He held out his hand to me\r\nwithout saying a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas not Harry Drake arrived?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the stern; that is the place of rendezvous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFabian, Captain Corsican, and I, walked along the upper decks; the sky\r\nwas growing dark; we heard the distant roar of thunder rumbling along\r\nthe horizon. It was like a monotonous bass, enlivened by the hips and\r\nhurrahs issuing from the saloons; flashes of lightning darted through\r\nthe black clouds, and the atmosphere was powerfully charged with\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nAt twenty minutes past five Harry Drake and his seconds made their\r\nappearance. The gentlemen bowed to us, which honour we strictly\r\nreturned. Drake did not utter a word, but his face showed signs of\r\nill-concealed excitement. He cast a look of malignant hatred on Fabian;\r\nbut the latter, leaning against the hatchway, did not even see him; so\r\nabsorbed was he in a profound meditation, he seemed not yet to have\r\nthought of the part he was to play in this drama.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Captain Corsican, addressing himself to the Yankee, one\r\nof Drake\xe2\x80\x99s seconds, asked him for the swords, which the latter presented\r\nto him. They were battle swords, the basket-hilts of which entirely\r\nprotected the hand which held them. Corsican took them, bent, and\r\nmeasured them, and then allowed the Yankee to choose. Whilst these\r\npreparations were being made, Harry Drake had taken off his hat and\r\njacket, unbuttoned his shirt, and turned up his sleeves; then he seized\r\nhis sword, and I saw that he was left-handed, which gave him, accustomed\r\nto right-handed antagonists, an unquestionable advantage.\r\n\r\nFabian had not yet left the place where he was standing. One would have\r\nthought that these preparations had nothing to do with him. Captain\r\nCorsican went up to him, touched him, and showed him the sword. Fabian\r\nlooked at the glittering steel, and it seemed as if his memory came back\r\nto him at that moment.\r\n\r\nHe grasped his sword with a firm hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; \xe2\x80\x9cI remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he placed himself opposite Harry Drake, who immediately assumed the\r\ndefensive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProceed, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\nThey immediately crossed swords. From the first clashing of steel,\r\nseveral rapid passes on both sides, certain extrications, parries, and\r\nthrusts proved to me the equality in strength of the opponents. I\r\naugured well for Fabian. He was cool, self-possessed, and almost\r\nindifferent to the struggle; certainly less affected by it than were his\r\nown seconds. Harry Drake, on the contrary, scowled at him with flashing\r\neyes and clenched teeth, his head bent forward, and his whole\r\ncountenance indicative of a hatred which deprived him of all composure.\r\nHe had come there to kill, and kill he would.\r\n\r\nAfter the first engagement, which lasted some minutes, swords were\r\nlowered. With the exception of a slight scratch on Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s arm, neither\r\nof the combatants had been wounded. They rested, and Drake wiped off the\r\nperspiration with which his face was bathed.\r\n\r\nThe storm now burst forth in all its fury. The thunder was continuous,\r\nand broke out in loud deafening reports; the atmosphere was charged with\r\nelectricity to such an extent that the swords were gilded with luminous\r\ncrests, like lightning conductors in the midst of thunder clouds.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 rest, Corsican again gave the signal to proceed,\r\nand Fabian and Harry Drake again fell to work.\r\n\r\nThis time the fight was much more animated; Fabian defending himself\r\nwith astounding calmness, Drake madly attacking him. Several times I\r\nexpected a stroke from Fabian, which was not even attempted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, after some quick passes, Drake made a rapid stroke. I thought\r\nthat Fabian must have been struck in the chest, but, warding off the\r\nblow, he struck Harry Drake\xe2\x80\x99s sword smartly. The latter raised and\r\ncovered himself by a swift semi-circle; whilst the lightning rent the\r\nclouds overhead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, and without anything to explain this strange surrender of\r\nhimself, Fabian dropped his sword. Had he been mortally wounded without\r\nour noticing it? The blood rushed wildly to my heart. Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had\r\ngrown singularly animated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefend yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d roared Drake, drawing himself up like a tiger ready\r\nto spring on to his prey.\r\n\r\nI thought that it was all over with Fabian, disarmed as he was. Corsican\r\nthrew himself between him and his enemy, to prevent the latter from\r\nstriking a defenceless man; but now Harry Drake in his turn stood\r\nmotionless.\r\n\r\nI turned, and saw Ellen, pale as death, her hands stretched out, coming\r\ntowards the duellists. Fabian, fascinated by this apparition, remained\r\nperfectly still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry Drake to Ellen; \xe2\x80\x9cyou here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I TURNED, AND SAW ELLEN, PALE AS DEATH.]\r\n\r\nHis uplifted blade gleamed as though on fire; one might have said it was\r\nthe sword of the archangel Michael in the hands of a demon.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a brilliant flash of lightning lit up the whole stern. I was\r\nalmost knocked down, and felt suffocated, for the air was filled with\r\nsulphur; but by a powerful effort I regained my senses.\r\n\r\nI had fallen on one knee, but I got up and looked around. Ellen was\r\nleaning on Fabian. Harry Drake seemed petrified, and remained in the\r\nsame position, but his face had grown black.\r\n\r\nHad the unhappy man been struck when attracting the lightning with his\r\nblade?\r\n\r\nEllen left Fabian, and went up to Drake with her face full of holy\r\ncompassion. She placed her hand on his shoulder; even this light touch\r\nwas enough to disturb the equilibrium, and Drake fell to the ground a\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nEllen bent over the body, whilst we drew back terrified. The wretched\r\nHarry Drake was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStruck by lightning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean Pitferge, catching hold of my arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStruck by lightning! Ah! will you not now believe in the intervention\r\nof thunder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad Harry Drake indeed been struck by lightning as Dean Pitferge\r\naffirmed, or rather, as the doctor on board said, had a blood-vessel\r\nbroken in his chest? I can only say there was nothing now but a corpse\r\nbefore our eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Tuesday, the 9th of April, the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d weighed\r\nanchor, and set sail to enter the Hudson, the pilot guiding her with an\r\nunerring eye. The storm had spent itself in the night, and the last\r\nblack clouds disappeared below the horizon. The aspect of the sea was\r\nenlivened by a flotilla of schooners, waiting along the coast for the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nA small steamer came alongside, and we were boarded by the officer of\r\nthe New York sanitary commissioners.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before we passed the light-boat which marks the channels\r\nof the Hudson, and ranged near Sandy Hook Point, where a group of\r\nspectators greeted us with a volley of hurrahs.\r\n\r\nWhen the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d had gone round the interior bay formed by Sandy\r\nHook Point, through the flotilla of fishing-smacks, I caught a glimpse\r\nof the verdant heights of New Jersey, the enormous forts on the bay,\r\nthen the low line of the great city stretching between the Hudson and\r\nEast river.\r\n\r\nIn another hour, after having ranged opposite the New York quays, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was moored in the Hudson, and the anchors became\r\nentangled in the submarine cable, which must necessarily be broken on\r\nher departure.\r\n\r\nThen began the disembarkation of all my fellow-voyagers whom I should\r\nnever see again: Californians, Southerners, Mormonites, and the young\r\nlovers. I was waiting for Fabian and Corsican.\r\n\r\nI had been obliged to inform Captain Anderson of the incidents relating\r\nto the duel which had taken place on board. The doctors made their\r\nreport, and nothing whatever having been found wrong in the death of\r\nHarry Drake, orders were given that the last duties might be rendered to\r\nhim on land.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Cockburn, the statistician, who had not spoken to me the\r\nwhole of the voyage, came up and said,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, sir, how many turns the wheels have made during our\r\npassage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred thousand, seven hundred and twenty-three.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! really sir, and the screw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix hundred and eight thousand, one hundred and thirty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to you, sir, for the information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the statistician left me without any farewell whatever.\r\n\r\nFabian and Corsican joined me at this moment. Fabian pressed my hand\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEllen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to me, \xe2\x80\x9cEllen will recover. Her reason came back to her\r\nfor a moment. Ah! God is just, and He will restore her wholly to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhilst thus speaking, Fabian smiled as he thought of the future. As for\r\nCaptain Corsican, he kissed me heartily without any ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, good-bye, we shall see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried to me, when he\r\nhad taken his place in the tender where were Fabian and Ellen, under the\r\ncare of Mrs. R\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, Captain Mac Elwin\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who had come to meet her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThen the tender sheered off, taking the first convoy of passengers to\r\nthe Custom House pier.\r\n\r\nI watched them as they went farther and farther away, and, seeing Ellen\r\nsitting between Fabian and his sister, I could not doubt that care,\r\ndevotion, and love would restore to this poor mind the reason of which\r\ngrief had robbed it.\r\n\r\nJust then some one took hold of my arm, and I knew it was Dr. Pitferge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand what is going to become of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea was, Doctor, since the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99 remains a hundred and\r\nninety-two hours at New York, and as I must return with her, to spend\r\nthe hundred and ninety-two hours in America. Certainly it is but a week,\r\nbut a week well spent is, perhaps, long enough to see New York, the\r\nHudson, the Mohawk Valley, Lake Erie, Niagara, and all the country made\r\nfamiliar by Cooper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you are going to the Niagara!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dean Pitferge. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll declare I\r\nshould not be sorry to see it again, and if my proposal does not seem\r\nvery disagreeable to you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe worthy Doctor amused me with his crotchets. I had taken a fancy to\r\nhim, and here was a well-instructed guide placed at my service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s settled, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later we embarked on the tender and at three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock were comfortably lodged in two rooms of Fifth Avenue Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week to spend in America! The \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern\xe2\x80\x9d was to set sail on the\r\n16th of April, and it was now the 9th, and three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nafternoon, when I set foot on the land of the Union. A week! There are\r\nfurious tourists and express travellers who would probably find this\r\ntime enough to visit the whole of North America; but I had no such\r\npretention, not even to visit New York thoroughly, and to write, after\r\nthis extra rapid inspection, a book on the manners and customs of the\r\nAmericans. But the constitution and physical aspect of New York is soon\r\nseen; it is hardly more varied than a chess-board. The streets, cut at\r\nright angles, are called avenues when they are straight, and streets\r\nwhen irregular. The numbers on the principal thoroughfares are a very\r\npractical but monotonous arrangement. American cars run through all the\r\navenues. Any one who has seen one quarter of New York knows the whole of\r\nthe great city, except, perhaps, that intricacy of streets and confused\r\nalleys appropriated by the commercial population.\r\n\r\nNew York is built on a tongue of land, and all its activity is centred\r\non the end of that tongue; on either side extend the Hudson and East\r\nRiver, arms of the sea, in fact, on which ships are seen and ferry-boats\r\nply, connecting the town on the right hand with Brooklyn, and on the\r\nleft with the shores of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nA single artery intersects the symmetrical quarters of New York, and\r\nthat is old Broadway, the Strand of London, and the Boulevard Montmartre\r\nof Paris; hardly passable at its lower end, where it is crowded with\r\npeople, and almost deserted higher up; a street where sheds and marble\r\npalaces are huddled together; a stream of carriages, omnibusses, cabs,\r\ndrays, and waggons, with the pavement for its banks, across which a\r\nbridge has been thrown for the traffic of foot passengers. Broadway is\r\nNew York, and it was there that the Doctor and I walked until evening.\r\n\r\nAfter having dined at Fifth Avenue Hotel, I ended my day\xe2\x80\x99s work by going\r\nto the Barnum Theatre, where they were acting a play called \xe2\x80\x9cNew York\r\nStreets,\xe2\x80\x9d which attracted a large audience. In the fourth Act there was\r\na fire, and real fire-engines, worked by real firemen; hence the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\r\nattraction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning I left the Doctor to his own affairs, and agreed to\r\nmeet him at the hotel at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. My first proceeding was to go to\r\nthe Post Office, 51, Liberty Street, to get any letters awaiting me\r\nthere; then I went to No. 2, Bowling Green, at the bottom of Broadway,\r\nthe residence of the French consul, M. le Baron Gauldr\xc3\xa9e Boilleau, who\r\nreceived me very kindly. From here I made my way to cash a draft at\r\nHoffman\xe2\x80\x99s; lastly, I went to No. 25, Thirty-sixth Street, where resided\r\nMrs. R\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s sister. I was impatient to get news of Ellen and my\r\ntwo friends; and here I learnt that, following the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s advice, Mrs.\r\nR\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, Fabian, and Corsican had left New York, taking with them the young\r\nlady, thinking that the air and quiet of the country might have a\r\nbeneficial effect on her. A line from Captain Corsican informed me of\r\nthis sudden departure. The kind fellow had been to Fifth Avenue Hotel\r\nwithout meeting me, but he promised to keep me acquainted with their\r\nwhereabouts. They thought of stopping at the first place that attracted\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and, staying there as long as the charm lasted; he\r\nhoped that I should not leave without bidding them a last farewell. Yes,\r\nwere it but for a few hours, I should be happy to see Ellen, Fabian, and\r\nCorsican once again. But such are the drawbacks of travelling, hurried\r\nas I was, they gone and I going, each our separate ways, it seemed\r\nhardly likely I should see them again.\r\n\r\nAt two o\xe2\x80\x99clock I returned to the hotel, and found the Doctor in the\r\nbar-room, which was full of people. It is a public hall, where\r\ntravellers and passers-by mingled together, finding gratis iced-water,\r\nbiscuits, and cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen shall we start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt six o\xe2\x80\x99clock this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we take the Hudson railroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the \xe2\x80\x98St. John;\xe2\x80\x99 a wonderful steamer, another world\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98Great\r\nEastern\xe2\x80\x99 of the river, one of those admirable locomotive engines which\r\ngo along with a will. I should have preferred showing you the Hudson by\r\ndaylight, but the \xe2\x80\x98St. John\xe2\x80\x99 only goes at night. To-morrow, at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, we shall be at Albany. At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock we shall\r\ntake the New York Central Railroad, and in the evening we shall sup at\r\nNiagara Falls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not discuss the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s programme, but accepted it willingly.\r\n\r\nThe hotel lift hoisted us to our rooms, and some minutes later we\r\ndescended with our tourist knapsacks. A fly took us in a quarter of an\r\nhour to the pier on the Hudson, before which was the \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nchimneys of which were already crowned with wreaths of smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John,\xe2\x80\x9d and its sister ship, the \xe2\x80\x9cDean Richmond,\xe2\x80\x9d are two of the\r\nfinest steam-ships on the river. They are buildings rather than boats;\r\nterraces rise one above another, with galleries and verandahs. One would\r\nalmost have thought it was a gardener\xe2\x80\x99s floating plantation. There are\r\ntwenty flag-staffs, fastened with iron tressings, which consolidate the\r\nwhole building. The two enormous paddle-boxes are painted _al fresco_,\r\nlike the tympans in the Church of St. Mark, at Venice. Behind each wheel\r\nrises the chimney of the two boilers, the latter placed outside, instead\r\nof in the hull of the steam-ship, a good precaution in case of\r\nexplosion. In the centre, between the paddles, is the machinery, which\r\nis very simple, consisting only of a single cylinder, a piston worked by\r\na long cross-beam, which rises and falls like the monstrous hammer of a\r\nforge, and a single crank, communicating the movement to the axles of\r\nthe massive wheels.\r\n\r\nPassengers were already crowding on to the deck of the \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John.\xe2\x80\x9d Dean\r\nPitferge and I went to secure a cabin; we got one which opened into an\r\nimmense saloon, a kind of gallery with a vaulted ceiling, supported by a\r\nsuccession of Corinthian pillars. Comfort and luxury everywhere,\r\ncarpets, sofas, ottomans, paintings, mirrors, even gas, made in a small\r\ngasometer on board.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the gigantic engine trembled and began to work. I went on\r\nto the upper terraces. At the stern was a gaily painted house, which was\r\nthe steersman\xe2\x80\x99s room, where four strong men stood at the spokes of the\r\ndouble rudder-wheel. After walking about for a few minutes, I went down\r\non to the deck, between the already heated boilers, from which light\r\nblue flames were issuing. Of the Hudson I could see nothing. Night came,\r\nand with it a fog thick enough to be cut. The \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John\xe2\x80\x9d snorted in the\r\ngloom like a true mastodon; we could hardly catch a glimpse of the\r\nlights of the towns scattered along the banks of the river, or the\r\nlanterns of ships ascending the dark water with shrill whistles.\r\n\r\nAt eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock I went into the saloon. The Doctor took me to have\r\nsupper at a magnificent restaurant placed between the decks, where we\r\nwere served by an army of black waiters. Dean Pitferge informed me that\r\nthe number of passengers on board was more than four thousand, reckoning\r\nfifteen hundred emigrants stowed away in the lower part of the\r\nsteam-ship. Supper finished, we retired to our comfortable cabin.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock I was aroused by a slight shock. The \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nstopped. The captain, finding it impossible to proceed in the darkness,\r\nhad given orders to heave-to, and the enormous boat, moored in the\r\nchannel, slept tranquilly at anchor.\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John\xe2\x80\x9d resumed her course. I got\r\nup and went out under one of the verandahs. The rain had ceased, the fog\r\ncleared off, the water appeared, then the shores; the right bank, dotted\r\nwith green trees and shrubs, which gave it the appearance of a long\r\ncemetery; in the background rose high hills, closing in the horizon by a\r\ngraceful line; the left bank, on the contrary, was flat and marshy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FOG CLEARED OFF.]\r\n\r\nDr. Pitferge had just joined me under the verandah.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after having drawn a good breath of\r\nair; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know we shall not be at Albany in time to catch the train,\r\nthanks to that wretched fog. This will modify my programme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse, Doctor, for we must be economical with our time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight; we may expect to reach Niagara Falls at night instead of in the\r\nevening. That is not my fault, but we must be resigned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cSt. John,\xe2\x80\x9d in fact, did not moor off the Albany quay before eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. The train had left, so we were obliged to wait till half-past\r\none. In consequence of this delay we were able to visit the curious old\r\ncity, which forms the legislative centre of the State of New York: the\r\nlower town, commercial and thickly populated, on the right bank of the\r\nHudson, and the high town, with its brick houses, public buildings, and\r\nits very remarkable museum of fossils. One might almost have thought it\r\na large quarter of New York transported to the side of this hill, up\r\nwhich it rises in the shape of an amphitheatre.\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, after having breakfasted, we went to the station, which\r\nwas without any barrier or officials. The train simply stopped in the\r\nmiddle of the street, like an omnibus; one could get up and down at\r\npleasure. The cars communicate with each other by bridges, which allow\r\nthe traveller to go from one end of the train to the other. At the\r\nappointed time, without seeing either a guard or a porter, without a\r\nbell, without any warning, the brisk locomotive, a real gem of\r\nworkmanship, started, and we were whirled away at the speed of fifty\r\nmiles an hour. But instead of being boxed up, as one is in European\r\ntrains, we were at liberty to walk about, buy newspapers and books,\r\nwithout waiting for stations. Refreshment buffets, bookstalls,\r\neverything was at hand for the traveller. We were now crossing fields\r\nwithout fences, and forests newly cleared, at the risk of a collision\r\nwith the felled trees; through new towns, seamed with rails, but still\r\nwanting in houses; through cities adorned with the most poetic names of\r\nancient literature\xe2\x80\x94Rome, Syracuse, and Palmyra. It was thus the Mohawk\r\nValley, the land of Fenimore, which belongs to the American novelist, as\r\ndoes the land of Rob Roy to Walter Scott, glided before our eyes. For a\r\nmoment Lake Ontario, which Cooper has made the scene of action of his\r\nmaster-work, sparkled on the horizon. All this theatre of the grand\r\nepopee of Leather Stocking, formerly a savage country, is now a\r\ncivilized land. The Doctor did not appreciate the change, for he\r\npersisted in calling me Hawk\xe2\x80\x99s Eye, and would only answer to the name of\r\nChingachgook.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night we changed trains at Rochester; the spray\r\nfrom the Tennessee cascades fell over the cars in showers. At two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, after having kept alongside the Niagara for\r\nseveral leagues without seeing it, we arrived at the village of Niagara\r\nFalls, and the Doctor conducted me to a magnificent hotel, grandly named\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCataract House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Niagara is not a stream, not even a river; it is simply a weir\r\nsluice, a canal thirty-six miles long, which empties the waters of the\r\nLakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie into the Ontario. The\r\ndifference in the level of these last two lakes is three hundred and\r\nforty feet; this difference uniformly proportioned the whole of the\r\nwidth would hardly have created a \xe2\x80\x9crapid;\xe2\x80\x9d but the Falls alone absorb\r\nhalf the difference in level, whence their formidable power.\r\n\r\nThis Niagarine trench separates the United States from Canada. Its right\r\nbank is American and its left English; on one side policemen, on the\r\nother not the shadow of one.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 12th of April, at break of day, the Doctor and I\r\nwalked down the wide street of Niagara Falls, which is the name of the\r\nvillage situated on the banks of the Falls. It is a kind of small\r\nwatering-place, three hundred miles from Albany, built in a healthy and\r\ncharming situation, provided with sumptuous hotels and comfortable\r\nvillas, which the Yankees and Canadians frequent in the season. The\r\nweather was magnificent, the sun warmed the cold atmosphere, a dull,\r\ndistant roar was heard, and I saw vapours on the horizon which could not\r\nbe clouds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the Fall?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked of the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pitferge.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes we were on the banks of the Niagara. The river was\r\nflowing peacefully along; it was clear, and not deep, with numerous\r\nprojections of grey rock emerging here and there. The roar of the\r\ncataract grew louder and louder, but as yet we could not see it. A\r\nwooden bridge, supported by iron arches, united the left bank to an\r\nisland in the midst of the current; on to this bridge the Doctor led me.\r\nAbove, stretched the river as far as the eye could reach; down the\r\nstream, that is to say on our right, the first unevenness of a rapid was\r\nnoticeable; then, at half a mile from the bridge, the earth suddenly\r\ngave way, and clouds of spray filled the air. This was the American\r\nfall, which we could not see. Beyond, on the Canadian side, lay a\r\npeaceful country, with hills, villas, and bare trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t look! don\xe2\x80\x99t look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Doctor to me; \xe2\x80\x9creserve yourself,\r\nshut your eyes, and do not open them until I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI hardly listened to my original, but continued to look. The bridge\r\ncrossed, we set foot on the island known as Goat Island. It is a piece\r\nof land of about seventy acres, covered with trees, and intersected with\r\nlovely avenues with carriage drives. It is like a bouquet thrown between\r\nthe American and Canadian Falls, separated from the shore by a distance\r\nof three hundred yards. We ran under the great trees, climbed the\r\nslopes, and went down the steps; the thundering roar of the falls was\r\nredoubled, and the air saturated with spray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Doctor.\r\n\r\nComing from behind a mass of rock, the Niagara appeared in all its\r\nsplendour. At this spot it meets with a sharp angle of land, and falling\r\nround it, forms the Canadian cascade, called the \xe2\x80\x9cHorse-shoe Fall,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich falls from a height of one hundred and fifty-eight feet, and is\r\ntwo miles broad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURE HAS COMBINED EVERYTHING TO ASTONISH THE EYE]\r\n\r\nIn this, one of the most beautiful spots in the world, Nature has\r\ncombined everything to astonish the eye. The fall of the Niagara\r\nsingularly favours the effects of light and shade; the sunbeams falling\r\non the water, capriciously diversify the colour; and those who have seen\r\nthis effect, must admit that it is without parallel. In fact, near Goat\r\nIsland the foam is white; it is then a fall of snow, or a heap of melted\r\nsilver, pouring into the abyss. In the centre of the cataract the colour\r\nof the water is a most beautiful sea-green, which indicates its depth,\r\nso that the \xe2\x80\x9cDetroit,\xe2\x80\x9d a ship drawing twenty feet and launched on the\r\ncurrent, was able to descend the falls without grazing. Towards the\r\nCanadian shore the whirlpool, on the contrary, looks like metal shining\r\nbeneath the luminous rays, and it is melted gold which is now poured\r\ninto the gulf. Below, the river is invisible from the vapours which rise\r\nover it. I caught glimpses, however, of enormous blocks of ice\r\naccumulated by the cold of winter; they take the form of monsters,\r\nwhich, with open jaws, hourly absorb the hundred millions of tons poured\r\ninto them by the inexhaustible Niagara. Half a mile below the cataract\r\nthe river again became tranquil, and presented a smooth surface, which\r\nthe winds of April had not yet been able to ruffle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now for the middle of the torrent,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor to me.\r\n\r\nI could not imagine what the Doctor meant by those words, until he\r\npointed to a tower built on the edge of a rock some hundred feet from\r\nthe shore, almost overhanging the precipice. This monument, raised in\r\n1833, by a certain audacious being, one Judge Porter, is called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrapin Tower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went down the steps of Goat Island, and, coming to the height of the\r\nupper course of the Niagara, I saw a bridge, or rather some planks,\r\nthrown from one rock to the other, which united the tower with the banks\r\nof the river. The bridge was but a few feet from the abyss, and below it\r\nroared the torrent. We ventured on these planks, and in a few minutes\r\nreached the rock which supported Terrapin Tower. This round tower,\r\nforty-five feet in height, is built of stone, with a circular balcony at\r\nits summit, and a roof covered with red stucco. The winding staircase,\r\non which thousands of names are cut, is wooden. Once at the top of the\r\ntower, there is nothing to do but cling to the balcony and look.\r\n\r\nThe tower is in the midst of the cataract. From its summit the eye\r\nplunges into the depths of the abyss, and peers into the very jaws of\r\nthe ice monsters, as they swallow the torrent. One feels the rock\r\ntremble which supports it. It is impossible to hear anything but the\r\nroaring of the surging water. The spray rises to the top of the\r\nmonument, and splendid rainbows are formed by the sun shining on the\r\nvapourized water.\r\n\r\nBy a simple optical illusion, the tower seems to move with a frightful\r\nrapidity, but, happily, in the opposite direction to the fall, for, with\r\nthe contrary illusion, it would be impossible to look at the gulf from\r\ngiddiness.\r\n\r\nBreathless and shivering, we went for a moment inside the top landing of\r\nthe tower, and it was then that the Doctor took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis Terrapin Tower, my dear sir, will some day fall into the abyss,\r\nand perhaps sooner than is expected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt about it. The great Canadian Fall recedes insensibly,\r\nbut still, it recedes. The tower, when it was first built in 1833, was\r\nmuch farther from the cataract. Geologists say that the fall, in the\r\nspace of thirty-five thousand years, will be found at Queenstown, seven\r\nmiles up the stream. According to Mr. Bakewell, it recedes a yard in a\r\nyear; but according to Sir Charles Lyell one foot only. The time will\r\ncome when the rock which supports the tower, worn away by the water,\r\nwill glide down the Falls of the cataract. Well, my dear sir, remember\r\nthis: the day when the Terrapin Tower falls, there will be some\r\neccentrics who will descend the Niagara with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at the Doctor, as if to ask him if he would be of that number,\r\nbut he signed for me to follow him, and we went out again to look at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorse-shoe Fall,\xe2\x80\x9d and the surrounding country. We could now distinguish\r\nthe American Fall, slightly curtailed and separated by a projection of\r\nthe island, where there is another small central cataract one hundred\r\nfeet wide; the American cascade, equally fine, falls perpendicularly.\r\nIts height is one hundred and sixty-four feet. But in order to have a\r\ngood view of it it is necessary to stand facing it, on the Canadian\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAll day we wandered on the banks of the Niagara, irresistibly drawn back\r\nto the tower, where the roar of the water, the spray, the sunlight\r\nplaying on the vapours, the excitement, and the briny odour of the\r\ncataract, holds you in a perpetual ecstasy. Then we went back to Goat\r\nIsland to get the Fall from every point of view, without ever being\r\nwearied of looking at it. The Doctor would have taken me to see the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrotto of Winds,\xe2\x80\x9d hollowed out underneath the central Fall, but access\r\nto it was not allowed, on account of the frequent falling away of the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAt five o\xe2\x80\x99clock we went back to the hotel, and after a hasty dinner,\r\nserved in the American fashion, we returned to Goat Island. The Doctor\r\nwished to go and see the \xe2\x80\x9cThree Sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d charming little islets\r\nscattered at the head of the island; then, with the return of evening,\r\nhe led me back to the tottering rock of Terrapin Tower.\r\n\r\nThe last rays of the setting sun had disappeared behind the grey hills,\r\nand the moon shed her soft clear light over the landscape. The shadow of\r\nthe tower stretched across the abyss; farther down the stream the water\r\nglided silently along, crowned with a light mist. The Canadian shore,\r\nalready plunged in darkness, contrasted vividly with the moon-lit banks\r\nof Goat Island, and the village of Niagara Falls. Below us, the gulf,\r\nmagnified by the uncertain light, looked like a bottomless abyss, in\r\nwhich roared the formidable torrent. What effect! What artist could ever\r\ndepict such a scene, either with the pen or paint-brush? For some\r\nminutes a moving light appeared on the horizon; it was the signal light\r\nof a train crossing the Niagara bridge at a distance of two miles from\r\nus. Here we remained silent and motionless on the top of the tower until\r\nmidnight, leaning over the waters which possessed such a fascination.\r\nOnce, when the moon-beams caught the liquid dust at a certain angle, I\r\nhad a glimpse of a milky band of transparent ribbon trembling in the\r\nshadows. It was a lunar rainbow, a pale irradiation of the queen of the\r\nnight, whose soft light was refracted through the mist of the cataract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 13th of April, the Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s programme announced a\r\nvisit to the Canadian shore. We had only to follow the heights of the\r\nbank of the Niagara for two miles to reach the suspension bridge. We\r\nstarted at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. From the winding path on the\r\nright bank we could see the tranquil waters of the river, which no\r\nlonger felt the perturbation of its fall.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven we reached the suspension bridge. It is the bridge,\r\non which the Great Western and New York Central Railroads meet, and the\r\nonly one which gives access to Canada on the confines of the State of\r\nNew York. This suspension bridge is formed of two platforms; the upper\r\none for trains, and the lower for carriages and pedestrians. Imagination\r\nseems to lose itself in contemplating this stupendous work. This\r\nviaduct, over which trains can pass, suspended at a height of two\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the Niagara, again transformed into a rapid\r\nat this spot. This suspension bridge, built by John A. Roebling, of\r\nTrenton (New Jersey), is eight hundred feet long, and twenty-four wide;\r\nthe iron props fastened to the shore prevent it from swinging; the\r\nchains which support it, formed of four thousand wires, are ten inches\r\nin diameter, and can bear a weight of twelve thousand four hundred tons.\r\nThe bridge itself weighs but eight hundred tons, and cost five hundred\r\nthousand dollars. Just as we reached the centre a train passed over our\r\nheads, and we felt the platform bend under its weight.\r\n\r\nIt is a little below this bridge that Blondin crossed the Niagara, on a\r\nrope stretched from one shore to the other, and not, as is generally\r\nsupposed, across the falls. However, the undertaking was none the less\r\nperilous; but if Blondin astonished us by his daring, what must we think\r\nof his friend who accompanied him, riding on his back during this aerial\r\npromenade?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he was a glutton,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor, \xe2\x80\x9cand Blondin made wonderful\r\nomelets on his tight-rope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were now on Canadian ground, and we walked up the left bank of the\r\nNiagara, in order to see the Falls under a new aspect. Half an hour\r\nlater we reached the English hotel, where the Doctor ordered our\r\nbreakfast, whilst I glanced through the \xe2\x80\x9cTravellers\xe2\x80\x99 Book,\xe2\x80\x9d where\r\nfigured several thousand names: among the most celebrated I noticed the\r\nfollowing:\xe2\x80\x94Robert Peel, Lady Franklin, Comte de Paris, Duc de Chartres,\r\nPrince de Joinville, Louis Napoleon (1846), Prince and Princess\r\nNapoleon, Barnum (with his address), Maurice Sand (1865), Agassis\r\n(1854), Almonte, Prince Hohenlohe, Rothschild, Bertin (Paris), Lady\r\nElgin, Burkhardt (1832), &c.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now let us go under the Falls,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Doctor to me, when we had\r\nfinished breakfast.\r\n\r\nI followed Dean Pitferge. A negro conducted us to the dressing-room,\r\nwhere we were provided with waterproof trousers, macintoshes, and glazed\r\nhats. Thus equipped, our guide led us down a slippery path, obstructed\r\nby sharp-edged stones, to the lower level of the Niagara. Then we passed\r\nbehind the great fall through clouds of spray, the cataract falling\r\nbefore us like the curtain of a theatre before the actors. But what a\r\ntheatre! Soaked, blinded, deafened, we could neither see nor hear in\r\nthis cavern as hermetically closed by the liquid sheets of the cataract\r\nas though Nature had sealed it in by a wall of granite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CATARACT FALLING BEFORE US.]\r\n\r\nAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock we returned to the hotel, where they relieved us of our\r\nstreaming clothes. Going back again to the bank, I uttered a cry of\r\nsurprise and joy,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Corsican!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain heard, and came towards me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a pleasure to see you again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Fabian? and Ellen?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, shaking both his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are here, and going on as well as possible; Fabian full of hope,\r\nalmost merry; and our poor Ellen little by little regaining reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how is it that I meet you at the Niagara?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Niagara,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Corsican. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is the principal resort of\r\nEnglish and Americans in the warm months. They come here to breathe, to\r\nbe cured by the sublime spectacle of the Falls. Our Ellen seemed to be\r\nstruck at first sight by this glorious scenery, and we have come to stay\r\non the banks of the Niagara. You see that villa, \xe2\x80\x98Clifton House,\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nmidst of those trees, half way up the hill; that is where we all live,\r\nwith Mrs. R\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, Fabian\xe2\x80\x99s sister, who is devoted to our poor friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Ellen recognized Fabian?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are aware, however, that at the\r\nmoment when Drake was struck dead, Ellen had a brief interval of\r\nconsciousness. Her reason became clear in the gloom which surrounded\r\nher, but this did not last long. At the same time, since we brought her\r\nto breathe this fresh air in this quiet place, the doctor has discovered\r\na sensible improvement in her condition. She is calm, her sleep is\r\ntranquil, but there is a look in her eyes as though she were trying to\r\nthink of something past or present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear friend!\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will cure her; but where are Fabian\r\nand his betrothed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said Corsican, and he pointed towards the shore of the Niagara.\r\n\r\nIn the direction indicated by the Captain I saw Fabian, who had not yet\r\nnoticed us. He was standing on a rock, and a few feet in front of him\r\nsat Ellen perfectly motionless, Fabian watching her all the time. This\r\nspot on the left bank is known by the name of \xe2\x80\x9cTable Rock.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a kind\r\nof rocky promontory jutting out into the river, which roars at a\r\ndistance of four hundred feet below. Formerly it was more extensive, but\r\nthe crumbling away of large pieces of rock has now reduced it to a\r\nsurface a few yards square.\r\n\r\nEllen seemed absorbed in speechless ecstasy. From this place the aspect\r\nof the Falls is \xe2\x80\x9cmost sublime,\xe2\x80\x9d as say the guides, and they are right.\r\nIt gives a view of two cataracts; on the right the \xe2\x80\x9cCanadian Fall,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ncrest of which, crowned with vapours, shuts in the horizon on one side,\r\nlike the horizon of the sea. In front is the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Fall,\xe2\x80\x9d and above,\r\nthe elegant village of Niagara Falls, half hidden in the trees; on the\r\nleft, the whole perspective of the river flowing rapidly between its\r\nhigh banks, and below the torrent struggling against the overthrown\r\nicebergs.\r\n\r\nCorsican, the Doctor, and I went towards Table Rock, but I did not want\r\nto disturb Fabian. Ellen was as motionless as a statue. What impression\r\nwas this scene making on her mind? Was reason gradually coming back to\r\nher under the influence of the grand spectacle? Suddenly I saw Fabian\r\nstep towards her. Ellen had risen quickly, and was going near to the\r\nabyss, with her arms extended towards the gulf; but all at once she\r\nstopped, and passed her hand rapidly across her forehead, as if she\r\nwould drive away some thought. Fabian, pale as death, but\r\nself-possessed, with one bound placed himself between Ellen and the\r\nchasm; the latter shook back her fair hair, and her graceful figure\r\nstaggered. Did she see Fabian? No. One would have said it was a dead\r\nperson coming back to being, and looking round for life!\r\n\r\nCaptain Corsican and I dared not move, although, being so near the\r\nabyss, we dreaded some catastrophe; but the Doctor kept us back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Fabian alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI heard the sobs which escaped from the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s heaving breast,\r\nthe inarticulate words which came from her lips; she seemed as though\r\nshe were trying to speak, but could not. At last she uttered these\r\nwords:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God! my God! where am I, where am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was conscious that some one was near her, for she half turned round,\r\nand her whole face seemed transfigured. There was a new light in her\r\neyes, as she saw Fabian, trembling and speechless, standing before her\r\nwith outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cFABIAN! FABIAN!\xe2\x80\x9d CRIED SHE, \xe2\x80\x9cAT LAST.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFabian! Fabian!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, at last.\r\n\r\nFabian caught her in his arms, where she fell in an unconscious state.\r\nHe uttered a piercing cry, thinking that Ellen was dead, but the Doctor\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthis crisis, on the contrary, will be the\r\nmeans of saving her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEllen was carried to Clifton House and put to bed, where she recovered\r\nconsciousness and slept peacefully.\r\n\r\nFabian, encouraged by the Doctor, was full of hope. Ellen had recognized\r\nhim! Coming back to us, he said to me,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall save her, we shall save her! Every day I watch her coming back\r\nto life. To-day, to-morrow, perhaps she will be restored to me. Ah! the\r\njust God be praised! We will stay here as long as it is necessary for\r\nher, shall we not, Archibald?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain clasped Fabian in his arms; then the latter turned to the\r\nDoctor and me. He loaded us with thanks, and inspired us with the hope\r\nwhich filled his breast, and never was there better reason for\r\nhope\xe2\x80\x94Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s recovery was near at hand.\r\n\r\nBut we must be starting, and there was hardly an hour for us to reach\r\nNiagara Falls. Ellen was still sleeping when we left our dear friends.\r\nFabian and Corsican bid us a last farewell, after having promised we\r\nshould have news of Ellen by telegram, and at noon we left Clifton\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome minutes later we were descending a long flight of steps on the\r\nCanadian side, which led to the banks of the river, covered with huge\r\nsheets of ice. Here a boat was waiting to take us to \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\npassenger had already taken his place in it. He was an engineer from\r\nKentucky, and acquainted the Doctor with his name and profession. We\r\nembarked without loss of time, and by dint of steering, so as to avoid\r\nthe blocks of ice, reached the middle of the river, where the current\r\noffered a clear passage. From here we had a last view of the magnificent\r\nNiagara cataract. Our companion observed it with a thoughtful air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not grand, sir? Is it not magnificent?\xe2\x80\x9d said I to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what a waste of mechanical force, and what a\r\nmill might be turned with such a fall as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever did I feel more inclined to pitch an engineer into the water!\r\n\r\nOn the other bank a small and almost vertical railroad, worked by a rope\r\non the American side, hoisted us to the top. At half-past one we took\r\nthe express, which put us down at Buffalo at a quarter past two. After\r\nvisiting this large new town, and tasting the water of Lake Erie, we\r\nagain took the New York Central Railway at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening.\r\nThe next day, on leaving the comfortable beds of a \xe2\x80\x9csleeping car,\xe2\x80\x9d we\r\nfound ourselves at Albany, and the Hudson Railroad, which runs along the\r\nleft bank of the river, brought us to New York a few hours later.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 15th of April, in company with the indefatigable\r\nDoctor, I went over the city, East River, and Brooklyn. In the evening I\r\nbade farewell to the good Dean Pitferge, and I felt, in leaving him,\r\nthat I left a friend.\r\n\r\nTuesday, the 16th of April, was the day fixed for the departure of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern.\xe2\x80\x9d At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock I went to Thirty-seventh pier, where\r\nthe tender was to await the passengers. It was already filled with\r\npeople and luggage when I embarked. Just as the tender was leaving the\r\nquay some one caught hold of my arm, and turning round I saw Dr.\r\nPitferge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; \xe2\x80\x9cand are you going back to Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the amiable original, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cI have considered\r\nthe matter, and have come to the conclusion that I must go. Only think,\r\nthis may be the \xe2\x80\x98Great Eastern\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 _last voyage; the one which she will\r\nnever complete_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell for departure had rung, when one of the waiters from Fifth\r\nAvenue Hotel came running up to me, and put a telegram into my hands,\r\ndated from Niagara Falls:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEllen has awakened; her reason has entirely\r\nreturned to her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Corsican, \xe2\x80\x9cand the doctor has every hope\r\nof her recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI communicated this good news to Dean Pitferge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery hope for her indeed! every hope!\xe2\x80\x9d said my fellow-traveller, in a\r\nsarcastic tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI also have every hope for her, but what good does that\r\ndo? Any one may have great hopes for you, for me, for all of us, but at\r\nthe same time he may be just as much wrong as right.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nTwelve days later we reached Brest, and the day following Paris. The\r\nreturn passage was made without any misfortune, to the great displeasure\r\nof Dean Pitferge, who always expected to see the great ship wrecked.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when I am sitting at my own table, if I had not my daily notes\r\nbefore me, I should think that the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Eastern,\xe2\x80\x9d that floating city\r\nin which I lived for a month, the meeting of Ellen and Fabian, the\r\npeerless Niagara, all these were the visions of a dream. Ah! how\r\ndelightful is travelling, \xe2\x80\x9ceven when one does return,\xe2\x80\x9d in spite of what\r\nthe Doctor may say to the contrary.\r\n\r\nFor eight months I heard nothing of my original, but one day the post\r\nbrought me a letter, covered with many-coloured stamps, which began with\r\nthese words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn board the \xe2\x80\x98Corinquay,\xe2\x80\x99 Auckland Rocks. At last we have been\r\nshipwrecked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd ended thus:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas never in better health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                                   \xe2\x80\x9cVery heartily yours,\r\n                                                         DEAN PITFERGE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       END OF \xe2\x80\x9cA FLOATING CITY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BLOCKADE RUNNERS.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Table of contents\r\n\r\n       Chapter         Title                                Page\r\n       Chapter I.

It was in 1812, when the steamer called the \xe2\x80\x9cComet\xe2\x80\x9d ran\r\nbetween Glasgow and Greenock, at the speed of six miles an hour. Since\r\nthat time more than a million of steamers or packet-boats have plied\r\nthis Scotch river, and the inhabitants of Glasgow must be as familiar as\r\nany people with the wonders of steam navigation.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 3rd of December, 1862, an immense crowd, composed of\r\nship-owners, merchants, manufacturers, workmen, sailors, women, and\r\nchildren, thronged the muddy streets of Glasgow, all going in the\r\ndirection of Kelvin Dock, the large ship-building premises belonging to\r\nMessrs. Tod and Mac Gregor. This last name especially proves that the\r\ndescendants of the famous Highlanders have become manufacturers, and\r\nthat they have made workmen of all the vassals of the old clan\r\nchieftains.\r\n\r\nKelvin Dock is situated a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the town, on the right\r\nbank of the Clyde. Soon the immense timber-yards were thronged with\r\nspectators; not a part of the quay, not a wall of the wharf, not a\r\nfactory roof, showed an unoccupied place; the river itself was covered\r\nwith craft of all descriptions, and the heights of Govan, on the left\r\nbank, swarmed with spectators.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, nothing extraordinary in the event about to take\r\nplace; it was nothing but the launching of a ship, and this was an\r\nevery-day affair with the people of Glasgow. Had the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d then\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nthat was the name of the ship built by Messrs. Tod and Mac Gregor\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nspecial peculiarity? To tell the truth it had none.\r\n\r\nIt was a large ship, about 1500 tons, in which everything combined to\r\nobtain superior speed. Her engines, of 500 horse-power, were from the\r\nworkshops of Lancefield Forge; they worked two screws, one on either\r\nside the stern-post, completely independent of each other. As for the\r\ndepth of water the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d would draw, it must be very inconsiderable;\r\nconnoisseurs were not deceived, and they concluded rightly that this\r\nship was destined for shallow straits. But all these particulars could\r\nnot in any way justify the eagerness of the people: taken altogether the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was nothing more or less than an ordinary ship. Would her\r\nlaunching present some mechanical difficulty to be overcome? Not any\r\nmore than usual. The Clyde had received many a ship of heavier tonnage,\r\nand the launching of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d would take place in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when the water was calm, the moment the ebb-tide set in, the\r\nworkmen began to operate. Their mallets kept perfect time falling on the\r\nwedges meant to raise the ship\xe2\x80\x99s keel: soon a shudder ran through the\r\nwhole of her massive structure; although she had only been slightly\r\nraised, one could see that she shook, and then gradually began to glide\r\ndown the well-greased wedges, and in a few moments she plunged into the\r\nClyde. Her stern struck the muddy bed of the river, then she raised\r\nherself on the top of a gigantic wave, and, carried forward by her\r\nstart, would have been dashed against the quay of the Govan\r\ntimber-yards, if her anchors had not restrained her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHE PLUNGED INTO THE CLYDE.]\r\n\r\nThe launch had been perfectly successful, the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d swayed quietly\r\non the waters of the Clyde, all the spectators clapped their hands when\r\nshe took possession of her natural element, and loud hurrahs arose from\r\neither bank.\r\n\r\nBut wherefore these cries and this applause? Undoubtedly the most eager\r\nof the spectators would have been at a loss to explain the reason of his\r\nenthusiasm. What was the cause, then, of the lively interest excited by\r\nthis ship? Simply the mystery which shrouded her destination; it was not\r\nknown to what kind of commerce she was to be appropriated, and in\r\nquestioning different groups the diversity of opinion on this important\r\nsubject was indeed astonishing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the best informed, at least those who pretended to be so,\r\nagreed in saying that the steamer was going to take part in the terrible\r\nwar which was then ravaging the United States of America, but more than\r\nthis they did not know, and whether the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was a privateer, a\r\ntransport ship, or an addition to the Federal marine, was what no one\r\ncould tell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried one, affirming that the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d had been built for the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHip! hip! hip!\xe2\x80\x9d cried another, swearing that never had a faster boat\r\ncrossed to the American coasts.\r\n\r\nThus its destination was unknown, and in order to obtain any reliable\r\ninformation one must be an intimate friend, or, at any rate, an\r\nacquaintance of Vincent Playfair and Co., of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nA rich, powerful, intelligent house of business was that of Vincent\r\nPlayfair and Co., in a social sense, an old and honourable family,\r\ndescended from those tobacco lords who built the finest quarters of the\r\ntown. These clever merchants, by an act of the Union, had founded the\r\nfirst Glasgow warehouse for dealing in tobacco from Virginia and\r\nMaryland. Immense fortunes were realized; mills and foundries sprang up\r\nin all parts, and in a few years the prosperity of the city attained its\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nThe house of Playfair remained faithful to the enterprising spirit of\r\nits ancestors, it entered into the most daring schemes, and maintained\r\nthe honour of English commerce. The principal, Vincent Playfair, a man\r\nof fifty, with a temperament essentially practical and decided, although\r\nsomewhat daring, was a genuine shipowner. Nothing affected him beyond\r\ncommercial questions, not even the political side of the transactions,\r\notherwise he was a perfectly loyal and honest man.\r\n\r\nHowever, he could not lay claim to the idea of building and fitting up\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin;\xe2\x80\x9d she belonged to his nephew, James Playfair, a fine young\r\nman of thirty, the boldest skipper of the British merchant marine.\r\n\r\nIt was one day at the Tontine coffee-room under the arcades of the\r\nTown-hall, that James Playfair, after having impatiently scanned the\r\nAmerican journal, disclosed to his uncle an adventurous scheme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Vincent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming to the point at once, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are two\r\nmillions of pounds to be gained in less than a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what to risk?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Uncle Vincent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ship and a cargo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, except the crew and the captain, and that does not reckon for\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Vincent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all seen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have read the _Tribune_,\r\nthe _New York Herald_, the _Times_, the _Richmond Inquirer_, the\r\n_American Review_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScores of times, nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe, like me, that the war of the United States will last a\r\nlong time still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know how much this struggle will affect the interests of England,\r\nand especially those of Glasgow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd more especially still the house of Playfair and Co.,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Uncle\r\nVincent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheirs especially,\xe2\x80\x9d added the young Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI worry myself about it every day, James, and I cannot think without\r\nterror of the commercial disasters which this war may produce; not but\r\nthat the house of Playfair is firmly established, nephew; at the same\r\ntime it has correspondents which may fail. Ah! those Americans,\r\nslave-holders or abolitionists, I have no faith in them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Vincent Playfair was wrong in thus speaking with respect to the great\r\nprinciples of humanity, always and everywhere superior to personal\r\ninterests, he was, nevertheless, right in a commercial point of view.\r\nThe most important material was failing at Glasgow, the cotton famine\r\nbecame every day more threatening, thousands of workmen were reduced to\r\nlive upon public charity. Glasgow possessed 25,000 looms, by which\r\n625,000 yards of cotton were spun daily; that is to say, fifty millions\r\nof pounds yearly. From these numbers it may be guessed what disturbances\r\nwere caused in the commercial part of the town, when the raw material\r\nfailed altogether. Failures were hourly taking place, the manufactories\r\nwere closed, and the workmen were dying of starvation.\r\n\r\nIt was the sight of this great misery which had put the idea of his bold\r\nenterprise into James Playfair\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go for cotton, and will get it, cost what it may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut as he also was a merchant as well as his uncle Vincent, he resolved\r\nto carry out his plan by way of exchange, and to make his proposition\r\nunder the guise of a commercial enterprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Vincent,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is my idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, James?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is simply this; we will have a ship built of superior sailing\r\nqualities and great bulk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will load her with ammunition of war, provisions, and clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take the command of this steamer, I will defy all the ships of\r\nthe Federal marine for speed, and I will run the blockade of one of the\r\nsouthern ports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must make a good bargain for your cargo with the Confederates, who\r\nwill be in need of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said his uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I shall return laden with cotton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich they will give you for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, uncle. Will it answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will; but shall you be able to get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall, if I have a good ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne can be made on purpose. But the crew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I will find them. I do not want many men; enough to work with, that\r\nis all. It is not a question of fighting with the Federals, but\r\ndistancing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be distanced,\xe2\x80\x9d said uncle Vincent, in a peremptory tone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut now, tell me, James, to what port of the American coast do you\r\nthink of going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp to now, uncle, ships have run the blockade of New Orleans,\r\nWilmington, and Savannah, but I think of going straight to Charleston;\r\nno English boat has yet been able to penetrate into the harbour, except\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Bermuda.\xe2\x80\x99 I will do like her, and if my ship draws but very little\r\nwater, I shall be able to go where the Federalists will not be able to\r\nfollow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Vincent, \xe2\x80\x9cCharleston is overwhelmed with\r\ncotton; they are even burning it to get rid of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, the town is almost invested, Beauregard\r\nis running short of provisions, and he will pay me a golden price for my\r\ncargo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, nephew! and when will you start?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn six months; I must have the long winter nights to aid me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be as you wish, nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is settled, then, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSettled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall it be kept quiet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; better so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd this is how it was that five months later the steamer \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nlaunched from the Kelvin Dock timber-yards, and no one knew her real\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                         \xe2\x80\x9cGETTING UNDER SAIL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was rapidly equipped, her rigging was ready, and there was\r\nnothing to do but fit her up. She carried three schooner-masts, an\r\nalmost useless luxury; in fact, the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d did not rely on the wind\r\nto escape the Federalists, but rather on her powerful engines.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of December a trial of the steamer was made in the gulf\r\nof the Clyde. Which was the most satisfied, builder or captain, it is\r\nimpossible to say. The new steamer shot along wonderfully, and the\r\npatent log showed a speed of seventeen miles an hour, a speed which as\r\nyet no English, French, or American boat had ever obtained. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d would certainly have gained by several lengths in a sailing\r\nmatch with the fastest opponent.\r\n\r\nThe loading was begun on the 25th of December, the steamer having ranged\r\nalong the steamboat-quay a little below Glasgow Bridge, the last which\r\nstretches across the Clyde before its mouth. Here the wharfs were heaped\r\nwith a heavy cargo of clothes, ammunition, and provisions, which were\r\nrapidly carried to the hold of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d The nature of this cargo\r\nbetrayed the mysterious destination of the ship, and the house of\r\nPlayfair could no longer keep it secret; besides, the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d must not\r\nbe long before she started. No American cruiser had been signalled in\r\nEnglish waters; and, then, when the question of getting the crew came,\r\nhow was it possible to keep silent any longer? They could not embark\r\nthem even, without informing the men whither they were bound, for, after\r\nall, it was a matter of life and death, and when one risks one\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nat least it is satisfactory to know how and wherefore.\r\n\r\nHowever, this prospect hindered no one; the pay was good, and every one\r\nhad a share in the speculation, so that a great number of the finest\r\nsailors soon presented themselves. James Playfair was only embarrassed\r\nwhich to choose, but he chose well, and in twenty-four hours his\r\nmuster-roll bore the names of thirty sailors, who would have done honour\r\nto her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s yacht.\r\n\r\nThe departure was settled for the 3rd of January; on the 31st of\r\nDecember the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was ready, her hold full of ammunition and\r\nprovisions, and nothing was keeping her now.\r\n\r\nThe skipper went on board on the 2nd of January, and was giving a last\r\nlook round his ship with a Captain\xe2\x80\x99s eye, when a man presented himself\r\nat the fore part of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d and asked to speak with the Captain.\r\nOne of the sailors led him on to the poop.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong, hearty-looking fellow, with broad shoulders and ruddy\r\nface, the simple expression of which ill concealed a depth of wit and\r\nmirth. He did not seem to be accustomed to a seafaring life and looked\r\nabout him with the air of a man little used to being on board a ship;\r\nhowever, he assumed the manner of a Jack-tar, looking up at the rigging\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d and waddling in true sailor fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the Captain, he looked fixedly at him and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain James Playfair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the skipper. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo join your ship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no room; the crew is already complete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, one man, more or less, will not be in the way; quite the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, giving a sidelong glance at his\r\nquestioner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA rough sailor, with two strong arms, which, I can tell you, are not to\r\nbe despised on board a ship, and which I now have the honour of putting\r\nat your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are other ships besides the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin,\xe2\x80\x99 and other captains\r\nbesides James Playfair. Why do you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is on board the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 that I wish to serve, and under\r\nthe orders of Captain James Playfair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always need of a strong man, and if to prove my strength you\r\nwill try me with three or four of the strongest fellows of your crew, I\r\nam ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrockston, at your service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cTHE SAME,\xe2\x80\x9d REPLIED THE SKIPPER.]\r\n\r\nThe Captain made a few steps backwards in order to get a better view of\r\nthe giant, who presented himself in this odd fashion. The height, the\r\nbuild, and the look of the sailor did not deny his pretensions to\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you sailed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Playfair of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you know where the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 is bound for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and that is what tempts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! I have no mind to let a fellow of your stamp escape me. Go\r\nand find the first mate, and get him to enrol you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving said this the Captain expected to see the man turn on his heel\r\nand run to the bows, but he was mistaken. Crockston did not stir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! did you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it is not all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI have something else to\r\nask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! You are wasting my time,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James sharply; \xe2\x80\x9cI have not a\r\nmoment to lose in talking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not keep you long,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo words more and that\r\nis all; I was going to tell you that I have a nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a fine uncle, then,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! Hah!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you finished?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain, very impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is what I have to say, when one takes the uncle, the nephew\r\ncomes into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is the custom, the one does not go without the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is this nephew of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lad of fifteen whom I am going to train to the sea; he is willing to\r\nlearn, and will make a fine sailor some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, Master Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 is a training-school for cabin-boys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us speak ill of cabin-boys; there was one of them who became\r\nAdmiral Nelson, and another Admiral Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a way of\r\nspeaking which I like; bring your nephew, but if I don\xe2\x80\x99t find the uncle\r\nthe hearty fellow he pretends to be, he will have some business with me.\r\nGo, and be back in an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston did not want to be told twice; he bowed awkwardly to the\r\nCaptain of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d and went on to the quay. An hour afterwards he\r\ncame on board with his nephew, a boy of fourteen or fifteen, rather\r\ndelicate and weakly-looking, with a timid and astonished air, which\r\nshowed that he did not possess his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession and vigorous\r\ncorporeal qualities. Crockston was even obliged to encourage him by such\r\nwords as these:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened, they are not going to eat us,\r\nbesides there is yet time to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man, \xe2\x80\x9cand may God protect us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same day the sailor Crockston and his nephew were inscribed in the\r\nmuster-roll of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the fires of the steamer were well\r\nfed, the deck trembled under the vibrations of the boiler, and the steam\r\nrushed hissing through the escape-pipes. The hour of departure had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nA considerable crowd in spite of the early hour flocked on the quays and\r\non Glasgow Bridge, they had come to salute the bold steamer for the last\r\ntime. Vincent Playfair was there to say good-bye to Captain James, but\r\nhe conducted himself on this occasion like a Roman of the good old\r\ntimes. His was a heroic countenance, and the two loud kisses with which\r\nhe gratified his nephew were the indication of a strong mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, James,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the young Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cgo quickly, and come back\r\nquicker still; above all, don\xe2\x80\x99t abuse your position. Sell at a good\r\nprice, make a good bargain, and you will have your uncle\xe2\x80\x99s esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this recommendation, borrowed from the manual of the perfect\r\nmerchant, the uncle and nephew separated, and all the visitors left the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Crockston and John Stiggs stood together on the\r\nforecastle, while the former remarked to his nephew, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is well, this\r\nis well; before two o\xe2\x80\x99clock we shall be at sea, and I have a good\r\nopinion of a voyage which begins like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor reply the novice pressed Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair then gave the orders for departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we pressure on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of his mate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Mathew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, weigh anchor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was immediately done, and the screws began to move. The \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntrembled, passed between the ships in the port, and soon disappeared\r\nfrom the sight of the people, who shouted their last hurrahs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AND SOON DISAPPEARED.]\r\n\r\nThe descent of the Clyde was easily accomplished, one might almost say\r\nthat this river had been made by the hand of man, and even by the hand\r\nof a master. For sixty years, thanks to the dredges and constant\r\ndragging it has gained fifteen feet in depth, and its breadth has been\r\ntripled between the quays and the town. Soon the forests of masts and\r\nchimneys were lost in the smoke and fog; the noise of the foundry\r\nhammers, and the hatchets of the timber-yards grew fainter in the\r\ndistance. After the village of Patrick had been passed the factories\r\ngave way to country houses and villas. The \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d slackening her\r\nspeed, sailed between the dykes which carry the river above the shores,\r\nand often through very narrow channel, which, however, is only a small\r\ninconvenience for a navigable river, for, after all, depth is of more\r\nimportance than width. The steamer, guided by one of those excellent\r\npilots from the Irish sea, passed without hesitation between floating\r\nbuoys, stone columns, and _biggings_, surmounted with lighthouses, which\r\nmark the entrance to the channel. Beyond the town of Renfrew, at the\r\nfoot of Kilpatrick hills, the Clyde grew wider. Then came Bouling Bay,\r\nat the end of which opens the mouth of the canal which joins Edinburgh\r\nto Glasgow. Lastly, at the height of four hundred feet from the ground,\r\nwas seen the outline of Dumbarton Castle, almost indiscernible through\r\nthe mists, and soon the harbour-boats of Glasgow were rocked on the\r\nwaves which the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d caused. Some miles farther on Greenock, the\r\nbirthplace of James Watt, was passed: the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d now found herself at\r\nthe mouth of the Clyde, and at the entrance of the gulf by which it\r\nempties its waters into the Northern Ocean. Here the first undulations\r\nof the sea were felt, and the steamer ranged along the picturesque coast\r\nof the Isle of Arran. At last the promontory of Cantyre, which runs out\r\ninto the channel, was doubled; the Isle of Rattelin was hailed, the\r\npilot returned by a shore-boat to his cutter, which was cruising in the\r\nopen sea; the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d returning to her Captain\xe2\x80\x99s authority, took a\r\nless frequented route round the north of Ireland, and soon, having lost\r\nsight of the last European land, found herself in the open ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d had a good crew, not fighting men, or boarding sailors,\r\nbut good working men, and that was all she wanted. These brave,\r\ndetermined fellows were all, more or less, merchants; they sought a\r\nfortune rather than glory; they had no flag to display, no colours to\r\ndefend with cannon; in fact all the artillery on board consisted of two\r\nsmall swivel signal-guns.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d shot bravely across the water, and fulfilled the utmost\r\nexpectations of both builder and captain. Soon she passed the limit of\r\nBritish seas; there was not a ship in sight; the great Ocean route was\r\nfree; besides no ship of the Federal marine would have a right to attack\r\nher beneath the English flag. Followed she might be, and prevented from\r\nforcing the blockade, and precisely for this reason had James Playfair\r\nsacrificed everything to the speed of his ship, in order not to be\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nHowbeit a careful watch was kept on board, and in spite of the extreme\r\ncold a man was always in the rigging ready to signal the smallest sail\r\nthat appeared on the horizon. When evening came, Captain James gave the\r\nmost precise orders to Mr. Mathew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave the man on watch too long in the rigging, the cold may\r\nseize him, and in that case it is impossible to keep a good look-out;\r\nchange your men often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Mathew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry Crockston for that work; the fellow pretends to have excellent\r\nsight; it must be put to trial; put him on the morning watch, he will\r\nhave the morning mists to see through. If anything particular happens\r\ncall me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis said, James Playfair went to his cabin. Mr. Mathew called\r\nCrockston, and told him the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to relieve watch of the\r\nmain-masthead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor reply, Crockston gave a decided grunt, but Mr. Mathew had hardly\r\nturned his back when the sailor muttered some incomprehensible words,\r\nand then cried,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth did he say about the main-mast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment his nephew, John Stiggs, joined him on the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the seaman, with a forced smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is only one thing, this wretched boat shakes herself like a dog\r\ncoming out of the water, and it makes my head confused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Crockston, and it is for my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you and him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not a word about that, John;\r\ntrust in God, and He will not forsake you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, John Stiggs and Crockston went to the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s berth, but the\r\nsailor did not lie down before he had seen the young novice comfortably\r\nsettled in the narrow cabin which he had got for him.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, Crockston got up to go to\r\nhis place; he went on deck, where the first officer ordered him to go up\r\ninto the rigging, and keep good watch.\r\n\r\nAt these words the sailor seemed undecided what to do; then making up\r\nhis mind, he went towards the bows of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where are you off to now?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Mathew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere you sent me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you to go to the main-mast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am going there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, in an unconcerned tone,\r\ncontinuing his way to the poop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Mathew, impatiently; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are looking for\r\nthe bars of the main on the fore-mast. You are like a cockney, who\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to twist a cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails, or make a splice. On\r\nboard what ship can you have been, man? The main-mast, stupid, the\r\nmain-mast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sailors who had run up to hear what was going on, burst out\r\nlaughing, when they saw Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s disconcerted look, as he went back\r\nto the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking up the mast, the top of which was quite invisible\r\nthrough the morning mists; \xe2\x80\x9cso, am I to climb up here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Mathew, \xe2\x80\x9cand hurry yourself! By St. Patrick a Federal\r\nship would have time to get her bowsprit fast in our rigging before that\r\nlazy fellow could get to his post. Will you go up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Crockston got on the bulwarks with some difficulty; then\r\nhe began to climb the rigging with most visible awkwardness, like a man\r\nwho did not know how to make use of his hands or feet. When he had\r\nreached the top-gallant, instead of springing lightly on to it, he\r\nremained motionless, clinging to the ropes, as if he had been seized\r\nwith giddiness. Mr. Mathew, irritated by his stupidity ordered him to\r\ncome down immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow there,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the boatswain, \xe2\x80\x9chas never been a sailor\r\nin his life. Johnston, just go and see what he has in his bundle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boatswain made haste to the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s berth.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Crockston was with difficulty coming down again, but his\r\nfoot having slipped, he slid down the rope he had hold of, and fell\r\nheavily on the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClumsy blockhead! land-lubber!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Mathew, by way of\r\nconsolation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you come to do on board the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99! Ah! you\r\nentered as an able seaman, and you cannot even distinguish the main from\r\nthe fore-mast! I shall have a little talk with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston made no attempt to speak; he bent his back like a man resigned\r\nfor anything he might have to bear; just then the boatswain returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to the first officer, \xe2\x80\x9cis all that I have found; a\r\nsuspicious portfolio with letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mathew. \xe2\x80\x9cLetters with Federal stamps! Mr.\r\nHalliburtt, of Boston! An abolitionist! a Federalist! Wretch! you are\r\nnothing but a traitor, and have sneaked on board to betray us! Never\r\nmind, you will be paid for your trouble with the cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails!\r\nBoatswain, call the Captain, and you others, just keep an eye on that\r\nrogue there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston received these compliments with a hideous grimace, but he did\r\nnot open his lips. They had fastened him to the capstan, and he could\r\nmove neither hand nor foot.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later James Playfair came out of his cabin and went to the\r\nforecastle, where Mr. Mathew immediately acquainted him with the details\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked James Playfair, scarcely able to restrain\r\nhis anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you come on board my ship for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you expect from me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you? An American, as these letters seem to prove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoatswain,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cfifty lashes with the\r\ncat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails to loosen his tongue. Will that be enough, Crockston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will remain to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied John Stiggs\xe2\x80\x99 uncle without moving a\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, come along, men,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boatswain.\r\n\r\nAt this order, two strong sailors stripped Crockston of his woollen\r\njersey; they had already seized the formidable weapon, and laid it\r\nacross the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, when the novice, John Stiggs, pale and\r\nagitated, hurried on deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the nephew!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the novice, with a violent effort to steady his\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what Crockston does not want to say. I will hide\r\nit no longer; yes, he is American, and so am I; we are both enemies of\r\nthe slave-holders, but not traitors come on board to betray the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 into the hands of the Federalists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you come to do, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain, in a severe tone,\r\nexamining the novice attentively. The latter hesitated a few seconds\r\nbefore replying, then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, I should like to speak to you\r\nin private.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cCAPTAIN!\xe2\x80\x9d EXCLAIMED HE.]\r\n\r\nWhilst John Stiggs made this request, James Playfair did not cease to\r\nlook carefully at him; the sweet young face of the novice, his\r\npeculiarly gentle voice, the delicacy and whiteness of his hands, hardly\r\ndisguised by paint, the large eyes, the animation of which could not\r\nhide their tenderness\xe2\x80\x94all this together gave rise to a certain suspicion\r\nin the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s mind. When John Stiggs had made his request, Playfair\r\nglanced fixedly at Crockston, who shrugged his shoulders; then he\r\nfastened a questioning look on the novice, which the latter could not\r\nwithstand, and said simply to him, \xe2\x80\x9cCome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Stiggs followed the Captain on to the poop, and then James\r\nPlayfair, opening the door of his cabin, said to the novice, whose\r\ncheeks were pale with emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cBe so kind as to walk in, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn, thus addressed, blushed violently, and two tears rolled\r\ninvoluntarily down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, in a gentle voice, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nbe so good as to tell me how I come to have the honour of having you on\r\nboard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl hesitated a moment, then reassured by the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s look,\r\nshe made up her mind to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to join my father at Charleston; the town is\r\nbesieged by land and blockaded by sea. I knew not how to get there, when\r\nI heard that the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 meant to force the blockade. I came on board\r\nyour ship, and I beg you to forgive me if I acted without your consent,\r\nwhich you would have refused me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did well, then, not to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the young girl, with a\r\nfirmer voice.\r\n\r\nThe Captain crossed his arms, walked round his cabin, and then came\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJenny Halliburtt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father, if I remember rightly the address on the letters, is he\r\nnot from Boston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a Northerner is thus in a southern town in the thickest of the\r\nwar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father is a prisoner; he was at Charleston when the first shot of\r\nthe Civil War was fired, and the troops of the Union driven from Fort\r\nSumter by the Confederates. My father\xe2\x80\x99s opinions exposed him to the\r\nhatred of the Slavist part, and by the order of General Beauregard he\r\nwas imprisoned. I was then in England, living with a relation who has\r\njust died, and left alone with no help but that of Crockston, our\r\nfaithful servant, I wished to go to my father and share his prison with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was Mr. Halliburtt, then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA loyal and brave journalist,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jenny proudly, one of the\r\nnoblest editors of the \xe2\x80\x9cTribune,\xe2\x80\x9d and the one who was the boldest in\r\ndefending the cause of the negroes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn abolitionist,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain angrily; \xe2\x80\x9cone of those men, who,\r\nunder the vain pretence of abolishing slavery, have deluged their\r\ncountry with blood and ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jenny Halliburtt, growing pale, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are insulting my\r\nfather; you must not forget that I stand alone to defend him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Captain blushed scarlet; anger mingled with shame struggled in\r\nhis breast; perhaps he would have answered the young girl, but he\r\nsucceeded in restraining himself, and opening the door of the cabin, he\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cBoatswain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boatswain came to him directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis cabin will henceforward belong to Miss Jenny Halliburtt; have a\r\ncot made ready for me at the end of the poop; that\xe2\x80\x99s all I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boatswain looked with a stupefied stare at the young novice\r\naddressed in a feminine name, but on a sign from James Playfair he went\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, miss, you are at home,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young Captain of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he retired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                           CROCKSTON\xe2\x80\x99s TRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the whole crew knew Miss Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s story,\r\nwhich Crockston was no longer hindered from telling. By the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norders he was released from the capstan, and the cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails\r\nreturned to its place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty animal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially when it shows its velvety\r\npaws.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was free, he went down to the sailors\xe2\x80\x99 berths, found a\r\nsmall portmanteau, and carried it to Miss Jenny; the young girl was now\r\nable to resume her feminine attire, but she remained in her cabin, and\r\ndid not again appear on deck.\r\n\r\nAs for Crockston, it was well and duly agreed that, as he was no more a\r\nsailor than a horse-guard, he should be exempt from all duty on board.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d with her twin screws cutting the waves,\r\nsped rapidly across the Atlantic, and there was nothing now to do but\r\nkeep a strict look out. The day following the discovery of Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidentity, James Playfair paced the deck at the poop with a rapid step;\r\nhe had made no attempt to see the young girl and resume the conversation\r\nof the day before.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was walking to and fro, Crockston passed him several times,\r\nlooking at him askant with a satisfied grin; he evidently wanted to\r\nspeak to the Captain, and at last his persistent manner attracted the\r\nattention of the latter, who said to him, somewhat impatiently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now, what do you want? You are turning round me like a swimmer\r\nround a buoy: when are you going to leave off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Crockston, winking, \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to speak to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is nothing very much, I only wanted to tell you frankly that you\r\nare a good fellow at bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy at bottom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt bottom and surface also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want your compliments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not complimenting you, I shall wait to do that when you have gone\r\nto the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what end?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the end of your task.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I have a task to fulfil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, you have taken the young girl and myself on board; good. You\r\nhave given up your cabin to Miss Halliburtt; good. You released me from\r\nthe cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails; nothing could be better. You are going to take us\r\nstraight to Charleston; that\xe2\x80\x99s delightful, but it is not all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow not all?\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, amazed at Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s boldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, certainly not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, with a knowing look, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nfather is prisoner there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the father must be rescued.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRescue Miss Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly, and it is worth risking something for such a noble man\r\nand courageous citizen as he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, frowning, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the\r\nhumour for your jokes, so have a care what you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou misunderstand me, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the American. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not joking in\r\nthe least, but speaking quite seriously. What I have proposed may at\r\nfirst seem very absurd to you; when you have thought it over you will\r\nsee that you cannot do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, do you mean that I must deliver Mr. Halliburtt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, you can demand his release of General Beauregard, who will not\r\nrefuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he does refuse me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston, in a deliberate tone, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must use\r\nstronger measures, and carry off the prisoner by force.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, who was beginning to get angry, \xe2\x80\x9cso, not\r\ncontent with passing through the Federal fleets and forcing the blockade\r\nof Charleston, I must run out to sea again from under the cannon of the\r\nforts, and this to deliver a gentleman I know nothing of, one of those\r\nAbolitionists whom I detest, one of those journalists who shed ink\r\ninstead of their blood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is but a cannon-shot more or less!\xe2\x80\x9d added Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cmind what I say; if ever you\r\nmention this affair again to me, I will send you to the hold for the\r\nrest of the passage, to teach you manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus saying the Captain dismissed the American, who went off murmuring,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, I am not altogether displeased with this conversation: at any\r\nrate, the affair is broached; it will do, it will do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair had hardly meant it when he said an Abolitionist whom I\r\ndetest; he did not in the least side with the Federals, but he did not\r\nwish to admit that the question of slavery was the predominant reason\r\nfor the civil war of the United States, in spite of President Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nformal declaration. Did he then think that the Southern States, eight\r\nout of thirty-six, were right in separating when they had been\r\nvoluntarily united? Not so; he detested the Northerners, and that was\r\nall; he detested them as brothers separated from the common family\xe2\x80\x94true\r\nEnglishmen\xe2\x80\x94who had thought it right to do what he, James Playfair,\r\ndisapproved of with regard to the United States: these were the\r\npolitical opinions of the Captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d But more than this,\r\nthe American war interfered with him personally, and he had a grudge\r\nagainst those who had caused this war; one can understand, then, how he\r\nwould receive a proposition to deliver an Abolitionist, thus bringing\r\ndown on him the Confederates, with whom he pretended to do business.\r\n\r\nHowever, Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s insinuation did not fail to disturb him, he cast\r\nthe thought from him, but it returned unceasingly to his mind, and when\r\nMiss Jenny came on deck the next day for a few minutes, he dared not\r\nlook her in the face.\r\n\r\nAnd really it was a great pity, for this young girl with the fair hair\r\nand sweet, intelligent face deserved to be looked at by a young man of\r\nthirty. But James felt embarrassed in her presence; he felt that this\r\ncharming creature who had been educated in the school of misfortune\r\npossessed a strong and generous soul; he understood that his silence\r\ntowards her inferred a refusal to acquiesce in her dearest wishes;\r\nbesides, Miss Jenny never looked out for James Playfair, neither did she\r\navoid him. Thus for the first few days they spoke little or not at all\r\nto each other. Miss Halliburtt scarcely ever left her cabin, and it is\r\ncertain she would never have addressed herself to the Captain of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d if it had not been for Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, which brought\r\nboth parties together.\r\n\r\nThe worthy American was a faithful servant of the Halliburtt family, he\r\nhad been brought up in his master\xe2\x80\x99s house and his devotion knew no\r\nbounds. His good sense equalled his courage and energy, and, as has been\r\nseen, he had a way of looking things straight in the face. He was very\r\nseldom discouraged, and could generally find a way out of the most\r\nintricate dangers with a wonderful skill.\r\n\r\nThis honest fellow had taken it into his head to deliver Mr. Halliburtt,\r\nto employ the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s ship, and the Captain himself for this purpose,\r\nand to return with him to England. Such was his intention, so long as\r\nthe young girl had no other object than to rejoin her father and share\r\nhis captivity. It was this Crockston tried to make the Captain\r\nunderstand, as we have seen, but the enemy had not yet surrendered, on\r\nthe contrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit is absolutely necessary that Miss Jenny and the\r\nCaptain come to an understanding; if they are going to be sulky like\r\nthis all the passage we shall get nothing done: they must speak,\r\ndiscuss; let them dispute even, so long as they talk, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged\r\nif during their conversation James Playfair does not propose himself\r\nwhat he refused me to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut when Crockston saw that the young girl and the young man avoided\r\neach other, he began to be perplexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must look sharp,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to himself, and the morning of the fourth\r\nday he entered Miss Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s cabin, rubbing his hands with an air of\r\nperfect satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cgood news! You will never guess what the Captain\r\nhas proposed to me. A very noble young man he is. Now try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jenny, whose heart beat violently, \xe2\x80\x9chas he proposed to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo deliver Mr. Halliburtt, to carry him off from the Confederates, and\r\nbring him to England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jenny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, as I say, miss. What a good-hearted man this James Playfair is!\r\nThese English are either all good or all bad. Ah! he may reckon on my\r\ngratitude, and I am ready to cut myself in pieces if it would please\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJenny\xe2\x80\x99s joy was profound on hearing Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s words. Deliver her\r\nfather! she had never dared to think of such a plan, and the Captain of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was going to risk his ship and crew!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what he is,\xe2\x80\x9d added Crockston; \xe2\x80\x9cand this, Miss Jenny, is well\r\nworth an acknowledgment from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than an acknowledgment,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young girl; \xe2\x80\x9ca lasting\r\nfriendship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd immediately she left the cabin to find James Playfair, and express\r\nto him the sentiments which flowed from her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting on by degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered the American.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair was pacing to and fro on the poop, and, as may be\r\nthought, he was very much surprised, not to say amazed, to see the young\r\ngirl go up to him, her eyes moist with grateful tears, and holding out\r\nher hand to him saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir, thank you for your kindness, which I should never have\r\ndared to expect from a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, as if he understood nothing of what she was\r\ntalking, and could not understand, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, sir, you are going to brave many dangers, perhaps\r\ncompromise your interests for me, and you have done so much already in\r\noffering me on board an hospitality to which I have no right whatever\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me, Miss Jenny,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I protest\r\nagain I do not understand your words; I have acted towards you as any\r\nwell-bred man would towards a lady, and my conduct deserves neither so\r\nmany thanks nor so much gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Playfair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jenny, \xe2\x80\x9cit is useless to pretend any longer;\r\nCrockston has told me all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cCrockston has told you all, then I understand\r\nless than ever the reason for your leaving your cabin, and saying these\r\nwords which\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cTHANK YOU, SIR, THANK YOU.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking the Captain felt very much embarrassed; he remembered\r\nthe rough way in which he had received the American\xe2\x80\x99s overtures, but\r\nJenny, fortunately for him, did not give him time for further\r\nexplanation; she interrupted him, holding out her hand and saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. James, I had no other object in coming on board your ship except to\r\ngo to Charleston, and there, however cruel the slave-holders may be,\r\nthey will not refuse to let a poor girl share her father\xe2\x80\x99s prison, that\r\nwas all; I had never thought of a return as possible; but since you are\r\nso generous as to wish for my father\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance, since you will\r\nattempt everything to save him, be assured you have my deepest\r\ngratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames did not know what to do or what part to assume; he bit his lip; he\r\ndared not take the hand offered him; he saw perfectly that Crockston had\r\ncompromised him, so that escape was impossible; at the same time he had\r\nno thoughts of delivering Mr. Halliburtt, and getting complicated in a\r\ndisagreeable business: but how dash to the ground the hope which had\r\narisen in this poor girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart? How refuse the hand which she held out\r\nto him with a feeling of such profound friendship? How change to tears\r\nof grief the tears of gratitude which filled her eyes?\r\n\r\nSo the young man tried to reply evasively, in a manner which would\r\ninsure his liberty of action for the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jenny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9crest assured I will do everything in my power\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he took the little hand in both of his, but with the gentle pressure\r\nhe felt his heart melt and his head grow confused: words to express his\r\nthoughts failed him. He stammered out some incoherent words,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss\xe2\x80\x94Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x94for you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston, who was watching him, rubbed his hands, grinning and\r\nrepeating to himself,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will come! it will come! it has come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow James Playfair would have managed to extricate himself from his\r\nembarrassing position no one knows, but fortunately for him, if not for\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d the man on watch was heard crying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhoy, officer of the watch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Mathew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sail to windward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair, leaving the young girl, immediately sprang to the\r\nshrouds of the main-mast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n       THE SHOT FROM THE \xe2\x80\x9cIROQUOIS,\xe2\x80\x9d AND MISS JENNY\xe2\x80\x99s ARGUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil now the navigation of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d had been very fortunate. Not\r\none ship had been signalled before the sail hailed by the man on watch.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was then in 32\xc2\xb0 51\xc2\xb4 latitude and 57\xc2\xb0 43\xc2\xb4west longitude.\r\nFor forty-eight hours a fog which now began to rise had covered the\r\nocean. If this mist favoured the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d by hiding her course, it also\r\nprevented any observations at a distance being made, and, without being\r\naware of it, she might be sailing side by side, so to speak, with the\r\nships she wished most to avoid.\r\n\r\nNow this is just what had happened, and when the ship was signalled she\r\nwas only three miles to windward.\r\n\r\nWhen James Playfair had reached the bars, he saw distinctly, through an\r\nopening in the mist, a large Federal corvette in full pursuit of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE SAW DISTINCTLY.]\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully examined her, the Captain came down on deck\r\nagain, and called to the first officer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathew,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of this ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Captain, that it is a Federal cruiser, which suspects our\r\nintentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no possible doubt of her nationality,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this moment the starry flag of the North United States appeared on\r\nthe gaff-yards of the corvette, and the latter asserted her colours with\r\na cannon-shot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn invitation to show ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mathew. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us show them;\r\nthere is nothing to be ashamed of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good?\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair. \xe2\x80\x9cOur flag will hardly protect\r\nus, and it will not hinder those people from paying us a visit? No; let\r\nus go ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd go quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Mathew, \xe2\x80\x9cfor if my eyes do not deceive me,\r\nI have already seen that corvette lying off Liverpool, where she went to\r\nwatch the ships in building: my name is not Mathew, if that is not \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nIroquois\xe2\x80\x99 on her taffrail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is she fast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the fastest vessels of the Federal marine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat guns does she carry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t shrug your shoulders, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mathew, in a serious\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x9ctwo out of those eight guns are rifled, one is a sixty-pounder on\r\nthe forecastle, and the other a hundred-pounder on deck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are Parrott\xe2\x80\x99s, and will\r\ncarry three miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and farther than that, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! Mr. Mathew, let their guns be sixty or only four-pounders,\r\nand let them carry three miles or five hundred yards, it is all the same\r\nif we can go fast enough to avoid their shot. We will show this\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Iroquois\xe2\x80\x99 how a ship can go when she is built on purpose to go. Have\r\nthe fires well banked up, Mr. Mathew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first officer gave the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders to the engineer, and soon\r\nvolumes of black smoke curled from the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s chimneys.\r\n\r\nThis proceeding did not seem to please the corvette, for she made the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d the signal to lie to, but James Playfair paid no attention to\r\nthis warning, and did not change his ship\xe2\x80\x99s course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see what the \xe2\x80\x98Iroquois\xe2\x80\x99 will do; there is a\r\nfine opportunity for her to try her guns, go ahead full speed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mathew; \xe2\x80\x9cshe will not be long in saluting us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReturning to the poop, the Captain saw Miss Halliburtt sitting quietly\r\nnear the bulwarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jenny,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall probably be chased by that corvette you\r\nsee to windward, and as she will speak to us with shot, I beg to offer\r\nyou my arm to take you to your cabin again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, very much, Mr. Playfair,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young girl, looking at\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am not afraid of cannon-shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, miss, in spite of the distance, there may be some danger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was not brought up to be fearful; they accustom us to everything\r\nin America, and I assure you that the shot from the \xe2\x80\x98Iroquois\xe2\x80\x99 will not\r\nmake me lower my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are brave, Miss Jenny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us admit, then, that I am brave, and allow me to stay by you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can refuse you nothing, Miss Halliburtt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain,\r\nlooking at the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s calm face.\r\n\r\nThese words were hardly uttered when they saw a line of white smoke\r\nissue from the bulwarks of the corvette; before the report had reached\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d a projectile whizzed through the air in the direction of\r\nthe steamer.\r\n\r\nAt about twenty fathoms from the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d the shot, the speed of which\r\nhad sensibly lessened, skimmed over the surface of the waves, marking\r\nits passage by a series of water-jets; then, with another burst, it\r\nrebounded to a certain height, passed over the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d grazing the\r\nmizen-yards on the starboard side, fell at thirty fathoms beyond, and\r\nwas buried in the waves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get along; another slap\r\nlike that is not to be waited for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Mathew, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will take some time to reload such\r\npieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, it is an interesting sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Crockston, who, with\r\narms crossed, stood perfectly at his ease looking at the scene, \xe2\x80\x9cand to\r\nsay they are friends who send such brandy-balls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that\xe2\x80\x99s you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, scanning the American from head\r\nto foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is me, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American, undisturbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to\r\nsee how these brave Federals fire; not badly, in truth, not badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Captain was going to answer Crockston sharply, but at this moment a\r\nsecond shot struck the sea on the starboard side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have already gained two cables on this\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Iroquois.\xe2\x80\x99 Your friends sail like a buoy; do you hear, Master\r\nCrockston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not say they don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American, \xe2\x80\x9cand for the first\r\ntime in my life it does not fail to please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA third shot fell still farther astern, and in less than ten minutes the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was out of range of the corvette\xe2\x80\x99s guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for patent-logs, Mr. Mathew,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cthanks to\r\nthose shot we know how to rate our speed. Now have the fires lowered; it\r\nis not worth while to waste our coal uselessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good ship that you command,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Halliburtt to the young\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Jenny, my good \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin,\xe2\x80\x99 makes her seventeen knots, and\r\nbefore the day is over, we shall have lost sight of that corvette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair did not exaggerate the sailing qualities of his ship, and\r\nthe sun had not set before the masts of the American ship had\r\ndisappeared below the horizon.\r\n\r\nThis incident allowed the Captain to see Miss Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s character in\r\na new light; besides, the ice was broken, henceforward, during the whole\r\nof the voyage, the interviews between the Captain and his passenger were\r\nfrequent and prolonged; he found her to be a young girl, calm, strong,\r\nthoughtful, and intelligent, speaking with great ease, having her own\r\nideas about everything, and expressing her thoughts with a conviction\r\nwhich unconsciously penetrated James Playfair\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nShe loved her country, she was zealous in the great cause of the Union,\r\nand expressed herself on the civil war in the United States with an\r\nenthusiasm of which no other woman would have been capable. Thus it\r\nhappened, more than once, that James Playfair found it difficult to\r\nanswer her, even when questions purely mercantile arose in connexion\r\nwith the war: Miss Jenny attacked them none the less vigorously, and\r\nwould come to no other terms whatever. At first James argued a great\r\ndeal, and tried to uphold the Confederates against the Federals, to\r\nprove that the Secessionists were in the right, and that if the people\r\nwere united voluntarily they might separate in the same manner. But the\r\nyoung girl would not yield on this point; she demonstrated that the\r\nquestion of slavery was predominant in the struggle between the North\r\nand South Americans, that it was far more a war in the cause of morals\r\nand humanity than politics, and James could make no answer. Besides,\r\nduring these discussions, which he listened to attentively, it is\r\ndifficult to say whether he was more touched by Miss Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narguments, or the charming manner in which she spoke; but at last he was\r\nobliged to acknowledge, among other things, that slavery was the\r\nprincipal feature in the war, that it must be put an end to decisively,\r\nand the last horrors of barbarous times abolished.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the political opinions of the Captain did not\r\ntrouble him much. He would have sacrificed his most serious opinion\r\nbefore such enticing arguments and under like circumstances; he made a\r\ngood bargain of his ideas for the same reason, but at last he was\r\nattacked in his tenderest point: this was the question of the traffic in\r\nwhich the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was being employed, and, consequently, the\r\nammunition which was being carried to the Confederates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. James,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Halliburtt, \xe2\x80\x9cgratitude does not hinder me\r\nfrom speaking with perfect frankness; on the contrary, you are a brave\r\nseaman, a clever merchant, the house of Playfair is noted for its\r\nrespectability; but in this case it fails in its principles, and follows\r\na trade unworthy of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house of Playfair ought not to attempt such a\r\ncommercial enterprise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! it is taking ammunition to the unhappy creatures in revolt against\r\nthe government of their country, and it is lending arms to a bad cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my honour, Miss Jenny, I will not discuss the fight of the\r\nConfederates with you; I will only answer you with one word: I am a\r\nmerchant, and as such I only occupy myself with the interests of my\r\nhouse; I look for gain wherever there is an opportunity of getting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is precisely what is to be blamed, Mr. James,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\ngirl; \xe2\x80\x9cprofit does not excuse it; thus, when you supply arms to the\r\nSoutherners, with which to continue a criminal war, you are quite as\r\nguilty as when you sell opium to the Chinese, which stupefies them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! for once, Miss Jenny, this is too much, and I cannot admit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; what I say is just, and when you consider it, when you understand\r\nthe part you are playing, when you think of the results for which you\r\nare responsible, you will yield to me in this point, as in so many\r\nothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair was dumbfoundered at these words; he left the young girl,\r\na prey to angry thoughts, for he felt his powerlessness to answer; then\r\nhe sulked like a child for half an hour, and an hour later he returned\r\nto the singular young girl who could overwhelm him with convincing\r\narguments, with quite a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\nIn short, however it may have come about, and although he would not\r\nacknowledge it to himself, Captain James Playfair belonged to himself no\r\nlonger, he was no longer commander-in-chief on board his own ship.\r\n\r\nThus, to Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s great joy, Mr. Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s affairs appeared to be\r\nin a good way; the Captain seemed to have decided to undertake\r\neverything in his power to deliver Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s father, and for this he\r\nwould be obliged to compromise the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d his cargo, his crew, and\r\nincur the displeasure of his worthy uncle Vincent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                        SULLIVAN ISLAND CHANNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after the meeting with the \xe2\x80\x9cIroquois,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d found\r\nherself abreast of the Bermudas, where she was assailed by a violent\r\nsquall. These isles are frequently visited by hurricanes, and are\r\ncelebrated for shipwrecks. It is here that Shakspeare has placed the\r\nexciting scene of his drama, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tempest,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Ariel and Caliban\r\ndispute for the empire of the floods.\r\n\r\nThe squall was frightful; James Playfair thought once of running for one\r\nof the Bermudas, where the English had a military post: it would have\r\nbeen a sad waste of time, and therefore especially to be regretted;\r\nhappily the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d behaved herself wonderfully well in the storm, and\r\nafter flying a whole day before the tempest, she was able to resume her\r\ncourse towards the American coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SQUALL.]\r\n\r\nBut if James Playfair had been pleased with his ship, he had not been\r\nless delighted with the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s bravery; Miss Halliburtt had passed\r\nthe worst hours of the storm at his side, and James knew that a\r\nprofound, imperious, irresistible love had taken possession of his whole\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthis brave girl is mistress on board; she turns me like\r\nthe sea a ship in distress\xe2\x80\x94I feel that I am foundering! What will Uncle\r\nVincent say? Ah! poor nature, I am sure that if Jenny asked me to throw\r\nall this cursed cargo into the sea, I should do it without hesitating,\r\nfor love of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHappily for the firm of Playfair and Co., Miss Halliburtt did not demand\r\nthis sacrifice; nevertheless, the poor Captain had been taken captive,\r\nand Crockston, who read his heart like an open book, rubbed his hands\r\ngleefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will hold him fast!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand before a week has\r\npassed my master will be quietly installed in one of the best cabins of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs for Miss Jenny, did she perceive the feelings which she inspired? did\r\nshe allow herself to share them? No one could say, and James Playfair\r\nleast of all; the young girl kept a perfect reserve, and her secret\r\nremained deeply buried in her heart.\r\n\r\nBut whilst love was making such progress in the heart of the young\r\nCaptain, the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d sped with no less rapidity towards Charleston.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of January, the watch signalled land ten miles to the west.\r\nIt was a low-lying coast, and almost blended with the line of the sea in\r\nthe distance. Crockston was examining the horizon attentively, and about\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he cried,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharleston lighthouse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROCKSTON WAS EXAMINING THE HORIZON ATTENTIVELY.]\r\n\r\nNow that the bearings of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d were set, James Playfair had but\r\none thing to do, to decide by which channel he would run into Charleston\r\nBay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we meet with no obstacles,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore three o\xe2\x80\x99clock we shall\r\nbe in safety in the docks of the port.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe town of Charleston is situated on the banks of an estuary seven\r\nmiles long and two broad, called Charleston Harbour, the entrance to\r\nwhich is rather difficult. It is enclosed between Morris Island on the\r\nsouth, and Sullivan Island on the north. At the time when the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nattempted to force the blockade Morris Island already belonged to the\r\nFederal troops, and General Gillmore had caused batteries to be erected\r\noverlooking the harbour. Sullivan Island, on the contrary, was in the\r\nhands of the Confederates, who were also in possession of Moultrie Fort,\r\nsituated at the extremity of the island; therefore it would be\r\nadvantageous to the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d to go as close as possible to the northern\r\nshores to avoid the firing from the forts on Morris Island.\r\n\r\nFive channels led into the estuary, Sullivan Island Channel, the\r\nNorthern Channel, the Overall Channel, the Principal Channel, and\r\nlastly, the Lawford Channel; but it was useless for strangers, unless\r\nthey had skilful pilots on board, or ships drawing less than seven feet\r\nof water to attempt this last; as for Northern and Overall Channels,\r\nthey were in range of the Federalist batteries, so that it was no good\r\nthinking of them. If James Playfair could have had his choice, he would\r\nhave taken his steamer through the Principal Channel, which was the\r\nbest, and the bearings of which were easy to follow; but it was\r\nnecessary to yield to circumstances, and to decide according to the\r\nevent. Besides, the Captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d knew perfectly all the\r\nsecrets of this bay, its dangers, the depths of its water at low tide,\r\nand its currents, so that he was able to steer his ship with the\r\ngreatest safety as soon as he entered one of these narrow straits. The\r\ngreat question was to get there.\r\n\r\nNow this work demanded an experienced seaman, and one who knew exactly\r\nthe qualities of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact two Federal frigates were now cruising in the Charleston waters.\r\nMr. Mathew soon drew James Playfair\xe2\x80\x99s attention to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are preparing to ask us what we want on these shores,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well! we won\xe2\x80\x99t answer them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain, \xe2\x80\x9cand they will\r\nnot get their curiosity satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the cruisers were coming on full steam towards the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d who continued her course, taking care to keep out of range of\r\ntheir guns. But in order to gain time James Playfair made for the\r\nsouth-west, wishing to put the enemies\xe2\x80\x99 ships off their guard; the\r\nlatter must have thought that the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d intended to make for Morris\r\nIsland Channel. Now there they had batteries and guns, a single shot\r\nfrom which would have been enough to sink the English ship; so the\r\nFederals allowed the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d to run towards the south-west, contenting\r\nthemselves by observing her without following closely.\r\n\r\nThus for an hour the respective situations of the ships did not change,\r\nfor James Playfair, wishing to deceive the cruisers as to the course of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d had caused the fires to be moderated, so that the speed\r\nwas decreased. However, from the thick volumes of smoke which escaped\r\nfrom the chimneys, it might have been thought that he was trying to get\r\nhis maximum pressure, and, consequently, his maximum of rapidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will be slightly astonished presently,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthey see us slip through their fingers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, when the Captain saw that he was near enough to Morris Island,\r\nand before a line of guns, the range of which he did not know, he turned\r\nhis rudder quickly, and the ship resumed her northerly course, leaving\r\nthe cruisers two miles to windward of her; the latter seeing this\r\nman\xc5\x93uvre understood the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s object, and began to pursue her in\r\nearnest, but it was too late. The \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d doubled her speed under the\r\naction of the screws, and distanced them rapidly. Going nearer to the\r\ncoast, a few shell were sent after her as an acquittal of conscience,\r\nbut the Federals were outdone, for their projectiles did not reach half\r\nway. At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the steamer ranging near Sullivan\r\nIsland, thanks to her small draft, entered the narrow strait full steam;\r\nthere she was in safety, for no Federalist cruiser dared follow her in\r\nthis channel, the depth of which, on an average, was only eleven feet at\r\nlow tide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9cand is that the only difficulty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! Master Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulty is not\r\nin entering, but in getting out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American, \xe2\x80\x9cthat does not make me at all uneasy;\r\nwith a boat like the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 and a Captain like Mr. James Playfair,\r\none can go where one likes, and come out in the same manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, James Playfair, with telescope in his hand, was\r\nattentively examining the route to be followed. He had before him\r\nexcellent coasting guides, with which he could go ahead without any\r\ndifficulty or hesitation.\r\n\r\nOnce his ship was safely in the narrow channel which runs the length of\r\nSullivan Island, James steered bearing towards the middle of Fort\r\nMoultrie as far as the Pinckney Castle, situated on the isolated island\r\nof Shute\xe2\x80\x99s Folly; on the other side rose Fort Johnson, a little way to\r\nthe north of Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the steamer was saluted by some shot which did not reach\r\nher, from the batteries on Morris Island. She continued her course\r\nwithout any deviation, passed before Moultrieville, situated at the\r\nextremity of Sullivan Island, and entered the bay.\r\n\r\nSoon Fort Sumter on the left protected her from the batteries of the\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nThis fort, so celebrated in the civil war, is situated three miles and a\r\nhalf from Charleston, and about a mile from each side of the bay: it is\r\nnearly pentagonal in form, built on an artificial island of\r\nMassachusetts granite, it took ten years to construct and cost more than\r\n900,000 dollars.\r\n\r\nIt was from this fort, on the 13th of April, 1861, that Anderson and the\r\nFederal troops were driven, and it was against it that the first shot of\r\nthe Confederates was fired. It is impossible to estimate the quantity of\r\niron and lead which the Federals showered down upon it. However, it\r\nresisted for almost three years, but a few months after the passage of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d it fell beneath General Gillmore\xe2\x80\x99s three hundred-pounders\r\non Morris Island.\r\n\r\nBut at this time it was in all its strength, and the Confederate flag\r\nfloated proudly above it.\r\n\r\nOnce past the fort the town of Charleston appeared lying between Ashley\r\nand Cooper rivers.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair threaded his way through the buoys which mark the\r\nentrance of the channel, leaving behind the Charleston lighthouse\r\nvisible above Morris Island. He had hoisted the English flag, and made\r\nhis way with wonderful rapidity through the narrow channels. When he had\r\npassed the Quarantine buoy, he advanced freely into the centre of the\r\nbay. Miss Halliburtt was standing on the poop, looking at the town where\r\nher father was kept prisoner, and her eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\nAt last the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s speed was moderated by the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s orders; the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d ranged along the end of the south and east batteries, and was\r\nsoon moored at the quay of the North Commercial Wharf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS HALLIBURTT WAS STANDING ON THE POOP.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                          A SOUTHERN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d on arriving at the Charleston quay, had been saluted by\r\nthe cheers of a large crowd. The inhabitants of this town, strictly\r\nblockaded by sea, were not accustomed to visits from European ships.\r\nThey asked each other, not without astonishment, what this great\r\nsteamer, proudly bearing the English flag, had come to do in their\r\nwaters; but when they learned the object of her voyage, and why she had\r\njust forced the passage Sullivan, when the report spread that she\r\ncarried a cargo of smuggled ammunition, the cheers and joyful cries were\r\nredoubled.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair, without losing a moment, entered into negotiation with\r\nGeneral Beauregard, the military commander of the town. The latter\r\neagerly received the young Captain of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d who had arrived in\r\ntime to provide the soldiers with the clothes and ammunition they were\r\nso much in want of. It was agreed that the unloading of the ship should\r\ntake place immediately, and numerous hands came to help the English\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting his ship James Playfair had received from Miss\r\nHalliburtt the most pressing injunctions with regard to her father, and\r\nthe Captain had placed himself entirely at the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Jenny,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may rely on me; I will do the utmost in\r\nmy power to save your father, but I hope this business will not present\r\nmany difficulties; I shall go and see General Beauregard to-day, and\r\nwithout asking him at once for Mr. Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s liberty, I shall learn\r\nin what situation he is, whether he is on bail, or a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor father!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Jenny, sighing; \xe2\x80\x9che little thinks his daughter\r\nis so near him. Oh that I could fly into his arms!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little patience, Miss Jenny, you will soon embrace your father. Rely\r\nupon my acting with the most entire devotion, but also with prudence and\r\nconsideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is why James Playfair, after having delivered the cargo of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d up to the General, and bargained for an immense stock of\r\ncotton, faithful to his promise, turned the conversation to the events\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou believe in the triumph of the slave-holders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not for a moment doubt of our final success, and as regards\r\nCharleston, Lee\xe2\x80\x99s army will soon relieve it: besides, what do you expect\r\nfrom the Abolitionists? admitting that which will never be, that the\r\ncommercial towns of Virginia, the two Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, fall\r\nunder their power, what then? Will they be masters of a country they can\r\nnever occupy? No, certainly not; and for my part if they are ever\r\nvictorious they shall pay dearly for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are quite sure of your soldiers?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nnot afraid that Charleston will grow weary of a siege which is ruining\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not fear treason; besides, the traitors would be punished\r\nremorselessly, and I would destroy the town itself by sword or fire if I\r\ndiscovered the least Unionist movement. Jefferson Davis confided\r\nCharleston to me, and you may be sure that Charleston is in safe hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any Federal prisoners?\xe2\x80\x9d asked James Playfair, coming to the\r\ninteresting object of the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the General, \xe2\x80\x9cit was at Charleston that the\r\nfirst shot of separation was fired. The Abolitionists who were here\r\nattempted to resist, and after being defeated they have been kept as\r\nprisoners of war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you many?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree in the town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were until I discovered a plot formed by them: their chief\r\nsucceeded in establishing a communication with the besiegers, who were\r\nthus informed of the situation of affairs in the town. I was then\r\nobliged to lock up these dangerous guests, and several of them will only\r\nleave their prison to ascend the slope of the citadel, where ten\r\nconfederate balls will reward them for their federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! to be shot!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young man, shuddering involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and their chief first of all. He is a very dangerous man to have\r\nin a besieged town. I have sent his letters to the President at\r\nRichmond, and before a week is passed his sentence will be irrevocably\r\npassed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this man you speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d asked James Playfair, with an assumed\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA journalist from Boston, a violent Abolitionist with the confounded\r\nspirit of Lincoln.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJonathan Halliburtt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor wretch!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed James, suppressing his emotion; \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever he\r\nmay have done one cannot help pitying him. And you think that he will be\r\nshot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Beauregard. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you expect? War is war,\r\none must defend oneself as best one can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it is nothing to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be far enough\r\naway when this execution takes place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you are thinking of going away already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, General, business must be attended to; as soon as my cargo of\r\ncotton is on board I shall be out to sea again. I was fortunate enough\r\nto enter the bay, but the difficulty is in getting out again. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 is a good ship; she can beat any of the Federal ships for\r\nspeed, but she does not pretend to distance cannon-balls, and a shell in\r\nher hull or engine would seriously affect my enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please, Captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Beauregard; \xe2\x80\x9cI have no advice to give\r\nyou under such circumstances. You are doing your business, and you are\r\nright. I should act in the same manner were I in your place; besides a\r\nstay at Charleston is not very pleasant, and a harbour where shells are\r\nfalling three days out of four is not a safe shelter for your ship; so\r\nyou will set sail when you please; but can you tell me what is the\r\nnumber and the force of the Federal ships cruising before Charleston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair did his best to answer the General, and took leave of him\r\non the best of terms; then he returned to the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d very thoughtful\r\nand very depressed from what he had just heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say to Miss Jenny? ought I to tell her of Mr. Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterrible situation? or would it be better to keep her in ignorance of\r\nthe trial which is awaiting her? Poor child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had not gone fifty steps from the governor\xe2\x80\x99s house when he ran\r\nagainst Crockston: the worthy American had been watching for him since\r\nhis departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJames Playfair looked steadily at Crockston, and the latter soon\r\nunderstood he had no favourable news to give him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Beauregard?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you spoken to him about Mr. Halliburtt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! it was he who spoke to me about him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I may as well tell you everything, Crockston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Beauregard has told me that your master will be shot within a\r\nweek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this news any one else but Crockston would have grown furious or\r\ngiven way to bursts of grief, but the American, who feared nothing, only\r\nsaid, with almost a smile on his lips,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow! what does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you that Mr.\r\nHalliburtt will be shot within a week, and you answer, what does it\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I mean it\xe2\x80\x94if in six days he is on board the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin,\xe2\x80\x99 and if in\r\nseven days the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 is on the open sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Captain, pressing Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand, my good fellow, you have got some pluck; and for myself, in\r\nspite of Uncle Vincent, I would throw myself overboard for Miss Jenny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one need be thrown overboard,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American, \xe2\x80\x9conly the fish\r\nwould gain by that: the most important business now is to deliver Mr.\r\nHalliburtt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must know that it will be difficult to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a question of communicating with a prisoner strictly guarded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to bring about an almost miraculous escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Crockston; \xe2\x80\x9ca prisoner thinks more of escaping\r\nthan his guardian thinks of keeping him; that\xe2\x80\x99s why, thanks to our help,\r\nMr. Halliburtt will be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Crockston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now what will you do? there must be some plan; and there are\r\nprecautions to be taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when Miss Jenny learns that her father is condemned to death, and\r\nthat the order for his execution may come any day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will know nothing about it, that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be better for her and for us to tell her nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Halliburtt imprisoned?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the citadel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so!\xe2\x80\x94On board now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn board, Crockston!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                              THE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Jenny, sitting at the poop of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d was anxiously waiting\r\nthe captain\xe2\x80\x99s return; when the latter went up to her she could not utter\r\na word, but her eyes questioned James Playfair more eagerly than her\r\nlips could have done. The latter, with Crockston\xe2\x80\x99s help, informed the\r\nyoung girl of the facts relating to her father\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment. He said\r\nthat he had carefully broached the subject of the prisoners of war to\r\nBeauregard, but as the General did not seem disposed at all in their\r\nfavour, he had thought it better to say no more about it, but think the\r\nmatter over again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince Mr. Halliburtt is not free in the town, his escape will be more\r\ndifficult; but I will finish my task, and I promise you, Miss Jenny,\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 shall not leave Charleston, without having your\r\nfather on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. James; I thank you with my whole heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \xe2\x80\x9cI PROMISE YOU, MISS JENNY.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nAt these words James Playfair felt a thrill of joy through his whole\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nHe approached the young girl with moist eyes and quivering lips; perhaps\r\nhe was going to make an avowal of the sentiments he could no longer\r\nrepress, when Crockston interfered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no time for grieving,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must go to work, and\r\nconsider what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any plan, Crockston?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the young girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always have a plan,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American; \xe2\x80\x9cit is my peculiarity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a good one?\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent! and all the ministers in Washington could not devise a\r\nbetter; it is almost as good as if Mr. Halliburtt was already on board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrockston spoke with such perfect assurance, at the same time with such\r\nsimplicity, that it must have been the most incredulous person who could\r\ndoubt his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are listening, Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! You, Captain, will go to General Beauregard, and ask a favour of\r\nhim which he will not refuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will tell him that you have on board a tiresome subject, a scamp\r\nwho has been very troublesome during the voyage, and excited the crew to\r\nrevolt. You will ask of him permission to shut him up in the citadel; at\r\nthe same time on the condition that he shall return to the ship on her\r\ndeparture, in order to be taken back to England, to be delivered over to\r\nthe justice of his country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, half smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cI will do all that, and\r\nBeauregard will grant my request very willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly sure of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the American.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cone thing is wanting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe scamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is before you, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the rebellious subject?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs myself; don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you brave, generous heart,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jenny, pressing the American\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrough hands between her small white palms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, my friend; and\r\nI only regret one thing, that is, that I cannot take your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one his part,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston; \xe2\x80\x9cif you put yourself in my\r\nplace you would be very much embarrassed, which I shall not be; you will\r\nhave enough to do later on to get out of the harbour under the fire of\r\nthe Feds and Rebs, which, for my part, I should manage very badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Crockston, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce in the citadel\xe2\x80\x94I know it\xe2\x80\x94I shall see what to do, and rest assured\r\nI shall do my best; in the meanwhile, you will be getting your cargo on\r\nboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! business is now a very unimportant detail,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all! and what would your uncle Vincent say to that? We must join\r\nsentiment with work; it will prevent suspicion; but do it quickly. Can\r\nyou be ready in six days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, let the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 be ready to start on the 22nd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall be ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the evening of the 22nd of January, you understand, send a\r\nshore-boat with your best men to White Point, at the end of the town;\r\nwait there till nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then you will see Mr. Halliburtt and\r\nyour servant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how will you manage to effect Mr. Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s deliverance, and\r\nalso escape yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my look-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Crockston, you are going to risk your life then, to save my\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy, Miss Jenny, I shall risk absolutely nothing, you may\r\nbelieve me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen must I have you locked up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-day\xe2\x80\x94you understand\xe2\x80\x94I demoralize your crew; there is no time to be\r\nlost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like any money? it may be of use to you in the citadel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney to buy the gaoler! Oh, no! it would be a poor bargain; when one\r\ngoes there the gaoler keeps the money and the prisoner! No! I have surer\r\nmeans than that; however, a few dollars may be useful; one must be able\r\nto drink, if needs be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd intoxicate the gaoler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, an intoxicated gaoler would spoil everything. No, I tell you I have\r\nan idea, let me work it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my good fellow, are ten dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too much, but I will return what is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, are you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ready to be a downright rogue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to work then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl, in a faltering voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are the\r\nbest man on earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9dreplied the American, laughing good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye,\r\nCaptain, an important item.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the General proposes to hang your rebel\xe2\x80\x94you know that military men\r\nlike sharp work\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Crockston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you will say that you must think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe same day to the great astonishment of the crew, who were not in the\r\nsecret, Crockston with his feet and hands in irons was taken on shore by\r\na dozen sailors, and half-an-hour after, by Captain James Playfair\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest, he was led through the streets of the town, and in spite of his\r\nresistance was imprisoned in the citadel.\r\n\r\nDuring this and the following days the unloading of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nrapidly accomplished; the steam cranes lifted out the European cargo to\r\nmake room for the native goods. The people of Charleston, who were\r\npresent at this interesting work, helped the sailors, whom they held in\r\ngreat respect, but the Captain did not leave the brave fellows much time\r\nfor receiving compliments; he was constantly behind them, and urged them\r\non with a feverish activity, the reason of which the sailors could not\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\nThree days later, on the 18th of January, the first bales of cotton\r\nbegan to be packed in the hold; although James Playfair troubled himself\r\nno more about it, the firm of Playfair and Co. were making an excellent\r\nbargain, having obtained the cotton which encumbered the Charleston\r\nwharves at very far less than its value.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime no news had been heard of Crockston. Jenny without\r\nsaying anything about it was a prey to incessant fears, her pale face\r\nspoke for her, and James Playfair endeavoured his utmost to ease her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all confidence in Crockston,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9che is a devoted servant,\r\nas you must know better than I do, Miss Jenny. You must make yourself\r\nquite at ease; believe me, in three days you will be folded in your\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mr. James,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young girl, \xe2\x80\x9chow can I ever repay you for\r\nsuch devotion? How shall we ever be able to thank you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you when we are in English seas,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young\r\nCaptain.\r\n\r\nJenny raised her tearful face to him for a moment, then her eyelids\r\ndrooped, and she went back to her cabin.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair hoped that the young girl would know nothing of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s terrible situation until he was in safety, but she was apprized\r\nof the truth by the involuntary indiscretion of a sailor.\r\n\r\nThe reply from the Richmond cabinet had arrived by a courier who had\r\nbeen able to pass the line of outposts; the reply contained Jonathan\r\nHalliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s death-warrant. The news of the approaching execution was\r\nnot long in spreading through the town, and it was brought on board by\r\none of the sailors of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin;\xe2\x80\x9d the man told the Captain, without\r\nthinking that Miss Halliburtt was within hearing; the young girl uttered\r\na piercing cry, and fell unconscious on the deck. James Playfair carried\r\nher to her cabin, but the most assiduous care was necessary to restore\r\nher to life.\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she saw the young Captain, who, with a\r\nfinger on his lips, enjoined absolute silence. With difficulty she\r\nrepressed the outburst of her grief, and James Playfair, leaning towards\r\nher, said gently,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJenny, in two hours your father will be in safety near you, or I shall\r\nhave perished in endeavouring to save him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he left the cabin, saying to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now he must be carried\r\noff at any price, since I must pay for his liberty with my own life and\r\nthat of my crew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hour for action had arrived, the loading of the cotton cargo had\r\nbeen finished since morning; in two hours the ship would be ready to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair had left the North Commercial Wharf and gone into the\r\nroadstead, so that he was ready to make use of the tide, which would be\r\nhigh at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt was seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock when James left the young girl, and began to make\r\npreparations for departure. Until the present time the secret had been\r\nstrictly kept between himself, Crockston, and Jenny; but now he thought\r\nit wise to inform Mr. Mathew of the situation of affairs, and he did so\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Mathew, without making the least remark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock is the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and have the fires lit immediately, and the steam got\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 may remain at anchor; we will cut our moorings and sheer\r\noff, without losing a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a lantern placed at the main-mast-head; the night is dark, and\r\nwill be foggy; we must not risk losing our way in returning; you had\r\nbetter have the bell for starting rung at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour orders shall be punctually attended to, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mr. Mathew, have a shore-boat manned with six of our best men;\r\nI am going to set out directly for \xe2\x80\x98White Point.\xe2\x80\x99 I leave Miss Jenny in\r\nyour charge, and may God protect us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay God protect us!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the first officer.\r\n\r\nThen he immediately gave the necessary orders for the fires to be\r\nlighted, and the shore-boat provided with men. In a few minutes the boat\r\nwas ready, and James Playfair, after bidding Jenny good-bye, stepped\r\ninto it, whilst at the same time, he saw volumes of black smoke issuing\r\nfrom the chimneys of the ship, and losing itself in the fog.\r\n\r\nThe darkness was profound; the wind had fallen, and in the perfect\r\nsilence the waters seemed to slumber in the immense harbour, whilst a\r\nfew uncertain lights glimmered through the mist. James Playfair had\r\ntaken his place at the rudder, and with a steady hand he guided his boat\r\ntowards White Point. It was a distance of about two miles; during the\r\nday James had taken his bearings perfectly, so that he was able to make\r\ndirect for Charleston Point.\r\n\r\nEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck from the church of St. Philip when the shore-boat\r\nran aground at White Point.\r\n\r\nThere was an hour to wait before the exact time fixed by Crockston; the\r\nquay was deserted, with the exception of the sentinel pacing to and fro\r\non the south and east batteries. James Playfair grew impatient, and the\r\nminutes seemed hours to him.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight he heard the sound of approaching steps; he left his\r\nmen with their oars clear and ready to start, and went himself to see\r\nwho it was; but he had not gone ten feet when he met a band of\r\ncoast-guards, in all about twenty men. James drew his revolver from his\r\nwaist, deciding to make use of it, if needs be; but what could he do\r\nagainst these soldiers, who were coming on to the quay?\r\n\r\nThe leader came up to him, and seeing the boat, asked,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose craft is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a shore-boat belonging to the \xe2\x80\x98Dolphin,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d replied the young man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain James Playfair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had already started, and were now in the Charleston\r\nchannels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to start. I ought even now to be on my way, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d persisted the coast-guard.\r\n\r\nA bright idea shot through James\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and he answered,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my sailors is locked up in the citadel, and to tell the truth I\r\nhad almost forgotten him; fortunately I thought of him in time, and I\r\nhave sent my men to bring him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that troublesome fellow; you wish to take him back to England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might as well be hung here as there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the coast-guard, laughing\r\nat his joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Playfair, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is better to have the thing\r\ndone in the regular way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much chance of that, Captain, when you have to face the Morris\r\nIsland batteries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself. I got in and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProsperous voyage to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this the men went off, and the shore was left silent.\r\n\r\nAt this moment nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock struck; it was the appointed moment. James\r\nfelt his heart beat violently: a whistle was heard; he replied to it,\r\nthen he waited, listening, with his hand up to enjoin perfect silence on\r\nthe sailors; a man appeared enveloped in a large cloak, and looking from\r\none side to another, James ran up to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. HALLIBURTT?]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Halliburtt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am he,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man with the cloak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cembark without losing a minute.\r\nWhere is Crockston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrockston!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Halliburtt, amazed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who has saved you and brought you here was your servant\r\nCrockston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who came with me was the gaoler from the citadel,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr.\r\nHalliburtt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gaoler!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair.\r\n\r\nEvidently he knew nothing about it, and a thousand fears crowded in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, the gaoler,\xe2\x80\x9d cried a well-known voice; \xe2\x80\x9cthe gaoler is\r\nsleeping like a top in my cell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCrockston! you! can it be you?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Mr. Halliburtt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo time to talk now, master; we will explain everything to you\r\nafterwards; it is a question of life or death. Get in quick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three men took their places in the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain.\r\n\r\nImmediately the six oars dipped into the water; the boat darted like a\r\nfish through the waters of Charleston Harbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                          \xe2\x80\x9cBETWEEN TWO FIRES.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat, pulled by six robust oarsmen, flew over the water. The fog was\r\ngrowing dense, and it was with difficulty that James Playfair succeeded\r\nin keeping to the line of his bearings. Crockston sat at the bows, and\r\nMr. Halliburtt at the stern next the Captain. The prisoner, only now\r\ninformed of the presence of his servant, wished to speak to him, but the\r\nlatter enjoined silence.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few minutes later, when they were in the middle of the\r\nharbour, Crockston determined to speak knowing what thoughts were\r\nuppermost in Mr. Halliburtt\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear master,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gaoler is in my place in the cell,\r\nwhere I gave him two smart blows, one on the head and the other on the\r\nstomach, to act as a sleeping draught, and this when he was bringing me\r\nmy supper; there is gratitude for you. I took his clothes and his keys,\r\nfound you, and let you out of the citadel, under the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 noses.\r\nThat is all I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my daughter?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Halliburtt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs on board the ship which is going to take you to England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter there! there!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the American, springing from his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9ca few minutes, and we shall be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat flew through the darkness, but James Playfair was obliged to\r\nsteer rather by guess, as the lanterns of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d were no longer\r\nvisible through the fog. He was undecided what direction to follow, and\r\nthe darkness was so great that the rowers could not even see to the end\r\nof their oars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. James?\xe2\x80\x9d said Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have made more than a mile and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Captain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything, Crockston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; nevertheless I have good eyes, but we shall get there all\r\nright. They don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect anything out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese words were hardly finished when the flash of a gun gleamed for an\r\ninstant through the darkness, and vanished in the mist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA signal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9cit must have come from the citadel. Let us\r\nwait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA second, then a third shot was fired in the direction of the first, and\r\nalmost the same signal was repeated a mile in front of the shore-boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is from Fort Sumter,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Crockston, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is the signal of\r\nescape. Urge on the men; everything is discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull for your lives, my men!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, urging on the\r\nsailors, \xe2\x80\x9cthose gun-shots cleared my route. \xe2\x80\x98The Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99 is eight\r\nhundred yards ahead of us. Stop! I hear the bell on board. Hurrah, there\r\nit is again! Twenty pounds for you if we are back in five minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat skimmed over the waves under the sailors\xe2\x80\x99 powerful oars. A\r\ncannon boomed in the direction of the town. Crockston heard a ball whiz\r\npast them.\r\n\r\nThe bell on the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was ringing loudly. A few more strokes and the\r\nboat was alongside. A few more seconds and Jenny fell into her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JENNY FELL INTO HER FATHER\xe2\x80\x99s ARMS.]\r\n\r\nThe shore-boat was immediately raised, and James Playfair sprang on to\r\nthe poop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the steam up, Mr. Mathew?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the moorings cut at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the two screws carried the steamer towards the\r\nprincipal channel, away from Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathew,\xe2\x80\x9d said James, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must not think of taking the Sullivan\r\nIsland channel; we should run directly under the Confederate guns. Let\r\nus go as near as possible to the right side of the harbour out of range\r\nof the Federal batteries. Have you a safe man at the helm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave the lanterns and the fires on deck extinguished; there is a great\r\ndeal too much light, but we cannot help the reflection from the\r\nengine-rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was going at a great speed; but\r\nin altering her course to keep to the right side of the Charleston\r\nHarbour she was obliged to enter a channel which took her for a moment\r\nnear Fort Sumter; and when scarcely half a mile off all the guns bearing\r\non her were discharged at the same time, and a shower of shot and shell\r\npassed in front of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d with a thundering report.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo soon, stupids,\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair, with a burst of laughter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake haste, make haste, Mr. Engineer! We shall get between two fires.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stokers fed the furnaces, and the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d trembled all over with\r\nthe effort of the engine as if she was on the point of exploding.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a second report was heard, and another shower of balls\r\nwhizzed behind the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late, stupids,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young Captain, with a regular roar.\r\n\r\nThen Crockston, who was standing on the poop, cried, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s one passed.\r\nA few minutes more, and we shall have done with the Rebs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do you think we have nothing more to fear from Fort Sumter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing at all, but everything from Fort Moultrie, at the end of\r\nSullivan Island; but they will only get a chance at us for half a\r\nminute, and then they must choose their time well, and shoot straight if\r\nthey want to reach us. We are getting near.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight; the position of Fort Moultrie will allow us to go straight for\r\nthe principal channel. Fire away then, fire away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, and as if in obedience to James Playfair, the fort\r\nwas illuminated by a triple line of lightning. A frightful crash was\r\nheard; then a crackling sound on board the steamer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouched this time!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Crockston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathew!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain to his second, who was stationed at the\r\nbows, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has been damaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bowsprit broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, the masts may go to Jericho. Straight into the pass!\r\nStraight! and steer towards the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have passed the Rebs!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Crockston; \xe2\x80\x9cand if we must have balls\r\nin our hull, I would much rather have the Northerners\xe2\x80\x99; they are more\r\neasily digested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn fact, the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d could not yet consider herself out of danger; for\r\nif Morris Island was not fortified with the formidable pieces of\r\nartillery which were placed there a few months later, nevertheless its\r\nguns and mortars could easily have sunk a ship like the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe alarm had been given to the Federals on the island, and to the\r\nblockading squadron, by the firing from Forts Sumter and Moultrie. The\r\nbesiegers could not make out the reason of this night attack; it did not\r\nseem to be directed against them. However, they were obliged to consider\r\nit so, and were ready to reply.\r\n\r\nIt occupied James Playfair\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts whilst making towards the passes\r\nof Morris Island; and he had reason to fear, for in a quarter of an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s time lights gleamed rapidly through the darkness. A shower of\r\nsmall shell fell round the steamer, scattering the water over her\r\nbulwarks; some of them even struck the deck of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d but not on\r\ntheir points, which saved the ship from certain ruin. In fact, these\r\nshell, as it was afterwards discovered, could break into a hundred\r\nfragments, and each cover a superficial area of a hundred and twenty\r\nsquare feet with Greek fire, which would burn for twenty minutes, and\r\nnothing could extinguish it. One of these shell alone could set a ship\r\non fire. Fortunately for the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d they were a new invention, and\r\nas yet far from perfect. Once thrown into the air, a false rotary\r\nmovement kept them inclined, and, when falling, instead of striking on\r\ntheir points, where is the percussion apparatus, they fell flat. This\r\ndefect in construction alone saved the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d The falling of these\r\nshells did her little harm, and under the pressure of her over-heated\r\nboilers she continued to advance into the pass.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and in spite of his orders, Mr. Halliburtt and his\r\ndaughter went to James Playfair on the poop; the latter urged them to\r\nreturn to their cabins, but Jenny declared that she would remain by the\r\nCaptain. As for Mr. Halliburtt, who had just learnt all the noble\r\nconduct of his deliverer, he pressed his hand without being able to\r\nutter a word.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d was speeding rapidly towards the open sea. There were only\r\nthree miles more before she would be in the waters of the Atlantic; if\r\nthe pass was free at its entrance, she was saved. James Playfair was\r\nwonderfully well acquainted with all the secrets of Charleston Bay, and\r\nhe guided his ship through the darkness with an unerring hand. He was\r\nbeginning to think his daring enterprise successful, when a sailor on\r\nthe forecastle cried,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA ship?\xe2\x80\x9d cried James.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, on the larboard side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fog had cleared off, and a large frigate was seen making towards the\r\npass, in order to obstruct the passage of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nnecessary, cost what it might, to distance her, and urge the\r\nsteam-engine to an increase of speed, or all was lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPort the helm at once!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain.\r\n\r\nThen he sprang on to the bridge above the engine. By his orders one of\r\nthe screws was stopped, and under the action of the other the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nveering with an extraordinary rapidity avoided running foul of the\r\nfrigate, and advanced like her to the entrance of the pass. It was now a\r\nquestion of speed.\r\n\r\nJames Playfair understood that in this lay his own safety, Miss Jenny\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s, and that of all his crew.\r\n\r\nThe frigate was considerably in advance of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d It was evident\r\nfrom the volumes of black smoke issuing from her chimneys that she was\r\ngetting up her steam. James Playfair was not the man to be left in the\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are the engines?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he to the engineer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the maximum speed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter; \xe2\x80\x9cthe steam is escaping by\r\nall the valves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFasten them down,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the Captain.\r\n\r\nAnd his orders were executed at the risk of blowing up the ship.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d again increased her speed; the pistons worked with\r\nfrightful rapidity; the metal plates on which the engine was placed\r\ntrembled under the terrific force of their blows. It was a sight to make\r\nthe boldest shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore pressure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried James Playfair; \xe2\x80\x9cput on more pressure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cthe valves are tightly closed; our\r\nfurnaces are full up to the mouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference! Fill them with cotton soaked in spirits; we must pass\r\nthat frigate at any price.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words the most daring of the sailors looked at each other, but\r\ndid not hesitate. Some bales of cotton were thrown into the engine-room,\r\na barrel of spirits broached over them, and this expensive fuel placed,\r\nnot without danger, in the red-hot furnaces. The stokers could no longer\r\nhear each other speak for the roaring of the flames. Soon the metal\r\nplates of the furnaces became red-hot; the pistons worked like the\r\npistons of a locomotive; the steam-gauge showed a frightful tension; the\r\nsteamer flew over the water; her boards creaked, and her chimneys threw\r\nout volumes of smoke mingled with flames. She was going at a headlong\r\nspeed, but, nevertheless, she was gaining on the frigate\xe2\x80\x94passed her,\r\ndistanced her, and in ten minutes was out of the channel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaved!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the crew, clapping their hands.\r\n\r\nAlready the Charleston beacon was disappearing in the south-west; the\r\nsound of firing from the batteries grew fainter, and it might with\r\nreason be thought that the danger was all past, when a shell from a\r\ngun-boat cruising at large was hurled whizzing through the air. It was\r\neasy to trace its course, thanks to the line of fire which followed it.\r\n\r\nThen was a moment of anxiety impossible to describe, every one was\r\nsilent, and each watched fearfully the arch described by the projectile.\r\nNothing could be done to escape it, and in a few seconds it fell with a\r\nfrightful noise on the fore-deck of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe terrified sailors crowded to the stern, and no one dared move a\r\nstep, whilst the shell was burning with a brisk crackle.\r\n\r\nBut one brave man alone among them ran up to the formidable weapon of\r\ndestruction. It was Crockston; he took the shell in his strong arms,\r\nwhilst showers of sparks were falling from it; then, with a superhuman\r\neffort, he threw it overboard.\r\n\r\nHardly had the shell reached the surface of the water when it burst with\r\na frightful report.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the whole crew of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin\xe2\x80\x9d unanimously,\r\nwhilst Crockston rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE TOOK THE SHELL.]\r\n\r\nSome time later the steamer sped rapidly through the waters of the\r\nAtlantic; the American coast disappeared in the darkness, and the\r\ndistant lights which shot across the horizon indicated that the attack\r\nwas general between the batteries of Morris Island and the forts of\r\nCharleston Harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                               ST. MUNGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day at sunrise the American coast had disappeared; not a ship\r\nwas visible on the horizon, and the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d moderating the frightful\r\nrapidity of her speed, made quietly towards the Bermudas.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to recount the passage across the Atlantic, which was\r\nmarked by no accidents, and ten days after the departure from Queenstown\r\nthe French coast was hailed.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between the Captain and the young girl may be imagined, even\r\nby the least observant individuals. How could Mr. Halliburtt acknowledge\r\nthe devotion and courage of his deliverer, if it was not by making him\r\nthe happiest of men? James Playfair did not wait for English seas to\r\ndeclare to the father and daughter the sentiments which overflowed his\r\nheart, and, if Crockston is to be believed, Miss Jenny received his\r\nconfession with a happiness she did not try to conceal.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that on the 14th of February, 18\xe2\x80\x94, a numerous crowd was\r\ncollected in the dim aisles of St. Mungo, the old cathedral of Glasgow.\r\nThere were seamen, merchants, manufacturers, magistrates, and some of\r\nevery denomination, gathered here. There was Miss Jenny in bridal array,\r\nand beside her the worthy Crockston, resplendent in apple-green clothes,\r\nwith gold buttons, whilst Uncle Vincent stood proudly by his nephew.\r\n\r\nIn short, they were celebrating the marriage of James Playfair, of the\r\nfirm of Vincent Playfair and Co., of Glasgow, with Miss Jenny\r\nHalliburtt, of Boston.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was accomplished amidst great pomp. Every one knew the\r\nhistory of the \xe2\x80\x9cDolphin,\xe2\x80\x9d and every one thought the young Captain well\r\nrecompensed for his devotion.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
