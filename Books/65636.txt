Well known, that is\r\nto say, to the railroad aristocracy of that time; men who had to do with\r\nthe railroad itself, or with one of the "land companies" which were its\r\nby-products. In those days it was enough to say of a man that he was\r\n"connected with the Burlington." There were the directors, the general\r\nmanagers, vice-presidents, superintendents, whose names we all knew; and\r\ntheir younger brothers or nephews were auditors, freight agents,\r\ndepartmental assistants. Everyone "connected" with the Road, even the\r\nlarge cattle and grain-shippers, had annual passes; they and their\r\nfamilies rode about over the line a great deal. There were then two\r\ndistinct social strata in the prairie States; the homesteaders and\r\nhand-workers who were there to make a living, and the bankers and\r\ngentlemen ranchers who came from the Atlantic seaboard to invest money\r\nand to "develop our great West," as they used to tell us.\r\n\r\nWhen the Burlington men were travelling back and forth on business not\r\nvery urgent, they found it agreeable to drop off the express and spend a\r\nnight in a pleasant house where their importance was delicately\r\nrecognized; and no house was pleasanter than that of Captain Daniel\r\nForrester, at Sweet Water. Captain Forrester was himself a railroad man,\r\na contractor, who had built hundreds of miles of road for the\r\nBurlington,--over the sage brush and cattle country, and on up into the\r\nBlack Hills.\r\n\r\nThe Forrester place, as every one called it, was not at all remarkable;\r\nthe people who lived there made it seem much larger and finer than it\r\nwas. The house stood on a low round hill, nearly a mile east of town; a\r\nwhite house with a wing, and sharp-sloping roofs to shed the snow. It\r\nwas encircled by porches, too narrow for modern notions of comfort,\r\nsupported by the fussy, fragile pillars of that time, when every honest\r\nstick of timber was tortured by the turning-lathe into something\r\nhideous. Stripped of its vines and denuded of its shrubbery, the house\r\nwould probably have been ugly enough. It stood close into a fine\r\ncottonwood grove that threw sheltering arms to left and right and grew\r\nall down the hillside behind it. Thus placed on the hill, against its\r\nbristling grove, it was the first thing one saw on coming into Sweet\r\nWater by rail, and the last thing one saw on departing.\r\n\r\nTo approach Captain Forrester\'s property, you had first to get over a\r\nwide, sandy creek which flowed along the eastern edge of the town.\r\nCrossing this by the foot-bridge or the ford, you entered the Captain\'s\r\nprivate lane, bordered by Lombardy poplars, with wide meadows lying on\r\neither side. Just at the foot of the hill on which the house sat, one\r\ncrossed a second creek by the stout wooden road-bridge. This stream\r\ntraced artless loops and curves through the broad meadows that were half\r\npasture land, half marsh. Any one but Captain Forrester would have\r\ndrained the bottom land and made it into highly productive fields. But\r\nhe had selected this place long ago because it looked beautiful to him,\r\nand he happened to like the way the creek wound through his pasture,\r\nwith mint and joint-grass and twinkling willows along its banks. He was\r\nwell off for those times, and he had no children. He could afford to\r\nhumour his fancies.\r\n\r\nWhen the Captain drove friends from Omaha or Denver over from the\r\nstation in his democrat wagon, it gratified him to hear these gentlemen\r\nadmire his fine stock, grazing in the meadows on either side of his\r\nlane. And when they reached the top of the hill, it gratified him to see\r\nmen who were older than himself leap nimbly to the ground and run up the\r\nfront steps as Mrs. Forrester came out on the porch to greet them. Even\r\nthe hardest and coldest of his friends, a certain narrow-faced Lincoln\r\nbanker, became animated when he took her hand, tried to meet the gay\r\nchallenge in her eyes and to reply cleverly to the droll word of\r\ngreeting on her lips.\r\n\r\nShe was always there, just outside the front door, to welcome their\r\nvisitors, having been warned of their approach by the sound of hoofs and\r\nthe rumble of wheels on the wooden bridge. If she happened to be in the\r\nkitchen, helping her Bohemian cook, she came out in her apron, waving a\r\nbuttery iron spoon, or shook cherry-stained fingers at the new arrival.\r\nShe never stopped to pin up a lock; she was attractive in dishabille,\r\nand she knew it. She had been known to rush to the door in her\r\ndressing-gown, brush in hand and her long black hair rippling over her\r\nshoulders, to welcome Cyrus Dalzell, president of the Colorado & Utah;\r\nand that great man had never felt more flattered. In his eyes, and in\r\nthe eyes of the admiring middle-aged men who visited there, whatever\r\nMrs. Forrester chose to do was "lady-like" because she did it. They\r\ncould not imagine her in any dress or situation in which she would not\r\nbe charming. Captain Forrester himself, a man of few words, told Judge\r\nPommeroy that he had never seen her look more captivating than on the\r\nday when she was chased by the new bull in the pasture. She had\r\nforgotten about the bull and gone into the meadow to gather wild\r\nflowers. He heard her scream, and as he ran puffing down the hill, she\r\nwas scudding along the edge of the marshes like a hare, beside herself\r\nwith laughter, and stubbornly clinging to the crimson parasol that had\r\nmade all the trouble.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester was twenty-five years younger than her husband, and she\r\nwas his second wife. He married her in California and brought her to\r\nSweet Water a bride. They called the place home even then, when they\r\nlived there but a few months out of each year. But later, after the\r\nCaptain\'s terrible fall with his horse in the mountains, which broke him\r\nso that he could no longer build railroads, he and his wife retired to\r\nthe house on the hill. He grew old there,--and even she, alas! grew\r\nolder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we will begin this story with a summer morning long ago, when Mrs.\r\nForrester was still a young woman, and Sweet Water was a town of which\r\ngreat things were expected. That morning she was standing in the deep\r\nbay-window of her parlour, arranging old-fashioned blush roses in a\r\nglass bowl. Glancing up, she saw a group of little boys coming along the\r\ndriveway, barefoot, with fishing-poles and lunch-baskets. She knew most\r\nof them; there was Niel Herbert, Judge Pommeroy\'s nephew, a handsome boy\r\nof twelve whom she liked; and polite George Adams, son of a gentleman\r\nrancher from Lowell, Massachusetts. The others were just little boys\r\nfrom the town; the butcher\'s red-headed son, the leading grocer\'s fat\r\nbrown twins, Ed Elliott (whose flirtatious old father kept a shoe store\r\nand was the Don Juan of the lower world of Sweet Water), and the two\r\nsons of the German tailor,--pale, freckled lads with ragged clothes and\r\nragged rust-coloured hair, from whom she sometimes bought game or\r\ncatfish when they appeared silent and spook-like at her kitchen door and\r\nthinly asked if she would "care for any fish this morning."\r\n\r\nAs the boys came up the hill she saw them hesitate and consult together.\r\n"You ask her, Niel."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better, George. She goes to your house all the time, and she\r\nbarely knows me to speak to."\r\n\r\nAs they paused before the three steps which led up to the front porch,\r\nMrs. Forrester came to the door and nodded graciously, one of the pink\r\nroses in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, boys. Off for a picnic?"\r\n\r\nGeorge Adams stepped forward and solemnly took off his big straw hat.\r\n"Good-morning, Mrs. Forrester. Please may we fish and wade down in the\r\nmarsh and have our lunch in the grove?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. You have a lovely day. How long has school been out? Don\'t\r\nyou miss it? I\'m sure Niel does. Judge Pommeroy tells me he\'s very\r\nstudious."\r\n\r\nThe boys laughed, and Niel looked unhappy.\r\n\r\n"Run along, and be sure you don\'t leave the gate into the pasture open.\r\nMr. Forrester hates to have the cattle get in on his blue grass."\r\n\r\nThe boys went quietly round the house to the gate into the grove, then\r\nran shouting down the grassy slopes under the tall trees. Mrs. Forrester\r\nwatched them from the kitchen window until they disappeared behind the\r\nroll of the hill. She turned to her Bohemian cook.\r\n\r\n"Mary, when you are baking this morning, put in a pan of cookies for\r\nthose boys. I\'ll take them down when they are having their lunch."\r\n\r\nThe round hill on which the Forrester house stood sloped gently down to\r\nthe bridge in front, and gently down through the grove behind. But east\r\nof the house, where the grove ended, it broke steeply from high grassy\r\nbanks, like bluffs, to the marsh below. It was thither the boys were\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nWhen lunch time came they had done none of the things they meant to do.\r\nThey had behaved like wild creatures all morning; shouting from the\r\nbreezy bluffs, dashing down into the silvery marsh through the dewy\r\ncobwebs that glistened on the tall weeds, swishing among the pale tan\r\ncattails, wading in the sandy creek bed, chasing a striped water snake\r\nfrom the old willow stump where he was sunning himself, cutting\r\nsling-shot crotches, throwing themselves on their stomachs to drink at\r\nthe cool spring that flowed out from under a bank into a thatch of dark\r\nwatercress. Only the two German boys, Rheinhold and Adolph Blum,\r\nwithdrew to a still pool where the creek was dammed by a reclining tree\r\ntrunk, and, in spite of all the noise and splashing about them, managed\r\nto catch a few suckers.\r\n\r\nThe wild roses were wide open and brilliant, the blue-eyed grass was in\r\npurple flower, and the silvery milkweed was just coming on. Birds and\r\nbutterflies darted everywhere. All at once the breeze died, the air grew\r\nvery hot, the marsh steamed, and the birds disappeared. The boys found\r\nthey were tired; their shirts stuck to their bodies and their hair to\r\ntheir foreheads. They left the sweltering marsh-meadows for the grove,\r\nlay down on the clean grass under the grateful shade of the tall\r\ncottonwoods, and spread out their lunch. The Blum boys never brought\r\nanything but rye bread and hunks of dry cheese,--their companions\r\nwouldn\'t have touched it on any account. But Thaddeus Grimes, the\r\nbutcher\'s red-headed son, was the only one impolite enough to show his\r\nscorn. "You live on wienies to home, why don\'t you never bring none?" he\r\nbawled.\r\n\r\n"Hush," said Niel Herbert. He pointed to a white figure coming rapidly\r\ndown through the grove, under the flickering leaf shadows,--Mrs.\r\nForrester, bareheaded, a basket on her arm, her blue-black hair shining\r\nin the sun. It was not until years afterward that she began to wear\r\nveils and sun hats, though her complexion was never one of her beauties.\r\nHer cheeks were pale and rather thin, slightly freckled in summer.\r\n\r\nAs she approached, George Adams, who had a particular mother, rose, and\r\nNiel followed his example.\r\n\r\n"Here are some hot cookies for your lunch, boys." She took the napkin\r\noff the basket. "Did you catch anything?"\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t fish much. Just ran about," said George.\r\n\r\n"I know! You were wading and things." She had a nice way of talking to\r\nboys, light and confidential. "I wade down there myself sometimes, when\r\nI go down to get flowers. I can\'t resist it. I pull off my stockings and\r\npick up my skirts, and in I go!" She thrust out a white shoe and shook\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"But you can swim, can\'t you, Mrs. Forrester," said George. "Most women\r\ncan\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, they can! In California everybody swims. But the Sweet Water\r\ndoesn\'t tempt me,--mud and water snakes and blood-suckers--Ugh!" she\r\nshivered, laughing.\r\n\r\n"We seen a water snake this morning and chased him. A whopper!" Thad\r\nGrimes put in.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you kill him? Next time I go wading he\'ll bite my toes! Now,\r\ngo on with your lunch. George can leave the basket with Mary as you go\r\nout." She left them, and they watched her white figure drifting along\r\nthe edge of the grove as she stopped here and there to examine the\r\nraspberry vines by the fence.\r\n\r\n"These are good cookies, all right," said one of the giggly brown Weaver\r\ntwins. The German boys munched in silence. They were all rather pleased\r\nthat Mrs. Forrester had come down to them herself, instead of sending\r\nMary. Even rough little Thad Grimes, with his red thatch and catfish\r\nmouth--the characteristic feature of all the Grimes brood--knew that\r\nMrs. Forrester was a very special kind of person. George and Niel were\r\nalready old enough to see for themselves that she was different from the\r\nother townswomen, and to reflect upon what it was that made her so. The\r\nBlum brothers regarded her humbly from under their pale, chewed-off\r\nhair, as one of the rich and great of the world. They realized, more\r\nthan their companions, that such a fortunate and privileged class was an\r\naxiomatic fact in the social order.\r\n\r\nThe boys had finished their lunch and were lying on the grass talking\r\nabout how Judge Pommeroy\'s water spaniel, Fanny, had been poisoned, and\r\nwho had certainly done it, when they had a second visitor.\r\n\r\n"Shut up, boys, there he comes now. That\'s Poison Ivy," said one of the\r\nWeaver twins. "Shut up, we don\'t want old Roger poisoned."\r\n\r\nA well-grown boy of eighteen or nineteen, dressed in a shabby corduroy\r\nhunting suit, with a gun and gamebag, had climbed up from the marsh and\r\nwas coming down the grove between the rows of trees. He walked with a\r\nrude, arrogant stride, kicking at the twigs, and carried himself with\r\nunnatural erectness, as if he had a steel rod down his back. There was\r\nsomething defiant and suspicious about the way he held his head. He came\r\nup to the group and addressed them in a superior, patronizing tone.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, kids. What are _you_ doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Picnic," said Ed Elliott.\r\n\r\n"I thought girls went on picnics. Did you bring teacher along? Ain\'t you\r\nkids old enough to hunt yet?"\r\n\r\nGeorge Adams looked at him scornfully. "Of course we are. I got a 22\r\nRemington for my last birthday. But we know better than to bring guns\r\nover here. You better hide yours, Mr. Ivy, or Mrs. Forrester will come\r\ndown and tell you to get out."\r\n\r\n"She can\'t see us from the house. And anyhow, she can\'t say anything to\r\nme. I\'m just as good as she is."\r\n\r\nTo this the boys made no reply. Such an assertion was absurd even to\r\nfish-mouthed Thad; his father\'s business depended upon some people being\r\nbetter than others, and ordering better cuts of meat in consequence. If\r\neverybody ate round steak like Ivy Peters\' family, there would be\r\nnothing in the butcher\'s trade.\r\n\r\nThe visitor had put his gun and gamebag behind a tree, however, and\r\nstood stiffly upright, surveying the group out of his narrow beady eyes\r\nand making them all uncomfortable. George and Niel hated to look at\r\nIvy,--and yet his face had a kind of fascination for them. It was red,\r\nand the flesh looked hard, as if it were swollen from bee-stings, or\r\nfrom an encounter with poison ivy. This nickname, however, was given him\r\nbecause it was well known that he had "made away" with several other\r\ndogs before he had poisoned the Judge\'s friendly water spaniel. The boys\r\nsaid he took a dislike to a dog and couldn\'t rest until he made an end\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nIvy\'s red skin was flecked with tiny freckles, like rust spots, and in\r\neach of his hard cheeks there was a curly indentation, like a knot in a\r\ntree-bole,--two permanent dimples which did anything but soften his\r\ncountenance. His eyes were very small, and an absence of eyelashes gave\r\nhis pupils the fixed, unblinking hardness of a snake\'s or a lizard\'s.\r\nHis hands had the same swollen look as his face, were deeply creased\r\nacross the back and knuckles, as if the skin were stretched too tight.\r\nHe was an ugly fellow, Ivy Peters, and he liked being ugly.\r\n\r\nHe began telling the boys that it was too hot to hunt now, but later he\r\nmeant to steal down to the marsh, where the ducks came at sundown, and\r\nbag a few. "I can make off across the corn fields before the old Cap\r\nsees me. He\'s not much on the run."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll complain to your father."\r\n\r\n"A whoop my father cares!" The speaker\'s restless eyes were looking up\r\nthrough the branches. "See that woodpecker tapping; don\'t mind us a bit.\r\nThat\'s nerve!"\r\n\r\n"They are protected here, so they\'re not afraid," said precise George.\r\n\r\n"Hump! They\'ll spoil the old man\'s grove for him. That tree\'s full of\r\nholes already. Wouldn\'t he come down easy, now!"\r\n\r\nNiel and George Adams sat up. "Don\'t you dare shoot here, you\'ll get us\r\nall into trouble."\r\n\r\n"She\'d come right down from the house," cried Ed Elliott.\r\n\r\n"Let her come, stuck-up piece! Who\'s talking about shooting, anyway?\r\nThere\'s more ways of killing dogs than choking them with butter."\r\n\r\nAt this effrontery the boys shot amazed glances at one another, and the\r\nbrown Weaver twins broke simultaneously into giggles and rolled over on\r\nthe turf. But Ivy seemed unaware that he was regarded as being\r\nespecially resourceful where dogs were concerned. He drew from his\r\npocket a metal sling-shot and some round bits of gravel. "I won\'t kill\r\nit. I\'ll just surprise it, so we can have a look at it."\r\n\r\n"Bet you won\'t hit it!"\r\n\r\n"Bet I will!" He fitted the stone to the leather, squinted, and let fly.\r\nSure enough, the woodpecker dropped at his feet. He threw his heavy\r\nblack felt hat over it. Ivy never wore a straw hat, even in the hottest\r\nweather. "Now wait. He\'ll come to. You\'ll hear him flutter in a minute."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t a he, anyhow. It\'s a female. Anybody would know that," said\r\nNiel contemptuously, annoyed that this unpopular boy should come along\r\nand spoil their afternoon. He held the fate of his uncle\'s spaniel\r\nagainst Ivy Peters.\r\n\r\n"All right, Miss Female," said Ivy carelessly, intent upon a project of\r\nhis own. He took from his pocket a little red leather box, and when he\r\nopened it the boys saw that it contained curious little instruments:\r\ntiny sharp knife blades, hooks, curved needles, a saw, a blow-pipe, and\r\nscissors. "Some of these I got with a taxidermy outfit from the _Youth\'s\r\nCompanion_, and some I made myself." He got stiffly down on his\r\nknees,--his joints seemed disinclined to bend at all,--and listened\r\nbeside his hat. "She\'s as lively as a cricket," he announced. Thrusting\r\nhis hand suddenly under the brim, he brought out the startled bird. It\r\nwas not bleeding, and did not seem to be crippled.\r\n\r\n"Now, you watch, and I\'ll show you something," said Ivy. He held the\r\nwoodpecker\'s head in a vice made of his thumb and forefinger, enclosing\r\nits panting body with his palm. Quick as a flash, as if it were a\r\npractised trick, with one of those tiny blades he slit both the eyes\r\nthat glared in the bird\'s stupid little head, and instantly released it.\r\n\r\nThe woodpecker rose in the air with a whirling, corkscrew motion, darted\r\nto the right, struck a tree-trunk,--to the left, and struck another. Up\r\nand down, backward and forward among the tangle of branches it flew,\r\nraking its feathers, falling and recovering itself. The boys stood\r\nwatching it, indignant and uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. They\r\nwere not especially sensitive; Thad was always on hand when there was\r\nanything doing at the slaughter house, and the Blum boys lived by\r\nkilling things. They wouldn\'t have believed they could be so upset by a\r\nhurt woodpecker. There was something wild and desperate about the way\r\nthe darkened creature beat its wings in the branches, whirling in the\r\nsunlight and never seeing it, always thrusting its head up and shaking\r\nit, as a bird does when it is drinking. Presently it managed to get its\r\nfeet on the same limb where it had been struck, and seemed to recognize\r\nthat perch. As if it had learned something by its bruises, it pecked and\r\ncrept its way along the branch and disappeared into its own hole.\r\n\r\n"There," Niel Herbert exclaimed between his teeth, "if I can get it now,\r\nI can kill it and put it out of its misery. Let me on your back, Rhein."\r\n\r\nRheinhold was the tallest, and he obediently bent his bony back. The\r\ntrunk of a cottonwood tree is hard to climb; the bark is rough, and the\r\nbranches begin a long way up. Niel tore his trousers and scratched his\r\nbare legs smartly before he got to the first fork. After recovering\r\nbreath, he wound his way up toward the woodpecker\'s hole, which was\r\ninconveniently high. He was almost there, his companions below thought\r\nhim quite safe, when he suddenly lost his balance, turned a somersault\r\nin the air, and bumped down on the grass at their feet. There he lay\r\nwithout moving.\r\n\r\n"Run for water!"\r\n\r\n"Run for Mrs. Forrester! Ask her for whiskey."\r\n\r\n"No," said George Adams, "let\'s carry him up to the house. She will know\r\nwhat to do."\r\n\r\n"That\'s sense," said Ivy Peters. As he was much bigger and stronger than\r\nany of the others, he lifted Niel\'s limp body and started up the hill.\r\nIt had occurred to him that this would be a fine chance to get inside\r\nthe Forresters\' house and see what it was like, and this he had always\r\nwanted to do.\r\n\r\nMary, the cook, saw them coming from the kitchen window, and ran for her\r\nmistress. Captain Forrester was in Kansas City that day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester came to the back door. "What\'s happened? It\'s Niel, too!\r\nBring him in this way, please."\r\n\r\nIvy Peters followed her, keeping his eyes open, and the rest trooped\r\nafter him,--all but the Blum boys, who knew that their place was outside\r\nthe kitchen door. Mrs. Forrester led the way through the butler\'s\r\npantry, the dining-room, the back parlour, to her own bedroom. She threw\r\ndown the white counterpane, and Ivy laid Niel upon the sheets. Mrs.\r\nForrester was concerned, but not frightened.\r\n\r\n"Mary, will you bring the brandy from the sideboard. George, telephone\r\nDr. Dennison to come over at once. Now you other boys run out on the\r\nfront porch and wait quietly. There are too many of you in here." She\r\nknelt by the bed, putting brandy between Niel\'s white lips with a\r\nteaspoon. The little boys withdrew, only Ivy Peters remained standing in\r\nthe back parlour, just outside the bedroom door, his arms folded across\r\nhis chest, taking in his surroundings with bold, unblinking eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester glanced at him over her shoulder. "Will you wait on the\r\nporch, please? You are older than the others, and if anything is needed\r\nI can call on you."\r\n\r\nIvy cursed himself, but he had to go. There was something final about\r\nher imperious courtesy,--high-and-mighty, he called it. He had intended\r\nto sit down in the biggest leather chair and cross his legs and make\r\nhimself at home; but he found himself on the front porch, put out by\r\nthat delicately modulated voice as effectually as if he had been kicked\r\nout by the brawniest tough in town.\r\n\r\nNiel opened his eyes and looked wonderingly about the big, half-darkened\r\nroom, full of heavy, old-fashioned walnut furniture. He was lying on a\r\nwhite bed with ruffled pillow shams, and Mrs. Forrester was kneeling\r\nbeside him, bathing his forehead with cologne. Bohemian Mary stood\r\nbehind her, with a basin of water. "Ouch, my arm!" he muttered, and the\r\nperspiration broke out on his face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, I\'m afraid it\'s broken. Don\'t move. Dr. Dennison will be\r\nhere in a few minutes. It doesn\'t hurt very much, does it?"\r\n\r\n"No\'m," he said faintly. He was in pain, but he felt weak and contented.\r\nThe room was cool and dusky and quiet. At his house everything was\r\nhorrid when one was sick. . . . What soft fingers Mrs. Forrester had,\r\nand what a lovely lady she was. Inside the lace ruffle of her dress he\r\nsaw her white throat rising and falling so quickly. Suddenly she got up\r\nto take off her glittering rings,--she had not thought of them\r\nbefore,--shed them off her fingers with a quick motion as if she were\r\nwashing her hands, and dropped them into Mary\'s broad palm. The little\r\nboy was thinking that he would probably never be in so nice a place\r\nagain. The windows went almost down to the baseboard, like doors, and\r\nthe closed green shutters let in streaks of sunlight that quivered on\r\nthe polished floor and the silver things on the dresser. The heavy\r\ncurtains were looped back with thick cords, like ropes. The\r\nmarble-topped washstand was as big as a sideboard. The massive walnut\r\nfurniture was all inlaid with pale-coloured woods. Niel had a\r\nscroll-saw, and this inlay interested him.\r\n\r\n"There, he looks better now, doesn\'t he, Mary?" Mrs. Forrester ran her\r\nfingers through his black hair and lightly kissed him on the forehead.\r\nOh, how sweet, how sweet she smelled!\r\n\r\n"Wheels on the bridge; it\'s Doctor Dennison. Go and show him in, Mary."\r\n\r\nDr. Dennison set Niel\'s arm and took him home in his buggy. Home was not\r\na pleasant place to go to; a frail egg-shell house, set off on the edge\r\nof the prairie where people of no consequence lived. Except for the fact\r\nthat he was Judge Pommeroy\'s nephew, Niel would have been one of the\r\nboys to whom Mrs. Forrester merely nodded brightly as she passed. His\r\nfather was a widower. A poor relation, a spinster from Kentucky, kept\r\nhouse for them, and Niel thought she was probably the worst housekeeper\r\nin the world. Their house was usually full of washing in various stages\r\nof incompletion,--tubs sitting about with linen soaking,--and the beds\r\nwere "aired" until any hour in the afternoon when Cousin Sadie happened\r\nto think of making them up. She liked to sit down after breakfast and\r\nread murder trials, or peruse a well-worn copy of "St. Elmo." Sadie was\r\na good-natured thing and was always running off to help a neighbour, but\r\nNiel hated to have anyone come to see them. His father was at home very\r\nlittle, spent all his time at his office. He kept the county abstract\r\nbooks and made farm loans. Having lost his own property, he invested\r\nother people\'s money for them. He was a gentle, agreeable man, young,\r\ngood-looking, with nice manners, but Niel felt there was an air of\r\nfailure and defeat about his family. He clung to his maternal uncle,\r\nJudge Pommeroy, white-whiskered and portly, who was Captain Forrester\'s\r\nlawyer and a friend of all the great men who visited the Forresters.\r\nNiel was proud, like his mother; she died when he was five years old.\r\nShe had hated the West, and used haughtily to tell her neighbours that\r\nshe would never think of living anywhere but in Fayette county,\r\nKentucky; that they had only come to Sweet Water to make investments and\r\nto "turn the crown into the pound." By that phrase she was still\r\nremembered, poor lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the next few years Niel saw very little of Mrs. Forrester. She was\r\nan excitement that came and went with summer. She and her husband always\r\nspent the winter in Denver and Colorado Springs,--left Sweet Water soon\r\nafter Thanksgiving and did not return until the first of May. He knew\r\nthat Mrs. Forrester liked him, but she hadn\'t much time for growing\r\nboys. When she had friends staying with her, and gave a picnic supper\r\nfor them, or a dance in the grove on a moonlight night, Niel was always\r\ninvited. Coming and going along the road to the marsh with the Blum\r\nboys, he sometimes met the Captain driving visitors over in the democrat\r\nwagon, and he heard about these people from Black Tom, Judge Pommeroy\'s\r\nfaithful negro servant, who went over to wait on the table for Mrs.\r\nForrester when she had a dinner party.\r\n\r\nThen came the accident which cut short the Captain\'s career as a\r\nroadbuilder. After that fall with his horse, he lay ill at the Antlers,\r\nin Colorado Springs, all winter. In the summer, when Mrs. Forrester\r\nbrought him home to Sweet Water, he still walked with a cane. He had\r\ngrown much heavier, seemed encumbered by his own bulk, and never\r\nsuggested taking a contract for the railroad again. He was able to work\r\nin his garden, trimmed his snowball bushes and lilac hedges, devoted a\r\ngreat deal of time to growing roses. He and his wife still went away for\r\nthe winter, but each year the period of their absence grew shorter.\r\n\r\nAll this while the town of Sweet Water was changing. Its future no\r\nlonger looked bright. Successive crop failures had broken the spirit of\r\nthe farmers. George Adams and his family had gone back to Massachusetts,\r\ndisillusioned about the West. One by one the other gentlemen ranchers\r\nfollowed their example. The Forresters now had fewer visitors. The\r\nBurlington was "drawing in its horns," as people said, and the railroad\r\nofficials were not stopping off at Sweet Water so often,--were more\r\ninclined to hurry past a town where they had sunk money that would never\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\nNiel Herbert\'s father was one of the first failures to be crowded to the\r\nwall. He closed his little house, sent his cousin Sadie back to\r\nKentucky, and went to Denver to accept an office position. He left Niel\r\nbehind to read law in the office with his uncle. Not that Niel had any\r\ntaste for the law, but he liked being with Judge Pommeroy, and he might\r\nas well stay there as anywhere, for the present. The few thousand\r\ndollars his mother had left him would not be his until he was\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nNiel fitted up a room for himself behind the suite which the Judge\r\nretained for his law offices, on the second floor of the most\r\npretentious brick block in town. There he lived with monastic\r\ncleanliness and severity, glad to be rid of his cousin and her\r\ninconsequential housewifery, and resolved to remain a bachelor, like his\r\nuncle. He took care of the offices, which meant that he did the janitor\r\nwork, and arranged them exactly to suit his taste, making the rooms so\r\nattractive that all the Judge\'s friends, and especially Captain\r\nForrester, dropped in there to talk oftener than ever.\r\n\r\nThe Judge was proud of his nephew. Niel was now nineteen, a tall,\r\nstraight, deliberate boy. His features were clear-cut, his grey eyes, so\r\ndark that they looked black under his long lashes, were rather moody and\r\nchallenging. The world did not seem over-bright to young people just\r\nthen. His reserve, which did not come from embarrassment or vanity, but\r\nfrom a critical habit of mind, made him seem older than he was, and a\r\nlittle cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne winter afternoon, only a few days before Christmas, Niel sat writing\r\nin the back office, at the long table where he usually worked or\r\ntrifled, surrounded by the Judge\'s fine law library and solemn steel\r\nengravings of statesmen and jurists. His uncle was at his desk in the\r\nfront office, engaged in a friendly consultation with one of his country\r\nclients. Niel, greatly bored with the notes he was copying, was trying\r\nto invent an excuse for getting out on the street, when he became aware\r\nof light footsteps coming rapidly down the outside corridor. The door of\r\nthe front office opened, he heard his uncle rise quickly to his feet,\r\nand, at the same moment, heard a woman\'s laugh,--a soft, musical laugh\r\nwhich rose and descended like a suave scale. He turned in his screw\r\nchair so that he could look over his shoulder through the double doors\r\ninto the front room. Mrs. Forrester stood there, shaking her muff at the\r\nJudge and the bewildered Swede farmer. Her quick eye lighted upon a\r\nbottle of Bourbon and two glasses on the desk among the papers.\r\n\r\n"Is that the way you prepare your cases, Judge? What an example for\r\nNiel!" She peeped through the door and nodded to the boy as he rose.\r\n\r\nHe remained in the back room, however, watching her while she declined\r\nthe chair the Judge pushed toward her and made a sign of refusal when he\r\npolitely pointed to the Bourbon. She stood beside his desk in her long\r\nsealskin coat and cap, a crimson scarf showing above the collar, a\r\nlittle brown veil with spots tied over her eyes. The veil did not in the\r\nleast obscure those beautiful eyes, dark and full of light, set under a\r\nlow white forehead and arching eyebrows. The frosty air had brought no\r\ncolour to her cheeks,--her skin had always the fragrant, crystalline\r\nwhiteness of white lilacs. Mrs. Forrester looked at one, and one knew\r\nthat she was bewitching. It was instantaneous, and it pierced the\r\nthickest hide. The Swede farmer was now grinning from ear to ear, and\r\nhe, too, had shuffled to his feet. There could be no negative encounter,\r\nhowever slight, with Mrs. Forrester. If she merely bowed to you, merely\r\nlooked at you, it constituted a personal relation. Something about her\r\ntook hold of one in a flash; one became acutely conscious of her, of her\r\nfragility and grace, of her mouth which could say so much without words;\r\nof her eyes, lively, laughing, intimate, nearly always a little mocking.\r\n\r\n"Will you and Niel dine with us tomorrow evening, Judge? And will you\r\nlend me Tom? We\'ve just had a wire. The Ogdens are stopping over with\r\nus. They\'ve been East to bring the girl home from school,--she\'s had\r\nmumps or something. They want to get home for Christmas, but they will\r\nstop off for two days. Probably Frank Ellinger will come on from\r\nDenver."\r\n\r\n"No prospect can afford me such pleasure as that of dining with Mrs.\r\nForrester," said the Judge ponderously.\r\n\r\n"Thank you!" she bowed playfully and turned toward the double doors.\r\n"Niel, could you leave your work long enough to drive me home? Mr.\r\nForrester has been detained at the bank."\r\n\r\nNiel put on his wolfskin coat. Mrs. Forrester took him by his shaggy\r\nsleeve and went with him quickly down the long corridor and the narrow\r\nstairs to the street.\r\n\r\nAt the hitch-bar stood her cutter, looking like a painted toy among the\r\ncountry sleds and wagons. Niel tucked the buffalo robes about Mrs.\r\nForrester, untied the ponies, and sprang in beside her. Without\r\ndirection the team started down the frozen main street, where few people\r\nwere abroad, crossed the creek on the ice, and trotted up the\r\npoplar-bordered lane toward the house on the hill. The late afternoon\r\nsun burned on the snow-crusted pastures. The poplars looked very tall\r\nand straight, pinched up and severe in their winter poverty. Mrs.\r\nForrester chatted to Niel with her face turned toward him, holding her\r\nmull up to break the wind.\r\n\r\n"I\'m counting on you to help me entertain Constance Ogden. Can you take\r\nher off my hands day after tomorrow, come over in the afternoon? Your\r\nduties as a lawyer aren\'t very arduous yet?" She smiled teasingly. "What\r\ncan I do with a miss of nineteen? one who goes to college? I\'ve no\r\nlearned conversation for her!"\r\n\r\n"Surely I haven\'t!" Niel exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you\'re a boy! Perhaps you can interest her in lighter things.\r\nShe\'s considered pretty."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she is?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen her lately. She was striking,--china blue eyes and heaps\r\nof yellow hair, not exactly yellow,--what they call an ashen blond, I\r\nbelieve."\r\n\r\nNiel had noticed that in describing the charms of other women Mrs.\r\nForrester always made fun of them a little.\r\n\r\nThey drew up in front of the house. Ben Keezer came round from the\r\nkitchen to take the team.\r\n\r\n"You are to go back for Mr. Forrester at six, Ben. Niel, come in for a\r\nmoment and get warm." She drew him through the little storm entry, which\r\nprotected the front door in winter, into the hall. "Hang up your coat\r\nand come along." He followed her through the parlour into the\r\nsitting-room, where a little coal grate was burning under the black\r\nmantelpiece, and sat down in the big leather chair in which Captain\r\nForrester dozed after his mid-day meal. It was a rather dark room, with\r\nwalnut bookcases that had carved tops and glass doors. The floor was\r\ncovered by a red carpet, and the walls were hung with large,\r\nold-fashioned engravings; "The House of the Poet on the Last Day of\r\nPompeii," "Shakespeare Reading before Queen Elizabeth."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester left him and presently returned carrying a tray with a\r\ndecanter and sherry glasses. She put it down on her husband\'s\r\nsmoking-table, poured out a glass for Niel and one for herself, and\r\nperched on the arm of one of the stuffed chairs, where she sat sipping\r\nher sherry and stretching her tiny, silver-buckled slippers out toward\r\nthe glowing coals.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so nice to have you staying on until after Christmas," Niel\r\nobserved, "You\'ve only been here one other Christmas since I can\r\nremember."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid we\'re staying on all winter this year. Mr. Forrester thinks\r\nwe can\'t afford to go away. For some reason, we are extraordinarily poor\r\njust now."\r\n\r\n"Like everybody else," the boy commented grimly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, like everybody else. However, it does no good to be glum about it,\r\ndoes it?" She refilled the two glasses. "I always take a little sherry\r\nat this time in the afternoon. At Colorado Springs some of my friends\r\ntake tea, like the English. But I should feel like an old woman,\r\ndrinking teal Besides, sherry is good for my throat." Niel remembered\r\nsome legend about a weak chest and occasional terrifying hemorrhages.\r\nBut that seemed doubtful, as one looked at her,--fragile, indeed, but\r\nwith such light, effervescing vitality. "Perhaps I do seem old to you,\r\nNiel, quite old enough for tea and a cap!"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gravely. "You seem always the same to me, Mrs. Forrester."\r\n\r\n"Yes? And how is that?"\r\n\r\n"Lovely. Just lovely."\r\n\r\nAs she bent forward to put down her glass she patted his cheek. "Oh,\r\nyou\'ll do very well for Constance!" Then, seriously, "I\'m glad if I do,\r\nthough. I want you to like me well enough to come to see us often this\r\nwinter. You shall come with your uncle to make a fourth at whist. Mr.\r\nForrester must have his whist in the evening. Do you think he is looking\r\nany worse, Niel? It frightens me to see him getting a little uncertain.\r\nBut there, we must believe in good luck!" She took up the half-empty\r\nglass and held it against the light.\r\n\r\nNiel liked to see the firelight sparkle on her earrings, long pendants\r\nof garnets and seed-pearls in the shape of fleurs-de-lys. She was the\r\nonly woman he knew who wore earrings; they hung naturally against her\r\nthin, triangular cheeks. Captain Forrester, although he had given her\r\nhandsomer ones, liked to see her wear these, because they had been his\r\nmother\'s. It gratified him to have his wife wear jewels; it meant\r\nsomething to him. She never left off her beautiful rings unless she was\r\nin the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"A winter in the country may do him good," said Mrs. Forrester, after a\r\nsilence during which she looked intently into the fire, as if she were\r\ntrying to read the outcome of their difficulties there. "He loves this\r\nplace so much. But you and Judge Pommeroy must keep an eye on him; when\r\nhe is in town, Niel. If he looks tired or uncertain, make some excuse\r\nand bring him home. He can\'t carry a drink or two as he used,"--she\r\nglanced over her shoulder to see that the door into the dining-room was\r\nshut. "Once last winter he had been drinking with some old friends at\r\nthe Antlers,--nothing unusual, just as he always did, as a man must be\r\nable to do,--but it was too much for him. When he came out to join me in\r\nthe carriage, coming down that long walk, you know, he fell. There was\r\nno ice, he didn\'t slip. It was simply because he was unsteady. He had\r\ntrouble getting up. I still shiver to think of it. To me, it was as if\r\none of the mountains had fallen down."\r\n\r\nA little later Niel went plunging down the hill, looking exultantly into\r\nthe streak of red sunset. Oh, the winter would not be so bad, this year!\r\nHow strange that she should be here at all, a woman like her among\r\ncommon people! Not even in Denver had he ever seen another woman so\r\nelegant. He had sat in the dining-room of the Brown Palace hotel and\r\nwatched them as they came down to dinner,--fashionable women from "the\r\nEast," on their way to California. But he had never found one so\r\nattractive and distinguished as Mrs. Forrester. Compared with her, other\r\nwomen were heavy and dull; even the pretty ones seemed lifeless,--they\r\nhad not that something in their glance that made one\'s blood tingle. And\r\nnever elsewhere had he heard anything like her inviting, musical laugh,\r\nthat was like the distant measures of dance music, heard through opening\r\nand shutting doors.\r\n\r\nHe could remember the very first time he ever saw Mrs. Forrester, when\r\nhe was a little boy. He had been loitering in front of the Episcopal\r\nchurch one Sunday morning, when a low carriage drove up to the door. Ben\r\nKeezer was on the front seat, and on the back seat was a lady, alone, in\r\na black silk dress all puffs and ruffles, and a black hat, carrying a\r\nparasol with a carved ivory handle. As the carriage stopped she lifted\r\nher dress to alight; out of a swirl of foamy white petticoats she thrust\r\na black, shiny slipper. She stepped lightly to the ground and with a nod\r\nto the driver went into the church. The little boy followed her through\r\nthe open door, saw her enter a pew and kneel. He was proud now that at\r\nthe first moment he had recognized her as belonging to a different world\r\nfrom any he had ever known.\r\n\r\nNiel paused for a moment at the end of the lane to look up at the last\r\nskeleton poplar in the long row; just above its pointed tip hung the\r\nhollow, silver winter moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn pleasant weather Judge Pommeroy walked to the Forresters\', but on the\r\noccasion of the dinner for the Ogdens he engaged the liveryman to take\r\nhim and his nephew over in one of the town hacks,--vehicles seldom used\r\nexcept for funerals and weddings. They smelled strongly of the stable\r\nand contained lap-robes as heavy as lead and as slippery as oiled paper.\r\nNiel and his uncle were the only townspeople asked to the Forresters\'\r\nthat evening; they rolled over the creek and up the hill in state, and\r\nemerged covered with horsehair.\r\n\r\nCaptain Forrester met them at the door, his burly figure buttoned up in\r\na frock coat, a flat collar and black string tie under the heavy folds\r\nof his neck. He was always clean-shaven except for a drooping\r\ndun-coloured moustache. The company stood behind him laughing while Niel\r\ncaught up the whisk-broom and began dusting roan hairs off his uncle\'s\r\nbroadcloth. Mrs. Forrester gave Niel a brushing in turn and then took\r\nhim into the parlour and introduced him to Mrs. Ogden and her daughter.\r\n\r\nThe daughter was a rather pretty girl, Niel thought, in a pale pink\r\nevening dress which left bare her smooth arms and short, dimpled neck.\r\nHer eyes were, as Mrs. Forrester had said, a china blue, rather\r\nprominent and inexpressive. Her fleece of ashy-gold hair was bound about\r\nher head with silver bands. In spite of her fresh, rose-like complexion,\r\nher face was not altogether agreeable. Two dissatisfied lines reached\r\nfrom the corners of her short nose to the corners of her mouth. When she\r\nwas displeased, even a little, these lines tightened, drew her nose\r\nback, and gave her a suspicious, injured expression. Niel sat down by\r\nher and did his best, but he found her hard to talk to. She seemed\r\nnervous and distracted, kept glancing over her shoulder, and crushing\r\nher handkerchief up in her hands. Her mind, clearly, was elsewhere.\r\nAfter a few moments he turned to the mother, who was more easily\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ogden was almost unpardonably homely. She had a pear-shaped face,\r\nand across her high forehead lay a row of flat, dry curls. Her bluish\r\nbrown skin was almost the colour of her violet dinner dress. A diamond\r\nnecklace glittered about her wrinkled throat. Unlike Constance, she\r\nseemed thoroughly amiable, but as she talked she tilted her head and\r\n"used" her eyes, availing herself of those arch glances which he had\r\nsupposed only pretty women indulged in. Probably she had long been\r\nsurrounded by people to whom she was an important personage, and had\r\nacquired the manner of a spoiled darling. Niel thought her rather\r\nfoolish at first, but in a few moments he had got used to her mannerisms\r\nand began to like her. He found himself laughing heartily and forgot the\r\ndiscouragement of his failure with the daughter.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden, a short, weather-beaten man of fifty, with a cast in one eye,\r\na stiff imperial, and twisted moustaches, was noticeably quieter and\r\nless expansive than when Niel had met him here on former occasions. He\r\nseemed to expect his wife to do the talking. When Mrs. Forrester\r\naddressed him, or passed near him, his good eye twinkled and followed\r\nher,--while the eye that looked askance remained unchanged and committed\r\nitself to nothing.\r\n\r\nSuddenly everyone became more lively; the air warmed, and the lamplight\r\nseemed to brighten, as a fourth member of the Denver party came in from\r\nthe dining-room with a glittering tray full of cocktails he had been\r\nmaking. Frank Ellinger was a bachelor of forty, six feet two, with long\r\nstraight legs, fine shoulders, and a figure that still permitted his\r\nwhite waistcoat to button without a wrinkle under his conspicuously\r\nwell-cut dinner coat. His black hair, coarse and curly as the filling of\r\na mattress, was grey about the ears, his florid face showed little\r\npurple veins about his beaked nose,--a nose like the prow of a ship,\r\nwith long nostrils. His chin was deeply cleft, his thick curly lips\r\nseemed very muscular, very much under his control, and, with his strong\r\nwhite teeth, irregular and curved, gave him the look of a man who could\r\nbite an iron rod in two with a snap of his jaws. His whole figure seemed\r\nvery much alive under his clothes, with a restless, muscular energy that\r\nhad something of the cruelty of wild animals in it. Niel was very much\r\ninterested in this man, the hero of many ambiguous stories. He didn\'t\r\nknow whether he liked him or not. He knew nothing bad about him, but he\r\nfelt something evil.\r\n\r\nThe cocktails were the signal for general conversation, the company drew\r\ntogether in one group. Even Miss Constance seemed less dissatisfied.\r\nEllinger drank his cocktail standing beside her chair, and offered her\r\nthe cherry in his glass. They were old-fashioned whiskey cocktails.\r\nNobody drank Martinis then; gin was supposed to be the consolation of\r\nsailors and inebriate scrub-women.\r\n\r\n"Very good, Frank, very good," Captain Forrester pronounced, drawing out\r\na fresh, cologne-scented handkerchief to wipe his moustache. "Are\r\nencores in order?" The Captain puffed slightly when he talked. His eyes,\r\nalways somewhat suffused and bloodshot since his injury, blinked at his\r\nfriends from under his heavy lids.\r\n\r\n"One more round for everybody, Captain." Ellinger brought in from the\r\nsideboard a capacious shaker and refilled all the glasses except Miss\r\nOgden\'s. At her he shook his finger, and offered her the little dish of\r\nMaraschino cherries.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t want those. I want the one in your glass," she said with a\r\npouty smile. "I like it to taste of something!"\r\n\r\n"Constance!" said her mother reprovingly, rolling her eyes at Mrs.\r\nForrester, as if to share with her the charm of such innocence.\r\n\r\n"Niel," Mrs. Forrester laughed, "won\'t you give the child your cherry,\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\nNiel promptly crossed the room and proffered the cherry in the bottom of\r\nhis glass. She took it with her thumb and fore-finger and dropped it\r\ninto her own,--where, he was quick to observe, she left it when they\r\nwent out to dinner. A stubborn piece of pink flesh, he decided, and\r\ncertainly a fool about a man quite old enough to be her father. He\r\nsighed when he saw that he was placed next her at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nCaptain Forrester still made a commanding figure at the head of his own\r\ntable, with his napkin tucked under his chin and the work of carving\r\nwell in hand. Nobody could lay bare the bones of a brace of duck or a\r\ntwenty-pound turkey more deftly. "What part of the turkey do you prefer,\r\nMrs. Ogden?" If one had a preference, it was gratified, with all the\r\nstuffing and gravy that went with it, and the vegetables properly\r\nplaced. When a plate left Captain Forrester\'s hands, it was a dinner;\r\nthe recipient was served, and well served. He served Mrs. Forrester last\r\nof the ladies but before the men, and to her, too, he said, "Mrs.\r\nForrester, what part of the turkey shall I give you this evening?" He\r\nwas a man who did not vary his formulae or his manners. He was no more\r\nmobile than his countenance. Niel and Judge Pommeroy had often remarked\r\nhow much Captain Forrester looked like the pictures of Grover Cleveland.\r\nHis clumsy dignity covered a deep nature, and a conscience that had\r\nnever been juggled with. His repose was like that of a mountain. When he\r\nlaid his fleshy, thick-fingered hand upon a frantic horse, an hysterical\r\nwoman, an Irish workman out for blood, he brought them peace; something\r\nthey could not resist. That had been the secret of his management of\r\nmen. His sanity asked nothing, claimed nothing; it was so simple that it\r\nbrought a hush over distracted creatures. In the old days, when he was\r\nbuilding road in the Black Hills, trouble sometimes broke out in camp\r\nwhen he was absent, staying with Mrs. Forrester at Colorado Springs. He\r\nwould put down the telegram that announced an insurrection and say to\r\nhis wife, "Maidy, I must go to the men." And that was all he did,--he\r\nwent to them.\r\n\r\nWhile the Captain was intent upon his duties as host he talked very\r\nlittle, and Judge Pommeroy and Ellinger kept a lively cross-fire of\r\namusing stories going. Niel, sitting opposite Ellinger, watched him\r\nclosely. He still couldn\'t decide whether he liked him or not. In Denver\r\nFrank was known as a prince of good fellows; tactful, generous,\r\nresourceful, though apt to trim his sails to the wind; a man who\r\ngood-humouredly bowed to the inevitable, or to the almost-inevitable. He\r\nhad, when he was younger, been notoriously "wild," but that was not held\r\nagainst him, even by mothers with marriageable daughters, like Mrs.\r\nOgden. Morals were different in those days. Niel had heard his uncle\r\nrefer to Ellinger\'s youthful infatuation with a woman called Nell\r\nEmerald, a handsome and rather unusual woman who conducted a house\r\nproperly licensed by the Denver police. Nell Emerald had told an old\r\nclub man that though she had been out behind young Ellinger\'s new\r\ntrotting horse, she "had no respect for a man who would go driving with\r\na prostitute in broad daylight." This story and a dozen like it were\r\noften related of Ellinger, and the women laughed over them as heartily\r\nas the men. All the while that he was making a scandalous chronicle for\r\nhimself, young Ellinger had been devotedly caring for an invalid mother,\r\nand he was described to strangers as a terribly fast young man and a\r\nmodel son. That combination pleased the taste of the time. Nobody\r\nthought the worse of him. Now that his mother was dead, he lived at the\r\nBrown Palace hotel, though he still kept her house at Colorado Springs.\r\n\r\nWhen the roast was well under way, Black Tom, very formal in a white\r\nwaistcoat and high collar, poured the champagne. Captain Forrester\r\nlifted his glass, the frail stem between his thick fingers, and glancing\r\nround the table at his guests and at Mrs. Forrester, said:\r\n\r\n"Happy days!"\r\n\r\nIt was the toast he always drank at dinner, the invocation he was sure\r\nto utter when he took a glass of whiskey with an old friend. Whoever had\r\nheard him say it once, liked to hear him say it again. Nobody else could\r\nutter those two words as he did, with such gravity and high courtesy. It\r\nseemed a solemn moment, seemed to knock at the door of Fate; behind\r\nwhich all days, happy and otherwise, were hidden. Niel drank his wine\r\nwith a pleasant shiver, thinking that nothing else made life seem so\r\nprecarious, the future so cryptic and unfathomable, as that brief toast\r\nuttered by the massive man, "Happy days!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ogden turned to the host with her most languishing smile: "Captain\r\nForrester, I want you to tell Constance"-- (She was an East Virginia\r\nwoman, and what she really said was, "Cap\'n Forrester, Ah wan\' yew to\r\ntell, etc." Her vowels seemed to roll about in the same way her eyes\r\ndid.)--"I want you to tell Constance about how you first found this\r\nlovely spot, \'way back in Indian times."\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked down the table between the candles at Mrs. Forrester,\r\nas if to consult her. She smiled and nodded, and her beautiful earrings\r\nswung beside her pale cheeks. She was wearing her diamonds tonight, and\r\na black velvet gown. Her husband had archaic ideas about jewels; a man\r\nbought them for his wife in acknowledgment of things he could not\r\ngracefully utter. They must be costly; they must show that he was able\r\nto buy them, and that she was worthy to wear them.\r\n\r\nWith her approval the Captain began his narrative: a concise account of\r\nhow he came West a young boy, after serving in the Civil War, and took a\r\njob as driver for a freighting company that carried supplies across the\r\nplains from Nebraska City to Cherry Creek, as Denver was then called.\r\nThe freighters, after embarking in that sea of grass six hundred miles\r\nin width, lost all count of the days of the week and the month. One day\r\nwas like another, and all were glorious; good hunting, plenty of\r\nantelope and buffalo, boundless sunny sky, boundless plains of waving\r\ngrass, long fresh-water lagoons yellow with lagoon flowers, where the\r\nbison in their periodic migrations stopped to drink and bathe and\r\nwallow.\r\n\r\n"An ideal life for a young man," the Captain pronounced. Once, when he\r\nwas driven out of the trail by a wash-out, he rode south on his horse to\r\nexplore, and found an Indian encampment near the Sweet Water, on this\r\nvery hill where his house now stood. He was, he said, "greatly taken\r\nwith the location," and made up his mind that he would one day have a\r\nhouse there. He cut down a young willow tree and drove the stake into\r\nthe ground to mark the spot where he wished to build. He went away and\r\ndid not come back for many years; he was helping to lay the first\r\nrailroad across the plains.\r\n\r\n"There were those that were dependent on me," he said. "I had sickness\r\nto contend with, and responsibilities. But in all those years I expect\r\nthere was hardly a day passed that I did not remember the Sweet Water\r\nand this hill. When I came here a young man, I had planned it in my\r\nmind, pretty much as it is to-day; where I would dig my well, and where\r\nI would plant my grove and my orchard. I planned to build a house that\r\nmy friends could come to, with a wife like Mrs. Forrester to make it\r\nattractive to them. I used to promise myself that some day I would\r\nmanage it." This part of the story the Captain told not with\r\nembarrassment, but with reserve, choosing his words slowly, absently\r\ncracking English walnuts with his strong fingers and heaping a little\r\nhoard of kernels beside his plate. His friends understood that he was\r\nreferring to his first marriage, to the poor invalid wife who had never\r\nbeen happy and who had kept his nose to the grindstone.\r\n\r\n"When things looked most discouraging," he went on, "I came back here\r\nonce and bought the place from the railroad company. They took my note.\r\nI found my willow stake,--it had rooted and grown into a tree,--and I\r\nplanted three more to mark the corners of my house. Twelve years later\r\nMrs. Forrester came here with me, shortly after our marriage, and we\r\nbuilt our house." Captain Forrester puffed from time to time, but his\r\nclear account commanded attention. Something in the way he uttered his\r\nunornamented phrases gave them the impressiveness of inscriptions cut in\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester nodded at him from her end of the table. "And now, tell\r\nus your philosophy of life,--this is where it comes in," she laughed\r\nteasingly.\r\n\r\nThe Captain coughed and looked abashed. "I was intending to omit that\r\ntonight. Some of our guests have already heard it."\r\n\r\n"No, no. It belongs at the end of the story, and if some of us have\r\nheard it, we can hear it again. Go on!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, my philosophy is that what you think of and plan for day by\r\nday, in spite of yourself, so to speak--you will get. You will get it\r\nmore or less. That is, unless you are one of the people who get nothing\r\nin this world. There are such people. I have lived too much in mining\r\nworks and construction camps not to know that." He paused as if, though\r\nthis was too dark a chapter to be gone into, it must have its place, its\r\nmoment of silent recognition. "If you are not one of those, Constance\r\nand Niel, you will accomplish what you dream of most."\r\n\r\n"And why? That\'s the interesting part of it," his wife prompted him.\r\n\r\n"Because," he roused himself from his abstraction and looked about at\r\nthe company, "because a thing that is dreamed of in the way I mean, is\r\nalready an accomplished fact. All our great West has been developed from\r\nsuch dreams; the homesteader\'s and the prospector\'s and the\r\ncontractor\'s. We dreamed the railroads across the mountains, just as I\r\ndreamed my place on the Sweet Water. All these things will be everyday\r\nfacts to the coming generation, but to us--" Captain Forrester ended\r\nwith a sort of grunt. Something forbidding had come into his voice, the\r\nlonely, defiant note that is so often heard in the voices of old\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ogden had listened to the story with such sympathy that Niel liked\r\nher better than ever, and even the preoccupied Constance seemed able to\r\ngive it her attention. They rose from the dessert and went into the\r\nparlour to arrange the card tables. The Captain still played whist as\r\nwell as ever. As he brought out a box of his best cigars, he paused\r\nbefore Mrs. Ogden and said, "Is smoke offensive to you, Mrs. Ogden?"\r\nWhen she protested that it was not, he crossed the room to where\r\nConstance was talking with Ellinger and asked with the same grave\r\ncourtesy, "Is smoke offensive to you, Constance?" Had there been half a\r\ndozen women present, he would have asked that question of each,\r\nprobably, and in the same words. It did not bother him to repeat a\r\nphrase. If an expression answered his purpose, he saw no reason for\r\nvarying it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester and Mr. Ogden were to play against Mrs. Ogden and the\r\nCaptain. "Constance," said Mrs. Forrester as she sat down, "will you\r\nplay with Niel? I\'m told he\'s very good."\r\n\r\nMiss Ogden\'s short nose flickered up, the lines on either side of it\r\ndeepened, and she again looked injured. Niel was sure she detested him.\r\nHe was not going to be done in by her.\r\n\r\n"Miss Ogden," he said as he stood beside his chair, deliberately\r\nshuffling a pack of cards, "my uncle and I are used to playing together,\r\nand probably you are used to playing with Mr. Ellinger. Suppose we try\r\nthat combination?"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a quick, suspicious glance from under her yellow eyelashes\r\nand flung herself into a chair without so much as answering him. Frank\r\nEllinger came in from the dining-room, where he had been sampling the\r\nCaptain\'s French brandy, and took the vacant seat opposite Miss Ogden.\r\n"So it\'s you and me, Connie? Good enough!" he exclaimed, cutting the\r\npack Niel pushed toward him.\r\n\r\nJust before midnight Black Tom opened the door and announced that the\r\negg-nog was ready. The card players went into the dining-room, where the\r\npunch-bowl stood smoking on the table.\r\n\r\n"Constance," said Captain Forrester, "do you sing? I like to hear one of\r\nthe old songs with the egg-nog."\r\n\r\n"Ah\'m sorry, Cap\'n Forrester. Ah really haven\'t any voice."\r\n\r\nNiel noticed that whenever Constance spoke to the Captain she strained\r\nher throat, though he wasn\'t in the least deaf. He broke in over her\r\nrefusal. "Uncle can start a song if you coax him, sir."\r\n\r\nJudge Pommeroy, after smoothing his silver whiskers and coughing, began\r\n"Auld Lang Syne." The others joined in, but they hadn\'t got to the end\r\nof it when a hollow rumbling down on the bridge made them laugh, and\r\neveryone ran to the front windows to see the Judge\'s funeral coach come\r\nlurching up the hill, with only one of the side lanterns lit. Mrs.\r\nForrester sent Tom out with a drink for the driver. While Niel and his\r\nuncle were putting on their overcoats in the hall, she came up to them\r\nand whispered coaxingly to the boy, "Remember, you are coming over\r\ntomorrow, at two? I am planning a drive, and I want you to amuse\r\nConstance for me."\r\n\r\nNiel bit his lip and looked down into Mrs. Forrester\'s laughing,\r\npersuasive eyes. "I\'ll do it for you, but that\'s the only reason," he\r\nsaid threateningly.\r\n\r\n"I understand, for me! I\'ll credit it to your account."\r\n\r\nThe Judge and his nephew rolled away on swaying springs. The Ogdens\r\nretired to their rooms upstairs. Mrs. Forrester went to help the Captain\r\ndivest himself of his frock coat, and put it away for him. Ever since he\r\nwas hurt he had to be propped high on pillows at night, and he slept in\r\na narrow iron bed, in the alcove which had formerly been his wife\'s\r\ndressing-room. While he was undressing he breathed heavily and sighed,\r\nas if he were very tired. He fumbled with his studs, then blew on his\r\nfingers and tried again. His wife came to his aid and quickly unbuttoned\r\neverything. He did not thank her in words, but submitted gratefully.\r\n\r\nWhen the iron bed creaked at receiving his heavy figure, she called from\r\nthe big bedroom, "Good-night, Mr. Forrester," and drew the heavy\r\ncurtains that shut off the alcove. She took off her rings and earrings\r\nand was beginning to unfasten her black velvet bodice when, at a tinkle\r\nof glass from without, she stopped short. Re-hooking the shoulder of her\r\ngown, she went to the dining-room, now faintly lit by the coal fire in\r\nthe back parlour. Frank Ellinger was standing at the sideboard, taking a\r\nnightcap. The Forrester French brandy was old, and heavy like a cordial.\r\n\r\n"Be careful," she murmured as she approached him, "I have a distinct\r\nimpression that there is some one on the enclosed stairway. There is a\r\nwide crack in the door. Ah, but kittens have claws, these days! Pour me\r\njust a little. Thank you. I\'ll have mine in by the fire."\r\n\r\nHe followed her into the next room, where she stood by the grate,\r\nlooking at him in the light of the pale blue flames that ran over the\r\nfresh coal, put on to keep the fire.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve had a good many brandies, Frank," she said, studying his\r\nflushed, masterful face.\r\n\r\n"Not too many. I\'ll need them . . . tonight," he replied meaningly.\r\n\r\nShe nervously brushed back a lock of hair that had come down a little.\r\n"It\'s not tonight. It\'s morning. Go to bed and sleep as late as you\r\nplease. Take care, I heard silk stockings on the stairs. Good-night."\r\nShe put her hand on the sleeve of his coat; the white fingers clung to\r\nthe black cloth as bits of paper cling to magnetized iron. Her touch,\r\nsoft as it was, went through the man, all the feet and inches of him.\r\nHis broad shoulders lifted on a deep breath. He looked down at her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes fell. "Good-night," she said faintly. As she turned quickly\r\naway, the train of her velvet dress caught the leg of his broadcloth\r\ntrousers and dragged with a friction that crackled and threw sparks.\r\nBoth started. They stood looking at each other for a moment before she\r\nactually slipped through the door. Ellinger remained by the hearth, his\r\narms folded tight over his chest, his curly lips compressed, frowning\r\ninto the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nNiel went up the hill the next afternoon, just as the cutter with the\r\ntwo black ponies jingled round the driveway and stopped at the front\r\ndoor. Mrs. Forrester came out on the porch, dressed for a sleigh ride.\r\nEllinger followed her, buttoned up in a long fur-lined coat, showily\r\nbefrogged down the front, with a glossy astrachan collar. He looked even\r\nmore powerful and bursting with vigour than last night. His\r\nhighly-coloured, well-visored countenance shone with a good opinion of\r\nhimself and of the world.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester called to Niel gaily. "We are going down to the Sweet\r\nWater to cut cedar boughs for Christmas. Will you keep Constance\r\ncompany? She seems a trifle disappointed at being left behind, but we\r\ncan\'t take the big sleigh,--the pole is broken. Be nice to her, there\'s\r\na good boy!" She pressed his hand, gave him a meaning, confidential\r\nsmile, and stepped into the sleigh. Ellinger sprang in beside her, and\r\nthey glided down the hill with a merry tinkle of sleighbells.\r\n\r\nNiel found Miss Ogden in the back parlour, playing solitaire by the\r\nfire. She was clearly out of humour.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mr. Herbert. I think they might have taken us along, don\'t\r\nyou? I want to see the river my own self. I hate bein\' shut up in the\r\nhouse!"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go out, then. Wouldn\'t you like to see the town?"\r\n\r\nConstance seemed not to hear him. She was wrinkling and unwrinkling her\r\nshort nose, and the restless lines about her mouth were fluttering.\r\n"What\'s to hinder us from getting a sleigh at the livery barn and going\r\ndown to the Sweet Water? I don\'t suppose the river\'s private property?"\r\nShe gave a nervous, angry laugh and looked hopefully at Niel.\r\n\r\n"We couldn\'t get anything at this hour. The livery teams are all out,"\r\nhe said with firmness.\r\n\r\nConstance glanced at him suspiciously, then sat down at the card table\r\nand leaned over it, drawing her plump shoulders together. Her fluffy\r\nyellow hair was wound round her head like a scarf and held in place by\r\nnarrow bands of black velvet.\r\n\r\nThe ponies had crossed the second creek and were trotting down the high\r\nroad toward the river. Mrs. Forrester expressed her feelings in a laugh\r\nfull of mischief. "Is she running after us? Where did she get the idea\r\nthat she was to come? What a relief to get away!" She lifted her chin\r\nand sniffed the air. The day was grey, without sun, and the air was\r\nstill and dry, a warm cold. "Poor Mr. Ogden," she went on, "how much\r\nlivelier he is without his ladies! They almost extinguish him. Now\r\naren\'t you glad you never married?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m certainly glad I never married a homely woman. What does a man do\r\nit for, anyway? She had no money,--and he\'s always had it, or been on\r\nthe way to it."\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'re off tomorrow. And Connie! You\'ve reduced her to a state\r\nof imbecility, really! What an afternoon Niel must be having!" She\r\nlaughed as if the idea of his predicament delighted her.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this kid, anyway?" Ellinger asked her to take the reins for a\r\nmoment while he drew a cigar from his pocket. "He\'s a trifle stiff. Does\r\nhe make himself useful?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a nice boy, stranded here like the rest of us. I\'m going to\r\ntrain him to be very useful. He\'s devoted to Mr. Forrester. Handsome,\r\ndon\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"So-so." They turned into a by-road that wound along the Sweet Water.\r\nEllinger held the ponies in a little and turned down his high astrachan\r\ncollar. "Let\'s have a look at you, Marian."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester was holding her muff before her face, to catch the flying\r\nparticles of snow the ponies kicked up. From behind it she glanced at\r\nhim sidewise. "Well?" she said teasingly.\r\n\r\nHe put his arm through hers and settled himself low in the sleigh. "You\r\nought to look at me better than that. It\'s been a devil of a long while\r\nsince I\'ve seen you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s been too long," she murmured. The mocking spark in her\r\neyes softened perceptibly under the long pressure of his arm. "Yes, it\'s\r\nbeen long," she admitted lightly.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t answer the letter I wrote you on the eleventh."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I? Well, at any rate I answered your telegram." She drew her\r\nhead away as his face came nearer. "You\'ll really have to watch the\r\nponies, my dear, or they\'ll tumble us out in the snow."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. I wish they would!" he said between his teeth. "Why\r\ndidn\'t you answer my letter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t remember! You don\'t write so many."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no satisfaction. You won\'t let me write you love letters. You say\r\nit\'s risky."\r\n\r\n"So it is, and foolish. But now you needn\'t be so careful. Not too\r\ncareful!" she laughed softly. "When I\'m off in the country for a whole\r\nwinter, alone, and growing older, I like to . . ." she put her hand on\r\nhis, "to be reminded of pleasanter things."\r\n\r\nEllinger took off his glove with his teeth. His eyes, sweeping the\r\nwinding road and the low, snow-covered bluffs, had something wolfish in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Be careful, Frank. My rings! You hurt me!"\r\n\r\n"Then why didn\'t you take them off? You used to. Are these your cedars,\r\nshall we stop here?"\r\n\r\n"No, not here." She spoke very low. "The best ones are farther on, in a\r\ndeep ravine that winds back into the hills."\r\n\r\nEllinger glanced at her averted head, and his heavy lips twitched in a\r\nsmile at one corner. The quality of her voice had changed, and he knew\r\nthe change. They went spinning along the curves of the winding road,\r\nsaying not a word. Mrs. Forrester sat with her head bent forward, her\r\nface half hidden in her muff. At last she told him to stop. To the right\r\nof the road he saw a thicket. Behind it a dry watercourse wound into the\r\nbluffs. The tops of the dark, still cedars, just visible from the road,\r\nindicated its windings.\r\n\r\n"Sit still," he said, "while I take out the horses."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the blue shadows of approaching dusk were beginning to fall over\r\nthe snow, one of the Blum boys, slipping quietly along through the\r\ntimber in search of rabbits, came upon the empty cutter standing in the\r\nbrush, and near it the two ponies, stamping impatiently where they were\r\ntied. Adolph slid bade into the thicket and lay down behind a fallen log\r\nto see what would happen. Not much ever happened to him but weather.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard low voices, coming nearer from the ravine. The big\r\nstranger who was visiting at the Forresters\' emerged, carrying the\r\nbuffalo robes on one arm; Mrs. Forrester herself was clinging to the\r\nother. They walked slowly, wholly absorbed by what they were saying to\r\neach other. When they came up to the sleigh, the man spread the robes on\r\nthe seat and put his hands under Mrs. Forrester\'s arms to lift her in.\r\nBut he did not lift her; he stood for a long while holding her crushed\r\nup against his breast, her face hidden in his black overcoat.\r\n\r\n"What about those damned cedar boughs?" he asked, after he had put her\r\nin and covered her up. "Shall I go back and cut some?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter," she murmured.\r\n\r\nHe reached under the seat for a hatchet and went back to the ravine.\r\nMrs. Forrester sat with her eyes closed, her cheek pillowed on her muff,\r\na faint, soft smile on her lips. The air was still and blue; the Blum\r\nboy could almost hear her breathe. When the strokes of the hatchet rang\r\nout from the ravine, he could see her eyelids flutter . . . soft shivers\r\nwent through her body.\r\n\r\nThe man came back and threw the evergreens into the sleigh. When he got\r\nin beside her, she slipped her hand through his arm and settled softly\r\nagainst him. "Drive slowly," she murmured, as if she were talking in her\r\nsleep. "It doesn\'t matter if we are late for dinner. Nothing matters."\r\nThe ponies trotted off.\r\n\r\nThe pale Blum boy rose from behind his log and followed the tracks up\r\nthe ravine. When the orange moon rose over the bluffs, he was still\r\nsitting under the cedars, his gun on his knee. While Mrs. Forrester had\r\nbeen waiting there in the sleigh, with her eyes closed, feeling so safe,\r\nhe could almost have touched her with his hand. He had never seen her\r\nbefore when her mocking eyes and lively manner were not between her and\r\nall the world. If it had been Thad Grimes who lay behind that log, now,\r\nor Ivy Peters?\r\n\r\nBut with Adolph Blum her secrets were safe. His mind was feudal; the\r\nrich and fortunate were also the privileged. These warm-blooded,\r\nquick-breathing people took chances,--followed impulses only dimly\r\nunderstandable to a boy who was wet and weather-chapped all the year;\r\nwho waded in the mud fishing for cat, or lay in the marsh waiting for\r\nwild duck. Mrs. Forrester had never been too haughty to smile at him\r\nwhen he came to the back door with his fish. She never haggled about the\r\nprice. She treated him like a human being. His little chats with her,\r\nher nod and smile when she passed him on the street, were among the\r\npleasantest things he had to remember. She bought game of him in the\r\nclosed season, and didn\'t give him away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was during that winter, the first one Mrs. Forrester had ever spent\r\nin the house on the hill, that Niel came to know her very well. For the\r\nForresters that winter was a sort of isthmus between two estates; soon\r\nafterward came a change in their fortunes. And for Niel it was a natural\r\nturning-point, since in the autumn he was nineteen, and in the spring he\r\nwas twenty,--a very great difference.\r\n\r\nAfter the Christmas festivities were over, the whist parties settled\r\ninto a regular routine. Three evenings a week Judge Pommeroy and his\r\nnephew sat down to cards with the Forresters. Sometimes they went over\r\nearly and dined there. Sometimes they stayed for a late supper after the\r\nlast rubber. Niel, who had been so content with a bachelor\'s life, and\r\nwho had made up his mind that he would never live in a place that was\r\nunder the control of women, found himself becoming attached to the\r\ncomforts of a well-conducted house; to the pleasures of the table, to\r\nthe soft chairs and soft lights and agreeable human voices at the\r\nForresters\'. On bitter, windy nights, sitting in his favourite blue\r\nchair before the grate, he used to wonder how he could manage to tear\r\nhimself away, to plunge into the outer darkness, and run down the long\r\nfrozen road and up the dead street of the town. Captain Forrester was\r\nexperimenting with bulbs that winter, and had built a little glass\r\nconservatory on the south side of the house, off the back parlour.\r\nThrough January and February the house was full of narcissus and Roman\r\nhyacinths, and their heavy, spring-like odour made a part of the\r\nenticing comfort of the fireside there.\r\n\r\nWhere Mrs. Forrester was, dulness was impossible, Niel believed. The\r\ncharm of her conversation was not so much in what she said, though she\r\nwas often witty, but in the quick recognition of her eyes, in the living\r\nquality of her voice itself. One could talk with her about the most\r\ntrivial things, and go away with a high sense of elation. The secret of\r\nit, he supposed, was that she couldn\'t help being interested in people,\r\neven very commonplace people. If Mr. Ogden or Mr. Dalzell were not there\r\nto tell their best stories for her, then she could be amused by Ivy\r\nPeters\' ruffianly manners, or the soft compliments of old man Elliott\r\nwhen he sold her a pair of winter shoes. She had a fascinating gift of\r\nmimicry. When she mentioned the fat iceman, or Thad Grimes at his meat\r\nblock, or the Blum boys with their dead rabbits, by a subtle suggestion\r\nof their manner she made them seem more individual and vivid than they\r\nwere in their own person. She often caricatured people to their faces,\r\nand they were not offended, but greatly flattered. Nothing pleased one\r\nmore than to provoke her laughter. Then you felt you were getting on\r\nwith her. It was her form of commenting, of agreeing with you and\r\nappreciating you when you said something interesting,--and it often told\r\nyou a great deal that was both too direct and too elusive for words.\r\n\r\nLong, long afterward, when Niel did not know whether Mrs. Forrester were\r\nliving or dead, if her image flashed into his mind, it came with a\r\nbrightness of dark eyes, her pale triangular cheeks with long earrings,\r\nand her many-coloured laugh. When he was dull, dull and tired of\r\neverything, he used to think that if he could hear that long-lost lady\r\nlaugh again, he could be gay.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big storm of the winter came late that year; swept down over Sweet\r\nWater the first day of March and beat upon the town for three days and\r\nnights. Thirty inches of snow fell, and the cutting wind blew it into\r\nwhirling drifts. The Forresters were snowed in. Ben Keezer, their man of\r\nall work, did not attempt to break a road or even to come over to the\r\ntown himself. On the third day Niel went to the post-office, got the\r\nCaptain\'s leather mail sack with its accumulation of letters, and set\r\noff across the creek, plunging into drifts up to his middle, sometimes\r\nup to his arm-pits. The fences along the lane were covered, but he broke\r\nhis trail by keeping between the two lines of poplars. When at last he\r\nreached the front porch, Captain Forrester came to the door and let him\r\nin.\r\n\r\n"Glad to see you, my boy, very glad. It\'s been a little lonesome for us.\r\nYou must have had hard work getting over. I certainly appreciate it.\r\nCome to the sitting-room fire and dry yourself. We will talk quietly.\r\nMrs. Forrester has gone upstairs to lie down; she\'s been complaining of\r\na headache."\r\n\r\nNiel stood before the fire in his rubber boots, drying his trousers. The\r\nCaptain did not sit down but opened the glass door into his little\r\nconservatory.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve something pretty to show you, Niel. All my hyacinths are coming\r\nalong at once, every colour of the rainbow. The Roman hyacinths, I say,\r\nare Mrs. Forrester\'s. They seem to suit her."\r\n\r\nNiel went to the door and looked with keen pleasure at the fresh, watery\r\nblossoms. "I was afraid you might lose them this bitter weather,\r\nCaptain."\r\n\r\n"No, these things can stand a good deal of cold. They\'ve been company\r\nfor us." He stood looking out through the glass at the drifted\r\nshrubbery. Niel liked to see him look out over his place. A man\'s house\r\nis his castle, his look seemed to say. "Ben tells me the rabbits have\r\ncome up to the barn to eat the hay, everything green is covered up. I\r\nhad him throw a few cabbages out for them, so they won\'t suffer. Mrs.\r\nForrester has been on the porch every day, feeding the snow birds," he\r\nwent on, as if talking to himself.\r\n\r\nThe stair door opened, and Mrs. Forrester came down in her Japanese\r\ndressing-gown, looking very pale. The dark shadows under her eyes seemed\r\nto mean that she had been losing sleep.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s Niel! How nice of you. And you\'ve brought the mail. Are there\r\nany letters for me?"\r\n\r\n"Three. Two from Denver and one from California." Her husband gave them\r\nto her. "Did you sleep, Maidy?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I rested. It\'s delightful up in the west room, the wind sings\r\nand whistles about the eaves. If you\'ll excuse me, I\'ll dress and glance\r\nat my letters. Stand closer to the fire, Niel. Are you very wet?" When\r\nshe stopped beside him to feel his clothes, he smelled a sharp odour of\r\nspirits. Was she ill, he wondered, or merely so bored that she had been\r\ntrying to dull herself?\r\n\r\nWhen she came back she had dressed and re-arranged her hair.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Forrester," said the Captain in a solicitous tone, "I believe I\r\nwould like some tea and toast this afternoon, like your English friends,\r\nand it would be good for your head. We won\'t offer Niel anything else."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Mary has gone to bed with a toothache, but I will make the\r\ntea. Niel can make the toast here by the fire while you read your\r\npaper."\r\n\r\nShe was cheerful now,--tied one of Mary\'s aprons about Niel\'s neck and\r\nset him down with the toasting fork. He noticed that the Captain, as he\r\nread his paper, kept his eye on the sideboard with a certain\r\nwatchfulness, and when his wife brought the tray with tea, and no\r\nsherry, he seemed very much pleased. He drank three cups, and took a\r\nsecond piece of toast.\r\n\r\n"You see, Mr. Forrester," she said lightly, "Niel has brought back my\r\nappetite. I ate no lunch to-day," turning to the boy, "I\'ve been shut up\r\ntoo long. Is there anything in the papers?"\r\n\r\nThis meant was there any news concerning the people they knew. The\r\nCaptain put on his silver-rimmed glasses again and read aloud about the\r\ndoings of their friends in Denver and Omaha and Kansas City. Mrs.\r\nForrester sat on a stool by the fire, eating toast and making humorous\r\ncomments upon the subjects of those solemn paragraphs; the engagement of\r\nMiss Erma Salton-Smith, etc.\r\n\r\n"At last, thank God! You remember her, Niel. She\'s been here. I think\r\nyou danced with her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I do. What is she like?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s exactly like her name. Don\'t you remember? Tall, very animated,\r\nglittering eyes, like the Ancient Mariner\'s?"\r\n\r\nNiel laughed. "Don\'t you like bright eyes, Mrs. Forrester?"\r\n\r\n"Not any others, I don\'t!" She joined in his laugh so gaily that the\r\nCaptain looked out over his paper with an expression of satisfaction. He\r\nlet the journal slowly crumple on his knees, and sat watching the two\r\nbeside the grate. To him they seemed about the same age. It was a habit\r\nwith him to think of Mrs. Forrester as very, very young.\r\n\r\nShe noticed that he was not reading. "Would you like me to light the\r\nlamp, Mr. Forrester?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you. The twilight is very pleasant."\r\n\r\nIt was twilight by now. They heard Mary come downstairs and begin\r\nstirring about the kitchen. The Captain, his slippers in the zone of\r\nfirelight and his heavy shoulders in shadow, snored from time to time.\r\nAs the room grew dusky, the windows were squares of clear, pale violet,\r\nand the shutters ceased to rattle. The wind was dying with the day.\r\nEverything was still, except when Bohemian Mary roughly clattered a pan.\r\nMrs. Forrester whispered that she was out of sorts because her\r\nsweetheart, Joe Pucelik, hadn\'t been over to see her. Sunday night was\r\nhis regular night, and Sunday was the first day of the blizzard. "When\r\nshe\'s neglected, her tooth always begins to ache!"\r\n\r\n"Well, now that I\'ve got over, he\'ll have to come, or she will be in a\r\ntemper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'ll come!" Mrs. Forrester shrugged. "I am blind and deaf, but I\'m\r\nquite sure she makes it worth his while!" After a few moments she rose.\r\n"Come," she whispered, "Mr. Forrester is asleep. Let\'s run down the\r\nhill, there\'s no one to stop us. I\'ll slip on my rubber boots. No\r\nobjections!" She put her fingers on his lips. "Not a word! I can\'t stand\r\nthis house a moment longer."\r\n\r\nThey slipped quietly out of the front door into the cold air which\r\ntasted of new-fallen snow. A clear arc of blue and rose colour painted\r\nthe west, over the buried town. When they reached the rounded breast of\r\nthe hill, blown almost bare, Mrs. Forrester stood still and drew in deep\r\nbreaths, looking down over the drifted meadows and the stiff, blue\r\npoplars.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but it is bleak!" she murmured. "Suppose we should have to stay\r\nhere all next winter, too, . . . and the next! What will become of me,\r\nNiel?" There was fear, unmistakable fright in her voice. "You see there\r\nis nothing for me to do. I get no exercise. I don\'t skate; we didn\'t in\r\nCalifornia, and my ankles are weak. I\'ve always danced in the winter,\r\nthere\'s plenty of dancing at Colorado Springs. You wouldn\'t believe how\r\nI miss it. I shall dance till I\'m eighty. . . . I\'ll be the waltzing\r\ngrandmother! It\'s good for me, I need it."\r\n\r\nThey plunged down into the drifts and did not stop again until they\r\nreached the wooden bridge.\r\n\r\n"See, even the creek is frozen! I thought running water never froze. How\r\nlong will it be like this?"\r\n\r\n"Not long now. In a month you\'ll see the green begin in the marsh and\r\nrun over the meadows. It\'s lovely over here in the spring. And you\'ll be\r\nable to get out tomorrow, Mrs. Forrester. The clouds are thinning. Look,\r\nthere\'s the new moon!"\r\n\r\nShe turned. "Oh, I saw it over the wrong shoulder!"\r\n\r\n"No you didn\'t. You saw it over mine."\r\n\r\nShe sighed and took his arm. "My dear boy, your shoulders aren\'t broad\r\nenough."\r\n\r\nInstantly before his eyes rose the image of a pair of shoulders that\r\nwere very broad, objectionably broad, clad in a frogged overcoat with an\r\nastrachan collar. The intrusion of this third person annoyed him as they\r\nwent slowly back up the hill.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, it was as Captain Forrester\'s wife that she most\r\ninterested Niel, and it was in her relation to her husband that he most\r\nadmired her. Given her other charming attributes, her comprehension of a\r\nman like the railroad-builder, her loyalty to him, stamped her more than\r\nanything else. That, he felt, was quality; something that could never\r\nbecome worn or shabby; steel of Damascus. His admiration of Mrs.\r\nForrester went back to that, just as, he felt, she herself went back to\r\nit. He rather liked the stories, even the spiteful ones, about the gay\r\nlife she led in Colorado, and the young men she kept dangling about her\r\nevery winter. He sometimes thought of the life she might have been\r\nliving ever since he had known her,--and the one she had chosen to live.\r\nFrom that disparity, he believed, came the subtlest thrill of her\r\nfascination. She mocked outrageously at the proprieties she observed,\r\nand inherited the magic of contradictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evenings when there was no whist at the Forresters\', Niel usually\r\nsat in his room and read,--but not law, as he was supposed to do. The\r\nwinter before, when the Forresters were away, and one dull day dragged\r\nafter another, he had come upon a copious diversion, an almost\r\ninexhaustible resource. The high, narrow bookcase in the back office,\r\nbetween the double doors and the wall, was filled from top to bottom\r\nwith rows of solemn looking volumes bound in dark cloth, which were kept\r\napart from the law library; an almost complete set of the Bohn classics,\r\nwhich Judge Pommeroy had bought long ago when he was a student at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia. He had brought them West with him, not because\r\nhe read them a great deal, but because, in his day, a gentleman had such\r\nbooks in his library, just as he had claret in his cellar. Among them\r\nwas a set of Byron in three volumes, and last winter, apropos of a\r\nquotation which Niel didn\'t recognize, his uncle advised him to read\r\nByron,--all except "Don Juan." That, the Judge remarked, with a deep\r\nsmile, he "could save until later." Niel, of course, began with "Don\r\nJuan." Then he read "Tom Jones" and "Wilhelm Meister" and raced on until\r\nhe came to Montaigne and a complete translation of Ovid. He hadn\'t\r\nfinished yet with these last,--always went back to them after other\r\nexperiments. These authors seemed to him to know their business. Even in\r\n"Don Juan" there was a little "fooling," but with these gentlemen none.\r\n\r\nThere were philosophical works in the collection, but he did no more\r\nthan open and glance at them. He had no curiosity about what men had\r\nthought; but about what they had felt and lived, he had a great deal. If\r\nanyone had told him that these were classics and represented the wisdom\r\nof the ages, he would doubtless have let them alone. But ever since he\r\nhad first found them for himself, he had been living a double life, with\r\nall its guilty enjoyments He read the _Heroides_ over and over, and felt\r\nthat they were the most glowing love stories ever told. He did not think\r\nof these books as something invented to beguile the idle hour, but as\r\nliving creatures, caught in the very behaviour of living,--surprised\r\nbehind their misleading severity of form and phrase. He was\r\neavesdropping upon the past, being let into the great world that had\r\nplunged and glittered and sumptuously sinned long before little Western\r\ntowns were dreamed of. Those rapt evenings beside the lamp gave him a\r\nlong perspective, influenced his conception of the people about him,\r\nmade him know just what he wished his own relations with these people to\r\nbe. For some reason, his reading made him wish to become an architect.\r\nIf the Judge had left his Bohn library behind him in Kentucky, his\r\nnephew\'s life might have turned out differently.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring came at last, and the Forrester place had never been so lovely.\r\nThe Captain spent long, happy days among his flowering shrubs, and his\r\nwife used to say to visitors, "Yes, you can see Mr. Forrester in a\r\nmoment; I will send the English gardener to call him."\r\n\r\nEarly in June, when the Captain\'s roses were just coming on, his\r\npleasant labors were interrupted. One morning an alarming telegram\r\nreached him. He cut it open with his garden shears, came into the house,\r\nand asked his wife to telephone for Judge Pommeroy. A savings bank, one\r\nin which he was largely interested, had failed in Denver. That evening\r\nthe Captain and his lawyer went west on the express. The Judge, when he\r\nwas giving Niel final instructions about the office business, told him\r\nhe was afraid the Captain was bound to lose a good deal of money.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester seemed unaware of any danger; she went to the station to\r\nsee her husband off, spoke of his errand merely as a "business trip."\r\nNiel, however, felt a foreboding gloom. He dreaded poverty for her. She\r\nwas one of the people who ought always to have money; any retrenchment\r\nof their generous way of living would be a hardship for her,--would be\r\nunfitting. She would not be herself in straitened circumstances.\r\n\r\nNiel took his meals at the town hotel; on the third day after Captain\r\nForrester\'s departure, he was annoyed to find Frank Ellinger\'s name on\r\nthe hotel register. Ellinger did not appear at supper, which meant, of\r\ncourse, that he was dining with Mrs. Forrester, and that the lady\r\nherself would get his dinner. She had taken the occasion of the\r\nCaptain\'s absence to let Bohemian Mary go to visit her mother on the\r\nfarm for a week. Niel thought it very bad taste in Ellinger to come to\r\nSweet Water when Captain Forrester was away. He must know that it would\r\nstir up the gossips.\r\n\r\nNiel had meant to call on Mrs. Forrester that evening, but now he went\r\nback to the office instead. He read late, and after he went to bed, he\r\nslept lightly. He was awakened before dawn by the puffing of the switch\r\nengine down at the round house. He tried to muffle his ears in the sheet\r\nand go to sleep again, but the sound of escaping steam for some reason\r\nexcited him. He could not shut out the feeling that it was summer, and\r\nthat the dawn would soon be flaming gloriously over the Forresters\'\r\nmarsh. He had awakened with that intense, blissful realization of summer\r\nwhich sometimes comes to children in their beds. He rose and dressed\r\nquickly. He would get over to the hill before Frank Ellinger could\r\nintrude his unwelcome presence, while he was still asleep in the best\r\nbedroom of the Wimbleton hotel.\r\n\r\nAn impulse of affection and guardianship drew Niel up the\r\npoplar-bordered road in the early light,--though he did not go near the\r\nhouse itself, but at the second bridge cut round through the meadow and\r\non to the marsh. The sky was burning with the soft pink and silver of a\r\ncloudless summer dawn. The heavy, bowed grasses splashed him to the\r\nknees. All over the marsh, snow-on-the-mountain, globed with dew, made\r\ncool sheets of silver, and the swamp milk-weed spread its flat,\r\nraspberry-coloured clusters. There was an almost religious purity about\r\nthe fresh morning air, the tender sky, the grass and flowers with the\r\nsheen of early dew upon them. There was in all living things something\r\nlimpid and joyous--like the wet, morning call of the birds, flying up\r\nthrough the unstained atmosphere. Out of the saffron east a thin,\r\nyellow, wine-like sunshine began to gild the fragrant meadows and the\r\nglistening tops of the grove. Niel wondered why he did not often come\r\nover like this, to see the day before men and their activities had\r\nspoiled it, while the morning was still unsullied, like a gift handed\r\ndown from the heroic ages.\r\n\r\nUnder the bluffs that overhung the marsh he came upon thickets of wild\r\nroses, with flaming buds, just beginning to open. Where they had opened,\r\ntheir petals were stained with that burning rose-colour which is always\r\ngone by noon,--a dye made of sunlight and morning and moisture, so\r\nintense that it cannot possibly last . . . must fade, like ecstasy. Niel\r\ntook out his knife and began to cut the stiff stems, crowded with red\r\nthorns.\r\n\r\nHe would make a bouquet for a lovely lady; a bouquet gathered off the\r\ncheeks of morning . . . these roses, only half awake, in the\r\ndefencelessness of utter beauty. He would leave them just outside one of\r\nthe French windows of her bedroom. When she opened her shutters to let\r\nin the light, she would find them,--and they would perhaps give her a\r\nsudden distaste for coarse worldlings like Frank Ellinger.\r\n\r\nAfter tying his flowers with a twist of meadow grass, he went up the\r\nhill through the grove and softly round the still house to the north\r\nside of Mrs. Forrester\'s own room, where the door-like green shutters\r\nwere closed. As he bent to place the flowers on the sill, he heard from\r\nwithin a woman\'s soft laughter; impatient, indulgent, teasing, eager.\r\nThen another laugh, very different, a man\'s. And it was fat and\r\nlazy,--ended in something like a yawn.\r\n\r\nNiel found himself at the foot of the hill on the wooden bridge, his\r\nface hot, his temples beating, his eyes blind with anger. In his hand he\r\nstill carried the prickly bunch of wild roses. He threw them over the\r\nwire fence into a mudhole the cattle had trampled under the bank of the\r\ncreek. He did not know whether he had left the house by the driveway or\r\nhad come down through the shrubbery. In that instant between stooping to\r\nthe window-sill and rising, he had lost one of the most beautiful things\r\nin his life. Before the dew dried, the morning had been wrecked for him;\r\nand all subsequent mornings, he told himself bitterly. This day saw the\r\nend of that admiration and loyalty that had been like a bloom on his\r\nexistence. He could never recapture it. It was gone, like the morning\r\nfreshness of the flowers.\r\n\r\n"Lilies that fester," he muttered, "_lilies that fester smell far worse\r\nthan weeds._"\r\n\r\nGrace, variety, the lovely voice, the sparkle of fun and fancy in those\r\ndark eyes; all this was nothing. It was not a moral scruple she had\r\noutraged, but an aesthetic ideal. Beautiful women, whose beauty meant\r\nmore than it said . . . was their brilliancy always fed by something\r\ncoarse and concealed? Was that their secret?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNiel met his uncle and Captain Forrester when they alighted from the\r\nmorning train, and drove over to the house with them. The business on\r\nwhich they had gone to Denver was not referred to until they were\r\nsitting with Mrs. Forrester in the front parlour. The windows were open,\r\nand the perfume of the mock-orange and of June roses was blowing in from\r\nthe garden. Captain Forrester introduced the subject, after slowly\r\nunfolding his handkerchief and wiping his forehead, and his fleshy neck,\r\naround his low collar.\r\n\r\n"Maidy," he said, not looking at her, "I\'ve come home a poor man. It\r\ntook about everything there was to square up. You\'ll have this place,\r\nunencumbered, and my pension; that will be about all. The live-stock\r\nwill bring in something."\r\n\r\nNiel saw that Mrs. Forrester grew very pale, but she smiled and brought\r\nher husband his cigar stand. "Oh, well! I expect we can manage, can\'t\r\nwe?"\r\n\r\n"We can just manage. Not much more. I\'m afraid Judge Pommeroy considers\r\nI acted foolishly."\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Mrs. Forrester," the Judge exclaimed. "He acted just as I\r\nhope I would have done in his place. But I am an unmarried man. There\r\nwere certain securities, government bonds, which Captain Forrester could\r\nhave turned over to you, but it would have been at the expense of the\r\ndepositors."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve known men to do that," said the Captain heavily, "but I never\r\nconsidered they paid their wives a compliment. If Mrs. Forrester is\r\nsatisfied, I shall never regret my decision." For the first time his\r\ntired, swollen eyes sought his wife\'s.\r\n\r\n"I never question your decisions in business, Mr. Forrester. I know\r\nnothing about such things."\r\n\r\nThe Captain put down the cigar he had taken but not lighted, rose with\r\nan effort, and walked over to the bay window, where he stood gazing out\r\nover his meadows. "The place looks very nice, Maidy," he said presently.\r\n"I see you\'ve watered the roses. They need it, this weather. Now, if\r\nyou\'ll excuse me, I\'ll lie down for a while. I did not sleep well on the\r\ntrain. Niel and the Judge will stay for lunch." He opened the door into\r\nMrs. Forrester\'s room and closed it behind him.\r\n\r\nJudge Pommeroy began to explain to Mrs. Forrester the situation they had\r\nfaced in Denver. The bank, about which Mrs. Forrester knew nothing but\r\nits name, was one which paid good interest on small deposits. The\r\ndepositors were wage-earners; railroad employes, mechanics, and day\r\nlabourers, many of whom had at some time worked for Captain Forrester.\r\nHis was the only well known name among the bank officers, it was the\r\nname which promised security and fair treatment to his old workmen and\r\ntheir friends. The other directors were promising young business men\r\nwith many irons in the fire. But, the Judge said with evident chagrin,\r\nthey had refused to come up to the scratch and pay their losses like\r\ngentlemen. They claimed that the bank was insolvent, not through unwise\r\ninvestments or mismanagement, but because of a nation-wide financial\r\npanic, a shrinking in values that no one could have foreseen. They\r\nargued that the fair thing was to share the loss with the depositors; to\r\npay them fifty cents on the dollar, giving long-time notes for\r\ntwenty-five per cent, settling on a basis of seventy-five per cent.\r\n\r\nCaptain Forrester had stood firm that not one of the depositors should\r\nlose a dollar. The promising young business men had listened to him\r\nrespectfully, but finally told him they would settle only on their own\r\nterms; any additional refunding must be his affair. He sent to the vault\r\nfor his private steel box, opened it in their presence, and sorted the\r\ncontents on the table. The government bonds he turned in at once. Judge\r\nPommeroy was sent out to sell the mining stocks and other securities in\r\nthe open market.\r\n\r\nAt this part of his narrative the Judge rose and began to pace the\r\nfloor, twisting the seals on his watchchain. "That was what a man of\r\nhonour was bound to do, Mrs. Forrester. With five of the directors\r\nbacking down, he had either to lose his name or save it. The depositors\r\nhad put their savings into that bank because Captain Forrester was\r\npresident. To those men with no capital but their back and their two\r\nhands, his name meant safety. As he tried to explain to the directors,\r\nthose deposits were above price; money saved to buy a home, or to take\r\ncare of a man in sickness, or to send a boy to school. And those young\r\nmen, bright fellows, well thought of in the community, sat there and\r\nlooked down their noses and let your husband strip himself down to\r\npledging his life insurance! There was a crowd in the street outside the\r\nbank all day, every day; Poles and Swedes and Mexicans, looking scared\r\nto death. A lot of them couldn\'t speak English,--seemed like the only\r\nEnglish word they knew was \'Forrester.\' As we went in and out we\'d hear\r\nthe Mexicans saying, \'Forrester, Forrester.\' It was a torment for me, on\r\nyour account, Ma\'m, to see the Captain strip himself. But, \'pon my\r\nhonour, I couldn\'t forbid him. As for those white-livered rascals that\r\nsat there,--" the Judge stopped before Mrs. Forrester and ruffled his\r\nbushy white hair with both hands, "By God, Madam, I think I\'ve lived too\r\nlong! In my day the difference between a business man and a scoundrel\r\nwas bigger than the difference between a white man and a nigger. I\r\nwasn\'t the right one to go out there as the Captain\'s counsel. One of\r\nthese smooth members of the bar, like Ivy Peters is getting ready to be,\r\nmight have saved something for you out of the wreck. But I couldn\'t use\r\nmy influence with your husband. To that crowd outside the bank doors his\r\nname meant a hundred cents on the dollar, and by God, they got it! I\'m\r\nproud of him, Ma\'m; proud of his acquaintance!"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Niel had ever seen Mrs. Forrester flush. A quick\r\npink swept over her face. Her eyes glistened with moisture. "You Were\r\nquite right, Judge. I wouldn\'t for the world have had him do otherwise\r\nfor me. He would never hold up his head again. You see, I know him." As\r\nshe said this she looked at Niel, on the other side of the room, and her\r\nglance was like a delicate and very dignified rebuke to some\r\ndiscourtesy,--though he was not conscious of having shown her any.\r\n\r\nWhen their hostess went out to see about lunch, Judge Pommeroy turned to\r\nhis nephew. "Son, I\'m glad you want to be an architect. I can\'t see any\r\nhonourable career for a lawyer, in this new business world that\'s coming\r\nup. Leave the law to boys like Ivy Peters, and get into some clean\r\nprofession. I wasn\'t the right man to go with Forrester." He shook his\r\nhead sadly.\r\n\r\n"Will they really be poor?"\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be pinched. It\'s as he said; they\'ve nothing left but this\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester returned and went to waken her husband for lunch. When\r\nshe opened the door into her room, they heard stertorous breathing, and\r\nshe called to them to come quickly. The Captain was stretched upon his\r\niron bed in the antechamber, and Mrs. Forrester was struggling to lift\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"Quick, Niel," she panted. "We must get pillows under him. Bring those\r\nfrom my bed."\r\n\r\nNiel gently pushed her away. Sweat poured from his face as he got his\r\nstrength under the Captain\'s shoulders. It was like lifting a wounded\r\nelephant. Judge Pommeroy hurried back to the sitting-room and telephoned\r\nDr. Dennison that Captain Forrester had had a stroke.\r\n\r\n\r\nA stroke could not finish a man like Daniel Forrester. He was kept in\r\nhis bed for three weeks, and Niel helped Mrs. Forrester and Ben Keezer\r\ntake care of him. Although he was at the house so much during that time,\r\nhe never saw Mrs. Forrester alone,--scarcely saw her at all, indeed.\r\nWith so much to attend to, she became abstracted, almost impersonal.\r\nThere were many letters to answer, gifts of fruit and wine and flowers\r\nto be acknowledged. Solicitous inquiries came from friends scattered all\r\nthe way from the Missouri to the mountains. When Mrs. Forrester was not\r\nin the Captain\'s room, or in the kitchen preparing special foods for\r\nhim, she was at her desk.\r\n\r\nOne morning while she was seated there, a distinguished visitor arrived.\r\nNiel, waiting by the door for the letters he was to take to the post,\r\nsaw a large, red-whiskered man in a rumpled pongee suit and a panama hat\r\ncome climbing up the hill; Cyrus Dalzell, president of the Colorado &\r\nUtah, who had come over in his private car to enquire for the health of\r\nhis old friend Niel warned Mrs. Forrester, and she went to meet the\r\nvisitor, just as he mounted the steps, wiping his face with a red silk\r\nbandanna.\r\n\r\nHe took both the lady\'s hands and exclaimed in a warm, deep voice, "Here\r\nshe is, looking as fresh as a bride! May I claim an old privilege?" He\r\nbent his head and kissed her. "I won\'t be in your way, Marian," he said\r\nas they came into the house, "but I had to see for myself how he does,\r\nand how you do."\r\n\r\nMr. Dalzell shook hands with Niel, and as he talked he moved about the\r\nparlour clumsily and softly, like a brown bear. Mrs. Forrester stopped\r\nhim to straighten his flowing yellow tie and pull down the back of his\r\nwrinkled coat. "It\'s easy to see that Kitty wasn\'t with you this morning\r\nwhen you dressed," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you, my dear. I\'ve got a green porter down there, and\r\nhe doesn\'t seem to realize the extent of his duties. No, Kitty wanted to\r\ncome, but we have two giddy nieces out from Portsmouth, visiting us, and\r\nshe felt she couldn\'t. I just had my car hitched on to the tail of the\r\nBurlington flyer and came myself. Now tell me about Daniel. Was it a\r\nstroke?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester sat down on the sofa beside him and told him about her\r\nhusband\'s illness, while he interrupted with sympathetic questions and\r\ncomments, taking her hand between his large, soft palms and patting it\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n"And now I can go home and tell Kitty that he will soon be as good as\r\never,--and that you look like you were going to lead the ball tonight.\r\nYou whisper to Daniel that I\'ve got a couple cases of port down in my\r\ncar that will build him up faster than anything the doctors give him.\r\nAnd I\'ve brought along a dozen sherry, for a lady that knows a thing or\r\ntwo about wines. And next winter you are both coming out to stay with us\r\nat the Springs, for a change of air."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester shook her head gently. "Oh, that, I\'m afraid, is a pretty\r\ndream. But we\'ll dream it, anyway!" Everything about her had brightened\r\nsince Cyrus Dalzell came up the hill. Even the long garnet earrings\r\nbeside her cheeks seemed to flash with a deeper colour, Niel thought.\r\nShe was a different woman from the one who sat there writing, half an\r\nhour ago. Her fingers, as they played on the sleeve of the pongee coat,\r\nwere light and fluttery as butterfly wings.\r\n\r\n"No dream at all, my dear. Kitty has arranged everything. You know how\r\nquickly she thinks things out. I am to come for you in my car. We\'ll get\r\nmy old porter Jim as a valet for Daniel, and you can just play around\r\nand put fresh life into us all. We saw last winter that we couldn\'t do\r\nanything without our Lady Forrester. Nothing came off right without her.\r\nIf we had a party, we sat down afterward and wondered what in hell we\'d\r\nhad it for. Oh, no, we can\'t manage without you!"\r\n\r\nTears flashed into her eyes. "That\'s very dear of you. It\'s sweet to be\r\nremembered when one is away." In her voice there was the heartbreaking\r\nsweetness one sometimes hears in lovely, gentle old songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks the Captain was up and around again. He dragged his\r\nleft foot, and his left arm was uncertain. Though he recovered his\r\nspeech, it was thick and clouded; some words he could not pronounce\r\ndistinctly,--slid over them, dropped out a syllable. Therefore he\r\navoided talking even more than was his habit. The doctor said that\r\nunless another brain lesion occurred, he might get on comfortably for\r\nsome years yet.\r\n\r\nIn August Niel was to go to Boston to begin coaching for his entrance\r\nexaminations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he\r\nmeant to study architecture. He put off bidding the Forresters good-bye\r\nuntil the very day before he left. His last call was different from any\r\nhe had ever made there before. Already they began to treat him like a\r\nyoung man. He sat rather stiffly in that parlour where he had been so\r\nmuch at home. The Captain was in his big chair in the bay window, in the\r\nfull glow of the afternoon sun, saying little, but very friendly. Mrs.\r\nForrester, on the sofa in the shadowy corner of the room, talked about\r\nNiel\'s plans and his journey.\r\n\r\n"Is it true that Mary is going to marry Pucelik this fall?" he asked\r\nher. "Who will you get to help you?"\r\n\r\n"No one, for the present. Ben will do all I can\'t do. Never mind us. We\r\nwill pass a quiet winter, like an old country couple,--as we are!" she\r\nsaid lightly.\r\n\r\nNiel knew that she faced the winter with terror, but he had never seen\r\nher more in command of herself,--or more the mistress of her own house\r\nthan now, when she was preparing to become the servant of it. He had the\r\nfeeling, which he never used to have, that her lightness cost her\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t forget us, but don\'t mope. Make lots of new friends. You\'ll never\r\nbe twenty again. Take a chorus girl out to supper--a pretty one, mind!\r\nDon\'t bother about your allowance. If you got into a scrape, we could\r\nmanage a little cheque to help you out, couldn\'t we, Mr. Forrester?"\r\n\r\nThe Captain puffed and looked amused. "I think we could, Niel, I think\r\nso. Don\'t get up, my boy. You must stay to dinner."\r\n\r\nNiel said he couldn\'t. He hadn\'t finished packing, and he was leaving on\r\nthe morning train.\r\n\r\n"Then we must have a little something before you go." Captain Forrester\r\nrose heavily, with the aid of his cane, and went into the dining-room.\r\nHe brought back the decanter and filled three glasses with ceremony.\r\nLifting his glass, he paused, as always, and blinked.\r\n\r\n"Happy days!"\r\n\r\n"Happy days!" echoed Mrs. Forrester, with her loveliest smile, "and\r\nevery success to Niel!"\r\n\r\nBoth the Captain and his wife came to the door with him, and stood there\r\non the porch together, where he had so often seen them stand to speed\r\nthe parting guest. He went down the hill touched and happy. As he passed\r\nover the bridge his spirits suddenly fell. Would that chilling doubt\r\nalways lie in wait for him, down there in the mud, where he had thrown\r\nhis roses one morning?\r\n\r\nHe burned to ask her one question, to get the truth out of her and set\r\nhis mind at rest: What did she do with all her exquisiteness when she\r\nwas with a man like Ellinger? Where did she put it away? And having put\r\nit away, how could she recover herself, and give one--give even him--the\r\nsense of tempered steel, a blade that could fence with anyone and never\r\nbreak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was two years before Niel Herbert came home again, and when he came\r\nthe first acquaintance he met was Ivy Peters. Ivy got on the train at\r\none of the little stations east of Sweet Water, where he had been trying\r\na case. As he strolled through the Pullman he noticed among the\r\npassengers a young man in a grey flannel suit, with a silk shirt of one\r\nshade of blue and a necktie of another. After regarding this urban\r\nfigure from the rear for a few seconds, Ivy glanced down at his own\r\nclothes with gloating satisfaction. It was a hot day in June, but he\r\nwore the black felt hat and ready-made coat of winter weight he had\r\nalways affected as a boy. He stepped forward, his hands thrust in his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Niel. Thought I couldn\'t be mistaken."\r\n\r\nNiel looked up and saw the red, bee-stung face, with its two permanent\r\ndimples, smiling down at him in contemptuous jocularity.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Ivy. I couldn\'t be mistaken in you, either."\r\n\r\n"Coming home to go into business?"\r\n\r\nNiel replied that he was coming only for the summer vacation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re not through school yet? I suppose it takes longer to make an\r\narchitect than it does to make a shyster. Just as well; there\'s not much\r\nbuilding going on in Sweet Water these days. You\'ll find a good many\r\nchanges."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you sit down?" Niel indicated the neighbouring chair. "You are\r\npractising law?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, along with a few other things. Have to keep more than one iron in\r\nthe fire to make a living with us. I farm a little on the side. I rent\r\nthat meadow-land on the Forrester place. I\'ve drained the old marsh and\r\nput it into wheat. My brother John does the work, and I boss the job.\r\nIt\'s quite profitable. I pay them a good rent, and they need it. I doubt\r\nif they could get along without. Their influential friends don\'t seem to\r\nhelp them out much. Remember all those chesty old boys the Captain used\r\nto drive about in his democrat wagon, and ship in barrels of Bourbon\r\nfor? Good deal of bluff about all those old-timers. The panic put them\r\nout of the game. The Forresters have come down in the world like the\r\nrest. You remember how the old man used to put it over us kids and not\r\nlet us carry a gun in there? I\'m just mean enough to like to shoot along\r\nthat creek a little better than anywhere else, now. There wasn\'t any\r\nharm in the old Captain, but he had the delusion of grandeur. He\'s\r\nhappier now that he\'s like the rest of us and don\'t have to change his\r\nshirt every day." Ivy\'s unblinking greenish eyes rested upon Niel\'s\r\nhaberdashery.\r\n\r\nNiel, however, did not notice this. He knew that Ivy wanted him to show\r\ndisappointment, and he was determined not to do so. He enquired about\r\nthe Captain\'s health, pointedly keeping Mrs. Forrester\'s name out of the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"He\'s only about half there . . . seems contented enough. . . . She\r\ntakes good care of him, I\'ll say that for her. . . . She seeks\r\nconsolation, always did, you know . . . too much French brandy . . . but\r\nshe never neglects him. I don\'t blame her. Real work comes hard on her."\r\n\r\nNiel heard these remarks dully, through the buzz of an idea. He felt\r\nthat Ivy had drained the marsh quite as much to spite him and Mrs.\r\nForrester as to reclaim the land. Moreover, he seemed to know that until\r\nthis moment Ivy himself had not realized how much that consideration\r\nweighed with him. He and Ivy had disliked each other from childhood,\r\nblindly, instinctively, recognizing each other through antipathy, as\r\nhostile insects do. By draining the marsh Ivy had obliterated a few\r\nacres of something he hated, though he could not name it, and had\r\nasserted his power over the people who had loved those unproductive\r\nmeadows for their idleness and silvery beauty.\r\n\r\nAfter Ivy had gone on into the smoker, Niel sat looking out at the\r\nwindings of the Sweet Water and playing with his idea. The Old West had\r\nbeen settled by dreamers, great-hearted adventurers who were unpractical\r\nto the point of magnificence; a courteous brotherhood, strong in attack\r\nbut weak in defence, who could conquer but could not hold. Now all the\r\nvast territory they had won was to be at the mercy of men like Ivy\r\nPeters, who had never dared anything, never risked anything. They would\r\ndrink up the mirage, dispel the morning freshness, root out the great\r\nbrooding spirit of freedom, the generous, easy life of the great\r\nland-holders. The space, the colour, the princely carelessness of the\r\npioneer they would destroy and cut up into profitable bits, as the match\r\nfactory splinters the primeval forest. All the way from the Missouri to\r\nthe mountains this generation of shrewd young men, trained to petty\r\neconomies by hard times, would do exactly what Ivy Peters had done when\r\nhe drained the Forrester marsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon Niel found Captain Forrester in the bushy little plot\r\nhe called his rose garden, seated in a stout hickory chair that could be\r\nleft out in all weather, his two canes beside him. His attention was\r\nfixed upon a red block of Colorado sandstone, set on a granite boulder\r\nin the middle of the gravel space around which the roses grew. He showed\r\nNiel that this was a sun-dial, and explained it with great pride. Last\r\nsummer, he said, he sat out here a great deal, with a square board\r\nmounted on a post, and marked the length of the shadows by his watch.\r\nHis friend, Cyrus Dalzell, on one of his visits, took this board away,\r\nhad the diagram exactly copied on sandstone, and sent it to him, with\r\nthe column-like boulder that formed its base.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s likely Mr. Dalzell hunted around among the mountains a\r\ngood many mornings before he found a natural formation like that," said\r\nthe Captain. "A pillar, such as they had in Bible times. It\'s from the\r\nGarden of the Gods. Mr. Dalzell has his summer home up there."\r\n\r\nThe Captain sat with the soles of his boots together, his legs bowed\r\nout. Everything about him seemed to have grown heavier and weaker. His\r\nface was fatter and smoother; as if the features were running into each\r\nother, as when a wax face melts in the heat. An old Panama hat, burned\r\nyellow by the sun, shaded his eyes. His brown hands lay on his knees,\r\nthe fingers well apart, nerveless. His moustache was the same straw\r\ncolour; Niel remarked to him that it had grown no grayer. The Captain\r\ntouched his cheek with his palm. "Mrs. Forrester shaved me for awhile.\r\nShe did it very nicely, but I didn\'t like to have her do it. Now I use\r\none of these safety razors. I can manage, if I take my time. The barber\r\ncomes over once a week. Mrs. Forrester is expecting you, Niel. She\'s\r\ndown in the grove. She goes down there to rest in the hammock."\r\n\r\nNiel went round the house to the gate that gave into the grove. From the\r\ntop of the hill he could see the hammock slung between two cottonwoods,\r\nin the low glade at the farther end, where he had fallen the time he\r\nbroke his arm. The slender white figure was still, and as he hurried\r\nacross the grass he saw that a white garden hat lay over her face. He\r\napproached quietly and was just wondering if she were asleep, when he\r\nheard a soft, delighted laugh, and with a quick movement she threw off\r\nthe lace hat through which she had been watching him. He stepped forward\r\nand caught her suspended figure, hammock and all, in his arms. How light\r\nand alive she was! like a bird caught in a net. If only he could rescue\r\nher and carry her off like this,--off the earth of sad, inevitable\r\nperiods, away from age, weariness, adverse fortune!\r\n\r\nShe showed no impatience to be released, but lay laughing up at him with\r\nthat gleam of something elegantly wild, something fantastic and\r\ntantalizing,--seemingly so artless, really the most finished artifice!\r\nShe put her hand under his chin as if he were still a boy.\r\n\r\n"And how handsome he\'s grown! Isn\'t the old Judge proud of you! He\r\ncalled me up last night and began sputtering, \'It\'s only fair to warn\r\nyou, Ma\'m, that I\'ve a very handsome boy over here.\' As if I hadn\'t\r\nknown you would be! And now you\'re a man, and have seen the world! Well,\r\nwhat have you found in it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing so nice as you, Mrs. Forrester."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You have sweethearts?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Are they pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Why they? Isn\'t one enough?"\r\n\r\n"One is too many. I want you to have half a dozen,--and still save the\r\nbest for us! One would take everything. If you had her, you would not\r\nhave come home at all. I wonder if you know how we\'ve looked for you?"\r\nShe took his hand and turned a seal ring about on his little finger\r\nabsently. "Every night for weeks, when the lights of the train came\r\nswinging in down below the meadows, I\'ve said to myself, \'Niel is coming\r\nhome; there\'s that to look forward to.\'"\r\n\r\nShe caught herself as she always did when she found that she was telling\r\ntoo much, and finished in a playful tone. "So, you see, you mean a great\r\ndeal to all of us. Did you find Mr. Forrester?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! I had to stop and look at his sun-dial."\r\n\r\nShe raised herself on her elbow and lowered her voice. "Niel, can you\r\nunderstand it? He isn\'t childish, as some people say, but he will sit\r\nand watch that thing hour after hour. How can anybody like to see time\r\nvisibly devoured? We are all used to seeing clocks go round, but why\r\ndoes he want to see that shadow creep on that stone? Has he changed\r\nmuch? No? I\'m glad you feel so. Now tell me about the Adamses and what\r\nGeorge is like."\r\n\r\nNiel dropped on the turf and sat with his back against a tree trunk,\r\nanswering her rapid questions and watching her while he talked. Of\r\ncourse, she was older. In the brilliant sun of the afternoon one saw\r\nthat her skin was no longer like white lilacs,--it had the ivory tint of\r\ngardenias that have just begun to fade. The coil of blue-black hair\r\nseemed more than ever too heavy for her head. There were\r\nlines,--something strained about the corners of her mouth that used not\r\nto be there. But the astonishing thing was how these changes could\r\nvanish in a moment, be utterly wiped out in a flash of personality, and\r\none forgot everything about her except herself.\r\n\r\n"And tell me, Niel, do women really smoke after dinner now with the men,\r\nnice women? I shouldn\'t like it. It\'s all very well for actresses, but\r\nwomen can\'t be attractive if they do everything that men do."\r\n\r\n"I think just now it\'s the fashion for women to make themselves\r\ncomfortable, before anything else."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester glanced at him as if he had said something shocking. "Ah,\r\nthat\'s just it! The two things don\'t go together. Athletics and going to\r\ncollege and smoking after dinner--Do you like it? Don\'t men like women\r\nto be different from themselves? They used to."\r\n\r\nNiel laughed. Yes, that was certainly the idea of Mrs. Forrester\'s\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Judge says you don\'t come to see him any more as you used to,\r\nMrs. Forrester. He misses it."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, I haven\'t been over to the town for six weeks. I\'m always\r\ntoo tired. We have no horse now, and when I do go I have to walk. That\r\nhouse! Nothing is ever done there unless I do it, and nothing ever moves\r\nunless I move it. That\'s why I come down here in the afternoon,--to get\r\nwhere I can\'t see the house. I can\'t keep it up as it should be kept,\r\nI\'m not strong enough. Oh, yes, Ben helps me; he sweeps and beats the\r\nrugs and washes windows, but that doesn\'t get a house very far." Mrs.\r\nForrester sat up suddenly and pinned on her white hat. "We went all the\r\nway to Chicago, Niel, to buy that walnut furniture, couldn\'t find\r\nanything at home big and heavy enough. If I\'d known that one day I\'d\r\nhave to push it about, I would have been more easily satisfied!" She\r\nrose and shook out her rumpled skirts.\r\n\r\nThey started toward the house, going slowly up the long, grassy\r\nundulation between the trees.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you miss the marsh?" Niel asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nShe glanced away evasively. "Not much. I would never have time to go\r\nthere, and we need the money it pays us. And you haven\'t time to play\r\nany more either, Niel. You must hurry and become a successful man. Your\r\nuncle is terribly involved. He has been so careless that he\'s not much\r\nbetter off than we are. Money is a very important thing. Realize that in\r\nthe beginning; face it, and don\'t be ridiculous in the end, like so many\r\nof us." They stopped by the gate at the top of the hill and looked back\r\nat the green alleys and the sharp shadows, at the quivering fans of\r\nlight that seemed to push the trees farther apart and made Elysian\r\nfields underneath them. Mrs. Forrester put her white hand, with all its\r\nrings, on Niel\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Do you really find a kind of pleasure in coming back to us? That\'s very\r\nunusual, I think. At your age I wanted to be with the young and gay.\r\nIt\'s nice for us, though." She looked at him with her rarest smile, one\r\nhe had seldom seen on her face, but always remembered,--a smile without\r\narchness, without gaiety, full of affection and wistfully sad. And the\r\nsame thing was in her voice when she spoke those quiet words,--the\r\nsudden quietness of deep feeling. She turned quickly away. They went\r\nthrough the gate and around the house to where the Captain sat watching\r\nthe sunset glory on his roses. His wife touched his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Will you go in, now, Mr. Forrester, or shall I bring your coat?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go in. Isn\'t Niel going to stay for dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Not this time. He\'ll come soon, and we\'ll have a real dinner for him.\r\nWill you wait for Mr. Forrester, Niel? I must hurry in and start the\r\nfire."\r\n\r\nNiel tarried behind and accompanied the Captain\'s slow progress toward\r\nthe front of the house. He leaned upon two canes, lifting his feet\r\nslowly and putting them down firmly and carefully. He looked like an old\r\ntree walking.\r\n\r\nOnce up the steps and into the parlour, he sank into his big chair and\r\npanted heavily. The first whiff of a fresh cigar seemed to restore him.\r\n"Can I trouble you to mail some letters for me, Niel, as you go by the\r\npost-office?" He produced them from the breast pocket of his summer\r\ncoat. "Let me see whether Mrs. Forrester has anything to go." Rising,\r\nthe Captain went into the little hall. There, by the front door, on a\r\ntable under the hatrack, was a scantily draped figure, an Arab or\r\nEgyptian slave girl, holding in her hands a large flat shell from the\r\nCalifornia coast. Niel remembered noticing that figure the first time he\r\nwas ever in the house, when Dr. Dennison carried him out through this\r\nhallway with his arm in splints. In the days when the Forresters had\r\nservants and were sending over to the town several times a day, the\r\nletters for the post were always left in this shell. The Captain found\r\none now, and handed it to Niel. It was addressed to Mr. Francis Bosworth\r\nEllinger, Glenwood Springs, Colorado.\r\n\r\nFor some reason Niel felt embarrassed and tried to slip the letter\r\nquickly into his pocket. The Captain, his two canes in one hand,\r\nprevented him. He took the pale blue envelope again, and held it out at\r\narm\'s length, regarding it.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Forrester is a fine penman; have you ever noticed? Always was. If\r\nshe made me a list of articles to get at the store, I never had to hide\r\nit. It was like copper plate. That\'s exceptional in a woman, Niel."\r\n\r\nNiel remembered her hand well enough, he had never seen another in the\r\nleast like it; long, thin, angular letters, curiously delicate and\r\ncuriously bold, looped and laced with strokes fine as a hair and\r\nperfectly distinct. Her script looked as if it had been done at a high\r\npitch of speed, the pen driven by a perfectly confident dexterity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Captain! I\'m never able to take any letters for Mrs. Forrester\r\nwithout looking at them. No one could forget her writing."\r\n\r\n"Yes. It\'s very exceptional." The Captain gave him the envelope, and\r\nwith his canes went slowly toward his big chair.\r\n\r\nNiel had often wondered just how much the Captain knew. Now, as he went\r\ndown the hill, he felt sure that he knew everything; more than anyone\r\nelse; all there was to know about Marian Forrester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNiel had planned to do a great deal of reading in the Forresters\' grove\r\nthat summer, but he did not go over so often as he had intended. The\r\nfrequent appearance of Ivy Peters about the place irritated him. Ivy\r\nvisited his new wheat fields on the bottom land very often; and he\r\nalways took the old path, that led from what was once the marsh, up the\r\nsteep bank and through the grove. He was likely to appear at any hour,\r\nhis trousers stuffed into his top-boots, tramping along between the rows\r\nof trees with an air of proprietorship. He shut the gate behind the\r\nhouse with a slam and went whistling through the yard. Often he stopped\r\nat the kitchen door to call out some pleasantry to Mrs. Forrester. This\r\nannoyed Niel, for at that hour of the morning, when she was doing her\r\nhousework, Mrs. Forrester was not dressed to receive her inferiors. It\r\nwas one thing to greet the president of the Colorado & Utah _en\r\nd\xc3\xa9shabille_, but it was another to chatter with a coarse-grained fellow\r\nlike Ivy Peters in her wrapper and slippers, her sleeves rolled up and\r\nher throat bare to his cool, impudent eyes.\r\n\r\nSometimes Ivy strode through the rose plot where Captain Forrester was\r\nsitting in the sun,--went by without looking at him, as if there were no\r\none there. If he spoke to the Captain at all, he did so as if he were\r\naddressing someone incapable of understanding anything. "Hullo, Captain,\r\nain\'t afraid this sun will spoil your complexion?" or "Well, Captain,\r\nyou\'ll have to get the prayer-meetings to take up this rain question.\r\nThe drought\'s damned bad for my wheat."\r\n\r\nOne morning, as Niel was coming up through the grove, he heard laughter\r\nby the gate, and there he saw Ivy, with his gun, talking to Mrs.\r\nForrester. She was bareheaded, her skirts blowing in the wind, her arm\r\nthrough the handle of a big tin bucket that rested on the fence beside\r\nher. Ivy stood with his hat on his head, but there was in his attitude\r\nthat unmistakable something which shows that a man is trying to make\r\nhimself agreeable to a woman. He was telling her a funny story, probably\r\nan improper one, for it brought out her naughtiest laugh, with something\r\nnervous and excited in it, as if he were going too far. At the end of\r\nhis story Ivy himself broke into his farm-hand guffaw. Mrs. Forrester\r\nshook her finger at him and, catching up her pail, ran back into the\r\nhouse. She bent a little with its weight, but Ivy made no offer to carry\r\nit for her. He let her trip away with it as if she were a kitchen maid,\r\nand that were her business.\r\n\r\nNiel emerged from the grove, and stopped where the Captain sat in the\r\ngarden. "Good-morning, Captain Forrester. Was that Ivy Peters who just\r\nwent through here? That fellow hasn\'t the manners of a pig!" he blurted\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Captain pointed to Mrs. Forrester\'s empty chair. "Sit down, Niel,\r\nsit down." He drew his handkerchief from his pocket and began polishing\r\nhis glasses. "No," he said quietly, "he ain\'t overly polite."\r\n\r\nMore than if he had complained bitterly, that guarded admission made one\r\nfeel how much he had been hurt and offended by Ivy\'s rudeness. There was\r\nsomething very sad in his voice, and helpless. From his equals, respect\r\nhad always come to him as his due; from fellows like Ivy he had been\r\nable to command it,--to order them off his place, or dismiss them from\r\nhis employ.\r\n\r\nNiel sat down and smoked a cigar with him. They had a long talk about\r\nthe building of the Black Hills branch of the Burlington. In Boston last\r\nwinter Niel had met an old mine-owner, who was living in Deadwood when\r\nthe railroad first came in. When Niel asked him if he had known Daniel\r\nForrester, the old gentleman said, "Forrester? Was he the one with the\r\nbeautiful wife?"\r\n\r\n"You must tell her," said the Captain, stroking the warm surface of his\r\nsun-dial. "Yes, indeed. You must tell Mrs. Forrester."\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night in the first week of July, a night of glorious moonlight, Niel\r\nfound himself unable to read, or to stay indoors at all. He walked\r\naimlessly down the wide, empty street, and crossed the first creek by\r\nthe foot-bridge. The wide ripe fields, the whole country, seemed like a\r\nsleeping garden. One trod the dusty roads softly, not to disturb the\r\ndeep slumber of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the Forrester lane the scent of sweet clover hung heavy. It had\r\nalways grown tall and green here ever since Niel could remember; the\r\nCaptain would never let it be cut until the weeds were mowed in the\r\nfall. The black, plume-like shadows of the poplars fell across the lane\r\nand over Ivy Peters\' wheat fields. As he walked on, Niel saw a white\r\nfigure standing on the bridge over the second creek, motionless in the\r\nclear moonlight. He hurried forward. Mrs. Forrester was looking down at\r\nthe water where it flowed bright over the pebbles. He came up beside\r\nher. "The Captain is asleep?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, long ago! He sleeps well, thank heaven! After I tuck him in, I\r\nhave nothing more to worry about."\r\n\r\nWhile they were standing there, talking in low voices, they heard a\r\nheavy door slam on the hill. Mrs. Forrester started and looked back over\r\nher shoulder. A man emerged from the shadow of the house and came\r\nstriding down the driveway. Ivy Peters stepped upon the bridge.\r\n\r\n"Good evening," he said to Mrs. Forrester, neither calling her by name\r\nnor removing his hat. "I see you have company. I\'ve just been up looking\r\nat the old barn, to see if the stalls are fit to put horses in there\r\ntomorrow. I\'m going to start cutting wheat in the morning, and we\'ll\r\nhave to put the horses in your stable at noon. We\'d lose time taking\r\nthem back to town."\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly. The horses can go in our barn. I\'m sure Mr. Forrester\r\nwould have no objection." She spoke as if he had asked her permission.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Ivy shrugged. "The men will begin down here at six o\'clock. I\r\nwon\'t get over till about ten, and I have to meet a client at my office\r\nat three. Maybe you could give me some lunch, to save time."\r\n\r\nHis impudence made her smile. "Very well, then; I invite you to lunch.\r\nWe lunch at one."\r\n\r\n"Thanks. It will help me out." As if he had forgotten himself, he lifted\r\nhis hat, and went down the lane swinging it in his hand.\r\n\r\nNiel stood looking after him. "Why do you allow him to speak to you like\r\nthat, Mrs. Forrester? If you\'ll let me, I\'ll give him a beating and\r\nteach him how to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Niel! Remember, we have to get along with Ivy Peters, we simply\r\nhave to!" There was a note of anxiety in her voice, and she caught his\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t have to take anything from him, or to stand his bad manners.\r\nAnybody else would pay you as much for the land as he does."\r\n\r\n"But he has a lease for five years, and he could make it very\r\ndisagreeable for us, don\'t you see? Besides," she spoke hurriedly,\r\n"there\'s more than that. He\'s invested a little money for me in Wyoming,\r\nin land. He gets splendid land from the Indians some way, for next to\r\nnothing. Don\'t tell your uncle; I\'ve no doubt it\'s crooked. But the\r\nJudge is like Mr. Forrester; his methods don\'t work nowadays. He will\r\nnever get us out of debt, dear man! He can\'t get himself out. Ivy Peters\r\nis terribly smart, you know. He owns half the town already."\r\n\r\n"Not quite," said Niel grimly. "He\'s got hold of a good deal of\r\nproperty. He\'ll take advantage of anybody\'s necessity. You know he\'s\r\nutterly unscrupulous, don\'t you? Why didn\'t you let Mr. Dalzell, or some\r\nof your other old friends, invest your money for you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was too little! Only a few hundred dollars I\'d saved on the\r\nhousekeeping. They would put it into something safe, at six per cent. I\r\nknow you don\'t like Ivy,--and he knows it! He\'s always at his worst\r\nbefore you. He\'s not so bad as--as his face, for instance!" She laughed\r\nnervously. "He honestly wants to help us out of the hole we\'re in.\r\nComing and going all the time, as he does, he sees everything, and I\r\nreally think he hates to have me work so hard."\r\n\r\n"Next time you have anything to invest, you let me take it to Mr.\r\nDalzell and explain. I\'ll promise to do as well by you as Ivy Peters\r\ncan."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester took his arm and drew him into the lane. "But, my dear\r\nboy, you know nothing about these business schemes. You\'re not clever\r\nthat way,--it\'s one of the things I love you for. I don\'t admire people\r\nwho cheat Indians. Indeed I don\'t!" She shook her head vehemently.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Forrester, rascality isn\'t the only thing that succeeds in\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"It succeeds faster than anything else, though," she murmured absently.\r\nThey walked as far as the end of the lane and turned back again. Mrs.\r\nForrester\'s hand tightened on his arm. She began speaking abruptly. "You\r\nsee, two years, three years, more of this, and I could still go back to\r\nCalifornia--and live again. But after that . . . Perhaps people think\r\nI\'ve settled down to grow old gracefully, but I\'ve not. I feel such a\r\npower to live in me, Niel." Her slender fingers gripped his wrist. "It\'s\r\ngrown by being held back. Last winter I was with the Dalzells at\r\nGlenwood Springs for three weeks (I owe _that_ to Ivy Peters; he looked\r\nafter things here, and his sister kept house for Mr. Forrester), and I\r\nwas surprised at myself. I could dance all night and not feel tired. I\r\ncould ride horseback all day and be ready for a dinner party in the\r\nevening. I had no clothes, of course; old evening dresses with yards and\r\nyards of satin and velvet in them, that Mrs. Dalzell\'s sewing woman made\r\nover. But I looked well enough! Yes, I did. I always know how I\'m\r\nlooking, and I looked well enough. The men thought so. I looked happier\r\nthan any woman there. They were nearly all younger, much. But they\r\nseemed dull, bored to death. After a glass or two of champagne they went\r\nto sleep and had nothing to say! I always look better after the first\r\nglass,--it gives me a little colour, it\'s the only thing that does. I\r\naccepted the Dalzell\'s invitation with a purpose; I wanted to see\r\nwhether I had anything left worth saving. And I have, I tell you! You\r\nwould hardly believe it, I could hardly believe it, but I still have!"\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the bridge, a bare white floor in the\r\nmoonlight. Mrs. Forrester had been quickening her pace all the while.\r\n"So that\'s what I\'m struggling for, to get out of this hole,"--she\r\nlooked about as if she had fallen into a deep well,--"out of it! When\r\nI\'m alone here for months together, I plan and plot. If it weren\'t for\r\nthat--"\r\n\r\nAs Niel walked back to his room behind the law offices, he felt\r\nfrightened for her. When women began to talk about still feeling young,\r\ndidn\'t it mean that something had broken? Two or three years, she said.\r\nHe shivered. Only yesterday old Dr. Dennison had proudly told him that\r\nCaptain Forrester might live a dozen. "We are keeping his general health\r\nup remarkably, and he was originally a man of iron."\r\n\r\nWhat hope was there for her? He could still feel her hand upon his arm,\r\nas she urged him faster and faster up the lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather was dry and intensely hot for several weeks, and then, at\r\nthe end of July, thunder-storms and torrential rains broke upon the\r\nSweet Water valley. The river burst out of its banks, all the creeks\r\nwere up, and the stubble of Ivy Peters\' wheat fields lay under water. A\r\nwide lake and two rushing creeks now separated the Forresters from the\r\ntown. Ben Keezer rode over to them every day to do the chores and to\r\ntake them their mail. One evening Ben, with his slicker and leather\r\nmailbag, had just come out of the post-office and was preparing to mount\r\nhis horse, when Niel Herbert stopped him to ask in a low voice whether\r\nhe had got the Denver paper.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I always wait for the papers. She likes to have them to read\r\nof an evening. Guess it\'s pretty lonesome over there." He swung into his\r\nsaddle and splashed off. Niel walked slowly around to the hotel for\r\ndinner. He had found something very disconcerting in the Denver paper:\r\nFrank Ellinger\'s picture on the society page, along with Constance\r\nOgden\'s. They had been married yesterday at Colorado Springs, and were\r\nstopping at the Antlers.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Niel put on his rubber coat and started for the\r\nForresters\'. When he reached the first creek, he found that the\r\nfoot-bridge had been washed out from the far bank and lay obliquely in\r\nthe stream, battered at by the yellow current which might at any moment\r\ncarry it away. One could not cross the ford without a horse. He looked\r\nirresolutely across the submerged bottom lands. The house was dark, no\r\nlights in the parlour windows. The rain was beginning to fall again.\r\nPerhaps she had rather be alone tonight. He would go over tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the law office and tried to make himself comfortable,\r\nthough the place was in distracting disorder. The continued rain had set\r\none of the chimneys leaking, had brought down streams of soot and black\r\nwater and flooded the stove and the Judge\'s once handsome Brussels\r\ncarpet. The tinner had been there all afternoon, trying to find what was\r\nthe matter with the flue, cutting a new sheet-iron drawer to fit under\r\nthe stove-pipe. But at six o\'clock he had gone away, leaving tools and\r\nsheets of metal lying about. The rooms were damp and cold. Niel put on a\r\nheavy sweater, since he could not have a fire, lit the big coal-oil\r\nlamp, and sat down with a book. When at last he looked at his watch, it\r\nwas nearly midnight, and he had been reading three hours. He would have\r\nanother pipe, and go to bed. He had scarcely lit it, when he heard\r\nquick, hurrying footsteps in the echoing corridor outside. He got to the\r\ndoor in an instant, was there to open it before Mrs. Forrester had time\r\nto knock. He caught her by the arm and pulled her in.\r\n\r\nEverything but her wet, white face was hidden by a black rubber hat and\r\na coat that was much too big for her. Streams of water trickled from the\r\ncoat, and when she opened it he saw that she was drenched to the\r\nwaist,--her black dress clung in a muddy pulp about her.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Forrester," he cried, "you can\'t have crossed the creek! It\'s up\r\nto a horse\'s belly in the ford."\r\n\r\n"I came over the bridge, what\'s left of it. It shook under me, but I\'m\r\nnot heavy." She threw off her hat and wiped the water from her face with\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you ask Ben to bring you over on his horse? Here, please\r\nswallow this."\r\n\r\nShe pushed his hand aside. "Wait. Afterwards. Ben? I didn\'t think until\r\nafter he was gone. It\'s the telephone I want, long distance. Get me\r\nColorado Springs, the Antlers, quick!"\r\n\r\nThen Niel noticed that she smelled strong of spirits; it steamed above\r\nthe smell of rubber and creek mud and wet cloth. She snatched up the\r\ndesk telephone, but he gently took it from her.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get them for you, but you\'re in no condition to talk now; you\'re\r\nout of breath. Do you really want to talk tonight? You know Mrs. Beasley\r\nwill hear every word you say." Mrs. Beasley was the Sweet Water central,\r\nand an indefatigable reporter of everything that went over the wires.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester, sitting in his uncle\'s desk chair, tapped the carpet\r\nwith the toe of her rubber boot. "Do hurry, please," she said in that\r\npolite, warning tone of which even Ivy Peters was afraid.\r\n\r\nNiel aroused the sleepy central and put in the call. "She asks whom you\r\nwish to speak to?"\r\n\r\n"Frank Ellinger. Say Judge Pommeroy\'s office wishes to speak to him."\r\n\r\nNiel began soothing Mrs. Beasley at the other end. "No, not the\r\nmanagement, Mrs. Beasley, one of the guests. Frank Ellinger," he spelled\r\nthe name. "Yes. Judge Pommeroy\'s office wants to talk to him. I\'ll be\r\nright here. As soon as you can, please."\r\n\r\nHe put down the instrument. "I\'d rather, you know, publish anything in\r\nthe town paper than telephone it through Mrs. Beasley." Mrs. Forrester\r\npaid no heed to him, did not look at him, sat staring at the wall. "I\r\ncan\'t see why you didn\'t call me up and ask me to bring a horse over for\r\nyou, if you felt you must get to a long distance telephone tonight."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I didn\'t think of it. I only knew I had to get over here, and I\r\nwas afraid something might stop me." She was watching the telephone as\r\nif it were alive. Her eyes were shrunk to hard points. Her brows, drawn\r\ntogether in an acute angle, kept twitching in the frown which held\r\nthem,--the singular frown of one overcome by alcohol or fatigue, who is\r\nholding on to consciousness by the strength of a single purpose. Her\r\nblue lips, the black shadows under her eyes, made her look as if some\r\npoison were at work in her body.\r\n\r\nThey waited and waited. Niel understood that she did not wish him to\r\ntalk. Her mind was struggling with something, with every blink of her\r\nlashes she seemed to face it anew. Presently she rose as if she could\r\nbear the suspense no longer and went over to the window, leaned against\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Did you leave Captain Forrester alone?" Niel asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Nothing will happen over there. Nothing ever _does_ happen!" she\r\nanswered wildly, wringing her hands.\r\n\r\nThe telephone buzzed. Mrs. Forrester darted toward the desk, but Niel\r\nlifted the instrument in his left hand and barred her way with his\r\nright. "Try to be calm, Mrs. Forrester. When I get Ellinger I will let\r\nyou talk to him,--and central will hear every word you say, remember."\r\n\r\nAfter some exchanges with the Colorado office, he pointed her to the\r\nchair. "Sit down and I\'ll give it to you. He is on the wire."\r\n\r\nHe did not dare to leave her alone, though it was awkward enough to be a\r\nlistener. He walked to the window and stood with his back to the desk\r\nwhere she was sitting.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Frank? This is Marian. I won\'t keep you a moment. You were\r\nasleep? So early? That\'s not like you. You\'ve reformed already, haven\'t\r\nyou? That\'s what marriage does, they say. No, I wasn\'t altogether\r\nsurprised. You might have taken me into your confidence, though. Haven\'t\r\nI deserved it?"\r\n\r\nA long, listening pause. Niel stared stupidly at the dark window. He had\r\nsteeled his nerves for wild reproaches. The voice he heard behind him\r\nwas her most charming; playful, affectionate, intimate, with a thrill of\r\npleasant excitement that warmed its slight formality and burned through\r\nthe common-place words like the colour in an opal. He simply held his\r\nbreath while she fluttered on:\r\n\r\n"Where shall you go for your honeymoon? Oh, I\'m very sorry! So\r\nsoon . . . You must take good care of her. Give her my love. . . . I\r\nshould think California, at this time of the year, might be right . . ."\r\n\r\nIt went on like this for some minutes. The voice, it seemed to Niel, was\r\nthat of a woman, young, beautiful, happy,--warm and at her ease, sitting\r\nin her own drawing-room and talking on a stormy night to a dear friend\r\nfar away.\r\n\r\n"Oh, unusually well, for me. Stop and see for yourself. You will be\r\ngoing to Omaha on business next week, before California. Oh, yes, you\r\nwill! Stop off between trains. You know how welcome you are, always."\r\n\r\nA long pause. An exclamation from Mrs. Forrester made Niel turn sharply\r\nround. Now it was coming! Her voice was darkening with every word. "I\r\nthink I understand you. You are not speaking from your own room? What,\r\nfrom the office booth? Oh, then I understand you very well indeed!" Niel\r\nlooked about in alarm. It was time to stop her, but how? The voice went\r\non.\r\n\r\n"Play safe! When have you ever played anything else? You know, Frank,\r\nthe truth is that you\'re a coward; a great, hulking coward. Do you hear\r\nme? I want you to hear! . . . You\'ve got a safe thing at last, I should\r\nthink; safe and pasty! How much stock did you get with it? A big block,\r\nI hope! Now let me tell you the truth: I don\'t want you to come here! I\r\nnever want to see you again while I live, and I forbid you to come and\r\nlook at me when I\'m dead. I don\'t want your hateful eyes to look at my\r\ndead face. Do you hear me? Why don\'t you answer me? Don\'t dare to hang\r\nup the receiver, you coward! Oh, you big . . . Frank, Frank, say\r\nsomething! Oh, he\'s shut me off, I can\'t hear him!"\r\n\r\nShe flung the receiver down, dropped her head on the desk, and broke\r\ninto heavy, groaning sobs. Niel stood over her and waited with\r\ncomposure. For once he had been quick enough; he had saved her. The\r\nmoment that quivering passion of hatred and wrong leaped into her voice,\r\nhe had taken the big shears left by the tinner and cut the insulated\r\nwire behind the desk. Her reproaches had got no farther than this room.\r\n\r\nWhen the sobs ceased he touched her shoulder. He shook her, but there\r\nwas no response. She was asleep, sunk in a heavy stupor. Her hands and\r\nface were so cold that he thought there could not be a drop of warm\r\nblood left in her body. He carried her into his room, cut off her\r\ndrenched clothing, wrapped her in his bathrobe and put her into his own\r\nbed. She was absolutely unconscious. He blew out the light, locked her\r\nin, and left the building, going as fast as he could to Judge Pommeroy\'s\r\ncottage. He roused his uncle and briefly explained the situation.\r\n\r\n"Can you dress and go down to the office for the rest of the night,\r\nUncle Judge? Some one must be with her. And I\'ll get over to the Captain\r\nat once; he certainly oughtn\'t to be left alone. If she could get across\r\nthe bridge, I guess I can. By the way, she began talking wild, and I cut\r\nthe telephone wire behind your desk. So keep an eye on it. It might make\r\ntrouble on a stormy night like this. I\'ll get a livery hack and take\r\nMrs. Forrester home in the morning, before the town is awake."\r\n\r\nWhen daylight began to break Niel went into Captain Forrester\'s room and\r\ntold him that his wife had been sent for in the night to answer a long\r\ndistance telephone call, and that now he was going to bring her home.\r\n\r\nThe Captain lay propped up on three big pillows. Since his face had\r\ngrown fat and relaxed, its ruggedness had changed to an almost Asiatic\r\nsmoothness. He looked like a wise old Chinese mandarin as he lay\r\nlistening to the young man\'s fantastic story with perfect composure,\r\nmerely blinking and saying, "Thank you, Niel, thank you."\r\n\r\nAs Niel went through the sleeping town on his way to the livery barn, he\r\nsaw the short, plump figure of Mrs. Beasley, like a boiled pudding sewed\r\nup in a blue kimono, waddling through the feathery asparagus bed behind\r\nthe telephone office. She had already been next door to tell her\r\nneighbour Molly Tucker, the seamstress, the story of her exciting night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, when Captain Forrester had another stroke, Mrs. Beasley\r\nand Molly Tucker and their friends were perfectly agreed that it was a\r\njudgment upon his wife. No judgment could have been crueller. Under the\r\ncare of him, now that he was helpless, Mrs. Forrester quite went to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nEven after their misfortunes had begun to come upon them, she had\r\nmaintained her old reserve. She had asked nothing and accepted nothing.\r\nHer demeanour toward the townspeople was always the same; easy, cordial,\r\nand impersonal. Her own friends had moved away long ago,--all except\r\nJudge Pommeroy and Dr. Dennison. When any of the housewives from the\r\ntown came to call, she met them in the parlour, chatted with them in the\r\nsmiling, careless manner they could never break through, and they got no\r\nfurther. They still felt they must put on their best dress and carry a\r\ncard-case when they went to the Forresters\'.\r\n\r\nBut now that the Captain was helpless, everything changed. She could\r\nhold off the curious no longer. The townswomen brought soups and\r\ncustards for the invalid. When they came to sit out the night with him,\r\nshe turned the house over to them. She was worn out; so exhausted that\r\nshe was dull to what went on about her. The Mrs. Beasleys and Molly\r\nTuckers had their chance at last. They went in and out of Mrs.\r\nForrester\'s kitchen as familiarly as they did out of one another\'s. They\r\nrummaged through the linen closet to find more sheets, pried about in\r\nthe attic and cellar. They went over the house like ants, the house\r\nwhere they had never before got past the parlour; and they found they\r\nhad been fooled all these years. There was nothing remarkable about the\r\nplace at all! The kitchen was inconvenient, the sink was smelly. The\r\ncarpets were worn, the curtains faded, the clumsy, old-fashioned\r\nfurniture they wouldn\'t have had for a gift, and the upstairs bed-rooms\r\nwere full of dust and cobwebs.\r\n\r\nJudge Pommeroy remarked to his nephew that he had never seen these women\r\nlook so wide-awake, so important and pleased with themselves, as now\r\nwhen he encountered them bustling about the Forrester place. The\r\nCaptain\'s illness had the effect of a social revival, like a new club or\r\na church society. The creatures grew bolder and bolder,--and Mrs.\r\nForrester, apparently, had no power of resistance. She drudged in the\r\nkitchen, slept, half-dressed, in one of the chambers upstairs, kept\r\nherself going on black coffee and brandy. All the bars were down. She\r\nhad ceased to care about anything.\r\n\r\nAs the women came and went through the lane, Niel sometimes overheard\r\nsnatches of their conversation.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t she sell some of that silver? All those platters and covered\r\ndishes stuck away with the tarnish of years on them!"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t mind having some of her linen. There\'s a chest full of\r\ndouble damask upstairs, every tablecloth long enough to make two. Did\r\nyou ever see anything like the wine glasses! I\'ll bet there\'s not as\r\nmany in both saloons put together. If she has a sale after he\'s gone,\r\nI\'ll buy a dozen champagne glasses; they\'re nice to serve sherbet in."\r\n\r\n"There are nine dozen glasses," said Molly Tucker, "counting them for\r\nbeer and whiskey. If there is a sale, I\'ve a mind to bid in a couple of\r\nthem green ones, with long stems, for mantel ornaments. But she\'ll never\r\nsell \'em all, unless she can get the saloons to take \'em."\r\n\r\nEd Elliott\'s mother laughed. "She\'ll never sell \'em, as long as she\'s\r\ngot anything to put in \'em."\r\n\r\n"The cellar will go dry, some day."\r\n\r\n"I guess there\'s always plenty that will get it for such as her. I never\r\ngo there now that I don\'t smell it on her. I went over late the other\r\nnight, and she was on her knees, washing up the kitchen floor. Her eyes\r\nwere glassy. She kept washing the place around the ice-box over and\r\nover, till it made me nervous. I said, \'Mrs. Forrester, I think you\'ve\r\nwashed that place several times already.\'"\r\n\r\n"Was she confused?"\r\n\r\n"Not a particle! She laughed and said she was often absent-minded."\r\n\r\nMrs. Elliott\'s companions laughed, too, and agreed that absent-minded\r\nwas a good expression.\r\n\r\nNiel repeated this conversation to his uncle. "Uncle," he declared, "I\r\ndon\'t see how I can go back to Boston and leave the Forresters. I\'d like\r\nto chuck school for a year, and see them through. I want to go over\r\nthere and clear those gossips out. Could you stay at the hotel for a few\r\nweeks, and let me have Black Tom? With him to help me, I\'d send every\r\none of those women trotting down the lane."\r\n\r\nIt was arranged quietly, and at once. Tom was put in the kitchen, and\r\nNiel himself took charge of the nursing. He met the women with firmness:\r\nthey were very kind, but now nothing was needed. The Doctor had said the\r\nhouse must be absolutely quiet and that the invalid must see no one.\r\n\r\nOnce the house was tranquil, Mrs. Forrester went to bed and slept for\r\nthe better part of a week. The Captain himself improved. On his good\r\ndays he could be put into a wheel-chair and rolled out into his garden\r\nto enjoy the September sunlight and the last of his briar roses.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Niel, thank you, Tom," he often said when they lifted him\r\ninto his chair. "I value this quiet very highly." If a day came when\r\nthey thought he ought not to go out, he was sad and disappointed.\r\n\r\n"Better get him out, no matter what," said Mrs. Forrester. "He likes to\r\nlook at his place. That, and his cigar, are the only pleasures he has\r\nleft."\r\n\r\nWhen she was rested and in command of herself again, she took her place\r\nin the kitchen, and Black Tom went back to the Judge.\r\n\r\nAt night, when he was alone, when Mrs. Forrester had gone to bed and the\r\nCaptain was resting quietly, Niel found a kind of solemn happiness in\r\nhis vigils. It had been hard to give up that year; most of his\r\nclassmates were younger than he. It had cost him something, but now that\r\nhe had taken the step, he was glad. As he put in the night hours,\r\nsitting first in one chair and then in another, reading, smoking,\r\ngetting a lunch to keep himself awake, he had the satisfaction of those\r\nwho keep faith. He liked being alone with the old things that had seemed\r\nso beautiful to him in his childhood. These were still the most\r\ncomfortable chairs in the world, and he would never like any pictures so\r\nwell as "William Tell\'s Chapel" and "The House of the Tragic Poet." No\r\ncard-table was so good for solitaire as this old one with a stone top,\r\nmosaic in the pattern of a chess-board, which one of the Captain\'s\r\nfriends had brought him from Naples. No other house could take the place\r\nof this one in his life.\r\n\r\nHe had time to think of many things; of himself and of his old friends\r\nhere. He had noticed that often when Mrs. Forrester was about her work,\r\nthe Captain would call to her, "Maidy, Maidy," and she would reply,\r\n"Yes, Mr. Forrester," from wherever she happened to be, but without\r\ncoming to him,--as if she knew that when he called to her in that tone\r\nhe was not asking for anything. He wanted to know if she were near,\r\nperhaps; or, perhaps, he merely liked to call her name and to hear her\r\nanswer. The longer Niel was with Captain Forrester in those peaceful\r\nclosing days of his life, the more he felt that the Captain knew his\r\nwife better even than she knew herself; and that, knowing her, he,--to\r\nuse one of his own expressions,--valued her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Forrester\'s death, which occurred early in December, was\r\n"telegraphic news," the only State news that the discouraged town of\r\nSweet Water had furnished for a long while. Flowers and telegrams came\r\nfrom east and west, but it happened that none of the Captain\'s closest\r\nfriends could come to his funeral. Mr. Dalzell was in California, the\r\npresident of the Burlington railroad was travelling in Europe. The\r\nothers were far away or in uncertain health. Doctor Dennison and Judge\r\nPommeroy were the only two of his intimates among the pallbearers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the funeral, when the Captain was already in his\r\ncoffin, and the undertaker was in the parlour setting up chairs, Niel\r\nheard a knocking at the kitchen door. There he found Adolph Blum,\r\ncarrying a large white box.\r\n\r\n"Niel," he said, "will you please give these to Mrs. Forrester, and tell\r\nher they are from Rhein and me, for the Captain?"\r\n\r\nAdolph was in his old working clothes, the only clothes he had,\r\nprobably, with a knitted comforter about his neck. Niel knew he wouldn\'t\r\ncome to the funeral, so he said:\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come in and see him, \'Dolph? He looks just like himself."\r\n\r\nAdolph hesitated, but he caught sight of the undertaker\'s man, through\r\nthe parlour bay-window, and said, "No, thank you, Niel," thrust his red\r\nhands into his jacket pockets, and walked away.\r\n\r\nNiel took the flowers out of the box, a great armful of yellow roses,\r\nwhich must have cost the price of many a dead rabbit. He carried them\r\nupstairs, where Mrs. Forrester was lying down.\r\n\r\n"These are from the Blum boys," he said. "Adolph just brought them to\r\nthe kitchen door."\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester looked at them, then turned away her head on the pillow,\r\nher lips trembling. It was the only time that day he saw her pale\r\ncomposure break.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was large. Old settlers and farmer folk came from all over\r\nthe county to follow the pioneer\'s body to the grave. As Niel and his\r\nuncle were driving back from the cemetery with Mrs. Forrester, she spoke\r\nfor the first time since they had left the house. "Judge Pommeroy," she\r\nsaid quietly, "I think I will have Mr. Forrester\'s sun-dial taken over\r\nand put above his grave. I can have an inscription cut on the base. It\r\nseems more appropriate for him than any stone we could buy. And I will\r\nplant some of his own rose-bushes beside it."\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to the house it was four o\'clock, and she insisted\r\nupon making tea for them. "I would like it myself, and it is better to\r\nbe doing something. Wait for me in the parlour. And, Niel, move the\r\nthings back as we always have them."\r\n\r\nThe grey day was darkening, and as the three sat having their tea in the\r\nbay-window, swift squalls of snow were falling over the wide meadows\r\nbetween the hill and the town, and the creaking of the big cottonwoods\r\nabout the house seemed to say that winter had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning in April Niel was alone in the law office. His uncle had\r\nbeen ill with rheumatic fever for a long while, and he had been\r\nattending to the routine of business.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a figure stood there, strange and yet familiar,--he\r\nhad to think a moment before he realized that it was Orville Ogden, who\r\nused to come to Sweet Water so often, but who had not been seen there\r\nnow for several years. He didn\'t look a day older; one eye was still\r\ndirect and clear, the other clouded and oblique. He still wore a stiff\r\nimperial and twisted moustache, the grey colour of old beeswax, and his\r\nthin hair was brushed heroically up over the bald spot.\r\n\r\n"This is Judge Pommeroy\'s nephew, isn\'t it? I can\'t think of your name,\r\nmy boy, but I remember you. Is the Judge out?"\r\n\r\n"Please be seated, Mr. Ogden. My uncle is ill. He hasn\'t been at the\r\noffice for several months. He\'s had really a very bad time of it. Is\r\nthere anything I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sorry to hear that! I\'m sorry." He spoke as if he were. "I\r\nguess all we fellows are getting older, whether we like it or not. It\r\nmade a great difference when Daniel Forrester went." Mr. Ogden took off\r\nhis overcoat, put his hat and gloves neatly on the desk, and then seemed\r\nsomewhat at a loss. "What is your uncle\'s trouble?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nNiel told him. "I was to have gone back to school this winter, but uncle\r\nbegged me to stay and look after things for him. There was no one here\r\nhe wanted to entrust his business to."\r\n\r\n"I see, I see," said Mr. Ogden thoughtfully. "Then you do attend to his\r\nbusiness for the present?" He paused and reflected. "Yes, there was\r\nsomething that I wanted to take up with him. I am stopping off for a few\r\nhours only, between trains. I might speak to you about it, and you could\r\nconsult your uncle and write me in Chicago. It\'s a confidential matter,\r\nand concerns another person."\r\n\r\nNiel assured him of his discretion, but Mr. Ogden seemed to find the\r\nsubject difficult to approach. He looked very grave and slowly lit a\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n"It is simply," he said at last, "a rather delicate suggestion I wish to\r\nmake to your uncle about one of his clients. I have several friends in\r\nthe Government at Washington just at present, friends who would go out\r\nof their way to serve me. I have been thinking that we might manage it\r\nto get a special increase of pension for Mrs. Forrester. I am due in\r\nChicago this week, and after my business there is finished, I would be\r\nquite willing to go on to Washington to see what can be done; provided,\r\nof course, that no one, least of all your uncle\'s client, knows of my\r\nactivity in the matter."\r\n\r\nNiel flushed. "I\'m sorry, Mr. Ogden," he brought out, "but Mrs.\r\nForrester is no longer a client of my uncle\'s. After the Captain\'s\r\ndeath, she saw fit to take her business away from him."\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden\'s normal eye became as blank as the other.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that? He isn\'t her lawyer? Why, for twenty years--"\r\n\r\n"I know that, sir. She didn\'t treat him with much consideration. She\r\ntransferred her business very abruptly."\r\n\r\n"To whom, may I ask?"\r\n\r\n"To a lawyer here in town; Ivy Peters."\r\n\r\n"Peters? I never heard of him."\r\n\r\n"No, you wouldn\'t have. He wasn\'t one of the people who went to the\r\nForrester house in the old days. He\'s one of the younger generation, a\r\nfew years older than I. He rented part of the Forresters\' land for\r\nseveral years before the Captain\'s death,--was their tenant. That was\r\nhow Mrs. Forrester came to know him. She thinks him a good business\r\nman."\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden frowned. "And is he?"\r\n\r\n"Some people think so."\r\n\r\n"Is he trustworthy?"\r\n\r\n"Far from it. He takes the cases nobody else will take. He may treat\r\nMrs. Forrester honestly. But if he does, it will not be from principle."\r\n\r\n"This is very distressing news. Go on with your work, my boy. I must\r\nthink this over." Mr. Ogden rose and walked about the room, his hands\r\nbehind him. Niel turned to an unfinished letter on his desk, in order to\r\nleave his visitor the more free.\r\n\r\nMr. Ogden\'s position, he understood, was a difficult one. He had been\r\ndevoted to Mrs. Forrester, and before Constance had made up her mind to\r\nmarry Frank Ellinger, before the mother and daughter began to angle for\r\nhim, Mr. Ogden had come to the Forresters\' more frequently than any of\r\ntheir Denver friends. He hadn\'t been back, Niel believed, since that\r\nChristmas party when he and his family were there with Ellinger. Very\r\nsoon afterward he must have seen what his women-folk were up to; and\r\nwhether he approved or disapproved, he must have decided that there was\r\nnothing for him to do but to keep out. It hadn\'t been the Forresters\'\r\nreversal of fortune that had kept him away. One could see that he was\r\ndeeply troubled, that he had her heavily on his mind.\r\n\r\nNiel had finished his letter and was beginning another, when Mr. Ogden\r\nstopped beside his desk, where he stood twisting his imperial tighter\r\nand tighter. "You say this young lawyer is unprincipled? Sometimes\r\nrascals have a soft spot, a sentiment, where women are concerned."\r\n\r\nNiel stared. He immediately thought of Ivy\'s dimples.\r\n\r\n"A soft spot? A sentiment? Mr. Ogden, why not go to his office? A glance\r\nwould convince you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s not necessary! I understand." He looked out of the window,\r\nfrom which he could just see the tree-tops of the Forrester grove, and\r\nmurmured, "Poor lady! So misguided. She ought to have advice from some\r\nof Daniel\'s friends." He took out his watch and consulted it, turning\r\nsomething over in his mind. His train was due in an hour, he said.\r\nNothing could be done at present. In a few moments he left the office.\r\n\r\nAfterward, Niel felt sure that when Mr. Ogden stood there uncertainly,\r\nwatch in hand, he was considering an interview with Mrs. Forrester. He\r\nhad wanted to go to her, and had given it up. Was he afraid of his\r\nwomen-folk? Or was it another kind of cowardice, the fear of losing a\r\npleasant memory, of finding her changed and marred, a dread of something\r\nthat would throw a disenchanting light upon the past? Niel had heard his\r\nuncle say that Mr. Ogden admired pretty women, though he had married a\r\nhomely one, and that in his deep, non-committal way he was very gallant.\r\nPerhaps, with a little encouragement, he would have gone to see Mrs.\r\nForrester, and he might have helped her. The fact that he had done\r\nnothing to bring this about, made Niel realize how much his own feeling\r\ntoward that lady had changed.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Forrester herself who had changed. Since her husband\'s death\r\nshe seemed to have become another woman. For years Niel and his uncle,\r\nthe Dalzells and all her friends, had thought of the Captain as a drag\r\nupon his wife; a care that drained her and dimmed her and kept her from\r\nbeing all that she might be. But without him, she was like a ship\r\nwithout ballast, driven hither and thither by every wind. She was\r\nflighty and perverse. She seemed to have lost her faculty of\r\ndiscrimination; her power of easily and graciously keeping everyone in\r\nhis proper place.\r\n\r\nIvy Peters had been in Wyoming at the time of Captain Forrester\'s\r\nillness and death,--called away by a telegram which announced that oil\r\nhad been discovered near his land-holdings. He returned soon after the\r\nCaptain\'s funeral, however, and was seen about the Forrester place more\r\nthan ever. As there was nothing to be done on his fields in the winter,\r\nhe had amused himself by pulling down the old barn after office hours.\r\nOne was likely to come upon him, smoking his cigar on the front porch as\r\nif he owned the place. He often spent the evening there, playing cards\r\nwith Mrs. Forrester or talking about his business projects. He had not\r\nmade his fortune yet, but he was on the way to it. Occasionally he took\r\na friend or two, some of the town boys, over to dine at Mrs.\r\nForrester\'s. The boys\' mothers and sweethearts were greatly scandalized.\r\n"Now she\'s after the young ones," said Ed Elliott\'s mother. "She\'s\r\ngetting childish."\r\n\r\nAt last Niel had a plain talk with Mrs. Forrester. He told her that\r\npeople were gossiping about Ivy\'s being there so much. He had heard\r\ncomments even on the street.\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t bother about their talk. They have always talked about me,\r\nalways will. Mr. Peters is my lawyer and my tenant; I have to see him,\r\nand I\'m certainly not going to his office. I can\'t sit in the house\r\nalone every evening and knit. If you came to see me any oftener than you\r\ndo, that would make talk. You are still younger than Ivy,--and\r\nbetter-looking! Did that never occur to you?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you wouldn\'t talk to me like that," he said coldly. "Mrs.\r\nForrester, why don\'t you go away? to California, to people of your own\r\nkind. You know this town is no place for you."\r\n\r\n"I mean to, just as soon as I can sell this place. It\'s all I have, and\r\nif I leave it to tenants it will run down, and I can\'t sell it to\r\nadvantage. That\'s why Ivy is here so much, he\'s trying to make the place\r\npresentable; pulling down the old barn that had become an eyesore,\r\nputting new boards in the porch floor where the old ones had rotted.\r\nNext summer, I am going to paint the house. Unless I keep the place up,\r\nI can never get my price for it." She talked nervously, with exaggerated\r\nearnestness, as if she were trying to persuade herself.\r\n\r\n"And what are you asking for it now, Mrs. Forrester?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty thousand dollars."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never get it. At least, not until times have greatly changed."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what your uncle said. He wouldn\'t attempt to sell it for more\r\nthan twelve. That\'s why I had to put it into other hands. Times have\r\nchanged, but he doesn\'t realize it. Mr. Forrester himself told me it\r\nwould be worth that. Ivy says he can get me twenty thousand, or if not,\r\nhe will take it off my hands as soon as his investments begin to bring\r\nin returns."\r\n\r\n"And in the meantime, you are simply wasting your life here."\r\n\r\n"Not altogether." She looked at him with pleading plausibility. "I am\r\ngetting rested after a long strain. And while I wait, I\'m finding new\r\nfriends among the young men,--those your age, and a little younger. I\'ve\r\nwanted for a long while to do something for the boys in this town, but\r\nmy hands were full. I hate to see them growing up like savages, when all\r\nthey need is a civilized house to come to, and a woman to give them a\r\nfew hints. They\'ve never had a chance. You wouldn\'t be the boy you are\r\nif you\'d never gone to Boston,--and you\'ve always had older friends\r\nwho\'d seen better days. Suppose you had grown up like Ed Elliot and Joe\r\nSimpson?"\r\n\r\n"I flatter myself I wouldn\'t be exactly like them, if I had! However,\r\nthere is no use discussing it, if you\'ve thought it over and made up\r\nyour mind. I spoke of it because I thought you mightn\'t realize how it\r\nstrikes the townspeople."\r\n\r\n\r\n"I know!" She tossed her head. Her eyes glittered, but there was no\r\nmirth in them,--it was more like hysterical defiance. "I know; they call\r\nme the Merry Widow. I rather like it!"\r\n\r\nNiel left the house without further argument, and though that was three\r\nweeks ago, he had not been back since. Mrs. Forrester had called to see\r\nhis uncle in the meantime. The Judge was as courtly as ever in his\r\nmanner toward her, but he was deeply hurt by her defection, and his\r\ncherishing care for her would never be revived. He had attended to all\r\nCaptain Forrester\'s business for twenty years, and since the failure of\r\nthe Denver bank had never deducted a penny for fees from the money\r\nentrusted to him. Mrs. Forrester had treated him very badly. She had\r\ngiven him no warning. One day Ivy Peters had come into the office with a\r\nwritten order from her, requesting that an accounting, and all funds and\r\nsecurities, be turned over to him. Since then she had never spoken of\r\nthe matter to the Judge,--or to Niel, save in that conversation about\r\nthe sale of the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning when a warm May wind was whirling the dust up the street,\r\nMrs. Forrester came smiling into Judge Pommeroy\'s office, wearing a new\r\nspring bonnet, and a short black velvet cape, fastened at the neck with\r\na bunch of violets. "Please be nice enough to notice my new clothes,\r\nNiel," she said coaxingly. "They are the first I\'ve had in years and\r\nyears."\r\n\r\nHe told her they were very pretty.\r\n\r\n"And aren\'t you glad I have some at last?" she smiled enquiringly\r\nthrough her veil. "I feel as if you weren\'t going to be cross with me\r\nto-day, and would do what I ask you. It\'s nothing very troublesome. I\r\nwant you to come to dinner Friday night. If you come, there will be\r\neight of us, counting Annie Peters. They are all boys you know, and if\r\nyou don\'t like them, you ought to! Yes, you ought to!" she nodded at him\r\nseverely. "Since you mind what people say, Niel, aren\'t you afraid\r\nthey\'ll be saying you\'re a snob, just because you\'ve been to Boston and\r\nseen a little of the world? You mustn\'t be so stiff, so--so superior! It\r\nisn\'t becoming, at your age." She drew her brows down into a level frown\r\nso like his own that he laughed. He had almost forgotten her old talent\r\nfor mimicry.\r\n\r\n"What do you want me for? You used always to say it was no good asking\r\npeople who didn\'t mix."\r\n\r\n"You can mix well enough, if you take the trouble. And this time you\r\nwill, for me. Won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nWhen she was gone, Niel was angry with himself for having been\r\npersuaded.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening he was the last guest to arrive. It was a warm night,\r\nafter a hot day. The windows were open, and the perfume of the lilacs\r\ncame into the dusky parlour where the boys were sitting about in chairs\r\nthat seemed too big for them. A lamp was burning in the dining-room, and\r\nthere Ivy Peters stood at the sideboard, mixing cocktails. His sister\r\nAnnie was in the kitchen, helping the hostess. Mrs. Forrester came in\r\nfor a moment to greet Niel, then excused herself and hurried back to\r\nAnnie Peters. Through the open door he saw that the silver dishes had\r\nreappeared on the dinner table, and the candlesticks and flowers. The\r\nyoung men who sat about in the twilight would not know the difference,\r\nhe thought, if she had furnished her table that morning, from the stock\r\nin Wernz\'s queensware store. Their conception of a really fine dinner\r\nservice was one "hand painted" by a sister or sweetheart. Each boy sat\r\nwith his legs crossed, one tan shoe swinging in the air and displaying a\r\ntan silk sock. They were talking about clothes; Joe Simpson, who had\r\njust inherited his father\'s clothing business, was eager to tell them\r\nwhat the summer styles would be.\r\n\r\nIvy Peters came in, shaking his drinks. "You fellows are like a bunch of\r\ngirls,--always talking about what you are going to wear and how you can\r\nspend your money. Simpson wouldn\'t get rich very fast if you all wore\r\nyour clothes as long as I do. When did I get this suit, Joe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, about the year I graduated from High School, I guess!"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at Ivy. No matter what he did or said, they\r\nlaughed,--in recognition of his general success.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester came back, fanning herself with a little sandalwood fan,\r\nand when she appeared the boys rose,--in alarm, one might have thought,\r\nfrom the suddenness of it. That much, at any rate, she had succeeded in\r\nteaching them.\r\n\r\n"Are your cocktails ready, Ivy? You will have to wait for me a moment,\r\nwhile I put some powder on my nose. If I\'d known how hot it would be\r\ntonight, I\'m afraid I wouldn\'t have had a roast for you. I\'m browner\r\nthan the ducks. You can pour them though. I won\'t be long."\r\n\r\nShe disappeared into her own room, and the boys sat down with the same\r\nsurprising promptness. Ivy Peters carried the tray about, and they held\r\ntheir glasses before them, waiting for Mrs. Forrester. When she came,\r\nshe took Niel\'s arm and led him into the dining-room. "Did you notice,"\r\nshe whispered to him, "how they hold their glasses? What is it they do\r\nto a little glass to make it look so vulgar? Nobody could ever teach\r\nthem to pick one up and drink out of it, not if there were tea in it!"\r\n\r\nAloud she said, "Niel, will you light the candles for me? And then take\r\nthe head of the table, please. You can carve ducks?"\r\n\r\n"Not so well as--as my uncle does," he murmured, carefully putting back\r\na candle-shade.\r\n\r\n"Nor as Mr. Forrester did? I don\'t ask that. Nobody can carve now as men\r\nused to. But you can get them apart, I suppose? The place at your right\r\nis for Annie Peters. She is bringing in the dinner for me. Be seated,\r\ngentlemen!" with a little mocking bow and a swinging of earrings.\r\n\r\nWhile Niel was carving the ducks, Annie slipped into the chair beside\r\nhim, her naturally red face glowing from the heat of the stove. She was\r\nseveral years younger than her brother, whom she obeyed unquestioningly\r\nin everything. She had an extremely bad complexion and pale yellow hair\r\nwith white lights in it, exactly the colour of molasses taffy that has\r\nbeen pulled until it glistens. During the dinner she did not once speak,\r\nexcept to say, "Thank you," or "No, thank you." Nobody but Mrs.\r\nForrester talked much until the first helping of duck was consumed. The\r\nboys had not yet learned to do two things at once. They paused only to\r\nask their hostess if she "would care for the jelly," or to answer her\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nNiel studied Mrs. Forrester between the candles, as she nodded\r\nencouragingly to one and another, trying to "draw them out," laughing at\r\nRoy Jones\' heavy jokes, or congratulating Joe Simpson upon his new\r\ndignity as a business man with a business of his own. The long earrings\r\nswung beside the thin cheeks that were none the better, he thought, for\r\nthe rouge she had put on them when she went to her room just before\r\ndinner. It improved some women, but not her,--at least, not tonight,\r\nwhen her eyes were hollow with fatigue, and she looked pinched and worn\r\nas he had never seen her. He sighed as he thought how much work it meant\r\nto cook a dinner like this for eight people,--and a beefsteak with\r\npotatoes would have pleased them better! They didn\'t really like this\r\nkind of food at all. Why did she do it? How would she feel about it\r\ntonight, when she sank dead weary into bed, after these stupid boys had\r\nsaid good-night, and their yellow shoes had carried them down the hill?\r\n\r\nShe was not eating anything, she was using up all her vitality to\r\nelectrify these heavy lads into speech. Niel felt that he must help her,\r\nor at least try to. He addressed them one after another with energy and\r\ndetermination; he tried baseball, politics, scandal, the corn crop. They\r\nanswered him with monosyllables or exclamations. He soon realized that\r\nthey didn\'t want his polite remarks; they wanted more duck, and to be\r\nlet alone with it.\r\n\r\nDinner was soon over, at any rate. The hostess\' attempts to prolong it\r\nwere unavailing. The salad and frozen pudding were dispatched as\r\npromptly as the roast had been. The guests went into the parlour and lit\r\ncigars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Forrester had the old-fashioned notion that men should be alone\r\nafter dinner. She did not join them for half an hour. Perhaps she had\r\nlain down upstairs, for she looked a little rested. The boys were\r\ntalking now, discussing a camping trip Ed Elliot was going to take in\r\nthe mountains. They were giving him advice about camp outfits, trout\r\nflies, mixtures to keep off mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you, boys," said Mrs. Forrester, when she had listened to\r\nthem for a moment, "when I go back to California, I intend to have a\r\nsummer cabin up in the Sierras, and I invite you, one and all, to visit\r\nme. You\'ll have to work for your keep, you understand; cut the firewood\r\nand bring the water and wash the pots and pans, and go out and catch\r\nfish for breakfast. Ivy can bring his gun and shoot game for us, and\r\nI\'ll bake bread in an iron pot, the old trappers\' way, if I haven\'t\r\nforgotten how. Will you come?"\r\n\r\n"You bet we will! You know those mountains by heart, I expect?" said Ed\r\nElliot.\r\n\r\nShe smiled and shook her head. "It would take a life-time to do that,\r\nEd, more than a life-time. The Sierras,--there\'s no end to them, and\r\nthey\'re magnificent."\r\n\r\nNiel turned to her. "Have you ever told the boys how it was you first\r\nmet Captain Forrester in the mountains out there? If they haven\'t heard\r\nthe story, I think they would like it."\r\n\r\n"Really, would you? Well, once upon a time, when I was a very young\r\ngirl, I was spending the summer at a camp in the mountains, with friends\r\nof my father\'s."\r\n\r\nShe began there, but that was not the beginning of the story; long ago\r\nNiel had heard from his uncle that the beginning was a scandal and a\r\nmurder. When Marian Ormsby was nineteen, she was engaged to Ned\r\nMontgomery, a gaudy young millionaire of the Gold Coast. A few weeks\r\nbefore the date set for their marriage, Montgomery was shot and killed\r\nin the lobby of a San Francisco hotel by the husband of another woman.\r\nThe subsequent trial involved a great deal of publicity, and Marian was\r\nhurried away from curious eyes and sent up into the mountains until the\r\naffair should blow over.\r\n\r\nTonight Mrs. Forrester began with "Once upon a time." Sitting at one end\r\nof the big sofa, her slippers on a foot-stool and her head in shadow,\r\nshe stirred the air before her face with the sandalwood fan as she\r\ntalked, the rings glittering on her white fingers. She told them how\r\nCaptain Forrester, then a widower, had come up to the camp to visit her\r\nfather\'s partner. She had noticed him very little,--she was off every\r\nday with the young men. One afternoon she had persuaded young Fred\r\nHarney, an intrepid mountain climber, to take her down the face of Eagle\r\nCliff. They were almost down, and were creeping over a projecting ledge,\r\nwhen the rope broke, and they dropped to the bottom. Harney fell on the\r\nrocks and was killed instantly. The girl was caught in a pine tree,\r\nwhich arrested her fall. Both her legs were broken, and she lay in the\r\ncanyon all night in the bitter cold, swept by the icy canyon draught.\r\nNobody at the camp knew where to look for the two missing members of the\r\nparty,--they had stolen off alone for their foolhardy adventure. Nobody\r\nworried, because Harney knew all the trails and could not get lost. In\r\nthe morning, however, when they were still missing, search parties went\r\nout. It was Captain Forrester\'s party that found Marian, and got her out\r\nby the lower trail. The trail was so steep and narrow, the turns round\r\nthe jutting ledges so sharp, that it was impossible to take her out on a\r\nlitter. The men took turns carrying her, hugging the canyon walls with\r\ntheir shoulders as they crept along. With her broken legs hanging, she\r\nsuffered terribly,--fainted again and again. But she noticed that she\r\nsuffered less when Captain Forrester carried her, and that he took all\r\nthe most dangerous places on the trail himself. "I could feel his heart\r\npump and his muscles strain," she said, "when he balanced himself and me\r\non the rocks. I knew that if we fell, we\'d go together; he would never\r\ndrop me."\r\n\r\nThey got back to camp, and everything possible was done for her, but by\r\nthe time a surgeon could be got up from San Francisco, her fractures had\r\nbegun to knit and had to be broken over again.\r\n\r\n"It was Captain Forrester I wanted to hold my hand when the surgeon had\r\nto do things to me. You remember, Niel, he always boasted that I never\r\nscreamed when they were carrying me up the trail. He stayed at the camp\r\nuntil I could begin to walk, holding to his arm. When he asked me to\r\nmarry him, he didn\'t have to ask twice. Do you wonder?" She looked with\r\na smile about the circle, and drew her finger-tips absently across her\r\nforehead as if to brush away something,--the past, or the present, who\r\ncould tell?\r\n\r\nThe boys were genuinely moved. While she was answering their questions,\r\nNiel thought about the first time he ever heard her tell that story: Mr.\r\nDalzell had stopped off with a party of friends from Chicago; Marshall\r\nField and the president of the Union Pacific were among them, he\r\nremembered, and they were going through in Mr. Dalzell\'s private car to\r\nhunt in the Black Hills. She had, after all, not changed so much since\r\nthen. Niel felt tonight that the right man could save her, even now. She\r\nwas still her indomitable self, going through her old part,--but only\r\nthe stage-hands were left to listen to her. All those who had shared in\r\nfine undertakings and bright occasions were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the summer months Judge Pommeroy\'s health improved, and as soon as\r\nhe was able to be back in his office, Niel began to plan to return to\r\nBoston. He would get there the first of August and would go to work with\r\na tutor to make up for the months he had lost. It was a melancholy time\r\nfor him. He was in a fever of impatience to be gone, and yet he felt\r\nthat he was going away forever, and was making the final break with\r\neverything that had been dear to him in his boyhood. The people, the\r\nvery country itself, were changing so fast that there would be nothing\r\nto come back to.\r\n\r\nHe had seen the end of an era, the sunset of the pioneer. He had come\r\nupon it when already its glory was nearly spent. So in the buffalo times\r\na traveller used to come upon the embers of a hunter\'s fire on the\r\nprairie, after the hunter was up and gone; the coals would be trampled\r\nout, but the ground was warm, and the flattened grass where he had slept\r\nand where his pony had grazed, told the story.\r\n\r\nThis was the very end of the road-making West; the men who had put\r\nplains and mountains under the iron harness were old; some were poor,\r\nand even the successful ones were hunting for rest and a brief reprieve\r\nfrom death. It was already gone, that age; nothing could ever bring it\r\nback. The taste and smell and song of it, the visions those men had seen\r\nin the air and followed,--these he had caught in a kind of afterglow in\r\ntheir own faces,--and this would always be his.\r\n\r\nIt was what he most held against Mrs. Forrester; that she was not\r\nwilling to immolate herself, like the widow of all these great men, and\r\ndie with the pioneer period to which she belonged; that she preferred\r\nlife on any terms. In the end, Niel went away without bidding her\r\ngood-bye. He went away with weary contempt for her in his heart.\r\n\r\nIt happened like this,--had scarcely the dignity of an episode. It was\r\nnothing, and yet it was everything. Going over to see her one summer\r\nevening, he stopped a moment by the dining-room window to look at the\r\nhoneysuckle. The dining-room door was open into the kitchen, and there\r\nMrs. Forrester stood at a table, making pastry. Ivy Peters came in at\r\nthe kitchen door, walked up behind her, and unconcernedly put both arms\r\naround her, his hands meeting over her breast. She did not move, did not\r\nlook up, but went on rolling out pastry.\r\n\r\nNiel went down the hill. "For the last time," he said, as he crossed the\r\nbridge in the evening light, "for the last time." And it was even so; he\r\nnever went up the poplar-bordered road again. He had given her a year of\r\nhis life, and she had thrown it away. He had helped the Captain to die\r\npeacefully, he believed; and now it was the Captain who seemed the\r\nreality. All those years he had thought it was Mrs. Forrester who made\r\nthat house so different from any other. But ever since the Captain\'s\r\ndeath it was a house where old friends, like his uncle, were betrayed\r\nand cast off, where common fellows behaved after their kind and knew a\r\ncommon woman when they saw her.\r\n\r\nIf he had not had the nature of a spaniel, he told himself, he would\r\nnever have gone back after the first time. It took two doses to cure\r\nhim. Well, he had had them! Nothing she could ever do would in the least\r\nmatter to him again.\r\n\r\nHe had news of her now and then, as long as his uncle lived. "_Mrs.\r\nForrester\'s name is everywhere coupled with Ivy Peters\'_," the Judge\r\nwrote. "_She does not look happy, and I fear her health is failing, but\r\nshe has put herself in such a position that her husband\'s friends cannot\r\nhelp her._"\r\n\r\nAnd again: "_Of Mrs. Forrester, no news is good news. She is sadly\r\nbroken._"\r\n\r\nAfter his uncle\'s death, Niel heard that Ivy Peters had at last bought\r\nthe Forrester place, and had brought a wife from Wyoming to live there.\r\nMrs. Forrester had gone West,--people supposed to California.\r\n\r\nIt was years before Niel could think of her without chagrin. But\r\neventually, after she had drifted out of his ken, when he did not know\r\nif Daniel Forrester\'s widow were living or dead, Daniel Forrester\'s wife\r\nreturned to him, a bright, impersonal memory.\r\n\r\nHe came to be very glad that he had known her, and that she had had a\r\nhand in breaking him in to life. He has known pretty women and clever\r\nones since then,--but never one like her, as she was in her best days.\r\nHer eyes, when they laughed for a moment into one\'s own, seemed to\r\npromise a wild delight that he has not found in life. "I know where it\r\nis," they seemed to say, "I could show you!" He would like to call up\r\nthe shade of the young Mrs. Forrester, as the witch of Endor called up\r\nSamuel\'s, and challenge it, demand the secret of that ardour; ask her\r\nwhether she had really found some ever-blooming, ever-burning,\r\nevery-piercing joy, or whether it was all fine play-acting. Probably she\r\nhad found no more than another; but she had always the power of\r\nsuggesting things much lovelier than herself, as the perfume of a single\r\nflower may call up the whole sweetness of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiel was destined to hear once again of his long-lost lady. One evening\r\nas he was going into the dining-room of a Chicago hotel, a\r\nbroad-shouldered man with an open, sunbrowned face, approached him and\r\nintroduced himself as one of the boys who had grown up in Sweet Water.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Ed Elliott, and I thought it must be you. Could we take a table\r\ntogether? I promised an old friend of yours to give you a message, if I\r\never ran across you. You remember Mrs. Forrester? Well, I saw her again,\r\ntwelve years after she left Sweet Water,--down in Buenos Ayres." They\r\nsat down and ordered dinner.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was in South America on business. I\'m a mining engineer, I spent\r\nsome time in Buenos Ayres. One evening there was a banquet of some sort\r\nat one of the big hotels, and I happened to step out of the bar, just as\r\na car drove up to the entrance where the guests were going in. I paid no\r\nattention until one of the ladies laughed. I recognized her by her\r\nlaugh,--that hadn\'t changed a particle. She was all done up in furs,\r\nwith a scarf over her head, but I saw her eyes, and then I was sure. I\r\nstepped up and spoke to her. She seemed glad to see me, made me go into\r\nthe hotel, and talked to me until her husband came to drag her away to\r\nthe dinner. Oh, yes, she was married again,--to a rich, cranky old\r\nEnglishman; Henry Collins was his name. He was born down there, she told\r\nme, but she met him in California. She told me they lived on a big stock\r\nranch and had come down in their car for this banquet. I made inquiries\r\nafterward and found the old fellow was quite a character; had been\r\nmarried twice before, once to a Brazilian woman. People said he was\r\nrich, but quarrelsome and rather stingy. She seemed to have everything,\r\nthough. They travelled in a fine French car, and she had brought her\r\nmaid along, and he had his valet. No, she hadn\'t changed as much as\r\nyou\'d think. She was a good deal made up, of course, like most of the\r\nwomen down there; plenty of powder, and a little red, too, I guess. Her\r\nhair was black, blacker than I remembered it; looked as if she dyed it.\r\nShe invited me to visit them on their estate, and so did the old man,\r\nwhen he came to get her. She asked about everybody, and said, \'If you\r\never meet Niel Herbert, give him my love, and tell him I often think of\r\nhim.\' She said again, \'Tell him things have turned out well for me. Mr.\r\nCollins is the kindest of husbands.\' I called at your office in New York\r\non my way back from South America, but you were somewhere in Europe. It\r\nwas remarkable, how she\'d come up again. She seemed pretty well gone to\r\npieces before she left Sweet Water."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose," said Niel, "that she could be living still? I\'d almost\r\nmake the trip to see her."\r\n\r\n"No, she died about three years ago. I know that for certain. After she\r\nleft Sweet Water, wherever she was, she always sent a cheque to the\r\nGrand Army Post every year to have flowers put on Captain Forrester\'s\r\ngrave for Decoration Day. Three years ago the Post got a letter from the\r\nold Englishman, with a draft for the future care of Captain Forrester\'s\r\ngrave, \'_in memory of my late wife, Marian Forrester Collins._\'"\r\n\r\n"So we may feel sure that she was well cared for, to the very end," said\r\nNiel. "Thank God for that!"\r\n\r\n"I knew you\'d feel that way," said Ed Elliot, as a warm wave of feeling\r\npassed over his face. "I did!"\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A LOST LADY ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
