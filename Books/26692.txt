The writer does\r\nnot of course indorse the view of Prince Charles\' character herein set\r\nforth by Kenneth Montagu, but there is abundant evidence to show that the\r\nYoung Chevalier had in a very large degree those qualities which were\r\nlacking to none of the Stuarts: a charming personality and a gallant\r\nbearing. If his later life did not fulfil the promise of his youth, the\r\nunhappy circumstances which hampered him should be kept in mind as an\r\nextenuation.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the writer are due for pertinent criticism to Miss Chase, to\r\nMr. Arthur Chapman and to Mr. James Rain, and especially to Mr. Ellery\r\nSedgwick, whose friendly interest and kindly encouragement have been\r\nunfailing.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment must also be made of a copious use of Horace Walpole\'s\r\nLetters, the Chevalier Johnstone\'s History of the Rebellion, and other\r\neighteenth century sources of information concerning the incidents of the\r\ntimes. The author has taken the liberty of using several anecdotes and\r\n_bon mots_ mentioned in the "Letters"; but he has in each case put the\r\nstory in the mouth of its historical originator.\r\n\r\n                                                                 W. M. R.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAUGHTER OF RAASAY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SPORT OF CHANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Deep play!" I heard Major Wolfe whisper to Lord Balmerino. "Can Montagu\'s\r\nestate stand such a drain?"\r\n\r\n"No. He will be dipped to the last pound before midnight. \'Tis Volney\'s\r\ndoing. He has angled for Montagu a se\'nnight, and now he has hooked him. I\r\nhave warned the lad, but----"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman was right. I was past all caution now, past all restraint.\r\nThe fever of play had gripped me, and I would listen to nothing but the\r\nrattle of that little box which makes the most seductive music ever sung\r\nby siren. My Lord Balmerino might stand behind me in silent protest till\r\nall was grey, and though he had been twenty times my father\'s friend he\r\nwould not move me a jot.\r\n\r\nVolney\'s smoldering eyes looked across the table at me.\r\n\r\n"Your cast, Kenn. Shall we say doubles? You\'ll nick this time for sure."\r\n\r\n"Done! Nine\'s the main," I cried, and threw deuces.\r\n\r\nWith that throw down crashed fifty ancestral oaks that had weathered the\r\nstorms of three hundred winters. I had crabbed, not nicked.\r\n\r\n"The fickle goddess is not with you to-day, Kenn. The jade jilts us all at\r\ntimes," drawled Volney, as he raked in his winnings carelessly.\r\n\r\n"Yet I have noted that there are those whom she forsakes not often, and I\r\nhave wondered by what charmed talisman they hold her true," flashed out\r\nBalmerino.\r\n\r\nThe steel flickered into Volney\'s eyes. He understood it for no chance\r\nremark, but as an innuendo tossed forth as a challenge. Of all men Sir\r\nRobert Volney rode on the crest of fortune\'s wave, and there were not\r\nlacking those who whispered that his invariable luck was due to something\r\nmore than chance and honest skill. For me, I never believed the charge.\r\nWith all his faults Volney had the sportsman\'s love of fair play.\r\n\r\nThe son of a plain country gentleman, he had come to be by reason of his\r\nhandsome face, his reckless courage, his unfailing impudence, and his gift\r\nof _savoir-vivre_, the most notorious and fortunate of the adventurers who\r\nswarmed at the court of St. James. By dint of these and kindred qualities\r\nhe had become an intimate companion of the Prince of Wales. The man had a\r\nwide observation of life; indeed, he was an interested and whimsical\r\nobserver rather than an actor, and a scoffer always. A libertine from the\r\nhead to the heel of him, yet gossip marked him as the future husband of\r\nthe beautiful young heiress Antoinette Westerleigh. For the rest, he\r\ncarried an itching sword and the smoothest tongue that ever graced a\r\nvillain. I had been proud that such a man had picked me for his friend,\r\nentirely won by the charm of manner that made his more evil faults sit\r\ngracefully on him.\r\n\r\nVolney declined for the present the quarrel that Balmerino\'s impulsive\r\nloyalty to me would have fixed on him. He feared no living man, but he was\r\nno hothead to be drawn from his purpose. If Lord Balmerino wanted to\r\nmeasure swords with him he would accommodate the old Scotch peer with the\r\ngreatest pleasure on earth, but not till the time fitted him. He answered\r\neasily:\r\n\r\n"I know no talisman but this, my Lord; in luck and out of luck to bear a\r\nsmiling front, content with the goods the gods may send."\r\n\r\nIt was a fair hit, for Balmerino was well known as an open malcontent and\r\nsuspected of being a Jacobite.\r\n\r\n"Ah! The goods sent by the gods! A pigeon for the plucking--the lad you\r\nhave called friend!" retorted the other.\r\n\r\n"Take care, my Lord," warningly.\r\n\r\n"But there are birds it is not safe to pluck," continued Balmerino,\r\nheedless of his growing anger.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!"\r\n\r\n"As even Sir Robert Volney may find out. An eaglet is not wisely chosen\r\nfor such purpose."\r\n\r\nIt irritated me that they should thrust and parry over my shoulder, as if\r\nI had been but a boy instead of full three months past my legal majority.\r\nBesides, I had no mind to have them letting each other\'s blood on my\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n"Rat it, \'tis your play, Volney. You keep us waiting," I cried.\r\n\r\n"You\'re in a devilish hurry to be quit of your shekels," laughed the\r\nIrishman O\'Sullivan, who sat across the table from me. "Isn\'t there a\r\nproverb, Mr. Montagu, about a--a careless gentleman and his money going\r\ndifferent ways, begad? Don\'t keep him waiting any longer than need be,\r\nVolney."\r\n\r\nThere is this to be said for the Macaronis, that they plucked their pigeon\r\nwith the most graceful negligence in the world. They might live by their\r\nwits, but they knew how to wear always the jauntiest indifference of\r\nmanner. Out came the feathers with a sure hand, the while they exchanged\r\nchoice _bon mots_ and racy scandal. Hazard was the game we played and I,\r\nKenneth Montagu, was cast for the r\xc3\xb4le of the pigeon. Against these old\r\ngamesters I had no chance even if the play had been fair, and my head on\r\nit more than one of them rooked me from start to finish. I was with a vast\r\ndeal of good company, half of whom were rogues and blacklegs.\r\n\r\n"Heard George Selwyn\'s latest?"[1] inquired Lord Chesterfield languidly.\r\n\r\n"Not I. Threes, devil take it!" cried O\'Sullivan in a pet.\r\n\r\n"Tell it, Horry. It\'s your story," drawled the fourth Earl of\r\nChesterfield.\r\n\r\n"Faith, and that\'s soon done," answered Walpole. "George and I were taking\r\nthe air down the Mall arm in arm yesterday just after the fellow Fox was\r\nhanged for cutting purses, and up comes our Fox to quiz George. Says he,\r\nknowing Selwyn\'s penchant for horrors, \'George, were you at the execution\r\nof my namesake?\' Selwyn looks him over in his droll way from head to foot\r\nand says, \'Lard, no! I never attend rehearsals, Fox.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Tis the first he has missed for years then. Selwyn is as regular as Jack\r\nKetch himself. Your throw, Montagu," put in O\'Sullivan.\r\n\r\n"Seven\'s the main, and by the glove of Helen I crab. Saw ever man such\r\ncursed luck?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis vile. Luck\'s mauling you fearfully to-night," agreed Volney\r\nlanguidly. Then, apropos of the hanging, "Ketch turned off that fellow Dr.\r\nDodd too. There was a shower, and the prison chaplain held an umbrella\r\nover Dodd\'s head. Gilly Williams said it wasn\'t necessary, as the Doctor\r\nwas going to a place where he might be easily dried."\r\n\r\n"Egad, \'tis his greatest interest in life," chuckled Walpole, harking back\r\nto Selwyn. "When George has a tooth pulled he drops his kerchief as a\r\nsignal for the dentist to begin the execution."\r\n\r\nOld Lord Pam\'s toothless gums grinned appreciation of the jest as he\r\ntottered from the room to take a chair for a rout at which he was due.\r\n\r\n"Faith, and it\'s a wonder how that old Methuselah hangs on year after\r\nyear," said O\'Sullivan bluntly, before the door had even closed on the\r\noctogenarian. "He must be a thousand if he\'s a day."\r\n\r\n"The fact is," explained Chesterfield confidentially, "that old Pam has\r\nbeen dead for several years, but he doesn\'t choose to have it known.\r\nPardon me, am I delaying the game?"\r\n\r\nHe was not, and he knew it; but my Lord Chesterfield was far too polite to\r\nmore than hint to Topham Beauclerc that he had fallen asleep over his\r\nthrow. Selwyn and Lord March lounged into the coffee house arm in arm. On\r\ntheir heels came Sir James Craven, the choicest blackleg in England.\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, everybody? Whom are you and O\'Sully rooking to-night,\r\nVolney? Oh, I see--Montagu. Beg pardon," said Craven coolly.\r\n\r\nVolney looked past the man with a wooden face that did not even recognize\r\nthe fellow as a blot on the landscape. There was bad blood between the two\r\nmen, destined to end in a tragedy. Sir James had been in the high graces\r\nof Frederick Prince of Wales until the younger and more polished Volney\r\nhad ousted him. On the part of the coarse and burly Craven, there was\r\nenduring hatred toward his easy and elegant rival, who paid back his\r\nmalice with a serene contempt. Noted duellist as Craven was, Sir Robert\r\ndid not give a pinch of snuff for his rage.\r\n\r\nThe talk veered to the new fashion of spangled skirts, and Walpole vowed\r\nthat Lady Coventry\'s new dress was covered with spangles big as a\r\nshilling.\r\n\r\n"\'Twill be convenient for Coventry. She\'ll be change for a guinea,"\r\nsuggested Selwyn gloomily, his solemn face unlighted by the vestige of a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nSo they jested, even when the play was deepest and while long-inherited\r\nfamily manors passed out of the hands of their owners. The recent French\r\nvictory at _Fontenoy_ still rankled in the heart of every Englishman.\r\nWithin, the country seethed with an undercurrent of unrest and\r\ndissatisfaction. It was said that there were those who boasted quietly\r\namong themselves over their wine that the sun would yet rise some day on a\r\nStuart England, that there were desperate men still willing to risk their\r\nlives in blind loyalty or in the gambler\'s spirit for the race of Kings\r\nthat had been discarded for its unworthiness. But the cut of his Mechlin\r\nlace ruffles was more to the Macaroni than his country\'s future. He made\r\nhis jest with the same aplomb at births and weddings and deaths.\r\n\r\nEach fresh minute of play found me parted from some heirloom treasured by\r\nMontagus long since dust. In another half hour Montagu Grange was stripped\r\nof timber bare as the Row itself. Once, between games, I strolled uneasily\r\ndown the room, and passing the long looking glass scarce recognized the\r\nhaggard face that looked out at me. Still I played on, dogged and\r\nwretched, not knowing how to withdraw myself from these elegant dandies\r\nwho were used to win or lose a fortune at a sitting with imperturbable\r\nface.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino gave me a chance. He clapped a hand on my shoulder and said\r\nin his brusque kindly way--\r\n\r\n"Enough, lad! You have dropped eight thou\' to-night. Let the old family\r\npictures still hang on the walls."\r\n\r\nI looked up, flushed and excited, yet still sane enough to know his advice\r\nwas good. In the strong sallow face of Major James Wolfe I read the same\r\nword. I knew the young soldier slightly and liked him with a great\r\nrespect, though I could not know that this grave brilliant-eyed young man\r\nwas later to become England\'s greatest soldier and hero. I had even pushed\r\nback my chair to rise from the table when the cool gibing voice of Volney\r\ncut in.\r\n\r\n"The eighth wonder of the world; Lord Balmerino in a new r\xc3\xb4le--adviser to\r\nyoung men of fashion who incline to enjoy life. Are you by any chance\r\nthinking of becoming a ranting preacher, my Lord?"\r\n\r\n"I bid him do as I say and not as I have done. To point my case I cite\r\nmyself as an evil example of too deep play."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, my Lord! Faith, I fancied you had in mind even deeper play for\r\nthe future. A vastly interesting game, this of politics. You stake your\r\nhead that you can turn a king and zounds! you play the deuce instead."\r\n\r\nBalmerino looked at him blackly out of a face cut in frowning marble, but\r\nVolney leaned back carelessly in his chair and his insolent eyes never\r\nflickered.\r\n\r\nAs I say, I sat swithering \'twixt will and will-not.\r\n\r\n"Better come, Kenneth! The luck is against you to-night," urged Balmerino,\r\nhis face relaxing as he turned to me.\r\n\r\nMajor Wolfe said nothing, but his face too invited me.\r\n\r\n"Yes, better go back to school and be birched," sneered Volney.\r\n\r\nAnd at that I flung back into my seat with a curse, resolute to show him I\r\nwas as good a man as he. My grim-faced guardian angel washed his hands of\r\nme with a Scotch proverb.\r\n\r\n"He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar. The lad will have to gang his ain\r\ngate," I heard him tell Wolfe as they strolled away.\r\n\r\nStill the luck held against me. Before I rose from the table two hours\r\nlater I wrote out notes for a total so large that I knew the Grange must\r\nbe mortgaged to the roof to satisfy it.\r\n\r\nVolney lolled in his chair and hid a yawn behind tapering pink\r\nfinger-nails. "\'Slife, you had a cursed run of the ivories to-night, Kenn!\r\nWhen are you for your revenge? Shall we say to-morrow? Egad, I\'m ready to\r\nsleep round the clock. Who\'ll take a seat in my coach? I\'m for home."\r\n\r\nI pushed into the night with a burning fever in my blood, and the waves of\r\ndamp mist which enveloped London and beat upon me, gathering great drops\r\nof moisture on my cloak, did not suffice to cool the fire that burnt me\r\nup. The black dog Care hung heavy on my shoulders. I knew now what I had\r\ndone. Fool that I was, I had mortgaged not only my own heritage but also\r\nthe lives of my young brother Charles and my sister Cloe. Our father had\r\ndied of apoplexy without a will, and a large part of his personal property\r\nhad come to me with the entailed estate. The provision for the other two\r\nhad been of the slightest, and now by this one wild night of play I had\r\nput it out of my power to take care of them. I had better clap a pistol to\r\nmy head and be done with it.\r\n\r\nEven while the thought was in my mind a hand out of the night fell on my\r\nshoulder from behind. I turned with a start, and found myself face to face\r\nwith the Scotchman Balmerino.\r\n\r\n"Whither away, Kenneth?" he asked.\r\n\r\nI laughed bitterly. "What does it matter? A broken gambler--a ruined\r\ndicer-- What is there left for him?"\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Lord linked an arm through mine. I had liefer have been alone,\r\nbut I could scarce tell him so. He had been a friend of my father and had\r\ndone his best to save me from my folly.\r\n\r\n"There is much left. All is not lost. I have a word to say to your\r\nfather\'s son."\r\n\r\n"What use!" I cried rudely. "You would lock the stable after the horse is\r\nstolen."\r\n\r\n"Say rather that I would put you in the way of getting another horse," he\r\nanswered gravely.\r\n\r\nSo gravely that I looked at him twice before I answered:\r\n\r\n"And I would be blithe to find a way, for split me! as things look now I\r\nmust either pistol myself or take to the road and pistol others," I told\r\nhim gloomily.\r\n\r\n"There are worse things than to lose one\'s wealth----"\r\n\r\n"I hear you say it, but begad! I do not know them," I answered with a\r\ntouch of anger at his calmness.\r\n\r\n"----When the way is open to regain all one has lost and more," he\r\nfinished, unheeding my interruption.\r\n\r\n"Well, this way you speak of," I cried impatiently. "Where is it?"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me searchingly, as one who would know the inmost secrets of\r\nmy soul. Under a guttering street light he stopped me and read my face\r\nline by line. I dare swear he found there a recklessness to match his own\r\nand perhaps some trace of the loyalty for which he looked. Presently he\r\nsaid, as the paving stones echoed to our tread:--\r\n\r\n"You have your father\'s face, Kenn. I mind him a lad just like you when we\r\nwent out together in the \'15 for the King. Those were great days--great\r\ndays. I wonder----"\r\n\r\nHis unfinished sentence tailed out into a meditative silence. His voice\r\nand eyes told of a mind reminiscent of the past and perhaps dreamful of\r\nthe future. Yet awhile, and he snatched himself back into the present.\r\n\r\n"Six hours ago I should not have proposed this desperate remedy for your\r\nills. You had a stake in the country then, but now you are as poor in this\r\nworld\'s gear as Arthur Elphinstone himself. When one has naught but life\r\nat stake he will take greater risks. I have a man\'s game to play. Are you\r\nfor it, lad?"\r\n\r\nI hesitated, a prophetic divination in my mind that I stood in a mist at\r\nthe parting of life\'s ways.\r\n\r\n"You have thrown all to-night--and lost. I offer you another cut at\r\nFortune\'s cards. You might even turn a king."\r\n\r\nHe said it with a quiet steadfastness in which I seemed to detect an\r\nundercurrent of strenuous meaning. I stopped, and in my turn looked long\r\nat him. What did he mean? Volney\'s words came to my mind. I began to piece\r\ntogether rumours I had heard but never credited. I knew that even now men\r\ndreamed of a Stuart restoration. If Arthur Elphinstone of Balmerino were\r\none of these I knew him to be of a reckless daring mad enough to attempt\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"My Lord, you say I might turn a king," I repeated slowly. "\'Tis more like\r\nthat I would play the knave. You speak in riddles. I am no guesser of\r\nthem. You must be plain."\r\n\r\nStill he hung back from a direct answer. "You are dull to-night, Kenn. I\r\nhave known you more gleg at the uptake, but if you will call on me\r\nto-morrow night I shall make all plain to you."\r\n\r\nWe were arrived at the door of his lodgings, a mean house in a shabby\r\nneighbourhood, for my Lord was as poor as a church mouse despite his\r\ntitle. I left him here, and the last words I called over my shoulder to\r\nhim were,\r\n\r\n"Remember, I promise nothing."\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised that as I turned my steps back toward my rooms in\r\nArlington Street I found much matter for thought. I cursed the folly that\r\nhad led me to offer myself a dupe to these hawks of the gaming table. I\r\nraged in a stress of heady passion against that fair false friend Sir\r\nRobert Volney. And always in the end my mind jumped back to dally with\r\nBalmerino\'s temptation to recoup my fallen fortunes with one desperate\r\nthrow.\r\n\r\n"Fraoch! Dh \'aindeoin co theireadh e!" (The Heath! Gainsay who dare!)\r\n\r\nThe slogan echoed and reechoed through the silent streets, and snatched me\r\nin an instant out of the abstraction into which I had fallen. Hard upon\r\nthe cry there came to me the sound of steel ringing upon steel. I legged\r\nit through the empty road, flung myself round a corner, and came plump\r\nupon the combatants. The defendant was a lusty young fellow apparently\r\nabout my own age, of extraordinary agility and no mean skill with the\r\nsword. He was giving a good account of himself against the four assailants\r\nwho hemmed him against the wall, his point flashing here and there with\r\nswift irregularity to daunt their valiancy. At the moment when I appeared\r\nto create a diversion one of the four had flung himself down and forward\r\nto cling about the knees of their victim with intent to knife him at close\r\nquarters. The young man dared not shorten his sword length to meet this\r\nnew danger. He tried to shake off the man, caught at his white throat and\r\nattempted to force him back, what time his sword still opposed the rest of\r\nthe villains.\r\n\r\nThen I played my small part in the entertainment. One of the rascals\r\nscreamed out an oath at sight of me and turned to run. I pinked him in the\r\nshoulder, and at the same time the young swordsman fleshed another of\r\nthem. The man with the knife scrambled to his feet, a ludicrous picture of\r\nghastly terror. To make short, in another minute there was nothing to be\r\nseen of the cutpurses but flying feet scampering through the night.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman turned to me with a bow that was never invented out of\r\nFrance. I saw now that he was something older than myself, tall,\r\nwell-made, and with a fine stride to him that set off the easy grace of\r\nhis splendid shoulders. His light steady blue eyes and his dark ruddy hair\r\nproclaimed him the Highlander. His face was not what would be called\r\nhandsome: the chin was over-square and a white scar zigzagged across his\r\ncheek, but I liked the look of him none the less for that. His frank manly\r\ncountenance wore the self-reliance of one who has lived among the hills\r\nand slept among the heather under countless stars. For dress he wore the\r\nEnglish costume with the extra splash of colour that betokened the vanity\r\nof his race. "\'Fore God, sir, you came none too soon," he cried in his\r\nimpetuous Gaelic way. "This riff-raff of your London town had knifed me in\r\nanother gliff. I will be thinking that it would have gone ill with me but\r\nfor your opportune arrival. I am much beholden to you, and if ever I can\r\npay the debt do not fail to call on Don--er--James Brown."\r\n\r\nAt the last words he fell to earth most precipitately, all the fervent\r\nring dropping out of his voice. Now James Brown is a common name enough,\r\nbut he happened to be the first of the name I had ever heard crying a\r\nHighland slogan in the streets of London, and I looked at him with\r\nsomething more than curiosity. I am a Scotchman myself on the mother\'s\r\nside, so that I did not need to have a name put to his nationality.\r\n\r\nThere was the touch of a smile on my face when I asked him if he were\r\nhurt. He gave me the benefit of his full seventy three inches and told me\r\nno, that he would think shame of himself if he could not keep his head\r\nwith his hands from a streetful of such scum. And might he know the name\r\nof the unknown friend who had come running out of the night to lend him an\r\narm?\r\n\r\n"Kenneth Montagu," I told him, laughing at his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Well then, Mr. Kenneth Montagu, it\'s the good friend you\'ve been to me\r\nthis night, and I\'ll not be forgetting it."\r\n\r\n"When I find myself attacked by footpads I\'ll just look up Mr. James\r\nBrown," I told him dryly with intent to plague.\r\n\r\nHe took the name sourly, no doubt in an itching to blurt out that he was a\r\nMac-something or other. To a Gaelic gentleman like him the Sassenach name\r\nhe used for a convenience was gall and wormwood.\r\n\r\nWe walked down the street together, and where our ways parted near\r\nArlington Street he gave me his hand.\r\n\r\n"The lucky man am I at meeting you, Mr. Montagu, while we were having the\r\nbit splore down the street. I was just weanying for a lad handy with his\r\nblade, and the one I would be choosing out of all England came hot-foot\r\nround the corner."\r\n\r\nI made nothing of what I had done, but yet his Highland friendliness and\r\nflatteries were balm to a sick heart and we parted at my door with a great\r\ndeal of good-will.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [1]  The author takes an early opportunity to express his obligations\r\n      to the letters of Horace Walpole who was himself so infinitely\r\n      indebted to the conversation of his cronies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA CRY IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n"Past ten o\'clock, and a clear starry night!" the watch was bawling as I\r\nset out from my rooms to keep my appointment with Lord Balmerino. I had\r\nlittle doubt that a Stuart restoration was the cause for which he was\r\nrecruiting, and all day I had balanced in my mind the pros and cons of\r\nsuch an attempt. I will never deny that the exiled race held for me a\r\nstrong fascination. The Stuarts may have been weak, headstrong Kings in\r\ntheir prosperity, but they had the royal virtue of drawing men to them in\r\ntheir misfortune. They were never so well loved, nor so worthy of it, as\r\nwhen they lived in exile at St. Germains. Besides, though I had never\r\nmixed with politics, I was a Jacobite by inheritance. My father had fought\r\nfor a restoration, and my uncle had died for it.\r\n\r\nThere were no fast bound ties to hold me back. Loyalty to the Hanoverians\r\nhad no weight with me. I was a broken man, and save for my head could lose\r\nnothing by the venture. The danger of the enterprise was a merit in my\r\neyes, for I was in the mood when a man will risk his all on an impulse.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I hung back. After all an Englishman, be he never so desperate,\r\ndoes not fling away the scabbard without counting the cost. Young as I was\r\nI grued at the thought of the many lives that would be cut off ere their\r\ntime, and in my heart I distrusted the Stuarts and doubted whether the\r\ngame were worth the candle.\r\n\r\nI walked slowly, for I was not yet due at the lodgings of Balmerino for an\r\nhour, and as I stood hesitating at a street corner a chaise sheered past\r\nme at a gallop. Through the coach window by the shine of the moon I caught\r\none fleeting glimpse of a white frightened girl-face, and over the mouth\r\nwas clapped a rough hand to stifle any cry she might give. I am no Don\r\nQuixote, but there never was a Montagu who waited for the cool second\r\nthought to crowd out the strong impulse of the moment. I made a dash at\r\nthe step, missed my footing, and rolled over into the mud. When I got to\r\nmy feet again the coach had stopped at the far end of the street. Two men\r\nwere getting out of the carriage holding between them a slight struggling\r\nfigure. For one instant the clear shrill cry of a woman was lifted into\r\nthe night, then it was cut short abruptly by the clutch of a hand at the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nI scudded toward them, lugging at my sword as I ran, but while I was yet\r\nfifty yards away the door of the house opened and closed behind them. An\r\ninstant, and the door reopened to let out one of the men, who slammed it\r\nbehind him and entered the chaise. The postilion whipped up his horses and\r\ndrove off. The door yielded nothing to my hand. Evidently it was locked\r\nand bolted. I cried out to open, and beat wildly upon the door with the\r\nhilt of my sword. Indeed, I quite lost my head, threatening, storming, and\r\nabusing. I might as well have called upon the marble busts at the Abbey to\r\ncome forth, for inside there was the silence of the dead. Presently lights\r\nbegan to glimmer in windows along the dark street, and nightcapped heads\r\nwere thrust out to learn what was ado. I called on them to join me in a\r\nrescue, but I found them not at all keen for the adventure. They took me\r\nfor a drunken Mohawk or some madman escaped from custody.\r\n\r\n"Here come the watch to take him away," I heard one call across the street\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nI began to realize that an attempt to force an entrance was futile. It\r\nwould only end in an altercation with the approaching watch. Staid\r\ncitizens were already pointing me out to them as a cause of the\r\ndisturbance. For the moment I elected discretion and fled incontinent down\r\nthe street from the guard.\r\n\r\nBut I was back before ten minutes were up, lurking in the shadows of\r\nopposite doorways, examining the house from front and rear, searching for\r\nsome means of ingress to this mysterious dwelling. I do not know why the\r\nthing stuck in my mind. Perhaps some appealing quality of youth in the\r\nface and voice stirred in me the instinct for the championship of dames\r\nthat is to be found in every man. At any rate I was grimly resolved not to\r\ndepart without an explanation of the strange affair.\r\n\r\nWhat no skill of mine could accomplish chance did for me. While I was\r\ninviting a crick in my neck from staring up at the row of unlighted\r\nwindows above me, a man came out of the front door and stood looking up\r\nand down the street. Presently he spied me and beckoned. I was all\r\ndishevelled and one stain of mud from head to foot.\r\n\r\n"D\' ye want to earn a shilling, fellow?" he called.\r\n\r\nI grumbled that I was out of work and money. Was it likely I would refuse\r\nsuch a chance? And what was it he would have me do?\r\n\r\nHe led the way through the big, dimly-lighted hall to an up-stairs room\r\nnear the back of the house. Two heavy boxes were lying there, packed and\r\ncorded, to be taken down-stairs. I tossed aside my cloak and stooped to\r\nhelp him. He straightened with a jerk. I had been standing in the shadow\r\nwith my soiled cloak wrapped about me, but now I stood revealed in silken\r\nhose, satin breeches, and laced doublet. If that were not enough to\r\nproclaim my rank a rapier dangled by my side.\r\n\r\n"Rot me, you\'re a gentleman," he cried.\r\n\r\nI affected to carry off my shame with bluster.\r\n\r\n"What if I am!" I cried fiercely. "May not a gentleman be hungry, man? I\r\nam a ruined dicer, as poor as a church mouse. Do you grudge me my\r\nshilling?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. Doubtless he had seen more than one broken\r\ngentleman cover poverty with a brave front of fine lawn and gilded\r\nsplendour of array.\r\n\r\n"All one to me, your Royal \'Ighness. Take \'old \'ere," he said\r\nfacetiously.\r\n\r\nWe carried the boxes into the hall. When we had finished I stood mopping\r\nmy face with a handkerchief, but my eyes were glued to the label tacked on\r\none of the boxes.\r\n\r\n_John Armitage, The Oaks, Epsom, Surrey._\r\n\r\n"Wot yer waitin\' for?" asked the fellow sharply.\r\n\r\n"The shilling," I told him.\r\n\r\nI left when he gave it me, and as I reached the door he bawled to be sure\r\nto shut it tight. An idea jumped to my mind on the instant, and though I\r\nslammed the door I took care to have my foot an inch or two within the\r\nportal. Next moment I was walking noisily down the steps and along the\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nThree minutes later I tiptoed back up the steps and tried the door. I\r\nopened it slowly and without noise till I could thrust in my head. The\r\nfellow was nowhere to be seen in the hall. I whipped in, and closed the\r\ndoor after me. Every board seemed to creak as I trod gingerly toward the\r\nstairway. In the empty house the least noise echoed greatly. The polished\r\nstairs cried out hollowly my presence. I was half way up when I came to a\r\nfull stop. Some one was coming down round the bend of the stairway. Softly\r\nI slid down the balustrade and crouched behind the post at the bottom. The\r\nman--it was my friend of the shilling--passed within a foot of me, his\r\nhand almost brushing the hair of my head, and crossed the hall to a room\r\nopposite. Again I went up the stairs, still cautiously, but with a\r\nconfidence born of the knowledge of his whereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe house was large, and I might have wandered long without guessing where\r\nlay the room I wanted had it not been for a slight sound that came to\r\nme--the low, soft sobbing of a woman. I groped my way along the dark\r\npassage, turned to the left, and presently came to the door from behind\r\nwhich issued the sound. The door was locked on the outside, and the key\r\nwas in the lock. I knocked, and at once silence fell. To my second knock I\r\ngot no answer. Then I turned the key and entered.\r\n\r\nA girl was sitting at a table with her back to me, her averted head\r\nleaning wearily on her hand. Dejection spoke in every line of her figure.\r\nShe did not even turn at my entrance, thinking me no doubt to be her\r\nguard. I stood waiting awkwardly, scarce knowing what to say.\r\n\r\n"Madam," I began, "may I-- Is there----?" So far I got, then I came to an\r\nembarrassed pause, for I might as well have talked to the dead for all the\r\nanswer I got. She did not honour me with the faintest sign of attention. I\r\nhemmed and hawed and bowed to her back with a growing confusion.\r\n\r\nAt last she asked over her shoulder in a strained, even voice,\r\n\r\n"What is it you\'re wanting now? You said I was to be left by my lane\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nI murmured like a gawk that I was at her service, and presently as I\r\nshifted from one foot to the other she turned slowly. Her face was a dumb\r\ncry for help, though it was a proud face too--one not lacking in fire and\r\ncourage. I have seen fairer faces, but never one more to my liking. It was\r\nher eyes that held me. The blue of her own Highland lochs, with all their\r\nchanging and indescribably pathetic beauty, lurked deeply in them.\r\nUnconsciously they appealed to me, and the world was not wide enough to\r\nkeep me from her when they called. Faith, my secret is out already, and I\r\nhad resolved that it should keep till near the end of my story!\r\n\r\nI had dropped my muddy cloak before I entered, and as she looked at me a\r\nchange came over her. Despair gave way to a startled surprise. Her eyes\r\ndilated.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, sir? And--what are you doing here?" she demanded.\r\n\r\nI think some fear or presage of evil was knocking at her heart, for though\r\nshe fronted me very steadily her eyes were full of alarm. What should a\r\nman of rank be doing in her room on the night she had been abducted from\r\nher lodgings unless his purpose were evil? She wore a long cloak\r\nstretching to the ground, and from under it slippered feet peeped out. The\r\ncloak was of the latest mode, very wide and open at the neck and\r\nshoulders, and beneath the mantle I caught more than a glimpse of the\r\nlaced white nightrail and the fine sloping neck. \'Twas plain that her\r\nabductors had given her only time to fling the wrap about her before they\r\nsnatched her from her bedchamber. Some wild instinct of defense stirred\r\nwithin her, and with one hand she clutched the cloak tightly to her\r\nthroat. My heart went out to the child with a great rush of pity. The mad\r\nfollies of my London life slipped from me like the muddy garment outside,\r\nand I swore by all I held most dear not to see her wronged.\r\n\r\n"Madam," I said, "for all the world I would not harm you. I have come to\r\noffer you my sword as a defense against those who would injure you. My\r\nname is Montagu, and I know none of the name that are liars," I cried.\r\n\r\n"Are you the gentleman that was for stopping the carriage as we came?" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"I am that same unlucky gentleman that was sent speldering in the\r\nglaur.[2] I won an entrance to the house by a trick, and I am here at your\r\nservice," I said, throwing in my tag of Scotch to reassure her.\r\n\r\n"You will be English, but you speak the kindly Scots," she cried.\r\n\r\n"My mother was from the Highlands," I told her.\r\n\r\n"What! You have the Highland blood in you? Oh then, it is the good heart\r\nyou will have too. Will you ever have been on the braes of Raasay?"\r\n\r\nI told her no; that I had always lived in England, though my mother was a\r\nCampbell. Her joy was the least thing in the world daunted, and in her\r\nvoice there was a dash of starch.\r\n\r\n"Oh! A Campbell!"\r\n\r\nI smiled. \'Twas plain her clan was no friend to the sons of _Diarmaid_.\r\n\r\n"My father was out in the \'15, and when he wass a wounded fugitive with\r\nthe Campbell bloodhounds on his trail Mary Campbell hid him till the chase\r\nwas past. Then she guided him across the mountains and put him in the way\r\nof reaching the Macdonald country. My father married her after the\r\namnesty," I explained.\r\n\r\nThe approving light flashed back into her eyes.\r\n\r\n"At all events then I am not doubting she wass a good lassie, Campbell or\r\nno Campbell; and I am liking it that your father went back and married\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"But we are wasting time," I urged. "What can I do for you? Where do you\r\nlive? To whom shall I take you?"\r\n\r\nShe fell to earth at once. "My grief! I do not know. Malcolm has gone to\r\nFrance. He left me with Hamish Gorm in lodgings, but they will not be safe\r\nsince----" She stopped, and at the memory of what had happened there the\r\nwine crept into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"And who is Malcolm?" I asked gently.\r\n\r\n"My brother. He iss an agent for King James in London, and he brought me\r\nwith him. But he was called away, and he left me with the gillie. To-night\r\nthey broke into my room while Hamish was away, weary fa\' the day! And now\r\nwhere shall I go?"\r\n\r\n"My sister is a girl about your age. Cloe would be delighted to welcome\r\nyou. I am sure you would like each other."\r\n\r\n"You are the good friend to a poor lass that will never be forgetting, and\r\nI will be blithe to burden the hospitality of your sister till my brother\r\nreturns."\r\n\r\nThe sharp tread of footsteps on the stairs reached us. A man was coming\r\nup, and he was singing languidly a love ditty.\r\n\r\n                   "What is love? \'Tis not hereafter,\r\n                   Present mirth has present laughter,\r\n                   What\'s to come is still unsure;\r\n                   In delay there lies no plenty,\r\n                   Then come kiss me sweet and twenty.\r\n                   Youth\'s a stuff will not endure."\r\n\r\nSomething in the voice struck a familiar chord in my memory, but I could\r\nnot put a name to its owner. The girl looked at me with eyes grown\r\nsuddenly horror-stricken. I noticed that her face had taken on the hue of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n"We are too late," she cried softly.\r\n\r\nWe heard a key fumbling in the lock, and then the door opened--to let in\r\nVolney. His hat was sweeping to the floor in a bow when he saw me. He\r\nstopped and looked at me in surprise, his lips framing themselves for a\r\nwhistle. I could see the starch run through and take a grip of him. For\r\njust a gliff he stood puzzled and angry. Then he came in wearing his ready\r\ndare-devil smile and sat down easily on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Hope I\'m not interrupting, Montagu," he said jauntily. "I dare say though\r\nthat\'s past hoping for. You\'ll have to pardon my cursedly malapropos\r\nappearance. Faith, my only excuse is that I did not know the lady was\r\nentertaining other visitors this evening."\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with careless insolence out of his beautiful dark eyes,\r\nand for that moment I hated him with the hate a man will go to hell to\r\nsatisfy.\r\n\r\n"You will spare this lady your insults," I told him in a low voice. "At\r\nleast so far as you can. Your presence itself is an insult."\r\n\r\n"Egad, and that\'s where the wind sits, eh? Well, well, \'tis the manner of\r\nthe world. When the cat\'s away!"\r\n\r\nA flame of fire ran through me. I took a step toward him, hand on sword\r\nhilt. With a sweep of his jewelled hand he waved me back.\r\n\r\n"Fie, fie, Kenn! In a lady\'s presence?"\r\n\r\nVolney smiled at the girl in mock gallantry and my eyes followed his. I\r\nnever saw a greater change. She was transformed. Her lithe young figure\r\nstood out tall and strong, every line of weariness gone. Hate, loathing,\r\nscorn, one might read plainly there, but no trace of fear or despair. She\r\nmight have been a lioness defending her young. Her splendour of dark\r\nauburn hair, escaped and fallen free to her waist, fascinated me with the\r\nluxuriance of its disorder. Volney\'s lazy admiration quickened to a deeper\r\ninterest. For an instant his breath came faster. His face lighted with the\r\njoy of the huntsman after worthy game. But almost immediately he recovered\r\nhis aplomb. Turning to me, he asked with his odd light smile,\r\n\r\n"Staying long, may I ask?"\r\n\r\nMy passion was gone. I was possessed by a slow fire as steady and as\r\nenduring as a burning peat.\r\n\r\n"I have not quite made up my mind how long to stay," I answered coldly.\r\n"When I leave the lady goes with me, but I haven\'t decided yet what to do\r\nwith you."\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh. "You grow amusing. \'Slife, you are not all country boor\r\nafter all! May it please you, what are the alternatives regarding my\r\nhumble self?" he drawled, leaning back with an elbow on the pillow.\r\n\r\n"Well, I might kill you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you might. And--er-- What would I be doing?" he asked negligently.\r\n\r\n"Or, since there is a lady present, I might leave you till another time."\r\n\r\nHis handsome, cynical face, with its curious shifting lights and shadows,\r\nlooked up at me for once suffused with genuine amusement.\r\n\r\n"Stap me, you\'d make a fortune as a play actor. Garrick is a tyro beside\r\nyou. Some one was telling me that your financial affairs had been going\r\nwrong. An it comes to the worst, take my advice and out-Garrick Garrick."\r\n\r\n"You are very good. Your interest in my affairs charms me, Sir Robert.\r\n\'Tis true they are not promising. A friend duped me. He held the Montagu\r\nestates higher than honour."\r\n\r\nHe appeared to reflect. "Friend? Don\'t think I\'m acquainted with any of\r\nthe kind, unless a friend is one who eats your dinners, drinks your wines,\r\nrides your horses, and"--with a swift sidelong look at the girl--"makes\r\nlove to your charming adored."\r\n\r\nInto the girl\'s face the colour flared, but she looked at him with a\r\ncontempt so steady that any man but Volney must have winced.\r\n\r\n"Friendship!" she cried with infinite disdain. "What can such as you know\r\nof it? You are false as Judas. Did you not begowk my honest brother with\r\nfine words till he and I believed you one of God\'s noblemen, and when his\r\nback was fairly turned----?"\r\n\r\n"I had the best excuse in London for my madness, Aileen," he said with the\r\nwistful little laugh that had gone straight to many a woman\'s heart.\r\n\r\nHer eye flashed and her bosom heaved. The pure girl-heart read him like an\r\nopen book.\r\n\r\n"And are you thinking me so mean a thing as still to care for your honeyed\r\nwords? Believe me, there iss no viper on the braes of Raasay more\r\ndetestable to me than you."\r\n\r\nI looked to see him show anger, but he nursed his silk-clad ankle with the\r\nsame insolent languor. He might have been a priest after the confessional\r\nfor all the expression his face wore.\r\n\r\n"I like you angry, Aileen. Faith, \'tis worth being the object of your rage\r\nto see you stamp that pretty foot and clench those little hands I love to\r\nkiss. But Ecod! Montagu, the hour grows late. The lady will lose her\r\nbeauty sleep. Shall you and I go down-stairs and arrange for a\r\nconveyance?"\r\n\r\nHe bowed low and kissed his fingers to the girl. Then he led the way out\r\nof the room, fine and gallant and debonair, a villain every inch of him.\r\n\r\n"Will you be leaving me?" the girl cried with parted lips.\r\n\r\n"Not for long," I told her. "Do not fear. I shall have you out of here in\r\na jiff," and with that I followed at his heels.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Volney led the way down the corridor to a small room in the\r\nwest wing, where flaring, half-burnt candles guttering in their sconces\r\ndrove back the darkness. He leaned against the mantel and looked long at\r\nme out of half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n"May I ask to what is due the honour of your presence to-night?" he\r\ndrawled at last.\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I have said you may ask," I fleered rudely. "But for me-- Gad\'s life! I\r\nam not in the witness box."\r\n\r\nHe took his snuff mull from his waistcoat pocket and offered it me, then\r\ntook a pinch and brushed from his satin coat imaginary grains with\r\nprodigious care.\r\n\r\n"You are perhaps not aware that I have the right to ask. It chances that\r\nthis is my house."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! And the lady we have just left----?"\r\n\r\n"----Is, pardon me, none of your concern."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'m not so sure of that."\r\n\r\n"Faith then, you\'ll do well to make sure."\r\n\r\n"And--er--Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh?"\r\n\r\n"Quite another matter! You\'re out of court again, Mr. Montagu."\r\n\r\n"Egad, I enter an exception. The lady we have just left is of another mind\r\nin the affair. She is the court of last resort, and, I believe, not\r\ncomplaisant to your suit."\r\n\r\n"She will change her mind," he said coolly.\r\n\r\n"I trust so renowned a gallant as Sir Robert would not use force."\r\n\r\n"Lard, no! She is a woman and therefore to be won. But I would advise you\r\nto dismiss the lady from your mind. \'Ware women, Mr. Montagu! You will\r\nsleep easier."\r\n\r\n"In faith, a curious coincidence! I was about to tender you the same\r\nadvice, Sir Robert," I told him lightly.\r\n\r\n"You will forget the existence of such a lady if you are wise?"\r\n\r\n"Wisdom comes with age. I am for none of it."\r\n\r\n"Yet you will do well to remember your business and forget mine."\r\n\r\n"I have no business of my own, Sir Robert. Last night you generously\r\nlifted all sordid business cares from my mind, and now I am quite free to\r\nattend those of my neighbours."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders in the French way. "Very well. A wilful man!\r\nYou\'ve had your warning, and-- I am not a man to be thwarted."\r\n\r\n"I might answer that I am not a man to be frightened."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not be the first that has answered that. The others have \'Hic\r\nJacet\' engraved on their door plates. Well, it\'s an unsatisfactory world\r\nat best, and Lard! they\'re well quit of it. Still, you\'re young."\r\n\r\n"And have yet to learn discretion."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pity too," he retorted lightly. "The door is waiting for you.\r\nBetter take it, Mr. Montagu."\r\n\r\n"With the lady?"\r\n\r\n"I fear the lady is tired. Besides, man, think of her reputation. Zounds!\r\nCan she gad about the city at night alone with so gay a spark as you? \'Tis\r\na censorious world, and tongues will clack. No, no! I will save you from\r\nany chance of such a scandal, Mr. Montagu."\r\n\r\n"Faith, one good turn deserves another. I\'ll stay here to save your\r\nreputation, Sir Robert."\r\n\r\n"I fear that mine is fly-blown already and something the worse for wear.\r\nIt can take care of itself."\r\n\r\n"Yet I\'ll stay."\r\n\r\n"Gad\'s life! Stay then."\r\n\r\nVolney had been standing just within the door, and at the word he stepped\r\nout and flung it to. I sprang forward, but before I reached it the click\r\nsounded. I was a prisoner, caught like a fly in a spider\'s web, and much\r\nit helped me to beat on the iron-studded door till my hand bled, to call\r\non him to come in and fight it out like a man, to storm up and down the\r\nroom in a stress of passion.\r\n\r\nPresently my rage abated, and I took stock of my surroundings. The windows\r\nwere barred with irons set in stone sockets by masonry. I set my knee\r\nagainst the window frame and tugged at them till I was moist with\r\nperspiration. As well I might have pulled at the pillars of St. Paul\'s. I\r\ntried my small sword as a lever, but it snapped in my hand. Again I\r\nexamined the bars. There was no way but to pick them from their sockets by\r\nmaking a groove in the masonry. With the point of my sword I chipped\r\nindustriously at the cement. At the end of ten minutes I had made\r\nperceptible progress. Yet it took me another hour of labour to accomplish\r\nmy task. I undid the blind fastenings, clambered out, and lowered myself\r\nfoot by foot to the ground by clinging to the ivy that grew thick along\r\nthe wall. The vine gave to my hand, and the last three yards I took in a\r\nrush, but I picked myself up none the worse save for a torn face and\r\nbruised hands.\r\n\r\nThe first fall was Volney\'s, and I grudged it him; but as I took my way to\r\nBalmerino\'s lodgings my heart was far from heavy. The girl was safe for\r\nthe present. I knew Volney well enough for that. That his plan was to take\r\nher to The Oaks and in seclusion lay a long siege to the heart of the\r\ngirl, I could have sworn. But from London to Epsom is a far cry, and\r\nbetween them much might happen through chance and fate and--Kenneth\r\nMontagu.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [2]  Speldering in the glaur--sprawling in the mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDEOCH SLAINT AN RIGH!\r\n\r\n\r\n"You\'re late, Kenn," was Balmerino\'s greeting to me.\r\n\r\n"Faith, my Lord, I\'m earlier than I might have been. I found it hard to\r\npart from a dear friend who was loathe to let me out of his sight," I\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman buckled on his sword and disappeared into the next room.\r\nWhen he returned a pair of huge cavalry pistols peeped from under his\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n"Going to the wars, my Lord?" I quizzed gaily.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. Will you join me?"\r\n\r\n"Maybe yes and maybe no. Is the cause good?"\r\n\r\n"The best in the world."\r\n\r\n"And the chances of success?"\r\n\r\n"Fortune beckons with both hands."\r\n\r\n"Hm! Has she by any chance a halter in her hands for Kenn Montagu and an\r\naxe for Balmerino since he is a peer?"\r\n\r\n"Better the sharp edge of an axe than the dull edge of hunger for those we\r\nlove," he answered with a touch of bitterness.\r\n\r\nHis rooms supplied the sermon to his text. Gaunt poverty stared at me on\r\nevery hand. The floor was bare and the two ragged chairs were rickety. I\r\nknew now why the white-haired peer was so keen to try a hazard of new\r\nfortunes for the sake of the wife in the North.\r\n\r\n"Where may you be taking me?" I asked presently, as we hurried through\r\nPiccadilly.\r\n\r\n"If you ask no questions----" he began dryly.\r\n\r\n"----You\'ll tell me no lies. Very good. Odd\'s my life, I\'m not caring! Any\r\ndirection is good enough for me--unless it leads to Tyburn. But I warn you\r\nthat I hold myself unpledged."\r\n\r\n"I shall remember."\r\n\r\nI was in the gayest spirits imaginable. The task I had set myself of\r\nthwarting Volney and the present uncertainty of my position had combined\r\nto lend a new zest to life. I felt the wine of youth bubble in my veins,\r\nand I was ready for whatever fortune had in store.\r\n\r\nShortly we arrived at one of those streets of unimpeachable respectability\r\nthat may be duplicated a hundred times in London. Its characteristics are\r\nmonotony and dull mediocrity; a dead sameness makes all the houses appear\r\nalike. Before one of these we stopped.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino knocked, A man came to the door and thrust out a head\r\nsuspiciously. There was a short whispered colloquy between him and the\r\nScotch lord, after which he beckoned me to enter. For an instant I hung\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"What are you afraid of, man?" asked Balmerino roughly.\r\n\r\nI answered to the spur and pressed forward at once. He led the way along a\r\ndark passage and down a flight of stone steps into a cellar fitted up as a\r\ndrinking room. There was another low-toned consultation before we were\r\nadmitted. I surmised that Balmerino stood sponsor for me, and though I was\r\na little disturbed at my equivocal position, yet I was strangely glad to\r\nbe where I was. For here was a promise of adventure to stimulate a jaded\r\nappetite. I assured myself that at least I should not suffer dulness.\r\n\r\nThere were in the room a scant dozen of men, and as I ran them over with\r\nmy eye the best I could say for their quality in life was that they had\r\nnot troubled the tailor of late. Most of them were threadbare at elbow and\r\nwould have looked the better of a good dinner. There were two or three\r\nexceptions, but for the most part these broken gentlemen bore the marks of\r\nrecklessness and dissipation. Two I knew: the O\'Sullivan that had assisted\r\nat the plucking of a certain pigeon on the previous night, and Mr. James\r\nBrown, alias Mac-something or other, of the supple sword and the Highland\r\nslogan.\r\n\r\nAlong with another Irishman named Anthony Creagh the fellow O\'Sullivan\r\nrushed up to my Lord, eyes snapping with excitement. He gave me a nod and\r\na "How d\'ye do, Montagu? Didn\'t know you were of the honest party," then\r\nbroke out with--\r\n\r\n"Great news, Balmerino! The French fleet has sailed with transports for\r\nfifteen thousand men. I have advices direct from the Prince. Marshal Saxe\r\ncommands, and the Prince himself is with them. London will be ours within\r\nthe week. Sure the good day is coming at last. The King--God bless\r\nhim!--will have his own again; and a certain Dutch beer tub that we know\r\nof will go scuttling back to his beloved Hanover, glory be the day!"\r\n\r\nBalmerino\'s eyes flashed.\r\n\r\n"They have sailed then at last. I have been expecting it a week. If they\r\nonce reach the Thames there is no force in England that can stop them," he\r\nsaid quietly.\r\n\r\n"Surely the small fleet of Norris will prove no barrier?" asked another\r\ndubiously.\r\n\r\n"Poof! They weel eat heem up jus\' like one leetle mouse, my frien\',"\r\nboasted a rat-faced Frenchman with a snap of his fingers. "Haf they not\r\ntwo sheeps to his one?"\r\n\r\n"Egad, I hope they don\'t eat the mutton then and let Norris go," laughed\r\nCreagh. He was a devil-may-care Irishman, brimful of the virtues and the\r\nvices of his race.\r\n\r\nI had stumbled into a hornet\'s nest with a vengeance. They were mad as\r\nMarch hares, most of them. For five minutes I sat amazed, listening to the\r\nwildest talk it had ever been my lot to hear. The Guelphs would be driven\r\nout. The good old days would be restored; there would be no more whiggery\r\nand Walpolism; with much more of the same kind of talk. There was drinking\r\nof wine and pledging of toasts to the King across the water, and all the\r\nwhile I sat by the side of Balmerino with a face like whey. For I was\r\nsimmering with anger. I foresaw the moment when discovery was inevitable,\r\nand in those few minutes while I hung back in the shadow and wished myself\r\na thousand miles away hard things were thought of Arthur Elphinstone Lord\r\nBalmerino. He had hoped to fling me out of my depths and sweep me away\r\nwith the current, but I resolved to show him another ending to it.\r\n\r\nPresently Mr. James Brown came up and offered me a frank hand of welcome.\r\nBalmerino introduced him as Captain Donald Roy Macdonald. I let my\r\ncountenance express surprise.\r\n\r\n"Surely you are mistaken, my Lord. This gentleman and I have met before,\r\nand I think his name is Brown."\r\n\r\nMacdonald laughed a little sheepishly. "The air of London is not just\r\nexactly healthy for Highland Jacobite gentlemen at present. I wouldna\r\nwonder but one might catch the scarlet fever gin he werena carefu\', so I\r\njust took a change of names for a bit while."\r\n\r\n"You did not disguise the Highland slogan you flung out last night," I\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Did I cry it?" he asked. "It would be just from habit then. I didna ken\r\nthat I opened my mouth." Then he turned to my affairs. "And I suppose you\r\nwill be for striking a blow for the cause like the rest of us. Well then,\r\nthe sooner the better. I am fair wearying for a certain day that is near\r\nat hand."\r\n\r\nWith which he began to hum "The King shall have his own again."\r\n\r\nI flushed, and boggled at the "No!" that stuck in my throat. Creagh,\r\nstanding near, slewed round his head at the word.\r\n\r\n"Eh, what\'s that? Say that again, Montagu!"\r\n\r\nI took the bull by the horns and answered bluntly, "There has been a\r\nmistake made. George is a good enough king for me."\r\n\r\nI saw Macdonald stiffen, and angry amazement leap to the eyes of the two\r\nIrishmen.\r\n\r\n"\'Sblood! What the devil! Why are you here then?" cried Creagh.\r\n\r\nHis words, and the excitement in his raised voice, rang the bell for a\r\nhush over the noisy room. Men dropped their talk and turned to us. A score\r\nof fierce suspicious eyes burnt into me. My heart thumped against my ribs\r\nlike a thing alive, but I answered--steadily and quietly enough, I dare\r\nsay--"You will have to ask Lord Balmerino that. I did not know where he\r\nwas bringing me."\r\n\r\n"Damnation!" cried one Leath. "What cock and bull tale is this? Not know\r\nwhere he was bringing you! \'Slife, I do not like it!"\r\n\r\nI sat on the table negligently dangling one foot in air. For that matter I\r\ndidn\'t like it myself, but I was not going to tell him so. Brushing a\r\nspeck of mud from my coat I answered carelessly,\r\n\r\n"Like it or mislike it, devil a bit I care!"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! I theenk you will find a leetle reason for caring," said the\r\nFrenchman ominously.\r\n\r\n"Stab me, if I understand," cried Creagh. "Balmerino did not kidnap you\r\nhere, did he? Devil take me if it\'s at all clear to me!"\r\n\r\nO\'Sullivan pushed to the front with an evil laugh.\r\n\r\n"\'T is clear enough to me," he said bluntly. "It\'s the old story of one\r\ntoo many trusted. He hears our plans and then the smug-faced villain\r\npeaches. Next week he sees us all scragged at Tyburn. But he\'s made a\r\nlittle mistake this time, sink me! He won\'t live to see the Chevalier\r\nO\'Sullivan walk off the cart. If you\'ll give me leave, I\'ll put a name to\r\nthe gentleman. He\'s what they call a spy, and stap my vitals! he doesn\'t\r\nleave this room alive."\r\n\r\nAt his words a fierce cry leaped from tense throats. A circle of white\r\nfurious faces girdled me about. Rapiers hung balanced at my throat and\r\ndeath looked itchingly at me from many an eye.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I lazed against the table with a strange odd contraction of the\r\nheart, a sudden standing still and then a fierce pounding of the blood.\r\nYet I was quite master of myself. Indeed I smiled at them, carelessly, as\r\none that deprecated so much ado about nothing. And while I smiled, the\r\nwonder was passing through my mind whether the smile would still be there\r\nafter they had carved the life out of me. I looked death in the face, and\r\nI found myself copying unconsciously the smirking manners of the\r\nMacaronis. Faith, \'t was a leaf from Volney\'s life I was rehearsing for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis but while one might blink an eye, then Lord Balmerino interrupted.\r\n"God\'s my life! Here\'s a feery-farry about nothing. Put up your toasting\r\nfork, De Vallery! The lad will not bite."\r\n\r\n"Warranted to be of gentle manners," I murmured, brushing again at the\r\nMechlin lace of my coat.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen are requested not to tease the animals," laughed Creagh. He was\r\nas full of heat as a pepper castor, but he had the redeeming humour of his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nMacdonald beat down the swords. "Are you a\' daft, gentlemen? The lad came\r\nwith Balmerino. He is no spy. Put up, put up, Chevalier! Don\'t glower at\r\nme like that, man! Hap-weel rap-weel, the lad shall have his chance to\r\nexplain. I will see no man\'s cattle hurried."\r\n\r\n"Peste! Let him explain then, and not summer and winter over the story,"\r\nretorted O\'Sullivan sourly.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino slipped an arm through mine. "If you are quite through with\r\nyour play acting, gentlemen, we will back to reason and common sense\r\nagain. Mr. Montagu may not be precisely a pronounced Jack, but then he\r\ndoesn\'t give a pinch of snuff for the Whigs either. I think we shall find\r\nhim open to argument."\r\n\r\n"He\'d better be--if he knows what\'s good for him," growled O\'Sullivan.\r\n\r\nAt once I grew obstinate. "I do not take my politics under compulsion, Mr.\r\nO\'Sullivan," I flung out.\r\n\r\n"Then you shouldn\'t have come here. You\'ve drawn the wine, and by God! you\r\nshall drink it."\r\n\r\n"Shall I? We\'ll see."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Kenn! I promise you there shall be no compulsion," cried the old\r\nLord. Then to O\'Sullivan in a stern whisper, "Let be, you blundering Irish\r\nman! You\'re setting him against us."\r\n\r\nBalmerino was right. Every moment I grew colder and stiffer. If they\r\nwanted me for a recruit they were going about it the wrong way. I would\r\nnot be frightened into joining them.\r\n\r\n"Like the rest of us y\' are a ruined man. Come, better your fortune. Duty\r\nand pleasure jump together. James Montagu\'s son is not afraid to take a\r\nchance," urged the Scotch Lord.\r\n\r\nDonald Roy\'s eyes had fastened on me from the first like the grip-of\r\nsteel. He had neither moved nor spoken, but I knew that he was weighing me\r\nin the balance.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will not be exactly in love with the wamey Dutchmen, Mr.\r\nMontagu?" he asked now.\r\n\r\nI smiled. "If you put it that way I don\'t care one jack straw for the\r\nwhole clamjamfry of them."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking so. They are a different race from the Stuarts."\r\n\r\n"They are indeed," I acquiesced dryly. Then the devil of mischief stirred\r\nin me to plague him. "There\'s all the difference of bad and a vast deal\r\nworse between them. It\'s a matter of comparisons," I concluded easily.\r\n\r\n"You are pleased to be facetious," returned O\'Sullivan sourly. "But I\r\nwould ask you to remember that you are not yet out of the woods, Mr.\r\nMontagu. My Lord seems satisfied, but here are some more of us waiting a\r\nplain answer to this riddle."\r\n\r\n"And what may the riddle be?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Just this. What are you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Faith, that\'s easy answered," I told him jauntily. "I\'m here by\r\ninvitation of Lord Balmerino, and it seems I\'m not overwelcome."\r\n\r\nElphinstone interrupted impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen, we\'re at cross purposes. You\'re trying to drive Mr. Montagu,\r\nand I\'m all for leading him. I warn you he\'s not to be driven. Let us talk\r\nit over reasonably."\r\n\r\n"Very well," returned O\'Sullivan sulkily. "Talk as long as you please, but\r\nhe doesn\'t get out of this room till I\'m satisfied."\r\n\r\n"We are engaged on a glorious enterprise to restore to these islands their\r\nancient line of sovereigns. You say you do not care for the Hanoverians.\r\nWhy not then strike a blow for the right cause?" asked Leath.\r\n\r\n"Right and wrong are not to be divided by so clean a cut," I told him. "I\r\nam no believer in the divine inheritance of kings. In the last analysis\r\nthe people shall be the judge."\r\n\r\n"Of course; and we are going to put it to the test."\r\n\r\n"You want to set the clock back sixty years. It will not do."\r\n\r\n"We think it will. We are resolved at least to try," said Balmerino.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. "The times are against you. The Stuarts have\r\ndropped out of the race. The mill cannot grind with the water that is\r\npast."\r\n\r\n"And if the water be not past?" asked Leath fiercely.\r\n\r\n"Mar found it so in the \'15, and many honest gentlemen paid for his\r\nmistake with their heads. My father\'s brother for one."\r\n\r\n"Mar bungled it from start to finish. He had the game in his own hands and\r\ndribbled away his chances like a coward and a fool."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, but even so, much water has passed under London Bridge since\r\nthen. It is sixty years since the Stuarts were driven out. Two generations\r\nhave slept on it."\r\n\r\n"Then the third generation of sleepers shall be wakened. The stream is\r\ncoming down in spate," said Balmerino.\r\n\r\n"I hear you say it," I answered dryly.\r\n\r\n"And you shall live to see us do it, Mr. Montagu. The heather\'s in a blaze\r\nalready. The fiery cross will be speeding from Badenoch to the Braes of\r\nBalwhidder. The clans will all rise whatever," cried Donald Roy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure about Mr. Montagu living to see it. My friends O\'Sullivan\r\nand De Vallery seem to think not," said Creagh, giving me his odd smile.\r\n"Now, I\'ll wager a crown that----"\r\n\r\n"Whose crown did you say?" I asked politely, handing him back his smile.\r\n\r\n"The government cannot stand out against us," argued Balmerino. "The Duke\r\nof Newcastle is almost an imbecile. The Dutch usurper himself is over in\r\nHanover courting a new mistress. His troops are all engaged in foreign\r\nwar. There are not ten thousand soldiers on the island. At this very\r\nmoment the King of France is sending fifteen thousand across in\r\ntransports. He will have no difficulty in landing them and London cannot\r\nhold out."\r\n\r\n"Faith, he might get his army here. I\'m not denying that. But I\'ll promise\r\nhim trouble in getting it away again."\r\n\r\n"The Highlands are ready to fling away the scabbard for King James III,"\r\nsaid Donald Roy simply.\r\n\r\n"It is in my mind that you have done that more than once before and that\r\nbecause of it misguided heads louped from sturdy shoulders," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Wales too is full of loyal gentlemen. What can the Hanoverians do if they\r\nmarch across the border to join the Highlanders rolling down from the\r\nNorth and Marshal Saxe with his French army?"\r\n\r\n"My imagination halts," I answered dryly. "You will be telling me next\r\nthat England is wearying for a change back to the race of Kings she has\r\ntwice driven out."\r\n\r\n"I do say it," cried Leath. "Bolingbroke is already negotiating with the\r\nroyal family. Newcastle is a broken reed. Hervey will not stand out.\r\nWalpole is a dying man. In whom can the Dutchman trust? The nation is\r\ntired of them, their mistresses and their German brood."\r\n\r\n"When we had them we found these same Stuarts a dangerous and troublesome\r\nrace. We could not in any manner get along with them. We drove them out,\r\nand then nothing would satisfy us but we must have them back again. Well,\r\nthey had their second chance, and we found them worse than before. They\r\nhad not learnt the lesson of the age. They----"\r\n\r\n"Split me, y\'are not here to lecture us, Mr. Montagu," cried Leath with\r\nangry eye. "Damme, we don\'t care a rap for your opinions, but you have\r\nheard too much. To be short, the question is, will you join us or won\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"To be short then, Mr. Leath, not on compulsion."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no compulsion about it, Kenn. If you join it is of your own free\r\nwill," said Balmerino.\r\n\r\n"I think not. Mr. Montagu has no option in the matter," cried O\'Sullivan.\r\n"He forfeited his right to decide for himself when he blundered in and\r\nheard our plans. Willy nilly, he must join us!"\r\n\r\n"And if I don\'t?"\r\n\r\nHis smile was like curdled milk. "Have you made your will, Mr. Montagu?"\r\n\r\n"I made it at the gaming table last night, and the Chevalier O\'Sullivan\r\nwas one of the legatees," I answered like a flash.\r\n\r\n"Touch\xc3\xa9, Sully," laughed Creagh. "Ecod, I like our young cockerel\'s\r\nspirit."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t," returned O\'Sullivan. "He shall join us, or damme----" He\r\nstopped, but his meaning was plain to be read.\r\n\r\nI answered dourly. "You may blow the coals, but I will not be het."\r\n\r\n"Faith, you\'re full of epigrams to-night, Mr. Montagu," Anthony Creagh was\r\ngood enough to say. "You\'ll make a fine stage exit--granting that Sully\r\nhas his way. I wouldn\'t miss it for a good deal."\r\n\r\n"If the house is crowded you may have my seat for nothing," was my reply.\r\nStrange to say my spirits were rising. This was the first perilous\r\nadventure of my life, and my heart sang. Besides, I had confidence enough\r\nin Balmerino to know that he would never stand aside and let me suffer for\r\nhis indiscretion if he could help it.\r\n\r\nThe old Lord\'s troubled eyes looked into mine. I think he was beginning to\r\nregret this impulsive experiment of his. He tried a new tack with me.\r\n\r\n"Of course there is a risk. We may not win. Perhaps you do well to think\r\nof the consequences. As you say, heads may fall because of the rising."\r\n\r\nThe dye flooded my cheeks.\r\n\r\n"You might have spared me that, my Lord. I am thinking of the blood of\r\ninnocent people that must be spilled."\r\n\r\n"Your joining us will neither help nor hinder that."\r\n\r\n"And your not joining us will have deucedly unpleasant effects for you,"\r\nsuggested O\'Sullivan pleasantly.\r\n\r\nLord Balmerino flung round on him angrily, his hand on sword hilt. "I\r\nthink you have forgotten one thing, Mr. O\'Sullivan."\r\n\r\n"And that is----?"\r\n\r\n"That Mr. Montagu came here as my guest. If he does not care to join us he\r\nshall be free as air to depart."\r\n\r\nO\'Sullivan laughed hardily. "Shall he? Gadzooks! The Chevalier O\'Sullivan\r\nwill have a word to say with him first. He did not come as any guest of\r\nmine. What the devil! If you were not sure of him, why did you bring\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\nBalmerino fumed, but he had no answer for that. He could only say,--\r\n\r\n"I thought him sure to join, but I can answer for his silence with my\r\nlife."\r\n\r\n"\'T will be more to the point that we do not answer for his speech with\r\nour lives," grumbled Leath.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman leaned forward eagerly. "You thought heem to be at heart of\r\nus, and you were meestaken; you theenk heem sure to keep our secret, but\r\nhow are we to know you are not again meestaken?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, that\'s easy," broke out O\'Sullivan scornfully. "We\'ll know when the\r\nrope is round our gullets."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he won\'t peach, Sully. He isn\'t that kind. Stap me, you never know a\r\ngentleman when you see one," put in Creagh carelessly.\r\n\r\nThe young Highlander Macdonald spoke up. "Gentlemen, I\'m all for making an\r\nend to this collieshangie. By your leave, Lord Balmerino, Mr. Creagh and\r\nmyself will step up-stairs with this gentleman and come to some\r\ncomposition on the matter. Mr. Montagu saved my life last night, but I\r\ngive you the word of Donald Roy Macdonald that if I am not satisfied in\r\nthe end I will plant six inches of steel in his wame for him to digest,\r\nand there\'s gumption for you at all events."\r\n\r\nHe said it as composedly as if he had been proposing a stroll down the Row\r\nwith me, and I knew him to be just the man who would keep his word. The\r\nothers knew it too, and presently we four found ourselves alone together\r\nin a room above.\r\n\r\n"Is your mind so set against joining us, Kenn? I have got myself into a\r\npickle, and I wish you would just get me out," Balmerino began.\r\n\r\n"If they had asked me civilly I dare say I should have said \'Yes!\' an hour\r\nago, but I\'ll not be forced in."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, too. You\'re a broth of a boy. I wouldn\'t in your place,\r\nMontagu, and I take off my hat to your spirit," said Creagh. "Now let\'s\r\nbegin again."--He went to the door and threw it open.--"The way is clear\r\nfor you to leave if you want to go, but I would be most happy to have you\r\nstay with us. It\'s men like you we\'re looking for, and-- Won\'t you strike\r\na blow for the King o\'er the sea, Montagu?"\r\n\r\n"He is of the line of our ancient monarchs. He and his race have ruled us\r\na thousand years," urged Balmerino. "They have had their faults\r\nperhaps----"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," I smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, and if they have," cried Donald Roy hotly in the impetuous Highland\r\nway. "Is this a time to be remembering them? For my part, I will be\r\nforgetting their past faults and minding only their present distresses."\r\n\r\n"It appears as easy for a Highlander to forget the faults of the Stuarts\r\nas it is for them to forget his services," I told him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you harp on their faults. Have you none of your own?" cried\r\nElphinstone impatiently. "I have seen and talked with the young Prince. He\r\nis one to follow to the death. I have never met the marrow of him."\r\n\r\n"I think of the thousands who will lose their lives for him."\r\n\r\n"Well, and that\'s a driech subject, too, but Donald Roy would a hantle\r\nrather die with claymore in hand and the whiddering steel aboot his head\r\nthan be always fearing to pay the piper," said the young Highlander\r\nblithely.\r\n\r\n"Your father was out for the King in the \'15," said Balmerino gently.\r\n\r\nOh, Arthur Elphinstone had the guile for all his rough ways. I was moved\r\nmore than I cared to own. Many a time I had sat at my father\'s knee and\r\nlistened to the tale of "the \'15." The Highland blood in me raced the\r\nquicker through my veins. All the music of the heather hills and the\r\nwimpling burns wooed me to join my kinsmen in the North. My father\'s\r\nexample, his brother\'s blood, loyalty to the traditions of my family, my\r\nempty purse, the friendship of Balmerino and Captain Macdonald, all tugged\r\nat my will; but none of them were so potent as the light that shone in the\r\neyes of a Highland lassie I had never met till one short hour before. I\r\ntossed aside all my scruples and took the leap.\r\n\r\n"Come!" I cried. "Lend yourselves to me on a mission of some danger for\r\none night and I will pledge myself a partner in your enterprise. I can\r\npromise you that the help I ask of you may be honourably given. A fair\r\nexchange is no robbery. What say you?"\r\n\r\n"Gad\'s life, I cry agreed. You\'re cheap at the price, Mr. Montagu. I\'m\r\nyours, Rip me, if you want me to help rum-pad a bishop\'s coach," exclaimed\r\nthe Irishman.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Creagh has just taken the words out of my mouth," cried Donald Roy.\r\n"If you\'re wanting to lift a lassie or to carry the war to a foe I\'ll be\r\nblithe to stand at your back. You may trust Red Donald for that\r\nwhatever."\r\n\r\n"You put your finger on my ambitions, Captain Macdonald. I\'m wanting to do\r\njust those two things. You come to scratch so readily that I hope you have\r\nhad some practice of your own," I laughed.\r\n\r\nThere was wine on the table and I filled the glasses.\r\n\r\n"If no other sword leaves scabbard mine shall," I cried in a flame of\r\nnew-born enthusiasm. "Gentlemen, I give you the King over the water."\r\n\r\n"King James! God bless him," echoed Balmerino and Creagh.\r\n\r\n"Deoch slaint an Righ! (The King\'s Drink). And win or lose, we shall have\r\na beautiful time of it whatever," cried Donald gaily.\r\n\r\nAn hour later Kenneth Montagu, Jacobite, walked home arm in arm with\r\nAnthony Creagh and Donald Roy Macdonald. He was setting forth to them a\r\ntale of an imprisoned maid and a plan for the rescue of that same lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOF LOVE AND WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAll day the rain had splashed down with an unusual persistence, but now\r\nthere was a rising wind and a dash of clear sky over to the south which\r\npromised fairer weather. I was blithe to see it, for we had our night\'s\r\nwork cut out for us and a driving storm would not add to our comfort.\r\n\r\nFrom my hat, from the elbows of my riding-coat, and from my boot-heels\r\nconstant rivulets ran; but I took pains to keep the pistols under my\r\ndoublet dry as toast. At the courtyard of the inn I flung myself from my\r\nhorse and strode to the taproom where my companions awaited me. In truth\r\nthey were making the best of their circumstances. A hot water jug steamed\r\nin front of the hearth where Creagh lolled in a big armchair. At the table\r\nCaptain Macdonald was compounding a brew by the aid of lemons, spices, and\r\nbrandy. They looked the picture of content, and I stood streaming in the\r\ndoorway a moment to admire the scene.\r\n\r\n"What luck, Montagu?" asked Creagh.\r\n\r\n"They\'re at \'The Jolly Soldier\' all right _en route_ for Epsom," I told\r\nhim. "Arrived a half hour before I left. Hamish Gorm is hanging about\r\nthere to let us know when they start. Volney has given orders for a fresh\r\nrelay of horses, so they are to continue their journey to-night."\r\n\r\n"And the lady?"\r\n\r\n"The child looks like an angel of grief. She is quite out of hope. Faith,\r\nher despair took me by the heart."\r\n\r\n"My certes! I dare swear it," returned Donald Roy dryly. "And did you make\r\nyourself known to her?"\r\n\r\n"No, she went straight to her room. Volney has given it out that the lady\r\nis his wife and is demented. His man Watkins spreads the report broadcast\r\nto forestall any appeal she may make for help. I talked with the valet in\r\nthe stables. He had much to say about how dearly his master and his\r\nmistress loved each other, and what a pity \'twas that the lady has lately\r\nfallen out of her mind by reason of illness. \'Twas the one thing that\r\nspoilt the life of Mr. Armitage, who fairly dotes on his sweet lady. Lud,\r\nyes! And one of her worst delusions is that he is not really her husband\r\nand that he wishes to harm her. Oh, they have contrived well their\r\nprecious story to avoid outside interference."\r\n\r\nI found more than one cause to doubt the fortunate issue of the enterprise\r\nupon which we were engaged. Volney might take the other road; or he might\r\npostpone his journey on account of the foul weather. Still other\r\ncontingencies rose to my mind, but Donald Roy and Creagh made light of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Havers! If he is the man you have drawn for me he will never be letting a\r\nsmirr of rain interfere with his plans; and as for the other road, it will\r\nbe a river in spate by this time," the Highlander reassured me.\r\n\r\n"Sure, I\'ll give you four to one in ponies the thing does not miscarry,"\r\ncried Creagh in his rollicking way. "After the King comes home I\'ll dance\r\nat your wedding, me boy; and here\'s to Mrs. Montagu that is to be,\r\nbedad!"\r\n\r\nMy wildest dreams had never carried me so far as this yet, and I flushed\r\nto my wig at his words; but the wild Irishman only laughed at my\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\n"Faith man, \'tis you or I! \'Twould never do for three jolly blades like us\r\nto steal the lady from her lover and not offer another in exchange. No,\r\nno! Castle Creagh is crying for a mistress, and if you don\'t spunk up to\r\nthe lady Tony Creagh will."\r\n\r\nTo his humour of daffing I succumbed, and fell into an extraordinary ease\r\nwith the world. Here I sat in a snug little tavern with the two most\r\ntaking comrades in the world drinking a hot punch brewed to a nicety,\r\nwhile outside the devil of a storm roared and screamed.\r\n\r\nAs for my companions, they were old campaigners, not to be ruffled by the\r\nslings of envious fortune. Captain Donald Roy was wont to bear with\r\ncomposure good luck and ill, content to sit him down whistling on the\r\nsodden heath to eat his mouthful of sour brose with the same good humour\r\nhe would have displayed at a gathering of his clan gentlemen where the\r\ntable groaned with usquebaugh, mountain trout, and Highland venison.\r\nCreagh\'s philosophy too was all for taking what the gods sent and leaving\r\nuncrossed bridges till the morrow. Was the weather foul? Sure, the sun\r\nwould soon shine, and what was a cloak for but to keep out the rain? I\r\nnever knew him lose his light gay spirits, and I have seen him at many an\r\nevil pass.\r\n\r\nThe clatter of a horse\'s hoofs in the courtyard put a period to our\r\nfestivities. Presently rug-headed Hamish Gorm entered, a splash of mud\r\nfrom brogues to bonnet.\r\n\r\n"What news, Hamish? Has Volney started?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"She would be leaving directly. Ta Sassenach iss in ta carriage with ta\r\ndaughter of Macleod, and he will be a fery goot man to stick a dirk in\r\nwhatefer," fumed the gillie.\r\n\r\nI caught him roughly by the shoulder. "There will be no dirk play this\r\nnight, Hamish Gorm. Do you hear that? It will be left for your betters to\r\nsettle with this man, and if you cannot remember that you will just stay\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nHe muttered sullenly that he would remember, but it was a great pity if\r\nHamish Gorm could not avenge the wrongs of the daughter of his chief.\r\n\r\nWe rode for some miles along a cross country path where the mud was so\r\ndeep that the horses sank to their fetlocks. The wind had driven away the\r\nrain and the night had cleared overhead. There were still scudding clouds\r\nscouring across the face of the moon, but the promise was for a clear\r\nnight. We reached the Surrey road and followed it along the heath till we\r\ncame to the shadow of three great oaks. Many a Dick Turpin of the road had\r\nlurked under the drooping boughs of these same trees and sallied out to\r\nthe hilltop with his ominous cry of "Stand and deliver!" Many a jolly\r\ngrazier and fat squire had yielded up his purse at this turn of the road.\r\nFor a change we meant to rum-pad a baronet, and I flatter myself we made\r\nas dashing a trio of cullies as any gentlemen of the heath among them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a half hour after we had taken our stand that the\r\nrumbling of a coach came to our ears. The horses were splashing through\r\nthe mud, plainly making no great speed. Long before we saw the chaise, the\r\ncries of the postilions urging on the horses were to be heard. After an\r\ninterminable period the carriage swung round the turn of the road and\r\nbegan to take the rise. We caught the postilion at disadvantage as he was\r\nflogging the weary animals up the brow of the hill. He looked up and\r\ncaught sight of us.\r\n\r\n"Out of the way, fellows," he cried testily. Next instant he slipped to\r\nthe ground and disappeared in the darkness, crying "\'Ware highwaymen!" In\r\nthe shine of the coach lamps he had seen Creagh\'s mask and pistol. The\r\nvalet Watkins, sitting on the box, tried to lash up the leaders, but\r\nMacdonald blocked the way with his horse, what time the Irishman and I\r\ngave our attention to the occupants of the chaise.\r\n\r\nAt the first cry of the postilion a bewigged powdered head had been thrust\r\nfrom the window and immediately withdrawn. Now I dismounted and went\r\nforward to open the door. From the corner of the coach into which Aileen\r\nMacleod had withdrawn a pair of bright eager eyes looked into my face, but\r\nno Volney was to be seen. The open door opposite explained his\r\ndisappearance. I raised the mask a moment from my face, and the girl gave\r\na cry of joy.\r\n\r\n"Did you think I had deserted you?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I did not know. I wass thinking that perhaps he had killed you. I\r\nwill be thanking God that you are alive," she cried, with a sweet little\r\nlift and tremble to her voice that told me tears were near.\r\n\r\nA shot rang out, and then another.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me for a moment. I had forgot the gentleman," I said, hastily\r\nwithdrawing my head.\r\n\r\nAs I ran round the back of the coach I came plump into Volney. Though\r\ndressed to make love and not war, I\'ll do him the justice to say that one\r\nwas as welcome to him as the other. He was shining in silver satin and\r\nblue silk and gold lace, but in each hand he carried a great horse pistol,\r\none of which was still smoking at the barrel. The other he pointed at me,\r\nbut with my sword I thrust up the point and it went off harmlessly in the\r\nair. Then I flung him from me and covered him with my barker. Creagh also\r\nwas there to emphasize the wisdom of discretion. Sir Robert Volney was as\r\ndaring a man as ever lived, but he was no fool neither. He looked at my\r\nweapon shining on him in the moonlight and quietly conceded to himself\r\nthat the game was against him for the moment. From his fingers he slipped\r\nthe rings, and the watch from his pocket-coat. To carry out our pretension\r\nI took them and filled my pockets with his jewelry.\r\n\r\n"A black night, my cullies," said Volney as easy as you please.\r\n\r\n"The colour of your business," I retorted thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\nHe started, looking at me very sharp.\r\n\r\n"Else you would not be travelling on such a night," I explained lamely.\r\n\r\n"Ah! I think we will not discuss my business. As it happens, the lady has\r\nno jewelry with her. If you are quite through with us, my good fellows,\r\nwe\'ll wish you a pleasant evening. Watkins, where\'s that d--d postilion?"\r\n\r\n"Softly, Sir Robert! The night\'s young yet. Will you not spare us fifteen\r\nminutes while the horses rest?" proposed Creagh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you put it that way," he answered negligently, his agile mind busy\r\nwith the problem before him. I think he began to put two and two together.\r\nMy words might have been a chance shot, but when on the heel of them\r\nCreagh let slip his name Volney did not need to be told that we were not\r\nregular fly-by-nights. His eyes and his ears were intent to pierce our\r\ndisguises.\r\n\r\n"Faith, my bullies, you deserve success if you operate on such nights as\r\nthis. An honest living were easier come by, but Lard! not so enticing by a\r\ndeal. Your enterprise is worthy of commendation, and I would wager a pony\r\nagainst a pinch of snuff that some day you\'ll be raised to a high position\r\nby reason of it. How is it the old catch runs?\r\n\r\n               "\'And three merry men, and three merry men,\r\n                 And three merry men are we,\r\n               As ever did sing three parts in a string,\r\n                 All under the gallows tree.\'\r\n\r\n"If I have to get up in the milkman hours, begad, when that day comes I\'ll\r\nmake it a point to be at Tyburn to see your promotion over the heads of\r\nhumdrum honest folks," he drawled, and at the tail of his speech yawned in\r\nour faces.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll send you cards to the entertainment when that happy day arrives,"\r\nlaughed Creagh, delighted of course at the aplomb of the Macaroni.\r\n\r\nDonald Roy came up to ask what should be done with Watkins. It appeared\r\nthat Volney had mistaken him for one of us and let fly at him. The fellow\r\nlay groaning on the ground as if he were on the edge of expiration. I\r\nstooped and examined him. \'Twas a mere flesh scratch.\r\n\r\n"Nothing the matter but a punctured wing. All he needs is a kerchief round\r\nhis arm," I said.\r\n\r\nCaptain Macdonald looked disgusted and a little relieved.\r\n\r\n"\'Fore God, he deaved (deafened) me with his yammering till I thought him\r\nabout to ship for the other world. These Englishers make a geyan work\r\nabout nothing."\r\n\r\nFor the moment remembrance of Volney had slipped from our minds. As I rose\r\nto my feet he stepped forward. Out flashed his sword and ripped the mask\r\nfrom my face.\r\n\r\n"Egad, I thought so," he chuckled. "My young friend Montagu repairing his\r\nfallen fortunes on the road! Won\'t you introduce me to the other\r\ngentlemen, or would they rather remain incog? Captain Claude Duval, your\r\nmost obedient! Sir Dick Turpin, yours to command! Delighted, \'pon my word,\r\nto be rum-padded by such distinguished--er--knights of the road."\r\n\r\n"The honour is ours," answered Creagh gravely, returning his bow, but the\r\nIrishman\'s devil-may-care eyes were dancing.\r\n\r\n"A strange fortuity, in faith, that our paths have crossed so often of\r\nlate, Montagu. Now I would lay something good that our life lines will not\r\ncross more than once more."\r\n\r\n"Why should we meet at all again?" I cried. "Here is a piece of good turf\r\nunder the moonlight. \'Twere a pity to lose it."\r\n\r\nHe appeared to consider. "As you say, the turf is all that is to be\r\ndesired and the light will suffice. Why not? We get in each other\'s way\r\nconfoundedly, and out of doubt will some day have to settle our little\r\ndifference. Well then, if \'twere done \'twere well done quickly. Faith, Mr.\r\nMontagu, y\'are a man after my own heart, and it gives me a vast deal of\r\npleasure to accept your proposal. Consider me your most obedient to\r\ncommand and prodigiously at your service."\r\n\r\nRaffish and flamboyant, he lounged forward to the window of the carriage.\r\n\r\n"I beg a thousand pardons, sweet, for leaving you a few minutes alone," he\r\nsaid with his most silken irony. "I am desolated at the necessity, but\r\nthis gentleman has a claim that cannot be ignored. Believe me, I shall\r\nmake the absence very short. Dear my life, every instant that I am from\r\nyou is snatched from Paradise. Fain would I be with you alway, but stern\r\nduty"--the villain stopped to draw a plaintive and theatric sigh--"calls\r\nme to attend once for all to a matter of small moment. Anon I shall be\r\nwith you, life of my life."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as if he were the dirt beneath her feet, and still he\r\nsmiled his winsome smile, carrying on the mock pretense that she was\r\ndevoted to him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, sweet my heart!" he murmured. "\'Twere cheap to die for such a loving\r\nlook from thee. All Heaven lies in it. \'Tis better far to live for many\r\nmore of such."\r\n\r\nThere was a rush of feet and a flash of steel. Donald Roy leaped forward\r\njust in time, and next moment Hamish Gorm lay stretched on the turf,\r\nmuttering Gaelic oaths and tearing at the sod with his dirk in an impotent\r\nrage. Sir Robert looked down at the prostrate man with his inscrutable\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Your friend from the Highlands is in a vast hurry, Montagu. He can\'t even\r\nwait till you have had your chance to carve me. Well, are you ready to\r\nbegin the argument?"\r\n\r\n"Quite at your command. There is a bit of firm turf beyond the oaks. If\r\nyou will lead the way I shall be with you anon."\r\n\r\n"Lud! I had forgot. You have your adieux to make to the lady. Pray do not\r\nlet me hurry you," he said urbanely, as he picked his way daintily through\r\nthe mud.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone I turned to the girl.\r\n\r\n"You shall be quit of him," I told her. "You may rely on my friends if--if\r\nthe worst happens. They will take you to Montagu Grange, and my brother\r\nCharles will push on with you to Scotland. In this country you would not\r\nbe safe from him while he lives."\r\n\r\nHer face was like the snow.\r\n\r\n"Iss there no other way whatever?" she cried. "Must you be fighting with\r\nthis man for me, and you only a boy? Oh, I could be wishing for my brother\r\nMalcolm or some of the good claymores on the braes of Raasay!"\r\n\r\nThe vanity in me was stung by her words.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not such a boy neither, and Angelo judged me a good pupil. You might\r\nfind a worse champion."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it iss the good friend you are to me, and I am loving you for it, but\r\nI think of what may happen to you."\r\n\r\nMy pulse leaped and my eyes burned, but I answered lightly,\r\n\r\n"For a change think of what may happen to him, and maybe to pass the time\r\nyou might put up a bit prayer for me."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, I will be doing that same," she cried with shining eyes, and\r\nbefore I divined her intent had stooped to kiss my hand that rested on the\r\ncoach door.\r\n\r\nMy heart lilted as I crossed the heath to where the others were waiting\r\nfor me beyond the dip of the hillock.\r\n\r\n"Faith, I began to think you had forgotten me and gone off with the lady\r\nyourself," laughed Volney.\r\n\r\nI flung off my cloak and my inner coat, for though the night was chill I\r\nknew I should be warm enough when once we got to work. Then, strangely\r\nenough, an unaccountable reluctance to engage came over me, and I stood\r\ntracing figures on the heath with the point of my small sword.\r\n\r\n"Are you ready?" asked the baronet.\r\n\r\nI broke out impetuously. "Sir Robert, you have ruined many. Your victims\r\nare to be counted by the score. I myself am one. But this girl shall not\r\nbe added to the list. I have sworn it; so have my friends. There is still\r\ntime for you to leave unhurt if you desire it, but if we once cross swords\r\none of us must die."\r\n\r\n"And, prithee, Mr. Montagu, why came we here?"\r\n\r\n"Yet even now if you will desist----"\r\n\r\nHis caustic insolent laugh rang out gaily as he mouthed the speech of\r\nTybalt in actor fashion.\r\n\r\n           "\'What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,\r\n           As I hate hell, all Montagus, and thee;\r\n           Have at thee, coward.\'"\r\n\r\nI drew back from his playful lunge.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Have it your own way. But you must have some one to act for\r\nyou. Perhaps Captain Mac--er--the gentleman on your right--will second\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nDonald Roy drew himself up haughtily. "Feint a bit of it! I\'m on the other\r\nside of the dyke. Man, Montagu! I\'m wondering at you, and him wronging a\r\nHieland lassie. Gin he waits till I stand back of him he\'ll go wantin\', ye\r\nmay lippen (trust) to that."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'ll have to be you, Tony," I said, turning to Creagh. "Guard, Sir\r\nRobert!"\r\n\r\n"\'Sdeath! You\'re getting in a hurry, Mr. Montagu. I see you\'re keen after\r\nthat \'Hic Jacet\' I promised you. Lard! I vow you shall have it."\r\n\r\nUnder the shifting moonlight we fell to work on the dripping heath. We\r\nwere not unevenly matched considering the time and the circumstances. I\r\nhad in my favour youth, an active life, and a wrist of steel. At least I\r\nwas a strong swordsman, even though I could not pretend to anything like\r\nthe mastery of the weapon which he possessed. To some extent his superior\r\nskill was neutralized by the dim light. He had been used to win his fights\r\nas much with his head as with his hand, to read his opponent\'s intention\r\nin advance from the eyes while he concealed his own; but the darkness,\r\ncombined with my wooden face, made this impossible now. Every turn and\r\ntrick of the game he knew, but the shifting shine and shadow disconcerted\r\nhim. More than once I heard him curse softly when at a critical moment the\r\nscudding clouds drifted across the moon in time to save me.\r\n\r\nHe had the better of me throughout, but somehow I blundered through\r\nwithout letting him find the chance for which he looked. I kept my head,\r\nand parried by sheer luck his brilliant lunges. I broke ground and won\r\nfree--if but barely--from his incessant attack. More than once he pricked\r\nme. A high thrust which I diverted too late with the parade of tierce drew\r\nblood freely. He fleshed me again on the riposte by a one-two feint in\r\ntierce and a thrust in carte.\r\n\r\n"\'L\'art de donner et de ne pas recevoir,\'" he quoted, as he parried my\r\ncounter-thrust with debonair ease.\r\n\r\nTry as I would I could not get behind that wonderful guard of his. It was\r\neasy, graceful, careless almost, but it was sure. His point was a gleaming\r\nflash of light, but it never wavered from my body line.\r\n\r\nA darker cloud obscured the moon, and by common consent we rested.\r\n\r\n"Three minutes for good-byes," said Volney, suggestively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my friends need not order the hearse yet--at least for me. Of course,\r\nif it would be any convenience----"\r\n\r\nHe laughed. "Faith, you improve on acquaintance, Mr. Montagu, like good\r\nwine or--to stick to the same colour--the taste of the lady\'s lips."\r\n\r\nI looked blackly at him. "Do you pretend----?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I pretend nothing. Kiss and never tell, egad! Too bad they\'re not for\r\nyou too, Montagu."\r\n\r\n"I see that Sir Robert Volney has added another accomplishment to his\r\nvices."\r\n\r\n"And that is----?"\r\n\r\n"He can couple a woman\'s name with the hint of a slanderous lie."\r\n\r\nSir Robert turned to Creagh and waved a hand at me, shaking his head\r\nsorrowfully. "The country boor in evidence again. Curious how it will crop\r\nout. Ah, Mr. Montagu! The moon shines bright again. Shall we have the\r\npleasure of renewing our little debate?"\r\n\r\nI nodded curtly. He stopped a moment to say:\r\n\r\n"You have a strong wrist and a prodigious good fence, Mr. Montagu, but if\r\nyou will pardon a word of criticism I think your guard too high."\r\n\r\n"Y\'are not here to instruct me, Sir Robert, but----"\r\n\r\n"To kill you. Quite so!" he interrupted jauntily. "Still, a friendly word\r\nof caution--and the guard _is_ overhigh! \'Tis the same fault my third had.\r\nI ran under it, and----" He shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Was that the boy you killed for defending his sister?" I asked\r\ninsolently.\r\n\r\nApparently my hit did not pierce the skin. "No. I\'ve forgot the nomination\r\nof the gentleman. What matter? He has long been food for worms. Pardon me,\r\nI see blood trickling down your sword arm. Allow me to offer my\r\nkerchief."\r\n\r\n"Thanks! \'Twill do as it is. Art ready?"\r\n\r\n"Lard, yes! And guard lower, an you love me. The high guard is the one\r\nfault-- Well parried, Montagu!--I find in Angelo\'s pupils. Correcting\r\nthat, you would have made a rare swordsman in time."\r\n\r\nHis use of the subjunctive did not escape me. "I\'m not dead yet," I\r\npanted.\r\n\r\nI parried a feint une-deux, in carte, with the parade in semicircle, and\r\nhe came over my blade, thrusting low in carte. His laugh rang out clear as\r\na boy\'s, and the great eyes of the man blazed with the joy of fight.\r\n\r\n"Gad, you\'re quick to take my meaning! Ah! You nearly began the long\r\njourney that time, my friend."\r\n\r\nHe had broken ground apparently in disorder, and by the feel of his sword\r\nI made sure he had in mind to parry; but the man was as full of tricks as\r\nthe French King Louis and with incredible swiftness he sent a straight\r\nthrust in high tierce--a thrust which sharply stung my ribs only, since I\r\nhad flung myself aside in time to save my vitals.\r\n\r\nAfter that came the end. He caught me full and fair in the side of the\r\nneck. A moist stifling filled my throat and the turf whirled up to meet\r\nthe sky. I knew nothing but a mad surge of rage that he had cut me to\r\npieces and I had never touched him once. As I went down I flung myself\r\nforward at him wildly. It is to be supposed that he was off guard for the\r\nmoment, supposing me a man already dead. My blade slipped along his,\r\nlurched farther forward, at last struck something soft and ripped down. A\r\nhundred crimson points zigzagged before my eyes, and I dropped down into\r\nunconsciousness in a heap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE HUE AND CRY\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguidly I came back to a world that faded and grew clear again most\r\npuzzlingly, that danced and jerked to and fro in oddly irresponsible\r\nfashion. At first too deadly weary to explain the situation to myself, I\r\npresently made out that I was in a coach which lurched prodigiously and\r\nfilled me with sharp pains. Fronting me was the apparently lifeless body\r\nof a man propped in the corner with the head against the cushions, the\r\nwhite face grinning horridly at me. \'Twas the face of Volney. I stirred to\r\nget it out of my line of vision, and a soft, firm hand restrained me\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n"You are not to be stirring," a sweet voice said. Then to herself its\r\nowner added, ever so softly and so happily, "Thaing do Dhia (Thank God.)\r\nHe iss alive--he iss alive!"\r\n\r\nI pointed feebly a leaden finger at the white face over against me with\r\nthe shine of the moon on it.\r\n\r\n"Dead?"\r\n\r\n"No. He hass just fainted. You are not to talk!"\r\n\r\n"And Donald Roy----?"\r\n\r\nThe imperious little hand slipped down to cover my mouth, and Kenneth\r\nMontagu kissed it where it lay. For a minute she did not lift the hand,\r\nwhat time I lay in a dream of warm happiness. A chuckle from the opposite\r\nseat aroused me. The eyes in the colourless face had opened, and Volney\r\nsat looking at us with an ironic smile.\r\n\r\n"I must have fallen asleep--and before a lady. A thousand apologies! And\r\nfor awaking so inopportunely, ten thousand more!"\r\n\r\nHe changed his position that he might look the easier at her, a\r\nhalf-humorous admiration in his eyes. "Sweet, you beggar my vocabulary. As\r\nthe goddess of healing you are divine."\r\n\r\nThe flush of alarmed maiden modesty flooded her cheek.\r\n\r\n"You are to lie still, else the wound will break out again," she said\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n"Faith, it has broken out," he feebly laughed, pretending to\r\nmisunderstand. Then, "Oh, you mean the sword cut. \'Twould never open after\r\nit has been dressed by so fair a leech."\r\n\r\nThe girl looked studiously out of the coach window and made no answer.\r\nNow, weak as I was--in pain and near to death, my head on her lap with her\r\ndear hand to cool my fevered brow--yet was I fool enough to grow insanely\r\njealous that she had used her kerchief to bind his wound. His pale,\r\nhandsome face was so winning and his eyes so beautiful that they thrust me\r\nthrough the heart as his sword had been unable to do.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with an odd sort of friendliness, the respect one man has\r\nfor another who has faced death without flinching.\r\n\r\n"Egad, Montagu, had either of us driven but a finger\'s breadth to left we\r\nhad made sure work and saved the doctors a vast deal of pother. I doubt\r\n\'twill be all to do over again one day. Where did you learn that mad lunge\r\nof yours? I vow \'tis none of Angelo\'s teaching. No defense would avail\r\nagainst such a fortuitous stroke. Methought I had you speeding to kingdom\r\ncome, and Lard! you skewered me bravely. \'Slife, \'tis an uncertain world,\r\nthis! Here we ride back together to the inn and no man can say which of us\r\nhas more than he can carry."\r\n\r\nAll this with his easy dare-devil smile, though his voice was faint from\r\nweakness. An odd compound of virtues and vices this man! I learnt\r\nafterwards that he had insisted on my wounds being dressed before he would\r\nlet them touch him, though he was bleeding greatly.\r\n\r\nBut I had no mind for badinage, and I turned my face from him sullenly.\r\nSilence fell till we jolted into the courtyard of "The Jolly Soldier,"\r\nwhere Creagh, Macdonald, and Hamish Gorm, having dismounted from their\r\nhorses, waited to carry us into the house. We were got to bed at once, and\r\nour wounds looked to more carefully. By an odd chance Volney and I were\r\nput in the same room, the inn being full, and the Macdonald nursed us\r\nboth, Creagh being for the most part absent in London on business\r\nconnected with the rising.\r\n\r\nLying there day after day, the baronet and I came in time to an odd liking\r\nfor each other, discussing our affairs frankly with certain reservations.\r\nOnce he commented on the strangeness of it.\r\n\r\n"A singular creature is man, Montagu! Here are we two as friendly as--as\r\nbrothers I had almost said, but most brothers hate each other with good\r\ncause. At all events here we lie with nothing but good-will; we are too\r\nweak to get at each other\'s throats and so perforce must endure each the\r\nother\'s presence, and from mere sufferance come to a mutual--shall I say\r\nesteem? A while since we were for slaying; naught but cold steel would let\r\nout our heat; and now--I swear I have for you a vast liking. Will it last,\r\nthink you?"\r\n\r\n"Till we are on our feet again. No longer," I answered.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are right," he replied, with the first touch of despondency\r\nI had ever heard in his voice. "The devil of it is that when I want a\r\nthing I never rest till I get it, and after I have won it I don\'t care any\r\nmore for it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m an obstinate man myself," I said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. And when I say I\'ll do a thing and you say I sha\'n\'t nothing\r\non earth can keep us from the small sword."\r\n\r\n"Did you never spare a victim--never draw back before the evil was done?"\r\nI asked curiously.\r\n\r\n"Many a time, but never when the incentive to the chase was so great as\r\nnow. \'Tis the overcoming of obstacles I cannot resist. In this case--to\r\npass by the acknowledged charms of the lady--I find two powerful reasons\r\nfor continuing: her proud coyness and your defense of her. Be sure I shall\r\nnot fail."\r\n\r\n"I think you will," I answered quietly.\r\n\r\nOut of doubt the man had a subtle fascination for me, even though I hated\r\nhis principles in the same breath. When he turned the batteries of his\r\nfine winning eyes and sparkling smile on me I was under impulse to\r\ncapitulate unconditionally; \'twas at remembrance of Aileen that my jaws\r\nset like a vice again.\r\n\r\nBut as the days passed I observed a gradual change in Volney\'s attitude\r\ntoward the Highland lass. Macdonald had found a temporary home for her at\r\nthe house of a kind-hearted widow woman who lived in the neighbourhood,\r\nand so long as we were in danger the girl and her grey-haired friend came\r\noften to offer their services in nursing. Aileen treated the baronet with\r\nsuch shy gentle womanliness, her girlish pity struggling through the\r\nHighland pride, forgetting in the suffering man the dastard who had\r\nwronged her, that he was moved not a little from his cynical ironic\r\ngayety. She was in a peculiar relation toward us, one lacking the sanction\r\nof society and yet quite natural. I had fought for her, and her warm heart\r\nforbade her to go her way and leave me to live or die as chance might\r\nwill. As she would move about the room ministering to our wants, wrapped\r\nin her sweet purity and grace, more than once I caught on his face a pain\r\nof wistfulness that told me of another man beneath the polished heartless\r\nMacaroni. For the moment I knew he repented him of his attempted wrong,\r\nthough I could not know that a day of manly reparation would come to blot\r\nout his sin against her.\r\n\r\nAs we grew better Aileen\'s visits became shorter and less frequent, so\r\nthat our only temptation to linger over our illness was removed. One day\r\nSir Robert limped slowly across the floor on the arm of Creagh while I\r\nwatched him enviously. From that time his improvement was rapid and within\r\na week he came to make his adieux to me. Dressed point-devise, he was once\r\nmore every inch a fop.\r\n\r\n"I sha\'n\'t say good-bye, Montagu, to either you or the lady, because I\r\nexpect to see you both again soon. I have a shot in my locker that will\r\nbring you to mighty short one of these days. Tony Creagh is going to\r\nLondon with me in my coach. Sorry you and the lady won\'t take the other\r\ntwo seats. Well, au revoir. Hope you\'ll be quite fit when you come up for\r\nthe next round." And waving a hand airily at me he went limping down the\r\nstairs, devoid of grace yet every motion eloquent of it, to me a living\r\nparadox.\r\n\r\nNor was it long before I too was able to crawl out into the sunshine with\r\nAileen Macleod and Captain Macdonald as my crutches. Not far from the inn\r\nwas a grove of trees, and in it a rustic seat or two. Hither we three\r\nrepaired for many a quiet hour of talk. Long ago Donald had established\r\nhis relationship with Aileen. It appeared that he was a cousin about eight\r\ndegrees removed. None but a Highlander would have counted it at all, but\r\nfor them it sufficed. Donald Roy had an extraordinary taking way with\r\nwomen, and he got on with the girl much more easily than I did. Indeed, to\r\nhear them daffing with each other one would have said they had been\r\nbrought up together instead of being acquaintances of less than three\r\nweeks standing.\r\n\r\nYet Donald was so clever with it all that I was never the least jealous of\r\nhim. He was forever taking pains to show me off well before her, making as\r\nmuch of my small attainments as a hen with one chick. Like many of the\r\nWest country Highlanders he was something of a scholar. French he could\r\nspeak like a native, and he had dabbled in the humanities; but he would\r\ndrag forth my smattering of learning with so much glee that one might have\r\nthought him ignorant of the plainest A B C of the matter. More than once I\r\nhave known him blunder in a Latin quotation that I might correct him.\r\nAileen and he had a hundred topics in common from which I was excluded by\r\nreason of my ignorance of the Highlands, but the Macdonald was as sly as a\r\nfox on my behalf. He would draw out the girl about the dear Northland they\r\nboth loved and then would suddenly remember that his pistols needed\r\ncleaning or that, he had promised to "crack" with some chance gentleman\r\nstopping at the inn, and away he would go, leaving us two alone. While I\r\nlay on the grass and looked at her Aileen would tell me in her eager,\r\nimpulsive way about her own kindly country, of tinkling, murmuring burns,\r\nof hills burnt red with the heather, of a hundred wild flowers that\r\nblossomed on the braes of Raasay, and as she talked of them her blue eyes\r\nsparkled like the sun-kissed lochs themselves.\r\n\r\nAh! Those were the good days, when the wine of life was creeping back into\r\nmy blood and I was falling forty fathoms deep in love. Despite myself she\r\nwas for making a hero of me, and my leal-hearted friend, Macdonald, was\r\nnot a whit behind, though the droll look in his eyes suggested sometimes\r\nan ulterior motive. We talked of many things, but in the end we always got\r\nback to the one subject that burned like a flame in their hearts--the\r\nrising of the clans that was to bring back the Stuarts to their own. Their\r\npure zeal shamed my cold English caution. I found myself growing keen for\r\nthe arbitrament of battle.\r\n\r\nNo earthly Paradise endures forever. Into those days of peace the serpent\r\nof my Eden projected his sting. We were all sitting in the grove one\r\nmorning when a rider dashed up to the inn and flung himself from his\r\nhorse. \'Twas Tony Creagh, and he carried with him a placard which offered\r\na reward of a hundred guineas for the arrest of one Kenneth Montagu,\r\nEsquire, who had, with other parties unknown, on the night of July first,\r\nrobbed Sir Robert Volney of certain jewelry therein described.\r\n\r\n"Highwayman it says," quoth I in frowning perplexity. "But Volney knows I\r\nhad no mind to rob him. Zounds! What does he mean?"\r\n\r\n"Mean? Why, to get rid of you! I tore this down from a tavern wall in\r\nLondon just after \'twas pasted. It seems you forgot to return the\r\ngentleman his jewelry."\r\n\r\nI turned mighty red and pleaded guilty.\r\n\r\n"I thought so. Gad! You\'re like to keep sheep by moonlight," chuckled\r\nCreagh.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! They would never hang me," I cried.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t, eh! Deed, and I\'m not so sure. The hue and cry is out for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Havers, man!" interrupted Macdonald sharply. "You\'re frightening the lady\r\nwith your fairy tales, Creagh. Don\'t you be believing him, my dear. The\r\nhemp is not grown that will hang Kenneth."\r\n\r\nBut for all his cheery manner we were mightily taken aback, especially\r\nwhen another rider came in a few minutes later with a letter to me from\r\ntown. It ran:--\r\n\r\n  Dear Montagu,\r\n\r\n  "Once more unto the breach, dear friends." Our pleasant little game is\r\n  renewed. The first trick was, I believe, mine; the second yours. The\r\n  third I trump by lodging an information against you for highway robbery.\r\n  Tony I shall not implicate, of course, nor Mac-What\'s-His-Name. Take\r\n  wings, my Fly-by-night, for the runners are on your heels, and if you\r\n  don\'t, as I live, you\'ll wear hemp. Give my devoted love to the lady. I\r\n  am,\r\n\r\n                            Your most obed^t serv^t to command,\r\n                                                        Rob^t Volney.\r\n\r\nIn imagination I could see him seated at his table, pushing aside a score\r\nof dainty notes from Phyllis indiscreet or passionate Diana, that he might\r\ndash off his warning to me, a whimsical smile half-blown on his face, a\r\ngleam of sardonic humour in his eyes. Remorseless he was by choice, but he\r\nwould play the game with an English sportsman\'s love of fair play.\r\nEliminating his unscrupulous morals and his acquired insolence of manner,\r\nSir Robert Volney would have been one to esteem; by impulse he was one of\r\nthe finest gentlemen I have known.\r\n\r\nThough Creagh had come to warn me of Volney\'s latest move, he was also the\r\nbearer of a budget of news which gravely affected the State at large and\r\nthe cause on which we were embarked. The French fleet of transports,\r\ndelayed again and again by trivial causes, had at length received orders\r\nto postpone indefinitely the invasion of England. Yet in spite of this\r\nfatal blow to the cause it was almost certain that Prince Charles Edward\r\nStuart with only seven companions, of whom one was the ubiquitous\r\nO\'Sullivan, had slipped from Belleisle on the Doutelle and escaping the\r\nBritish fleet had landed on the coast of Scotland. The emotions which\r\nanimated us on hearing of the gallant young Prince\'s daring and romantic\r\nattempt to win a Kingdom with seven swords, trusting sublimely in the\r\nloyalty of his devoted Highlanders, may better be imagined than described.\r\nDonald Roy flung up his bonnet in a wild hurrah, Aileen beamed pride and\r\nhappiness, and Creagh\'s volatile Irish heart was in the hilltops. If I had\r\nany doubts of the issue I knew better than to express them.\r\n\r\nBut we were shortly recalled to our more immediate affairs. Before we got\r\nback to the inn one of those cursed placards offering a reward for my\r\narrest adorned the wall, and in front of it a dozen open-mouthed yokels\r\nwere spelling out its purport. Clearly there was no time to be lost in\r\ntaking Volney\'s advice. We hired a chaise and set out for London within\r\nthe hour. \'Twas arranged that Captain Macdonald and Hamish Gorm should\r\npush on at once to Montagu Grange with Aileen, while I should lie in\r\nhiding at the lodgings of Creagh until my wounds permitted of my\r\ntravelling without danger. That Volney would not rest without attempting\r\nto discover the whereabouts of Miss Macleod I was well assured, and no\r\nplace of greater safety for the present occurred to me than the seclusion\r\nof the Grange with my brother Charles and the family servants to watch\r\nover her. As for myself, I was not afraid of their hanging me, but I was\r\nnot minded to play into the hands of Volney by letting myself get cooped\r\nup in prison for many weeks pending a trial while he renewed his cavalier\r\nwooing of the maid.\r\n\r\nNever have I spent a more doleful time than that which followed. For one\r\nthing my wounds healed badly, causing me a good deal of trouble. Then too\r\nI was a prisoner no less than if I had been in The Tower itself. If\r\noccasionally at night I ventured forth the fear of discovery was always\r\nwith me. Tony Creagh was the best companion in the world, at once tender\r\nas a mother and gay as a schoolboy, but he could not be at home all day\r\nand night, and as he was agog to be joining the Prince in the North he\r\nmight leave any day. Meanwhile he brought me the news of the town from the\r\ncoffee-houses: how Sir Robert Walpole was dead; how the Camerons under\r\nLochiel, the Macdonalds under Young Clanranald, and the Macphersons under\r\nCluny had rallied to the side of the Prince and were expected soon to be\r\ndefeated by Sir John Cope, the Commander-in-Chief of the Government army\r\nin Scotland; how Balmerino and Leath had already shipped for Edinburgh to\r\njoin the insurgent army; how Beauclerc had bet Lord March a hundred\r\nguineas that the stockings worn by Lady Di Faulkner at the last Assembly\r\nball were not mates, and had won. It appeared that unconsciously I had\r\nbeen a source of entertainment to the club loungers.\r\n\r\n"Sure \'tis pity you\'re mewed up here, Kenn, for you\'re the lion of the\r\nhour. None can roar like you. The betting books at White\'s are filled with\r\nwagers about you," Creagh told me.\r\n\r\n"About me?" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Faith, who else? \'Lord Pam bets Mr. Conway three ponies against a hundred\r\npounds that Mr. Kenneth Montagu of Montagu Grange falls by the hand of\r\njustice before three months from date,\'" he quoted with a great deal of\r\ngusto. "Does your neck ache, Kenn?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the odds are in my favour yet. What else?" I asked calmly.\r\n\r\n"\'Mr. James Haddon gives ten pounds each to his Royal Highness the Prince\r\nof Wales and to Sir Robert Volney and is to receive from each twenty\r\nguineas if Mr. K. Montagu is alive twelve months from date.\' Egad, you\'re\r\na topic of interest in high quarters!"\r\n\r\n"Honoured, I\'m sure! I\'ll make it a point to see that his Royal Highness\r\nand my dear friend Volney lose. Anything else?"\r\n\r\n"At the coffee-house they were talking about raising a subscription to you\r\nbecause they hear you\'re devilish hard up and because you made such a\r\nplucky fight against Volney. Some one mentioned that you had a temper and\r\nwere proud as Lucifer. \'He\'s such a hothead. How\'ll he take it?\' asks\r\nBeauclerc. \'Why, quarterly, to be sure!\' cries Selwyn. And that reminds\r\nme: George has written an epigram that is going the rounds. Out of some\r\nqueer whim--to keep them warm I suppose--Madame Bellevue took her slippers\r\nto bed with her. Some one told it at the club, so Selwyn sat down and\r\nwrote these verses:\r\n\r\n              "\'Well may Suspicion shake its head--\r\n                Well may Clorinda\'s spouse be jealous,\r\n              When the dear wanton takes to bed\r\n                Her very shoes--because they\'re fellows.\'"\r\n\r\nCreagh\'s merry laugh was a source of healing in itself, and his departure\r\nto join the Prince put an edge to the zest of my desire to get back into\r\nthe world. Just before leaving he fished a letter from his pocket and\r\ntossed it across the room to me.\r\n\r\n"Egad, and you are the lucky man, Kenn," he said. "The ladies pester us\r\nwith praises of your valour. This morning one of the fair creatures gave\r\nme this to deliver, swearing I knew your whereabouts."\r\n\r\n\'Twas a gay little note from my former playmate Antoinette Westerleigh,\r\nand inclosed was a letter to her from my sister. How eagerly I devoured\r\nCloe\'s letter for news of Aileen may be guessed.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAREST \'TOINETTE:--\r\n\r\n  Since last I saw you (so the letter ran) seems a century, and of\r\n  course I am dying to come to town. No doubt the country is very\r\n  healthy, but Lud! \'tis monstrous dull after a London season. I vow I\r\n  am already a lifetime behind the fashions. Is\'t true that prodigious\r\n  bustles are the rage? And while I think of it I wish you would call at\r\n  Madame Ronald\'s and get the lylack lute-string scirt she is making for\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n  Also at Duprez\'s for the butifull little hat I ordered. Please have\r\n  them sent by carrier. I know I am a vast nuisance; \'tis the penalty,\r\n  my dear, for having a country mawkin as your best friend.\r\n\r\n  Of course you know what that grate brother of mine has been at. Gaming\r\n  I hear, playing ducks and drakes with his money, and fighting duels\r\n  with your lover. For a time we were dreadfully anxious about him. What\r\n  do you think he has sent me down to take care of for him? But you\r\n  would never guess. My love, a Scotch girl, shy as one of her own\r\n  mountain deer. I suppose when he is recovert of his wounds he will be\r\n  down here to philander with her. Aileen Macleod is her name, and\r\n  really I do not blame him. I like her purely myself. In a way quite\r\n  new she is very taking; speaks the prettiest broken English, is very\r\n  simple, sweet, and grateful. At a word the pink and white comes and\r\n  goes in her cheeks as it never does in ours. I wish I could acquire\r\n  her manner, but Alack! \'tis not to be learnt though I took lessons\r\n  forever. The gracefull creature dances the Scottish flings divinely.\r\n  She is not exactly butifull, but--well, I can see why the men think so\r\n  and fall down in worship! By the way, she is very nearly in love--tho\r\n  she does not know it--with that blundering brother of mine; says that\r\n  "her heart iss always thanking him at all events." If he knew how to\r\n  play his cards--but there, the oaf will put his grate foot in it.\r\n\r\n  She came here with a shag-headed gillie of a servant, under the\r\n  protection of a Captain Macdonald who is a very fine figure of a man.\r\n  He was going to stay only an hour or two, but _Charles_ persuaded him\r\n  to stop three days. Charles teases me about him, swears the Captain is\r\n  already my slave, but you may depend on\'t there is nothing in it. Last\r\n  night we diverted ourselves with playing Hide the Thimble, and the\r\n  others lost the Scotch Captain and me in the\r\n\r\n  armory. He is a peck of fun. This morning he left for the North, and\r\n  do you think the grate Mr. Impudence did not buss us both; Aileen\r\n  because she is his cousin a hundred times removed and me because (what\r\n  a reason!) "my eyes dared him." Of course I was in a vast rage, which\r\n  seemed to hily delight Captain Impudence. I don\'t see how he dared\r\n  take so grate a preaviledge. Do you?\r\n\r\n  Aileen is almost drest, and I must go smart myself. My dear, an you\r\n  love me, write to\r\n\r\n                                                       Your own CLOE.\r\n\r\n  P. S.--Lard, I clear forgot! \'Tis a secret that the Scotch enchantress\r\n  is here. You must be sure not to mention it, my dear, to your Sir\r\n  Robert, But la! I have the utmost confidence in your discretion.\r\n\r\nConceive my dismay! Discretion and Antoinette Westerleigh were as far\r\napart as the poles. What more likely than that the dashing little minx\r\nwould undertake to rally her lover about Aileen, and that the adroit\r\nbaronet would worm out of her the information he desired? The letter\r\ncrystallized my desire to set out at once for Montagu Grange, and from\r\nthere to take the road with Miss Macleod hotspur for Scotland. It appeared\r\nto me that the sooner we were out of England the better it would be for\r\nboth of us.\r\n\r\nI made the journey to the Grange by easy stages, following so far as I\r\ncould little used roads and lanes on account of a modest desire to avoid\r\npublicity. \'Twas early morning when I reached the Grange. I remember the\r\nbirds were twittering a chorus as I rode under the great oaks to the\r\nhouse. Early as it was, Cloe and Aileen were already walking in the garden\r\nwith their arms entwined about each other\'s waists in girl fashion. They\r\nmade a picture taking enough to have satisfied a jaded connoisseur of\r\nbeauty: the fair tall Highland lass, jimp as a willow wand, with the\r\nlong-lashed blue eyes that looked out so shyly and yet so frankly on those\r\nshe liked, and the merry brown-eyed English girl so ready of saucy tongue,\r\nso worldly wise and yet so innocent of heart.\r\n\r\nCloe came running to meet me in a flutter of excitement and Mistress\r\nAileen followed more demurely down the path, though there was a Highland\r\nwelcome in her frank face not to be denied. I slid from the horse and\r\nkissed Cloe. Miss Macleod gave me her hand.\r\n\r\n"We are hoping you are quite well from your wounds," she said.\r\n\r\n"Quite," I answered. "Better much for hearing your kind voices and seeing\r\nyour bright faces."\r\n\r\nI dare say I looked over-long into one of the bright faces, and for a\r\npunishment was snatched into confusion by my malapert sister.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you had heard my kind voice yet," mimicked Miss Madcap.\r\n"And are you thinking of holding Aileen\'s hand all day?"\r\n\r\nMy hand plumped to my side like a shot. Both of us flamed, I stammering\r\napologies the while Cloe no doubt enjoyed hugely my embarrassment. \'Tis a\r\nsister\'s prerogative to teach her older brothers humility, and Cloe for\r\none did not let it fall into neglect.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I do not know the Highland custom in the matter," she was\r\ncontinuing complacently when Aileen hoist her with her own petard.\r\n\r\n"I wass thinking that perhaps Captain Macdonald had taught you in the\r\narmory," she said quietly; and Cloe, to be in the fashion, ran up the red\r\nflag too.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that my plan for an immediate departure from England jumped\r\nwith the inclination of Miss Macleod. She had received a letter from her\r\nbrother, now in Scotland, whose plans in regard to her had been upset by\r\nthe unexpected arrival of the Prince. He was extremely solicitous on her\r\nbehalf, but could only suggest for her an acceptance of a long-standing\r\ninvitation to visit Lady Strathmuir, a distant relative living in Surrey,\r\nuntil times grew more settled. To Aileen the thought of throwing herself\r\nupon the hospitality of one she had never met was extremely distasteful,\r\nand she hailed my proposal as an alternative much to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe disagreeable duty of laying before my lawyer the involved condition of\r\nmy affairs had to be endured, and I sent for him at once to get it over\r\nwith the sooner. He pulled a prodigious long face at my statement of the\r\ngaming debts I had managed to contract during my three months\' experiment\r\nas the prodigal son in London, but though he was extraordinarily severe\r\nwith me I made out in the end that affairs were not so bad as I had\r\nthought. The estate would have to be plastered with a mortgage, but some\r\nyears of stiff economy and retrenchment, together with a ruthless pruning\r\nof the fine timber, would suffice to put me on my feet again. The\r\nexpenditures of the household would have to be cut down, but Mr. Brief\r\nthought that a modest establishment befitting my rank might still be\r\nmaintained. If I thought of marrying----\r\n\r\nA ripple of laughter from the lawn, where Aileen and Charles were\r\narranging fishing tackle, was wafted through the open window and cut\r\nathwart the dry speech of the lawyer. My eyes found her and lingered on\r\nthe soft curves, the rose-leaf colouring, the eager face framed in a\r\nsunlit aureola of radiant hair. Already my mind had a trick of imagining\r\nher the mistress of the Grange. Did she sit for a moment in the seat that\r\nhad been my mother\'s my heart sang; did she pluck a posy or pour a cup of\r\ntea \'twas the same. "If I thought of marrying----" Well, \'twas a thing to\r\nbe considered one day--when I came back from the wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nIN THE MATTER OF A KISS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed that the music of the gray morn when we started found a\r\nready echo in my heart. The whistle of a plover cut the breaking day, the\r\nmeadow larks piped clear above us in chorus with the trilling of the\r\nthrush, the wimpling burn tinkled its song, and the joy that took me\r\nfairly by the throat was in tune with all of them. For what does a lover\r\nask but to be one and twenty, to be astride a willing horse, and to be\r\nbeside the one woman in the world for him? Sure \'tis heaven enough to\r\nwatch the colour come and go in her face, to hear the lilt of her voice,\r\nand to see the changing light in her eye. What though at times we were shy\r\nas the wild rabbit, we were none the less happy for that. In our hearts\r\nthere bubbled a childlike gaiety; we skipped upon the sunlit hilltops of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the one drop of poison in the honey of my cup: that I was\r\nwearing an abominable misfit of a drab-coloured suit of homespun more\r\nadapted to some village tradesman than to a young cavalier of fashion, for\r\non account of the hue and cry against me I had pocketed my pride and was\r\ntravelling under an incognito. Nor did it comfort me one whit that Aileen\r\nalso was furbished up in sombre gray to represent my sister, for she\r\nlooked so taking in it that I vow \'twas more becoming than her finery. Yet\r\nI made the best of it, and many a good laugh we got from rehearsing our\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nI can make no hand at remembering what we had to say to each other, nor\r\ndoes it matter; in cold type \'twould lose much of its charm. The merry\r\nprattle of her pretty broken English was set to music for me, and the very\r\nsilences were eloquent of thrill. Early I discovered that I had not\r\nappreciated fully her mental powers, on account of a habit she had of\r\nfalling into a shy silence when several were present. She had a nimble\r\nwit, an alert fancy, and a zest for life as earnest as it was refreshing.\r\nA score of times that day she was out of the shabby chaise to pick the\r\nwild flowers or to chat with the children by the wayside. The memory of\r\nher warm friendliness to me stands out the more clear contrasted with the\r\nfrigid days that followed.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought by some that our course in travelling together bordered\r\non the edge of the proprieties, but it must be remembered that the\r\nsituation was a difficult one for us both. Besides which my sister Cloe\r\nwas always inclined to be independent, of a romantical disposition, and\r\nherself young; as for Aileen, I doubt whether any thought of the\r\nconventions crossed her mind. Her people would be wearying to see her; her\r\nfriend Kenneth Montagu had offered his services to conduct her home;\r\nHamish Gorm was a jealous enough chaperone for any girl, and the maid that\r\nCloe had supplied would serve to keep the tongues of the gossips from\r\nclacking.\r\n\r\nWe put up that first evening at The King\'s Arms, a great rambling inn of\r\ntwo stories which caught the trade of many of the fashionable world on\r\ntheir way to and from London. Aileen and I dined together at a table in\r\nthe far end of the large dining-room. As I remember we were still uncommon\r\nmerry, she showing herself very clever at odd quips and turns of\r\nexpression. We found matter for jest in a large placard on the wall, with\r\nwhat purported to be a picture of me, the printed matter containing the\r\nusual description and offer of reward. Watching her, I was thinking that I\r\nhad never known a girl more in love with life or with so mobile a face\r\nwhen a large company of arrivals from London poured gaily into the room.\r\n\r\nThey were patched and powdered as if prepared for a ball rather than for\r\nthe dust of the road. Dowagers, frigid and stately as marble, murmured\r\nracy gossip to each other behind their fans. Famous beauties flitted\r\nhither and thither, beckoning languid fops with their alluring eyes. Wits\r\nand beaux sauntered about elegantly even as at White\'s. \'Twas plain that\r\nthis was a party _en route_ for one of the great county houses near.\r\n\r\nAileen stared with wide-open eyes and parted lips at these great dames\r\nfrom the fashionable world about which she knew nothing. They were\r\nprominent members of the leading school for backbiting in England, and in\r\nten minutes they had talked more scandal than the Highland lass had heard\r\nbefore in a lifetime. But the worst of the situation was that there was\r\nnot one of them but would cry "Montagu!" when they clapped eyes on me.\r\nHere were Lord March, George Selwyn, Sir James Craven, Topham Beauclerc,\r\nand young Winton Westerleigh; Lady Di Davenport and the Countess Dowager\r\nof Rocksboro; the Hon. Isabel Stanford, Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh,\r\nand others as well known to me. They had taken us at unawares, and as\r\nCreagh would have put it in an Irish bull the only retreat possible for us\r\nwas an advance through the enemy. At present they paid no more attention\r\nto us than they would to the wooden negro in front of a tobacco shop, but\r\nat any moment detection might confront me. Faith, here was a predicament!\r\nConceive me, with a hundred guineas set upon my head, thrust into the very\r\ncompany in all England I would most have avoided.\r\n\r\nAnd of all the people in the world they chanced on me as a topic of\r\nconversation. George Selwyn, strolling up and down the room, for want of\r\nsomething better to do, stopped in front of that confounded placard and\r\nbegan reading it aloud. Now I don\'t mind being described as "Tall, strong,\r\nwell-built, and extremely good-looking; brown eyes and waving hair like\r\nilk; carries himself with distinction;" but I grue at being set down as a\r\ncommon cutpurse, especially when I had taken the trouble to send back Sir\r\nRobert\'s jewelry at some risk to myself.\r\n\r\n"Wonder what Montagu has done with himself," queried Beauclerc after\r\nSelwyn had finished.\r\n\r\n"Or what Volney has done with him," muttered March behind his hand. "I\'ll\r\nlay two to one in ponies he never lives to cross another man."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong, March, if you think Volney finished him. He\'s alive all\r\nright. I heard it from Denman that he got safe across to France. Pity\r\nVolney didn\'t pink the fellow through the heart for his d----d impudence\r\nin interfering; not that I can stand Volney either, curse the popinjay!"\r\nsnarled Craven sourly.\r\n\r\n"If Montagu reaches the continent, \'twill be a passover the Jews who hold\r\nhis notes will not relish," suggested Selwyn in his sleepy way.\r\n\r\nA pink-and-white-faced youth shimmering in cream satin was the animated\r\nheart of another group. His love for scandal and his facility for\r\nacquiring the latest tidbit made him the delight of many an old tabby cat.\r\nNow his eyes shone with the joy of imparting a delicious morsel.\r\n\r\n"Egad, then, you\'re all wrong," he was saying in a shrill falsetto. "Stap\r\nme, the way of it was this! I have it on the best of authority and it\r\ncomes direct, rot me if it doesn\'t! Sir Robert\'s man, Watkins, told Madame\r\nBellevue\'s maid, from whom it came straight to Lord Pam\'s fellow and\r\nthrough him to old Methuselah, who mentioned it to----"\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t finish tracing the lineage of the misinformation. We\'ll\r\nassume it began with Adam and ended with a dam--with a descendant of his,"\r\ninterrupted Craven with his usual insolence. "Now out with the lie!"\r\n\r\n"\'Pon honour, Craven, \'tis gospel truth," gasped Pink-and-White.\r\n\r\n"Better send for a doctor then. If he tries to tell the truth for once\r\nhe\'ll strangle," suggested Selwyn whimsically to March.\r\n\r\n"Spit it out then!" bullied Craven coarsely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lard! Your roughness gives me the flutters, Sir James. I\'m all of a\r\ntremble. Split me, I can\'t abide to be scolded! Er-- Well, then, \'twas a\r\nWelsh widow they fought about--name of Gwynne and rich as Croesus--old\r\nenough to be a grandmother of either of \'em, begad! Volney had first claim\r\nand Montagu cut in; swore he\'d marry her if she went off the hooks next\r\nminute. They fought and Montagu fell at the first shot. Next day the old\r\nBegum ran off with her footman. That\'s the story, you may depend on\'t.\r\nLud, yes!"\r\n\r\n"You may depend on its being wrong in every particular," agreed Lady Di\r\ncoolly. "You\'d better tell the story, \'Toinette. They\'ll have it a hundred\r\ntimes worse."\r\n\r\n"Oh Lard! Gossip about my future husband. Not I!" giggled that lively\r\nyoung woman.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a prude, miss!" commanded the Dowager Countess sharply. "\'Tis to\r\nstifle false reports you tell it."\r\n\r\n"Slidikins! An you put it as a duty," simpered the young beauty. "\'Twould\r\nseem that--it would appear--the story goes that-- Do I blush?--that Sir\r\nRobert-- Oh, let Lady Di tell it!"\r\n\r\nLady Di came to scratch with the best will in the world.\r\n\r\n"To correct a false impression then; for no other reason I tell it save to\r\nkill worse rumours. Everybody knows I hate scandal."\r\n\r\n"\'Slife, yes! Everybody knows that," agreed Craven, leering over at\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert Volney then was much taken with a Scotch girl who was visiting\r\nin London, and of course she dreamed air castles and fell in love with\r\nhim. \'Twas Joan and Darby all the livelong day, but alack! the maid\r\ndiscovered, as maids will, that Sir Robert\'s intentions were--not of the\r\nbest, and straightway the blushing rose becomes a frigid icicle. Well,\r\nthis Northern icicle was not to be melted, and Sir Robert was for trying\r\nthe effect of a Surrey hothouse. In her brother\'s absence he had the maid\r\nabducted and carried to a house of his in town."\r\n\r\n"\'Slife! A story for a play. And what then?" cried Pink-and-White.\r\n\r\n"Why then--enter Mr. Montagu with a \'Stay, villain!\' It chanced that young\r\nDon Quixote was walking through the streets for the cooling of his blood\r\nmayhap, much overheated by reason of deep play. He saw, he followed, at a\r\nfitting time he broke into the apartment of the lady. Here Sir Robert\r\ndiscovered them----"\r\n\r\n"The lady all unready, alackaday!" put in the Honourable Isabel, from\r\nbehind a fan to hide imaginary blushes.\r\n\r\n"Well, something easy of attire to say the least," admitted Lady Di\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\n"I\' faith then, Montagu must make a better lover than Sir Robert," cried\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n"Every lady to her taste. And later they fought on the way to Surrey. Both\r\nwounded, no graves needed. The girl nursed Montagu back to health, and\r\nthey fled to France together," concluded the narrator.\r\n\r\n"And the lady--is she such a beauty?" queried Beauclerc.\r\n\r\n"Slidikins! I don\'t know. She must have points. No Scotch mawkin would\r\ndraw Sir Robert\'s eye."\r\n\r\nYou are to imagine with what a burning face I sat listening to this\r\ndevil\'s brew of small talk. What their eyes said to each other of\r\ninnuendo, what their lifted brows implied, and what they whispered behind\r\nwhite elegant hands, was more maddening than the open speech. For myself,\r\nI did not value the talk of the cats at one jack straw, but for this young\r\ngirl sitting so still beside me-- By Heaven, I dared not look at her. Nor\r\ndid I know what to do, how to stop them without making the matter worse\r\nfor her, and I continued to sit in an agony grizzling on the gridiron of\r\ntheir calumnies. Had they been talking lies outright it might have been\r\neasily borne, but there was enough of truth mixed in the gossip to burn\r\nthe girl with the fires of shame.\r\n\r\nAt the touch of a hand I turned to look into a face grown white and chill,\r\nall the joy of life struck out of it. The girl\'s timorous eyes implored me\r\nto spare her more of this scene.\r\n\r\n"Oh Kenneth, get me away from here. I will be dying of shame. Let us be\r\ngoing at once," she asked in a low cry.\r\n\r\n"There is no way out except through the crowd of them. Will you dare make\r\nthe attempt? Should I be recognized it may be worse for you."\r\n\r\n"I am not fearing if you go with me. And at all events anything iss better\r\nthan this."\r\n\r\nThere was a chance that we might pass through unobserved, and I took it;\r\nbut I was white-hot with rage and I dare say my aggressive bearing\r\nbewrayed me. In threading our way to the door I brushed accidentally\r\nagainst Mistress Westerleigh. She drew aside haughtily, then gave a little\r\nscream of recognition.\r\n\r\n"Kenn Montagu, of all men in the world--and turned Quaker, too. Gog\'s\r\nlife, \'tis mine, \'tis mine! The hundred guineas are mine. I call you all\r\nto witness I have taken the desperate highwayman. \'Tall, strong, and\r\nextremely well-looking; carries himself like a gentleman.\' This way, sir,"\r\nshe cried merrily, and laying hold of my coat-tails began to drag me\r\ntoward the men.\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of laughter at this, and the pink-white youth lounged\r\nforward to offer me a hand of welcome I took pains not to see.\r\n\r\n"Faith, the lady has the right of it, Montagu. That big body of yours is\r\nworth a hundred guineas now if it never was before," laughed Selwyn.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to disappoint the lady, but unfortunately my business carries me in\r\nanother direction," I said stiffly.\r\n\r\n"But Lud! \'Tis not fair. You\'re mine. I took you, and I want the reward,"\r\ncries the little lady with the sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\nAileen stood by my side like a queen cut out of marble, turning neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left, her head poised regally on her fine shoulders\r\nas if she saw none in the room worthy a look.\r\n\r\n"This must be the baggage about which they fought. Faith, as fine a piece\r\nas I have seen," said Craven to March in an audible aside, his bold eyes\r\nfixed insolently on the Highland girl.\r\n\r\nAileen heard him, and her face flamed. I set my teeth and swore to pay him\r\nfor that some day, but I knew this to be no fitting time for a brawl.\r\nDespite me the fellow forced my hand. He planted himself squarely in our\r\nway and ogled my charge with impudent effrontery. Me he quite ignored,\r\nwhile his insulting eyes raked her fore and aft. My anger seethed, boiled\r\nover. Forward slid my foot behind his heel, my forearm under his chin. I\r\nthrew my weight forward in a push. His head went back as though shot from\r\na catapult, and next moment Sir James Craven measured his length on the\r\nground. With the girl on my arm I pushed through the company to the door.\r\nThey cackled after me like solan-geese, but I shut and locked the door in\r\ntheir faces and led Aileen to her room. She marched up the stairs like a\r\ngoddess, beautiful in her anger as one could desire. The Gaelic heart is a\r\ngood hater, and \'twas quite plain that Miss Macleod had inherited a\r\ncapacity for anger.\r\n\r\n"How dare they? How dare they? What have I done that they should talk so?\r\nThere are three hundred claymores would be leaping from the scabbard for\r\nthis. My grief! That they would talk so of my father\'s daughter."\r\n\r\nShe was superbly beautiful in her wrath. It was the black fury of the\r\nHighland loch in storm that leaped now from her eyes. Like a caged and\r\nwounded tigress she strode up and down the room, her hands clenched and\r\nher breast heaving, an impetuous flood of Gaelic pouring from her mouth.\r\n\r\nFor most strange logic commend me to a woman\'s reasoning, I had been in no\r\nway responsible for the scene down-stairs, but somehow she lumped me\r\nblindly with the others in her mind, at least so far as to punish me\r\nbecause I had seen and heard. Apparently \'twas enough that I was of their\r\nrace and class, for when during a pause I slipped in my word of soothing\r\nexplanation the uncorked vials of her rage showered down on me. Faith, I\r\nbegan to think that old Jack Falstaff had the right of it in his rating of\r\ndiscretion, and the maid appearing at that moment I showed a clean pair of\r\nheels and left her alone with her mistress.\r\n\r\nAs I was descending the stairs a flunky in the livery of the Westerleighs\r\nhanded me a note. It was from Antoinette, and in a line requested me to\r\nmeet her at once in the summer-house of the garden. In days past I had\r\ncoquetted many an hour away with her. Indeed, years before we had been\r\nlovers in half-earnest boy and girl fashion, and after that the best of\r\nfriends. Grimly I resolved to keep the appointment and to tell this little\r\nworldling some things she needed much to know.\r\n\r\nI found her waiting. Her back was turned, and though she must have heard\r\nme coming she gave no sign. I was still angry at her for her share in what\r\nhad just happened and I waited coldly for her to begin. She joined me in\r\nthe eloquent silence of a Quaker meeting.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am here," I said at last.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s you." She turned on me, mighty cold and haughty. "Sir, I take it\r\nas a great presumption that you dare to stay at the same inn with me after\r\nattempting to murder my husband that is to be."\r\n\r\n"Murder!" I gasped, giving ground in dismay at this unexpected charge.\r\n\r\n"Murder was the word I used, sir. Do you not like it?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twas a fair fight," I muttered.\r\n\r\n"Was it not you that challenged? Did you not force it on him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but----"\r\n\r\n"And then you dare to come philandering here after me. Do you think I can\r\nchange lovers as often as gloves, sir? Or as often as you?"\r\n\r\n"Madam, I protest----"\r\n\r\n"La! You protest! Did you not come here to see me? Answer me that, sir!"\r\nWith an angry stamp of her foot.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mistress Westerleigh, your note----"\r\n\r\n"And to philander? Do you deny it?"\r\n\r\n"Deny it. Odzooks, yes! \'Tis the last thing I have in my mind," I rapped\r\nout mighty short. "I have done with women and their follies. I begin to\r\nsee why men of sense prefer to keep their freedom."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Kenn? And was the other lady so hard on you? Did she make you pay\r\nfor our follies? Poor Kenn!" laughed my mocking tormentor with so sudden a\r\nchange of front that I was quite nonplussed. "And did you think I did not\r\nknow my rakehelly lover Sir Robert better than to blame you for his\r\nquarrels?"\r\n\r\nI breathed freer. She had taken the wind out of my sails, for I had come\r\npurposing to give her a large piece of my mind. Divining my intention,\r\nwomanlike she had created a diversion by carrying the war into the country\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nShe looked winsome in the extreme. Little dimples ran in and out her\r\npeach-bloom cheeks. In her eyes danced a kind of innocent devilry, and the\r\nalluring mouth was the sweetest Cupid\'s bow imaginable. Laughter rippled\r\nover her face like the wind in golden grain. Mayhap my eyes told what I\r\nwas thinking, for she asked in a pretty, audacious imitation of the Scotch\r\ndialect Aileen was supposed to speak,\r\n\r\n"Am I no\' bonny, Kenneth?"\r\n\r\n"You are that, \'Toinette."\r\n\r\n"But you love her better?" she said softly.\r\n\r\nI told her yes.\r\n\r\n"And yet----" She turned and began to pull a honeysuckle to pieces,\r\npouting in the prettiest fashion conceivable.\r\n\r\nThe graceful curves of the lithe figure provoked me. There was a challenge\r\nin her manner, and my blood beat with a surge. I made a step or two toward\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"And yet?" I repeated, over her shoulder.\r\n\r\nOne by one the petals floated away.\r\n\r\n"There was a time----" She spoke so softly I had to bend over to hear.\r\n\r\nI sighed. "A thousand years ago, \'Toinette."\r\n\r\n"But love is eternal, and in eternity a thousand years are but as a day."\r\n\r\nThe long curving lashes were lifted for a moment, and the dancing brown\r\neyes flashed into mine. While mine held them they began to dim. On my soul\r\nthe little witch contrived to let the dew of tears glisten there. Now a\r\nwoman\'s tears are just the one thing Kenneth Montagu cannot resist. After\r\nall I am not the first man that has come to make war and stayed to make\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n"\'Toinette! \'Toinette!" I chided, resolution melting fast.\r\n\r\n"And y\'are commanded to love your neighbours, Kenn."\r\n\r\nI vow she was the takingest madcap in all England, and not the worst heart\r\nneither. I am no Puritan, and youth has its day in which it will be\r\nserved. My scruples took wing.\r\n\r\n"Faith, one might travel far and not do better," I told her. "When the\r\ngods send their best to a man he were a sorry knave to complain."\r\n\r\nYet I stood helpless, in longing desire and yet afraid to dare. No nicety\r\nof conscience held me now, rather apprehension. I had not lived my one and\r\ntwenty years without learning that a young woman may be free of speech and\r\nyet discreet of action, that alluring eyes are oft mismated with prim\r\nmaiden conscience. \'Tis in the blood of some of them to throw down the\r\ngauntlet to a man\'s courage and then to trample on him for daring to\r\naccept the challenge.\r\n\r\nHer eyes derided me. A scoffing smile crept into that mocking face of\r\nhers. No longer I shilly-shallied. She had brought me to dance, and she\r\nmust pay the piper.\r\n\r\n"Modesty is a sweet virtue, but it doesn\'t butter any bread," I cried\r\ngaily. "Egad, I embrace my temptation."\r\n\r\nWhich same I did, and the temptress too.\r\n\r\n"Am I your temptation, Adam?" quoth the lady presently.\r\n\r\n"I vow y\'are the fairest enticement, Eve, that ever trod the earth since\r\nthe days of the first Garden. For this heaven of your lips I\'ll pay any\r\nprice in reason. A year in purgatory were cheap----"\r\n\r\nI stopped, my florid eloquence nipped in bud, for the lady had suddenly\r\nbegun to disengage herself. Her glance shot straight over my shoulder to\r\nthe entrance of the summer-house. Divining the presence of an intruder, I\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nAileen was standing in the doorway looking at us with an acrid, scornful\r\nsmile that went to my heart like a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMY LADY RAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nI was shaken quite out of my exultation. I stood raging at myself in a\r\ndefiant scorn, struck dumb at the folly that will let a man who loves one\r\nwoman go sweethearting with another. Her eyes stabbed me, the while I\r\nstood there dogged yet grovelling, no word coming to my dry lips. What was\r\nthere to be said? The tie that bound me to Aileen was indefinable,\r\ntenuous, not to be phrased; yet none the less it existed. I stood\r\nconvicted, for I had tacitly given her to understand that no woman found\r\nplace in my mind save her, and at the first chance she found another in my\r\narms. Like a detected schoolboy in presence of the rod I awaited my\r\nsentence, my heart a trip-hammer, my face a picture of chagrin and dread.\r\n\r\nFor just a moment she held me in the balance with that dreadful smile on\r\nher face, my day of judgment come to earth, then turned and away without a\r\nword. I flung wildly after her, intent on explaining what could not be\r\nexplained. In the night I lost her and went up and down through the\r\nshrubbery calling her to come forth, beating the currant and gooseberry\r\nbushes in search of her. A shadow flitted past me toward the house, and at\r\nthe gate I intercepted the girl. Better I had let her alone. My heart\r\nmisgave me at sight of her face; indeed the whole sweep of her lithesome\r\nreedy figure was pregnant with Highland scorn and pride.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aileen, in the arbour----" I was beginning, when she cut me short.\r\n\r\n"And I am thinking I owe you an apology for my intrusion. In troth, Mr.\r\nMontagu, my interruption of your love-makings was not intentional."\r\n\r\nHer voice gave me the feel of being drenched with ice-water.\r\n\r\n"If you will let me explain, Aileen----"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, and there iss nothing to explain, sir. It will be none of my\r\nbusiness who you are loving, and-- Will you open the gate, Mr. Montagu?"\r\n\r\n"But I must explain; \'twas a madness of the blood. You do not\r\nunderstand----"\r\n\r\n"And gin I never understand, Mr. Montagu, the lift (sky) will not fall.\r\nHere iss a great to-do about nothing," she flung back with a kind of\r\nbitter jauntiness.\r\n\r\n"Aileen," I cried, a little wildly, "you will not cast me off without a\r\nhearing. Somehow I must make it clear, and you must try----"\r\n\r\n"My name it iss Miss Macleod, and I would think it clear enough already at\r\nall events. I will be thanking you to let me pass, sir."\r\n\r\nHer words bit, not less the scorch of her eyes. My heart was like running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"And is this an end to all-- Will you let so small a thing put a period to\r\nour good comradeship?" I cried.\r\n\r\n"Since you mention it I would never deny that I am under obligations to\r\nyou, sir, which my brother will be blithe to repay----"\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, I never mentioned obligations; I never thought of them. Is\r\nthere no friendship in your heart for me?"\r\n\r\n"Your regard iss a thing I have valued, but"--there was a little break in\r\nthe voice which she rode over roughshod--"I can very well be getting along\r\nwithout the friendships of that girl\'s lover."\r\n\r\nShe snatched open the gate and flung past me to the house, this superb\r\nyoung creature, tall, slim, supple, a very Diana in her rage, a woman too\r\nif one might judge by the breasts billowing with rising sobs. More slow I\r\nfollowed, quite dashed to earth. All that I had gained by months of\r\nservice in one moment had been lost. She would think me another of the\r\nVolney stamp, and her liking for me would turn to hate as with him.\r\n\r\nA low voice from the arbour called "Kenn!" But I had had enough of\r\ngallivanting for one night and I held my way sullenly to the house. Swift\r\nfeet pattered down the path after me, and presently a little hand fell on\r\nmy arm. I turned, sulky as a baited bear.\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry, Kenn," said Mistress Antoinette demurely.\r\n\r\nMy sardonic laughter echoed cheerlessly. "That there is no more mischief\r\nto your hand. Oh never fear! You\'ll find some other poor breeched gull\r\nshortly."\r\n\r\nThe brown dovelike eyes of the little rip reproached me.\r\n\r\n"\'Twill all come right, Kenn. She\'ll never think the worse of you for\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be no more to her than a glove outworn. I have lost the only woman I\r\ncould ever love, and through my own folly, too."\r\n\r\n"Alackaday, Kenn! Y\' \'ave much to learn about women yet. She will think\r\nthe more of you for it when her anger is past."\r\n\r\n"Not she. One of your fashionables might, but not Aileen."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I think better of her than you. She\'s not all milk and water.\r\nThere\'s red blood in her veins, man. Spunk up and brazen it out. Cock your\r\nchin and whistle it off bravely. Faith, I know better men than you who\r\nwould not look so doleful over one of \'Toinette Westerleigh\'s kisses. If I\r\nwere a man I would never kiss and be sorry for all the maids in\r\nChristendom."\r\n\r\nThe saucy piquant tilt to her chin was a sight for the gods to admire.\r\n\r\n"You forget I love her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you play on one string. She\'s not the only maid i\' the world," pouted\r\nthe London beauty.\r\n\r\n"She\'s the only one for me," I said stubbornly, and then added dejectedly,\r\n"and she\'s not for me neither."\r\n\r\nThe little rogue began to laugh. "I give you up, Kenn. Y\'are as moonstruck\r\na lover as ever I saw. Here\'s for a word of comfort, which you don\'t\r\ndeserve at all. For a week she will be a thunder-cloud, then the sun will\r\nbeam more brightly than ever. But don\'t you be too submissive. La! Women\r\ncannot endure a wheedling lover."\r\n\r\nAfter that bit of advice my sage little monitor fell sober and explained\r\nto me her reason for sending me the note. It appeared that Sir Robert\r\nVolney was due to meet the party at the inn that very evening, and Miss\r\nWesterleigh was of opinion that I and my charge would do well to take the\r\nroad at once. I was of that mind myself. I lost no time in reaching the\r\nhouse and ordering a relay of horses for our immediate travel. Then I took\r\nthe stairs three at a time and came knocking at Aileen\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Who iss there?" asked a small voice, full of tears and muffled in a\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nHer distress went to my heart, none the less because I who had been the\r\ncause of it could not heal it.\r\n\r\n"Tis I--Kenneth Montagu. Open the door, please."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence, then--\r\n\r\n"I am not wishing to see Mr. Montagu to-night."\r\n\r\n"Not for the world would I trouble you, Miss Macleod, but there is a\r\nmatter I have to disclose that touches us nearly."\r\n\r\n"I think you will not have heard aright. I am desiring to be alone, sir,"\r\nshe answered, the frost in her voice.\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed that this dismissal chafed me. My eagerness was daunted,\r\nbut yet I would not be fubbed off.\r\n\r\n"Miss Macleod, you may punish me as much as you like some other time," I\r\ncried desperately, "but \'fore God! if you do not open the door you will\r\nregret it till the last day of your life."\r\n\r\n"Are you threatening me, sir?" she asks, mighty haughty.\r\n\r\n"Threatening--no! I do not threaten, but warn. This matter is of life and\r\ndeath, not to be played with;" and to emphasize my words I mentioned the\r\nname of Volney.\r\n\r\nShe came raging to the door and whipped it open very sudden. Her affronted\r\neyes might have belonged to a queen, but the stains on her cheeks betrayed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what iss this important matter that cannot be waiting? Perhaps\r\nMr. Montagu mistakes this for the room of Mistress Westerleigh."\r\n\r\nI told her that Sir Robert was expected shortly to arrive at the inn, and\r\nthat we must be on the road at once. She thanked me very primly for the\r\ninformation, but declared she would not trouble me further, that she meant\r\nto abide at the inn all night no matter who came; moreover, that when she\r\ndid leave Hamish Gorm would be sufficient guard. I argued, cajoled,\r\nwarned, threatened, but she was not to be moved. The girl took a perverse\r\npleasure in thwarting me, and the keener I grew the more dour grew she. We\r\nmight have disputed the point an hour had I not come to my senses and\r\nappeared to give way.\r\n\r\nSuspecting that the girl\'s fears of Sir Robert would reassert themselves\r\nwhen she was left to herself, I sought her maid and easily induced the\r\ngirl to propose to her mistress a departure without my knowledge. The\r\nsuggestion worked like a charm, and fifteen minutes later I had the\r\npleasure of seeing the chaise roll out of the lighted yard into the night.\r\nNeed it be said that Kenneth Montagu was ahorse and after the coach within\r\na few minutes.\r\n\r\nAll night I jogged behind them, and in the morning rode up to the inn\r\nwhere they stopped for breakfast. From Mistress Aileen I got the slightest\r\nbow in the world as I passed to my solitary breakfast at a neighbouring\r\ntable. Within the hour they were away again, and I after to cover the\r\nrear. Late in the day the near wheeler fell very lame. The rest of the\r\nanimals were dead beat, and I rode to the nearest hamlet to get another\r\nhorse. The night was falling foul, very mirk, with a rising wind, and\r\nmethought the lady\'s eyes lightened when she saw me return with help to\r\nget them out of their difficulty. She thanked me stiffly with a very\r\nstraight lip.\r\n\r\n"At all events there will be no end to the obligations I am under, Mr.\r\nMontagu. They will be piling high as Ben Nevis," she said, but \'twould\r\nhave taken a penetrating man to have discovered any friendliness in the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nYet henceforth I made myself one of the party, admitted on sufferance with\r\na very bad grace. More than once I tried to break through the chill\r\nconventionals that made the staple of our conversation, but the girl was\r\nice to me. In the end I grew stiff as she. I would ride beside the coach\r\nall day with scarce a word, wearying for a reconciliation and yet\r\nnourishing angry pride. When speech appeared to be demanded between us\r\n\'twas of the most formal. Faith, I think we were liker a pair of spoilt\r\nchildren than sensible grown folks.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still in the northern counties rumours began to reach us\r\nthat General Cope\'s army had been cut to pieces by the Highlanders. The\r\nstories ran that not a single man had escaped, that the clans, twenty\r\nthousand strong, were headed for England, that they were burning and\r\ndestroying as they advanced. Incredible reports of all kinds sprang out of\r\nthe air, and the utmost alarm prevailed. The report of Cope\'s defeat was\r\nsoon verified. We met more than one redcoat speeding south on a\r\nfoam-flecked weary steed, and it did not need the second sight to divine\r\nthat the dispatches they carried spoke loudly of disaster fallen and of\r\nreinforcements needed.\r\n\r\nAfter we had crossed the border parties of foraging Highlanders began to\r\nappear occasionally, but a word in the Gaelic from Hamish Gorm always\r\nserved as a password for us. To make short, early in October we reached\r\nthe Scottish capital, the formal relations which had been established\r\nbetween Miss Macleod and me continuing to the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nThere lived in Edinburgh an unmarried aunt of Aileen, a Miss Flora MacBean\r\nby name, and at her house I left the girl while I went to notify her\r\nbrother of our arrival. I found him lodged in High Street near the old\r\nFlesh-market Close. Malcolm Macleod was a fine manly fellow of about three\r\nand thirty, lusty and well-proportioned, very tanned and ruddy. He had a\r\nquick lively eye and a firm good-humoured mouth. In brief, he was the very\r\npicture of a frank open-hearted Highland gentleman, and in the gay Macleod\r\ntartan looked as gallant a figure of a soldier as one would wish to see.\r\nHe greeted me with charming friendliness and expressed himself as deeply\r\ngratified for my care of his sister, offering again and again to put\r\nhimself at my service in any way I might desire.\r\n\r\nWe walked down the street together, and more than once a shot plumped at\r\nour feet, for the city was under fire from the Hanoverian garrison at the\r\ncastle. Everywhere the clansmen were in evidence. Barefooted and\r\nbarelegged Celts strutted about the city with their bonnets scrugged low\r\non their heads, the hair hanging wild over their eyes and the matted\r\nbeards covering their faces. For the most part they were very ragged, and\r\ntanned exceedingly wherever the flesh took a peep through their outworn\r\nplaids. They ran about the streets in groups, looking in shop windows like\r\nchildren and talking their outlandish gibberish; then presently their\r\nHighland pride would assert itself at the smile of some chance passer and\r\nwould send them swinging proudly off as though they had better things at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOut of a tobacco shop came Captain Donald Roy singing blithely,\r\n\r\n                   "\'Will ye play me fair,\r\n                   Highland laddie, Highland laddie?\'"\r\n\r\nHe was of course in the full Macdonald tartan regimentals--checkered kilt,\r\nsporran, plaid, a brace of pistols, a dirk in his stocking, and claymore.\r\nAt sight of me his face lighted and he came running forward with both\r\nhands outstretched.\r\n\r\n"And is it you at last, Kenn? Man, but I\'ve been wearying for a sight of\r\nyour honest face. I was whiles thinking you must have given us the go-by.\r\nFegs, but it\'s a braw day and a sight guid for sair een to see you, lad.\r\nYou will have heard how we gave Johnnie Cope his kail through his reek."\r\nHe broke off to hum:--\r\n\r\n"\'Now Johnnie, troth, ye werena blate, to come wi\' the news o\' your ain,\r\nAnd leave your men in sic a strait, so early in the morning.\'\r\n\r\n"And did you bring my kinswoman back safe with you? I\'se wad ye found the\r\njourney no\' ower lang;" and he cocked a merry eye at me.\r\n\r\nI flushed, and introduced him to Major Macleod, who took occasion to thank\r\nhim for his services to his sister. They fell into a liking for each other\r\nat once. When the major was called aside by one of his gillies a moment\r\nlater, Macdonald expressed his trust of the other in the old Scotch\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n"Yon\'s a man to ride the water wi\', Kenneth."\r\n\r\nA curious sight illustrative of the Highland way of "lifting" what took\r\ntheir fancy occurred as we were all three walking toward the house of\r\nMacleod\'s aunt. Three shag-headed gillies in the tattered Cameron tartan\r\ndragged an innkeeper from his taproom and set him down squat on the\r\ncauseway. Without even a by-your-leave they took from his feet a pair of\r\nnew shoes with silver buckles. He protested that he was a loyal Jacobite.\r\n\r\n"Sae muckle ta better. She\'ll no\' grumble to shange a progue for the\r\nPrince\'s guid," one of the caterans answered cheerfully by way of\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise the two Highland gentlemen watched this high-handed\r\nproceeding with much amusement, enjoying not a little the ridiculous\r\nfigure cut by the frightened, sputtering host. I asked them if they were\r\nnot going to interfere.\r\n\r\n"What for would we do that at all events?" asked the Macdonald. "Man,\r\nMontagu, but you whiles have unco queer notions for so wise a lad. It\'s as\r\nnatural for a Hielander to despoil a Southron as for a goose to gang\r\nbarefit. What would Lochiel think gin we fashed wi\' his clansmen at their\r\nploy? Na, na! I wad be sweir to be sae upsitten (impertinent). It wadna be\r\ntellin\' a Macdonald, I\'m thinkin\'."\r\n\r\nAileen was so prettily glad to see her brother and so friendly with Donald\r\nRoy, so full of gay chatter and eager reminiscence, that I felt myself\r\nquite dashed by the note of reserve which crept into her voice and her\r\nmanner whenever she found it incumbent to speak to me. Her laugh would be\r\nringing clear as the echo of steel in frost, and when Donald lugged me\r\ninto the talk she would fall mim as a schoolgirl under the eye of her\r\ngoverness. Faith, you would have thought me her dearest enemy, instead of\r\nthe man that had risked life for her more than once. Here is a pretty\r\ngratitude, I would say to myself in a rage, hugging my anger with the baby\r\nthought that she would some day scourge herself for this after I were\r\nkilled in battle. Here is a fine return for loyal service rendered, and\r\nthe front of my offending is nothing more than the saluting an old\r\nplaymate.\r\n\r\n"Man, Kenneth, but you hae played the cuddie brawly," was Donald\'s\r\ncomforting remark to me after we had left. "You maun hae made an awfu\'\r\nbauchle of it. When last I saw the lady she hoisted a fine colour when I\r\ndaffed about you, and now she glowers at you in a no\' just friendly way."\r\n\r\nI admitted sadly that \'twas so and told him the reason, for Donald Roy had\r\na wide observation of life and a varied experience with the sex that made\r\nhim a valuable counsellor. The situation amused him hugely, but what he\r\ncould find of humour in it was more than I could see.\r\n\r\n"Deil hae\'t, but yon quean Antoinette will be a geyan ettercap (madcap).\r\nTony Creagh has been telling me about her; he\'s just a wee thingie touched\r\nthere himsel\'."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," I interrupted a little stiffly, "but I think I did not give\r\nthe name of the lady."\r\n\r\nThe Highlander looked at me dryly with a pawky smile.\r\n\r\n"Hoots, man! I ken that fine, but I\'m no a fule. You named over the party\r\nand I picked the lady that suited the speceefications." Then he began to\r\nchuckle: "I wad hae liked dooms weel to hae seen you stravaiging\r\n(wandering) through the grosset (gooseberry) bushes after the lass."\r\n\r\nI told him huffily that if that was all he could say I had better have\r\nkept the story to myself. I had come for advice, not to be laughed at.\r\nDonald flashed his winsome smile and linked an arm in mine.\r\n\r\n"Well then, and here\'s advice for you, man. Jouk (duck) and let the jaw\r\n(wave) go by. Gin it were me the colder she were the better I wad like it.\r\nDinna you see that the lass rages because she likes you fine; and since\r\nshe\'s a Hieland maid brought up under the blue lift she hasna learnt to\r\nhate and smile in the same breath."\r\n\r\n"I make neither head nor tail of your riddles," I told him impatiently.\r\n"By your way of it so far as I can make out she both likes and hates me.\r\nNow how can that be?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Macdonald\'s droll eye appeared to pity me. "Kenneth, bairn, but\r\nyou\'re an awfu\' ignoramus. You ken naething ava about the lassies. I\'m\r\nwondering what they learnt you at Oxford. Gin it\'s the same to you we\'ll\r\ntalk of something mair within your comprehension." And thereupon he\r\ndiverted the conversation to the impending invasion of England by the\r\nHighland army. Presently I asked him what he thought of the Prince now\r\nthat he had been given a chance to study the Young Chevalier at closer\r\nrange, and I shall never forget the eager Highlander\'s enthusiastic\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"From the head to the heel of him he is a son of Kings, kind-hearted,\r\ngallant, modest. He takes all hearts by storm. Our Highland laddie is the\r\nbravest man I ever saw, not to be rash, and the most cautious, not to be a\r\ncoward. But you will be judging for yourself when you are presented at the\r\nball on Tuesday."\r\n\r\nI told him that as yet I had no invitation to the ball.\r\n\r\n"That\'s easy seen to. The Chevalier O\'Sullivan makes out the list. I\'ll\r\ndrop a flea in his lug (ear)."\r\n\r\nNext day was Sunday, and I arrayed myself with great care to attend the\r\nchurch at which one Macvicar preached; to be frank I didn\'t care a flip of\r\nmy fingers what the doctrine was he preached; but I had adroitly wormed\r\nout of Miss MacBean that he was the pastor under whom she sat. Creagh\r\ncalled on me before I had set out, and I dragged him with me, he\r\nprotesting much at my unwonted devotion.\r\n\r\nI dare say he understood it better when he saw my eyes glued to the pew\r\nwhere Miss Aileen sat with her aunt in devout attention. What the sermon\r\nwas to have been about we never knew, on account of an interruption which\r\nprevented us from hearing it. During the long prayer I was comfortably\r\nwatching the back of Aileen\'s head and the quarter profile of her face\r\nwhen Creagh nudged me. I turned to find him looking at me out of a very\r\ncomical face, and this was the reason for it. The hardy Macvicar was\r\npraying for the Hanoverians and their cause.\r\n\r\n"Bless the King," he was saying boldly. "Thou knows what King I mean-- May\r\nthe crown sit easy on his head for lang. And for the young man that is\r\ncome among us to seek an earthly crown, we beseech Thee in mercy to take\r\nhim to Thyself, and give him a crown of glory."\r\n\r\nOne could have heard a pin fall in the hush, and then the tense rustle\r\nthat swept over the church and drowned the steady low voice that never\r\nfaltered in the prayer.\r\n\r\n"Egad, there\'s a hit for the Prince straight from the shoulder," chuckled\r\nthe Irishman by my side. "Faith, the Jacks are leaving the church to the\r\nWhigs. There goes the Major, Miss Macleod, and her aunt."\r\n\r\nHe was right. The prayer had ended and the Macleod party were sailing down\r\nthe aisle. Others followed suit, and presently we joined the stream that\r\npoured out of the building to show their disapproval. \'Tis an ill wind\r\nthat blows nobody good. Miss MacBean invited Creagh and me to join them in\r\ndinner, and methought that my goddess of disdain was the least thing\r\nwarmer to me than she had been in weeks. For the rest of the day I trod on\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCHARLES EDWARD STUART\r\n\r\n\r\nA beautifully engrossed invitation to the Prince\'s ball having duly\r\narrived from his Secretary the Chevalier O\'Sullivan, I ask you to believe\r\nthat my toilet Tuesday evening was even more a work of art than that of\r\nSunday. In huge disorder scarfs, lace cravats, muffs, and other necessary\r\nequipment were littered about the room. I much missed the neat touch of my\r\nvalet Simpkins, and the gillie Hamish Gorm, whom Major Macleod had put at\r\nmy service, did not supply his place by a deal, since he knew no more of\r\npatching the face or powdering a periwig than he had arrived at by the\r\nlight of nature. But despite this handicap I made shift to do myself\r\njustice before I set off for the lodgings of Lord Balmerino, by whom I was\r\nto be presented.\r\n\r\n\'Twas long since the Scottish capital had been so gay as now, for a part\r\nof the policy of the Young Chevalier was to wear a brave front before the\r\nworld. He and his few thousand Highlanders were pledged to a desperate\r\nundertaking, but it was essential that the waverers must not be allowed to\r\nsuspect how slender were the chances of success. One might have thought\r\nfrom the splendour of his court and from the serene confidence exhibited\r\nby the Prince and his chiefs that the Stuarts were already in peaceable\r\npossession of the entire dominions of their ancestors. A vast concourse of\r\nwell-dressed people thronged to Holyrood House from morning till night to\r\npresent their respects to Prince Charles Edward. His politeness and\r\naffability, as well as the charms of his conversation and the graces of\r\nhis person, swept the ladies especially from their lukewarm allegiance to\r\nthe Hanoverians. They would own no lover who did not don the white cockade\r\nof Jacobitism. They would hesitate at no sacrifice to advance the cause of\r\nthis romantic young gambler who used swords for dice. All this my three\r\ndays residence in the city had taught me. I was now to learn whether a\r\npersonal meeting with him would inspire me too with the ardent devotion\r\nthat animated my friends.\r\n\r\nA mixed assembly we found gathered in the picture gallery of Holyrood\r\nHouse. Here were French and Irish adventurers, Highland chiefs and Lowland\r\ngentlemen, all emulating each other in loyalty to the ladies who had\r\ngathered from all over Scotland to dance beneath the banner of the white\r\nrose. The Hall was a great blaze of moving colour, but above the tartans\r\nand the plaids, the mixed reds, greens, blues, and yellows, everywhere\r\nfluttered rampant the white streamers and cockades of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there were here sober hearts, full of anxious portent for the\r\nfuture, but on the surface at least was naught but merriment. The gayest\r\nabandon prevailed. Strathspey and reel and Highland fling alternated with\r\nthe graceful dances of France and the rollicking jigs of Ireland. Plainly\r\nthis was no state ceremonial, rather an international frolic to tune all\r\nhearts to a common glee. We were on the top of fortune\'s wave. Had we not\r\nwon for the Young Chevalier by the sword the ancient capital of his\r\nfamily, and did not the road to London invite us southward? The pipers of\r\neach clan in turn dirled out triumphant marches, and my heart began to\r\nbeat in faster time. Water must have filled the veins of a man who could\r\nstand unmoved such contagious enthusiasm. For me, I confess it, a climax\r\ncame a moment later that made my eyes swim.\r\n\r\nBalmerino was talking with Malcolm Macleod and James Hepburn of Keith, a\r\nmodel of manly simplicity and honour who had been "out" in the \'15; and as\r\nusual their talk fell on our enterprise and its gallant young leader.\r\nKeith narrated a story of how the Young Chevalier, after a long day\'s\r\nmarch on foot, had led the army three miles out of its way in order to\r\navoid disturbing the wife of a cottar who had fallen asleep at the\r\ncritical stage of a severe illness. Balmerino capped it with another\r\nanecdote of his dismounting from his horse after the battle of Gladsmuir\r\nto give water and attendance to a wounded English soldier of Cope\'s army.\r\n\r\nMacleod smiled, eyes sparkling. "He iss every inch the true prince. He can\r\ntramp the hills with a Highlander all day and never weary, he can sleep on\r\npease-straw as well as on a bed of down, can sup on brose in five minutes,\r\nand win a battle in four. Oh, yes, he will be the King for Malcolm\r\nMacleod."\r\n\r\nWhile he was still speaking there fell over the assembly a sudden\r\nstillness. The word was passed from lips to lips, "The Prince comes."\r\nEvery eye swept to the doorway. Men bowed deep and women curtsied low. A\r\nyoung man was entering slowly on the arm of Lord George Murray.\r\n\r\n"The Prince!" whispered Balmerino to me.\r\n\r\nThe pipes crashed out a measure of "Wha\'ll be King but Charlie?" then fell\r\ninto quiet sudden as they had begun. "Dhia theasirg an Righ!" (God save\r\nthe King) cried a splendid young Highland chief in a voice that echoed\r\nthrough the hall.\r\n\r\nClanranald\'s cry was lifted to the rafters by a hundred throats. A hundred\r\nclaymores leaped to air, and while the skirling bagpipes pealed forth,\r\n"The King shall enjoy his own again," Charles Stuart beneath an arch of\r\nshining steel trod slowly down the hall to a dais where his fathers had\r\nsat before him.\r\n\r\nIf the hearts of the ladies had surrendered at discretion, faith! we of\r\nthe other sex were not much tardier. The lad was every inch a prince. His\r\nafter life did not fulfil the promise of his youth, but at this time he\r\nwas one to see, and once having seen, to love. All the great charm of his\r\nrace found expression in him. Gallant, gracious, generous, tender-hearted\r\nin victory and cheerful in defeat (as we had soon to learn, alas!), even\r\nhis enemies confessed this young Stuart a worthy leader of men. Usually\r\nsuffused with a gentle pensiveness not unbecoming, the ardour of his\r\nwelcome had given him on this occasion the martial bearing of a heroic\r\nyoung Achilles. With flushed cheek and sparkling eye he ascended the\r\ndais.\r\n\r\n"Ladies, gentlemen, my loyal Highlanders, friends all, the tongue of\r\nCharles Stuart has no words to tell the warm message of his heart.\r\nUnfriended and alone he came among you, resolved with the help of good\r\nswords to win back that throne on which a usurper sits, or failing in that\r\nto perish in the attempt. How nobly you our people have rallied to our\r\nside in this undertaking to restore the ancient liberties of the kingdom\r\nneeds not be told. To the arbitrament of battle and to the will of God we\r\nconfidently appeal, and on our part we pledge our sacred honour neither to\r\nfalter nor to withdraw till this our purpose is accomplished. To this\r\ngreat task we stand plighted, so help us God and the right."\r\n\r\n\'Tis impossible to conceive the effect of these few simple sentences.\r\nAgain the pipes voiced our dumb emotion in that stirring song,\r\n\r\n                "We\'ll owre the water and owre the sea,\r\n                  We\'ll owre the water to Charlie;\r\n                Come weal, come woe, we\'ll gather and go,\r\n                  And live and die wi\' Charlie."\r\n\r\nThe mighty cheer broke forth again and seemed to rock the palace, but\r\ndeeper than all cheering was the feeling that found expression in\r\nlong-drawn breath and broken sob and glimmering tear. The gallant lad had\r\ntrusted us, had put his life in our keeping; we highly resolved to prove\r\nworthy of that trust.\r\n\r\nAt a signal from the Prince the musicians struck up again the dance, and\r\nbright eyes bedimmed with tears began to smile once more. With a whispered\r\nword Balmerino left me and made his way to the side of the Prince, about\r\nwhom were grouped the Duke of Perth, Lord Lewis Gordon, Lord Elcho, the\r\nill-fated Kilmarnock, as well as Lochiel, Cluny, Macleod, Clanranald, and\r\nother Highland gentlemen who had taken their fortune in their hands at the\r\ncall of this young adventurer with the enchanting smile. To see him was to\r\nunderstand the madness of devotion that had carried away these wise\r\ngray-haired gentlemen, but to those who never saw him I despair of\r\nconveying in cold type the subtle quality of charm that radiated from him.\r\nIn the very bloom of youth, tall, slender, and handsome, he had a grace of\r\nmanner not to be resisted. To condescend to the particulars of his person:\r\na face of perfect oval very regular in feature; large light blue eyes\r\nshaded by beautifully arched brows; nose good and of the Roman type;\r\ncomplexion fair, mouth something small and effeminate, forehead high and\r\nfull. He was possessed of the inimitable reserve and bearing that mark the\r\nroyal-born, and that despite his genial frankness. On this occasion he\r\nwore his usual light-coloured peruke with the natural hair combed over the\r\nfront, a tartan short coat on the breast of which shone the star of the\r\norder of St. Andrews, red velvet small-clothes, and a silver-hilted\r\nrapier. The plaid he ordinarily carried had been doffed for a blue sash\r\nwrought with gold.\r\n\r\nAll this I had time to note before Lord Balmerino rejoined me and led me\r\nforward to the presentation. The Prince separated himself from the group\r\nabout him and came lightly down the steps to meet me. I fell on my knee\r\nand kissed his hand, but the Prince, drawing me to my feet, embraced me.\r\n\r\n"My gallant Montagu," he cried warmly. "Like father, like son. God knows I\r\nwelcome you, both on your own account and because you are one of the first\r\nEnglish gentlemen to offer his sword to the cause of his King."\r\n\r\nI murmured that my sword would be at his service till death. To put me at\r\nmy ease he began to question me about the state of public feeling in\r\nEngland concerning the enterprise. What information I had was put at his\r\ndisposal, and I observed that his grasp of the situation appeared to be\r\nclear and incisive. He introduced me to the noblemen and chiefs about him,\r\nand I was wise enough to know that if they made much of me it was rather\r\nfor the class I was supposed to represent than for my own poor merits.\r\nPresently I fell back to make way for another gentleman about to be\r\npresented. Captain Macdonald made his way to me and offered a frank hand\r\nin congratulation.\r\n\r\n"\'Fore God, Montagu, you have leaped gey sudden into favour. Deil hae\'t,\r\nRed Donald brought with him a hundred claymores and he wasna half so\r\nkenspeckle (conspicuous). I\'ll wad your fortune\'s made, for you hae leaped\r\nin heels ower hurdies," he told me warmly.\r\n\r\nFrom affairs of state to those of the heart may be a long cast, but the\r\nmind of one-and-twenty takes it at a bound. My eye went questing, fell on\r\nmany a blushing maid and beaming matron, at last singled out my heart\'s\r\ndesire. She was teaching a Highland dance to a graceful cavalier in white\r\nsilk breeches, flowered satin waistcoat, and most choicely powdered\r\nperiwig, fresh from the friseur. His dainty muff and exquisite clouded\r\ncane depended from a silken loop to proclaim him the man of fashion.\r\nSomething characteristic in his easy manner, though I saw but his back,\r\nchilled me to an indefinable premonition of his identity. Yet an instant,\r\nand a turn in the dance figure flung into view the face of Sir Robert\r\nVolney, negligent and unperturbed, heedless apparently of the fact that\r\nany moment a hand might fall on his shoulder to lead him to his death.\r\nAileen, to the contrary, clearly showed fear, anxiety, a troubled mind--to\r\nbe detected in the hurried little glances of fearfulness directed toward\r\nher brother Malcolm, and in her plain eagerness to have done with the\r\nmeasure. She seemed to implore the baronet to depart, and Volney smilingly\r\nnegatived her appeal. The girl\'s affronted eyes dared him to believe that\r\nshe danced with him for any other reason than because he had staked his\r\nlife to see her again and she would not have his death at her door.\r\nDisdain of her own weakness and contempt of him were eloquent in every\r\nmovement of the lissom figure. \'Twas easy to be seen that the man was\r\nworking on her fears for him, in order to obtain another foothold with\r\nher. I resolved to baulk his scheme.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still making my way toward them through the throng they\r\ndisappeared from the assembly hall. A still hunt of five minutes, and I\r\nhad run down my prey in a snug little reception-room of a size to fit two\r\ncomfortably. The girl fronted him scornfully, eyes flaming.\r\n\r\n"Coward, you play on a girl\'s fears, you take advantage of her soft heart\r\nto force yourself on her," she was telling him in a low, bitter voice.\r\n\r\n"I risk my life to see the woman that I love," he answered.\r\n\r\n"My grief! Love! What will such a thing as you be knowing of love?"\r\n\r\nThe man winced. On my soul I believe that at last he was an honest lover.\r\nHis beautiful, speaking eyes looked straight into hers. His mannerisms had\r\nfor the moment been sponged out. Straight from the heart he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I have learnt, Aileen. My hunger for a sight of you has starved my folly\r\nand fed my love. Believe me, I am a changed man."\r\n\r\nThe play and curve of her lips stung him. He flung himself desperately\r\ninto his mad love-making. "\'Belle Marquise, vos beaux yeux me font mourir\r\nd\'amour,\'" he quoted from Moliere. "\'Tis true, Aileen; I die of love; it\r\nburns me up," he added passionately, hungry eyes devouring the flying\r\ncolours of her cheek, the mass of rippling hair, the fresh, sweet, subtle\r\nfragrance of her presence.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to hurry about it then, for on my soul you\'re due to die of\r\ntightened hemp to-morrow," I told him, lounging forward from the door.\r\n\r\nThe girl cried out, eyes dilating, hand pressing to the heart. For the\r\nman, after the first start he did not turn a hair. The face that looked\r\nover his shoulder at me was unmoved and bereft of emotion.\r\n\r\n"My malapropos friend Montagu again. Devil take it, you have an awkward\r\nway of playing harlequin when you\'re not wanted! Now to come blundering in\r\nupon a lady and her friend is-- Well, not the best of form. Better drop it\r\nbefore it becomes a habit," he advised.\r\n\r\n"\'Slife, \'tis tit for tat! I learnt it from you," was my answer.\r\n\r\nLong we looked at each other, preparing for the battle that was to come.\r\nSave for the quick breathing of the girl no sound fell.\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert, your audacity confounds all precedent," I said at last.\r\n\r\n"You flatter me, Mr. Montagu."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, had Major Macleod discovered you instead of me your soul had\r\nby this time been speeding hellward."\r\n\r\n"Exit Flattery," he laughed. "The lady phrased it less vilely. Heavenward,\r\nshe put it! \'Twould be interesting to know which of you is right."\r\n\r\n"As you say, an interesting topic of speculation, and one you\'re like to\r\nfind the answer of shortly, presupposing that you suffer the usual fate of\r\ncaptured spies."\r\n\r\nHis brows lifted in polite inquiry. "Indeed! A spy?" he asked,\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\n"Why not? The favourite of the Hanoverian usurpers discovered in our\r\nmidst--what other explanation will it bear?"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. "Perhaps I have a mind to join your barelegged rebellion."\r\n\r\n"Afraid your services are not available, Sir Robert. Three hundred Macleod\r\nclaymores bar the way, all eager to wipe out an insult to the daughter of\r\nRaasay. Faith, when they have settled their little account against you\r\nthere won\'t be much left for the Prince."\r\n\r\n"Ah! Then for the sake of argument suppose we put it that I\'m visiting\r\nthis delightful city for my health."\r\n\r\n"You will find the climate not agree with you, I fear."\r\n\r\n"Then say for pleasure."\r\n\r\n"\'Twill prove more exciting than amusing."\r\n\r\n"On my life, dear Kenn, \'tis both."\r\n\r\n"I have but to raise my voice and you are undone."\r\n\r\n"His voice was ever soft, gentle, and low, an excellent thing in Kenneth,"\r\nhe parodied, laughing at me.\r\n\r\nThe girl said never a word, but her level eyes watched me steadily. No\r\nneed of words to tell me that I was on trial! But I would not desist.\r\n\r\n"You appear not to realize the situation," I told him coldly. "Your life\r\nis in hazard."\r\n\r\nThe man yawned in my face. "Not at all, I sit here as safe as if I were at\r\nWhite\'s, and a devilish deal better satisfied. Situation piquant! Company\r\nof the best! Gad\'s life, I cry content."\r\n\r\n"I think we talk at cross purposes. I am trying to have you understand\r\nthat your position is critical, Sir Robert."\r\n\r\nNonchalant yet watchful, indolent and yet alert, gracefully graceless, he\r\nwatched me smilingly out of half-closed eyes; and then quietly fired the\r\nshot that brought me to.\r\n\r\n"If you were not a gentleman, Montagu, the situation would be vastly\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\n"I do not see the point," I told him; but I did, and raged at it.\r\n\r\n"I think you do. Your lips are sealed. I am your rival"--he bowed to\r\nAileen--"for the favour of a lady. If you put me out of the way by playing\r\ninformer what appearance will it bear? You may talk of duty till the world\r\nends, but you will be a marked man, despised by all--and most of all by\r\nKenneth Montagu."\r\n\r\nThe man was right. At one sweep he had spiked my guns, demolished my\r\ndefenses. The triumph was sponged from my face. I fumed in a stress of\r\nimpotence.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. I shall have to think of it. There is a duty to\r\nperform," I said at last, lamely.\r\n\r\nHe waved a hand airily. "My dear fellow, think as long as you please. You\r\ncan\'t think away facts. Egad, they\'re immutable. You know me to be no spy.\r\nConceded that I am in a false position. What can you do about it? You\r\ncan\'t in honour give me up. I\'faith, you\'re handcuffed to inaction."\r\n\r\nI was, but my temper was not improved at hearing him tell it me so suavely\r\nand so blandly. He sat smiling and triumphant, chuckling no doubt at the\r\ndilemma into which he had thrust me. The worst of it was that while I was\r\nostensibly master of the situation he had me at his mercy. I was a\r\nhelpless victor without any of the fruits of victory.\r\n\r\n"You took advantage of a girl\'s soft heart to put her in a position that\r\nwas indefensible," I told him with bitter bluntness. "Save this of\r\nthrowing yourself on her mercy there was no other way of approaching her.\r\nOf the wisdom of the serpent you have no lack. I congratulate you, Sir\r\nRobert. But one may be permitted to doubt the manliness of such a\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\nThe pipers struck up a song that was the vogue among our party, and a\r\nyoung man passed the entrance of the room singing it.\r\n\r\n             "Oh, it\'s owre the border awa\', awa\',\r\n               It\'s owre the border awa\', awa\',\r\n             We\'ll on an\' we\'ll march to Carlisle Ha\',\r\n               Wi\' its yetts, its castles, an\' a\', an\' a\'."\r\n\r\nThe audacious villain parodied it on the spot, substituting two lines of\r\nhis own for the last ones.\r\n\r\n              "You\'ll on an\' you\'ll march to Carlisle Ha\',\r\n                To be hanged and quartered an\' a\', an\' a\',"\r\n\r\nhe hummed softly in his clipped English tongue.\r\n\r\n"Pity you won\'t live to see it," I retorted tartly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re still nursing that maggot, are you? Debating with yourself about\r\ngiving me up, eh? Well that\'s a matter you must settle with your\r\nconscience, if you indulge in the luxury of one."\r\n\r\n"You would never give him up, Kenneth," said Aileen in a low voice.\r\n"Surely you would not be doing that."\r\n\r\n"I shall not let him stay here. You may be sure of that," I said\r\ndoggedly.\r\n\r\nThe girl ventured a suggestion timidly. "Perhaps Sir Robert will be\r\nleaving to-morrow--for London mayhap."\r\n\r\nVolney shook his head decisively. "Not I. Why, I have but just arrived.\r\nBesides, here is a problem in ethics for Mr. Montagu to solve. Strength\r\ncomes through conflict, so the schools teach. Far be it from me to remove\r\nthe cause of doubt. Let him solve his problem for himself, egad!"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to find a feline pleasure in seeing how far he could taunt me to\r\ngo. He held me on the knife-edge of irritation, and perillous as was the\r\nexperiment he enjoyed seeing whether he could not drive me to give him\r\nup.\r\n\r\n"Miss Macleod\'s solution falls pat. Better leave to-morrow, Sir Robert. To\r\nstay is dangerous."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my\r\nlord fool, \'out of this nettle danger, we pluck this flower safety,\'" he\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n"I see you always have your tag of Shakespeare ready; then let me remind\r\nyou what he has to say about the better part of valour," I flung back, for\r\nonce alert in riposte.\r\n\r\n"A hit, and from the same play," he laughed. "But a retreat-- \'Tis not to\r\nbe thought of. No, no, Montagu! And it must be you\'ll just have to give me\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you harp on that! You may say it once too often. I shall find a way\r\nto get rid of you," I answered blackly.\r\n\r\n"Let me find it for you, lad," said a voice from the doorway.\r\n\r\nWe turned, to find that Donald Roy had joined the party. He must have been\r\nstanding there unobserved long enough to understand my dilemma, for he\r\nshot straight to the mark.\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert, I\'ll never be denying that you\'re a bold villain, and that is\r\nthe one thing that will be saving your life this night. I\'m no\' here to\r\nargie-bargie with you. The plain fact is just this; that I dinna care a\r\nrap for you the tane gate or the tither (the one way or the other). I\'d\r\nlike fine to see you dancing frae the widdie (gallows), but gin the lady\r\nwants you spared I\'ll no\' say her no. Mr. Englisher, you\'ll just gie me\r\nyour word to tak the road for the border this night, or I\'ll give a bit\r\ncall to Major Macleod. I wouldna wonder but he wad be blithe to see you.\r\nIs it to be the road or the Macleod?"\r\n\r\nI could have kissed the honest trusty face of the man, for he had lifted\r\nme out of a bog of unease. I might be bound by honour, but Captain\r\nMacdonald was free as air to dictate terms. Volney looked long at him,\r\nweighed the man, and in the end flung up the sponge. He rose to his feet\r\nand sauntered over to Aileen.\r\n\r\n"I am desolated to find that urgent business takes me south at once, Miss\r\nMacleod. \'Tis a matter of the gravest calls me; nothing of less importance\r\nthan the life of my nearest friend would take me from you. But I\'m afraid\r\nit must be \'Au revoir\' for the present," he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked past the man as if he had not existed.\r\n\r\nHe bowed low, the flattery of deference in his fine eyes, which knew so\r\nwell how to be at once both bold and timid.\r\n\r\n"Forgiven my madness?" he murmured.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to say, she still said it eloquently. Volney bowed himself\r\nout of the room, nodded carelessly to me as he passed, touched Macdonald\r\non the arm with a pleasant promise to attend the obsequies when the\r\nHighlander should be brought to London for his hanging, lounged elegantly\r\nthrough the crowded assembly hall, and disappeared into the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nBLUE BONNETS ARE OVER THE BORDER\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day I enrolled myself as a gentleman volunteer in Lord Balmerino\'s\r\ntroop of horse-guards, and was at once appointed to a lieutenancy. In\r\nwaiting for reinforcements and in making preparations for the invasion\r\nthree weeks were lost, but at last, on the 31st of October, came the order\r\nfor the march. We had that day been joined by Cluny Macpherson at the head\r\nof his clan Pherson, by Menzies of Shien, and by several other small\r\nbodies of Highlanders. All told our force amounted to less than five\r\nthousand men, but the rapidity of our movements and the impetuous\r\ngallantry of the clansmen made the enterprise less mad than it appeared\r\nupon the face of it. Moreover we expected to be largely reinforced by\r\nrecruits who were to declare themselves as we marched south.\r\n\r\nIt may be guessed that the last hour of leisure I had in the city was\r\nspent with Aileen. Of that hour the greater part of it was worse than\r\nlost, for a thickheaded, long-legged oaf of an Ayrshire laird shared the\r\nroom with us and hung to his chair with dogged persistency the while my\r\nimagination rioted in diverse forms of sudden death for him. Nor did it\r\nlessen my impatience to know that the girl was laughing in her sleeve at\r\nmy restlessness. She took a malicious pleasure in drawing out her\r\nhobnailed admirer on the interesting subject of sheep-rot. At last, having\r\ntormented me to the limit of prudence, she got rid of him. To say truth,\r\nMiss Aileen had for weeks held me on the tenter-hooks of doubt, now in\r\nhigh hope, far more often in black despair. She had become very popular\r\nwith the young men who had declared in favour of the exiled family, and I\r\nnever called without finding some colour-splashed Gael or broad-tongued\r\nLowland laird in dalliance. \'Twas impossible to get a word with her alone.\r\nHer admirers were forever shutting off the sunlight from me.\r\n\r\nAileen was sewing on a white satin cockade, which the man from Ayrshire,\r\nin the intervals between the paragraphs of his lecture on the sheep\r\nindustry, had been extremely solicitous of obtaining for a favour. \'Twas a\r\nsatisfaction to me that my rustic friend departed without it. He was no\r\nsooner gone than I came near and perched myself on the arm of a chair\r\nbeside the girl. For a minute I sat watching in silence the deft movements\r\nof the firm brown hands in which were both delicacy and power.\r\n\r\nThen, "For Malcolm?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"No-o."\r\n\r\n"For whom then?"\r\n\r\n"For a brave gentleman who iss marching south with the Prince--a kind\r\nfriend of mine."\r\n\r\n"You seem to have many of them. For which one is the favour?" I queried, a\r\nlittle bitterly.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me askance, demure yet whimsical.\r\n\r\n"You will can tell when you see him wearing it."\r\n\r\nI fell sulky, at the which mirth bubbled up in her.\r\n\r\n"Is he as good a friend as I am, this fine lover of yours?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Every whit." Mockery of my sullenness danced in her blue eyes.\r\n\r\n"And do you--like him as well?" I blurted out, face flaming.\r\n\r\nShe nodded yes, gaily, without the least sentiment in the world.\r\n\r\nI flung away in a pet. "You\'re always laughing at me. By Heaven, I won\'t\r\nbe made a fool of by any girl!"\r\n\r\nThe corners of her eyes puckered to fresh laughter. "Troth, and you needna\r\nfear, Kenneth. No girl will can do that for you."\r\n\r\n"Well then," I was beginning, half placated at the apparent flattery, but\r\nstopped with a sudden divination of her meaning. "You think me a fool\r\nalready. Is that it?"\r\n\r\n"I wass thinking that maybe you werena showing the good gumption this day,\r\nMr. Kenneth Montagu."\r\n\r\nMy pride and my misery shook hands. I came back to blurt out in boyish\r\nfashion,\r\n\r\n"Let us not quarrel again to-day, Aileen, and--do not laugh at me these\r\nlast few minutes. We march this afternoon. The order has been given out."\r\n\r\nHer hands dropped to her lap. Save where a spot of faint red burned in\r\neither cheek the colour ran out of her face. I drove my news home, playing\r\nfor a sign of her love, desiring to reach the spring of her tears.\r\n\r\n"Some of us will never cross the border twice," I said.\r\n\r\nMy news had flung a shadow across the bright track of her gayety. \'Tis one\r\nthing for a high-spirited woman to buckle on the sword of her friend; \'tis\r\nanother to see him go out to the fight.\r\n\r\n"Let us not be thinking of that at all, Kenneth," she cried.\r\n\r\n"Why not? \'Tis a fact to face," I insisted cruelly. "There\'ll be many a\r\nmerry lusty gentleman lying quiet under the sod, Aileen, before we reach\r\nLondon town. From the ownership of broad moorland and large steading they\r\nwill come down to own no more of earth than six foot by two."\r\n\r\n"They will be dying as brave gentlemen should," she said, softly, her\r\nvoice full of tears.\r\n\r\n"And if I am one of them?" I asked, making a more home thrust.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood there tall, slim, pallid, head thrown back, the pulse in\r\nthe white curved throat beating fast.\r\n\r\n"Oh Kenneth, you will not be," she cried piteously.\r\n\r\n"But if I am?"\r\n\r\n"Please, Kenneth?" Her low voice implored me to desist; so too the deep\r\nbillowing breasts and melting eyes.\r\n\r\n"The fighting will be sharp and our losses heavy. It\'s his death many a\r\nman is going to, Aileen."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and if you will be believing me, Kenneth, the harder part iss for\r\nthose of us who cannot fight but must wear away the long days and mirk\r\nnights at home. At the least I am thinking so whatever. The long live day\r\nwe sit, and can do nothing but wait and wait. After every fight will not\r\nsome mother be crooning the coronach for her dear son? Every glen will\r\nhave its wailing wife and its fatherless bairns. And there will be the\r\nlovers too for whom there iss the driech wait, forby (besides) that maybe\r\ntheir dearest will be lying under the rowans with their een steekit (eyes\r\nfixed) in death."\r\n\r\n"There are some of us who have neither mother, wife, nor lover. Will there\r\nbe none to spare a tear for us if we fall?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, and there will, but"--a wan little smile broke through the film\r\nof gathering tears--"we will be waiting till they are needed, and we will\r\nbe praying that the evil day may never come."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hoping that myself," I told her, smiling, "but hope never turns aside\r\nthe leaden bullet."\r\n\r\n"Prayers may," she answered quickly, the shy lids lifting from the blue\r\neyes bravely to meet my look, "and you will never be wanting (lacking)\r\nmine, my friend." Then with the quick change of mood that was so\r\ncharacteristic of her, she added: "But I will be the poor friend, to fash\r\n(bother) you with all these clavers (idle talk) when I should be\r\nheartening you. You are glad to be going, are you not?"\r\n\r\nAll the romance and uplift of our cause thrilled through me.\r\n\r\n"By God, yes! When my King calls I go."\r\n\r\nHer eyes shone on me, tender, wistful, proud.\r\n\r\n"And that\'s the true word, Kenneth. It goes to the heart of your friend."\r\n\r\n"To hear you say that rewards me a hundred times, dear."\r\n\r\nI rose to go. She asked, "Must you be leaving already?"\r\n\r\nWhen I told her "Yes!" she came forward and shyly pinned the cockade on\r\nthe lapel of my coat. I drew a deep breath and spoke from a husky throat.\r\n\r\n"God bless you for that, Aileen girl."\r\n\r\nI was in two minds then about taking her in my arms and crying out that I\r\nloved her, but I remembered that I had made compact with myself not to\r\nspeak till the campaign was ended and the Prince seated as regent on his\r\nfather\'s throne. With a full heart I wrung her hand in silence and turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles and his life-guards, at the head of the army, moved from\r\nHolyrood to Pinkie-house that afternoon. A vast concourse of people were\r\ngathered to cheer us on our way, as we passed through the streets to the\r\nsound of the pipes and fife and beating drum. More than one twisted\r\ncripple flung himself before the horse of the Prince, begging for "the\r\nKing\'s touch." In each case the Young Chevalier disclaimed any power of\r\nhealing, but his kindly heart forbade his denying the piteous appeal. With\r\na slight smile of sympathy he would comply with the request, saying, "I\r\ntouch, but God heal." At the head of each clan-regiment rode its chief,\r\nand in front of every company the captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, all\r\nof whom were gentlemen of the clan related by blood ties to the chief.\r\nThough I say it who was one of them, never a more devoted little army went\r\nout on a madder or more daring enterprise.\r\n\r\nJust one more glimpse of Aileen I got to carry with me through weary\r\nmonths of desire. From the window of her aunt\'s house she was waving a\r\ntartan scarf, and many a rugged kerne\'s face lighted at the girl\'s eager\r\nloyalty. Flushed with shy daring, the soft pliant curves of her figure all\r\nyouth and grace, my love\'s picture framed in the casement was an\r\nunconscious magnet for all eyes. The Prince smiled and bowed to her, then\r\nsaid something which I did not catch to Creagh who was riding beside him.\r\nThe Irishman laughed and looked over at me, as did also the Prince. His\r\nHighness asked another question or two, and presently Tony fell into\r\nnarration. From the young Stuart Prince\'s curious looks at me \'twas plain\r\nto be seen that Creagh was recounting the tale of my adventures. Once I\r\nheard the Prince exclaim, "What! That boy?" More than once he laughed\r\nheartily, for Creagh was an inimitable story-teller and every point to be\r\nscored in the telling gained sparkle from his Irish wit. When he had\r\nfinished Prince Charles sent for me and congratulated me warmly on the\r\nboldness and the aplomb (so he was kind enough to phrase it) which had\r\ncarried me through devious dangers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCULLODEN\r\n\r\n\r\nI have neither space nor heart to attempt a history of our brilliant but\r\nill-starred campaign. Surely no more romantic attempt to win a throne was\r\never made. With some few thousand ill-armed Highlanders and a handful of\r\nlowland recruits the Prince cut his way through the heart of England,\r\ndefeated two armies and repulsed a third, each of them larger than his own\r\nand far better supplied with the munitions of war, captured Carlisle,\r\nManchester, and other towns, even pushed his army beyond Derby to a point\r\nlittle more than a hundred miles from London. Had the gentlemen of England\r\nwho believed in our cause been possessed of the same spirit of devotion\r\nthat animated these wild Highlanders we had unseated the Hanoverians out\r\nof doubt, but their loyalty was not strong enough to outweigh the\r\nprudential considerations that held them back. Their doubts held them\r\ninactive until too late.\r\n\r\nThere are some who maintain that had we pushed on from Derby, defeated the\r\narmy of the Duke of Cumberland, of which the chance at this time was good,\r\nand swept on to London, that George II would have been sent flying to his\r\nbeloved Hanover. We know now in what a state of wild excitement the\r\ncapital city was awaiting news of our approach, how the household\r\ntreasures of the Guelphs were all packed, how there was a run on the Bank\r\nof England, how even the Duke of Newcastle, prime minister of Great\r\nBritain, locked himself in his chamber all day denying admittance to all\r\nin an agony of doubt as to whether he had better declare at once for the\r\nStuarts. We know too that the Wynns and other loyal Welsh gentlemen had\r\nalready set out to rally their country for the honest cause, that cautious\r\nFrance was about to send an army to our assistance.\r\n\r\nBut all this was knowledge too late acquired. The great fact that\r\nconfronted us was that without a French army to assist, our English\r\nfriends would not redeem their contingent pledges. We were numerically of\r\nno greater force than when we had set out from Scotland, and the hazard of\r\nan advance was too great. General Wade and the Duke of Cumberland were\r\nclosing in on us from different sides, each with an army that outnumbered\r\nours, and a third army was waiting for us before London. \'Tis just\r\npossible that we might have taken the desperate chance and won, as the\r\nPrince was so eager that we should do, but it was to be considered that as\r\na defeated army in a hostile country, had the fortune of war declared\r\nagainst us, we would surely have been cut to pieces in our retreat. By\r\nLord George Murray and the chiefs it was judged wiser to fall back and\r\njoin Lord John Drummond\'s army in Scotland. They declared that they would\r\nfollow wherever the Prince chose to lead, but that they felt strongly that\r\na further advance was to doom their clansmen to destruction. Reluctantly\r\nthe Prince gave way.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December, before daybreak, the army began its retreat, which\r\nwas conducted with great skill by Lord George Murray. Never were men more\r\ndisappointed than the rank and file of the army when they found that a\r\nretreat had been resolved upon. Expressions of chagrin and disappointment\r\nwere to be heard on every hand. But the necessity of the retreat was soon\r\napparent to all, for the regulars were now closing in on us from every\r\nhand. By out-marching and out-maneuvering General Wade, we beat him to\r\nLancaster, but his horse were entering the town before we had left the\r\nsuburbs. At Clifton the Duke of Cumberland, having joined forces with\r\nWade, came in touch with us, and his van was soundly drubbed by our\r\nrear-guard under Lord George, who had with him at the time the Stewarts of\r\nAppin, the Macphersons, Colonel Stuart\'s regiment, and Donald Roy\'s\r\nMacdonalds. By great good chance I arrived with a message to Lord George\r\nfrom the Prince in time to take part in this brilliant little affair. With\r\nhis usual wisdom Lord George had posted his men in the enclosures and park\r\nof Lowther Hall, the Macdonalds on the right of the highway, Colonel\r\nStuart in close proximity, and the Macphersons and the Appin regiment to\r\nthe left of the road. I dismounted, tied my horse, and joined the Red\r\nMacdonald\'s company where they were lying in the shrubbery. We lay there a\r\ndevil of a while, Donald Roy smoking as contented as you please, I in a\r\nstew of impatience and excitement; presently we could hear firing over to\r\nthe left where Cluny Macpherson and Stewart of Ardshiel were feeling the\r\nenemy and driving them back. At last the order came to advance. Donald Roy\r\nleaped to his feet, waved his sword and shouted "Claymore!" Next moment we\r\nwere rushing pell-mell down the hillside through the thick gorse, over\r\nhedges, and across ditches. We met the dragoons in full retreat across the\r\nmoor at right angles toward us, raked them with a cross fire, and coming\r\nto close quarters cut them to pieces with the sword. In this little\r\nskirmish, which lasted less than a quarter of an hour, our loss was\r\ninsignificant, while that of the enemy reached well into the three\r\nfigures. The result of this engagement was that our army was extricated\r\nfrom a precarious position and that Cumberland allowed us henceforth to\r\nretreat at leisure without fear of molestation.\r\n\r\nOf the good fortune which almost invariably attended our various\r\ndetachments in the North, of our retreat to Scotland and easy victory over\r\nGeneral Hawley at the battle of Falkirk, and of the jealousies and\r\nmachinations of Secretary Murray and the Irish Prince\'s advisers,\r\nparticularly O\'Sullivan and Sir Thomas Sheridan, against Lord George\r\nMurray and the chiefs, I can here make no mention, but come at once to the\r\ndisastrous battle of Culloden which put a period to our hopes. A number of\r\nunfortunate circumstances had conspired to weaken us. According to the\r\nHighland custom, many of the troops, seeing no need of their immediate\r\npresence, had retired temporarily to their homes. Several of the clan\r\nregiments were absent on forays and other military expeditions. The\r\nChevalier O\'Sullivan, who had charge of the commissariat department, had\r\nfrom gross negligence managed to let the army get into a state bordering\r\non starvation, and that though there was a quantity of meal in Inverness\r\nsufficient for a fortnight\'s consumption. The man had allowed the army to\r\nmarch from the town without provisions, and the result was that at the\r\ntime of the battle most of the troops had tasted but a single biscuit in\r\ntwo days. To cap all, the men were deadly wearied by the long night march\r\nto surprise the Duke of Cumberland\'s army and their dejected return to\r\nDrummossie Moor after the failure of the attempt. Many of the men and\r\nofficers slipped away to Inverness in search of refreshments, being on the\r\nverge of starvation; others flung themselves down on the heath, sullen,\r\ndejected, and exhausted, to forget their hunger for the moment in sleep.\r\n\r\nWithout dubiety our plain course was to have fallen back across the Nairn\r\namong the hills and let the Duke weary his troops trying to drag his\r\nartillery up the mountainsides. The battle might easily have been\r\npostponed for several days until our troops were again rested, fed, and in\r\ngood spirits. Lord George pointed out at the counsel that a further reason\r\nfor delay lay in the fact that the Mackenzies under Lord Cromarty, the\r\nsecond battalion of the Frasers under the Master of Lovat, the Macphersons\r\nunder Cluny, the Macgregors under Glengyle, Mackinnon\'s followers, and the\r\nGlengary Macdonald\'s under Barisdale were all on the march to join us and\r\nwould arrive in the course of a day or two. That with these\r\nreinforcements, and in the hill country, so eminently suited to our method\r\nof warfare, we might make sure of a complete victory, was urged by him and\r\nothers. But O\'Sullivan and his friends had again obtained the ear of the\r\nPrince and urged him to immediate battle. This advice jumped with his own\r\nhigh spirit, for he could not brook to fall back in the face of the enemy\r\nawaiting the conflict. The order went forth to gather the clans for the\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nTo make full the tale of his misdeeds came O\'Sullivan\'s fatal slight to\r\nthe pride of the Macdonalds. Since the days of Robert the Bruce and\r\nBannockburn it had been their clan privilege to hold the post of honour on\r\nthe right. The blundering Irishman assigned this position to the Athole\r\nmen in forming the line of battle, and stubbornly refused to reform his\r\nline. The Duke of Perth, who commanded on the left wing, endeavoured to\r\nplacate the clan by vowing that they would that day make a right of the\r\nleft and promising to change his name to Macdonald after the victory.\r\nRiding to the Duke with a message from the Prince I chanced on a man lying\r\nface down among the whin bushes. For the moment I supposed him dead, till\r\nhe lifted himself to an elbow. The man turned to me a gash face the colour\r\nof whey, and I saw that it was Donald Roy.\r\n\r\n"Ohon! Ohon! The evil day hass fallen on us, Kenneth. Five hundred years\r\nthe Macdonalds have held the post of honour. They will never fight on the\r\nleft," he told me in bitter despair and grief. "Wae\'s me! The red death\r\ngrips us. Old MacEuan who hass the second sight saw a vision in the night\r\nof Cumberland\'s ridens driving over a field lost to the North. Death on\r\nthe field and on the scaffold."\r\n\r\nI have never known a man of saner common sense than Donald Roy, but when\r\nit comes to their superstitions all Highlanders are alike. As well I might\r\nhave reasoned with a wooden post. MacEuan of the seeing eyes had predicted\r\ndisaster, and calamity was to be our portion.\r\n\r\nHe joined me and walked beside my horse toward his command. The firing was\r\nby this time very heavy, our cannon being quite ineffective and the\r\nartillery of the English well served and deadly. Their guns, charged with\r\ncartouch, flung death wholesale across the ravine at us and decimated our\r\nranks. The grape-shot swept through us like a hail-storm. Galled beyond\r\nendurance by the fire of the enemy, the clans clamoured to be led forward\r\nin the charge. Presently through the lifting smoke we saw the devoted\r\nMackintoshes rushing forward against the cannon. After them came the\r\nMaclaughlans and the Macleans to their left, and a moment later the whole\r\nHighland line was in motion with the exception of the Macdonalds, who\r\nhewed the turf with their swords in a despairing rage but would neither\r\nfight nor fly. Their chief, brave Keppoch, stung to the quick, advanced\r\nalmost alone, courting death rather than to survive the day\'s disgrace.\r\nCaptain Donald Roy followed at his heels, imploring his chieftain not to\r\nsacrifice himself, but Keppoch bade him save himself. For him, he would\r\nnever see the sunrise again. Next moment he fell to the ground from a\r\nmusket-shot, never to speak more. My last glimpse of Captain Roy was to\r\nsee him carrying back the body of his chief.\r\n\r\nI rode back at a gallop along the ridge to my troop. The valley below was\r\na shambles. The English cannon tore great gaps in the ranks of the\r\nadvancing Highlanders. The incessant fire of the infantry raked them. From\r\nthe left wing Major Wolfe\'s regiment poured an unceasing flank fire of\r\nmusketry. The Highlanders fell in platoons. Still they swept forward\r\nheadlong. They reached the first line of the enemy. \'Twas claymore against\r\nbayonet. Another minute, and the Highlanders had trampled down the\r\nregulars and were pushing on in impetuous gallantry. The thin tartan line\r\nclambering up the opposite side of the ravine grew thinner as the\r\ngrape-shot carried havoc to their ranks. Cobham\'s and Kerr\'s dragoons\r\nflanked them _en potence_. To stand that hell of fire was more than mortal\r\nmen could endure. Scarce a dozen clansmen reached the second line of\r\nregulars. The rest turned and cut their way, sword in hand, through the\r\nflanking regiments which had formed on the ground over which they had just\r\npassed with the intention of barring the retreat.\r\n\r\nOur life-guards and the French pickets, together with Ogilvy\'s regiment,\r\nchecked in some measure the pursuit, but nothing could be done to save the\r\nday. All was irretrievably lost, though the Prince galloped over the field\r\nattempting a rally. The retreat became a rout, and the rout a panic. As\r\nfar as Inverness the ground was strewn with the dead slain in that ghastly\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nThe atrocities committed after the battle would have been worthy of\r\nsavages rather than of civilized troops. Many of the inhabitants of\r\nInverness had come out to see the battle from curiosity and were cut down\r\nby the infuriated cavalry. The carnage of the battle appeared not to\r\nsatiate their horrid thirst for blood, and the troopers, bearing in mind\r\ntheir disgrace at Gladsmuir and Falkirk, rushed to and fro over the field\r\nmassacring the wounded. I could ask any fair-minded judge to set up\r\nagainst this barbarity the gentle consideration and tenderness of Prince\r\nCharles and his wild Highlanders in their hours of victory. We never slew\r\na man except in the heat of fight, and the wounded of the enemy were\r\nalways cared for with the greatest solicitude. From this one may conclude\r\nthat the bravest troops are the most humane. These followers of the Duke\r\nhad disgraced themselves, and they ran to an excess of cruelty in an\r\nattempt to wipe out their cowardice.\r\n\r\nNor was it the soldiery alone that committed excesses. I regret to have to\r\nrecord that many of the officers also engaged in them. A party was\r\ndispatched from Inverness the day after the battle to put to death all the\r\nwounded they might find in the inclosures of Culloden Park near the field\r\nof the contest. A young Highlander serving with the English army was\r\nafterwards heard to declare that he saw seventy-two unfortunate victims\r\ndragged from their hiding in the heather to hillocks and shot down by\r\nvolleys of musketry. Into a small sheep hut on the moor some of our\r\nwounded had dragged themselves. The dragoons secured the door and fired\r\nthe hut. One instance of singular atrocity is vouched for. Nineteen\r\nwounded Highland officers, too badly injured to join the retreat, secreted\r\nthemselves in a small plantation near Culloden-house, to which mansion\r\nthey were afterward taken. After being allowed to lie without care\r\ntwenty-four hours they were tossed into carts, carried to the wall of the\r\npark, ranged against it in a row, and instantly shot. I myself was a\r\nwitness of one incident which touches the butcher of Cumberland nearly. If\r\nI relate the affair, \'tis because it falls pat with the narrative of my\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nIn the streets of Inverness I ran across Major Macleod gathering together\r\nthe remnant of his command to check the pursuit until the Prince should\r\nhave escaped. The man had just come from seeing his brave clansmen mowed\r\ndown, and his face looked like death.\r\n\r\n"The Prince-- Did he escape?" I asked. "I saw him last trying to stem the\r\ntide, with Sheridan and O\'Sullivan tugging at his reins to induce a\r\nflight."\r\n\r\nThe Macleod nodded. "They passed through the town not five minutes ago."\r\n\r\nI asked him whether he had seen anything of Captain Roy Macdonald, and he\r\ntold me that he had last seen him lying wounded on the field. I had him\r\ndescribe to me accurately the position, and rode back by a wide circuit\r\ntoward Drummossie Moor. I had of course torn off the white cockade and put\r\nit in my breast so as to minimize the danger of being recognized as a\r\nfollower of the Prince. My heart goes to my throat whenever I think of\r\nthat ride, for behind every clump of whins one might look to find a\r\nwounded clansman hiding from the riders of Cumberland. By good providence\r\nI came on Captain Macdonald just as three hussars were about to make an\r\nend of him. He had his back to a great stone, and was waiting grimly for\r\nthem to shoot him down. Supposing me to be an officer of their party the\r\ntroopers desisted at my remonstrance and left him to me. Donald Roy was\r\nwounded in the foot, but he managed to mount behind me. We got as far as\r\nthe wall of the park when I saw a party of officers approaching. Hastily\r\ndismounting, we led the horse behind a nest of birches till they should\r\npass. A few yards from us a sorely wounded Highland officer was lying.\r\nMacdonald recognized him as Charles Fraser, younger of Inverallachie, the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the Fraser regiment and in the absence of the Master\r\nof Lovat commander. We found no time to drag him to safety before the\r\nEnglish officers were upon us.\r\n\r\nThe approaching party turned out to be the Duke of Cumberland himself,\r\nMajor Wolfe, Lord Boyd, Sir Robert Volney, and a boy officer of Wolfe\'s\r\nregiment. Young Fraser raised himself on his elbow to look at the Duke.\r\nThe Butcher reined in his horse, frowning blackly down at him.\r\n\r\n"To which side do you belong?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"To the Prince," was the undaunted answer.\r\n\r\nCumberland, turning to Major Wolfe, said,\r\n\r\n"Major, are your pistols loaded?"\r\n\r\nWolfe said that they were.\r\n\r\n"Then shoot me that Highland scoundrel who dares look on me so\r\ninsolently."\r\n\r\nMajor Wolfe looked at his commander very steadily and said quietly: "Sir,\r\nmy commission is at the disposal of your Royal Highness, but my honour is\r\nmy own. I can never consent to become a common executioner."\r\n\r\nThe Duke purpled, and burst out with, "Bah! Pistol him, Boyd."\r\n\r\n"Your Highness asks what is not fitting for you to require nor for me to\r\nperform," answered that young nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, in a fury, turned to a passing dragoon and bade him shoot the\r\nyoung man. Charles Fraser dragged himself to his feet by a great effort\r\nand looked at the butcher with a face of infinite scorn while the soldier\r\nwas loading his piece.\r\n\r\n"Your Highness," began Wolfe, about to remonstrate.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I command you to be silent," screamed the Duke.\r\n\r\nThe trooper presented his piece at the Fraser, whose steady eyes never\r\nleft the face of Cumberland.\r\n\r\n"God save King James!" cried Inverallachie in English, and next moment\r\nfell dead from the discharge of the musket.\r\n\r\nThe faces of the four Englishmen who rode with the Duke were stern and\r\ndrawn. Wolfe dismounted from his horse and reverently covered the face of\r\nthe dead Jacobite with a kerchief.\r\n\r\n"God grant that when our time comes we may die as valiantly and as loyally\r\nas this young gentleman," he said solemnly, raising his hat.\r\n\r\nVolney, Boyd, and Wolfe\'s subaltern uncovered, and echoed an "Amen."\r\nCumberland glared from one to another of them, ran the gamut of all tints\r\nfrom pink to deepest purple, gulped out an apoplectic Dutch oath, and dug\r\nthe rowels deep into his bay. With shame, sorrow, and contempt in their\r\nhearts his retinue followed the butcher across the field.\r\n\r\nMy face was like the melting winter snows. I could not look at the\r\nMacdonald, nor he at me. We mounted in silence and rode away. Only once he\r\nreferred to what we had seen.\r\n\r\n"Many\'s the time that Charlie Fraser and I have hunted the dun deer across\r\nthe heather hills, and now----" He broke into Gaelic lamentation and\r\nimprecation, then fell as suddenly to quiet.\r\n\r\nWe bore up a ravine away from the roads toward where a great gash in the\r\nhills invited us, for we did not need to be told that the chances of\r\nsafety increased with our distance from the beaten tracks of travel. A man\r\non horseback came riding behind and overhauled us rapidly. Presently we\r\nsaw that he was a red-coated officer, and behind a huge rock we waited to\r\npistol him as he came up. The man leaped from his horse and came straight\r\ntoward us. I laid a hand on Captain Roy\'s arm, for I had recognized Major\r\nWolfe. But I was too late. A pistol ball went slapping through the Major\'s\r\nhat and knocked it from his head. He stooped, replaced it with the utmost\r\ncomposure, and continued to advance, at the same time calling out that he\r\nwas a friend.\r\n\r\n"I recognized you behind the birches, Montagu, and thought that you and\r\nyour friend could use another horse. Take my Galloway. You will find him a\r\ngood traveller."\r\n\r\nI ask you to believe that we stared long at him. A wistful smile touched\r\nhis sallow face.\r\n\r\n"We\'re not all ruffians in the English army, lad. If I aid your escape it\r\nis because prisoners have no rights this day. My advice would be for you\r\nto strike for the hills."\r\n\r\n"In troth and I would think your advisings good, sir," answered Donald.\r\n"No glen will be too far, no ben too high, for a hiding-place from these\r\nbloody Sassenach dogs." Then he stopped, the bitterness fading from his\r\nvoice, and added: "But I am forgetting myself. God, sir, the sights I have\r\nseen this day drive me mad. At all events there iss one English officer\r\nCaptain Macdonald will remember whatever." And the Highlander bowed with\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nI thanked Wolfe warmly, and lost no time in taking his advice. Captain\r\nRoy\'s foot had by this time so swollen that he could not put it in the\r\nstirrup. He was suffering a good deal, but at least the pain served to\r\ndistract him from the gloom that lay heavy on his spirits. From the\r\nhillside far above the town we could see the lights of Inverness beginning\r\nto glimmer as we passed. A score of times we had to dismount on account of\r\nthe roughness of the ground to lead our horses along the steep incline of\r\nthe mountainsides, and each time Donald set his teeth and dragged his\r\nshattered ankle through bracken and over boulder by sheer dour pluck.\r\nHunger gnawed at our vitals, for in forty-eight hours we had but tasted\r\nfood. Deadly weariness hung on our stumbling footsteps, and in our gloomy\r\nhearts lurked the coldness of despair. Yet hour after hour we held our\r\nsilent course, clambering like heather-cats over cleugh and boggy\r\nmoorland, till at last we reached Bun Chraobg, where we unsaddled for a\r\nsnatch of sleep.\r\n\r\nWe flung ourselves down on the soft heather wrapped in our plaids, but for\r\nlong slumber was not to be wooed. Our alert minds fell to a review of all\r\nthe horrors of the day: to friends struck down, to the ghastly carnage, to\r\nfugitives hunted and shot in their hiding-places like wild beasts, to the\r\nmistakes that had ruined our already lost cause. The past and the present\r\nwere bitter as we could bear; thank Heaven, the black shadow of the future\r\nhung as yet but dimly on our souls. If we had had the second sight and\r\ncould have known what was to follow--the countryside laid waste with fire\r\nand sword, women and children turned out of their blazing homes to perish\r\non the bleak moors, the wearing of the tartan proscribed and made a crime\r\npunishable with death, a hundred brave Highlanders the victim of the\r\nscaffold--we should have quite despaired.\r\n\r\nExcept the gentle soughing of the wind there was no sound to stir the\r\nsilent night. A million of night\'s candles looked coldly down on an army\r\nof hunted stragglers. I thought of the Prince, Cluny, Lord Murray, Creagh,\r\nand a score of others, wondering if they had been taken, and fell at last\r\nto troubled sleep, from which ever and anon I started to hear the wild\r\nwail of the pibroch or the ringing Highland slogans, to see the flaming\r\ncannon mouths vomiting death or the fell galloping of the relentless\r\nHanoverian dragoons.\r\n\r\nIn the chill dawn I awoke to a ravening hunger that was insistent to be\r\nnoted, and though my eyes would scarce believe there was Donald Roy cocked\r\ntailor fashion on the heath arranging most temptingly on a rock scone\r\nsandwiches of braxy mutton and a flask of usquebaugh (Highland whiskey). I\r\nshut my eyes, rubbed them with my forefingers, and again let in the light.\r\nThe viands were still there.\r\n\r\nThe Macdonald smiled whimsically over at me. "Gin ye hae your appetite wi\'\r\nyou we\'ll eat, Mr. Montagu, for I\'m a wee thingie hungry my nainsell\r\n(myself). \'Deed, to mak plain, I\'m toom (empty) as a drum, and I\'m\r\nthinkin\' that a drappie o\' the usquebaugh wad no\' come amiss neither."\r\n\r\n"But where in the world did you get the food, Donald?"\r\n\r\n"And where wad you think, but doon at the bit clachan yonder? A very guid\r\nfreend of mine named Farquhar Dhu lives there. He and Donald Roy are far\r\nben (intimate), and when I came knocking at his window at cock-craw he was\r\nno\' very laithe to gie me a bit chack (lunch)."\r\n\r\n"Did you climb down the mountain and back with your sore ankle?"\r\n\r\nHe coloured. "Hoots, man! Haud your whitter (tongue)! Aiblins (perhaps) I\r\nwass just wearying for a bit exercise to test it. And gin I were you I\r\nwadna sit cocking on that stane speiring at me upsitten (impertinent)\r\nquestions like a professor of pheelosophy, you muckle sumph!"\r\n\r\nI fell to with a will. He was not a man to be thanked in words. Long since\r\nI had found out that Captain Roy was one to spend himself for his friends\r\nand make nothing of it. This was one of his many shining qualities that\r\ndrew me so strongly to him. If he had a few of the Highland faults he did\r\nnot lack any of the virtues of his race.\r\n\r\nShortly we were on our way once more, and were fortunate enough before\r\nnight to fall in with Cluny and his clan, who having heard of our reverse\r\nhad turned about and were falling back to Badenoch. At Trotternich we\r\nfound a temporary refuge at the home of a surgeon who was distantly\r\nrelated to the Macdonald, but at the end of a fortnight were driven away\r\nby the approach of a troop of Wolfe\'s regiment.\r\n\r\nThe course of our wanderings I think it not needful to detail at length.\r\nFor months we were forever on the move. From one hiding-place to another\r\nthe redcoats and their clan allies drove us. No sooner were we fairly\r\nconcealed than out we were routed. Many a weary hundred miles we tramped\r\nover the bleak mountains white with snow. Weariness walked with us by day,\r\nand cold and hunger lay down with us at night. Occasionally we slept in\r\nsheilings (sheep-huts), but usually in caves or under the open sky. Were\r\nwe in great luck, venison and usquebaugh fell to our portion, but more\r\noften our diet was brose (boiling water poured over oatmeal) washed down\r\nby a draught from the mountain burn. Now we would be lurking on the\r\nmainland, now skulking on one of the islands or crossing rough firths in\r\ncrazy boats that leaked like a sieve. Many a time it was touch and go with\r\nus, for the dragoons and the Campbells followed the trail like sleuths. We\r\nfugitives had a system of signals by which we warned each other of the\r\nenemy\'s approach and conveyed to each other the news. That Balmerino,\r\nKilmarnock, and many another pretty man had been taken we knew, and scores\r\nof us could have guessed shrewdly where the Prince was hiding in the\r\nheather hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE RED HEATHER HILLS\r\n\r\n\r\nA sullen day, full of chill gusts and drizzle, sinking into a wet misty\r\nnight! Three hunted Jacobites, dragging themselves forward drearily, found\r\nthe situation one of utter cheerlessness. For myself, misery spoke in\r\nevery motion, and to say the same of Creagh and Macdonald is to speak by\r\nthe card. Fatigue is not the name for our condition. Fagged out,\r\ndispirited, with legs moving automatically, we still slithered down\r\ncleughs, laboured through dingles and corries, clambered up craggy\r\nmountainsides all slippery with the wet heather, weariness tugging at our\r\nleaden feet like a convict\'s chain and ball. Our bones ached, our throats\r\nwere limekilns, composts of sores were our ragged feet.\r\n\r\nOn every side the redcoats had hemmed us in, and we knew not whether we\r\ntramped to a precarious safety or to death. Indeed, \'twas little we cared,\r\nfor at last exhaustion had touched the limit of endurance. Not a word had\r\npassed the lips of any of us for hours, lest the irritation of our worn\r\nnerves should flame into open rupture.\r\n\r\nAt length we stood on the summit of the ridge. Scarce a half mile from us\r\na shieling was to be seen on the shoulder of the mount.\r\n\r\n"That looks like the cot where O\'Sullivan and the Prince put up a month\r\nago," said Creagh.\r\n\r\nMacdonald ruffled at the name like a turkeycock. Since Culloden the word\r\nhad been to him as a red rag to a bull.\r\n\r\n"The devil take O\'Sullivan and his race," burst out the Scotch Captain.\r\n"Gin it had not been for him the cause had not been lost."\r\n\r\nThe Irishman\'s hot temper flared.\r\n\r\n"You forget the Macdonalds, sir," he retorted, tartly.\r\n\r\n"What ails you at the Macdonalds?" demanded the gentleman of that ilk,\r\nlooking him over haughtily from head to foot.\r\n\r\nCreagh flung out his answer with an insolent laugh. "Culloden."\r\n\r\nThe Macdonald\'s colour ebbed. "It will be a great peety that you hafe\r\ninsulted me, for there will presently be a dead Irishman to stain the snow\r\nwith hiss blood," he said deliberately, falling into more broken English\r\nas he always did when excited.\r\n\r\nCreagh shrugged. "That\'s on the knees of the gods. At the worst it leaves\r\none less for the butcher to hang, Scotch or Irish."\r\n\r\n"It sticks in my mind that I hafe heard you are a pretty man with the\r\nsteel--at the least I am thinking so," said Captain Roy, standing straight\r\nas an arrow, his blue eyes fixed steadily on his opponent.\r\n\r\n"Gadso! Betwixt and between, but I dare say my sword will serve to keep my\r\nhead at all events whatefer," cried Creagh, mimicking scornfully the\r\nother\'s accent.\r\n\r\nDonald whipped his sword from its scabbard.\r\n\r\n"Fery well. That will make easy proving, sir."\r\n\r\nThe quarrel had cropped out so quickly that hitherto I had found no time\r\nto interfere, but now I came between them and beat down the swords.\r\n\r\n"Are you mad, gentlemen? Put up your sword, Tony. Back, Macdonald, or on\r\nmy soul I\'ll run you through," I cried.\r\n\r\n"Come on, the pair of ye. Captain Roy can fend for (look out for)\r\nhimself," shouted the excited Highlander, thrusting at me.\r\n\r\n"Fall back, Tony, and let me have a word," I implored.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman disengaged, his anger nearly gone, a whimsical smile already\r\ntwitching at his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Creagh, you don\'t mean to impeach the courage of Captain Macdonald, do\r\nyou?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Not at all--not at all. Faith, I never saw a man more keen to fight," he\r\nadmitted, smiling.\r\n\r\n"He was wounded at Culloden. You know that?"\r\n\r\n"So I have heard." Then he added dryly, some imp of mischief stirring him:\r\n"In the heel, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in the foot," I told him hastily. "I suppose you do not doubt the\r\nvalour of the Captain\'s clan any more than his own."\r\n\r\n"Devil a bit!" he answered carelessly. "I\'ve seen them fight too often to\r\nadmit of any question as to their courage at all, at all. For sheer daring\r\nI never saw the beat of the Highland troops--especially if there chanced\r\nto be any plunder on the other side of the enemy, Egad!"\r\n\r\nI turned to Donald Roy, who was sullenly waiting for me to have done. "Are\r\nyou satisfied, Captain, that Tony meant to impute nothing against you or\r\nyour men?"\r\n\r\n"Oich! Oich!" he grumbled. "I wass thinking I heard some other dirty\r\nsneers."\r\n\r\n"If the sneers were unjust I retract them with the best will in the world.\r\nCome, Captain Macdonald, sure \'tis not worth our while doing the work of\r\nthe redcoats for them. \'Slife, \'tis not fair to Jack Ketch!" exclaimed the\r\nIrishman.\r\n\r\n"Right, Donald! Why, you fire-eating Hotspur, you began it yourself with a\r\nfling at the Irish. Make up, man! Shake hands with Tony, and be done with\r\nyour bile."\r\n\r\nCreagh offered his hand, smiling, and his smile was a handsome letter of\r\nrecommendation. Donald\'s face cleared, and he gripped heartily the hand of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n"With great pleasure, and gin I said anything offensive I eat my words at\r\nall events," he said.\r\n\r\n"You may say what you please about O\'Sullivan, Captain Macdonald. Ecod, he\r\nmay go to the devil for me," Creagh told him.\r\n\r\n"Well, and for me too; \'fore God, the sooner the better."\r\n\r\n"If there is to be no throat-cutting to warm the blood maybe we had better\r\npush on to the bothy, gentlemen. I\'m fain niddered [perishing] with the\r\ncold. This Highland mist goes to the marrow," I suggested merrily, and\r\nlinking arms with them I moved forward.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes we had a roaring fire ablaze, and were washing down with\r\nusquebaugh the last trace of unkindness. After we had eaten our bannocks\r\nand brose we lay in the shine of the flame and revelled in the blessed\r\nheat, listening to the splash of the rain outside. We were still\r\nencompassed by a cordon of the enemy, but for the present we were content\r\nto make the most of our unusual comfort.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a drammoch left in the flask. I give you the restoration,\r\ngentlemen," cried Donald.\r\n\r\n"I wonder where the Prince is this night," I said after we had drunk the\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\nWe fell to a meditative sombre silence, and presently Captain Roy began to\r\nsing softly one of those touching Jacobite melodies that go to the source\r\nof tears like rain to the roots of flowers. Donald had one of the rare\r\nvoices that carry the heart to laughter and to sobs. The singer\'s song,\r\nall pathos and tenderness, played on the chords of our emotion like a\r\nharp. My eyes began to smart. Creagh muttered something about the\r\npeat-smoke affecting his, and I\'m fain to admit that I rolled over with my\r\nface from the fire to hide the tell-tale tears. The haunting pathetic\r\nwistfulness of the third stanza shook me with sobs.\r\n\r\n                  "On hills that are by right his ain,\r\n                    He roams a lanely stranger;\r\n                  On ilka hand he\'s pressed by want,\r\n                    On ilka hand by danger."\r\n\r\n"Ohon! Ohon!" groaned Donald. "The evil day! The evil day! Wae\'s me for\r\nour bonnie Hieland laddie!"\r\n\r\n"May the Blessed Mother keep him safe from all enemies and dangers!" said\r\nCreagh softly.\r\n\r\n"And God grant that he be warm and well fed this bitter night wherever he\r\nmay be," I murmured.\r\n\r\nSomething heavy like the butt of a musket fell against the door, and we\r\nstarted to our feet in an instant. Out flashed our swords.\r\n\r\n"Who goes?" cried the Macdonald.\r\n\r\nWe threw open the door, and in came a party of four, rain dripping from\r\ntheir soaked plaids. I recognized at once Young Clanranald and Major\r\nMacleod. The other two were a tattered gillie in the Macdonald tartan and\r\na young woman of most engaging appearance, who was supported in the arms\r\nof Clanranald and his henchman. The exhausted lady proved to be no other\r\nthan the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald, whose gallant and generous\r\ndevotion, for a protracted period, as we afterwards learned, had\r\nundoubtedly saved the life of the Prince from his enemies.\r\n\r\nDonald no sooner beheld his kinswoman than he dropped on his knee and with\r\nthe wildest demonstrations of joy kissed the hand of the ragged kerne who\r\nsupported her. I stared at Captain Roy in amazement, and while I was yet\r\nwondering at his strange behaviour Tony Creagh plumped down beside him. My\r\neyes went to the face of the gillie and encountered the winsome smile of\r\nthe Young Chevalier. Desperately white and weary as he was, and dressed in\r\nan outcast\'s rags, he still looked every inch the son of kings. To me he\r\nwas always a more princely figure in his days of adversity, when he roamed\r\na hunted wanderer among Highland heughs and corries with only those about\r\nhim over whose hearts he still was king, than when he ruled at Holyrood\r\nundisputed master of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the party of the Prince, with the exception of\r\nClanranald, were destined for Raasay, could they but run the cordon of\r\ntroopers who guarded the island of Skye. Through Malcolm, arrangements had\r\nbeen made by which Murdoch Macleod, a younger brother wounded at Culloden,\r\nwas to be in waiting with a boat to convey the party of the Prince across\r\nthe sound. It will be believed that we discussed with much care and\r\nanxiety the best disposition to be made of ourselves in running the lines\r\nof the enemy. The final decision was that the Prince, Malcolm, and I\r\nshould make the attempt that night while Creagh, Captain Roy, and Miss\r\nFlora followed at their leisure on the morrow. Since the young lady was\r\nprovided with a passport for herself and her attendant this promised to be\r\na matter of small danger on their part.\r\n\r\nNever have I known a woman treated with truer chivalry and deference than\r\nthis heroic Highland girl was by these hardy mountaineers. Her chief,\r\nClanranald, insisted on building with his own hands a fire in her sleeping\r\nroom "ben" the house, and in every way the highest marks of respect were\r\nshown her for her devotion to the cause. Though he expected to join her\r\nagain shortly, the Prince made her his warmest acknowledgments of thanks\r\nin a spirit of pleasantry which covered much tender feeling. They had been\r\nunder fire together and had shared perils by land and by sea during which\r\ntime his conduct to her had been perfect, a gentle consideration for her\r\ncomfort combined with the reserve that became a gentleman under such\r\ncircumstances. On this occasion he elected to escort her in person to the\r\ndoor of her chamber.\r\n\r\nAfter a snatch of sleep we set out on our perillous journey. Sheets of\r\nrain were now falling in a very black night. Donald Roy parted from us at\r\nthe door of the hut with much anxiety. He had pleaded hard to be allowed\r\nto join the party of the Prince, but had been overruled on the ground that\r\nhe was the only one of us with the exception of Malcolm that could act as\r\na guide. Moreover he was the kinsman of Miss Flora, and therefore her\r\nnatural protector. Over and over he urged us to be careful and to do\r\nnothing rash. The Prince smilingly answered him with a shred of the\r\nGaelic.\r\n\r\n"Bithidh gach ni mar is aill Dhiu." (All things must be as God will have\r\nthem.)\r\n\r\nThe blackness of the night was a thing to be felt. Not the faithful\r\nAchates followed \xc3\x86neas more closely than did we the Macleod. No sound came\r\nto us but the sloshing of the rain out of a sodden sky and the noise of\r\nfalling waters from mountain burns in spate (flood). Hour after hour while\r\nwe played blindly follow-my-leader the clouds were a sieve over our\r\ndevoted heads. Braes we breasted and precipitous heathery heights we\r\nsliddered down, but there was always rain and ever more rain, turning at\r\nlast into a sharp thin sleet that chilled the blood.\r\n\r\nThen in the gray breaking of the day Malcolm turned to confess what I had\r\nalready suspected, that he had lost the way in the darkness. We were at\r\npresent shut in a sea of fog, a smirr of mist and rain, but when that\r\nlifted he could not promise that we would not be close on the campfires of\r\nthe dragoons. His fine face was a picture of misery, and bitterly he\r\nreproached himself for the danger into which he had led the Prince. The\r\nYoung Chevalier told him gently that no blame was attaching to him; rather\r\nto us all for having made the attempt in such a night.\r\n\r\nFor another hour we sat on the dripping heather opposite the corp-white\r\nface of the Macleod waiting for the mist to lift. The wanderer exerted\r\nhimself to keep us in spirits, now whistling a spring of Clanranald\'s\r\nmarch, now retailing to us the story of how he had walked through the\r\nredcoats as Miss Macdonald\'s Betty Burke. It may be conceived with what\r\nanxiety we waited while the cloud of moisture settled from the mountain\r\ntops into the valleys.\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, sir, we have a chance," cried Malcolm suddenly, and began to\r\nlead the way at a great pace up the steep slope. For a half hour we\r\nscudded along, higher and higher, always bearing to the right and at such\r\na burst of speed that I judged we must be in desperate danger. The Prince\r\nhung close to the heels of Malcolm, but I was a sorry laggard ready to die\r\nof exhaustion. When the mist sank we began to go more cautiously, for the\r\nvalley whence we had just emerged was dotted at intervals with the\r\ncampfires of the soldiers. Cautiously we now edged our way along the\r\nslippery incline, keeping in the shadow of great rocks and broom wherever\r\nit was possible. \'Tis not in nature to walk unmoved across an open where\r\nevery bush may hide a sentinel who will let fly at one as gladly as at a\r\nfat buck--yes, and be sure of thirty thousand pounds if he hit the right\r\nmark. I longed for eyes in the back of my head, and every moment could\r\nfeel the lead pinging its way between my shoulder blades.\r\n\r\nMajor Macleod had from his youth stalked the wary stag, and every saugh\r\nand birch and alder in our course was made to yield us its cover. Once a\r\nmuircock whirred from my very feet and brought my heart to my mouth.\r\nPresently we topped the bluff and disappeared over its crest. Another hour\r\nof steady tramping down hill and the blue waters of the sound stretched\r\nbefore us. \'Twas time. My teeth chattered and my bones ached. I was\r\nsick--sick--sick.\r\n\r\n"And here we are at the last," cried the Major with a deep breath of\r\nrelief. "I played the gomeral brawly, but in the darkness we blundered\r\nram-stam through the Sassenach lines."\r\n\r\n"\'Fortuna favet fatuis,\'" quoted the Young Chevalier. "Luck for fools! The\r\nusurper\'s dragoons will have to wait another day for their thirty thousand\r\npounds. Eh, Montagu?" he asked me blithely; then stopped to stare at me\r\nstaggering down the beach. "What ails you, man?"\r\n\r\nI was reeling blindly like a drunkard, and our Prince put an arm around my\r\nwaist. I resisted feebly, but he would have none of it; the arm of a\r\nking\'s son (de jure) supported me to the boat.\r\n\r\nWe found as boatmen not only Murdoch Macleod but his older brother Young\r\nRaasay, the only one of the family that had not been "out" with our army.\r\nHe had been kept away from the rebellion to save the family estates, but\r\nhis heart was none the less with us.\r\n\r\n"And what folly is this, Ronald?" cried Malcolm when he saw the head of\r\nthe house on the links. "Murdoch and I are already as black as we can be,\r\nbut you were to keep clean of the Prince\'s affairs. It wad be a geyan ill\r\noutcome gin we lost the estates after all. The red cock will aiblins craw\r\nat Raasay for this."\r\n\r\n"I wass threepin\' so already, but he wass dooms thrang to come. He\'ll\r\nmaybe get his craig raxed (neck twisted) for his ploy," said Murdoch\r\ncomposedly.\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, Malcolm, I\'ll play the trimmer no longer. Raasay serves his\r\nPrince though it cost both the estate and his head," cried the young\r\nchieftain hotly.\r\n\r\n"In God\'s name then let us get away before the militia or the sidier roy\r\n(red soldiers) fall in with us. In the woody cleughs yonder they are thick\r\nas blackcocks in August," cried the Major impatiently.\r\n\r\nWe pushed into the swirling waters and were presently running free,\r\nsending the spurling spray flying on both sides of the boat. The wind came\r\non to blow pretty hard and the leaky boat began to fill, so that we were\r\nhard put to it to keep from sinking. The three brothers were quite used to\r\nmaking the trip in foul weather, but on the Prince\'s account were now much\r\ndistressed. To show his contempt for danger, the royal wanderer sang a\r\nlively Erse song. The Macleods landed us at Glam, and led the way to a\r\nwretched hovel recently erected by some shepherds. Here we dined on\r\nbroiled kid, butter, cream, and oaten bread.\r\n\r\nI slept round the clock, and awoke once more a sound man to see the Prince\r\nroasting the heart of the kid on an iron spit. Throughout the day we\r\nplayed with a greasy pack of cards to pass the time. About sundown Creagh\r\njoined us, Macdonald having stayed on Skye to keep watch on any suspicious\r\nactivity of the clan militia or the dragoons. Raasay\'s clansmen,\r\nostensibly engaged in fishing, dotted the shore of the little island to\r\ngive warning of the approach of any boats. To make our leader\'s safety\r\nmore certain, the two proscribed brothers took turns with Creagh and me in\r\ndoing sentinel duty at the end of the path leading to the sheep hut.\r\n\r\nAt the desire of the Prince--and how much more at mine!--we ventured up to\r\nthe great house that night to meet the ladies, extraordinary precautions\r\nhaving been taken by Raasay to prevent the possibility of any surprise.\r\nIndeed, so long as the Prince was in their care, Raasay and his brothers\r\nwere as anxious as the proverbial hen with the one chick. Doubtless they\r\nfelt that should he be captured while on the island the reputation of the\r\nhouse would be forever blasted. And this is the most remarkable fact of\r\nCharles Edward Stuart\'s romantic history; that in all the months of his\r\nwandering, reposing confidence as he was forced to do in hundreds of\r\ndifferent persons, many of them mere gillies and some of them little\r\nbetter than freebooters, it never seems to have occurred to one of these\r\nshag-headed Gaels to earn an immense fortune by giving him up.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat a tattoo against my ribs as I followed the Prince and Raasay\r\nto the drawing-room where his sister and Miss Macdonald awaited us. Eight\r\nmonths had passed since last I had seen my love; eight months of battle,\r\nof hairbreadth escapes, and of hardships scarce to be conceived. She too\r\nhad endured much in that time. Scarce a house in Raasay but had been razed\r\nby the enemy because her brothers and their following had been "out" with\r\nus. I was to discover whether her liking for me had outlived the turmoils\r\nof "the \'45," or had been but a girlish fancy.\r\n\r\nMy glance flashed past Miss Flora Macdonald and found Aileen on the\r\ninstant. For a hundredth part of a second our eyes met before she fell to\r\nmaking her devoirs to the Young Chevalier, and after that I did not need\r\nto be told that my little friend was still staunch and leal. I could\r\nafford to wait my turn with composure, content to watch with long-starved\r\neyes the delicacy and beauty of this sweet wild rose I coveted. Sure, hers\r\nwas a charm that custom staled not nor longer acquaintance made less\r\nalluring. Every mood had its own characteristic fascination, and are not\r\nthe humours of a woman numberless? She had always a charming note of\r\nunconventional freshness, a childlike _naivet\xc3\xa9_ of immaturity and\r\nunsophistication at times, even a certain girlish shy austerity that had\r\nfor me a touch of saintliness. But there-- Why expatiate? A lover\'s\r\nmidsummer madness, you will say!\r\n\r\nMy turn at last! The little brown hand pressed mine firmly for an instant,\r\nthe warm blue eyes met mine full and true, the pulse in the soft-throated\r\nneck beat to a recognition of my presence. I found time to again admire\r\nthe light poise of the little head carried with such fine spirit, the\r\nmusic of the broken English speech in this vibrant Highland voice.\r\n\r\n"Welcome-- Welcome to Raasay, my friend!" Then her eyes falling on the\r\nsatin cockade so faded and so torn, there came a tremulous little catch to\r\nher voice, a fine light to her eyes. "It iss the good tale that my\r\nbrothers have been telling me of Kenneth Montagu\'s brave devotion to hiss\r\nfriends, but I wass not needing to hear the story from them. I will be\r\nthinking that I knew it all already," she said, a little timidly.\r\n\r\nI bowed low over her hand and kissed it. "My friends make much of nothing.\r\nTheir fine courage reads their own spirit reflected in the eyes of\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then I will have heard the story wrong. It would be Donald who went\r\nback to Drummossie Moor after you when you were wounded?"\r\n\r\n"Could a friend do less?"\r\n\r\n"Or more?"\r\n\r\n"He would have done as much for me. My plain duty!" I said, shrugging,\r\nanxious to be done with the subject.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with sparkling eyes, laughing at my discomposure, in a\r\nhalf impatience of my stolid English phlegm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you men! You go to your death for a friend, and if by a miracle you\r\nescape: \'Pooh! \'Twas nothing whatever. Gin it rain to-morrow, I think\r\n\'twill be foul,\' you say, and expect to turn it off so."\r\n\r\nI took the opening like a fox.\r\n\r\n"Faith, I hope it will not rain to-morrow," I said. "I have to keep watch\r\noutside. Does the sun never shine in Raasay, Aileen?"\r\n\r\n"Whiles," she answered, laughing. "And are all Englishmen so shy of their\r\nvirtues?"\r\n\r\nTony Creagh coming up at that moment, she referred the question to him.\r\n\r\n"Sure, I can\'t say," he answered unsmilingly. "\'Fraid I\'m out of court.\r\nNever knew an Englishman to have any."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you spare them one at the least?" Aileen implored, gaily.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, then at me, a twinkle in his merry Irish eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ecod then, I concede them one! They\'re good sportsmen. They follow the\r\ngame until they\'ve bagged it."\r\n\r\nWe two flushed in concert, but the point of her wit touched Creagh on the\r\n_riposte_.\r\n\r\n"The men of the nation being disposed of in such cavalier fashion, what\r\nshall we say of the ladies, sir?" she asked demurely.\r\n\r\n"That they are second only to the incomparable maidens of the North," he\r\nanswered, kissing her hand in his extravagant Celtic way.\r\n\r\n"But I will not be fubbed off with your Irish blarney. The English ladies,\r\nMr. Creagh?" she merrily demanded.\r\n\r\n"Come, Tony, you renegade! Have I not heard you toast a score of times the\r\nbeauties of London?" said I, coming up with the heavy artillery.\r\n\r\n"Never, I vow. Sure I always thought Edinburgh a finer city--not so dirty\r\nand, pink me, a vast deal more interesting. Now London is built----"\r\n\r\n"On the Thames. So it is," I interrupted dryly. "And--to get back to the\r\nsubject under discussion--the pink and white beauties of London are built\r\nto take the eye and ensnare the heart of roving Irishmen. Confess!"\r\n\r\n"Or be forever shamed as recreant knight," cried Aileen, her blue eyes\r\nbubbling with laughter.\r\n\r\nTony unbuckled his sword and offered it her. "If I yield \'tis not to\r\nnumbers but to beauty. Is my confession to be in the general or the\r\nparticular, Miss Macleod?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, in the particular! \'Twill be the mair interesting."\r\n\r\n"Faith then, though it be high treason to say so of one lady before\r\nanother, Tony Creagh\'s scalp dangles at the belt of the most bewitching\r\nlittle charmer in Christendom."\r\n\r\n"Her name?"\r\n\r\n"Mistress Antoinette Westerleigh, London\'s reigning toast."\r\n\r\nAileen clapped her hands in approving glee.\r\n\r\n"And did you ever tell her?"\r\n\r\n"A score of times. Faith, \'twas my rule to propose every second time I saw\r\nher and once in between."\r\n\r\n"And she----?"\r\n\r\n"Laughed at me; played shill-I-shall-I with my devotion; vowed she would\r\nnot marry me till I had been killed in the wars to prove I was a hero;\r\nsmiled on me one minute and scorned me the next."\r\n\r\n"And you love her still?"\r\n\r\n"The sun rises in \'Toinette\'s eyes; when she frowns the day is vile."\r\n\r\n"Despite her whims and arrogances?"\r\n\r\n"Sure for me my queen can do no wrong. \'Tis her right to laugh and mock at\r\nme so only she enjoy it."\r\n\r\nAileen stole one shy, quick, furtive look at me. It seemed to question\r\nwhether her lover was such a pattern of meek obedience.\r\n\r\n"And you never falter? There iss no other woman for you?"\r\n\r\n"Saving your presence, there is no other woman in the world?"\r\n\r\nHer eyes glistened.\r\n\r\n"Kneel down, sir," she commanded.\r\n\r\nTony dropped to a knee. She touched him lightly on the shoulder with his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n"In love\'s name I dub you worthy knight. Be bold, be loyal, be fortunate.\r\nArise, Sir Anthony Creagh, knight of the order of Cupid!"\r\n\r\nWe three had wandered away together into an alcove, else, \'tis almost\r\nneedless to say, our daffing had not been so free. Now Malcolm joined us\r\nwith a paper in his hand. He spoke to me, smiling yet troubled too.\r\n\r\n"More labours, O my Theseus! More Minotaurs to slay! More labyrinths to\r\nthread!"\r\n\r\n"And what may be these labours now?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Captain Donald Roy sends for you. He reports unusual activity among the\r\nclan militia and the redcoats on Skye. A brig landed men and officers\r\nthere yesterday. And what for will they be coming?"\r\n\r\n"I think the reason is very plain, Major Macleod," said Tony blithely.\r\n\r\n"I\'m jalousing (suspecting) so mysel\'. They will be for the taking of a\r\nwheen puir callants (lads) that are jinking (hiding) in the hill birken\r\n(scrub). But here iss the point that must be learned: do they ken that the\r\nPrince iss on the islands?"\r\n\r\nCreagh sprang to his feet from the chair in which he had been lazying.\r\n"The devil\'s in it! Why should Montagu go? Why not I?"\r\n\r\n"Because you can\'t talk the Gaelic, Creagh. You\'re barred," I told him\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Would you be sending our guest on such an errand of danger, Malcolm?"\r\nasked Aileen in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Not I, but Fegs! I will never say the word to hinder if he volunteers.\r\n\'Tis in the service of the Prince. The rest of us are kent (known) men and\r\ncanna gang."\r\n\r\nGrouped behind Malcolm were now gathered the Prince, Raasay, and Miss\r\nFlora. To me as a focus came all eyes. I got to my feet in merry humour.\r\n\r\n"Ma foi! Ulysses as a wanderer is not to be compared with me. When do I\r\nset out, Major?"\r\n\r\n"At skreigh-o\'-day (daybreak). And the sooner you seek your sleep the\r\nbetter. Best say good-night to the lassies, for you\'ll need be wide awake\r\nthe morn twa-three hours ere sun-up. Don\'t let the redcoats wile (lure)\r\nyou into any of their traps, lad. You maunna lose your head or----"\r\n\r\n"----Or I\'ll lose my head," I answered, drolling. "I take you, Major; but,\r\nmy word for it, I have not, played hide-and-go-seek six months among your\r\nHighland lochs and bens to dance on air at the last."\r\n\r\nThe Prince drew me aside. "This will not be forgotten when our day of\r\npower comes, Montagu. I expected no less of your father\'s son." Then he\r\nadded with a smile: "And when Ulysses rests safe from his wanderings at\r\nlast I trust he will find his Penelope waiting for him with a true\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nWithout more ado I bade Miss Macdonald and Aileen good-bye, but as I left\r\nthe room I cast a last look back over my shoulder and methought that the\r\nlissome figure of my love yearned forward toward me tenderly and\r\ngraciously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nVOLNEY PAYS A DEBT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some to whom strange changes never come. They pursue the even\r\ntenor of their way in humdrum monotony, content to tread the broad safe\r\npath of routine. For them the fascination of the mountain peaks of giddy\r\nchance has no allurement, the swift turbulent waters of intrigue no charm.\r\nThere are others with whom Dame Fortune plays many an exciting game, and\r\nto these adventure becomes as the very breath of life. To such every\r\nhazard of new fortune is a diversion to be eagerly sought.\r\n\r\nSomething of this elation seized me--for I am of this latter class--as\r\nMurdoch and his gillies rowed me across the sound to Skye in the darkness\r\nof the early morning. It was a drab dawn as ever I have seen, and every\r\ntug at the oars shot me nearer to the red bloodhounds who were debouched\r\nover the island. What then? Was I not two years and twenty, and did I not\r\nventure for the life of a king\'s son? To-day I staked my head on luck and\r\nskill; to-morrow--but let the future care for her own.\r\n\r\nIn a grove of beeches about half a mile from Portree we landed, and\r\nMurdoch gave the call of the whaup to signal Donald Roy. From a clump of\r\nwhins in the gorse the whistle echoed back to us, and presently Captain\r\nMacdonald came swinging down to the shore. It appeared that another\r\nboatload of soldiers had been landed during the night, a squad of clan\r\nmilitia under the command of a Lieutenant Campbell. We could but guess\r\nthat this portended some knowledge as to the general whereabouts of the\r\nPrince, and \'twas my mission to learn the extent and reliability of that\r\nknowledge if I could. That there was some danger in the attempt I knew,\r\nbut it had been minimized by the philibeg and hose, the Glengarry bonnet\r\nand Macleod plaid which I had donned at the instance of Malcolm.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of chance. The first stroke of it fell as I strode along the\r\nhighway to Portree. At a crossroad intersection I chanced on a fellow\r\ntrudging the same way as myself. He was one of your furtive-faced fellows,\r\nwith narrow slits of eyes and an acquired habit of skellying sidewise at\r\none out of them. Cunning he was beyond doubt, and from the dour look of\r\nhim one to bear malice. His trews were like Joseph\'s coat for the colour\r\nof the many patches, but I made them out to have been originally of the\r\nCampbell plaid.\r\n\r\n"A fine day, my man," says I with vast irony.\r\n\r\n"Wha\'s finding faut wi\' the day?" he answers glumly.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be from across the mountains on the mainland by the tongue of\r\nyou," I ventured.\r\n\r\n"Gin you ken that there\'ll be nae use telling you."\r\n\r\n"A Campbell, I take it."\r\n\r\nHe turned his black-a-vised face on me, scowling.\r\n\r\n"Or perhaps you\'re on the other side of the hedge--implicated in this\r\nbarelegged rebellion, I dare say."\r\n\r\nUnder my smiling, watchful eye he began to grow restless. His hand crept\r\nto his breast, and I heard the crackle of papers.\r\n\r\n"Deil hae\'t, what\'s it to you?" he growled.\r\n\r\n"To me? Oh, nothing at all. Merely a friendly interest. On the whole I\r\nthink my first guess right. I wouldn\'t wonder but you\'re carrying\r\ndispatches from Lieutenant Campbell."\r\n\r\nThe fellow went all colours and was as easy as a worm on a hook.\r\n\r\n"I make no doubt you\'ll be geyan tired from long travel, and the\r\nresponsibility of carrying such important documents must weigh down your\r\nspirits," I drolled, "and so I will trouble you"--with a pistol clapped to\r\nhis head and a sudden ring of command in my voice--"to hand them over to\r\nme at once."\r\n\r\nThe fellow\'s jaw dropped lankly. He looked hither and thither for a way of\r\nescape and found none. He was confronting an argument that had a great\r\ndeal of weight with him, and out of the lining of his bonnet he ripped a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, but I\'ll take the one in your breast pocket," I told him dryly.\r\n\r\nOut it came with a deal of pother. The letter was addressed to the Duke of\r\nCumberland, Portree, Skye. My lips framed themselves to a long whistle.\r\nHere was the devil to pay. If the butcher was on the island I knew he had\r\ncome after bigger game than muircocks. No less a quarry than the Prince\r\nhimself would tempt him to this remote region. I marched my prisoner back\r\nto Captain Roy and Murdoch. To Donald I handed the letter, and he ripped\r\nit open without ceremony. \'Twas merely a note from the Campbell Lieutenant\r\nof militia, to say that the orders of his Highness regarding the watching\r\nof the coast would be fulfilled to the least detail.\r\n\r\n"Well, and here\'s a pirn to unravel. What\'s to be done now?" asked the\r\nMacdonald.\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, I have it," cried I. "Let Murdoch carry the news to Raasay\r\nthat the Prince may get away at once. Do you guard our prisoner here,\r\nwhile I, dressed in his trews and bonnet, carry the letter to the Duke.\r\nHis answer may throw more light on the matter."\r\n\r\nNot to make long, so it was decided. We made fashion to plaster up the\r\nenvelope so as not to show a casual looker that it had been tampered with,\r\nand I footed it to Portree in the patched trews of the messenger, not with\r\nthe lightest heart in the world. The first redcoat I met directed me to\r\nthe inn where the Duke had his headquarters, and I was presently admitted\r\nto a hearing.\r\n\r\nThe Duke was a ton of a little man with the phlegmatic Dutch face. He read\r\nthe letter stolidly and began to ask questions as to the disposition of\r\nour squad. I lied generously, magnificently, my face every whit as wooden\r\nas his; and while I was still at it the door behind me opened and a man\r\ncame in leisurely. He waited for the Duke to have done with me, softly\r\nhumming a tune the while, his shadow flung in front across my track; and\r\nwhile he lilted there came to me a dreadful certainty that on occasion I\r\nhad heard the singer and his song before.\r\n\r\n                  "\'Then come kiss me sweet and twenty.\r\n                  Youth\'s a stuff will not endure,\'"\r\n\r\ncarolled the melodious voice lazily. Need I say that it belonged to my\r\numquhile friend Sir Robert Volney.\r\n\r\nCumberland brushed me aside with a wave of his hand.\r\n\r\n"Donner! If the Pretender is on Skye--and he must be--we\'ve got him\r\ntrapped, Volney. Our cordon stretches clear across the isle, and every\r\noutlet is guarded," he cried.\r\n\r\n"Immensely glad to hear it, sir. Let\'s see! Is this the twelfth time\r\nyou\'ve had him sure? \'Pon honour, he must have more lives than the\r\nproverbial cat," drawled Sir Robert insolently.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing about Volney I could never enough admire. He was no\r\nrespecter of persons. Come high, come low, the bite of his ironic tongue\r\nstruck home. For a courtier he had the laziest scorn of those he courted\r\nthat ever adventurer was hampered with; and strangely enough from him his\r\nfriends in high place tolerated anything. The Prince of Wales and his\r\nbrother Cumberland would not speak to each other, yet each of them fought\r\nto retain Volney as his follower. Time-servers wondered that his uncurbed\r\nspeech never brought him to grief. Perhaps the secret of his security lay\r\nin his splendid careless daring; in that, and in his winning personality.\r\n\r\n"By God, Volney, sometimes I think you\'re half a Jacobite," said\r\nCumberland, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Your Grace does me injustice. My bread is buttered on the Brunswick\r\nside," answered the baronet, carelessly.\r\n\r\n"But otherwise--at heart----"\r\n\r\nVolney\'s sardonic smile came into play. "Otherwise my well-known caution,\r\nand my approved loyalty,--Egad, I had almost forgotten that!--refute such\r\nan aspersion."\r\n\r\n"Himmel! If your loyalty is no greater than your caution it may be counted\r\nout. At the least you take delight in tormenting me. Never deny it, man! I\r\nbelieve you want the Pretender to get away."\r\n\r\n"One may wish the Prince----"\r\n\r\n"The Prince?" echoed Cumberland, blackly.\r\n\r\n"The Young Chevalier then, if you like that better. \'Slife, what\'s in a\r\nname? One may wish him to escape and be guilty of no crime. He and his\r\nbrave Highlanders deserve a better fate than death. I dare swear that half\r\nyour redcoats have the sneaking desire to see the young man win free out\r\nof the country. Come, my good fellow"--turning to me--"What do they call\r\nyou--Campbell? Well then, Campbell, speak truth and shame the devil. Are\r\nyou as keen to have the Young Chevalier taken as you pretend?"\r\n\r\nDoggedly I turned my averted head toward him, saw the recognition leap to\r\nhis eyes, and waited for the word to fall from his lips that would condemn\r\nme. Amusement chased amazement across his face.\r\n\r\nA moment passed, still another moment. The word was not spoken. Instead he\r\nbegan to smile, presently to hum,\r\n\r\n              "\'You\'ll on an\' you\'ll march to Carlisle ha\'\r\n              To be hanged and quartered, an\' a\', an\' a\'.\'\r\n\r\n"Come, Mont-Campbell, you haven\'t answered my question yet. If you knew\r\nwhere Charles Edward Stuart was in hiding would you give him up?" He\r\nlooked at me from under lowered lids, vastly entertained, playing with me\r\nas a cat does with a mouse.\r\n\r\n"I am a fery good servant of the King, God bless him whatefer, and I would\r\njust do my duty," answered I, still keeping the r\xc3\xb4le I had assumed.\r\n\r\n"Of course he would. Ach, liebe himmel! Any loyal man would be bound to do\r\nso," broke in Cumberland.\r\n\r\nVolney\'s eyes shone. "I\'m not so sure," said he. "Now supposing, sir, that\r\none had a very dear friend among the rebels; given the chance, ought he to\r\nturn him over to justice?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt about it. Friendship ends when rebellion begins," said the Duke,\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\nSir Robert continued blandly to argue the case, looking at me out of the\r\ntail of his eye. Faith, he enjoyed himself prodigiously, which was more\r\nthan I did, for I was tasting a bad quarter of an hour. "Put it this way,\r\nsir: I have a friend who has done me many good turns. Now assume that I\r\nhave but to speak the word to send him to his death. Should the word be\r\nspoken?"\r\n\r\nThe Duke said dogmatically that a soldier\'s first duty was to work for the\r\nsuccess of his cause regardless of private feelings.\r\n\r\n"Or turn it this way," continued Volney, "that the man is not a friend.\r\nSuppose him a rival claimant to an estate I mean to possess. Can I in\r\nhonour give him up? What would you think, Mont--er--Campbell?"\r\n\r\n"Not Mont-Campbell, but Campbell," I corrected. "I will be thinking, sir,\r\nthat it would be a matter for your conscience, and at all events it iss\r\nfery lucky that you do not hafe to decide it."\r\n\r\n"Still the case might arise. It\'s always well to be prepared," he\r\nanswered, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Robert! What the deuce do you mean by discussing such a matter\r\nwith a Highland kerne? I never saw your match for oddity," said the Duke.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still speaking there was a commotion in the outer room of the\r\ninn. There sounded a rap at the door, and on the echo of the knock an\r\nofficer came into the room to announce the capture of a suspect. He was\r\nfollowed by the last man in the world I wanted to see at that moment, no\r\nother than the Campbell soldier whose place I was usurping. The fat was in\r\nthe fire with a vengeance now, and though I fell back to the rear I knew\r\nit was but a question of time till his eye lit on me.\r\n\r\nThe fellow began to tell his story, got nearly through before his ferret\r\neyes circled round to me, then broke off to burst into a screed of the\r\nGaelic as he pointed a long finger at me.\r\n\r\nThe Duke flung round on me in a cold fury. "Is this true, fellow?"\r\n\r\nI came forward shrugging.\r\n\r\n"To deny were folly when the evidence is writ so plain," I said.\r\n\r\n"And who the devil are you?"\r\n\r\n"Kenneth Montagu, at your service."\r\n\r\nCumberland ordered the room cleared, then turned on Volney a very grim\r\nface. "I\'ll remember this, Sir Robert. You knew him all the time. It has a\r\nbad look, I make plain to say."\r\n\r\n"\'Twas none of my business. Your troopers can find enough victims for you\r\nwithout my pointing out any. I take the liberty of reminding your Highness\r\nthat I\'m not a hangman by profession," returned Volney stiffly.\r\n\r\n"You go too far, sir," answered the Duke haughtily. "I know my duty too\r\nwell to allow me to be deterred from performing it by you or by anybody\r\nelse. Mr. Montagu, have you any reason to give why I should not hang you\r\nfor a spy?"\r\n\r\n"No reason that would have any weight with your Grace," I answered.\r\n\r\nHe looked long at me, frowning blackly out of the grimmest face I had ever\r\nfronted; and yet that countenance, inexorable as fate, belonged to a young\r\nman not four years past his majority.\r\n\r\n"Without dubiety you deserve death," he said at the last, "but because of\r\nyour youth I give you one chance. Disclose to me the hiding-place of the\r\nPretender and you shall come alive out of the valley of the shadow."\r\n\r\nA foretaste of the end clutched icily at my heart, but the price of the\r\nproffered safety was too great. Since I must die, I resolved that it\r\nshould be with a good grace.\r\n\r\n"I do not know whom your Grace can mean by the Pretender."\r\n\r\nHis heavy jaw set and his face grew cold and hard as steel.\r\n\r\n"You fool, do you think to bandy words with me? You will speak or by\r\nheaven you will die the death of a traitor."\r\n\r\n"I need not fear to follow where so many of my brave comrades have shown\r\nthe way," I answered steadily.\r\n\r\n"Bah! You deal in heroics. Believe me, this is no time for theatricals.\r\nOut with it. When did you last see Charles Stuart?"\r\n\r\n"I can find no honourable answer to that question, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then your blood be on your own head, fool. You die to-morrow morning by\r\nthe cord."\r\n\r\n"As God wills; perhaps to-morrow, perhaps not for fifty years."\r\n\r\nWhile I was being led out another prisoner passed in on his way to\r\njudgment. The man was Captain Roy Macdonald.\r\n\r\n"I\'m wae to see you here, lad, and me the cause of it by sending you," he\r\nsaid, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\n"How came they to take you?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"I was surprised on the beach just after Murdoch left," he told me in the\r\nGaelic so that the English troopers might not understand. "All should be\r\nwell with the yellow haired laddie now that the warning has been given.\r\nAre you for Carlisle, Kenneth?"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. "No, my time is set for to-morrow. If they give you\r\nlonger you\'ll find a way to send word to Aileen how it went with me,\r\nDonald?"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and we gripped hands in silence, our eyes meeting steadily.\r\nFrom his serene courage I gathered strength.\r\n\r\nThey took me to a bothy in the village which had been set apart as a\r\nprison for me, and here, a picket of soldiers with loaded muskets\r\nsurrounding the hut, they left me to myself. I had asked for paper and\r\nink, but my request had been refused.\r\n\r\nIn books I have read how men under such circumstance came quietly to\r\nphilosophic and religious contemplation, looking at the issue with the\r\nfar-seeing eyes of those who count death but an incident. But for me, I am\r\nneither philosopher nor saint. Connected thought I found impossible. My\r\nmind was alive with fleeting and chaotic fragmentary impulses. Memories\r\nconnected with Cloe, Charles, Balmerino, and a hundred others occupied me.\r\nTrivial forgotten happenings flashed through my brain. All the different\r\nAileens that I knew trooped past in procession. Gay and sad, wistful and\r\nmerry, eager and reflective, in passion and in tender guise, I saw my love\r\nin all her moods; and melted always at the vision of her.\r\n\r\nI descended to self-pity, conceiving myself a hero and a martyr, revelling\r\nin an agony of mawkish sentiment concerning the post-mortem grief of my\r\nfriends. From this at length I snatched myself by calling to mind the many\r\nsimple Highlanders who had preceded me in the past months without any\r\nmorbid craving for applause. Back harked my mind to Aileen, imagination\r\nspanning the future as well as the past. Tender pity and love suffused me.\r\nMingled with all my broken reflections was many a cry of the heart for\r\nmercy to a sinner about to render his last account and for healing balm to\r\nthat dear friend who would be left to mourn the memory of me painted in\r\nradiant colours.\r\n\r\nParadoxical though it may seem, the leaden hours flew on feathered foot.\r\nDusk fell, then shortly darkness. Night deepened, and the stars came out.\r\nFrom the window I watched the moon rise till it flooded the room with its\r\npale light, my mind at last fallen into the sombre quiet of deep\r\nabstraction.\r\n\r\nA mocking voice brought me to earth with a start.\r\n\r\n"Romantic spectacle! A world bathed in moonlight. Do you compose verses to\r\nyour love\'s bright eyes, Mr. Montagu? Or perhaps an epitaph for some close\r\nfriend?"\r\n\r\nAn elegant figure in dark cloak, riding boots, and three-cornered hat\r\nconfronted me, when I slowly turned.\r\n\r\n"Hope I don\'t intrude," he said jauntily.\r\n\r\nI gave him a plain hint. "Sir Robert, like Lord Chesterfield, when he was\r\nso ill last year, if I do not press you to remain it is because I must\r\nrehearse my funeral obsequies."\r\n\r\nHis laugh rang merrily. Coming forward a step or two, he flung a leg\r\nacross the back of a chair.\r\n\r\n"Egad, you\'re not very hospitable, my friend. Or isn\'t this your evening\r\nat home?" he fleered.\r\n\r\nI watched him narrowly, answering nothing.\r\n\r\n"Cozy quarters," he said, looking round with polite interest. "May I ask\r\nwhether you have taken them for long?"\r\n\r\n"The object of your visit, sir," I demanded coldly.\r\n\r\n"There you gravel me," he laughed. "I wish I knew the motives for my\r\nvisit. They are perhaps a blend--some pique, some spite, some curiosity,\r\nand faith! a little admiration, Mr. Montagu."\r\n\r\n"All of which being presumably now satisfied----"\r\n\r\n"But they\'re not, man! Far from it. And so I accept the courteous\r\ninvitation you were about to extend me to prolong my call and join you in\r\na glass of wine."\r\n\r\nSeeing that he was determined to remain willy-nilly, I made the best of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"You have interpreted my sentiments exactly, Sir Robert," I told him. "But\r\nI fear the wine will have to be postponed till another meeting. My cellar\r\nis not well stocked."\r\n\r\nHe drew a flask from his pocket, found glasses on the table, and filled\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Then let me thus far play host, Mr. Montagu. Come, I give you a toast!"\r\nHe held the glass to the light and viewed the wine critically. "\'T is a\r\ndevilish good vintage, though I say it myself. Montagu, may you always\r\nfind a safe port in time of storm!" he said with jesting face, but with a\r\ncertain undercurrent of meaning that began to set my blood pounding.\r\n\r\nBut though I took a glimmer of the man\'s purpose I would not meet him\r\nhalf-way. If he had any proposal to make the advances must come from him.\r\nNor would I allow myself to hope too much.\r\n\r\n"I\' faith, \'tis a good port," I said, and eyed the wine no less judicially\r\nthan he.\r\n\r\nVolney\'s gaze loitered deliberately over the cottage furnishings. "Cozy\r\nenough, but after all not quite to my liking, if I may make so bold as to\r\ncriticise your apartments. I wonder now you don\'t make a change."\r\n\r\n"I\'m thinking of moving to-morrow," I told him composedly. "To a less\r\nroomy apartment, but one just as snug."\r\n\r\n"Shall you live there permanently?" he asked with innocent face.\r\n\r\n"I shall stay there permanently," I corrected.\r\n\r\nDespite my apparent unconcern I was playing desperately for my life. That\r\nVolney was dallying with some plan of escape for me I became more\r\nconfident, and I knew from experience that nothing would touch the man on\r\nhis weak side so surely as an imperturbable manner.\r\n\r\n"I mentioned pique and spite, Mr. Montagu, and you did not take my\r\nmeaning. Believe me, not against you, but against that oaf Cumberland," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"And what may your presence here have to do with your pique against the\r\nDuke? I confess that the connection is not plain to me," I said in\r\ncareless fashion.\r\n\r\n"After you left to-day, Mr. Montagu, I humbled myself to ask a favour of\r\nthe Dutchman--the first I ever asked, and I have done him many. He refused\r\nit and turned his back on me."\r\n\r\n"The favour was----?"\r\n\r\n"That you might be taken to London for trial and executed there."\r\n\r\nI looked up as if surprised. "And why this interest on my behalf, Sir\r\nRobert?"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. "I do not know--a fancy--a whim. George Selwyn would never\r\nforgive me if I let you be hanged and he not there to see."\r\n\r\n"Had you succeeded Selwyn would have had you to thank for a pleasant\r\ndiversion, but I think you remarked that the Dutchman was obstinate. \'Tis\r\na pity--for Selwyn\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"Besides, I had another reason. You and I had set ourselves to play out a\r\ncertain game in which I took an interest. Now I do not allow any\r\nblundering foreigners to interfere with my amusements."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean you do not like the foreigner to anticipate you."\r\n\r\n"By God, I do not allow him to when I can prevent it."\r\n\r\n"But as in this instance you cannot prevent it----" My sentence tailed\r\ninto a yawn.\r\n\r\n"That remains to be seen," he retorted, and whipped off first one boot and\r\nthen the other. The unfastened cloak fell to the floor, and he began to\r\nunloose his doublet.\r\n\r\nI stared calmly, though my heart stood still.\r\n\r\n"Really, Sir Robert! Are you going to stay all night? I fear my\r\naccommodations are more limited than those to which you have been\r\naccustomed."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stand gaping there, Montagu. Get off those uncivilized rags of\r\nyours and slip on these. You\'re going out as Sir Robert Volney."\r\n\r\n"I am desolated to interfere with your revenge, but--the guards?"\r\n\r\n"Fuddled with drink," he said. "I took care of that. Don\'t waste time\r\nasking questions."\r\n\r\n"The Duke will be in a fearful rage with you."\r\n\r\nHis eyes grew hard. "Am I a child that I should tremble when Cumberland\r\nfrowns?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll make you pay for this."\r\n\r\n"A fig for the payment!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll lose favour."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll teach the sullen beast to refuse me one. The boots next."\r\n\r\nHe put on the wig and hat for me, arranged the muffler over the lower part\r\nof my face, and fastened the cloak.\r\n\r\n"The watchword for the night is \'Culloden.\' You should have no trouble in\r\npassing. I needn\'t tell you to be bold," he finished dryly.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not forget this," I told him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s as you please," he answered carelessly. "I ask no gratitude. I\'m\r\nsettling a debt, or rather two--one due Cumberland and the other you."\r\n\r\n"Still, I\'ll remember."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right. Hope we\'ll have the pleasure of renewing our little game\r\nsome day. Better take to the hills or the water. You\'ll find the roads\r\nstrictly guarded. Don\'t let yourself get killed, my friend. The pleasure\r\nof running you through I reserve for myself."\r\n\r\nI passed out of the hut into the night. The troopers who guarded the bothy\r\nwere in either the stupid or the uproarious stage of their drink. Two of\r\nthem sang a catch of a song, and I wondered that they had not already\r\nbrought down on them the officer of the day. I passed them carelessly with\r\na nod. One of them bawled out, "The watchword!" and I gave them\r\n"Culloden." Toward the skirts of the village I sauntered, fear dogging my\r\nfootsteps; and when I was once clear of the houses, cut across a meadow\r\ntoward the shore, wary as a panther, eyes and ears alert for signals of\r\ndanger. Without mishap I reached the sound, beat my way up the sand links\r\nfor a mile or more, and saw a boat cruising in the moonlight off shore. I\r\ngave the whaup\'s cry, and across the water came an answer.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later I was helping the gillie in the boat pull across to\r\nRaasay. When half way over we rested on our oars for a breathing space and\r\nI asked the news, the rug-headed kerne shot me with the dismal tidings\r\nthat Malcolm Macleod and Creagh, rowing to Skyes for a conference with\r\nCaptain Roy, had fallen into the hands of the troopers waiting for them\r\namong the sand dunes. He had but one bit of comfort in his budget, and\r\nthat was "ta yellow-haired Sassenach body wass leaving this morning with\r\nRaasay hersel\' and Murdoch." At least I had some assurance that my\r\nundertaking had secured the safety of the Prince, even though three\r\nstaunch men were on their way to their death by reason of it.\r\n\r\nOnce landed on Raasay, I made up the brae to the great house. Lights were\r\nstill burning, and when I got close \'twas easy to be seen that terror and\r\nconfusion filled it. Whimpering, white-faced women and wailing bairns ran\r\nhither and thither blindly. Somewhere in the back part of the house the\r\nbagpipes were soughing a dismal kind of dirge. Fierce-eyed men with mops\r\nof shock hair were gathered into groups of cursing clansmen. Through them\r\nall I pushed my way in to Aileen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE GOD HAS AN INNINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the great fireplace she stood, hands clasped, head upturned as in\r\nprayer. The lips moved silently in the petition of her heart. I saw in\r\nprofile a girl\'s troubled face charged with mystery, a slim, tall, weary\r\nfigure all in white against the flame, a cheek\'s pure oval, the tense\r\ncurve of a proud neck, a mass of severely snodded russet hair. So I\r\nrecalled her afterward, picture of desolation seeking comfort, but at the\r\nmoment when I blundered on her my presence seemed profanity and no time\r\nwas found for appraisement. Abashed I came to a halt, and was for\r\ntiptoeing back to the door; but hearing me she turned.\r\n\r\n"Kenneth!" she cried, and stood with parted lips. Then, "They told\r\nme----"\r\n\r\n"That I was taken. True, but I escaped. How, I will tell you later. The\r\nPrince-- Is he safe?"\r\n\r\n"For the present, yes. A lugger put in this morning belonging to some\r\nsmugglers. In it he sailed for the mainland with Ronald and Murdoch. You\r\nwill have heard the bad news," she cried.\r\n\r\n"That Malcolm, Creagh, and Donald are taken?"\r\n\r\n"And Flora, too. She iss to be sent to London for assisting in the escape\r\nof the Prince. And so are the others."\r\n\r\nI fell silent, deep in thought, and shortly came to a resolution.\r\n\r\n"Aileen, the Highlands are no place for me. I am a stranger here. Every\r\nclachan in which I am seen is full of danger for me. To-morrow I am for\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"To save Malcolm," she cried.\r\n\r\n"If I can. Raasay cannot go. He must stay to protect his clansmen. Murdoch\r\nis a fugitive and his speech would betray him in an hour. Remains only\r\nI."\r\n\r\n"And I."\r\n\r\n"You?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? After \'the \'15\' women\'s tears saved many a life. And I too have\r\nfriends. Sir Robert Volney, evil man as he iss, would move heaven and\r\nearth to save my brother."\r\n\r\nThere was much truth in what she said. In these days of many executions a\r\npardon was to be secured less by merit than by the massing of influence,\r\nand I knew of no more potent influence than a beautiful woman in tears.\r\nTogether we might be able to do something for our friends. But there was\r\nthe long journey through a hostile country to be thought of, and the\r\nprobability that we might never reach our destination in freedom. I could\r\nnot tell the blessed child that her presence would increase threefold my\r\nchances of being taken, nor indeed was that a thing that held weight with\r\nme. Sure, there was her reputation to be considered, but the company of a\r\nmaid would obviate that difficulty.\r\n\r\nRonald returned next day, and I laid the matter before him. He was\r\nextraordinarily loath to let Aileen peril herself, but on the other hand\r\nhe could not let Malcolm suffer the penalty of the law without making an\r\neffort on his behalf. Raasay was tied hand and foot by the suspicions of\r\nthe government and was forced to consent to leave the matter in our hands.\r\nHe made only the one stipulation, that we should go by way of Edinburgh\r\nand take his Aunt Miss MacBean with us as chaperone.\r\n\r\nWe embarked on the smuggler next day for the Long Island and were landed\r\nat Stornoway. After a dreary wait of over a week at this place we took\r\nshipping on a brig bound for Edinburgh. Along the north coast of Scotland,\r\nthrough the Pentland Firth, and down the east shore _The Lewis_ scudded.\r\nIt seemed that we were destined to have an uneventful voyage till one day\r\nwe sighted a revenue cutter which gave chase. As we had on board _The\r\nLewis_ a cargo of illicit rum, the brig being in the contraband trade,\r\nthere was nothing for it but an incontinent flight. For some hours our\r\nfate hung in the balance, but night coming on we slipped away in the\r\ndarkness. The Captain, however, being an exceedingly timid man for one in\r\nhis position, refused absolutely to put into the Leith Road lest his\r\nretreat should be cut off. Instead he landed us near Wemyss Castle, some\r\ndistance up the coast, and what was worse hours before the dawn had\r\ncleared and in a pelting rain.\r\n\r\nI wrapped Volney\'s cloak around Aileen and we took the southward road,\r\nhoping to come on some village where we might find shelter. The situation\r\nmight be thought one of extreme discomfort. There were we three--Aileen,\r\nher maid, and I--sloshing along the running road in black darkness with\r\nthe dreary splashing of the rain to emphasize our forlorn condition. Over\r\nunknown paths we travelled on precarious errand. Yet I for one never took\r\na journey that pleased me more. The mirk night shut out all others, and a\r\nfair face framed in a tartan shawl made my whole world for me. A note of\r\ntenderness not to be defined crept into our relationship. There was a\r\nsweet disorder in her hair and more than once the wind whaffed it into my\r\nface. In walking our fingers touched once and again; greatly daring, mine\r\nslipped over hers, and so like children we went hand in hand. An old\r\nromancer tells quaintly in one of his tales how Love made himself of the\r\nparty, and so it was with us that night. I found my answer at last without\r\nwords. While the heavens wept our hearts sang. The wine of love ran\r\nthrough me in exquisite thrills. Every simple word she spoke went to my\r\nheart like sweetest music, and every unconscious touch of her hand was a\r\ncaress.\r\n\r\n"Tired, Aileen?" I asked. "There is my arm to lean on."\r\n\r\n"No," she said, but presently her ringers rested on my sleeve.\r\n\r\n"\'T will be daylight soon, and see! the scudding clouds are driving away\r\nthe rain."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Kenneth," she answered, and sighed softly.\r\n\r\n"You will think I am a sad blunderer to bring you tramping through the\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"I will be thinking you are the good friend."\r\n\r\nToo soon the grey dawn broke, for at the first glimmer my love disengaged\r\nherself from my arm. I looked shyly at her, and the glory of her young\r\nbeauty filled me. Into her cheeks the raw morning wind had whipped the\r\nred, had flushed her like a radiant Diana. The fresh breeze had outlined\r\nher figure clear as she struggled against it, and the billowing sail was\r\nnot more graceful than her harmonious lines.\r\n\r\nOut of the sea the sun rose a great ball of flaming fire.\r\n\r\n"A good omen for the success of our journey," I cried. "Look!\r\n\r\n             "\'Night\'s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\r\n             Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.\'\r\n\r\n"The good God grant it prove so, Kenneth, for Malcolm and for all our\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nAfter all youth has its day and will not be denied. We were on an anxious\r\nundertaking of more than doubtful outcome, but save when we remembered to\r\nbe sober we trod the primrose path.\r\n\r\nWe presently came to a small village where we had breakfast at the inn.\r\nFor long we had eaten nothing but the musty fare of the brig, and I shall\r\nnever forget with what merry daffing we enjoyed the crisp oaten cake, the\r\nbuttered scones, the marmalade, and the ham and eggs. After we had eaten\r\nAileen went to her room to snatch some hours sleep while I made\r\narrangements for a cart to convey us on our way.\r\n\r\nA wimpling burn ran past the end of the inn garden, and here on a rustic\r\nbench I found my comrade when I sought her some hours later. The sun was\r\nshining on her russet-hair. Her chin was in her hands, her eyes on the\r\ngurgling brook. The memories of the night must still have been thrilling\r\nher, for she was singing softly that most exquisite of love songs "Annie\r\nLaurie."\r\n\r\n                     "\'Maxwelton\'s braes are bonnie,\r\n                       Where early fa\'s the dew,\r\n                     Where me and Annie Laurie\r\n                       Made up the promise true.\'"\r\n\r\nHer voice trembled a little, and I took up the song.\r\n\r\n                      "\'Made up the promise true,\r\n                        And ne\'er forget will I;\r\n                      And for bonnie Annie Laurie\r\n                        I\'d lay me doun and dee.\'"\r\n\r\nAt my first words she gave a little start, her lips parted, her head came\r\nup prettily to attention, and though I could not see them I was ready to\r\nvow that she listened with shining eyes. Softly her breath came and went.\r\nI trod nearer as I sang.\r\n\r\n                   "\'Her brow is like the snaw-drift,\r\n                     Her throat is like the swan,\r\n                   She\'s jimp about the middle,\r\n                     Her waist ye weel micht span.\'\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aileen, if I might--if I only had the right! Won\'t you give it me,\r\ndear heart?"\r\n\r\nIn the long silence my pulse stopped, then throbbed like an aching tooth.\r\n\r\n"I\'m waiting, Aileen. It is to be yes or no?"\r\n\r\nThe shy blue eyes met mine for an instant before they fluttered\r\ngroundward. I could scarce make out the low sweet music of her voice.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Kenneth, not now! You forget--my brother Malcolm----"\r\n\r\n"I forget everything but this, that I love you."\r\n\r\nIn her cheeks was being fought the war of the roses, with Lancaster\r\nvictorious. The long-lashed eyes came up to meet mine bravely, love lucent\r\nin them. Our glances married; in those clear Highland lochs of hers I was\r\nsunk fathoms deep.\r\n\r\n"Truly, Kenneth?"\r\n\r\n"From the head to the heel of you, Aileen, lass. For you I would die, and\r\nthat is all there is about it," I cried, wildly.\r\n\r\n"Well then, take me, Kenneth! I am all yours. Of telling love there will\r\nbe many ways in the Gaelic, and I am thinking them all at once."\r\n\r\nAnd this is the plain story of how the great happiness came into Kenneth\r\nMontagu\'s life, and how, though all unworthy, he won for his own the\r\ndaughter of Raasay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERMATH\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Edinburgh we received check one. Aileen\'s aunt had left for the\r\nHighlands the week before in a fine rage because the Duke of Cumberland,\r\nwho had foisted himself upon her unwilling hospitality, had eaten her out\r\nof house and home, then departing had borne away with him her cherished\r\nhousehold _penates_ to the value of some hundred pounds. Years later Major\r\nWolfe told me with twinkling eyes the story of how the fiery little lady\r\ncame to him with her tale of woe. If she did not go straight to the dour\r\nDuke it was because he was already out of the city and beyond her reach.\r\nInto Wolfe\'s quarters she bounced, rage and suspicion speaking eloquent in\r\nher manner.\r\n\r\n"Hech, sir! Where have ye that Dutch Prince of yours?" she demanded of\r\nWolfe, her keen eyes ranging over him.\r\n\r\n"\'Pon honour, madam, I have not him secreted on my person," returned the\r\nMajor, gravely turning inside out his pockets for her.\r\n\r\nThe spirited old lady glowered at him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s ill setting ye to be sae humoursome," she told him frankly. "It wad\r\nbe better telling ye to answer ceevilly a ceevil question, my birkie."\r\n\r\n"If I can be of any service, madam----"\r\n\r\n"Humph, service! And that\'s just it, my mannie. The ill-faured tykes hae\r\nrampaigned through the house and taen awa\' my bonnie silver tea service\r\nthat I hae scoured every Monday morning for thirty-seven years come\r\nMichelmas, forby the fine Holland linen that my father, guid carefu\' man,\r\nbrought frae the continent his nainsel."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry----"\r\n\r\n"Sorry! Hear till him," she snorted. "Muckle guid your sorrow will do me\r\nunless----" her voice fell to a wheedling cajolery--"you just be a guid\r\nladdie and get me back my linen and the silver."\r\n\r\n"The Duke has a partiality for fine bed linen, and quaint silver devices\r\nare almost a mania with him. Perhaps some of your other possessions"--\r\n\r\n"His Dutch officers ate me out of house and home. They took awa\' eight\r\nsacks of the best lump sugar."\r\n\r\n"The army is in need of sugar. I fear it is not recoverable."\r\n\r\nMiss MacBean had a way of affecting deafness when the occasion suited\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Eih, sir! Were you saying you wad see it was recovered? And my silver set\r\nwi\' twenty solid teaspoons, forby the linen?" she asked anxiously, her\r\nhand to her ear.\r\n\r\nWolfe smiled.\r\n\r\n"I fear the Duke----"\r\n\r\n"Ou ay, I ken fine you fear him. He\'s gurly enough, Guid kens."\r\n\r\n"I was about to say, madam, that I fear the Duke will regard them as\r\nspoils from the enemy not to be given up."\r\n\r\nThe Major was right. Miss MacBean might as well have saved her breath to\r\ncool her porridge, for the Duke carried her possessions to London despite\r\nher remonstrances. Five years later as I was passing by a pawnbroker\'s\r\nshop on a mean street in London Miss MacBean\'s teapot with its curious\r\ndevice of a winged dragon for a spout caught my eye in the window. The\r\nshopkeeper told me that it had been sold him by a woman of the demi-monde\r\nwho had formerly been a mistress of the Duke of Cumberland. She said that\r\nit was a present from his Royal Highness, who had taken the silver service\r\nfrom the house of a fiery rebel lady in the north.\r\n\r\nOur stay in the Scottish capital was of the shortest. In the early morning\r\nwe went knocking at the door of Miss MacBean\'s house. All day I kept under\r\ncover and in the darkness of night we slipped out of the city southwest\r\nbound. Of that journey, its sweet comradeship, its shy confidences, its\r\nperpetual surprises for each of us in discovering the other, I have no\r\ntime nor mind to tell. The very danger which was never absent from our\r\ntravel drew us into a closer friendliness. Was there an option between two\r\nroads, or the question of the desirability of putting up at a certain inn,\r\nour heads came together to discuss it. Her pretty confidence in me was\r\ntouching in the extreme. To have her hold me a Captain Greatheart made my\r\nsoul glad, even though I knew my measure did not fit the specifications by\r\na mile. Her trust in me was less an incense to my vanity than a spur to my\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nThe mere joy of living flooded my blood with happiness in those days. I\r\nvow it made me a better man to breathe the same air as she, to hear the\r\nlilt of her merry laugh and the low music of her sweet voice. Not a curve\r\nin that dimpled cheek I did not love; not a ripple in the russet hair my\r\nhungry eyes had not approved. When her shy glance fell on me I rode in the\r\nsunshine of bluest sky. If by chance her hand touched mine, my veins\r\nleaped with the wine of it. Of such does the happiness of youth consist.\r\n\r\n\'Tis strange how greedy love is in its early days of the past from which\r\nit has been excluded, how jealous sometimes of the point of contact with\r\nother lives in the unknown years which have gone to make up the rungs of\r\nthe ladder of life. I was never tired of hearing of her childhood on the\r\nbraes of Raasay: how she guddled for mountain trout in the burn with her\r\nbrother Murdoch or hung around his neck chains of daisies in childish\r\nglee. And she-- Faith, she drew me out with shy questions till that part\r\nof my life which would bear telling must have been to her a book learned\r\nby rote.\r\n\r\nYet there were times when we came near to misunderstanding of each other.\r\nThe dear child had been brought up in a houseful of men, her mother having\r\ndied while she was yet an infant, and she was in some ways still innocent\r\nas a babe. The circumstances of our journey put her so much in my power\r\nthat I, not to take advantage of the situation, sometimes held myself with\r\nundue stiffness toward her when my every impulse was to tenderness.\r\nPerhaps it might be that we rode through woodland in the falling dusk\r\nwhile the nesting birds sang madrigals of love. Longing with all my heart\r\nto touch but the hem of her gown, I would yet ride with a wooden face set\r\nto the front immovably, deaf to her indirect little appeals for\r\nfriendliness. Presently, ashamed of my gruffness, I would yield to the\r\nsweetness of her charm, good resolutions windwood scattered, and woo her\r\nwith a lover\'s ardour till the wild-rose deepened in her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Were you ever in love before, Kennie?" she asked me once, twisting at a\r\nbutton of my coat. We were drawing near Manchester and had let the\r\npostillion drive on with the coach, while we loitered hand in hand through\r\nthe forest of Arden. The azure sky was not more blue than the eyes which\r\nlifted shyly to mine, nor the twinkling stars which would soon gaze down\r\non us one half so bright.\r\n\r\nI laughed happily. "Once--in a boy\'s way--a thousand years ago."\r\n\r\n"And were you caring for her--much?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, vastly."\r\n\r\n"And she--wass she loving you too?"\r\n\r\n"More than tongue could tell, she made me believe."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am not wondering at that," said my heart\'s desire. "Of course she\r\nwould be loving you."\r\n\r\n\'Twas Aileen\'s way to say the thing she thought, directly, in headlong\r\nHighland fashion. Of finesse she used none. She loved me (oh, a thousand\r\ntimes more than I deserved!) and that was all there was about it. To be\r\nashamed of her love or to hide it never, I think, occurred to her. What\r\nmore natural then than that others should think of me as she did?\r\n\r\n"Of course," I said dryly. "But in the end my sweetheart, plighted to me\r\nfor all eternity, had to choose betwixt her lover and something she had\r\nwhich he much desired. She sighed, deliberated long--full five seconds I\r\nvow--and in end played traitor to love. She was desolated to lose me, but\r\nthe alternative was not to be endured. She sacrificed me for a raspberry\r\ntart. So was shattered young love\'s first dream. \'Tis my only consolation\r\nthat I snatched the tart and eat it as I ran. Thus Phyllis lost both her\r\nlover and her portion. Ah, those brave golden days! The world, an\r\nunexplored wonder, lay at my feet. She was seven, I was nine."\r\n\r\n"Oh." There was an odd little note of relief in the velvet voice that\r\nseemed to reproach me for a brute. I was forever forgetting that the ways\r\nof \'Toinette Westerleigh were not the ways of Aileen Macleod.\r\n\r\nThe dying sun flooded the topmost branches of the forest foliage. My eyes\r\ncame round to the aureole which was their usual magnet.\r\n\r\n"When the sun catches it \'tis shot with glints of gold."\r\n\r\n"It is indeed very beautiful."\r\n\r\n"In cloudy weather \'tis a burnished bronze."\r\n\r\nShe looked at me in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Bronze! Surely you are meaning green?"\r\n\r\n"Not I, bronze. Again you might swear it russet."\r\n\r\n"That will be in the autumn when they are turning colour just before the\r\nfall."\r\n\r\n"No, that is when you have it neatly snodded and the firelight plays about\r\nyour head."\r\n\r\nShe laughed, flushing. "You will be forever at your foolishness, Kenn. I\r\nthought you meant the tree tips."\r\n\r\n"Is the truth foolishness?"\r\n\r\n"You are a lover, Kennie. Other folks don\'t see that when they look at\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Other folks are blind," I maintained, stoutly.\r\n\r\n"If you see all that I will be sure that what they say is true and love is\r\nblind."\r\n\r\n"The wise man is the lover. He sees clear for the first time in his life.\r\nThe sun shines for him--and her. For them the birds sing and the flowers\r\nbloom. For them the world was made. They----"\r\n\r\n"Whiles talk blethers," she laughed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they do," I admitted. "And there again is another sign of wisdom.\r\nYour ponderous fool talks pompous sense always. He sees life in only one\r\nfacet. Your lover sees its many sides, its infinite variety. He can laugh\r\nand weep; his imagination lights up dry facts with whimsical fancies; he\r\ndives through the crust of conventionality to the realities of life. \'Tis\r\nthe lover keeps this old world young. The fire of youth, of eternal\r\nlaughing youth, runs flaming through his blood. His days are radiant, his\r\nnights enchanted."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking you quite a poet."\r\n\r\n"Was there ever a better subject for a poem? Life would be poetry writ\r\ninto action if all men were lovers--and all women Aileens."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Kenneth! This fine talk I do not understand. It\'s sheer nonsense to\r\ntell such idle clavers about me. Am I not just a plain Highland lassie, as\r\nunskilled in flattering speeches as in furbelows and patches? Gin you will\r\nplay me a spring on the pipes I\'ll maybe can dance you the fling, but of\r\nFrench minuets I have small skill."\r\n\r\n"Call me dreamer if you will. By Helen\'s glove, your dreamer might be the\r\nenvy of kings. Since I have known you life has taken a different hue. One\r\nlives for years without joy, pain, colour, all things toned to the dull\r\nmonochrome of gray, and then one day the contact with another soul\r\nquickens one to renewed life, to more eager unselfish living. Never so\r\nbright a sun before, never so beautiful a moon. \'Tis true, Aileen. No fear\r\nbut one, that Fate, jealous, may snatch my love from me."\r\n\r\nHer laughter dashed my heroics; yet I felt, too, that back of her smiles\r\nthere was belief.\r\n\r\n"I dare say. At the least I will have heard it before. The voice iss\r\nJacob\'s voice, but----"\r\n\r\nI blushed, remembering too late that my text and its application were both\r\nVolney\'s.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis true, even if Jacob said it first. If a man is worth his salt love\r\nmust purify him. Sure it must. I am a better man for knowing you."\r\n\r\nA shy wonder filled her eyes; thankfulness too was there.\r\n\r\n"Yet you are a man that has fought battles and known life, and I am only\r\nan ignorant girl."\r\n\r\nI lifted her hand and kissed it.\r\n\r\n"You are my queen, and I am your most loyal and devoted servant."\r\n\r\n"For always, Kenn? When you are meeting the fine ladies of London will you\r\nlove a Highland lassie that cannot make eyes and swear choicely?"\r\n\r\n"Forever and a day, dear."\r\n\r\nAileen referred to the subject again two hours later when we arose from\r\nthe table at the Manchester ordinary. It was her usual custom to retire to\r\nher room immediately after eating. To-night when I escorted her to the\r\ndoor she stood for a moment drawing patterns on the lintel with her fan. A\r\nfine blush touched her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Were you meaning all that, Kennie?"\r\n\r\n"All what, dear heart?"\r\n\r\n"That--nonsense--in the forest."\r\n\r\n"Every bit of it."\r\n\r\nHer fan spelt Kenneth on the door.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," she went on softly, "a fancy is built on moonlight and\r\nlaughing eyes and opportunity. It iss like sunshine in winter on\r\nRaasay--just for an hour and then the mists fall."\r\n\r\n"For our love there will be no mists."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Kenn, you think so now, but afterward, when you take up again your\r\nLondon life, and I cannot play the lady of fashion, when you weary of my\r\nsimpleness and are wishing me back among the purple heather hills?"\r\n\r\n"That will be never, unless I wish myself there with you. I am no London\r\nMohawk like Volney. To tramp the heather after muircocks or to ride to\r\nhounds is more my fancy. The Macaronis and I came long since to the\r\nparting of the ways. I am for a snug home in the country with the woman I\r\nlove."\r\n\r\nI stepped to the table, filled a glass with wine, and brought it to her.\r\n\r\n"Come, love! We will drink together. How is it old Ben Jonson hath it?\r\n\r\n                 "\'Drink to me only with thine eyes,\r\n                 And I will pledge with mine;\r\n                 Or leave a kiss but in the cup,\r\n                 And I\'ll not look for wine.\r\n                 The thirst that from the soul doth rise\r\n                 Doth seek a drink divine;\r\n                 But might I of Jove\'s nectar sup\r\n                 I would not change from thine.\'\r\n\r\n"Drink, sweetheart."\r\n\r\nShe tasted, then I drained the glass and let it fall from my fingers to\r\nshiver on the floor.\r\n\r\nBefore we parted Aileen had one more word for me, "Kennie."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear heart," I cried, and was back at her side in a moment.\r\n\r\n"What you said in the woods--I am knowing it all true. It is great\r\nfoolishness, but my heart is singing the same song," and with that she\r\nwhipped the door to in my face.\r\n\r\nI sauntered into the common room, found a seat by the fireplace, and let\r\nmy eye wander over the company. There were present some half dozen yokels,\r\nthe vicar\'s curate, a country blood or two, and a little withered runt of\r\na man in fustian with a weazened face like a wrinkled pippin. The moment I\r\nclapped eyes on him there came to my mind the dim recollection of a former\r\nacquaintance and the prescient fear of an impending danger. That I had\r\nseen him I was ready to take oath, yet I could not put my finger upon the\r\ncircumstances. But the worst of it was that the old fellow recognized me,\r\nunless I were much mistaken, for his eyes never left me from the first.\r\n\r\nFrom my mother I have inherited a Highland jauntiness which comes stealing\r\nover me when sobriety would set me better. Let the situation be a\r\ndifferent one, uncertain of solution, with heads tipping in the balance,\r\nand an absurd spirit of recklessness straightway possesses me. But now,\r\nwith this dear child on my hands, carelessness and I were far apart as the\r\npoles. Anxiety gripped me, and I sweated blood. Yet I must play the\r\ncareless traveller, be full of good stories, unperturbed on the surface\r\nand apparently far from alarm. I began to overdo the part, recognized the\r\nfact, and grew savage at myself. Trying to conciliate him, I was free with\r\nthe ale, and again overdid it.\r\n\r\nHe drank my ale and listened to my stories, but he sat cocking on his seat\r\nlike an imp of mischief. I rattled on, insouciant and careless to all\r\nappearances, but in reality my heart like lead. Behind my smiling lips I\r\ncursed him up hill and down dale. Lard, his malicious grin was a thing to\r\nrile the gods! More than once I wake up in the night from dreaming that\r\nhis scrawny hand was clapping the darbies on my wrists.\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to start next morning the post boy let me know that one\r\nof the horses had gone lame. Here was a pretty pickle. I pished and\r\npshawed, but in the end had to scour the town to find another in its\r\nplace. \'Twas well on toward noon when the boy and I returned to the\r\nordinary with a nag that would serve.\r\n\r\nOf other lovers I have scant knowledge, but the one I know was wont to\r\ncherish the memory of things his love had said and how she had said them;\r\nwith what a pretty tilt to her chin, with what a daring shyness of the\r\neyes, with what a fine colour and impetuous audacity she had done this or\r\nlooked that. He was wont in advance to plan out conversations, to decide\r\nthat he would tell her some odd brain fancy and watch her while he told\r\nit. Many an hour he spent in the fairy land of imagination; many a one he\r\ndreamed away in love castles built of fancied rambles in enchanted woods,\r\nof sweet talks in which he always said and did the right thing; destined\r\nalas! never to pass from mind to speech, for if ever tongue essayed the\r\ntelling it faltered some fatuous abortion as little like love\'s dream as\r\nCaliban resembled Ariel. Fresh from the brave world of day-dreams, still\r\nsmiling happily from some whimsical conceit as well as with anticipation\r\nof Aileen\'s gladness at sight of me, I passed through the courtyard and\r\ninto the ordinary.\r\n\r\nA hubbub at the foot of the stairway attracted me. A gaping crowd was\r\ngathered there about three central figures. My weasened pippin-face of the\r\nmalicious grin was one of them; a broad-shouldered, fair-faced and very\r\nmuch embarrassed young officer in the King\'s uniform stood beside him; and\r\nfrom the stairway some three steps up Aileen, plainly frightened, fronted\r\nthem and answered questions in her broken English.\r\n\r\n"I am desolated to distress you, madam," the boy officer was saying, "but\r\nthis man has laid an information with me that there is a rebel in your\r\nparty, one who was in Manchester with the Pretender\'s force some months\r\nsince. It will be necessary that I have speech with him."\r\n\r\n"There iss no rebel with me, sir. The gentleman with whom I travel iss of\r\nmost approved loyalty," she faltered.\r\n\r\n"Ah! He will no doubt be able to make that clear to me. May I ask where he\r\nis at present?"\r\n\r\nAileen went white as snow. Her distress was apparent to all.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I do entreat you to believe that what I say iss true," she cried\r\nwhitely.\r\n\r\nThe little rat in fustian broke out screaming that he would swear to me\r\namong ten thousand: as to the girl she must be the rebel\'s accomplice, his\r\nmistress mayhap. Aileen, her big, anxious eyes fixed on the officer,\r\nshrank back against the stair rail at her accuser\'s word. The lad\r\ncommanded him sharply to be quiet, but with the utmost respect let Aileen\r\nunderstand that he must have talk with me.\r\n\r\nAll this one swift glance had told me, and at this opportune moment I\r\nsauntered up, Volney\'s snuff-box in my hand. If the doubt possessed me as\r\nto how the devil I was to win free from this accusation, I trust no shadow\r\nof fear betrayed itself in my smirking face.\r\n\r\n"Egad, here\'s a gathering of the clans. Hope I\'m not _de trop_," I\r\nsimpered.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant bowed to me with evident relief.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, sir, if you are the gentleman travelling with this lady\r\nyou are the desired complement to our party. There has been some doubt\r\nexpressed as to you. This man here claims to have recognized you as one of\r\nthe Pretender\'s army; says he was present when you bought provisions for a\r\ntroop of horsemen during the rebel invasion of this town."\r\n\r\n"\'Slife, perhaps I\'m Charles Stuart himself," I shrugged.\r\n\r\n"I swear to him. I swear to him," screamed fustian.\r\n\r\nOn my soul merely to look at the man gave me a nausea. His white\r\nmalevolence fair scunnered me.\r\n\r\nI adjusted Volney\'s eye-glass with care and looked the fellow over with a\r\ncandid interest, much as your scientist examines a new specimen.\r\n\r\n"What the plague! Is this rusty old last year\'s pippin an evidence against\r\nme? Rot me, he\'s a pretty scrub on which to father a charge against a\r\ngentleman, Lud, his face is a lie. No less!"\r\n\r\n"May I ask your name, sir, and your business in this part of the country?"\r\nsaid the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nSome impulse--perhaps the fact that I was wearing his clothes--put it into\r\nmy head to borrow Volney\'s name. There was risk that the lad might have\r\nmet the baronet, but that was a contingency which must be ventured. It\r\nbrought him to like a shot across a lugger\'s bows.\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert Volney, the friend of the Prince," he said, patently\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n"The Prince has that honour," I smiled.\r\n\r\n"Pray pardon my insistence. Orders from headquarters," says he\r\napologetically.\r\n\r\nI waved aside his excuses peevishly.\r\n\r\n"Sink me, Sir Robert Volney should be well enough known not to be badgered\r\nby every country booby with a king\'s commission. Lard, I vow I\'ll have a\r\nchange when Fritz wears the crown."\r\n\r\nWith that I turned on my heel in a simulation of petty anger, offered my\r\narm to Aileen, and marched up the stairs with her. My manner and my speech\r\nwere full of flowered compliments to her, of insolence to the young\r\ngentleman below, for there is nothing more galling to a man\'s pride than\r\nto be ignored.\r\n\r\n"\'Twas the only way," I said to Aileen when the door was closed on us\r\nabove. "\'Tis a shame to flout an honest young gentleman so, but in such\r\nfashion the macaroni would play the part. Had I stayed to talk with him he\r\nmight have asked for my proof. We\'re well out of the affair."\r\n\r\nBut we were not out of it yet. I make no doubt that no sooner was my back\r\nturned than the little rat in fustian, his mind set on a possible reward,\r\nwas plucking at the lad\'s sleeve with suggestions and doubts. In any case\r\nthere came presently a knock at the door. I opened. The boy officer was\r\nthere with a red face obstinately set.\r\n\r\n"Sir, I must trouble you again," he said icily. "You say you are Sir\r\nRobert Volney. I must ask you for proofs."\r\n\r\nAt once I knew that I had overdone my part. It had been better to have\r\ndealt with this youth courteously; but since I had chosen my part, I must\r\nplay it.\r\n\r\n"Proofs," I cried blackly. "Do you think I carry proofs of my identity for\r\nevery country bumpkin to read? Sink me, \'tis an outrage."\r\n\r\nHe flushed, but hung doggedly to his point.\r\n\r\n"You gain nothing by insulting me, Sir Robert. I may be only a poor line\r\nofficer and you one high in power, but by Heaven! I\'m as good a man as\r\nyou," cried the boy; then rapped out, "I\'ll see your papers, if you have\r\nme broke for it."\r\n\r\nMy papers! An inspiration shot into my brain. When Volney had substituted\r\nfor me at Portree he had given me a pass through the lines, made out in\r\nhis name and signed by the Duke of Cumberland, in order that I might\r\npresent it if challenged. Hitherto I had not been challenged, and indeed I\r\nhad forgotten the existence of it, but now-- I fished out the sheet of\r\nparchment and handed it to the officer. His eye ran over the passport, and\r\nhe handed it back with a flushed face.\r\n\r\n"I have to offer a thousand apologies for troubling you, Sir Robert. This\r\npaper establishes your identity beyond doubt."\r\n\r\n"Hope you\'re quite satisfied," I said with vast irony.\r\n\r\n"Oh, just one more question. The lady travelling with you?"\r\n\r\nI watched him silently.\r\n\r\n"She is from the Highlands, is she not?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Is she?"\r\n\r\n"To be sure \'tis sufficient if Sir Robert Volney vouches for her."\r\n\r\n"Is it?"\r\n\r\n"And of course the fact that she travels in his company----"\r\n\r\nMy answer was a yawn, half stifled behind my hand. The lad glared at me,\r\nin a rage at me for my insolence and at himself for his boyish inability\r\nto cope with it. Then he swung on his heel and stamped down-stairs. Five\r\nyears later I met him at a dinner given by a neighbour of mine in the\r\ncountry, and I took occasion then to explain to him my intolerable\r\nconduct. Many a laugh we have since had over it.\r\n\r\nWe reached London on a dismal Wednesday when the rain was pouring down in\r\nsheets. Aileen I took at once to our town house that she might be with\r\nCloe, though I expected to put up with my old nurse in another part of the\r\ncity. I leave you to conceive the surprise of Charles and my sister when\r\nwe dropped in on them.\r\n\r\nThe news they had for us was of the worst. Every week witnessed the\r\nexecution of some poor Jacobites and the arrival of a fresh batch to take\r\ntheir place in the prisons. The Scotch Lords Balmerino, Cromartie and\r\nKilmarnock were already on trial and their condemnation was a foregone\r\nconclusion. The thirst for blood was appalling and not at all glutted by\r\nthe numerous executions that had already occurred. \'Twas indeed for me a\r\nmost dismal home-coming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA REPRIEVE!\r\n\r\n\r\n"My Lord of March, is Arthur Lord Balmerino guilty of High Treason?"\r\n\r\nLord March, youngest peer of the realm, profligate and scoundrel, laid his\r\nhand on the place where his heart ought to have been and passed judgment\r\nunctuously.\r\n\r\n"Guilty, upon my honour."\r\n\r\nThe Lord High Steward repeated the same question to each of the peers in\r\norder of their age and received from each the same answer. As it became\r\nplain that the prisoner at the bar was to be convicted the\r\ngentleman-gaoler gradually turned the edge of his axe toward Balmerino,\r\nwhose manner was nonchalant and scornful. When the vote had been polled my\r\nLord bowed to the judges with dignity and remarked, "I am sorry to have\r\ntaken up so much of your time without avail, my lords. If I pleaded \'not\r\nguilty\' my principal reason was that the ladies might not miss their\r\nshow." Shortly afterward he was ushered out of Westminster Hall to his\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nFrom the view-point of the whigs Balmerino was undoubtedly guilty as\r\nLucifer and not all the fair play in the world could have saved him from\r\nTower Hill. He was twice a rebel, having been pardoned for his part in\r\n"the \'15," and \'twas not to be expected that so hardened an offender would\r\nagain receive mercy. But at the least he might have been given courtesy,\r\nand that neither he nor his two fellows, Kilmarnock and Cromartie, did at\r\nall receive. The crown lawyers to the contrary took an unmanly delight in\r\ngirding and snapping at the captives whom the fortune of war had put in\r\ntheir power. Monstrous charges were trumped up that could not be\r\nsubstantiated, even the Lord High Steward descending to vituperation.\r\n\r\nHorry Walpole admitted Balmerino to be the bravest man he had ever seen.\r\nThroughout the trial his demeanour had been characteristic of the man,\r\nbold and intrepid even to the point of bravado. The stout old lord\r\nconversed with the official axe-bearer and felt the edge of the ominous\r\ninstrument with the unconcern of any chance spectator. There was present a\r\nlittle boy who could see nothing for the crowd and Balmerino alone was\r\nunselfish enough to think of him. He made a seat for the child beside\r\nhimself and took care that he missed nothing of the ceremony. When the\r\nSolicitor-General, whose brother, Secretary Murray, had saved his own life\r\nby turning evidence against Balmerino, went up to the Scotch Lord and\r\nasked him insolently how he dared give the peers so much trouble,\r\nBalmerino drew himself up with dignity and asked, "Who is this person?"\r\nBeing told that it was Mr. Murray, "Oh!" he answered smiling, "Mr. Murray!\r\nI am glad to see you. I have been with several of your relations; the good\r\nlady your mother was of great use to us at Perth."\r\n\r\nThrough the crowd I elbowed my way and waited for the three condemned\r\nScotch lords to pass into their carriages. Balmerino, bluff and soldierly,\r\nled the way; next came the tall and elegant Kilmarnock; Lord Cromartie,\r\nplainly nervous and depressed, brought up the rear. Balmerino recognized\r\nme, nodded almost imperceptibly, but of course gave no other sign of\r\nknowing the gawky apprentice who gaped at him along with a thousand\r\nothers. Some one in the crowd cried out, "Which is Balmerino?" The old\r\nlord turned courteously, and said with a bow, "I am Balmerino." At the\r\ndoor of the coach he stopped to shake hands with his fellow-sufferers.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry that I alone cannot pay the debt, gentlemen. But after all\r\n\'tis but what we owe to nature sooner or later, the common debt of all. I\r\nbear in mind what Sir Walter Raleigh wrote the night before his head paid\r\nforfeit.\r\n\r\n              "\'Cowards fear to die; but courage stout,\r\n              Rather than live in snuff, will be put out.\'\r\n\r\n"Poor Murray drags out a miserable life despised by all, but we go to our\r\nGod with clean hands. By St. Andrew, the better lot is ours."\r\n\r\n"I think of my poor wife and eight fatherless bairns," said Cromartie\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\nRough Arthur Elphinstone\'s comforting hand fell on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"A driech outlook, my friend. You must commend them to the God of orphans\r\nif the worst befalls. As for us-- Well, in the next world we will not be\r\ntried by a whig jury."\r\n\r\nBalmerino stepped into the coach which was waiting to convey him to the\r\nTower. The gentleman-gaoler followed with the official axe, the edge of\r\nwhich still pointed toward its victim. He must have handled it carelessly\r\nin getting into the carriage, for I heard Balmerino bark out,\r\n\r\n"Take care, man, or you\'ll break my shins with that d----d axe."\r\n\r\nThey were the last words I ever heard from his lips. The door slammed and\r\nthe coach drove away to the prison, from which my Lord came forth only to\r\nmeet the headsman and his block.\r\n\r\nSadly I made my way towards the city through the jostling crowds of\r\nsightseers. Another batch of captives from the North was to pass through\r\nthe town that day on their way to prison, and a fleering rabble surged to\r\nand fro about the streets of London in gala dress, boisterous, jovial,\r\npitiless. From high to low by common consent the town made holiday. Above\r\nthe common ruck, in windows hired for the occasion, the fashionable world,\r\nexuding patronage and perfume, sat waiting for the dreary procession to\r\npass. In the windows opposite where I found standing room a party from the\r\nWest End made much talk and laughter. In the group I recognized Antoinette\r\nWesterleigh, Sir James Craven, and Topham Beauclerc.\r\n\r\n"Slitterkins! I couldn\'t get a seat at Westminster Hall this morning for\r\nlove or money," pouted Mistress Westerleigh. "\'Tis pity you men can\'t find\r\nroom for a poor girl to see the show."\r\n\r\n"Egad, there might as well have been no rebellion at all," said Beauclerc\r\ndryly. "Still, you can go to see their heads chopped off. \'Twill be some\r\ncompensation."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll go, Selwyn," said Craven to that gentleman, who with\r\nVolney had just joined the group.\r\n\r\n"I suppose so, and to make amends I\'ll go to see them sewn on again,"\r\nreturned Selwyn.\r\n\r\n"I hear you want the High Steward\'s wand for a memento," said Beauclerc.\r\n\r\n"Not I," returned Selwyn. "I did, but egad! he behaved so like an attorney\r\nthe first day and so like a pettifogger the second that I wouldn\'t take\r\nthe wand to light my fire with."\r\n\r\n"Here they come, sink me!" cried Craven, and craned forward to get a first\r\nglimpse of the wretched prisoners.\r\n\r\nFirst came four wagon-loads of the wounded, huddled together thick as\r\nshrimps, their pallid faces and forlorn appearance a mute cry for\r\nsympathy. The mob roared like wild beasts, poured out maledictions on\r\ntheir unkempt heads, hurled stones and sticks at them amid furious din and\r\nclamour. At times it seemed as if the prisoners would be torn from the\r\nhands of their guard by the excited mob. Scarce any name was found too\r\nvile with which to execrate these unfortunate gentlemen who had been\r\nguilty of no crime but excessive loyalty.\r\n\r\nSome of the captives were destined for the New Prison in Southwark, others\r\nfor Newgate, and a few for the Marshalsea. Those of the prisoners who were\r\nable to walk were handcuffed together in couples, with the exception of a\r\nfew of the officers who rode on horseback bound hand and foot. Among the\r\nhorsemen I easily recognized Malcolm Macleod, who sat erect, dour,\r\nscornful, his strong face set like a vise, looking neither to the right\r\nnor the left. Another batch of foot prisoners followed. Several of the\r\npoor fellows were known to me, including Leath, Chadwick, and the lawyer\r\nMorgan. My roving eye fell on Creagh and Captain Roy shackled together.\r\n\r\nFrom the window above a piercing cry of agony rang out.\r\n\r\n"Tony! Tony!"\r\n\r\nCreagh slewed round his head and threw up his free hand.\r\n\r\n"\'Toinette!" he cried.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Westerleigh had fainted, and Volney was already carrying her from\r\nthe window with the flicker of a grim smile on his face. I noticed with\r\nrelief that Craven had disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nMy relief was temporary. When I turned to leave I found my limbs clogged\r\nwith impedimenta. To each arm hung a bailiff, and a third clung like a\r\nleech to my legs. Some paces distant Sir James Craven stood hulloing them\r\nto the sport with malign pleasure.\r\n\r\n"To it, fustian breeches! Yoho, yoho! There\'s ten guineas in it for each\r\nof you and two hundred for me. \'Slife, down with him, you red-haired\r\nfellow! Throw him hard. Ecod, I\'ll teach you to be rough with Craven, my\r\ncockerel Montagu!" And the bully kicked me twice where I lay.\r\n\r\nThey dragged me to my feet, and Craven began to sharpen his dull wit on\r\nme.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred guineas I get out of this, you cursed rebel highwayman,\r\nbesides the pleasure of seeing you wear hemp--and that\'s worth a hundred\r\nmore, sink my soul to hell if it isn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Your soul is sunk there long ago, and this blackguard job sends you one\r\ncircle lower in the Inferno, Catchpoll Craven," said a sneering voice\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nCraven swung on his heel in a fury, but Volney\'s easy manner--and perhaps\r\nthe reputation of his small sword too--damped the mettle of his courage.\r\nHe drew back with a curse, whispered a word into the ear of the nearest\r\nbailiff, and shouldered his way into the crowd, from the midst of which he\r\nwatched us with a sneer.\r\n\r\n"And what mad folly, may I ask, brought you back to London a-courting the\r\ngallows?" inquired Volney of me.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you heard that Malcolm Macleod is taken?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"And did you come to exchange places with him? On my soul you\'re madder\r\nthan I thought. Couldn\'t you trust me to see that my future brother-in-law\r\ncomes to no harm without ramming your own head down the lion\'s throat?\r\nFaith, I think Craven has the right of it: the hempen noose is yawning for\r\nsuch fools as you."\r\n\r\nThe bailiffs took me to the New Prison and thrust me into an underground\r\ncell about the walls of which moisture hung in beads. Like the rest of the\r\nprisoners I was heavily ironed by day and fastened down to the floor by a\r\nstaple at night. One hour in the day we were suffered to go into the yard\r\nfor exercise and to be inspected and commented upon by the great number of\r\nvisitors who were allowed access to the prison. On the second day of my\r\narrival I stood blinking in the strong sunlight, having just come up from\r\nmy dark cell, when two prisoners shuffled across the open to me, their\r\nfetters dragging on the ground. Conceive my great joy at finding Creagh\r\nand Donald Roy fellow inmates of New Prison with me. Indeed Captain Roy\r\noccupied the very next cell to mine.\r\n\r\nI shall not weary you with any account of our captivity except to state\r\nthat the long confinement in my foul cell sapped my health. I fell victim\r\nto agues and fevers. Day by day I grew worse until I began to think that\r\n\'twas a race between disease and the gallows. Came at last my trial, and\r\nprison attendants haled me away to the courts. Poor Leath, white to the\r\nlips, was being hustled out of the room just as I entered.\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, Montagu, these whigs treat us like dogs," he cried\r\npassionately to me. "They are not content with our lives, but must heap\r\nfoul names and infamy upon us."\r\n\r\nThe guards hurried us apart before I could answer. I asked one of them\r\nwhat the verdict had been in Leath\'s case, and the fellow with an evil\r\nlaugh made a horrid gesture with his hands that confirmed my worst fears.\r\n\r\nIn the court room I found a frowning judge, a smug-faced yawning jury, and\r\nrow upon row of eager curious spectators come to see the show. Besides\r\nthese there were some half-score of my friends attending in the vain hope\r\nof lending me countenance. My shifting glance fell on Charles, Cloe, and\r\nAileen, all three with faces like the corpse for colour and despairing\r\neyes which spoke of a hopeless misery. They had fought desperately for my\r\nlife, but they knew I was doomed. I smiled sadly on them, then turned to\r\nshake hands with George Selwyn.\r\n\r\nHe hoped, in his gentle drawl, that I would win clear. My face lit up at\r\nhis kindly interest. I was like a drowning man clutching at straws. Even\r\nthe good-will of a turnkey was of value to me.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Selwyn," I said, a little brokenly. "I\'m afraid there\'s no chance\r\nfor me, but it\'s good hearing that you are on my side."\r\n\r\nHe appeared embarrassed at my eagerness. Not quite good form he thought\r\nit, I dare say. His next words damped the glow at my heart.\r\n\r\n"\'Gad, yes! Of course. I ought to be; bet five ponies with Craven that you\r\nwould cheat the gallows yet. He gave me odds of three to one, and I\r\nthought it a pretty good risk."\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me fantastically that he was looking me over with the eye\r\nof an underwriter who has insured at a heavy premium a rotten hulk bound\r\nfor stormy seas. I laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"You may win yet," I said. "This cursed prison fever is eating me up;" and\r\nwith that I turned my back on him.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to go into my trial with any particularity. From first to\r\nlast I had no chance and everybody in the room understood it. There were a\r\ndozen witnesses to prove that I had been in the thick of the rebellion.\r\nAmong the rest was Volney, in a vile temper at being called on to give\r\ntestimony. He was one of your reluctant witnesses, showed a decided\r\nacrimony toward the prosecution, and had to have the facts drawn out of\r\nhim as with a forceps. Such a witness, of high social standing and\r\nevidently anxious to shield me, was worth to the State more than all the\r\nother paltry witnesses combined. The jury voted guilty without leaving the\r\ncourt-room, after which the judge donned his black cap and pronounced the\r\nhorrible judgment which was the doom of traitors. I was gash with fear,\r\nbut I looked him in the face and took it smilingly. It was Volney who led\r\nthe murmur of approval which greeted my audacity, a murmur which broke\r\nfrankly into applause when Aileen, white to the lips, came fearlessly up\r\nto bid me be of good cheer, that she would save me yet if the importunity\r\nof a woman would avail aught.\r\n\r\nWearily the days dragged themselves into weeks, and still no word of hope\r\ncame to cheer me. There was, however, one incident that gave me much\r\npleasure. On the afternoon before the day set for our execution Donald Roy\r\nmade his escape. Some one had given him a file and he had been tinkering\r\nat his irons for days. We were in the yard for our period of exercise, and\r\nhalf a dozen of us, pretending to be in earnest conversation together,\r\nsurrounded him while he snapped the irons. Some days before this time he\r\nhad asked permission to wear the English dress, and he now coolly\r\nsauntered out of the prison with some of the visitors quite unnoticed by\r\nthe guard.\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned on which nine of us were to be executed. Our coffee was\r\nserved to us in the room off the yard, and we drank it in silence. I\r\nnoticed gladly that Macdonald was not with us, and from that argued that\r\nhe had not been recaptured.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s wishing him a safe escape from the country," said Creagh.\r\n\r\n"Lucky dog!" murmured Leath, "I hope they won\'t nail him again."\r\n\r\nBrandy was served. Creagh named the toast and we drank it standing.\r\n\r\n"King James!"\r\n\r\nThe governor of the prison bustled in just as the broken glasses shivered\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n"Now gentlemen, if you are quite ready."\r\n\r\nThree sledges waited for us in the yard to draw us to the gallows tree.\r\nThere was no cowardly feeling, but perhaps a little dilatoriness in\r\ngetting into the first sledge. Five minutes might bring a reprieve for any\r\nof us, and to be in the first sledge might mean the difference between\r\nlife and death.\r\n\r\n"Come, gentlemen! If you please! Let us have no more halting," said the\r\ngovernor, irritably.\r\n\r\nCreagh laughed hardily and vaulted into the sledge. "Egad, you\'re right!\r\nWe\'ll try a little haltering for a change."\r\n\r\nMorgan followed him, and I took the third place.\r\n\r\nA rider dismounted at the prison gate.\r\n\r\n"Is there any news for me?" asked one poor fellow eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the sheriff has just come and is waiting for you," jeered one of the\r\nguards with brutal frankness.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow stiffened at once. "Very well. I am ready."\r\n\r\nA heavy rain was falling, but the crowd between the prison and Kennington\r\nCommon was immense. At the time of our trials the mob had treated us in\r\nruffianly fashion, but now we found a respectful silence. The lawyer\r\nMorgan was in an extremely irritable mood. All the way to the Common he\r\npoured into our inattentive ears a tale of woe about how his coffee had\r\nbeen cold that morning. Over and over again he recited to us the legal\r\nprocedure for bringing the matter into the courts with sufficient effect\r\nto have the prison governor removed from his position.\r\n\r\nA messenger with an official document was waiting for us at the gallows.\r\nThe sheriff tore it open. We had all been bearing ourselves boldly enough\r\nI dare say, but at sight of that paper our lips parched, our throats\r\nchoked, and our eyes burned. Some one was to be pardoned or reprieved. But\r\nwho? What a moment! How the horror of it lives in one\'s mind! Leisurely\r\nthe sheriff read the document through, then deliberately went over it\r\nagain while nine hearts stood still. Creagh found the hardihood at that\r\nmoment of intense anxiety to complain of the rope about his neck.\r\n\r\n"I wish the gossoon who made this halter was to be hanged in it. \'Slife,\r\nthe thing doesn\'t fit by a mile," he said jauntily.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Anthony Creagh pardoned, Mr. Kenneth Montagu reprieved," said the\r\nsheriff without a trace of feeling in his voice.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the world swam dizzily before me. I closed my eyes, partly\r\nfrom faintness, partly to hide from the other poor fellows the joy that\r\nleaped to them. One by one the brave lads came up and shook hands with\r\nCreagh and me in congratulation. Their good-will took me by the throat,\r\nand I could only wring their hands in silence.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the prison Creagh turned to me with streaming eyes. "Do\r\nyou know whom I have to thank for this, Kenneth?"\r\n\r\n"No. Whom?"\r\n\r\n"Antoinette Westerleigh, God bless her dear heart!"\r\n\r\nAnd that set me wondering. It might be that Charles and Aileen alone had\r\nwon my reprieve for me, but I suspected Volney\'s fine hand in the matter.\r\nWhether he had stirred himself in my affairs or not, I knew that I too\r\nowed my life none the less to the leal heart of a girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nVOLNEY\'S GUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the London beaux not one had apartments more elegant than Sir\r\nRobert Volney.[3] It was one of the man\'s vanities to play the part of a\r\nfop, to disguise his restless force and eager brain beneath the vapid\r\npunctilios of a man of fashion. There were few suspected that his reckless\r\ngayety was but a mask to hide a weary, unsatisfied heart, and that this\r\nsmiling debonair gentleman with the biting wit was in truth the least\r\nhappy of men. Long he had played his chosen r\xc3\xb4le. Often he doubted whether\r\nthe game were worth the candle, but he knew that he would play it to the\r\nend, and since he had so elected would bear himself so that all men should\r\nmark him. If life were not what the boy Robert Volney had conceived it; if\r\nfailure were inevitable and even the fruit of achievement bitter; if his\r\nnature and its enveloping circumstance had proven more strong than his\r\ndim, fast-fading, boyish ideals, at least he could cross the stage\r\ngracefully and bow himself off with a jest. So much he owed himself and so\r\nmuch he would pay.\r\n\r\nSomething of all this perhaps was in Sir Robert Volney\'s mind as he lay on\r\nthe couch with dreamy eyes cast back into the yesterdays of life, that dim\r\npast which echoed faintly back to him memories of a brave vanished youth.\r\nOn his lips, no doubt, played the half ironic, half wistful smile which\r\nhad become habitual to the man.\r\n\r\nAnd while with half-shut eyes his mind drifted lazily back to that golden\r\nage forever gone, enter from the inner room, Captain Donald Roy Macdonald,\r\na cocked pistol in his hand, on his head Volney\'s hat and wig, on his back\r\nVolney\'s coat, on his feet Volney\'s boots. The baronet eyed the Highlander\r\nwith mild astonishment, then rose to his feet and offered him a chair.\r\n\r\n"Delighted, I\'m sure," he said politely.\r\n\r\n"You look it," drolled Macdonald.\r\n\r\n"Off to the wars again, or are you still at your old profession of\r\nlifting, my Highland cateran?"\r\n\r\nDonald shrugged. "I am a man of many trades. In my day I have been\r\nsoldier, sailor, reiver, hunter and hunted, doctor and patient, forby a\r\nwheen mair. What the gods provide I take."\r\n\r\n"Hm! So I see. Prithee, make yourself at home," was Volney\'s ironical\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nMacdonald fell into an attitude before the glass and admired himself\r\nvastly.\r\n\r\n"Fegs, I will that. The small-clothes now-- Are they not an admirable fit\r\nwhatever? And the coat-- \'Tis my measure to a nicety. Let me congratulate\r\nyou on your tailor. Need I say that the periwig is a triumph of the\r\nfriseur\'s art?"\r\n\r\n"Your approval flatters me immensely," murmured Volney, smiling\r\nwhimsically. "Faith, I never liked my clothes so well as now. You make an\r\nadmirable setting for them, Captain, but the ruffles are somewhat in\r\ndisarray. If you will permit me to ring for my valet Watkins he will be at\r\nyour service. Devil take him, he should have been here an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"He sends by me a thousand excuses for his absence. The fact is that he is\r\nunavoidably detained."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me. I begin to understand. You doubtless found it necessary to put\r\na quietus on him. May one be permitted to hope that you didn\'t have to\r\npistol him? I should miss him vastly. He is the best valet in London."\r\n\r\n"Your unselfish attachment to him does you infinite credit, Sir Robert. It\r\nfair brings the water to my een. But it joys me to reassure you at all\r\nevents. He is in your bedroom tied hand and foot, biting on a knotted\r\nkerchief. I persuaded him to take a rest."\r\n\r\nVolney laughed.\r\n\r\n"Your powers of persuasion are great, Captain Macdonald. Once you\r\npersuaded me to leave your northern capital. The air, I think you phrased\r\nit, was too biting for me. London too has a climate of its own, a throat\r\ndisease epidemic among northerners is working great havoc here now. One\r\ntrusts you will not fall a victim, sir. Have you--er--developed any\r\nsymptoms?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twould nae doubt grieve you sair. You\'ll be gey glad to learn that the\r\ncrisis is past."\r\n\r\n"Charmed, \'pon honour. And would it be indiscreet to ask whether you are\r\nmaking a long stay in the city?"\r\n\r\n"Faith, I wish I knew. Donald Roy wad be blithe to answer no. And that\r\nminds me that I will be owing you an apology for intruding in your rooms.\r\nLet the facts speak for me. Stravaiging through the streets with the chase\r\nhot on my heels, your open window invited me. I stepped in, footed it\r\nup-stairs, and found refuge in your sleeping apartments, where I took the\r\nliberty of borrowing a change of clothes, mine being over well known at\r\nthe New Prison. So too I purloined this good sword and the pistol. That\r\nSir Robert Volney was my host I did not know till I chanced on some\r\nletters addressed to that name. Believe me, I\'m unco sorry to force myself\r\nupon you."\r\n\r\n"I felicitate myself on having you as a guest. The vapours had me by the\r\nthroat to-night. Your presence is a sufficing tonic for a most oppressive\r\nattack of the blue devils. This armchair has been recommended as an easy\r\none. Pray occupy it."\r\n\r\nCaptain Roy tossed the pistol on a table and sat him down in the chair\r\nwith much composure. Volney poured him wine and he drank; offered him\r\nfruit and he ate. Together, gazing into the glowing coals, they supped\r\ntheir mulled claret in a luxurious silence.\r\n\r\nThe Highlander was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a geyan queer warld this. _Anjour d\'hui roi, demain rien._ Yestreen\r\nI gaped away the hours in a vile hole waiting for my craig (neck) to be\r\nraxed (twisted); the night I drink old claret in the best of company\r\nbefore a cheery fire. The warm glow of it goes to my heart after that dank\r\ncell in the prison. By heaven, the memory of that dungeon sends a shiver\r\ndown my spine."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, was it not, that you were to journey to Tyburn and from thence\r\nacross the Styx?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to-morrow, and with me as pretty a lot of lads as ever threw steel\r\nacross their hurdies. My heart is wae for them, the leal comrades who have\r\nlain out with me in the heather many a night and watched the stars come\r\nout. There\'s Montagu and Creagh now! We three have tholed together empty\r\nwame and niddering cold and the weariness o\' death. The hurly o\' the\r\nwhistling claymore has warmed our hearts; the sight of friends stark from\r\nlead and steel and rope has garred them rin like water. God, it makes me\r\nfeel like a deserter to let them take the lang journey alane. Did you ken\r\nthat the lad came back to get me from the field when I was wounded at\r\nDrummossie Moor?"\r\n\r\n"Montagu? I never heard that."\r\n\r\n"Took his life in his hand to come back to that de\'il\'s caldron where the\r\nred bluid ran like a mountain burn. It iss the boast of the Macdonalds\r\nthat they always pay their debts both to friend and foe. Fine have I paid\r\nmine. He will be thinking me the true friend in his hour of need,"\r\nfinished Donald bitterly.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know him. The temper of the man is not so grudging. His joy in\r\nyour escape will help deaden his own pain. Besides, what could you do for\r\nhim if you were with him at the end? \'Twould be only one more sacrifice."\r\n\r\nThe grim dour Highland sternness hung heavy on Donald\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I could stand shoulder to shoulder with him and curse the whigs at all\r\nevents. I could cry with him \'God save King James\' in the teeth of the\r\nsidier roy."\r\n\r\nVolney clapped his hands softly. "Hear, hear!" he cried with flaming eyes.\r\n"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Jacobite."\r\n\r\nThe Gael turned to him impetuously, his blue eyes (as I conceive) moist\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\n"Man, could I persuade you to be saving the lad? It was for this that I\r\nwaited in your rooms to see you. They say that you are a favourite of\r\nprinces, that what you ask you get. Do for once a fine thing and ask this\r\nboy\'s life."\r\n\r\n"They exaggerate my power. But for argument\'s sake suppose it true. Why\r\nshould I ask it? What have I to gain by it?"\r\n\r\nVolney, his eyes fixed on the fire, asked the question as much to himself\r\nas to the Highlander. The manner of his tone suggested that it was not a\r\nnew one to him.\r\n\r\n"Gain! Who spoke of gain? Are you a Jew peddler or an English gentleman?"\r\ncried Donald.\r\n\r\n"They call me dissolute, gambler, profligate. These be hard names, but I\r\nhave earned them all. I make no apologies and offer no excuses. As I have\r\nlived my life, so have I lived it. For buttered phrases I have no taste.\r\nCall me libertine, or call me man of fashion; \'tis all one. My evil\r\nnature--_C\'est plus fort que moi_. At least I have not played the\r\nhypocrite. No canting sighs! No lapses to morality and prayers! No vices\r\nsmugly hidden! The plain straight road to hell taken at a gallop!" So,\r\nwith chin in hand and dark eyes lit by the flickering flame, this rou\xc3\xa9 and\r\nsentimentalist philosophized.\r\n\r\n"And Montagu?" cried the Gael, harking back to his prosaic text.\r\n\r\n"Has made his bed and he must lie in it."\r\n\r\n"By Heaven, who ruined him and made an outlaw of him? Who drove him to\r\nrebellion?"\r\n\r\n"You imply that I strewed his bed with nettles. Perhaps. \'Tis well my\r\nshoulders are broad, else they could not bear all that is laid upon\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"You would never be letting a petty private grudge influence you?"\r\n\r\nVolney turned, stung to the quick.\r\n\r\n"You go too far, Captain Macdonald. Have I given bonds to save this fool\r\nfrom the consequences of his folly? I cherish no hatred toward him, but I\r\nplay no Jonathan to his David. Egad, it were a pretty r\xc3\xb4le for me to\r\nessay! You would cast me for a part full of heroics, the moving of heaven\r\nand earth to save my dearest enemy. Thank you, I am not for it. Neither\r\nfor nor against him will I lift a hand. There is no malice in my heart\r\ntoward this poor condemned young gentleman. If he can win free I shall be\r\nglad, even though his gain is my loss, but further than that I will not\r\ngo. He came between me and the thing I most desired on earth. Shall I help\r\nhim to the happiness which will condemn me to misery?"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the habitual veil of mockery was snatched aside and the\r\ntortured soul of the man leaped from his burning eyes.\r\n\r\n"You saved him at Portree," was all that Donald could say.\r\n\r\n"I paid a debt to him and to Cumberland. The ledger is now balanced."\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite paced up and down the room for a minute, then stopped and\r\ntouched the other on his shoulder where he sat.\r\n\r\n"I too am somewhat in your debt, Sir Robert. When Montagu opposed you he\r\nfought for his own hand. Therein he was justified. But I, an outsider,\r\ninterfered in a quarrel that was not mine own, spoiled sport for you, in\r\nshort lost you the lassie. You followed her to Scotland; \'twas I that\r\ndrove you back to England when Montagu was powerless. From first to last I\r\nam the rock on which your love bark has split. If your cause has spelled\r\nfailure I alone am to blame."\r\n\r\n"So? What then?"\r\n\r\n"Why this: without Captain Donald Roy Macdonald the lad had been helpless.\r\nDonald was at his back to whisper words of advice and encouragement.\r\nDonald contrived the plot which separated you from the lady. Donald stood\r\ngood fairy to the blessed pair of bairns and made of himsel\' a\r\nmatch-making auld mither. You owe your hatred to Donald Roy and not to the\r\nlad who was but his instrument."\r\n\r\nThe macaroni looked at the other with an odd smile twitching at the\r\ncorners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"And so?"\r\n\r\n"And so," continued the Macdonald triumphantly, a challenge in his voice\r\nand manner, "and so, who but Donald should be your enemy? My certes, a\r\nprettier foe at the broadsword you will not find in a\' Scotland."\r\n\r\n"I do not quite take your meaning. Would you fight with me?"\r\n\r\n"Blithe would I be to cross the steel with you, but little that would help\r\nKenneth. My plan is this: save the lad from the halter and I will tak\' his\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"You mean that if I compass his freedom you will surrender to be\r\nexecuted?"\r\n\r\n"I am meaning just that."\r\n\r\n"I thought so from the first. \'Slife, man, do you think I can change my\r\nfoes like gloves? _Chacun paie son \xc3\xa9cot._"\r\n\r\n"Why not? Iss not a man a better foe than a halfling boy?"\r\n\r\n"I would never seek a better foe or a better friend than either you or\r\nMontagu, Captain. On my soul, you have both the true ring. But as to your\r\noffer I must decline it. The thing is one of your wild impracticable\r\nHighland imaginings, a sheer impossibility. You seem to think I have a\r\nblood feud and that nothing less than a foeman\'s life will satisfy me. In\r\nthat you err. I am a plain man of the world and cannot reach your\r\nheroics."\r\n\r\nThe Jacobite\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"You are going to let the boy die then?"\r\n\r\nVolney hesitated, then answered with a shrug.\r\n\r\n"I shall be frank with you. To-day I secured Montagu a reprieve for two\r\nweeks. He shall have his chance such as it is, but I do not expect him to\r\ntake it. If he shows stubborn I wash my hands of him. I have said the last\r\nword. You may talk till Yule without changing my mind." Then, with an\r\nabrupt turn of the subject: "Have you with you the sinews of war, Captain?\r\nYou will need money to effect your escape. My purse is at your service not\r\nless than my wardrobe, or if you care to lie hidden here for a time you\r\nwill be quite safe. Watkins is a faithful fellow and devoted to me."\r\n\r\nThe Highlander flushed, stammering out:\r\n\r\n"For your proffered loan, I accept it with the best will in the world; and\r\nas to your offer of a hiding-place, troth! I\'m badly needing one. Gin it\r\nwere no inconvenience----"\r\n\r\n"None in the world."\r\n\r\n"I will be remembering you for a generous foe till the day of my death.\r\nYou\'re a man to ride the water wi\'."\r\n\r\n"Lard! There\'s no generosity in it. Every Mohawk thinks it a pleasure to\r\nhelp any man break the laws. Besides, I count on you to help drive away\r\nthe doldrums. Do you care for a hand at piquet now, Captain?"\r\n\r\n"With pleasure. I find in the cartes great diversion, but by your leave\r\nI\'ll first unloose your man Watkins."\r\n\r\n"\'Slife, I had forgot him. We\'ll have him brew us a punch and make a night\r\nof it. Sleep and I are a thousand miles apart."\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [3]  The material for this chapter was furnished me with great\r\n      particularity by Captain Donald Roy Macdonald. From his narrative\r\n      to me, I set down the story in substance as he told it. --K. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came to me one day a surprise, a marked hour among my weeks struck\r\ncalm. Charles, Cloe, and Aileen had been wont to visit me regularly; once\r\nSelwyn had dropped in on me; but I had not before been honoured by a visit\r\nfrom Sir Robert Volney. He sauntered into my cell swinging a clouded cane,\r\ndressed to kill and point device in every ruffle, all dabbed with scented\r\npowder, pomatum, and jessamine water. To him, coming direct from the\r\nstrong light of the sun, my cell was dark as the inside of Jonah\'s whale.\r\nHe stood hesitating in the doorway, groping with his cane for some guide\r\nto his footsteps.\r\n\r\nFor an instant I drew back, thinking he had come to mock me; then I put\r\nthe idea from me. However much of evil there was in him, Volney was not a\r\nsmall man. I stepped forward to greet him.\r\n\r\n"Welcome to my poor best, Sir Robert! If I do not offer you a chair it is\r\nbecause I have none. My regret is that my circumstances hamper my\r\nhospitality."\r\n\r\n"Not at all. You offer me your best, and in that lies the essence of\r\nhospitality. Better a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and\r\nhatred, Egad," returned my guest with easy irony.\r\n\r\nAll the resources of the courtier and the beau were his. One could but\r\nadmire the sparkle and the versatility of the man. His wit was brilliant\r\nas the play of a rapier\'s point. Set down in cold blood, remembered\r\nscantily and clumsily as I recall it, without the gay easy polish of his\r\nmanner, the fineness is all out of his talk. After all \'tis a\r\ncharacteristic of much wit that it is apposite to the occasion only and\r\nloses point in the retelling.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself on the table with a leg dangling in air and looked\r\ncuriously around on the massive masonry, the damp floor, the walls oozing\r\nslime. I followed his eye and in some measure his thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Stone walls do not a prison make," I quoted gaily.\r\n\r\n"Ecod, they make a pretty fair imitation of one!" he chuckled.\r\n\r\nI was prodigious glad to see him.\r\n\r\nHis presence stirred my sluggish blood. The sound of his voice was to me\r\nlike the crack of a whip to a jaded horse. Graceful, careless, debonair, a\r\nman of evil from sheer reckless wilfulness, he was the one person in the\r\nworld I found it in my heart to both hate and admire at the same time.\r\n\r\nHe gazed long at me. "You\'re looking devilish ill, Montagu," he said.\r\n\r\nI smiled. "Are you afraid I\'ll cheat the hangman after all?"\r\n\r\nHis eyes wandered over the cell again. "By Heaven, this death\'s cage is\r\nenough to send any man off the hooks," he shivered.\r\n\r\n"One gets used to it," I answered, shrugging.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a kind of admiration. "They may break you, Montagu,\r\nbut I vow they will never bend you. Here are you torn with illness, the\r\nshadow of the gallows falling across your track, and never a whimper out\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"Would that avail to better my condition?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. Still, self-pity is the very ecstasy of grief, they tell\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"For girls and halfling boys, I dare say."\r\n\r\nThere he sat cocked on the table, a picture of smiling ease, raffish and\r\nfascinating, as full of sentimental sympathy as a lass in her teens. His\r\ncommiseration was no less plain to me because it was hidden under a\r\ndebonair manner. He looked at me in a sidelong fashion with a question in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"Speak out!" I told him. "Your interest in me as evidenced by this visit\r\nhas earned the right to satisfy your curiosity."\r\n\r\n"I dare swear you have had your chance to save yourself?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the usual offer! A life for a life, the opportunity to save myself by\r\nbetraying others."\r\n\r\n"Do you never dally with the thought of it?" he questioned.\r\n\r\nI looked up quickly at him. A hundred times I had nursed the temptation\r\nand put it from me.\r\n\r\n"Are you never afraid, Montagu, when the night falls black and slumber is\r\nnot to be wooed?"\r\n\r\n"Many a time," I told him, smiling.\r\n\r\n"You say it as easily as if I had asked whether you ever took the air in\r\nthe park. \'Slife, I have never known you flinch. There was always a\r\ncertain d----d rough plainness about you, but you play the game."\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a poor hound falls whining at the whip when there is no avoiding\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You will never accept their offer of a pardon on those terms. I know you,\r\nman. Y\'are one of those fools hold by honour rather than life, and damme!\r\nI like you for it. Now I in your place----"\r\n\r\n"----Would do as I do."\r\n\r\n"Would I? I\'m not so sure. If I did it would be no virtue, but an\r\nobstinacy not to be browbeat." Then he added, "You would give anything\r\nelse on earth for your life, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Anything else," I told him frankly.\r\n\r\n"Anything else?" he repeated, his eyes narrowing. "No reservations,\r\nMontagu?"\r\n\r\nOur eyes crossed like rapiers, each searching into the other\'s very soul.\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand that you are making me an offer, Sir Robert?"\r\n\r\n"I am making you an offer of your life."\r\n\r\n"Respectfully declined."\r\n\r\n"Think again, man! Once you are dead you will be a long time dead. Refuse\r\nto give her up, and you die; she is not for you in any case. Give way, and\r\nI will move heaven and earth for a pardon. Believe me, never was such\r\nperfect weather before. The birds sing divinely, and Charles tells me\r\nMontagu Grange is sorely needing a master."\r\n\r\n"Charles will look the part to admiration."\r\n\r\n"And doubtless will console himself in true brotherly fashion for the loss\r\nof his brother by reciting his merits on a granite shaft and straightway\r\nforgetting them in the enjoyment of the estate."\r\n\r\n"I think it likely."\r\n\r\nHe looked at me gloomily. "There is a way to save you, despite your\r\nobstinacy."\r\n\r\nI shuffled across to him in a tumult of emotion. "You would never do it,\r\nwould never be so vile as to trade on her fears for me to win her."\r\n\r\n"I would do anything to win her, and I would do a great deal to save your\r\nlife. The two things jump together. In a way I like you, man."\r\n\r\nBut I would have none of his liking. "Oh, spare me that! You are the most\r\nsentimental villain unhung, and I can get along without your liking."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be," said he laughing, "but I cannot well get along without\r\nyou. On my honour, you have become one of my greatest sources of\r\ninterest."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you would stake my life against her hand?" I demanded\r\nwhitely.\r\n\r\nHe gave me look for look. "I mean just that. By Heaven, I shall win her\r\nfair or foul."\r\n\r\nI could only keep saying over and over again, "You would never do it. Even\r\nyou would never do that."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t I? You\'ll see," he answered laughing hardily. "Well, I must be\r\ngoing. Oh, I had forgot. Balmerino sent you this note. I called on him\r\nyesterday at the Tower. The old Scotchman is still as full of smiles as a\r\nbride."\r\n\r\nBalmerino\'s letter was the friendliest imaginable. He stated that for him\r\na pardon was of course out of the question, but that Sir Robert Volney had\r\nassured him that there was a chance for me on certain conditions; he\r\nunderstood that the conditions had to do with the hand of a young woman,\r\nand he advised me, if the thing were consistent with honour, to make\r\nsubmission, and let no foolish pride stand in the way of saving my life.\r\nThe letter ended with a touching reference to the cause for which he was\r\nabout to die.\r\n\r\nI was shaken, I confess it. Not that I thought for a moment of giving up\r\nmy love, but my heart ached to think of the cruel position into which she\r\nwould be cast. To save her lover\'s life, she must forsake her love, or if\r\nshe elected the other alternative must send him to his death. That Volney\r\nwould let this burden of choice fall on her I would scarce let myself\r\nbelieve; and yet--there was never a man more madly, hopelessly in love\r\nthan he. His passion for her was like a whirlwind tossing him hither and\r\nthither like a chip on the boiling waters, but I thought it very\r\ncharacteristic of the man that he used his influence to have me moved to a\r\nmore comfortable cell and supplied with delicacies, even while he plotted\r\nagainst me with my love.\r\n\r\nAfter that first visit he used to come often and entertain me with the\r\nnews and gossip of the town. I have never met a more interesting man. He\r\nwas an onlooker of life rather than an actor, an ironical cynic, chuckling\r\nwith sardonic humour. The secret of his charm lay perhaps in a certain\r\nwhimsical outlook and in an original turn of mind.\r\n\r\nOnce I asked him why he found it worth while to spend so many hours with\r\nme when his society was so much sought after by the gayest circle in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n"I acquit you of any suspicion of philanthropy, Sir Robert. I give you\r\ncredit for pursuing a policy of intelligent selfishness. You must know by\r\nthis time that I will not purchase my life, nor let it be purchased, on\r\nthe terms which you propose. Well then, I confess it puzzles me to guess\r\nwhat amusement you find in such a hole as this."\r\n\r\n"Variety spices life. What\'s a man to do to keep himself from ennui? For\r\ninstance, I got up this morning at ten, with Selwyn visited Lady Dapperwit\r\nwhile she was drinking coffee in her nightrail, talked a vast deal of\r\nscandal with her, strolled in the park with Fritz, from there to White\'s\r\nin a sedan, two hours at lunch, and an hour with you for the good of my\r\nsoul."\r\n\r\n"The good of your soul?" I quizzed.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I visit you here and then go away deuced thankful for my mercies.\r\nI\'m not to be hanged next week, you know. I live to marry the girl."\r\n\r\n"Still, I should think you might find more interesting spots than this."\r\n\r\n"I am a student of human nature, Montagu."\r\n\r\n"A condemned prisoner, never a wit at the best of times, full of fears and\r\nagues and fevers! One would scarce think the subject an inviting one for\r\nstudy."\r\n\r\n"There you do yourself injustice. Y\'are the most interesting man I know. A\r\ndozen characters are wrapped up in you. You have the appearance of being\r\nas great a rip as the rest of us, and I vow your looks do not belie you,\r\nyet at times you have the conscience of a ranting dissenter. I find in you\r\na touch both of Selwyn\'s dry wit and of Balmerino\'s frostly bluntness; the\r\ncool daring of James Wolfe combined with as great a love of life as Murray\r\nhas shown; the chivalry of Don Quixote and the hard-headedness of\r\nCumberland; sometimes an awkward boy, again the grand manner Chesterfield\r\nhimself might envy you; the obstinacy of the devil and----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come!" I broke in laughing. "I don\'t mind being made a composite\r\nepitome of all the vices of the race, but I object to your crossing the\r\nStyx on my behalf."\r\n\r\n"And that reminds me of the time we came so near crossing together," he\r\nbroke out, diverting the subject in his inconsequent fashion. "D\'ye\r\nremember that Dr. Mead who dressed our wounds for us after our little\r\nargument? It appears that he and a Dr. Woodward fell into some\r\nprofessional dispute as to how a case should be treated, and Lud! nothing\r\nwould satisfy them but they must get their toasting forks into action. The\r\nstory goes that they fought at the gate of Gresham College. Mead pinked\r\nhis man. \'Take your life,\' quoth he. \'Anything but your medicine,\' returns\r\nWoodward just before he faints. Horry Walpole told me the story. I suppose\r\nyou have heard Selwyn\'s story of Lord Wharton. You know what a spendthrift\r\nWharton is. Well the Duke of Graftsbury offered him one of his daughters\r\nin marriage, a lady of uncertain age and certain temper. But the lady has\r\none virtue; she\'s a devilish fine fortune. A plum, they say! Wharton wrote\r\nGraftsbury a note of three lines declining the alliance because, as he put\r\nit, the fortune was tied up and the lady wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Not bad. Talking of Selwyn, I suppose he gets his fill of horrors these\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"One would think he might. I met him at the Prince\'s dinner yesterday, and\r\nbetween us we two emptied nine bottles of maraschino. Conceive the\r\nsplitting headache I\'m wearing to-day."\r\n\r\n"You should take a course in Jacobitism," I told him gravely. "\'Tis\r\nwarranted to cure gout, liver trouble, indigestion, drunkenness, and\r\nsundry other complaints. I can warrant that one lives simply while he\r\ntakes the treatment; sometimes on a crust of bread and a bowl of brose,\r\nsometimes on water from the burn, never does one dine over-richly."\r\n\r\n"Yet this course is not conducive to long life. I\'ve known a hundred\r\nfollowers of it fall victim to an epidemic throat disease," he retorted.\r\nThen he added more gravely, "By the way, you need have no fears for your\r\nfriend Miss Flora Macdonald. I learn on the best of authority that she is\r\nin no danger whatever."\r\n\r\n"And Malcolm?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"His name has been put near the foot of the list for trial. Long before\r\nthat time the lust for blood will be glutted. I shall make it a point to\r\nsee that his case never comes to trial. One cannot afford to have his\r\nbrother-in-law hanged like a common cutpurse."\r\n\r\nDay by day the time drew nearer on which my reprieve expired. I saw\r\nnothing of Aileen now, for she had followed the King and his court to\r\nBath, intent on losing no opportunity that might present itself in my\r\nfavour. For one reason I was glad to have her gone; so long as she was out\r\nof town Sir Robert could not urge on her the sacrifice which he intended.\r\n\r\nThe time of my execution had been set for Friday, and on the preceding\r\nMonday Volney, just arrived from the executions of Balmerino and\r\nKilmarnock, drove out to New Prison to see me. He was full of admiration\r\nfor Balmerino\'s bold exit from the stage of life and retailed to me with\r\ngreat gusto every incident of the last scene on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n"I like your bluff Balmerino\'s philosophy of life," he told me. "When I\r\ncalled on him and apologized for intruding on the short time he had left\r\nthe old Lord said, \'O sir, no intrusion at all. I am in no ways concerned\r\nto spend more time than usual at my devotions. I think no man fit to live\r\nwho is not fit to die, and to die well is much the easier of the two.\' On\r\nthe scaffold no bridegroom could have been more cheerful. He was dressed\r\nin his old blue campaign uniform and was as bold and manly as ever. He\r\nexpressed joy that Cromartie had been pardoned, inspected with interest\r\nthe inscription on his coffin, and smilingly called the block his pillow\r\nof rest. \'Pon honour, the intrepid man then rehearsed the execution with\r\nhis headsman, kneeling down at the block to show how he would give the\r\nsignal for the blow. He then got up again, made a tender smiling farewell\r\nwith his friends, and said to me, \'I fear some will think my behaviour\r\nbold, Volney, but remember what I say, that it arises from confidence in\r\nGod and a clear conscience.\' He reaffirmed his unshaken adherence to the\r\nhouse of Stuart, crying aloud, \'God save King James!\' and bowed to the\r\nmultitude. Presently, still cheerfully, he knelt at the block and said in\r\na clear voice, \'O Lord, reward my friends, forgive my enemies, bless\r\nPrince Charles and his brother, the Duke, and receive my soul.\' His arms\r\ndropped for the signal, and Arthur Elphinstone of Balmerino passed to the\r\nValhalla where brave men dwell as gods."\r\n\r\n"God bring peace to his valiant restless soul," I said, much moved.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis a thing to admire, the sturdy loyalty of you Jacobites," he said\r\nafter a pause. "You carry it off like gentlemen. Every poor Highlander who\r\nhas yet suffered has flung out his \'God save King James\' on the scaffold.\r\nNow I\'ll wager you too go to death with the grand air--no canting prayers\r\nfor King George, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I must e\'en do as the rest," I smiled.\r\n\r\n"Yet I\'d bet a pony you don\'t care a pinch of snuff for James Stuart. \'Tis\r\nloyalty to yourselves that animates you."\r\n\r\nPresently he harked back to the topic that was never closed between us.\r\n\r\n"By this time next week you will have touched the heart of our eternal\r\nproblem. The mystery of it will perhaps be all clear to you then. \'Tis\r\nmost strange how at one sweep all a man\'s turbulent questing life passes\r\ninto the quiet of--of what? That is the question: of unending death or of\r\nachieved knowledge?" Then he added, coming abruptly to the issue: "The day\r\ndraws near. Do you think better of my offer now?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert, I have lived a tempestuous life these past months. I have\r\nknown hunger and cold and weariness; I have been at the top of fortune\'s\r\nwave and at the bottom; but I have never found it worth my while to become\r\ndivorced from honour. You find me near dead from privations and disease.\r\nDo you think I would pay so much for such an existence? Believe me, when a\r\nman has passed through what I have he is empty of fears."\r\n\r\n"I could better spare a better man," he said.\r\n\r\n"Sorry to inconvenience you," I told him grimly.\r\n\r\n"I\' faith, I think you\'re destined to do that dead or alive."\r\n\r\n"I think I am. You will find me more in your way dead than alive."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll outlive your memory, never fear." Then quietly, after a moment\'s\r\nhesitation: "There\'s one thing it may be a comfort for you to know. I\'ve\r\ngiven up any thought of putting her on the rack. I\'ll win fairly or not at\r\nall."\r\n\r\nI drew a deep free breath. "Thank you for telling me."\r\n\r\n"I mean to marry her though. I swear to you, Montagu, that my heart is\r\nwrapped up in her. I thought all women alike until I met this one. Now I\r\nknow better. She could have made a different man of me; sometimes I think\r\nshe could even yet. I vow to you I would not now injure a hair of her\r\nhead, but willy-nilly, in the end I shall marry the girl."\r\n\r\n"To ruin her life?"\r\n\r\n"To save mine rather."\r\n\r\n"Do you think yourself able to change the whole course of your life for\r\nher?"\r\n\r\nHe mused. "Ah, Montagu! There your finger falls pat on the pulse of my\r\ndoubt. My heart cries aye, my reason gives a negative."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry overmuch about it," I answered, railing at him. "She\'ll never\r\nlook at you, man. My grave will be an insurmountable barrier. She will\r\nidealize my memory, think me a martyr and herself a widowed maid."\r\n\r\nThe shot scored. \'Twas plain he must have often thought of that himself.\r\n\r\n"It may interest you to know that we are engaged to be married," I added.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Let me congratulate you. When does the happy event occur, may I\r\nask? Or is the day set?"\r\n\r\nHe had no need to put into words more clearly the irony of the fate that\r\nencompassed us.\r\n\r\n"Dead or alive, as you say, I bar your way," I said tartly.\r\n\r\n"Pooh, man! I give you six weeks of violent grief, six months of tender\r\nmelancholy."\r\n\r\n"You do not know the Scotch. She will die a maid," I answered.\r\n\r\n"Not she! A live lover is more present than a dead one. Has she sworn\r\npretty vows to you, Montagu? \'At lovers\' perjuries, they say, love\r\nlaughs.\' Is there nothing to be said for me? Will her heart not always\r\nwhisper that I deserve gratitude and love, that I perilled my life for\r\nher, saved the lives of her brother and her lover, neither of them friends\r\nof mine, again reprieved her lover\'s life, stood friend to her through all\r\nher trouble? You know a woman\'s way--to make much of nothing."\r\n\r\n"Forgive, if I prod a lagging memory, Miss Westerleigh?"\r\n\r\nLong he laughed and merrily.\r\n\r\n"Eloped for Gretna Green with Tony Creagh last night, and I, poor forsaken\r\nswain, faith! I do not pursue."\r\n\r\nYou may be sure that dashed me. I felt as a trapped fox with the dogs\r\nclosing in. The future loomed up clear before me, Aileen hand in hand with\r\nVolney scattering flowers on my grave in sentimental mood. The futility of\r\nmy obstinacy made me bitter.\r\n\r\n"Come, Montagu! Listen to reason," urged the tempter. "You get in my way,\r\nbut I don\'t want to let you be sponged out. The devil of it is that if I\r\nget you a pardon--and I\'m not sure that I can get it--you\'ll marry the\r\ngirl. I might have you shipped to the Barbadoes as a slave with some of\r\nthe others, but to be frank I had rather see you hanged than give you so\r\nscurvy an end. Forswear what is already lost and make an end of it."\r\n\r\nI turned away blackly. "You have my answer. Sir Robert, you have played\r\nyour last card. Now let me die in peace."\r\n\r\nHe shrugged impatiently and left me. "A fool\'s answer, yet a brave man\'s\r\ntoo," he muttered.\r\n\r\nAileen, heart-broken with the failure of her mission, reached town on\r\nThursday and came at once to the prison. Her face was as the face of\r\ntroubled waters. I had no need to ask the question on my lips. With a\r\nsobbing cry she threw herself on my breast. My heart was woe for her.\r\nUtter weariness was in her manner. All through the long days and nights\r\nshe had agonized, and now at last despaired. There seemed no tears left to\r\nshed.\r\n\r\nLong I held her tight, teeth set, as one who would keep his own perforce\r\nfrom that grim fate which would snatch his love from him. She shivered to\r\nme half-swooning, pale and of wondrous beauty, nesting in my arms as a\r\nweary homing-bird. A poignant grief o\'erflowed in me.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aileen! At least we have love left," I cried, breaking the long\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Always! Always!" her white lips answered.\r\n\r\n"Then let us regret nothing. They can do with me what they will. What are\r\nlife and death when in the balance dwells love?" I cried, rapt in\r\nunearthly worship of her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes found mine. "Oh, Kenneth, I cannot--I cannot--let you go."\r\n\r\nSweet and lovely she was beyond the dream of poet. I trembled in an\r\necstasy of pain. From the next cell there came to us softly the voice of a\r\npoor condemned Appin Stewart. He was crooning that most tender and\r\nheart-breaking of all strains. Like the pibroch\'s mournful sough he wailed\r\nit out, the song that cuts deep to a Scotchman\'s heart in time of exile.\r\n\r\n               "Lochabar no more, Lochabar no more.\r\n                 We\'ll maybe return to Lochabar no more."\r\n\r\nI looked at Aileen, my face working. A long breath came whistling through\r\nher lips. Her dear face was all broken with emotion. I turned my eyes\r\naside, not daring to trust myself. Through misty lashes again I looked.\r\nHer breast lifted and fell in shaking sobs, the fount of tears touched at\r\nlast. Together we wept, without shame I admit it, while the Stewart\'s\r\nharrowing strain ebbed to a close. To us it seemed almost as the keening\r\nof the coronach.\r\n\r\nSo in the quiet that comes after storm, her dear supple figure still in my\r\narms, Sir Robert Volney came in unexpectedly and found us. He stopped at\r\nthe door, startled at her presence, and methought a shadow fell on his\r\nface. Near to death as I was, the quality of his courage was so fine and\r\nthe strength of the passion in him so great that he would have changed\r\nplaces with me even then.\r\n\r\nAileen went up to him at once and gave him her hand. She was very simple,\r\nher appeal like a child\'s for directness.\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert, you have already done much for me. I will be so bold as to\r\nask you to do more. Here iss my lover\'s life in danger. I ask you to save\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"That he may marry you?"\r\n\r\n"If God wills."\r\n\r\nVolney looked at her out of a haggard face, all broken by the emotions\r\nwhich stirred him.\r\n\r\nA minute passed, two minutes. He fought out his fight and won.\r\n\r\n"Aileen," he said at last, "before heaven I fear it is too late, but what\r\nman can do, that will I do."\r\n\r\nHe came in and shook hands with me. "I\'ll say good-bye, Montagu. \'Tis\r\npossible I\'ll see you but once more in this world. Yet I will do my best.\r\nDon\'t hope too much, but don\'t despair."\r\n\r\nThere was unconscious prophecy in his words. I was to see him but the once\r\nmore, and then the proud, gallant gentleman, now so full of energy, was\r\nlying on his deathbed struck out of life by a foul blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SHADOW FALLS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Sir Robert went direct from the prison to the club\r\nroom at White\'s. He was observed to be gloomy, preoccupied, his manner not\r\na little perturbed. The usual light smile was completely clouded under a\r\ngravity foreign to his nature. One may guess that he was in no humour to\r\ncarry coals. In a distant corner of the room he seated himself and fell to\r\nfrowning at the table on which his elbow rested. At no time was he a man\r\nupon whom one would be likely to foist his company undesired, for he had\r\nat command on occasion a hauteur and an aloofness that challenged respect\r\neven from the most inconsiderate.\r\n\r\nWe must suppose that he was moved out of his usual indifference, that some\r\nlong-dormant spring of nobility was quickened to a renewed life, that a\r\ngirl\'s truth and purity, refining his selfish passion, had bitten deep\r\ninto the man\'s callous worldliness. For long he sat in a sombre silence\r\nwith his head leaning on his hand, his keen mind busy with the problem--so\r\nI shall always believe--as to how he might even yet save me from the\r\ngallows.\r\n\r\nBy some strange hap it chanced that Sir James Craven, excited with drink,\r\nthe bile of his saturnine temper stirred to malignity by heavy losses at\r\ncards, alighted from his four in hand at White\'s shortly after Volney.\r\nCraven\'s affairs had gone from bad to worse very rapidly of late. He had\r\nbeen playing the races heavily and ruin stared the man in the face. More\r\nthan suspected of dubious play at cards, it had been scarce a week since\r\nthe stewards of a leading racetrack had expelled him for running crosses.\r\nAny day a debtor\'s prison might close on him. Within the hour, as was\r\nafterward learned, his former companion Frederick Prince of Wales had\r\ngiven him the cut direct on the Mall. Plainly his star was on the decline,\r\nand he raged in a futile passion of hatred against the world. Need it be\r\nsaid that of all men he most hated his supplanter in the Prince of Wales\'\r\ngood-will, Sir Robert Volney.\r\n\r\nTo Volney then, sitting gloomily in his distant solitude, came Craven with\r\nmurder in his heart and a bitter jest on his lips. At the other side of\r\nthe table he found a seat and glared across at his rival out of a\r\npassion-contorted face. Sir Robert looked past him coldly, negligently, as\r\nif he had not been there, and rising from his seat moved to the other side\r\nof the room. In the manner of his doing it there was something\r\nindescribably insulting; so it seemed to Topham Beauclerc, who retailed to\r\nme the story later.\r\n\r\nCraven\'s evil glance followed Volney, rage in his bloodshot eyes. If a\r\nlook could kill, the elegant macaroni had been a dead man then. It is to\r\nbe guessed that Craven struggled with his temper and found himself not\r\nstrong enough to put a curb upon it; that his heady stress of passion\r\nswept away his fear of Volney\'s sword. At all events there he sat\r\nglowering blackly on the man at whose charge he chose to lay all his\r\nmisfortunes, what time he gulped down like water glass after glass of\r\nbrandy. Presently he got to his feet and followed Sir Robert, still\r\ndallying no doubt with the fascinating temptation of fixing a quarrel upon\r\nhis rival and killing him. To do him justice Volney endeavoured to avoid\r\nan open rupture with the man. He appeared buried in the paper he was\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n"What news?" asked Craven abruptly.\r\n\r\nFor answer the other laid down the paper, so that Sir James could pick it\r\nup if he chose.\r\n\r\n"I see your old rival Montagu is to dance on air to-morrow. \'Gad, you\'ll\r\nhave it all your own way with the wench then," continued Craven\r\nboisterously, the liquor fast mounting to his head.\r\n\r\nVolney\'s eyes grew steelly. He would have left, but the burly purple-faced\r\nbaronet cut off his retreat.\r\n\r\n"Damme, will you drink with me, or will you play with me, Volney?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, but I never drink nor play at this time of day, Sir James. If it\r\nwill not inconvenience you to let me pass----"\r\n\r\nWith a foolish laugh, beside himself with rage and drink, Craven flung him\r\nback into his chair. "\'Sdeath, don\'t be in such a hurry! I want to talk to\r\nyou about-- Devil take it, what is it I want to talk about?-- Oh, yes! That\r\npink and white baggage of yours. Stap me, the one look ravished me! Pity\r\nyou let a slip of a lad like Montagu oust you."\r\n\r\n"That subject is one which we will not discuss, Sir James," said Volney\r\nquietly. "It is not to be mentioned in my presence."\r\n\r\n"The devil it isn\'t. I\'m not in the habit of asking what I may talk about.\r\nAs for this mistress of yours----"\r\n\r\nSir Robert rose and stood very straight. "I have the honour to inform you\r\nthat you are talking of a lady who is as pure as the driven snow."\r\n\r\nBuck Craven stared. "After Sir Robert Volney has pursued her a year?" he\r\nasked with venomous spleen, his noisy laugh echoing through the room.\r\n\r\nI can imagine how the fellow said it, with what a devilish concentration\r\nof malice. He had the most irritating manner of any man in England; I\r\nnever heard him speak without wanting to dash my fist in his sneering\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"That is what I tell you. I repeat that the subject is not a matter for\r\ndiscussion between us."\r\n\r\nCraven might have read a warning in the studied gentleness of Volney\'s\r\ncold manner, but he was by this time far beyond reck. By common consent\r\nthe eyes of every man in the room were turned on these two, and Craven\'s\r\nvanity sunned itself at holding once more the centre of the stage.\r\n\r\n"And after the trull has gadded about the country with young Montagu in\r\nall manner of disguises?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"You lie, you hound!"\r\n\r\nSir James sputtered in a speechless paroxysm of passion, found words at\r\nlast and poured them out in a turbid torrent of invective. He let fall the\r\nword baggage again, and presently, growing more plain, a word that is not\r\nto be spoken of an honest woman. Volney, eyeing him disdainfully, the\r\nman\'s coarse bulk, his purple cheeks and fishy eyes, played with his wine\r\ngoblet, white fingers twisting at the stem; then, when the measure of the\r\nfellow\'s offense was full, put a period to his foul eloquence.\r\n\r\nFull in the mouth the goblet struck him. Blood spurted from his lips, and\r\na shower of broken glass shivered to the ground. Craven leaped across the\r\ntable at his enemy in a blind fury; restrained by the united efforts of\r\nhalf a dozen club members, the struggling madman still foamed to get at\r\nhis rival\'s throat--that rival whose disdainful eyes seemed to count him\r\nbut a mad dog impotent to bite.\r\n\r\n"You would not drink with me; you would not play with me; but, by God, you\r\nwill have to fight with me," he cried at last.\r\n\r\n"When you please."\r\n\r\n"Always I have hated you, wanted always to kill you, now I shall do it,"\r\nhe screamed.\r\n\r\nVolney turned on his heel and beckoned to Beauclerc.\r\n\r\n"Will you act for me, Topham?" he asked; and when the other assented,\r\nadded: "Arrange the affair to come off as soon as possible. I want to have\r\ndone with the thing at once."\r\n\r\nThey fought within the hour in the Field of the Forty Footsteps. The one\r\nwas like fire, the other ice. They were both fine swordsmen, but there was\r\nno man in England could stand against Volney at his best, and those who\r\nwere present have put it on record that Sir Robert\'s skill was this day at\r\nhigh water mark. He fought quite without passion, watching with cool\r\nalertness for his chance to kill. His opponent\'s breath came short, his\r\nthrusts grew wild, the mad rage of the man began to give way to a no less\r\nmad despair. Every feint he found anticipated, every stroke parried; and\r\nstill his enemy held to the defensive with a deadly cold watchfulness that\r\nstruck chill to the heart of the fearful bully. We are to conceive that\r\nCraven tasted the bitterness of death, that in the cold passionless face\r\nopposite to him he read his doom, and that in the horrible agony of terror\r\nthat sweated him he forgot the traditions of his class and the training of\r\na lifetime. He stumbled, and when Sir Robert held his hand, waiting point\r\ngroundward with splendid carelessness for his opponent to rise, Craven\r\nflung himself forward on his knees and thrust low at him. The blade went\r\nhome through the lower vitals.\r\n\r\nVolney stood looking at him a moment with a face of infinite contempt,\r\nthan sank back into the arms of Beauclerc.\r\n\r\nWhile the surgeon was examining the wound Craven stole forward guiltily to\r\nthe outskirts of the little group which surrounded the wounded man. His\r\nhorror-stricken eyes peered out of a face like chalk. The man\'s own second\r\nhad just turned his back on him, and he was already realizing that the\r\nfoul stroke had written on his forehead the brand of Cain, had made him an\r\noutcast and a pariah on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Volney and his murderer met, those of the dying man full of\r\nscorn. Craven\'s glance fell before that steady look. He muttered a hope\r\nthat the wound was but slight; then, in torture, burst out: "\'Twas a slip.\r\nBy Heaven, it was, Volney! I would to God it were undone."\r\n\r\n"\'To every coward safety, and afterward his evil hour,\'" quoted Volney\r\nwith cold disdain.\r\n\r\nThe murderer turned away with a sobbing oath, mounted his horse and rode\r\nfor the coast to begin his lifetime of exile, penury, and execration.\r\n\r\n"Do I get my passport?" asked Sir Robert of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe latter began to talk a jargon of medical terms, but Volney cut him\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n"Enough! I understand," he said quietly. "Get me to my rooms and send at\r\nonce for the Prince of Wales. Beauclerc, may I trouble you to call on\r\nCumberland and get from him an order to bring young Montagu to my place\r\nfrom the prison? And will you send my man Watkins for a lawyer? Oh, and\r\none more commission--a messenger to beg of Miss Macleod her attendance. In\r\ncase she demurs, make it plain to her that I am a dying man. Faith,\r\nTopham, you\'ll be glad I do not die often. I fear I am an unconscionable\r\nnuisance at it."\r\n\r\nTopham Beauclerc drove straight to the residence of the Duke of\r\nCumberland. He found the Duke at home, explained the situation in a few\r\nwords, and presently the pair of them called on the Duke of Newcastle and\r\nsecured his counter-signature for taking me temporarily from the New\r\nPrison. Dusk was falling when Beauclerc and the prison guards led me to\r\nVolney\'s bedroom. At the first glance I saw plainly that he was not long\r\nfor this world. He lay propped on an attendant\'s arm, the beautiful eyes\r\nserene, an inscrutable smile on the colourless lips. Beside him sat\r\nAileen, her hand in his, and on the other side of the bed the Duke of\r\nCumberland and Malcolm. When he saw me his eyes brightened.\r\n\r\n"On time, Kenneth. Thanks for coming."\r\n\r\nBeauclerc had told me the story, and I went forward with misty eyes. He\r\nlooked at me smiling.\r\n\r\n"On my soul I believe you are sorry, Montagu. Yes, I have my quietus. The\r\nfellow struck foul. My own fault! I always knew him for a scoundrel. I had\r\nhim beaten; but \'tis better so perhaps. After all I shall cross the river\r\nbefore you, Kenneth." Then abruptly to an attendant who entered the room,\r\n"Has the Prince come yet?"\r\n\r\n"But this moment, sir."\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales entered the room, and Volney gave him his old winsome\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Hard hit, your Highness!"\r\n\r\n"I trust it is not so bad as they say, Robert."\r\n\r\n"Bad or good, as one looks at it, but this night I go wandering into the\r\ngreat unknown. Enough of this. I sent for you, Fritz, to ask my last\r\nfavour."\r\n\r\nThe face of the stolid Dutchman was all broken with emotion.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis yours, Robert, if the thing is mine to grant."\r\n\r\n"I want Montagu spared. You must get his pardon before I die, else I shall\r\nnot pass easy in mind. This one wrong I must right before the end. \'Twas I\r\ndrove him to rebellion. You will get him pardoned and see to it that his\r\nestates are not confiscated?"\r\n\r\n"I promise to do my best. It shall be attended to."\r\n\r\n"To-day?"\r\n\r\n"This very hour if it can be arranged."\r\n\r\n"And you, Cumberland, will do your share."\r\n\r\nThe Duke nodded, frowning to hide his emotion.\r\n\r\nVolney fell back on the pillows. "Good! Where is the priest?"\r\n\r\nA vicar of the Church of England came forward to offer the usual\r\nministrations to the dying. Volney listened for a minute or two with\r\nclosed eyes, then interrupted gently.\r\n\r\n"Thank you. That will suffice. I\'ll never insult my Maker by fawning for\r\npardon in the fag hour of a misspent life."\r\n\r\n"The mercy of God is without limits----"\r\n\r\n"I hope so. That I shall know better than you within the space of\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. I\'m afraid you mistake your mission here. You came\r\nto marry Antony, not to bury C\xc3\xa6sar." Then, turning to me, he said with a\r\nflare of his old reckless wit: "Any time this six weeks you\'ve been\r\nqualifying for the noose. If you\'re quite ready we\'ll have the obsequies\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nHe put Aileen\'s hand in mine. The vicar married us, the Prince of Wales\r\ngiving away the bride. Aileen\'s pale face was shot with a faint flush, a\r\nsplash of pink in either alabaster cheek. When the priest had made us man\r\nand wife she, who had just married me, leaned forward impulsively and\r\nkissed our former enemy on the forehead. The humorous gleam came back to\r\nhis dulling eyes.\r\n\r\n"Only one, Montagu. I dare say you can spare that. The rest are for a\r\nbetter man. Don\'t cry, Aileen. \'Fore Heaven, \'tis a good quittance for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe looked at the soft warmth and glow of her, now quickened to throbbing\r\nlife, drew a long breath, then smiled and sighed again, her lover even to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nA long silence fell, which Sir Robert broke by saying with a smile, "In\r\ncase Selwyn calls show him up. If I am still alive I\'ll want to see him,\r\nand if I\'m dead he\'ll want to see me. \'Twill interest him vastly."\r\n\r\nOnce more only he spoke. "The shadow falls," he said to Aileen, and\r\npresently dozed fitfully; so slipped gradually into the deeper sleep from\r\nwhich there is no awakening this side of the tomb. Thus he passed quietly\r\nto the great beyond, an unfearing cynic to the last hour of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AFTERWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nMy pardon came next day, duly signed and sealed, with the customary rider\r\nto it that I must renounce the Stuarts, and swear allegiance to King\r\nGeorge. I am no hero of romance, but a plain Englishman, a prosaic lover\r\nof roast beef and old claret, of farming and of fox-hunting. Our cause was\r\ndead, and might as well be buried. Not to make long of the matter, I took\r\nthe oath without scruple. To my pardon there was one other proviso: that I\r\nmust live on my estate until further notice. If at any time I were found\r\nten miles from Montagu Grange, the pardon was to be void.\r\n\r\nAileen and I moved to our appointed home at once. It may be believed that\r\nour hearts were full of the most tender joy and love, for I had been\r\nsnatched from the jaws of death into the very sunshine of life. We had but\r\none cloud to mar the bright light--the death of many a dear friend, and\r\nmost of all, of that friendly enemy who had given his life for her good\r\nname. Moralists point out to me that he was a great sinner. I care not if\r\nit be so. Let others condemn him; I do not. Rather I cherish the memory of\r\na gallant, faultful gentleman whose life found wrong expression. There be\r\nsome to whom are given inheritance of evil nature. Then how dare we, who\r\nknow not the measure of their temptation, make ourselves judges of their\r\nsin?\r\n\r\nAt the Grange we found awaiting us an unexpected visitor, a red-haired,\r\nlaughing Highlander, who, though in hiding, was as full of merriment as a\r\nschoolboy home for the holidays. To Cloe he made most ardent love, and\r\nwhen, at last, Donald Roy slipped across the waters to St. Germains, he\r\ncarried with him a promise that was redeemed after the general amnesty was\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after my pardon Malcolm Macleod and Miss Flora Macdonald stopped\r\nat the Grange for a short visit with us. They were on their way north,\r\nhaving been at length released without a trial, since the passion for\r\nblood was now spent.\r\n\r\n"We three, with Captain Donald Roy and Tony Creagh, came to London to be\r\nhangit," smiled Major Macleod as they were about to resume their journey.\r\n"Twa-three times the rope tightened around the gullets of some of us, yet\r\nin the end we all win free. You and Tony have already embraced the other\r\nnoose; Donald is in a geyan ill way, writing Latin verses to his lady\'s\r\neyes; and as for me,"--he smiled boldly at his companion--"I ride to the\r\nland of heather side by side with Miss Flora Macdonald."\r\n\r\nHere I drop the quill, for my tale is told. For me, life is full of many\r\nquiet interests and much happiness, but even now there grips me at times a\r\nlonging for those mad wild days, when death hung on a hair\'s breadth, and\r\nthe glamour of romance beckoned the feathered foot of youth.\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A DAUGHTER OF RAASAY ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
