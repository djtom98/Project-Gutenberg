Whose every dream is heaven, in whose fair joy\r\nExperience yet has thrown no black alloy."\r\n\r\n--THOUGHTS OF A RECLUSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years have now elapsed since my little heroine "ELSIE DINSMORE"\r\nmade her debut into the great world. She was sent out with many an\r\nanxious thought regarding the reception that might await her there.\r\nBut she was kindly welcomed, and such has been the favor shown her\r\never since that Publishers and Author have felt encouraged to prepare\r\na new volume in which will be found the story of those years that have\r\ncarried Elsie on from childhood to womanhood--the years in which\r\nher character was developing, and mind and body were growing and\r\nstrengthening for the real work and battle of life.\r\n\r\nMay my readers who have admired and loved her as a child find her\r\nstill more charming in her fresh young girlhood; may she prove to all\r\na pleasant companion and friend; and to those of them now treading the\r\nsame portion of life\'s pathway a useful example also, particularly in\r\nher filial love and obedience.\r\n\r\nM.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIt is a busy, talking world.\r\n\r\n--ROWE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think I shall enjoy the fortnight we are to spend here, papa; it\r\nseems such a very pleasant place," Elsie remarked, in a tone of great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you are pleased with it, daughter," returned Mr. Dinsmore,\r\nopening the morning paper, which John had just brought up.\r\n\r\nThey--Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie, Rose and Edward Allison--were occupying\r\nvery comfortable quarters in a large hotel at one of our fashionable\r\nwatering-places. A bedroom for each, and a private parlor for the\r\njoint use of the party, had been secured in advance, and late the\r\nnight before they had arrived and taken possession.\r\n\r\nIt was now early in the morning, Elsie and her papa were in his room,\r\nwhich was in the second story and opened upon a veranda, shaded by\r\ntall trees, and overlooking a large grassy yard at the side of the\r\nbuilding. Beyond were green fields, woods, and hills.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Elsie, gazing longingly upon them, as she stood by the\r\nopen window, "can\'t we take a walk?"\r\n\r\n"When Miss Rose is ready to go with us."\r\n\r\n"May I run to her door and ask if she is?--and if she isn\'t, may I\r\nwait for her out here on the veranda?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nShe skipped away, but was back again almost immediately. "Papa, what\r\ndo you think? It\'s just too bad!"\r\n\r\n"What is too bad, daughter? I think I never before saw so cross a look\r\non my little girl\'s face," he said, peering at her over the top of his\r\nnewspaper. "Come here, and tell me what it is all about."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, hanging her head and blushing. "I think I have some reason\r\nto be cross, papa," she said; "I thought we were going to have such a\r\ndelightful time here, and now it is all spoiled. You could never guess\r\nwho has the rooms just opposite ours; on the other side of the hall."\r\n\r\n"Miss Stevens?"\r\n\r\n"Why, papa; did you know she was here?"\r\n\r\n"I knew she was in the house, because I saw her name in the hotel book\r\nlast night when I went to register ours."\r\n\r\n"And it just spoils all our pleasure."\r\n\r\n"I hope not, daughter. I think she will hardly annoy you when you are\r\nclose at my side; and that is pretty much all the time, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, and I\'ll stick closer than ever to you if that will make\r\nher let me alone," she cried, with a merry laugh, putting her arm\r\nround his neck and kissing him two or three times.\r\n\r\n"Ah, now I have my own little girl again," he said, drawing her to his\r\nknee and returning her caresses with interest: "But there, I hear Miss\r\nRose\'s step in the hall. Run to mammy and have your hat put on."\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens\' presence proved scarcely less annoying to Elsie than the\r\nchild had anticipated. She tried to keep out of the lady\'s way, but it\r\nwas quite impossible. She could scarcely step out on the veranda, go\r\ninto the parlor, or take a turn in the garden by herself, but in\r\na moment Miss Stevens was at her side fawning upon and flattering\r\nher--telling her how sweet and pretty and amiable she was, how dearly\r\nshe loved her, and how much she thought of her papa too: he was so\r\nhandsome and so good; everybody admired him and thought him such a\r\nfine-looking gentleman, so polished in his manners, so agreeable and\r\nentertaining in conversation.\r\n\r\nThen she would press all sorts of dainties upon the little girl\r\nin such a way that it was next to impossible to decline them, and\r\noccasionally even went so far as to suggest improvements, or rather\r\nalterations, in her dress, which she said was entirely too plain.\r\n\r\n"You ought to have more flounces on your skirts, my dear," she\r\nremarked one day. "Skirt flounced to the waist are so very pretty and\r\ndressy, and you would look sweetly in them, but I notice you don\'t\r\nwear them at all. Do ask your papa to let you get a new dress and have\r\nit made so; I am sure he would consent, for any one can see that he is\r\nvery fond of you. He doesn\'t think of it; we can\'t expect gentlemen\r\nto notice such little matters; you ought to have a mamma to attend\r\nto such things for you. Ah! if you were my child, I would dress you\r\nsweetly, you dear little thing!"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am, I daresay you mean to be very kind," replied Elsie,\r\ntrying not to look annoyed, "but I don\'t want a mamma, since my own\r\ndear mother has gone to heaven; papa is enough for me, and I like the\r\nway he dresses me. He always buys my dresses himself and says how they\r\nare to be made. The dressmaker wanted to put more flounces on, but\r\npapa didn\'t want them and neither did I. He says he doesn\'t like to\r\nsee little girls loaded with finery, and that my clothes shall be of\r\nthe best material and nicely made, but neat and simple."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I know your dress is not cheap; I didn\'t mean that at all:\r\nit is quite expensive enough, and some of your white dresses are\r\nbeautifully worked; but I would like a little more ornament. You wear\r\nso little jewelry, and your father could afford to cover you with it\r\nif he chose. A pair of gold bracelets, like mine for instance, would\r\nbe very pretty, and look charming on your lovely white arms: those\r\npearl ones you wear sometimes are very handsome--any one could tell\r\nthat they are the real thing--but you ought to have gold ones too,\r\nwith clasps set with diamonds. Couldn\'t you persuade your papa to buy\r\nsome for you?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Miss Stevens, I don\'t want them! I don\'t want anything but\r\nwhat papa chooses to buy for me of his own accord. Ah! there is Miss\r\nRose looking for me, I must go," and the little girl, glad of an\r\nexcuse to get away, ran joyfully to her friend who had come to the\r\nveranda, where she and Miss Stevens had been standing, to tell her\r\nthat they were going out to walk, and her papa wished to take her\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nElsie went in to get her hat, and Miss Stevens came towards Rose,\r\nsaying, "I think I heard you say you were going to walk; and I\r\nbelieve, if you don\'t forbid me, I shall do myself the pleasure of\r\naccompanying you. I have just been waiting for pleasant company. I\r\nwill be ready in one moment." And before Rose could recover from her\r\nastonishment sufficiently to reply she had disappeared through the\r\nhall door.\r\n\r\nElsie was out again in a moment, just as the gentlemen had joined\r\nRose, who excited their surprise and disgust by a repetition of Miss\r\nStevens\' speech to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore looked excessively annoyed, and Edward "pshawed, and\r\nwished her at the bottom of the sea."\r\n\r\n"No, brother," said Rose, smiling, "you don\'t wish any such thing; on\r\nthe contrary, you would be the very first to fly to the rescue if you\r\nsaw her in danger of drowning."\r\n\r\nBut before there was time for anything more to be said Miss Stevens\r\nhad returned, and walking straight up to Mr. Dinsmore, she put her arm\r\nthrough his, saying with a little laugh, and what was meant for a\r\nvery arch expression, "You see I don\'t stand upon ceremony with old\r\nfriends, Mr. Dinsmore. It isn\'t my way."\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Stevens, I think it never was," he replied, offering the\r\nother arm to Rose.\r\n\r\nShe was going to decline it on the plea that the path was too narrow\r\nfor three, but something in his look made her change her mind and\r\naccept; and they moved on, while Elsie, almost ready to cry with\r\nvexation, fell behind with Edward Allison for an escort.\r\n\r\nEdward tried to entertain his young companion, but was too much\r\nprovoked at the turn things had taken to make himself very agreeable\r\nto any one; and altogether it was quite an uncomfortable walk: no\r\none seeming to enjoy it but Miss Stevens, who laughed and talked\r\nincessantly; addressing nearly all her conversation to Mr. Dinsmore,\r\nhe answering her with studied politeness, but nothing more.\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens had, from the first, conceived a great antipathy to\r\nRose, whom she considered a dangerous rival, and generally avoided,\r\nexcepting when Mr. Dinsmore was with her; but she always interrupted\r\na tete-a-tete between them when it was in her power to do so without\r\nbeing guilty of very great rudeness. This, and the covert sneers with\r\nwhich she often addressed Miss Allison had not escaped Mr. Dinsmore\'s\r\nnotice, and it frequently cost him quite an effort to treat Miss\r\nStevens with the respectful politeness which he considered due to her\r\nsex and to the daughter of his father\'s old friend.\r\n\r\n"Was it not too provoking, papa?" exclaimed Elsie, as she followed him\r\ninto his room on their return from their walk.\r\n\r\n"What, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Why, papa, I thought we were going to have such a nice time, and she\r\njust spoiled it all."\r\n\r\n"She? who, daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Why, papa, surely you know I mean Miss Stevens!"\r\n\r\n"Then why did you not mention her name, instead of speaking of her as\r\nshe? That does not sound respectful in a child of your age, and I wish\r\nmy little girl always to be respectful to those older than herself.\r\nI thought I heard you the other day mention some gentleman\'s name\r\nwithout the prefix of Mr., and I intended to reprove you for it at the\r\ntime. Don\'t do it again."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I won\'t," Elsie answered with a blush. "But, papa," she\r\nadded the next moment, "Miss Stevens does that constantly."\r\n\r\n"That makes no difference, my daughter," he said gravely. "Miss\r\nStevens is the very last person I would have you take for your model;\r\nthe less you resemble her in dress, manners, or anything else, the\r\nbetter. If you wish to copy any one let it be Miss Allison, for she is\r\na perfect lady in every respect."\r\n\r\nElsie looked very much pleased. "Yes, indeed, papa," she said, "I\r\nshould be glad if I could be just like Miss Rose, she is always kind\r\nand gentle to everybody; even the servants, whom Miss Stevens orders\r\nabout so crossly."\r\n\r\n"Elsie!"\r\n\r\n"What, papa?" she asked, blushing again, for his tone was reproving.\r\n\r\n"Come here and sit on my knee; I want to talk to you. I am afraid my\r\nlittle daughter is growing censorious," he said, with a very grave\r\nlook as he drew her to his side. "You forget that we ought not to\r\nspeak of other people\'s faults."\r\n\r\n"I will try not to do it any more, papa," she replied, the tears\r\nspringing to her eyes; "but you don\'t know how very annoying Miss\r\nStevens is. I have been near telling her several times that I did wish\r\nshe would let me alone."\r\n\r\n"No, daughter, don\'t do that. You must behave in a lady-like manner\r\nwhether she does or not. We must expect annoyances in this world, my\r\nchild; and must try to bear them with patience, remembering that\r\nGod sends the little trials as well as the great, and that He has\r\ncommanded us to \'let patience have her perfect work.\' I fear it is a\r\nlack of the spirit of forgiveness that makes it so difficult for us to\r\nbear these trifling vexations with equanimity. And you must remember\r\ntoo, dear, that the Bible bids us be courteous, and teaches us to\r\ntreat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated."\r\n\r\n"I think you always remember the command to be courteous, papa," she\r\nsaid, looking affectionately into his face. "I was wondering all the\r\ntime how you could be so very polite to Miss Stevens; for I was quite\r\nsure you would rather not have had her along. And then, what right had\r\nshe to take your arm without being asked?" and Elsie\'s face flushed\r\nwith indignation.\r\n\r\nHer father laughed a little. "And thus deprive my little girl of her\r\nrights," he said, softly kissing the glowing cheek. "Ah! I doubt if\r\nyou would have been angry had it been Miss Rose," he added, a little\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, you know Miss Rose would never have done such a thing!"\r\nexclaimed the little girl warmly.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, dear," he said in a soothing tone; "we won\'t talk any more\r\nabout it. I acknowledge that I do not find Miss Stevens the most\r\nagreeable company in the world, but I must treat her politely, and\r\nshow her a little attention sometimes; both because she is a lady and\r\nbecause her father once saved my father\'s life; for which I owe a debt\r\nof gratitude to him and his children."\r\n\r\n"Did he, papa? I am sure it was very good of him, and I will try to\r\nlike Miss Stevens for that. But won\'t you tell me about it?"\r\n\r\n"It was when they were both quite young men," said Mr. Dinsmore,\r\n"before either of them was married: they were skating together and\r\nyour grandfather broke through the ice, and would have been drowned,\r\nbut for the courage and presence of mind of Mr. Stevens, who saved him\r\nonly by very great exertion, and at the risk of his own life."\r\n\r\nA few days after this, Elsie was playing on the veranda, with several\r\nother little girls. "Do you think you shall like your new mamma,\r\nElsie?" asked one of them in a careless tone, as she tied on an apron\r\nshe had just been making for her doll, and turned it around to see how\r\nit fitted.\r\n\r\n"My new mamma!" exclaimed Elsie, with unfeigned astonishment, dropping\r\nthe scissors with which she had been cutting paper dolls for some of\r\nthe little ones. "What can you mean, Annie? I am not going to have any\r\nnew mamma."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, but you are though," asserted Annie positively; "for I\r\nheard my mother say so only yesterday; and it must be so, for she Miss\r\nStevens told it herself."\r\n\r\n"Miss Stevens! and what does she know about it? what has she to do\r\nwith my papa\'s affairs?" asked Elsie indignantly, the color rushing\r\nover face, neck, and arms.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should think she might know, when she is going to marry him,"\r\nreturned the other, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t! it\'s false! my"--but Elsie checked herself and shut her\r\nteeth hard to keep down the emotion that was swelling in her breast.\r\n\r\n"It\'s true, you may depend upon it," replied Annie; "everybody in the\r\nhouse knows it, and they are all talking about what a splendid match\r\nMiss Stevens is going to make; and mamma was wondering if you knew\r\nit, and how you would like her; and papa said he thought Mr. Dinsmore\r\nwouldn\'t think much of her if he knew how she flirted and danced until\r\nhe came, and now pretends not to approve of balls, just because he\r\ndoesn\'t."\r\n\r\nElsie made no reply, but dropping scissors, paper, and everything,\r\nsprang up and ran swiftly along the veranda, through the hall,\r\nupstairs, and without pausing to take breath, rushed into her father\'s\r\nroom, where he sat quietly reading.\r\n\r\n"Why, Elsie, daughter, what is the matter?" he asked in a tone of\r\nsurprise and concern, as he caught sight of her flushed and agitated\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, it\'s that hateful Miss Stevens; I can\'t bear her!" she\r\ncried, throwing herself upon his breast, and bursting into a fit of\r\npassionate weeping.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore said nothing for a moment; but thinking tears would prove\r\nthe best relief to her overwrought feelings, contented himself with\r\nsimply stroking her hair in a soothing way, and once or twice pressing\r\nhis lips gently to her forehead.\r\n\r\n"You feel better now, dearest, do you not?" he asked presently, as she\r\nraised her head to wipe away her tears.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"Now tell me what it was all about."\r\n\r\n"Miss Stevens does say such hateful things, papa!"\r\n\r\nHe laid his finger upon her lips. "Don\'t use that word again. It does\r\nnot sound at all like my usually gentle sweet-tempered little girl."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t, papa," she murmured, blushing and hanging her head. Then\r\nhiding her face on his breast, she lay there for several minutes\r\nperfectly silent and still.\r\n\r\n"What is my little girl thinking of?" he asked at length.\r\n\r\n"How everybody talks about you, papa; last evening I was out on the\r\nveranda, and I heard John and Miss Stevens\' maid, Phillis, talking\r\ntogether. It was moonlight, you know, papa," she went on, turning her\r\nface toward him again: "and they were out under the trees and John had\r\nhis arm round her, and he was kissing her, and telling her how pretty\r\nshe was; and then they began talking about Miss Stevens and you, and\r\nJohn told Phillis that he reckoned you were going to marry her--"\r\n\r\n"Who? Phillis?" asked Mr. Dinsmore, looking excessively amused.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa; no; you know I mean Miss Stevens," Elsie answered in a tone\r\nof annoyance.\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, and what of it all?" he asked, soothingly. "I don\'t think\r\nthe silly nonsense of the servants need trouble you. John is a sad\r\nfellow, I know; he courts all the pretty colored girls wherever he\r\ngoes. I shall have to read him a serious lecture on the subject. But\r\nit is very kind of you to be so concerned for Phillis."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, don\'t!" she said, turning away her face. "Please don\'t\r\ntease me so. You know I don\'t care for Phillis or John; but that isn\'t\r\nall." And then she repeated what had passed between Annie and herself.\r\n\r\nHe looked a good deal provoked as she went on with her story; then\r\nvery grave indeed. He was quite silent for a moment after she had\r\ndone. Then drawing her closer to him, he said tenderly, "My poor\r\nlittle girl, I am sorry you should be so annoyed; but you know it is\r\nnot true, daughter, and why need you care what other people think and\r\nsay?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like them to talk so, papa! I can\'t bear to have them say\r\nsuch things about you!" she exclaimed indignantly.\r\n\r\nHe was silent again for a little; then said kindly, "I think I had\r\nbetter take you away from these troublesome talkers. What do you say\r\nto going home?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, papa, do take me home," she answered eagerly. "I wish we\r\nwere there now. I think it is the pleasantest place in the world and\r\nit seems such a long, long while since we came away. Let us start\r\nto-morrow, papa; can\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"But you know you will have to leave Miss Rose."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I forgot that," she said a little sadly; but brightening again,\r\nshe asked: "Couldn\'t you invite her to go home with us and spend the\r\nwinter? Ah! papa, do! it would be so pleasant to have her."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, it wouldn\'t do," he replied with a grave shake of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Why, papa?" she asked with a look of keen disappointment.\r\n\r\n"You are too young to understand why," he said in the same grave tone,\r\nand then relapsed into silence; sitting there for some time stroking\r\nher hair in an absent way, with his eyes on the carpet.\r\n\r\nAt last he said, "Elsie!" in a soft, low tone that quite made the\r\nlittle girl start and look up into his face; for she, too, had been in\r\na deep reverie.\r\n\r\n"What, papa?" she asked, and she wondered to see how the color had\r\nspread over his face, and how bright his eyes looked.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking," he said, in a half hesitating way, "that\r\nthough it would not do to invite Miss Rose to spend the winter with\r\nus, it might do very nicely to ask her to come and live at the Oaks."\r\n\r\nElsie looked at him for a moment with a bewildered expression; then\r\nsuddenly comprehending, her face lighted up.\r\n\r\n"Would you like it, dearest?" he asked; "or would you prefer to go on\r\nliving just as we have been, you and I together? I would consult your\r\nhappiness before my own, for it lies very near my heart, my precious\r\none. I can never forgive myself for all I have made you suffer, and\r\nwhen you were restored to me almost from the grave, I made a vow to do\r\nall in my power to make your future life bright and happy."\r\n\r\nHis tones were full of deep feeling, and as he spoke he drew her\r\ncloser and closer to him and kissed her tenderly again and again.\r\n\r\n"Speak, daughter, and tell me what you wish," he said, as she still\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nAt last she spoke, and he bent down to catch the words. "Dear papa,"\r\nshe whispered, "would it make you happy? and do you think mamma knows,\r\nand that she would like it?"\r\n\r\n"Your mamma loves us both too well not to be pleased with anything\r\nthat would add to our happiness," he replied gently.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, you won\'t be angry if I ask another question?\'"\'\r\n\r\n"No, darling; ask as many as you wish."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, will I have to call her mamma? and do you think my own\r\nmamma would like it?"\r\n\r\n"If Miss Allison consents to take a mother\'s place to you, I am sure\r\nyour own mamma, if she could speak to you, would tell you she deserved\r\nto have the title; and it would hurt us both very much if you refused\r\nto give it. Indeed, my daughter, I cannot ask her to come to us unless\r\nyou will promise to do so, and to love and obey, her just as you do\r\nme. Will you?"\r\n\r\n"I will try to obey her, papa; and I shall love her very dearly, for I\r\ndo already; but I can not love anybody quite so well as I love you, my\r\nown dear, dear father!" she said, throwing her arms around his neck.\r\n\r\nHe returned her caress, saying tenderly, "That is all I can ask,\r\ndearest; I must reserve the first place in your heart for myself."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she will come, papa?" she asked anxiously.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, daughter; I have not asked her yet. But shall I tell\r\nher that it will add to your happiness if she will be your mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; and that I will call her mamma, and obey her and love her\r\ndearly. Oh, papa, ask her very soon, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; but don\'t set your heart too much on it, for she may not be\r\nquite so willing to take such a troublesome charge as Miss Stevens\r\nseems to be," he said, returning to his playful tone.\r\n\r\nElsie looked troubled and anxious.\r\n\r\n"I hope she will, papa," she said; "I think she might be very glad to\r\ncome and live with you; and in such a beautiful home, too."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but everyone does not appreciate my society as highly as you do,"\r\nhe replied, laughing and pinching her cheek; "and besides, you forget\r\nabout the troublesome little girl. I have heard ladies say they would\r\nnot marry a man who had a child."\r\n\r\n"But Miss Rose loves me, papa; I am sure she does," she said,\r\nflushing, and the tears starting to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling, I know she does," he answered soothingly. "I am only\r\nafraid she loves you better than she does me."\r\n\r\nA large party of equestrians were setting out from the hotel that\r\nevening soon after tea, and Elsie, in company with several other\r\nlittle girls, went out upon the veranda to watch them mount and ride\r\naway. She was absent but a few moments from the parlor, where she had\r\nleft her father, but when she returned to it he was not there. Miss\r\nRose, too, was gone, she found upon further search, and though she had\r\nnot much difficulty in conjecturing why she had thus, for the first\r\ntime, been left behind, she could not help feeling rather lonely and\r\ndesolate.\r\n\r\nShe felt no disposition to renew the afternoon\'s conversation with\r\nAnnie Hart, so she went quietly upstairs to their private parlor and\r\nsat down to amuse herself with a book until Chloe came in from eating\r\nher supper. Then the little girl brought a stool, and seating herself\r\nin the old posture with her head in her nurse\'s lap, she drew her\r\nmother\'s miniature from her bosom, and fixing her eyes lovingly upon\r\nit, said, as she had done hundreds of times before: "Now, mammy,\r\nplease tell me about my dear, dear mamma."\r\n\r\nThe soft eyes were full of tears; for with all her joy at the thought\r\nof Rose, mingled a strange sad feeling that she was getting farther\r\naway from that dear, precious, unknown mother, whose image had been,\r\nsince her earliest recollection, enshrined in her very heart of\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  O lady! there be many things\r\n  That seem right fair above;\r\n  But sure not one among them all\r\n  Is half so sweet as love;--\r\n  Let us not pay our vows alone,\r\n  But join two altars into one.\r\n\r\n  --O. W. HOLMES\r\n\r\n  Here still is the smile that no cloud can o\'ercast,\r\n  And the heart, and the hand, all thy own to the last.\r\n\r\n  --MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Dinsmore was quite remarkable for his conversational\r\npowers, and Rose, who had always heretofore found him a most\r\nentertaining companion, wondered greatly at his silence on this\r\nparticular evening. She waited in vain for him to start some topic of\r\nconversation, but as he did not seem disposed to do so, she at length\r\nmade the attempt herself, and tried one subject after another.\r\nFinding, however, that she was answered only in monosyllables, she too\r\ngrew silent and embarrassed, and heartily wished for the relief of\r\nElsie\'s presence.\r\n\r\nShe had proposed summoning the child to accompany them as usual, but\r\nMr. Dinsmore replied that she had already had sufficient exercise, and\r\nhe would prefer having her remain at home.\r\n\r\nThey had walked some distance, and coming to a rustic seat where they\r\nhad often rested, they sat down. The moon was shining softly down upon\r\nthem, and all nature seemed hushed and still. For some moments neither\r\nof them spoke, but at length Mr. Dinsmore broke the silence.\r\n\r\n"Miss Allison," he said, in his deep, rich tones, "I would like to\r\ntell you a story, if you will do me the favor to listen."\r\n\r\nIt would have been quite impossible for Rose to tell why her heart\r\nbeat so fast at this very commonplace remark, but so it was; and she\r\ncould scarcely steady her voice to reply, "I always find your stories\r\ninteresting, Mr. Dinsmore."\r\n\r\nHe began at once.\r\n\r\n"Somewhere between ten and eleven years ago, a wild, reckless boy\r\nof seventeen, very much spoiled by the indulgence of a fond, doting\r\nfather, who loved and petted him as the only son of his departed\r\nmother, was spending a few months in one of our large Southern cities,\r\nwhere he met, and soon fell desperately in love with, a beautiful\r\norphan heiress, some two years his junior.\r\n\r\n"The boy was of too ardent a temperament, and too madly in love, to\r\nbrook for a moment the thought of waiting until parents and guardians\r\nshould consider them of suitable age to marry, in addition to which he\r\nhad good reason to fear that his father, with whom family pride was a\r\nruling passion, would entirely refuse his consent upon learning that\r\nthe father of the young lady had begun life as a poor, uneducated boy,\r\nand worked his way up to wealth and position by dint of hard labor and\r\nincessant application to business.\r\n\r\n"The boy, it is true, was almost as proud himself, but it was not\r\nuntil the arrows of the boy-god had entered into his heart too\r\ndeeply to be extracted, that he learned the story of his charmer\'s\r\nantecedents. Yet I doubt if the result would have been different had\r\nhe been abundantly forewarned; for oh, Miss Rose, if ever an angel\r\nwalked the earth in human form it was she!--so gentle, so good, so\r\nbeautiful!"\r\n\r\nHe heaved a deep sigh, paused a moment, and then went on:\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Rose, as you have probably surmised, they were privately\r\nmarried. If that sweet girl had a fault, it was that she was too\r\nyielding to those she loved, and she did love her young husband with\r\nall the warmth of her young guileless heart; for she had neither\r\nparents nor kinsfolk, and he was the one object around which her\r\naffections might cling. They were all the world to each other, and for\r\na few short months they were very happy.\r\n\r\n"But it could not last; the marriage was discovered--her guardian and\r\nthe young man\'s father were both furious, and they were torn asunder;\r\nshe carried away to a distant plantation, and he sent North to attend\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n"They were well-nigh distracted, but cherished the hope that when\r\nthey should reach their majority and come into possession of their\r\nproperty, which was now unfortunately entirely in the hands of their\r\nguardians, they would be reunited.\r\n\r\n"But--it is the old story--their letters were intercepted, and the\r\nfirst news the young husband received of his wife was that she had\r\ndied a few days after giving birth to a little daughter."\r\n\r\nAgain Mr. Dinsmore paused, then continued:\r\n\r\n"It was a terrible stroke! For months, reason seemed almost ready to\r\ndesert her throne; but time does wonders, and in the course of years\r\nit did much to heal his wounds. You would perhaps suppose that he\r\nwould at once--or at least as soon as he was his own master--have\r\nsought out his child, and lavished upon it the wealth of his\r\naffections: but no; he had conceived almost an aversion to it; for he\r\nlooked upon it as the cause--innocent, it is true--but still the cause\r\nof his wife\'s death. He did not know till long years afterwards\r\nthat her heart was broken by the false story of his desertion and\r\nsubsequent death. Her guardian was a hard, cruel man, though faithful\r\nin his care of her property.\r\n\r\n"With him the child remained until she was about four years old when\r\na change was made necessary by his death, and she, with her faithful\r\nnurse, was received into her paternal grandfather\'s family until her\r\nfather, who had then gone abroad, should return. But my story is\r\ngrowing very long, and you will be weary of listening. I will try to\r\nbe as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n"The little girl, under the care of her nurse and the faithful\r\ninstructions of a pious old Scotchwoman--who had come over with the\r\nchild\'s maternal grandparents, and followed the fortunes of the\r\ndaughter and granddaughter, always living as housekeeper in the\r\nfamilies where they resided--had grown to be a sweet, engaging child,\r\ninheriting her mother\'s beauty and gentleness. She had also her\r\nmother\'s craving for affection, and was constantly looking and longing\r\nfor the return of her unknown father, which was delayed from time to\r\ntime until she was nearly eight years of age.\r\n\r\n"At last he came; but ah, what a bitter disappointment awaited the\r\npoor child! His mind had been poisoned against her, and instead of\r\nthe love and tenderness she had a right to expect, he met her with\r\ncoldness--almost with aversion. Poor little one! she was nearly\r\nheartbroken, and for a time scarcely dared venture into her father\'s\r\npresence. She was gentle, submissive, and patient; he cold, haughty,\r\nand stern. But she would love him, in spite of his sternness, and at\r\nlength she succeeded in winning her way to his affections, and he\r\nlearned to love her with passionate tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Still her troubles were not over. She was sincerely pious, and\r\nconscientiously strict in many things which her father deemed of\r\nlittle importance; especially was this the case in regard to the\r\nobservance of the Sabbath. He was a man of iron will, and she, though\r\nperfectly submissive in other respects, had the firmness of a martyr\r\nin resisting any interference with her conscience.\r\n\r\n"Well, their wills came in collision. He required her to do what she\r\nconsidered a violation of God\'s law, although he could see no harm\r\nin it, and therefore considered her stubborn and disobedient. He was\r\nfirm, but so was she. He tried persuasions, threats, punishments--all\r\nwithout effect. He banished her from his arms, from the family circle,\r\ndeprived her of amusements, denied her to visitors, broke off her\r\ncorrespondence with a valued friend, sent away her nurse; and finding\r\nall these acts of severity ineffectual, he at length left her, telling\r\nher he would return only when she submitted; and even refusing her a\r\nparting caress, which she pleaded for with heart-breaking entreaties."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s voice trembled with emotion, but recovering himself, he\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think, Miss Allison, that all this time the father\'s heart was\r\nnot bleeding; it was, at every pore; but he was determined to conquer,\r\nand mistook the child\'s motives and the source of her strength to\r\nresist his will.\r\n\r\n"He had bought a beautiful estate; he caused the house to be\r\nhandsomely fitted up and furnished, especially lavishing trouble and\r\nexpense upon a suite of rooms for his little girl, and when all was\r\ncompleted, he wrote to her, bidding her go and see the lovely home\r\nhe had prepared for her reception as soon as she would submit,--and\r\npresenting, as the only alternative, banishment to a boarding-school\r\nor convent until her education was finished. This was the one drop\r\nwhich made the cup overflow. The poor suffering child was prostrated\r\nby a brain fever which brought her to the very gates of death. Then\r\nthe father\'s eyes were opened; he saw his folly and his sin, and\r\nrepented in sackcloth and ashes; and God, in His great mercy, was\r\npleased to spare him the terrible crushing blow which seemed to have\r\nalready fallen;--for at one time they told him his child was dead. Oh,\r\nnever, never can he forget the unutterable anguish of that moment!"\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore paused, unable to proceed. Rose had been weeping for some\r\ntime. She well knew to whose story she was listening, and her gentle,\r\nloving heart was filled with pity for both him and for his child.\r\n\r\n"I have but little more to tell," he resumed; "the child has at length\r\nentirely recovered her health; she is dearer to her father\'s heart\r\nthan words can express, and is very happy in the knowledge that it is\r\nso, and that henceforward he will strive to assist her to walk in the\r\nnarrow way, instead of endeavoring to lead her from it.\r\n\r\n"Their home has been a very happy one; but it lacks one thing--the\r\nwife and mother\'s place is vacant; she who filled it once is\r\ngone--never to return!--but there is a sweet, gentle lady who has\r\nwon the hearts of both father and daughter, and whom they would fain\r\npersuade to fill the void in their affections and their home.\r\n\r\n"Miss Rose, dare I hope that you would venture to trust your happiness\r\nin the hands of a man who has proved himself capable of such cruelty?"\r\n\r\nRose did not speak, and he seemed to read in her silence and her\r\naverted face a rejection of his suit.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you cannot love or trust me!" he exclaimed bitterly. "I was\r\nindeed a fool to hope it. Forgive me for troubling you; forgive my\r\npresumption in imagining for a moment that I might be able to win you.\r\nBut oh, Rose, could you but guess how I love you--better than aught\r\nelse upon earth save my precious child! and even as I love her better\r\nthan life. I said that our home had been a happy one, but to me it can\r\nbe so no longer if you refuse to share it with me!"\r\n\r\nShe turned her blushing face towards him for a single instant, and\r\ntimidly placed her hand in his. The touch sent a thrill through her\r\nwhole frame.\r\n\r\n"And you will dare trust me?" he said in a low tone of intense joy.\r\n"Oh, Rose! I have not deserved such happiness as this! I am not worthy\r\nof one so pure and good. But I will do all that man can do to make\r\nyour life bright and happy."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Mr. Dinsmore! I am very unfit for the place you have asked me\r\nto fill," she murmured. "I am not old enough, or wise enough to be a\r\nmother to your little girl."\r\n\r\n"I know you are young, dear Rose, but you are far from foolish," he\r\nsaid tenderly, "and my little girl is quite prepared to yield you a\r\ndaughter\'s love and obedience; but I do not think she will be a care\r\nor trouble to you; I do not intend that she shall, but expect to take\r\nall that upon myself. Indeed, Rose, dearest, you shall never know any\r\ncare or trouble that I can save you from. No words can tell how dear\r\nyou are to me, and were it in my power I would shield you from every\r\nannoyance, and give you every joy that the human heart can know. I\r\nhave loved you from the first day we met!--ah, I loved you even before\r\nthat, for all your love and kindness to my darling child; but I\r\nscarcely dared hope that you could return my affection, or feel\r\nwilling to trust your happiness to the keeping of one who had shown\r\nhimself such a monster of cruelty in his treatment of his little\r\ngentle daughter. Are you not afraid of me, Rose?"\r\n\r\nHis arm was around her waist, and he was bending over her, gazing down\r\ninto her face, and eagerly awaiting her answer.\r\n\r\nPresently it came, in calm, gentle tones; "No, Horace; \'perfect love\r\ncasteth out fear,\' and I cannot judge you hardly for what may\r\nhave been only a mistaken sense of duty, and has been so bitterly\r\nrepented."\r\n\r\n"Heaven bless you, dearest, for these words," he answered with\r\nemotion, "they have made me the happiest of men."\r\n\r\nHorace Dinsmore wore upon his little finger a splendid diamond ring,\r\nwhich had attracted a good deal of attention, especially among the\r\nladies; who admired it extremely, and of which Miss Stevens had hoped\r\nto be one day the happy and envied possessor. Taking Rose\'s small\r\nwhite hand in his again, he placed it upon her slender finger.\r\n\r\n"This seals our compact, and makes you mine forever," he said,\r\npressing the hand to his lips.\r\n\r\n"With the consent of my parents," murmured Rose, a soft blush mantling\r\nher cheek.\r\n\r\nElsie was still in her papa\'s private parlor, for though it was long\r\npast her usual hour for retiring, she had not yet done so; her father\r\nhaving left a message with Chloe to the effect that she might, if she\r\nchose, stay up until his return.\r\n\r\nChloe had dropped asleep in her chair, and the little girl was\r\ntrying to while away the time with a book. But she did not seem much\r\ninterested in it, for every now and then she laid it down to run to\r\nthe door and listen. Then sighing to herself, "They are not coming\r\nyet," she would go back and take it up again. But at last she started\r\nfrom her seat with an exclamation of delight that awoke Chloe; for\r\nthis time there could be no doubt; she had heard his well-known step\r\nupon the stairs.\r\n\r\nShe moved quickly towards the door--stopped--hesitated, and stood\r\nstill to the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nBut the door opened, and her father entered with Miss Rose upon his\r\narm. One look at his radiant countenance, and Rose\'s blushing, happy\r\nface told the whole glad story. He held out his hand with a beaming\r\nsmile, and Elsie sprang towards him.\r\n\r\n"My darling," he said, stooping to give her a kiss, "I have brought\r\nyou a mother."\r\n\r\nThen taking Rose\'s hand, and placing one of Elsie\'s in it, while he\r\nheld the other in a close, loving grasp, he added: "Rose, she is your\r\ndaughter also. I give you a share in my choicest treasure."\r\n\r\nRose threw her arm around the little girl and kissed her tenderly,\r\nwhispering: "Will you love me, Elsie, dearest? you know how dearly I\r\nlove you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will; I do love you very much, and I am very glad, dear,\r\ndarling Miss Rose," Elsie replied, returning her caress.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was watching them with a heart swelling with joy and\r\ngratitude. He led Rose to a sofa, and seating himself by her side,\r\ndrew Elsie in between his knees, and put an arm round each. "My two\r\ntreasures," he said, looking affectionately from one to the other.\r\n"Rose, I feel myself the richest man in the Union."\r\n\r\nRose smiled, and Elsie laid her head on her father\'s shoulder with a\r\nhappy sigh.\r\n\r\nThey sat a few moments thus, when Rose made a movement to go,\r\nremarking that it must be growing late. She felt a secret desire to\r\nbe safe within the shelter of her own room before the return of the\r\nriding party should expose her to Miss Stevens\' prying curiosity.\r\n\r\n"It is not quite ten yet," said Mr. Dinsmore, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n"Late enough though, is it not?" she answered with a smile. "I think I\r\nmust go. Good-night, dear little Elsie." She rose, and Mr. Dinsmore,\r\ngently drawing her hand within his arm, led her to her room, bidding\r\nher good-night at the door, and adding a whispered request that she\r\nwould wait for him to conduct her down to the breakfast room in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"Must I go to bed now, papa?" asked Elsie, as he returned to the\r\nparlor again.\r\n\r\n"Not yet," he said; "I want you." And, sitting down, he took her in\r\nhis arms. "My darling, my dear little daughter!" he said; "were you\r\nvery lonely this evening?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa; not very, though I missed you and Miss Rose."\r\n\r\nHe was gazing down into her face; something in its expression seemed\r\nto strike him, and he suddenly turned her towards the light, and\r\nlooking keenly at her, said, "You have been crying; what was the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed crimson, and the tears started to her eyes again.\r\n"Dear papa, don\'t be angry with me," she pleaded. "I couldn\'t help it;\r\nindeed I could not."\r\n\r\n"I am not angry, darling; only pained that my little girl is not\r\nso happy as I expected. I hoped that your joy would be unclouded\r\nto-night, as mine has been; but will you not tell your father what\r\ntroubles you, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"I was looking at this, papa," she said, drawing her mother\'s\r\nminiature from her bosom, and putting it into his hand; "and mammy was\r\ntelling me all about my own mamma again; and, papa, you know I love\r\nMiss Rose, and I am very glad she is coming to us, but it seems as\r\nif--as if--" She burst into a flood of tears, and hiding her face on\r\nhis breast, sobbed out, "Oh, papa, I can\'t help feeling as though\r\nmamma--my own dear mamma--is farther away from us now; as if she is\r\ngoing to be forgotten."\r\n\r\nThere were tears in his eyes, too; but gently raising her head, he\r\npushed back the curls from her forehead, and kissing her tenderly,\r\nsaid, in low, soothing tones, "No, darling; it is only a feeling, and\r\nwill soon pass away. Your own dear mother--my early love--can never be\r\nforgotten by either of us. Nor would Rose wish it. There is room in\r\nmy heart for both of them, and I do not love the memory of Elsie less\r\nbecause I have given a place in it to Rose."\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary silence; then she looked up, asking timidly,\r\n"You are not vexed with me, papa?"\r\n\r\n"No, dearest; not at all; and I am very glad you have told me your\r\nfeelings so freely," he said, folding her closer and closer to his\r\nheart. "I hope you will always come to me with your sorrows, and you\r\nneed never fear that you will not find sympathy, and help too, as far\r\nas it is in my power to give it. Elsie, do you know that you are very\r\nlike your mother?--the resemblance grows stronger every day; and it\r\nwould be quite impossible for me to forget her with this living image\r\nalways before me."\r\n\r\n"Am I like her, papa? I am so glad!" exclaimed the little girl\r\neagerly, her face lighting up with a joyous smile.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though Mr. Dinsmore could hardly bear to part with his\r\nchild that night; he held her a long time in his arms, but at last,\r\nwith another tender caress, and a fervent blessing, he bade her\r\ngood-night and sent her away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  She twin\'d--and her mother\'s gaze brought back\r\n  Each hue of her childhood\'s faded track.\r\n  Oh! hush the song, and let her tears\r\n  Flow to the dream of her early years!\r\n  Holy and pure are the drops that fall\r\n  When the young bride goes from her father\'s hall;\r\n  She goes unto love yet untried and new--\r\n  She parts from love which hath still been true.\r\n\r\n  --MRS. HEMANS\' POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"How did it happen that Mr. Dinsmore was not of your party last night,\r\nMiss Stevens?" inquired one of the lady boarders the next morning at\r\nthe breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n"He had been riding all the morning with his little girl, and I\r\npresume was too much fatigued to go again in the evening," Miss\r\nStevens coolly replied, as she broke an egg into her cup, and\r\nproceeded very deliberately to season it.\r\n\r\n"It seems he was not too much fatigued to walk," returned the other, a\r\nlittle maliciously; "or to take a lady upon his arm."\r\n\r\nMiss Stevens started, and looked up hastily.\r\n\r\n"I would advise you to be on your guard, and play your cards well,\r\nor that quiet Miss Allison may prove a serious rival," the lady\r\ncontinued. "He certainly pays her a good deal of attention."\r\n\r\n"It is easy to account for that," remarked Miss Stevens, with a\r\nscornful toss of the head; "he is very fond of his little girl, and\r\ntakes her out walking or riding every day, and this Miss Allison--who\r\nis, I presume, a kind of governess--indeed, it is evident that she\r\nis, from the care she takes of the child--goes along as a matter of\r\ncourse; but if you think Horace Dinsmore would look at a governess,\r\nyou are greatly mistaken, for he is as proud as Lucifer, as well as\r\nthe rest of his family, though he does set up to be so very pious!"\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, madam," observed a gentleman sitting near, "but you must\r\nbe laboring under a misapprehension. I am well acquainted with the\r\nAllison family, and can assure you that the father is one of the\r\nwealthiest merchants in Philadelphia."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Dinsmore entered with Rose upon his arm, and\r\nleading Elsie with the other hand. They drew near the table; he handed\r\nMiss Allison to a seat and took his place beside her.\r\n\r\nA slight murmur of surprise ran round the table, and all eyes were\r\nturned upon Rose, who, feeling uncomfortably conscious of the fact,\r\ncast down her own in modest embarrassment, while Elsie, with a face\r\nall smiles and dimples, sent a triumphant glance across the table at\r\nAnnie Hart, who was whispering to her mother, "See, mamma, she has Mr.\r\nDinsmore\'s ring!"\r\n\r\nThat lady immediately called Miss Stevens\' attention to it, which was\r\nquite unnecessary, as she was already burning with rage at the sight.\r\n\r\n"They walked out alone last evening, and that ring explains what they\r\nwere about," said Mrs. Hart, in an undertone. "I am really sorry for\r\nyou, Miss Stevens; for your prize has certainly slipped through your\r\nfingers."\r\n\r\n"I am much obliged to you," she replied, with a toss of her head; "but\r\nthere are as good fish in the sea as ever were caught."\r\n\r\nThe next moment she rose and left the table, Mrs. Hart following her\r\ninto the public parlor, and continuing the conversation by remarking,\r\n"I would sue him for breach of promise if I were you, Miss Stevens. I\r\nunderstood you were engaged to him."\r\n\r\n"I never said so; so what right had you to suppose it?" returned Miss\r\nStevens snappishly.\r\n\r\nAnd upon reflecting a moment, Mrs. Hart could not remember that she\r\nhad ever said so in plain terms, although she had hinted it many\r\ntimes--talking a great deal of Mr. Dinsmore\'s splendid establishment,\r\nand frequently speaking of the changes she thought would be desirable\r\nin Elsie\'s dress, just as though she expected some day to have it\r\nunder her control. Then, too, she had always treated Mr. Dinsmore with\r\nso much familiarity that it was perfectly natural strangers should\r\nsuppose they were engaged, even though he never reciprocated it;\r\nfor that might be only because he was naturally reserved and\r\nundemonstrative; as indeed Miss Stevens frequently averred, seeming to\r\nregret it very deeply.\r\n\r\nPresently she burst out, "I don\'t know why people are always so ready\r\nto talk! I don\'t care for Horace Dinsmore, and never did! There was\r\nnever anything serious between us, though I must say he has paid me\r\nmarked attentions, and given me every reason to suppose he meant\r\nsomething by them. I never gave him any encouragement, however; and so\r\nhe has been taken in by that artful creature. I thought he had more\r\nsense, and could see through her manoeuvers--coaxing and petting up\r\nthe child to curry favor with the father! I thank my stars that I am\r\nabove such mean tricks! I presume she thinks, now, she is making a\r\nsplendid match; but if she doesn\'t repent of her bargain before she\r\nhas been married a year, I miss my guess! She\'ll never have her own\r\nway--not a bit of it--I can tell her that. Everybody that knows\r\nhim will tell you that he is high-tempered and tyrannical, and as\r\nobstinate as a mule."\r\n\r\n"The grapes are very sour, I think," whispered Mrs. Hart to her next\r\nneighbor, who nodded and laughed.\r\n\r\n"There is Elsie out on the veranda, now," said Annie. "I mean to\r\ngo and ask her what Miss Allison had her father\'s ring for; may I,\r\nmamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; go, child, if you want to; I should like to hear what she will\r\nsay; though, of course, everybody understands that there must be an\r\nengagement."\r\n\r\n"Well, Elsie, what made you run away in such a hurry yesterday?" asked\r\nAnnie, running up to our little friend. "Did you ask your papa about\r\nthe new mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I told him what you said, Annie, and it wasn\'t true," Elsie answered,\r\nwith a glad look of joy. "I am going to have a new mother though, and\r\npapa said I might tell you; but it is Miss Allison instead of Miss\r\nStevens, and I am very glad, because I love her dearly."\r\n\r\n"Is she your governess?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! what made you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Stevens said so," replied Annie, laughing and running away. And\r\njust then Elsie\'s papa called her, and bade her go upstairs and have\r\nher hat put on, as they were going out to walk.\r\n\r\nEdward Allison had been talking with his sister in her room, and they\r\ncame down together to the veranda, where Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie were\r\nwaiting for them. Edward was looking very proud and happy, but Rose\'s\r\nface was half hidden by her veil. She took Mr. Dinsmore\'s offered arm\r\nand Elsie asked, "Aren\'t you going with us, Mr. Edward?"\r\n\r\n"Not this time," he answered, smiling. "I have an engagement to play a\r\ngame of chess with one of the ladies in the parlor yonder."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall have papa\'s other hand," she said, taking possession of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe was very merry and talkative, but neither of her companions seemed\r\nmuch disposed to answer her remarks. They were following the same path\r\nthey had taken the night before, and the thoughts of both were very\r\nbusy with the past and the future.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached the rustic seat where they had sat while Mr.\r\nDinsmore told his story, and he inquired of Rose if she would like to\r\nstop and rest.\r\n\r\nShe assented, recognizing the place with a smile and a blush, and they\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Elsie, "I am not tired, mayn\'t I run on to the top of\r\nthat hill yonder?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you will not go out of sight or hearing, so that I can see\r\nthat you are safe, and within call when I want you," he replied, and\r\nshe bounded away.\r\n\r\nRose was sitting thoughtfully, with her eyes upon the ground, while\r\nthose of her companion were following the graceful figure of his\r\nlittle girl, as she tripped lightly along the road.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dinsmore," Rose began.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, but were you speaking to me?" he asked, turning to her\r\nwith a half smile.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," she replied, smiling in return; "there is no one else\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Well then, Rose, dear, please to remember that I don\'t answer to that\r\nname from your lips, at least not when we are alone. I am not Mr.\r\nDinsmore to you, unless you mean to be Miss Allison to me," he added,\r\ntaking her hand and gazing tenderly into her blushing face.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, no; I would not have you call me that!"\r\n\r\n"Well then, dear Rose, I want you to call me Horace. I would almost as\r\nsoon think of being Mr. Dinsmore to Elsie, as to you. And now, what\r\nwere you going to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Only that I wish to set out on my homeward way to-night, with Edward.\r\nI think it would be best, more especially as mamma has written\r\ncomplaining of our long absence, and urging a speedy return."\r\n\r\n"Of course your mother\'s wishes are the first to be consulted, until\r\nyou have given me a prior right," he said, in a playful tone; "and\r\nso I suppose Elsie and I will be obliged to continue our journey by\r\nourselves. But when may I claim you for my own indeed? Let it be as\r\nsoon as possible, dearest, for I feel that I ought to return to my\r\nhome ere long, and I am not willing to do so without my wife."\r\n\r\n"I must have a few weeks to prepare; you know a lady\'s wardrobe cannot\r\nbe got ready in a day. What would you say to six weeks? I am afraid\r\nmamma would think it entirely too short."\r\n\r\n"Six weeks, dear Rose? why that would bring us to the middle of\r\nNovember. Surely a month will be long enough to keep me waiting for my\r\nhappiness, and give the dressmakers sufficient time for their work.\r\nLet us say one month from to-day."\r\n\r\nRose raised one objection after another, but he overruled them all and\r\npleaded his cause so earnestly that he gained his point at last, and\r\nthe wedding was fixed for that day month, provided the consent of\r\nher parents, to so sudden a parting with their daughter, could be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWhile Rose was at home making her preparations, Mr. Dinsmore and his\r\ndaughter were visiting the great lakes, and travelling through Canada.\r\nHe heard frequently from her, and there were always a few lines\r\nto Elsie, which her father allowed her to answer in a little note\r\nenclosed in his; and sometimes he read her a little of his own, or of\r\nMiss Rose\'s letter, which she always considered a very great treat.\r\n\r\nNew York City was their last halting place on their route, and there\r\nthey spent nearly two weeks in shopping and sight-seeing. Mr. Dinsmore\r\npurchased an elegant set of furniture for his wife\'s boudoir, and\r\nsent it on to his home, with his orders to Mrs. Murray concerning\r\nits arrangement. To this he added a splendid set of diamonds as his\r\nwedding gift to his bride, while Elsie selected a pair of very costly\r\nbracelets as hers.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon, the next morning\r\nbeing the time appointed for the wedding. Mr. Dinsmore himself went to\r\nhis hotel, but sent Elsie and her nurse to Mr. Allison\'s, as he had\r\nbeen urgently requested to do, the family being now in occupation of\r\ntheir town residence.\r\n\r\nElsie found the whole house in a bustle of preparation. Sophy met her\r\nat the door and carried her off at once to her own room, eager to\r\ndisplay what she called "her wedding dress." She was quite satisfied\r\nwith the admiration Elsie expressed. "But I suppose you bought ever so\r\nmany new dresses, and lots of other pretty things, in New York?" she\r\nsaid inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes; papa and I together. And don\'t you think, Sophy, he let me help\r\nhim choose some of his clothes, and he says he thinks I have very good\r\ntaste in ladies\' and gentlemen\'s dress too."\r\n\r\n"That was right kind of him, but isn\'t it odd, and real nice too, that\r\nhe and Rose are going to get married? I was so surprised. Do you like\r\nit, Elsie? and shall you call her mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course. I should be quite wretched if papa were going to\r\nmarry any one else; but I love Miss Rose dearly, and I am very glad\r\nshe is coming to us. I think it is very good of her, and papa thinks\r\nso too."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Sophy honestly, "and so do I; for I am sure I shouldn\'t\r\nlike to leave papa and mamma and go away off there to live, though I\r\ndo like you very much, Elsie, and your papa too. Only think! he is\r\ngoing to be my brother; and then won\'t you be some sort of relation\r\ntoo? I guess I\'ll be your aunt, won\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I haven\'t thought about it," said Elsie; while at the\r\nsame instant Harold put his head in at the half-open door, saying, "Of\r\ncourse you will; and I\'ll be her uncle."\r\n\r\nThe little girls were quite startled at first, but seeing who it was,\r\nElsie ran towards him, holding out her hand.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Harold?" she said; "I am glad to see you."\r\n\r\nHe had his satchel of books on his arm. "Thank you, how are you? I\r\nam rejoiced to see you looking so well, but, as for me, I am quite\r\nsick--of lessons," he replied in a melancholy tone, and putting on a\r\ncomically doleful expression.\r\n\r\nElsie laughed and shook her head. "I thought you ware a good boy and\r\nquite fond of your books."\r\n\r\n"Commonly, I believe I am, but not in these wedding times. It\'s quite\r\ntoo bad of your father, Elsie, to be carrying off Rose, when he won\'t\r\nlet us have you. But never mind, I\'ll be even with him some of these\r\ndays;" and he gave her a meaning look.\r\n\r\n"Come in Harold, and put your books down," said Sophy; "you can afford\r\nto spend a few minutes talking to Elsie, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I think I will!" he replied, accepting her invitation.\r\n\r\nThey chatted for some time, and then Adelaide came in. Elsie had heard\r\nthat she was coming on to be first bridesmaid. "Elsie, dear, how\r\nglad I am to see you! and how well and happy you are looking!" she\r\nexclaimed, folding her little niece in her arms, and kissing her\r\nfondly. "But come," she added, taking her by the hand and leading her\r\ninto the next room, "Miss Rose came in from her shopping only a few\r\nminutes ago, and she wants to see you."\r\n\r\nRose was standing by the toilet-table, gazing intently, with a blush\r\nand a smile, at something she held in her hand. She laid it down as\r\nthey came in, and embracing the little girl affectionately, said how\r\nvery glad she was to see her.\r\n\r\nThen, turning to the table again, she took up what she had been\r\nlooking at--which proved to be a miniature of Mr. Dinsmore--and\r\nhanded it to Adelaide, saying, "Is it not excellent? and so kind and\r\nthoughtful of him to give it to me."\r\n\r\n"It is indeed a most perfect likeness," Adelaide replied. "Horace is\r\nvery thoughtful about these little matters. I hope he will make you\r\nvery happy, dear Rose. I cannot tell you how glad I was when I heard\r\nyou were to be my sister."\r\n\r\n"You have seemed like a sister to me ever since the winter I spent\r\nwith you," said Rose. And then she began questioning Elsie about her\r\njourney asking if she were not fatigued, and would not like to lie\r\ndown and rest a little before tea.\r\n\r\n"No thank you," Elsie said; "you know it is only a short trip from New\r\nYork, and I am not at all tired."\r\n\r\nJust then the tea-bell rang, and Rose laughed and said it was well\r\nElsie had not accepted her invitation.\r\n\r\nOn going down to tea they found Mr. Dinsmore and Mr. Travilla there.\r\nElsie was delighted to meet her old friend, and it was evident that he\r\nhad already made himself a favorite with all the children, from Harold\r\ndown to little May.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was a really brilliant affair. The bride and her\r\nattendants were beautifully dressed and, as every one remarked, looked\r\nvery charming. At an early hour in the morning carriages were in\r\nwaiting to convey the bridal party and the family to the church where\r\nthe ceremony was to be performed. When it was over they returned to\r\nthe house, where an elegant breakfast was provided for a large number\r\nof guests; after which there was a grand reception for several hours.\r\nThen, when the last guest had departed, Rose retired to her own room,\r\nappearing shortly afterwards at the family dinner-table in her pretty\r\ntravelling dress, looking very sweet and engaging, but sober and\r\nthoughtful, as were also her father and brothers; while Mrs. Allison\'s\r\neyes were constantly filling with tears at the thought of losing her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nThere was very little eating done, and the conversation flagged\r\nseveral times in spite of the efforts of the gentlemen to keep it up.\r\nAt length all rose from the table, and gathered in the parlor for\r\na few moments. Then came the parting, and they were gone; and Mrs.\r\nAllison, feeling almost as if she had buried her daughter, tried to\r\nforget her loss by setting herself vigorously to work overseeing the\r\nbusiness of putting her house in order.\r\n\r\nRose\'s feelings were mingled. She wept for a time, but the soothing\r\ntenderness of her husband\'s manner, and Elsie\'s winning caresses, soon\r\nrestored her to herself, and smiles chased away the tears.\r\n\r\nThey had a very pleasant journey, without accident or detention, and\r\narrived in due time at their own home, where they were welcomed with\r\nevery demonstration of delight.\r\n\r\nRose was charmed with the Oaks, thought it even more lovely than\r\neither Roselands or Elingrove, and Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie intensely\r\nenjoyed her pleasure and admiration.\r\n\r\nThen came a round of parties, which Elsie thought extremely tiresome,\r\nas she could have no share in them, and was thus deprived of the\r\ncompany of her papa and mamma almost every evening for several weeks.\r\nBut at last that too was over, and they settled down into a quiet,\r\nhome life, that suited them all much better, for neither Mr. Dinsmore\r\nnor Rose was very fond of gayety.\r\n\r\nAnd now Elsie resumed her studies regularly, reciting as before to\r\nher father; while Rose undertook to instruct her in the more feminine\r\nbranches of housekeeping and needlework, and a master came from the\r\ncity several times a week to give her lessons in music and drawing.\r\nShe had been so long without regular employment that she found it very\r\ndifficult at first to give her mind to her studies, as she had done\r\nin former days; but her father, though kind and considerate, was\r\nvery firm with her, and she soon fell into the traces and worked as\r\ndiligently as ever.\r\n\r\nElsie did not find that her father\'s marriage brought any\r\nuncomfortable change to her. There was no lessening of his love or\r\ncare; she saw as much of him as before, had full possession of her\r\nseat upon his knee, and was caressed and fondled quite as often and as\r\ntenderly as ever.\r\n\r\nAnd added to all this were Rose\'s love and sweet companionship, which\r\nwere ever grateful to the little girl, whether they were alone or with\r\nher father. Elsie loved her new mamma dearly and was as respectful\r\nand obedient to her as to her father, though Rose never assumed any\r\nauthority; which, however, was entirely unnecessary, as a wish or\r\nrequest from her was sure to be attended to as if it had been a\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nAnd Rose was very happy in her new home. Mr. Dinsmore\'s family were\r\npleased with the match and treated her most kindly, while he was\r\nalways affectionate, thoughtful, and attentive; not less devoted as\r\na husband than as a father. They were well suited in taste and\r\ndisposition; seldom had the slightest disagreement on any subject, and\r\nneither had ever cause to regret the step they had taken, for each day\r\nthey lived together seemed but to increase their love for each other,\r\nand for their little daughter, as Mr. Dinsmore delighted to call her,\r\nalways giving Rose a share in the ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  Of all the joys that brighten suffering earth\r\n  What joy is welcomed like a new-born child?\r\n\r\n  --MRS. NORTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Massa wants you for to come right along to him in de study, darlin\',\r\njis as soon as your ole mammy kin get you dressed," said Chloe, one\r\nmorning to her nursling.\r\n\r\n"What for, mammy?" Elsie asked curiously, for she noticed an odd\r\nexpression on her nurse\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Massa didn\'t tell me nuffin \'bout what he wanted, an\' I spects you\'ll\r\nhave to az hisself," replied Chloe evasively.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s curiosity was excited, and she hastened to the study as soon\r\nas possible. Her father laid down his paper as she entered, and held\r\nout his hand with a smile as he bade her good-morning, and it struck\r\nher that there was an odd twinkle in his eye also, while she was\r\ncertain that she could not be mistaken in the unusually joyous\r\nexpression of his countenance.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, papa. But where is mamma?" she asked, glancing about\r\nthe room in search of her.\r\n\r\n"She is not up yet, but do you sit down here in your little rocking\r\nchair. I have something for you."\r\n\r\nHe left the room as he spoke, returning again in a moment, carrying\r\nwhat Elsie thought was a strange-looking bundle.\r\n\r\n"There! hold out your arms," he said; and placing it in them, he\r\ngently raised one corner of the blanket, displaying to her astonished\r\nview a tiny little face.\r\n\r\n"A baby! Oh, the dear little thing!" she exclaimed in tones of\r\nrapturous delight. Then looking up into his face, "Did you say I might\r\nhave it, papa? whose baby is it?"\r\n\r\n"Ours; your mamma\'s and my son, and your brother," he answered, gazing\r\ndown with intense pleasure at her bright, happy face, sparkling all\r\nover with delight.\r\n\r\n"My little brother! my darling little brother," she murmured looking\r\ndown at it again, and venturing to press her lips gently to its soft\r\nvelvet cheek. "Oh, papa, I am so glad, so glad! I have so wanted a\r\nlittle brother or sister. Is not God very good to give him to us,\r\npapa?" And happy, grateful tears were trembling in the soft eyes as\r\nshe raised them to his face again.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, bending down and kissing first her cheek, and then the\r\nbabe\'s, "I feel that God has indeed been very good to me in bestowing\r\nupon me two such treasures as these."\r\n\r\n"What is his name, papa?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"He has none yet, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Then, papa, do let him be named Horace, for you; won\'t you if mamma\r\nis willing? And then I hope he will grow up to be just like you; as\r\nhandsome and as good."\r\n\r\n"I should like him to be a great deal better, daughter," he answered\r\nwith a grave smile; "and about the name--I don\'t know yet; I should\r\nprefer some other, but your mamma seems to want that, and I suppose\r\nshe has the best right to name him; but we will see about it."\r\n\r\n"Better give little marster to me now, Miss Elsie," remarked his\r\nnurse, stepping up, "I reckon your little arms begin to feel tired."\r\nAnd taking the babe she carried him from the room.\r\n\r\nNothing could have better pleased Mr. Dinsmore than Elsie\'s joyous\r\nwelcome to her little brother; though it was scarcely more than he had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n"My own darling child; my dear, dear little daughter," he said, taking\r\nher in his arms and kissing her again and again. "Elsie, dearest, you\r\nare very precious to your father\'s heart."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I know it," she replied, twining her arms about his neck,\r\nand laying her cheek to his; "I know you love me dearly, and it makes\r\nme so very happy."\r\n\r\n"May I go in to see mamma?" she asked presently.\r\n\r\n"No, darling, not yet; she is not able to see you; but she sends her\r\nlove, and hopes she may be well enough to receive a visit from you\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Poor mamma! I am sorry she is ill," she said sorrowfully; "but I will\r\ntry to keep everything very quiet that she may not be disturbed."\r\n\r\nThat evening, after tea, Elsie was told that she would be allowed to\r\nspeak to her mamma for a moment if she chose, and she gladly availed\r\nherself of the privilege.\r\n\r\n"Dear Elsie," Rose whispered, drawing Her down to kiss her cheek, "I\r\nam so glad you are pleased with your little brother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, he is such a dear little fellow!" Elsie answered eagerly;\r\n"and now, if you will only get well we will be happier than ever."\r\n\r\nRose smiled and said she hoped soon to be quite well again, and then\r\nMr. Dinsmore led Elsie from the room.\r\n\r\nRose was soon about again and in the enjoyment of her usual health and\r\nstrength. Elsie\'s delight knew no bounds the first time her mamma\r\nwas able to leave her room, and take her place at the table with her\r\nfather and herself. She doted on her little brother, and, if allowed,\r\nwould have had him in her arms more than half the time; but he was a\r\nplump little fellow, and soon grew so large and heavy that her father\r\nforbade her carrying him lest she should injure herself; but she would\r\nromp and play with him by the hour while he was in the nurse\'s arms,\r\nor seated on the bed; and when any of her little friends called, she\r\ncould not be satisfied to let them go away without seeing the baby.\r\n\r\nThe first time Mr. Travilla called, after little Horace\'s arrival, she\r\nexhibited her treasure to him with a great deal of pride, asking if he\r\ndid not envy her papa.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, looking admiringly at her, and then turning away with\r\na half sigh.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards he caught hold of her, set her on his knee,\r\nand giving her a kiss, said, "I wish you were ten years older, Elsie,\r\nor I ten years younger."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Travilla?" she asked rather wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, because we would then be nearer of an age, and maybe you would\r\nlike me better."\r\n\r\n"No, I wouldn\'t, not a bit," she said, putting her arm round his neck,\r\n"for I like you now just as well as I could like any gentleman but\r\npapa."\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Dinsmore was very proud of his little grandson and made\r\na great pet of him, coming to the Oaks much more frequently after his\r\nbirth than before.\r\n\r\nOnce he spoke of him as his first grandchild.\r\n\r\n"You forget Elsie, father," said Horace, putting his arm round his\r\nlittle girl, who happened to be standing by his side, and giving her a\r\ntender, loving look.\r\n\r\nHe greatly feared that the marked difference his father made between\r\nthe two would wound Elsie\'s sensitive spirit, and perhaps even arouse\r\na feeling of jealousy towards her little brother; therefore, when his\r\nfather was present, he was even more than usually affectionate in his\r\nmanner towards her, if that were possible.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie had no feeling of the kind; she had long ceased to expect\r\nany manifestation of affection from her grandfather towards herself,\r\nbut was very glad indeed that he could love her dear little brother.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! to be sure, I did forget Elsie," replied the old gentleman\r\ncarelessly; "she is the first grandchild of course; but this fellow is\r\nthe first grandson, and quite proud of him I am. He is a pretty boy,\r\nand is going to be the very image of his father."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will, father," said Rose, looking proudly at her husband.\r\nAnd then she added, with an affectionate glance at Elsie: "If he is\r\nonly as good and obedient as his sister, I shall be quite satisfied\r\nwith him. We could not ask a better child than our dear little\r\ndaughter, nor love one more than we do her; she is a great comfort and\r\nblessing to us both."\r\n\r\nThe color mounted to Elsie\'s cheek, and her eyes beamed with pleasure.\r\nMr. Dinsmore, too, looked very much gratified, and the old gentleman\r\ncould not fail to perceive that the difference he made between the\r\nchildren was quite distasteful to both parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded,\r\n  A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.\r\n\r\n  --BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nElsie was nearly twelve when her little brother was born. During the\r\nnext three years she led a life of quiet happiness, unmarked by any\r\nstriking event. There were no changes in the little family at the Oaks\r\nbut such as time must bring to all. Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore perhaps\r\nlooked a trifle older than when they married, Elsie was budding into\r\nwomanhood as fair and sweet a flower as ever was seen, and the baby\r\nhad grown into a healthy romping boy.\r\n\r\nAt Roselands, on the contrary, there had been many and important\r\nchanges. Louise and Lora were both married; the former to a resident\r\nof another State, who had taken her to his distant home; the latter to\r\nEdward Howard, an older brother of Elsie\'s friend Carrie. They had not\r\nleft the neighborhood, but were residing with his parents.\r\n\r\nFor the last two or three years Arthur Dinsmore had spent his\r\nvacations at home; he was doing so now, having just completed his\r\nfreshman year at Princeton. On his return Walter was to accompany him\r\nand begin his college career.\r\n\r\nMiss Day left soon after Lora\'s marriage and no effort had been made\r\nto fill her place, Adelaide having undertaken to act as governess to\r\nEnna, now the only remaining occupant of the school-room.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of an unusually cool breezy afternoon, Elsie rode\r\nover to Tinegrove, Mr. Howard\'s plantation--to make a call. She found\r\nthe family at home and was urged to stay to tea; but declined, saying\r\nshe could not without permission, and had not asked it.\r\n\r\n"You will at least take off your hat," said Carrie.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," Elsie answered, "it is not worth while, as I must go\r\nso soon. If you will excuse me, I can talk quite as well with it on."\r\n\r\nThey had not met for several weeks and found a good deal to say to\r\neach other. At length Elsie drew out her watch.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" she exclaimed, "I have overstayed my time! I had no idea it was\r\nso late--you have been so entertaining; but I must go now." And she\r\nrose hastily to take leave.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" said her Aunt Lora in whose boudoir they were sitting,\r\n"there is no such great hurry, I am sure. You\'ll get home long before\r\ndark."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and might just as well stay another five or ten minutes. I wish\r\nyou would; for I have ever so much to say to you," urged Carrie.\r\n\r\n"It would be very pleasant, thank you, but indeed I must not. See how\r\nthe shadows are lengthening, and papa does not at all like to have me\r\nout after sunset unless he is with me."\r\n\r\n"He always was overcareful of you, erring on the right side, I\r\nsuppose, if that be an allowable expression," laughed Lora, as she and\r\nCarrie followed Elsie to the door to see her mount her horse.\r\n\r\nThe adieus were quickly spoken and the young girl, just touching the\r\nwhip to the sleek side of her pony, set off at a gallop, closely\r\nfollowed by her faithful attendant Jim.\r\n\r\nSeveral miles of rather a lonely road lay between them and home, and\r\nno time was to be lost, if they would reach the Oaks while the sun was\r\nstill above the horizon.\r\n\r\nThey were hardly more than half a mile from the entrance to the\r\ngrounds, when Elsie caught sight of a well-known form slowly moving\r\ndown the road a few paces ahead of them. It was Arthur, and she soon\r\nperceived that it was his intention to intercept her; he stopped,\r\nturning his face toward her, sprang forward as she came up, and seized\r\nher bridle.\r\n\r\n"Stay a moment, Elsie," he said, "I want to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"Then come on to the Oaks, and let us talk there; please do, for I am\r\nin a hurry."\r\n\r\n"No, I prefer to say my say where I am. I\'ll not detain you long. You\r\nkeep out of earshot, Jim. I want to borrow a little money, Elsie; a\r\ntrifle of fifty dollars or so. Can you accommodate me?"\r\n\r\n"Not without papa\'s knowledge, Arthur. So I hope you do not wish to\r\nconceal the matter from him."\r\n\r\n"I do. I see no reason why he should know all my private affairs.\r\nCan\'t you raise that much without applying to him? Isn\'t your\r\nallowance very large now?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty dollars a month, Arthur, but subject to the same conditions as\r\nof old. I must account to papa for every cent."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you more than that in hand now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but what do you want it for?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s neither your business nor his; let me have it for two weeks,\r\nI\'ll pay it back then, and in the meantime he need know nothing about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I cannot; I never have any concealments from papa, and I must give in\r\nmy account in less than a week."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You are and always were the most disobliging creature\r\nalive!" returned Arthur with an oath.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Arthur, how can you say such wicked words," she said, recoiling\r\nfrom him with a shudder. "And you quite misjudge me. I would be glad\r\nto do anything for you that is right. If you will let me tell papa\r\nyour wish, and he gives consent, you shall have the money at once. Now\r\nplease let me go. The sun has set and I shall be so late that papa\r\nwill be anxious and much displeased."\r\n\r\n"Who cares if he is!" he answered roughly, still retaining his hold\r\nupon her bridle, and compelling her to listen while he continued to\r\nurge his request; enforcing it with arguments and threats.\r\n\r\nThey were alike vain, she steadfastly refused to grant it except on\r\nthe conditions she had named, and which he determinately rejected--and\r\ninsisted being left free to pursue her homeward way.\r\n\r\nHe grew furious, and at length with a shocking oath released her\r\nbridle, but at the same instant struck her pony a severe blow upon his\r\nhaunches, with a stout stick he held in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe terrified animal, smarting with the pain, started aside, reared\r\nand plunged in a way that would have unseated a less skilful rider,\r\nand had nearly thrown Elsie from the saddle: then darted off at the\r\ntop of its speed; but fortunately turned in at the gate held open by\r\nJim, who had ridden on ahead and dismounted for that purpose.\r\n\r\n"Whoa, you Glossy! whoa dere!" he cried, springing to the head of the\r\nexcited animal, and catching its bridle in his powerful grasp.\r\n\r\n"Just lead her for a little, Jim," said Elsie "There, there! my poor\r\npretty Glossy, be quiet now. It was too cruel to serve you so; but\r\nit shan\'t happen again if your mistress can help it," she added in a\r\nvoice tremulous with sympathy and indignation, patting and stroking\r\nher pony caressingly as she spoke.\r\n\r\nJim obeyed, walking on at a brisk pace, leading Glossy with his right\r\nhand, and keeping the bridle of the other horse over his left arm.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk the rest of the way, Jim," said Elsie presently, "just stop\r\nher and let me get down. There," springing lightly to the ground, "you\r\nmay lead them both to the stable now."\r\n\r\nShe hurried forward along the broad, gravelled winding carriage road\r\nthat led to the house. The next turn brought her face to face with her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"What, Elsie! alone and on foot at this late hour?" he said in a tone\r\nof mingled surprise and reproof.\r\n\r\n"I have been riding, papa, and only a moment since dismounted and let\r\nJim lead the horses down the other road to the stables."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but how did you come to be so late?" he asked, drawing her hand\r\nwithin his arm and leading her onward.\r\n\r\n"I have been to Tinegrove, sir, and Aunt Lora, Carrie, and I found so\r\nmuch to say to each other, that the time slipped away before I knew\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"It must not happen again, Elsie."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean it shall, papa, and I am very sorry."\r\n\r\n"Then I excuse you this once, daughter; it is not often you give me\r\noccasion to reprove you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, papa," she said with a grateful, loving look. "Did you\r\ncome out in search of me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your mamma and I had begun to grow anxious lest some accident\r\nhad befallen you. Our little daughter is such a precious treasure that\r\nwe must needs watch over her very carefully," he added in a tone that\r\nwas half playful, half tender, while he pressed the little gloved\r\nhand in his, and his eyes rested upon the sweet fair face with an\r\nexpression of proud fatherly affection.\r\n\r\nHer answering look was full of filial reverence and love. "Dear papa,\r\nit is so nice to be so loved and cared for; so sweet to hear such\r\nwords from your lips. I do believe I\'m the very happiest girl in the\r\nland." She had already almost forgotten Arthur and his rudeness and\r\nbrutality.\r\n\r\n"And I the happiest father," he said with a pleased smile. "Ah, here\r\ncomes mamma to meet as with little Horace."\r\n\r\nThe child ran forward with a glad shout to meet his sister, Rose met\r\nher with loving words and a fond caress; one might have thought from\r\ntheir joyous welcome, that she was returning after an absence of\r\nweeks or months instead of hours. Letting go her father\'s arm as they\r\nstepped upon the piazza Elsie began a romping play with her little\r\nbrother, but at a gentle reminder from her mamma that the tea bell\r\nwould soon ring, ran away to her own apartments to have her riding\r\nhabit changed for something more suitable for the drawing room.\r\n\r\nChloe was in waiting and her skilful hands made rapid work, putting\r\nthe last touches to her nursling\'s dress just as the summons to the\r\nsupper table was given.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was quite as fastidious as in former days in regard to\r\nthe neatness and tastefulness of Elsie\'s attire.\r\n\r\n"Will I do, papa?" she asked, presenting herself before him, looking\r\nvery sweet and fair in a simple white dress with blue sash and\r\nribbons.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said with a satisfied smile, "I see nothing amiss with\r\ndress, hair, or face."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I," said Rose, leading the way to the supper room, "Aunt Chloe\r\nis an accomplished tirewoman. But come, let us sit down to our meal\r\nand have it over."\r\n\r\nOn their return to the drawing room they, found Mr. Travilla\r\ncomfortably ensconced in an easy chair, reading the evening paper. He\r\nwas an almost daily visitor at the Oaks, and seldom came without some\r\nlittle gift for one or both of his friend\'s children. It was for Elsie\r\nto-night. When the usual greetings had been exchanged, he turned to\r\nher, saying, "I have brought you a treat. Can you guess what it is?"\r\n\r\n"A book!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, there must be something of the Yankee about you," he answered,\r\nlaughing. "Yes, it is a book in two volumes; just published and a\r\nmost delightful, charming story," he went on, drawing them from his\r\npockets, and handing them to her as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, sir!" she cried with eager gratitude, "I\'m so glad,\r\nif--if only papa will allow me to read it. May I, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I can tell better when I have examined it, my child," Mr. Dinsmore\r\nanswered, taking one of the volumes from her hands and looking at the\r\ntitle on the back. "\'The Wide, Wide World!\' What sort of a book is it,\r\nTravilla?"\r\n\r\n"A very good sort. I think. Just glance through it or read a few\r\npages, and I\'m pretty sure it will be sufficient to satisfy you of,\r\nnot only its harmlessness, but that its perusal would be a benefit to\r\nalmost any one."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore did so, Elsie standing beside him, her hand upon his arm,\r\nand her eyes on his face--anxiously watching its changes of expression\r\nas he read. They grew more and more satisfactory; the book was\r\nevidently approving itself to his taste and judgment, and presently\r\nhe returned it to her, saying, with a kind fatherly smile, "Yes, my\r\nchild, you may read it. I have no doubt it deserves all the praise Mr.\r\nTravilla has given it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, papa, I\'m very glad," she answered joyously, "I am\r\njust hungry for a nice story." And seating herself near the light, she\r\nwas soon lost to everything about her in the deep interest with which\r\nshe was following Ellen Montgomery through her troubles and trials.\r\n\r\nShe was loath to lay the book aside when at the usual hour--a quarter\r\nbefore nine--the bell rang for prayers. She hardly heeded the summons\r\ntill her papa laid his hand on her shoulder, saying, "Come, daughter,\r\nyou must not be left behind."\r\n\r\nShe started up then, hastily closing the book, and followed the others\r\nto the dining room, where the servants were already assembled to take\r\npart in the family devotions.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla went away immediately after and now it was Elsie\'s\r\nbed-time. Her father reminded her of it as, on coming back from seeing\r\nhis friend to the door, he found her again poring over the book.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, it is so interesting! could you let me finish this\r\nchapter?" she asked with a very entreating look up into his face as he\r\nstood at her side.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I could if I should make a great effort," he answered\r\nlaughingly. "Yes, you may, for once, but don\'t expect always to be\r\nallowed to do so."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, oh, no. Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, have you come to a good stopping-place?" he asked, as she\r\npresently closed the book and put it aside with a slight sigh.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, it is just as bad a one as the other. Papa, I wish I was\r\ngrown up enough to read another hour before going to bed."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," he said, drawing her to a seat upon his knee, and passing\r\nhis arm about her waist, "I\'m not ready to part with my little girl\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t a fine young lady daughter be just as good or better?" she\r\nasked, giving him a hug.\r\n\r\n"No, not now, some of these days I may think so."\r\n\r\n"But mayn\'t I stay up and read till ten to-night?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. "Till half-past nine, then?"\r\n\r\n"No, not even a till quarter past. Ah, it is that now," he added,\r\nconsulting his watch.\r\n\r\n"You must say good-night and go. Early hours and plenty of sleep for\r\nmy little girl, that she may grow up to healthful, vigorous womanhood,\r\ncapable of enjoying life and being very useful in the church and the\r\nworld." He kissed her with grave tenderness as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Good-night then, you dear father," she said, returning the caress. "I\r\nknow you would indulge me if you thought it for my good."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I would, pet. Would it help to reconcile you to the denial\r\nof your wish to know that I shall be reading the book, and probably\r\nenjoying it as much as you would?"\r\n\r\n"Ah yes, indeed, papa! it is a real pleasure to resign it to you," she\r\nanswered with a look of delight. "It\'s just the nicest story! at least\r\nas far as I\'ve read. Read it aloud to mamma, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if she wishes to hear it. Now away with you to your room and\r\nyour bed."\r\n\r\nOnly waiting to bid her mamma an affectionate good-night, Elsie\r\nobeyed, leaving the room with a light step, and a cheerful, happy\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Dear unselfish child!" her father said, looking after her.\r\n\r\n"She is that indeed," said Rose. "How happy, shall I be if Horace\r\ngrows up to be as good and lovable."\r\n\r\nElsie was a fearless horsewoman, accustomed to the saddle from her\r\nvery early years. Thus Arthur\'s wanton attack upon her pony had failed\r\nto give her nerves the severe shock it might have caused to those of\r\nmost young girls of her age. Her feeling was more of excitement,\r\nand of indignation at the uncalled-for cruelty to a dumb animal,\r\nespecially her own pet horse, than of fright at the danger to herself.\r\nBut she well knew that the latter was what her father would think of\r\nfirst, and that he would be very angry with Arthur; therefore she had\r\ntried, and successfully, to control herself and suppress all signs of\r\nagitation on meeting him upon her return.\r\n\r\nShe felt glad now as the affair recurred to her recollection while\r\npreparing for the night\'s rest, that she had been able to do so. For a\r\nmoment she questioned with herself whether she was quite right to have\r\nthis concealment from her father, but quickly decided that she was.\r\nHad the wrong-doing been her own--that would have made it altogether\r\nanother matter.\r\n\r\nShe was shocked at Arthur\'s wickedness, troubled and anxious about his\r\nfuture, but freely forgave his crime against her pony and herself,\r\nand mingled with her nightly petitions an earnest prayer for his\r\nconversion, and his welfare temporal and spiritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  O love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,\r\n  And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign.\r\n\r\n  --DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of the forenoon, and Elsie in her own pretty little\r\nsitting room was busied with her books; so deep in study indeed, that\r\nshe never noticed a slight girlish figure as it glided in at the glass\r\ndoors opening upon the lawn, to-day set wide to admit the air coming\r\nfresh and cool with a faint odor of the far-off sea, pleasantly\r\nmingling with that of the flowers in the garden, on the other side of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n"Buried alive in her books! Dear me! what a perfect paragon of\r\nindustry you are," cried the intruder in a lively tone. "I wish you\r\nwould imbue me with some of your love of study."\r\n\r\n"Why, Lucy Carrington! how did you get here?" and Elsie pushed her\r\nbooks away, rose hastily and greeted her friend with an affectionate\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n"How? I came in through yonder door, miss; after riding my pony\r\nfrom Ashlands to the front entrance of this mansion," replied Lucy,\r\ncourtesying low in mock reverence. "I hope your ladyship will excuse\r\nthe liberty I have taken in venturing uninvited into your sanctum."\r\n\r\n"Provided your repentance is deep and sincere," returned Elsie in the\r\nsame jesting tone.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, I solemnly pledge myself never to do it again till the\r\nnext time."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, won\'t you?" and Elsie pushed forward a low rocking chair.\r\n"It\'s so pleasant to see you. But if I had thought about it at all\r\nI should have supposed you were at home, and as busy over books and\r\nlessons as I."\r\n\r\n"No; my respected governess, Miss Warren, not feeling very well, has\r\ntaken a week\'s holiday, and left me to do the same. Fancy my afflicted\r\nstate at the thought of laying aside my beloved books for seven or\r\neight whole days."\r\n\r\n"You poor creature! how I pity you," said Elsie, laughing; "suppose\r\nyou stay here and share the instructions of my tutor; I have no doubt\r\nI could persuade him to receive you as a pupil."\r\n\r\n"Horrors! I\'m much obliged, very much, but I should die of fright the\r\nfirst time I had to recite. There, I declare I\'m growing poetical,\r\ntalking in rhyme all the time."\r\n\r\n"Let mammy take your hat and scarf," said Elsie. "You\'ll stay and\r\nspend the day with me, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no; I came to carry you off to Ashlands to spend a week.\r\nWill you come?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to, dearly well, if papa gives permission."\r\n\r\n"Well, run and ask him."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t; unfortunately he is out, and not expected to return till\r\ntea-time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw! how provoking! But can\'t your mamma give permission just\r\nas well?"\r\n\r\n"If it were only for a day she might, but I know she would say the\r\nquestion of a longer visit must be referred to papa."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I wouldn\'t be you for something. Why, I never ask leave of\r\nanybody when I want to pay a visit anywhere in the neighborhood. I\r\ntell mamma I\'m going, and that\'s all-sufficient. I don\'t see how you\r\nstand being ordered about and controlled so."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll believe me," said Elsie, laughing a gay, sweet, silvery\r\nlaugh, "I really enjoy being controlled by papa. It saves me a deal of\r\ntrouble and responsibility in the way of deciding for myself; and then\r\nI love him so dearly that I almost always feel it my greatest pleasure\r\nto do whatever pleases him."\r\n\r\n"And he always was so strict with you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is strict; but oh, so kind."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s just because you\'re so good; he\'d have an awful time\r\nruling me. I\'d be in a chronic state of disgrace and punishment; and\r\nhe obliged to be so constantly improving me and frowning sternly upon\r\nmy delinquencies that he\'d never be able to don a smile of approval or\r\nslip in a word of praise edgewise."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you\'re not half so bad as you pretend," said Elsie, laughing\r\nagain; "nor I half so good as you seem determined to believe me."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve no doubt that you\'re an arch hypocrite, and we shall find\r\nout one of these days that you are really worse than any of the rest\r\nof us. But now I must finish my errand and go, for I know you\'re\r\nlonging to be at those books. Do you get a ferruling every time you\r\nmiss a word?--and enjoy the pain because it pleases papa to inflict\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy, how can you be so ridiculous?" and a quick, vivid blush\r\nmounted to Elsie\'s very hair.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, Elsie, dear, I had no business to say such a\r\nthing," cried Lucy, springing up to throw her arms round her friend\r\nand kiss her warmly; "but of course it was nothing but the merest\r\nnonsense. I know well enough your papa never does anything of the\r\nkind."\r\n\r\n"No; if my lessons are not well prepared they have to be learned over\r\nagain, that is all; and if I see that papa is displeased with me, I\r\nassure you it is punishment enough."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he\'ll let you accept my invitation?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, indeed, Lucy. I think he will hardly like to have me\r\ngive up my studies for that length of time, and in fact I hardly like\r\nto do so myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must come. You can practise on my piano every day for an hour\r\nor two, if you like. We\'ll learn some duets. And you can bring your\r\nsketch-book and carry it along when we walk or ride, as we shall\r\nevery day. And we might read some improving books together,--you and\r\nHerbert, and I. He is worse again, poor fellow! so that some days he\r\nhardly leaves his couch even to limp across the room, and it\'s partly\r\nto cheer him up that we want you to come. There\'s nothing puts him\r\ninto better spirits than a sight of your face."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t expect other company?"\r\n\r\n"No, except on our birthday; but then we\'re going to have a little\r\nparty, just of our own set,--we boys and girls that have grown up--or\r\nare growing up--together, as one may say. Oh, yes, I want to have\r\nCarrie Howard, Mary Leslie, and Enna stay a day or two after the\r\nparty. Now coax your papa hard, for we must have you," she added,\r\nrising to go.\r\n\r\n"That would be a sure way to make him say no," said Elsie, smiling;\r\n"he never allows me to coax or tease; at least, not after he has once\r\nanswered my request."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t think of it. Good-bye. No, don\'t waste time in coming to\r\nsee me off, but go back to your books like a good child. I mean to\r\nhave a little chat with your mamma before I go."\r\n\r\nElsie returned to her lessons with redoubled energy. She was longing\r\nto become more intimately acquainted with Ellen Montgomery, but\r\nresolutely denied herself even so much as a peep at the pages of the\r\nfascinating story-book until her allotted tasks should be faithfully\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThese, with her regular daily exercise in the open air, filled up the\r\nmorning; there was a half hour before, and another after dinner, which\r\nshe could call her own; then two hours for needlework, music, and\r\ndrawing, and she was free to employ herself as she would till\r\nbed-time.\r\n\r\nThat was very apt to be in reading, and if the weather was fine she\r\nusually carried her book to an arbor at some distance from the house.\r\nIt was reached by a long shaded walk that led to it from the lawn, on\r\nwhich the glass doors of her pretty boudoir opened. It was a cool,\r\nbreezy, quiet spot, on a terraced hillside, commanding a lovely view\r\nof vale, river, and woodland, and from being so constantly frequented\r\nby our heroine, had come to be called by her name,--"Elsie\'s Arbor."\r\nArthur, well acquainted with these tastes and habits, sought, and\r\nfound her here on the afternoon of this day--found her so deeply\r\nabsorbed in Miss Warner\'s sweet story that she was not aware of his\r\napproach--so full of sympathy for little Ellen that her tears were\r\ndropping upon the page as she read.\r\n\r\n"What, crying, eh?" he said with a sneer, as he seated himself by her\r\nside, and rudely pulled one of her curls, very much as he had been\r\nused to do years ago. "Well, I needn\'t be surprised, for you always\r\nwere the greatest baby I ever saw."\r\n\r\n"Please let my hair alone, Arthur; you are not very polite in either\r\nspeech or action," she answered, brushing away her tears and moving a\r\nlittle farther from him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not worth while to waste politeness on you. What\'s that you\'re\r\nreading?"\r\n\r\n"A new book Mr. Travilla gave me."\r\n\r\n"Has no name, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'Wide, Wide World.\'"\r\n\r\n"Some namby-pamby girl\'s story, I s\'pose, since you\'re allowed to read\r\nit; or are you doing it on the sly?"\r\n\r\n"No, I never do such things, and hope I never shall; papa gave me\r\npermission."\r\n\r\n"Oh; ah! then I haven\'t got you in my power: wish I had."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because I might turn it to good account. I know you are as afraid as\r\ndeath of Horace."\r\n\r\n"No, I am not!" dried Elsie indignantly, rich color rushing all over\r\nher fair face and neck; "for I know that he loves me dearly and if I\r\nhad been disobeying or deceiving him I would far sooner throw myself\r\non his mercy than on yours."\r\n\r\n"You would, eh? How mad you are; your face is as red as a beet. A\r\npretty sort of Christian you are, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not perfect, Arthur; but you mustn\'t judge of religion by me."\r\n\r\n"I shall, though. Don\'t you wish I\'d go away?" he added teasingly,\r\nagain snatching at her curls.\r\n\r\nBut she eluded his grasp, and rising, stood before him with an air of\r\ngentle dignity. "Yes," she said, "since you ask me, I\'ll own that I\r\ndo. I don\'t know why it is that, though your manners are polished when\r\nyou choose to make them so, you are always rude and ungentlemanly to\r\nme when you find me alone. So I shall be very glad if you\'ll just go\r\naway and leave me to solitude and the enjoyment of my book."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do so when I get ready; not a minute sooner. But you can get rid\r\nof me just as soon as you like. I see you take. Yes, I want that money\r\nI asked you for yesterday, and I am bound to have it."\r\n\r\n"Arthur, my answer must be just the same that it was then; I can give\r\nyou no other."\r\n\r\n"You\'re the meanest girl alive! To my certain knowledge you are worth\r\nat least a million and a half, and yet you refuse to lend me the\r\npitiful sum of fifty dollars."\r\n\r\n"Arthur, you know I have no choice in the matter. Papa has forbidden\r\nme to lend you money without his knowledge and consent, and I cannot\r\ndisobey him."\r\n\r\n"When did he forbid you?"\r\n\r\n"A long while ago; and though he has said nothing about it lately, he\r\nhas told me again and again that his commands are always binding until\r\nhe revokes them."\r\n\r\n"Fifteen years old, and not allowed to do as you please even with\r\nyour pocket money!" he said contemptuously. "Do you expect to be in\r\nleading-strings all your life?"\r\n\r\n"I shall of course have control of my own money matters on coming of\r\nage; but I expect to obey my father as long as we both live," she\r\nanswered, with gentle but firm decision.\r\n\r\n"Do you have to show your balance in hand when you give in your\r\naccount?"\r\n\r\n"No; do you suppose papa cannot trust my word?" she answered, somewhat\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n"Then you could manage it just as easily as not. There\'s no occasion\r\nfor him to know whether your balance in hand is at that moment in your\r\npossession or mine; as I told you before, I only want to borrow it for\r\ntwo weeks. Come, let me have it. If you don\'t, the day will come when\r\nyou\'ll wish you had."\r\n\r\nShe repeated her refusal; he grew very angry and abusive, and at\r\nlength went so far as to strike her.\r\n\r\nA quick step sounded on the gravel walk, a strong grasp was laid on\r\nArthur\'s arm, he felt himself suddenly jerked aside and flung upon\r\nhis knees, while a perfect rain of stinging, smarting blows descended\r\nrapidly upon his back and shoulders.\r\n\r\n"There, you unmitigated scoundrel, you mean, miserable caitiff; lay\r\nyour hand upon her again if you dare!" cried Mr. Travilla, finishing\r\nthe castigation by applying the toe of his boot to Arthur\'s nether\r\nparts with a force that sent him reeling some distance down the walk,\r\nto fall with a heavy thud upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe lad rose, white with rage, and shook his fist at his antagonist.\r\n"I\'ll strike her when I please," he said with an oath, "and not be\r\ncalled to account by you for it either; she\'s my niece, and nothing to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll defend her nevertheless, and see to it that you come to grief if\r\nyou attempt to harm her in any way whatever. Did he hurt you much, my\r\nchild?" And Mr. Travilla\'s tone changed to one of tender concern as he\r\nturned and addressed Elsie, who had sunk pale and trembling upon the\r\nrustic seat where Arthur had found her.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, but I fear you have hurt him a good deal, in your kind zeal\r\nfor my defence," she answered, looking after Arthur, as he limped away\r\ndown the path.\r\n\r\n"I have broken my cane, that is the worst of it," said her protector\r\ncoolly, looking regretfully down at the fragment he still held in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"You must have struck very hard, and oh, Mr. Travilla, what if he\r\nshould take it into his head to challenge you?" and Elsie turned pale\r\nwith terror.\r\n\r\n"Never fear; he is too arrant a coward for that; he knows I am a good\r\nshot, and that, as the challenged party, I would have the right to\r\nthe choice of weapons."\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t fight, Mr. Travilla? you do not approve of\r\nduelling?"\r\n\r\n"So, no indeed, Elsie; both the laws of God and of the land are\r\nagainst it, and I could not engage in it either as a good citizen or a\r\nChristian."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am so glad of that, and that you came to my rescue; for I was\r\nreally growing frightened, Arthur seemed in such a fury with me."\r\n\r\n"What was it about?"\r\n\r\nElsie explained, then asked how he had happened to come to her aid.\r\n\r\n"I had learned from the servants that your father and mother were both\r\nout, so came here in search of you," he said. "As I drew near I saw\r\nthat Arthur was with you, and not wishing to overhear your talk, I\r\nwaited at a little distance up there on the bank, watching you through\r\nthe trees. I perceived at once that he was in a towering passion, and\r\nfearing he would ill-treat you in some way, I held myself in readiness\r\nto come to your rescue; and when I saw him strike you, such a fury\r\nsuddenly came over me that I could not possibly refrain from thrashing\r\nhim for it."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Travilla, you will not tell papa?" she said entreatingly.\r\n\r\n"My child, I am inclined to think he ought to hear of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why need he? It would make him very angry with Arthur."\r\n\r\n"Which Arthur richly deserves. I think your father should know, in\r\norder that he may take measures for your protection. Still, if you\r\npromise not to ride or walk out alone until Arthur has left the\r\nneighborhood, it shall be as you wish. But you must try to recover\r\nyour composure, or your papa will be sure to ask the cause of your\r\nagitation. You are trembling very much, and the color has quite\r\nforsaken your cheeks."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try," She said, making a great effort to control herself, "and I\r\ngive you the promise."\r\n\r\n"This is a very pleasant place to sit with book or work," he remarked,\r\n"but I would advise you not even to come here alone again till Arthur\r\nhas gone."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir, I think I shall follow your advice. It will be only a\r\nfew weeks now till he and Walter both go North to college."\r\n\r\n"I see you have your book with you," he said, taking it up from the\r\nseat where it lay. "How do you like it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, so much! How I pity poor Ellen for having such a father, so\r\ndifferent from my dear papa; and because she had to be separated from\r\nher mamma, whom she loved so dearly. I can\'t read about her troubles\r\nwithout crying, Mr. Travilla."\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you a secret," he said, smiling; "I shed some tears\r\nover it myself." Then he went on talking with her about the different\r\ncharacters of the story, thus helping her to recover her composure by\r\nturning her thoughts from herself and Arthur.\r\n\r\nWhen, half an hour later, a servant came to summon her to the house,\r\nwith the announcement that her father had returned and was ready to\r\nhear her recitations, all signs of agitation had disappeared; she had\r\nceased to tremble, and her fair face was as sweet, bright, and rosy as\r\nits wont.\r\n\r\nShe rose instantly on hearing the summons. "You\'ll excuse me, I know,\r\nMr. Travilla. But will you not go in with me? We are always glad to\r\nhave you with us. I have no need to tell you that, I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," he said, "but I must return to Ion now. I shall walk to\r\nthe house with you though, if you will permit me," he added, thinking\r\nthat Arthur might be still lurking somewhere within the grounds.\r\n\r\nShe answered gayly that she would be very glad of his company. She had\r\nlost none of her old liking for her father\'s friend, and was wont to\r\ntreat him with the easy and affectionate familiarity she might have\r\nused had he been her uncle.\r\n\r\nThey continued their talk till they had reached the lawn at the side\r\nof the house on which her apartments were; then he turned to bid her\r\ngood-bye.\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged!" she said, taking his offered hand, and looking up\r\nbrightly into his face.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, fair lady; but am I to be dismissed without any reward for\r\nmy poor services?"\r\n\r\n"I have none to offer, sir knight, but you may help yourself if you\r\nchoose," she said, laughing and blushing, for she knew very well what\r\nhe meant.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and snatched a kiss from her ruby lips, then walked away\r\nsighing softly to himself, "Ah, little Elsie, if I were but ten years\r\nyounger!"\r\n\r\nShe tripped across the lawn, and entering the open door of her\r\nboudoir, found herself in her father\'s arms. He had witnessed the\r\nlittle scene just enacted between Mr. Travilla and herself, had\r\nnoticed something in his friend\'s look and manner that had never\r\nstruck him before. He folded his child close to his heart for an\r\ninstant then held her off a little, gazing fondly into her face.\r\n\r\n"You are mine; you belong to me; no other earthly creature has the\r\nleast shadow of a right or title in you; do you know that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, and rejoice to know it," she murmured, putting her arms\r\nabout his neck and laying her head against his breast.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said, sighing, "you will not always be able to say that, I\r\nfear. One of these days you will--" He broke off abruptly, without\r\nfinishing his sentence.\r\n\r\nShe looked up inquiringly into his face.\r\n\r\nHe answered her look with a smile and a tender caress. "I had better\r\nnot put the nonsense into your head: it will get there soon enough\r\nwithout my help. Come now, let us have the lessons. I expect to find\r\nthem well prepared, as usual."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, papa," she answered, bringing her books and seating\r\nherself on a stool at his feet, he having taken possession of an\r\neasy-chair.\r\n\r\nThe recitations seemed a source of keen enjoyment to both; the one\r\nloving to impart, and the other to receive, knowledge.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore gave the deserved meed of warm praise for the faithful\r\npreparation of each allotted task, prescribed those for the coming\r\nday, and the books were laid aside.\r\n\r\n"Come here, daughter," he said, as she closed her desk upon them, "I\r\nhave something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"What is it, papa?" she asked, seating herself upon his knee. "How\r\nvery grave you look." But there was not a touch of the old fear in her\r\nface or voice, as there had been none in his of the old sternness.\r\n\r\n"Yes, for I am about to speak of a serious matter," he answered,\r\ngently smoothing back the clustering curls from her fair brow, while\r\nhe looked earnestly into the soft brown eyes. "You have not been\r\nlending money to Arthur, Elsie?"\r\n\r\nThe abrupt, unexpected question startled her, and a crimson tide\r\nrushed over her face and neck; but she returned her father\'s gaze\r\nsteadily: "No, papa; how could you think I would disobey so?"\r\n\r\n"I did not, darling, and yet I felt that I must ask the question\r\nand repeat my warning, my command to you--never to do so without my\r\nknowledge and consent. Your grandfather and I are much troubled about\r\nthe boy."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry, papa; I hope he has not been doing anything very bad."\r\n\r\n"He seems to have sufficient cunning to hide many of his evil deeds,"\r\nMr. Dinsmore said, with a sigh; "yet enough has come to light to\r\nconvince us that he is very likely to become a shame and disgrace to\r\nhis family. We know that he is profane, and to some extent, at\r\nleast, intemperate and a gambler. A sad, sad beginning for a boy of\r\nseventeen. And to furnish him with money, Elsie, would be only to\r\nassist him in his downward course."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I see that. Poor grandpa, I\'m so sorry for him! But, papa,\r\nGod can change Arthur\'s heart, and make him all we could wish."\r\n\r\n"Yes, daughter, and we will agree together to ask Him to do this great\r\nwork, so impossible to any human power; shall we not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa." They were silent a moment; then she turned to him again,\r\ntold of Lucy Carrington\'s call and its object, and asked if she might\r\naccept the invitation.\r\n\r\nHe considered a moment. "Yes," he said kindly, "you may if you wish.\r\nYou quite deserve a holiday, and I think perhaps would really be the\r\nbetter of a week\'s rest from study. Go and enjoy yourself as much as\r\nyou can, my darling."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, you dearest, kindest, and best of papas," she said, giving\r\nhim a hug and kiss. "But I think you look a little bit sorry. You\r\nwould rather I should stay at home, if I could content myself to do\r\nso, and it would be a strange thing if I could not."\r\n\r\n"No, my pet, I shall miss you, I know; the house always seems lonely\r\nwithout you; but I can spare you for a week, and would rather have you\r\ngo, because I think the change will do you good. Besides, I am willing\r\nto lend my treasure for a few days to our friends at Ashlands. I\r\nwould gladly do more than that, if I could, for that poor suffering\r\nHerbert."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  How many pleasant faces shed their light on every side.\r\n\r\n  --TUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Remember it is for only one week; you must be back again next\r\nWednesday by ten o\'clock; I can\'t spare you an hour longer," Mr.\r\nDinsmore said, as the next morning, shortly after breakfast, he\r\nassisted his daughter to mount her pony.\r\n\r\n"Ten o\'clock at night, papa?" asked Elsie in a gay, jesting tone, as\r\nshe settled herself in the saddle, and took a little gold-mounted\r\nriding whip from his hand.\r\n\r\n"No, ten A.M., precisely."\r\n\r\n"But what if it should be storming, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Then come as soon as the storm is over."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; and may I come sooner if I get homesick?"\r\n\r\n"Just as soon as you please. Now, good-bye, my darling. Don\'t go into\r\nany danger. I know I need not remind you to do nothing your father\r\nwould disapprove."\r\n\r\n"I hope not, papa," she said, with a loving look into the eyes that\r\nwere gazing so fondly upon her. Then kissing her hand to him and her\r\nmamma and little Horace, who stood on the veranda to see her off, she\r\nturned her horse\'s head and cantered merrily away, taking the road to\r\nAshlands on passing out at the gate.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, breezy morning, and her heart felt so light and\r\ngay that a snatch of glad song rose to her lips. She warbled a few\r\nbird-like notes, then fell to humming softly to herself.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance down the road a light wagon was rumbling along,\r\ndriven by one of the man-servants from the Oaks, and carrying Aunt\r\nChloe and her young mistress\' trunks.\r\n\r\n"Come, Jim," said Elsie, glancing over her shoulder at her attendant\r\nsatellite, "we must pass them. Glossy and I are in haste to-day. Ah,\r\nmammy, are you enjoying your ride?" she called to her old nurse as she\r\ncantered swiftly by.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dat I is, honey!" returned the old woman. Then sending a loving,\r\nadmiring look after the retreating form so full of symmetry and grace,\r\n"My bressed chile!" she murmured, "you\'s beautiful as de mornin\', your\r\nole mammy tinks, an\' sweet as de finest rose in de garden; bright an\'\r\nhappy as de day am long, too."\r\n\r\n"De beautifullest in all de country, an\' de finest," chimed in her\r\ncharioteer.\r\n\r\nThe young people at Ashlands were all out on the veranda enjoying the\r\nfresh morning air--Herbert lying on a lounge with a book in his hand;\r\nHarry and Lucy seated on opposite sides of a small round table and\r\ndeep in a game of chess; two little fellows of six and eight--John and\r\nArchie by name--were spinning a top.\r\n\r\n"There she is! I had almost given her up; for I didn\'t believe that\r\nold father of hers would let her come," cried Lucy, catching sight of\r\nGlossy and her rider just entering the avenue; and she sprang up in\r\nsuch haste as to upset half the men upon the board.\r\n\r\n"Hollo! see what you\'ve done!" exclaimed Harry. "Why, it\'s Elsie, sure\r\nenough!" and he hastily followed in the wake of his sister, who had\r\nalready flown to meet and welcome her friend; while Herbert started up\r\nto a sitting posture, and looked enviously after them.\r\n\r\n"Archie, John," he called, "one of you please be good enough to hand\r\nme my crutch and cane. Dear me, what a thing it is to be a cripple!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get \'em, Herbie, this minute! Don\'t you try to step without\r\n\'em," said Archie, jumping up to hand them.\r\n\r\nBut Elsie had already alighted from her horse with Harry\'s assistance,\r\nand shaken hands with him, returned Lucy\'s rapturous embrace as warmly\r\nas it was given, and stepped upon the veranda with her before Herbert\r\nwas fairly upon his feet. As she caught sight of him she hurried\r\nforward, her sweet face full of tender pity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t try to come to meet me, Herbert," she said, holding out her\r\nlittle gloved hand; "I know your poor limb is worse than usual, and\r\nyou, must not exert yourself for an old friend like me."\r\n\r\n"Ah," he said, taking the offered hand, and looking at its owner with\r\na glad light in his eyes, "How like you that is, Elsie! You always\r\nwere more thoughtful of others than any one else I ever knew. Yes, my\r\nlimb is pretty bad just now; but the doctor thinks he\'ll conquer the\r\ndisease yet; at least so far as to relieve me of the pain I suffer."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, indeed. How patiently you have borne it all these long\r\nyears," she answered with earnest sympathy of tone and look.\r\n\r\n"So he has; he deserves the greatest amount of credit for it," said\r\nLucy, as John and Archie in turn claimed Elsie\'s attention for a\r\nmoment. "But come now, let me take you to mamma and grandma, and then\r\nto your own room. Aunt Chloe and your luggage will be along presently,\r\nI suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are coming up the avenue now."\r\n\r\nLucy led the way to a large pleasant, airy apartment in one of the\r\nwings of the building, where they found Mrs. Carrington busily\r\noccupied in cutting out garments for her servants, her parents Mr. and\r\nMrs. Norris with her, the one reading a newspaper, the other knitting.\r\nAll three gave the young guest a very warm welcome. She was evidently\r\na great favorite with the whole family.\r\n\r\nThese greetings and the usual mutual inquiries in regard to the health\r\nof friends and relatives having been exchanged, Elsie was next carried\r\noff by Lucy to the room prepared for her special use during her stay\r\nat Ashlands. It also was large, airy, and cheerful, on the second\r\nfloor--opening upon a veranda on one side, on the other into a similar\r\napartment occupied by Lucy herself. Pine India matting, furniture of\r\nsome kind of yellow grained wood, snowy counterpanes, curtains and\r\ntoilet covers gave them both an air of coolness and simple elegance,\r\nwhile vases of fresh flowers upon the mantels shed around a slight but\r\ndelicious perfume.\r\n\r\nOf course the two girls were full of lively, innocent chat. In the\r\nmidst of it Elsie exclaimed, "Oh, Lucy! I have just the loveliest book\r\nyou ever read! a present from Mr. Travilla the other day, and I\'ve\r\nbrought it along. Papa had begun it, but he is so kind he insisted I\r\nshould bring it with me; and so I did."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m glad! we haven\'t had anything new in the story-book line for\r\nsome time. Have you read it yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Partly; but it is worth reading several times; and I thought we would\r\nenjoy it all together--one reading aloud."\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'tis just the thing! I\'m going to help mamma to-day with the\r\nsewing, and a nice book read aloud will make it quite enjoyable. We\'ll\r\nhave you for reader, Elsie, if you are agreed."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we take turns sewing and reading? I\'d like to help your\r\nmamma, too."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; well, we\'ll see. Herbert\'s a good reader, and I daresay\r\nwill be glad to take his turn at it too. Ah, here comes your baggage\r\nand Aunt Chloe following it. Here, Bob and Jack," to the two stalwart\r\nblack fellows who were carrying the trunk, "set it in this corner. How\r\nd\'ye do, Aunt Chloe?"\r\n\r\n"Berry well, tank you, missy," replied the old nurse, dropping a\r\ncourtesy. "I\'se berry glad to see you lookin\' so bright dis here\r\nmornin\'."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Now make yourself at home and take good care of your young\r\nmistress."\r\n\r\n"Dat I will, missy; best I knows how. Trus\' dis chile for dat."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s riding habit was quickly exchanged for a house dress, her\r\nhair made smooth and shining as its wont, and securing her book she\r\nreturned with Lucy to the lower veranda, where they found Herbert\r\nstill extended upon his sofa.\r\n\r\nHis face brightened at sight of Elsie. He had laid aside his book, and\r\nwas at work with his knife upon a bit of soft pine wood. He whiled\r\naway many a tedious hour by fashioning in this manner little boxes,\r\nwhistles, sets of baby-house furniture, etc., etc., for one and\r\nanother of his small friends. Books, magazines, and newspapers filled\r\nup the larger portion of his time, but could not occupy it all, for,\r\nas he said, he must digest his mental food, and he liked to have\r\nemployment for his fingers while doing so.\r\n\r\n"Please be good enough to sit where I can look at you without too\r\ngreat an effort, won\'t you?" he said, smiling up into Elsie\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if that will afford you any pleasure," she answered lightly, as\r\nLucy beckoned to a colored girl, who stepped forward and placed a low\r\nrocking chair at the side of the couch.\r\n\r\n"There, that is just right. I can have a full view of your face by\r\nmerely raising my eyes," Herbert said with satisfaction, as Elsie\r\nseated herself in it. "What, you have brought a book?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," and while Elsie went on to repeat the substance of what she\r\nhad told Lucy, the latter slipped away to her mamma\'s room to make\r\narrangements about the work, and ask if they would not all like to\r\ncome and listen to the reading.\r\n\r\n"Is it the kind of book to interest an old body like me?" asked Mrs.\r\nNorris.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, grandma; but Elsie says Mr. Travilla and her papa were\r\nboth delighted with it. Mr. Dinsmore, though, had not read the whole\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go and try it for a while then," said Mr. Morris, laying\r\ndown his paper. "If our little Elsie is to be the reader, I for one am\r\npretty sure to enjoy listening, her voice is so sweet-toned and her\r\nenunciation so clear and distinct."\r\n\r\n"That\'s you, grandpa!" cried Lucy, clapping her hands in applause.\r\n"Yes, you\'d better all come, Elsie is to be the reader at the start;\r\nshe says she does not mind beginning the story over again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrington began gathering up her work, laying the garments\r\nalready cut out in a large basket, which was then carried by her maid\r\nto the veranda. In a few moments Elsie had quite an audience gathered\r\nabout her, ere long a deeply interested one; scissors or needle had\r\nnow and again to be dropped to wipe away a falling tear, and the voice\r\nof the reader needed steadying more than once or twice. Then Herbert\r\ntook his turn at the book, Elsie hers with the needle, Mrs. Carrington\r\nhalf reluctantly yielding to her urgent request to be allowed to\r\nassist them.\r\n\r\nSo the morning, and much of the afternoon also, passed most\r\npleasantly, and not unprofitably either. A walk toward sundown, and\r\nafterward a delightful moonlight ride with Harry Carrington and\r\nWinthrop Lansing, the son of a neighboring planter, finished the\r\nday, and Elsie retired to her own room at her usual early hour. Lucy\r\nfollowed and kept her chatting quite a while, for which Elsie\'s tender\r\nconscience reproached her somewhat; yet she was not long in falling\r\nasleep after her head had once touched her pillow.\r\n\r\nThe next day was passed in a similar manner, still more time being\r\ngiven to the reading, as they were able to begin it earlier: yet the\r\nbook was not finished; but on the morning of the next day, which was\r\nFriday, Lucy proposed that, if the plan was agreeable to Elsie, they\r\nshould spend an hour or two in a new amusement; which was no other\r\nthan going into the dominions of Aunt Viney, the cook, and assisting\r\nin beating eggs and making cake.\r\n\r\nElsie was charmed with the idea, and it was immediately carried out,\r\nto the great astonishment of Chloe, Aunt Viney, and all her sable\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\n"Sho, Miss Lucy! what fo\' you go for to fotch de company right yere\r\ninto dis yere ole dirty kitchen?" cried Aunt Viney, dropping a hasty\r\ncourtesy to Elsie, then hurrying hither and thither in the vain effort\r\nto set everything to rights in a moment of time. "Clar out o\' yere,\r\nyou, Han an\' Scip," she cried, addressing two small urchins of dusky\r\nhue and driving them before her as she spoke, "dere aint no room yere\r\nfo\' you, an\' kitchens aint no place for darkies o\' your size or sect.\r\nI\'ll fling de dishcloth at yo\' brack faces ef yo\' comes in agin fo\'\r\nyou sent for. I \'clare Miss Elsie, an\' Miss Lucy, dose dirty niggahs\r\nmake sich a muss in yere, dere aint a char fit for you to set down\r\nin," she continued, hastily cleaning two, and wiping them with her\r\napron. "I\'se glad to see you, ladies, but ef I\'d knowed you was\r\na-comin\' dis kitchen shu\'d had a cleanin\' up fo\' shuah."\r\n\r\n"You see, Aunt Viney, you ought to keep it in order, and then you\r\nwould be ready for visitors whenever they happened to come," said Lucy\r\nlaughingly. "Why, you\'re really quite out of breath with whisking\r\nabout so fast. We\'ve come to help you."\r\n\r\nThe fat old negress, still panting from her unwonted exertions,\r\nstraightened herself, pushed back her turban, and gazed in round-eyed\r\nwonder upon her young mistress.\r\n\r\n"What! Missy help ole Aunt Viney wid dose lily-white hands? Oh, go\r\n\'long! you\'s jokin\' dis time fo\' shuah."\r\n\r\n"No indeed; we want the fun of helping to make some of the cake for\r\nto-morrow. You know we want ever so many kinds to celebrate our two\r\nbirthdays."\r\n\r\n"Two birthdays, Miss Lucy? yo\'s and Massa Herbert\'s? Yes, dat\'s it; I\r\ndon\'t disremember de day, but I do disremember de age."\r\n\r\n"Sixteen; and now we\'re going to have a nice party to celebrate the\r\nday, and you must see that the refreshments are got up in your very\r\nbest style."\r\n\r\n"So I will, Miss Lucy, an\' no \'casion for you and Miss Elsie to\r\ntrouble yo\' young heads \'bout de makin\' ob de cakes an\' jellies an\'\r\ncustards an\' sich. Ole Aunt Viney can \'tend to it all."\r\n\r\n"But we want the fun of it," persisted Lucy; "we want to try our hands\r\nat beating eggs, rolling sugar, sifting flour, etc., etc. I\'ve got a\r\ngrand new receipt book here, and we\'ll read out the recipes to you,\r\nand measure and weigh the materials, and you can do the mixing and\r\nbaking."\r\n\r\n"Yes, missy, you\' lily hands no\' hab strength to stir, an\' de fire\r\nspoil yo\' buful \'plexions for shuah."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve brought mamma\'s keys," said Lucy; "come along with us to the\r\nstore-room, Aunt Viney, and I\'ll deal out the sugar, spices, and\r\nwhatever else you want."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Lucy; but \'deed I don\'t need no help. You\'s berry kind, but\r\nole Viney kin do it all, an\' she\'ll have eberything fus\'-rate fo\' de\r\nyoung gemmen an\' ladies."\r\n\r\n"But that isn\'t the thing, auntie; you don\'t seem to understand. Miss\r\nElsie and I want the fun, and to learn to cook, too. Who knows but we\r\nmay some day have to do our own work?"\r\n\r\n"Bress de Lord, Miss Lucy, how you talk, honey!" cried the old\r\nnegress, rolling up her eyes in horror at the thought.\r\n\r\n"Take care; Miss Elsie will think you very wicked if you use such\r\nexclamations as that."\r\n\r\n"Dat wrong, you t\'ink, missy?" asked Aunt Viney, turning to the young\r\nvisitor, who had gone with them to the store-room, and was assisting\r\nLucy in the work of measuring and weighing the needed articles.\r\n\r\n"I think it is," she answered gently; "we should be very careful\r\nnot to use the sacred name lightly. To do so is to break the third\r\ncommandment."\r\n\r\n"Den, missy, dis ole gal won\'t neber do it no more."\r\n\r\nChloe had been an excellent cook in her young days, and had not\r\nforgotten or lost her former skill in the preparation of toothsome\r\ndainties. She, too, came with offers of assistance, and the four were\r\nsoon deep in the mysteries of pastry, sweetmeats, and confections.\r\nNovelty gave it an especial charm to the young ladies, and they grew\r\nvery merry and talkative, while their ignorance of the business in\r\nhand, the odd mistakes they fell into in consequence, and the comical\r\nquestions they asked, gave much secret amusement to the two old\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n"What\'s this pound cake to be mixed up in, Aunt Viney?" asked Lucy.\r\n\r\n"In dis yere tin pan, missy."\r\n\r\n"Is it clean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, missy, it\'s clean; but maybe \'taint suffishently clean, I\'ll\r\nwash it agin."\r\n\r\n"How many kinds of cake shall we make?" asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n"Every kind that Chloe and Aunt Viney can think of and know how\r\nto make well. Let me see--delicate cake, gold, silver and clove,\r\nfruitcake, sponge, and what else?"\r\n\r\n"Mammy makes delicious jumbles."\r\n\r\n"Will you make us some, Aunt Chloe?"\r\n\r\nChloe signified her readiness to do whatever was desired, and began at\r\nonce to collect her implements.\r\n\r\n"Got a rollin\' pin, Aunt Viney?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be shuah, a revoltin\' roller, de very bes\' kind. No, Miss\r\nElsie, don\' mix de eggs dat way, you spile \'em ef you mix de yaller\r\nall up wid de whites. An\' Miss Lucy, butter an\' sugar mus\' be worked\r\nup togedder fus\', till de butter resolve de sugah, \'fore we puts de\r\nudder gredinents in."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see we have a good deal to learn before we can hope to rival\r\nyou as cooks, Aunt Viney," laughed Lucy.\r\n\r\n"I spec\' so, missy; you throw all de gredinents in togedder, an\'\r\ntumble your flouah in all at once, an\' you nebber get your cake nice\r\nan light."\r\n\r\nThey had nearly reached the end of their labors when sounds as of\r\nscuffling, mingled with loud boyish laughter, and cries of "That\'s it,\r\nScip, hit him again! Pitch into him, Han, and pay him off well for\r\nit!" drew them all in haste to the window and door.\r\n\r\nThe two little darkies who had been ejected from the kitchen, were\r\ntussling in the yard, while their young masters, John and Archie,\r\nlooked on, shaking with laughter, and clapping their hands in noisy\r\nglee.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this racket about?" asked Grandpa Norris, coming out upon\r\nthe veranda, newspaper in hand, Herbert limping along by his side.\r\n\r\n"The old feud between Roman and Carthaginian, sir," replied John.\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you mean, child?"\r\n\r\n"Hannah Ball waging a war on Skipio, you know, sir."\r\n\r\n"History repeating itself, eh?" laughed Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s an old joke, Archie," said his grandfather. "And you\'re\r\ntoo big a rogue to set them at such work. Han and Scip, stop that at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  "All your attempts\r\n  Shall fall on me like brittle shafts on armor."\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy came into Elsie\'s room early the next morning to show her\r\nbirthday gifts, of which she had received one or more from every\r\nmember of her family. They consisted of articles of jewelry, toilet\r\nornaments, and handsomely-bound books.\r\n\r\nThey learned on meeting Herbert at breakfast that he had fared quite\r\nas well as his sister. Elsie slipped a valuable ring on Lucy\'s finger\r\nand laid a gold pencil-case beside Herbert\'s plate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, charming! a thousand thanks, mon ami!" cried Lucy, her eyes\r\nsparkling with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I shall value it most highly; especially for the giver\'s\r\nsake," said Herbert, examining his with a pleased look, then turning\r\nto her with a blush and joyous smile, "I am so much better this\r\nmorning that I am going out for a drive. Won\'t you and Lucy give me\r\nthe added pleasure of your company?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I can answer for myself that I\'ll be very happy to do so."\r\n\r\n"I, too," said Lucy. "It\'s a lovely morning for a ride. We\'ll make up\r\na party and go, but we must be home again in good season; for Carrie\r\nand Enna promised to come to dinner. So I\'m glad we finished the book\r\nyesterday, though we were all so sorry to part from little Ellen."\r\n\r\nThey turned out quite a strong party; Herbert and the ladies filling\r\nup the family carriage, while Harry on horseback, and John and Archie\r\neach mounted upon a pony, accompanied it, now riding alongside, now\r\nspeeding on ahead, or perchance dropping behind for a time as suited\r\ntheir fancy.\r\n\r\nThey travelled some miles, and alighting in a beautiful grove, partook\r\nof a delicate lunch they had brought with them. Then, while Herbert\r\nrested upon the grass the others wandered hither and thither until it\r\nwas time to return. They reached home just in season to receive their\r\nexpected guests.\r\n\r\nCarrie Howard was growing up very pretty and graceful; womanly in her\r\nways, yet quite unassuming in manner, frank and sweet in disposition,\r\nshe was a general favorite with old and young, and could already boast\r\nof several suitors for her hand.\r\n\r\nEnna Dinsmore, now in her fourteenth year, though by some considered\r\neven prettier, was far less pleasing--pert, forward, and conceited as\r\nshe had been in her early childhood; she was tall for her age, and\r\nwith her perfect self-possession and grown-up air and manner, might\r\nbe easily mistaken for seventeen. She had already more worldly wisdom\r\nthan her sweet, fair niece would ever be able to attain, and was, in\r\nher own estimation at least, a very stylish and fashionable young\r\nlady. She assumed very superior airs toward Elsie when her brother\r\nHorace was not by, reproving, exhorting, or directing her; and was\r\nvery proud of being usually taken by strangers for the elder of the\r\ntwo. Some day she would not think that a feather in her cap.\r\n\r\nElsie had lost none of the childlike simplicity of five years ago;\r\nit still showed itself in the sweet, gentle countenance, the quiet\r\ngraceful carriage, equally removed from forwardness on the one hand,\r\nand timid self-consciousness on the other. She did not consider\r\nherself a personage of importance, yet was not troubled by her\r\nsupposed insignificance; in fact seldom thought of self at all, so\r\nengaged was she in adding to the happiness of others.\r\n\r\nThe four girls were gathered in Lucy\'s room. She had been showing her\r\nbirthday presents to Carrie and Enna.\r\n\r\n"How do you like this style of arranging the hair, girls?" asked the\r\nlatter, standing before a mirror, smoothing and patting, and pulling\r\nout her puffs and braids. "It\'s the newest thing out. Isabel Carleton\r\njust brought it from New York. I saw her with hers dressed so, and\r\nsent Delia over to learn how."\r\n\r\nDelia was Miss Enna\'s maid, and had been brought along to Ashlands\r\nthat she might dress her young lady\'s hair in this new style for the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n"It\'s pretty," said Lucy. "I think I\'ll have Minerva dress mine so for\r\nto-night, and see how it becomes me."\r\n\r\n"Delia can show her how," said Enna. "Don\'t you like it, Carrie?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, but if you\'ll excuse me for saying so, it strikes me as\r\nrather grown up for a young lady of thirteen," answered Carrie in a\r\ngood-naturedly bantering tone.\r\n\r\nEnna colored and looked vexed. "I\'m nearly fourteen," she replied with\r\na slight toss of the head; "and I overheard Mrs. Carleton saying to\r\nmamma the other day, that with my height and finished manners I might\r\npass anywhere for seventeen."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so; of course, knowing your age, I can\'t judge so well how it\r\nwould strike a stranger."\r\n\r\n"I see you have gone back to the old childish way of arranging your\r\nhair. What\'s that for?" asked Enna, turning to Elsie; "I should\r\nthink it was about time you were beginning to be a little womanly in\r\nsomething."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not in dress or the arrangement of my hair. So papa says,\r\nand of course I know he is right."\r\n\r\n"He would not let you have it up in a comb?"\r\n\r\n"No," Elsie answered with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Why do you smile? Did he say anything funny when you showed yourself\r\nthat day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Elsie, have you tried putting up your hair?" asked Carrie; while\r\nLucy exclaimed, "Try it again to-night, Elsie, I should like to see\r\nhow you would look."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elsie, answering Carrie\'s query first. "Enna persuaded me\r\none day to have mammy do it up in young-lady fashion. I liked it right\r\nwell for a change, and that was just what mamma said when I went into\r\nthe drawing-room and showed myself to her. But when papa came in, he\r\nlooked at me with a comical sort of surprise in his face, and said.\r\n\'Come here; what have you been doing to yourself?\' I went to him and\r\nhe pulled out my comb, and ordered me off to mammy to have my hair\r\narranged again in the usual way, saying, \'I\'m not going to have you\r\naping the woman already; don\'t alter the style of wearing your hair\r\nagain, till I give you permission.\'\r\n\r\n"And you walked off as meek as Moses, and did his bidding," said Enna\r\nsarcastically. "No man shall ever rule me so. If papa should undertake\r\nto give me such an order, I\'d just inform him that my hair was my own,\r\nand I should arrange it as suited my own fancy."\r\n\r\n"I think you are making yourself out worse than you really are,\r\nEnna," said Elsie gravely. "I am sure you could never say anything so\r\nextremely impertinent as that to grandpa."\r\n\r\n"Impertinent! Well, if you believe it necessary to be so very\r\nrespectful, consistency should lead you to refrain from reproving your\r\naunt."\r\n\r\n"I did not exactly mean to reprove you, Enna, and you are younger than\r\nI."\r\n\r\n"Nobody would think it," remarked Enna superciliously and with a\r\nsecond toss of her head, as she turned from the glass; "you are so\r\nextremely childish in every way, while, as mamma says, I grow more\r\nwomanly in appearance and manner every day."\r\n\r\n"Elsie\'s manners are quite perfect, I think," said Carrie; "and her\r\nhair is so beautiful, I don\'t believe any other style of arrangement\r\ncould improve its appearance in the least."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s so childish, so absurdly childish! just that great mass of\r\nringlets hanging about her neck and shoulders. Come, Elsie, I want you\r\nto have it dressed in this new style for to-night."\r\n\r\n"No, Enna, I am perfectly satisfied to wear it in this childish\r\nfashion; and if I were not, still I could not disobey papa."\r\n\r\nEnna turned away with a contemptuous sniff, and Lucy proposed that\r\nthey should go down to the drawing-room, and try some new music she\r\nhad just received, until it should be time to dress for the evening.\r\n\r\nHerbert lay on a sofa listening to their playing. "Lucy," he said in\r\none of the pauses, "what amusements are we to have to-night?--anything\r\nbeside the harp, piano, and conversation?"\r\n\r\n"Dancing, of course. Cad\'s fiddle will provide as good music as any\r\none need care for, and this room is large enough for all who will be\r\nhere. Our party is not to be very large, you know."\r\n\r\n"And Elsie, for one, is too pious to dance," sneered Enna.\r\n\r\nElsie colored, but remained silent.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I did not think of that!" cried Lucy. "Elsie, do you really think\r\nit is a sinful amusement?"\r\n\r\n"I think it wrong to go to balls; at least that it would be wrong for\r\nme, a professed Christian, Lucy."\r\n\r\n"But this will not be a ball, and we\'ll have nothing but quiet country\r\ndances, or something of that sort, no waltzing or anything at all\r\nobjectionable. What harm can there be in jumping about in that way\r\nmore than in another?"\r\n\r\n"None that I know of," answered Elsie, smiling. "And I certainly shall\r\nnot object to others doing as they like, provided I am not asked to\r\ntake part in it."\r\n\r\n"But why not take part, if it is not wrong?" asked Harry, coming in\r\nfrom the veranda.\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t you know she never does anything without asking the\r\npermission of papa?" queried Enna tauntingly. "But where\'s the use of\r\nconsulting her wishes in the matter, or urging her to take part in the\r\nwicked amusement?--she\'ll have to go to bed at nine o\'clock, like any\r\nother well-trained child, and we\'ll have time enough for our dancing\r\nafter that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Elsie, must you?--must you really leave us at that early hour?\r\nWhy, that\'s entirely too bad!" cried the others in excited chorus.\r\n\r\n"I shall stay up till ten," answered Elsie quietly, while a deep flush\r\nsuffused her cheek.\r\n\r\n"That is better, but we shall not know how to spare you even that\r\nsoon," said Harry. "Couldn\'t you make it eleven?--that would not be so\r\nvery late just for once."\r\n\r\n"No, for she can\'t break her rules, or disobey orders. If she did,\r\npapa would be sure to find it out and punish her when she gets home."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Enna! that\'s quite too bad!" cried Carrie and Lucy in a\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s color deepened, and there was a flash of anger and scorn in\r\nher eyes as she turned for an instant upon Enna. Then she replied\r\nfirmly, though with a slight tremble of indignation in her tones: "I\r\nam not ashamed to own that I do find it both a duty and a pleasure to\r\nobey my father, whether he be present or absent. I have confidence,\r\ntoo, in both his wisdom and his love for me. He thinks early hours of\r\ngreat importance, especially to those who are young and growing, and\r\ntherefore he made it a rule that I shall retire to my room and begin\r\nmy preparations for bed by nine o\'clock. But he gave me leave to stay\r\nup an hour later to-night, and I intend to do so."\r\n\r\n"I think you are a very good girl, and feel just right about it," said\r\nCarrie.\r\n\r\n"I wish he had said eleven, I think he might this once," remarked\r\nLucy. "Why, don\'t you remember he let you stay up till ten Christmas\r\nEve that time we all spent the holidays at Roselands, which was five\r\nyears ago?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Elsie, "but this is Saturday night, and as to-morrow is\r\nthe Sabbath, I should not feel it to be right to stay up later, even\r\nif I had permission."\r\n\r\n"Why not? it isn\'t Sunday till twelve," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"No, but I should be apt to oversleep myself, and be dull and drowsy\r\nin church next morning."\r\n\r\n"Quite a saint!" muttered Enna, shrugging her shoulders and marching\r\noff to the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go and select some flowers for our hair," said Lucy,\r\nlooking at her watch. "\'Twill be tea-time presently, and we\'ll want to\r\ndress directly after."\r\n\r\n"You always were such a dear good girl," whispered Carrie Howard,\r\nputting her arm about Elsie\'s waist as they left the room.\r\n\r\nEnna was quite gorgeous that evening, in a bright-colored silk,\r\ntrimmed with multitudinous flounces and many yards of ribbon and gimp.\r\nThe young damsel had a decidedly gay taste, and glanced somewhat\r\ncontemptuously at Elsie\'s dress of simple white, albeit \'twas of the\r\nfinest India muslin and trimmed with costly lace. She wore her pearl\r\nnecklace and bracelets, a broad sash of rich white ribbon; no other\r\nornaments save a half-blown moss rosebud at her bosom, and another\r\namid the glossy ringlets of her hair, their green leaves the only bit\r\nof color about her.\r\n\r\n"You look like a bride," said Herbert, gazing admiringly upon her.\r\n\r\n"Do I?" she answered smiling, as she turned and tripped lightly away;\r\nfor Lucy was calling to her from the next room.\r\n\r\nHerbert\'s eyes followed her with a wistful, longing look in them, and\r\nhe sighed sadly to himself as she disappeared from his view.\r\n\r\nMost of the guests came early; among them, Walter and Arthur Dinsmore;\r\nElsie had not seen the latter since his encounter with Mr. Travilla.\r\nHe gave her a sullen nod on entering the room, but took no further\r\nnotice of her.\r\n\r\nChit-chat, promenading and the music of the piano and harp were\r\nthe order of the evening for a time; then games were proposed, and\r\n"Consequences," "How do you like it?" and "Genteel lady, always\r\ngenteel," afforded much amusement. Herbert could join in these, and\r\ndid with much spirit. But dancing was a favorite pastime with the\r\nyoung people of the neighborhood, and the clock had hardly struck nine\r\nwhen Cadmus and his fiddle were summoned to their aid, chairs and\r\ntables were put out of the way, and sets began to form.\r\n\r\nElsie was in great request; the young gentlemen flocked about her,\r\nwith urgent entreaties that she would join in the amusement, each\r\nclaiming the honor of her hand in one or more sets, but she steadily\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nA glad smile lighted up Herbert\'s countenance, as he saw one and\r\nanother turn and walk away with a look of chagrin and disappointment.\r\n\r\n"Since my misfortune compels me to act the part of a wallflower, I am\r\nselfish enough, I own, to rejoice in your decision to be one also," he\r\nsaid gleefully. "Will you take a seat with me on this sofa? I presume\r\nyour conscience does not forbid you to watch the dancers?"\r\n\r\n"No, not at all," she answered, accepting his invitation.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eyes followed with eager interest the swiftly moving forms,\r\nbut Herbert\'s were often turned admiringly upon her. At length he\r\nasked if she did not find the room rather warm and close, and proposed\r\nthat they should go out upon the veranda. She gave a willing assent\r\nand they passed quietly out and sat down side by side on a rustic\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe full moon shone upon them from a beautiful blue sky, while a\r\nrefreshing breeze, fragrant with the odor of flowers and pines, gently\r\nfanned their cheeks and played among the rich masses of Elsie\'s hair.\r\n\r\nThey found a good deal to talk about; they always did, for they were\r\nkindred spirits. Their chat was now grave, now gay--generally the\r\nlatter; for Cad\'s music was inspiriting; but whatever the theme of\r\ntheir discourse, Herbert\'s eyes were constantly seeking the face of\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n"How beautiful you are, Elsie!" he exclaimed at length, in a tone of\r\nsuch earnest sincerity that it made her laugh, the words seemed to\r\nrush spontaneously from his lips. "You are always lovely, but to-night\r\nespecially so."\r\n\r\n"It\'s the moonlight, Herbert; there\'s a sort of witchery about it,\r\nthat lends beauty to many an object which can boast none of itself."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but broad daylight never robs you of yours; you always wear it\r\nwherever you are, and however dressed. You look like a bride to-night;\r\nI wish you were, and that I were the groom."\r\n\r\nElsie laughed again, this time more merrily than before. "Ah, what\r\nnonsense we are talking--we two children," she said. Then starting to\r\nher feet as the clock struck ten--"There, it is my bed-time, and I\r\nmust bid you good-night, pleasant dreams, and a happy awaking."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go yet!" he cried, but she was already gone, the skirt of\r\nher white dress just disappearing through the open hall door.\r\n\r\nShe encountered Mrs. Carrington at the foot of the stairs. "My dear\r\nchild, you are not leaving us already?" she cried.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam; the clock has struck ten."\r\n\r\n"Why, you are a second Cinderella."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," replied Elsie, laughing. "See, my dress has not changed\r\nin the least, but is quite as fresh and nice as ever."\r\n\r\n"Ah, true enough! there the resemblance fails entirely. But, my dear\r\nchild, the refreshments are just coming in, and you must have your\r\nshare. I had ordered them an hour earlier, but the servants were slow\r\nand dilatory, and then the dancing began. Come, can you not wait long\r\nenough to partake with us? Surely, ten o\'clock is not late."\r\n\r\n"No, madam; not for another night of the week, but to-morrow\'s the\r\nSabbath, you know, and if I should stay up late to-night I would be\r\nlikely to find myself unfitted for its duties. Besides, papa bade me\r\nretire at this hour; and he does not approve of my eating at night; he\r\nthinks it is apt to cause dyspepsia."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is too bad! Well, I shall see that something is set away for\r\nyou, and hope you will enjoy it to-morrow. Good-night, dear; I must\r\nhurry away now to see the rest of my guests, and will not detain you\r\nlonger," she added, drawing the fair girl toward her and kissing her\r\naffectionately, then hastening away to the supper-room.\r\n\r\nElsie tripped up the stairs and entered her room. A lamp burned low on\r\nthe toilet table, she went to it, turned up the wick, and as she did\r\nso a slight noise on the veranda without startled her. The windows\r\nreached to the floor and were wide open.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I," was answered, in a rough, surly tone, and Arthur stepped in.\r\n\r\n"Is it you?" she asked in surprise and indignation. "Why do you come\r\nhere? it is not fit you should, especially at this hour."\r\n\r\n"It is not fit you should set yourself up to reprove and instruct your\r\nuncle, I\'ve come for that money you are going to lend me."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to lend you any money."\r\n\r\n"Give it then; that will be all the better for my pocket.\r\n\r\n"I have none to give you either, Arthur; papa has positively forbidden\r\nme to supply you with money."\r\n\r\n"How much have you here?"\r\n\r\n"That is a question you have no right to ask."\r\n\r\n"Well, I know you are never without a pretty good supply of the\r\nneedful, and I\'m needy. So hand it over without any more ado;\r\notherwise I shall be very apt to help myself."\r\n\r\n"No, you will not," she said, with dignity. "If you attempt to rob me,\r\nI shall call for assistance."\r\n\r\n"And disgrace the family by giving the tattlers a precious bit of\r\nscandal to retail in regard to us."\r\n\r\n"If you care for the family credit you will go away at once and leave\r\nme in peace."\r\n\r\n"I will, eh? I\'ll go when I get what I came for, and not before."\r\n\r\nElsie moved toward the bell rope, but anticipating her intention, he\r\nstepped before it, saying with a jeering laugh, "No, you don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Arthur," she said, drawing herself up, and speaking with great\r\nfirmness and dignity, "leave this room; I wish to be alone."\r\n\r\n"Hoity-toity, Miss Dinsmore! do you suppose I\'m to be ordered about by\r\nyou? No, indeed! And I\'ve an old score to pay off. One of these days\r\nI\'ll be revenged on you and old Travilla, too; nobody shall insult and\r\nabuse me with impunity. Now hand over that cash!"\r\n\r\n"Leave this room!" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"None of your ---- impudence!" he cried fiercely, catching her by the\r\narm with a grasp that wrung from her a low, half-smothered cry of\r\npain.\r\n\r\nBut footsteps and voices were heard on the stairs, and he hastily\r\nwithdrew by the window through which he had entered.\r\n\r\nElsie pulled up her sleeve and looked at her arm. Each finger of\r\nArthur\'s hand had left its mark. "Oh, how angry papa would be!" she\r\nmurmured to herself, hastily drawing down her sleeve again as the door\r\nopened and Chloe came in, followed by another servant bearing a small\r\nsilver waiter loaded with dainties.\r\n\r\n"Missus tole me fetch \'em up with her compliments, an\' hopes de young\r\nlady\'ll try to eat some," she said, setting it down on a table.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Carrington is very kind. Please return her my thanks, Minerva,"\r\nsaid Elsie, making a strong effort to steady her voice.\r\n\r\nThe girl, taken up with the excitement of what was going on\r\ndownstairs, failed to notice the slight tremble in its tones. But\r\nnot so with Chloe. As the other hurried from the room, she took her\r\nnursling in her arms, and gazing into the sweet face with earnest,\r\nloving scrutiny; asked, "What de matter, darlin\'? what hab resturbed\r\nyou so, honey?"\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t leave me alone, to-night, mammy," Elsie whispered,\r\nclinging to her, and half hiding her face on her breast. "Don\'t go out\r\nof the room at all, unless it is to step on the veranda."\r\n\r\nChloe was much surprised, for Elsie had never been cowardly.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed I won\'t, darling" she answered, caressing the shining hair, and\r\nsoftly rounded cheek. "But what my bressed chile \'fraid of?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Arthur, mammy," Elsie answered scarcely above her breath. "He was\r\nin here a moment since, and if I were alone again he might come back."\r\n\r\n"An\' what Marse Arthur doin\' yer dis time ob night, I like ter\r\nknow?--what he want frightenin\' my chile like dis?"\r\n\r\n"Money, mammy, and papa has forbidden me to let him have any, because\r\nhe makes a bad use of it." Elsie knew to whom she spoke. Chloe was no\r\nordinary servant, and could be trusted.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, it\'s drefful that Marse Arthur takes to dem bad ways! But\r\ndon\'t go for to fret, honey; we\'ll \'gree together to ask de Lord to\r\nturn him to de right."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mammy, you must help me to pray for him. But now I must get\r\nready for bed; I have stayed up longer than papa said I might."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you take some of de \'freshments fust, honey?"\r\n\r\nElsie shook her head. "Eat what you want of them, mammy. I know I am\r\nbetter without."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  There\'s not a look, a word of thine\r\n  My soul hath e\'er forgot;\r\n  Thou ne\'er hast bid a ringlet shine,\r\n  Nor given thy locks one graceful twine,\r\n  Which I remember not.\r\n\r\n  --MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clock on the stairway was just striking nine, as some one tapped\r\nlightly on the door of Elsie\'s room, leading into the hall. Chloe rose\r\nand opened it. "Dat you, Scip?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Aunt Chloe; de missis say breakop\'s is ready, an\' will Miss\r\nDinsmore please for to come if she\'s ready. We don\'t ring de bell fear\r\nwakin\' up de odder young ladies an\' gemmen."\r\n\r\nElsie had been up and dressed for the last hour, which she had spent\r\nin reading her Bible; a book not less dear and beautiful in her esteem\r\nnow than it was in the days of her childhood. She rose and followed\r\nScip to the dining-room, where she found the older members of the\r\nfamily already assembled, and about to sit down to the table.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear, good-morning," said Mrs. Carrington; "I was sure you\r\nwould be up and dressed: but the others were so late getting to bed\r\nthat I mean they shall be allowed to sleep as long as they will. Ah!\r\nand here comes Herbert, too. We have quite a party after all."\r\n\r\n"I should think you would need a long nap this morning more than any\r\none else," Elsie said, addressing Herbert.\r\n\r\n"No," he answered, coloring. "I took advantage of my semi-invalidism,\r\nand retired very shortly after you left us."\r\n\r\n"You must not think it is usual for us to be quite so late on Sunday\r\nmorning, Elsie," observed Mr. Carrington as he sent her her plate,\r\n"though I\'m afraid we are hardly as early risers, even on ordinary\r\noccasions, as you are at the Oaks. I don\'t think it\'s a good plan to\r\nhave Saturday-night parties," he added, looking across the table at\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"No," she said lightly; "but we must blame it all on the birthday, for\r\ncoming when it did. And though we are late, we shall still be in time\r\nto get to church. Elsie, will you go with us?"\r\n\r\n"In the carriage with mother and me?" added Herbert.\r\n\r\nElsie, had she consulted her own inclination merely, would have\r\ngreatly preferred to ride her pony, but seeing the eager look in\r\nHerbert\'s eyes, she answered smilingly that she should accept the\r\ninvitation with pleasure, if there was a seat in the carriage which no\r\none else cared to occupy.\r\n\r\n"There will be plenty of room, my dear," said Mr. Carrington; "father\r\nand mother always go by themselves, driving an ancient mare we call\r\nold Bess, who is so very quiet and slow that no one else can bear to\r\nride behind her; and the boys and I either walk or ride our horses."\r\n\r\nIt was time to set out almost immediately upon leaving the table. They\r\nhad a quiet drive through beautiful pine woods, heard an excellent\r\ngospel sermon, and returned by another and equally beautiful route.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s mind was full of the truth to which she had been listening,\r\nand she had very little to say. Mrs. Carrington and Herbert, too, were\r\nunusually silent; the latter feeling it enjoyment enough just to sit\r\nby Elsie\'s side. He had known and loved her from their very early\r\nchildhood; with a love that had grown and strengthened year by year.\r\n\r\n"You seem much fatigued, Herbert," his mother said to him, as a\r\nservant assisted him from the carriage, and up the steps of the\r\nveranda. "I am almost sorry you went."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mother, I\'m not at all sorry," he answered cheerfully; "I\r\nshall have to spend the rest of the day on my couch, but that sermon\r\nwas enough to repay me for the exertion it cost me to go to hear it."\r\nThen he added in an undertone to Elsie, who stood near, looking at him\r\nwith pitying eyes, "I shan\'t mind having to lie still if you will give\r\nme your company for even a part of the time."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you shall have it, if it will be any comfort to you," she\r\nanswered, with her own sweet smile.\r\n\r\n"You must not be too exacting towards Elsie, my son," said his mother,\r\nshaking up his pillows for him, and settling him comfortably on them;\r\n"she is always so ready to sacrifice herself for others that she would\r\nnot, I fear, refuse such a request, however much it might cost her to\r\ngrant it. And no doubt she will want to be with the other girls."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was just like my selfishness to ask it, Elsie, and never\r\nthink how distasteful it might be to you. I take it all back," he\r\nsaid, blushing, but with a wistful look in his eyes that she could\r\nnever have withstood, had she wished to do so.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too late for that, since I have already accepted," she said with\r\nan arch look as she turned away. "But don\'t worry yourself about me; I\r\nshall follow my own inclination in regard to the length of my visit,\r\nmaking it very short if I find your society irksome or disagreeable."\r\n\r\nThe other girls were promenading on the upper veranda in full dinner\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nCarrie hailed Elsie in a lively tone. "So you\'ve been to church, like\r\na good Christian, leaving us three lazy sinners taking our ease at\r\nhome. We took our breakfasts in bed, and have only just finished our\r\ntoilets."\r\n\r\n"Well, and why shouldn\'t we?" said Enna; "we don\'t profess to be\r\nsaints."\r\n\r\n"No, I just said we were sinners. But don\'t think too ill of us,\r\nElsie, it was so late--or rather early--well on into the small\r\nhours--when we retired, that a long morning nap became a necessity."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pretend to judge you, Carrie," Elsie answered gently, "it\r\nis not for me to do so; and I acknowledge that though I retired much\r\nearlier than you, I slept a full hour past my usual time for rising."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll surely have to do penance for that," sneered Enna.\r\n\r\n"No, she shan\'t," said Lucy, putting her arm around her friend\'s\r\nslender waist. "Come, promenade with me till the dinner-bell rings,\r\nthe exercise will do you good."\r\n\r\nThe lively chat of the girls seemed to our heroine so unsuited to\r\nthe sacredness of the day that she rejoiced in the excuse Herbert\'s\r\ninvitation gave her for withdrawing herself from their society for the\r\ngreater part of the afternoon. She found him alone, lying on his sofa,\r\napparently asleep; but at the sound of her light footstep he opened\r\nhis eyes and looked up with a joyous smile. "I\'m so glad to see you!\r\nhow good of you to come!" he cried delightedly. "It\'s abominably\r\nselfish of me, though. Don\'t let me keep you from having a good time\r\nwith the rest."\r\n\r\n"The Sabbath is hardly the day for what people usually mean by a good\r\ntime, is it?" she said, taking possession of a low rocking-chair that\r\nstood by the side of his couch.\r\n\r\n"No, but it is the day of days for real good, happy times; everything\r\nis so quiet and still that it is easier than on other days to lift\r\none\'s thoughts to God and Heaven. Oh, Elsie, I owe you a great debt of\r\ngratitude, that I can never repay."\r\n\r\n"For what, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t you know it was you who first taught me the sweetness of\r\ncarrying all my trials and troubles to Jesus? Years ago, when we were\r\nvery little children, you told me what comfort and happiness you found\r\nin so doing, and begged me to try it for myself."\r\n\r\n"And you did?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and have continued to do so ever since."\r\n\r\n"And that is what enables you to be so patient and uncomplaining."\r\n\r\n"If I am. But ah! you don\'t know the dreadfully rebellious feelings\r\nthat sometimes will take possession of me, especially when, after\r\nthe disease has seemed almost eradicated from my system, it suddenly\r\nreturns to make me as helpless and full of pain as ever. Nobody knows\r\nhow hard it is to endure it; how weary I grow of life; how unendurably\r\nheavy my burden seems."\r\n\r\n"Yes, He knows," she murmured softly. "In all their afflictions He was\r\nafflicted; and the angel of His presence saved them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, He is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. Oh, how sweet\r\nand comforting it is!"\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a moment; then turning to her, he asked, "Are\r\nyou ever afraid that your troubles and cares are too trifling for\r\nHis notice? that you will weary and disgust Him with your continual\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\n"I asked papa about that once, and I shall never forget the tender,\r\nloving look he gave me as he said: \'Daughter, do I ever seem to feel\r\nthat anything which affects your comfort or happiness one way or the\r\nother, is too trifling to interest and concern me?\' \'Oh, no, no,\r\npapa,\' I said; \'you have often told me you would be glad to know that\r\nI had not a thought or feeling concealed from you; and you always seem\r\nto like to have me come to you with every little thing that makes me\r\neither glad or sorry.\' \'I am, my darling,\' he answered, \'just because\r\nyou are so very near and dear to me; and what does the Bible tell us?\r\n"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that\r\nfear Him!"\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Herbert, musingly. "Then that text somewhere in Isaiah\r\nabout His love being greater than a mother\'s for her little helpless\r\nbabe."\r\n\r\n"And what Jesus said: \'Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and\r\nnot one of them shall fall to the ground without your Father. But the\r\nvery hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye\r\nare of more value than many sparrows.\' And then the command: \'In\r\neverything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving let your\r\nrequests be made known unto God.\' Papa reminded me, too, of God\'s\r\ninfinite wisdom and power, of the great worlds, countless in number,\r\nthat He keeps in motion--the sun and planets of many solar systems\r\nbesides our own--and then the myriads upon myriads of tiny insects\r\nthat crowd earth, air, and water; God\'s care and providence ever over\r\nthem all. Oh, one does not know how to take it in! one cannot realize\r\nthe half of it. God does not know the distinctions that we do between\r\ngreat and small, and it costs Him no effort to attend at one and the\r\nsame time, to all His creatures and all their affairs."\r\n\r\n"No, that is true. Oh, how great and how good He is! and how sweet\r\nto know of His goodness and love; to feel that he hears and answers\r\nprayer! I would not give that up for perfect health and vigor, and all\r\nthe wealth of the world beside."\r\n\r\n"I think I would give up everything else first; and oh, I am so glad\r\nfor you, Herbert," she said softly.\r\n\r\nThen they opened their Bibles and read several chapters together,\r\nverse about, pausing now and then to compare notes, as to their\r\nunderstanding of the exact meaning of some particular passage, or to\r\nlook out a reference, or consult a commentary.\r\n\r\n"I\'m excessively tired of the house; do let\'s take a walk," said Enna,\r\nas they stood or sat about the veranda after tea.\r\n\r\n"Do you second the motion, Miss Howard?" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, rising and taking his offered arm. "Elsie, you\'ll go\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s no use in asking her!" cried Enna. "She is much too good\r\nto do anything pleasant on Sunday."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I was not aware of that." And Harry shrugged his shoulders,\r\nand threw a comical look at Elsie. "What is your objection to pleasant\r\nthings, Miss Dinsmore? To be quite consistent you should object to\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nElsie smiled. "Enna must excuse me for saying that she makes a slight\r\nmistake; for while it is true my conscience would not permit me to go\r\npleasuring on the Sabbath, yet it does not object to many things that\r\nI find very pleasant."\r\n\r\n"Such as saying your prayers, reading the Bible, and going to church?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Enna; those are real pleasures to me."\r\n\r\n"But to come to the point, will you walk with us?" asked Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no; not to-night. But please don\'t mind me. I have no\r\nright, and don\'t presume to decide such questions for anyone but\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Then, if you\'ll excuse us, we\'ll leave mamma and Herbert to entertain\r\nyou for a short time."\r\n\r\nThe short time proved to be two hours or more, and long before the\r\nreturn of the little party, Mrs. Carrington went into the house,\r\nleaving the two on the veranda alone.\r\n\r\nThey sang hymns together for a while, then fell to silent musing.\r\nHerbert was the first to speak. He still lay upon his sofa; Elsie\r\nsitting near, her face at that moment upturned to the sky, where the\r\nfull moon was shining, and looking wondrous sweet and fair in the\r\nsoft silvery light. Her thoughts seemed far away, and she started and\r\nturned quickly toward him as he softly breathed her name.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Elsie, this has been such a happy day to me! What joy, what\r\nbliss, if we could be always together!"\r\n\r\n"If you were only my brother! I wish you were, Herbert."\r\n\r\n"No, no, I do not; for I would be something much nearer and dearer.\r\nOh, Elsie, if you only would!" he went on, speaking very fast and\r\nexcitedly. "You thought I was joking last night, but I was not, I was\r\nin earnest; never more so in my life. Oh, do you think you could like\r\nme, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, Herbert; I do, and always have ever since we first became\r\nacquainted."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t mean like, I meant love. Elsie, could you love me--love\r\nme well enough to marry me?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Herbert; what an idea!" she stammered, her face flushing visibly\r\nin the moonlight. "You don\'t know how you surprise me; surely we are\r\nboth too young to be thinking of such things. Papa says I am not even\r\nto consider myself a young lady for three or four years yet. I\'m\r\nnothing but a child. And you, Herbert, are not much older."\r\n\r\n"Six months; but that\'s quite enough difference. And your father\r\nneedn\'t object on the score of our youth. You are as old now as I\'ve\r\nbeen told your mother was when he married her, and another year will\r\nmake me as old as he was. And your Aunts Louisa and Lora were both\r\nengaged before they were sixteen. It\'s not at all uncommon for girls\r\nin this part of the country to marry before they are that old. But I\r\nknow I\'m not half good enough for you, Elsie. A king might be proud to\r\nwin you for his bride, and I\'m only a poor, good-for-nothing cripple,\r\nnot worth anybody\'s acceptance." And he turned away his face, with\r\nsomething that sounded very like a sob.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s kind heart was touched. "No, Herbert, you must not talk so.\r\nYou are a dear, good, noble fellow, worthy of any lady in the land,"\r\nshe said, half playfully, half tenderly and laying her little soft\r\nwhite hand over his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe caught it in his and pressed it passionately to his lips, there\r\nholding it fast. "Oh, Elsie, if it were only mine to keep!" he cried,\r\n"I\'d be the happiest fellow in the world."\r\n\r\nShe looked at his pale, thin face, worn with suffering, into his eyes\r\nso full of passionate entreaty; thought what a dear lovable fellow he\r\nhad always been, and forgot herself entirely--forgot everything but\r\nthe desire to relieve and comfort him, and make him happy.\r\n\r\n"Only tell me that you care for me, darling, and that you are willing\r\nsome day to belong to me! only give me a little hope; I shall die if\r\nyou don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"I do care for you, Herbert; I would do anything in my power to make\r\nyou happy."\r\n\r\n"Then I may call you my own! Oh, darling, God bless you for your\r\ngoodness!"\r\n\r\nBut the clock was striking nine, and with the sound, a sudden\r\nrecollection came to Elsie. "It is my bed-time, and--and, Herbert, it\r\nwill all have to be just as papa says. I belong to him, and cannot\r\ngive myself away without his permission. Good-night." She hastily\r\nwithdrew the hand he still held, and was gone ere he had time to\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n"What had she done--something of which papa would highly disapprove?\r\nWould he be very much vexed with her?" Elsie asked herself\r\nhalf-tremblingly, as she sat passively under her old mammy\'s hands;\r\nfor her father\'s displeasure was the one thing she dreaded above all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nShe was just ready for bed when a light tap on the door was followed\r\nby the entrance of Mrs. Carrington.\r\n\r\n"I wish to see your young mistress alone for a few moments, Aunt\r\nChloe," she said, and the faithful creature went from the room at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrington threw her arms around Elsie, folded her in close,\r\nloving embrace, and kissed her fondly again and again, "My dear child,\r\nhow happy you have made me!" she whispered at last. "Herbert has told\r\nme all. Dear boy, he could not keep such good news from his mother.\r\nI know of nothing that could have brought me deeper joy and\r\nthankfulness, for I have always had a mother\'s love for you."\r\n\r\nElsie felt bewildered, almost stunned. "I--I\'m afraid you--he has\r\nmisunderstood me; it--it must be as papa says," she stammered; "I\r\ncannot decide it for myself, I have no right."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my dear, that is all very right, very proper; parents\r\nshould always be consulted in these matters. But your papa loves\r\nyou too well to raise any objection when he sees that your heart is\r\ninterested. And Herbert is worthy of you, though his mother says it;\r\nhe is a noble, true-hearted fellow, well-educated, handsome, talented,\r\npolished in manners, indeed all that anybody could ask, if he were but\r\nwell; and we do not despair of seeing him eventually quite restored\r\nto health. But I am keeping you up, and I know that your papa is\r\nvery strict and particular about your observance of his rules; so\r\ngood-night." And, with another caress, she left her.\r\n\r\nThought was very busy in Elsie\'s brain as she laid her head upon her\r\npillow. It was delightful to have given such joy and happiness to\r\nHerbert and his mother. Lucy, too, she felt sure would be very glad\r\nto learn that they were to be sisters. But her own papa, how would he\r\nfeel--what would he say? Only the other day he had reminded her how\r\nentirely she belonged to him--that no other had the slightest claim\r\nupon her, and as he spoke, the clasp of his arms seemed to say that he\r\nwould defy the whole world to take her from him. No, he would never\r\ngive her up; and somehow she was not at all miserable at the thought;\r\nbut on the contrary it sent a thrill of joy to her heart; it was so\r\nsweet to be so loved and cherished by him, "her own dear, dear papa!"\r\n\r\nBut then another thing came to her remembrance; his pity for poor\r\nsuffering Herbert; his expressed willingness to do anything he could\r\nto make him happy--and again she doubted whether he would accept or\r\nreject the boy\'s suit for her hand.\r\n\r\nCarrie and Enna were to leave at an early hour on Monday morning.\r\nThey came into Elsie\'s room for a parting chat while waiting for the\r\nringing of the breakfast bell; so the three went down together to\r\nanswer its summons, and thus she was spared the necessity of entering\r\nthe dining room alone--an ordeal she had really dreaded; a strange and\r\npainful shyness toward the whole family at Ashlands having suddenly\r\ncome over her. She managed to conceal it pretty well, but carefully\r\navoided meeting Herbert\'s eye, or those of his parents.\r\n\r\nThe girls left directly on the conclusion of the meal, and having seen\r\nthem off, Elsie slipped away to her own room. But Lucy followed her\r\nalmost immediately, fairly wild with delight at the news Herbert had\r\njust been giving her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you darling!" she cried, hugging her friend with all her might.\r\n"I never was so glad in all my life! To think that I\'m to have you for\r\na sister! I could just eat you up!"\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t," said Elsie, laughing and blushing, as she returned\r\nthe embrace as heartily as it was given. "But we must not be too sure;\r\nI\'m not at all certain of papa\'s consent."\r\n\r\n"No, I just expect he\'ll object to Herbie on account of his lameness,\r\nand his ill health. I don\'t think we ought to blame him if he does\r\neither." And Lucy suddenly sobered down to more than her ordinary\r\ngravity. "Ah, I forgot," she said, a moment after; "Herbert begs that\r\nyou will come down and let him talk with you a little if you are not\r\nparticularly engaged."\r\n\r\nElsie answering that she had nothing to do, her time was quite at\r\nhis disposal, the two tripped downstairs, each with an arm about\r\nthe other\'s waist, as they had done so often in the days of their\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nThey found Herbert on the veranda, not lying down, but seated on his\r\nsofa. "You are better this morning?" Elsie said with a glad look up\r\ninto his face, as he rose, leaning on his crutch, and gave her the\r\nother hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you, much better. Joy has proved so great a cordial that I\r\nbegin to hope it may work a complete cure." He drew her to a seat by\r\nhis side, and Lucy considerately went away and left them alone.\r\n\r\n"You have not changed your mind, Elsie?" His tone was low and half\r\ntremulous in its eagerness.\r\n\r\n"No, Herbert; but it all rests with papa, you know."\r\n\r\n"I hardly dare ask him for you, it seems like such presumption in a--a\r\ncripple like me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, Herbert. Would you love me less if I should become\r\nlame or ill?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, never! but I couldn\'t bear to have any such calamity come\r\nupon you. I can hardly bear that you should have a lame husband. The\r\nthought of it makes my trial harder to bear than ever."\r\n\r\n"It is God\'s will, and we must not fight against it," she said softly.\r\n\r\nThey conversed for some time longer. He was very anxious to gain Mr.\r\nDinsmore\'s consent to their engagement, yet shrank from asking it,\r\nfearing an indignant refusal; most of all, he dreaded a personal\r\ninterview; and, but ill able to take the ride to the Oaks, it was\r\nfinally decided between them that he should make his application by\r\nletter, doing so at once.\r\n\r\nA servant was summoned to bring him his writing materials, and Elsie\r\nleft him to his trying task, while she and Lucy and Harry mounted\r\ntheir horses and were away for a brisk, delightful ride through the\r\nwoods and over the hills.\r\n\r\n"It\'s gone, Elsie," Herbert whispered, when she came down dressed for\r\ndinner. "I wrote it twice; it didn\'t suit me then, but my strength was\r\nquite exhausted, so it had to go. I hope the answer will come soon,\r\nbut oh, I shall be almost afraid to open it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t feel so; papa is very good and kind. He pities you so much,\r\ntoo," and she repeated what he had said about being willing to do\r\nanything he could for him.\r\n\r\nHerbert\'s face grew bright with hope as he listened. "And do you think\r\nhe\'ll answer at once?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa is always very prompt and decided; never keeps one long in\r\nsuspense."\r\n\r\nMr. Carrington met our heroine at the dinner-table with such a bright,\r\nglad smile, and treated her in so kind and fatherly a manner that she\r\nfelt sure he knew all, and was much pleased with the prospect before\r\nthem. But she was afraid Harry did not like it--did not want her for a\r\nsister. He was usually very gay and talkative, full of fun and frolic.\r\nHe had been so during their ride, but now his manner seemed strangely\r\naltered; he was moody and taciturn, almost cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  Keen are the pangs\r\n  Of hapless love and passion unapproved.\r\n\r\n  --SMOLLETT\'S "REGICIDE"\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly anything could have been more distasteful to Horace Dinsmore\r\nthan the state of affairs revealed to him by Herbert Carrington\'s\r\nnote. He was greatly vexed, not at the lad\'s manner of preferring his\r\nrequest, but that it should have been made at all. He was not ready,\r\nyet to listen to such a proposal coming from any person, however\r\neligible, much less from one so sadly afflicted as poor Herbert. He\r\nsought his wife\'s presence with the missive in his hand.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter, my dear?" she asked; "I have seldom seen you so\r\ndisturbed."\r\n\r\n"The most absurd nonsense! the most ridiculously provoking affair!\r\nHerbert Carrington asking me to give him my daughter! I don\'t wonder\r\nat your astonished look, Rose; a couple of silly children. I should\r\nhave given either of them credit for more sense."\r\n\r\n"It has certainly taken me very much by surprise," said Rose, smiling.\r\n"I cannot realize that Elsie is grown up enough to be beginning with\r\nsuch things; yet you know she has passed her fifteenth birthday,\r\nand that half the girls about here become engaged before they are\r\nsixteen."\r\n\r\n"But Elsie shall not. I\'ll have no nonsense of the kind for years to\r\ncome. She shall not marry a day before she is twenty-one, I had nearly\r\nsaid twenty-five; and I don\'t think I\'ll allow it before then."\r\n\r\nRose laughed. "My dear, do you know what my age was when you married\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-one, you told me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think my father ought then to have kept us waiting four\r\nyears longer?"\r\n\r\n"No," he answered, stooping to stroke her hair, and snatch a kiss from\r\nher rich red lips.\r\n\r\nShe looked up smilingly into his face. "Ah, consistency is a jewel!\r\nand pray how old were you when you married the first time? and what\r\nwas then the age of Elsie\'s mother?"\r\n\r\n"Your arguments are not unanswerable, Mrs. Dinsmore. Your father could\r\nspare you, having several other daughters; I have but one, and can\'t\r\nspare her. Elsie\'s mother was not older when I married her, it is\r\ntrue, than Elsie is now, but was much more mature, and had neither the\r\nhappy home nor the doting father her daughter has. And as for myself,\r\nthough much too young to marry, I was a year older than this Herbert\r\nCarrington; and I was in sound and vigorous health, while he, poor\r\nfellow, is sadly crippled, and likely always to be an invalid, and\r\nvery unlikely to live to so much as see his majority. Do you think I\r\nought for a moment to contemplate allowing Elsie to sacrifice herself\r\nto him?"\r\n\r\n"It would seem a terrible sacrifice; and yet after all it will depend\r\nvery much upon the state of her own feelings."\r\n\r\n"If she were five or six years older, I should say yes to that; but\r\ngirls of her age are not fit to choose a companion for life; taste\r\nand judgment are not matured, and the man who pleases them now may be\r\nutterly repugnant to them in after years. Is not that so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and I think your decision is wise and kind. Still, I am sorry\r\nfor the poor boy, and hope you will deal very gently and kindly with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly try to do so. I pity him, and cannot blame him for\r\nfancying my lovely daughter--I really don\'t see how he or any young\r\nfellow can help it, but he can\'t have her, and of course I must tell\r\nhim so. I must see Elsie first however, and have already sent her a\r\nnote ordering her home immediately."\r\n\r\n"Come into my room for a little, dear," Mrs. Norris whispered to\r\nElsie as they rose from the dinner table. "Herbert must not expect to\r\nmonopolize all your time."\r\n\r\nIt turned out that all the old lady wanted was an opportunity to\r\nexpress her delight in the prospect of some day claiming Elsie as her\r\ngranddaughter, and to pet and fondle her a little. Mr. Norris did his\r\nshare of that also, and when at length they let her go she encountered\r\nMr. Carrington in the hall, and had to submit to some thing more of\r\nthe same sort from him.\r\n\r\n"We are all heartily rejoiced, little Elsie," he said, "all of us who\r\nknow the secret; it is to be kept from the children, of course, till\r\nyour father\'s consent has made all certain. But there is Lucy looking\r\nfor you; Herbert has sent her, I daresay. No doubt he grudges every\r\nmoment that you are out of his sight."\r\n\r\nThat was true, and his glad look, as she took her accustomed place by\r\nthe side of his couch, was pleasant to see. But he was not selfish in\r\nhis happiness, and seemed well satisfied to share Elsie\'s society with\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\nThe three were making very merry together, when a servant from the\r\nOaks was seen riding leisurely up the avenue. He had some small white\r\nobject in his hand which he began waving about his head the moment he\r\nsaw that he had attracted their attention.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a letter!" exclaimed Lucy. "Han, Scip," to the two little blacks\r\nwho, as usual, were tumbling over each other on the grass near by,\r\n"run, one of you and get it, quick now!"\r\n\r\n"What--who--Miss Lucy?" they cried, jumping up.\r\n\r\n"Yonder; don\'t you see Mr. Dinsmore\'s man with a letter? Run and get\r\nit, quick!"\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m!" and both scampered off in the direction of the horseman, who,\r\nsuddenly urging on his steed, was now rapidly nearing the house.\r\n\r\n"Hollo! dar now, you ole Jim!" shouted Scip, making a dash at the\r\nhorse, "who dat lettah fur? You gub um to me."\r\n\r\nA contemptuous sniff was the only answer, and dashing by them, Jim\r\ndrew rein close to the veranda. "Massa he send dis for you, Miss\r\nElsie," he said, holding out the letter to her.\r\n\r\nShe sprang forward, took it from his hand and hastily tore open the\r\nenvelope, the rich color coming and going in her cheek. A glance was\r\nsufficient, and turning her flushed face to the anxious, expectant\r\nHerbert: "Papa has sent for me to return home immediately," she said;\r\n"I must go."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Elsie, must you indeed? and is there no word for me--none at\r\nall?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he says you shall hear from him to-day or to-morrow."\r\n\r\nShe had gone close to him and was speaking in a low tone that the\r\nservants might not hear. Herbert took both her hands in his. "Oh, I am\r\nso sorry! You were to have stayed two days longer. I fear this sudden\r\nrecall does not argue well for me. Is he angry, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I can\'t tell. The note is simply an order for me to\r\ncome home at once and the message to you that I have given; nothing\r\nmore at all. Jim is to see me safely to the Oaks." Then turning to the\r\nmessenger, "Go and saddle Glossy, and bring her round at once, Jim,"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Elsie, hab her roun\' in less dan no time."\r\n\r\n"Go with Jim to the stables, Han," said Herbert, sighing as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, I can\'t bear to have you leave us so suddenly," cried Lucy;\r\n"it does seem too bad of your father, after giving you permission to\r\nstay a whole week, to go and dock off two days."\r\n\r\n"But papa has a right, and I can\'t complain. I\'ve nothing to do but\r\nobey. I\'ll go up and have my riding-habit put on, while Glossy is\r\nbeing saddled."\r\n\r\n"Miss Elsie," said Jim, leisurely dismounting, "massa say de wagon be\r\nhere in \'bout an hour for de trunk, an\' Aunt Chloe mus\' hab \'em ready\r\nby dat time; herself too."\r\n\r\n"Very well, she shall do so," and with another whispered word to\r\nHerbert, Elsie went into the house, Lucy going with her.\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear, this is very sudden, is it not?" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nCarrington, meeting her young guest as she came down dressed for her\r\nride. "I thought you were to stay a week, and hoped you were enjoying\r\nyour visit as much as we were."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear Mrs. Carrington; I have had a delightful time, but\r\npapa has sent for me."\r\n\r\n"And like a good child, you obey at once."\r\n\r\n"My father\'s daughter would never dare to do otherwise," replied\r\nElsie, smiling; "though I hope I should not, if I did dare."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll come again soon--often, till I can get strength to go to you?"\r\nHerbert said entreatingly, as he held her hand in parting. "And we\'ll\r\ncorrespond, won\'t we? I should like to write and receive a note every\r\nday when we do not meet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I can promise nothing till I have asked permission of\r\npapa."\r\n\r\n"But if he allows it?"\r\n\r\n"If he allows it, yes; good-bye."\r\n\r\nDearly as Elsie loved her father, she more than half dreaded the\r\nmeeting with him now; so entirely uncertain was she how he would feel\r\nin regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nHe was on the veranda, watching for her. Lifting her from her horse,\r\nhe led her into his study. Then putting an arm about her waist, his\r\nother hand under her chin so that her blushing, downcast face was\r\nfully exposed to his gaze, "What does all this mean?" he asked. "Look\r\nup into my face and tell me if it is really true that you want me to\r\ngive you away? if it is possible that you love that boy better than\r\nyour father?"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her eyes as he bade her, but dropped them again instantly;\r\nthen as he finished his sentence, "Oh, no, no, papa! not half so well;\r\nhow could you think it?" she cried, throwing her arms about his neck,\r\nand hiding her face on his breast.\r\n\r\n"Ah, is that so?" he said, with a low, gleeful laugh, as he held her\r\nclose to his heart. "But he says you accepted him on condition that\r\npapa would give consent, that you owned you cared for him."\r\n\r\n"And so I do, papa; I\'ve always loved him as if he were my brother;\r\nand I\'m so sorry for all he suffers, that I would do anything I could\r\nto make him happy."\r\n\r\n"Even to sacrificing yourself? It is well indeed for you that you have\r\na father to take care of you."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to say \'No\' to him, papa?" she asked, looking up half\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am."\r\n\r\n"Ah, papa, he said it would kill him if you did."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it; people don\'t die so easily. And I have several\r\nreasons for my refusal, each one of which would be quite sufficient of\r\nitself. But you just acknowledged to me that you don\'t love him at all\r\nas you ought. Why, my child, when you meet the right person you will\r\nfind that your love for him is far greater than what you feel for me."\r\n\r\n"Papa, I don\'t think that could be possible," she said, clinging\r\ncloser to him than before.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ll be convinced when the time comes, though I hope that\r\nwill not be for many a long year yet. Then Herbert\'s ill health and\r\nlameness are two insuperable objections. Lastly, you are both entirely\r\ntoo young to be thinking of such matters."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t mean to ask you to give me to him now, papa; not for a year\r\nor two at the very least."\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t have you engaging yourself while you are such a mere\r\nchild. I don\'t approve of long engagements, or intend to let you\r\nmarry for six or seven years to come. So you may as well dismiss all\r\nthoughts on the subject; and if any other boy or man attempts to talk\r\nto you as Herbert has, just tell him that your father utterly forbids\r\nyou to listen to anything of the kind. What! crying! I hope these are\r\nnot rebellious tears?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa; please don\'t be angry. It is only that I feel so sorry for\r\npoor Herbert; he suffers so, and is so patient and good."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for him too, but it cannot be helped. I must take care of\r\nyou first, and not allow anything which I think will interfere with\r\nyour happiness or well being."\r\n\r\n"Papa, he wants to correspond with me."\r\n\r\n"I shall not allow it."\r\n\r\n"May we see each other often?"\r\n\r\n"No; not at all for some time. He must get over this foolish fancy\r\nfirst, it cannot be anything more; and there is great danger that he\r\nwill not unless you are kept entirely apart."\r\n\r\nElsie sighed softly, but said not a word. There was no appeal from her\r\nfather\'s decisions, no argument or entreaty allowed after they were\r\nonce announced.\r\n\r\nLittle feet were heard running down the hall; then there was the sound\r\nof a tiny fist thumping on the door, and the voice of little Horace\r\ncalling, "Elsie, Elsie, tum out! me wants to see you!"\r\n\r\n"There, you may go now," her father said, releasing her with a kiss,\r\n"and leave me to write that note. Well, what is it?" for she lingered,\r\nlooking up wistfully into his face.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, be kind to him for my sake," she murmured softly, putting\r\nher arm about his neck again. "He is such a sufferer, so patient and\r\ngood, and it quite makes my heart ache to think how grievously your\r\nrefusal will pain him."\r\n\r\n"My own sweet child! always unselfish, always concerned for the\r\nhappiness of others," thought the father as he looked down into the\r\npleading face; but he only stroked her hair, and kissed her more\r\ntenderly than before, saying, "I shall try to be as kind as\r\ncircumstances will allow, daughter. You shall read the letter when it\r\nis done, and if you think it is not kind enough it shall not be sent."\r\n\r\nShe thanked him with a very grateful look, then hurried away, for the\r\ntiny fists were redoubling their blows upon the door, while the baby\r\nvoice called more and more clamorously for "sister Elsie."\r\n\r\nShe stooped to hug and kiss the little fellow, then was led off in\r\ntriumph to "mamma," whose greeting, though less noisy, was quite as\r\njoyous and affectionate.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how nice it is to get home!" cried Elsie, and wondered within\r\nherself how she had been contented to stay away so long. She had\r\nhardly finished giving Rose an animated account of her visit,\r\nincluding a minute description of the birthday party, when her\r\nfather\'s voice summoned her to the study again.\r\n\r\n"Does it satisfy you?" he asked when she had read the note.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; I think it is as kind as a refusal could possibly be\r\nmade."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall send it at once. And now this settles the matter, and\r\nI bid you put the whole affair out of your mind as completely as\r\npossible, Elsie."\r\n\r\n"I shall try, papa," she answered in a submissive and even cheerful\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nThat note, kindly worded though it was, caused great distress to\r\nHerbert Carrington. He passed an almost sleepless night, and the next\r\nmorning, finding himself quite unable to rise from his couch, he sent\r\nan urgent entreaty that Mr. Dinsmore would call at Ashlands at his\r\nearliest convenience.\r\n\r\nHis request was granted at once, and the lad pleaded with all the\r\neloquence of which he was master for a more favorable reception of his\r\nsuit.\r\n\r\nHad he been as well acquainted with Horace Dinsmore\'s character\r\nas Elsie was, he would have known the utter uselessness of such a\r\nproceeding. He received a patient hearing, then a firm, though kind\r\ndenial. Elsie was entirely too young to be allowed even to think of\r\nlove or matrimony, her father said; he was extremely sorry the subject\r\nhad been broached to her; it must not be again for years. He would not\r\npermit any engagement, correspondence, or, for the present at least,\r\nany exchange of visits; because he wished the matter to be dropped\r\nentirely, and, if possible, forgotten. Nor would he hold out the\r\nslightest hope for the future; answering Herbert\'s petition for that\r\nby a gentle hint that one in his ill health should be content to\r\nremain single.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are right, Mr. Dinsmore, and I don\'t blame you for refusing\r\nto give me your lovely daughter; I\'m entirely unworthy of such a\r\ntreasure," said the poor boy in a broken voice.\r\n\r\n"Not in character, my dear boy," said Mr. Dinsmore, almost tenderly;\r\n"in that you are all I could ask or desire, and it is all that you\r\nare responsible for. And now while she is such a mere child, I should\r\nreject any other suitor for her hand, quite as decidedly as I do you."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t blame me for loving her?"\r\n\r\n"No; oh, no!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it. I\'ve loved her ever since I first saw her, and that\r\nwas before I was five years old."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t object to a brotherly affection, and when you can tone\r\nit down to that, shall not forbid occasional intercourse. And now,\r\nwith the best wishes for your health and happiness, I must bid you\r\ngood-bye."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, sir; and thank you for your kindness in coming," the boy\r\nanswered with a quivering lip. Then, turning to his mother, as Mr.\r\nDinsmore left the room, "I shall never get over it," he said. "I shall\r\nnot live long, and I don\'t want to; life without her isn\'t worth\r\nhaving."\r\n\r\nHer heart ached for him, but she answered cheerily: "Why, my dear\r\nchild, don\'t be so despondent; I think you may take hope and courage\r\nfrom some things that Mr. Dinsmore said. It is quite in your favor\r\nthat he will not allow Elsie to receive proposals from any one at\r\npresent, for who knows but, by the time he considers her old enough,\r\nyou may be well and strong."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrington\'s words had a very different effect from what she\r\nintended. The next time Herbert saw his physician, he insisted so\r\nstrongly on knowing exactly what he might look forward to that there\r\nwas no evading the demand; and on learning that he was hopelessly\r\ncrippled for life, he sank into a state of utter despondency, and from\r\nthat moment grew rapidly worse, failing visibly day by day.\r\n\r\nElsie, dutifully abstaining from holding any communication with\r\nAshlands, and giving all her thoughts as far as possible to home\r\nduties and pleasures knew nothing of it till one day Enna came in,\r\nasking, "Have you heard the news?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Elsie, pausing in a game of romps with her little brother;\r\n"what is it?"\r\n\r\n"It! You should rather say they. There\'s more than one item of\r\nimportance." And Enna straightened herself and smoothed out her dress\r\nwith a very consequential air. "In the first place Arthur has been\r\nfound out in his evil courses; he\'s been betting and gambling till\r\nhe\'s got himself over head and ears in debt. Papa was so angry, I\r\nalmost thought he would kill him. But he seemed to cool down after\r\nhe\'d paid off the debts; and Arthur is, or pretends to be, very\r\npenitent, promises never to do the like again, and so he\'s got\r\nforgiven, and he and Walter are to start for college early next week.\r\nThey\'ve both gone to the city to-day with papa. Arthur seems to be mad\r\nat you; he says that you could have saved him from being found out,\r\nbut didn\'t choose to, and some day he\'ll have his revenge. Now, what\r\nwas it you did, or didn\'t do?"\r\n\r\n"He wanted money, and I refused to lend it because papa had forbidden\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You\'re good at minding, and always were," was Enna\'s sneering\r\ncomment. "No, I\'ll take that back; I forgot that time when you nearly\r\ndied rather than mind."\r\n\r\nAn indignant flush suffused Elsie\'s fair face for an instant; but\r\nthe sneer was borne in utter silence. Rose entered the room at that\r\nmoment, and, having returned her greeting, Enna proceeded to give\r\nanother important bit of news.\r\n\r\n"Herbert Carrington is very ill; not confined to his bed, but failing\r\nvery fast. The doctors advised them to take him from home; because\r\nthey said they thought he had something on his mind, and taking him\r\ninto new scenes might help him to forget it. They think he\'s not\r\nlikely to live long anyhow, but that is the last hope. His mother and\r\nLucy started North with him this morning."\r\n\r\nElsie suddenly dropped the ball she was tossing for Horace and ran out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n"Why, what did she do that for?" asked Enna, in a tone of surprise,\r\nturning to Rose for an explanation. "Is she in love with him, do you\r\nsuppose?"\r\n\r\n"No, I know she is not; but I think she has a strong sisterly regard\r\nfor him, and I am sorry the news of his increased illness was told her\r\nso abruptly."\r\n\r\n"Such a baby, as she always was," muttered Enna, "crying her eyes out\r\nabout the least little thing."\r\n\r\n"If she lacks sufficient control over her feelings it is almost the\r\nonly fault she has," replied Rose warmly. "And I think, Enna, you are\r\nhardly capable of appreciating her delicately sensitive nature, and\r\nwarm, loving heart, else you would not wound her as you do. She\r\ncertainly controls her temper well, and puts up with more from you\r\nthan I should."\r\n\r\n"Pray, what do you mean, Mrs. Dinsmore? what have I done to your pet?"\r\nasked the young lady angrily.\r\n\r\n"She is older than you, yet you treat her as if she were much younger.\r\nYour manner toward her is often very contemptuous, and I have\r\nfrequently heard you sneer at her principles and taunt her with her\r\nwilling subjection to her father\'s strict rule; for which she deserves\r\nnothing but the highest praise."\r\n\r\n"Nobody could ever rule me the way Horace does her!" cried Enna, with\r\na toss of her head. "And as to her being older than I am, I\'m sure no\r\none would think it; she is so absurdly childish in her way; not half\r\nso mature as I, mamma says."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad and thankful that she is not," answered Rose, with spirit;\r\n"her sweet childish simplicity and perfect naturalness are very\r\ncharming in these days, when they are so rarely found in a girl who\r\nhas entered her teens."\r\n\r\nLittle Horace, standing by the window, uttered a joyous shout, "Oh,\r\npapa tumin\'!" and rushed from the room to return the next moment\r\nclinging to his father\'s hand, announcing as they came in together,\r\n"Here papa is; me found him!"\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore shook hands with his sister, addressed a remark to his\r\nwife, then, glancing about the room, asked, "Where is Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"She left us a moment since, but did not say where she was going,"\r\nsaid Rose.\r\n\r\n"I presume you\'ll find her crying in her boudoir or dressing room,"\r\nadded Enna.\r\n\r\n"Crying! Why, what is wrong with her?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing that I know of, except that I told her of Herbert\r\nCarrington\'s being so much worse that they\'ve taken him North as a\r\nlast hope."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" and Mr. Dinsmore looked much concerned.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there can be no doubt about it, for I heard it from Harry\r\nhimself this morning."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore rose, and, putting his little son gently aside, left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nElsie was not in her own apartments; he passed through the whole\r\nsuite, looking for her; then, going on into the grounds, found her at\r\nlast in her favorite arbor. She was crying bitterly, but at the sound\r\nof his step checked her sobs, and hastily wiped away her tears. She\r\nthought he would reprove her for indulging her grief, but instead he\r\ntook her in his arms and soothed her tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa," she sobbed, "I feel as if I had done it--as if I had\r\nkilled him."\r\n\r\n"Darling, he is not past hope; he may recover, and in any event\r\nnot the slightest blame belongs to you. I have taken the whole\r\nresponsibility upon my shoulders."\r\n\r\nShe gave him a somewhat relieved and very grateful look, and he went\r\non: "And even if I had allowed you to decide the matter for yourself,\r\nyou would have done what was your duty in refusing to promise to\r\nbelong to one whom you love less than you love your father."\r\n\r\nSome months later there came news of Herbert\'s death. Elsie\'s grief\r\nwas deep and lasting. She sorrowed as she might have done for the loss\r\nof a very dear brother; while added to that was a half-remorseful\r\nfeeling which reason could not control or entirely relieve; and it was\r\nlong ere she was quite her own bright, gladsome sunny self again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  The bloom of opening flowers\' unsullied beauty--\r\n  Softness and sweetest innocence she wears,\r\n  And looks like nature in the world\'s first spring.\r\n\r\n  --ROWE\'S "TAMERLANE."\r\n\r\n\r\n"What a very peculiar hand, papa; so stiff and cramped and\r\nold-fashioned," Elsie remarked, as her father laid down a letter he\r\nhad just been reading.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Did you ever hear me speak of Aunt Wealthy Stanhope?"\r\n\r\nHis glance seemed to direct the question to Rose, who answered, with a\r\nlook of surprise and curiosity, "No, sir. Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"A half-sister of my own mother. She was the daughter of my maternal\r\ngrandfather by his first wife, my mother was the child of the second,\r\nand there were some five or ten years between them. Aunt Wealthy never\r\nmarried, would never live with any of her relatives, but has always\r\nkept up a cosey little establishment of her own."\r\n\r\n"Do you know her, papa?" asked Elsie, who was listening with eager\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"I can hardly say that I do. I saw her once, nearly eighteen\r\nyears ago, about the time you were born--but I was not capable of\r\nappreciating her then; indeed, was so unhappy and irritable as to be\r\nhardly in a condition to either make or receive favorable impressions.\r\nI now believe her to be a truly good and noble little woman, though\r\ndecidedly an oddity in some respects. Then I called her a fidgety,\r\nfussy old maid."\r\n\r\n"And your letter is from her?" Rose said inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she wants me to pay her a visit, taking Elsie with me, and\r\nleaving her there for the summer."\r\n\r\n"There, papa! where?"\r\n\r\n"Lansdale, Ohio. Should you like to go?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I should like to go, papa, if you take me; but whether I\r\nshould like to stay all summer I could hardly tell till I get there."\r\n\r\n"You may read the letter," he said, handing it to her.\r\n\r\n"It sounds as though it might be very pleasant, papa," she said, as\r\nshe laid it down after an attentive perusal.\r\n\r\nIt spoke of Lansdale as a pretty, healthful village, surrounded by\r\nbeautiful scenery, and boasting of some excellent society: of two\r\nlively young girls, living in the next house to her own, who would be\r\ncharming companions for Elsie, etc.\r\n\r\n"Your remark that your aunt was an oddity in some respects has excited\r\nmy curiosity," said Rose.\r\n\r\n"Ah! and I am to understand that you would like me to gratify it, eh?"\r\nreturned her husband, smiling. "Her dress and the arrangement of her\r\nhair are in a style peculiarly her own (unless she has become more\r\nfashionable since I saw her, which is not likely); and she has an odd\r\nway of transposing her sentences and the names of those she addresses\r\nor introduces, or calling them by some other name suggested by some\r\nassociation with the real one. Miss Bell, for instance, she would\r\nprobably call Miss Ring; Mr. Foot, Mr. Shoe, and so on."\r\n\r\n"Does she do so intentionally, papa?" Elsie asked.\r\n\r\n"No, not at all; her mistakes are quite innocently made, and are\r\ntherefore very amusing."\r\n\r\nMrs. Horace Dinsmore\'s parents had been urging her to visit them, and\r\nafter some further consideration it was decided that the whole family\r\nshould go North for the summer, Mr. Dinsmore see his wife and little\r\nson safe at her father\'s, then take Elsie on to visit his aunt; the\r\nlength of the visit to be determined after their arrival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning early in May; the air was vocal with the songs\r\nof birds and redolent with the breath of flowers all bathed in dew;\r\ndelicate wreaths of snowy vapor rose slowly from the rippling surface\r\nof the river that threaded its way through the valley, and folded\r\nthemselves about the richly-wooded hill-sides, behind which bright\r\nstreaks of golden light were shooting upward, fair heralds of the\r\ncoming of the king of day. On the outskirts of the pretty village of\r\nLansdale, and in the midst of a well-kept garden and lawn, stood a\r\ntasteful dwelling, of Gothic architecture. Roses, honeysuckle, and\r\nVirginia creeper clambered over its walls, twined themselves about the\r\npillars of its porticos and porches, or hung in graceful festoons from\r\nits many gables; the garden was gay with sweet spring flowers; the\r\ntrees, the grass on the lawn, and the hedge that separated it from the\r\nroad, all were liveried in that vivid green so refreshing to the eye.\r\n\r\n"Phillis! Simon!" called a sweet-toned voice from the foot of the back\r\nstaircase; "are you up? It\'s high time; nearly five o\'clock now, and\r\nthe train\'s due at six."\r\n\r\n"Coming, ma\'am. I\'ll have time to do up all my chores and git to\r\nthe depot \'fore de train; you neber fear," replied a colored lad of\r\nfifteen or sixteen, hurrying down as he spoke.\r\n\r\nA matronly woman, belonging to the same race, followed close in his\r\nrear.\r\n\r\n"You\'re smart dis mornin\', missis," she said, speaking from the middle\r\nof the stairway. "I didn\'t \'spect you\'d git ahead o\' me, and de sun\r\nhardly showin\' his face \'bove de hill-tops yit."\r\n\r\n"I woke early, Phillis, as I always do when something\'s going to\r\nhappen that I expect. Simon make haste to feed and water your horses\r\nand be sure you have old Joan in the carriage and at the gate by a\r\nquarter before six."\r\n\r\n"Am I to drive her to the depot, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Lottie Prince will do that, and you are to take the\r\none-horse wagon for the trunks. Did you go to Mr. Laugh\'s and engage\r\nit, as I told you yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"I went to Mr. Grinn\'s and disengaged de one-horse wagon, ma\'am;\r\nyes\'m."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now come into the sitting room and I\'ll show you the\r\nlikenesses of the lady and gentleman, and the old colored woman\r\nthey\'re going to bring with them," replied the mistress, leading\r\nthe way into an apartment that, spite of its plain, old-fashioned\r\nfurniture, wore a very attractive appearance, it was so exquisitely\r\nneat; and the windows, reaching to the floor, opened upon one side\r\ninto conservatory and garden, on the other upon a porch that ran the\r\nwhole length of the front of the house. Taking a photograph album from\r\na side-table, she showed the three pictures to Simon, who pronounced\r\nthe gentleman very handsome, the lady the prettiest he ever saw, and\r\nwas sure he should recognise both them and their servant.\r\n\r\n"Now, Phillis, we\'ll have to bestir ourselves," said Miss Stanhope,\r\nreturning to the kitchen. "Do you think you can get breakfast in less\r\nthan an hour? such a breakfast as we should have this morning--one fit\r\nfor a king."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Wealthy; but you don\'t want it that soon, do you? Folks is\r\napt to like to wash and dress \'fore breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! sure enough. Well, we\'ll give them half an hour."\r\n\r\nA few moments later, as Miss Stanhope was busy with broom and duster\r\nin the front part of the house, a young girl opened the gate, tripped\r\ngayly up the gravel walk that led from it across the lawn, and stepped\r\nupon the porch. She was a brunette with a very rich color in her dark\r\ncheek, raven hair, and sparkling, roguish black eyes. She wore a suit\r\nof plain brown linen, with snowy cuffs and collar, and a little straw\r\nhat. "Good-morning, Aunt Wealthy!" she cried, in a lively tone, "You\r\nsee I\'m in good time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lottie, and looking as neat as a pin, too. It\'s very kind in\r\nyou, because of course I want to be here to receive them as they come,\r\nto offer to introduce yourself and drive down to the depot for them."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'m wonderfully clever, considering that I don\'t at all\r\nenjoy a drive in this sweet morning air, and aint in a bit of a hurry\r\nto see your beautiful young heiress and her papa. Net wonders at my\r\naudacity in venturing to face them alone; but I tell her I\'m too\r\nstaunch a republican to quail before any amount of wealth or\r\nconsequence, and if Mr. and Miss Dinsmore see fit to turn up their\r\naristocratic noses at me, why--I\'ll just return the compliment."\r\n\r\n"I hope they\'re not of that sort, Lottie; but if they are, you will\r\nserve them right."\r\n\r\n"She does not look like it," observed the young girl, taking the album\r\nfrom the table and gazing earnestly upon Elsie\'s lovely countenance.\r\n"What a sweet, gentle, lovable face it is! I\'m sure I shall dote on\r\nher; and if I can only persuade her to return my penchant, won\'t we\r\nhave grand good times while she\'s here? But there\'s Simon with old\r\nJoan and the carriage. He\'ll hunt them up for me at the depot; won\'t\r\nhe, Aunt Wealthy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I told him to."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shrill whistle of the locomotive echoed and re-echoed among the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n"Lansdale!" shouted the conductor, throwing open the car door.\r\n\r\n"So we are at our destination at last, and I am very glad for your\r\nsake, daughter, for you are looking weary," said Mr. Dinsmore, drawing\r\nElsie\'s shawl more closely about her shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not so very tired, papa," she answered, with a loving look\r\nand smile, "not more so than you are, I presume. Oh, see! papa, what a\r\npretty girl in that carriage there!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! Come to meet some friend, doubtless. Come, the train has\r\nstopped; keep close to me," he said. "Aunt Chloe, see that you have\r\nall the parcels."\r\n\r\n"Dis de gentleman and lady from de South, what Miss Stanhope\'s\r\n\'spectin\'?" asked a colored lad, stepping up to our little party as\r\nthey alighted.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Dis way den, sah, if you please, sah. Here\'s de carriage. De lady\r\nwill drive you up to de house, and I\'ll take your luggage in de little\r\nwagon."\r\n\r\n"Very well; here are the checks. You will bring it up at once?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sah, have it dar soon as yourself, sah. Dis cullad person better\r\nride wid me and de trunks."\r\n\r\nThey were nearing the carriage and the pretty girl Elsie had noticed\r\nfrom the car window. "Good-morning! Mr. and Miss Dinsmore, I presume?"\r\nshe said with a bow and smile. "Will you get in? Let me give you a\r\nhand, Miss Dinsmore. I am Lottie King, a distant relative and near\r\nneighbor of your aunt, Miss Stanhope."\r\n\r\n"And have kindly driven down for us. We are much obliged, Miss King,"\r\nMr. Dinsmore answered, as he followed his daughter into the vehicle.\r\n"Shall I not relieve you of the reins?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, thank you; I\'m used to driving, and fond of it. And, besides,\r\nyou don\'t know the way."\r\n\r\n"True. How is my aunt?"\r\n\r\n"Quite well. She has been looking forward with great delight to this\r\nvisit, as have my sister Nettie and I also," Lottie answered, with a\r\nbackward glance of admiring curiosity at Elsie. "I hope you will be\r\npleased with Lansdale, Miss Dinsmore; sufficiently so to decide to\r\nstay all summer."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I think it is looking lovely this morning. Does my aunt\r\nlive far from the depot?"\r\n\r\n"Not very; about a quarter of a mile."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a pretty place, and what a quaint-looking little old lady on\r\nits porch!" Elsie presently cried out. "See, papa!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s Aunt Wealthy, and doesn\'t she make a picture standing\r\nthere under the vines in her odd dress?" said Miss King, driving up to\r\nthe gate. "She\'s the very oddest, and the very dearest and sweetest\r\nlittle old lady in the world."\r\n\r\nElsie listened and looked again; this time with eager interest and\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Aunt Wealthy was no slave to fashion. The tyrannical dame\r\nat that time prescribed gaiter boots, a plain pointed waist and\r\nstraight skirt, worn very long and full. Miss Stanhope wore a full\r\nwaist made with a yoke and belt, a gored skirt, extremely scant, and\r\nso short as to afford a very distinct view of a well-turned ankle and\r\nsmall, shapely foot encased in snowy stocking and low-heeled black kid\r\nslipper. The material of her dress was chintz--white ground with a\r\ntiny brown figure--finished at the neck with a wide white ruffle; she\r\nhad black silk mitts on her hands, and her hair, which was very gray\r\nwas worn in a little knot almost on the top of her head, and one\r\nthick, short curl, held in place by a puff-comb, on each side of her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAt sight of the carriage and its occupants, she came hurrying down\r\nthe gravel walk, meeting them as they entered the gate. She took Mr.\r\nDinsmore\'s hand, saying, "I am glad to see you, nephew Horace," and\r\nheld up her face for a kiss. Then turning to Elsie, gave her a very\r\nwarm embrace. "So, dear, you\'ve come to see your old auntie? That\'s\r\nright. Come into the house."\r\n\r\nElsie was charmed with her and with all she saw; all without was so\r\nfresh and bright, everything within so exquisitely neat and clean. The\r\nfurniture of the whole house was very plain and old-fashioned, but\r\nMiss Stanhope never thought of apologizing for what to her wore the\r\ndouble charm of ownership, and of association with the happy days of\r\nchildhood and youth, and loved ones gone. Nor did her guests deem\r\nanything of the kind called for in the very least; house and mistress\r\nseemed well suited the one to the other: and Elsie thought it not\r\nunpleasant to exchange, for a time, the luxurious furnishing of her\r\nhome apartments for the simple adornments of the one assigned her\r\nhere. The snowy drapery of its bed and toilet-table, its wide-open\r\ncasements giving glimpses of garden, lawn, and shrubbery, and the\r\nbeautiful hills beyond, looked very inviting. There were vases of\r\nfresh flowers too, on mantel and bureau, and green vines peeping in\r\nat the windows. It seemed a haven of rest after the long, fatiguing\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n"The child is sweet and fair to look upon, Horace, but I see nothing\r\nof you or my sister in her face," observed Miss Stanhope, as her\r\nnephew entered the breakfast-room, preceding his daughter by a moment\r\nor two. "Whom does she resemble?"\r\n\r\n"Elsie is almost the exact counterpart of her own mother, Aunt\r\nWealthy, and looks like no one else," he answered, with a glance of\r\nproud fatherly affection at the young creature as she entered and took\r\nher place at the table.\r\n\r\n"Now my daughter," he said, at the conclusion of the meal, "you must\r\ngo and lie down until near dinner-time, if possible."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is excellent advice," said Miss Stanhope. "I see, and I\'m\r\nglad, she\'s worth taking care of, as you are sensible, Horace. You\r\nshall be called in season, dear. So take a good nap."\r\n\r\nElsie obeyed, retired to her room, slept several hours, and woke\r\nfeeling greatly refreshed. Chloe was in waiting to dress her for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"Had you a nap too, my poor old mammy?" asked her young mistress.\r\n\r\n"Yes, darlin\'. I\'ve been lying on that coach, and feel good as ever\r\nnow. Hark! what dat?"\r\n\r\n"It sounds like a dog in distress," said Elsie, as they both ran to\r\nthe window and looked out.\r\n\r\nA fat poodle had nearly forced his plump body between the palings of\r\nthe front gate in the effort to get into the street, and sticking\r\nfast, was yelping in distress. As they looked Miss Stanhope ran\r\nquickly down the path, seized him by the tail, and jerked him back, he\r\nuttering a louder yelp than before.\r\n\r\n"There, Albert," she said, stroking and patting him, "I don\'t like to\r\nhurt you, but how was I to get you out, or in? You must be taught that\r\nyou\'re to stay at home, sir. Thomas! Thomas! come home, Thomas!" she\r\ncalled; and a large cat came running from the opposite side of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n"So those are Aunt Wealthy\'s pets. What an odd name for a cat," said\r\nElsie, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Elsie, dey\'s pets, sure nuff: Phillis says Miss Wealthy\'s\r\nmighty good t\'em."\r\n\r\n"There, she is coming in with them, and, mammy, we must make haste.\r\nI\'m afraid it\'s near dinner-time," said Elsie, turning away from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nHer toilet was just completed when there was a slight tap on the door,\r\nand her father\'s voice asked if she was ready to go down.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she answered, hurrying to him as Chloe opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are looking something like yourself again," he said, with a\r\npleasant smile, as he drew her hand within his arm, and led her down\r\nthe stairs. "You have had a good sleep?"\r\n\r\n"A delicious rest. I must have slept at least four hours. And you,\r\npapa?"\r\n\r\n"I took a nap of about the same length, and feel ready for almost\r\nanything in the shape of dinner, etc. And there is the bell."\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope cast many an admiring glance at nephew and niece during\r\nthe progress of the meal.\r\n\r\n"I\'m thinking, Horace," she said at length, "that it\'s a great shame\r\nI\'ve been left so many years a stranger to you both."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it is, Aunt Wealthy; but the great distance that lies\r\nbetween our homes must be taken as some excuse. We would have been\r\nglad to see you at the Oaks, but you never came to visit us."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it was much easier for you to come here," she replied, shaking\r\nher head. "I\'ve been an old woman these many years. Come," she added,\r\nrising from the table, "come into the parlor, children, and let me\r\nshow you the olden relics of time I have there--things that I value\r\nvery highly, because they\'ve been in the family for generations."\r\n\r\nThey followed her--Elsie unable to forbear a smile at hearing her\r\nfather and herself coupled together as "children"--and looked with\r\nkeen interest upon some half dozen old family portraits, an ancient\r\ncabinet of curiosities, a few musty, time-worn volumes, a carpet that\r\nhad been very expensive in its day, but was now somewhat faded and\r\nworn, and tables, sofas, and chairs of solid mahogany; each of the\r\nlast-named covered with a heavily-embroidered silken cushion.\r\n\r\n"That sampler," said Aunt Wealthy, pointing to a large one with a\r\nwonderful landscape worked upon it, that, framed and glazed,\r\nhung between two of the windows, "is a specimen of my paternal\r\ngrandmother\'s handiwork; these chair-cushions, too, she embroidered\r\nand filled with her own feathers, so that I value them more than their\r\nweight in gold."\r\n\r\n"My great-grandmother kept a few geese, I presume," Mr. Dinsmore\r\nremarked aside to Elsie with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\nHaving finished their inspection of the parlor and its curiosities,\r\nthey seated themselves upon the front porch, where trees and vines\r\ngave a pleasant shade. Miss Stanhope had her knitting, Mr. Dinsmore\r\nthe morning paper, while Elsie sat with her pretty white hands lying\r\nidly in her lap, doing nothing but enjoy the beautiful prospect and a\r\nquiet chat with the sweet-voiced old lady.\r\n\r\nThe talk between them was quite brisk for a time, but gradually it\r\nslackened, till at length they had been silent for several minutes,\r\nand Elsie, glancing at her aunt, saw her nodding over her work.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you must excuse me, dear," the old lady said apologetically,\r\nwaking with a start; "I\'m not very well, and, deary, I woke unusually\r\nearly this morning, and have been stirring about ever since."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you afford yourself a little nap, auntie?" Elsie asked in\r\nreturn. "You mustn\'t make company of me; and, besides, I have a book\r\nthat I can amuse myself with."\r\n\r\n"You would be quite alone, child, for I see your father has gone in."\r\n\r\n"I shall not mind that at all, auntie. Do go and lie down for at least\r\na little while."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, dear, I will just lie down on the sofa in the sitting\r\nroom, and you must call me if any one comes."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Wealthy couldn\'t have meant for a child like that, unless she\r\ncomes on some important errand," thought Elsie, as, a few moments\r\nlater, a little girl came slowly across the lawn and stepped upon the\r\nporch.\r\n\r\nThe child looked clean and decent, in a neat calico dress and gingham\r\nsun-bonnet. At sight of Elsie she stood still, and, gazing with\r\nopen-mouthed curiosity, asked, "Be you the rich young lady that was\r\ncoming to see Miss Wealthy from \'way down south?"\r\n\r\n"I have come from the South to see Miss Stanhope. What do you wish?"\r\n\r\n"Nothin\', I just come over \'cause I wanted to."\r\n\r\n"Will you take a seat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," taking possession of the low rocking chair Miss Stanhope had\r\nvacated.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" inquired Elsie.\r\n\r\n"Lenwilla Ellawea Schilling," returned the child, straightening\r\nherself up with an air of importance; "mother made it herself."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," replied Elsie, with a sparkle of fun in her eye.\r\n"And your mother is Mrs. Schilling, is she?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and pap, he\'s dead, and my brother\'s named Corbinus."\r\n\r\n"What do they call you for short?"\r\n\r\n"Willy, and him Binus."\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?"\r\n\r\n"Over yonder," nodding her head towards the opposite side of the\r\nstreet. "Mother\'s comin\' over to see you some time. I guess I\'ll be\r\ngoing now." And away she went.\r\n\r\n"What did that child want?" asked Miss Stanhope, coming out just in\r\ntime to see the little maiden pass through the gate.\r\n\r\n"Nothing but to look at and question me, I believe." Elsie answered,\r\nwith an amused smile.\r\n\r\n"Ah! she generally comes to borrow some little thing or other. They\'re\r\nthe sort of folks that always have something they\'re out of. Mrs.\r\nSixpence is a very odd sixpence indeed."\r\n\r\n"I think the little girl said her last name was Schilling."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, so it is: but I\'m always forgetting their exact commercial\r\nvalue," and Aunt Wealthy laughed softly. "In fact, I\'ve a very good\r\nforgetting of my own, and am more apt to get names wrong than right."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Schilling must have an odd taste for names," said Elsie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s a manufacturer of them; and very proud of her success in\r\nthat line."\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope was a great lover of flowers, very proud of hers,\r\ncultivated principally by her own hands. After tea she invited her\r\nnephew and niece to a stroll through her garden, while she exhibited\r\nher pets with a very excusable pride in their variety, beauty, and\r\nfragrance.\r\n\r\nAs they passed into the house again, Phillis was feeding the chickens\r\nin the back yard.\r\n\r\n"You have quite a flock of poultry, aunt," remarked Mr. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I like to see them running about, and the eggs you lay yourself\r\nare so much better than any you can buy, and the chickens, too, have\r\nquite another taste. Phillis, what\'s the matter with that speckled\r\nhen?"\r\n\r\n"Dunno, mistis; she\'s been crippled dat way all dis week."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, I dare say it\'s the boys; one of them must have thrown a\r\nstone and hit her between her hind legs; they\'re great plagues. Poor\r\nthing! There, Albert, don\'t you dare to meddle with the fowls! Come\r\naway, Thomas. That cat and dog are nearly as bad and troublesome to\r\nthe boys as the poultry."\r\n\r\nPuss and the poodle followed their mistress into the house, where\r\nAlbert lay down at her feet, while Thomas sprang into her lap, where\r\nhe stood purring and rubbing his head against her arm.\r\n\r\n"You seem to have a good many pets, auntie," Elsie remarked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am fond of them. A childless old woman must have something to\r\nlove. I\'ve another that I\'m fonder of than any of these though--my\r\ngrand-nephew, Harry Duncan. He\'s away at school now; but I hope to\r\nshow him to you one of these days."\r\n\r\n"I should like to see him. Is he a relative of ours?" Elsie asked,\r\nturning to her father.\r\n\r\n"No, he belongs to the other side of the house."\r\n\r\n"How soft and fine this cat\'s fur is, aunt; he\'s quite handsome,"\r\nremarked Elsie, venturing to stroke Thomas very gently.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I raised him, and his mother before him. My sister Beulah was\r\nfirst husband\'s child of Harry\'s grandmother twice married, and my\r\nmother. Yes, I think a great deal of him, but was near losing him last\r\nwinter. A fellow in our town--he\'s two years old now--wanted a buffalo\r\nrobe for his sleigh, and undertook to make it out of cat-skins. He\r\nadvertised that he\'d give ten cents for every cat-skin the boys would\r\nbring him. You know the old saying that you can\'t have more of a cat\r\nthan its skin, and hardly anybody\'s was safe after that; they went\r\nabout catching all they could lay hands on, even borrowing people\'s\r\npets and killing them."\r\n\r\nElsie turned to her father with a very perplexed look, puzzled to\r\nunderstand who it was that had married twice, and whether her aunt had\r\nstated Harry\'s age or that of the cat.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant steps and voices were heard upon the porch, and\r\nthe door-bell rang.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Lottie and her father," said Miss Stanhope, pushing Thomas from\r\nher lap. "Come in, friends, and don\'t stand for ceremony." For both\r\ndoors stood wide open.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening," said the young lady, coming forward, leaning upon\r\nthe arm of a middle-aged gentleman. "Mr. Dinsmore, I have brought my\r\nfather, Dr. King, to see you."\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen shook hands, the doctor observing, "I am happy to make\r\nyour acquaintance, Mr. Dinsmore. I brought my daughter along to\r\nintroduce me, lest our good Aunt Wealthy here, in her want of\r\nappreciation of nobility and birth, should, as she sometimes does,\r\ngive me a rank lower than my true one, making me to appear only a\r\nPrince, while I am really a King."\r\n\r\nA general laugh followed this sally, Miss Stanhope insisting that that\r\nwas a mistake she did not often make now. Then Elsie was introduced,\r\nand, all being seated again, Dr. King turned to his hostess with the\r\nlaughing remark, "Well, Aunt Wealthy, by way of amends, I\'ll own up\r\nthat my wife says that you\'re the better doctor of the two. That bran\r\nhas done her a world of good."\r\n\r\n"Bran?" said Mr. Dinsmore inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; Mrs. King was suffering from indigestion; Miss Stanhope\r\nadvised her to try eating a tablespoonful or so of dry bran after her\r\nmeals, and it has had an excellent effect."\r\n\r\n"My father learnt it from an old sea-captain," said Miss Stanhope;\r\n"and it has helped a great many I\'ve recommended it to. Some prefer\r\nto mix it with a little cream, or take a little water with it but the\r\nbest plan\'s to take it dry if you can."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  When to mischief mortals bend their will,\r\n  How soon they find fit instruments of ill.\r\n\r\n  --POPE\'S "RAPE OF THE LOCK."\r\n\r\n\r\n"What, Art, are you going out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you know it\'s after ten?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you just mind your own business, Wal; learn your lessons, and\r\ngo off to bed like a good boy when you get through. I\'m old enough to\r\ntake care of myself."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! I\'m awfully afraid he\'s gone back to his evil courses, as\r\nfather says," muttered Walter Dinsmore to himself, as the door closed\r\nupon his reckless elder brother. "I wonder what I ought to do about\r\nit," he continued, leaning his head upon his hand, with a worried,\r\nirresolute look; "ought I to report to the governor? No, I shan\'t,\r\nthere then; I don\'t know anything, and I never will be a sneak or a\r\ntell-tale." And he drew the light nearer, returned to his book with\r\nredoubled diligence for some ten or fifteen minutes more; then,\r\npushing it hastily aside, with a sigh of relief, started up, threw off\r\nhis clothes, blew out the light, and tumbled into bed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arthur had stolen noiselessly from the college, and pursued\r\nhis way into the heart of the town. On turning a corner he came\r\nsuddenly upon another young man who seemed to have been waiting for\r\nhim; simply remarking, "You\'re late to-night, Dinsmore," he faced\r\nabout in the same direction, and the two walked on together.\r\n\r\n"Of course; but how can a fellow help it when he\'s obliged to watch\r\nhis opportunity till the Argus eyes are closed in sleep, or supposed\r\nto be so?" grumbled Arthur.\r\n\r\n"True enough, old boy; but cheer up, your day of emancipation must\r\ncome some time or other," remarked his companion, clapping him\r\nfamiliarly; on the shoulder. "Of age soon, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"In about a year. But what good does that do me? I\'m not so fortunate\r\nas my older brother--shall have nothing of my own till one or other of\r\nmy respected parents sees fit to kick the bucket, and leave me a pile;\r\na thing which at present neither of them seems to have any notion of\r\ndoing."\r\n\r\n"You forget your chances at the faro-table."\r\n\r\n"My chances! You win everything from me, Jackson. I\'m a lame duck\r\nnow, and if my luck doesn\'t soon begin to turn, I\'ll--do something\r\ndesperate, I believe."\r\n\r\nThe lad\'s tone was bitter, his look reckless and half despairing.\r\n\r\n"Pooh, don\'t be a spooney! We all have our ups and downs, and you must\r\ntake your turn at both, like the rest."\r\n\r\nThey had ascended a flight of steps, and Jackson rang the bell as he\r\nspoke. It was answered instantly by a colored waiter, who with, a\r\nsilent bow stepped back and held the door open for their entrance.\r\nThey passed in and presently found themselves in a large,\r\nwell-lighted, and handsomely-furnished room, where tables were set out\r\nwith the choicest viands, rich wine, and trays of fine cigars.\r\n\r\nThey seated themselves, ate and drank their fill, then, each lighting\r\na cigar, proceeded to a saloon, on the story above, where a number of\r\nmen were engaged in playing cards--gambling, as was evident from the\r\npiles of gold, silver, and bank-notes lying here and there upon the\r\ntables about which they sat.\r\n\r\nHere also costly furniture, bright light, and rich wines lent their\r\nattractions to the scene.\r\n\r\nArthur took possession of a velvet-cushioned chair on one side of an\r\nelegant marble-topped table, his companion placing himself in another\r\ndirectly opposite. Here, seated in the full blaze of the gas-light,\r\neach face was brought out into strong relief. Both were young, both\r\nhandsome; Jackson, who was Arthur\'s senior by five or six years,\r\nremarkably so; yet his smile was sardonic, and there was often a\r\nsinister expression in his keen black eye as its glance fell upon his\r\nvictim, for such Arthur Dinsmore was--no match for his cunning and\r\nunscrupulous antagonist, who was a gambler by profession.\r\n\r\nArthur\'s pretended reformation had lasted scarcely longer than until\r\nhe was again exposed to temptation, and his face, as seen in that\r\nbrilliant light, wore unmistakable signs of indulgence in debauchery\r\nand vice. He played in a wild, reckless way, dealing out his cards\r\nwith a trembling hand, while his cheek burned and his eye flashed.\r\n\r\nAt first Jackson allowed him to win, and filled with a mad delight at\r\nthe idea that "his luck had turned," the boy doubled and trebled his\r\nstakes.\r\n\r\nJackson chuckled inwardly, the game went on, and at length Arthur\r\nfound all his gains suddenly swept away and himself many thousands of\r\ndollars in debt.\r\n\r\nA ghastly pallor overspread his face, he threw himself back in his\r\nchair with a groan, then starting up with a bitter laugh, "Well, I see\r\nonly one way out of this," he said. "A word in your ear, Tom; come\r\nalong with me. I\'ve lost and you won enough for one night; haven\'t we,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I\'m satisfied if you are." And the two hurried into the\r\nnow dark and silent street, for it was long past midnight, and sober\r\nand respectable people generally had retired to their beds.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" asked Jackson.\r\n\r\n"Anywhere you like that we can talk without danger of being\r\noverheard."\r\n\r\n"This way then, down this street. You see \'tis absolutely silent and\r\ndeserted."\r\n\r\nThey walked on, talking in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"You\'d like your money as soon as you can get it?" said Arthur.\r\n\r\n"Of course; in fact I must have it before very long, for I\'m hard\r\npushed now."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I could put you in the way of marrying a fortune, would you\r\nhold me quit of all your claims against me?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m, that would depend upon the success of the scheme."\r\n\r\n"And that upon your own coolness and skill. I think I\'ve heard you\r\nspoken of as a woman-killer?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! Yes, I flatter myself that I have won some reputation in that\r\nline, and that not a few of the dear creatures have been very fond of\r\nme. It\'s really most too bad to break their soft little hearts; but\r\nthen a man can\'t marry \'em all; unless he turns Mormon."\r\n\r\nArthur\'s lips curled with scorn and contempt, and he half turned away\r\nin disgust and aversion; but remembering that he was in the power\r\nof this man, whom, too late, alas! he was discovering to be an\r\nunscrupulous villain, he checked himself, and answered in his usual\r\ntone, "No, certainly not; and so you have never yet run your neck into\r\nthe matrimonial noose?"\r\n\r\n"No, not I, and don\'t fancy doing so either, yet I own that a fortune\r\nwould be a strong temptation. But, I say, lad, if it\'s a great chance,\r\nwhy do you hand it over to me? Why not try for it yourself? It\'s not\r\nyour sister, surely?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; you\'re not precisely the sort of brother-in-law I should\r\nchoose," returned the boy, with a bitter, mocking laugh. "But stay,\r\ndon\'t be insulted"--for his companion had drawn himself up with an air\r\nof offended pride--"the lady in question is but a step farther from\r\nme; she is my brother\'s daughter."\r\n\r\n"Eh! you don\'t say? A mere child, then, I presume."\r\n\r\n"Eighteen, handsome as a picture, as the saying is, and only too\r\nsweet-tempered for my taste."\r\n\r\n"And rich you say? that is her father\'s wealthy, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s one of the richest men in our county, but she has a fortune\r\nin her own right, over a million at the very lowest computation."\r\n\r\n"Whew! You expect me to swallow that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s true, true as preaching. You wonder that I should be so willing\r\nto help you to get her. Well, I owe her a grudge, I see no other way\r\nto get out of your clutches, and I shall put you in the way of making\r\nher acquaintance only on condition that if you succeed we share the\r\nspoils."\r\n\r\n"Agreed. Now for the modus operandi. You tell me her whereabouts and\r\nprovide me with a letter of introduction, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No; on the contrary, you are carefully to conceal the fact that you\r\nhave the slightest knowledge of me. The introduction must come from\r\nquite another quarter. Listen, and I\'ll communicate the facts and\r\nunfold my plan. It has been running in my head for weeks, ever since I\r\nheard that the girl was to spend the summer in the North with nobody\r\nbut an old maiden aunt, half-cracked at that, to keep guard over her;\r\nbut I couldn\'t quite make up my mind to it till to-night, for you must\r\nsee, Tom," he added with a forced laugh, "that it can\'t be exactly\r\ndelightful to my family pride to think of bringing such a dissipated\r\nfellow as you into the connection."\r\n\r\n"Better look at home, lad. But you are right; one such scamp is, or\r\nought to be, all-sufficient for one family."\r\n\r\nArthur said, "Certainly," but winced at the insinuation nevertheless.\r\nIt was not a pleasant reflection that his vices had brought him down\r\nto a level with this man who lived by his wits--or perhaps more\r\ncorrectly speaking, his rascalities--of whose antecedents he knew\r\nnothing and whom, with his haughty Southern pride, he thoroughly\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nBut scorn and loathe him as he might in his secret soul, it was\r\nnecessary that he should be conciliated, because it was now in his\r\npower to bring open disgrace and ruin upon his victim. So Arthur went\r\non to explain matters and, with Jackson\'s assistance, to concoct a\r\nplan of getting Elsie and her fortune into their hands.\r\n\r\nAs he had said, the idea had been in his mind for weeks, yet it was\r\nnot until that day that he could see clearly how to carry it out.\r\nAlso, his family pride had stood in the way until the excitement of\r\nsemi-intoxication and his heavy losses had enabled him to put it aside\r\nfor the time. To-morrow he would more than half regret the step he was\r\ntaking, but now he plunged recklessly into the thing with small regard\r\nfor consequences to himself or others.\r\n\r\n"Can you imitate the chirography of others?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Perfectly, if I do say it that shouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then we can manage it. My brother Walter has kept up a correspondence\r\nwith this niece ever since he left home. In a letter received\r\nyesterday she mentions that her father was about leaving her for\r\nthe rest of the summer. Also that Miss Stanhope, the old aunt she\'s\r\nstaying with, was formerly very intimate with Mrs. Waters of this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n"It just flashed on me at once that a letter of introduction from her\r\nwould be the very thing to put you at once on a footing of intimacy\r\nin Miss Stanhope\'s house; and that if you were good at imitating\r\nhandwriting we might manage it by means of a note of invitation which\r\nI received from Mrs. Waters some time ago, and which, as good luck\r\nwould have it, I threw into my table drawer instead of destroying."\r\n\r\n"But who knows that it was written by the lady herself?"\r\n\r\n"I do, for I heard Bob Waters say so."\r\n\r\n"Good! have you the note about you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, here it is." And Arthur drew it from his pocket. "Let\'s cross\r\nover to that lamp-post."\r\n\r\nThey did so, and Jackson held the note up to the light for a moment,\r\nscanning it attentively. "Ah, ha! the very thing! no trouble at all\r\nabout that," he said, pocketing it with a chuckle of delight, "But,"\r\nand a slight frown contracted his brows, "what if the old lady should\r\ntake it into her head to open a correspondence on the subject with her\r\nold friend?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve thought of that too, but fortunately for our scheme Mrs. Waters\r\nsails for Europe to-morrow; and by the way that should be mentioned in\r\nthe letter of introduction."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so it should. Come to my room at the Merchants\' House to-morrow\r\nnight, and you shall find it ready for your inspection. I suppose the\r\nsooner the ball\'s set in motion the better?" he added as they moved\r\nslowly on down the street.\r\n\r\n"Yes, for there\'s no knowing how long it may take you to storm the\r\ncitadel of her ladyship\'s heart, or how soon her father may come to\r\nthe conclusion that he can\'t do without her, and go and carry her off\r\nhome. And I tell you, Tom, you\'d stand no chance with him, or with her\r\nif he were there. He\'d see through you in five minutes."\r\n\r\n"H\'m! What sort is she?"\r\n\r\n"The very pious!" sneered Arthur, "and you\'re bound to take your cue\r\nfrom that or you\'ll make no headway with her at all."\r\n\r\n"A hard role for me, Dinsmore. I know nothing of cant."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to learn it then; let her once suspect your true\r\ncharacter--a drinking, gambling, fortune-hunting roue--and she\'ll turn\r\nfrom you with the same fear and loathing that she would feel for a\r\nvenomous reptile."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha! you\'re in a complimentary mood to-night, Dinsmore. Well,\r\nwell, such a fortune as you speak of is worth some sacrifice and\r\neffort, and I think I may venture the character of a perfectly moral\r\nand upright man with a high respect for religion. The rest I can learn\r\nby degrees from her; and come to think of it, it mightn\'t be a bad\r\nidea to let her imagine she\'d converted me."\r\n\r\n"Capital! The very thing, Tom! But good-night. I must be off now to\r\nthe college. I\'ll come to your room to-morrow night and we\'ll finish\r\nthe arrangement of all preliminaries."\r\n\r\nMore than a fortnight had passed since the arrival of Miss Stanhope\'s\r\nguests. It had been a season of relaxation and keen enjoyment to\r\nthem, to her, and to Dr. King\'s family, who had joined them in many a\r\npleasant little excursion to points of interest in the vicinity, and\r\nseveral sociable family picnics among the surrounding hills and woods.\r\nA warm friendship had already sprung up between the three young girls,\r\nand had done much toward reconciling Elsie to the idea of spending the\r\nsummer there away from her father.\r\n\r\nShe had finally consented to do so, yet as the time drew near her\r\nheart almost failed her. In all these years since they went to live\r\ntogether at the Oaks, they had never been far apart--except once or\r\ntwice for a few days when he had gone to New Orleans to attend to\r\nbusiness connected with the care of her property; and only on a very\r\nfew occasions, when she paid a little visit in their own neighborhood,\r\nhad they been separated for more than a day.\r\n\r\nShe could not keep back her tears as she hung about his neck on\r\nparting. "Ah, papa, how can I do without you for weeks and months?"\r\nshe sighed.\r\n\r\n"Or I without you, my darling?" he responded, straining her to his\r\nbreast. "I don\'t know how I shall be able to stand it. You need not be\r\nsurprised to see me again at any time, returning to claim my treasure;\r\nand in the meanwhile we will write to each other every day. I shall\r\nwant to know all you are doing, thinking, and feeling. You must tell\r\nme of all your pursuits and pleasures; your new acquaintances, too,\r\nif you form any. In that you must be guided by the advice of Aunt\r\nWealthy, together with your father\'s known wishes. I am sure I can\r\ntrust my daughter to obey those in my absence as carefully as in my\r\npresence."\r\n\r\n"I think you may, papa. I shall try to do nothing that you would\r\ndisapprove, and to attend faithfully to all your wishes."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore left by the morning train, directly after breakfast. It\r\nwas a bright, clear day, and Miss Stanhope, anxious to help Elsie to\r\nrecover her spirits, proposed a little shopping expedition into the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n"You have not seen our stores yet," she said, "and I think we\'d better\r\ngo now before the sun gets any hotter. Should you like it, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, yes, auntie. I will go and get ready at once."\r\n\r\nElsie could hardly forbear smiling at the quaint little figure that\r\nmet her in the porch a few moments later, and trotted with quick,\r\nshort steps by her side across the lawn and up and down the village\r\nstreets. The white muslin dress with its short and scanty skirt, an\r\nembroidered scarf of the same material, the close, old-fashioned\r\nleg-horn bonnet, trimmed with one broad strip of white mantua ribbon,\r\nput straight down over the top and tied under the chin, and the black\r\nmitts and morocco slippers of the same hue, formed a tout ensemble\r\nwhich, though odd, was not unpleasant to look upon. In one hand the\r\nlittle lady carried a very large parasol, in the other a gayly-colored\r\nsilk reticule of corresponding size, this last not by a ribbon or\r\nstring, but with its hem gathered up in her hand. All in singular\r\ncontrast to Elsie with her slight, graceful form, fully a head taller,\r\nand her simple yet elegant costume. But the niece no more thought of\r\nfeeling ashamed of her aunt, than her aunt of her.\r\n\r\nThey entered a store, and the smiling merchant asked, "What can I do\r\nfor you to-day, ladies?"\r\n\r\n"I will look at shirting muslin, if you please, Mr. Under," replied\r\nMiss Stanhope, laying parasol and reticule upon the counter.\r\n\r\n"Over, if you please, Miss Stanhope," he answered with an amused look.\r\n"Just step this way, and I\'ll show you a piece that I think will\r\nsuit."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, I\'m always making mistakes in names," she said,\r\ndoing as requested.\r\n\r\n"Anything else to-day, ladies?" he asked when the muslin had been\r\nselected. "I have quite a lot of remnants of dress goods, Miss\r\nStanhope. Would you like to look at them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered almost eagerly, and he quickly spread them on the\r\ncounter before her. She selected quite a number, Elsie wondering what\r\nshe wanted with them.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll send the package at once," said Mr. Over, as they left the\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nThey entered another where Miss Stanhope\'s first inquiry was for\r\nremnants, and the same thing was repeated till, as she assured Elsie,\r\nthey had visited every dry-goods store in the place.\r\n\r\n"Pretty nice ones, too, some of them are; don\'t you think so, dear?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, auntie; but do you know you have strongly excited my curiosity?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! how so?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I cannot imagine what you can want with all those remnants. I\'m\r\nsure hardly one of them could be made into a dress for yourself or for\r\nPhillis, and you have no little folks to provide for."\r\n\r\n"But other folks have, child, and I shall use some of the smallest for\r\npatchwork."\r\n\r\n"Dere\'s a lady in de parlor, Miss Stanhope," said Chloe, meeting them\r\nat the gate; "kind of lady," she added with a very broad smile, "come\r\nto call on you, ma\'am, and Miss Elsie too."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll just go in without keeping her waiting to take off our\r\nbonnets," said Aunt Wealthy, leading the way.\r\n\r\nThey found a rather gaudily-dressed, and not very refined-looking\r\nwoman, who rose and came forward to meet them with a boisterous\r\nmanner, evidently assumed to cover a slight feeling of embarrassment.\r\n"Oh, I\'m quite ashamed, Aunt Wealthy, to have been so long in calling\r\nto see your friends; you really must excuse me; it\'s not been for want\r\nof a strong disinclination, I do assure you: but you see I\'ve been\r\naway a-nursing of a sick sister."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Mrs. Sixpence."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Schilling."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not at all, it\'s my mistake. Elsie, Mrs. Schilling. My niece,\r\nMiss Dinsmore. Sit down, do. I\'m sorry you got here before we were\r\nthrough our shopping."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s rather an early call," began Mrs. Schilling, her\r\nrubicund countenance growing redder than ever, "but--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, aunt did not mean that," interposed Elsie, with gentle\r\nkindliness. "She was only regretting that you had been kept waiting."\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Miss Stanhope. "You know I\'m a sad hand at talking,\r\nalways getting the horse before the cart, as they say. But tell me\r\nabout your sister. I hope she has recovered. What ailed her?"\r\n\r\n"She had inflammation of the tonsils; she\'s better now though; the\r\ntonsils is all gone, and I think she\'ll get along. She\'s weak yet;\r\nbut that\'s all. There\'s been a good bit of sickness out there in that\r\nneighborhood, through the winter and spring; there were several cases\r\nof scarlet fever, and one of small-pox. That one died, and what do you\r\nthink, Aunt Wealthy; they had a reg\'lar big funeral, took the corpse\r\ninto the church, and asked everybody around to come to it."\r\n\r\n"I think it was really wicked, and that if I\'d been the congregation,\r\nevery one of me would have staid away."\r\n\r\n"So would I. There now, I\'m bound to tell you something that happened\r\nwhile I was at father\'s. My sister had a little girl going on two\r\nyears old, and one day the little thing took up a flat iron, and let\r\nit fall on her toe, and mashed it so we were really afraid \'twould\r\nhave to be took off. We wrapped it up in some kind o\' salve mother\r\nkeeps for hurts, and she kept crying and screamin\' with pain, and we\r\ncouldn\'t peacify her nohow at all, till a lady that was visiting next\r\ndoor come in and said we\'d better give her a few drops of laud\'num. So\r\nwe did, and would you believe it? it went right straight down into her\r\ntoe, and she stopped cryin\', and pretty soon dropped asleep. I thought\r\nit was the curiosest thing I ever heard of."\r\n\r\n"It was a wise prescription, no doubt," returned Miss Stanhope, with a\r\nquiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Wealthy, won\'t you tell me how you make that Farmer\'s\r\nfruit-cake?" asked the visitor, suddenly changing the subject. "Miss\r\nDinsmore, it\'s the nicest thing you ever eat. You\'d be sure it had\r\nraisins or currants in it."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Mrs. Schilling. You must soak three cups of dried apples\r\nin warm water over night, drain off the water through a sieve, chop\r\nthe apples slightly, them simmer them for two hours in three cups of\r\nmolasses. After that add two eggs, one cup of sugar, one cup of sweet\r\nmilk or water, three-fourths of a cup of butter or lard, one-half\r\nteaspoonful of soda, flour to make a pretty stiff batter, cinnamon,\r\ncloves, and other spices to suit your taste."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! but I\'m afraid I\'ll hardly be able to remember all that."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll write the receipt and send it over to you," said Elsie.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schilling returned her thanks, sat a little longer, conversing in\r\nthe same lucid style, then rose and took leave, urging the ladies to\r\ncall soon, and run in sociably as often as they could.\r\n\r\nShe was hardly out of the door before Aunt Wealthy was beating up\r\nher crushed chair-cushions to that state of perfect roundness and\r\nsmoothness in which her heart delighted. It amused Elsie, who had\r\nnoticed that such was her invariable custom after receiving a call in\r\nher parlor.\r\n\r\nLottie King and Mrs. Schilling passed each other on the porch, the\r\none coming in as the other went out. Kind Aunt Wealthy, intent on\r\npreventing Elsie from grieving over the emptiness of her father\'s\r\naccustomed seat at the table, had invited her young friend to dinner.\r\nThe hour of the meal had, however, not yet arrived, and the two girls\r\nrepaired to Elsie\'s room to spend the intervening time.\r\n\r\nLottie, in her benevolent desire to be so entertaining to Elsie that\r\nher absent father should not be too sorely missed, seized upon the\r\nfirst topic of conversation which presented itself and rattled on in a\r\nvery lively manner.\r\n\r\n"So you have begun to make acquaintance with our peculiar currency,\r\nmon ami! An odd sixpence as Aunt Wealthy calls her. Two of them I\r\nshould say, since it takes two sixpences to make a shilling."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; I\'m inclined to think Aunt Wealthy\'s arithmetic has the\r\nright of it, since she was never more than a shilling, and has lost\r\nher better half," returned Elsie, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Better half, indeed! fie on you, Miss Dinsmore! have you so little\r\nregard for the honor of your sex as to own that the man is ever that?\r\nBut I must tell you of the time when she sustained the aforesaid loss;\r\nand let me observe, sustained is really the proper--very properest of\r\nwords to express my meaning, for it was very far from crushing her.\r\nWhile her husband was lying a corpse, mother went over with a pie,\r\nthinking it might be acceptable, as people are not apt to feel like\r\ncooking at such a time. She did not want to disturb the new-made widow\r\nin the midst of her grief, and did not ask for her; but Mrs. Schilling\r\ncame to the door. \'Oh, I\'m so much obliged to you for bringing that\r\npie!\' she said. \'It was so good of you. I hadn\'t any appetite to eat\r\nwhile he was sick, but now that he\'s dead, I feel as if I could eat\r\nsomething. You and your girls must come over and spend a day with\r\nme some time soon. He\'s left me full and plenty, and you needn\'t be\r\nafraid to take a meal\'s victuals off me\'!"\r\n\r\n"How odd! I don\'t think she could be quite broken-hearted."\r\n\r\n"No, and she has apparently forgotten him, and bestowed her affections\r\nupon another; a widower named Wert. Mr. Was, Aunt Wealthy usually\r\ncalls him. They both attend our church, and everybody notices how\r\nimpossible it seems to be for her to keep her eyes off him; and you\r\ncan never be five minutes in her company without hearing his name.\r\nDidn\'t she talk of him to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she spoke of Mr. Wert visiting some sick man, to talk and\r\npray with him, and rejoiced that the man did not die till he gave\r\nevidence that he was repaired."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that sounds like her," laughed Lottie. "She\'s always getting the\r\nwrong word. I told you she never could keep her eyes off Mr. Wert.\r\nWell, the other day--three or four weeks ago--coming from church he\r\nwas behind her; she kept looking back at him, and presently came bump\r\nup against a post. She made an outcry, of course everybody laughed,\r\nand she hurried off with a very red face. That put an idea into my\r\nhead, and--" Lottie paused, laughing and blushing--\r\n\r\n"I\'m half ashamed to tell you, but I believe I will--Nettie and I\r\nwrote a letter in a sort of manly hand, signed his initials, and put\r\nit into an iron pot that she keeps standing near her back door. The\r\nletter requested that she would put her answer in the same place, and\r\nshe did. Oh, it was rich! such a rapture of delight; and such spelling\r\nand such grammar as were used to express it! It was such fun that we\r\nwent on, and there have been half a dozen letters on each side. I\r\ndaresay she is wondering why the proposal doesn\'t come. Ah, Elsie, I\r\nsee you don\'t approve; you are as grave as a judge."\r\n\r\n"I would prefer not to express an opinion; so please don\'t ask me."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t think it was quite right, now do you?"\r\n\r\n"Since you have asked a direct question, Lottie, dear," Elsie\r\nanswered, with some hesitation, "I\'ll own that it does not seem to me\r\nquite according to the golden rule."\r\n\r\n"No," Lottie said, after a moment\'s pause, in which she sat with\r\ndowncast eyes, and cheeks crimsoning with mortification. "I\'m ashamed\r\nof myself, and I hope I shall never again allow my love of fun to\r\ncarry me so far from what is true and kind.\r\n\r\n"And so Aunt Wealthy took you out shopping, and secured the benefit of\r\nyour taste and judgment in the choice of her remnants?" she exclaimed,\r\nwith a sudden change to a lively, mirthful tone.\r\n\r\n"How do you know that she bought remnants?" asked Elsie, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she always does; that\'s a particular hobby of the dear old\r\nbody\'s; two or three times in a season she goes around to all the\r\nstores, and buys up the most of their stock; they save the best of\r\nthem for her, and always know what she\'s after the moment she shows\r\nher pleasant face. She gives them away, generally, to the minister\'s\r\nwife, telling her the largest are to be made into dresses for her\r\nlittle girls; and the poor lady is often in great tribulation, not\r\nknowing how to get the dresses out of such small patterns, and afraid\r\nto put them to any other use, lest Miss Stanhope should feel hurt or\r\noffended. By the way, what do you think of Aunt Wealthy\'s own dress?"\r\n\r\n"That it is very quaint and odd, but suits her as no other would."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad! It\'s just what we all think, but before you came we were\r\nmuch afraid you would use your influence to induce her to adopt a more\r\nfashionable attire."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Bear fair presence, though your heart be tainted;\r\n  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint.\r\n\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE\'S "COMEDY OF ERRORS."\r\n\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very handsome present, child, very; and your old auntie will\r\nbe reminded of you every time she uses it, or looks at it."\r\n\r\n"Both beautiful and useful, like the giver," remarked Lottie.\r\n\r\n"It" was a sewing-machine, Elsie\'s gift to Aunt Wealthy, forwarded\r\nfrom Cincinnati, by Mr. Dinsmore; the handsomest and the best to be\r\nfound in the city; so Elsie had requested that it should be, and so he\r\nhad written that it was.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you like it, auntie, and you too, Lottie," was all she said\r\nin response to their praises, but her eyes sparkled with pleasure at\r\nthe old lady\'s evident delight.\r\n\r\n"It" had arrived half an hour before, on this the second morning after\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s departure, and now stood in front of one of the windows\r\nof Aunt Wealthy\'s bedroom--a delightfully shady, airy apartment on the\r\nground floor, back of the parlor, and with window and door opening\r\nout upon a part of the lawn where the trees were thickest and a tiny\r\nfountain sent up its showers of spray.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope stood at a table, cutting out shirts. Lottie was\r\nexperimenting on the machine with a bit of muslin, and Elsie sat\r\nnear by with her father\'s letter in her hand, her soft dark eyes now\r\nglancing over it for perhaps the twentieth time, now at the face of\r\none or the other of her companions, as Lottie rattled on in her usual\r\ngay, flighty style, and Aunt Wealthy answered her sometimes with a\r\nstraightforward sentence, and again with one so topsy-turvy that her\r\nlisteners could not forbear a smile.\r\n\r\n"For whom are you making shirts, aunt?" asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n"For my boy Harry. He writes that his last set are going wonderfully\r\nfast; so I must send up another to make."\r\n\r\n"You must let us help you, Lottie and I; we have agreed that it will\r\nbe good fun for us."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dearie, but I didn\'t suppose plain sewing was among your\r\naccomplishments."\r\n\r\n"Mamma says I am quite a good needle-woman," Elsie replied with a\r\nsmile and a blush, "and if I am not it is no fault of hers. She took\r\ngreat pains to teach me. I cut out a shirt for papa once, and made\r\nevery stitch of it myself."\r\n\r\n"And she can run the machine too," said Lottie, "though her papa won\'t\r\nlet her do so for more than half an hour at a time, lest she should\r\nhurt herself."\r\n\r\n"He\'s very careful of her, and no wonder," Aunt Wealthy responded,\r\nwith a loving look at the sweet, fair face. "You may help me a little,\r\nnow and then, children, when it just suits your humor, but I want you\r\nto have all the rides and walks, the reading and recreation of every\r\nsort that you can enjoy."\r\n\r\n"Here comes Lenwilla Ellawea Schilling," said Lottie, glancing from\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"What do you want, Willy?" asked Miss Stanhope, as the child appeared\r\nin the doorway with a teacup in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Mother wants a little light\'ning to raise her bread."\r\n\r\n"Yeast? Oh, yes, just go round to Phillis, and she\'ll give you some."\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a gentleman," said the child, "I seen him a-coming in at the\r\ngate."\r\n\r\nChloe answered the bell and entered the room the next moment with a\r\nletter, which she handed to Miss Stanhope.\r\n\r\nThe old lady adjusted her spectacles and broke the seal. "Ah, a letter\r\nof introduction, and from my old friend and schoolmate Anna Waters;\r\nwishes me to treat the young man with all the courtesy and kindness I\r\nwould show to her own son, for she esteems him most highly, etc., etc.\r\nAunt Chloe, what have you done with him?"\r\n\r\n"Showed him into de parlor, mistis, and leff him a-sittin\' dar."\r\n\r\n"What\'s his name, auntie?" asked Lottie, as the old lady refolded the\r\nletter and took off her glasses.\r\n\r\n"Bromly Egerton; quite romantic, isn\'t it? Excuse me for a few\r\nminutes, dears; I must go and see what he wants."\r\n\r\nAunt Wealthy found a well-dressed, handsome young man seated on one of\r\nher softly-cushioned chairs. He rose and came forward to meet her with\r\ncourtly ease and grace. "Miss Stanhope, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"You are right, Mr. Ledgerfield. Pray be seated, sir."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, madam, but let me first help you to a seat. Excuse the\r\ncorrection, but Egerton is my name."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! For the sake of my friend, Mrs. Waters, I welcome you to\r\nLansdale. Do you expect to make some stay in our town?"\r\n\r\n"Well, madam, I hardly had such expectation before arriving here, but\r\nI find it so pretty a place that I begin to think I can scarcely do\r\nbetter. My health has been somewhat impaired by very strict and close\r\nattention to business; and my physician has ordered entire relaxation\r\nfor a time, and fresh country air. Can you recommend a boarding-place\r\nin town? Some quiet, private hotel where drinking and things of that\r\nkind would not be going on. I\'m not used to it, and should find it\r\nvery disgusting."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to hear such sentiments, young man; they do you honor. I\r\ndaresay Mrs. Sixpence,--no, Mrs. Schilling,--just opposite here, would\r\ntake you in. She told me some weeks ago that she would be glad to have\r\none or two gentlemen boarders."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, the location would suit me well; and you think she could\r\ngive me comfortable accommodations?"\r\n\r\n"I do; she has pleasant rooms and is a good cook."\r\n\r\n"A widow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, not very young, and has two children. But they are old enough\r\nnot to be annoying to a boarder."\r\n\r\n"What sort of woman is she?"\r\n\r\n"A good manager, neat, industrious, honest, and obliging. Very\r\nsuitable for a landlady, if you are not looking in the person of your\r\nhostess for an intellectual companion."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all, Miss Stanhope, unless--unless you could find it in\r\nyour benevolent heart to take me in yourself;" and his smile was very\r\ninsinuating. "In that case I should have the luxury of intellectual\r\ncompanionship superadded to the other advantages of which you have\r\nspoken."\r\n\r\nThe old lady smiled, but shook her head quite decidedly. "I have lived\r\nso long in the perfect house that I should not know how to give it up.\r\nI have come to think men a care and a trouble that I cannot take upon\r\nme in my old age."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, my dear madam, for the unwarrantable liberty I took\r\nin asking it," he said in an apologetic tone, and with a slightly\r\nembarrassed air. "I beg ten thousand pardons."\r\n\r\n"That is a great many," she answered with a smile, "but you may\r\nconsider them all granted. I hope you left my friend Mrs. Waters well?\r\nI must answer her letter directly."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then you are not aware that she is already on her way to Europe?"\r\n\r\n"No, is she indeed?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she sailed the day after that letter was written; which accounts\r\nfor the date not being a very recent one. You see I did not leave\r\nimmediately on receiving it from her."\r\n\r\nShe was beginning to wish that he would go, but he lingered for some\r\ntime, vainly hoping for a glimpse of Elsie. On finally taking his\r\nleave, he asked her to point out Mrs. Schilling\'s house, and she\r\nnoticed that he went directly there.\r\n\r\n"Really, auntie, we began to think that your visitor must intend to\r\nspend the day," cried Lottie, as Miss Stanhope returned to her room\r\nand her interrupted employment.\r\n\r\n"Ah? Well it was not my urging that kept him; I was very near telling\r\nhim that he was making me waste a good deal of time" replied the old\r\nlady; then seeing that Lottie was curious on the subject, she kindly\r\nwent on to tell all that she had learned in regard to the stranger and\r\nhis intentions.\r\n\r\nElsie was amusing herself with Thomas, trying to cajole him to return\r\nto the frolicsomeness of his long-forgotten kittenhood, and did not\r\nseem to hear or heed. What interest for her had this stranger, or his\r\ndoings?\r\n\r\n"Young and handsome, you say, Aunt Wealthy? and going to stay in\r\nLansdale all summer? Would you advise me to set my cap for him?"\r\n\r\n"No, Lottie; not I."\r\n\r\n"You were not smitten with the gentleman, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Not enough to spare him to you anyhow, but he may improve upon\r\nacquaintance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t approve of marrying, though, do you, auntie? Your practice\r\ncertainly seems to speak disapproval."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps every one does not have the opportunity, my dear," answered\r\nthe old lady, with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you must have had plenty of them. Isn\'t that so? and why did\r\nyou never accept?"\r\n\r\nElsie dropped the string she had been waving before the eyes of the\r\ncat, and looked up with eager interest.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had offers, and one of them I accepted," replied Aunt Wealthy,\r\nwith a slight sigh, while a shade of sadness stole over her usually\r\nhappy face, "but my friends interfered and the match was broken off.\r\nDon\'t follow my example, children, but marry if the right one comes\r\nalong."\r\n\r\n"Surely you don\'t mean if our parents refuse their consent, auntie?"\r\nElsie\'s tone spoke both surprise and disapproval.\r\n\r\n"No, no, child! It is to those who keep the fifth commandment God\r\npromises long life and prosperity."\r\n\r\n"And love makes it so easy and pleasant to keep it," murmured Elsie,\r\nsoftly, and with a sweet, glad smile on her lips and in her eyes,\r\nthinking of her absent father, and almost unconsciously thinking\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n"Ah, child, it can sometimes make it very hard," said Miss Stanhope,\r\nwith another little sigh, and shaking her head rather sadly.\r\n\r\n"Elsie, you must have had lots of lovers before this, I am sure!"\r\nexclaimed Lottie, stopping her machine, and facing suddenly round upon\r\nher friend. "No girl as rich and beautiful as you are could have lived\r\neighteen years without such an experience."\r\n\r\nElsie only smiled and blushed.\r\n\r\n"Come now, am I not right?" persisted Lottie.\r\n\r\n"I do assure you that I have actually lived to this mature age quite\r\nheart-whole," laughed Elsie. "If I have an idol, it is papa, and I\r\ndon\'t believe anybody can ever succeed in displacing him."\r\n\r\n"You have quite misunderstood me, wilfully or innocently--I asked of\r\nyour worshippers, not of your idols. Haven\'t you had offers?"\r\n\r\n"Several; money has strong attractions for most men, papa tells me."\r\n\r\n"May the Lord preserve you from the sad fate of a woman married for\r\nher money, dear child!" ejaculated Aunt Wealthy, with a glance of\r\nanxious affection at her lovely niece. "I\'m sometimes tempted to think\r\na large amount of it altogether a curse and an affliction."\r\n\r\n"It is a great responsibility, auntie," replied Elsie, with a look of\r\ngravity beyond her years. Then after a moment\'s pause, her expression\r\nchanging to one of gayety and joy, "Now, if you and Lottie will excuse\r\nme for a little, I\'ll run up to my room, and answer papa\'s letter,"\r\nshe said, rising to her feet. "After which I shall be ready to make\r\nmyself useful in the capacity of seamstress. Au revoir." And she\r\ntripped away with a light, free step, every movement as graceful as\r\nthose of a young gazelle.\r\n\r\nMr. Bromly Egerton, alias Tom Jackson, was fortunate enough to find\r\nMrs. Schilling at home. It was she who answered his knock.\r\n\r\n"Good-day, sir," she said. "Will you walk in? Just step into the\r\nparlor here, and take a seat."\r\n\r\nHe accepted the invitation and stated his business without preface, or\r\nwaiting to be questioned at all.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be considering for a moment. "Well, yes, I can\'t say as\r\nI\'d object to taking a few gentlemen boarders, but--I\'d want to know\r\nwho you be, and all about you."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, ma\'am, that\'s all right. I\'m from the East; rather broken\r\ndown with hard work--a business man, you see--and want to spend the\r\nsummer here to recruit. Pitched upon your town because it strikes me\r\nas an uncommonly pretty place. I brought a letter of introduction to\r\nyour neighbor, Miss Stanhope, and she recommended me to come here in\r\nsearch of board, saying you\'d make a capital landlady."\r\n\r\n"Well, if she recommends you, it\'s all right. Would you like to look\r\nat the rooms?"\r\n\r\nShe had two to dispose of--one at the back and the other in the front\r\nof the house, both cheerful, airy, of reasonable size, and neatly\r\nfurnished. He preferred the latter, because it overlooked Miss\r\nStanhope\'s house and grounds.\r\n\r\nAs he stood at the window, taking note of this, a young girl appeared\r\nat the one opposite. For one minute he had a distinct view of her face\r\nas she stood there and put out her hand to gather a blossom from the\r\nvine that had festooned itself so gracefully over the window.\r\n\r\nHe uttered an exclamation of delighted surprise, and turning to his\r\ncompanion asked, "Who is she?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Dinsmore, Miss Stanhope\'s niece. She\'s here on a visit to her\r\naunt. She\'s from the South, and worth a mint of money, they say. Aint\r\nshe handsome though? handsome as a picture?"\r\n\r\n"Posh! handsome doesn\'t begin to express it! Why, she\'s angelic! But\r\nthere! she\'s gone!" And he drew a long breath as he turned away.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better conclude to take this room if you like to look at her,"\r\nartfully suggested Mrs. Schilling. "That\'s her bedroom window, and\r\nshe\'s often at it. Besides, you can see the whole front of Miss\r\nStanhope\'s place from here, and watch all the comings and goings o\'\r\nthe girls--Miss Dinsmore, and Miss Nettie and Lottie King."\r\n\r\n"Who are they?"\r\n\r\n"Kind o\' fur-off cousins to Miss Stanhope. They live in that next\r\nhouse to hern, and are amazin\' thick with her, runnin\' in and out all\r\ntimes o\' day. Nice, spry, likely girls they be too, not bad-lookin\'\r\nneither, but hardly fit to hold a candle to Miss Dinsmore, as fur as\r\nbeauty\'s concerned. Well, what do you say to the room, Mr. Egerton?"\r\n\r\n"That I will take it, and would like to have immediate possession."\r\n\r\n"All right, sir; fetch your traps whenever you\'ve a mind; right away,\r\nif you like."\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of good society in Lansdale. It had even more than\r\nthe usual proportion of well-to-do, intelligent, educated, and refined\r\npeople to be found in American villages of its size. They were\r\nhospitable folks, too, disposed to be kind to strangers tarrying in\r\ntheir midst, and, Miss Stanhope being an old resident, well known and\r\nhighly esteemed, spite of her eccentricities, her friends had received\r\na good deal of attention. Elsie had already become slightly acquainted\r\nwith a number of pleasant families; a good many young girls, and also\r\nseveral young gentlemen had called upon her, and Lottie assured her\r\nthere were many more to come.\r\n\r\n"Some of the very nicest are apt to be slow about calling--we\'re\r\nsuch busy folks here," she said, laughing. "I\'ve a notion, too, that\r\nseveral of the beaux stood rather in awe of your papa."\r\n\r\nThey were talking together over their sewing, after Elsie had come\r\ndown from finishing her letter, and sent Chloe to the post-office with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder," she answered, looking up with a smile; "there was a\r\ntime, a long while ago, when I was very much afraid of him myself; and\r\neven now I have such a wholesome dread of his displeasure as would\r\nkeep me from any act of disobedience, if love was not sufficient to do\r\nthat without help from any other motive."\r\n\r\n"You are very fond of him, and he of you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed! how could it be otherwise when for so many years each\r\nwas all the other had? But I\'m sure, quite sure that neither of us\r\nloves the other less because now we have mamma and darling little\r\nHorace."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know them both," said Miss Stanhope. "I hope your\r\nfather will bring them with him when he comes back for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope he will! I want so much to have you know them. Mamma is so\r\ndear and sweet, almost as dear as papa himself. And Horace--well, I\r\ncan\'t believe there ever was quite such another darling to be found,"\r\nElsie continued, with a light, joyous laugh.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Aunt Wealthy with a sigh and a smile, "it is a good and\r\npleasant thing to be young and full of life and gayety, and to have\r\nkind, wise parents to look to for help and guidance. You will realize\r\nthat when you grow old and have to be a prop for others to lean upon\r\ninstead."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear auntie," Elsie answered, giving her a look of loving\r\nreverence, "but surely the passing years must have brought you so much\r\nwisdom and self-reliance that that can be no such very hard task to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Ah, child!" replied the old lady, shaking her head, "I often feel\r\nthat my stock of those is very small. But then how sweet it is to\r\nremember that I have a Father to whom I never shall grow old; never\r\ncease to be His little child, in constant need of His tender, watchful\r\ncare to guard and guide. Though the gray hairs are on my head, the\r\nwrinkles of time, sorrow, and care upon my brow, He does not think me\r\nold enough to be left to take care of myself. No; He takes my hand in\r\nHis and leads me tenderly and lovingly along, choosing each step for\r\nme, protecting me from harm, and providing for all my needs. What does\r\nHe say? \'Even to your old age I am He; and even to hoar hairs will I\r\ncarry you\'!"\r\n\r\n"Such sweet words! They almost reconcile one to growing old," murmured\r\nLottie, and Aunt Wealthy answered, with a subdued gladness in her\r\ntones, "You need not dread it, child, for does not every year bring us\r\nnearer home?"\r\n\r\nThe needles flew briskly until the dinner-bell sounded its welcome\r\nsummons.\r\n\r\n"We shall finish two at least this afternoon, I think," said Lottie,\r\nfolding up her work.\r\n\r\n"No, we\'ve had sewing enough for to-day," replied Miss Stanhope. "I\r\nhave ordered the carriage at two. We will have a drive this afternoon,\r\nand music this evening; if you and Elsie do not consider it too much\r\nof a task to play and sing for your old auntie."\r\n\r\n"A task, Aunt Wealthy! It would be a double delight--giving you\r\npleasure and ourselves enjoying the delicious tones of that splendid\r\npiano. Its fame has already spread over the whole town," she added,\r\nturning to Elsie, "and between its attractions and those of its owner,\r\nI know there\'ll be a great influx of visitors here."\r\n\r\nElsie was a very fine musician, and for her benefit during her stay in\r\nLansdale, Mr. Dinsmore had had a grand piano sent on from the East,\r\nordering it in season to have it arrive almost as soon as they\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lottie is quite right about it, Aunt Wealthy, and you shall\r\ncall for all the tunes you want," Elsie said, noticing her friend\'s\r\nprediction merely by a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know how I enjoy that piano," Lottie rattled on as they\r\nbegan their meal. "It must be vastly pleasant to have plenty of\r\nmoney and such an indulgent father as yours, Elsie. Not that I would\r\ndepreciate my own at all--I wouldn\'t exchange him even for yours--but\r\nhe, you see, has more children and less money."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think we are both blessed in our fathers," answered Elsie. "I\r\nadmire yours very much; and mine is, indeed, very indulgent, though at\r\nthe same time very strict; he never spares expense or trouble to give\r\nme pleasure. But the most delightful thing of all is to know that he\r\nloves me so very, very dearly;" and the soft eyes shone with the light\r\nof love and joy.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly tea time when they returned from their drive, some lady\r\ncallers having prevented them from setting out at the early hour\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n"Now I must run right home," said Lottie, as they alighted. "Mother\r\ncomplains that she gets no good of me at all of late."\r\n\r\n"Well, she has Nettie," returned Miss Stanhope, "and she told me Elsie\r\nand I might have all we wanted of you till the poor child gets a\r\nlittle used to her father\'s absence."\r\n\r\n"Did she, Aunt Wealthy? There, I\'ll remind her of that, and also of\r\nthe fact that Nettie is worth two of me any day."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll come back to spend the evening? Indeed you must, or how is\r\nElsie to learn her visitors\' names? You know I could never get them\r\nstraight. But there\'s the tea-bell, so come in with us. No need to go\r\nhome till bed-time, or till to-morrow, that I can see."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, but of course, auntie, I want to primp a bit, just as you\r\ndid in your young days, when the beaux were coming. So good-bye for\r\nthe present," she cried, skipping away with a merry laugh, Miss\r\nStanhope calling after her to bring Nettie along when she returned.\r\n\r\n"We have so many odd names in this town, and I such an odd sort of\r\nmemory, that I make a great many mistakes," said the old lady, leading\r\nthe way to the house.\r\n\r\nElsie thought that was all very true, when in the course of the\r\nevening she was introduced to Mr. Comings, Mr. Tizard, Mr. Stop,\r\nMiss Lock, and Miss Over, and afterward heard her aunt address them\r\nvariously as "Mr. In-and-out," "Mr. Wizard," "Mr. Lizard," "Mr. Quit,"\r\n"Miss Under," and "Miss Key."\r\n\r\nBut the old lady\'s peculiarity was so well known that no one thought\r\nof taking offence; and her mistakes caused only mirth and amusement.\r\n\r\nLottie\'s prediction was so fully verified that Elsie seemed to be\r\nholding a sort of levee.\r\n\r\n"What faultless features, exquisitely beautiful complexion, and sweet\r\nexpression she has." "What a graceful form, what pleasant, affable\r\nmanners, so entirely free from affectation or hauteur; no patronizing\r\nairs about her either, but perfect simplicity and kindliness." "And\r\nsuch a sweet, happy, intelligent face." "Such beautiful hair too;\r\ndid you notice that? so abundant, soft and glossy, and such a\r\nlovely color." "Yes, and what simple elegance of dress." "She\'s an\r\naccomplished musician, too, and has a voice as sweet, rich, and full\r\nas a nightingale\'s," remarked one and another as they went away. The\r\nunanimous verdict seemed to be, that the young stranger was altogether\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\nAcross the street, Mrs. Schilling\'s boarder paced to and fro, watching\r\nthe coming and going, listening to the merry salutations, and gay\r\nadieux, the light laughter, and the sweet strains of music and song,\r\ntill the desire to make one of the happy throng grew so strong upon\r\nhim that it was no longer to be resisted.\r\n\r\n"I will go in with those," he muttered, crossing over just in time to\r\nenter directly in the rear of a lady and gentleman, whom he saw coming\r\nup the street. "Miss Stanhope invited me to call again, without\r\nparticularizing how soon, and I can turn my speedy acceptance into a\r\ncompliment to their music, without even a white lie, for it does sound\r\nextremely attractive to a lonely, idle fellow like me."\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope met him at the door, would scarce listen to his\r\napology--insisting that "none was needed; one who had come to her with\r\nsuch an introduction from so valued a friend as Mrs. Waters, must\r\nalways be a welcome guest in her house"--and ushering him into the\r\nparlor, introduced him to her niece, and all others present.\r\n\r\nA nearer and more critical view of Elsie only increased his\r\nadmiration; he thought her the loveliest creature he had ever seen.\r\nBut it did not suit his tactics to show immediately any strong\r\nattraction toward her, or desire to win her regard. For this evening\r\nhe devoted himself almost exclusively to Miss Stanhope, exerting all\r\nhis powers to make a favorable impression upon her.\r\n\r\nIn this he was entirely successful. He had, when he chose, most\r\nagreeable and polished manners. Also he had seen much of the world,\r\npossessed a large fund of general information, and knew exactly how to\r\nuse it to the best advantage. With these gifts, very fine, expressive\r\neyes, regular features, and handsome person, no wonder he could boast\r\nhimself "a woman-killer."\r\n\r\nAunt Wealthy, though old enough to be invulnerable to Cupid\'s arrows,\r\nshowed by her warm praises, after he had left that evening, that she\r\nwas not proof against his fascinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  Your noblest natures are most credulous.\r\n\r\n  --CHAPMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBromly Egerton (we give him the name by which he had become known to\r\nour friends in Lansdale) considered it "a very lucky chance" that\r\nhad provided him a boarding-place so near the temporary home of his\r\nintended victim. He felicitated himself greatly upon it, and lost no\r\ntime in improving to the utmost all the advantages it conferred.\r\nIt soon came to be a customary thing for him to drop in at Miss\r\nStanhope\'s every day, or two or three times a day, and to join the\r\nyoung girls in their walks and drives, for, though at first paying\r\ncourt to no one but the mistress of the mansion, he gradually turned\r\nhis attention more and more to her niece and Miss King.\r\n\r\nAs their ages were so much nearer his this seemed perfectly natural,\r\nand excited no suspicion or remark. Aunt Wealthy was quite willing to\r\nresign him to them; for--a very child in innocent trustfulness--she\r\nhad no thought of any evil design on the part of the handsome,\r\nattractive young stranger so warmly recommended to her kindness and\r\nhospitality by an old and valued friend, and only rejoiced to see the\r\nyoung folks enjoying themselves so much together.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Lansdale Mr. Dinsmore had provided his daughter with a\r\ngentle, but spirited and beautiful little pony, and bade her ride out\r\nevery day when the weather was favorable, as was her custom at home.\r\nAt the same time he cautioned her never to go alone; but always to\r\nhave Simon riding in her rear, and, if possible, a lady friend at her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nDr. King was not wealthy, and having a large family to provide for,\r\nkept no horse except the one he used in his practice; but Elsie, with\r\nher well-filled purse, was more than content to furnish ponies for\r\nher friends Lottie and Nettie whenever they could accompany her; and\r\nmatters were so arranged by their indulgent mother that one or both\r\ncould do so every day.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Mr. Egerton joined them in these excursions\r\nalso, having made an arrangement with a livery-stable keeper for the\r\ndaily use of a horse. And gradually his attention, in the beginning\r\nabout equally divided between the two, or the three, were paid more\r\nand more exclusively to Elsie.\r\n\r\nShe was not pleased with him in their earlier interviews, she could\r\nscarcely have told why; but there was an intuitive feeling that he was\r\nnot one to be trusted. That, however, gradually gave way under the\r\nfascinations of his fine person, agreeable manners, and intellectual\r\nconversation. He was very plausible and captivating, she full of\r\ncharity and ready to believe the best of everybody, and so, little by\r\nlittle, he won her confidence and esteem so completely that at length\r\nshe had almost forgotten that her first impression had not been\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nHe went regularly to the church she, her aunt, and the Kings attended,\r\nappearing an interested listener, and devout worshipper; and that not\r\non the Sabbath only, but also at the regular weekday evening service;\r\nhe seemed also to choose his associates among good, Christian people.\r\nThe natural inference from all this was that he too was a Christian,\r\nor at least a professor of religion; and thus all our friends soon\r\ncame to look upon him as such, and to feel the greater friendship for,\r\nand confidence in him.\r\n\r\nHe found that Elsie\'s beauty would bear the closest scrutiny, that her\r\ngraces of person and mind were the more apparent the more thoroughly\r\nshe was known; that she was highly educated and accomplished,\r\npossessed of a keen intellect, and talents of no common order, and a\r\nwonderful sweetness of disposition. He acknowledged to himself that,\r\neven leaving money out of the question, she was a prize any man might\r\ncovet; yet that if she were poor, he would never try to win her. A\r\nmore voluptuous woman would have suited him better. Elsie\'s very\r\npurity made her distasteful to him, his own character seeming so much\r\nblackened by contrast that at times he could but loathe and despise\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut her fortune was an irresistible attraction, and he resolved more\r\nfirmly than ever to leave no stone unturned to make himself master of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe soon perceived that he had many rivals, but he possessed one\r\nadvantage over them all in his entire leisure from business, leaving\r\nhim at liberty to devote himself to her entertainment during the day\r\nas well as the evening.\r\n\r\nFor a while he greatly feared that he had a more dangerous rival at a\r\ndistance; for, watching from his windows, he saw that every morning\r\nSimon brought one or more letters from the post, and that Elsie was\r\nusually on the front porch awaiting his coming; that she would often\r\ncome flying across the lawn, meet her messenger at the gate, and\r\nsnatching her letter with eager, joyful haste, rush back to the house\r\nwith it, and disappear within the doorway. Then frequently he would\r\nsee her half an hour later looking so rosy and happy, that he could\r\nhardly hope her correspondent was other than an accepted lover.\r\n\r\nFor weeks he tormented himself with this idea; the more convinced that\r\nhe was right in his conjecture, because she almost always posted her\r\nreply with her own hands, when going out for her daily walk, or sent\r\nit by her faithful Chloe; but one day, venturing a jest upon the\r\nsubject, she answered him, with a merry laugh, "Ah, you are no\r\nYankee, Mr. Egerton, to make such a guess as that! I have a number of\r\ncorrespondents, it is true; but the daily letter I am so eager for\r\ncomes from my father."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible, Miss Dinsmore! do you really receive and answer a\r\nletter from your father every day?"\r\n\r\n"We write every day, and each receives a letter from the other every\r\nday but Sunday; on that day we never go or send to the post-office;\r\nand we write only on such subjects as are suited to the sacredness of\r\nits Sabbath rest. I give papa the text and a synopsis of the sermon I\r\nhave heard, and he does the same by me."\r\n\r\n"You must be extremely strict Sabbath-keepers."\r\n\r\n"We are, but not more so than the Bible teaches that we should be."\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t it very irksome? don\'t you find the day very long and\r\ntedious?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all; I think no other day in the week is quite so short to me,\r\nnone, I am sure, so delightful."\r\n\r\n"Then it isn\'t only because your aunt is strict too, that you go on\r\nkeeping your father\'s rules, while you are at a safe distance from\r\nhim?" he queried in a half jesting tone.\r\n\r\nElsie turned her soft eyes full upon him, as she answered with gentle\r\ngravity: "I feel that the commands of both my earthly and my heavenly\r\nFather are binding upon me at all times, and in all places, and I hope\r\nI may ever be kept from becoming an eye-servant. Love makes it easy to\r\nobey, and God\'s commands are not grievous to those who love him."\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he said; "but to go back to the letters, how\r\ncan you fill one every day to your father? I can imagine that lovers\r\nmight, in writing to each other, but fathers and daughters would not\r\nbe apt to indulge in that sort of nonsense."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie are no common father and daughter,"\r\nremarked Lottie, who had not spoken for the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\n"And can find plenty to say to each other," added Elsie, with a bright\r\nlook and smile. "Papa likes to hear just how I am spending my time,\r\nwhat I see in my walks, what new plants and flowers I find, etc.,\r\netc.; what new acquaintances I make, what books I am reading, and what\r\nI think of them."\r\n\r\n"The latter or the former?" he asked, resuming his jesting tone.\r\n\r\n"Both. And I tell him almost everything. Papa is my confidant; more so\r\nthan any other person in the world."\r\n\r\nThey were returning from a walk over the hills, and had just reached\r\nMiss Stanhope\'s gate. Mr. Egerton opened it for the ladies, closed\r\nit after them, bowed a good-morning and retired, wondering if he was\r\nmentioned in those letters to Mr. Dinsmore, and cautioning himself\r\nto be exceeding careful not to say or do a single thing which, if\r\nreported there, might be taken as a warning of danger to the heiress.\r\n\r\nThe girls ran into Miss Wealthy\'s room, and found her lamenting over a\r\nwhite muslin apron.\r\n\r\n"What is it, auntie?" Elsie asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, just look here, child, what a hole I have made in this! It had\r\ngot an ink-stain on it, and Phillis had put one of Harry\'s new shirts\r\ninto a tin basin, and iron-rusted it; so I thought I would try some\r\ncitric acid on them both; and I did; but probably made it too strong,\r\nand this is how it served the apron."\r\n\r\n"And the shirt?" asked Lottie, interested for the garment she had\r\nhelped to make.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a comfort I handled it very gingerly, and it seems to be\r\nsound yet, after I saw what this has come to."\r\n\r\n"It is quite a pity about the apron; for it really is a very pretty\r\none," said Elsie, "the acid must have been very strong."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I am sorry to have the apron ruined, but after all, I shall\r\nnot care so very much, if it only doesn\'t eat Harry\'s tail off, and it\r\nwill make a little one for some child."\r\n\r\nBoth girls laughed. It was impossible to resist the inclination to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n"The shirt\'s tail I mean, of course, and a little apron," said Miss\r\nWealthy, joining in the mirth; "that\'s where the spots all happen to\r\nbe, which is a comfort in case a piece should have to be set in."\r\n\r\n"There comes Lenwilla Ellawea; for some more light\'ning, I suppose, as\r\nI see she carries a teacup in her hand," whispered Lottie,\r\nglancing from the window, as a step sounded upon the gravel walk.\r\n"Good-morning, little sixpence; what are you after now?" she added\r\naloud, as the child appeared in the open doorway.\r\n\r\n"Mother\'s out o\' vinegar, and dinner\'s just ready, and the\r\ngentleman\'ll want some for his salad, and there aint no time to send\r\nto the grocery. And mother says, will you lend her a teacupful, Aunt\r\nWealthy? And she\'s goin\' to have some folks there to-night, and she\r\nsays you\'re all to come over."\r\n\r\n"Tell her we\'re obliged, and she\'s welcome to the vinegar," said Miss\r\nStanhope, taking the cup and giving it to Chloe to fill. "But what\r\nsort of company is it to be?"\r\n\r\n"I dunno; ladies and gentlemen, but no married folks, I heard her say.\r\nShe\'s goin\' to have nuts, and candies, and things to hand round, and\r\nyou\'d better come. I hope that pretty lady will," in a stage whisper,\r\nbending toward Miss Stanhope, as she spoke, and nodding at Elsie.\r\n\r\nAll three laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll try to coax her," said Aunt Wealthy, as Chloe re-entered\r\nthe room. "And here\'s your vinegar. You\'d better hurry home with it."\r\n\r\n"Aunt Wealthy, you can\'t want me to go there!" cried Elsie, as the\r\nchild passed out of hearing. "Why, the woman is not a lady, and I am\r\nsure papa would be very unwilling to have me make an associate of her.\r\nHe is very particular about such matters."\r\n\r\n"She is not educated or very refined, it is true, my child; and I must\r\nacknowledge is a little silly, too; but she is a clever, kind-hearted\r\nwoman, a member of the same church with myself, and a near neighbor\r\nwhom I should feel sorry to hurt; and I am sure she would be much hurt\r\nif you should stay away, and deeply gratified by your attendance at\r\nher little party."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t miss it for anything!" cried Lottie, pirouetting about the\r\nroom, laughing and clapping her hands; "she has such comical ways of\r\ntalking and acting. I know it will be real fun. You won\'t think of\r\nstaying away, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"I really do not believe your father would object, if he were here, my\r\nchild," added Miss Stanhope, laying her hand on her niece\'s shoulder\r\nand looking at her with a kindly persuasive smile.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, auntie; and he bade me obey you in his absence; so if\r\nyou bid me, I will go," Elsie answered, returning the smile, and\r\ntouching her ruby lips to the faded cheek.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a dear," cried Lottie. "Hold her to her word, Aunt Wealthy.\r\nAnd now I must run home, and see if Nettie\'s had an invite, and what\r\nshe\'s going to wear."\r\n\r\nThe ladies were just leaving the dinner-table, when Mrs. Schilling\r\ncame rushing in. "Oh, excuse my informality in not waiting to ring,\r\nMiss Stanhope; but I\'m in the biggest kind of a hurry. I\'ve just put\r\nup my mind to make some sponge-cake for to-night, and I thought I\'d\r\nbest run over and get your prescription; you always have so much\r\nbetter luck than me. I don\'t know whether it\'s all in the luck though,\r\nor whether it\'s partly the difference in prescriptions--I know some\r\nfollows one, and some another--and so, if you\'ll let me have yours,\r\nI\'ll be a thousand times obliged."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, Mrs. Sixpence, you\'ll be as many times welcome," returned\r\nAunt Wealthy, going for her receipt-book. "It\'s not to be a large\r\nparty, is it?" she asked, coming back.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am, just a dozen or so of the young folks; such ladies and\r\ngentlemen which I thought would be agreeable to meet Miss Dinsmore. I\r\nhope you\'ll both be over and bright and early too; for I\'ve heard say\r\nyou don\'t never keep very late hours, Miss Dinsmore."\r\n\r\n"No, papa does not approve of them; not for me at least. He is so\r\ncareful of me, so anxious that I should keep my health."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m sure that\'s all right and kind. But you\'ll come, both\r\nof you, won\'t you?" And receiving an assurance that such was their\r\nintention, she hurried away as fast as she had come.\r\n\r\n"I wonder she cares to make a party when she must do all the work of\r\npreparing for it herself," said Elsie, looking after her as she sped\r\nacross the lawn.\r\n\r\n"She is strong and healthy, and used to work; and doubtless feels\r\nthat it will be some honor and glory to be able to boast of having\r\nentertained the Southern heiress who is visiting Lansdale," Miss\r\nStanhope answered in a half-jesting tone.\r\n\r\nElsie looked amused, then grave, as she replied: "It is rather\r\nhumbling to one\'s pride to be valued merely or principally on account\r\nof one\'s wealth."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but, dearie, those who know you don\'t value you for that, but\r\nfor your own dear, lovable self. My darling, your old aunt is growing\r\nvery fond of you, and can hardly bear to think how soon your father\r\nwill be coming to carry you away again," she added, twinkling away a\r\ntear, as she took the soft, white hand, and pressed it affectionately\r\nin both her own.\r\n\r\n"And I shall be so sorry to leave you, auntie. I wish we could carry\r\nyou away with us. I have so often thought how happy my friend Lucy\r\nCarrington ought to be in having such a nice grandma. I have never\r\nhad one, you know; for papa\'s stepmother would never own me for her\r\ngrandchild; but you seem to be the very one I have always longed for."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear," and Miss Stanhope sighed, slightly. "Had your own\r\ngrandmother, my sweet and dear sister Eva, been spared to this time,\r\nyou would have had one to love and be proud of. Now, do you want to\r\ntake a siesta? you must feel tired after this morning\'s long tramp,\r\nI should think, and I want you to be very bright and fresh to-night,\r\nthat it may not harm you if you should happen to be kept up a little\r\nlater than usual. You see I want to take such care of you, that when\r\nyour father comes he can see only improvement in you, and feel willing\r\nto let me have you again some day."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, you dear old auntie!" Elsie answered, giving her a hug.\r\n"I\'m sure even he could hardly be more kindly careful of me than you\r\nare. But I am not very tired, and sitting in an easy-chair will give\r\nme all the rest I need. Haven\'t you some work for me? I\'ve done\r\nnothing but enjoy myself in the most idle fashion all day."\r\n\r\n"No, my sewing\'s all done now that the shirts are finished. But I must\r\nlie down whether you will or not. I can\'t do without my afternoon\r\nnap."\r\n\r\n"Yes, do, auntie; and I shall begin to-morrow\'s letter to papa;\r\nfinishing it in the morning with an account of the party."\r\n\r\nShe was busy with her writing when Lottie burst in upon her.\r\n\r\n"I ran in," she said, "to propose that we all go over there together,\r\nand to ask you to come into our house when you\'re dressed. Nettie and\r\nI are going to try a new style of doing up our hair, and we want your\r\nopinion about its becomingness."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be happy to give it for what it is worth."\r\n\r\n"By the way, I admire your style extremely; but of course no one could\r\nimitate it who was not blessed with a heavy suit of natural curls. You\r\nalways wear it one way, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa likes it so, but until within the last year, he would not\r\nlet me have it in a comb at all."\r\n\r\nShe wore it now gathered into a loose knot behind, and falling over\r\na comb, in a rich mass of shining curls, while in front it waved and\r\nrippled above her white forehead, or fell over it, in soft, tiny,\r\ngolden brown rings.\r\n\r\n"It is so beautiful!" continued Lottie, passing her hand caressingly\r\nover it; "and so is its wearer. Oh, if I were only a gentleman!"\r\n\r\n"You don\'t wish it," said Elsie, laughing. "I don\'t believe a real,\r\nwomanly woman ever does."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t, hey? Well, I must go; for I\'ve a lot to do to Lot King\'s\r\nwearing apparel. Adieu, mon cher. Nay, don\'t disturb yourself to come\r\nto the door."\r\n\r\nElsie came down to tea ready dressed for the evening, in simple white,\r\nwith a white rose in her hair.\r\n\r\n"I like your taste in dress, child," said Aunt Wealthy, regarding her\r\nwith affectionate admiration. "The rose in your hair is lovely, and\r\nyou seem to me like a fresh, fair, sweet flower, yourself."\r\n\r\n"Ah, how pleasant it is to be loved, auntie, for love always sees\r\nthrough rose-colored spectacles," answered the young girl gayly.\r\n\r\n"I promised Lottie to run in there for a moment to give my opinion\r\nabout their appearance," she said, as they rose from the table. "I\'ll\r\nnot be gone long; and they\'re to come in and go with us."\r\n\r\nShe found her friends in the midst of their hair-dressing.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a bore?" cried Lottie. "How fortunate you are in never\r\nhaving to do this for yourself."\r\n\r\n"Why," said Elsie, "I was just admiring your independence, and feeling\r\nashamed of my own helplessness."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever try it," asked Nettie; "doing your own hair, I mean?"\r\n\r\n"No, never."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever dress yourself?"\r\n\r\n"No, I own that I have never so much as put on my own shoes and\r\nstockings," Elsie answered with a blush, really mortified at the\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is rather nice to be able to help yourself," remarked Lottie\r\ncomplacently. "There! mine\'s done; what do you think of it, Miss\r\nDinsmore?"\r\n\r\n"That it is very pretty and extremely becoming. Girls, mammy will\r\ndress your hair for you at any time, if you wish."\r\n\r\n"Oh, a thousand thanks!" exclaimed Nettie. "Do you think she would be\r\nwilling to come over and do mine now? I really can\'t get it to suit\r\nme, and I know Lot wants to put on her dress."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll go back and send her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; don\'t go yet; can\'t we send for her?"\r\n\r\n"That would do; but I told Aunt Wealthy I wouldn\'t stay long; so I\r\nthink I\'d better go. Perhaps I can be of use to her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe she\'ll need any help with her toilet," said Lottie,\r\n"she does it all her own way; but I daresay she grudges every minute\r\nof your company. I know I should. Isn\'t she sweet and lovely, and good\r\nas she can be?" she added to her sister as Elsie left the room.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and how tastefully she dresses; everything is rich and\r\nbeautiful, yet so simply elegant; what magnificent lace she wears, and\r\nwhat jewelry; yet not a bit too much of either."\r\n\r\n"And she knows all about harmony of colors, and what suits her style;\r\nthough I believe she would look well in anything."\r\n\r\nThere was a communicating gate between Dr. King\'s grounds and Miss\r\nStanhope\'s, and Elsie gained her aunt\'s house by crossing the two\r\ngardens. As she stepped upon the porch, she saw Mr. Egerton standing\r\nbefore the door.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening, Miss Dinsmore," he said, bowing and smiling. "I was\r\njust about to ring; but I presume that is not necessary now."\r\n\r\n"No, not at all. Walk into the parlor, and help yourself to a seat.\r\nAnd if you will please excuse me I shall be there in a moment."\r\n\r\n"I came to ask if I might have the pleasure of escorting you to the\r\nparty," he said laughingly, as she returned from giving Chloe her\r\ndirections, and asking if her aunt needed any assistance.\r\n\r\n"Thank you; but you are taking unnecessary trouble," she answered\r\ngayly, "since it is only across the street, and there are four of us\r\nto keep each other company."\r\n\r\n"The Misses King are going with you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; they are not quite ready yet; but it is surely too early to\r\nthink of going?"\r\n\r\n"A little; but Mrs. Schilling is anxious to see you as soon as\r\npossible; particularly as she understands there is no hope of keeping\r\nyou after ten o\'clock. Do you really always observe such early hours?"\r\n\r\n"As a rule, yes. I believe the medical authorities agree that it is\r\nthe way to retain one\'s youth and health."\r\n\r\n"And beauty," he added, with an admiring glance at her blooming face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"I do believe we shall be almost the first; very unfashionably early,"\r\nremarked Nettie King, as their little party crossed the street.\r\n\r\n"We are not the first, I have seen several go in," rejoined Aunt\r\nWealthy, as Mr. Egerton held open the gate for them to pass in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schilling in gay attire, streamers flying, cheeks glowing, and\r\neyes beaming with delight, met them at the door, and invited them to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ladies, good-evening. How do you all do? I\'m powerful glad you\r\ncame so early. Walk right into the parlor."\r\n\r\nShe ushered them in as she spoke. Four or five young misses were\r\nstanding about the centre-table, looking at prints, magazines, and\r\nphotographs, while Lenwilla Ellawea, arrayed in her Sunday best, had\r\nensconced herself in a large cushioned rocking-chair; she was leaning\r\nlazily back in it, and stretching out her feet in a way to show her\r\nshoes and stockings to full advantage. Mrs. Schilling had singular\r\ntaste in dress. The child wore a Swiss muslin over a red flannel\r\nskirt, and her lower limbs were encased in black stockings and blue\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n"Daughter Lenwilla Ellawea, subside that chair!" exclaimed the mother,\r\nwith a wave of her hand. "You should know better than to take the best\r\nseat, when ladies are standing. Miss Stanhope, do me the honor to take\r\nthat chair. I assure you, you will find it most commodious. Take a\r\nseat on the sofy, Miss Dinsmore, and--ah, that is right, Mr. Egerton,\r\nyou know how to attend to the ladies."\r\n\r\nGreetings and introductions were exchanged; an uncomfortable pause\r\nfollowed, then a young lady, with a magazine open on the table before\r\nher, broke the silence by remarking: "What sweet verses these are!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Schilling, looking over her shoulder, "I quite agree\r\nin that sentiment. Indeed, she\'s my favorite author."\r\n\r\n"Who?" asked Mr. Egerton.\r\n\r\n"Anon."\r\n\r\n"Ah! does she write much for that periodical?" he asked, with assumed\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she has a piece in nearly every number; sometimes two of\r\n\'em."\r\n\r\n"That\'s my pap, that is," said Lenwilla Ellawea, addressing a second\r\nyoung lady, who was slowly turning the leaves of a photograph album.\r\n\r\n"Is it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and we\'ve got two or three other picters of him."\r\n\r\n"Photographs, Lenwilla Ellawea," corrected her mother. "Yes, we\'ve got\r\nseveral. Miss Stanhope, do you know there\'s a sculpture in town? and\r\nwhat do you think? He wants to make a basque relief out o\' one o\' them\r\nphotographs of my \'Lijah. But I don\'t know as I\'ll let him. Would\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nA smile trembled about the corners of Elsie\'s lips, and she carefully\r\navoided the glance of Lottie\'s eyes, which she knew were dancing with\r\nfun, while there was a half-suppressed titter from the girls at the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"I really can\'t say I understand exactly what it is," said Aunt\r\nWealthy dubiously.\r\n\r\n"What sort of looking creature is a sculpture, Mrs. Schilling?" asked\r\nMr. Egerton.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me; there\'s some more company coming," she answered, hurrying\r\nfrom the room.\r\n\r\n"My good landlady is really quite an amusing person," he observed in\r\nan aside to Elsie, near to whom he had seated himself.\r\n\r\nShe made no response. The newly-arrived guests were being ushered in,\r\nand there were fresh greetings and introductions to be gone through\r\nwith. Then conversation became quite brisk, and after a little, it\r\nseeming to be understood that all invited, or expected, were present\r\nsome one proposed playing games. They tried several of the quieter\r\nkind, then Lottie King proposed "Stage-coach."\r\n\r\n"Lot likes that because she\'s a regular romp," said her sister.\r\n\r\n"And because she tells the story so well; she\'s just splendid at it!"\r\ncried two or three voices. "Will you take that part if we agree to\r\nplay it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if no one else wants it."\r\n\r\n"No danger of that. We\'ll play it. Miss Dinsmore, will you take part?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I never heard of the game before, and should not know what\r\nto do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s easy to understand. Each player--except the\r\nstory-teller--takes the name of some part of the stage-coach, or\r\nsomething connected with it;--one is the wheels, another the window,\r\nanother the whip, another the horses, driver, and so on, and so on.\r\nAfter all are named and seated--leaving one of their number out, and\r\nno vacancy in the circle--the one left out stands in the centre, and\r\nbegins a story, in which he or she introduces the names chosen by the\r\nothers as often as possible. Each must be on the qui vive, and the\r\ninstant his name is pronounced, jump up, turn round once and sit down\r\nagain. If he neglects to do so, he has to pay a forfeit. If the\r\nword stage-coach is pronounced, all spring up and change seats; the\r\nstory-teller securing one, if he can and leaving some one else to try\r\nhis hand at that."\r\n\r\nLottie acquitted herself well; Mr. Egerton followed, doing even\r\nbetter; then Aunt Wealthy was the one left out, and with her crooked\r\nsentences and backward or opposite rendering of names caused shouts\r\nof merriment. The selling of the forfeits which followed was no less\r\nmirth-provoking. Then the refreshments were brought in; first, several\r\nkinds of cake--the sponge and the farmers\' fruit-cake, made after Miss\r\nStanhope\'s prescription, as Mrs. Schilling informed her guests, and\r\none or two other sorts. Elsie declined them all, saying that she never\r\nate anything in the evening.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now that\'s too bad, Miss Dinsmore! do take a little bit of\r\nsomething," urged her hostess; "I shall feel real hurt if you don\'t;\r\nit looks just as if you didn\'t think my victuals good enough for you\r\nto eat."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you must not think that," replied Elsie, blushing deeply.\r\n"Your cake looks very nice, but I always decline evening refreshments;\r\nand that solely because of the injury it would be to my health to\r\nindulge in them."\r\n\r\n"Why, you aint delicate, are you? You don\'t look so; you\'ve as healthy\r\na color as ever I see; not a bit like as though you had the dyspepsy."\r\n\r\n"No, I have never had a touch of dyspepsia, and I think my freedom\r\nfrom it is largely owing to papa\'s care of me in regard to what I eat\r\nand when. He has never allowed me to eat cake in the evening."\r\n\r\n"Well, I do say! you\'re the best girl to mind your pa that ever I see!\r\nBut you\'re growed up now--\'most of age, I should judge--and I reckon\r\nyou\'ve a sort o\' right to decide such little matters for yourself. I\r\ndon\'t believe a bit o\' either of these would hurt you a mite; and\r\nif it should make you a little out o\' sorts just you take a dose of\r\nspirits of pneumonia. That\'s my remedy for sick stomic, and it cures\r\nme right up, it does."\r\n\r\nElsie smiled, but again gently but firmly declined. "Please don\'t\r\ntempt me any more, Mrs. Schilling," she said; "for it is a temptation,\r\nI assure you."\r\n\r\n"Well, p\'raps you\'ll like the next course better," rejoined her\r\nhostess, moving on.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a splendid cook and the cake is really nice," remarked Lottie\r\nKing in a low tone, close at her friend\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Dinsmore, you\'d better try a little of it; I don\'t believe\r\nit would hurt you, even so much as to call for the spirits of\r\npneumonia," said Egerton, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, look!" whispered Lottie, her eyes twinkling with merriment, "here\r\ncomes the second course served up in the most original style."\r\n\r\nMrs. Schilling had disappeared for a moment, to return bearing a\r\nwooden bucket filled with a mixture of candies, raisins and almonds,\r\nand was passing it around among her guests, inviting each to take a\r\nhandful.\r\n\r\n"Now, Miss Dinsmore, you won\'t refuse to try a few of these?" she\r\nsaid persuasively, as she neared their corner, "I shall be real\r\ndisappointed if you do."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to decline your kind offer, even more for my own\r\nsake than yours," returned Elsie, laughing and blushing; "for I am\r\nextremely fond of confectionery; but I must say no, thank you."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Egerton, do you think \'twas because my cakes and things wasn\'t\r\ngood enough for her that she wouldn\'t taste \'em?" asked his landlady,\r\nin an aggrieved tone, as the last of the guests departed.\r\n\r\nElsie had gone an hour before, he having had the pleasure of escorting\r\nher and Miss Stanhope across the street, leaving them at their own\r\ndoor; but he did not need to ask whom Mrs. Schilling meant.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not at all, my good woman!" he answered. "It was nothing but\r\nfilial obedience joined to the fear of losing her exuberant health.\r\nVery wise, too, though your refreshments were remarkably nice."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mrs. Sixpence," Lottie King was saying to her sister at that\r\nmoment, "she whispered to me that though her party had gone off so\r\nsplendidly, she had had two great disappointments,--in Mr. Wert\'s\r\nabsenting himself, and the refusal of the Southern heiress to so much\r\nas taste her carefully prepared dainties."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  A goodly apple rotten at the heart;\r\n  O what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\r\n\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE\'S "MERCHANT OF VENICE."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn mental power, education, good looks, courtly manners, and general\r\ninformation Mr. Egerton was decidedly superior to any of the young men\r\nresident in Lansdale; and of this fact no one was better aware than,\r\nhimself. He did not confine his attentions to Elsie, and soon found\r\nhimself a prime favorite among the ladies of the town. No female\r\ncoquette ever coveted the admiration of the other sex more than he,\r\nor sought more assiduously to gain it. He carried on numerous small\r\nflirtations among the belles of the place, yet paid court to Elsie\r\nmuch oftener than to any one else, using every art of which he was\r\nmaster in the determined effort to win her affection and to make\r\nhimself necessary to her happiness.\r\n\r\nHe had read many books and seen much of life, having travelled all\r\nover our own country, and visited both Europe and South America; and\r\npossessing a retentive memory, fine descriptive powers, a fund of\r\nhumor, and a decided talent for mimicry, was able, when he chose, to\r\nmake his conversation exceedingly amusing and interesting, and very\r\ninstructive. Also, he seemed all that was good and noble, and she soon\r\ngave him a very warm place in her regard; much warmer than she herself\r\nat first suspected.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account--and probably it was the truth--Bromly\r\nEgerton had had many hair-breadth escapes from sudden and violent\r\ndeath. He was telling of one of these in which he had risked and\r\nnearly lost his life from mere love of adventure. Elsie shuddered, and\r\ndrew a long breath of relief, as the story reached its close.\r\n\r\n"Does it frighten you to hear of such things?" he asked, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it seems to me a dreadful thing to risk the loss of one\'s life,\r\nwhen there is no good to ourselves or others to be gained by it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, if you were a man or boy you would understand that more than half\r\nthe charm of such adventures lies in the risk."\r\n\r\n"But is it right, or wise?"\r\n\r\n"A mere matter of taste, or choice, I should say--a long dull life, or\r\na short and lively one."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face had grown very grave. "Are those really your sentiments,\r\nMr. Egerton?" she asked, in a pained, disappointed tone. "I had\r\nthought better of you."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand; have I said anything very dreadful?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not a sin to throw away the life which God has given us to be\r\nused in His service?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, perhaps that may be so; but I had not looked at it in precisely\r\nthat way. I had only thought of the fact that life in this world is\r\nnot so very delightful that one need be anxious to continue it for a\r\nhundred years. We grow tired of it at times, and are almost ready to\r\nthrow it away; to use your expression."\r\n\r\n"Ah, before doing that we should be very sure of going to a better\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"But how can we be sure of that, or, indeed, of anything? What is\r\nthere that we know absolutely, and beyond question? how can I be sure\r\nof even my own existence? how do I know that I am what I believe\r\nmyself to be? There are crazy men who firmly believe themselves kings\r\nand princes, or something else quite as far from the truth; and how do\r\nI know that I am not as much mistaken as they?"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a look of grieved surprise, and he laughingly asked,\r\n"Well, now, Miss Dinsmore, is there anything of which you really are\r\nabsolutely certain? or you, Miss King?" as Lottie drew near the log on\r\nwhich the two were seated.\r\n\r\nThey had taken a long ramble through the woods that morning, and\r\nEgerton and Elsie had some ten minutes before sat down here to rest\r\nand wait for their companions, who had wandered a little from the path\r\nthey were pursuing.\r\n\r\n"Cogito, ergo sum," she answered gayly, "Also I am sure we have had a\r\nvery pleasant walk. But isn\'t it time we were moving toward home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," Elsie answered, consulting her watch.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pretty little thing," observed Egerton. "May I look at it?"\r\nAnd he held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"One of papa\'s birthday gifts to his petted only daughter," she said,\r\nwith a smile, as she allowed him to take it. "I value it very highly\r\non that account even more than for its intrinsic worth; though it is\r\nan excellent time-keeper."\r\n\r\n"It must have cost a pretty penny; the pearls and diamonds alone must\r\nbe worth quite a sum," he said, turning it about and examining it with\r\neager interest. "I would be careful, Miss Dinsmore, how I let it be\r\nknown that I carried anything so valuable about me, or wore it into\r\nlonely places, such as these woods," he added, as he returned it to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I never come out alone," she said, looking slightly anxious and\r\ntroubled; "papa laid his commands upon me never to do so; but I shall\r\nleave it at home in future."\r\n\r\n"Riches bring cares; that\'s the way I comfort myself in my poverty,"\r\nremarked Lottie, lightly. "But, Elsie, my dear, don\'t allow anxious\r\nfears to disturb you; we are a very moral people at Lansdale; I never\r\nheard of a robbery there yet."\r\n\r\n"I believe I am naturally rather timid," said Elsie, "yet I seldom\r\nsuffer from fear. I always feel very safe when papa is near to protect\r\nme, and our Heavenly Father\'s care is always about us."\r\n\r\n"That reminds me that you have not answered my question," remarked\r\nEgerton, switching off the head of a clover-blossom with his cane. "Is\r\nthe care you speak of one thing of which you feel certain?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and there are others."\r\n\r\n"May I ask what?"\r\n\r\nShe turned her sweet, soft eyes full upon him as she answered in low,\r\nclear tones, "\'I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no\r\ngood thing.\' \'I know that my Redeemer liveth.\' \'I know that it shall\r\nbe well with them that fear God.\'"\r\n\r\n"You are quoting?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, from a book that I know is true. Do you doubt it, Mr. Egerton?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Miss Dinsmore, you do not take me for an infidel, surely?"\r\n\r\n"No, until to-day I had hoped you were a Christian."\r\n\r\nHer eyes were downcast now, and there were tears in her voice as she\r\nspoke. He saw he had made a false step and lowered himself in her\r\nesteem, yet, remembering his talk with Arthur, he felt certain he\r\ncould more than retrieve that error. And he grew exultant in the\r\nthought of the evident pain the discovery of his unbelief had caused\r\nher. "She does care for me; I believe the prize is even now almost\r\nwithin my reach," he said to himself, as they silently pursued their\r\nway into the town, no one speaking again until they parted at Miss\r\nStanhope\'s gate.\r\n\r\nElsie, usually full of innocent mirth and gladness, was very quiet at\r\ndinner that day, and Aunt Wealthy, watching her furtively, thought she\r\nnoticed an unwonted shade of sadness on the fair face.\r\n\r\n"What is it, dear?" she asked at length; "something seems to have gone\r\nwrong with you."\r\n\r\nThe young girl replied by repeating the substance of the morning\'s\r\ntalk with Mr. Egerton, and expressing her disappointment at the\r\ndiscovery that he was not the Christian man she had taken him to be.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps what you have taken in earnest, was but spoken in jest, my\r\nchild," said Miss Stanhope.\r\n\r\n"Ah, auntie, but a Christian surely could not say such things even\r\nin jest," she answered, with a little sigh, and a look of sorrowful\r\nconcern on her face.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, Elsie sat reading in the abode of the vine-covered\r\nporch, while her aunt enjoyed her customary after-dinner nap. She\r\npresently heard the gate swing to, and the next moment Mr. Egerton was\r\nhelping himself to a seat by her side.\r\n\r\n"I hope I don\'t intrude, Miss Dinsmore," he began, assuming a slightly\r\nembarrassed air.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not at all," she answered, closing her book; "but aunt is\r\nlying down, and--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, no matter; I wouldn\'t have her disturbed for the world; and in\r\nfact I am rather glad of the opportunity of seeing you alone. I--I\r\nhave been thinking a good deal of that talk we had this morning,\r\nand--I am really quite shocked at the sentiments I then expressed,\r\nthough they were spoken more than half in jest. Miss Dinsmore, I am\r\nnot a Christian, but--but I want to be, and would, if I only knew how;\r\nand I\'ve come to you to learn the way; for somehow I seem to feel that\r\nyou could make the thing plainer to me than any one else. What must I\r\ndo first?"\r\n\r\nGlad tears shone in the soft eyes she lifted to his face as she\r\nanswered, "\'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.\'\r\nBelieve, \'only believe.\'"\r\n\r\n"But I must do something?"\r\n\r\n"\'Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts,\r\nand let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him, and\r\nto our God, for He will abundantly pardon.\'"\r\n\r\nThe man was an arrant knave and hypocrite, simulating anxiety about\r\nhis soul\'s salvation only for the purpose of ingratiating himself\r\nwith Elsie; but "the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God,"\r\npricked him for the moment, as she wielded it in faith and prayer.\r\nWhat ways, what thoughts were his! Truly they had need to be forsaken\r\nif he would hope ever to see that holy city of which we are told\r\n"There shall in no wise enter it anything that defileth, neither\r\nwhatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie."\r\n\r\nFor a moment he sat silent and abashed before the gentle, earnest\r\nyoung Christian, feeling her very purity a reproach, and fearing that\r\nshe must read his hypocrisy and the baseness of his motives in his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nBut hers was a most innocent and unsuspicious nature, apt to believe\r\nothers as true and honest as herself. She went on presently. "It is so\r\nbeautifully simple and easy,--God\'s way of saving us poor sinners:\r\nit is its very simplicity that so stumbles wise men and women, while\r\nlittle children, in their sweet trustfulness, just taking God at His\r\nword, understand it without any difficulty." She spoke in a musing\r\ntone, not looking at Egerton at all, but with her eyes fixed\r\nmeditatingly upon the floor.\r\n\r\nHe perceived that she had no doubts of his sincerity, and rallying\r\nfrom the thrust she had so unconsciously given him, went on with the\r\nrole he had laid down for himself.\r\n\r\n"I fear I am one of the wise ones you speak of, for I confess I do not\r\nsee the way yet. Can you not explain it more fully?"\r\n\r\n"I will try," she said. "You believe that you are a sinner deserving\r\nof God\'s wrath?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You have broken His law, and His justice demands your punishment; but\r\nJesus has kept its requirements, and borne its penalty in your\r\nstead, and now offers you his righteousness and salvation as a free\r\ngift,--\'without money and without price.\'"\r\n\r\n"But what am I to do?"\r\n\r\n"Simply take the offered gift."\r\n\r\n"But how? I fear I must seem very obtuse, but I really do not\r\ncomprehend."\r\n\r\n"Then ask for the teachings of the Spirit; ask Jesus to give you\r\nrepentance and faith. \'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye\r\nshall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you; for every one\r\nthat asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that\r\nknocketh, it shall be opened."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s voice was low and pleading, her tones were tremulous with\r\nearnest entreaty, the eyes she lifted to his face were half filled\r\nwith tears; for she felt that the eternal interests of her hearer were\r\ntrembling in the balance.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her admiringly, and, lost in the contemplation of her\r\nbeauty, had almost betrayed himself by his want of interest in what\r\nshe was saying. But just then Miss Stanhope joined them, and shortly\r\nafter he took his leave.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Egerton played his part with consummate skill,\r\ndeceiving Elsie so completely that she had not the slightest doubt of\r\nhis being an humble, penitent, rejoicing believer; and great were her\r\njoy and thankfulness when he told her that she had been the means of\r\nleading him to Christ; that her words had made the way plain to him,\r\nas he had never been able to see it before. It seemed to her a very\r\ntender, strong tie between them, and he appeared to feel it to be so\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nShe was not conscious of looking upon him in the light of a lover, but\r\nhe saw with secret exultation that he was fast winning her heart; he\r\nread it in the flushing of her cheek and the brightening of her eye at\r\nhis approach, and in many other unmistakable signs. He wrote to Arthur\r\nthat the prize was nearly won; so nearly that he had no doubt of his\r\nultimate success.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll not be long now about finishing up the job," he continued;\r\n"it\'s such precious hard work to be so good and pious all the time,\r\nthat I can hardly wait till matters are fully ripe for action. I\'m\r\nin constant danger of letting the mask slip aside in some unguarded\r\nmoment, and so undoing the whole thing after the world of trouble it\r\nhas cost me. It\'s no joke, I can assure you, for a man of my tastes\r\nand habits to lead the sort of life I\'ve led for the last three\r\nmonths, I believe I\'d give her up this minute, fortune and all, if the\r\nwinning of them would lay me under the necessity of continuing it for\r\nthe rest of my days, or even for any length of time. But once the knot\r\nis tied, and the property secured, there\'ll be an end of this farce.\r\nI\'ll let her know I\'m done with cant, will neither talk it nor listen\r\nto it."\r\n\r\nArthur Dinsmore\'s face darkened as he read, and in a sudden burst of\r\nfury he tore the letter into fragments, then threw them into the empty\r\ngrate. He was not yet so hardened as to feel willing to see Elsie in\r\nthe power of such a heartless wretch, such a villain as he knew Tom\r\nJackson to be. Many times already had he bitterly repented of having\r\ntold him of her wealth, and helped him to an acquaintance with her.\r\nHis family pride revolted against the connection, and some latent\r\naffection for his niece prompted him to save her from the life of\r\nmisery that must be hers as the wife of one so utterly devoid of honor\r\nor integrity.\r\n\r\nYet Arthur lacked the moral courage to face the disagreeable\r\nconsequences of a withdrawal from his compact with Jackson, and a\r\nconfession to his father or Horace of the wretch\'s designs upon Elsie\r\nand his own disgraceful entanglement with him. He concluded to take a\r\nmiddle course. He wrote immediately to Jackson, somewhat haughtily,\r\nadvising him at once to give up the whole thing.\r\n\r\n"You will inevitably fail to accomplish your end," he said. "Elsie\r\nwill never marry without her father\'s consent, and that you will find\r\nit utterly impossible to gain. Horace is too sharp to be hoodwinked or\r\ndeceived, even by you. He will ferret out your whole past, lay bare\r\nthe whole black record of your rascalities and hypocrisies, and forbid\r\nhis daughter ever again to hold the slightest communication with you.\r\nAnd she will obey if it kills her on the spot."\r\n\r\n"There\'s some comfort in that last reflection," muttered Arthur to\r\nhimself, as he folded and sealed his epistle; "no danger of the rascal\r\ngetting into the family."\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Egerton took this letter from the post-office in\r\nLansdale. He read it with a scowl on his brow. "Ah! I see your game,\r\nyoung man," he muttered with an oath, "but you\'ll find that you\'ve got\r\nhold of the wrong customer. My reply shall be short and sweet, and\r\nquite to the point."\r\n\r\nIt ran thus: "Your warning and advice come too late, my young friend;\r\nthe mischief is already wrought, and however unworthy your humble\r\nservant may be deemed by yourself or others of its members to become\r\nconnected with the illustrious D---- family, they will find they\r\ncannot help themselves; the girl loves me, and believes in me, and I\r\ndefy all the fathers and relations in creation to keep us apart." Then\r\nfollowed some guarded allusions to various sums of borrowed money, and\r\nso-called "debts of honor," and to some compact by which they were to\r\nbe annulled, accompanied by a threat of exposure if that agreement\r\nwere not kept to the very letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  Thou shall not see me blush,\r\n  Nor change my countenance for this arrest.\r\n\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE\'S "HENRY VI.," PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sultry summer night. In the grounds of one of the largest and\r\nmost beautiful of the many elegant country seats to be found in the\r\nsuburbs of Cincinnati two gentlemen were pacing leisurely to and fro.\r\n\r\nThey were friends who had met that day for the first time in several\r\nyears; strongly attached friends, spite of a very considerable\r\ndifference in their ages. They had had much to say to each other for\r\nthe first few hours, but it was now several minutes since either had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken by the younger of the two exclaiming in a tone\r\nof hearty congratulation, "This is a magnificent place, Beresford! It\r\ndoes my heart good to see you so prosperous!"\r\n\r\n"It is a fine place, Travilla, but," and he heaved a deep sigh, "I\r\nsometimes fear my wealth is to prove anything but a blessing to my\r\nchildren; that in fact my success in acquiring it is to be the ruin of\r\nmy first-born."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I hope not! Is Rudolph not doing well?"\r\n\r\n"Well?" groaned the father, dropping his head upon his breast, "he\r\nseems to be rushing headlong to destruction. Have you not noticed his\r\npoor mother\'s sad and careworn look? or mine? That boy is breaking\r\nour hearts. I could not speak of it to every one, but to you, my\r\nlong-tried friend, I feel that I may unburden myself, sure of genuine\r\nsympathy--" And he went on to tell how his son, becoming early imbued\r\nwith the idea that his father\'s wealth precluded all necessity of\r\nexertion on his part, had grown up in habits of idleness that led to\r\ndissipation, and going on from bad to worse, was now a drunkard, a\r\ngambler, and frequenter of low haunts of vice.\r\n\r\n"Day and night he is a heavy burden upon our hearts," continued the\r\nunhappy father; "when he is with us we find it most distressing to\r\nbehold the utter wreck his excesses are making of him, and when he\r\nis out of our sight it is still worse; for we don\'t know what sin\r\nor danger he may be running into. Indeed at times we are almost\r\ndistracted. Ah, Travilla, much as I love my wife and children, I\r\nam half tempted to envy your bachelor exemption from such care and\r\nsorrow!"\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla\'s kind heart was deeply moved. He felt painfully\r\nconscious of his own inability to comfort in such sorrow; but spoke\r\nof God\'s power to change the heart of the most hardened sinner, his\r\nwillingness to save, and his promises to those who seek his aid in the\r\ntime of trouble.\r\n\r\n"Thank you. I knew you would feel for us; your sympathy does me good,"\r\nreturned Mr. Beresford, grasping his friend\'s hand and pressing it\r\nbetween his own; "your words too; for however well we know these\r\ntruths we are apt to forget them, even when they are most needed.\r\n\r\n"But it is growing late, and you must be weary after your journey. Let\r\nme show you to your room."\r\n\r\nThree days passed in which Rudolph was not once seen in his home, and\r\nhis parents were left in ignorance of his whereabouts. They exerted\r\nthemselves for the pleasure and entertainment of their guest, but\r\nhe could see plainly that they were enduring torture of anxiety and\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening of the third day, Mr. Beresford said to him, "My\r\ncarriage is at the door. I must go into town and search for my boy. I\r\nhave done so vainly several times since he last left his home, but I\r\nmust try again to-night. Will you go with me?"\r\n\r\nTravilla consented with alacrity, and they set out at once.\r\n\r\nWhile on their way to the city Mr. Beresford explained that, for some\r\ntime past, he had had reason to fear that his son was frequenting one\r\nof its gambling-hells; that thus far he had failed in his efforts to\r\ngain admittance, in order to search for him; but to-day, a professed\r\ngambler, well known in the house; had come to him and offered his\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n"As his convoy, I think we shall get in," added Mr. Beresford. "I\r\ncannot fathom the man\'s motives, but suspect he owes a grudge to a\r\nnewcomer, who, he says, is winning large sums from Rudolph. I shall\r\ndrive to Smith\'s livery stable, leave my horse and carriage there,\r\nthen walk on to the place, which is only a few squares distant. Our\r\nguide is to meet us at the first corner from Smith\'s."\r\n\r\nThis programme was carried out, their guide was in waiting at the\r\nappointed place, and at once conducted them to the gambling-house Mr.\r\nBeresford had spoken of. They were admitted without question or demur,\r\nand in another moment found themselves standing beside a table where a\r\nnumber of men were at play, nearly all so absorbed in their game as to\r\nseem entirely unconscious of the presence of spectators.\r\n\r\nTwo of them, pitted against each other, and both young, though there\r\nmust have been several years\' difference in their ages, particularly\r\nattracted Travilla\'s attention; and glancing at his friend, he saw\r\nthat it was the same with him,--that his eyes were fixed upon the face\r\nof the younger of the two, with an expression of keen distress, while\r\nhe trembled with emotion, and almost gasped for breath, as he leaned\r\ntoward him, and whispered, "It is he--my son."\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the young man\'s face grew deadly pale, he started\r\nup with a wild, ringing cry, "I am ruined!" drew a pistol from his\r\nbreast, and placed the muzzle to his mouth.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Travilla, springing forward, struck it from his hand ere he\r\ncould pull the trigger.\r\n\r\nA scene of much excitement and confusion followed, in the midst of\r\nwhich young Beresford was led away by his father and Travilla.\r\n\r\nA week later the latter gentleman reached Lansdale, arriving there in\r\nthe early morning train. He put up at its principal hotel, and having\r\nrefreshed himself by a few hours\' sleep, a bath, and breakfast,\r\ninquired the way to Miss Stanhope\'s.\r\n\r\nElsie was just coming down the front stairway, as he appeared before\r\nthe open door, and was about to ring for admittance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Travilla, my dear old friend! who would have expected to see\r\nyou here?" she cried, in delighted surprise, as she bounded forward to\r\nmeet him, with both hands extended in joyous greeting.\r\n\r\nHe took them in his, and kissed her first on one cheek, then on the\r\nother. "Still fresh and blooming as a rose, and with the same happy\r\nlight in the sweet brown eyes," he said, gazing fondly into their\r\ntender depths.\r\n\r\n"And you are the same old flatterer," she answered gayly, a rich color\r\nmantling her cheek. "Come in and sit down. But oh, tell me when did\r\nyou see papa last? and mamma, and little Horace? Ah! the sight of you\r\nmakes me homesick for them."\r\n\r\n"I left them at Cape May, about a fortnight since, all well and happy,\r\nbut missing you very much. I think papa will hardly be able to do\r\nwithout his darling much longer."\r\n\r\n"Nor his darling without him. Oh, dear! sometimes I get to wanting him\r\nso badly that I feel as if I should have to write to him to come for\r\nme at once. But excuse me while I go and call Aunt Wealthy."\r\n\r\n"Not yet; let us have a little chat together first."\r\n\r\nOf course, after so long a separation, such old and tried friends\r\nwould find a great deal to say to each other. The time slipped away\r\nvery fast, and half an hour afterward Mr. Egerton, coming in without\r\nringing--a liberty he sometimes took of late--found them seated close\r\ntogether on the sofa, talking earnestly, Elsie with her hand in that\r\nof her friend, and a face even brighter and happier than its wont.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla had one of those faces that often seem to come to a\r\nstand-still as regards age, and to scarcely know any change for many\r\nyears. He was at this time thirty-four, but would have passed readily\r\nfor twenty-five. Egerton thought him no more than that, and at once\r\ntook him for a successful rival.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Miss Dinsmore," he said, bowing stiffly, "I should have\r\nwaited to ring, but--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind, Mr. Egerton," she said; "let me introduce you to my\r\nold friend, Mr. Travilla--"\r\n\r\nBut she stopped in astonishment and dismay. Mr. Travilla had risen,\r\nand the two stood confronting each other like mortal foes.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was the first to speak. "I have met you before, sir!" he\r\nsaid with stern indignation.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! that must be a mistake, sir, for upon my word and honor I\r\nnever set eyes on you before."\r\n\r\n"Your honor! the honor of a sharper, a black-leg, a ----"\r\n\r\n"Sir, do you mean to insult me? by what right do you apply such\r\nepithets to me? Pray where did you ever meet me?"\r\n\r\n"In a gambling-hell in Cincinnati; the time, one week ago to-night;\r\nthe occasion, the playing of a game of cards between young Beresford\r\nand yourself in which you were the winner--by what knavery you best\r\nknow--the stakes so heavy that, on perceiving that he had lost,\r\nthe young man cried out that he was ruined, and in his mad despair\r\nattempted self-destruction. It is quite possible that you may not have\r\nobserved me in the crowd that gathered about your wretched victim; but\r\nI can never forget the face of the man who had wrought his ruin."\r\n\r\nEgerton\'s countenance expressed the utmost astonishment and\r\nincredulity. "I have not been in Cincinnati for two months," he\r\naverred, "and all I know of that affair I have learned from the\r\ndaily papers. But I shall not stay here to be insulted by you,\r\nsir. Good-afternoon, Miss Dinsmore. I hope to be allowed an early\r\nopportunity to explain this, and to be able to do so to your entire\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\nHe bowed and withdrew, hastening from the house with the rapid step of\r\none who is filled with a just indignation.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla turned to Elsie. She was sitting there on the sofa, with\r\nher hands clasped in her lap, and a look of terror and anguish on her\r\nface, from which every trace of color had fled.\r\n\r\nHis own grew almost as pale, and his voice shook, as again sitting\r\ndown beside her, and laying his hand on hers, he said, "My poor child!\r\ncan it be possible that you care for that wretch?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t!" she whispered hoarsely and turning away her face; "I\r\ncannot believe it; there must be some dreadful mistake."\r\n\r\nThen, recovering her composure by a mighty effort, she rose and\r\nintroduced her aunt, who entered the room at that moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla sat for some time conversing with her, Elsie joining in\r\noccasionally, but with a tone and manner from which all the brightness\r\nand vivacity had fled; then he went away, declining a pressing\r\ninvitation to stay to dinner, but promising to be there to tea.\r\n\r\nThe moment he was gone Miss Stanhope was busied in beating up her\r\ncushions, and Elsie flew to her room, where she walked back and forth\r\nin a state of great agitation. But the dinner-bell rang, and composing\r\nherself as well as she could, she went down. Her cheeks were burning,\r\nand she seemed unnaturally gay, but ate very little as her aunt\r\nnoticed with concern.\r\n\r\nThe meal was scarcely over, when a ring at the door-bell was followed\r\nby the sound of Mr. Egerton\'s voice asking for Miss Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Miss Stanhope with an arch smile, "he does not ask this\r\nhour for me; knowing it\'s the time of my siesta."\r\n\r\nElsie found Egerton pacing the parlor floor to and fro. He took her\r\nhand, led her to the sofa, and sitting down by her side, began at once\r\nto defend himself against Mr. Travilla\'s charge. He told her he had\r\nnever been guilty of gambling; he had "sowed some wild oats," years\r\nago--getting slightly intoxicated on two or three occasions, and\r\nthings of that sort--but it was all over and repented of; and surely\r\nshe could not think it just and right that it should be brought up\r\nagainst him now.\r\n\r\nAs to Mr. Travilla\'s story--the only way he could account for the\r\nsingular mistake was in the fact that he had a cousin who bore the\r\nsame name as himself, and resembled him so closely that they had\r\nbeen frequently mistaken for each other. And that cousin, most\r\nunfortunately, especially on account of the likeness, did both drink\r\nand gamble. He was delighted by the look of relief that came over\r\nElsie\'s face, as he told her this. She cared for him, then; yet her\r\nconfidence had been shaken.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you doubted me, then?" he said in a tone of sorrowful reproach.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I could not bear to think it possible. I was sure there must be a\r\nmistake somewhere," she said with a beautiful smile.\r\n\r\n"But you are quite satisfied now?"\r\n\r\n"Quite."\r\n\r\nThen he told her he loved her very dearly, better than his own soul;\r\nthat he found he could not live without her; life would not be worth\r\nhaving, unless she would consent to share it with him. "Would she, oh!\r\nwould she promise some day to be his own precious little wife?"\r\n\r\nElsie listened with downcast, blushing face, and soft eyes beaming\r\nwith joy; for the events of that day had revealed to her the fact that\r\nthis man had made himself master of her heart.\r\n\r\n"Will you not give to me a word of hope?" pleaded Egerton.\r\n\r\n"I--I cannot, must not, without my father\'s permission," she faltered,\r\n"and oh! he forbade me to listen to anything of the kind. I am too\r\nyoung he says."\r\n\r\n"When was that?"\r\n\r\n"Three years ago."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but you are older now; and you will let me write and ask his\r\nconsent? I may say that you are not quite indifferent to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she murmured, turning her sweet, blushing face away from his\r\nardent gaze.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dearest, a thousand thanks!" he cried, pressing her hand\r\nin his. "And now may I ask who and what that Mr. Travilla is?"\r\n\r\nShe explained, winding up by saying that he was much like a second\r\nfather to her.\r\n\r\n"Father!" he exclaimed, "he doesn\'t look a day over twenty-five."\r\n\r\n"He is about two years younger than papa and doesn\'t look any younger,\r\nI think," she answered with a smile. "But strangers are very apt to\r\ntake papa for my brother."\r\n\r\nEgerton left an hour before Mr. Travilla came, and that hour Elsie\r\nspent in her own room in a state of great excitement,--now full of the\r\nsweet joy of loving and being loved, now trembling with apprehension\r\nat the thought of the probable effect of Mr. Travilla\'s story upon her\r\nfather. She was fully convinced of Egerton\'s truth and innocence; yet\r\nquite aware that his explanation might not prove so satisfactory to\r\nMr. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, papa!" she murmured, as she paced restlessly to and fro,\r\n"how can I obey if you bid me give him up? And yet I must. I know it\r\nwill be my duty, and that I must."\r\n\r\n"What a color you hab in your cheeks, darlin\'! an\' how your eyes\r\ndo shine. I\'se \'fraid you\'s gettin\' a fever," said Chloe, with an\r\nanxious, troubled gaze into her young lady\'s face, as she came in to\r\ndress her for the evening.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mammy, I am perfectly well," Elsie answered with a slight\r\nlaugh. Then seating herself before the glass, "Now do your best," she\r\nsaid gayly, "for we are to have company to tea. I doubt if you can\r\nguess whom?"\r\n\r\n"Den \'spose my pet saves her ole mammy de trouble. \'Taint massa, for\r\nsure?"\r\n\r\n"No, not quite so welcome a guest; but one you\'ll be delighted to see.\r\nMr. Travilla."\r\n\r\n"Ki, darlin\'! he not here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he came this morning. Ah! I knew you\'d be delighted."\r\n\r\nElsie knew that it would require the very strongest proof to convince\r\nher father of the truth of Mr. Egerton\'s story, but hoped to find Mr.\r\nTravilla much more ready to give it credence. She was proportionably\r\ndisappointed when, on hearing it from her, he scouted it as utterly\r\nunworthy of belief, or even examination.\r\n\r\n"No, my child," he said, "the man\'s face is indelibly impressed upon\r\nmy memory, and I can not be mistaken in his identity."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s face flushed crimson, and indignant tears sprang to her eyes\r\nand trembled in her voice as she answered, "I never knew you so\r\nuncharitable before, sir. I could not have believed it of my\r\nkind-hearted, generous old friend."\r\n\r\nHe gave her a very troubled, anxious look, as he replied, "Why should\r\nyou take it so to heart, Elsie? Surely this man is nothing to you."\r\n\r\n"He is to be some day, if papa will permit," she murmured, turning\r\naway her blushing face from his gaze.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla uttered a groan, made two or three rapid turns across the\r\nroom, and coming back to her side, laid his hand in an affectionate,\r\nfatherly manner upon her shoulder.\r\n\r\n"My dear," he said with emotion, "I don\'t know when I have heard\r\nanything that distressed me so much; or that could give such pain and\r\ndistress to your doting father."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Travilla, you will not, you cannot be so unkind, so cruel, as to\r\ntry to persuade papa to think as you do of--of Mr. Egerton?"\r\n\r\nHer tone was half indignant, half imploring, and her eyes were lifted\r\npleadingly to his face.\r\n\r\n"My poor child," he said, "I could not be so cruel to you as to leave\r\nhim in ignorance of any of the facts; but I shall not attempt to\r\nbias his judgment; nor would it avail if I did. Your father is an\r\nindependent thinker, and will make up his mind for himself."\r\n\r\n"And against poor Bromly," thought Elsie, with an emotion of anguish,\r\nand something akin to rebellion rising in her heart.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla read it all in her speaking countenance. "Do not fear\r\nyour father\'s decision, my little friend." he said, sitting down\r\nbeside her again, "he is very just, and you are as the apple of his\r\neye. He will sift the matter thoroughly, and decide as he shall deem\r\nbest for your happiness. Can you not trust his wisdom and his love?"\r\n\r\n"I know he loves me very dearly, Mr. Travilla, but--he is only human,\r\nand may make a mistake."\r\n\r\n"Then try to leave it all in the hands of your heavenly Father, who\r\ncannot err, who is infinite in wisdom, power, and in His love for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I will try," she said with a quivering lip. "Now please talk to me\r\nof something else. Tell me of that young man. Did you say he shot\r\nhimself?"\r\n\r\n"Young Beresford, my friend\'s son? No, he was prevented." And he went\r\non to tell of Rudolph\'s horror and remorse on account of that rash\r\nact, and of the excesses that led to it; also of the trembling hope\r\nhis parents and friends were beginning to indulge that he was now\r\ntruly penitent, and, clothed in his right mind, was sitting at the\r\nSaviour\'s feet.\r\n\r\nElsie listened with interest. They had had the parlor to themselves\r\nfor an hour or more, Miss Stanhope having received an unexpected\r\nsummons to the bedside of a sick neighbor.\r\n\r\nShe was with them at tea, and during most of the evening, but left\r\nthem alone together for a moment just before Mr. Travilla took his\r\nleave, and he seized the opportunity to say to Elsie that he thought\r\nshe ought to refrain from further intercourse with Egerton till she\r\nshould learn her father\'s will in regard to the matter.\r\n\r\n"I cannot promise--I will think of it," she said with a look of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n"You write frequently to your papa?"\r\n\r\n"Every day."\r\n\r\n"I know you would not wish to deceive him in the least. Will you tell\r\nhim what I conceive to be the facts in regard to Mr. Egerton? or shall\r\nI?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot, oh, I cannot!" she murmured, turning away her face.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall spare you the painful task, by, doing it myself, my poor\r\nchild. I shall write to-night."\r\n\r\nShe was silent, but he could see the tumultuous heaving of her breast,\r\nand the tears glistening on the heavy drooping lashes that swept her\r\npale cheek. His heart bled for her, while his indignation waxed hot\r\nagainst the hypocritical scoundrel who, he feared, had succeeded only\r\ntoo well in wrecking her happiness.\r\n\r\nShe had described to him Egerton\'s character as he had made it appear\r\nto her, telling of their conversations on religious subjects, his\r\nsupposed conversion, etc., etc.; thus unintentionally enabling\r\nTravilla to see clearly through the man\'s base designs. He silently\r\nresolved to stay in Lansdale and watch over her until her father\'s\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n"You ride out daily?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"May I be your escort to-morrow?"\r\n\r\nShe cast down her eyes, which she had lifted to his face for an\r\ninstant, blushing painfully. It seemed an effort for her to reply, and\r\nthe words came slowly, and with hesitation. "I--should be glad to have\r\nyou, sir; you know I have always valued your society, but--Mr. Egerton\r\nalways goes with us--Lottie King and me--of late; and--and I can\r\nhardly suppose either of you would now find the company of the other\r\nagreeable."\r\n\r\n"No, Elsie; but what do you think your father would wish?"\r\n\r\n"I know he would be glad to have me under your care, and if you don\'t\r\nmind the unpleasantness."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I would cheerfully endure far more than that, to watch over\r\nyour father\'s child. You will not let this unhappy circumstance turn\r\nyou against your old friend? I could hardly bear that, little Elsie."\r\nAnd he drew her toward him caressingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no! I don\'t think anything could do that; you\'ve always been\r\nso good to me--almost a second father."\r\n\r\nHe released her hand with a slight involuntary sigh, as at that\r\ninstant Miss Stanhope re-entered the room. The two were standing by\r\nthe piano, Mr. Travilla having risen from one of the cushioned chairs\r\nto draw near to Elsie while talking to her. Miss Stanhope flew to the\r\nchair, caught up the cushion, shook it, laid it down again, and with\r\ntwo or three little loving pats restored it to its normal condition of\r\nperfect roundness. Mr. Travilla watched her with a surprised, puzzled\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n"Have I done any mischief, Elsie?" he asked in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" she answered with a faint smile, "it\'s only auntie\'s way."\r\n\r\nTheir visitor had gone, and Elsie turned to her aunt to say\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\n"Something is wrong with you, child; can\'t you tell the trouble to\r\nyour old auntie, and let her try to comfort you?" Miss Stanhope asked,\r\nputting an arm about the slender waist, and scanning the sweet face,\r\nusually so bright and rosy, now so pale and agitated, with a look of\r\nkeen but loving scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThen, in broken words, and with many a little half-sobbing sigh and\r\none or two scalding tears, hastily brushed away, Elsie told the whole\r\npainful story, secure of warm sympathy from the kind heart to which\r\nshe was so tenderly folded.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope believed in Bromly Egerton almost as firmly as Elsie\r\nherself; what comfort there was in that! She believed too in the\r\ninspired assurances that "all things work together for good to them\r\nthat love God," and that He is the hearer and answerer of prayer. She\r\nreminded her niece of them; bade her cast her burden on the Lord and\r\nleave it there, and cheered her with the hope that Bromly would be\r\nable to prove to her father that Mr. Travilla was entirely mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  My heart has been like summer skies,\r\n  When they are fair to view;\r\n  But there never yet were hearts or skies\r\n  Clouds might not wander through.\r\n\r\n  --MRS. L.P. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter Dinsmore was doing well at college, studying hard, and keeping\r\nhimself out of bad company. In this last he might not have been so\r\nsuccessful but for his brother\'s assistance; for, though choosing his\r\nown associates from among the dissolute and vile, Arthur resolutely\r\nexerted himself to preserve this young brother from such\r\ncontamination. "I\'ve enough sins of my own to answer for, Wal," he\r\nwould say, sometimes almost fiercely, "and I won\'t have any of\r\nyours added to \'em; nobody shall say I led you into bad company, or\r\ninitiated you into my own evil courses."\r\n\r\nFor months Arthur\'s spirits had been very variable, his frequent fits\r\nof gloom, alternating with unnatural gayety, exciting Walter\'s wonder\r\nand sympathy.\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine what ails him," he said to himself again and again;\r\nfor Arthur utterly refused to tell him the secret of his despondency.\r\n\r\nIt had been almost constant since the receipt of Egerton\'s last\r\nepistle, and Walter was debating in his own mind whether he ought not\r\nto speak of it in his next letter to their mother, when one night he\r\nwas wakened by a sudden blow from Arthur\'s hand, and started up to\r\nfind him rolling and tossing, throwing his arms about, and muttering\r\nincoherently in the delirium of fever.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of a very serious illness. It was pronounced\r\nsuch by the physician called in by Walter at an early hour the next\r\nmorning, and the boy sat down with a heavy heart to write the sad\r\ntidings to his parents.\r\n\r\nWhile doing so he was startled by hearing Arthur pronounce Elsie\'s\r\nname in connection with words that seemed to imply that some danger\r\nthreatened her. He rose and went to the bedside, asking, "What\'s wrong\r\nwith Elsie, Art?"\r\n\r\n"I say, Tom Jackson, she\'ll never take you. Horace won\'t consent."\r\n\r\n"I should think not, indeed!" muttered Walter. Then leaning over his\r\nbrother, "Art, I say, Art! what is it all about? Has Tom Jackson gone\r\nto Lansdale?"\r\n\r\nNo answer, save an inarticulate murmur that might be either assent or\r\ndissent.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had promised to send a nurse and, as Walter now glanced\r\nabout the room, the thought occurred to him that it would seem very\r\ndisorderly to the woman. Arthur\'s clothes lay in a heap over the back\r\nof a chair, just as he had thrown them down on retiring.\r\n\r\n"I can at least hang these in the closet," thought Walter, picking up\r\nthe jacket.\r\n\r\nA letter fell from the pocket upon the floor.\r\n\r\n"Jackson\'s handwriting, I declare!" he exclaimed, with a start of\r\nsurprise, as he stooped to pick it up. It was without an envelope,\r\nwritten in a bold, legible hand, and unintentionally he read the date,\r\n"Lansdale, Ohio, Aug. -- 185-," and farther down the page some parts\r\nof sentences connected with the "D---- family" ... "can\'t help\r\nthemselves" ... "the girl loves me and believes in me."\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the bed. Arthur\'s eyes were closed. He looked down at\r\nthe letter again; there was the signature "T. J., alias B. E."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a conspiracy; there\'s mischief brewing, and I believe I ought to\r\nread it," he muttered; then, turning his back toward the bed, perused\r\nevery word of it with close attention.\r\n\r\nIt was sufficient to give him a clear insight into the whole affair.\r\nElsie\'s letters had of late spoken quite frequently of Mr. Bromly\r\nEgerton, and so he was the "T. J., alias B. E." of this epistle, the\r\nTom Jackson who had been the ruin of Arthur.\r\n\r\n"The wretch! the sneaking, hypocritical scoundrel!" muttered Walter\r\nbetween his teeth, and glancing again at the bed, though the epithet\r\nwas meant to apply to Jackson and not to Arthur. "What can I do to\r\ncircumvent him? Write to Horace, of course, and warn him of Elsie\'s\r\ndanger." And though usually vacillating and infirm of purpose, on this\r\noccasion Walter showed himself both prompt and decided. The next mail\r\ncarried the news of his discovery to Elsie\'s natural protector,--her\r\nfather, who with Rose, the Allison family, and little Horace, was\r\nstill at Cape May.\r\n\r\nThis letter and the three from Lansdale were handed Mr. Dinsmore\r\ntogether. He opened Elsie\'s first. The contents puzzled, surprised,\r\nand alarmed him. They were merely a few hastily written lines of\r\ntouching entreaty that he would not be angry, but would please forgive\r\nher for giving her heart to one of whom he knew nothing, and daring to\r\nlet him speak to her of love; and that he would not believe anything\r\nagainst him until he had heard his defence.\r\n\r\nWith a murmured "My poor darling! you have been too long away from\r\nyour father," Mr. Dinsmore laid it down and opened the one directed in\r\na strange hand; rightly supposing it to come from the person to whom\r\nshe alluded.\r\n\r\nEgerton spoke in glowing terms of his admiration for Elsie\'s character\r\nand personal charms, and the ardent love with which they had inspired\r\nhim, and modestly of his own merits. Ignoring all knowledge of her\r\nfortune, he said that he had none, but was engaged in a flourishing\r\nbusiness which would enable him to support her in comfort and to\r\nsurround her with most of the elegancies and luxuries of life to which\r\nshe had been accustomed. Lastly he alluded in a very pious strain to\r\nthe deep debt of gratitude he owed her as the one who had been the\r\nmeans of his hopeful conversion; said she had acknowledged that she\r\nreturned his affection, and earnestly begged for the gift of her hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore gave this missive an attentive perusal, laid it aside,\r\nand opened Mr. Travilla\'s.\r\n\r\nRose was in the room, putting little Horace to bed. She had heard his\r\nlittle prayer, given him his good-night kiss, and now the child ran to\r\nhis father to claim the same from him.\r\n\r\nIt was given mechanically, and Mr. Dinsmore returned to his letter.\r\nThe child lingered a moment, gazing earnestly into his father\'s face,\r\ntroubled by its paleness and the frown on his brow.\r\n\r\n"Papa," he said softly, leaning with confiding affection upon his\r\nknee, "dear papa, are you angry with me? have I been a naughty boy,\r\nto-day?"\r\n\r\n"No, son; but I am reading; don\'t disturb me now."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore\'s hand rested caressingly on the curly head for an\r\ninstant and the boy turned away satisfied. But Rose was not. Coming to\r\nher husband\'s side the next moment, and laying her hand affectionately\r\non his shoulder, "What is it, dear?" she asked, "has anything gone\r\nwrong with our darling, or at home?"\r\n\r\n"Trouble for her, I fear, Rose. Read these," he answered with emotion,\r\nputting Elsie\'s, Egerton\'s, and Travilla\'s letters into her hands,\r\nthen opening Walter\'s.\r\n\r\n"Travilla is right! the man is an unmitigated scoundrel!" he cried,\r\nstarting up with great excitement. "Rose, I must be off by the next\r\ntrain; it leaves in half an hour. I shall go alone and take only a\r\nportmanteau with me. Can it be got ready in season?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, I will pack it at once myself. But what is wrong? Where\r\nare you going? and how long will you be away?"\r\n\r\n"To my brother\'s first--Arthur is seriously ill, and I must get hold\r\nof evidence that Walter can supply--then on to Lansdale with all speed\r\nto rescue Elsie from the wiles of a gambling, swindling, hypocritical,\r\nfortune-hunting rascal!"\r\n\r\nAt a very early hour of the next morning, Walter Dinsmore was roused\r\nfrom his slumbers by, a knock at his door.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" he asked, starting up in bed.\r\n\r\n"I, Walter," answered a well-known voice, and with a joyful\r\nexclamation he sprang to the door, and opened it.\r\n\r\n"Horace! how glad I am to see you! I hardly dared hope you could get\r\nhere so soon."\r\n\r\n"Your news was of the sort to hasten a man\'s movements," returned Mr.\r\nDinsmore, holding the lad\'s hand in a warm brotherly grasp. "How are\r\nyou? and how\'s Arthur now?"\r\n\r\n"About the same. Hark! you may hear him moaning and muttering. This is\r\nour study. I have had that cot-bed brought in here, and given up the\r\nbedroom to him and the nurse; though I\'m with him a good deal too."\r\n\r\n"You have a good nurse, and the best medical advice?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You must see that he has every comfort, Walter; let no expense be\r\nspared, nothing left undone that may alleviate his sufferings or\r\nassist his recovery. What is the physician\'s opinion of the case?"\r\n\r\n"He is not very communicative to me; may be more so to you. You\'ll\r\nstay and see him when he calls, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"What time? I must be off again by the first train. I want to reach\r\nLansdale to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"It will give you time to do that. He calls early."\r\n\r\n"Now take me to Arthur; and then I must see that letter, and hear all\r\nyou have to tell me in regard to that matter."\r\n\r\n"What does Elsie say?" asked Walter, with intense interest; "do you\r\nthink she cares for him?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid she does," and Mr. Dinsmore shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! but you won\'t allow--"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; \'twould be to entail upon her a life of misery."\r\n\r\n"It\'s her fortune he\'s after, that\'s evident, and indeed I would hurry\r\nto Lansdale, if I were you, lest they might take it into their heads\r\nto elope. Such a shame as it would be for him to get her--the dear,\r\nsweet darling!"\r\n\r\n"I have no fear that Elsie could ever be so lost to her sense of\r\nfilial duty; nor, I am sure, have you, Walter," answered Mr. Dinsmore\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n"No, Horace; and it\'s the greatest relief and comfort to me just now\r\nto know how truly obedient and affectionate she is to you."\r\n\r\nHorace Dinsmore omitted nothing that he could do to add to the comfort\r\nof his brothers, saw the physician and learned from him that he had\r\ngood hopes of a naturally vigorous constitution bringing Arthur safely\r\nthrough the attack from which he was suffering, examined the evidence\r\nWalter was able to furnish that Bromly Egerton and Tom Jackson were\r\none and the same--a man in whom every vice abounded--found time to\r\nshow an interest in Walter\'s studies and pastimes, and was ready to\r\nleave by the train of which he had spoken.\r\n\r\nJackson had not been wary enough to disguise his hand in either the\r\nletter that had fallen from Arthur\'s pocket, or the one written to Mr.\r\nDinsmore, and a careful comparison of the two had proved conclusively\r\nthat they were the work of the same person. The broken sentences\r\nthat occasionally fell from Arthur\'s lips in his delirious ravings\r\nfurnished another proof not less strong. Also Walter had managed to\r\nsecure an excellent photograph of Jackson, which Mr. Dinsmore carried\r\nwith him, safely bestowed in the breast-pocket of his coat. He had\r\nstudied it attentively and felt sure he should be able instantly to\r\nrecognize the original.\r\n\r\nBromly Egerton lay awake most of the night following his passage at\r\narms with Mr. Travilla, considering the situation, and how he would be\r\nmost likely to secure the coveted prize. He remembered perfectly well\r\nall that Arthur Dinsmore had said about the difficulty of deceiving or\r\noutwitting his brother, and the impossibility of persuading Elsie to\r\ndisobedience. Of the latter, he had had convincing proof that day, in\r\nher firm refusal to engage herself to him without first obtaining her\r\nfather\'s consent. The conclusion he came to was, that should he remain\r\ninactive until Mr. Dinsmore\'s arrival, his chances of success were\r\nexceedingly small; in fact that his only hope lay in running away with\r\nElsie, and afterwards persuading her into a clandestine marriage.\r\n\r\nTheir ride was to be taken shortly after an early breakfast, there\r\nbeing a sort of tacit understanding that he was to accompany the young\r\nladies; but before Elsie had left her room, Chloe came up with a\r\nmessage. "Marse Egerton in de parlor, darlin\', axin could he see my\r\nyoung missis for five minutes, just now."\r\n\r\nElsie went down at once. Her visitor stood with his back toward\r\nthe door, apparently intently studying the pattern of her\r\ngreat-great-grandmother\'s sampler, but turning instantly at the\r\nsound of the light, quick footstep, came eagerly toward her with\r\noutstretched hand.\r\n\r\n"Excuse this early call, dearest, but--ah, how lovely you are looking\r\nthis morning!" and bending his head he drew her toward him.\r\n\r\nBut she stepped back, avoiding the intended caress, while a crimson\r\ntide rushed over the fair face and neck, and her eyes sought the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n"We are not engaged, Mr. Egerton; cannot be till papa has given\r\nconsent."\r\n\r\n"I beg ten thousand pardons," he said, coloring violently in his turn,\r\nand feeling his hopes grow fainter.\r\n\r\n"Will you not take a seat?" she asked, gently withdrawing her hand\r\nfrom his.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no; I have but a moment to stay. My errand was to ask if\r\nwe could not so arrange it as, for once at least, to have our ride\r\nalone together? Miss Lottie is a very nice girl, but I would give much\r\nto have my darling all to myself to-day."\r\n\r\n"I would like it much too, very much, but papa bade me always have a\r\nlady friend with me; and--and besides," she added with hesitation, and\r\nblushing more deeply than before, "papa\'s friend. Mr. Travilla, is to\r\ngo with us. I--I have promised that he shall be my escort to-day."\r\n\r\nEgerton was furious, and had much ado to conceal the fact; indeed,\r\ncame very near uttering a horrible oath, and thus forever ruining his\r\nhopes. He bit his lips and kept silent, but Elsie saw that he was\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n"Do not be offended or hurt," she said; "do not suppose that I\r\nfollowed my own inclination in consenting to such an arrangement. No,\r\nI only acted from a sense of duty; knowing that it was what papa would\r\nwish."\r\n\r\n"And you would put his wishes before mine? Love him best, I presume?"\r\n\r\n"He is my father, and entitled to my obedience, whether present or\r\nabsent."\r\n\r\n"But what very strict ideas you must have on that subject! do you\r\nreally think it your duty to obey his wishes as well as his command?"\r\n\r\n"I do; that is the kind of obedience he has taught me, that the Bible\r\nteaches, and that my love for him would dictate. I love my father very\r\ndearly, Mr. Egerton."\r\n\r\n"I should think so, indeed; but you must pardon me if at present I am\r\nfar more concerned about your love for me," he said, with a forced\r\nlaugh. "As for this Travilla, I can hardly be expected to feel any\r\ngreat cordiality toward him after his attack upon me yesterday; and\r\nI am free to confess that it would not cause me great grief to learn\r\nthat some sudden illness or accident had occurred to prevent his\r\nspoiling our ride to-day."\r\n\r\n"Your feelings are perfectly natural; but, believe me, Mr. Travilla\r\nhas the kindest of hearts, and when he learns his mistake will be most\r\nanxious to do all in his power to make amends for it. Will you stay\r\nand take breakfast with us?" For at that instant the bell rang.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," he said, moving toward the door. "But promise me,\r\nElsie, that I shall be your escort after this until your father comes.\r\nSurely love may claim so small a concession from duty."\r\n\r\nShe could not resist his persuasive look and tone, but with a smile\r\nand a blush gave the promise for which he pleaded.\r\n\r\nProcuring as fine a horse as his landlord could furnish, Mr. Travilla\r\nrode to Miss Stanhope\'s, and alighting at the gate, walked up to the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe found its mistress on the front porch, picking dead leaves from her\r\nvines. She had mounted a step ladder to reach some that otherwise\r\nwere too high up for her small stature. Turning at the sound of\r\nhis approach, "Good-morning, sir," she said. "You see I\'m like the\r\nsycamore tree that climbed into Zaccheus. Shortness is inconvenient at\r\ntimes. My, what a jar!" as she came down rather hard, missing the last\r\nstep--"I feel it from the crown of my foot to the sole of my head.\r\nHere, Simon, take away this ladder-step; the next time I want it I\r\nthink I\'ll do without; I\'m growing so old in my clumsy age. Walk in\r\nand take a seat, Mr. Torville. Or shall we sit here? It\'s pleasanter\r\nthan indoors I think."\r\n\r\n"I agree with you," he said, accepting her invitation with a smile at\r\nthe oddity of her address. "You have a fine view here."\r\n\r\nThey sat there conversing for some time before Elsie made her\r\nappearance, Mr. Travilla both charmed and amused with his companion,\r\nand she liking him better every moment. When Elsie did come down at\r\nlast, looking wondrous sweet and fair in a pretty, coquettish riding\r\nhat and habit, her aunt informed her that she had been urging "Mr.\r\nVanilla" to come and make his home with them while in town, and that\r\nhe had consented to let her send Simon at once for his trunk.\r\n\r\n"If it will be agreeable to my little friend to have me here?" Mr.\r\nTravilla said, taking her hand in his with the affectionate, fatherly\r\nmanner she had always liked so much in him.\r\n\r\nHer face flushed slightly, but she answered without an instant\'s\r\nhesitation that she hoped he would come.\r\n\r\nThe horses were already at the gate, Egerton was seen crossing the\r\nstreet, and Lottie came tripping in at a side entrance. She had heard\r\na good deal of Mr. Travilla from Elsie, and seemed pleased to make his\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\nEgerton came in, he and Mr. Travilla exchanged the coldest and most\r\ndistant of salutations, and the party set off; Mr. Travilla riding by\r\nElsie\'s side, Egerton and Lottie following a little in their rear.\r\n\r\nFinding it almost a necessity to devote himself to Miss King for\r\nthe time being, Egerton! took a sudden resolution to make a partial\r\nconfidante of her, hoping thus to secure a powerful ally. He told her\r\nof the state of affairs between Elsie and himself, of Mr. Travilla\'s\r\n"attack upon him;" how "utterly mistaken" it was, and how he presumed\r\n"the mistake" had occurred; giving the story he had told Elsie of the\r\ncousin who bore so strong a likeness to him, and so bad a character.\r\nHe professed the most ardent, devoted affection for Elsie, and the\r\nmost torturing fears lest her father, crediting him with his cousin\'s\r\nvices, should forbid the match and crush all his hopes.\r\n\r\nThe warm-hearted, innocent girl believed every word, and rushing into\r\nher friend\'s room on their return, threw her arms about her, and\r\nhugging her close, told her she knew all, was so, so sorry for her,\r\nand for poor Egerton; and begged her not to allow anything to make her\r\ngive him up and break his heart.\r\n\r\nElsie returned the embrace, shed a few tears, but answered not a word.\r\n\r\n"You do believe in him? and won\'t give him up; will you?" persisted\r\nLottie.\r\n\r\n"I do believe in him, and will not give him up unless--unless papa\r\ncommands it," Elsie answered in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t for that!" cried Lottie.\r\n\r\n"\'Children, obey your parents,\'" repeated her friend, tears filling\r\nthe soft brown eyes, and glistening on the drooping lashes. "It is\r\nGod\'s command."\r\n\r\n"But you are not a child any longer."\r\n\r\n"I am papa\'s child; I always shall be. Oh, it would break my heart if\r\never he should disown me and say, \'You are no longer my child!\'"\r\n\r\n"How you do love him!"\r\n\r\n"Better than my life!"\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was already established at Miss Stanhope\'s, and very glad\r\nto be there, that he might keep the more careful and constant watch\r\nand ward over his "little friend." Thoroughly convinced of the\r\nvileness of the wretch who had won her unsuspicious heart, he could\r\nscarce brook the thought of leaving her alone with him, or of seeing\r\nhim draw close to her side, touch her hand, or look into the soft,\r\nsweet eyes so full of purity and innocence. Yet these things no one\r\nbut her father might forbid, and Mr. Travilla would not force his\r\ncompanionship upon Elsie when he saw or felt that it was distasteful\r\nto her. The lovers were frequently left to themselves in the parlor or\r\nupon the porch, though the friendly guardian, dreading he hardly knew\r\nwhat, took care always to be within call.\r\n\r\nElsie longed for, yet dreaded her father\'s coming. She knew he would\r\nnot delay one moment longer than necessary after receiving their\r\nletters, yet he reached Lansdale almost a day sooner than she expected\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSitting alone in her room, she heard his voice and step in the hall\r\nbelow. She flew down to meet him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, dear, dear papa!"\r\n\r\n"My darling, precious child!" And her arms were about his neck, his\r\nstraining her to his heart. The next moment she lifted her face, and\r\nher eyes sought his with a wistful, pleading, questioning look. He\r\ndrew her into the sitting-room, and Miss Stanhope closed the door,\r\nleaving them alone.\r\n\r\n"My darling," he said, "you must give him up; he is utterly unworthy\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa! would you break my heart?"\r\n\r\n"My precious one, I would save you from a life of misery."\r\n\r\n"Ah, papa! you would never say that if you knew how--how I love him,"\r\nshe murmured, a deep blush suffusing her face.\r\n\r\n"Hush! it horrifies me to hear you speak so of so vile a wretch,--a\r\ndrinking, swearing gambler, swindler, and rake; for I have learned\r\nthat he is all these."\r\n\r\n"Papa, it is not true! I will not hear such things said of him, even\r\nby you!" she cried, the hot blood dyeing her face and neck, and the\r\nsoft eyes filling with indignant tears.\r\n\r\nHe put his finger upon her lips. "My daughter forgets to whom she is\r\nspeaking," he said with something of the old sternness, though there\r\nwas tender pity also in his tones.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, I am so wretched!" she sobbed, hiding her face on his\r\nbreast. "Oh, don\'t believe what they say; it isn\'t, it can\'t be true."\r\n\r\nHe caressed her silently, then taking the photograph from his pocket,\r\nasked, "Do you know that face?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is his."\r\n\r\n"I knew it, and it is also the face of the man whose character I have\r\njust described."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, papa!" and with breathless eagerness she repeated the story\r\nwith which Egerton had swept away all her doubts. She read incredulity\r\nin her father\'s face, "You do not believe it, papa?"\r\n\r\n"No, my child, no more than I do black is white. See here!" and he\r\nproduced Egerton\'s letter to him, and the one to Arthur, made her\r\nread and compare them, and gave her the further proofs Walter had\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nShe grew deathly pale, but was no more ready to be convinced than he.\r\n"Oh, papa, there must be some dreadful mistake! I cannot believe he\r\ncould be guilty of such things. The cousin has been personating him,\r\nhas forged that letter, perhaps; and the photograph may be his also."\r\n\r\n"You are not using your good common-sense, Elsie; the proof is very\r\nfull and clear to my mind. The man is a fortune-hunter, seeking your\r\nwealth, not you; a scoundrel whose vices should shut him out of all\r\ndecent society. I can hardly endure the thought that he has ever known\r\nyou, or dared to address a word to you, and it must never be again."\r\n\r\n"Must I give him up?" she asked with pale, quivering lips.\r\n\r\n"You must, my daughter; at once and for ever."\r\n\r\nA look of anguish swept over her face, then she started, flushed, and\r\ntrembled, as a voice and step were heard on the porch without.\r\n\r\n"It is he?" her father said inquiringly, and her look answered, "Yes."\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet, for they had been sitting side by side on the\r\nsofa while they talked. She sprang up also, and clinging to his arm,\r\nlooked beseechingly into his face, pleading in a hoarse whisper,\r\n"Papa, you will let me see him, speak to him once more?--just a few\r\nwords--in your presence--oh, papa!"\r\n\r\n"No, my darling, no; his touch, his breath, are contamination; his\r\nvery look is pollution, and shall never rest upon you again if I can\r\nprevent it. Remember you are never to hold any communication with him\r\nagain--by word, letter, or in any other way; I positively forbid it;\r\nyou must never look at him, or intentionally allow him a sight of your\r\nface. I must go now, and send him away." He held her to his heart as\r\nhe spoke; his tone was affectionate, but very firm, and decided; he\r\nkissed her tenderly, two or three times, placed her in an easy-chair,\r\nsaying, "Stay here till I come to you," and left the room.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she lay back against the cushions like one stunned by a\r\nheavy blow; then, roused by the sound of the voices of the two she\r\nloved best on earth, started and leaned forward in a listening\r\nattitude, straining her ear to catch their words. Few of them reached\r\nher, but her father\'s tones were cold and haughty, Egerton\'s at first\r\npersuasive, then loud, angry, and defiant.\r\n\r\nHe was gone, she had heard the last echo of his departing footsteps,\r\nand again her father bent over her, his face full of tender pity. She\r\nlifted her sad face to his, with the very look that had taunted him\r\nfor years, that he could never recall without a pang of regret and\r\nremorse--that pleading, mournful gaze with which she had parted from\r\nhim in the time of their estrangement.\r\n\r\nIt almost unmanned him now, almost broke his heart. "Don\'t, my\r\ndarling, don\'t look at me so," he said in low, moved tones, taking her\r\ncold hands in his. "You don\'t know, precious one, how willingly your\r\nfather would bear all this pain for you if he could."\r\n\r\nShe threw herself upon his breast, and folding her close to his heart,\r\nhe caressed her with exceeding tenderness, calling her by every fond,\r\nendearing name.\r\n\r\nFor many minutes she received it all passively, then suddenly raising\r\nher head, she returned one passionate embrace, withdrew herself from\r\nhis arms, and hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nHe let her go unquestioned; he knew she went to seek comfort and\r\nsupport from One nearer and dearer, and better able to give it\r\nthan himself. He rose and walked the room with a sad and troubled\r\ncountenance, and a heart filled with grief for his child, with anger\r\nand indignation toward the wretch who had wrecked her happiness.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanhope opened the door and looked in.\r\n\r\n"You have had no dinner, Horace. It will be ready in a few moments."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, aunt. I will go up to my room first and try to get rid of\r\nsome of the dust and dirt I have brought with me."\r\n\r\n"Stay a moment, nephew. I am sorely troubled for the child. You don\'t\r\napprove of her choice?"\r\n\r\n"Very far from it. I have forbidden the man ever to come near her\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t be hard with her, poor dear?"\r\n\r\n"Hard with her, Aunt Wealthy? hard and cruel to my darling whom I\r\nlove better than my life? I trust not; but it would be the height of\r\ncruelty to allow this thing to go on. The man is a vile wretch guilty\r\nof almost every vice, and seeking my child for her wealth, not for\r\nherself. I have forbidden her to see or ever to hold the slightest\r\ncommunication with him again."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is quite right if your opinion of him is correct; and I\r\nhardly think she is likely to refuse submission."\r\n\r\n"I have brought up my daughter to habits of strict, unquestioning\r\nobedience, Aunt Wealthy," he said, "and I think they will stand her in\r\ngood stead now. I have no fear that she will rebel."\r\n\r\nA half hour with her best Friend had done much to soothe and calm our\r\nsweet Elsie; she had cast her burden on the Lord and He sustained her.\r\nShe knew that no trial could come to her without His will, that He\r\nhad permitted this for her good, that in His own good time and way He\r\nwould remove it, and she was willing to leave it all with Him; for was\r\nHe not all-wise, all-powerful, and full of tenderest, pitying love for\r\nher?\r\n\r\nShe had great faith in the wisdom and love of her earthly father also,\r\nand doubted not that he was doing what he sincerely believed to be for\r\nher happiness,--giving her present pain only in order to save her from\r\nkeener and more lasting distress and anguish in the future.\r\n\r\nIt was well for her that she had such trust in him and that their\r\nmutual love was so deep and strong; well too that she was troubled\r\nwith no doubts of the duty of implicit obedience to parental authority\r\nwhen not opposed to the higher commands of God. Her heart still clung\r\nto Egerton, refusing to credit his utter unworthiness, and she felt\r\nit a bitter trial to be thus completely separated from him, yet hoped\r\nthat at some future, and perhaps not distant day, he might be able to\r\nconvince her father of his mistake.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore felt it impossible to remain long away from his suffering\r\nchild; after leaving the table, a few moments only were spent in\r\nconversation with his aunt and Mr. Travilla, and then he sought his\r\ndarling in her room.\r\n\r\n"My poor little pet, you have been too long away from your father," he\r\nsaid, taking her in his arms again. "I shall never forgive myself for\r\nallowing it. But, daughter, why was this thing suffered to go on? Your\r\nletters never spoke of this man in a way to lead me to suppose that\r\nhe was paying you serious attention; and indeed I did not intend to\r\npermit that from any one yet."\r\n\r\n"Papa, I did not deceive you intentionally, I did not mean to be\r\ndisobedient," she said imploringly. "Lottie and I were almost always\r\ntogether, and I did not think of him as a lover till he spoke."\r\n\r\n"Well, dearest, I am not chiding you; your father could never find\r\nit in his heart to add one needless pang to what you are already\r\nsuffering." His tone was full of pitying tenderness.\r\n\r\nShe made no answer; only hid her face on his breast and wept silently.\r\n"Papa," she murmured at length. "I--I do so want to break one of your\r\nrules; oh, if you would only let me, just this once!"\r\n\r\n"A strange request, my darling," he said, "but which of them is it?"\r\n\r\n"That when you have once decided a matter I must never ask you to\r\nreconsider. Oh, papa, do, do let me entreat you just this once!"\r\n\r\n"I think it will be useless, daughter, only giving me the pain of\r\nrefusing, and you of being refused; but you may say on."\r\n\r\n"Papa, it is, that I may write a little note to--to Mr. Egerton," she\r\nsaid, speaking eagerly and rapidly, yet half trembling at her own\r\ntemerity the while, "just to tell him that I cannot do anything\r\nagainst your will, and that he must not come near me or try to hold\r\nany sort of intercourse with me till you give consent; but that I\r\nhave not lost my faith in him, and if he is innocent and unjustly\r\nsuspected, we need not be wretched and despairing; for God will surely\r\nsome day cause it to be made apparent. Oh, papa, may I not? Please,\r\nplease let me! I will bring it to you when written, and there shall\r\nnot be one word in it that you do not approve." She had lifted her\r\nface, and the soft, beseeching eyes were looking pleadingly into his.\r\n\r\n"My dearest child," he said, "it is hard to refuse you, but I cannot\r\nallow it. There, there! do not cry so bitterly; every tear I see you\r\nshed sends a pang to my heart. Listen to me, daughter. Believing what\r\nI do of that man, I would not for a great deal have him in possession\r\nof a single line of your writing. Have you ever given him one?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, never," she sobbed.\r\n\r\n"Or received one from him?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is well." Then as if a sudden thought had struck him, "Elsie, have\r\nyou ever allowed him to touch your lips?" he asked almost sternly.\r\n\r\n"No, papa, not even my cheek. I would not while we were not engaged;\r\nand that could not be without your consent."\r\n\r\n"I am truly thankful for that!" he exclaimed in a tone of relief; "to\r\nknow that he had--that these sweet lips had been polluted by contact\r\nwith his--would be worse to me than the loss of half my fortune." And\r\nlifting her face as he spoke, he pressed his own to them again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut for the first time in her life she turned from him as if almost\r\nloathing his caresses, and struggled to release herself from the clasp\r\nof his arm.\r\n\r\nHe let her go, and hurrying to the farther side of the room, she stood\r\nleaning against the window-frame, with her back toward him, shedding\r\nvery bitter tears of mingled grief and anger.\r\n\r\nBut in the pauses of her sobbing a deep sigh struck upon her ear. Her\r\nheart smote her at the sound; still more as she glanced back at her\r\nfather and noted the pained expression of his eye as it met hers. In a\r\nmoment she was at his side again, down upon the carpet, with her head\r\nlaid lovingly on his knee.\r\n\r\n"Papa, I am sorry." The low, street voice was tremulous with grief and\r\npenitence.\r\n\r\n"My poor darling, my poor little pet!" he said, passing his hand with\r\nsoft, caressing movement over her hair and cheek, "try to keep your\r\nlove for your father and your faith in his for you, however hard this\r\nrule may seem."\r\n\r\n"Ah, papa, my heart would break if I lost either," she sobbed. Then\r\nlifting her tear-dimmed eyes with tender concern to his face, which\r\nwas very pale and sad, "Dear papa," she said, "how tired you look! you\r\nwere up all night, were you not?"\r\n\r\n"Last night and the one before it."\r\n\r\n"That you might hasten here to take care of me," she murmured in a\r\ntone of mingled regret and gratitude. "Do lie down now and take a nap.\r\nThis couch is soft and pleasant, and I will close the blinds and sit\r\nby your side to keep off the flies."\r\n\r\nHe yielded to her persuasions, saying as he closed his eyes, "Don\'t\r\nleave the room without waking me."\r\n\r\nShe was still there when he woke, close at his side and ready to\r\ngreet him with an affectionate look and smile, though the latter was\r\ntouchingly sad and there were traces of tears on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"How long have I slept?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Two hours," she answered, holding up her watch, "and there is the\r\ntea-bell."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  What thou bidst,\r\n  Unargued I obey; so God ordained.\r\n\r\n  --MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t intend to hurry this child away from me, Horace?"\r\nremarked Miss Stanhope inquiringly, glancing from him to Elsie, as she\r\npoured out the tea.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I must, Aunt Wealthy," he answered, taking his cup from\r\nher hand, "I can\'t do without her any longer, and mamma and little\r\nbrother want her almost as badly."\r\n\r\n"And what am I to do?" cried Miss Stanhope, setting down the teapot,\r\nand dropping her hands into her lap. "It just makes a baby of me to\r\nthink how lonely the old house will seem when she\'s gone. You\'d get\r\nher back soon, for \'tisn\'t likely I\'ve got long to live, if you\'d only\r\ngive her to me, Horace."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Aunt Wealthy; she\'s a treasure I can\'t spare to any\r\none. She belongs to me, and I intend to keep her," turning upon his\r\ndaughter a proud, fond look and smile, which was answered by one of\r\nsweet, confiding affection.\r\n\r\n"Good-evening!" cried a gay, girlish voice. "Mr. Dinsmore, I\'d be\r\ndelighted to see you, if I didn\'t know you\'d come to rob us of Elsie."\r\n\r\n"What, you too ready to abuse me on that score, Miss Lottie?" he said\r\nlaughingly, as he rose to shake hands with her. "I think I rather\r\ndeserve thanks for leaving her with you so long."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose you do. Aunt Wealthy, papa found some remarkably\r\nfine peaches in the orchard of one of his patients, and begs you will\r\naccept this little basketful."\r\n\r\n"Why, they\'re beautiful, Lottie!" said the old lady, rising and taking\r\nthe basket from her hand. "You must return my best thanks to your\r\nfather. I\'ll set them on the table just so. Take off your hat, child,\r\nand sit down with us. There\'s your chair all ready to your plate,\r\nand Phillis\'s farmer\'s fresh fruit-cake, to tempt you, and the\r\ncream-biscuits that you are so fond of, both."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Lottie, partly in acknowledgment of the invitation,\r\npartly of Mr. Travilla\'s attention, as he rose and gallantly handed\r\nher to her seat, "I can\'t find it in my heart to resist so many\r\ntemptations."\r\n\r\n"Shall I bring a dish for de peaches, mistis?" asked Chloe, who was\r\nwaiting on the table.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let us have them in that old-fashioned china fruit-basket I\'ve\r\nalways admired so much, Aunt Wealthy!" cried Lottie eagerly. "I don\'t\r\nbelieve Elsie has seen it at all."\r\n\r\n"No, so she hasn\'t; but she shall now," said the old lady, hastening\r\ntoward her china-closet. "There, Aunt Chloe, just stand on the dish,\r\nand hand down that chair from this top shelf. Or, if you would,\r\nHorace, you\'re taller, and can reach better. I\'m always like the\r\nsycamore tree that was little of stature, and couldn\'t see Zaccheus\r\ntill he climbed into it."\r\n\r\n"Rather a new and improved version of the Bible narrative, aunt, isn\'t\r\nit?" asked Mr. Dinsmore, with an amused look, as he came toward her.\r\n"And I fear I\'m rather heavy to stand on a dish; but will use the\r\nchair instead, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I\'ve put the horse before the cart as usual, I see;" she said,\r\njoining good-humoredly in the laugh the others found it impossible\r\nto suppress. "It\'s an old trick of my age, that increases with my\r\nadvancing youth, till I sometimes wonder what I\'m coming to; the words\r\nwill tangle themselves up in the most troublesome fashion; but if you\r\nknow what I mean, I suppose it\'s all the same."\r\n\r\n"Why, Aunt Wealthy, this is really beautiful," said Mr. Dinsmore,\r\nstepping from the chair with the basket, in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it belonged to your great-grandmother, Horace, and I prize it\r\nhighly on that account. No, Aunt Chloe, I shall wipe it out and put\r\nthe peaches into it myself; it will take but a moment, and it\'s too\r\nprecious a relic to trust to any other hands than my own."\r\n\r\nLottie was apparently in the gayest spirits, enlivening the little\r\nparty with many a merry jest and light, silvery laugh, enjoying the\r\ngood things before her, and gratifying her hostess with praises of\r\ntheir excellence. Yet through it all she was furtively watching her\r\nfriends, and grieved to notice the unwonted paleness of her cheek, the\r\ntraces of tears about her eyes, that her cheerfulness was assumed,\r\nand that if she ate anything it was only from a desire to please her\r\nfather, who seemed never to forget her for a moment, and to be a good\r\ndeal troubled at her want of appetite. In all these signs Lottie read\r\ndisappointment of Egerton\'s hopes, and of Elsie\'s, so far as he was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n"So I suppose her father has commanded her to give him up," she said\r\nto herself. "Poor thing! I wonder if she means to be as submissive as\r\nshe thought she would."\r\n\r\nThe two presently slipped away together into the garden, leaving the\r\ngentlemen conversing in the sitting-room, and Miss Stanhope busied\r\nwith some household care.\r\n\r\n"You poor dear, I am so sorry for you!" whispered Lottie, putting her\r\narm about her friend. "Must you really quite give him up?"\r\n\r\n"Papa says so," murmured Elsie, vainly struggling to restrain her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Is it that he believes Mr. Travilla was not mistaken?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and--and he has heard some other things against him, and thinks\r\nhis explanation of Mr. Travilla\'s mistake quite absurd. Oh, Lottie, he\r\nwill not even allow us one parting interview and says I am never to\r\nsee Mr. Egerton again, or hold any communication with him in any way.\r\nIf I should meet him in the street I am not to recognize him; must\r\npass him by as a perfect stranger, not looking at him or permitting\r\nhim to see my face, if I can avoid doing so."\r\n\r\n"And will you really submit to all that? I don\'t believe I could be so\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"I must; papa will always be obeyed."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you feel that it\'s very hard? doesn\'t it make you feel\r\nangry with your father and love him a little less?"\r\n\r\n"I was angry for a little while this afternoon," Elsie acknowledged\r\nwith a blush, "but I am sure I have no right to be; I know papa is\r\nacting for my good,--doing just what he believes will be most likely\r\nto secure my happiness. He says it is to save me from a life of\r\nmisery, and certainly it would be that to be united to such a man as\r\nhe believes Mr. Egerton is."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t believe it, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, indeed! I have not lost my faith in him yet, and I hope he\r\nmay some day be able to prove to papa\'s entire satisfaction that he is\r\nreally all that is good, noble, and honorable."\r\n\r\n"That is right; hope on, hope ever."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I don\'t know how we could live without hope," Elsie said, smiling\r\nfaintly through her tears. "But I ought not to be wretched--oh, very\r\nfar from it, with so many blessings, so many to love me! Papa\'s love\r\nalone would brighten life very much to me. And then," she added in a\r\nlower tone, "\'that dearer Friend that sticketh closer than a brother,\'\r\nand who has promised, \'I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\'"\r\n\r\n"And He will keep His promise, child," said Aunt Wealthy, joining them\r\nin the arbor where they had seated themselves. "I have proved His\r\nfaithfulness many times, and I know that it never fails. Elsie, dear,\r\nyour old auntie would save you from every trial, but He is a far wiser\r\nand truer friend, and will cause all things to work together for your\r\ngood, and never allow you to suffer one unneeded pang." She softly\r\nstroked her niece\'s sunny hair, as she spoke, and the kind old face\r\nwas full of pitying tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Come back to the house now, dears," she added, "I think the dew is\r\nbeginning to fall, and I heard my nephew asking for his daughter."\r\n\r\n"How much longer may we hope to keep you, Elsie?" Lottie asked as they\r\nwended their way toward the house.\r\n\r\n"Papa has set Monday evening for the time of leaving."\r\n\r\n"And this is Friday; so we shall have but two more rides together. Oh,\r\ndear! how I shall miss you when you\'re gone."\r\n\r\n"And I you. I shall never forget what pleasant times we have had\r\ntogether; Aunt Wealthy and you and I. You musn\'t let her miss me too\r\nmuch, Lottie." And Elsie turned an affectionate look upon her aged\r\nrelative.\r\n\r\n"As if I could prevent it! But I\'ll do my best; you may rest assured\r\nof that."\r\n\r\n"You are dear girls, both of you," said Miss Stanhope with a very\r\nperceptible tremble in her voice, "and you have brightened my home\r\nwonderfully; if I could only keep you!"\r\n\r\n"Well, auntie, you\'re not likely to lose me altogether for some time\r\nyet," returned Lottie gayly, though the tears shone in her eyes.\r\n\r\nBromly Egerton went out from Mr. Dinsmore\'s presence with his temper\r\nat a white heat, for he had just been treated to some plain truths\r\nthat were far from palatable; besides which it seemed evident that he\r\nhad missed the prize he so coveted and had made such strenuous efforts\r\nto win. He had learned nothing new in regard to his own character, yet\r\nsomehow it had never looked so black as now, when seen through the\r\nspectacles of an upright, honest, vice-detesting Christian gentleman.\r\nHe writhed at the very recollection of the disgust, loathing, and\r\ncontempt expressed in Mr. Dinsmore\'s voice and countenance as well as\r\nin his words.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely gave a thought to the loss of Elsie herself: he had no\r\nfeeling for her at all worthy of the name of love; his base, selfish\r\nnature was, indeed, hardly capable of such a sentiment; especially\r\ntoward one so refined, so guileless in her childlike innocence and\r\npurity that to be with her gave him an uncomfortable sense of his own\r\nmoral inferiority.\r\n\r\nNo, the wounds under which he smarted were all stabs given to his\r\nself-love and cupidity. He had learned how honest men looked upon him;\r\nand he had failed in the cherished expectation of laying his\r\nhands upon a great fortune, which he had fondly hoped to have the\r\nopportunity of spending.\r\n\r\nRushing into the street, boiling with rage and shame, he hurried\r\nonward, scarcely knowing or caring whither he went; out into the open\r\ncountry, and on through woods and over hills he tramped, nor thought\r\nof turning back till the sun had set, and darkness began to creep\r\nabout his path.\r\n\r\nThere was light in Miss Stanhope\'s parlor and strains of rich\r\nmelody greeted his ear as he passed. He turned away with a muttered\r\nimprecation, crossed the street, and entered Mrs. Schilling\'s gate.\r\nShe was sitting on her doorstep, resting after her day\'s work, and\r\nenjoying the cool evening air.\r\n\r\n"Why, la me Mr. Egerton! is that you?" she cried, starting up, and\r\nstepping aside for him to pass in. "I\'d really begun to think you was\r\nlost. The fire\'s been put and everything cleaned away this two hours.\r\nI kep\' the table a-waitin\' for you a right smart spell, but finally\r\ncome to the conclusion that you must \'a\' stayed to Miss Stanhope\'s or\r\nsomeone else, to tea."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ve not had supper," he answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n"You haint, eh? and I \'spose you\'re hungry, too. Well, sit down, and\r\nI\'ll hunt up something or \'nother. But I\'m afraid you\'ll get the\r\ndyspepsy eatin\' so late; why, it\'s nigh on to ten o\'clock; and I was\r\njust a-thinking\' about shutting\' up and going off to bed."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll not be troubled with me long. I shall leave the place in\r\na few days."\r\n\r\n"Leave Lansdale, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"The time I had appropriated to rest and recreation. Business men\r\ncan\'t play forever."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shouldn\'t wonder. And Mr. Dinsmore\'s come after his daughter,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that got to do with it?" he muttered. But she had left the\r\nroom and was out of hearing.\r\n\r\nBefore closing his eyes in sleep that night, Egerton resolved to make\r\na moving appeal to Elsie herself. He would write and find some means\r\nby which to get the letter into her hands. Directly after breakfast\r\nhe sat down to his task, placing himself in a position to constantly\r\noverlook Miss Stanhope\'s house and grounds. He was hoping to get\r\nsight of Elsie, and anxious to watch Mr. Dinsmore\'s movements. Mrs.\r\nSchilling had informed him that "Miss Stanhope\'s friends didn\'t expect\r\nto leave till sometime a Monday; so she had learned from Phillis,\r\nthrough Lenwilla Ellawea, who had been sent over for a little of\r\nPhillis\'s light\'ning, to raise some biscuits for breakfast," yet he\r\nhad some fear that the information might prove unreliable, and Mr.\r\nDinsmore slip away with his daughter that day.\r\n\r\nThat fear was presently relieved by seeing Simon bringing out the\r\nhorses for the young ladies, and shortly after a livery-stable man\r\nleading up two fine steeds, evidently intended for the use of the\r\ngentlemen. He now laid down his pen, and kept close watch for a few\r\nmoments, when he was rewarded by seeing the whole party come out,\r\nmount, and ride away; Mr. Dinsmore beside his daughter, Mr. Travilla\r\nwith Lottie. Elsie, however, was so closely veiled that he could not\r\nso much as catch a glimpse of her face.\r\n\r\nWith a muttered oath, he took up his pen again, feeling more desirous\r\nthan ever to outwit "that haughty Southerner," and secure the prize in\r\nspite of him.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterward Simon, who was at work gathering corn and\r\ntomatoes for dinner in the garden behind the house, heard some one\r\ncalling softly to him from the other side of the fence. Turning his\r\nhead, he saw Mr. Egerton standing there, motioning to him to draw\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n"Good-mornin\', sah. What you want, sah?" inquired the lad, setting\r\ndown his basket, and approaching the fence that separated them.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what this is?" asked Egerton, holding up a small\r\nglittering object.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sah; five-dollar gold piece, sah," replied the negro, bowing and\r\nchuckling. "What de gentleman want dis niggah do for to arn \'em?"\r\n\r\n"To put this into Miss Dinsmore\'s hands," answered Egerton, showing\r\na letter; "into her own hands, now, mind. If you do that, the five\r\ndollars are yours; and if you bring me an answer, I\'ll make it ten.\r\nBut you are to manage it so that no one else shall see what you do. Do\r\nyou understand?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sah, and I bet I do it up about right, sah."\r\n\r\nVery anxious to win the coveted reward, Simon was careful to be on\r\nhand when the riding party returned. He stationed himself near Elsie\'s\r\nhorse. Her father assisted her to alight, and as he turned to make a\r\nremark to Lottie, Simon, being on the alert, managed to slip the note\r\ninto Elsie\'s hand, unperceived by Mr. Dinsmore, or the others.\r\n\r\nShe gave a start of surprise, turning her eyes inquiringly upon him,\r\nthe rich color rushing all over her fair face and neck; as he could\r\nsee, even through the folds of her thick veil.\r\n\r\nSimon grinned broadly, as, by a nod and wink toward the opposite side\r\nof the street, he indicated whence the missive had come.\r\n\r\nShe turned and walked quickly toward the house, her heart beating very\r\nfast and loud, and her fingers tightly clasping the note underneath\r\nthe folds of her long riding-skirt, as she held it up. She hurried\r\nto her room, shut and locked the door, and, throwing off her hat and\r\nveil, dropped into a seat, trembling in every limb with the agitation\r\nand excitement of her feelings. She longed intently to know what he\r\nhad said to her; but she had never deceived or wilfully disobeyed her\r\nfather, and should she begin now? The temptation was very great, and\r\nperhaps she would have yielded; but Mr. Dinsmore\'s step came quickly\r\nup the stairs, and the next moment he rapped lightly on the door.\r\n\r\nShe rose and opened it, at the same time slipping the note into her\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n"Why, my darling, what is the matter?" he asked, looking much\r\nconcerned at the sight of her pale, agitated countenance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, if you would let me! if you only would!" she cried,\r\nbursting into tears, and putting her arms coaxingly about his neck.\r\n\r\n"Let you do what, my child?" he asked, stroking her hair.\r\n\r\n"Read this," she said, in a choking voice, taking the note from her\r\npocket. "Oh, if you knew how much I want to! Mayn\'t I, papa? do, dear\r\npapa, say yes."\r\n\r\n"No, Elsie; it grieves me to deny you, but it must go back unopened.\r\nGive it to me."\r\n\r\nShe put it into his hand and turned away with a sob.\r\n\r\n"How did it come into your hands?" he inquired, going to her\r\nwriting-desk for an envelope, pen and ink.\r\n\r\n"Must I tell you, papa?" she asked; in a tone that spoke reluctance to\r\ngive the information he required.\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Simon gave it to me a few moments since."\r\n\r\nHe touched the bell, and, Chloe appearing in answer, bade her take\r\nthat note to the house on the opposite side of the street.\r\n\r\n"There is no message," he added; "it is directed to Mr. Egerton, and\r\nyou have nothing to do but hand it in at the door."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sah." And with a sorrowful, pitying glance at the wet eyes of\r\nher young mistress, the faithful old creature left the room.\r\n\r\n"My poor little daughter, you feel now that your father is very\r\ncruel," Mr. Dinsmore said tenderly, taking Elsie in his arms again,\r\n"but some day you will thank me for all this."\r\n\r\nShe only laid her face down on his breast and cried bitterly, while he\r\nsoothed her with caresses and words of fatherly endearment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, don\'t be vexed with me," she murmured at length. "I\'m\r\ntrying not to be rebellious, but it seems so like condemning him\r\nunheard."\r\n\r\n"No, my child, it is not. I gave him the opportunity to refute the\r\ncharges against him, but he has no proof to bring."\r\n\r\n"Papa, he said it would break his heart to lose me," she cried with a\r\nfresh burst of grief.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, he has no heart to break. If he could get possession\r\nof your property, he would care very little indeed what became of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore spoke very decidedly, but, though silenced, Elsie was not\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nEgerton, watching through the half-closed blinds of his bed-room, had\r\nseen, with a chuckle of delight, the success of Simon\'s manoeuvre,\r\nand Elsie hurrying into the house; for the purpose--he had scarcely\r\na doubt--of secretly reading and answering his note. He saw Chloe\r\ncrossing the street, and thought that her young mistress had sent him\r\na hasty line, perhaps to appoint the time and place of a clandestine\r\nmeeting; for such confidence had he in his own powers of fascination\r\nfor all the fair sex, that he could not think it possible she could\r\ngive him up without a struggle.\r\n\r\nLenwilla went to the door, and in his eagerness to receive the message\r\nhe ran out and met her on the landing. What was his disappointment and\r\nchagrin at sight of the bold, masculine characters on the outside, and\r\nonly his own handwriting within!\r\n\r\n"Sent back unopened! The girl must be a fool!" he cried, fairly\r\ngnashing his teeth with rage. "She could have managed it easily\r\nenough; she had the best chance in the world, for he didn\'t see her\r\ntake it, I know."\r\n\r\nHe considered a moment, put on his hat, and, walking over to Dr.\r\nKing\'s, inquired for Miss Lottie.\r\n\r\n"Jist walk intil the parlor, sir," said Bridget, "an\' I\'ll call the\r\nyoung lady."\r\n\r\nLottie came to him presently, with her kind face full of regret and\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nHe told his tale, produced his note, and begged her to be his\r\nmessenger, saying he supposed Mr. Dinsmore had come upon Elsie before\r\nshe had time to read it, and he thought it hard for both her and\r\nhimself that she should not have the chance.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lottie, "but I am very sure she would not read it without\r\nher father\'s permission, and you may depend upon it, she showed it to\r\nhim of her own accord."\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with an incredulous smile. "Do you really think she\r\nhas so little sense? Or is it that you believe she too has turned\r\nagainst me?"\r\n\r\n"No, she has not turned against you, she believes in you still; nor is\r\nshe wanting in sense; but she is extremely conscientious about obeying\r\nher father, and told me she meant to be entirely submissive, whatever\r\nit cost her."\r\n\r\n"I can hardly think you are right," he said, with another of his\r\nincredulous smiles, "but even supposing she was silly enough to hand\r\nmy note over to her father, I should like to give her an opportunity\r\nto retrieve her error, so won\'t you undertake"--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me to carry it to her," interrupted Lottie. "It would go\r\nagainst my conscience to tempt Elsie to do violence to hers, I do\r\nassure you, though I have no idea I should be successful. So you\r\nreally must excuse me."\r\n\r\nHe tried argument and persuasion by turns, but Lottie stood firm in\r\nher refusal, and at length he went away, evidently very angry.\r\n\r\nLottie spent the evening with her friend, and when a fitting\r\nopportunity offered gave her an account of this interview with\r\nEgerton, Elsie telling her in return something of what had passed\r\nbetween her father and herself in regard to the note.\r\n\r\nThat Egerton had desired to tempt her to disobedience and deception\r\ndid not tend to increase Elsie\'s esteem and admiration for him, but\r\nquite the reverse.\r\n\r\n"I think he\'ll not prevent me from getting sight of her to-day,"\r\nmuttered Egerton, stationing himself at the front window the next\r\nmorning, as the hour for church drew near.\r\n\r\nHe had not been there long, when he saw Miss Stanhope and Mr.\r\nTravilla, then Mr. Dinsmore and Elsie, come out of the house and cross\r\nthe lawn. He made a hasty exit and was in the act of opening Mrs.\r\nSchilling\'s front gate as the latter couple reached the one opposite.\r\n\r\n"Put down your veil, Elsie; take my arm; and don\'t look toward that\r\nman at all," commanded her father, and she obeyed.\r\n\r\nEgerton kept opposite to them all the way to the church, but without\r\naccomplishing his object. He followed them in and placed himself in a\r\npew on the other side of the aisle, and a little nearer the front than\r\nMiss Stanhope\'s, so that, by turning half way round, he could look\r\ninto the faces of its occupants. But Elsie kept hers partly concealed\r\nby her veil, and never once turned her eyes in his direction.\r\n\r\nShe was seated next her father, who seemed to watch her almost\r\nconstantly--not with the air of a jailer, but with a sort of tender,\r\nprotecting care, as one keeping guard over something belonging to him,\r\nand which he esteemed very sweet and precious,--while now and then\r\nher soft eyes were lifted to his for an instant with a look of loving\r\nreverence.\r\n\r\n"Poor Elsie was well watched to-day," remarked Nettie King to her\r\nsister as they walked home together; "her father scarcely took his\r\neyes off her for five consecutive minutes, I should think; and Mr.\r\nEgerton stared at her from the time he came in till the benediction\r\nwas pronounced."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I thought he was decidedly rude."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Mr. Dinsmore excessively strict and exacting?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so; yet he dotes on her, and she on him. I never saw a\r\nfather and daughter so completely wrapped up in each other."\r\n\r\nThey were now within sight of their own home, and Miss Stanhope\'s.\r\n\r\n"Just look!" cried Nettie, "I do believe Egerton means to force\r\nhimself upon their notice and compel Elsie to speak to him."\r\n\r\nHe was crossing the street so as to meet them face to face, just at\r\nthe gate, giving them no chance to avoid the rencontre.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Miss Dinsmore," he said in a loud, cordial tone of\r\ngreeting, as they neared each other.\r\n\r\nElsie started and tightened her grasp of her father\'s arm, but neither\r\nlooked up nor spoke.\r\n\r\n"My daughter acknowledges no acquaintance with you, sir," answered Mr.\r\nDinsmore, haughtily, and Egerton turned and strode angrily away.\r\n\r\n"There, Elsie, you see what he is; his behavior is anything but\r\ngentlemanly," remarked her father, opening the gate for her to pass\r\nin. "But you need not tremble so, child; there is nothing to fear."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  Oh, what a feeble fort\'s a woman\'s heart,\r\n  Betrayed by nature, and besieged by art.\r\n\r\n  --FANE\'S "LOVE IN THE DARK."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Dear child, what shall I do without you?" sighed Miss Stanhope,\r\nclasping Elsie in her arms, and holding her in a long, tender embrace;\r\nfor the time of parting had come. "Horace, will you bring her to see\r\nme again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, aunt, if she wants to come. But don\'t ask me to leave her\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you can\'t stay with me, or trust her yourself, let Mr.\r\nVanilla come and stand guard over us both. I\'d be happy, sir, at any\r\ntime when you can make it convenient for me to see you here, with\r\nHorace and the child, or without them."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Miss Stanhope; and mother and I would be delighted to see\r\nyou at Ion."\r\n\r\n"Come, Elsie, we must go; the carriage is waiting and the train nearly\r\ndue," said Mr. Dinsmore. "Good-bye, Aunt Wealthy. Daughter, put down\r\nyour veil."\r\n\r\nEgerton was at the depot, but could get neither a word with Elsie, nor\r\nso much as a sight of her face. Her veil was not once lifted, and\r\nher father never left her side for a moment. Mr. Travilla bought the\r\ntickets, and Simon attended to the checking of the baggage. Then the\r\ntrain came thundering up, and the fair girl was hurried into it,\r\nMr. Travilla, on one side, and her father on the other, effectually\r\npreventing any near approach to her person on the part of the baffled\r\nand disappointed fortune-hunter.\r\n\r\nHe walked back to his boarding-house, cursing his ill luck and Messrs.\r\nDinsmore and Travilla, and gave notice to his landlady that his room\r\nwould become vacant the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs the train sped onward, again Elsie laid her head down upon her\r\nfather\'s shoulder and wept silently behind her veil. Her feelings had\r\nbeen wrought up to a high pitch of excitement in the struggle to be\r\nperfectly submissive and obedient, and now the overstrained nerves\r\nclaimed this relief. And love\'s young dream, the first, and sweetest,\r\nwas over and gone. She could never hope to see again the man she still\r\nfondly imagined to be good and noble, and with a heart full of deep,\r\npassionate love for her.\r\n\r\nHer father understood and sympathized with it all. He passed his arm\r\nabout her waist, drew her closer to him, and taking her hand in his,\r\nheld it in a warm, loving clasp.\r\n\r\nHow it soothed and comforted her. She could never be very wretched\r\nwhile thus tenderly loved, and cherished.\r\n\r\nAnd, arrived at her journey\'s end, there were mamma and little brother\r\nto rejoice over her return, as at the recovery of a long-lost,\r\nprecious treasure.\r\n\r\n"You shall never go away again," said the little fellow, hugging her\r\ntight. "When a boy has only one sister, he can\'t spare her to other\r\nfolks, can he, papa?"\r\n\r\n"No, son," answered Mr. Dinsmore, patting his rosy cheek, and softly\r\nstroking Elsie\'s hair, "and it is just the same with a man who has but\r\none daughter."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look bright and merry, as you did when you went away," said\r\nthe child, bending a gaze of keen, loving scrutiny upon the sweet\r\nface, paler, sadder, and more heavy-eyed than he had ever seen it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Sister is tired with her journey," said mamma tenderly; "we won\'t\r\ntease her to-night."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said her father, "she must go early to bed, and have a long\r\nnight\'s rest."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, and then she\'ll be all right to-morrow, won\'t she? But,\r\nmamma, I wasn\'t teasing her, not a bit; was I, Elsie? And if anybody\'s\r\nbeen making her sorry, I\'ll kill him. \'Cause she\'s my sister, and I\'ve\r\ngot to take care of her."\r\n\r\n"But suppose papa was the one who had made her sorry; what then?"\r\nasked Mr. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t, papa," said the boy, shaking his head with an\r\nincredulous smile. "You love her too much a great deal; you\'d never\r\nmake her sorry unless she\'d be naughty; and she\'s never one bit\r\nnaughty,--always minds you and mamma the minute you speak."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true, my son; I do love her far too well ever to grieve her if\r\nit can be helped. She shall never know a pang a father\'s love and care\r\ncan save her from." And again his hand rested caressingly on Elsie\'s\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nShe caught it in both of hers and laying her cheek lovingly against\r\nit, looked up at him with tears trembling in her eyes. "I know it,\r\npapa," she murmured. "I know you love your foolish little daughter\r\nvery dearly; almost as dearly as she loves you."\r\n\r\n"Almost, darling? If there were any gauge by which to measure love, I\r\nknow not whose would be found the greatest."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore and his father-in-law had taken adjoining cottages for\r\nthe summer, and though "the season" was so nearly over that the hotels\r\nand boarding-houses were but thinly populated and would soon close,\r\nthe two families intended remaining another month. So this was in some\r\nsort a home-coming to Elsie.\r\n\r\nAfter tea the Allisons flocked in to bid her welcome. All seemed glad\r\nof her coming, Richard, Harold, and Sophy especially so. They were\r\nfull of plans for giving her pleasure, and crowding the greatest\r\npossible amount of enjoyment into the four or five weeks of their\r\nexpected sojourn on the island.\r\n\r\n"It will be moonlight next week," said Sophy; "and we\'ll have some\r\ndelightful drives and walks along the beach. The sea does look so\r\nlovely by moonlight."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll have such fun bathing in the mornings," remarked Harold.\r\n"You\'ll go in with us to-morrow, won\'t you, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Dinsmore, speaking for his daughter; "she must be\r\nhere two or three days before she goes into the water. It will be\r\naltogether better for her health."\r\n\r\nElise looked at him inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"You get in the air enough of the salt water for the first few days,"\r\nhe said. "Your system should become used to that before you take\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is what some of the doctors here, and the oldest\r\ninhabitants, tell us," remarked Mr. Allison, "and I believe it is the\r\nbetter plan."\r\n\r\n"And in the meantime we can take some rides and drives,--down to\r\nDiamond Beach, over to the light-house, and elsewhere," said Edward\r\nAllison, his brother Richard adding, "and do a little fishing and\r\nboating."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore was watching his daughter. She was making an effort to be\r\ninterested in the conversation, but looking worn, weary, and sad.\r\n\r\n"You are greatly fatigued, my child," he said. "We will excuse you and\r\nlet you retire at once."\r\n\r\nShe was very glad to avail herself of the permission.\r\n\r\nRose followed her to her room, a pleasant, breezy apartment, opening\r\non a veranda, and looking out upon the sea, whose dark waves, here\r\nand there tipped with foam, could be dimly seen rolling and tossing\r\nbeneath the light of the stars and of a young moon that hung like a\r\ngolden crescent just above the horizon.\r\n\r\nElsie walked to the window and looked out. "How I love the sea," she\r\nsaid, sighing, "but, mamma, to-night it makes me think of a text--\'All\r\nThy waves and Thy billows have gone over me.\'"\r\n\r\n"It is not so bad as that, I hope, dear," said Rose, folding her\r\ntenderly in her arms; "think how we all love you, especially your\r\nfather. I don\'t know how we could any of us do without you, darling. I\r\ncan\'t tell you how sadly we have missed you this summer."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I do feel it to be very, very sweet to be so loved and cared\r\nfor. I could not tell you how dear you and my little brother are to\r\nme, and as for papa--sometimes I am more than half afraid I make an\r\nidol of him; and yet--oh, mamma," she murmured, hiding her face in\r\nRose\'s bosom, "why is it that I can no longer be in love with the\r\nloves that so fully satisfied me?"\r\n\r\n"\'Thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\' It\r\nis part of woman\'s curse that she must ever crave that sort of love,\r\noften yielding to her craving, to her own terrible undoing. Be\r\npatient, darling, and try to trust both your heavenly and your earthly\r\nfather. You know that no trial can come to you without your heavenly\r\nFather\'s will, and that He means this for your good. Look to Him and\r\nhe will help you to bear it, and send relief in His own good time and\r\nway. You know He tells us it is through much tribulation we enter\r\nthe kingdom of God; and that whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth,\r\nand scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. \'If ye be without\r\nchastisements, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and no\r\nsons!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, mamma; better the hardest of earthly trials, than to be left\r\nout of the number of his adopted children. And this seems to be really\r\nmy only one, while my cup of blessings is full to overflowing. I fear\r\nI am very wicked to feel so sad."\r\n\r\n"Let us sit down on this couch while we talk; you are too tired\r\nto stand," said Rose, drawing her away from the window to a\r\nsoftly-cushioned lounge. "I do not think you can help grieving,\r\ndarling, though I agree with you that it is your duty to try to be\r\ncheerful, as well as patient and submissive; and I trust you will find\r\nit easier as the days and weeks move on. You are very young, and have\r\nplenty of time to wait; indeed, if all had gone right, you know your\r\npapa would not have allowed you to marry for several years yet."\r\n\r\n"You know all, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear; papa told me; for you know you are my darling daughter\r\ntoo, and I have a very deep interest in all that concerns you."\r\n\r\nA tender caress accompanied the words, and was returned with equal\r\nardor.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, best and kindest of mothers; I should never want anything\r\nkept from you."\r\n\r\n"Your father tells me you have behaved beautifully, though you\r\nevidently felt it very hard to be separated so entirely and at once\r\nfr--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma," and Elsie\'s lip quivered, and her eyes filled, "and oh,\r\nI can\'t believe he is the wicked man papa thinks him. From the first\r\nhe seemed to be a perfect gentleman, educated, polished, and refined;\r\nand afterward he became--at least so I thought from the conversations\r\nwe had together--truly converted, and a very earnest, devoted\r\nChristian. He told me he had been, at one time, a little wild, but\r\nsurely he ought not to be condemned for that, after he had repented\r\nand reformed."\r\n\r\n"No, dear; and your father would agree with you in that. But he\r\nbelieves you have been deceived in the man\'s character; and don\'t you\r\nthink, daughter, that he is wiser than yourself, and more capable of\r\nfinding out the truth about the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I know papa is far wiser than I, but, oh, my heart will not believe\r\nwhat they say of--of him!" she cried with sudden, almost passionate\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, that is perfectly natural, but try to be entirely\r\nsubmissive to your father, and wait patiently; and hopefully too," she\r\nadded with a smile; "for if Mr. Egerton is really good, no doubt it\r\nwill be proved in time, and then your father will at once remove his\r\ninterdict. And if you are mistaken, you will one day discover it, and\r\nfeel thankful, indeed, to your papa for taking just the course he\r\nhas."\r\n\r\n"There he is now!" Elsie said with a start, as Mr. Dinsmore\'s step was\r\nheard without, and Chloe opened the door in answer to his rap.\r\n\r\n"What, Elsie disobeying orders, and mamma conniving at it!" he\r\nexclaimed in a tone that might mean either jest or serious reproof.\r\n"Did I not bid you go to bed at once, my daughter?"\r\n\r\n"I thought it was only permission, papa, not command," she answered,\r\nlifting her eyes to his face, and moving to make room for him by her\r\nside. "And mamma has been saying such sweet, comforting things to me."\r\n\r\n"Has she, darling? Bless her for it! I know you need comfort, my poor\r\nlittle pet," he said, taking the offered seat, and passing his arm\r\nround her waist. "But you need rest too, and ought not to stay up any\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\n"But surely papa knows I cannot go to bed without my good-night kiss\r\nwhen he is in the same house with me," she said, winding her arms\r\nabout his neck.\r\n\r\n"And didn\'t like to take it before folks? Well, that was right, but\r\ntake it now. There, good-night. Now mamma and I will run away, and you\r\nmust get into bed with all speed. No mistake about the command this\r\ntime, and disobedience, if ventured on, will have to be punished," he\r\nsaid with playful tenderness, as he returned her embrace, and rose to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\n"The dear child; my heart aches for her," he remarked to his wife,\r\nas they went out together, "and I find it almost impossible yet to\r\nforgive either that scoundrel Jackson or my brother Arthur."\r\n\r\n"You have no lingering doubts as to the identity and utter\r\nunworthiness of the man?"\r\n\r\n"Not one; and if I could only convince Elsie of his true character\r\nshe would detest him as thoroughly as I do. If he had his deserts, he\r\nwould be in the State\'s Prison; and to think of his daring to approach\r\nmy child, and even aspire to her hand!"\r\n\r\nElsie lay all night in a profound slumber, and awoke at an early hour\r\nthe next morning, feeling greatly refreshed and invigorated. The\r\ngentle murmur of old ocean came pleasantly to her ear, and sweetly\r\nin her mind arose the thought of Him whom even the winds and the sea\r\nobey; of His never failing love to her, and of the many great and\r\nprecious promises of His word. She remembered how He had said, "Your\r\nFather knoweth that ye have need of all these things," and, content to\r\nbear the cross He had sent her, and leave her future in His hands, she\r\nrose to begin the new day more cheerful and hopeful than she had been\r\nsince learning her father\'s decision in regard to Egerton.\r\n\r\nThrowing on a dressing-gown over her night dress, she sat down before\r\nthe open window with her Bible in her hand. She still loved, as of\r\nold, to spend the first hour of the day in the study of its pages, and\r\nin communion with Him whose word it is.\r\n\r\nChloe was just putting the finishing touches to her young lady\'s\r\ntoilet when little Horace came running down the hall, and rapping on\r\nElsie\'s door, called out, "Sister, papa says put on a short dress, and\r\nyour walking shoes, and come take a stroll on the beach with us before\r\nbreakfast."\r\n\r\n"Yes, tell papa I will. I\'ll be down in five minutes."\r\n\r\nShe came down looking sweet and fresh as the morning; a smile on the\r\nfull red lips, and a faint tinge of rose color on the cheeks that had\r\nbeen so pale the night before.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you are something like yourself again," said Rose, greeting her\r\nwith a motherly caress, as they met in the lower hall. "How nice it is\r\nto have you at home once more."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, mamma, I am very glad to be here; and I had such a good\r\nrestful sleep. How well you look."\r\n\r\n"And feel too, I am thankful to be able to say. But there, your father\r\nis calling to you from the sitting-room."\r\n\r\nElsie hastened to obey the summons, and found him seated at his\r\nwriting desk.\r\n\r\n"Come here, daughter," he said, "and tell me if you obeyed orders last\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I did."\r\n\r\n"I am writing a few lines to Aunt Wealthy, to tell her of our safe\r\narrival. Have you any message to send?" and laying down his pen he\r\ndrew her to his knee.\r\n\r\n"Only my love, papa, and--and that she must not be anxious about me,\r\nas she said that she should. That I am very safe and happy in the\r\nhands of my heavenly Father--and those of the kind earthly one He has\r\ngiven me," she added in a whisper, putting her arms about his neck,\r\nand looking in his face with eyes brimful of filial tenderness and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n"That is right, my darling," he said, "and you shall never want for\r\nlove while your father lives. How it rejoices my heart to see you\r\nlooking so bright and well this morning."\r\n\r\n"I feat I have not been yielding you the cheerful obedience I ought,\r\npapa," she murmured with tears in her eyes, "but I am resolved to try\r\nto do so in future; and have been asking help where I know it is to be\r\nobtained."\r\n\r\n"I have no fault to find with you on that score, my dear child," he\r\nsaid tenderly, "but if you can be cheerful, it will be for your own\r\nhappiness, as well as ours."\r\n\r\nShe kept her promise faithfully, and had her reward in much real\r\nenjoyment of the many pleasures provided for her.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Dinsmore were still youthful in their feelings, and\r\njoined with great zest in the sports of the young people, going with\r\nthem in all their excursions, taking an active part in all their\r\npastimes, and contriving so many fresh entertainments, that during\r\nthose few weeks life seemed like one long gala day.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla was with them most of the time. He had tarried behind in\r\nPhiladelphia, as Mr. Dinsmore and his daughter passed through, but\r\nfollowed them to Cape Island a few days later.\r\n\r\nThe whole party left the shore about the last of September, the\r\nAllisons returning to their city residence, Mr. Travilla to his\r\nSouthern home, and the Dinsmores travelling through Pennsylvania and\r\nNew York, from one romantic and picturesque spot to another; finishing\r\nup with two or three weeks in Philadelphia, during which Rose and\r\nElsie were much occupied with their fall and winter shopping.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore took this opportunity to pay another flying visit to his\r\ntwo young brothers. He found Arthur nearly recovered, and at once\r\nasked a full explanation of the affair of Tom Jackson, alias Bromly\r\nEgerton; his designs upon Elsie, and Arthur\'s participation in them.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it," was the sullen rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"You certainly were acquainted with Tom Jackson, and how, but through\r\nyou, could he have gained any knowledge of Elsie and her whereabouts?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny that I\'ve had some dealings with Jackson, but your\r\nEgerton I know nothing of whatever."\r\n\r\n"You may as well speak the truth, sir; it will be much better for\r\nyou in the end," said Mr. Dinsmore, sternly, his eyes flashing with\r\nindignant anger.\r\n\r\n"And you may as well remember that it isn\'t Elsie you are dealing\r\nwith. I\'m not afraid of you."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not, but you may well fear Him who has said, \'a lying tongue\r\nis but for a moment.\' How do you reconcile such an assertion as you\r\nhave just made with the fact of your having that letter in your\r\npossession?"\r\n\r\n"I say it\'s a cowardly piece of business for you to give the lie to a\r\nfellow that hasn\'t the strength to knock you down for it."\r\n\r\n"You would hardly attempt that if you were in perfect health, Arthur."\r\n\r\n"I would."\r\n\r\n"You have not answered my question about the letter.\r\n\r\n"I wrote it myself."\r\n\r\n"A likely story; it is in a very different hand from yours."\r\n\r\n"I can adopt that hand on occasion, as I\'ll prove to your\r\nsatisfaction."\r\n\r\nHe opened his desk, wrote a sentence on a scrap of paper, and handed\r\nit to Mr. Dinsmore. The chirography was precisely that of the letter.\r\nWhile slowly convalescing, Arthur had prepared for this expected\r\ninterview with Horace, by spending many a solitary hour in laboriously\r\nteaching himself to imitate Jackson\'s ordinary hand, in which most of\r\nthe letters he had received from him were written. The sentence he had\r\nfirst penned was, "I did it merely for my own amusement, and to hoax\r\nWal."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a word of it," said Mr. Dinsmore, looking sternly at\r\nhim. "Arthur, you had better be frank and open with me. You will gain\r\nnothing by denying the hand you have had in this disgraceful business.\r\nYou can hardly suppose me credulous enough to believe an assertion so\r\nperfectly absurd as this. I have no doubt that you sent that villain\r\nto Lansdale to try his arts upon Elsie; and for that you are richly\r\ndeserving of my anger, and of any punishment it might be in my power\r\nto deal out to you.\r\n\r\n"It has been no easy matter for me to forgive the suffering you have\r\ncaused my child, Arthur; but I came here to-day with kind feelings and\r\nintentions. I hoped to find you penitent and ready to forsake your\r\nevil courses; and in that case, intended to help you to pay off your\r\ndebts and begin anew, without paining father with the knowledge that\r\nhis confidence in you has been again so shamefully abused. But I must\r\nsay that your persistent denial of your complicity with that scoundrel\r\nJackson does not look much like contrition, or intended amendment."\r\n\r\nArthur listened in sullen silence, though his rapidly changing color\r\nshowed that he felt the cutting rebuke keenly. At one time he had\r\nresolved to confess everything, throw himself upon the mercy of his\r\nfather and brother, and begin to lead an honest, upright life; but a\r\nthreatening letter received that morning from Jackson had led him to\r\nchange his purpose, and determine to close his lips for a time.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore paused for a reply, but none came.\r\n\r\nWalter looked at Arthur in surprise. "Come, Art, speak, why don\'t\r\nyou?" he said. "Horace, don\'t look so stern and angry, I know he means\r\nto turn over a new leaf; for he told me so. And you will help him,\r\nwon\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I ask no favors from a man who throws the lie in my teeth," muttered\r\nArthur angrily.\r\n\r\n"And I can give none to one who persists in denying his guilt,"\r\nreplied Mr. Dinsmore. "But, Arthur, I give you one more chance, and\r\nfor our father\'s sake I hope you will avail yourself of it. If you go\r\non as you have for the last three or four years, you will bring down\r\nhis gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. I presume you have put\r\nyourself in Jackson\'s power; but if you will now make a full and free\r\nconfession to me, and promise amendment, I will help you to get rid of\r\nthe rascal\'s claims upon you, and start afresh. Will you do it?"\r\n\r\n"No, you\'ve called me a liar, and what\'s the use of my telling you\r\nanything? you wouldn\'t believe it if I did."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  She is not sad, yet in her gaze appears\r\n  Something that makes the gazer think of tears.\r\n\r\n  --MRS. EMBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family at Roselands were gathered about the breakfast-table. A\r\nmuch smaller party than of yore, since Horace had taken Elsie and\r\nset up an establishment of his own, and the other sons were away at\r\ncollege and two daughters married; leaving only Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore,\r\nAdelaide and Enna to occupy the old home.\r\n\r\n"I presume you have the lion\'s share as usual, papa," observed the\r\nlast named, as her father opened the letter-bag which Pomp had just\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\n"And who has a better right, Miss Malapert?" retorted the old\r\ngentleman. "Yes, here are several letters for me; but as there is one\r\napiece for the rest of you, nobody need complain. Here, Pomp, hand\r\nthis to your mistress. From Walter, I see."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she answered, opening it, "and a few lines from Arthur too. I\'m\r\nglad he\'s able to write again, poor fellow!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Adelaide. "Rose says Horace has been up there and found\r\nhim nearly recovered. She writes that they are coming home."\r\n\r\n"When?" asked Enna.\r\n\r\n"Why, to-day! the letter has been delayed," said her sister, looking\r\nat the date. "I shall ride over directly, to see that all is in order\r\nfor them at the Oaks."\r\n\r\n"There is no need," remarked her mother. "Rose will have written to\r\nMrs. Murray."\r\n\r\n"I presume so, still I shall go; it will be pleasant to be there to\r\nwelcome them when they arrive."\r\n\r\n"How fond you are of Rose," said Mrs. Dinsmore in a piqued tone; "you\r\nwouldn\'t do more for one of your own sisters, I believe, than for\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t do less, mamma, and I am very fond of her; we are so\r\nperfectly congenial."\r\n\r\n"And Elsie\'s a great pet of yours, too," said Enna sneeringly. "Well,\r\nI shall put off my call till to-morrow, when the trunks will have been\r\nunpacked, and I shall have a chance to see the fashions. Elsie will\r\nhave loads of new things; it\'s perfectly absurd the way Horace heaps\r\npresents upon her, and pocket-money too. Such loads of jewelry as she\r\nhas,--two or three gold watches, and everything else in proportion."\r\n\r\n"He may as well; she can never spend the half of her income," remarked\r\nMr. Dinsmore. "Unless she takes to gambling," he added, in a tone that\r\nseemed to say that his purse had suffered severely from some one\'s\r\nindulgence in that vice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore winced, Enna looked vexed and annoyed, and Adelaide sad\r\nand troubled; but when she spoke it was in answer to Enna.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Elsie will have a great many beautiful things to show us, of\r\ncourse; but, though she wears nothing outre, she has never been, and I\r\nthink never will be a mirror of fashion. It would suit neither her own\r\ntaste nor Horace\'s; and you know, fond of her as he is, he will never\r\nallow her to have a will of her own in dress or anything else. So it\r\nis well their tastes harmonize."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be his child for all her money," said Enna.\r\n\r\n"There would be some fighting if you were," said her father, laughing.\r\n\r\n"I never could tell whether he tyrannized over Rose in the same style\r\nor not," observed Mrs. Dinsmore interrogatively.\r\n\r\n"All I know about it is that they seem perfectly happy in each other,"\r\nanswered Adelaide; "but I don\'t suppose Horace considers a husband\'s\r\nauthority by any means equal to a father\'s."\r\n\r\nSomething delayed Adelaide, and it was nearly two hours after they\r\nrose from the table ere she was fairly on her way to the Oaks.\r\n\r\n"Why, they are here before me!" she exclaimed half aloud as she came\r\nin sight of the house.\r\n\r\nThere were piles of luggage upon the veranda, and the whole family,\r\nincluding all the house servants, were gathered round a large\r\nopen trunk from which Mrs. Dinsmore and Elsie were dealing out\r\ngifts--dresses, aprons, bonnets, hats, gay handkerchiefs, etc., etc.;\r\nthe darkies receiving them with a delight that was pleasant to see.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore too was taking his part in the distribution, and as\r\nAdelaide rode up little Horace was in the act of throwing a gay shawl\r\nabout the shoulders of his nurse, who caught him in her arms and\r\nhugged and kissed him over and over, calling him "honey," and "pet,"\r\nand "you ole mammy\'s darlin\' ole chil\'!"\r\n\r\nSo much engaged were they all that no one perceived Adelaide\'s\r\napproach till she had reined in her horse close to the veranda, and\r\nthrowing her bridle to her attendant, sprung lightly to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut then there was a shout of welcome from little Horace, followed\r\ninstantly by joyous exclamations and embraces from the others.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, what a long stay you made of it!" said Adelaide. "You can\r\nhave no idea how I missed you all; even down to this little man,"\r\npatting Horace\'s rosy cheek. "You look remarkably well, Rose; and the\r\ntwo Horaces also; but Elsie, I think, has grown a little pale, thin,\r\nand heavy-eyed. What ails you, child? Pining for your native air--no,\r\nhome air--I presume. Is that it?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly pining for it, auntie, but very glad to get back,\r\nnevertheless," Elsie answered, with a blush and a smile.\r\n\r\n"And you are not pale now. But don\'t let me interrupt your pleasant\r\nemployment. I wish I had been in time to see the whole of it."\r\n\r\n"You are in season for your own gifts. Will you accept a trifle from\r\nme?" said her brother, putting a jewel-case into her hand.\r\n\r\n"Coral! and what a beautiful shade!" she cried. "Thank you; they are\r\njust what I wanted."\r\n\r\n"I thought they would contrast prettily with this, auntie," said\r\nElsie, laying a dress-pattern of black silk upon her lap.\r\n\r\n"And these are to be worn at the same time, if it so pleases you,"\r\nadded Rose, presenting her with collar and undersleeves of point lace.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rose, how lovely! and even little Horace bringing auntie a gift!"\r\nas the child slipped something into her hand.\r\n\r\n"It\'s only a card-case; but mamma said you\'d like it, Aunt Adie."\r\n\r\n"And I do; it\'s very pretty. And here\'s a hug and a kiss for the pet\r\nboy that remembered his old-maid auntie."\r\n\r\n"Old maid, indeed! Adelaide, I\'ll not have you talking so," said Rose.\r\n"There\'s nothing old-maidish about you; not even age yet; a girl of\r\ntwenty-six to be calling herself that! it\'s perfectly absurd. Isn\'t\r\nit, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, indeed," replied Mr. Dinsmore. "Here, Jim, Cato, and the\r\nrest of you carry in these trunks and boxes, and let us have them\r\nunpacked and put out of sight."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" said Adelaide, "I want to see all the fine things you have\r\nbrought, Rose. Mamma, Enna, and I are depending upon you and Elsie for\r\nthe fashions."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we had all our fall and winter dresses made up in Philadelphia;\r\nwe prefer their styles to the New York; they don\'t go to such\r\nextremes, you know; and besides--hailing from the Quaker city as I do,\r\nit\'s natural I should be partial to her plainer ways--but we brought\r\nquantities of patterns from both places; knowing that nothing was\r\nlikely to be too gay for Enna. We will let Elsie display hers first. I\r\nfeel in a special hurry, dear, to show your aunt those elegant silks\r\nyour papa and I helped you to select. I hope you will see them all on\r\nher, one of these days, Adelaide.\r\n\r\n"That child\'s complexion is so perfect, that she can wear anything,"\r\nshe added in an aside, as they followed Elsie to her apartments;\r\n"there\'s a pale blue that she looks perfectly lovely in; a pearl-color\r\ntoo, and a delicate pink, and I don\'t know how many more. One might\r\nthink we expected her to do nothing but attend parties the coming\r\nseason."\r\n\r\nElsie seemed to take a lively interest in displaying her pretty things\r\nto her aunt, and in looking on for a little, while Rose did the same\r\nwith hers; but at length, though the two older ladies were still\r\nturning over and discussing silks, satins, velvets, laces, ribbons,\r\nfeathers, and flowers, her father noticed her sitting in the corner of\r\na sofa, in an attitude of weariness and dejection, with a pale cheek,\r\nand a dreary, far-off look in her eyes that it pained him to see.\r\n\r\n"You are very tired, daughter," he said, going to her side, and\r\nsmoothing her glossy brown hair with tender caressing motion, as he\r\nspoke; "go and lie down for an hour or two. A nap would do you a great\r\ndeal of good."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to do so while Aunt Adie is here, papa," she said,\r\nlooking up at him with a smile, and trying to seem fresh and bright.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that; you can see her any day now. Come, you must take a\r\nrest." And drawing her hand within his arm, he led her to her boudoir\r\nand left her there, comfortably established upon a sofa.\r\n\r\n"A hat trimmed in that style would be becoming to Elsie," remarked\r\nAdelaide, continuing the conversation with Rose, and turning to look\r\nat her niece as she spoke. "Why, she\'s not here."\r\n\r\n"Papa took her away to make her lie down," said little Horace.\r\n\r\n"Rose, does anything ail the child?" asked Adelaide, in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"She does not seem to be out of health; but you know we are very\r\ncareful of her; she is so dear and sweet, and has never looked very\r\nstrong."\r\n\r\n"But there is something wrong with her, is there not? she does not\r\nseem to me quite the gay, careless child she was when you went away.\r\nHorace," and she turned to him, as he re-entered the room, "may I not\r\nknow about Elsie? You can hardly love her very much better than I do,\r\nI think."\r\n\r\n"If that is so, you must love her very much indeed," he answered with\r\na faint smile. "Yes, I will tell you." And he explained the matter;\r\nbriefly at first, then more in detail, as she drew him on by questions\r\nand remarks.\r\n\r\nHer sympathy for Elsie was deep and sincere; yet she thought her\r\nbrother\'s course the only wise and kind one, and her indignation waxed\r\nhot against Arthur and Egerton.\r\n\r\n"And Elsie still believes in the scoundrel?" she said inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, her loving, trustful nature refuses to credit the proofs of\r\nhis guilt, and only her sweet, conscientious submission to parental\r\nauthority has saved her from becoming his victim."\r\n\r\n"She is a very good, submissive, obedient child to you, Horace."\r\n\r\n"I could not ask a better, Adelaide. I only wish it were in my power\r\nto make obedience always easy and pleasant to her, poor darling."\r\n\r\n"I hope you have something for me there, my dear," Rose remarked to\r\nher husband at the breakfast-table the next morning, as he looked over\r\nthe mail just brought in by his man John.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is one for you; from your mother, I think; and, Elsie, do\r\nyou know the handwriting of this?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, it is quite strange to me," she answered, taking the letter\r\nhe held out to her, and which bore her name and address on the back,\r\nand examining it critically.\r\n\r\n"And the post-mark tells you nothing either?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I cannot quite make it out, but it doesn\'t seem to be any\r\nplace where I have a correspondent."\r\n\r\n"Well, open it and see from whom it comes. But finish your breakfast\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\nElsie laid the letter down by her plate, and putting aside, for the\r\npresent, her curiosity in regard to it, went on with her meal. "From\r\nwhom can it have come?" she asked herself, while listening half\r\nabsently to extracts from Mr. Allison\'s epistle; "not from him surely,\r\nthe hand is so very unlike that of the one he sent me in Lansdale."\r\n\r\n"You have not looked at that yet," her father said, seeing her take it\r\nup as they rose from the table. "You may do so now. I wish to know who\r\nthe writer is. Don\'t read it till you have found that out," he added,\r\nleading her to a sofa in the next room, and making her sit down there,\r\nwhile he stood by her side.\r\n\r\nShe felt that his eye was upon her as she broke open the envelope and,\r\ntaking the letter from it, glanced down the page, then in a little\r\nflutter of surprise and perplexity turned to the signature. Instantly\r\nher face flushed crimson, she trembled visibly, and her eyes were\r\nlifted pleadingly to his.\r\n\r\nHe frowned and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, let me read it!" she murmured low and tremulously, her eyes\r\nstill pleading more eloquently than her tongue.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, and his look and gesture were imperative.\r\n\r\nShe silently put the letter into his hand, and turned away with a low\r\nsob.\r\n\r\n"It is not worth one tear, or even an emotion of regret, my child," he\r\nsaid, sitting down beside her. "I shall send it back at once; unread,\r\nunless you prefer to have me read it first."\r\n\r\n"No, papa."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then I shall not. But, Elsie, do you not see now that he\r\nis quite capable of imitating the handwriting of another?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; but that does not prove that he did in the case you refer\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"And he has acted quite fairly and honestly in using that talent to\r\nelude my vigilance and tempt you to deception and disobedience, eh?"\r\n\r\n"He is not perfect, papa, but I can\'t believe him as bad as you\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"There are none so blind as those that won\'t see, Elsie; but,\r\nremember"--and his tone changed from one of great vexation to another\r\nsternly authoritative--"I will be obeyed in this thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she said, and rising, hastily left the room.\r\n\r\n"Try to be very patient with her, dear," said Rose, who had been a\r\nsilent, but deeply interested spectator of the little scene; "she\r\nsuffers enough, poor child!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know it, and my heart bleeds for her; yet she seems so\r\nwilfully blind to the strongest proofs of the fellow\'s abominable\r\nrascality that at times I feel as if I could hardly put up with it\r\nat all. The very pain of seeing her suffer so makes me out of all\r\npatience with her folly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand it, but do not be stern with her; she surely does\r\nnot deserve it while she is so perfectly submissive to your will."\r\n\r\n"No, she does not, poor darling," he said with a sigh. "But I must\r\nmake haste to write some letters that ought to go by the next mail."\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and Mrs. Dinsmore, longing to comfort Elsie in her\r\ntrouble, was about to go in search of her, when Mrs. Murray, who was\r\nstill housekeeper at the Oaks, came to ask advice or direction about\r\nsome household matters.\r\n\r\nTheir consultation lasted for half an hour or more, and in the\r\nmeanwhile Mr. Dinsmore finished his correspondence and went himself to\r\nlook for his daughter. She was in the act of opening her writing-desk\r\nas he entered the room.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing, daughter?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I was about to write a letter to Sophy, papa."\r\n\r\n"It would be too late for to-day\'s mail; so let it wait, and come with\r\nme for a little stroll into the grounds. Aunt Chloe, bring a garden\r\nhat and sunshade. You would like to go, daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Papa, you are not vexed with me? You don\'t think I want to\r\nbe disobedient or wilful?" There were tears in her voice and traces of\r\nthem on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"No, darling!" he said, drawing her to him, "and you did not in the\r\nleast deserve to be spoken to in the stern tone that I used. But--can\r\nyou understand it?--my very love for you makes me angry and impatient\r\nat your persistent love for that scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"Papa, please don\'t!" she said in a low, pained tone, and turning away\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you do not like to hear a word against him!" he sighed; "I can\'t\r\nbear to think it, and yet I fear you care more for him than for me,\r\nyour own father, who almost idolizes you. Is it so?"\r\n\r\n"Papa," she murmured, winding her arms about his neck, and laying\r\nher head on his breast, "if I may have but one of you, I could never\r\nhesitate for a moment to choose to cling here where I have been so\r\nlong and tenderly cherished. I know what your love is,--I might be\r\nmistaken and deceived in another. And besides, God commands me to\r\nhonor and obey you."\r\n\r\nHe held her close to his heart for a moment, as something too dear and\r\nprecious ever to be given up to another, then drawing her hand within\r\nhis arm, while Chloe placed the hat on her head, and gave her the\r\nparasol, he led her out into the grounds.\r\n\r\nIt pained him to notice the sadness of her countenance, sadder than he\r\nhad seen it for many days, and he exerted himself to entertain her\r\nand divert her thoughts, calling her attention to some new plants and\r\nflowers, consulting her taste in regard to improvements he designed\r\nmaking, and conversing with her about a book they had been reading.\r\n\r\nShe understood his thoughtful kindness, was grateful for it, and did\r\nher best to be interested and cheerful.\r\n\r\n"It is so nice to have you treat me as your companion and friend as\r\nwell as your daughter, papa," she said, looking up at him with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Your companionship is very dear and sweet to me, daughter," he\r\nanswered. "But I think we had better go in now; the sun is growing\r\nhot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, here you are!" cried a girlish voice as they turned into a shaded\r\nwalk leading to the house. "I\'ve been looking everywhere and am\r\nglad to have found you at last. Really, if a body didn\'t know your\r\nrelationship, he or she might almost imagine you a pair of lovers."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be silly, Enna. How do you do?" said Mr. Dinsmore, shaking\r\nhands with her and giving her a brotherly kiss.\r\n\r\n"As usual, thank you," she answered, turning from him to Elsie, whom\r\nshe embraced with tolerable warmth, saying, "I\'m really glad to have\r\nyou here again. I missed you more than I would have believed. Now come\r\nin and show me all your pretty things. I\'m dying to see them. Adelaide\r\nsays you\'ve brought home such quantities of lovely laces, silks,\r\nvelvets, ribbons, flowers, feathers and what not, that one might\r\nimagine you\'d nearly bought out the Philadelphia merchants."\r\n\r\n"No, they had quite a stock still left," replied Elsie, smiling; "but,\r\nas mamma says, papa was very indulgent and liberal to us both; and I\r\nshall take pleasure in showing you his gifts."\r\n\r\n"How do you like my present to Adelaide? asked Mr. Dinsmore.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very much; but when my turn comes please remember I want\r\namethysts."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then I have been fortunate in my selection," he said, quite\r\nunsuspicious of the fact that Enna had instructed Elsie beforehand in\r\nregard to her wishes, should Horace intend making her a present. Elsie\r\nhad quietly given the desired hint, but merely as though the idea had\r\noriginated with herself.\r\n\r\nThe jewelry was highly approved, as also a rich violet silk from Rose,\r\nand a lace set from Elsie.\r\n\r\nAdelaide had been intrusted with quite as rich gifts for her father\r\nand mother; nor had Lora been forgotten; Elsie had a handsome shawl\r\nfor her, Mr. Dinsmore a beautiful pair of bracelets, and Rose a costly\r\nvolume of engravings.\r\n\r\n"Do you think Aunt Lora will be pleased?" asked Elsie.\r\n\r\n"They\'re splendid! It must be mighty nice to have so much money to\r\nspend. But come now, show me what you got for yourselves."\r\n\r\nShe spent a long while, first in Rose\'s apartment, then in Elsie\'s,\r\nturning over and admiring the pretty things, discussing patterns, and\r\nstyles of trimming, and what colors and modes would be becoming to\r\nher, trying on some of the dresses, laces, sacques, shawls, bonnets,\r\nand hats--without so much as saying by your leave, when the article in\r\nquestion belonged to her niece--that she might judge of the effect;\r\nseveral times repeating her remark that it must be delightful to have\r\nso much money, and that Elsie was exceedingly fortunate in being so\r\nenormously wealthy.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is something to be thankful for," Elsie said at length, "but,\r\nEnna, it is also a great responsibility. We are only stewards, you\r\nknow, and sometimes I fear it is hardly right for me to spend so much\r\nin personal adornment."\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t trouble me in the least; but why do you do it, if you\r\nare afraid it\'s wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Papa does not think so; he says the manufacturers of these rich goods\r\nmust live as well as others, and that for one with my income, it is no\r\nmore extravagant to wear them than for one with half the means to wear\r\ngoods only half as expensive."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure he\'s perfectly right; and of course you have no choice\r\nbut to obey. Well, I presume I\'ve seen everything now, and I\'m\r\nactually weary with my labors," she added, throwing herself into an\r\neasy-chair. "You\'ve grown a little pale, I think, and your eyes look\r\nas if you\'d been crying. What ails you?"\r\n\r\n"I am not at all ill," returned Elsie, flushing.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say you were, but something\'s wrong with you, and you can\'t\r\ndeny it; you don\'t seem as gay as you used to before you went away."\r\n\r\nShe paused, but receiving no reply, went on. "Come now, it isn\'t worth\r\nwhile to be so close-mouthed with me, Miss Dinsmore; for I happen to\r\nknow pretty much all about it already. You\'ve fallen in love with a\r\nman that your father thinks is a scamp and though you don\'t believe\r\nit, you\'ve given him up, in obedience to orders, like the cowardly\r\npiece that you are. Dear me, before I\'d be so afraid of my father!"\r\n\r\n"No, you neither fear nor love your father as I do mine; but fear of\r\npapa has very little to do with it. I love him far too well to refuse\r\nto submit to him in this, and I fear God, who bids me obey and honor\r\nhim. But, Enna, how did you learn all this?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is my secret."\r\n\r\nElsie looked disturbed. "Won\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"Not I."\r\n\r\n"Is it generally known in the family?"\r\n\r\n"So far as I am aware, no one knows it but myself."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" thought Elsie, "I did not believe Aunt Adelaide or Walter would\r\ntell her; but I wonder how she did find it out."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t give up the man I loved for anybody," Enna went on in a\r\nsneering tone. "I say parents have no business to interfere in such\r\nmatters; and so I told papa quite plainly when he took it upon him\r\nto lecture me about receiving attentions from Dick Percival, and\r\nthreatened to forbid him the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Enna!"\r\n\r\n"You consider it wickedly disrespectful and rebellious no doubt, but\r\nI say I\'m no longer a child, and so the text, \'Children obey your\r\nparents\'--which I know is just on the end of your tongue--doesn\'t\r\napply to me."\r\n\r\n"The Bible doesn\'t say obey till you are of age, then do as you\r\nplease. You are not seventeen yet, and Isaac was twenty when he\r\nsubmitted to be bound and laid upon the altar."\r\n\r\n"Well, when I go to the altar, it shall be leaning on Dick\'s arm,"\r\nsaid Enna, laughing. "I don\'t care if he is wild; I like him, and\r\nintend to marry him too."\r\n\r\n"But are you not afraid?"\r\n\r\n"Afraid of what?"\r\n\r\n"That he will run through his property in a few years, and perhaps\r\nbecome an habitual drunkard and abusive to his wife."\r\n\r\n"I mean to risk it anyhow," returned Enna sharply, "so it is not worth\r\nwhile for my friends to waste their breath in lecturing me on the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Enna! you can\'t expect a blessing, if you persist in being so\r\nundutiful; I think it would be well for you if your father were more\r\nlike mine."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! I wouldn\'t be your father\'s daughter for anything."\r\n\r\n"And I am glad and thankful that I am."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  The human heart! \'tis a thing that lives\r\n  In the light of many a shrine;\r\n  And the gem of its own pure feelings gives\r\n  Too oft on brows that are false to shine;\r\n  It has many a cloud of care and woe\r\n  To shadow o\'er its springs,\r\n  And the One above alone may know\r\n  The changing tune of its thousand strings.\r\n\r\n  --MRS. L.P. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Horace Dinsmore were most anxious to promote Elsie\'s\r\nhappiness, and in order to that to win her to forgetfulness of her\r\nunworthy suitor. Being Christians they did not take her to the\r\nball-room, the Opera, or the theater (nor would she have consented\r\nto go had they proposed it), but they provided for her every sort of\r\nsuitable amusement within their reach. She was allowed to entertain as\r\nmuch company and to pay as many visits to neighbors and friends as she\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nBut a constant round of gayety was not to her taste; she loved quiet\r\nhome pleasures and intellectual pursuits far better. And of these also\r\nshe might take her fill, nor lack for sympathizing companionship; both\r\nparents, but especially her father, being of like mind with herself.\r\nThey enjoyed many a book together, and she chose to pursue several\r\nstudies with him.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the weeks and months glided away not unhappily, though at\r\ntimes she would be possessed with a restless longing for news from\r\nEgerton, and for the love that was denied her; then her eyes would\r\noccasionally meet her father\'s with the old wistful, pleading look\r\nthat he found so hard to resist.\r\n\r\nHe well understood their mute petition; yet it was one he could not\r\ngrant. But he would take her in his arms, and giving her the fondest,\r\ntenderest caresses, would say, in a moved tone, "My darling, don\'t\r\nlook at me in that way; it almost breaks my heart. Ah, if you could\r\nonly be satisfied with your father\'s love!"\r\n\r\n"I will try, papa," was her usual answer, "and oh, your love is very\r\nsweet and precious!"\r\n\r\nSuch a little scene, occurring one morning in Elsie\'s boudoir, was\r\ninterrupted by Chloe coming in to say that Miss Carrington had called\r\nto see her young mistress and was waiting in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Show her in here, mammy," Elsie said, disengaging herself from her\r\nfather\'s arms, and smoothing out her dress. "She used to come here in\r\nthe old times without waiting for an invitation."\r\n\r\nThe Carringtons had not been able quite to forgive the rejection of\r\nHerbert\'s suit, and since his death there had been a slight coolness\r\nbetween the two families, and the girls had seen much less of each\r\nother than in earlier days; their intercourse being confined to an\r\noccasional exchange of formal calls, except when they met at the\r\nhouse of some common acquaintance or friend. Still they were mutually\r\nattached, and of late had resumed much of their old warmth of manner\r\ntoward each other.\r\n\r\n"Ah, this seems like going back to the dear old times again," Lucy\r\nsaid when their greetings were over, and sending an admiring glance\r\nabout the luxuriously furnished apartment as she spoke. "I always\r\nthought this the most charming of rooms, Elsie, but how many lovely\r\nthings,--perfect gems of art,--you have added to it since I saw it\r\nlast."\r\n\r\n"Papa\'s gifts to his spoiled darling, most of them," answered Elsie,\r\nwith a loving look and smile directed to him.\r\n\r\n"Petted, but not spoiled," he said, returning the smile.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, I should think not," said Lucy. "Mamma says she is the\r\nmost perfectly obedient, affectionate daughter she ever saw, and I\r\ncan\'t tell you how often I have heard her wish I was more like her."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Elsie, "I think Mrs. Carrington has always looked at me\r\nthrough rose-colored spectacles."\r\n\r\nAfter a little more chat Lucy told her errand. Her parents and\r\nherself, indeed the whole family, she said, had greatly regretted the\r\nfalling off of their former intimacy and strongly desired to renew it;\r\nand she had come to beg Elsie to go home with her and spend a week at\r\nAshlands in the old familiar way.\r\n\r\nElsie\'s eye brightened, and her cheek flushed. "Dear Lucy, how kind!"\r\nshe exclaimed; then turned inquiringly to her father.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is very kind," he said. "Use your own pleasure, daughter. I\r\nthink perhaps the change might do you good."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, papa, then I shall go. Lucy, I accept your invitation with\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\nThey were soon on their way, cantering briskly along side by side,\r\nLucy in gay, almost wild spirits, and Elsie\'s depression rapidly\r\nvanishing beneath the combined influence of the bracing air and\r\nexercise, the brilliant sunshine, and her friend\'s lively sallies.\r\n\r\nArrived at Ashlands, she found herself received and welcomed with all\r\nthe old warmth of affection. Mrs. Carrington folded her to her heart\r\nand wept over her. "My poor boy!" she whispered; "it seems almost to\r\nbring him back again to have you with us once more. But I will not\r\nmourn," she added, wiping her eyes; "for our loss has been his great\r\ngain."\r\n\r\nTender memories of Herbert, associated with nearly every room in the\r\nhouse, saddened and subdued Elsie\'s spirit for a time, yet helped to\r\nbanish thoughts of Egerton from her mind.\r\n\r\nBut Lucy had a great deal to tell her, and in listening to these\r\ngirlish confidences, Herbert was again half forgotten. Lucy too had\r\nspent the past summer in the North, and had there "met her fate." She\r\nwas engaged, the course of true love seemed to be running smoothly,\r\nand they expected to marry in a year.\r\n\r\nElsie listened with interest, sympathizing warmly in her friend\'s\r\nhappiness; but Lucy, who was watching her keenly, noticed a shade of\r\ndeep sadness steal over her face.\r\n\r\n"Now I have told you all my secrets," she said, "won\'t you treat me as\r\ngenerously, by trusting me with yours?"\r\n\r\n"If I had as happy a tale to tell," replied Elsie, the tears filling\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"You poor dear, what is wrong? Is it that papa refuses his consent."\r\n\r\nElsie nodded; her heart was too full for speech.\r\n\r\n"What a shame!" cried Lucy. "Does he really mean to keep you single\r\nall your life? is he quite determined to make an old maid of you?"\r\n\r\n"No, oh, no! but he does not believe my friend to be a good man. There\r\nseems to be some sad mistake, and I cannot blame papa; because if Mr.\r\nEgerton really was what he thinks him, it would be folly and sin for\r\nme to have anything to do with him; and indeed I could not give either\r\nhand or heart to one so vile,--a profane swearer, gambler, drunkard,\r\nand rake."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my, no!" and Lucy looked quite horrified; "but you don\'t believe\r\nhim such a villain?"\r\n\r\n"No; on the contrary I think him a truly converted man. I believe\r\nhe was a little wild at one time; for he told me he had been; but I\r\nbelieve, too, that he has truly repented, and therefore ought to be\r\nforgiven."\r\n\r\n"Then I wouldn\'t give him up if I were you, father or no father,"\r\nremarked Lucy, with spirit.\r\n\r\n"But, Lucy, there is the command, \'Children, obey your parents.\'"\r\n\r\n"But you are not a child."\r\n\r\n"Hardly more, not of age for more than two years."\r\n\r\n"Well, when you are of age, surely you will consider a lover\'s claims\r\nbefore those of a father."\r\n\r\n"No," Elsie answered low and sadly. "I shall never marry without\r\npapa\'s consent. I love him far too dearly to grieve him so; and it\r\nwould be running too fearful a risk."\r\n\r\n"Then you have resigned your lover entirely?"\r\n\r\n"Unless he can some day succeed in convincing papa that he is not so\r\nunworthy."\r\n\r\n"Well, you are a model of filial piety! and deserve to be happy, and I\r\nam ever so sorry for you," cried Lucy, clasping her in her arms, and\r\nkissing her affectionately.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, dear," Elsie said, "but oh, I cannot bear to have my\r\nfather blamed. Believing as he does, how could he do otherwise than\r\nforbid all intercourse between us? And he is so very, very kind, so\r\ntenderly affectionate to me. Ah, I could never do without his dear\r\nlove!"\r\n\r\nAfter this, the two had frequent talks together on the same subject,\r\nand though Lucy did not find any fault with Mr. Dinsmore, she yet\r\npleaded Egerton\'s cause, urging that it seemed very unfair in Elsie\r\nto condemn him unheard, very hard not to allow him even so much as a\r\nparting word.\r\n\r\n"I had no choice," Elsie said again and again, in a voice full of\r\ntears; "it was papa\'s command, and I could do nothing but obey. Oh,\r\nLucy, it was very, very hard for me, too! and yet my father was\r\ndoing only his duty, if his judgment of Mr. Egerton\'s character was\r\ncorrect."\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when Elsie had been at Ashlands four or five days, Lucy\r\ncame flying into her room; "Oh, I\'m so glad to find you dressed! You\r\nsee I\'m in the midst of my toilet, and Scip has just brought up word\r\nthat a gentleman is in the parlor asking for the young ladies--Miss\r\nDinsmore and Miss Carrington. Would you mind going down alone and\r\nentertaining him till I come? do, there\'s a dear."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Scip didn\'t seem to have quite understood the name; but it must be\r\nsome one we both know, and if you don\'t mind going, it would be a\r\nrelief to my nerves to know that he\'s not sitting there with nothing\r\nto do but count the minutes, and think, \'What an immense time it takes\r\nMiss Carrington to dress. She must be very anxious to make a good\r\nimpression upon me.\' For you see men are so conceited, they are always\r\nimagining we\'re laying ourselves out to secure their admiration."\r\n\r\n"I will go down then," Elsie answered, smiling, "and do what I can to\r\nkeep him from thinking any such unworthy thoughts of you. But please\r\nfollow me as soon as you can."\r\n\r\nThe caller had the drawing-room to himself, and as Elsie entered was\r\nstanding at the centre-table with his back toward her. As she drew\r\nnear, he turned abruptly, caught her hand in his, threw his arm about\r\nher waist, and kissed her passionately, crying in a low tone of\r\nrapturous delight, "My darling, I have you at last! Oh, how I have\r\nsuffered from this cruel separation."\r\n\r\nIt was Egerton, and for a few moments she forgot everything else, in\r\nher glad surprise at the unexpected meeting.\r\n\r\nHe drew her to a sofa, and still keeping his arm about her, poured out\r\na torrent of fond loverlike words, mingled with tender reproaches that\r\nshe had given him up so easily, and protestations of his innocence of\r\nthe vices and crimes laid to his charge.\r\n\r\nAt first Elsie flushed rosy red, and a sweet light of love and joy\r\nshone in the soft eyes, half veiled by their heavy, drooping lashes;\r\nbut as he went on her cheek grew deathly pale, and she struggled to\r\nfree herself from his embrace.\r\n\r\n"Let me go!" she cried, in an agitated tone of earnest entreaty, "I\r\nmust, indeed I must! I can\'t stay--I ought not; I should not have come\r\nin, or allowed you to speak to, or touch me. Papa has forbidden all\r\nintercourse between us, and he will be so angry." And she burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t go back to him; stay with me, and give me a right to\r\nprotect you from his anger. I can\'t bear to see you weep, and if you\r\nwill be mine--my own little wife, you shall never have cause to shed\r\nanother tear," he said, drawing her closer to him and kissing them\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I cannot, I cannot! You must let me go; indeed you must!"\r\nshe cried, shrinking from the touch of his lip upon her cheek, and\r\naverting her face, "I am doing wrong, very wrong to stay, here!"\r\n\r\n"No, I shall hold you fast for a few blissful moments at least;" he\r\nanswered, tightening his grasp and repeating his caresses, as she\r\nstruggled the harder to be free. "You cannot be so cruel as to refuse\r\nto hear my defence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I cannot stay another moment--I must not hear another word, for\r\nevery instant that I linger I am guilty of a fresh act of disobedience\r\nto papa. I shall be compelled to call for help it you do not loose\r\nyour hold."\r\n\r\nHe took his arm from her waist, but still held fast to her hand. "No,\r\ndon\'t do that," he said; "think what a talk it would make. I shall\r\ndetain you but a moment, and surely you may as well stay that much\r\nlonger; \'in for a penny, in for a pound,\' you know. Oh, Elsie, can\'t\r\nyou give me a little hope."\r\n\r\n"If you can gain papa\'s approval, not otherwise."\r\n\r\n"But when you come of age."\r\n\r\n"I shall never marry without my father\'s consent."\r\n\r\n"Surely you carry your ideas of obedience too far. You owe a duty to\r\nyourself and to me, as well as to your father. Excuse my plainness,\r\nbut in the course of nature we shall both outlive him, and is it\r\nright to sacrifice the happiness of our two lives because he has\r\nunfortunately imbibed a prejudice against me?"\r\n\r\n"I could expect no blessing upon a union entered into in direct\r\nopposition to my father\'s wishes and commands," she answered with sad\r\nand gentle firmness.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a hard kind of obedience; and I don\'t think it would answer to\r\nput in practice in all cases," he said bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; I do not attempt to decide for others; but I am\r\nconvinced of my own duty; and know too that I should be wretched\r\nindeed, if I had to live under papa\'s frown. And oh, how I am\r\ndisobeying him now! I must go this instant! Release my hand, Mr.\r\nEgerton." And she tried with all her strength to wrench it free.\r\n\r\n"No, no, not yet," he said entreatingly. "I have not given you half\r\nthe proofs of my innocence that I can bring forward; do me the simple\r\njustice to stay and hear them."\r\n\r\nShe made no reply but half yielded, ceasing her struggles for a\r\nmoment. She had no strength to free her hand from his grasp, and could\r\nnot bear to call others upon the scene. Trembling with agitation and\r\neagerness, she waited for his promised proofs; but instead he only\r\npoured forth a continuous stream of protestations, expostulations and\r\nentreaties.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Egerton, I must, I must go," she repeated; "this is nothing to\r\nthe purpose, and I cannot stay to hear it."\r\n\r\nA step was heard approaching; he hastily drew her toward him, touched\r\nhis lips again to her cheek, released her, and she darted from the\r\nroom by one door, as Lucy entered by another.\r\n\r\n"Where is she? gone? what\'s the matter? wasn\'t she pleased to see you?\r\nwouldn\'t she stay?"\r\n\r\nLucy looked into the disappointed, angry, chagrined face of Egerton,\r\nand in her surprise and vexation piled question upon question without\r\ngiving him time to answer.\r\n\r\n"No, the girl\'s a fool!" he muttered angrily, and turning hastily from\r\nher, paced rapidly to and fro for a moment; then suddenly recollecting\r\nhimself, "I beg pardon, Miss Carrington," he said, coming back to\r\nthe sofa on which she sat regarding him with a perturbed, displeased\r\ncountenance, "I--I forgot myself; but you will perhaps, know how to\r\nexcuse an almost distracted lover."\r\n\r\n"Really, sir," returned Lucy coolly, "your words just now did not\r\nsound very lover-like; and would rather lead one to suspect that\r\npossibly Mr. Dinsmore may be in the right."\r\n\r\nHe flushed hotly. "What can you mean, Miss Carrington?"\r\n\r\n"That your love is for her fortune rather than for herself."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you wrong me. I adore Miss Dinsmore, and would consider myself\r\nthe happiest of mortals could I but secure her hand, even though she\r\ncame to me penniless. But she has imbibed the most absurd, ridiculous\r\nideas of filial duty and refuses to give me the smallest encouragement\r\nunless I can gain her father\'s consent and approval; which, seeing he\r\nhas conceived a violent dislike to me, is a hopeless thing. Now\r\ncan you not realize that the more ardent my love for her, the more\r\nfrantically impatient I would feel under such treatment?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so; men are so different from women; but nothing could ever\r\nmake me apply such an epithet to the man I loved."\r\n\r\n"Distracted with disappointed hopes, I was hardly a sane man at the\r\nmoment, Miss Carrington," he said deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"The coveted interview has proved entirely unsatisfactory then?" she\r\nsaid in a tone of inquiry.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and yet I am most thankful to have had sight and speech of her\r\nonce more; truly grateful to you for bringing it about so cleverly.\r\nBut--oh, Miss Carrington, could you be persuaded to assist me still\r\nfurther, you would lay me under lasting obligations!"\r\n\r\n"Please explain yourself, sir," she answered coldly, moving farther\r\nfrom him, as he attempted to take her hand.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," he said. "I am not one inclined to take liberties with\r\nladies; but I am hardly myself to-day; my overpowering emotion--my\r\nhalf distracted state of mind--"\r\n\r\nBreaking off his sentence abruptly, and putting his hand to his head,\r\n"I believe I shall go mad if I have to resign all hope of winning the\r\nsweet, lovely Elsie," he exclaimed excitedly, "and I see only one way\r\nof doing it. If I could carry her off, and get her quite out of her\r\nfather\'s reach, so that no fear of him need deter her from following\r\nthe promptings of her own heart, I am sure I could induce her to\r\nconsent to marry me at once. Miss Carrington, will you help me?"\r\n\r\n"Never! If Elsie chooses to run away with you, and wants any\r\nassistance from me, she shall have it; but I will have nothing to do\r\nwith kidnapping."\r\n\r\nHe urged, entreated, used every argument he could think of, but with\r\nno other effect than rousing Lucy\'s anger and indignation; "underhand\r\ndealings were not in her line," she told him, and finally--upon his\r\nintimating that what she had already done might be thought to come\r\nunder that head--almost ordered him out of the house.\r\n\r\nHe went, and hurrying to her friend\'s room, she found her walking\r\nabout it in a state of great agitation, and weeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lucy, how could you? how could you?" she cried, wringing her\r\nhands and sobbing in pitiable distress. "I had no thought of him when\r\nI went down; I did not know you knew him, or that he was in this part\r\nof the country at all. I was completely taken by surprise, and have\r\ndisobeyed papa\'s most express commands, and he will never forgive me,\r\nnever! No, not that either, but he will be very, very angry. Oh, what\r\nshall I do!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Elsie, dear, don\'t be so troubled! I am as sorry as I can be,"\r\nsaid Lucy, with tears in her eyes. "I meant to do you a kindness;\r\nindeed I did; I thought it would be a joyful surprise to you.\r\n\r\n"I met him last summer at Saratoga. He came there immediately from\r\nLansdale, and somehow we found out directly that we both knew you, and\r\nthat I was a near neighbor and very old friend of yours; and he told\r\nme the whole story of your love-affair, and quite enlisted me in his\r\ncause; he seemed so depressed and melancholy at your loss, and grieved\r\nso over the hasty way in which your father had separated you,--not\r\neven allowing a word of farewell.\r\n\r\n"He told me he hoped and believed you were still faithful to him in\r\nyour heart, but he could not get to see or speak to you, or hold any\r\ncorrespondence with you. And so I arranged this way of bringing you\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"It was kindly meant, I have no doubt, Lucy, but oh, you don\'t know\r\nwhat you have done! I tremble at the very thought of papa\'s anger when\r\nhe hears it; for I have done and permitted things he said he would not\r\nallow for thousands of dollars."\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, I don\'t think you could help it; and I\'m so sorry for my\r\nshare in it," said Lucy, putting her arms round her, and kissing her\r\nwet cheek. "But perhaps your father will not be so very angry with\r\nyou after all; and at any rate you are too old to be whipped, so a\r\nscolding will be the worst you will be likely to get."\r\n\r\n"He never did whip me, never struck me a blow in his life; but I would\r\nprefer the pain of a dozen whippings to what I expect," said Elsie,\r\nwith a fresh burst of tears.\r\n\r\n"What is that, you poor dear?" asked Lucy. "I can\'t imagine what he\r\ncould do worse than beat you."\r\n\r\n"He may put me away from his arms for weeks or months, and be cold,\r\nand stern, and distant to me, never giving me a caress or even so much\r\nas a kind word or look. Oh, if he should do that, how can I bear it!"\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t tell him anything about it. I wouldn\'t, and I don\'t see\r\nany reason why you should."\r\n\r\nElsie shook her head sorrowfully. "I must; I never conceal\r\nanything--any secret of my own--from him; and I should feel like a\r\nguilty thing, acting a lie, and could not look him in the face; and he\r\nwould know from my very look and manner that something was wrong, and\r\nwould question me, and make me tell him all. Lucy, I must go home at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, you must not. Why, you were to stay a week--two days\r\nlonger than this; and if you were ready to start this minute, it would\r\nbe quite dark before you could possibly reach the Oaks."\r\n\r\nElsie looked at her watch, and perceiving that her friend was right,\r\ngave up the idea of going that day, but said she must leave the next\r\nmorning. To that Lucy again objected. "I can\'t bear to lose those two\r\ndays of your promised visit," she said, "for if you are determined to\r\ntell your papa all about this, there\'s no knowing when he will allow\r\nyou to come here again."\r\n\r\n"Never, I fear," sighed Elsie.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been able to help feeling a little hard to him on poor\r\nHerbert\'s account," Lucy went on, "and I believe that had something\r\nto do with my readiness to help Egerton to outwit him in obtaining an\r\ninterview with you. But I\'ll never do anything of the kind again; so\r\nhe needn\'t be afraid to let you come to see us."\r\n\r\nShe then told Elsie what had passed in the drawing-room between\r\nEgerton and herself--his request and her indignant refusal.\r\n\r\nIt helped to shake Elsie\'s confidence in the man, and made her still\r\nmore remorseful in view of that day\'s disobedience; for she could\r\nnot deceive herself into the belief that she had been altogether\r\nblameless. "As I said before, I can\'t bear the idea of losing you so\r\nsoon," continued Lucy, "but there is still another reason why I must\r\nbeg of you to stay till the set time of your leaving. Mamma knows\r\nnothing about this affair, and would be exceedingly displeased with\r\nme, if she should find it out; as of course she must, if you go\r\nto-morrow; as that would naturally call out an explanation. So, dear,\r\ndo promise me that you will give up the idea."\r\n\r\nElsie hesitated, but not liking to bring Lucy into trouble, finally\r\nyielded to her urgent entreaties, and consented to stay.\r\n\r\nAll the enjoyment of her visit, however, was over; she felt it\r\nimpossible to rest till her father knew all, shed many tears in\r\nsecret, and had much ado to conceal the traces of them, and appear\r\ncheerful in the presence of the family.\r\n\r\nBut the two wretched days were over at last, and declining the urgent\r\ninvitations of her friends to linger with them a little longer, she\r\nbade them an affectionate farewell, and set out for home.\r\n\r\nJim had been sent to escort her, another servant with the wagon for\r\nChloe and the luggage. Struck with a sudden fear that she might meet\r\nor be overtaken by Egerton, Elsie ordered Jim to keep up close in the\r\nrear, then touching the whip to her horse, started off at a brisk\r\ncanter. Her thoughts were full of the coming interview with her\r\nfather, which she dreaded exceedingly, while at the same time she\r\nlonged to have it over. She drew rein at the great gates leading into\r\nthe grounds, and the servant dismounted and opened them.\r\n\r\n"Jim," she asked, "is your master at home?"\r\n\r\n"Dunno, Miss Elsie, but the missus am gone ober to Ion to spend the\r\nday, an lef\' little Marse Horace at Roselands."\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the matter, Jim?"\r\n\r\n"De missus at Ion little bit sick, I b\'lieve, Miss Elsie."\r\n\r\n"And papa didn\'t go with them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss; but he comed right back again, and I \'spect he\'s in de\r\nhouse now."\r\n\r\n"Dear papa! he came back to receive me," murmured Elsie to herself, as\r\nshe rode on, and a scalding tear fell at the thought of how the loving\r\nlook and fond caress with which he was sure to greet her, would be\r\nquickly exchanged for dark frowns, and stern, cold reproofs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I were a child again, I believe I should hope he would just\r\nwhip me at once, and then forgive me, and it would be all over; but\r\nnow--oh, dear! how long will his displeasure last?"\r\n\r\nIt was just as she had expected; he was on the veranda, watching for\r\nher coming--hastened forward, assisted her to alight, embraced her\r\ntenderly, then pushing aside her veil, looked searchingly into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" he asked, as her eyes met his for an instant\r\nwith a beseeching, imploring glance, then fell beneath his gaze while\r\nher face flushed crimson.\r\n\r\nShe tried to answer him, but her tongue refused to do its office,\r\nthere was a choking sensation in her throat and her lips quivered.\r\n\r\nHe led her into his private study, took off her hat and threw it\r\naside, and seating her on a sofa, still keeping his arm about her--for\r\nshe was trembling very much--asked again, "What is the matter? what\r\nhas gone wrong with you, my daughter?"\r\n\r\nHis tone, his look, his manner were very gentle and tender; but that\r\nonly increased her remorse and self-reproach.\r\n\r\n"Papa, don\'t be so kind," she faltered; "I--I don\'t deserve it, for I\r\nhave--disobeyed you."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible! when? where? and how? Can it be that you have seen\r\nand spoken with that--scoundrel, Elsie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa." Her voice was very low and tremulous, her heart throbbed\r\nalmost to suffocation, her bosom heaved tumultuously, and her color\r\ncame and went with every breath.\r\n\r\nHe rose and paced hurriedly across the room two or three times,\r\nthen coming back to her side, "Tell me all about it," he said\r\nsternly--"every action, every word spoken by either, as far as you can\r\nrecall it."\r\n\r\nShe obeyed in the same low, tremulous tones in which she had answered\r\nhim before, her voice now and then broken by a half-smothered sob, and\r\nher eyes never once meeting his, which she felt were fixed so severely\r\nupon her tearful, downcast face.\r\n\r\nHe cross-questioned her till he knew all that had passed nearly as\r\nwell as if he had been present through the whole interview, his tones\r\ngrowing more and more stern and angry.\r\n\r\n"And you dared to permit all that, Elsie?" he exclaimed when she had\r\nfinished; "to allow that vile wretch to put his arm around you, hold\r\nyour hand in his, for half an hour probably, and even to press his\r\nlips again and again to yours or to your cheek; and that after I had\r\ntold you I would not have him take such a liberty with you for half I\r\nam worth; and--"\r\n\r\n"Not to my lips, papa."\r\n\r\n"Then it is not quite so bad as I thought, but bad enough certainly;\r\nand all this after I had positively forbidden you to even so much as\r\nexchange the slightest salutation with him. What am I to think of such\r\nhigh-handed rebellion?"\r\n\r\n"Papa," she said beseechingly, "is not that too hard a word? I did not\r\ndisobey deliberately--I don\'t think anything could have induced me to\r\ngo into that room knowing that he was there. I was taken by surprise,\r\nand when he had got hold of my hand I tried in vain to get it free."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t attempt to excuse yourself, Elsie. You could have escaped from\r\nhim at once, by simply raising your voice and calling for assistance.\r\nI do not believe it would have been impossible to avoid even that\r\nfirst embrace; and it fairly makes my blood boil to think he succeeded\r\nin giving it to you. How dared you so disobey me as to submit to it?"\r\n\r\n"Papa, at the moment I forgot everything but--but just that he was\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken in a voice scarcely raised above a whisper,\r\nwhile her head drooped lower and lower and her cheek grew hot with\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n"Did I ever take forgetfulness of my orders as any excuse of\r\ndisobedience?" he asked in as stern a tone as he had ever used to her.\r\n\r\n"No, papa; but oh, don\'t be very angry with me!"\r\n\r\n"I am exceedingly displeased with you, Elsie! so much so that nothing\r\nbut your sex saves you from a severe chastisement. And I cannot allow\r\nyou to escape punishment. You must be taught that though no longer a\r\nmere child, you are not yet old enough to disobey me with impunity.\r\nHush!" as she seemed about to speak, "I will not have a word of reply.\r\nGo to your own apartments and consider yourself confined to them till\r\nyou hear further from me. Stay!" he added as she rose to obey, "when\r\ndid all this occur?"\r\n\r\nShe told him in her low, tearful tones, her utterance half choked with\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n"Two days ago, and yet your confession has been delayed till now. Does\r\nthat look like penitence for your fault?"\r\n\r\nShe explained why she had not returned home at once; but he refused to\r\naccept the excuse, and ordered her away as sternly as before.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed in silence, controlling her feelings by a great effort,\r\nuntil she had gained the privacy of her own apartments, then giving\r\nway to a fit of almost hysterical weeping. It was years since her\r\nfather had been seriously displeased with her, and loving him with\r\nsuch intense affection, his anger and sternness nearly broke her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nHer tender conscience pricked her sorely too, adding greatly to her\r\ndistress by its reproaches on account of her disobedience and her\r\ndelay in confessing it.\r\n\r\nIt came to her mind at length that her heavenly Father might be more\r\ntender and forbearing with her, more ready to forgive and restore to\r\nfavor, than her earthly one. She remembered the sweet words, "There is\r\nforgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared." "If any man sin,\r\nwe have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." She\r\nwent to Him with her sin and sorrow, asking pardon for the past and\r\nhelp for the future. She asked, too, that the anger of her earthly\r\nparent might be turned away; that the Lord would dispose him to\r\nforgive and love her as before.\r\n\r\nShe rose from her knees with a heart, though still sad and sorrowful,\r\nyet lightened of more than half its load.\r\n\r\nBut the day was a very long one; with a mind so disturbed she could\r\nnot settle to any employment, or find amusement in anything. She\r\npassed the time in wandering restlessly from room to room, starting\r\nand trembling as now and then she thought she heard her father\'s step\r\nor voice, then weeping afresh as she found that he did not come near\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen the dinner-bell rang she hoped he would send, or come to her; but\r\ninstead he sent her meal to her; such an one as was usual upon their\r\ntable--both luxurious and abundant,--which comforted her with the hope\r\nthat he was less displeased with her than at other times when he had\r\nallowed her little more than prison fare. But excitement and mental\r\ndistress had brought on a severe headache; she had no appetite, and\r\nsent the food away almost untasted.\r\n\r\nIt was mild, beautiful weather in the early spring; such weather as\r\nmakes one feel it a trial to be compelled to stay within doors, and\r\nElsie longed for her favorite retreat in the grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon some ladies called; Mr. Dinsmore was out, and she\r\ndared not go to the drawing room without permission; but her headache\r\nfurnished sufficient excuse for declining to see them, and they went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nShortly after, she heard her father\'s return. He had not been off the\r\nestate, or out of sight of the house; he was keeping guard over her,\r\nbut still did not come near her.\r\n\r\nJust at tea-time she again heard the sound of wheels; then her\r\nfather\'s, mother\'s, and little brother\'s voices.\r\n\r\n"Mamma and Horace have come home," she thought with a longing desire\r\nto run out and embrace them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, has sister come home?" she heard the child\'s voice ask in\r\neager tones.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then I must run into her room and kiss her!"\r\n\r\n"No, you must not; stay here."\r\n\r\n"But why mustn\'t I go to sister, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Because I forbid it."\r\n\r\nEvery word of the short colloquy reached Elsie\'s ear, adding to her\r\ngrief and dismay. Was she, then, to be separated from all the rest of\r\nthe family? did her father fear that she would exert a bad influence\r\nover Horace, teaching him to be disobedient and wilful? How deeply\r\nhumbled and ashamed she felt at the thought.\r\n\r\nRose gave her husband a look of surprised, anxious inquiry. "Is Elsie\r\nsick, dear?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No, Rose, but she is in disgrace with me," he answered in an\r\nundertone, as he led the way into the house.\r\n\r\n"Horace, you astonish me! what can she have done to displease you?"\r\n\r\n"Come in here; and I will tell you," he said, throwing open the door\r\nof his study.\r\n\r\nRose listened in silence, while he repeated to her the substance of\r\nElsie\'s confession, mingled with expressions of his own anger and\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" murmured Rose, as he concluded; "Horace, don\'t be hard\r\nwith her; she must have suffered a great deal in these last three\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered in a moved tone; "when I think of that, I can\r\nscarcely refrain from going to her, taking her in my arms, and\r\nlavishing caresses and endearments upon her; but then comes the\r\nthought of her allowing that scoundrel to do the same, and I am ready\r\nalmost to whip her for it." His face flushed hotly, and his dark eyes\r\nflashed as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear!" exclaimed Rose, half frightened at his vehemence, "you\r\ncannot mean it?"\r\n\r\n"Rose," he said, pacing to and fro in increasing excitement, "the\r\nfellow is a vile wretch, whose very touch I esteem pollution to a\r\nsweet, fair, innocent young creature like my daughter. I told her so,\r\nand positively forbade her to so much as look at him, or permit him\r\nto see her face, if it could be avoided, or to recognize, or hold the\r\nslightest communication with him in any way. Yet in defiance of all\r\nthis, she allows him to take her hand and hold it for, I don\'t know\r\nhow long, put his arm around her waist and kiss her a number of times.\r\nNow what does such disobedience deserve?"\r\n\r\n"Had she no excuse to offer?"\r\n\r\n"Excuse? Yes, she did not disobey deliberately--was taken by\r\nsurprise--forgot everything but that he was there."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," and Rose\'s hand was laid affectionately on his arm,\r\nwhile a tender smile played about her mouth, and her sweet blue eyes\r\nlooked fondly into his. "You know how it is with lovers, if you will\r\nonly look back a very few years. I think there were times when you and\r\nI forgot that there was anybody in the wide world but just our two\r\nselves."\r\n\r\nA smile, a tender caress, a few very lover-like words, and resuming\r\nhis gravity and seriousness, Mr. Dinsmore went on: "But you forget\r\nthe odious character of the man. If I had objected to him from mere\r\nprejudice or whim, it would have been a very different thing."\r\n\r\n"But you know Elsie does not believe--"\r\n\r\n"She ought to believe what her father tells her," he interrupted\r\nhotly; "but believe or not, she must and shall obey me; and if she\r\ndoes not I shall punish her."\r\n\r\n"And to do that, you need only look coldly on her, and refrain from\r\ngiving her caresses and endearing words. Such treatment from her\r\ndearly loved father would of itself be sufficient, very soon, to crush\r\nher tender, sensitive spirit."\r\n\r\nHis face softened, the frown left his brow, and the angry fire his\r\neye. "My poor darling!" he murmured, with a sigh, his thoughts going\r\nback to a time of estrangement between them long years ago. "Yes,\r\nRose, you are right; she is a very tender, delicate, sensitive plant,\r\nand it behooves her father to be exceeding gentle and forbearing with\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Then you will forgive her, and take her to your heart again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--if she is penitent;--and tell her that she owes it to her\r\nmother\'s intercession; for I had intended to make her feel herself in\r\ndisgrace for days or weeks."\r\n\r\nChloe was at that moment carrying a large silver waiter, filled with\r\ndelicacies, into the apartments of her young mistress. "Now, darlin\',\r\ndo try to eat to please your ole mammy," she said coaxingly, as she\r\nset it down before her. "I\'se taken lots ob pains to fix up dese tings\r\ndat my pet chile so fond ob."\r\n\r\nElsie\'s only answer was a sad sort of smile; but for the sake of the\r\nloving heart that had prompted the careful preparation of the tempting\r\nmeal--the loving eyes that watched her as she ate, she tried to do her\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nOnly half satisfied with the result, Chloe bore the waiter away again,\r\nwhile Elsie seated herself in a large easy-chair that was drawn up\r\nclose to the glass doors opening upon the lawn and laying her head\r\nback upon its cushions, turned her eyes toward the outer world,\r\nlooking longingly upon the shaded alleys and gay parterres, the lawn\r\nwith its velvet carpet of emerald green, where a fountain cast up\r\nits cool showers of spray, and long shadows slept, alternating with\r\nbrilliant patches of ruddy light from the slowly sinking sun.\r\n\r\nShe sighed deeply, and her eyes filled with tears. "How long should\r\nshe be forbidden to wander there at her own sweet will?"\r\n\r\nA soft, cool hand was gently laid upon her aching brow, and looking\r\nup she saw her father standing by her side. She had not heard his\r\napproach, for his slippered feet made no noise in passing over the\r\nrich velvet carpet.\r\n\r\nHis face was grave, but no longer stern or angry. "Does your head\r\nache, daughter?" he asked almost tenderly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa; but not half so badly as my heart does," she answered,\r\na tear rolling quickly down her cheek. "I am so sorry for my\r\ndisobedience. Oh, papa, will you forgive me?" And her eyes sought\r\nhis with the imploring look he ever found it well-nigh impossible to\r\nresist.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will--I do," he said, stooping to press a kiss upon the\r\nquivering lips. "I had thought I ought to keep you in disgrace some\r\ntime longer, but your mamma has pleaded for you, and for her sake--and\r\nfor the sake of a time, long ago, when I caused my little girl much\r\nundeserved suffering," he added, his tones growing tremulous with\r\nemotion, "I forgive and receive you back into favor at once."\r\n\r\nShe threw her arm about his neck, and as he drew her to his breast,\r\nlaid her head down there, weeping tears of joy and thankfulness.\r\n"Dear, kind mamma! and you too, best and dearest of fathers! I don\'t\r\ndeserve it," she sobbed. "I am afraid I ought to be punished for such\r\ndisobedience."\r\n\r\n"I think you have been," he said pityingly, "the last three days can\r\nhardly have been very happy ones to you."\r\n\r\n"No, papa; very, very wretched."\r\n\r\n"My poor child! Ah, I must take better care of my precious one in\r\nfuture. I shall allow you to go nowhere without either your mother or\r\nmyself to guard and protect you. Also, I shall break off your intimacy\r\nwith Lucy Carrington; she is henceforth to be to you a mere speaking\r\nacquaintance; come, now we will take a little stroll through the\r\ngrounds. The cool air will, I hope, do your head good."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  \'Twas the doubt that thou wert false,\r\n  That wrung my heart with pain;\r\n  But now I know thy perfidy,\r\n  I shall be well again.\r\n\r\n  --BRYANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nElsie submitted without a murmur to her father\'s requirements and\r\nrestrictions; but though there was nothing else to remind her that she\r\nhad been for one sad day in disgrace with him--his manner toward her\r\nhaving again all the old tender fondness--she did not fully recover\r\nher spirits, but, spite of her struggles to be cheerful and hopeful,\r\nseemed often depressed, and grew pale and thin day by day.\r\n\r\nHer father noticed it with deep concern and anxiety. "Something\r\nmust be done," he said one day to his wife; "the child is drooping\r\nstrangely, and I fear will lose her health. I must try what change\r\nwill do for her. What do you say to a year in Europe?"\r\n\r\n"For all of us?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for you and me and our two children."\r\n\r\n"It might be very pleasant, and Elsie has never been."\r\n\r\n"No; I have always meant to take her, but found home so enjoyable that\r\nI have put it off from year to year."\r\n\r\nElsie entered the room as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Come here, daughter," he said, making room for her on the sofa by his\r\nside. "I was just saying to mamma that I think of taking you all to\r\nEurope for a year. How should you like that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very much, papa!" she answered, looking up brightly; "I should so\r\nenjoy seeing all the places you have told me of,--all the scenes of\r\nyour adventures when you travelled there before."\r\n\r\n"Then I think we will go. Shall we not, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I must pay a visit home first, and do some preparatory\r\nshopping in Philadelphia. Can we go on in time to spend some weeks\r\nthere before sailing?"\r\n\r\n"You might, my dear; but I shall have to stay behind to arrange\r\nmatters here; which will take some time, in contemplation of so\r\nlengthened an absence from the estate."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose we must have a temporary separation," said Rose, in a\r\njesting tone; "I had better take the children and go home at once, so\r\nthat Elsie and I can be getting through our shopping, etc., while you\r\nare busy here."\r\n\r\n"No, Rose; you may go, and take Horace with you, if you like; but\r\nElsie must stay with me. I cannot trust her even with you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa!" And the sweet face flushed crimson, the soft eyes filled\r\nwith tears.\r\n\r\n"I think you misunderstand me, daughter," he said kindly; "I do not\r\nmean that I fear you would fail in obedience to my commands or my\r\nwishes; but that I must keep you under my protection. Besides, I\r\ncannot possibly spare all my treasures--wife, son, and daughter--at\r\nonce. Would you wish to go and leave me quite alone?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no, indeed, you dear, dearest father!" she cried, putting her\r\narm round his neck, and gazing in his face with eyes beaming with joy\r\nand love.\r\n\r\n"Yours is the better plan, I believe, my dear," said Rose. "I would\r\nrather not have you left alone, and I think I could do what is\r\nnecessary for Elsie, in the way of shopping and ordering dresses made,\r\nif she likes to trust me."\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged; three days after this conversation Mrs. Dinsmore\r\nleft for Philadelphia, taking little Horace with her, and a fortnight\r\nlater Mr. Dinsmore followed with Elsie.\r\n\r\nDearly as the young girl loved Rose and her little brother, it had yet\r\nbeen an intense pleasure to her to have her father all to herself, and\r\nbe everything to him for those two weeks; and she was almost sorry to\r\nhave them come to an end.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when they reached the City of Brotherly Love. Mr.\r\nAllison\'s residence was several miles distant from the depot, but his\r\ncarriage was there in waiting for them.\r\n\r\n"Are the family all well, Davis?" inquired Mr. Dinsmore, addressing\r\nthe coachman, as he placed Elsie in the vehicle.\r\n\r\n"All well, sir; Mrs. Dinsmore and the little boy too."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I am thankful for that. You may drive on at once. My man John\r\nwill call a hack and follow us with Aunt Chloe and the baggage."\r\n\r\n"Did you give John the checks, papa?" asked Elsie as he took his seat\r\nby her side, and Davis shut the carriage door.\r\n\r\n"Yes. How weary you look, my poor child! There, lean on me," and he\r\nput his arm about her and made her lay her head on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey drove on rapidly, passing through several comparatively silent\r\nand deserted streets, then suddenly the horses slackened their pace,\r\na bright light shone in at the carriage window and the hum of\r\nmany voices and sound of many feet attracted the attention of the\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nElsie started and raised her head, asking, "What is it, papa?"\r\n\r\n"We are passing a theatre, and it seems the play is just over, judging\r\nby the crowds that are pouring from its doors."\r\n\r\nDavis reined in his horses to avoid running over those who were\r\ncrossing the street, and Elsie, glancing from the window, caught sight\r\nof a face she knew only too well. Its owner was in the act of stepping\r\nfrom the door of the theatre, and staggered as he did so--would have\r\nfallen to the ground had he not been held up by his companion, a\r\ngaudily dressed, brazen-faced woman, whose character there was no\r\nmistaking.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, Tom!" she cried, with a loud and boisterous laugh, "I saved\r\nyou from a downfall that time; which I\'ll be bound is more than that\r\nSouthern heiress of yours would have done."\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t be throwing her up to me again, Bet," he answered thickly,\r\nreeling along so close to our travellers that they caught the scent of\r\nhis breath; "I tell you again she can\'t hold a candle to you, and I\r\nnever cared for her; it was the money I was after."\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore saw a deadly pallor suddenly overspread his daughter\'s\r\nface; for a single instant her eyes sought his with an expression of\r\nmute despairing agony that wrung his heart; then all was darkness as\r\nagain the carriage rolled rapidly onward.\r\n\r\n"My poor, poor darling!" he murmured, drawing her close to him and\r\nfolding his arms about her as if he would shield her from every danger\r\nand evil, while hers crept around his neck and her head dropped upon\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rattled on over the rough stones. Elsie clung with\r\ndeath-like grasp to her father, shudder after shudder shaking her\r\nwhole frame, in utter silence at first, but at length, as they came\r\nupon a smoother road and moved with less noise and jolting, "Papa,"\r\nshe whispered, "oh, what a fearful, fearful fate you have saved me\r\nfrom! Thank God for a father\'s protecting love and care!"\r\n\r\n"Thank Him that I have my darling safe." he responded in a deeply\r\nmoved tone, and caressing her with exceeding tenderness.\r\n\r\nIn another moment they had stopped before Mr. Allison\'s door, which\r\nwas thrown wide open almost on the instant; for Rose and Edward were\r\nup, waiting and listening for their coming.\r\n\r\n"Come at last! glad to see you!" cried the latter, springing down\r\nthe steps to greet his brother-in-law as he alighted. Then, as Mr.\r\nDinsmore turned, lifted his daughter from the carriage, and half\r\ncarried her into the house, "But what\'s the matter? Elsie ill? hurt?\r\nhave you had an accident?"\r\n\r\nRose stood waiting in the hall. "My dear husband!" she exclaimed in a\r\ntone of mingled affection, surprise, and alarm. "What is it? what is\r\nwrong with our darling? Come this way, into the sitting-room, and lay\r\nher on the sofa."\r\n\r\n"She has received a heavy blow, Rose, but I think--I hope it will turn\r\nout for her good in the end," he said low and tremulously, as he laid\r\nher down.\r\n\r\nShe seemed in a half-fainting condition, and Edward rushed away in\r\nsearch of restoratives.\r\n\r\nRose asked no more questions at the time, nor did her husband give any\r\nfurther information, but in silence, broken only now and then by\r\na subdued whisper, they both devoted their energies to Elsie\'s\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n"Shall I go for a doctor?" asked Edward.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you. I think she will be better presently," answered Mr.\r\nDinsmore.\r\n\r\n"I am better now," murmured Elsie feebly. "Papa, if you will help me\r\nup to bed, I shall do very well."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you eat something first?" asked Rose, "I have a nice little\r\nsupper set out in the next room for papa and you."\r\n\r\nElsie shook her head, and sighed, "I don\'t think I could, mamma; I am\r\nnot at all hungry."\r\n\r\n"I want you to try, though," said her father; "it is some hours now\r\nsince you tasted food, and I think you need it," and lifting her\r\ntenderly in his arms he carried her into the supper-room, where he\r\nseated her at the table in an easy-chair which Edward hastily wheeled\r\nup for her use.\r\n\r\nTo please her father she made a determined effort, and succeeded in\r\nswallowing a few mouthfuls. After that he helped her to her room and\r\nleft her in the care of Rose and Chloe.\r\n\r\nHaving seen with her own eyes, and heard with her own ears, Elsie\r\ncould no longer doubt the utter unworthiness of Egerton, or his\r\nidentity with Tom Jackson; of whose vices and crimes she had heard\r\nfrom both her father and Walter, with whom she still kept up a\r\ncorrespondence. She loved him no longer; nay, she had never loved him;\r\nher affection had been bestowed upon the man she believed him to be,\r\nnot the man that he was. But now the scales had fallen from her eyes,\r\nshe saw him in all his hideous moral deformity, and shrank with horror\r\nand loathing from the recollection that his arm had once encircled\r\nher waist, his lip touched her cheek. She could now appreciate her\r\nfather\'s feelings of anger and indignation on learning that she had\r\npermitted such liberties, and felt more deeply humbled and penitent on\r\naccount of it than ever before.\r\n\r\nShe slept little that night, and did not leave her room for several\r\ndays. The sudden shock had quite unnerved her; but the cause of her\r\nillness remained a secret between herself and her parents, who watched\r\nover her with the tenderest solicitude, and spared no effort to\r\ncheer and comfort her. She seemed at this time to shrink from all\r\ncompanionship but theirs, although she and her mamma\'s younger\r\nbrothers and sisters had always entertained a warm friendship for each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day after their arrival her father took her out for\r\na drive, and returning left her resting on the sofa in her\r\ndressing-room, while he and Rose went for a short walk.\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang, and presently Chloe came up with a very smiling\r\nface to ask if "Marse Walter" might come in.\r\n\r\n"Walter?" cried Elsie, starting up. "Yes, indeed!"\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely spoken the words before he was there beside her,\r\nshaking hands, and kissing her, saying with a gay boyish laugh, "I\r\nsuppose your uncle has a right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly; though I don\'t know when, he ever claimed it before.\r\nBut oh, how glad I am to gee you! and how you\'ve grown and improved.\r\nSit down, do. There\'s an easy-chair.\r\n\r\n"Excuse my not getting up; papa bade me lie and rest for an hour."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, yes; and I know you always obey orders. And so you\'re on the\r\nsick list? what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nAn expression of pain crossed her features and the color faded from\r\nher cheek. "I have been ailing a little," she said, "but am better\r\nnow. How is Arthur?"\r\n\r\n"H\'m! well enough physically, but--in horrible disgrace with papa.\r\nYou\'ve no idea, Elsie, to what an extent that Tom Jackson has fleeced\r\nhim. He\'s over head and ears in debt, and my father\'s furious. He has\r\nput the whole matter into Horace\'s hands for settlement. Did he tell\r\nyou about it?"\r\n\r\n"No, he only said he expected to go to Princeton to-morrow to attend\r\nto some business. He would have gone sooner, but didn\'t like to leave\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Careful of you as ever! that\'s right. I say, Elsie, I think Horace\r\nhas very sensible ideas about matters and things."\r\n\r\n"Do you? I own I think so myself," she answered with a quiet smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes; you see Arthur is in debt some thousands, a good share of it\r\nwhat they call debts of honor. Papa had some doubt as to whether they\r\nought to be paid, and asked Horace what was his opinion. Adelaide\r\nwrote me the whole story, you see. Here, I\'ll give it to you in his\r\nexact words, as she reports them," he added, taking a letter from his\r\npocket and reading aloud, "\'Father, don\'t think of such a thing! Why,\r\nsurely it would be encouraging gambling, which is a ruinous vice; and\r\npaying a man for robbing and cheating. I would, if necessary, part\r\nwith the last cent to pay an honest debt; but a so-called debt of\r\nhonor (of dishonor would be more correct) I would not pay if I had\r\nmore money than I could find other uses for.\' And I think he was\r\nright. Don\'t you?" concluded Walter.\r\n\r\n"I think papa is always right."\r\n\r\n"Yes? Well, I was afraid you didn\'t think he was in regard to\r\nthat--fellow you met out in Lansdale; I\'ve been wanting to see you to\r\ntell you what I know of the scoundrelism of Tom Jackson, and the proof\r\nthat they are one and the same."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know, I--I believe it now, Walter, and--But don\'t let us speak\r\nof it again," she faltered, turning deathly pale and almost gasping\r\nfor breath.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t; I didn\'t know you\'d mind; I--I\'m very sorry," he stammered,\r\nlooking anxious, and vexed with himself.\r\n\r\n"Never mind; I shall soon learn not to care. Now tell me about Arthur.\r\nWill he stay and finish his course?"\r\n\r\n"No; papa says his patience is worn out, and his purse can stand no\r\nmore such drains as Arthur has put upon it two or three times already.\r\nSo he is to leave and go home as soon as Horace has settled up his\r\naffairs."\r\n\r\n"And you?"\r\n\r\n"I hope to go on and to graduate in another year."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Wal, I\'m so glad! so thankful you have\'nt followed in poor\r\nArthur\'s footsteps."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t let me, Elsie; he actually wouldn\'t. I know I\'m lacking\r\nin self-reliance and firmness, and if Art had chosen to lead me wrong,\r\nI\'m afraid he\'d have succeeded. But he says, poor fellow! that it\'s\r\nenough for one to be a disgrace to the family, and has tried to keep\r\nme out of temptation. And you can\'t think how much my correspondence\r\nwith you has helped to keep me straight. Your letters always did me so\r\nmuch good."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you for telling me that!" she cried, with bright, glad\r\ntears glistening in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"No, \'tis I that owe thanks to you," he said, looking down\r\nmeditatively at the carpet and twirling his watch-key between his\r\nfinger and thumb.\r\n\r\n"Poor Art! this ought to have been his last year, and doubtless would\r\nif he had only kept out of bad company."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Wal, I hope that you will never forget that \'evil communications\r\ncorrupt good manners.\'"\r\n\r\n"I hope not, Elsie. I wish you could stay and attend our commencement.\r\nWhat do you say? Can\'t you? It comes off in about a fortnight."\r\n\r\n"No, Wal. I\'m longing to get away, and papa has engaged our passage\r\nin the next steamer. But perhaps we may return in time to see you\r\ngraduate next year."\r\n\r\n"What, in such haste to leave America! I\'m afraid you\'re losing your\r\npatriotism," he said playfully.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it is no want of love for my dear native land that makes me\r\nimpatient to be gone!" she answered half sadly.\r\n\r\n"And are you really to be gone a year?"\r\n\r\n"So papa intends, but of course everything in this world is\r\nuncertain."\r\n\r\n"I shall look anxiously for my European letters, and expect them to be\r\nvery interesting."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do my best, Wal," she said languidly, "but I don\'t feel, just\r\nnow, as if I could ever write anything worth reading."\r\n\r\n"I think I never saw you so blue," he said in a lively, jesting tone.\r\n"I must tell you of the fun we fellows have, and if it doesn\'t make\r\nyou wish yourself one of us--Well," and he launched out into an\r\nanimated description of various practical jokes played off by the\r\nstudents upon their professors or on each other.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded at length in coaxing some of the old brightness into the\r\nsweet face, and Mr. and Mrs. Dinsmore, mounting the stairs on their\r\nreturn from their walk, exchanged glances of delighted surprise at the\r\nsound of a silvery laugh which had not greeted their ears for days.\r\n\r\nWalter received a hearty welcome from both. His visit, though\r\nnecessarily short, was of real service to Elsie, doing much to rouse\r\nher out of herself and her grief; thus beginning the cure which\r\ntime and change of scene--dulling the keen edge of sorrow and\r\ndisappointment, and giving pleasant occupation to her thoughts--would\r\nat length carry on to completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n  "The shaken tree grows firmer at the roots;\r\n  So love grows firmer for some blasts of doubt."\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was two years or more since the Oaks had suffered the temporary\r\nloss of its master and mistress, yet they had not returned; they still\r\nlingered on foreign shores, and Mrs. Murray, who had been left at\r\nthe head of household affairs, looked in vain for news of their\r\nhome-coming.\r\n\r\nShe now and then received a short business letter from Mr. Dinsmore\r\nor of directions from Rose; or a longer one from the latter or Elsie,\r\ngiving entertaining bits of travel, etc.; and occasionally Adelaide\r\nwould ride over from Roselands and delight the old housekeeper\'s\r\nheart by reading aloud a lively gossipy epistle one or the other had\r\naddressed to her.\r\n\r\nHow charmed and interested were both reader and listener; especially\r\nwhen they came upon one of Rose\'s graphic accounts of their\r\npresentation at court--in London, Paris, Vienna, or St.\r\nPetersburg--wherein she gave a minute description of Elsie\'s dress\r\nand appearance, and dwelt with motherly pride and delight upon the\r\nadmiration everywhere accorded to the beauty and sweetness of the\r\nlovely American heiress.\r\n\r\nIt was a great gratification to Adelaide\'s pride in her niece to learn\r\nthat more than one coronet had been laid at her feet; yet she was not\r\nsorry to hear that they had been rejected with the gentle firmness\r\nwhich she knew Elsie was capable of exercising.\r\n\r\n"But what more could the bairn or her father desire? would he keep the\r\nsweet lassie single a\' her days, Miss Dinsmore?" asked Mrs. Murray\r\nwhen Adelaide told her this.\r\n\r\n"No," was the smiling rejoinder; "I know he would be very loath to\r\nresign her; but this is Elsie\'s own doing. She says the man for whom\r\nshe would be willing to give up her native land must be very dear\r\nindeed, that her hand shall never be given without her heart, and that\r\nit still belongs more to her father than to any one else."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is well, Miss Adelaide. I hae been sorely troubled aboot my\r\nsweet bairn. I never breathed the thoct to ither mortal ear, but when\r\nthey cam hame frae that summer in the North, she was na the blythe\r\nyoung thing she had been; and there was that in the wistfu\' and\r\nhungered look o\' her sweet een--when she turned them whiles upon her\r\nfather--that made me think some ane he didna approve had won the\r\ninnocent young heart."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, Mrs. Murray, whatever may have been amiss then, is all over\r\nnow. My sister writes me that Elsie seems very happy, and as devotedly\r\nattached to her father as ever, insisting that no one ever can be so\r\ndear to her as he."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dinsmore\'s last letter was dated Naples, and there they still\r\nlingered.\r\n\r\nOne bright spring day they were out sight-seeing, and had wandered\r\ninto a picture-gallery which they had visited once or twice before.\r\nRose had her husband\'s arm. Elsie held her little brother\'s hand in\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n"Sister," said the child, "look at those ladies and gentlemen. They\r\nare English, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think so," Elsie answered, following the direction of his\r\nglance; "a party of English tourists. No, one of the gentlemen looks\r\nlike an American."\r\n\r\n"That one nearest this way? I can only see his side face, but I think\r\nhe is the handsomest. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and he has a fine form too, an easy, graceful carriage, and\r\npolished manners," she added, as at that moment he stooped to pick\r\nup a handkerchief, dropped by one of the ladies of his party, and\r\npresented it to its owner.\r\n\r\nElsie was partial to her own countrymen, and unaccountably to herself,\r\nfelt an unusual interest in this one. She watched him furtively,\r\nwondering who he was, and thinking that in appearance and manners he\r\ncompared very favorably with the counts, lords, and dukes who in the\r\npast two years had so frequently hovered about her, and hung upon her\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\nBut her father called her attention to something in the painting he\r\nand Rose were examining, and when she turned to look again for the\r\nstranger and his companions, she perceived that they were gone.\r\n\r\n"Papa," she asked, "did you notice that party of tourists?"\r\n\r\n"Not particularly. What about them?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite certain one of the gentlemen was an American; and I half\r\nfancied there was something familiar in his air and manner."\r\n\r\n"Ah! I wish you had spoken of it while he was here, that I might have\r\nmade sure whether he were an old acquaintance. But come," he added,\r\ntaking out his watch, "it is time for us to return home."\r\n\r\nThe Dinsmores were occupying an old palace, the property of a noble\r\nfamily whose decayed fortunes compelled the renting of their\r\nancestral home. In the afternoon of the day of their visit to the\r\npicture-gallery Mr. Dinsmore and his daughter were seated in its\r\nspacious saloon, she beside a window overlooking the street, he at\r\na little distance from her, and near to a table covered with books,\r\nmagazines, and newspapers. That day had brought him a heavy mail from\r\nAmerica, and he was examining the New York and Philadelphia dailies\r\nwith keen interest.\r\n\r\nElsie was evidently paying no heed to what might be passing in the\r\nstreet. A bit of fancy work gave employment to her fingers, while her\r\nthoughts were busy with the contents of a letter received from her\r\nAunt Adelaide that morning.\r\n\r\nIt brought ill news. Arthur had been seriously injured by a railroad\r\naccident and, it was feared, was crippled for life. But that was not\r\nall. Dick Percival--whom Enna had married nearly two years before--had\r\nnow become utterly bankrupt, having wasted his patrimony in rioting\r\nand drunkenness, losing large sums at the gaming-table; and his young\r\nwife, left homeless and destitute, had been compelled to return to her\r\nfather\'s house with her infant son.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore uttered a slight exclamation.\r\n\r\n"What is it, papa?" asked Elsie, lifting her eyes to meet his fixed\r\nupon her with an expression of mingled gratitude and tenderness.\r\n\r\n"Come here," he said, and as she obeyed he drew her to his knee,\r\npassing his arm about her waist, and, holding the paper before her,\r\npointed to a short paragraph which had just caught his eye.\r\n\r\nShe read it at a glance; her face flushed, then paled; she put her arm\r\nabout his neck, and laid her cheek to his, while tears trembled in the\r\nsweet eyes, as soft and beautiful as ever.\r\n\r\nFor a moment neither spoke; then she murmured in low, quivering tones\r\nthe same words that had fallen from her lips two years ago,--"Thank\r\nGod for a father\'s protecting love and care!"\r\n\r\n"Thank Him that I have my daughter safe in my arms," he said,\r\ntightening his clasp about her slender waist. "Ah, my own precious\r\nchild, how could I ever have borne to see you sacrificed to that\r\nwretch!"\r\n\r\nThey had just learned that Tom Jackson had been tried for manslaughter\r\nand for forgery, found guilty on both charges, and sentenced to the\r\nState\'s Prison for a long term of years.\r\n\r\nThey were quiet again for a little; then Elsie said, "Papa, I want to\r\nask you something."\r\n\r\n"Well, daughter, say on."\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking how sad it must be for poor Enna to find herself\r\nso destitute, and that I should like to settle something upon her--say\r\nten or twenty thousand dollars, if I may--"\r\n\r\n"My dear child," he said with a smile, "I have no control over you\r\nnow as regards the disposal of your property. Do you forget that you\r\npassed your majority three weeks ago?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, I have not forgotten; but I don\'t mean ever to do anything\r\nof importance without your approval. So please make up your mind that\r\nI\'m always to be your own little girl; never more than eighteen or\r\ntwenty to you. Now won\'t you answer my question about Enna?"\r\n\r\n"I think it would be quite as well, or better, to defer any such\r\naction for the present. It won\'t hurt Enna to be made to feel poor and\r\ndependent for a time; she needs the lesson; and her parents will not\r\nallow her to suffer privation of any sort. Ah, here comes mamma in\r\nwalking attire. We are going out for perhaps an hour; leaving house,\r\nservants, and the little ones in your charge. Horace, be careful to do\r\njust as your sister tells you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, I will," answered the child, who had come in with his\r\nmother, and had a book in his hand. "Will you help me with my lesson,\r\nElsie, and hear me say it when it is learned?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that I will. Here\'s a stool for you close by my side," she said,\r\ngoing back to her seat by the window.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, dears, we won\'t be gone long." said Rose, taking her\r\nhusband\'s arm.\r\n\r\nElsie and Horace watched them till they had passed out of sight far\r\ndown the street, then returned to their employments; her thoughts\r\nnow going back, not to Roselands, but to Lansdale, Ashlands, and\r\nPhiladelphia; memory and imagination bringing vividly before her each\r\nscene of her past life in which Egerton had borne a part. Did any of\r\nthe old love come back? No, for he was not the man who had won her\r\nesteem and affection; and even while sending up a silent petition for\r\nhis final conversion, she shuddered at the thought of her past danger,\r\nand was filled with gratitude to God and her father at the remembrance\r\nof her narrow escape.\r\n\r\nHer brother\'s voice recalled her from her musings. "Look, sister," he\r\nexclaimed, glancing from the window, "there is the very same gentleman\r\nwe saw this morning! and see, he\'s crossing the street! I do believe\r\nhe\'s coming here."\r\n\r\nElsie looked, recognized the stranger, and perceived, with a slight\r\nemotion of surprise and pleasure, that he was approaching their door.\r\nThat he was her countryman, and perhaps direct from her dear native\r\nland, was sufficient to make him a welcome visitor.\r\n\r\nThe next moment John threw open the door of the saloon and announced,\r\n"A gentleman from America!"\r\n\r\n"One who brings no letter of introduction; yet hopes for an audience\r\nof you, fair lady," he said, coming forward with smiling countenance\r\nand outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Travilla! can it be possible!" she cried, starting up in joyful\r\nastonishment, and hastening to bid him welcome.\r\n\r\n"You are not sorry to see me then, my little friend?" he said, taking\r\nher offered hand and pressing it in both of his.\r\n\r\n"Sorry, my dear sir! what a question! Were you not always a most\r\nwelcome guest in my father\'s house? and if welcome at home, much more\r\nso here in a foreign land."\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla looked into the sweet face, more beautiful than ever, and\r\nlonged to treat her with the affectionate freedom of former days, yet\r\nrefrained; the gentle dignity of her manner seeming to forbid it,\r\npleased and cordial as was her greeting.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Horace and shook hands with him, remarking that he had\r\ngrown very much.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad to see you, sir," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"You have not forgotten me then?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, no, indeed; and I can\'t think how it was that sister and I did\r\nnot know you yesterday in the picture-gallery; though we knew you were\r\nan American!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, were you there? How blind I must have been!" and he turned to\r\nElsie again.\r\n\r\n"We were there for but a few minutes before your party left; and quite\r\nat the other end of that long gallery," she said. "But I am surprised\r\nthat I failed to recognize you, even at that distance. But I had no\r\nthought of your being in the country. How delighted papa will be\r\nto see you. He has often spoken of the old times when you and he\r\ntravelled over Europe together, and wished that you were with him on\r\nthis trip. He and mamma have gone out, but will be in presently."\r\n\r\nElsie had many inquiries to make in regard to the health and welfare\r\nof relatives and friends, and the old family servants at the Oaks; Mr.\r\nTravilla numerous questions to ask concerning all that she had seen\r\nand done since leaving America. But in the midst of it all she\r\nexclaimed, "Ah, you must see our little Frenchwoman! such a darling as\r\nshe is!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ring the bell, sister," said Horace, seeing her glance toward\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJohn appeared in answer, was ordered to tell the nurse to bring the\r\nbaby, and a neatly dressed middle-aged woman presently entered the\r\nroom, carrying a lovely infant a little more than a year old.\r\n\r\n"See, is she not a darling?" said Elsie, taking it in her arms. "She\r\nhas mamma\'s own sweet pretty blue eyes, and is named for her. Our\r\nRosebud we call her. Papa gave her the name, and he says she is as\r\nmuch like her mother as I am like mine. You don\'t know, Mr. Travilla,\r\nhow glad I was when she came to us; it was something so new and\r\ndelightful to have a sister of my own. Ah, I love her dearly, and she\r\nreturns my affection. There, see her lay her little head down on my\r\nshoulder."\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla admired and caressed the little creature, coaxed her to\r\ncome to him for a moment, and the nurse carried her away.\r\n\r\n"When do you return home, Elsie?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"In the fall. Mr. and Mrs. Perris, mamma\'s grandparents, have their\r\ngolden wedding in October. Sophy expects to be married at the same\r\ntime, and of course we wish to be present on the occasion. We have\r\nyet to visit Turin, Venice, and Munich. After seeing these places we\r\nintend to spend the rest of the summer in Switzerland, sailing for\r\nAmerica some time in September. Ah, here are papa and mamma!" she\r\nadded as the two entered the room together.\r\n\r\n"Travilla! what favorable wind blew you here?" cried Mr. Dinsmore,\r\nshaking his friend\'s hand, in almost boyish delight.\r\n\r\n"A westerly one, I believe," answered Travilla, laughing and shaking\r\nhands with Rose, who looked scarcely less pleased than her husband.\r\n"They think at Roselands and the Oaks that your year is a very long\r\none, or that you have lost your reckoning, and were anxious to send\r\na messenger to assist you in recovering it; so I volunteered my\r\nservices."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that was kind! but to be able to do so to advantage you will need\r\nto take up your abode with us for the present, and to make one of our\r\nparty when we start again upon our travels."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will," added Rose; "we always consider you one of the\r\nfamily; a sort of brother to us and uncle to the children."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, you are most kind," he said, a slight flush suffusing his\r\ncheek for an instant, while his eyes involuntarily sought Elsie\'s face\r\nwith a wistful, longing look.\r\n\r\nHer father turned laughingly to her. "Is this your stranger of the\r\npicture-gallery? ah, are you not ashamed of failing to recognize so\r\nold a friend?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, but I did not catch sight of his full face, and he was\r\nat quite a distance, and I never thinking of the possibility that he\r\ncould be anywhere out of America."\r\n\r\n"And time makes changes in us all--is fast turning me into a quiet\r\nmiddle-aged man."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind to furnish another excuse for my stupidity," said\r\nElsie, smiling, "but I really cannot see that you have changed in the\r\nleast since I saw you last."\r\n\r\n"And no stranger would ever think of pronouncing you over thirty,"\r\nadded Rose.\r\n\r\n"Ah, you flatter me, fair ladies," returned Mr. Travilla, smiling and\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\n"No, I can vouch for the truthfulness and honesty of both," said Mr.\r\nDinsmore.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla did not hesitate to accept his friend\'s invitation,\r\nknowing that it was honestly given, and feeling that he could not\r\ndecline it without doing violence to his own inclination. He made one\r\nof their party during the rest of their stay in Europe and on the\r\nvoyage to America.\r\n\r\nHis presence was most welcome to all; he saw no reason to doubt that,\r\nand yet Elsie\'s manner sometimes saddened and depressed him. Not that\r\nthere was ever in it anything approaching to coolness, but it lacked\r\nthe old delightful familiarity, instead of which there was now a quiet\r\nreserve, a gentle dignity, that kept him at a distance, and while\r\nincreasing his admiration for the fair girl, made him sigh for the old\r\nchildish days when she was scarcely under more constraint with him\r\nthan with her father.\r\n\r\nOur little party reached Philadelphia a fortnight before the golden\r\nwedding. They found the handsome city residence of the Allisons\r\noccupied by the family, and full of the pleasant stir and bustle of\r\npreparation for the eventful day which was to witness the celebration\r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the wedding of Mr. and Mrs. Ferris, and\r\nthe marriage of their granddaughter.\r\n\r\nSophy, while paying a visit to Rose in her Southern home, had won the\r\nheart of Harry Carrington, and they had been engaged a year or more.\r\nHarry had once indulged in a secret penchant for Elsie; but now he\r\nwould not have exchanged his merry, blue-eyed Sophy for her, or for\r\nany other lady in the land.\r\n\r\nThe young couple were married at church, very early in the evening,\r\nElsie acting as first bridesmaid. Returning to the house the bridal\r\nparty were ushered into the drawing-room, which they found richly\r\nornamented with evergreens and flowers. In the centre rose a pyramid\r\nof rare and beautiful blossoms, filling the air with their delicious\r\nperfume. Above that was a wide arch of evergreens bearing the\r\nmonograms of Mr. and Mrs. Ferris, placed between the dates of their\r\nmarriage and of this anniversary.\r\n\r\nThe old bride and groom sat together beneath the arch on one side of\r\nthe pyramid, while the newly-married pair took up a similar position,\r\nupon the other.\r\n\r\nOnly the family and near connections were present for the first half\r\nhour. The eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Ferris made a short address,\r\nthanking his aged parents for their unselfish love and devotion to\r\ntheir offspring, and exhorting the youthful bride and groom to follow\r\nin their footsteps. Upon the conclusion of this little speech,\r\ngifts were presented by children and grandchildren, and letters of\r\ncongratulation, in both poetry and prose, from absent friends were\r\nread.\r\n\r\nAfter this the doors were thrown open to the invited guests, and for\r\nthe remainder of the evening the house was thronged with the elite of\r\nthe city, and with friends and acquaintances from other parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter were Adelaide and Walter Dinsmore, and Mr. Travilla\r\nand his mother. The last named was seated in the corner of a sofa, her\r\nson standing by her side.\r\n\r\nHe heard a low-breathed sigh, noted the quivering of her lip and\r\nthe gathering tears in the gentle eyes, as she turned them upon the\r\ngray-haired bride and groom, and he knew that her thoughts were with\r\nthe early dead, the husband and father whose image he could scarcely\r\nrecall. His heart swelled with tender pitying, protecting love, as he\r\nthought of her long, lonely widowhood, and of all that she had been\r\nand still was to him.\r\n\r\nBut her gaze wandered to the pair standing just upon the threshold of\r\nmarried life; and smiling up at him, "They are a handsome couple," she\r\nsaid; "how proud and happy Harry looks! Ah, Edward, when will your\r\nturn come?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with a rather melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n"It is your own fault, I am sure," she continued in a playful tone;\r\n"there are plenty of pretty girls and charming young widows who would\r\nlike well to be mistress of Ion, and I am growing old, and sometimes\r\nfeel that I would be glad to resign the sceptre to younger hands."\r\n\r\nHe gave her a glance of affectionate concern. "I shall look for a\r\nhousekeeper immediately. I ought to have thought of it before."\r\n\r\n"No, no, it is a daughter I want," she returned still playfully. "I\r\nhave often wondered how it has come to pass that my warm-hearted boy\r\nseems so perfectly invulnerable to Cupid\'s darts."\r\n\r\n"All seeming, mother," he answered lightly, but with a wistful\r\nyearning look in his eyes which were fixed upon a little group on the\r\nfarther side of the room; "to tell you a secret," and he bent down,\r\nthat the low-breathed words might catch her ear alone, "I have been\r\nhopelessly in love for many years."\r\n\r\nShe started with surprise,--for there was the ring of deep, earnest\r\nfeeling beneath the jesting tone--then following the direction of\r\nhis glance, and perceiving that the group upon which it rested\r\nwas composed of Adelaide and Elsie Dinsmore, with some half dozen\r\ngentlemen who had gathered about them, she looked greatly pleased.\r\n\r\n"And why hopeless?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Ah, the evidences of indifference are so patent that I cannot hope\r\nshe will ever learn to care for me."\r\n\r\n"And pray what may they be?"\r\n\r\n"Constraint and reserve, where formerly there was much warmth and\r\ncordiality of manner."\r\n\r\n"You foolish boy! if that be all, you may take heart. I would not ask\r\nfor better symptoms. And remember the old proverb--\'Faint heart never\r\nwon fair lady.\' You do not fear that she still clings to the old\r\nlove?"\r\n\r\n"No, ah no!"\r\n\r\n"I never saw Adelaide look better than she does to-night," was Mrs.\r\nTravilla\'s next remark; "what a queenly presence, and noble face she\r\nhas, and how very lovely our little Elsie is! She seems to have gained\r\nevery womanly grace without losing a particle of her sweet childish\r\nsimplicity and freshness."\r\n\r\nHer son assented with a slight sigh, and wandered off in their\r\ndirection. But before he reached the little group, Elsie had taken\r\nHarold Allison\'s arm and was being led away toward the conservatory.\r\nHarold had a rare plant to show her, and was glad of the excuse to get\r\nher to himself for a few moments.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the evening Mr. Travilla devoted himself to Adelaide,\r\nhis mother looking on with beaming countenance, and thinking how\r\ngladly she would welcome the dear girl to her heart and home.\r\n\r\nIt was past twelve when the company dispersed. Harry and his bride\r\nhaving started an hour before upon their wedding tour.\r\n\r\n"Get to bed as soon as you can, my dear child; you are looking sadly\r\nfatigued," Mr. Dinsmore said, putting his arm about his daughter as\r\nshe came to him for her good-night kiss.\r\n\r\n"I will, papa," she answered, clinging to him with more than her usual\r\nwarmth of affection. "Dear papa, what could I ever do without you to\r\nlove me?"\r\n\r\n"My darling, if it please the Lord, may we be long spared to each\r\nother," he whispered, clasping her close. "Now, good-night, and may He\r\nbless you, and keep you, and ever cause his face to shine upon you."\r\n\r\nElsie turned away with eyes full of tears, and her pillow was bedewed\r\nwith them ere she slept that night. But the morning found her\r\napparently her own bright, sunny self again.\r\n\r\nShe was in her mamma\'s dressing-room soon after breakfast, chatting\r\nwith her and Adelaide, Mr. Dinsmore sitting by with Rosebud on his\r\nknee. Of course they were discussing the wedding, how lovely the bride\r\nand her attendants looked, how handsome the groom, how tasteful and\r\nbecoming was the dress of this lady and that, how attentive was Mr.\r\nSuch-an-one to Miss So-and-so, etc., etc. Rose making a little jesting\r\nallusion to "the devotion of a certain gentleman to Adelaide;" and\r\nsaying how delighted she was; nothing could please her better than for\r\nthem to fancy each other; when in the midst of it all, a servant came\r\nup with a message. "Mr. Travilla was in the drawing-room asking for\r\nMiss Dinsmore,--Miss Adelaide."\r\n\r\nShe went down at once, and as the door closed upon her, Rose turned to\r\nher husband with the laughing remark, "It would be a splendid match!\r\nthey seem just made for each other. I wonder they didn\'t find it out\r\nlong ago, and I begin to quite set my heart upon it."\r\n\r\n"Better not, my dear, lest they disappoint you, and allow me to advise\r\nyou to let match-making alone; \'tis a dangerous business. Elsie, my\r\nchild, you are looking pale this morning; late hours do not agree\r\nwith you. I think I shall have to take to sending you to bed at nine\r\no\'clock again, when once I get you home."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t ten be early enough, papa?" she answered with a faint smile, a\r\nvivid color suddenly suffusing her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Well, we will see about it. But I can\'t have you looking so. Go and\r\nput on your hat and shawl, and I will take you and mamma out for an\r\nairing?"\r\n\r\n"Looking so?" said Rose, with an arch glance at the glowing cheeks, as\r\nshe stooped to take Rosebud in her arms, "she is not pale now."\r\n\r\n"No, certainly not," he said. "Come back, daughter," for Elsie had\r\nrisen to obey his order, and was moving toward the door, "come here\r\nand tell me what ails you?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite well, papa, only a little tired from last night, I\r\nbelieve," she answered, as he took her hands in his and looked\r\nsearchingly into her face.\r\n\r\n"I hope that is all," he said a little anxiously. "You must lie down\r\nand try to get a nap when we return from our drive; and remember you\r\nmust be in bed by ten o\'clock to-night."\r\n\r\n"I shall do just as my father bids me," she said, smiling up at him,\r\n"my dear father who is so kindly careful of me." Then as he let go her\r\nhands, she tripped lightly from the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla had come on an errand from his mother; she begged\r\nAdelaide\'s advice and assistance in a little shopping.\r\n\r\nAdelaide was at leisure, and at once donned bonnet and shawl and went\r\nwith him to the Girard House, where the old lady awaited their coming,\r\nand the three spent the remainder of the morning in attending to Mrs.\r\nTravilla\'s purchases and visiting the Academy of Fine Arts. In driving\r\ndown Chestnut street, the Dinsmores passed them on their way to the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nAdelaide did not return to Mr. Allison\'s to dinner, but Mr. Travilla\r\ncalled presently after, to say that she had dined with his mother and\r\nhimself at the hotel, and would not return until bed-time, as they\r\nwere all going to hear Gough lecture that evening.\r\n\r\nHe was speaking to Mrs. Allison. Several of the family were in the\r\nroom, Elsie among them. She was slipping quietly away, when he turned\r\ntoward her, saying: "Would you not like to go with us, my little\r\nfriend? I think you would find it entertaining, and we would be glad\r\nto have you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir, you are very kind, but a prior engagement compels me\r\nto decline," she answered, glancing smilingly at her father.\r\n\r\n"She has not been looking well to-day, and I have ordered her to go\r\nearly to bed to-night," Mr. Dinsmore said.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is right!" murmured Mr. Travilla, rising to take leave.\r\n\r\nThe Travillas staid a week longer in the city. During that time\r\nAdelaide went out with them, quite frequently, but Elsie saw scarcely\r\nanything of her old friend; which was, however, all her own fault,\r\nas she studiously avoided him; much to his grief and disturbance. He\r\ncould not imagine what he had done to so completely estrange her from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr. Dinsmore felt in some haste to be at home again, but Mrs. Allison\r\npleaded so hard for another week that he consented to delay. Adelaide\r\nand Walter went with the Travillas, and wanted to take Elsie with\r\nthem, but he would not hear of such an arrangement; while she said\r\nvery decidedly that she could not think of being separated from her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nShe seemed gay and happy when with the family, or alone with him or\r\nRose; but coming upon her unexpectedly in her dressing-room, the day\r\nafter the others had left, he found her in tears.\r\n\r\n"Why, my darling, what can be the matter?" he asked, taking her in his\r\narms.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, papa," she said, hastily wiping away her tears and hiding\r\nher blushing face on his breast--"I--I believe I\'m a little homesick."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then, why did you not ask to go with the others?"\r\n\r\n"And leave you? Ah, do you not know that my father is more--a great\r\ndeal more than half of home to me?" she answered, hugging him close.\r\n"And you wouldn\'t have let me go?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, not I; but I\'m afraid I really ought to read you a\r\nlecture. I daresay you miss Sophy very much, but still there are young\r\npeople enough left in the house to keep you from feeling very dull and\r\nlonely, I should think; and as you have all your dear ones about you,\r\nand expect to go home in a few days--"\r\n\r\n"I ought to be cheerful and happy. I know it, papa," she said, as he\r\npaused, leaving his sentence unfinished, "and I\'m afraid I\'m very\r\nwicked and ungrateful. But please don\'t be vexed with me, and I will\r\ntry to banish this feeling of depression."\r\n\r\n"I fear you are not well," he said, turning her face to the light and\r\nexamining it with keen scrutiny; "tell me, are you ill?"\r\n\r\n"No, papa, I think not. Don\'t be troubled about me."\r\n\r\n"I shall send for a doctor if this depression lasts," he said\r\ndecidedly, "for I shall have to conclude that it must arise from some\r\nphysical cause, since I know of no other; and it is so foreign to the\r\nnature of my sunny-tempered little girl."\r\n\r\nHe saw no more of it, though he watched her carefully.\r\n\r\nGreat was the rejoicing at the Oaks when at last the family returned.\r\nAdelaide was there to welcome them, and Elsie thought she had never\r\nseen her look so youthful, pretty, and happy, Chloe remarked upon it\r\nwhile preparing her young mistress for bed, adding that the report in\r\nthe kitchen was that Miss Adelaide and Mr. Travilla were engaged, and\r\nwould probably marry very soon.\r\n\r\nElsie made no remark, but her heart seemed to sink like lead in her\r\nbosom. "Why am I grieving so? what is there in this news to make me\r\nsorry?" she asked herself as she wetted her pillow with her tears.\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m very glad that dear Aunt Adie is so happy, and--and I\r\nused often to wish he was my uncle." Yet the tears would not cease\r\ntheir flow till she had wept herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut she seemed bright and gay as usual in the morning, and meeting\r\nher parents at the breakfast-table, thought they looked as though\r\nsomething had pleased them greatly.\r\n\r\nIt was Rose who told her the news, as an hour later they sauntered\r\naround the garden together, noting the changes which had taken place\r\nthere in their absence.\r\n\r\n"I have something to tell you, dear," Rose said, and Elsie shivered\r\nslightly, knowing what was coming; "something that pleases your father\r\nand me very much, and I think will make you glad too. Can you guess\r\nwhat it is?"\r\n\r\n"About Aunt Adelaide, mamma?" Elsie stooped over a plant, thus\r\nconcealing her face from view, and so controlled her voice that it\r\nbetrayed no emotion. "Yet; I know; she is engaged."\r\n\r\n"And you are pleased with the match, of course; I knew you would be.\r\nYou used so often to wish that he was your uncle, and now he soon will\r\nbe. Your papa and I are delighted; we think there could not have been\r\na more suitable match for either."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad for her--dear Aunt Adie--and for--for him too," Elsie\r\nsaid, her voice growing a little husky at the last.\r\n\r\nBut Rose was speaking to the gardener, and did not notice it, and\r\nElsie wandered on, presently turned into the path leading to her arbor\r\nand seeking its welcome privacy, there relieved her full heart by a\r\nflood of tears.\r\n\r\nMr. Travilla called that day, but saw nothing of his "little friend,"\r\nand in consequence went away very sorrowful, and pondering deeply\r\nthe question what he could have done to alienate her affections so\r\nentirely from him.\r\n\r\nThe next day he came again, quite resolved to learn in what he had\r\noffended, and was overjoyed at hearing that she was alone in her\r\nfavourite arbor.\r\n\r\nHe sought her there and found her in tears. She hastily wiped them\r\naway on perceiving his approach, but could not remove their traces.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," she said, rising and giving him her hand; but with the\r\nreserved manner that had now become habitual, instead of the pleasant\r\nease and familiarity of earlier days; "were you looking for papa? I\r\nthink he is somewhere on the plantation."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear child, it was you I wished to see."\r\n\r\n"Me, Mr. Travilla?" and she east down her eyes, while her cheek\r\ncrimsoned; for he was looking straight into them with his, so wistful\r\nand tender, so fall of earnest, questioning, sorrowful entreaty, that\r\nshe knew not how to meet their gaze.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you, my little friend, for I can no longer endure this torturing\r\nanxiety. Will you not tell me, dear child, what I have done to hurt or\r\ngrieve you so?"\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m not hurt or gri--you have always been most kind," she\r\nstammered, "most--But why should you think I--I was--"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sentence was lost in a burst of tears, and covering\r\nher burning cheeks with her hands, she sank down upon the seat from\r\nwhich she had risen to greet him.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, I did not mean to pain you so; do not weep, it breaks\r\nmy heart to see it. I was far from intending to blame you, or complain\r\nof your treatment," he said in an agitated tone, and bending over her\r\nin tender concern. "I only wanted to understand my error in order that\r\nI might retrieve it, and be no longer deprived of your dear society.\r\nOh, little Elsie, if you only knew how I love you; how I have loved\r\nyou, and only you, all these years--as child and as woman--how I have\r\nwaited and longed, hoping even against hope, that some day I might be\r\nable to win the priceless treasure of your young heart."\r\n\r\nIntense, glad surprise made her drop her hands and look up at him.\r\n"But are you not--I--I thought--I understood--Aunt Adelaide--"\r\n\r\n"Your Aunt Adelaide!" he cried, scarcely less astonished than herself,\r\n"can it be that you do not know--that you have not heard of her\r\nengagement to Edward Allison?"\r\n\r\nA light broke upon Elsie at that question, and her face grew radiant\r\nwith happiness; there was one flash of exceeding joy in the soft eyes\r\nthat met his, and then they sought the ground.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling, could you? is it--can it be--"\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms, folded her close to his heart, calling her by\r\nevery tender and endearing name, and she made no effort to escape, or\r\nto avoid his caresses; did nothing but hide her blushing face on his\r\nbreast, and weep tears of deep joy and thankfulness.\r\n\r\nIt might have been half an hour or an hour afterward (they reckoned\r\nnothing of the flight of time) that Mr. Dinsmore, coming in search of\r\nhis daughter, found them seated side by side, Mr. Travilla with his\r\narm about Elsie\'s waist, and her hand in his. So absorbed were they in\r\neach other that they had not heard the approaching footsteps.\r\n\r\nIt was a state of affairs Mr. Dinsmore was far from expecting, and\r\npausing upon the threshold, he stood spell-bound with astonishment.\r\n"Elsie!" he said at length.\r\n\r\nBoth started and looked up at the sound of his voice, and Mr.\r\nTravilla, still holding fast to his new-found treasure, said in tones\r\ntremulous with joy, "Will you give her to me, Dinsmore? she is willing\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Ah, is it so, Elsie, my darling?" faltered the father, opening his\r\narms to receive her as she flew to him. "Is it so? have I lost the\r\nfirst place in my daughter\'s heart?" he repeated, straining her to his\r\nbreast, and pressing his lips again and again to her fair brow.\r\n\r\n"Dear papa, I never loved you better," she murmured, clinging more\r\nclosely to him. "I shall never cease to be your own dear daughter; can\r\nnever have any father but you--my own dear, dear papa. And you will\r\nnot be left without a little girl to pet and fondle; darling Rosebud\r\nwill fill my place."\r\n\r\n"She has her own; but neither she nor any one else can ever fill\r\nyours, my darling," he answered with a quivering lip. "How can I--how\r\ncan I give you up? my first-born, my Elsie\'s child and mine."\r\n\r\n"You will give her to me, my friend?" repeated Travilla. "I will\r\ncherish her as the apple of my eye; I shall never take her away from\r\nyou, you may see her every day. You love her tenderly, but she is\r\ndearer to me than my own soul."\r\n\r\n"If you have won her heart, I cannot refuse you her hand. Say, Elsie,\r\nmy daughter, is it so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa," she whispered, turning her blushing face away from his\r\nkeen, searching gaze.\r\n\r\n"I can hardly bear to do it. My precious one, I don\'t know how to\r\nresign you to another," he said in a voice low and tremulous with\r\nemotion, and holding her close to his heart; "but since it is your\r\nwish, I must. Take her, my friend, she is yours. But God do so to you,\r\nand more also, if ever you show her aught but love and tenderness."\r\n\r\nHe put her hand into Travilla\'s, and turned to go. But she clung to\r\nhim with the other. "Yours too, papa," she said, looking up into his\r\nsad face with eyes that were full of tears, "always your own daughter\r\nwho loves you better than life."\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling, and who is as dearly loved in return," he said,\r\nstooping to press another kiss on the ruby lips. "Let us be happy, for\r\nwe are not to part." Then walking quickly away, he left them alone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Elsie\'s Girlhood, by Martha Finley\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ELSIE\'S GIRLHOOD ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 9963.txt or 9963.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/9/9/6/9963/\r\n\r\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo, Josephine Paolucci, and\r\nProject Gutenberg Distributed Proofreaders\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
