HARPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1893, Philadelphia\r\n\r\nTO MY DAUGHTER\r\n\r\nMARY E. HARPER,\r\n\r\nTHIS BOOK IS LOVINGLY DEDICATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess when I first learned that Mrs. Harper was about to write "a\r\nstory" on some features of the Anglo-African race, growing out of what\r\nwas once popularly known as the "peculiar institution," I had my doubts\r\nabout the matter. Indeed it was far from being easy for me to think that\r\nshe was as fortunate as she might have been in selecting a subject which\r\nwould afford her the best opportunity for bringing out a work of merit\r\nand lasting worth to the race--such a work as some of her personal\r\nfriends have long desired to see from her graphic pen. However, after\r\nhearing a good portion of the manuscript read, and a general statement\r\nwith regard to the object in view, I admit frankly that my partial\r\nindifference was soon swept away; at least I was willing to wait for\r\nfurther developments.\r\n\r\nBeing very desirous that one of the race, so long distinguished in the\r\ncause of freedom for her intellectual worth as Mrs. Harper has had the\r\nhonor of being, should not at this late date in life make a blunder\r\nwhich might detract from her own good name, I naturally proposed to\r\nawait developments before deciding too quickly in favor of giving\r\nencouragement to her contemplated effort.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was perfectly aware of the fact that she had much material in\r\nher possession for a most interesting book on the subject of the\r\ncondition of the colored people in the South. I know of no other woman,\r\nwhite or colored, anywhere, who has come so intimately in contact with\r\nthe colored people in the South as Mrs. Harper. Since emancipation she\r\nhas labored in every Southern State in the Union, save two, Arkansas and\r\nTexas; in the colleges, schools, churches, and the cabins not excepted,\r\nshe has found a vast field and open doors to teach and speak on the\r\nthemes of education, temperance, and good home building, industry,\r\nmorality, and the like, and never lacked for evidences of hearty\r\nappreciation and gratitude.\r\n\r\nEverywhere help was needed, and her heart being deeply absorbed in the\r\ncause she willingly allowed her sympathies to impel her to perform most\r\nheroic services.\r\n\r\nWith her it was no uncommon occurrence, in visiting cities or towns, to\r\nspeak at two, three, and four meetings a day; sometimes to promiscuous\r\naudiences composed of everybody who would care to come.\r\n\r\nBut the kind of meetings she took greatest interest in were meetings\r\ncalled exclusively for women. In this attitude she could pour out her\r\nsympathies to them as she could not do before a mixed audience; and\r\nindeed she felt their needs were far more pressing than any other class.\r\n\r\nAnd now I am prepared to most fully indorse her story. I doubt whether\r\nshe could, if she had tried ever so much, have hit upon a subject so\r\nwell adapted to reach a large number of her friends and the public with\r\nboth entertaining and instructive matter as successfully as she has done\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\nThe grand and ennobling sentiments which have characterized all her\r\nutterances in laboring for the elevation of the oppressed will not be\r\nfound missing in this book.\r\n\r\nThe previous books from her pen, which have been so very widely\r\ncirculated and admired, North and South--"Forest Leaves," "Miscellaneous\r\nPoems," "Moses, a Story of the Nile," "Poems," and "Sketches of Southern\r\nLife" (five in number)--these, I predict, will be by far eclipsed by\r\nthis last effort, which will, in all probability, be the crowning effort\r\nof her long and valuable services in the cause of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile, as indicated, Mrs. Harper has done a large amount of work in the\r\nSouth, she has at the same time done much active service in the\r\ntemperance cause in the North, as thousands of this class can testify.\r\n\r\nBefore the war she was engaged as a speaker by anti-slavery\r\nassociations; since then, by appointment of the Women\'s Christian\r\nTemperance Union, she has held the office of "Superintendent of Colored\r\nWork" for years. She has also held the office of one of the Directors of\r\nthe Women\'s Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of these influential, earnest, and intelligent\r\nassociations, she has been seen often on their platforms with the\r\nleading lady orators of the nation.\r\n\r\nHence, being widely known not only amongst her own race but likewise by\r\nthe reformers, laboring for the salvation of the intemperate and others\r\nequally unfortunate, there is little room to doubt that the book will be\r\nin great demand and will meet with warm congratulations from a goodly\r\nnumber outside of the author\'s social connections.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the thousands of colored Sunday-schools in the South, in\r\ncasting about for an interesting, moral story-book, full of practical\r\nlessons, will not be content to be without "IOLA LEROY, OR SHADOWS\r\nUPLIFTED."\r\n\r\nWILLIAM STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter\r\n\r\nI.

She had fondled him as a pet animal,\r\nand even taught him to read. Notwithstanding their relation as mistress\r\nand slave, they had strong personal likings for each other.\r\n\r\nTom Anderson was the servant of a wealthy planter, who lived in the city\r\nof C----, North Carolina. This planter was quite advanced in life, but\r\nin his earlier days he had spent much of his time in talking politics in\r\nhis State and National capitals in winter, and in visiting pleasure\r\nresorts and watering places in summer. His plantations were left to the\r\ncare of overseers who, in their turn, employed negro drivers to aid them\r\nin the work of cultivation and discipline. But as the infirmities of age\r\nwere pressing upon him he had withdrawn from active life, and given the\r\nmanagement of his affairs into the hands of his sons. As Robert Johnson\r\nand Thomas Anderson passed homeward from the market, having bought\r\nprovisions for their respective homes, they seemed to be very\r\nlight-hearted and careless, chatting and joking with each other; but\r\nevery now and then, after looking furtively around, one would drop into\r\nthe ears of the other some news of the battle then raging between the\r\nNorth and South which, like two great millstones, were grinding slavery\r\nto powder.\r\n\r\nAs they passed along, they were met by another servant, who said in\r\nhurried tones, but with a glad accent in his voice:--\r\n\r\n"Did you see de fish in de market dis mornin\'? Oh, but dey war splendid,\r\njis\' as fresh, as fresh kin be."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the ticket," said Robert, as a broad smile overspread his face.\r\n"I\'ll see you later."\r\n\r\n"Good mornin\', boys," said another servant on his way to market. "How\'s\r\neggs dis mornin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Fust rate, fust rate," said Tom Anderson. "Bob\'s got it down fine."\r\n\r\n"I thought so; mighty long faces at de pos\'-office dis mornin\'; but I\'d\r\nbetter move \'long," and with a bright smile lighting up his face he\r\npassed on with a quickened tread.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be an unusual interest manifested by these men in the\r\nstate of the produce market, and a unanimous report of its good\r\ncondition. Surely there was nothing in the primeness of the butter or\r\nthe freshness of the eggs to change careless looking faces into such\r\nexpressions of gratification, or to light dull eyes with such gladness.\r\nWhat did it mean?\r\n\r\nDuring the dark days of the Rebellion, when the bondman was turning his\r\neyes to the American flag, and learning to hail it as an ensign of\r\ndeliverance, some of the shrewder slaves, coming in contact with their\r\nmasters and overhearing their conversations, invented a phraseology to\r\nconvey in the most unsuspected manner news to each other from the\r\nbattle-field. Fragile women and helpless children were left on the\r\nplantations while their natural protectors were at the front, and yet\r\nthese bondmen refrained from violence. Freedom was coming in the wake of\r\nthe Union army, and while numbers deserted to join their forces, others\r\nremained at home, slept in their cabins by night and attended to their\r\nwork by day; but under this apparently careless exterior there was an\r\nundercurrent of thought which escaped the cognizance of their masters.\r\nIn conveying tidings of the war, if they wished to announce a victory of\r\nthe Union army, they said the butter was fresh, or that the fish and\r\neggs were in good condition. If defeat befell them, then the butter and\r\nother produce were rancid or stale.\r\n\r\nEntering his home, Robert set his basket down. In one arm he held a\r\nbundle of papers which he had obtained from the train to sell to the\r\nboarders, who were all anxious to hear from the seat of battle. He\r\nslipped one copy out and, looking cautiously around, said to Linda, the\r\ncook, in a low voice:--\r\n\r\n"Splendid news in the papers. Secesh routed. Yankees whipped \'em out of\r\ntheir boots. Papers full of it. I tell you the eggs and the butter\'s\r\nmighty fresh this morning."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sho, chile," said Linda, "I can\'t read de newspapers, but ole\r\nMissus\' face is newspaper nuff for me. I looks at her ebery mornin\' wen\r\nshe comes inter dis kitchen. Ef her face is long an\' she walks kine o\'\r\ndroopy den I thinks things is gwine wrong for dem. But ef she comes out\r\nyere looking mighty pleased, an\' larffin all ober her face, an\' steppin\'\r\nso frisky, den I knows de Secesh is gittin\' de bes\' ob de Yankees.\r\nRobby, honey, does you really b\'lieve for good and righty dat dem\r\nYankees is got horns?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"Well, I yered so."\r\n\r\n"Well, you heard a mighty big whopper."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, Bobby, things goes mighty contrary in dis house. Ole Miss is in\r\nde parlor prayin\' for de Secesh to gain de day, and we\'s prayin\' in de\r\ncabins and kitchens for de Yankees to get de bes\' ob it. But wasn\'t Miss\r\nNancy glad wen dem Yankees run\'d away at Bull\'s Run. It was nuffin but\r\nBull\'s Run an\' run away Yankees. How she did larff and skip \'bout de\r\nhouse. An\' den me thinks to myself you\'d better not holler till you gits\r\nout ob de woods. I specs \'fore dem Yankees gits froo you\'ll be larffin\r\ntother side ob your mouf. While you was gone to market ole Miss com\'d\r\nout yere, her face looking as long as my arm, tellin\' us all \'bout de\r\nwar and saying dem Yankees whipped our folks all to pieces. And she was\r\n\'fraid dey\'d all be down yere soon. I thought they couldn\'t come too\r\nsoon for we. But I didn\'t tell her so."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t expect you did."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t; ef you buys me for a fool you loses your money shore. She\r\nsaid when dey com\'d down yere she wanted all de men to hide, for dey\'d\r\nkill all de men, but dey wouldn\'t tech de women."\r\n\r\n"It\'s no such thing. She\'s put it all wrong. Why them Yankees are our\r\nbest friends."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s jis\' what I thinks. Ole Miss was jis\' tryin to skeer a body. An\'\r\nwhen she war done she jis\' set down and sniffled an\' cried, an\' I war so\r\nglad I didn\'t know what to do. But I had to hole in. An\' I made out I\r\nwar orful sorry. An\' Jinny said, \'O Miss Nancy, I hope dey won\'t come\r\nyere.\' An\' she said, \'I\'se jis\' \'fraid dey will come down yere and\r\ngobble up eberything dey can lay dere hands on.\' An\' she jis\' looked as\r\nef her heart war mos\' broke, an\' den she went inter de house. An\' when\r\nshe war gone, we jis\' broke loose. Jake turned somersets, and said he\r\nwarnt \'fraid ob dem Yankees; he know\'d which side his brad was buttered\r\non. Dat Jake is a cuter. When he goes down ter git de letters he cuts up\r\nall kines ob shines and capers. An\' to look at him skylarking dere while\r\nde folks is waitin\' for dere letters, an\' talkin\' bout de war, yer\r\nwouldn\'t think dat boy had a thimbleful of sense. But Jake\'s listenin\'\r\nall de time wid his eyes and his mouf wide open, an\' ketchin\' eberything\r\nhe kin, an\' a heap ob news he gits dat way. As to Jinny, she jis\'\r\ncapered and danced all ober de flore. An\' I jis\' had to put my han\' ober\r\nher mouf to keep ole Miss from yereing her. Oh, but we did hab a good\r\ntime. Boy, yer oughter been yere."\r\n\r\n"And, Aunt Linda, what did you do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, honey, I war jis\' ready to crack my sides larffin, jis\' to see what\r\na long face Jinny puts on wen ole Miss is talkin\', an\' den to see dat\r\nface wen missus\' back is turned, why it\'s good as a circus. It\'s nuff to\r\nmake a horse larff."\r\n\r\n"Why, Aunt Linda, you never saw a circus?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'se hearn tell ob dem, and I thinks dey mus\' be mighty funny.\r\nAn\' I know it\'s orful funny to see how straight Jinny\'s face looks wen\r\nshe\'s almos\' ready to bust, while ole Miss is frettin\' and fumin\' \'bout\r\ndem Yankees an\' de war. But, somehow, Robby, I ralely b\'lieves dat we\r\ncullud folks is mixed up in dis fight. I seed it all in a vision. An\'\r\nsoon as dey fired on dat fort, Uncle Dan\'el says to me: \'Linda, we\'s\r\ngwine to git our freedom.\' An\' I says: \'Wat makes you think so?" An\' he\r\nsays: \'Dey\'ve fired on Fort Sumter, an\' de Norf is boun\' to whip.\'"\r\n\r\n"I hope so," said Robert. "I think that we have a heap of friends up\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m jis\' gwine to keep on prayin\' an\' b\'lievin\'."\r\n\r\nJust then the bell rang, and Robert, answering, found Mrs. Johnson\r\nsuffering from a severe headache, which he thought was occasioned by her\r\nworrying over the late defeat of the Confederates. She sent him on an\r\nerrand, which he executed with his usual dispatch, and returned to some\r\nwork which he had to do in the kitchen. Robert was quite a favorite with\r\nAunt Linda, and they often had confidential chats together.\r\n\r\n"Bobby," she said, when he returned, "I thinks we ort ter hab a\r\nprayer-meetin\' putty soon."\r\n\r\n"I am in for that. Where will you have it?"\r\n\r\n"Lem me see. Las\' Sunday we had it in Gibson\'s woods; Sunday \'fore las\',\r\nin de old cypress swamp; an\' nex\' Sunday we\'el hab one in McCullough\'s\r\nwoods. Las\' Sunday we had a good time. I war jis\' chock full an\' runnin\'\r\nober. Aunt Milly\'s daughter\'s bin monin all summer, an\' she\'s jis\' come\r\nthroo. We had a powerful time. Eberythin\' on dat groun\' was jis\' alive.\r\nI tell yer, dere was a shout in de camp."\r\n\r\n"Well, you had better look out, and not shout too much, and pray and\r\nsing too loud, because, \'fore you know, the patrollers will be on your\r\ntrack and break up your meetin\' in a mighty big hurry, before you can\r\nsay \'Jack Robinson.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we looks out for dat. We\'s got a nice big pot, dat got cracked las\'\r\nwinter, but it will hole a lot o\' water, an\' we puts it whar we can tell\r\nit eberything. We has our own good times. An\' I want you to come Sunday\r\nnight an\' tell all \'bout the good eggs, fish, and butter. Mark my words,\r\nBobby, we\'s all gwine to git free. I seed it all in a vision, as plain\r\nas de nose on yer face."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope your vision will come out all right, and that the eggs\r\nwill keep and the butter be fresh till we have our next meetin\'."\r\n\r\n"Now, Bob, you sen\' word to Uncle Dan\'el, Tom Anderson, an\' de rest ob\r\ndem, to come to McCullough\'s woods nex\' Sunday night. I want to hab a\r\nsin-killin\' an\' debil-dribin\' time. But, boy, you\'d better git out er\r\nyere. Ole Miss\'ll be down on yer like a scratch cat."\r\n\r\nAlthough the slaves were denied unrestricted travel, and the holding of\r\nmeetings without the surveillance of a white man, yet they contrived to\r\nmeet by stealth and hold gatherings where they could mingle their\r\nprayers and tears, and lay plans for escaping to the Union army.\r\nOutwitting the vigilance of the patrollers and home guards, they\r\nestablished these meetings miles apart, extending into several States.\r\n\r\nSometimes their hope of deliverance was cruelly blighted by hearing of\r\nsome adventurous soul who, having escaped to the Union army, had been\r\npursued and returned again to bondage. Yet hope survived all these\r\ndisasters which gathered around the fate of their unfortunate brethren,\r\nwho were remanded to slavery through the undiscerning folly of those who\r\nwere strengthening the hands which were dealing their deadliest blows at\r\nthe heart of the Nation. But slavery had cast such a glamour over the\r\nNation, and so warped the consciences of men, that they failed to read\r\naright the legible transcript of Divine retribution which was written\r\nupon the shuddering earth, where the blood of God\'s poor children had\r\nbeen as water freely spilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRABAND OF WAR.\r\n\r\nA few evenings after this conversation between Robert and Linda, a\r\nprayer-meeting was held. Under the cover of night a few dusky figures\r\nmet by stealth in McCullough\'s woods.\r\n\r\n"Howdy," said Robert, approaching Uncle Daniel, the leader of the\r\nprayer-meeting, who had preceded him but a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Thanks and praise; I\'se all right. How is you, chile?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m all right," said Robert, smiling, and grasping Uncle Daniel\'s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"What\'s de news?" exclaimed several, as they turned their faces eagerly\r\ntowards Robert.\r\n\r\n"I hear," said Robert, "that they are done sending the runaways back to\r\ntheir masters."\r\n\r\n"Is dat so?" said a half dozen earnest voices. "How did you yere it?"\r\n\r\n"I read it in the papers. And Tom told me he heard them talking about it\r\nlast night, at his house. How did you hear it, Tom? Come, tell us all\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nTom Anderson hesitated a moment, and then said:--\r\n\r\n"Now, boys, I\'ll tell you all \'bout it. But you\'s got to be mighty mum\r\n\'bout it. It won\'t do to let de cat outer de bag."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so! But tell us wat you yered. We ain\'t gwine to say nuffin to\r\nnobody."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Tom, "las\' night ole Marster had company. Two big\r\nginerals, and dey was hoppin\' mad. One ob dem looked like a turkey\r\ngobbler, his face war so red. An\' he sed one ob dem Yankee ginerals, I\r\nthinks dey called him Beas\' Butler, sed dat de slaves dat runned away\r\nwar some big name--I don\'t know what he called it. But it meant dat all\r\nob we who com\'d to de Yankees should be free."\r\n\r\n"Contraband of war," said Robert, who enjoyed the distinction of being a\r\ngood reader, and was pretty well posted about the war. Mrs. Johnson had\r\ntaught him to read on the same principle she would have taught a pet\r\nanimal amusing tricks. She had never imagined the time would come when\r\nhe would use the machinery she had put in his hands to help overthrow\r\nthe institution to which she was so ardently attached.\r\n\r\n"What does it mean? Is it somethin\' good for us?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Robert, a little vain of his superior knowledge, "it is\r\nthe best kind of good. It means if two armies are fighting and the\r\nhorses of one run away, the other has a right to take them. And it is\r\njust the same if a slave runs away from the Secesh to the Union lines.\r\nHe is called a contraband, just the same as if he were an ox or a horse.\r\nThey wouldn\'t send the horses back, and they won\'t send us back."\r\n\r\n"Is dat so?" said Uncle Daniel, a dear old father, with a look of\r\nsaintly patience on his face. "Well, chillen, what do you mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"Go, jis\' as soon as we kin git to de army," said Tom Anderson.\r\n\r\n"What else did the generals say? And how did you come to hear them,\r\nTom?" asked Robert Johnson.\r\n\r\n"Well, yer see, Marster\'s too ole and feeble to go to de war, but his\r\nheart\'s in it. An\' it makes him feel good all ober when dem big ginerals\r\ncomes an\' tells him all \'bout it. Well, I war laying out on de porch\r\nfas\' asleep an\' snorin\' drefful hard. Oh, I war so soun\' asleep dat wen\r\nMarster wanted some ice-water he had to shake me drefful hard to wake me\r\nup. An\' all de time I war wide \'wake as he war."\r\n\r\n"What did they say?" asked Robert, who was always on the lookout for\r\nnews from the battle-field.\r\n\r\n"One ob dem said, dem Yankees war talkin\' of puttin\' guns in our han\'s\r\nand settin\' us all free. An\' de oder said, \'Oh, sho! ef dey puts guns in\r\ndere hands dey\'ll soon be in our\'n; and ef dey sets em free dey wouldn\'t\r\nknow how to take keer ob demselves.\'"\r\n\r\n"Only let \'em try it," chorused a half dozen voices, "an\' dey\'ll soon\r\nsee who\'ll git de bes\' ob de guns; an\' as to taking keer ob ourselves, I\r\nspecs we kin take keer ob ourselves as well as take keer ob dem."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Tom, "who plants de cotton and raises all de crops?"\r\n\r\n    "\'They eat the meat and give us the bones,\r\n      Eat the cherries and give us the stones,\'\r\n\r\n"And I\'m getting tired of the whole business," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"But, Bob," said Uncle Daniel, "you\'ve got a good owner. You don\'t hab\r\nto run away from bad times and wuss a comin\'."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t so good, but it might be better. I ain\'t got nothing \'gainst\r\nmy ole Miss, except she sold my mother from me. And a boy ain\'t nothin\'\r\nwithout his mother. I forgive her, but I never forget her, and never\r\nexpect to. But if she were the best woman on earth I would rather have\r\nmy freedom than belong to her. Well, boys, here\'s a chance for us just\r\nas soon as the Union army gets in sight. What will you do?"\r\n\r\n"I\'se a goin," said Tom Anderson, "jis\' as soon as dem Linkum soldiers\r\ngits in sight."\r\n\r\n"An\' I\'se a gwine wid you, Tom," said another. "I specs my ole\r\nMarster\'ll feel right smart lonesome when I\'se gone, but I don\'t keer\r\n\'bout stayin\' for company\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"My ole Marster\'s room\'s a heap better\'n his company," said Tom\r\nAnderson, "an\' I\'se a goner too. Dis yer freedom\'s too good to be lef\'\r\nbehind, wen you\'s got a chance to git it. I won\'t stop to bid ole Marse\r\ngood bye."\r\n\r\n"What do you think," said Robert, turning to Uncle Daniel; "won\'t you go\r\nwith us?"\r\n\r\n"No, chillen, I don\'t blame you for gwine; but I\'se gwine to stay.\r\nSlavery\'s done got all de marrow out ob dese poor ole bones. Ef freedom\r\ncomes it won\'t do me much good; we ole one\'s will die out, but it will\r\nset you youngsters all up."\r\n\r\n"But, Uncle Daniel, you\'re not too old to want your freedom?"\r\n\r\n"I knows dat. I lubs de bery name of freedom. I\'se been praying and\r\nhoping for it dese many years. An\' ef I warn\'t boun\', I would go wid you\r\nter-morrer. I won\'t put a straw in your way. You boys go, and my prayers\r\nwill go wid you. I can\'t go, it\'s no use. I\'se gwine to stay on de ole\r\nplace till Marse Robert comes back, or is brought back."\r\n\r\n"But, Uncle Daniel," said Robert, "what\'s the use of praying for a\r\nthing if, when it comes, you won\'t take it? As much as you have been\r\npraying and talking about freedom, I thought that when the chance came\r\nyou would have been one of the first to take it. Now, do tell us why you\r\nwon\'t go with us. Ain\'t you willing?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Robbie, my whole heart is wid you. But when Marse Robert went to\r\nde war, he called me into his room and said to me, \'Uncle Dan\'el, I\'se\r\ngwine to de war, an\' I want you to look arter my wife an\' chillen, an\'\r\nsee dat eberything goes right on de place\'. An\' I promised him I\'d do it,\r\nan\' I mus\' be as good as my word. \'Cept de overseer, dere isn\'t a white\r\nman on de plantation, an\' I hear he has to report ter-morrer or be\r\ntreated as a deserter. An\' der\'s nobody here to look arter Miss Mary an\'\r\nde chillen, but myself, an\' to see dat eberything goes right. I promised\r\nMarse Robert I would do it, an\' I mus\' be as good as my word."\r\n\r\n"Well, what should you keer?" said Tom Anderson. "Who looked arter you\r\nwhen you war sole from your farder and mudder, an\' neber seed dem any\r\nmore, and wouldn\'t know dem to-day ef you met dem in your dish?"\r\n\r\n"Well, dats neither yere nor dere. Marse Robert couldn\'t help what his\r\nfather did. He war an orful mean man. But he\'s dead now, and gone to see\r\n\'bout it. But his wife war the nicest, sweetest lady dat eber I did see.\r\nShe war no more like him dan chalk\'s like cheese. She used to visit de\r\ncabins, an\' listen to de pore women when de overseer used to cruelize\r\ndem so bad, an\' drive dem to work late and early. An\' she used to sen\'\r\ndem nice things when they war sick, and hab der cabins whitewashed an\'\r\nlookin\' like new pins, an\' look arter dere chillen. Sometimes she\'d try\r\nto git ole Marse to take dere part when de oberseer got too mean. But\r\nshe might as well a sung hymns to a dead horse. All her putty talk war\r\nlike porin water on a goose\'s back. He\'d jis\' bluff her off, an\' tell\r\nher she didn\'t run dat plantation, and not for her to bring him any\r\nnigger news. I never thought ole Marster war good to her. I often\r\nketched her crying, an\' she\'d say she had de headache, but I thought it\r\nwar de heartache. \'Fore ole Marster died, she got so thin an\' peaked I\r\nwar \'fraid she war gwine to die; but she seed him out. He war killed by\r\na tree fallin\' on him, an\' ef eber de debil got his own he got him. I\r\nseed him in a vision arter he war gone. He war hangin\' up in a pit,\r\nsayin\' \'Oh! oh!\' wid no close on. He war allers blusterin\', cussin\', and\r\nswearin\' at somebody. Marse Robert ain\'t a bit like him. He takes right\r\narter his mother. Bad as ole Marster war, I think she jis\' lob\'d de\r\ngroun\' he walked on. Well, women\'s mighty curious kind of folks anyhow.\r\nI sometimes thinks de wuss you treats dem de better dey likes you."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Tom, a little impatiently, "what\'s yer gwine to do? Is yer\r\ngwine wid us, ef yer gits a chance?"\r\n\r\n"Now, jes\' you hole on till I gits a chance to tell yer why I\'se gwine\r\nto stay."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Daniel, let\'s hear it," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"I was jes\' gwine to tell yer when Tom put me out. Ole Marster died when\r\nMarse Robert war two years ole, and his pore mother when he war four.\r\nWhen he died, Miss Anna used to keep me \'bout her jes\' like I war her\r\nshadder. I used to nuss Marse Robert jes\' de same as ef I were his own\r\nfadder. I used to fix his milk, rock him to sleep, ride him on my back,\r\nan\' nothin\' pleased him better\'n fer Uncle Dan\'el to ride him\r\npiggy-back."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Daniel," said Robert, "what has that got to do with your\r\ngoing with us and getting your freedom?"\r\n\r\n"Now, jes\' wait a bit, and don\'t frustrate my mine. I seed day arter day\r\nMiss Anna war gettin\' weaker and thinner, an\' she looked so sweet and\r\ntalked so putty, I thinks to myself, \'you ain\'t long for dis worl\'.\' And\r\nshe said to me one day, \'Uncle Dan\'el, when I\'se gone, I want you to be\r\ngood to your Marster Robert.\' An\' she looked so pale and weak I war\r\nalmost ready to cry. I couldn\'t help it. She hed allers bin mighty good\r\nto me. An\' I beliebs in praisin\' de bridge dat carries me ober. She\r\nsaid, \'Uncle Dan\'el, I wish you war free. Ef I had my way you shouldn\'t\r\nserve any one when I\'m gone; but Mr. Thurston had eberything in his\r\npower when he made his will. I war tied hand and foot, and I couldn\'t\r\nhelp it.\' In a little while she war gone--jis\' faded away like a flower.\r\nI belieb ef dere\'s a saint in glory, Miss Anna\'s dere."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t take much stock in white folks\' religion," said Robert,\r\nlaughing carelessly.\r\n\r\n"The way," said Tom Anderson, "dat some of dese folks cut their cards\r\nyere, I think dey\'ll be as sceece in hebben as hen\'s teeth. I think wen\r\nsome of dem preachers brings de Bible \'round an\' tells us \'bout mindin\r\nour marsters and not stealin\' dere tings, dat dey preach to please de\r\nwhite folks, an\' dey frows coleness ober de meetin\'."\r\n\r\n"An\' I," said Aunt Linda, "neber did belieb in dem Bible preachers. I\r\nyered one ob dem sayin\' wen he war dyin\', it war all dark wid him. An\'\r\nde way he treated his house-girl, pore thing, I don\'t wonder dat it war\r\ndark wid him."\r\n\r\n"O, I guess," said Robert, "that the Bible is all right, but some of\r\nthese church folks don\'t get the right hang of it."\r\n\r\n"May be dat\'s so," said Aunt Linda. "But I allers wanted to learn how to\r\nread. I once had a book, and tried to make out what war in it, but ebery\r\ntime my mistus caught me wid a book in my hand, she used to whip my\r\nfingers. An\' I couldn\'t see ef it war good for white folks, why it\r\nwarn\'t good for cullud folks."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Tom Anderson, "I belieb in de good ole-time religion. But\r\narter dese white folks is done fussin\' and beatin\' de cullud folks, I\r\ndon\'t want \'em to come talking religion to me. We used to hab on our\r\nplace a real Guinea man, an\' once he made ole Marse mad, an\' he had him\r\nwhipped. Old Marse war trying to break him in, but dat fellow war spunk\r\nto de backbone, an\' when he \'gin talkin\' to him \'bout savin\' his soul\r\nan\' gittin\' to hebbin, he tole him ef he went to hebbin an\' foun\' he war\r\ndare, he wouldn\'t go in. He wouldn\'t stay wid any such rascal as he\r\nwar."\r\n\r\n"What became of him?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he died. But he had some quare notions \'bout religion. He thought\r\ndat when he died he would go back to his ole country. He allers kep\' his\r\nole Guinea name."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"Potobombra. Do you know what he wanted Marster to do \'fore he died?"\r\ncontinued Anderson.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"He wanted him to gib him his free papers."\r\n\r\n"Did he do it?"\r\n\r\n"Ob course he did. As de poor fellow war dying an\' he couldn\'t sell him\r\nin de oder world, he jis\' wrote him de papers to yumor him. He didn\'t\r\nwant to go back to Africa a slave. He thought if he did, his people\r\nwould look down on him, an\' he wanted to go back a free man. He war\r\norful weak when Marster brought him de free papers. He jis\' ris up in de\r\nbed, clutched dem in his han\'s, smiled, an\' gasped out, \'I\'se free at\r\nlas\'; an\' fell back on de pillar, an\' he war gone. Oh, but he war\r\nspunky. De oberseers, arter dey foun\' out who he war, gin\'rally gabe him\r\na wide birth. I specs his father war some ole Guinea king."\r\n\r\n"Well, chillen," said Uncle Daniel, "we\'s kept up dis meeting long\r\nenough. We\'d better go home, and not all go one way, cause de patrollers\r\nmight git us all inter trouble, an\' we must try to slip home by hook or\r\ncrook."\r\n\r\n"An\' when we meet again, Uncle Daniel can finish his story, an\' be ready\r\nto go with us," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"I wish," said Tom Anderson, "he would go wid us, de wuss kind."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE DANIEL\'S STORY.\r\n\r\nThe Union had snapped asunder because it lacked the cohesion of justice,\r\nand the Nation was destined to pass through the crucible of disaster and\r\ndefeat, till she was ready to clasp hands with the negro and march\r\nabreast with him to freedom and victory.\r\n\r\nThe Union army was encamping a few miles from C----, in North Carolina.\r\nRobert, being well posted on the condition of affairs, had stealthily\r\ncontrived to call a meeting in Uncle Daniel\'s cabin. Uncle Daniel\'s wife\r\nhad gone to bed as a sick sister, and they held a prayer-meeting by her\r\nbedside. It was a little risky, but as Mr. Thurston did not encourage\r\nthe visits of the patrollers, and heartily detested having them prying\r\ninto his cabins, there was not much danger of molestation.\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Daniel, we want to hear your story, and see if you have\r\nmade up your mind to go with us," said Robert, after he had been seated\r\na few minutes in Uncle Daniel\'s cabin.\r\n\r\n"No, chillen, I\'ve no objection to finishin\' my story, but I ain\'t made\r\nup my mind to leave the place till Marse Robert gits back."\r\n\r\n"You were telling us about Marse Robert\'s mother. How did you get along\r\nafter she died?"\r\n\r\n"Arter she war gone, ole Marster\'s folks come to look arter things. But\r\neberything war lef\' to Marse Robert, an\' he wouldn\'t do widout me. Dat\r\nchile war allers at my heels. I couldn\'t stir widout him, an\' when he\r\nmissed me, he\'d fret an\' cry so I had ter stay wid him; an\' wen he went\r\nto school, I had ter carry him in de mornin\' and bring him home in de\r\nebenin\'. An\' I learned him to hunt squirrels, an\' rabbits, an\' ketch\r\nfish, an\' set traps for birds. I beliebs he lob\'d me better dan any ob\r\nhis kin\'. An\' he showed me how to read."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Tom, "ef he lob\'d you so much, why didn\'t he set you free?"\r\n\r\n"Marse Robert tole me, ef he died fust he war gwine ter leave me\r\nfree--dat I should neber sarve any one else."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sho!" said Tom, "promises, like pie crusts, is made to be broken. I\r\ndon\'t trust none ob dem. I\'se been yere dese fifteen years, an\' I\'se\r\nneber foun\' any troof in dem. An\' I\'se gwine wid dem North men soon\'s I\r\ngits a chance. An\' ef you knowed what\'s good fer you, you\'d go, too."\r\n\r\n"No, Tom; I can\'t go. When Marster Robert went to de front, he called me\r\nto him an\' said: \'Uncle Daniel,\' an\' he was drefful pale when he said\r\nit, \'I are gwine to de war, an\' I want yer to take keer of my wife an\'\r\nchillen, jis\' like yer used to take keer of me wen yer called me your\r\nlittle boy.\' Well, dat jis\' got to me, an\' I couldn\'t help cryin\', to\r\nsave my life."\r\n\r\n"I specs," said Tom, "your tear bags must lie mighty close to your eyes.\r\nI wouldn\'t cry ef dem Yankees would make ebery one ob dem go to de\r\nfront, an\' stay dere foreber. Dey\'d only be gittin\' back what dey\'s been\r\na doin\' to us."\r\n\r\n"Marster Robert war nebber bad to me. An\' I beliebs in stannin\' by dem\r\ndat stans by you. Arter Miss Anna died, I had great \'sponsibilities on\r\nmy shoulders; but I war orful lonesome, an\' thought I\'d like to git a\r\nwife. But dere warn\'t a gal on de plantation, an\' nowhere\'s roun\', dat\r\nfilled de bill. So I jis\' waited, an\' \'tended to Marse Robert till he\r\nwar ole \'nough to go to college. Wen he went, he allers \'membered me in\r\nde letters he used to write his grandma. Wen he war gone, I war\r\nlonesomer dan eber. But, one day, I jis\' seed de gal dat took de rag off\r\nde bush. Gundover had jis\' brought her from de up-country. She war putty\r\nas a picture!" he exclaimed, looking fondly at his wife, who still bore\r\ntraces of great beauty. "She had putty hair, putty eyes, putty mouth.\r\nShe war putty all over; an\' she know\'d how to put on style."\r\n\r\n"O, Daniel," said Aunt Katie, half chidingly, "how you do talk."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s true. I \'member when you war de puttiest gal in dese diggins;\r\nwhen nobody could top your cotton."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Aunt Katie.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do. Now, let me go on wid my story. De fust time I seed her, I\r\nsez to myself, \'Dat\'s de gal for me, an\' I means to hab her ef I kin git\r\nher.\' So I scraped \'quaintance wid her, and axed her ef she would hab me\r\nef our marsters would let us. I warn\'t \'fraid \'bout Marse Robert, but I\r\nwarn\'t quite shore \'bout Gundover. So when Marse Robert com\'d home, I\r\naxed him, an\' he larf\'d an\' said, \'All right,\' an\' dat he would speak to\r\nole Gundover \'bout it. He didn\'t relish it bery much, but he didn\'t\r\nlike to \'fuse Marse Robert. He wouldn\'t sell her, for she tended his\r\ndairy, an\' war mighty handy \'bout de house. He said, I mought marry her\r\nan\' come to see her wheneber Marse Robert would gib me a pass. I wanted\r\nhim to sell her, but he wouldn\'t hear to it, so I had to put up wid what\r\nI could git. Marse Robert war mighty good to me, but ole Gundover\'s wife\r\nwar de meanest woman dat I eber did see. She used to go out on de\r\nplantation an\' boss things like a man. Arter I war married, I had a\r\nbaby. It war de dearest, cutest little thing you eber did see; but, pore\r\nthing, it got sick and died. It died \'bout three o\'clock; and in de\r\nmornin\', Katie, habbin her cows to milk, lef her dead baby in de cabin.\r\nWhen she com\'d back from milkin\' her thirty cows, an\' went to look for\r\nher pore little baby, some one had been to her cabin an\' took\'d de pore\r\nchile away an\' put it in de groun\'. Pore Katie, she didn\'t eben hab a\r\nchance to kiss her baby \'fore it war buried. Ole Gundover\'s wife has\r\nbeen dead thirty years, an\' she didn\'t die a day too soon. An\' my little\r\nbaby has gone to glory, an\' is wingin\' wid the angels an\' a lookin\' out\r\nfor us. One ob de las\' things ole Gundover\'s wife did \'fore she died war\r\nto order a woman whipped \'cause she com\'d to de field a little late when\r\nher husband war sick, an\' she had stopped to tend him. Dat mornin\' she\r\nwar taken sick wid de fever, an\' in a few days she war gone out like de\r\nsnuff ob a candle. She lef\' several sons, an\' I specs she would almos\'\r\nturn ober in her grave ef she know\'d she had ten culled granchillen\r\nsomewhar down in de lower kentry."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it funny," said Robert, "how these white folks look down on\r\ncolored people, an\' then mix up with them?"\r\n\r\n"Marster war away when Miss \'Liza treated my Katie so mean, an\' when I\r\ntole him \'bout it, he war tearin\' mad, an\' went ober an\' saw ole\r\nGundover, an\' foun\' out he war hard up for money, an\' he bought Katie\r\nand brought her home to lib wid me, and we\'s been a libin in clover eber\r\nsence. Marster Robert has been mighty good to me. He stood by me in my\r\ntroubles, an\' now his trouble\'s come, I\'m a gwine to stan\' by him. I\r\nused to think Gundover\'s wife war jealous ob my Katie. She war so much\r\nputtier. Gundover\'s wife couldn\'t tech my Katie wid a ten foot pole."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Katie, you have had your trials," said Robert, now that\r\nDaniel had finished his story; "don\'t you feel bitter towards these\r\npeople who are fighting to keep you in slavery?"\r\n\r\nAunt Katie turned her face towards the speaker. It was a thoughtful,\r\nintelligent face, saintly and calm. A face which expressed the idea of a\r\nsoul which had been fearfully tempest tossed, but had passed through\r\nsuffering into peace. Very touching was the look of resignation and hope\r\nwhich overspread her features as she replied, with the simple child-like\r\nfaith which she had learned in the darkest hour, "The Lord says, we must\r\nforgive." And with her that thought, as coming from the lips of Divine\r\nLove, was enough to settle the whole question of forgiveness of injuries\r\nand love to enemies.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Thomas Anderson, turning to Uncle Daniel, "we can\'t count\r\non yer to go wid us?"\r\n\r\n"Boys," said Uncle Daniel, and there was grief in his voice, "I\'se\r\nmighty glad you hab a chance for your freedom; but, ez I tole yer, I\r\npromised Marse Robert I would stay, an\' I mus\' be as good as my word.\r\nDon\'t you youngsters stay for an ole stager like me. I\'m ole an\' mos\'\r\nworn out. Freedom wouldn\'t do much for me, but I want you all to be as\r\nfree as the birds; so, you chillen, take your freedom when you kin get\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But, Uncle Dan\'el, you won\'t say nothin\' \'bout our going, will you?"\r\nsaid the youngest of the company.\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel slowly arose. There was a mournful flash in his eye, a\r\ntremor of emotion in his voice, as he said, "Look yere, boys, de boy dat\r\naxed dat question war a new comer on dis plantation, but some ob you\'s\r\nbin here all ob your lives; did you eber know ob Uncle Dan\'el gittin\'\r\nany ob you inter trouble?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," exclaimed a chorus of voices, "but many\'s de time you\'ve held\r\noff de blows wen de oberseer got too mean, an\' cruelized us too much,\r\nwen Marse Robert war away. An\' wen he got back, you made him settle de\r\noberseer\'s hash."\r\n\r\n"Well, boys," said Uncle Daniel, with an air of mournful dignity, "I\'se\r\nde same Uncle Dan\'el I eber war. Ef any ob you wants to go, I habben\'t a\r\nword to say agin it. I specs dem Yankees be all right, but I knows Marse\r\nRobert, an\' I don\'t know dem, an\' I ain\'t a gwine ter throw away dirty\r\nwater \'til I gits clean."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Ben," said Robert, addressing a stalwart man whose towering\r\nform and darkly flashing eye told that slavery had failed to put the\r\ncrouch in his shoulders or general abjectness into his demeanor, "you\r\nwill go with us, for sure, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," spoke up Tom Anderson, "\'cause de trader\'s done took your wife,\r\nan\' got her for his\'n now."\r\n\r\nAs Ben Tunnel looked at the speaker, a spasm of agony and anger darkened\r\nhis face and distorted his features, as if the blood of some strong\r\nrace were stirring with sudden vigor through his veins. He clutched his\r\nhands together, as if he were struggling with an invisible foe, and for\r\na moment he remained silent. Then suddenly raising his head, he\r\nexclaimed, "Boys, there\'s not one of you loves freedom more than I do,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"But what?" said Tom. "Do you think white folks is your bes\' friends?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think so when I lose my senses."\r\n\r\n"Well, now, I don\'t belieb you\'re \'fraid, not de way I yeard you talkin\'\r\nto de oberseer wen he war threatnin\' to hit your mudder. He saw you\r\nmeant business, an\' he let her alone. But, what\'s to hinder you from\r\ngwine wid us?"\r\n\r\n"My mother," he replied, in a low, firm voice. "That is the only thing\r\nthat keeps me from going. If it had not been for her, I would have gone\r\nlong ago. She\'s all I\'ve got, an\' I\'m all she\'s got."\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see the sorrow on the strong face, to detect the\r\npathos and indignation in his voice, as he said, "I used to love Mirandy\r\nas I love my life. I thought the sun rose and set in her. I never saw a\r\nhandsomer woman than she was. But she fooled me all over the face and\r\neyes, and took up with that hell-hound of a trader, Lukens; an\' he gave\r\nher a chance to live easy, to wear fine clothes, an\' be waited on like a\r\nlady. I thought at first I would go crazy, but my poor mammy did all she\r\ncould to comfort me. She would tell me there were as good fish in the\r\nsea as were ever caught out of it. Many a time I\'ve laid my poor head on\r\nher lap, when it seemed as if my brain was on fire and my heart was\r\nalmost ready to burst. But in course of time I got over the worst of\r\nit; an\' Mirandy is the first an\' last woman that ever fooled me. But\r\nthat dear old mammy of mine, I mean to stick by her as long as there is\r\na piece of her. I can\'t go over to the army an\' leave her behind, for if\r\nI did, an\' anything should happen, I would never forgive myself."\r\n\r\n"But couldn\'t you take her with you," said Robert, "the soldiers said we\r\ncould bring our women."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that. The Union army is several miles from here, an\' my poor\r\nmammy is so skeery that, if I were trying to get her away and any of\r\nthem Secesh would overtake us, an\' begin to question us, she would get\r\nskeered almost to death, an\' break down an\' begin to cry, an\' then the\r\nfat would be in the fire. So, while I love freedom more than a child\r\nloves its mother\'s milk, I\'ve made up my mind to stay on the plantation.\r\nI wish, from the bottom of my heart, I could go. But I can\'t take her\r\nalong with me, an\' I don\'t want to be free and leave her behind in\r\nslavery. I was only five years old when my master and, as I believe,\r\nfather, sold us both here to this lower country, an\' we\'ve been here\r\never since. It\'s no use talking, I won\'t leave her to be run over by\r\neverybody."\r\n\r\nA few evenings after this interview, the Union soldiers entered the town\r\nof C----, and established their headquarters near the home of Thomas\r\nAnderson.\r\n\r\nOut of the little company, almost every one deserted to the Union army,\r\nleaving Uncle Daniel faithful to his trust, and Ben Tunnel hushing his\r\nheart\'s deep aspirations for freedom in a passionate devotion to his\r\ntimid and affectionate mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL OF THE UNION ARMY.\r\n\r\nA few evenings before the stampede of Robert and his friends to the\r\narmy, and as he sat alone in his room reading the latest news from the\r\npaper he had secreted, he heard a cautious tread and a low tap at his\r\nwindow. He opened the door quietly and whispered:--\r\n\r\n"Anything new, Tom?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"What is it? Come in."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'se done bin seen dem Yankees, an\' dere ain\'t a bit of troof in\r\ndem stories I\'se bin yerin \'bout \'em."\r\n\r\n"Where did you see \'em?"\r\n\r\n"Down in de woods whar Marster tole us to hide. Yesterday ole Marse sent\r\nfor me to come in de settin\'-room. An\' what do you think? Instead ob\r\nmakin\' me stan\' wid my hat in my han\' while he went froo a whole\r\nrigamarole, he axed me to sit down, an\' he tole me he \'spected de\r\nYankees would want us to go inter de army, an\' dey would put us in front\r\nwhar we\'d all git killed; an\' I tole him I didn\'t want to go, I didn\'t\r\nwant to git all momached up. An\' den he said we\'d better go down in de\r\nwoods an\' hide. Massa Tom and Frank said we\'d better go as quick as eber\r\nwe could. Dey said dem Yankees would put us in dere wagons and make us\r\nhaul like we war mules. Marse Tom ain\'t libin\' at de great house jis\'\r\nnow. He\'s keepin\' bachellar\'s hall."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he go to the battle?"\r\n\r\n"No; he foun\' a pore white man who war hard up for money, an\' he got him\r\nto go."\r\n\r\n"But, Tom, you didn\'t believe these stories about the Yankees. Tom and\r\nFrank can lie as fast as horses can trot. They wanted to scare you, and\r\nkeep you from going to the Union army."\r\n\r\n"I knows dat now, but I didn\'t \'spect so den."\r\n\r\n"Well, when did you see the soldiers? Where are they? And what did they\r\nsay to you?"\r\n\r\n"Dey\'s right down in Gundover\'s woods. An\' de Gineral\'s got his\r\nheadquarters almos\' next door to our house."\r\n\r\n"That near? Oh, you don\'t say so!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do. An\', oh, golly, ain\'t I so glad! I jis\' stole yere to told\r\nyou all \'bout it. Yesterday mornin\' I war splittin\' some wood to git my\r\nbreakfas\', an\' I met one ob dem Yankee sogers. Well, I war so skeered,\r\nmy heart flew right up in my mouf, but I made my manners to him and\r\nsaid, \'Good mornin\', Massa.\' He said, \'Good mornin\'; but don\'t call me\r\n"massa."\' Dat war de fust white man I eber seed dat didn\'t want ter be\r\ncalled \'massa,\' eben ef he war as pore as Job\'s turkey. Den I begin to\r\nfeel right sheepish, an\' he axed me ef my marster war at home, an\' ef he\r\nwar a Reb. I tole him he hadn\'t gone to de war, but he war Secesh all\r\nfroo, inside and outside. He war too ole to go to de war, but dat he war\r\nall de time gruntin\' an\' groanin\', an\' I \'spected he\'d grunt hisself to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"What did he say?"\r\n\r\n"He said he specs he\'ll grunt worser dan dat fore dey get froo wid him.\r\nDen he axed me ef I would hab some breakfas,\' an\' I said, \'No, t\'ank\r\nyou, sir.\' \'An\' I war jis\' as hungry as a dorg, but I war \'feared to\r\neat. I war \'feared he war gwine to pizen me."\r\n\r\n"Poison you! don\'t you know the Yankees are our best friends?"\r\n\r\n"Well, ef dat\'s so, I\'se mighty glad, cause de woods is full ob dem."\r\n\r\n"Now, Tom, I thought you had cut your eye-teeth long enough not to let\r\nthem Anderson boys fool you. Tom, you must not think because a white man\r\nsays a thing, it must be so, and that a colored man\'s word is no account\r\n\'longside of his. Tom, if ever we get our freedom, we\'ve got to learn to\r\ntrust each other and stick together if we would be a people. Somebody\r\nelse can read the papers as well as Marse Tom and Frank. My ole Miss\r\nknows I can read the papers, an\' she never tries to scare me with big\r\nwhoppers \'bout the Yankees. She knows she can\'t catch ole birds with\r\nchaff, so she is just as sweet as a peach to her Bobby. But as soon as I\r\nget a chance I will play her a trick the devil never did."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave her. I ain\'t forgot how she sold my mother from me. Many a\r\nnight I have cried myself to sleep, thinking about her, and when I get\r\nfree I mean to hunt her up."\r\n\r\n"Well, I ain\'t tole you all. De gemman said he war \'cruiting for de\r\narmy; dat Massa Linkum hab set us all free, an\' dat he wanted some more\r\nsogers to put down dem Secesh; dat we should all hab our freedom, our\r\nwages, an\' some kind ob money. I couldn\'t call it like he did."\r\n\r\n"Bounty money," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dat\'s jis\' what he called it, bounty money. An\' I said dat I war\r\nin for dat, teeth and toe-nails."\r\n\r\nRobert Johnson\'s heart gave a great bound. Was that so? Had that army,\r\nwith freedom emblazoned on its banners, come at last to offer them\r\ndeliverance if they would accept it? Was it a bright, beautiful dream,\r\nor a blessed reality soon to be grasped by his willing hands? His heart\r\ngrew buoyant with hope; the lightness of his heart gave elasticity to\r\nhis step and sent the blood rejoicingly through his veins. Freedom was\r\nalmost in his grasp, and the future was growing rose-tinted and\r\nrainbow-hued. All the ties which bound him to his home were as ropes of\r\nsand, now that freedom had come so near.\r\n\r\nWhen the army was afar off, he had appeared to be light-hearted and\r\ncontent with his lot. If asked if he desired his freedom, he would have\r\nanswered, very naively, that he was eating his white bread and believed\r\nin letting well enough alone; he had no intention of jumping from the\r\nfrying-pan into the fire. But in the depths of his soul the love of\r\nfreedom was an all-absorbing passion; only danger had taught him\r\ncaution. He had heard of terrible vengeance being heaped upon the heads\r\nof some who had sought their freedom and failed in the attempt. Robert\r\nknew that he might abandon hope if he incurred the wrath of men whose\r\noverthrow was only a question of time. It would have been madness and\r\nfolly for him to have attempted an insurrection against slavery, with\r\nthe words of McClellan ringing in his ears: "If you rise I shall put you\r\ndown with an iron hand," and with the home guards ready to quench his\r\naspirations for freedom with bayonets and blood. What could a set of\r\nunarmed and undisciplined men do against the fearful odds which beset\r\ntheir path?\r\n\r\nRobert waited eagerly and hopefully his chance to join the Union army;\r\nand was ready and willing to do anything required of him by which he\r\ncould earn his freedom and prove his manhood. He conducted his plans\r\nwith the greatest secrecy. A few faithful and trusted friends stood\r\nready to desert with him when the Union army came within hailing\r\ndistance. When it came, there was a stampede to its ranks of men ready\r\nto serve in any capacity, to labor in the tents, fight on the fields, or\r\nact as scouts. It was a strange sight to see these black men rallying\r\naround the Stars and Stripes, when white men were trampling them under\r\nfoot and riddling them with bullets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELEASE OF IOLA LEROY.\r\n\r\n"Well, boys," said Robert to his trusted friends, as they gathered\r\ntogether at a meeting in Gundover\'s woods, almost under the shadow of\r\nthe Union army, "how many of you are ready to join the army and fight\r\nfor your freedom."\r\n\r\n"All ob us."\r\n\r\n"The soldiers," continued Robert, "are camped right at the edge of the\r\ntown. The General has his headquarters in the heart of the town, and one\r\nof the officers told me yesterday that the President had set us all\r\nfree, and that as many as wanted to join the army could come along to\r\nthe camp. So I thought, boys, that I would come and tell you. Now, you\r\ncan take your bag and baggage, and get out of here as soon as you\r\nchoose."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be ready by daylight," said Tom. "It won\'t take me long to pack\r\nup," looking down at his seedy clothes, with a laugh. "I specs ole\r\nMarse\'ll be real lonesome when I\'m gone. An\' won\'t he be hoppin\' mad\r\nwhen he finds I\'m a goner? I specs he\'ll hate it like pizen."\r\n\r\n"O, well," said Robert, "the best of friends must part. Don\'t let it\r\ngrieve you."\r\n\r\n"I\'se gwine to take my wife an\' chillen," said one of the company.\r\n\r\n"I\'se got nobody but myself," said Tom; "but dere\'s a mighty putty\r\nyoung gal dere at Marse Tom\'s. I wish I could git her away. Dey tells me\r\ndey\'s been sellin\' her all ober de kentry; but dat she\'s a reg\'lar\r\nspitfire; dey can\'t lead nor dribe her."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she would go with us?" said Robert.\r\n\r\n"I think she\'s jis\' dying to go. Dey say dey can\'t do nuffin wid her.\r\nMarse Tom\'s got his match dis time, and I\'se glad ob it. I jis\' glories\r\nin her spunk."\r\n\r\n"How did she come there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Marse bought her ob de trader to keep house for him. But ef you\r\nseed dem putty white han\'s ob hern you\'d never tink she kept her own\r\nhouse, let \'lone anybody else\'s."\r\n\r\n"Do you think you can get her away?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; \'cause Marse Tom keeps her mighty close. My! but she\'s\r\nputty. Beautiful long hair comes way down her back; putty blue eyes, an\'\r\njis\' ez white ez anybody\'s in dis place. I\'d jis\' wish you could see her\r\nyoresef. I heerd Marse Tom talkin\' \'bout her las\' night to his brudder;\r\ntellin\' him she war mighty airish, but he meant to break her in."\r\n\r\nAn angry curse rose to the lips of Robert, but he repressed it and\r\nmuttered to himself, "Graceless scamp, he ought to have his neck\r\nstretched." Then turning to Tom, said:--\r\n\r\n"Get her, if you possibly can, but you must be mighty mum about it."\r\n\r\n"Trus\' me for dat," said Tom.\r\n\r\nTom was very anxious to get word to the beautiful but intractable girl\r\nwho was held in durance vile by her reckless and selfish master, who had\r\ntried in vain to drag her down to his own low level of sin and shame.\r\nBut all Tom\'s efforts were in vain. Finally he applied to the Commander\r\nof the post, who immediately gave orders for her release. The next day\r\nTom had the satisfaction of knowing that Iola Leroy had been taken as a\r\ntrembling dove from the gory vulture\'s nest and given a place of\r\nsecurity. She was taken immediately to the General\'s headquarters. The\r\nGeneral was much impressed by her modest demeanor, and surprised to see\r\nthe refinement and beauty she possessed. Could it be possible that this\r\nyoung and beautiful girl had been a chattel, with no power to protect\r\nherself from the highest insults that lawless brutality could inflict\r\nupon innocent and defenseless womanhood? Could he ever again glory in\r\nhis American citizenship, when any white man, no matter how coarse,\r\ncruel, or brutal, could buy or sell her for the basest purposes? Was it\r\nnot true that the cause of a hapless people had become entangled with\r\nthe lightnings of heaven, and dragged down retribution upon the land?\r\n\r\nThe field hospital was needing gentle, womanly ministrations, and Iola\r\nLeroy, released from the hands of her tormentors, was given a place as\r\nnurse; a position to which she adapted herself with a deep sense of\r\nrelief. Tom was doubly gratified at the success of his endeavors, which\r\nhad resulted in the rescue of the beautiful young girl and the\r\ndiscomfiture of his young master who, in the words of Tom, "was mad\r\nenough to bite his head off" (a rather difficult physical feat).\r\n\r\nIola, freed from her master\'s clutches, applied herself readily to her\r\nappointed tasks. The beautiful, girlish face was full of tender\r\nearnestness. The fresh, young voice was strangely sympathetic, as if\r\nsome great sorrow had bound her heart in loving compassion to every\r\nsufferer who needed her gentle ministrations.\r\n\r\nTom Anderson was a man of herculean strength and remarkable courage.\r\nBut, on account of physical defects, instead of enlisting as a soldier,\r\nhe was forced to remain a servant, although he felt as if every nerve in\r\nhis right arm was tingling to strike a blow for freedom. He was well\r\nversed in the lay of the country, having often driven his master\'s\r\ncotton to market when he was a field hand. After he became a coachman,\r\nhe had become acquainted with the different roads and localities of the\r\ncountry. Besides, he had often accompanied his young masters on their\r\nhunting and fishing expeditions. Although he could not fight in the\r\narmy, he proved an invaluable helper. When tents were to be pitched,\r\nnone were more ready to help than he. When burdens were to be borne,\r\nnone were more willing to bend beneath them than Thomas Anderson. When\r\nthe battle-field was to be searched for the wounded and dying, no hand\r\nwas more tender in its ministrations of kindness than his. As a general\r\nfactotum in the army, he was ever ready and willing to serve anywhere\r\nand at any time, and to gather information from every possible source\r\nwhich could be of any service to the Union army. As a Pagan might\r\nworship a distant star and wish to call it his own, so he loved Iola.\r\nAnd he never thought he could do too much for the soldiers who had\r\nrescued her and were bringing deliverance to his race.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of Miss Iola?" Robert asked him one day, as they were\r\ntalking together.\r\n\r\n"I jis\' think dat she\'s splendid. Las\' week I had to take some of our\r\npore boys to de hospital, an\' she war dere, lookin\' sweet an\' putty ez\r\nan angel, a nussin\' dem pore boys, an\' ez good to one ez de oder. It\r\nlooks to me ez ef dey ralely lob\'d her shadder. She sits by \'em so\r\npatient, an\' writes \'em sech nice letters to der frens, an\' yit she\r\nlooks so heart-broke an\' pitiful, it jis\' gits to me, an\' makes me mos\'\r\nready to cry. I\'m so glad dat Marse Tom had to gib her up. He war too\r\nmean to eat good victuals."\r\n\r\n"He ought," said Robert, "to be made to live on herrings\' heads and cold\r\npotatoes. It makes my blood boil just to think that he was going to have\r\nthat lovely looking young girl whipped for his devilment. He ought to be\r\nashamed to hold up his head among respectable people."\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Bob, de debil will neber git his own till he gits him. When\r\nI seed how he war treating her I neber rested till I got her away. He\r\nbuyed her, he said, for his housekeeper; as many gals as dere war on de\r\nplantation, why didn\'t he git one ob dem to keep house, an\' not dat nice\r\nlookin\' young lady? Her han\'s look ez ef she neber did a day\'s work in\r\nher life. One day when he com\'d down to breakfas,\' he chucked her under\r\nde chin, an\' tried to put his arm roun\' her waist. But she jis\' frew it\r\noff like a chunk ob fire. She looked like a snake had bit her. Her eyes\r\nfairly spit fire. Her face got red ez blood, an\' den she turned so pale\r\nI thought she war gwine to faint, but she didn\'t, an\' I yered her say,\r\n\'I\'ll die fust.\' I war mad \'nough to stan\' on my head. I could hab\r\ntore\'d him all to pieces wen he said he\'d hab her whipped."\r\n\r\n"Did he do it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But he\'s mean \'nough to do enythin\'. Why, dey say she\r\nwar sole seben times in six weeks, \'cause she\'s so putty, but dat she\r\nwar game to de las\'."\r\n\r\n"Well, Tom," said Robert, "getting that girl away was one of the best\r\nthings you ever did in your life."\r\n\r\n"I think so, too. Not dat I specs enytin\' ob it. I don\'t spose she would\r\nthink ob an ugly chap like me; but it does me good to know dat Marse Tom\r\nain\'t got her."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT JOHNSON\'S PROMOTION AND RELIGION.\r\n\r\nRobert Johnson, being able to meet the army requirements, was enlisted\r\nas a substitute to help fill out the quota of a Northern regiment. With\r\nhis intelligence, courage, and prompt obedience, he rose from the ranks\r\nand became lieutenant of a colored company. He was daring, without being\r\nrash; prompt, but not thoughtless; firm, without being harsh. Kind and\r\ndevoted to the company he drilled, he soon won the respect of his\r\nsuperior officers and the love of his comrades.\r\n\r\n"Johnson," said a young officer, Captain Sybil, of Maine, who had become\r\nattached to Robert, "what is the use of your saying you\'re a colored\r\nman, when you are as white as I am, and as brave a man as there is among\r\nus. Why not quit this company, and take your place in the army just the\r\nsame as a white man? I know your chances for promotion would be better."\r\n\r\n"Captain, you may doubt my word, but to-day I would rather be a\r\nlieutenant in my company than a captain in yours."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"Well, Captain, when a man\'s been colored all his life it comes a little\r\nhard for him to get white all at once. Were I to try it, I would feel\r\nlike a cat in a strange garret. Captain, I think my place is where I am\r\nmost needed. You do not need me in your ranks, and my company does.\r\nThey are excellent fighters, but they need a leader. To silence a\r\nbattery, to capture a flag, to take a fortification, they will rush into\r\nthe jaws of death."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have often wondered at their bravery."\r\n\r\n"Captain, these battles put them on their mettle. They have been so long\r\ntaught that they are nothing and nobody, that they seem glad to prove\r\nthey are something and somebody."\r\n\r\n"But, Johnson, you do not look like them, you do not talk like them. It\r\nis a burning shame to have held such a man as you in slavery."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it was any worse to have held me in slavery than the\r\nblackest man in the South."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Johnson. The color of a man\'s skin has nothing to do\r\nwith the possession of his rights."\r\n\r\n"Now, there is Tom Anderson," said Robert, "he is just as black as black\r\ncan be. He has been bought and sold like a beast, and yet there is not a\r\nbraver man in all the company. I know him well. He is a noble-hearted\r\nfellow. True as steel. I love him like a brother. And I believe Tom\r\nwould risk his life for me any day. He don\'t know anything about his\r\nfather or mother. He was sold from them before he could remember. He can\r\nread a little. He used to take lessons from a white gardener in\r\nVirginia. He would go between the hours of 9 P.M. and 4 A.M. He got a\r\nbook of his own, tore it up, greased the pages, and hid them in his hat.\r\nThen if his master had ever knocked his hat off he would have thought\r\nthem greasy papers, and not that Tom was carrying his library on his\r\nhead. I had another friend who lived near us. When he was nineteen\r\nyears old he did not know how many letters there were in the ABC\'s. One\r\nnight, when his work was done, his boss came into his cabin and saw him\r\nwith a book in his hand. He threatened to give him five hundred lashes\r\nif he caught him again with a book, and said he hadn\'t work enough to\r\ndo. He was getting out logs, and his task was ten logs a day. His\r\nemployer threatened to increase it to twelve. He said it just harassed\r\nhim; it set him on fire. He thought there must be something good in that\r\nbook if the white man didn\'t want him to learn. One day he had an errand\r\nin the kitchen, and he heard one of the colored girls going over the\r\nABC\'s. Here was the key to the forbidden knowledge. She had heard the\r\nwhite children saying them, and picked them up by heart, but did not\r\nknow them by sight. He was not content with that, but sold his cap for a\r\nbook and wore a cloth on his head instead. He got the sounds of the\r\nletters by heart, then cut off the bark of a tree, carved the letters on\r\nthe smooth inside, and learned them. He wanted to learn how to write. He\r\nhad charge of a warehouse where he had a chance to see the size and form\r\nof letters. He made the beach of the river his copybook, and thus he\r\nlearned to write. Tom never got very far with his learning, but I used\r\nto get the papers and tell him all I knew about the war."\r\n\r\n"How did you get the papers?"\r\n\r\n"I used to have very good privileges for a slave. All of our owners were\r\nnot alike. Some of them were quite clever, and others were worse than\r\ngit out. I used to get the morning papers to sell to the boarders and\r\nothers, and when I got them I would contrive to hide a paper, and let\r\nsome of the fellow-servants know how things were going on. And our\r\nowners thought we cared nothing about what was going on."\r\n\r\n"How was that? I thought you were not allowed to hold meetings unless a\r\nwhite man were present."\r\n\r\n"That was so. But we contrived to hold secret meetings in spite of their\r\ncaution. We knew whom we could trust. My ole Miss wasn\'t mean like some\r\nof them. She never wanted the patrollers around prowling in our cabins,\r\nand poking their noses into our business. Her husband was an awful\r\ndrunkard. He ran through every cent he could lay his hands on, and she\r\nwas forced to do something to keep the wolf from the door, so she set up\r\na boarding-house. But she didn\'t take in Tom, Dick, and Harry. Nobody\r\nbut the big bugs stopped with her. She taught me to read and write, and\r\nto cast up accounts. It was so handy for her to have some one who could\r\nfigure up her accounts, and read or write a note, if she were from home\r\nand wanted the like done. She once told her cousin how I could write and\r\nfigure up. And what do you think her cousin said?"\r\n\r\n"\'Pleased,\' I suppose, \'to hear it.\'"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it. She said, if I belonged to her, she would cut off my\r\nthumbs; her husband said, \'Oh, then he couldn\'t pick cotton.\' As to my\r\npoor thumbs, it did not seem to be taken into account what it would cost\r\nme to lose them. My ole Miss used to have a lot of books. She would let\r\nme read any one of them except a novel. She wanted to take care of my\r\nsoul, but she wasn\'t taking care of her own."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t she religious?"\r\n\r\n"She went for it. I suppose she was as good as most of them. She said\r\nher prayers and went to church, but I don\'t know that that made her any\r\nbetter. I never did take much stock in white folks\' religion."\r\n\r\n"Why, Robert, I\'m afraid you are something of an infidel."\r\n\r\n"No, Captain, I believe in the real, genuine religion. I ain\'t got much\r\nmyself, but I respect them that have. We had on our place a dear, old\r\nsaint, named Aunt Kizzy. She was a happy soul. She had seen hard times,\r\nbut was what I call a living epistle. I\'ve heard her tell how her only\r\nchild had been sold from her, when the man who bought herself did not\r\nwant to buy her child. Poor little fellow! he was only two years old. I\r\nasked her one day how she felt when her child was taken away. \'I felt,\'\r\nshe said, \'as if I was going to my grave. But I knew if I couldn\'t get\r\njustice here, I could get it in another world.\'"\r\n\r\n"That was faith," said Captain Sybil, as if speaking to himself, "a\r\npatient waiting for death to redress the wrongs of life."\r\n\r\n"Many a time," continued Robert, "have I heard her humming to herself in\r\nthe kitchen and saying, \'I has my trials, ups and downs, but it won\'t\r\nallers be so. I specs one day to wing and wing wid de angels,\r\nHallelujah! Den I specs to hear a voice sayin\', "Poor ole Kizzy, she\'s\r\ndone de bes\' she kin. Go down, Gabriel, an\' tote her in." Den I specs to\r\nput on my golden slippers, my long white robe, an\' my starry crown, an\'\r\nwalk dem golden streets, Hallelujah!\' I\'ve known that dear, old soul to\r\ntravel going on two miles, after her work was done, to have some one\r\nread to her. Her favorite chapter began with, \'Let not your heart be\r\ntroubled, ye believe in God, believe also in Me.\'"\r\n\r\n"I have been deeply impressed," said Captain Sybil, "with the child-like\r\nfaith of some of these people. I do not mean to say that they are\r\nconsistent Christians, but I do think that this faith has in a measure\r\nunderlain the life of the race. It has been a golden thread woven amid\r\nthe sombre tissues of their lives. A ray of light shimmering amid the\r\ngloom of their condition. And what would they have been without it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. But I know what she was with it. And I believe if there\r\nare any saints in glory, Aunt Kizzy is one of them."\r\n\r\n"She is dead, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, went all right, singing and rejoicing until the last,\r\n\'Troubles over, troubles over, and den my troubles will be over. We\'ll\r\nwalk de golden streets all \'roun\' in de New Jerusalem.\' Now, Captain,\r\nthat\'s the kind of religion that I want. Not that kind which could ride\r\nto church on Sundays, and talk so solemn with the minister about heaven\r\nand good things, then come home and light down on the servants like a\r\nthousand of bricks. I have no use for it. I don\'t believe in it. I never\r\ndid and I never will. If any man wants to save my soul he ain\'t got to\r\nbeat my body. That ain\'t the kind of religion I\'m looking for. I ain\'t\r\ngot a bit of use for it. Now, Captain, ain\'t I right?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, Robert, I think you are more than half right. You ought to\r\nknow my dear, old mother who lives in Maine. We have had colored company\r\nat our house, and I never saw her show the least difference between her\r\ncolored and white guests. She is a Quaker preacher, and don\'t believe\r\nin war, but when the rest of the young men went to the front, I wanted\r\nto go also. So I thought it all over, and there seemed to be no way out\r\nof slavery except through the war. I had been taught to hate war and\r\ndetest slavery. Now the time had come when I could not help the war, but\r\nI could strike a blow for freedom. So I told my mother I was going to\r\nthe front, that I expected to be killed, but I went to free the slave.\r\nIt went hard with her. But I thought that I ought to come, and I believe\r\nmy mother\'s prayers are following me."\r\n\r\n"Captain," said Robert, rising, "I am glad that I have heard your story.\r\nI think that some of these Northern soldiers do two things--hate slavery\r\nand hate niggers."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that is so with some of them. They would rather be whipped\r\nby Rebels than conquer with negroes. Oh, I heard a soldier," said\r\nCaptain Sybil, "say, when the colored men were being enlisted, that he\r\nwould break his sword and resign. But he didn\'t do either. After Colonel\r\nShaw led his charge at Fort Wagner, and died in the conflict, he got\r\nbravely over his prejudices. The conduct of the colored troops there and\r\nelsewhere has done much to turn public opinion in their favor. I suppose\r\nany white soldier would rather have his black substitute receive the\r\nbullets than himself."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM ANDERSON\'S DEATH.\r\n\r\n"Where is Tom?" asked Captain Sybil; "I have not seen him for several\r\nhours."\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone down the sound with some of the soldiers," replied Robert.\r\n"They wanted Tom to row them."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid those boys will get into trouble, and the Rebs will pick\r\nthem off," responded Sybil.\r\n\r\n"O, I hope not," answered Robert.\r\n\r\n"I hope not, too; but those boys are too venturesome."\r\n\r\n"Tom knows the lay of the land better than any of us," said Robert. "He\r\nis the most wide-awake and gamiest man I know. I reckon when the war is\r\nover Tom will be a preacher. Did you ever hear him pray?"\r\n\r\n"No; is he good at that?"\r\n\r\n"First-rate," continued Robert. "It would do you good to hear him. He\r\ndon\'t allow any cursing and swearing when he\'s around. And what he says\r\nis law and gospel with the boys. But he\'s so good-natured; and they\r\ncan\'t get mad at him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Robert, there is not a man in our regiment I would sooner trust\r\nthan Tom. Last night, when he brought in that wounded scout, he couldn\'t\r\nhave been more tender if he had been a woman. How gratefully the poor\r\nfellow looked in Tom\'s face as he laid him down so carefully and\r\nstaunched the blood which had been spurting out of him. Tom seemed to\r\nknow it was an artery which had been cut, and he did just the right\r\nthing to stop the bleeding. He knew there wasn\'t a moment to be lost. He\r\nwasn\'t going to wait for the doctor. I have often heard that colored\r\npeople are ungrateful, but I don\'t think Tom\'s worst enemy would say\r\nthat about him."\r\n\r\n"Captain," said Robert, with a tone of bitterness in his voice, "what\r\nhad we to be grateful for? For ages of poverty, ignorance, and slavery?\r\nI think if anybody should be grateful, it is the people who have\r\nenslaved us and lived off our labor for generations. Captain, I used to\r\nknow a poor old woman who couldn\'t bear to hear any one play on the\r\npiano."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? Why, I always heard that colored people were a musical\r\nrace."\r\n\r\n"So we are; but that poor woman\'s daughter was sold, and her mistress\r\ntook the money to buy a piano. Her mother could never bear to hear a\r\nsound from it."\r\n\r\n"Poor woman!" exclaimed Captain Sybil, sympathetically; "I suppose it\r\nseemed as if the wail of her daughter was blending with the tones of the\r\ninstrument. I think, Robert, there is a great deal more in the colored\r\npeople than we give them credit for. Did you know Captain Sellers?"\r\n\r\n"The officer who escaped from prison and got back to our lines?" asked\r\nRobert.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Well, he had quite an experience in trying to escape. He came to\r\nan aged couple, who hid him in their cabin and shared their humble food\r\nwith him. They gave him some corn-bread, bacon, and coffee which he\r\nthought was made of scorched bran. But he said that he never ate a meal\r\nthat he relished more than the one he took with them. Just before he\r\nwent they knelt down and prayed with him. It seemed as if his very hair\r\nstood on his head, their prayer was so solemn. As he was going away the\r\nman took some shingles and nailed them on his shoes to throw the\r\nbloodhounds off his track. I don\'t think he will ever cease to feel\r\nkindly towards colored people. I do wonder what has become of the boys?\r\nWhat can keep them so long?"\r\n\r\nJust as Captain Sybil and Robert were wondering at the delay of Tom and\r\nthe soldiers they heard the measured tread of men who were slowly\r\nbearing a burden. They were carrying Tom Anderson to the hospital,\r\nfearfully wounded, and nigh to death. His face was distorted, and the\r\nblood was streaming from his wounds. His respiration was faint, his\r\npulse hurried, as if life were trembling on its frailest cords.\r\n\r\nRobert and Captain Sybil hastened at once towards the wounded man. On\r\nRobert\'s face was a look of intense anguish, as he bent pityingly over\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n"O, this is dreadful! How did it happen?" cried Robert.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sybil, pressing anxiously forward, repeated Robert\'s question.\r\n\r\n"Captain," said one of the young soldiers, advancing and saluting his\r\nsuperior officer, "we were all in the boat when it struck against a mud\r\nbank, and there was not strength enough among us to shove her back into\r\nthe water. Just then the Rebels opened fire upon us. For awhile we lay\r\ndown in the boat, but still they kept firing. Tom took in the whole\r\nsituation, and said: \'Someone must die to get us out of this. I\r\nmought\'s well be him as any. You are soldiers and can fight. If they\r\nkill me, it is nuthin\'.\' So Tom leaped out to shove the boat into the\r\nwater. Just then the Rebel bullets began to rain around him. He received\r\nseven or eight of them, and I\'m afraid there is no hope for him."\r\n\r\n"O, Tom, I wish you hadn\'t gone. O, Tom! Tom!" cried Robert, in tones of\r\nagony.\r\n\r\nA gleam of grateful recognition passed over the drawn features of Tom,\r\nas the wail of his friend fell on his ear. He attempted to speak, but\r\nthe words died upon his lips, and he became unconscious.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Captain Sybil, "put him in one of the best wards. Give him\r\ninto Miss Leroy\'s care. If good nursing can win him back to life, he\r\nshall not want for any care or pains that she can bestow. Send\r\nimmediately for Dr. Gresham."\r\n\r\nRobert followed his friend into the hospital, tenderly and carefully\r\nhelped to lay him down, and remained awhile, gazing in silent grief upon\r\nthe sufferer. Then he turned to go, leaving him in the hands of Iola,\r\nbut hoping against hope that his wounds would not be fatal.\r\n\r\nWith tender devotion Iola watched her faithful friend. He recognized her\r\nwhen restored to consciousness, and her presence was as balm to his\r\nwounds. He smiled faintly, took her hand in his, stroked it tenderly,\r\nlooked wistfully into her face, and said, "Miss Iola, I ain\'t long fer\r\ndis! I\'se \'most home!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Iola, "I hope that you will soon get over this trouble,\r\nand live many long and happy days."\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Iola, it\'s all ober wid me. I\'se gwine to glory; gwine to\r\nglory; gwine to ring dem charmin\' bells. Tell all de boys to meet me in\r\nheben; dat dey mus\' \'list in de hebenly war."\r\n\r\n"O, Mr. Tom," said Iola, tenderly, "do not talk of leaving me. You are\r\nthe best friend I have had since I was torn from my mother. I should be\r\nso lonely without you."\r\n\r\n"Dere\'s a frien\' dat sticks closer dan a brudder. He will be wid yer in\r\nde sixt\' trial, an\' in de sebbent\' he\'ll not fo\'sake yer."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Iola, "I know that. He is all our dependence. But I\r\ncan\'t help grieving when I see you suffering so. But, dear friend, be\r\nquiet, and try to go to sleep."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do enythin\' fer yer, Miss Iola."\r\n\r\nTom closed his eyes and lay quiet. Tenderly and anxiously Iola watched\r\nover him as the hours waned away. The doctor came, shook his head\r\ngravely, and, turning to Iola, said, "There is no hope, but do what you\r\ncan to alleviate his sufferings."\r\n\r\nAs Iola gazed upon the kind but homely features of Tom, she saw his eyes\r\nopen and an unexpressed desire upon his face.\r\n\r\nTenderly and sadly bending over him, with tears in her dark, luminous\r\neyes, she said, "Is there anything I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Tom, with laboring breath; "let me hole yore han\', an\' sing\r\n\'Ober Jordan inter glory\' an\' \'We\'ll anchor bye and bye.\'"\r\n\r\nIola laid her hand gently in the rough palm of the dying man, and, with\r\na tremulous voice, sang the parting hymns.\r\n\r\nTenderly she wiped the death damps from his dusky brow, and imprinted\r\nupon it a farewell kiss. Gratitude and affection lit up the dying eye,\r\nwhich seemed to be gazing into the eternities. Just then Robert entered\r\nthe room, and, seating himself quietly by Tom\'s bedside, read the death\r\nsigns in his face.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Robert," said Tom, "meet me in de kingdom." Suddenly a look\r\nof recognition and rapture lit up his face, and he murmured, "Angels,\r\nbright angels, all\'s well, all\'s well!"\r\n\r\nSlowly his hand released its pressure, a peaceful calm overspread his\r\ncountenance, and without a sigh or murmur Thomas Anderson, Iola\'s\r\nfaithful and devoted friend, passed away, leaving the world so much\r\npoorer for her than it was before. Just then Dr. Gresham, the hospital\r\nphysician, came to the bedside, felt for the pulse which would never\r\nthrob again, and sat down in silence by the cot.\r\n\r\n"What do you think, Doctor," said Iola, "has he fainted?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the doctor, "poor fellow! he is dead."\r\n\r\nIola bowed her head in silent sorrow, and then relieved the anguish of\r\nher heart by a flood of tears. Robert rose, and sorrowfully left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIola, with tearful eyes and aching heart, clasped the cold hands over\r\nthe still breast, closed the waxen lid over the eye which had once\r\nbeamed with kindness or flashed with courage, and then went back, after\r\nthe burial, to her daily round of duties, feeling the sad missing of\r\nsomething from her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTIFIED DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n"Colonel," said Dr. Gresham to Col. Robinson, the commander of the post,\r\n"I am perfectly mystified by Miss Leroy."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with her?" asked Col. Robinson. "Is she not faithful\r\nto her duties and obedient to your directions?"\r\n\r\n"Faithful is not the word to express her tireless energy and devotion to\r\nher work," responded Dr. Gresham. "She must have been a born nurse to\r\nput such enthusiasm into her work."\r\n\r\n"Why, Doctor, what is the matter with you? You talk like a lover."\r\n\r\nA faint flush rose to the cheek of Dr. Gresham as he smiled, and said,\r\n"Oh! come now, Colonel, can\'t a man praise a woman without being in love\r\nwith her?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he can," said Col. Robinson; "but I know where such\r\nadmiration is apt to lead. I\'ve been there myself. But, Doctor, had you\r\nnot better defer your love-making till you\'re out of the woods?"\r\n\r\n"I assure you, Colonel, I am not thinking of love or courtship. That is\r\nthe business of the drawing-room, and not of the camp. But she did\r\nmystify me last night."\r\n\r\n"How so?" asked Col. Robinson.\r\n\r\n"When Tom was dying," responded the doctor, "I saw that beautiful and\r\nrefined young lady bend over and kiss him. When she found that he was\r\ndead, she just cried as if her heart was breaking. Well, that was a new\r\nthing to me. I can eat with colored people, walk, talk, and fight with\r\nthem, but kissing them is something I don\'t hanker after."\r\n\r\n"And yet you saw Miss Leroy do it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and that puzzles me. She is one of the most refined and lady-like\r\nwomen I ever saw. I hear she is a refugee, but she does not look like\r\nthe other refugees who have come to our camp. Her accent is slightly\r\nSouthern, but her manner is Northern. She is self-respecting without\r\nbeing supercilious; quiet, without being dull. Her voice is low and\r\nsweet, yet at times there are tones of such passionate tenderness in it\r\nthat you would think some great sorrow has darkened and overshadowed her\r\nlife. Without being the least gloomy, her face at times is pervaded by\r\nan air of inexpressible sadness. I sometimes watch her when she is not\r\naware that I am looking at her, and it seems as if a whole volume was\r\ndepicted on her countenance. When she smiles, there is a longing in her\r\neyes which is never satisfied. I cannot understand how a Southern lady,\r\nwhose education and manners stamp her as a woman of fine culture and\r\ngood breeding, could consent to occupy the position she so faithfully\r\nholds. It is a mystery I cannot solve. Can you?"\r\n\r\n"I think I can," answered Col. Robinson.\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me?" queried the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on one condition."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Everlasting silence."\r\n\r\n"I promise," said the doctor. "The secret between us shall be as deep as\r\nthe sea."\r\n\r\n"She has not requested secrecy, but at present, for her sake, I do not\r\nwish the secret revealed. Miss Leroy was a slave."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Dr. Gresham, starting to his feet, "it can\'t be so! A\r\nwoman as white as she a slave?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is so," continued the Colonel. "In these States the child\r\nfollows the condition of its mother. This beautiful and accomplished\r\ngirl was held by one of the worst Rebels in town. Tom told me of it and\r\nI issued orders for her release."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! Is that so?" said Dr. Gresham, thoughtfully stroking his\r\nbeard. "Wonders will never cease. Why, I was just beginning to think\r\nseriously of her."\r\n\r\n"What\'s to hinder your continuing to think?" asked Col. Robinson.\r\n\r\n"What you tell me changes the whole complexion of affairs," replied the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"If that be so I am glad I told you before you got head over heels in\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Gresham, absently.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham was a member of a wealthy and aristocratic family, proud of\r\nits lineage, which it could trace through generations of good blood to\r\nits ancestral isle. He had become deeply interested in Iola before he\r\nhad heard her story, but after it had been revealed to him he tried to\r\nbanish her from his mind; but his constant observation of her only\r\nincreased his interest and admiration. The deep pathos of her story, the\r\ntenderness of her ministrations, bestowed alike on black and white, and\r\nthe sad loneliness of her condition, awakened within him a desire to\r\ndefend and protect her all through her future life. The fierce clashing\r\nof war had not taken all the romance out of his nature. In Iola he saw\r\nrealized his ideal of the woman whom he was willing to marry. A woman,\r\ntender, strong, and courageous, and rescued only by the strong arm of\r\nhis Government from a fate worse than death. She was young in years, but\r\nold in sorrow; one whom a sad destiny had changed from a light-hearted\r\ngirl to a heroic woman. As he observed her, he detected an undertone of\r\nsorrow in her most cheerful words, and observed a quick flushing and\r\nsudden paling of her cheek, as if she were living over scenes that were\r\nthrilling her soul with indignation or chilling her heart with horror.\r\nAs nurse and physician, Iola and Dr. Gresham were constantly thrown\r\ntogether. His friends sent him magazines and books, which he gladly\r\nshared with her. The hospital was a sad place. Mangled forms, stricken\r\ndown in the flush of their prime and energy; pale young corpses,\r\nsacrificed on the altar of slavery, constantly drained on her\r\nsympathies. Dr. Gresham was glad to have some reading matter which might\r\ndivert her mind from the memories of her mournful past, and also furnish\r\nthem both with interesting themes of conversation in their moments of\r\nrelaxation from the harrowing scenes through which they were constantly\r\npassing. Without any effort or consciousness on her part, his friendship\r\nripened into love. To him her presence was a pleasure, her absence a\r\nprivation; and her loneliness drew deeply upon his sympathy. He would\r\nhave merited his own self-contempt if, by word or deed, he had done\r\nanything to take advantage of her situation. All the manhood and\r\nchivalry of his nature rose in her behalf, and, after carefully\r\nrevolving the matter, he resolved to win her for his bride, bury her\r\nsecret in his Northern home, and hide from his aristocratic relations\r\nall knowledge of her mournful past. One day he said to Iola:--\r\n\r\n"This hospital life is telling on you. Your strength is failing, and\r\nalthough you possess a wonderful amount of physical endurance, you must\r\nnot forget that saints have bodies and dwell in tabernacles of clay,\r\njust the same as we common mortals."\r\n\r\n"Compliments aside," she said, smiling; "what are you driving at,\r\nDoctor?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," he replied, "that you are running down, and if you do not quit\r\nand take some rest you will be our patient instead of our nurse. You\'d\r\nbetter take a furlough, go North, and return after the first frost."\r\n\r\n"Doctor, if that is your only remedy," replied Iola, "I am afraid that I\r\nam destined to die at my post. I have no special friends in the North,\r\nand no home but this in the South. I am homeless and alone."\r\n\r\nThere was something so sad, almost despairing in her tones, in the\r\ndrooping of her head, and the quivering of her lip, that they stirred\r\nDr. Gresham\'s heart with sudden pity, and, drawing nearer to her, he\r\nsaid, "Miss Leroy, you need not be all alone. Let me claim the privilege\r\nof making your life bright and happy. Iola, I have loved you ever since\r\nI have seen your devotion to our poor, sick boys. How faithfully you, a\r\nyoung and gracious girl, have stood at your post and performed your\r\nduties. And now I ask, will you not permit me to clasp hands with you\r\nfor life? I do not ask for a hasty reply. Give yourself time to think\r\nover what I have proposed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUGENE LEROY AND ALFRED LORRAINE.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty years before the war, two young men, of French and Spanish\r\ndescent, sat conversing on a large verandah which surrounded an ancient\r\nhome on the Mississippi River. It was French in its style of\r\narchitecture, large and rambling, with no hint of modern improvements.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the house was the only heir of a Creole planter. He had\r\ncome into possession of an inheritance consisting of vast baronial\r\nestates, bank stock, and a large number of slaves. Eugene Leroy, being\r\ndeprived of his parents, was left, at an early age, to the care of a\r\ndistant relative, who had sent him to school and college, and who\r\noccasionally invited him to spend his vacations at his home. But Eugene\r\ngenerally declined his invitations, as he preferred spending his\r\nvacations at the watering places in the North, with their fashionable\r\nand not always innocent gayeties. Young, vivacious, impulsive, and\r\nundisciplined, without the restraining influence of a mother\'s love or\r\nthe guidance of a father\'s hand, Leroy found himself, when his college\r\ndays were over, in the dangerous position of a young man with vast\r\npossessions, abundant leisure, unsettled principles, and uncontrolled\r\ndesires. He had no other object than to extract from life its most\r\nseductive draughts of ease and pleasure. His companion, who sat opposite\r\nhim on the verandah, quietly smoking a cigar, was a remote cousin, a\r\nfew years older than himself, the warmth of whose Southern temperament\r\nhad been modified by an infusion of Northern blood.\r\n\r\nEugene was careless, liberal, and impatient of details, while his\r\ncompanion and cousin, Alfred Lorraine, was selfish, eager, keen, and\r\nalert; also hard, cold, methodical, and ever ready to grasp the main\r\nchance. Yet, notwithstanding the difference between them, they had\r\nformed a warm friendship for each other.\r\n\r\n"Alfred," said Eugene, "I am going to be married."\r\n\r\nLorraine opened his eyes with sudden wonder, and exclaimed: "Well,\r\nthat\'s the latest thing out! Who is the fortunate lady who has bound you\r\nwith her silken fetters? Is it one of those beautiful Creole girls who\r\nwere visiting Augustine\'s plantation last winter? I watched you during\r\nour visit there and thought that you could not be proof against their\r\nattractions. Which is your choice? It would puzzle me to judge between\r\nthe two. They had splendid eyes, dark, luminous, and languishing; lovely\r\ncomplexions and magnificent hair. Both were delightful in their manners,\r\nrefined and cultured, with an air of vivacity mingled with their repose\r\nof manner which was perfectly charming. As the law only allows us one,\r\nwhich is your choice? Miss Annette has more force than her sister, and\r\nif I could afford the luxury of a wife she would be my choice."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Alf," said Eugene, "I see that you are a practical business man. In\r\nmarrying you want a wife to assist you as an efficient plantation\r\nmistress. One who would tolerate no waste in the kitchen and no disorder\r\nin the parlor."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," responded Lorraine; "I am too poor to marry a mere parlor\r\nornament. You can afford to do it; I cannot."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, if I were as poor as a church mouse I would marry the woman I\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"Very fine sentiments," said Lorraine, "and were I as rich as you I\r\nwould indulge in them also. You know, when my father died I had great\r\nexpectations. We had always lived in good style, and I never thought for\r\na moment he was not a rich man, but when his estate was settled I found\r\nit was greatly involved, and I was forced to face an uncertain future,\r\nwith scarcely a dollar to call my own. Land, negroes, cattle, and horses\r\nall went under the hammer. The only thing I retained was the education I\r\nreceived at the North; that was my father\'s best investment, and all my\r\nstock in trade. With that only as an outfit, it would be madness for me\r\nto think of marrying one of those lovely girls. They remind me of\r\nbeautiful canary birds, charming and pretty, but not fitted for the wear\r\nand tear of plantation life. Well, which is your choice?"\r\n\r\n"Neither," replied Eugene.\r\n\r\n"Then, is it that magnificent looking widow from New Orleans, whom we\r\nmet before you had that terrible spell of sickness and to whom you\r\nappeared so devoted?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all. I have not heard from her since that summer. She was\r\nfascinating and handsome, but fearfully high strung."\r\n\r\n"Were you afraid of her?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I valued my happiness too much to trust it in her hands."\r\n\r\n"Sour grapes!" said Lorraine.\r\n\r\n"No! but I think that slavery and the lack of outside interests are\r\nbeginning to tell on the lives of our women. They lean too much on their\r\nslaves, have too much irresponsible power in their hands, are narrowed\r\nand compressed by the routine of plantation life and the lack of\r\nintellectual stimulus."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Eugene, when I see what other women are doing in the fields of\r\nliterature and art, I cannot help thinking an amount of brain power has\r\nbeen held in check among us. Yet I cannot abide those Northern women,\r\nwith their suffrage views and abolition cant. They just shock me."\r\n\r\n"But your mother was a Northern woman," said Eugene.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but she got bravely over her Northern ideas. As I remember her,\r\nshe was just as much a Southerner as if she had been to the manor born.\r\nShe came here as a school-teacher, but soon after she came she married\r\nmy father. He was easy and indulgent with his servants, and held them\r\nwith a very loose rein. But my mother was firm and energetic. She made\r\nthe niggers move around. No shirking nor dawdling with her. When my\r\nfather died, she took matters in hand, but she only outlived him a few\r\nmonths. If she had lived I believe that she would have retrieved our\r\nfortune. I know that she had more executive ability than my father. He\r\nwas very squeamish about selling his servants, but she would have put\r\nevery one of them in her pocket before permitting them to eat her out of\r\nhouse and home. But whom _are_ you going to marry?"\r\n\r\n"A young lady who graduates from a Northern seminary next week,"\r\nresponded Eugene.\r\n\r\n"I think you are very selfish," said Lorraine. "You might have invited\r\na fellow to go with you to be your best man."\r\n\r\n"The wedding is to be strictly private. The lady whom I am to marry has\r\nnegro blood in her veins."\r\n\r\n"The devil she has!" exclaimed Lorraine, starting to his feet, and\r\nlooking incredulously on the face of Leroy. "Are you in earnest? Surely\r\nyou must be jesting."\r\n\r\n"I am certainly in earnest," answered Eugene Leroy. "I mean every word I\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it can\'t be possible! Are you mad?" exclaimed Lorraine.\r\n\r\n"Never was saner in my life."\r\n\r\n"What under heaven could have possessed you to do such a foolish thing?\r\nWhere did she come from."\r\n\r\n"Right here, on this plantation. But I have educated and manumitted her,\r\nand I intend marrying her."\r\n\r\n"Why, Eugene, it is impossible that you can have an idea of marrying one\r\nof your slaves. Why, man, she is your property, to have and to hold to\r\nall intents and purposes. Are you not satisfied with the power and\r\npossession the law gives you?"\r\n\r\n"No. Although the law makes her helpless in my hands, to me her\r\ndefenselessness is her best defense."\r\n\r\n"Eugene, we have known each other all of our lives, and, although I have\r\nalways regarded you as eccentric, I never saw you so completely off your\r\nbalance before. The idea of you, with your proud family name, your vast\r\nwealth in land and negroes, intending to marry one of them, is a mystery\r\nI cannot solve. Do explain to me why you are going to take this\r\nextremely strange and foolish step."\r\n\r\n"You never saw Marie?"\r\n\r\n"No; and I don\'t want to."\r\n\r\n"She is very beautiful. In the North no one would suspect that she has\r\none drop of negro blood in her veins, but here, where I am known, to\r\nmarry her is to lose caste. I could live with her, and not incur much if\r\nany social opprobrium. Society would wink at the transgression, even if\r\nafter she had become the mother of my children I should cast her off and\r\nsend her and them to the auction block."\r\n\r\n"Men," replied Lorraine, "would merely shrug their shoulders; women\r\nwould say you had been sowing your wild oats. Your money, like charity,\r\nwould cover a multitude of faults."\r\n\r\n"But if I make her my lawful wife and recognize her children as my\r\nlegitimate heirs, I subject myself to social ostracism and a senseless\r\npersecution. We Americans boast of freedom, and yet here is a woman whom\r\nI love as I never loved any other human being, but both law and public\r\nopinion debar me from following the inclination of my heart. She is\r\nbeautiful, faithful, and pure, and yet all that society will tolerate is\r\nwhat I would scorn to do."\r\n\r\n"But has not society the right to guard the purity of its blood by the\r\nrigid exclusion of an alien race?"\r\n\r\n"Excluding it! How?" asked Eugene.\r\n\r\n"By debarring it from social intercourse."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it has," continued Eugene, "but should not society have a\r\ngreater ban for those who, by consorting with an alien race, rob their\r\noffspring of a right to their names and to an inheritance in their\r\nproperty, and who fix their social status among an enslaved and outcast\r\nrace? Don\'t eye me so curiously; I am not losing my senses."\r\n\r\n"I think you have done that already," said Lorraine. "Don\'t you know\r\nthat if she is as fair as a lily, beautiful as a houri, and chaste as\r\nice, that still she is a negro?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now; she isn\'t much of a negro."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter, however. One drop of negro blood in her veins curses\r\nall the rest."\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Eugene, sadly, "but I have weighed the consequences,\r\nand am prepared to take them."\r\n\r\n"Well, Eugene, your course is _so_ singular! I do wish that you would\r\ntell me why you take this unprecedented step?"\r\n\r\nEugene laid aside his cigar, looked thoughtfully at Lorraine, and said,\r\n"Well, Alfred, as we are kinsmen and life-long friends, I will not\r\nresent your asking my reason for doing that which seems to you the\r\nclimax of absurdity, and if you will have the patience to listen I will\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"Proceed, I am all attention."\r\n\r\n"My father died," said Eugene, "as you know, when I was too young to\r\nknow his loss or feel his care and, being an only child, I was petted\r\nand spoiled. I grew up to be wayward, self-indulgent, proud, and\r\nimperious. I went from home and made many friends both at college and in\r\nforeign lands. I was well supplied with money and, never having been\r\nforced to earn it, was ignorant of its value and careless of its use. My\r\nlavish expenditures and liberal benefactions attracted to me a number\r\nof parasites, and men older than myself led me into the paths of vice,\r\nand taught me how to gather the flowers of sin which blossom around the\r\nborders of hell. In a word, I left my home unwarned and unarmed against\r\nthe seductions of vice. I returned an initiated devotee to debasing\r\npleasures. Years of my life were passed in foreign lands; years in which\r\nmy soul slumbered and seemed pervaded with a moral paralysis; years, the\r\nmemory of which fills my soul with sorrow and shame. I went to the\r\ncapitals of the old world to see life, but in seeing life I became\r\nacquainted with death, the death of true manliness and self-respect. You\r\nlook astonished; but I tell you, Alf, there is many a poor clod-hopper,\r\non whom are the dust and grime of unremitting toil, who feels more\r\nself-respect and true manliness than many of us with our family\r\nprestige, social position, and proud ancestral halls. After I had lived\r\nabroad for years, I returned a broken-down young man, prematurely old,\r\nmy constitution a perfect wreck. A life of folly and dissipation was\r\ntelling fearfully upon me. My friends shrank from me in dismay. I was\r\nsick nigh unto death, and had it not been for Marie\'s care I am certain\r\nthat I should have died. She followed me down to the borders of the\r\ngrave, and won me back to life and health. I was slow in recovering and,\r\nduring the time, I had ample space for reflection, and the past unrolled\r\nitself before me. I resolved, over the wreck and ruin of my past life,\r\nto build a better and brighter future. Marie had a voice of remarkable\r\nsweetness, although it lacked culture. Often when I was nervous and\r\nrestless I would have her sing some of those weird and plaintive\r\nmelodies which she had learned from the plantation negroes. Sometimes I\r\nencouraged her to talk, and I was surprised at the native vigor of her\r\nintellect. By degrees I became acquainted with her history. She was all\r\nalone in the world. She had no recollection of her father, but\r\nremembered being torn from her mother while clinging to her dress. The\r\ntrader who bought her mother did not wish to buy her. She remembered\r\nhaving a brother, with whom she used to play, but she had been separated\r\nfrom him also, and since then had lost all trace of them. After she was\r\nsold from her mother she became the property of an excellent old lady,\r\nwho seems to have been very careful to imbue her mind with good\r\nprinciples; a woman who loved purity, not only for her own daughters,\r\nbut also for the defenseless girls in her home. I believe it was the\r\nlady\'s intention to have freed Marie at her death, but she died\r\nsuddenly, and, the estate being involved, she was sold with it and fell\r\ninto the hands of my agent. I became deeply interested in her when I\r\nheard her story, and began to pity her."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose love sprang from pity."\r\n\r\n"I not only pitied her, but I learned to respect her. I had met with\r\nbeautiful women in the halls of wealth and fashion, both at home and\r\nabroad, but there was something in her different from all my experience\r\nof womanhood."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," said Lorraine, with a sneer; "but I should like to\r\nknow what it was."\r\n\r\n"It was something such as I have seen in old cathedrals, lighting up the\r\nbeauty of a saintly face. A light which the poet tells was never seen on\r\nland or sea. I thought of this beautiful and defenseless girl adrift in\r\nthe power of a reckless man, who, with all the advantages of wealth and\r\neducation, had trailed his manhood in the dust, and she, with simple,\r\nchildlike faith in the Unseen, seemed to be so good and pure that she\r\ncommanded my respect and won my heart. In her presence every base and\r\nunholy passion died, subdued by the supremacy of her virtue."\r\n\r\n"Why, Eugene, what has come over you? Talking of the virtue of these\r\nquadroon girls! You have lived so long in the North and abroad, that you\r\nseem to have lost the cue of our Southern life. Don\'t you know that\r\nthese beautiful girls have been the curse of our homes? You have no idea\r\nof the hearts which are wrung by their presence."\r\n\r\n"But, Alfred, suppose it is so. Are they to blame for it? What can any\r\nwoman do when she is placed in the hands of an irresponsible master;\r\nwhen she knows that resistance is vain? Yes, Alfred, I agree with you,\r\nthese women are the bane of our Southern civilization; but they are the\r\nvictims and we are the criminals."\r\n\r\n"I think from the airs that some of them put on when they get a chance,\r\nthat they are very willing victims."\r\n\r\n"So much the worse for our institution. If it is cruel to debase a\r\nhapless victim, it is an increase of cruelty to make her contented with\r\nher degradation. Let me tell you, Alf, you cannot wrong or degrade a\r\nwoman without wronging or degrading yourself."\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with you, Eugene? Are you thinking of taking\r\npriest\'s orders?"\r\n\r\n"No, Alf," said Eugene, rising and rapidly pacing the floor, "you may\r\ndefend the system as much as you please, but you cannot deny that the\r\ncircumstances it creates, and the temptations it affords, are sapping\r\nour strength and undermining our character."\r\n\r\n"That may be true," said Lorraine, somewhat irritably, "but you had\r\nbetter be careful how you air your Northern notions in public."\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because public opinion is too sensitive to tolerate any such\r\ndiscussions."\r\n\r\n"And is not that a proof that we are at fault with respect to our\r\ninstitutions?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I only know we are living in the midst of a magazine of\r\npowder, and it is not safe to enter it with a lighted candle."\r\n\r\n"Let me proceed with my story," continued Eugene. "During the long\r\nmonths in which I was convalescing, I was left almost entirely to the\r\ncompanionship of Marie. In my library I found a Bible, which I began to\r\nread from curiosity, but my curiosity deepened into interest when I saw\r\nthe rapt expression on Marie\'s face. I saw in it a loving response to\r\nsentiments to which I was a stranger. In the meantime my conscience was\r\nawakened, and I scorned to take advantage of her defenselessness. I felt\r\nthat I owed my life to her faithful care, and I resolved to take her\r\nNorth, manumit, educate, and marry her. I sent her to a Northern\r\nacademy, but as soon as some of the pupils found that she was colored,\r\nobjections were raised, and the principal was compelled to dismiss her.\r\nDuring my search for a school I heard of one where three girls of mixed\r\nblood were pursuing their studies, every one of whom would have been\r\nignominiously dismissed had their connection with the negro race been\r\nknown. But I determined to run no risks. I found a school where her\r\nconnection with the negro race would be no bar to her advancement. She\r\ngraduates next week, and I intend to marry her before I return home. She\r\nwas faithful when others were faithless, stood by me when others\r\ndeserted me to die in loneliness and neglect, and now I am about to\r\nreward her care with all the love and devotion it is in my power to\r\nbestow. That is why I am about to marry my faithful and devoted nurse,\r\nwho snatched me from the jaws of death. Now that I have told you my\r\nstory, what say you?"\r\n\r\n"Madness and folly inconceivable!" exclaimed Lorraine.\r\n\r\n"What to you is madness and folly is perfect sanity with me. After all,\r\nAlf, is there not an amount of unreason in our prejudices?"\r\n\r\n"That may be true; but I wasn\'t reasoned into it, and I do not expect to\r\nbe reasoned out of it."\r\n\r\n"Will you accompany me North?"\r\n\r\n"No; except to put you in an insane asylum. You are the greatest crank\r\nout," said Lorraine, thoroughly disgusted.\r\n\r\n"No, thank you; I\'m all right. I expect to start North to-morrow. You\r\nhad better come and go."\r\n\r\n"I would rather follow you to your grave," replied Lorraine, hotly,\r\nwhile an expression of ineffable scorn passed over his cold, proud face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADOWS IN THE HOME.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning after this conversation Leroy left for the North, to\r\nattend the commencement and witness the graduation of his ward. Arriving\r\nin Ohio, he immediately repaired to the academy and inquired for the\r\nprincipal. He was shown into the reception-room, and in a few moments\r\nthe principal entered.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," said Leroy, rising and advancing towards him; "how is my\r\nward this morning?"\r\n\r\n"She is well, and has been expecting you. I am glad you came in time for\r\nthe commencement. She stands among the foremost in her class."\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear it. Will you send her this?" said Leroy, handing the\r\nprincipal a card. The principal took the card and immediately left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nVery soon Leroy heard a light step, and looking up he saw a radiantly\r\nbeautiful woman approaching him.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Marie," he said, greeting her cordially, and gazing upon\r\nher with unfeigned admiration. "You are looking very handsome this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" she asked, smiling and blushing. "I am glad you are\r\nnot disappointed; that you do not feel your money has been spent in\r\nvain."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, what I have spent on your education has been the best\r\ninvestment I ever made."\r\n\r\n"I hope," said Marie, "you may always find it so. But Mas----"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Leroy, laying his hand playfully on her lips; "you are\r\nfree. I don\'t want the dialect of slavery to linger on your lips. You\r\nmust not call me that name again."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have a nearer and dearer one by which I wish to be called."\r\n\r\nLeroy drew her nearer, and whispered in her ear a single word. She\r\nstarted, trembled with emotion, grew pale, and blushed painfully. An\r\nawkward silence ensued, when Leroy, pressing her hand, exclaimed: "This\r\nis the hand that plucked me from the grave, and I am going to retain it\r\nas mine; mine to guard with my care until death us do part."\r\n\r\nLeroy looked earnestly into her eyes, which fell beneath his ardent\r\ngaze. With admirable self-control, while a great joy was thrilling her\r\nheart, she bowed her beautiful head and softly repeated, "Until death us\r\ndo part."\r\n\r\nLeroy knew Southern society too well to expect it to condone his offense\r\nagainst its social customs, or give the least recognition to his wife,\r\nhowever cultured, refined, and charming she might be, if it were known\r\nthat she had the least infusion of negro blood in her veins. But he was\r\nbrave enough to face the consequences of his alliance, and marry the\r\nwoman who was the choice of his heart, and on whom his affections were\r\ncentred.\r\n\r\nAfter Leroy had left the room, Marie sat awhile thinking of the\r\nwonderful change that had come over her. Instead of being a lonely slave\r\ngirl, with the fatal dower of beauty, liable to be bought and sold,\r\nexchanged, and bartered, she was to be the wife of a wealthy planter; a\r\nman in whose honor she could confide, and on whose love she could lean.\r\n\r\nVery interesting and pleasant were the commencement exercises in which\r\nMarie bore an important part. To enlist sympathy for her enslaved race,\r\nand appear to advantage before Leroy, had aroused all of her energies.\r\nThe stimulus of hope, the manly love which was environing her life,\r\nbrightened her eye and lit up the wonderful beauty of her countenance.\r\nDuring her stay in the North she had constantly been brought in contact\r\nwith anti-slavery people. She was not aware that there was so much\r\nkindness among the white people of the country until she had tested it\r\nin the North. From the anti-slavery people in private life she had\r\nlearned some of the noblest lessons of freedom and justice, and had\r\nbecome imbued with their sentiments. Her theme was "American\r\nCivilization, its Lights and Shadows."\r\n\r\nGraphically she portrayed the lights, faithfully she showed the shadows\r\nof our American civilization. Earnestly and feelingly she spoke of the\r\nblind Sampson in our land, who might yet shake the pillars of our great\r\nCommonwealth. Leroy listened attentively. At times a shadow of annoyance\r\nwould overspread his face, but it was soon lost in the admiration her\r\nearnestness and zeal inspired. Like Esther pleading for the lives of her\r\npeople in the Oriental courts of a despotic king, she stood before the\r\naudience, pleading for those whose lips were sealed, but whose condition\r\nappealed to the mercy and justice of the Nation. Strong men wiped the\r\nmoisture from their eyes, and women\'s hearts throbbed in unison with the\r\nstrong, brave words that were uttered in behalf of freedom for all and\r\nchains for none. Generous applause was freely bestowed, and beautiful\r\nbouquets were showered upon her. When it was known that she was to be\r\nthe wife of her guardian, warm congratulations were given, and earnest\r\nhopes expressed for the welfare of the lonely girl, who, nearly all her\r\nlife, had been deprived of a parent\'s love and care. On the eve of\r\nstarting South Leroy procured a license, and united his destiny with the\r\nyoung lady whose devotion in the darkest hour had won his love and\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Marie returned as mistress to the plantation from which\r\nshe had gone as a slave. But as unholy alliances were common in those\r\ndays between masters and slaves, no one took especial notice that Marie\r\nshared Leroy\'s life as mistress of his home, and that the family silver\r\nand jewelry were in her possession. But Leroy, happy in his choice,\r\nattended to the interests of his plantation, and found companionship in\r\nhis books and in the society of his wife. A few male companions visited\r\nhim occasionally, admired the magnificent beauty of his wife, shook\r\ntheir heads, and spoke of him as being very eccentric, but thought his\r\nmarriage the great mistake of his life. But none of his female friends\r\never entered his doors, when it became known that Marie held the\r\nposition of mistress of his mansion, and presided at his table. But she,\r\nsheltered in the warm clasp of loving arms, found her life like a joyous\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nInto that quiet and beautiful home three children were born, unconscious\r\nof the doom suspended over their heads.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how glad I am," Marie would often say, "that these children are\r\nfree. I could never understand how a cultured white man could have his\r\nown children enslaved. I can understand how savages, fighting with each\r\nother, could doom their vanquished foes to slavery, but it has always\r\nbeen a puzzle to me how a civilized man could drag his own children,\r\nbone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, down to the position of social\r\noutcasts, abject slaves, and political pariahs."\r\n\r\n"But, Marie," said Eugene, "all men do not treat their illegitimate\r\nchildren in the manner you describe. The last time I was in New Orleans\r\nI met Henri Augustine at the depot, with two beautiful young girls. At\r\nfirst I thought that they were his own children, they resembled him so\r\nclosely. But afterwards I noticed that they addressed him as \'Mister.\'\r\nBefore we parted he told me that his wife had taken such a dislike to\r\ntheir mother that she could not bear to see them on the place. At last,\r\nweary of her dissatisfaction, he had promised to bring them to New\r\nOrleans and sell them. Instead, he was going to Ohio to give them their\r\nfreedom, and make provision for their future."\r\n\r\n"What a wrong!" said Marie.\r\n\r\n"Who was wronged?" said Leroy, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Every one in the whole transaction," answered Marie. "Your friend\r\nwronged himself by sinning against his own soul. He wronged his wife by\r\narousing her hatred and jealousy through his unfaithfulness. He wronged\r\nthose children by giving them the _status_ of slaves and outcasts. He\r\nwronged their mother by imposing upon her the burdens and cares of\r\nmaternity without the rights and privileges of a wife. He made her crown\r\nof motherhood a circlet of shame. Under other circumstances she might\r\nhave been an honored wife and happy mother. And I do think such men\r\nwrong their own legitimate children by transmitting to them a weakened\r\nmoral fibre."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Marie, you have such an uncomfortable way of putting things. You\r\nmake me feel that we have done those things which we ought not to have\r\ndone, and have left undone those things which we ought to have done."\r\n\r\n"If it annoys you," said Marie, "I will stop talking."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, go on," said Leroy, carelessly; and then he continued more\r\nthoughtfully, "I know a number of men who have sent such children North,\r\nand manumitted, educated, and left them valuable legacies. We are all\r\nliable to err, and, having done wrong, all we can do is to make\r\nreparation."\r\n\r\n"My dear husband, this is a wrong where reparation is impossible.\r\nNeither wealth nor education can repair the wrong of a dishonored birth.\r\nThere are a number of slaves in this section who are servants to their\r\nown brothers and sisters; whose fathers have robbed them not simply of\r\nliberty but of the right of being well born. Do you think these things\r\nwill last forever?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. There are some prophets of evil who tell us that the\r\nUnion is going to dissolve. But I know it would puzzle their brains to\r\ntell where the crack will begin. I reckon we\'ll continue to jog along as\r\nusual. \'Cotton fights, and cotton conquers for American slavery.\'"\r\n\r\nEven while Leroy dreamed of safety the earthquake was cradling its fire;\r\nthe ground was growing hollow beneath his tread; but his ear was too\r\ndull to catch the sound; his vision too blurred to read the signs of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n"Marie," said Leroy, taking up the thread of the discourse, "slavery is\r\na sword that cuts both ways. If it wrongs the negro, it also curses the\r\nwhite man. But we are in it, and what can we do?"\r\n\r\n"Get out of it as quickly as possible."\r\n\r\n"That is easier said than done. I would willingly free every slave on my\r\nplantation if I could do so without expatriating them. Some of them have\r\nwives and children on other plantations, and to free them is to separate\r\nthem from their kith and kin. To let them remain here as a free people\r\nis out of the question. My hands are tied by law and custom."\r\n\r\n"Who tied them?" asked Marie.\r\n\r\n"A public opinion, whose meshes I cannot break. If the negro is the\r\nthrall of his master, we are just as much the thralls of public\r\nopinion."\r\n\r\n"Why do you not battle against public opinion, if you think it is\r\nwrong?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have neither the courage of a martyr, nor the faith of a\r\nsaint; and so I drift along, trying to make the condition of our slaves\r\nas comfortable as I possibly can. I believe there are slaves on this\r\nplantation whom the most flattering offers of freedom would not entice\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"I do not think," said Marie, "that some of you planters understand your\r\nown slaves. Lying is said to be the vice of slaves. The more intelligent\r\nof them have so learned to veil their feelings that you do not see the\r\nundercurrent of discontent beneath their apparent good humor and\r\njollity. The more discontented they are, the more I respect them. To me\r\na contented slave is an abject creature. I hope that I shall see the\r\nday when there will not be a slave in the land. I hate the whole thing\r\nfrom the bottom of my heart."\r\n\r\n"Marie, your Northern education has unfitted you for Southern life. You\r\nare free, yourself, and so are our children. Why not let well enough\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\n"Because I love liberty, not only for myself but for every human being.\r\nThink how dear these children are to me; and then for the thought to be\r\nforever haunting me, that if you were dead they could be turned out of\r\ndoors and divided among your relatives. I sometimes lie awake at night\r\nthinking of how there might be a screw loose somewhere, and, after all,\r\nthe children and I might be reduced to slavery."\r\n\r\n"Marie, what in the world is the matter with you? Have you had a\r\npresentiment of my death, or, as Uncle Jack says, \'hab you seed it in a\r\nvision?\'"\r\n\r\n"No, but I have had such sad forebodings that they almost set me wild.\r\nOne night I dreamt that you were dead; that the lawyers entered the\r\nhouse, seized our property, and remanded us to slavery. I never can be\r\nsatisfied in the South with such a possibility hanging over my head."\r\n\r\n"Marie, dear, you are growing nervous. Your imagination is too active.\r\nYou are left too much alone on this plantation. I hope that for your own\r\nand the children\'s sake I will be enabled to arrange our affairs so as\r\nto find a home for you where you will not be doomed to the social\r\nisolation and ostracism that surround you here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind the isolation for myself, but the children. You have\r\nenjoined silence on me with respect to their connection with the negro\r\nrace, but I do not think we can conceal it from them very long. It will\r\nnot be long before Iola will notice the offishness of girls of her own\r\nage, and the scornful glances which, even now, I think, are leveled at\r\nher. Yesterday Harry came crying to me, and told me that one of the\r\nneighbor\'s boys had called him \'nigger.\'"\r\n\r\nA shadow flitted over Leroy\'s face, as he answered, somewhat soberly,\r\n"Oh, Marie, do not meet trouble half way. I have manumitted you, and the\r\nchildren will follow your condition. I have made you all legatees of my\r\nwill. Except my cousin, Alfred Lorraine, I have only distant relatives,\r\nwhom I scarcely know and who hardly know me."\r\n\r\n"Your cousin Lorraine? Are you sure our interests would be safe in his\r\nhands?"\r\n\r\n"I think so; I don\'t think Alfred would do anything dishonorable."\r\n\r\n"He might not with his equals. But how many men would be bound by a\r\nsense of honor where the rights of a colored woman are in question? Your\r\ncousin was bitterly opposed to our marriage, and I would not trust any\r\nimportant interests in his hands. I do hope that in providing for our\r\nfuture you will make assurance doubly sure."\r\n\r\n"I certainly will, and all that human foresight can do shall be done for\r\nyou and our children."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Marie, pressing to her heart a beautiful child of six\r\nsummers, "I think it would almost make me turn over in my grave to know\r\nthat every grace and charm which this child possesses would only be so\r\nmuch added to her value as an article of merchandise."\r\n\r\nAs Marie released the child from her arms she looked wonderingly into\r\nher mother\'s face and clung closely to her, as if to find refuge from\r\nsome unseen evil. Leroy noticed this, and sighed unconsciously, as an\r\nexpression of pain flitted over his face.\r\n\r\n"Now, Marie," he continued, "stop tormenting yourself with useless\r\nfears. Although, with all her faults, I still love the South, I will\r\nmake arrangements either to live North or go to France. There life will\r\nbe brighter for us all. Now, Marie, seat yourself at the piano and\r\nsing:--\r\n\r\n    \'Sing me the songs that to me were so dear,\r\n            Long, long ago.\r\n     Sing me the songs I delighted to hear,\r\n            Long, long ago."\r\n\r\nAs Marie sang the anxiety faded from her face, a sense of security stole\r\nover her, and she sat among her loved ones a happy wife and mother. What\r\nif no one recognized her on that lonely plantation! Her world was,\r\nnevertheless, there. The love and devotion of her husband brightened\r\nevery avenue of her life, while her children filled her home with music,\r\nmirth, and sunshine.\r\n\r\nMarie had undertaken their education, but she could not give them the\r\nculture which comes from the attrition of thought, and from contact with\r\nthe ideas of others. Since her school-days she had read extensively and\r\nthought much, and in solitude her thoughts had ripened. But for her\r\nchildren there were no companions except the young slaves of the\r\nplantation, and she dreaded the effect of such intercourse upon their\r\nlives and characters.\r\n\r\nLeroy had always been especially careful to conceal from his children\r\nthe knowledge of their connection with the negro race. To Marie this\r\nsilence was oppressive.\r\n\r\nOne day she said to him, "I see no other way of finishing the education\r\nof these children than by sending them to some Northern school."\r\n\r\n"I have come," said Leroy, "to the same conclusion. We had better take\r\nIola and Harry North and make arrangements for them to spend several\r\nyears in being educated. Riches take wings to themselves and fly away,\r\nbut a good education is an investment on which the law can place no\r\nattachment. As there is a possibility of their origin being discovered,\r\nI will find a teacher to whom I can confide our story, and upon whom I\r\ncan enjoin secrecy. I want them well fitted for any emergency in life.\r\nWhen I discover for what they have the most aptitude I will give them\r\nespecial training in that direction."\r\n\r\nA troubled look passed over the face of Marie, as she hesitatingly said:\r\n"I am so afraid that you will regret our marriage when you fully realize\r\nthe complications it brings."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Leroy, tenderly, "it is not that I regret our marriage,\r\nor feel the least disdain for our children on account of the blood in\r\ntheir veins; but I do not wish them to grow up under the contracting\r\ninfluence of this race prejudice. I do not wish them to feel that they\r\nhave been born under a proscription from which no valor can redeem them,\r\nnor that any social advancement or individual development can wipe off\r\nthe ban which clings to them. No, Marie, let them go North, learn all\r\nthey can, aspire all they may. The painful knowledge will come all too\r\nsoon. Do not forestall it. I want them simply to grow up as other\r\nchildren; not being patronized by friends nor disdained by foes."\r\n\r\n"My dear husband, you may be perfectly right, but are you not preparing\r\nour children for a fearful awakening? Are you not acting on the plan,\r\n\'After me the deluge?\'"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, Marie. I want our children to grow up without having their\r\nself-respect crushed in the bud. You know that the North is not free\r\nfrom racial prejudice."\r\n\r\n"I know it," said Marie, sadly, "and I think one of the great mistakes\r\nof our civilization is that which makes color, and not character, a\r\nsocial test."\r\n\r\n"I think so, too," said Leroy. "The strongest men and women of a\r\ndown-trodden race may bare their bosoms to an adverse fate and develop\r\ncourage in the midst of opposition, but we have no right to subject our\r\nchildren to such crucial tests before their characters are formed. For\r\nyears, when I lived abroad, I had an opportunity to see and hear of men\r\nof African descent who had distinguished themselves and obtained a\r\nrecognition in European circles, which they never could have gained in\r\nthis country. I now recall the name of Ira Aldridge, a colored man from\r\nNew York City, who was covered with princely honors as a successful\r\ntragedian. Alexander Dumas was not forced to conceal his origin to\r\nsucceed as a novelist. When I was in St. Petersburg I was shown the\r\nworks of Alexander Sergevitch, a Russian poet, who was spoken of as the\r\nByron of Russian literature, and reckoned one of the finest poets that\r\nRussia has produced in this century. He was also a prominent figure in\r\nfashionable society, and yet he was of African lineage. One of his\r\npaternal ancestors was a negro who had been ennobled by Peter the\r\nGreat. I can\'t help contrasting the recognition which these men had\r\nreceived with the treatment which has been given to Frederick Douglass\r\nand other intelligent colored men in this country. With me the wonder is\r\nnot that they have achieved so little, but that they have accomplished\r\nso much. No, Marie, we will have our children educated without being\r\nsubjected to the depressing influences of caste feeling. Perhaps by the\r\ntime their education is finished I will be ready to wind up my affairs\r\nand take them abroad, where merit and ability will give them entrance\r\ninto the best circles of art, literature, and science."\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation Leroy and his wife went North, and succeeded in\r\nfinding a good school for their children. In a private interview he\r\nconfided to the principal the story of the cross in their blood, and,\r\nfinding him apparently free from racial prejudice, he gladly left the\r\nchildren in his care. Gracie, the youngest child, remained at home, and\r\nher mother spared no pains to fit her for the seminary against the time\r\nher sister should have finished her education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE AND THE LAW.\r\n\r\nYears passed, bringing no special change to the life of Leroy and his\r\nwife. Shut out from the busy world, its social cares and anxieties,\r\nMarie\'s life flowed peacefully on. Although removed by the protecting\r\ncare of Leroy from the condition of servitude, she still retained a deep\r\nsympathy for the enslaved, and was ever ready to devise plans to\r\nameliorate their condition.\r\n\r\nLeroy, although in the midst of slavery, did not believe in the\r\nrightfulness of the institution. He was in favor of gradual\r\nemancipation, which would prepare both master and slave for a moral\r\nadaptation to the new conditions of freedom. While he was willing to\r\nhave the old rivets taken out of slavery, politicians and planters were\r\ndevising plans to put in new screws. He was desirous of having it ended\r\nin the States; they were clamorous to have it established in the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nBut so strong was the force of habit, combined with the feebleness of\r\nhis moral resistance and the nature of his environment, that instead of\r\nbeing an athlete, armed for a glorious strife, he had learned to drift\r\nwhere he should have steered, to float with the current instead of nobly\r\nbreasting the tide. He conducted his plantation with as much lenity as\r\nit was possible to infuse into a system darkened with the shadow of a\r\nmillion crimes.\r\n\r\nLeroy had always been especially careful not to allow his children to\r\nspend their vacations at home. He and Marie generally spent that time\r\nwith them at some summer resort.\r\n\r\n"I would like," said Marie, one day, "to have our children spend their\r\nvacations at home. Those summer resorts are pleasant, yet, after all,\r\nthere is no place like home. But," and her voice became tremulous, "our\r\nchildren would now notice their social isolation and inquire the cause."\r\nA faint sigh arose to the lips of Leroy, as she added: "Man is a social\r\nbeing; I\'ve known it to my sorrow."\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of sadness in Leroy\'s voice, as he replied: "Yes,\r\nMarie, let them stay North. We seem to be entering on a period fraught\r\nwith great danger. I cannot help thinking and fearing that we are on the\r\neve of a civil war."\r\n\r\n"A civil war!" exclaimed Marie, with an air of astonishment. "A civil\r\nwar about what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Marie, the thing looks to me so wild and foolish I hardly know how\r\nto explain. But some of our leading men have come to the conclusion that\r\nNorth and South had better separate, and instead of having one to have\r\ntwo independent governments. The spirit of secession is rampant in the\r\nland. I do not know what the result will be, and I fear it will bode no\r\ngood to the country. Between the fire-eating Southerners and the\r\nmeddling Abolitionists we are about to be plunged into a great deal of\r\ntrouble. I fear there are breakers ahead. The South is dissatisfied with\r\nthe state of public opinion in the North. We are realizing that we are\r\ntwo peoples in the midst of one nation. William H. Seward has\r\nproclaimed that the conflict between freedom and slavery is\r\nirrepressible, and that the country cannot remain half free and half\r\nslave."\r\n\r\n"How will _you_ go?" asked Marie.\r\n\r\n"My heart is with the Union. I don\'t believe in secession. There has\r\nbeen no cause sufficient to justify a rupture. The North has met us time\r\nand again in the spirit of concession and compromise. When we wanted the\r\ncontinuance of the African slave trade the North conceded that we should\r\nhave twenty years of slave-trading for the benefit of our plantations.\r\nWhen we wanted more territory she conceded to our desires and gave us\r\nland enough to carve out four States, and there yet remains enough for\r\nfour more. When we wanted power to recapture our slaves when they fled\r\nNorth for refuge, Daniel Webster told Northerners to conquer their\r\nprejudices, and they gave us the whole Northern States as a hunting\r\nground for our slaves. The Presidential chair has been filled the\r\ngreater number of years by Southerners, and the majority of offices has\r\nbeen shared by our men. We wanted representation in Congress on a basis\r\nwhich would include our slaves, and the North, whose suffrage represents\r\nonly men, gave us a three-fifths representation for our slaves, whom we\r\ncount as property. I think the step will be suicidal. There are\r\nextremists in both sections, but I hope, between them both, wise\r\ncounsels and measures will prevail."\r\n\r\nJust then Alfred Lorraine was ushered into the room. Occasionally he\r\nvisited Leroy, but he always came alone. His wife was the only daughter\r\nof an enterprising slave-trader, who had left her a large amount of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nHer social training was deficient, her education limited, but she was\r\ntoo proud of being a pure white woman to enter the home of Leroy, with\r\nMarie as its presiding genius. Lorraine tolerated Marie\'s presence as a\r\nnecessary evil, while to her he always seemed like a presentiment of\r\ntrouble. With his coming a shadow fell upon her home, hushing its music\r\nand darkening its sunshine. A sense of dread oppressed her. There came\r\ninto her soul an intuitive feeling that somehow his coming was fraught\r\nwith danger. When not peering around she would often catch his eyes bent\r\non her with a baleful expression.\r\n\r\nLeroy and his cousin immediately fell into a discussion on the condition\r\nof the country. Lorraine was a rank Secessionist, ready to adopt the\r\nmost extreme measures of the leaders of the movement, even to the\r\nreopening of the slave trade. Leroy thought a dissolution of the Union\r\nwould involve a fearful expenditure of blood and treasure for which,\r\nbefore the eyes of the world, there could be no justification. The\r\ndebate lasted late into the night, leaving both Lorraine and Leroy just\r\nas set in their opinions as they were before they began. Marie listened\r\nattentively awhile, then excused herself and withdrew.\r\n\r\nAfter Lorraine had gone Marie said: "There is something about your\r\ncousin that fills me with nameless dread. I always feel when he enters\r\nthe room as if some one were walking over my grave. I do wish he would\r\nstay at home."\r\n\r\n"I wish so, too, since he disturbs you. But, Marie, you are growing\r\nnervous. How cold your hands are. Don\'t you feel well?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I am only a little faint. I wish he would never come. But, as\r\nhe does, I must make the best of it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Marie, treat him well for my sake. He is the only relative I have\r\nwho ever darkens our doors."\r\n\r\n"I have no faith in his friendship for either myself or my children. I\r\nfeel that while he makes himself agreeable to you he hates me from the\r\nbottom of his heart, and would do anything to get me out of the way. Oh,\r\nI am _so_ glad I am your lawful wife, and that you married me before you\r\nbrought me back to this State! I believe that if you were gone he\r\nwouldn\'t have the least scruple against trying to prove our marriage\r\ninvalid and remanding us to slavery."\r\n\r\nLeroy looked anxiously and soberly at his wife, and said: "Marie, I do\r\nnot think so. Your life is too lonely here. Write your orders to New\r\nOrleans, get what you need for the journey, and let us spend the summer\r\nsomewhere in the North."\r\n\r\nJust then Marie\'s attention was drawn to some household matters, and it\r\nwas a short time before she returned.\r\n\r\n"Tom," continued Leroy, "has just brought the mail, and here is a letter\r\nfrom Iola."\r\n\r\nMarie noticed that he looked quite sober as he read, and that an\r\nexpression of vexation was lingering on his lips.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" asked Marie.\r\n\r\n"Nothing much; only a tempest in a teapot. The presence of a colored\r\ngirl in Mr. Galen\'s school has caused a breeze of excitement. You know\r\nMr. Galen is quite an Abolitionist, and, being true to his principles,\r\nhe could not consistently refuse when a colored woman applied for her\r\ndaughter\'s admission. Of course, when he took her he was compelled to\r\ntreat her as any other pupil. In so doing he has given mortal offense to\r\nthe mother of two Southern boys. She has threatened to take them away if\r\nthe colored girl remains."\r\n\r\n"What will he do about it?" asked Marie, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is a bitter pill, but I think he will have to swallow it. He is\r\nbetween two fires. He cannot dismiss her from the school and be true to\r\nhis Abolition principles; yet if he retains her he will lose his\r\nSouthern customers, and I know he cannot afford to do that."\r\n\r\n"What does Iola say?"\r\n\r\n"He has found another boarding place for her, but she is to remain in\r\nthe school. He had to throw that sop to the whale."\r\n\r\n"Does she take sides against the girl?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think she does. She says she feels sorry for her, and that\r\nshe would hate to be colored. \'It is so hard to be looked down on for\r\nwhat one can\'t help.\'"\r\n\r\n"Poor child! I wish we could leave the country. I never would consent to\r\nher marrying any one without first revealing to him her connection with\r\nthe negro race. This is a subject on which I am not willing to run any\r\nrisks."\r\n\r\n"My dear Marie, when you shall have read Iola\'s letter you will see it\r\nis more than a figment of my imagination that has made me so loth to\r\nhave our children know the paralyzing power of caste."\r\n\r\nLeroy, always liberal with his wife and children, spared neither pains\r\nnor expense to have them prepared for their summer outing. Iola was to\r\ngraduate in a few days. Harry was attending a school in the State of\r\nMaine, and his father had written to him, apprising him of his intention\r\nto come North that season. In a few days Leroy and his wife started\r\nNorth, but before they reached Vicksburg they were met by the\r\nintelligence that the yellow fever was spreading in the Delta, and that\r\npestilence was breathing its bane upon the morning air and distilling\r\nits poison upon the midnight dews.\r\n\r\n"Let us return home," said Marie.\r\n\r\n"It is useless," answered Leroy. "It is nearly two days since we left\r\nhome. The fever is spreading south of us with fearful rapidity. To\r\nreturn home is to walk into the jaws of death. It was my intention to\r\nhave stopped at Vicksburg, but now I will go on as soon as I can make\r\nthe connections."\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Leroy and his wife started again on their journey.\r\nThe cars were filled with terror-stricken people who were fleeing from\r\ndeath, when death was everywhere. They fled from the city only to meet\r\nthe dreaded apparition in the country. As they journeyed on Leroy grew\r\nrestless and feverish. He tried to brace himself against the infection\r\nwhich was creeping slowly but insidiously into his life, dulling his\r\nbrain, fevering his blood, and prostrating his strength. But vain were\r\nall his efforts. He had no armor strong enough to repel the invasion of\r\ndeath. They stopped at a small town on the way and obtained the best\r\nmedical skill and most careful nursing, but neither skill nor art\r\navailed. On the third day death claimed Leroy as a victim, and Marie\r\nwept in hopeless agony over the grave of her devoted husband, whose sad\r\nlot it was to die from home and be buried among strangers.\r\n\r\nBut before he died he placed his will in Marie\'s hands, saying: "I have\r\nleft you well provided for. Kiss the children for me and bid them\r\ngood-bye."\r\n\r\nHe tried to say a parting word to Gracie, but his voice failed, and he\r\nfainted into the stillness of death. A mortal paleness overspread his\r\ncountenance, on which had already gathered the shadows that never\r\ndeceive. In speechless agony Marie held his hand until it released its\r\npressure in death, and then she stood alone beside her dead, with all\r\nthe bright sunshine of her life fading into the shadows of the grave.\r\nHeart-broken and full of fearful forebodings, Marie left her cherished\r\ndead in the quiet village of H---- and returned to her death-darkened\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day in June, birds were singing their sweetest songs,\r\nflowers were breathing their fragrance on the air, when Mam Liza,\r\nsitting at her cabin-door, talking with some of the house servants, saw\r\na carriage approaching, and wondered who was coming.\r\n\r\n"I wonder," she said, excitedly, "whose comin\' to de house when de folks\r\nis done gone."\r\n\r\nBut her surprise was soon changed to painful amazement, when she saw\r\nMarie, robed in black, alighting from the carriage, and holding Gracie\r\nby the hand. She caught sight of the drooping head and grief-stricken\r\nface, and rushed to her, exclaiming:--\r\n\r\n"Whar\'s Marse Eugene?"\r\n\r\n"Dead," said Marie, falling into Mammy Liza\'s arms, sobbing out, "dead!\r\n_ died_ of yellow fever."\r\n\r\nA wild burst of sorrow came from the lips of the servants, who had\r\ndrawn near.\r\n\r\n"Where is he?" said Mam Liza, speaking like one suddenly bewildered.\r\n\r\n"He is buried in H----. I could not bring him home," said Marie.\r\n\r\n"My pore baby," said Mam Liza, with broken sobs. "I\'se drefful sorry. My\r\nheart\'s most broke into two." Then, controlling herself, she dismissed\r\nthe servants who stood around, weeping, and led Marie to her room.\r\n\r\n"Come, honey, lie down an\' lem\'me git yer a cup ob tea."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I don\'t want anything," said Marie, wringing her hands in\r\nbitter agony.\r\n\r\n"Oh, honey," said Mam Liza, "yer musn\'t gib up. Yer knows whar to put\r\nyer trus\'. Yer can\'t lean on de arm of flesh in dis tryin\' time."\r\nKneeling by the side of her mistress she breathed out a prayer full of\r\ntenderness, hope, and trust.\r\n\r\nMarie grew calmer. It seemed as if that earnest, trustful prayer had\r\nbreathed into her soul a feeling of resignation.\r\n\r\nGracie stood wonderingly by, vainly trying to comprehend the great\r\nsorrow which was overwhelming the life of her mother.\r\n\r\nAfter the first great burst of sorrow was over, Marie sat down to her\r\ndesk and wrote a letter to Iola, informing her of her father\'s death. By\r\nthe time she had finished it she grew dizzy and faint, and fell into a\r\nswoon. Mammy Liza tenderly laid her on the bed, and helped restore her\r\nto consciousness.\r\n\r\nLorraine, having heard of his cousin\'s death, came immediately to see\r\nMarie. She was too ill to have an interview with him, but he picked up\r\nthe letter she had written and obtained Iola\'s address.\r\n\r\nLorraine made a careful investigation of the case, to ascertain whether\r\nMarie\'s marriage was valid. To his delight he found there was a flaw in\r\nthe marriage and an informality in the manumission. He then determined\r\nto invalidate Marie\'s claim, and divide the inheritance among Leroy\'s\r\nwhite relations. In a short time strangers, distant relatives of her\r\nhusband, became frequent visitors at the plantation, and made themselves\r\noffensively familiar. At length the dreadful storm burst.\r\n\r\nAlfred Lorraine entered suit for his cousin\'s estate, and for the\r\nremanding of his wife and children to slavery. In a short time he came\r\narmed with legal authority, and said to Marie:--\r\n\r\n"I have come to take possession of these premises."\r\n\r\n"By what authority?" she gasped, turning deathly pale. He hesitated a\r\nmoment, as if his words were arrested by a sense of shame.\r\n\r\n"By what authority?" she again demanded.\r\n\r\n"By the authority of the law," answered Lorraine, "which has decided\r\nthat Leroy\'s legal heirs are his white blood relations, and that your\r\nmarriage is null and void."\r\n\r\n"But," exclaimed Marie, "I have our marriage certificate. I was Leroy\'s\r\nlawful wife."\r\n\r\n"Your marriage certificate is not worth the paper it is written on."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must be jesting, cruelly jesting. It can\'t be so."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is so. Judge Starkins has decided that your manumission is\r\nunlawful; your marriage a bad precedent, and inimical to the welfare of\r\nsociety; and that you and your children are remanded to slavery."\r\n\r\nMarie stood as one petrified. She seemed a statue of fear and despair.\r\nShe tried to speak, reached out her hand as if she were groping in the\r\ndark, turned pale as death as if all the blood in her veins had receded\r\nto her heart, and, with one heart-rending cry of bitter agony, she fell\r\nsenseless to the floor. Her servants, to whom she had been so kind in\r\nher days of prosperity, bent pityingly over her, chafed her cold hands,\r\nand did what they could to restore her to consciousness. For awhile she\r\nwas stricken with brain fever, and her life seemed trembling on its\r\nfrailest cord.\r\n\r\nGracie was like one perfectly dazed. When not watching by her mother\'s\r\nbedside she wandered aimlessly about the house, growing thinner day by\r\nday. A slow fever was consuming her life. Faithfully and carefully Mammy\r\nLiza watched over her, and did all she could to bring smiles to her lips\r\nand light to her fading eyes, but all in vain. Her only interest in life\r\nwas to sit where she could watch her mother as she tossed to and fro in\r\ndelirium, and to wonder what had brought the change in her once happy\r\nhome. Finally she, too, was stricken with brain fever, which intervened\r\nas a mercy between her and the great sorrow that was overshadowing her\r\nyoung life. Tears would fill the servants\' eyes as they saw the dear\r\nchild drifting from them like a lovely vision, too bright for earth\'s\r\ndull cares and weary, wasting pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL-GIRL NOTIONS.\r\n\r\nDuring Iola\'s stay in the North she found a strong tide of opposition\r\nagainst slavery. Arguments against the institution had entered the\r\nChurch and made legislative halls the arenas of fierce debate. The\r\nsubject had become part of the social converse of the fireside, and had\r\nenlisted the best brain and heart of the country. Anti-slavery\r\ndiscussions were pervading the strongest literature and claiming, a\r\nplace on the most popular platforms.\r\n\r\nIola, being a Southern girl and a slave-holder\'s daughter, always\r\ndefended slavery when it was under discussion.\r\n\r\n"Slavery can\'t be wrong," she would say, "for my father is a\r\nslave-holder, and my mother is as good to our servants as she can be. My\r\nfather often tells her that she spoils them, and lets them run over her.\r\nI never saw my father strike one of them. I love my mammy as much as I\r\ndo my own mother, and I believe she loves us just as if we were her own\r\nchildren. When we are sick I am sure that she could not do anything more\r\nfor us than she does."\r\n\r\n"But, Iola," responded one of her school friends, "after all, they are\r\nnot free. Would you be satisfied to have the most beautiful home, the\r\ncostliest jewels, or the most elegant wardrobe if you were a slave?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the cases are not parallel. Our slaves do not want their freedom.\r\nThey would not take it if we gave it to them."\r\n\r\n"That is not the case with them all. My father has seen men who have\r\nencountered almost incredible hardships to get their freedom. Iola, did\r\nyou ever attend an anti-slavery meeting?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think these Abolitionists have any right to meddle in our\r\naffairs. I believe they are prejudiced against us, and want to get our\r\nproperty. I read about them in the papers when I was at home. I don\'t\r\nwant to hear my part of the country run down. My father says the slaves\r\nwould be very well contented if no one put wrong notions in their\r\nheads."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," was the response of her friend, "but I do not think that\r\nthat slave mother who took her four children, crossed the Ohio River on\r\nthe ice, killed one of the children and attempted the lives of the other\r\ntwo, was a contented slave. And that other one, who, running away and\r\nfinding herself pursued, threw herself over the Long Bridge into the\r\nPotomac, was evidently not satisfied. I do not think the numbers who are\r\ncoming North on the Underground Railroad can be very contented. It is\r\nnot natural for people to run away from happiness, and if they are so\r\nhappy and contented, why did Congress pass the Fugitive Slave Bill?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think," answered Iola, "any of our slaves would run away.\r\nI know mamma don\'t like slavery very much. I have often heard her say\r\nthat she hoped the time would come when there would not be a slave in\r\nthe land. My father does not think as she does. He thinks slavery is not\r\nwrong if you treat them well and don\'t sell them from their families. I\r\nintend, after I have graduated, to persuade pa to buy a house in New\r\nOrleans, and spend the winter there. You know this will be my first\r\nseason out, and I hope that you will come and spend the winter with me.\r\nWe will have such gay times, and you will so fall in love with our sunny\r\nSouth that you will never want to come back to shiver amid the snows and\r\ncold of the North. I think one winter in the South would cure you of\r\nyour Abolitionism."\r\n\r\n"Have you seen her yet?"\r\n\r\nThis question was asked by Louis Bastine, an attorney who had come North\r\nin the interests of Lorraine. The scene was the New England village\r\nwhere Mr. Galen\'s academy was located, and which Iola was attending.\r\nThis question was addressed to Camille Lecroix, Bastine\'s intimate\r\nfriend, who had lately come North. He was the son of a planter who lived\r\nnear Leroy\'s plantation, and was familiar with Iola\'s family history.\r\nSince his arrival North, Bastine had met him and communicated to him his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n"Yes; just caught a glimpse of her this morning as she was going down\r\nthe street," was Camille\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"She is a most beautiful creature," said Louis Bastine. "She has the\r\nproud poise of Leroy, the most splendid eyes I ever saw in a woman\'s\r\nhead, lovely complexion, and a glorious wealth of hair. She would bring\r\n$2000 any day in a New Orleans market."\r\n\r\n"I always feel sorry," said Camille, "when I see one of those Creole\r\ngirls brought to the auction block. I have known fathers who were deeply\r\ndevoted to their daughters, but who through some reverse of fortune were\r\nforced to part with them, and I always think the blow has been equally\r\nterrible on both sides. I had a friend who had two beautiful daughters\r\nwhom he had educated in the North. They were cultured, and really belles\r\nin society. They were entirely ignorant of their lineage, but when their\r\nfather died it was discovered that their mother had been a slave. It was\r\na fearful blow. They would have faced poverty, but the knowledge of\r\ntheir tainted blood was more than they could bear."\r\n\r\n"What became of them?"\r\n\r\n"They both died, poor girls. I believe they were as much killed by the\r\nblow as if they had been shot. To tell you the truth, Bastine, I feel\r\nsorry for this girl. I don\'t believe she has the least idea of her negro\r\nblood."\r\n\r\n"No, Leroy has been careful to conceal it from her," replied Bastine.\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" queried Camille. "Then he has made a great mistake."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that," said Bastine; "business is business."\r\n\r\n"How can you get her away?" asked Camille. "You will have to be very\r\ncautious, because if these pesky Abolitionists get an inkling of what\r\nyou\'re doing they will balk your game double quick. And when you come to\r\nlook at it, isn\'t it a shame to attempt to reduce that girl to slavery?\r\nShe is just as white as we are, as good as any girl in the land, and\r\nbetter educated than thousands of white girls. A girl with her apparent\r\nrefinement and magnificent beauty, were it not for the cross in her\r\nblood, I would be proud to introduce to our set. She would be the\r\nsensation of the season. I believe to-day it would be easier for me to\r\ngo to the slums and take a young girl from there, and have her\r\nintroduced as my wife, than to have society condone the offense if I\r\nmarried that lovely girl. There is not a social circle in the South that\r\nwould not take it as a gross insult to have her introduced into it."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bastine, "my plan is settled. Leroy has never allowed her\r\nto spend her vacations at home. I understand she is now very anxious to\r\nget home, and, as Lorraine\'s attorney, I have come on his account to\r\ntake her home."\r\n\r\n"How will you do it?"\r\n\r\n"I shall tell her her father is dangerously ill, and desires her to come\r\nas quickly as possible."\r\n\r\n"And what then?"\r\n\r\n"Have her inventoried with the rest of the property."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t she know that her father is dead?"\r\n\r\n"I think not," said Bastine. "She is not in mourning, but appeared very\r\nlight-hearted this morning, laughing and talking with two other girls. I\r\nwas struck with her great beauty, and asked a gentleman who she was. He\r\nsaid, \'Miss Leroy, of Mississippi.\' I think Lorraine has managed the\r\naffair so as to keep her in perfect ignorance of her father\'s death. I\r\ndon\'t like the job, but I never let sentiment interfere with my work."\r\n\r\nPoor Iola! When she said slavery was not a bad thing, little did she\r\nthink that she was destined to drink to its bitter dregs the cup she was\r\nso ready to press to the lips of others.\r\n\r\n"How do you think she will take to her situation?" asked Camille.\r\n\r\n"O, I guess," said Bastine, "she will sulk and take it pretty hard at\r\nfirst; but if she is managed right she will soon get over it. Give her\r\nplenty of jewelry, fine clothes, and an easy time."\r\n\r\n"All this business must be conducted with the utmost secrecy and speed.\r\nHer mother could not have written to her, for she has been suffering\r\nwith brain fever and nervous prostration since Leroy\'s death. Lorraine\r\nknows her market value too well, and is too shrewd to let so much\r\nproperty pass out of his hands without making an effort to retain it."\r\n\r\n"Has she any brothers or sisters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a brother," replied Bastine; "but he is at another school, and I\r\nhave no orders from Lorraine in reference to him. If I can get the girl\r\nI am willing to let well enough alone. I dread the interview with the\r\nprincipal more than anything else. I am afraid he will hem and haw, and\r\nhave his doubts. Perhaps, when he sees my letters and hears my story, I\r\ncan pull the wool over his eyes."\r\n\r\n"But, Louis, this is a pitiful piece of business. I should hate to be\r\nengaged in it."\r\n\r\nA deep flush of shame overspread for a moment the face of Lorraine\'s\r\nattorney, as he replied: "I don\'t like the job, but I have undertaken\r\nit, and must go through with it."\r\n\r\n"I see no \'_must_\' about it. Were I in your place I would wash my hands\r\nof the whole business."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t afford it," was Bastine\'s hard, business-like reply. On the\r\nnext morning after this conversation between these two young men, Louis\r\nBastine presented himself to the principal of the academy, with the\r\nrequest that Iola be permitted to leave immediately to attend the\r\nsick-bed of her father, who was dangerously ill. The principal\r\nhesitated, but while he was deliberating, a telegram, purporting to come\r\nfrom Iola\'s mother, summoned Iola to her father\'s bedside without delay.\r\nThe principal, set at rest in regard to the truthfulness of the\r\ndispatch, not only permitted but expedited her departure.\r\n\r\nIola and Bastine took the earliest train, and traveled without pausing\r\nuntil they reached a large hotel in a Southern city. There they were\r\nobliged to wait a few hours until they could resume their journey, the\r\ntrain having failed to make connection. Iola sat in a large, lonely\r\nparlor, waiting for the servant to show her to a private room. She had\r\nnever known a great sorrow. Never before had the shadows of death\r\nmingled with the sunshine of her life.\r\n\r\nAnxious, travel-worn, and heavy-hearted, she sat in an easy chair, with\r\nnothing to divert her from the grief and anxiety which rendered every\r\ndelay a source of painful anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope that he will be alive and growing better!" was the thought\r\nwhich kept constantly revolving in her mind, until she fell asleep. In\r\nher dreams she was at home, encircled in the warm clasp of her father\'s\r\narms, feeling her mother\'s kisses lingering on her lips, and hearing the\r\njoyous greetings of the servants and Mammy Liza\'s glad welcome as she\r\nfolded her to her heart. From this dream of bliss she was awakened by a\r\nburning kiss pressed on her lips, and a strong arm encircling her.\r\nGazing around and taking in the whole situation, she sprang from her\r\nseat, her eyes flashing with rage and scorn, her face flushed to the\r\nroots of her hair, her voice shaken with excitement, and every nerve\r\ntrembling with angry emotion.\r\n\r\n"How dare you do such a thing! Don\'t you know if my father were here he\r\nwould crush you to the earth?"\r\n\r\n"Not so fast, my lovely tigress," said Bastine, "your father knew what\r\nhe was doing when he placed you in my charge."\r\n\r\n"My father made a great mistake, if he thought he had put me in charge\r\nof a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"I am your guardian for the present," replied Bastine. "I am to see you\r\nsafe home, and then my commission ends."\r\n\r\n"I wish it were ended now," she exclaimed, trembling with anger and\r\nmortification. Her voice was choked by emotion, and broken by smothered\r\nsobs. Louis Bastine thought to himself, "she is a real spitfire, but\r\nbeautiful even in her wrath."\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of her journey Iola preserved a most freezing reserve\r\ntowards Bastine. At length the journey was ended. Pale and anxious she\r\nrode up the avenue which led to her home.\r\n\r\nA strange silence pervaded the place. The servants moved sadly from\r\nplace to place, and spoke in subdued tones. The windows were heavily\r\ndraped with crape, and a funeral air pervaded the house.\r\n\r\nMammy Liza met her at the door, and, with streaming eyes and convulsive\r\nsobs, folded her to her heart, as Iola exclaimed, in tones of hopeless\r\nanguish:--\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa\'s dead!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my pore baby!" said mammy, "ain\'t you hearn tell \'bout it? Yore\r\npar\'s dead, an\' your mar\'s bin drefful sick. She\'s better now."\r\n\r\nMam Liza stepped lightly into Mrs. Leroy\'s room, and gently apprised her\r\nof Iola\'s arrival. In a darkened room lay the stricken mother, almost\r\ndistracted by her late bereavement.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Iola," she exclaimed, as her daughter entered, "is this you? I am\r\nso sorry you came."\r\n\r\nThen, burying her head in Iola\'s bosom, she wept convulsively. "Much as\r\nI love you," she continued, between her sobs, "and much as I longed to\r\nsee you, I am sorry you came."\r\n\r\n"Why, mother," replied Iola, astonished, "I received your telegram last\r\nWednesday, and I took the earliest train I could get."\r\n\r\n"My dear child, I never sent you a telegram. It was a trick to bring you\r\ndown South and reduce you to slavery."\r\n\r\nIola eyed her mother curiously. What did she mean? Had grief dethroned\r\nher reason? Yet her eye was clear, her manner perfectly rational.\r\n\r\nMarie saw the astounded look on Iola\'s face, and nerving herself to the\r\ntask, said: "Iola, I must tell you what your father always enjoined me\r\nto be silent about. I did not think it was the wisest thing, but I\r\nyielded to his desires. I have negro blood in my veins. I was your\r\nfather\'s slave before I married him. His relatives have set aside his\r\nwill. The courts have declared our marriage null and void and my\r\nmanumission illegal, and we are all to be remanded to slavery."\r\n\r\nAn expression of horror and anguish swept over Iola\'s face, and, turning\r\ndeathly pale, she exclaimed, "Oh, mother, it can\'t be so! you must be\r\ndreaming!"\r\n\r\n"No, my child; it is a terrible reality."\r\n\r\nAlmost wild with agony, Iola paced the floor, as the fearful truth broke\r\nin crushing anguish upon her mind. Then bursting into a paroxysm of\r\ntears succeeded by peals of hysterical laughter, said:--\r\n\r\n"I used to say that slavery is right. I didn\'t know what I was talking\r\nabout." Then growing calmer, she said, "Mother, who is at the bottom of\r\nthis downright robbery?"\r\n\r\n"Alfred Lorraine; I have always dreaded that man, and what I feared has\r\ncome to pass. Your father had faith in him; I never had."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, could we not contest his claim. You have your marriage\r\ncertificate and papa\'s will."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear child, but Judge Starkins has decided that we have no\r\nstanding in the court, and no testimony according to law."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, my child, unless you can escape to the North."\r\n\r\n"And leave you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Mother, I will never desert you in your hour of trial. But can nothing\r\nbe done? Had father no friends who would assist us?"\r\n\r\n"None that I know of. I do not think he had an acquaintance who approved\r\nof our marriage. The neighboring planters have stood so aloof from me\r\nthat I do not know where to turn for either help or sympathy. I believe\r\nit was Lorraine who sent the telegram. I wrote to you as soon as I could\r\nafter your father\'s death, but fainted just as I finished directing the\r\nletter. I do not think he knows where your brother is, and, if possible,\r\nhe must not know. If you can by any means, _do_ send a letter to Harry\r\nand warn him not to attempt to come home. I don\'t know how you will\r\nsucceed, for Lorraine has us all under surveillance. But it is according\r\nto law."\r\n\r\n"What law, mother?"\r\n\r\n"The law of the strong against the weak."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother, it seems like a dreadful dream, a fearful nightmare! But I\r\ncannot shake it off. Where is Gracie?"\r\n\r\n"The dear child has been running down ever since her papa\'s death. She\r\nclung to me night and day while I had the brain fever, and could not be\r\npersuaded to leave me. She hardly ate anything for more than a week. She\r\nhas been dangerously ill for several days, and the doctor says she\r\ncannot live. The fever has exhausted all her rallying power, and yet,\r\ndear as she is to me, I would rather consign her to the deepest grave\r\nthan see her forced to be a slave."\r\n\r\n"So would I. I wish I could die myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Iola, do not talk so. Strive to be a Christian, to have faith in\r\nthe darkest hour. Were it not for my hope of heaven I couldn\'t stand all\r\nthis trouble."\r\n\r\n"Mother, are these people Christians who made these laws which are\r\nrobbing us of our inheritance and reducing us to slavery? If this is\r\nChristianity I hate and despise it. Would the most cruel heathen do\r\nworse?"\r\n\r\n"My dear child, I have not learned my Christianity from them. I have\r\nlearned it at the foot of the cross, and from this book," she said,\r\nplacing a New Testament in Iola\'s hands. "Some of the most beautiful\r\nlessons of faith and trust I have ever learned were from among our lowly\r\npeople in their humble cabins."\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" called a faint voice from the adjoining room. Marie\r\nimmediately arose and went to the bedside of her sick child, where Mammy\r\nLiza was holding her faithful vigils. The child had just awakened from a\r\nfitful sleep.\r\n\r\n"I thought," she said, "that I heard Iola\'s voice. Has she come?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, darling; do you want to see her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she said, as a bright smile broke over her dying features.\r\n\r\nIola passed quickly into the room. Gracie reached out her thin,\r\nbloodless hand, clasped Iola\'s palm in hers, and said: "I am so glad you\r\nhave come. Dear Iola, stand by mother. You and Harry are all she has. It\r\nis not hard to die. You and mother and Harry must meet me in heaven."\r\n\r\nSwiftly the tidings went through the house that Gracie was dying. The\r\nservants gathered around her with tearful eyes, as she bade them all\r\ngood-bye. When she had finished, and Mammy had lowered the pillow, an\r\nunwonted radiance lit up her eye, and an expression of ineffable\r\ngladness overspread her face, as she murmured: "It is beautiful, so\r\nbeautiful!" Fainter and fainter grew her voice, until, without a\r\nstruggle or sigh, she passed away beyond the power of oppression and\r\nprejudice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REJECTED SUITOR.\r\n\r\nVery unexpected was Dr. Gresham\'s proposal to Iola. She had heartily\r\nenjoyed his society and highly valued his friendship, but he had never\r\nbeen associated in her mind with either love or marriage. As he held her\r\nhand in his a tell-tale flush rose to her cheek, a look of grateful\r\nsurprise beamed from her eye, but it was almost immediately succeeded by\r\nan air of inexpressible sadness, a drooping of her eyelids, and an\r\nincreasing pallor of her cheek. She withdrew her hand from his, shook\r\nher head sadly, and said:--\r\n\r\n"No, Doctor; that can never be. I am very grateful to you for your\r\nkindness. I value your friendship, but neither gratitude nor friendship\r\nis love, and I have nothing more than those to give."\r\n\r\n"Not at present," said Dr. Gresham; "but may I not hope your friendship\r\nwill ripen into love?"\r\n\r\n"Doctor, I could not promise. I do not think that I should. There are\r\nbarriers between us that I cannot pass. Were you to know them I think\r\nyou would say the same."\r\n\r\nJust then the ambulance brought in a wounded scout, and Iola found\r\nrelief from the wounds of her own heart in attending to his.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham knew the barrier that lay between them. It was one which his\r\nlove had surmounted. But he was too noble and generous to take advantage\r\nof her loneliness to press his suit. He had lived in a part of the\r\ncountry where he had scarcely ever seen a colored person, and around the\r\nrace their misfortunes had thrown a halo of romance. To him the negro\r\nwas a picturesque being, over whose woes he had wept when a child, and\r\nwhose wrongs he was ready to redress when a man. But when he saw the\r\nlovely girl who had been rescued by the commander of the post from the\r\nclutches of slavery, all the manhood and chivalry in his nature arose in\r\nher behalf, and he was ready to lay on the altar of her heart his first\r\ngrand and overmastering love. Not discouraged by her refusal, but\r\ndetermined to overcome her objections, Dr. Gresham resolved that he\r\nwould abide his time.\r\n\r\nIola was not indifferent to Dr. Gresham. She admired his manliness and\r\nrespected his character. He was tall and handsome, a fine specimen of\r\nthe best brain and heart of New England. He had been nurtured under\r\ngrand and ennobling influences. His father was a devoted Abolitionist.\r\nHis mother was kind-hearted, but somewhat exclusive and aristocratic.\r\nShe would have looked upon his marriage with Iola as a mistake and\r\nfeared that such an alliance would hurt the prospects of her daughters.\r\n\r\nDuring Iola\'s stay in the North, she had learned enough of the racial\r\nfeeling to influence her decision in reference to Dr. Gresham\'s offer.\r\nIola, like other girls, had had her beautiful day-dreams before she was\r\nrudely awakened by the fate which had dragged her into the depths of\r\nslavery. In the chambers of her imagery were pictures of noble deeds; of\r\nhigh, heroic men, knightly, tender, true, and brave. In Dr. Gresham she\r\nsaw the ideal of her soul exemplified. But in her lonely condition,\r\nwith all its background of terrible sorrow and deep abasement, she had\r\nnever for a moment thought of giving or receiving love from one of that\r\nrace who had been so lately associated in her mind with horror,\r\naversion, and disgust. His kindness to her had been a new experience.\r\nHis companionship was an unexpected pleasure. She had learned to enjoy\r\nhis presence and to miss him when absent, and when she began to question\r\nher heart she found that unconsciously it was entwining around him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said to herself, "I do like him; but I can never marry him.\r\nTo the man I marry my heart must be as open as the flowers to the sun. I\r\ncould not accept his hand and hide from him the secret of my birth; and\r\nI could not consent to choose the happiest lot on earth without first\r\nfinding my poor heart-stricken and desolate mother. Perhaps some day I\r\nmay have the courage to tell him my sad story, and then make my heart\r\nthe sepulchre in which to bury all the love which might have gladdened\r\nand brightened my whole life."\r\n\r\nDuring the sad and weary months which ensued while the war dragged its\r\nslow length along, Dr. Gresham and Iola often met by the bedsides of the\r\nwounded and dying, and sometimes he would drop a few words at which her\r\nheart would beat quicker and her cheek flush more vividly. But he was so\r\nkind, tender, and respectful, that Iola had no idea he knew her race\r\naffiliations. She knew from unmistakable signs that Dr. Gresham had\r\nlearned to love her, and that he had power to call forth the warmest\r\naffection of her soul; but she fought with her own heart and repressed\r\nits rising love. She felt that it was best for his sake that they should\r\nnot marry. When she saw the evidences of his increasing love she\r\nregretted that she had not informed him at the first of the barrier that\r\nlay between them; it might have saved him unnecessary suffering.\r\nThinking thus, Iola resolved, at whatever cost of pain it might be to\r\nherself, to explain to Dr. Gresham what she meant by the insurmountable\r\nbarrier. Iola, after a continuous strain upon her nervous system for\r\nmonths, began to suffer from general debility and nervous depression.\r\nDr. Gresham saw the increasing pallor on Iola\'s cheek and the loss of\r\nbuoyancy in her step. One morning, as she turned from the bed of a young\r\nsoldier for whom she had just written a letter to his mother, there was\r\nsuch a look of pity and sorrow on her face that Dr. Gresham\'s whole\r\nheart went out in sympathy for her, and he resolved to break the silence\r\nhe had imposed upon himself.\r\n\r\n"Iola," he said, and there was a depth of passionate tenderness in his\r\nvoice, a volume of unexpressed affection in his face, "you are wronging\r\nyourself. You are sinking beneath burdens too heavy for you to bear. It\r\nseems to me that besides the constant drain upon your sympathies there\r\nis some great sorrow preying upon your life; some burden that ought to\r\nbe shared." He gazed upon her so ardently that each cord of her heart\r\nseemed to vibrate, and unbidden tears sprang to her lustrous eyes, as\r\nshe said, sadly:--\r\n\r\n"Doctor, you are right."\r\n\r\n"Iola, my heart is longing to lift those burdens from your life. Love,\r\nlike faith, laughs at impossibilities. I can conceive of no barrier too\r\nhigh for my love to surmount. Consent to be mine, as nothing else on\r\nearth is mine."\r\n\r\n"Doctor, you know not what you ask," replied Iola. "Instead of coming\r\ninto this hospital a self-sacrificing woman, laying her every gift and\r\nadvantage upon the altar of her country, I came as a rescued slave, glad\r\nto find a refuge from a fate more cruel than death; a fate from which I\r\nwas rescued by the intervention of my dear dead friend, Thomas Anderson.\r\nI was born on a lonely plantation on the Mississippi River, where the\r\nwhite population was very sparse. We had no neighbors who ever visited\r\nus; no young white girls with whom I ever played in my childhood; but,\r\nnever having enjoyed such companionship, I was unconscious of any sense\r\nof privation. Our parents spared no pains to make the lives of their\r\nchildren (we were three) as bright and pleasant as they could. Our home\r\nwas so happy. We had a large number of servants, who were devoted to us.\r\nI never had the faintest suspicion that there was any wrongfulness in\r\nslavery, and I never dreamed of the dreadful fate which broke in a storm\r\nof fearful anguish over our devoted heads. Papa used to take us to New\r\nOrleans to see the Mardi Gras, and while there we visited the theatres\r\nand other places of amusement and interest. At home we had books,\r\npapers, and magazines to beguile our time. Perfectly ignorant of my\r\nracial connection, I was sent to a Northern academy, and soon made many\r\nfriends among my fellow-students. Companionship with girls of my own age\r\nwas a new experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I spent several years\r\nin New England, and was busily preparing for my commencement exercises\r\nwhen my father was snatched away--died of yellow fever on his way North\r\nto witness my graduation. Through a stratagem, I was brought hurriedly\r\nfrom the North, and found that my father was dead; that his nearest\r\nkinsman had taken possession of our property; that my mother\'s marriage\r\nhad been declared illegal, because of an imperceptible infusion of negro\r\nblood in her veins; and that she and her children had been remanded to\r\nslavery. I was torn from my mother, sold as a slave, and subjected to\r\ncruel indignities, from which I was rescued and a place given to me in\r\nthis hospital. Doctor, I did not choose my lot in life, but I have no\r\nother alternative than to accept it. The intense horror and agony I felt\r\nwhen I was first told the story are over. Thoughts and purposes have\r\ncome to me in the shadow I should never have learned in the sunshine. I\r\nam constantly rousing myself up to suffer and be strong. I intend, when\r\nthis conflict is over, to cast my lot with the freed people as a helper,\r\nteacher, and friend. I have passed through a fiery ordeal, but this\r\nministry of suffering will not be in vain. I feel that my mind has\r\nmatured beyond my years. I am a wonder to myself. It seems as if years\r\nhad been compressed into a few short months. In telling you this, do you\r\nnot, can you not, see that there is an insurmountable barrier between\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"No, I do not," replied Dr. Gresham. "I love you for your own sake. And\r\nwith this the disadvantages of birth have nothing to do."\r\n\r\n"You say so now, and I believe that you are perfectly sincere. Today\r\nyour friendship springs from compassion, but, when that subsides, might\r\nyou not look on me as an inferior?"\r\n\r\n"Iola, you do not understand me. You think too meanly of me. You must\r\nnot judge me by the worst of my race. Surely our country has produced a\r\nhigher type of manhood than the men by whom you were tried and tempted."\r\n\r\n"Tried, but not tempted," said Iola, as a deep flush overspread her\r\nface; "I was never tempted. I was sold from State to State as an article\r\nof merchandise. I had outrages heaped on me which might well crimson the\r\ncheek of honest womanhood with shame, but I never fell into the clutches\r\nof an owner for whom I did not feel the utmost loathing and intensest\r\nhorror. I have heard men talk glibly of the degradation of the negro,\r\nbut there is a vast difference between abasement of condition and\r\ndegradation of character. I was abased, but the men who trampled on me\r\nwere the degraded ones."\r\n\r\n"But, Iola, you must not blame all for what a few have done."\r\n\r\n"A few have done? Did not the whole nation consent to our abasement?"\r\nasked Iola, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"No, Miss Iola, we did not all consent to it. Slavery drew a line of\r\ncleavage in this country. Although we were under one government we were\r\nfarther apart in our sentiments than if we had been divided by lofty\r\nmountains and separated by wide seas. And had not Northern sentiment\r\nbeen brought to bear against the institution, slavery would have been\r\nintact until to-day."\r\n\r\n"But, Doctor, the negro is under a social ban both North and South. Our\r\nenemies have the ear of the world, and they can depict us just as they\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"That is true; but the negro has no other alternative than to make\r\nfriends of his calamities. Other men have plead his cause, but out of\r\nthe race must come its own defenders. With them the pen must be\r\nmightier than the sword. It is the weapon of civilization, and they must\r\nuse it in their own defense. We cannot tell what is in them until they\r\nexpress themselves."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I think there is a large amount of latent and undeveloped\r\nability in the race, which they will learn to use for their own benefit.\r\nThis my hospital experience has taught me."\r\n\r\n"But," said Dr. Gresham, "they must learn to struggle, labor, and\r\nachieve. By facts, not theories, they will be judged in the future. The\r\nAnglo-Saxon race is proud, domineering, aggressive, and impatient of a\r\nrival, and, as I think, has more capacity for dragging down a weaker\r\nrace than uplifting it. They have been a conquering and achieving\r\npeople, marvelous in their triumphs of mind over matter. They have\r\nmanifested the traits of character which are developed by success and\r\nvictory."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Iola, earnestly, "I believe the time will come when the\r\ncivilization of the negro will assume a better phase than you\r\nAnglo-Saxons possess. You will prove unworthy of your high vantage\r\nground if you only use your superior ability to victimize feebler races\r\nand minister to a selfish greed of gold and a love of domination."\r\n\r\n"But, Iola," said Dr. Gresham, a little impatiently, "what has all this\r\nto do with our marriage? Your complexion is as fair as mine. What is to\r\nhinder you from sharing my Northern home, from having my mother to be\r\nyour mother?" The tones of his voice grew tender, as he raised his eyes\r\nto Iola\'s face and anxiously awaited her reply.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Gresham," said Iola, sadly, "should the story of my life be\r\nrevealed to your family, would they be willing to ignore all the\r\ntraditions of my blood, forget all the terrible humiliations through\r\nwhich I have passed? I have too much self-respect to enter your home\r\nunder a veil of concealment. I have lived in New England. I love the\r\nsunshine of her homes and the freedom of her institutions. But New\r\nEngland is not free from racial prejudice, and I would never enter a\r\nfamily where I would be an unwelcome member."\r\n\r\n"Iola, dear, you have nothing to fear in that direction."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," she said, and a faint flush rose to her cheek, "suppose we\r\nshould marry, and little children in after years should nestle in our\r\narms, and one of them show unmistakable signs of color, would you be\r\nsatisfied?"\r\n\r\nShe looked steadfastly into his eyes, which fell beneath her\r\ntruth-seeking gaze. His face flushed as if the question had suddenly\r\nperplexed him. Iola saw the irresolution on his face, and framed her\r\nanswer accordingly.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see," she said, "that you are puzzled. You had not taken into\r\naccount what might result from such a marriage. I will relieve you from\r\nall embarrassment by simply saying I cannot be your wife. When the war\r\nis over I intend to search the country for my mother. Doctor, were you\r\nto give me a palace-like home, with velvet carpets to hush my tread, and\r\nmagnificence to surround my way, I should miss her voice amid all other\r\ntones, her presence amid every scene. Oh, you do not know how hungry my\r\nheart is for my mother! Were I to marry you I would carry an aching\r\nheart into your home and dim its brightness. I have resolved never to\r\nmarry until I have found my mother. The hope of finding her has colored\r\nall my life since I regained my freedom. It has helped sustain me in the\r\nhour of fearful trial. When I see her I want to have the proud\r\nconsciousness that I bring her back a heart just as loving, faithful,\r\nand devoted as the last hour we parted."\r\n\r\n"And is this your final answer?"\r\n\r\n"It is. I have pledged my life to that resolve, and I believe time and\r\npatience will reward me."\r\n\r\nThere was a deep shadow of sorrow and disappointment on the face of Dr.\r\nGresham as he rose to leave. For a moment he held her hand as it lay\r\nlimp in his own. If she wavered in her determination it was only for a\r\nmoment. No quivering of her lip or paling of her cheek betrayed any\r\nstruggle of her heart. Her resolve was made, and his words were\r\npowerless to swerve her from the purpose of her soul.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Gresham had gone Iola went to her room and sat buried in\r\nthought. It seemed as if the fate of Tantalus was hers, without his\r\ncrimes. Here she was lonely and heart-stricken, and unto her was\r\npresented the offer of love, home, happiness, and social position; the\r\nheart and hand of a man too noble and generous to refuse her\r\ncompanionship for life on account of the blood in her veins. Why should\r\nshe refuse these desirable boons? But, mingling with these beautiful\r\nvisions of manly love and protecting care she saw the anguish of her\r\nheart-stricken mother and the pale, sweet face of her dying sister, as\r\nwith her latest breath she had said, "Iola, stand by mamma!"\r\n\r\n"No, no," she said to herself; "I was right to refuse Dr. Gresham. How\r\ndare I dream of happiness when my poor mamma\'s heart may be slowly\r\nbreaking? I should be ashamed to live and ashamed to die were I to\r\nchoose a happy lot for myself and leave poor mamma to struggle alone. I\r\nwill never be satisfied till I get tidings of her. And when I have found\r\nher I will do all I can to cheer and brighten the remnant of her life."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY LEROY.\r\n\r\nIt was several weeks after Iola had written to her brother that her\r\nletter reached him. The trusty servant to whom she delivered it watched\r\nhis opportunity to mail it. At last he succeeded in slipping it into\r\nLorraine\'s mail and dropping them all into the post office together.\r\nHarry was studying at a boys\' academy in Maine. His father had given\r\nthat State the preference because, while on a visit there, he had been\r\nfavorably impressed with the kindness and hospitality of the people. He\r\nhad sent his son a large sum of money, and given him permission to spend\r\nawhile with some school-chums till he was ready to bring the family\r\nNorth, where they could all spend the summer together. Harry had\r\nreturned from his visit, and was looking for letters and remittances\r\nfrom home, when a letter, all crumpled, was handed him by the principal\r\nof the academy. He recognized his sister\'s handwriting and eagerly\r\nopened the letter. As he read, he turned very pale; then a deep flush\r\noverspread his face and an angry light flashed from his eyes. As he read\r\non, his face became still paler; he gasped for breath and fell into a\r\nswoon. Appalled at the sudden change which had swept over him like a\r\ndeadly sirocco, the principal rushed to the fallen boy, picked up the\r\nmissive that lay beside him, and immediately rang for help and\r\ndispatched for the doctor. The doctor came at once and was greatly\r\npuzzled. Less than an hour before, he had seen him with a crowd of\r\nmerry, laughter-loving boys, apparently as light-hearted and joyous as\r\nany of them; now he lay with features drawn and pinched, his face deadly\r\npale, as if some terrible suffering had sent all the blood in his veins\r\nto stagnate around his heart. Harry opened his eyes, shuddered, and\r\nrelapsed into silence. The doctor, all at sea in regard to the cause of\r\nthe sudden attack, did all that he could to restore him to consciousness\r\nand quiet the perturbation of his spirit. He succeeded, but found he was\r\nstrangely silent. A terrible shock had sent a tremor through every\r\nnerve, and the doctor watched with painful apprehension its effect upon\r\nhis reason. Giving him an opiate and enjoining that he should be kept\r\nperfectly quiet, the doctor left the room, sought the principal, and\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bascom, here is a case that baffles my skill. I saw that boy pass\r\nby my window not more than half an hour ago, full of animation, and now\r\nhe lies hovering between life and death. I have great apprehension for\r\nhis reason. Can you throw any light on the subject?"\r\n\r\nMr. Bascom hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I am not asking you as a matter of idle curiosity, but as a physician.\r\nI must have all the light I can get in making my diagnosis of the case."\r\n\r\nThe principal arose, went to his desk, took out the letter which he had\r\npicked up from the floor, and laid it in the physician\'s hand. As the\r\ndoctor read, a look of indignant horror swept over his face. Then he\r\nsaid: "Can it be possible! I never suspected such a thing. It must be a\r\ncruel, senseless hoax."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Mr. Bascom, "I have been a life-long Abolitionist and\r\nhave often read of the cruelties and crimes of American slavery, but\r\nnever before did I realize the low moral tone of the social life under\r\nwhich such shameless cruelties could be practiced on a defenseless widow\r\nand her orphaned children. Let me read the letter again. Just look at\r\nit, all tear-blotted and written with a trembling hand:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \'DEAR BROTHER:--I have dreadful news for you and I hardly know how\r\n    to tell it. Papa and Gracie are both dead. He died of yellow fever.\r\n    Mamma is almost distracted. Papa\'s cousin has taken possession of\r\n    our property, and instead of heirs we are chattels. Mamma has\r\n    explained the whole situation to me. She was papa\'s slave before she\r\n    married. He loved her, manumitted, educated, and married her. When\r\n    he died Mr. Lorraine entered suit for his property and Judge\r\n    Starkins has decided in his favor. The decree of the court has made\r\n    their marriage invalid, robbed us of our inheritance, and remanded\r\n    us all to slavery. Mamma is too wretched to attempt to write\r\n    herself, but told me to entreat you not to attempt to come home. You\r\n    can do us no good, and that mean, cruel Lorraine may do you much\r\n    harm. Don\'t attempt, I beseech you, to come home. Show this letter\r\n    to Mr. Bascom and let him advise you what to do. But don\'t, for our\r\n    sake, attempt to come home.\r\n\r\n    \'Your heart-broken sister,\r\n\r\n    \'IOLA LEROY.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n"This," said the doctor, "is a very awkward affair. The boy is too ill\r\nto be removed. It is doubtful if the nerves which have trembled with\r\nsuch fearful excitement will ever recover their normal condition. It is\r\nsimply a work of mercy to watch over him with the tenderest care."\r\n\r\nFortunately for Harry he had fallen into good hands, and the most tender\r\ncare and nursing were bestowed upon him. For awhile Harry was strangely\r\nsilent, never referring to the terrible misfortune which had so suddenly\r\novershadowed his life. It seemed as if the past were suddenly blotted\r\nout of his memory. But he was young and of an excellent constitution,\r\nand in a few months he was slowly recovering.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said he one day, as the physician sat at his bedside, "I seem\r\nto have had a dreadful dream, and to have dreamt that my father was\r\ndead, and my mother and sister were in terrible trouble, but I could not\r\nhelp them. Doctor, was it a dream, or was it a reality? It could not\r\nhave been a dream, for when I fell asleep the grass was green and the\r\nbirds were singing, but now the winds are howling and the frost is on\r\nthe ground. Doctor, tell me how it is? How long have I been here?"\r\n\r\nSitting by his bedside, and taking his emaciated hand in his, the doctor\r\nsaid, in a kind, fatherly tone: "My dear boy, you have been very ill,\r\nand everything depends on your keeping quiet, very quiet."\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was strong enough the principal gave him his letter to\r\nread.\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Bascom," Harry said, "I do not understand this. It says my\r\nmother and father were legally married. How could her marriage be set\r\naside and her children robbed of their inheritance? This is not a\r\nheathen country. I hardly think barbarians would have done any worse;\r\nyet this is called a Christian country."\r\n\r\n"Christian in name," answered the principal. "When your father left you\r\nin my care, knowing that I was an Abolitionist, he confided his secret\r\nto me. He said that life was full of vicissitudes, and he wished you to\r\nhave a good education. He wanted you and your sister to be prepared for\r\nany emergency. He did not wish you to know that you had negro blood in\r\nyour veins. He knew that the spirit of caste pervaded the nation, North\r\nand South, and he was very anxious to have his children freed from its\r\ndepressing influences. He did not intend to stay South after you had\r\nfinished your education."\r\n\r\n"But," said Harry, "I cannot understand. If my mother was lawfully\r\nmarried, how could they deprive her of her marital rights?"\r\n\r\n"When Lorraine," continued Mr. Bascom, "knew your father was dead, all\r\nhe had to do was to find a flaw in her manumission, and, of course, the\r\nmarriage became illegal. She could not then inherit property nor\r\nmaintain her freedom; and her children followed her condition."\r\n\r\nHarry listened attentively. Things which had puzzled him once now became\r\nperfectly clear. He sighed heavily, and, turning to the principal, said:\r\n"I see things in a new light. Now I remember that none of the planters\'\r\nwives ever visited my mother; and we never went to church except when my\r\nfather took us to the Cathedral in New Orleans. My father was a\r\nCatholic, but I don\'t think mamma is."\r\n\r\n"Now, Harry," said the principal, "life is before you. If you wish to\r\nstay North, I will interest friends in your behalf, and try to get you a\r\nsituation. Going South is out of the question. It is probable that by\r\nthis time your mother and sister are removed from their home. You are\r\npowerless to fight against the law that enslaved them. Should you fall\r\ninto the clutches of Lorraine, he might give you a great deal of\r\ntrouble. You would be pressed into the Confederate service to help them\r\nthrow up barricades, dig trenches, and add to the strength of those who\r\nenslaved your mother and sister."\r\n\r\n"Never! never!" cried Harry. "I would rather die than do it! I should\r\ndespise myself forever if I did."\r\n\r\n"Numbers of our young men," said Mr. Bascom, "have gone to the war which\r\nis now raging between North and South. You have been sick for several\r\nmonths, and much has taken place of which you are unaware. Would you\r\nlike to enlist?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly would; not so much for the sake of fighting for the\r\nGovernment, as with the hope of finding my mother and sister, and\r\navenging their wrongs. I should like to meet Lorraine on the\r\nbattle-field."\r\n\r\n"What kind of a regiment would you prefer, white or colored?"\r\n\r\nHarry winced when the question was asked. He felt the reality of his\r\nsituation as he had not done before. It was as if two paths had suddenly\r\nopened before him, and he was forced to choose between them. On one side\r\nwere strength, courage, enterprise, power of achievement, and memories\r\nof a wonderful past. On the other side were weakness, ignorance,\r\npoverty, and the proud world\'s social scorn. He knew nothing of colored\r\npeople except as slaves, and his whole soul shrank from equalizing\r\nhimself with them. He was fair enough to pass unchallenged among the\r\nfairest in the land, and yet a Christless prejudice had decreed that he\r\nshould be a social pariah. He sat, thoughtful and undecided, as if a\r\ngreat struggle were going on in his mind. Finally the principal said, "I\r\ndo not think that you should be assigned to a colored regiment because\r\nof the blood in your veins, but you will have, in such a regiment,\r\nbetter facilities for finding your mother and sister."\r\n\r\n"You are right, Mr. Bascom. To find my mother and sister I call no task\r\ntoo heavy, no sacrifice too great."\r\n\r\nSince Harry had come North he had learned to feel profound pity for the\r\nslave. But there is a difference between looking on a man as an object\r\nof pity and protecting him as such, and being identified with him and\r\nforced to share his lot. To take his place with them on the arena of\r\nlife was the test of his life, but love was stronger than pride.\r\n\r\nHis father was dead. His mother and sister were enslaved by a mockery of\r\njustice. It was more than a matter of choice where he should stand on\r\nthe racial question. He felt that he must stand where he could strike\r\nthe most effective blow for their freedom. With that thought strong in\r\nhis mind, and as soon as he recovered, he went westward to find a\r\ncolored regiment. He told the recruiting officer that he wished to be\r\nassigned to a colored regiment.\r\n\r\n"Why do you wish that," said the officer, looking at Harry with an air\r\nof astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Because I am a colored man."\r\n\r\nThe officer look puzzled. It was a new experience. He had seen colored\r\nmen with fair complexions anxious to lose their identity with the\r\ncolored race and pose as white men, but here was a man in the flush of\r\nhis early manhood, to whom could come dreams of promotion from a simple\r\nprivate to a successful general, deliberately turning his back upon\r\nevery gilded hope and dazzling opportunity, to cast his lot with the\r\ndespised and hated negro.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you," said the officer. "Surely you are a white\r\nman, and, as such, I will enlist you in a white regiment."\r\n\r\n"No," said Harry, firmly, "I am a colored man, and unless I can be\r\nassigned to a colored regiment I am not willing to enter the army."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the officer, "you are the d----d\'st fool I ever saw--a man\r\nas white as you are turning his back upon his chances of promotion! But\r\nyou can take your choice."\r\n\r\nSo Harry was permitted to enter the army. By his promptness and valor he\r\nsoon won the hearts of his superior officers, and was made drill\r\nsergeant. Having nearly all of his life been used to colored people, and\r\nbeing taught by his mother to be kind and respectful to them, he was\r\nsoon able to gain their esteem. He continued in the regiment until Grant\r\nbegan the task of opening the Mississippi. After weeks of fruitless\r\neffort, Grant marched his army down the west side of the river, while\r\nthe gunboats undertook the perilous task of running the batteries. Men\r\nwere found for the hour. The volunteers offered themselves in such\r\nnumbers that lots were cast to determine who should have the opportunity\r\nto enlist in an enterprise so fraught with danger. Harry was one on whom\r\nthe lot fell.\r\n\r\nGrant crossed the river below, coiled his forces around Vicksburg like\r\na boa-constrictor, and held it in his grasp. After forty-seven days of\r\nendurance the city surrendered to him. Port Hudson, after the surrender\r\nof Vicksburg, gave up the unequal contest, and the Mississippi was open\r\nto the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT AND HIS COMPANY.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, gentlemen," said Robert Johnson, as he approached Colonel\r\nRobinson, the commander of the post, who was standing at the door of his\r\ntent, talking with Captain Sybil.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," responded Colonel Robinson, "I am glad you have come. I\r\nwas just about to send for you. How is your company getting on?"\r\n\r\n"First rate, sir," replied Robert.\r\n\r\n"In good health?"\r\n\r\n"Excellent. They are all in good health and spirits. Our boys are used\r\nto hardship and exposure, and the hope of getting their freedom puts new\r\nsnap into them."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it," said Colonel Robinson. "They make good fighters and\r\nvery useful allies. Last night we received very valuable intelligence\r\nfrom some fugitives who had escaped through the Rebel lines. I do not\r\nthink many of the Northern people realize the service they have been to\r\nus in bringing information and helping our boys when escaping from Rebel\r\nprisons. I never knew a full-blooded negro to betray us. A month ago,\r\nwhen we were encamped near the Rebel lines, a colored woman managed\r\nadmirably to keep us posted as to the intended movements of the enemy.\r\nShe was engaged in laundry work, and by means of hanging her sheets in\r\ndifferent ways gave us the right signals."\r\n\r\n"I hope," said Captain Sybil, "that the time will come when some\r\nfaithful historian will chronicle all the deeds of daring and-service\r\nthese people have performed during this struggle, and give them due\r\ncredit therefor."\r\n\r\n"Our great mistake," said Colonel Robinson, "was our long delay in\r\ngranting them their freedom, and even what we have done is only partial.\r\nThe border States still retain their slaves. We ought to have made a\r\nclean sweep of the whole affair. Slavery is a serpent which we nourished\r\nin its weakness, and now it is stinging us in its strength."\r\n\r\n"I think so, too," said Captain Sybil. "But in making his proclamation\r\nof freedom, perhaps Mr. Lincoln went as far as he thought public opinion\r\nwould let him."\r\n\r\n"It is remarkable," said Colonel Robinson, "how these Secesh hold out.\r\nIt surprises me to see how poor white men, who, like the negroes, are\r\nvictims of slavery, rally around the Stripes and Bars. These men, I\r\nbelieve, have been looked down on by the aristocratic slaveholders, and\r\ndespised by the well-fed and comfortable slaves, yet they follow their\r\nleaders into the very jaws of death; face hunger, cold, disease, and\r\ndanger; and all for what? What, under heaven, are they fighting for?\r\nNow, the negro, ignorant as he is, has learned to regard our flag as a\r\nbanner of freedom, and to look forward to his deliverance as a\r\nconsequence of the overthrow of the Rebellion."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Captain Sybil "that these ignorant white men have been\r\nawfully deceived. They have had presented to their imaginations utterly\r\nfalse ideas of the results of Secession, and have been taught that its\r\nsuccess would bring them advantages which they had never enjoyed in the\r\nUnion."\r\n\r\n"And I think," said Colonel Robinson, "that the women and ministers have\r\nlargely fed and fanned the fires of this Rebellion, and have helped to\r\ncreate a public opinion which has swept numbers of benighted men into\r\nthe conflict. Well might one of their own men say, \'This is a rich man\'s\r\nwar and a poor man\'s fight.\' They were led into it through their\r\nignorance, and held in it by their fears."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Captain Sybil, "that if the public school had been\r\ncommon through the South this war would never have occurred. Now things\r\nhave reached such a pass that able-bodied men must report at\r\nheadquarters, or be treated as deserters. Their leaders are desperate\r\nmen, of whom it has been said: \'They have robbed the cradle and the\r\ngrave.\'"\r\n\r\n"They are fighting against fearful odds," said Colonel Robinson, "and\r\ntheir defeat is only a question of time."\r\n\r\n"As soon," said Robert, "as they fired on Fort Sumter, Uncle Daniel, a\r\ndear old father who had been praying and hoping for freedom, said to me:\r\n\'Dey\'s fired on Fort Sumter, an\' mark my words, Bob, de Norf\'s boun\'\r\nter whip.\'"\r\n\r\n"Had we freed the slaves at the outset," said Captain Sybil, "we\r\nwouldn\'t have given the Rebels so much opportunity to strengthen\r\nthemselves by means of slave labor in raising their crops, throwing up\r\ntheir entrenchments, and building their fortifications. Slavery was a\r\ndeadly cancer eating into the life of the nation; but, somehow, it had\r\ncast such a glamour over us that we have acted somewhat as if our\r\nnational safety were better preserved by sparing the cancer than by\r\ncutting it out."\r\n\r\n"Political and racial questions have sadly complicated this matter,"\r\nsaid Colonel Robinson. "The North is not wholly made up of anti-slavery\r\npeople. At the beginning of this war we were not permeated with justice,\r\nand so were not ripe for victory. The battle of Bull Run inaugurated the\r\nwar by a failure. Instead of glory we gathered shame, and defeat in\r\nplace of victory."\r\n\r\n"We have been slow," said Captain Sybil, "to see our danger and to do\r\nour duty. Our delay has cost us thousands of lives and millions of\r\ndollars. Yet it may be it is all for the best. Our national wound was\r\ntoo deep to be lightly healed. When the President issued his\r\nEmancipation Proclamation my heart overflowed with joy, and I said:\r\n\'This is the first bright rift in the war cloud.\'"\r\n\r\n"And did you really think that they would accept the terms of freedom\r\nand lay down their arms?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"I hardly thought they would," continued Captain Sybil. "I did not think\r\nthat their leaders would permit it. I believe the rank and file of their\r\narmy are largely composed of a mass of ignorance, led, manipulated, and\r\nmoulded by educated and ambitious wickedness. In attempting to overthrow\r\nthe Union, a despotism and reign of terror were created which\r\nencompassed them as fetters of iron, and they will not accept the\r\nconditions until they have reached the last extremity. I hardly think\r\nthey are yet willing to confess that such extremity has been reached."\r\n\r\n"Captain," said Robert, as they left Colonel Robinson\'s tent, "I have\r\nlived all my life where I have had a chance to hear the \'Secesh\' talk,\r\nand when they left their papers around I used to read everything I could\r\nlay my hands on. It seemed to me that the big white men not only ruled\r\nover the poor whites and made laws for them, but over the whole nation."\r\n\r\n"That was so," replied Captain Sybil. "The North was strong but\r\nforbearing. It was busy in trade and commerce, and permitted them to\r\nmake the Northern States hunting-grounds for their slaves. When we sent\r\nback Simms and Burns from beneath the shadow of Bunker Hill Monument and\r\nFaneuil Hall, they mistook us; looked upon us as a lot of\r\nmoney-grabbers, who would be willing to purchase peace at any price. I\r\ndo not believe when they fired on the \'Star of the West\' that they had\r\nthe least apprehension of the fearful results which were to follow their\r\nmadness and folly."\r\n\r\n"Well, Captain," asked Robert, "if the free North would submit to be\r\ncalled on to help them catch their slaves, what could be expected of us,\r\nwho all our lives had known no other condition than that of slavery? How\r\nmuch braver would you have been, if your first recollections had been\r\nthose of seeing your mother maltreated, your father cruelly beaten, or\r\nyour fellow-servants brutally murdered? I wonder why they never enslaved\r\nthe Indians!"\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken, Robert, if you think the Indians were never enslaved.\r\nI have read that the Spaniards who visited the coasts of America\r\nkidnapped thousands of Indians, whom they sent to Europe and the West\r\nIndies as slaves. Columbus himself, we are informed, captured five\r\nhundred natives, and sent them to Spain. The Indian had the lesser power\r\nof endurance, and Las Cassas suggested the enslavement of the negro,\r\nbecause he seemed to possess greater breadth of physical organization\r\nand stronger power of endurance. Slavery was an old world\'s crime which,\r\nI have heard, the Indians never practiced among themselves. Perhaps it\r\nwould have been harder to reduce them to slavery and hold them in\r\nbondage when they had a vast continent before them, where they could\r\nhide in the vastnesses of its mountains or the seclusion of its forests,\r\nthan it was for white men to visit the coasts of Africa and, with their\r\nsuperior knowledge, obtain cargoes of slaves, bring them across the\r\nocean, hem them in on the plantations, and surround them with a pall of\r\ndense ignorance."\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Robert, "in reading a history I once came across at\r\nour house, that when the Africans first came to this country they did\r\nnot all speak one language. Some had only met as mutual enemies. They\r\nwere not all one color, their complexions ranging from tawny yellow to\r\ndeep black."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Captain Sybil, "and in dealing with the negro we wanted his\r\nlabor; in dealing with the Indian we wanted his lands. For one we had\r\nweapons of war; for the other we had real and invisible chains, the\r\ncoercion of force, and the terror of the unseen world."\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly so, Captain! When I was a boy I used to hear the old\r\nfolks tell what would happen to bad people in another world; about the\r\ndevil pouring hot lead down people\'s throats and stirring them up with a\r\npitch-fork; and I used to get so scared that I would be afraid to go to\r\nbed at night. I don\'t suppose the Indians ever heard of such things,\r\nor, if they had, I never heard of them being willing to give away all\r\ntheir lands on earth, and quietly wait for a home in heaven."\r\n\r\n"But, surely, Robert, you do not think religion has degraded the negro?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wouldn\'t say that. But a man is in a tight fix when he takes his\r\npart, like Nat Turner or Denmark Veasy, and is made to fear that he will\r\nbe hanged in this world and be burned in the next. And, since I come to\r\nthink of it, we colored folks used to get mightily mixed up about our\r\nreligion. Mr. Gundover had on his plantation a real smart man. He was\r\nreligious, but he would steal."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Robert," queried Sybil, "how could he be religious and steal?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t think," retorted Robert, "it was any harm to steal from his\r\nmaster. I guess he thought it was right to get from his master all he\r\ncould. He would have thought it wrong to steal from his fellow-servants.\r\nHe thought that downright mean, but I wouldn\'t have insured the lives of\r\nGundover\'s pigs and chickens, if Uncle Jack got them in a tight place.\r\nOne day there was a minister stopping with Mr. Gundover. As a matter of\r\ncourse, in speaking of his servants, he gave Jack\'s sins an airing. He\r\nwould much rather confess Jack\'s sins than his own. Now Gundover wanted\r\nto do two things, save his pigs and poultry, and save Jack\'s soul. He\r\ntold the minister that Jack was a liar and a thief, and gave the\r\nminister a chance to talk with Uncle Jack about the state of his soul.\r\nUncle Jack listened very quietly, and when taxed with stealing his\r\nmaster\'s wheat he was ready with an answer. \'Now Massa Parker,\' said\r\nJack, \'lem\'me tell yer jis\' how it war \'bout dat wheat. Wen ole Jack\r\ncom\'d down yere, dis place war all growed up in woods. He go ter work,\r\nclared up de groun\' an\' plowed, an\' planted, an\' riz a crap, an\' den wen\r\nit war all done, he hadn\'t a dollar to buy his ole woman a gown; an\' he\r\njis\' took a bag ob wheat.\'"\r\n\r\n"What did Mr. Parker say?" asked Sybil.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, though I reckon he didn\'t think it was a bad steal after\r\nall, but I don\'t suppose he told Jack so. When he came to the next\r\npoint, about Jack\'s lying, I suppose he thought he had a clear case; but\r\nJack was equal to the occasion."\r\n\r\n"How did he clear up that charge?" interrogated Captain Sybil.\r\n\r\n"Finely. I think if he had been educated he would have made a first-rate\r\nlawyer. He said, \'Marse Parker, dere\'s old Joe. His wife don\'t lib on\r\ndis plantation. Old Joe go ober ter see her, but he stayed too long, an\'\r\ndidn\'t git back in time fer his work. Massa\'s oberseer kotched him an\'\r\ncut him all up. When de oberseer went inter de house, pore old Joe war\r\nall tired an\' beat up, an\' so he lay down by de fence corner and go ter\r\nsleep. Bimeby Massa oberseer com\'d an\' axed, "all bin a workin\' libely?"\r\nI say "Yes, Massa."\' Then said Mr. Parker, \'You were lying, Joe had been\r\nsleeping, not working.\' \'I know\'s dat, but ef I tole on Joe, Massa\r\noberseer cut him all up again, and Massa Jesus says, "Blessed am de\r\nPeacemaker."\' I heard, continued Robert, that Mr. Parker said to\r\nGundover, \'You seem to me like a man standing in a stream where the\r\nblood of Jesus can reach you, but you are standing between it and your\r\nslaves. How will you answer that in the Day of Judgment?\'"\r\n\r\n"What did Gundover say?" asked Captain Sybil.\r\n\r\n"He turned pale, and said, \'For God\'s sake don\'t speak of the Day of\r\nJudgment in connection with slavery.\'"\r\n\r\nJust then a messenger brought a communication to Captain Sybil. He read\r\nit attentively, and, turning to Robert, said, "Here are orders for an\r\nengagement at Five Forks to-morrow. Oh, this wasting of life and\r\nscattering of treasure might have been saved had we only been wiser. But\r\nthe time is passing. Look after your company, and see that everything is\r\nin readiness as soon as possible."\r\n\r\nCarefully Robert superintended the arrangements for the coming battle of\r\na strife which for years had thrown its crimson shadows over the land.\r\nThe Rebels fought with a valor worthy of a better cause. The disaster of\r\nBull Run had been retrieved. Sherman had made his famous march to the\r\nsea. Fighting Joe Hooker had scaled the stronghold of the storm king and\r\nwon a victory in the palace chamber of the clouds; the Union soldiers\r\nhad captured Columbia, replanted the Stars and Stripes in Charleston,\r\nand changed that old sepulchre of slavery into the cradle of a new-born\r\nfreedom. Farragut had been as triumphant on water as the other generals\r\nhad been victorious on land, and New Orleans had been wrenched from the\r\nhands of the Confederacy. The Rebel leaders were obstinate. Misguided\r\nhordes had followed them to defeat and death. Grant was firm and\r\ndetermined to fight it out if it took all summer. The closing battles\r\nwere fought with desperate courage and firm resistance, but at last the\r\nSouth was forced to succumb. On the ninth day of April, 1865, General\r\nLee surrendered to General Grant. The lost cause went down in blood and\r\ntears, and on the brows of a ransomed people God poured the chrism of a\r\nnew era, and they stood a race newly anointed with freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nVery sad and heart-rending were the scenes with which Iola came in\r\nconstant contact. Well may Christian men and women labor and pray for\r\nthe time when nations shall learn war no more; when, instead of bloody\r\nconflicts, there shall be peaceful arbitration. The battle in which\r\nRobert fought, after his last conversation with Captain Sybil, was one\r\nof the decisive struggles of the closing conflict. The mills of doom and\r\nfate had ground out a fearful grist of agony and death,\r\n\r\n    "And lives of men and souls of States\r\n       Were thrown like chaff beyond the gates."\r\n\r\nNumbers were taken prisoners. Pale, young corpses strewed the earth;\r\nmanhood was stricken down in the flush of its energy and prime. The\r\nambulances brought in the wounded and dying. Captain Sybil laid down his\r\nlife on the altar of freedom. His prediction was fulfilled. Robert was\r\nbrought into the hospital, wounded, but not dangerously. Iola remembered\r\nhim as being the friend of Tom Anderson, and her heart was drawn\r\ninstinctively towards him. For awhile he was delirious, but her presence\r\nhad a soothing effect upon him. He sometimes imagined that she was his\r\nmother, and he would tell her how he had missed her; and then at times\r\nhe would call her sister. Iola, tender and compassionate, humored his\r\nfancies, and would sing to him in low, sweet tones some of the hymns\r\nshe had learned in her old home in Mississippi. One day she sang a few\r\nverses of the hymn beginning with the words--\r\n\r\n    "Drooping souls no longer grieve,\r\n           Heaven is propitious;\r\n     If on Christ you do believe,\r\n          You will find Him precious."\r\n\r\n"That," said he, looking earnestly into Iola\'s face, "was my mother\'s\r\nhymn. I have not heard it for years. Where did you learn it?"\r\n\r\nIola gazed inquiringly upon the face of her patient, and saw, by his\r\nclear gaze and the expression of his face, that his reason had returned.\r\n\r\n"In my home, in Mississippi, from my own dear mother," was Iola\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"Do you know where she learned it?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"When she was a little girl she heard her mother sing it. Years after, a\r\nMethodist preacher came to our house, sang this hymn, and left the book\r\nbehind him. My father was a Catholic, but my mother never went to any\r\nchurch. I did not understand it then, but I do now. We used to sing\r\ntogether, and read the Bible when we were alone."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember where she came from, and who was her mother?" asked\r\nRobert, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend, you must be quiet. The fever has left you, but I will\r\nnot answer for the consequences if you get excited."\r\n\r\nRobert lay quiet and thoughtful for awhile and, seeing he was wakeful,\r\nIola said, "Have you any friends to whom you would like to send a\r\nletter?"\r\n\r\nA pathetic expression flitted over his face, as he sadly replied, "I\r\nhaven\'t, to my knowledge, a single relation in the world. When I was\r\nabout ten years old my mother and sister were sold from me. It is more\r\nthan twenty years since I have heard from them. But that hymn which you\r\nwere singing reminded me so much of my mother! She used to sing it when\r\nI was a child. Please sing it again."\r\n\r\nIola\'s voice rose soft and clear by his bedside, till he fell into a\r\nquiet slumber. She remembered that her mother had spoken of her brother\r\nbefore they had parted, and her interest and curiosity were awakened by\r\nRobert\'s story. While he slept, she closely scrutinized Robert\'s\r\nfeatures, and detected a striking resemblance between him and her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _do_ wonder if he can be my mother\'s brother, from whom she has\r\nbeen separated so many years!"\r\n\r\nAnxious as she was to ascertain if there was any relationship between\r\nRobert and her mother, she forebore to question him on the subject which\r\nlay so near her heart. But one day, when he was so far recovered as to\r\nbe able to walk around, he met Iola on the hospital grounds, and said to\r\nher:--\r\n\r\n"Miss Iola, you remind me so much of my mother and sister that I cannot\r\nhelp wondering if you are the daughter of my long-lost sister."\r\n\r\n"Do you think," asked Iola, "if you saw the likeness of your sister you\r\nwould recognize her?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not. But there is one thing I can remember about her: she\r\nused to have a mole on her cheek, which mother used to tell her was her\r\nbeauty spot."\r\n\r\n"Look at this," said Iola, handing him a locket which contained her\r\nmother\'s picture.\r\n\r\nRobert grasped the locket eagerly, scanned the features attentively,\r\nthen, handing it back, said: "I have only a faint remembrance of my\r\nsister\'s features; but I never could recognize in that beautiful woman\r\nthe dear little sister with whom I used to play. Oh, the cruelty of\r\nslavery! How it wrenched and tore us apart! Where is _your_ mother now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I cannot tell," answered Iola. "I left her in Mississippi. My\r\nfather was a wealthy Creole planter, who fell in love with my mother.\r\nShe was his slave, but he educated her in the North, freed, and married\r\nher. My father was very careful to have the fact of our negro blood\r\nconcealed from us. I had not the slightest suspicion of it. When he was\r\ndead the secret was revealed. His white relations set aside my father\'s\r\nwill, had his marriage declared invalid, and my mother and her children\r\nwere remanded to slavery." Iola shuddered as she pronounced the horrid\r\nword, and grew deadly pale; but, regaining her self-possession,\r\ncontinued: "Now, that freedom has come, I intend to search for my mother\r\nuntil I find her."\r\n\r\n"I do not wonder," said Robert, "that we had this war. The nation had\r\nsinned enough to suffer."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Iola, "if national sins bring down national judgments, then\r\nthe nation is only reaping what it sowed."\r\n\r\n"What are your plans for the future, or have you any?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"I intend offering myself as a teacher in one of the schools which are\r\nbeing opened in different parts of the country," replied Iola. "As soon\r\nas I am able I will begin my search for my dear mother. I will advertise\r\nfor her in the papers, hunt for her in the churches, and use all the\r\nmeans in my power to get some tidings of her and my brother Harry. What\r\na cruel thing it was to separate us!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMES IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," said Dr. Gresham, approaching Robert and Iola. "How are\r\nyou both? You have mended rapidly," turning to Robert, "but then it was\r\nonly a flesh wound. Your general health being good, and your blood in\r\nexcellent condition, it was not hard for you to rally."\r\n\r\n"Where have you been, Doctor? I have a faint recollection of having seen\r\nyou on the morning I was brought in from the field, but not since."\r\n\r\n"I have been on a furlough. I was running down through exhaustion and\r\noverwork, and I was compelled to go home for a few weeks\' rest. But now,\r\nas they are about to close the hospital, I shall be permanently\r\nrelieved. I am glad that this cruel strife is over. It seemed as if I\r\nhad lived through ages during these last few years. In the early part of\r\nthe war I lost my arm by a stray shot, and my armless sleeve is one of\r\nthe mementos of battle I shall carry with me through life. Miss Leroy,"\r\nhe continued, turning respectfully to Iola, "would you permit me to ask\r\nyou, as I would have someone ask my sister under the same circumstances,\r\nif you have matured any plans for the future, or if I can be of the\r\nleast service to you? If so, I would be pleased to render you any\r\nservice in my power."\r\n\r\n"My purpose," replied Iola, "is to hunt for my mother, and to find her\r\nif she is alive. I am willing to go anywhere and do anything to find\r\nher. But I will need a standpoint from whence I can send out lines of\r\ninquiry. It must take time, in the disordered state of affairs, even to\r\nget a clue by which I may discover her whereabouts."\r\n\r\n"How would you like to teach?" asked the Doctor. "Schools are being\r\nopened all around us. Numbers of excellent and superior women are coming\r\nfrom the North to engage as teachers of the freed people. Would you be\r\nwilling to take a school among these people? I think it will be uphill\r\nwork. I believe it will take generations to get over the duncery of\r\nslavery. Some of these poor fellows who came into our camp did not know\r\ntheir right hands from their left, nor their ages, nor even the days of\r\nthe month. It took me some time, in a number of cases, to understand\r\ntheir language. It saddened my heart to see such ignorance. One day I\r\nasked one a question, and he answered, "I no shum\'."\r\n\r\n"What did he mean?" asked Iola.\r\n\r\n"That he did not see it," replied the doctor. "Of course, this does not\r\napply to all of them. Some of them are wide-awake and sharp as steel\r\ntraps. I think some of that class may be used in helping others."\r\n\r\n"I should be very glad to have an opportunity to teach," said Iola. "I\r\nused to be a great favorite among the colored children on my father\'s\r\nplantation."\r\n\r\nIn a few days after this conversation the hospital was closed. The sick\r\nand convalescent were removed, and Iola obtained a position as a\r\nteacher. Very soon Iola realized that while she was heartily appreciated\r\nby the freedmen, she was an object of suspicion and dislike to their\r\nformer owners. The North had conquered by the supremacy of the sword,\r\nand the South had bowed to the inevitable. But here was a new army that\r\nhad come with an invasion of ideas, that had come to supplant ignorance\r\nwith knowledge, and it was natural that its members should be unwelcome\r\nto those who had made it a crime to teach their slaves to read the name\r\nof the ever blessed Christ. But Iola had found her work, and the freed\r\nmen their friend.\r\n\r\nWhen Iola opened her school she took pains to get acquainted with the\r\nparents of the children, and she gained their confidence and\r\nco-operation. Her face was a passport to their hearts. Ignorant of\r\nbooks, human faces were the scrolls from which they had been reading for\r\nages. They had been the sunshine and shadow of their lives.\r\n\r\nIola had found a school-room in the basement of a colored church, where\r\nthe doors were willingly opened to her. Her pupils came from miles\r\naround, ready and anxious to get some "book larnin\'." Some of the old\r\nfolks were eager to learn, and it was touching to see the eyes which had\r\ngrown dim under the shadows of slavery, donning spectacles and trying to\r\nmake out the words. As Iola had nearly all of her life been accustomed\r\nto colored children she had no physical repulsions to overcome, no\r\nprejudices to conquer in dealing with parents and children. In their\r\nsimple childish fashion they would bring her fruits and flowers, and\r\ngladden her lonely heart with little tokens of affection.\r\n\r\nOne day a gentleman came to the school and wished to address the\r\nchildren. Iola suspended the regular order of the school, and the\r\ngentleman essayed to talk to them on the achievements of the white race,\r\nsuch as building steamboats and carrying on business. Finally, he asked\r\nhow they did it?\r\n\r\n"They\'ve got money," chorused the children.\r\n\r\n"But how did they get it?"\r\n\r\n"They took it from us," chimed the youngsters. Iola smiled, and the\r\ngentleman was nonplussed; but he could not deny that one of the powers\r\nof knowledge is the power of the strong to oppress the weak.\r\n\r\nThe school was soon overcrowded with applicants, and Iola was forced to\r\nrefuse numbers, because their quarters were too cramped. The school was\r\nbeginning to lift up the home, for Iola was not satisfied to teach her\r\nchildren only the rudiments of knowledge. She had tried to lay the\r\nfoundation of good character. But the elements of evil burst upon her\r\nloved and cherished work. One night the heavens were lighted with lurid\r\nflames, and Iola beheld the school, the pride and joy of her pupils and\r\ntheir parents, a smouldering ruin. Iola gazed with sorrowful dismay on\r\nwhat seemed the cruel work of an incendiary\'s torch. While she sat,\r\nmournfully contemplating the work of destruction, her children formed a\r\nprocession, and, passing by the wreck of their school, sang:--\r\n\r\n    "Oh, do not be discouraged,\r\n       For Jesus is your friend."\r\n\r\nAs they sang, the tears sprang to Iola\'s eyes, and she said to herself,\r\n"I am not despondent of the future of my people; there is too much\r\nelasticity in their spirits, too much hope in their hearts, to be\r\ncrushed out by unreasoning malice."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR LOST ONES.\r\n\r\nTo bind anew the ties which slavery had broken and gather together the\r\nremnants of his scattered family became the earnest purpose of Robert\'s\r\nlife. Iola, hopeful that in Robert she had found her mother\'s brother,\r\nwas glad to know she was not alone in _her_ search. Having sent out\r\nlines of inquiry in different directions, she was led to hope, from some\r\nof the replies she had received, that her mother was living somewhere in\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nHearing that a Methodist conference was to convene in that State, and\r\nbeing acquainted with the bishop of that district, she made arrangements\r\nto accompany him thither. She hoped to gather some tidings of her mother\r\nthrough the ministers gathered from different parts of that State.\r\n\r\nFrom her brother she had heard nothing since her father\'s death. On his\r\nway to the conference, the bishop had an engagement to dedicate a\r\nchurch, near the city of C----, in North Carolina. Iola was quite\r\nwilling to stop there a few days, hoping to hear something of Robert\r\nJohnson\'s mother. Soon after she had seated herself in the cars she was\r\napproached by a gentleman, who reached out his hand to her, and greeted\r\nher with great cordiality. Iola looked up, and recognized him\r\nimmediately as one of her last patients at the hospital. It was none\r\nother than Robert Johnson.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to meet you," he said. "I am on my way to C---- in search\r\nof my mother. I want to see the person who sold her last, and, if\r\npossible, get some clew to the direction in which she went."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Iola, "am in search of _my_ mother. I am convinced that\r\nwhen we find those for whom we are searching they will prove to be very\r\nnearly related. Mamma said, before we were parted, that her brother had\r\na red spot on his temple. If I could see that spot I should rest assured\r\nthat my mother is your sister."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Robert, "I can give you that assurance," and smilingly he\r\nlifted his hair from his temple, on which was a large, red spot.\r\n\r\n"I am satisfied," exclaimed Iola, fixing her eyes, beaming with hope and\r\nconfidence, on Robert. "Oh, I am so glad that I can, without the least\r\nhesitation, accept your services to join with me in the further search.\r\nWhat are your plans?"\r\n\r\n"To stop for awhile in C----," said Robert, "and gather all the\r\ninformation possible from those who sold and bought my mother. I intend\r\nto leave no stone un-turned in searching for her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _do_ hope that you will succeed. I expect to stop over there a\r\nfew days, and I shall be so glad if, before I leave, I hear your search\r\nhas been crowned with success, or, a least, that you have been put on\r\nthe right track. Although I was born and raised in the midst of\r\nslavery, I had not the least idea of its barbarous selfishness till I\r\nwas forced to pass through it. But we lived so much alone I had no\r\nopportunity to study it, except on our own plantation. My father and\r\nmother were very kind to their slaves. But it was slavery, all the same,\r\nand I hate it, root and branch."\r\n\r\nJust then the conductor called out the station.\r\n\r\n"We stop here," said Robert. "I am going to see Mrs. Johnson, and hunt\r\nup some of my old acquaintances. Where do you stop?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied Iola. "I expect that friends will be here to\r\nmeet us. Bishop B----, permit me to introduce you to Mr. Robert Johnson,\r\nwhom I have every reason to believe is my mother\'s brother. Like myself,\r\nhe is engaged in hunting up his lost relatives."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Robert, "am very much pleased to know that we are not\r\nwithout favorable clues."\r\n\r\n"Bishop," said Iola, "Mr. Johnson wishes to know where I am to stop. He\r\nis going on an exploring expedition, and wishes to let me know the\r\nresult."\r\n\r\n"We stop at Mrs. Allston\'s, 313 New Street," said the bishop. "If I can\r\nbe of any use to you, I am at your service."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Robert, lifting his hat, as he left them to pursue his\r\ninquiries about his long-lost mother.\r\n\r\nQuickly he trod the old familiar streets which led to his former home.\r\nHe found Mrs. Johnson, but she had aged very fast since the war. She was\r\nno longer the lithe, active woman, with her proud manner and resolute\r\nbearing. Her eye had lost its brightness, her step its elasticity, and\r\nher whole appearance indicated that she was slowly sinking beneath a\r\nweight of sorrow which was heavier far than her weight of years. When\r\nshe heard that Robert had called to see her she was going to receive him\r\nin the hall, as she would have done any of her former slaves, but her\r\nmind immediately changed when she saw him. He was not the light-hearted,\r\ncareless, mischief-loving Robby of former days, but a handsome man,\r\nwith heavy moustache, dark, earnest eyes, and proud military bearing. He\r\nsmiled, and reached out his hand to her. She hardly knew how to address\r\nhim. To her colored people were either boys and girls, or "aunties and\r\nuncles." She had never in her life addressed a colored person as "Mr. or\r\nMrs." To do so now was to violate the social customs of the place. It\r\nwould be like learning a new language in her old age. Robert immediately\r\nset her at ease by addressing her under the old familiar name of "Miss\r\nNancy." This immediately relieved her of all embarrassment. She invited\r\nhim into the sitting-room, and gave him a warm welcome.\r\n\r\n"Well, Robby," she said, "I once thought that you would have been the\r\nlast one to leave me. You know I never ill-treated you, and I gave you\r\neverything you needed. People said that I was spoiling you. I thought\r\nyou were as happy as the days were long. When I heard of other people\'s\r\nservants leaving them I used to say to myself, \'I can trust my Bobby; he\r\nwill stick to me to the last.\' But I fooled myself that time. Soon as\r\nthe Yankee soldiers got in sight you left me without saying a word. That\r\nmorning I came down into the kitchen and asked Linda, \'Where\'s Robert?\r\nWhy hasn\'t he set the table?\' She said \'she hadn\'t seen you since the\r\nnight before.\' I thought maybe you were sick, and I went to see, but you\r\nwere not in your room. I couldn\'t believe at first that you were gone.\r\nWasn\'t I always good to you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Nancy," replied Robert; "you were good, but freedom was\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, musingly, "I suppose I would have done the same. But,\r\nRobby, it did go hard with me at first. However, I soon found out that\r\nmy neighbors had been going through the same thing. But its all over\r\nnow. Let by-gones be by-gones. What are you doing now, and where are\r\nyou living?"\r\n\r\n"I am living in the city of P----. I have opened a hardware store there.\r\nBut just now I am in search of my mother and sister."\r\n\r\n"I hope that you may find them."\r\n\r\n"How long," asked Robert, "do you think it has been since they left\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Let me see; it must have been nearly thirty years. You got my letter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am; thank you."\r\n\r\n"There have been great changes since you left here," Mrs. Johnson said.\r\n"Gundover died, and a number of colored men have banded together, bought\r\nhis plantation, and divided it among themselves. And I hear they have a\r\nvery nice settlement out there. I hope, since the Government has set\r\nthem free, that they will succeed."\r\n\r\nAfter Robert\'s interview with Mrs. Johnson he thought he would visit the\r\nsettlement and hunt up his old friends. He easily found the place. It\r\nwas on a clearing in Gundover\'s woods, where Robert and Uncle Daniel had\r\nheld their last prayer-meeting. Now the gloomy silence of those woods\r\nwas broken by the hum of industry, the murmur of cheerful voices, and\r\nthe merry laughter of happy children. Where they had trodden with fear\r\nand misgiving, freedmen walked with light and bounding hearts. The\r\nschool-house had taken the place of the slave-pen and auction-block.\r\n"How is yer, ole boy?" asked one laborer of another.\r\n\r\n"Everything is lobly," replied the other. The blue sky arching overhead\r\nand the beauty of the scenery justified the expression.\r\n\r\nGundover had died soon after the surrender. Frank Anderson had grown\r\nreckless and drank himself to death. His brother Tom had been killed in\r\nbattle. Their mother, who was Gundover\'s daughter, had died insane.\r\nTheir father had also passed away. The defeat of the Confederates, the\r\nloss of his sons, and the emancipation of his slaves, were blows from\r\nwhich he never recovered. As Robert passed leisurely along, delighted\r\nwith the evidences of thrift and industry which constantly met his eye,\r\nhe stopped to admire a garden filled with beautiful flowers, clambering\r\nvines, and rustic adornments.\r\n\r\nOn the porch sat an elderly woman, darning stockings, the very\r\nembodiment of content and good humor. Robert looked inquiringly at her.\r\nOn seeing him, she almost immediately exclaimed, "Shore as I\'se born,\r\ndat\'s Robert! Look yere, honey, whar did yer come from? I\'ll gib my head\r\nfer a choppin\' block ef dat ain\'t Miss Nancy\'s Bob. Ain\'t yer our Bobby?\r\nShore yer is."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am," responded Robert. "It isn\'t anybody else. How did you\r\nknow me?"\r\n\r\n"How did I know yer? By dem mischeebous eyes, ob course. I\'d a knowed\r\nyer if I had seed yer in Europe."\r\n\r\n"In Europe, Aunt Linda? Where\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I specs its some big city, somewhar. But yer looks jis\'\r\nsplendid. Yer looks good \'nuff ter kiss."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Linda, don\'t say that. You make me blush."\r\n\r\n"Oh you go \'long wid yer. I specs yer\'s got a nice little wife up dar\r\nwhar yer comes from, dat kisses yer ebery day, an\' Sunday, too."\r\n\r\n"Is that the way your old man does you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not a bit. He isn\'t one ob de kissin\' kine. But sit down," she\r\nsaid, handing Robert a chair. "Won\'t yer hab a glass ob milk? Boy, I\'se\r\na libin\' in clover. Neber \'spected ter see sich good times in all my\r\nborn days."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda," said Robert, seating himself near her, and drinking\r\nthe glass of milk which she had handed him, "how goes the battle? How\r\nhave you been getting on since freedom?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, fust rate, fust rate! Wen freedom com\'d I jist lit out ob Miss\r\nJohnson\'s kitchen soon as I could. I wanted ter re\'lize I war free, an\'\r\nI couldn\'t, tell I got out er de sight and soun\' ob ole Miss. When de\r\nwar war ober an\' de sogers war still stopping\' yere, I made pies an\'\r\ncakes, sole em to de sogers, an\' jist made money han\' ober fist. An\' I\r\nkep\' on a workin\' an\' a savin\' till my ole man got back from de war wid\r\nhis wages and his bounty money. I felt right set up an\' mighty big wen\r\nwe counted all dat money. We had neber seen so much money in our lives\r\nbefo\', let alone hab it fer ourselbs. An\' I sez, \'John, you take dis\r\nmoney an\' git a nice place wid it.\' An\' he sez, \'Dere\'s no use tryin\',\r\nkase dey don\'t want ter sell us any lan\'.\' Ole Gundover said, \'fore he\r\ndied, dat he would let de lan\' grow up in trees \'fore he\'d sell it to\r\nus. An\' dere war Mr. Brayton; he buyed some lan\' and sole it to some\r\ncullud folks, an\' his ole frien\'s got so mad wid him dat dey wouldn\'t\r\nspeak ter him, an\' he war borned down yere. I tole ole Miss Anderson\'s\r\ndaughter dat we wanted ter git some homes ob our ownselbs. She sez, \'Den\r\nyou won\'t want ter work for us?\' Jis\' de same as ef we could eat an\'\r\ndrink our houses. I tell yer, Robby, dese white folks don\'t know\r\neberything."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a fact, Aunt Linda."\r\n\r\n"Den I sez ter John, \'wen one door shuts anoder opens.\' An\' shore\r\n\'nough, ole Gundover died, an\' his place war all in debt, an\' had to be\r\nsole. Some Jews bought it, but dey didn\'t want to farm it, so dey gib us\r\na chance to buy it. Dem Jews hez been right helpful to cullud people wen\r\ndey hab lan\' to sell. I reckon dey don\'t keer who buys it so long as dey\r\ngits de money. Well, John didn\'t gib in at fust; didn\'t want to let on\r\nhis wife knowed more dan he did, an\' dat he war ruled ober by a woman.\r\nYer know he is an\' ole Firginian, an\' some ob dem ole Firginians do so\r\nlub to rule a woman. But I kep\' naggin at him, till I specs he got tired\r\nof my tongue, an\' he went and buyed dis piece ob lan\'. Dis house war on\r\nit, an\' war all gwine to wrack. It used to belong to John\'s ole marster.\r\nHis wife died right in dis house, an\' arter dat her husband went right\r\nto de dorgs; an\' now he\'s in de pore-house. My! but ain\'t dem tables\r\nturned. When we knowed it war our own, warn\'t my ole man proud! I seed\r\nit in him, but he wouldn\'t let on. Ain\'t you men powerful \'ceitful?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Linda, don\'t put me in with the rest!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know \'bout dat. Put you all in de bag for \'ceitfulness, an\' I\r\ndon\'t know which would git out fust."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, I suppose by this time you know how to read and\r\nwrite?"\r\n\r\n"No, chile, sence freedom\'s com\'d I\'se bin scratchin\' too hard to get a\r\nlibin\' to put my head down to de book."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda, it would be such company when your husband is away, to\r\ntake a book. Do you never get lonesome?"\r\n\r\n"Chile, I ain\'t got no time ter get lonesome. Ef you had eber so many\r\nchickens to feed, an\' pigs squealin\' fer somethin\' ter eat, an\' yore\r\nducks an\' geese squakin\' \'roun\' yer, yer wouldn\'t hab time ter git\r\nlonesome."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda, you might be sick for months, and think what a comfort\r\nit would be if you could read your Bible."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could hab prayin\' and singin\'. Dese people is mighty good \'bout\r\nprayin\' by de sick. Why, Robby, I think it would gib me de hysterics ef\r\nI war to try to git book larnin\' froo my pore ole head. How long is yer\r\ngwine to stay? An\' whar is yer stoppin?"\r\n\r\n"I got here to-day," said Robert, "but I expect to stay several days."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wants yer to meet my ole man, an\' talk \'bout ole times.\r\nCouldn\'t yer come an\' stop wid me, or isn\'t my house sniptious \'nuff?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you; but there is a young lady in town whom I think is my\r\nniece, my sister\'s daughter, and I want to be with her all I can."\r\n\r\n"Your niece! Whar did you git any niece from?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember," asked Robert, "that my mother had a little\r\ndaughter, when Mrs. Johnson sold her? Well, I believe this young lady is\r\nthat daughter\'s child."\r\n\r\n"Laws a marcy!" exclaimed Aunt Linda, "yer don\'t tell me so! Whar did\r\nyer ketch up wid her?"\r\n\r\n"I met her first," said Robert, "at the hospital here, when our poor Tom\r\nwas dying; and when I was wounded at Five Forks she attended me in the\r\nfield hospital there. She was just as good as gold."\r\n\r\n"Well, did I eber! You jis\' fotch dat chile to see me, ef she ain\'t too\r\nfine. I\'se pore, but I\'se clean, an\' I ain\'t forgot how ter git up good\r\ndinners. Now, I wants ter hab a good talk \'bout our feller-sarvants."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I," said Robert, "want to hear all about Uncle Daniel, and\r\nJennie, and Uncle Ben Tunnel."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'se got lots an\' gobs ter tell yer. I\'se kep\' track ob dem all.\r\nAunt Katie died an\' went ter hebben in a blaze ob glory. Uncle Dan\'el\r\nstayed on de place till Marse Robert com\'d back. When de war war ober he\r\nwar smashed all ter pieces. I did pity him from de bottom ob my heart.\r\nWhen he went ter de war he looked so brave an\' han\'some; an\' wen he\r\ncom\'d back he looked orful. \'Fore he went he gib Uncle Dan\'el a bag full\r\nob money ter take kere ob. \'An wen he com\'d back Uncle Dan\'el gibed him\r\nebery cent ob it. It warn\'t ebery white pusson he could hab trusted wid\r\nit. \'Cause yer know, Bobby, money\'s a mighty temptin\' thing. Dey tells\r\nme dat Marster Robert los\' a heap ob property by de war; but Marse\r\nRobert war always mighty good ter Uncle Dan\'el and Aunt Katie. He war\r\nwid her wen she war dyin\' an\' she got holt his han\' an\' made him promise\r\ndat he would meet her in glory. I neber seed anybody so happy in my\r\nlife. She singed an\' prayed ter de last. I tell you dis ole time\r\nreligion is good \'nuff fer me. Mr. Robert didn\'t stay yere long arter\r\nher, but I beliebs he went all right. But \'fore he went he looked out\r\nfer Uncle Dan\'el. Did you see dat nice little cabin down dere wid de\r\ngreen shutters an\' nice little garden in front? Well, \'fore Marse Robert\r\ndied he gib Uncle Dan\'el dat place, an\' Miss Mary and de chillen looks\r\narter him yet; an\' he libs jis\' as snug as a bug in a rug. I\'se gwine\r\nter axe him ter take supper wid you. He\'ll be powerful glad ter see\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Do you ever go to see old Miss?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I goes ebery now and den. But she\'s jis\' fell froo. Ole\r\nJohnson jis\' drunk hisself to death. He war de biggest guzzler I eber\r\nseed in my life. Why, dat man he drunk up ebery thing he could lay his\r\nhan\'s on. Sometimes he would go \'roun\' tryin\' to borrer money from pore\r\ncullud folks. \'Twas rale drefful de way dat pore feller did frow hisself\r\naway. But drink did it all. I tell you, Bobby, dat drink\'s a drefful\r\nthing wen it gits de upper han\' ob you. You\'d better steer clar ob it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," assented Robert.\r\n\r\n"I know\'d Miss Nancy\'s fadder and mudder. Dey war mighty rich. Some ob\r\nde real big bugs. Marse Jim used to know dem, an\' come ober ter de\r\nplantation, an\' eat an\' drink wen he got ready, an\' stay as long as he\r\nchoose. Ole Cousins used to have wine at dere table ebery day, an\' Marse\r\nJim war mighty fon\' ob dat wine, an\' sometimes he would drink till he\r\ngot quite boozy. Ole Cousins liked him bery well, till he foun\' out he\r\nwanted his darter, an\' den he didn\'t want him fer rags nor patches. But\r\nMiss Nancy war mighty headstrong, an\' allers liked to hab her own way;\r\nan\' dis time she got it. But didn\'t she step her foot inter it? Ole\r\nJohnson war mighty han\'some, but when dat war said all war said. She\r\nrun\'d off an\' got married, but wen she got down she war too spunkey to\r\naxe her pa for anything. Wen you war wid her, yer know she only took big\r\nbugs. But wen de war com\'d \'roun\' it tore her all ter pieces, an\' now\r\nshe\'s as pore as Job\'s turkey. I feel\'s right sorry fer her. Well,\r\nRobby, things is turned \'roun\' mighty quare. Ole Mistus war up den, an\'\r\nI war down; now, she\'s down, an\' I\'se up. But I pities her, \'cause she\r\nwarn\'t so bad arter all. De wuss thing she eber did war ta sell your\r\nmudder, an\' she wouldn\'t hab done dat but she snatched de whip out ob\r\nher han\' an gib her a lickin\'. Now I belieb in my heart she war \'fraid\r\nob your mudder arter dat. But we women had ter keep \'em from whippin\'\r\nus, er dey\'d all de time been libin\' on our bones. She had no man ter\r\nwhip us \'cept dat ole drunken husband ob hern, an\' he war allers too\r\ndrunk ter whip hisself. He jis\' wandered off, an\' I reckon he died in\r\nsomebody\'s pore-house. He warn\'t no \'count nohow you fix it. Weneber I\r\ngoes to town I carries her some garden sass, er a little milk an\'\r\nbutter. An\' she\'s mighty glad ter git it. I ain\'t got nothin\' agin her.\r\nShe neber struck me a lick in her life, an\' I belieb in praising de\r\nbridge dat carries me ober. Dem Yankees set me free, an\' I thinks a\r\npowerful heap ob dem. But it does rile me ter see dese mean white men\r\ncomin\' down yere an\' settin\' up dere grog-shops, tryin\' to fedder dere\r\nnests sellin\' licker to pore culled people. Deys de bery kine ob men dat\r\nused ter keep dorgs to ketch de runaways. I\'d be chokin\' fer a drink\r\n\'fore I\'d eber spen\' a cent wid dem, a spreadin\' dere traps to git de\r\nblack folks\' money. You jis\' go down town \'fore sun up to-morrer\r\nmornin\' an\' you see ef dey don\'t hab dem bars open to sell dere drams to\r\ndem hard workin\' culled people \'fore dey goes ter work. I thinks some\r\nniggers is mighty big fools."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Linda, don\'t run down your race. Leave that for the white\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t runnin\' down my people. But a fool\'s a fool, wether he\'s white\r\nor black. An\' I think de nigger who will spen\' his hard-earned money in\r\ndese yere new grog-shops is de biggest kine ob a fool, an\' I sticks ter\r\ndat. You know we didn\'t hab all dese low places in slave times. An\' what\r\nis dey fer, but to get the people\'s money. An\' its a shame how dey do\r\nsling de licker \'bout \'lection times."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t the temperance people want the colored people to vote the\r\ntemperance ticket?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but some ob de culled people gits mighty skittish ef dey tries to\r\ngit em to vote dare ticket \'lection time, an\' keeps dem at a proper\r\ndistance wen de \'lection\'s ober. Some ob dem say dere\'s a trick behine\r\nit, an\' don\'t want to tech it. Dese white folks could do a heap wid de\r\nculled folks ef dey\'d only treat em right."\r\n\r\n"When our people say there is a trick behind it," said Robert, "I only\r\nwish they could see the trick before it--the trick of worse than wasting\r\ntheir money, and of keeping themselves and families poorer and more\r\nignorant than there is any need for them to be."\r\n\r\n"Well, Bobby, I beliebs we might be a people ef it warn\'t for dat\r\nmizzable drink. An\' Robby, I jis\' tells yer what I wants; I wants some\r\nlibe man to come down yere an\' splain things ter dese people. I don\'t\r\nmean a politic man, but a man who\'ll larn dese people how to bring up\r\ndere chillen, to keep our gals straight, an\' our boys from runnin\' in de\r\nsaloons an\' gamblin\' dens."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t your preachers do that?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Well, some ob dem does, an\' some ob dem doesn\'t. An\' wen dey preaches,\r\nI want dem to practice wat dey preach. Some ob dem says dey\'s called,\r\nbut I jis\' thinks laziness called some ob dem. An\' I thinks since\r\nfreedom come deres some mighty pore sticks set up for preachers. Now\r\ndere\'s John Anderson, Tom\'s brudder; you \'member Tom."\r\n\r\n"Yes; as brave a fellow and as honest as ever stepped in shoe leather."\r\n\r\n"Well, his brudder war mighty diffrent. He war down in de lower kentry\r\nwen de war war ober. He war mighty smart, an\' had a good head-piece, an\'\r\na orful glib tongue. He set up store an\' sole whisky, an\' made a lot ob\r\nmoney. Den he wanted ter go to de legislatur. Now what should he do but\r\nmake out he\'d got \'ligion, an\' war called to preach. He had no more\r\n\'ligion dan my ole dorg. But he had money an\' built a meetin\' house,\r\nwhar he could hole meeting, an\' hab funerals; an\' you know cullud folks\r\nis mighty great on funerals. Well dat jis\' tuck wid de people, an\' he\r\ngot \'lected to de legislatur. Den he got a fine house, an\' his ole wife\r\nwarn\'t good \'nuff for him. Den dere war a young school-teacher, an\' he\r\nbegun cuttin\' his eyes at her. But she war as deep in de mud as he war\r\nin de mire, an\' he jis\' gib up his ole wife and married her, a fusty\r\nthing. He war a mean ole hypocrit, an\' I wouldn\'t sen\' fer him to bury\r\nmy cat. Robby, I\'se down on dese kine ob preachers like a thousand\r\nbricks."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, all the preachers are not like him."\r\n\r\n"No; I knows dat; not by a jug full. We\'s got some mighty good men down\r\nyere, an\' we\'s glad when dey comes, an\' orful sorry when dey goes \'way.\r\nDe las preacher we had war a mighty good man. He didn\'t like too much\r\nhollerin\'."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Robert, "he thought it were best for only one to speak\r\nat a time."\r\n\r\n"I specs so. His wife war de nicest and sweetest lady dat eber I did\r\nsee. None ob yer airish, stuck up folks, like a tarrapin carryin\'\r\neberything on its back. She used ter hab meetins fer de mudders, an\'\r\nlarn us how to raise our chillen, an\' talk so putty to de chillen. I\r\nsartinly did lub dat woman."\r\n\r\n"Where is she now?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"De Conference moved dem \'bout thirty miles from yere. Deys gwine to hab\r\na big meetin\' ober dere next Sunday. Don\'t you \'member dem meetins we\r\nused to hab in de woods? We don\'t hab to hide like we did den. But it\r\ndon\'t seem as ef de people had de same good \'ligion we had den. \'Pears\r\nlike folks is took up wid makin\' money an\' politics."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, don\'t you wish those good old days would come back?"\r\n\r\n"No, chile; neber! neber! Wat fer you take me? I\'d ruther lib in a\r\ncorn-crib. Freedom needn\'t keep me outer heben; an\' ef I\'se sich a fool\r\nas ter lose my \'ligion cause I\'se free, I oughtn\' ter git dere."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda, if old Miss were able to take care of you, wouldn\'t\r\nyou just as leave be back again?"\r\n\r\nThere was a faint quiver of indignation in Aunt Linda\'s voice, as she\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t yer want yer freedom? Well I wants ter pat my free foot.\r\nHalleluyah! But, Robby, I wants yer ter go ter dat big meetin\' de wuss\r\nkine."\r\n\r\n"How will I get there?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dat\'s all right. My ole man\'s got two ob de nicest mules you eber\r\nset yer eyes on. It\'ll jis\' do yer good ter look at dem. I \'spect you\'ll\r\nsee some ob yer ole frens dere. Dere\'s a nice settlemen\' of cullud folks\r\nober dere, an\' I wants yer to come an\' bring dat young lady. I wants dem\r\nfolks to see wat nice folks I kin bring to de meetin\'. I hope\'s yer\r\ndidn\'t lose all your \'ligion in de army."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not," replied Robert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, chile, yer mus\' be shore \'bout dat. I don\'t want yer to ride hope\'s\r\nhoss down to torment. Now be shore an\' come to-morrer an\' bring dat\r\nyoung lady, an\' take supper wid me. I\'se all on nettles to see dat\r\nchile."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIKING CONTRASTS.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Robert, accompanied by Iola, went to the settlement to\r\ntake supper with Aunt Linda, and a very luscious affair it was. Her\r\nfingers had not lost their skill since she had tasted the sweets of\r\nfreedom. Her biscuits were just as light and flaky as ever. Her jelly\r\nwas as bright as amber, and her preserves were perfectly delicious.\r\nAfter she had set the table she stood looking in silent admiration,\r\nchuckling to herself: "Ole Mistus can\'t set sich a table as dat. She\r\nought\'er be yere to see it. Specs \'twould make her mouf water. Well, I\r\nmus\' let by-gones be by-gones. But dis yere freedom\'s mighty good."\r\n\r\nAunt Linda had invited Uncle Daniel, and, wishing to give him a pleasant\r\nsurprise, she had refrained from telling him that Robert Johnson was the\r\none she wished him to meet.\r\n\r\n"Do you know dis gemmen?" said Aunt Linda to Uncle Daniel, when the\r\nlatter arrived.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t say\'s I do. My eyes is gittin dim, an I disremembers\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Now jis\' you look right good at him. Don\'t yer \'member him?"\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel looked puzzled and, slowly scanning Robert\'s features,\r\nsaid: "He do look like somebody I used ter know, but I can\'t make him\r\nout ter save my life. I don\'t know whar to place him. Who is de gemmen,\r\nennyhow?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Uncle Dan\'el," replied Aunt Linda, "dis is Robby; Miss Nancy\'s\r\nbad, mischeebous Robby, dat war allers playin\' tricks on me."\r\n\r\n"Well, shore\'s I\'se born, ef dis ain\'t our ole Bobby!" exclaimed Uncle\r\nDaniel, delightedly. "Why, chile, whar did yer come from? Thought you\r\nwar dead an\' buried long \'go."\r\n\r\n"Why, Uncle Daniel, did you send anybody to kill me?" asked Robert,\r\nlaughingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no\'n \'deed, chile! but I yeard dat you war killed in de battle, an\'\r\nI never \'spected ter see you agin."\r\n\r\n"Well, here I am," replied Robert, "large as life, and just as natural.\r\nAnd this young lady, Uncle Daniel, I believe is my niece." As he spoke\r\nhe turned to Iola. "Do you remember my mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Uncle Daniel, looking intently at Iola as she stepped\r\nforward and cordially gave him her hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, I firmly believe," continued Robert, "that this is the daughter\r\nof the little girl whom Miss Nancy sold away with my mother."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'se rale glad ter see her. She puts me mighty much in mine ob\r\ndem days wen we war all young togedder; wen Miss Nancy sed, \'Harriet war\r\ntoo high fer her.\' It jis\' seems like yisterday wen I yeard Miss Nancy\r\nsay, \'No house could flourish whar dere war two mistresses.\' Well, Mr.\r\nRobert--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, Uncle Daniel," interrupted Robert, "don\'t say that! Call me\r\nRobby or Bob, just as you used to."\r\n\r\n"Well, Bobby, I\'se glad klar from de bottom of my heart ter see yer."\r\n\r\n"Even if you wouldn\'t go with us when we left?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bobby, dem war mighty tryin\' times. You boys didn\'t know it, but\r\nMarster Robert hab giben me a bag ob money ter take keer ob, an\' I\r\npromised him I\'d do it an\' I had ter be ez good ez my word."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Uncle Daniel, why didn\'t you tell us boys all about it? We could\r\nhave helped you take care of it."\r\n\r\n"Now, wouldn\'t dat hab bin smart ter let on ter you chaps, an\' hab you\r\nhuntin\' fer it from Dan ter Barsheba? I specs some ob you would bin a\r\nrootin\' fer it yit!"\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Daniel, we were young then; I can\'t tell what we would have\r\ndone if we had found it. But we are older now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yer older, but I wouldn\'t put it pas\' yer eben now, ef yer foun\'\r\nout whar it war."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Iola, laughing, "they say \'caution is the parent of\r\nsafety.\'"\r\n\r\n"Money\'s a mighty tempting thing," said Robert, smiling.\r\n\r\n"But, Robby, dere\'s nothin\' like a klar conscience; a klar conscience,\r\nRobby!"\r\n\r\nJust then Aunt Linda, who had been completing the preparations for her\r\nsupper, entered the room with her husband, and said, "Salters, let me\r\ninterdoos you ter my fren\', Mr. Robert Johnson, an\' his niece, Miss\r\nLeroy."\r\n\r\n"Why, is it possible," exclaimed Robert, rising, and shaking hands,\r\n"that you are Aunt Linda\'s husband?"\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s what de parson sed," replied Salters.\r\n\r\n"I thought," pursued Robert, "that your name was John Andrews. It was\r\nsuch when you were in my company."\r\n\r\n"All de use I\'se got fer dat name is ter git my money wid it; an\' wen\r\ndat\'s done, all\'s done. Got \'nuff ob my ole Marster in slave times,\r\nwidout wearin\' his name in freedom. Wen I got done wid him, I got done\r\nwid his name. Wen I \'listed, I war John Andrews; and wen I gits my\r\npension, I\'se John Andrews; but now Salters is my name, an\' I likes it\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"But how came you to be Aunt Linda\'s husband? Did you get married since\r\nthe war?"\r\n\r\n"Lindy an\' me war married long \'fore de war. But my ole Marster sole me\r\naway from her an\' our little gal, an\' den sole her chile ter somebody\r\nelse. Arter freedom, I hunted up our little gal, an\' foun\' her. She war\r\na big woman den. Den I com\'d right back ter dis place an\' foun\' Lindy.\r\nShe hedn\'t married agin, nuther hed I; so we jis\' let de parson marry us\r\nout er de book; an\' we war mighty glad ter git togedder agin, an\' feel\r\nhitched togedder fer life."\r\n\r\n"Well, Uncle Daniel," said Robert, turning the conversation toward him,\r\n"you and Uncle Ben wouldn\'t go with us, but you came out all right at\r\nlast."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," said Aunt Linda, "Ben got inter a stream of luck. Arter\r\nfreedom com\'d, de people had a heap of fath in Ben; an\' wen dey wanted\r\nsome one to go ter Congress dey jist voted for Ben ter go. An\' he went,\r\ntoo. An\' wen Salters went to Washin\'ton to git his pension, who should\r\nhe see dere wid dem big men but our Ben, lookin\' jist as big as any ob\r\ndem."\r\n\r\n"An\' it did my ole eyes good jist ter see it," broke in Salters; "if I\r\ncouldn\'t go dere myself, I war mighty glad to see some one ob my people\r\ndat could. I felt like de boy who, wen somebody said he war gwine to\r\nslap off his face, said, \'Yer kin slap off my face, but I\'se got a big\r\nbrudder, an\' you can\'t slap off his face.\' I went to see him \'fore I lef,\r\nand he war jist de same as he war wen we war boys togedder. He hadn\'t\r\ngot de big head a bit."\r\n\r\n"I reckon Mirandy war mighty sorry she didn\'t stay wid him. I know I\r\nshould be," said Aunt Linda.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Daniel," asked Robert, "are you still preaching?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, chile, I\'se still firing off de Gospel gun."\r\n\r\n"I hear some of the Northern folks are down here teaching theology, that\r\nis, teaching young men how to preach. Why don\'t you study theology?"\r\n\r\n"Look a yere, boy, I\'se been a preachin\' dese thirty years, an\' you come\r\nyere a tellin\' me \'bout studying yore ologies. I larn\'d my \'ology at de\r\nfoot ob de cross. You bin dar?"\r\n\r\n"Dear Uncle Daniel," said Iola, "the moral aspect of the nation would be\r\nchanged if it would learn at the same cross to subordinate the spirit of\r\ncaste to the spirit of Christ."\r\n\r\n"Does yer \'member Miss Nancy\'s Harriet," asked Aunt Linda, "dat she sole\r\naway kase she wouldn\'t let her whip her? Well, we think dis is Harriet\'s\r\ngran\'chile. She war sole away from her mar, an\' now she\'s a lookin\' fer\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hopes she may fine her," replied Salters. "I war sole \'way from\r\nmy mammy wen I war eighteen mont\'s ole, an\' I wouldn\'t know her now from\r\na bunch ob turnips."\r\n\r\n"I," said Iola, "am on my way South seeking for my mother, and I shall\r\nnot give up until I find her."\r\n\r\n"Come," said Aunt Linda, "we mustn\'t stan\' yer talkin\', or de grub\'ll\r\ngit cole. Come, frens, sit down, an\' eat some ob my pore supper."\r\n\r\nAunt Linda sat at the table in such a flutter of excitement that she\r\ncould hardly eat, but she gazed with intense satisfaction on her guests.\r\nRobert sat on her right hand, contrasting Aunt Linda\'s pleasant\r\nsituation with the old days in Mrs. Johnson\'s kitchen, where he had\r\nplayed his pranks upon her, and told her the news of the war.\r\n\r\nOver Iola there stole a spirit of restfulness. There was something so\r\nmotherly in Aunt Linda\'s manner that it seemed to recall the bright,\r\nsunshiny days when she used to nestle in Mam Liza\'s arms, in her own\r\nhappy home. The conversation was full of army reminiscences and\r\nrecollections of the days of slavery. Uncle Daniel was much interested,\r\nand, as they rose from the table, exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n"Robby, seein\' yer an\' hearin\' yer talk, almos\' puts new springs inter\r\nme. I feel \'mos\' like I war gittin\' younger."\r\n\r\nAfter the supper, Salters and his guests returned to the front room,\r\nwhich Aunt Linda regarded with so much pride, and on which she bestowed\r\nso much care.\r\n\r\n"Well, Captin," said Salters, "I neber \'spected ter see you agin. Do you\r\nknow de las\' time I seed yer? Well, you war on a stretcher, an\' four ob\r\nus war carryin\' you ter de hospital. War you much hurt?\r\n\r\n"No," replied Robert, "it was only a flesh wound; and this young lady\r\nnursed me so carefully that I soon got over it."\r\n\r\n"Is dat de way you foun\' her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Andrews,"--\r\n\r\n"Salters, ef you please," interrupted Salters. I\'se only Andrews wen I\r\ngits my money."\r\n\r\n"Well, Salters," continued Robert, "our freedom was a costly thing. Did\r\nyou know that Captain Sybil was killed in one of the last battles of the\r\nwar? These young chaps, who are taking it so easy, don\'t know the\r\nhardships through which we older ones passed. But all the battles are\r\nnot fought, nor all the victories won. The colored man has escaped from\r\none slavery, and I don\'t want him to fall into another. I want the young\r\nfolks to keep their brains clear, and their right arms strong, to fight\r\nthe battles of life manfully, and take their places alongside of every\r\nother people in this country. And I cannot see what is to hinder them if\r\nthey get a chance."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t nuther," said Salters. "I don\'t see dat dey drinks any more dan\r\nanybody else, nor dat dere is any meanness or debilment dat a black man\r\nkin do dat a white man can\'t keep step wid him."\r\n\r\n"Yes," assented Robert, "but while a white man is stealing a thousand\r\ndollars, a black man is getting into trouble taking a few chickens."\r\n\r\n"All that may be true," said Iola, "but there are some things a white\r\nman can do that we cannot afford to do."\r\n\r\n"I beliebs eberybody, Norf and Souf, is lookin\' at us; an\' some ob dem\r\nain\'t got no good blood fer us, nohow you fix it," said Salters.\r\n\r\n"I specs cullud folks mus\' hab done somethin\'," interposed Aunt Linda.\r\n\r\n"O, nonsense," said Robert. "I don\'t think they are any worse than the\r\nwhite people. I don\'t believe, if we had the power, we would do any\r\nmore lynching, burning, and murdering than they do."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so," said Aunt Linda, "it\'s ralely orful how our folks hab been\r\nmurdered sence de war. But I don\'t think dese young folks is goin\' ter\r\ntake things as we\'s allers done."\r\n\r\n"We war cowed down from the beginnin\'," said Uncle Daniel, "but dese\r\nyoung folks ain\'t comin\' up dat way."\r\n\r\n"No," said Salters, "fer one night arter some ob our pore people had\r\nbeen killed, an\' some ob our women had run\'d away \'bout seventeen miles,\r\nmy gran\'son, looking me squar in de face, said: \'Ain\'t you got five\r\nfingers? Can\'t you pull a trigger as well as a white man?\' I tell yer,\r\nCap, dat jis\' got to me, an\' I made up my mine dat my boy should neber\r\ncall me a coward."\r\n\r\n"It is not to be expected," said Robert, "that these young people are\r\ngoing to put up with things as we did, when we weren\'t permitted to hold\r\na meeting by ourselves, or to own a club or learn to read."\r\n\r\n"I tried," said Salters, "to git a little out\'er de book wen I war in de\r\narmy. On Sundays I sometimes takes a book an\' tries to make out de\r\nwords, but my eyes is gittin\' dim an\' de letters all run togedder, an\' I\r\ngits sleepy, an\' ef yer wants to put me to sleep jis\' put a book in my\r\nhan\'. But wen it comes to gittin\' out a stan\' ob cotton, an\' plantin\'\r\ncorn, I\'se dere all de time. But dat gran\'son ob mine is smart as a\r\nsteel trap. I specs he\'ll be a preacher."\r\n\r\nSalters looked admiringly at his grandson, who sat grinning in the\r\ncorner, munching a pear he had brought from the table.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Aunt Linda, "his fadder war killed by the Secesh, one night,\r\ncomin\' home from a politic meetin\', an\' his pore mudder died a few\r\nweeks arter, an\' we mean to make a man ob him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s got to larn to work fust," said Salters, "an\' den ef he\'s right\r\nsmart I\'se gwine ter sen\' him ter college. An\' ef he can\'t get a libin\'\r\none way, he kin de oder."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Iola, "I hope he will turn out an excellent young man, for\r\nthe greatest need of the race is noble, earnest men, and true women."\r\n\r\n"Job," said Salters, turning to his grandson, "tell Jake ter hitch up de\r\nmules, an\' you stay dere an\' help him. We\'s all gwine ter de big\r\nmeetin\'. Yore grandma hab set her heart on goin\', an\' it\'ll be de same\r\nas a spell ob sickness ef she don\'t hab a chance to show her bes\' bib\r\nan\' tucker. That ole gal\'s as proud as a peacock."\r\n\r\n"Now, John Salters," exclaimed Aunt Linda, "ain\'t you \'shamed ob\r\nyourself? Allers tryin\' to poke fun at yer pore wife. Never mine; wait\r\ntill I\'se gone, an\' you\'ll miss me."\r\n\r\n"Ef I war single," said Salters, "I could git a putty young gal, but it\r\nwouldn\'t be so easy wid you."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said Iola, smiling.\r\n\r\n"\'Cause young men don\'t want ole hens, an\' ole men want young pullets,"\r\nwas Salter\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"Robby, honey," said Aunt Linda, "when you gits a wife, don\'t treat her\r\nlike dat man treats me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, his head\'s level," answered Robert; "at least it was in the army."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s jis\' de way; you see dat, Miss Iola? One man takin\' up for de\r\noder. But I\'ll be eben wid you bof. I must go now an\' git ready."\r\n\r\nIola laughed. The homely enjoyment of that evening was very welcome to\r\nher after the trying scenes through which she had passed. Further\r\nconversation was interrupted by the appearance of the wagon, drawn by\r\ntwo fine mules. John Salters stopped joking his wife to admire his\r\nmules.\r\n\r\n"Jis\' look at dem," he said. "Ain\'t dey beauties? I bought \'em out ob my\r\nbounty-money. Arter de war war ober I had a little money, an\' I war\r\ngwine ter rent a plantation on sheers an\' git out a good stan\' ob\r\ncotton. Cotton war bringin\' orful high prices den, but Lindy said to me,\r\n\'Now, John, you\'se got a lot ob money, an\' you\'d better salt it down.\r\nI\'d ruther lib on a little piece ob lan\' ob my own dan a big piece ob\r\nsomebody else\'s. Well, I says to Lindy, I dun know nuthin\' \'bout buyin\'\r\nlan\', an\' I\'se \'fraid arter I\'se done buyed it an\' put all de marrer ob\r\ndese bones in it, dat somebody\'s far-off cousin will come an\' say de\r\ntitle ain\'t good, an\' I\'ll lose it all."\r\n\r\n"You\'re right thar, John," said Uncle Daniel. "White man\'s so unsartain,\r\nblack man\'s nebber safe."\r\n\r\n"But somehow," continued Salters, "Lindy warn\'t satisfied wid rentin\',\r\nso I buyed a piece ob lan\', an\' I\'se glad now I\'se got it. Lindy\'s got a\r\nlot ob gumption; knows most as much as a man. She ain\'t got dat long\r\nhead fer nuffin. She\'s got lots ob sense, but I don\'t like to tell her\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Iola. "Do you think it would make her feel too happy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it don\'t do ter tell you women how much we thinks ob you. It sets\r\nyou up too much. Ole Gundover\'s overseer war my marster, an\' he used ter\r\nlib in dis bery house. I\'se fixed it up sence I\'se got it. Now I\'se\r\nbetter off dan he is, \'cause he tuck to drink, an\' all his frens is\r\ngone, an\' he\'s in de pore-house."\r\n\r\nJust then Linda came to the door with her baskets.\r\n\r\n"Now, Lindy, ain\'t you ready yet? Do hurry up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'se ready, but things wouldn\'t go right ef you didn\'t hurry me."\r\n\r\n"Well, put your chicken fixins an\' cake right in yere. Captin, you\'ll\r\nride wid me, an\' de young lady an\' my ole woman\'ll take de back seat.\r\nUncle Dan\'el, dere\'s room for you ef you\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"No, I thank you. It\'s time fer ole folks to go to bed. Good night! An\',\r\nBobby, I hopes to see you agin\'."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REVELATION.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening for the journey. The air was soft and balmy. The\r\nfields and hedges were redolent with flowers. Not a single cloud\r\nobscured the brightness of the moon or the splendor of the stars. The\r\nancient trees were festooned with moss, which hung like graceful\r\ndraperies. Ever and anon a startled hare glided over the path, and\r\nwhip-poor-wills and crickets broke the restful silence of the night.\r\nRobert rode quietly along, quaffing the beauty of the scene and thinking\r\nof his boyish days, when he gathered nuts and wild plums in those woods;\r\nhe also indulged pleasant reminiscences of later years, when, with Uncle\r\nDaniel and Tom Anderson, he attended the secret prayer-meetings. Iola\r\nrode along, conversing with Aunt Linda, amused and interested at the\r\nquaintness of her speech and the shrewdness of her intellect. To her the\r\nride was delightful.\r\n\r\n"Does yer know dis place, Robby," asked Aunt Linda, as they passed an\r\nold resort.\r\n\r\n"I should think I did," replied Robert. "It is the place where we held\r\nour last prayer-meeting."\r\n\r\n"An\' dere\'s dat ole broken pot we used, ter tell \'bout de war. But\r\nwarn\'t ole Miss hoppin\' wen she foun\' out you war goin\' to de war! I\r\nthought she\'d go almos\' wile. Now, own up, Robby, didn\'t you feel kine\r\nob mean to go off widout eben biddin\' her good bye? An\' I ralely think\r\nole Miss war fon\' ob yer. Now, own up, honey, didn\'t yer feel a little\r\ndown in de mouf wen yer lef\' her."\r\n\r\n"Not much," responded Robert. "I only thought she was getting paid back\r\nfor selling my mother."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so, Robby! yore mudder war a likely gal, wid long black hair, an\'\r\nkine ob ginger-bread color. An\' you neber hearn tell ob her sence dey\r\nsole her to Georgia?"\r\n\r\n"Never," replied Robert, "but I would give everything I have on earth to\r\nsee her once more. I _do_ hope, if she is living, that I may meet her\r\nbefore I die."\r\n\r\n"You\'s right, boy, cause she lub\'d you as she lub\'d her own life. Many a\r\ntime hes she set in my ole cabin an\' cried \'bout yer wen you war fas\'\r\nasleep. It\'s all ober now, but I\'se gwine to hole up fer dem Yankees dat\r\ngib me my freedom, an\' sent dem nice ladies from de Norf to gib us some\r\nsense. Some ob dese folks calls em nigger teachers, an\' won\'t hab nuffin\r\nto do wid \'em, but I jis\' thinks dey\'s splendid. But dere\'s some\r\ntriflin\' niggers down yere who\'ll sell der votes for almost nuffin. Does\r\nyou \'member Jake Williams an\' Gundover\'s Tom? Well dem two niggers is de\r\nlas\' ob pea-time. Dey\'s mighty small pertaters an\' few in a hill."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Linda," said Robert, "don\'t call them niggers. They are our\r\nown people."\r\n\r\n"Dey ain\'t my kine ob people. I jis\' calls em niggers, an\' niggers I\r\nmeans; an\' de bigges\' kine ob niggers. An\' if my John war sich a nigger\r\nI\'d whip him an\' leave him."\r\n\r\n"An\' what would I be a doin\'," queried John, suddenly rousing up at the\r\nmention of his name.\r\n\r\n"Standing still and taking it, I suppose," said Iola, who had been\r\nquietly listening to and enjoying the conversation.\r\n\r\n"Yes, an\' I\'d ketch myself stan\'in\' still an\' takin\' it," was John\'s\r\nplucky response.\r\n\r\n"Well, you oughter, ef you\'s mean enough to wote dat ticket ter put me\r\nback inter slavery," was Aunt Linda\'s parting shot. "Robby," she\r\ncontinued, "you \'member Miss Nancy\'s Jinnie?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"She married Mr. Gundover\'s Dick. Well, dere warn\'t much git up an\' go\r\n\'bout him. So, wen \'lection time com\'d, de man he war workin\' fer tole\r\nhim ef he woted de radical ticket he\'d turn him off. Well, Jinnie war so\r\n\'fraid he\'d do it, dat she jis\' follered him fer days."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" exclaimed Robert. "How did he come out?"\r\n\r\n"He certainly was between two fires," interposed Iola.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jinnie gained de day. She jis\' got her back up, and said, \'Now ef\r\nyer wote dat ticket ter put me back inter slavery, you take yore rags\r\nan\' go.\' An\' Dick jis\' woted de radical ticket. Jake Williams went on de\r\nSecesh side, woted whar he thought he\'d git his taters, but he got\r\nfooled es slick es greese."\r\n\r\n"How was that?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Some ob dem folks, dat I \'spects buyed his wote, sent him some flour\r\nan\' sugar. So one night his wife hab company ter tea. Dey made a big\r\nspread, an\' put a lot ob sugar on de table fer supper, an\' Tom jis\' went\r\nfer dat sugar. He put a lot in his tea. But somehow it didn\'t tase\r\nright, an\' wen dey come ter fine out what war de matter, dey hab sent\r\nhim a barrel ob san\' wid some sugar on top, an\' wen de sugar war all\r\ngone de san\' war dare. Wen I yeard it, I jis\' split my sides a larfin.\r\nIt war too good to keep; an\' wen it got roun\', Jake war as mad as a\r\nMarch hare. But it sarved him right."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, you musn\'t be too hard on Uncle Jake; you know he\'s\r\ngetting old."\r\n\r\n"Well he ain\'t too ole ter do right. He ain\'t no older dan Uncle Dan\'el.\r\nAn\' I yered dey offered him $500 ef he\'d go on dere side. An\' Uncle\r\nDan\'el wouldn\'t tech it. An\' dere\'s Uncle Job\'s wife; why didn\'t she go\r\ndat way? She war down on Job\'s meanness."\r\n\r\n"What did she do?"\r\n\r\n"Wen \'lection time \'rived, he com\'d home bringing some flour an\' meat;\r\nan\' he says ter Aunt Polly, \'Ole woman, I got dis fer de wote.\' She jis\'\r\npicked up dat meat an\' flour an\' sent it sailin\' outer doors, an\' den\r\ncom\'d back an\' gib him a good tongue-lashin\'. \'Oder people,\' she said,\r\n\'a wotin\' ter lib good, an\' you a sellin\' yore wote! Ain\'t you got \'nuff\r\nob ole Marster, an\' ole Marster bin cuttin\' you up? It shan\'t stay\r\nyere.\' An\' so she wouldn\'t let de things stay in de house."\r\n\r\n"What did Uncle Job do?"\r\n\r\n"He jis\' stood dere an\' cried."\r\n\r\n"And didn\'t you feel sorry for him?" asked Iola.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit! he hedn\'t no business ter be so shabby."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda," pursued Iola, "if it were shabby for an ignorant\r\ncolored man to sell his vote, wasn\'t it shabbier for an intelligent\r\nwhite man to buy it?"\r\n\r\n"You see," added Robert, "all the shabbiness is not on our side."\r\n\r\n"I knows dat," said Aunt Linda, "but I can\'t help it. I wants my people\r\nto wote right, an\' to think somethin\' ob demselves."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, they say in every flock of sheep there will be one\r\nthat\'s scabby," observed Iola.\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so! But I ain\'t got no use fer scabby sheep."\r\n\r\n"Lindy," cried John, "we\'s most dar! Don\'t you yere dat singin\'? Dey\'s\r\nbegun a\'ready."\r\n\r\n"Neber mine," said Aunt Linda, "sometimes de las\' ob de wine is de\r\nbes\'."\r\n\r\nThus discoursing they had beguiled the long hours of the night and made\r\ntheir long journey appear short.\r\n\r\nVery soon they reached the church, a neat, commodious, frame building,\r\nwith a blue ceiling, white walls within and without, and large windows\r\nwith mahogany-colored facings. It was a sight full of pathetic interest\r\nto see that group which gathered from miles around. They had come to\r\nbreak bread with each other, relate their experiences, and tell of their\r\nhopes of heaven. In that meeting were remnants of broken\r\nfamilies--mothers who had been separated from their children before the\r\nwar, husbands who had not met their wives for years. After the bread had\r\nbeen distributed and the handshaking was nearly over, Robert raised the\r\nhymn which Iola had sung for him when he was recovering from his wounds,\r\nand Iola, with her clear, sweet tones, caught up the words and joined\r\nhim in the strain. When the hymn was finished a dear old mother rose\r\nfrom her seat. Her voice was quite strong. With still a lingering light\r\nand fire in her eye, she said:--\r\n\r\n"I rise, bredren an\' sisters, to say I\'m on my solemn march to glory."\r\n\r\n"Amen!" "Glory!" came from a number of voices.\r\n\r\n"I\'se had my trials an\' temptations, my ups an\' downs; but I feels I\'ll\r\nsoon be in one ob de many mansions. If it hadn\'t been for dat hope I\r\n\'spects I would have broken down long ago. I\'se bin through de deep\r\nwaters, but dey didn\'t overflow me; I\'se bin in de fire, but de smell ob\r\nit isn\'t on my garments. Bredren an\' sisters, it war a drefful time when\r\nI war tored away from my pore little chillen."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so!" exclaimed a chorus of voices. Some of her hearers moaned,\r\nothers rocked to and fro, as thoughts of similar scenes in their own\r\nlives arose before them.\r\n\r\n"When my little girl," continued the speaker, "took hole ob my dress an\'\r\nbegged me ter let her go wid me, an\' I couldn\'t do it, it mos\' broke my\r\nheart. I had a little boy, an\' wen my mistus sole me she kep\' him. She\r\ncarried on a boardin\' house. Many\'s the time I hab stole out at night\r\nan\' seen dat chile an\' sleep\'d wid him in my arms tell mos\' day. Bimeby\r\nde people I libed wid got hard up fer money, an\' dey sole me one way an\'\r\nmy pore little gal de oder; an\' I neber laid my eyes on my pore chillen\r\nsence den. But, honeys, let de wind blow high or low, I \'spects to\r\noutwedder de storm an\' anchor by\'m bye in bright glory. But I\'se bin a\r\nprayin\' fer one thing, an\' I beliebs I\'ll git it; an\' dat is dat I may\r\nsee my chillen \'fore I die. Pray fer me dat I may hole out an\' hole on,\r\nan\' neber make a shipwrack ob faith, an\' at las\' fine my way from earth\r\nto glory."\r\n\r\nHaving finished her speech, she sat down and wiped away the tears that\r\nflowed all the more copiously as she remembered her lost children. When\r\nshe rose to speak her voice and manner instantly arrested Robert\'s\r\nattention. He found his mind reverting to the scenes of his childhood.\r\nAs she proceeded his attention became riveted on her. Unbidden tears\r\nfilled his eyes and great sobs shook his frame. He trembled in every\r\nlimb. Could it be possible that after years of patient search through\r\nchurches, papers, and inquiring friends, he had accidentally stumbled on\r\nhis mother--the mother who, long years ago, had pillowed his head upon\r\nher bosom and left her parting kiss upon his lips? How should he reveal\r\nhimself to her? Might not sudden joy do what years of sorrow had failed\r\nto accomplish? Controlling his feelings as best he could, he rose to\r\ntell his experience. He referred to the days when they used to hold\r\ntheir meetings in the lonely woods and gloomy swamps. How they had\r\nprayed for freedom and plotted to desert to the Union army; and\r\ncontinuing, he said: "Since then, brethren and sisters, I have had my\r\ncrosses and trials, but I try to look at the mercies. Just think what it\r\nwas then and what it is now! How many of us, since freedom has come,\r\nhave been looking up our scattered relatives. I have just been over to\r\nvisit my old mistress, Nancy Johnson, and to see if I could get some\r\nclue to my long-lost mother, who was sold from me nearly thirty years\r\nago."\r\n\r\nAgain there was a chorus of moans.\r\n\r\nOn resuming, Robert\'s voice was still fuller of pathos.\r\n\r\n"When," he said, "I heard that dear old mother tell her experience it\r\nseemed as if some one had risen from the dead. She made me think of my\r\nown dear mother, who used to steal out at night to see me, fold me in\r\nher arms, and then steal back again to her work. After she was sold\r\naway I never saw her face again by daylight. I have been looking for her\r\never since the war, and I think at last I have got on the right track.\r\nIf Mrs. Johnson, who kept the boarding-house in C----, is the one who\r\nsold that dear old mother from her son, then she is the one I am looking\r\nfor, and I am the son she has been praying for."\r\n\r\nThe dear old mother raised her eyes. They were clear and tearless. An\r\nexpression of wonder, hope, and love flitted over her face. It seemed as\r\nif her youth were suddenly renewed and, bounding from her seat, she\r\nrushed to the speaker in a paroxysm of joy. "Oh, Robby! Robby! is dis\r\nyou? Is dat my pore, dear boy I\'se been prayin\' \'bout all dese years?\r\nOh, glory! glory!" And overflowing with joyous excitement she threw her\r\narms around him, looking the very impersonation of rapturous content. It\r\nwas a happy time. Mothers whose children had been torn from them in the\r\ndays of slavery knew how to rejoice in her joy. The young people caught\r\nthe infection of the general happiness and rejoiced with them that\r\nrejoiced. There were songs of rejoicing and shouts of praise. The\r\nundertone of sadness which had so often mingled with their songs gave\r\nplace to strains of exultation; and tears of tender sympathy flowed from\r\neyes which had often been blurred by anguish. The child of many prayers\r\nand tears was restored to his mother.\r\n\r\nIola stood by the mother\'s side, smiling, and weeping tears of joy. When\r\nRobert\'s mother observed Iola, she said to Robert, "Is dis yore wife?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," replied Robert, "but I believe she is your grandchild, the\r\ndaughter of the little girl who was sold away from you so long ago. She\r\nis on her way to the farther South in search of her mother."\r\n\r\n"Is she? Dear chile! I hope she\'ll fine her! She puts me in mine ob my\r\npore little Marie. Well, I\'se got one chile, an\' I means to keep on\r\nprayin\' tell I fine my daughter. I\'m _so_ happy! I feel\'s like a new\r\nwoman!"\r\n\r\n"My dear mother," said Robert, "now that I have found you, I mean to\r\nhold you fast just as long as you live. Ever since the war I have been\r\ntrying to find out if you were living, but all efforts failed. At last,\r\nI thought I would come and hunt you myself and, now that I have found\r\nyou, I am going to take you home to live with me, and to be as happy as\r\nthe days are long. I am living in the North, and doing a good business\r\nthere. I want you to see joy according to all the days wherein you have\r\nseen sorrow. I do hope this young lady will find _her_ ma and that, when\r\nfound, she will prove to be your daughter!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, pore, dear chile! I specs her mudder\'s heart\'s mighty hungry fer\r\nher. I does hope she\'s my gran\'chile."\r\n\r\nTenderly and caressingly Iola bent over the happy mother, with her heart\r\nfilled with mournful memories of her own mother.\r\n\r\nAunt Linda was induced to stay until the next morning, and then gladly\r\nassisted Robert\'s mother in arranging for her journey northward. The\r\nfriends who had given her a shelter in their hospitable home, learned to\r\nvalue her so much that it was with great reluctance they resigned her to\r\nthe care of her son. Aunt Linda was full of bustling activity, and her\r\nspirits overflowed with good humor.\r\n\r\n"Now, Harriet," she said, as they rode along on their return journey,\r\n"you mus\' jis\' thank me fer finin\' yore chile, \'cause I got him to come\r\nto dat big meetin\' wid me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lindy," she cried, "I\'se glad from de bottom ob my heart ter see\r\nyou\'s all. I com\'d out dere ter git a blessin\', an\' I\'se got a double\r\npo\'tion. De frens I war libin\' wid war mighty good ter me. Dey lib\'d wid\r\nme in de lower kentry, an\' arter de war war ober I stopped wid \'em and\r\nhelped take keer ob de chillen; an\' when dey com\'d up yere dey brought\r\nme wid \'em. I\'se com\'d a way I didn\'t know, but I\'se mighty glad I\'se\r\ncom\'d."\r\n\r\n"Does you know dis place?" asked Aunt Linda, as they approached the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n"No\'n \'deed I don\'t. It\'s all new ter me."\r\n\r\n"Well, dis is whar I libs. Ain\'t you mighty tired? I feels a little\r\nstiffish. Dese bones is gittin\' ole."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s so! But I\'se mighty glad I\'se lib\'d to see my boy \'fore I crossed\r\nober de riber. An\' now I feel like ole Simeon."\r\n\r\n"But, mother," said Robert, "if you are ready to go, I am not willing to\r\nlet you. I want you to stay ever so long where I can see you."\r\n\r\nA bright smile overspread her face. Robert\'s words reassured and\r\ngladdened her heart. She was well satisfied to have a pleasant aftermath\r\nfrom life on this side of the river.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving home Linda\'s first thought was to prepare dinner for her\r\nguests. But, before she began her work of preparation, she went to the\r\ncupboard to get a cup of home-made wine.\r\n\r\n"Here," she said, filling three glasses, "is some wine I made myself\r\nfrom dat grape-vine out dere. Don\'t it look nice and clar? Jist taste\r\nit. It\'s fus\'rate."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said Robert. "I\'m a temperance man, and never take\r\nanything which has alcohol in it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dis ain\'t got a bit ob alcohol in it. I made it myself."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda, you didn\'t make the law which ferments grape-juice and\r\nmakes it alcohol."\r\n\r\n"But, Robby, ef alcohol\'s so bad, w\'at made de Lord put it here?"\r\n\r\n"Aunt Lindy," said Iola, "I heard a lady say that there were two things\r\nthe Lord didn\'t make. One is sin, and the other alcohol."\r\n\r\n"Why, Aunt Linda," said Robert, "there are numbers of things the Lord\r\nhas made that I wouldn\'t touch with a pair of tongs."\r\n\r\n"What are they?"\r\n\r\n"Rattlesnakes, scorpions, and moccasins."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sho!"\r\n\r\n"Aunt Linda," said Iola, "the Bible says that the wine at last will bite\r\nlike a serpent and sting like an adder."\r\n\r\n"And, Aunt Linda," added Robert, "as I wouldn\'t wind a serpent around my\r\nthroat, I don\'t want to put something inside of it which will bite like\r\na serpent and sting as an adder."\r\n\r\n"I reckon Robby\'s right," said his mother, setting down her glass and\r\nleaving the wine unfinished. "You young folks knows a heap more dan we\r\nole folks." "Well," declared Aunt Linda, "you all is temp\'rence to de\r\nbackbone. But what could I do wid my wine ef we didn\'t drink it?"\r\n\r\n"Let it turn to vinegar, and sign the temperance pledge," replied\r\nRobert.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t keer \'bout it myself, but I don\'t \'spect John would be willin\'\r\nter let it go, \'cause he likes it a heap."\r\n\r\n"Then you must give it up for his sake and Job\'s," said Robert. "They\r\nmay learn to like it too well."\r\n\r\n"You know, Aunt Linda," said Iola, "people don\'t get to be drunkards all\r\nat once. And you wouldn\'t like to feel, if Job should learn to drink,\r\nthat you helped form his appetite."\r\n\r\n"Dat\' so! I beliebs I\'ll let dis turn to winegar, an\' not make any\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Aunt Linda. I hope you\'ll hold to it," said Robert,\r\nencouragingly.\r\n\r\nVery soon Aunt Linda had an excellent dinner prepared. After it was over\r\nRobert went with Iola to C----, where her friend, the bishop, was\r\nawaiting her return. She told him the wonderful story of Robert\'s\r\nfinding his mother, and of her sweet, childlike faith.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, a kind, fatherly man, said, "Miss Iola, I hope that such\r\nhappiness is in store for you. My dear child, still continue to pray and\r\ntrust. I am old-fashioned enough to believe in prayer. I knew an old\r\nlady living in Illinois, who was a slave. Her son got a chance to come\r\nNorth and beg money to buy his mother. The mother was badly treated, and\r\nmade up her mind to run away. But before she started she thought she\r\nwould kneel down to pray. And something, she said, reasoned within her,\r\nand whispered, \'Stand still and see what I am going to do for you.\' So\r\nreal was it to her that she unpacked her bundle and desisted from her\r\nflight. Strange as it may appear to you, her son returned, bringing\r\nwith him money enough to purchase her freedom, and she was redeemed from\r\nbondage. Had she persisted in running away she might have been lost in\r\nthe woods and have died, exhausted by starvation. But she believed, she\r\ntrusted, and was delivered. Her son took her North, where she could find\r\na resting place for the soles of her feet."\r\n\r\nThat night Iola and the bishop left for the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOME FOR MOTHER.\r\n\r\nAfter Iola had left the settlement, accompanied by Robert as far as the\r\ntown, it was a pleasant satisfaction for the two old friends to settle\r\nthemselves down, and talk of times past, departed friends, and\r\nlong-forgotten scenes.\r\n\r\n"What," said Mrs. Johnson, as we shall call Robert\'s mother, "hab become\r\nob Miss Nancy\'s husband? Is he still a libin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he drunk hisself to death," responded Aunt Linda.\r\n\r\n"He used ter be mighty handsome."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but drink war his ruination."\r\n\r\n"An\' how\'s Miss Nancy?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s com\'d down migh\'ly. She\'s pore as a church mouse. I thought\r\n\'twould com\'d home ter her wen she sole yer \'way from yore chillen.\r\nDere\'s nuffin goes ober de debil\'s back dat don\'t come under his belly.\r\nDo yo \'member Miss Nancy\'s fardder?"\r\n\r\n"Ob course I does!"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Aunt Linda, "he war a nice ole gemmen. Wen he died, I said\r\nde las\' gemmen\'s dead, an\' dere\'s noboddy ter step in his shoes."\r\n\r\n"Pore Miss Nancy!" exclaimed Robert\'s mother. "I ain\'t nothin\' agin her.\r\nBut I wouldn\'t swap places wid her, \'cause I\'se got my son; an\' I\r\nbeliebs he\'ll do a good part by me."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Robert, as he entered the room, "I\'ve brought an old\r\nfriend to see you. Do you remember Uncle Daniel?"\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel threw back his head, reached out his hand, and manifested\r\nhis joy with "Well, Har\'yet! is dis you? I neber \'spected to see you in\r\ndese lower grouns! How does yer do? an\' whar hab you bin all dis time?"\r\n\r\n"O, I\'se been tossin\' roun\' \'bout; but it\'s all com\'d right at las\'.\r\nI\'se lib\'d to see my boy \'fore I died."\r\n\r\n"My wife an\' boys is in glory," said Uncle Daniel. "But I \'spects to see\r\n\'em \'fore long. \'Cause I\'se tryin\' to dig deep, build sure, an\' make my\r\nway from earth ter glory."\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s de right kine ob talk, Dan\'el. We ole folks ain\'t got long ter\r\nstay yere."\r\n\r\nThey chatted together until Job and Salters came home for supper. After\r\nthey had eaten, Uncle Daniel said:--\r\n\r\n"We\'ll hab a word ob prayer."\r\n\r\nThere, in that peaceful habitation, they knelt down, and mingled their\r\nprayers together, as they had done in by-gone days, when they had met by\r\nstealth in lonely swamps or silent forests.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Robert and his mother started northward. They were well\r\nsupplied with a bountiful luncheon by Aunt Linda, who had so thoroughly\r\nenjoyed their sojourn with her. On the next day he arrived in the city\r\nof P----, and took his mother to his boarding-house, until he could find\r\na suitable home into which to install her. He soon came across one which\r\njust suited his taste, but when the agent discovered that Robert\'s\r\nmother was colored, he told him that the house had been previously\r\nengaged. In company with his mother he looked at several other houses in\r\ndesirable neighborhoods, but they were constantly met with the answer,\r\n"The house is engaged," or, "We do not rent to colored people."\r\n\r\nAt length Robert went alone, and, finding a desirable house, engaged it,\r\nand moved into it. In a short time it was discovered that he was\r\ncolored, and, at the behest of the local sentiment of the place, the\r\nlandlord used his utmost endeavors to oust him, simply because he\r\nbelonged to an unfashionable and unpopular race. At last he came across\r\na landlord who was broad enough to rent him a good house, and he found a\r\nquiet resting place among a set of well-to-do and well-disposed people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER LIFTING OF THE VEIL.\r\n\r\nIn one of those fearful conflicts by which the Mississippi was freed\r\nfrom Rebel intrusion and opened to commerce Harry was severely wounded,\r\nand forced to leave his place in the ranks for a bed in the hospital.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he lay in his bed, thinking of his former home in\r\nMississippi and wondering if the chances of war would ever restore him\r\nto his loved ones, he fell into a quiet slumber. When he awoke he found\r\na lady bending over him, holding in her hands some fruit and flowers. As\r\nshe tenderly bent over Harry\'s bed their eyes met, and with a thrill of\r\ngladness they recognized each other.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my son, my son!" cried Marie, trying to repress her emotion, as she\r\ntook his wasted hand in hers, and kissed the pale cheeks that sickness\r\nand suffering had blanched. Harry was very weak, but her presence was a\r\ncall to life. He returned the pressure of her hand, kissed it, and his\r\neyes grew full of sudden light, as he murmured faintly, but joyfully:--\r\n\r\n"Mamma; oh, mamma! have I found you at last?"\r\n\r\nThe effort was too much, and he immediately became unconscious.\r\n\r\nAnxious, yet hopeful, Marie sat by the bedside of her son till\r\nconsciousness was restored. Caressingly she bent over his couch,\r\nmurmuring in her happiness the tenderest, sweetest words of motherly\r\nlove. In Harry\'s veins flowed new life and vigor, calming the\r\nrestlessness of his nerves.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible Harry was carried to his mother\'s home; a home\r\nbrought into the light of freedom by the victories of General Grant.\r\nNursed by his mother\'s tender, loving care, he rapidly recovered, but,\r\nbeing too disabled to re-enter the army, he was honorably discharged.\r\n\r\nLorraine had taken Marie to Vicksburg, and there allowed her to engage\r\nin confectionery and preserving for the wealthy ladies of the city. He\r\nhad at first attempted to refugee with her in Texas, but, being foiled\r\nin the attempt, he was compelled to enlist in the Confederate Army, and\r\nmet his fate by being killed just before the surrender of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\n"My dear son," Marie would say, as she bent fondly over him, "I am\r\ndeeply sorry that you are wounded, but I am glad that the fortunes of\r\nwar have brought us together. Poor Iola! I _do_ wonder what has become\r\nof her? Just as soon as this war is over I want you to search the\r\ncountry all over. Poor child! How my heart has ached for her!"\r\n\r\nTime passed on. Harry and his mother searched and inquired for Iola, but\r\nno tidings of her reached them.\r\n\r\nHaving fully recovered his health, and seeing the great need of\r\neducation for the colored people, Harry turned his attention toward\r\nthem, and joined the new army of Northern teachers.\r\n\r\nHe still continued his inquiries for his sister, not knowing whether or\r\nnot she had succumbed to the cruel change in her life. He thought she\r\nmight have passed into the white basis for the sake of bettering her\r\nfortunes. Hope deferred, which had sickened his mother\'s heart, had\r\nonly roused him to renewed diligence.\r\n\r\nA school was offered him in Georgia, and thither he repaired, taking his\r\nmother with him. They were soon established in the city of A----. In\r\nhope of finding Iola he visited all the conferences of the Methodist\r\nChurch, but for a long time his search was in vain.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Harry, one day during his vacation, "there is to be a\r\nMethodist Conference in this State in the city of S----, about one\r\nhundred and fifty miles from here. I intend to go and renew my search\r\nfor Iola."\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" burst out Marie, as the tears gathered in her eyes, "I\r\nwonder if she is living."\r\n\r\n"I think so," said Harry, kissing the pale cheek of his mother; "I don\'t\r\nfeel that Iola is dead. I believe we will find her before long."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me my heart would burst with joy to see my dear child just\r\nonce more. I am glad that you are going. When will you leave?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, my son, go, and my prayers will go with you," was Marie\'s tender\r\nparting wish.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning Harry started for the conference, and reached the\r\nchurch before the morning session was over. Near him sat two ladies, one\r\nfair, the other considerably darker. There was something in the fairer\r\none that reminded him forcibly of his sister, but she was much older and\r\ngraver than he imagined his sister to be. Instantly he dismissed the\r\nthought that had forced itself into his mind, and began to listen\r\nattentively to the proceedings of the conference.\r\n\r\nWhen the regular business of the morning session was over the bishop\r\narose and said:--\r\n\r\n"I have an interesting duty to perform. I wish to introduce a young lady\r\nto the conference, who was the daughter of a Mississippi planter. She is\r\nnow in search of her mother and brother, from whom she was sold a few\r\nmonths before the war. Her father married her mother in Ohio, where he\r\nhad taken her to be educated. After his death they were robbed of their\r\ninheritance and enslaved by a distant relative named Lorraine. Miss Iola\r\nLeroy is the young lady\'s name. If any one can give the least\r\ninformation respecting the objects of her search it will be thankfully\r\nreceived."\r\n\r\n"I can," exclaimed a young man, rising in the midst of the audience, and\r\npressing eagerly, almost impetuously, forward. "I am her brother, and I\r\ncame here to look for her."\r\n\r\nIola raised her eyes to his face, so flushed and bright with the glow of\r\nrecognition, rushed to him, threw her arms around his neck, kissed him\r\nagain and again, crying: "O, Harry!" Then she fainted from excitement.\r\nThe women gathered around her with expressions of tender sympathy, and\r\ngave her all the care she needed. They called her the "dear child," for\r\nwithout any effort on her part she had slidden into their hearts and\r\nfound a ready welcome in each sympathizing bosom.\r\n\r\nHarry at once telegraphed the glad tidings to his mother, who waited\r\ntheir coming with joyful anticipation. Long before the cars reached the\r\ncity, Mrs. Leroy was at the depot, restlessly walking the platform or\r\neagerly peering into the darkness to catch the first glimpse of the\r\ntrain which was bearing her treasures.\r\n\r\nAt length the cars arrived, and, as Harry and Iola alighted, Marie\r\nrushed forward, clasped Iola in her arms and sobbed out her joy in\r\nbroken words.\r\n\r\nVery happy was the little family that sat together around the\r\nsupper-table for the first time for years. They partook of that supper\r\nwith thankful hearts and with eyes overflowing with tears of joy. Very\r\ntouching were the prayers the mother uttered, when she knelt with her\r\nchildren that night to return thanks for their happy reunion, and to\r\nseek protection through the slumbers of the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as they sat at the breakfast-table, Marie said:\r\n\r\n"My dear child, you are so changed I do not think I would have known you\r\nif I had met you in the street!"\r\n\r\n"And I," said Harry, "can hardly realize that you are our own Iola, whom\r\nI recognized as sister a half dozen years ago."\r\n\r\n"Am I so changed?" asked Iola, as a faint sigh escaped her lips.\r\n\r\n"Why, Iola," said Harry, "you used to be the most harum-scarum girl I\r\never knew, laughing, dancing, and singing from morning until night."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember," said Iola. "It all comes back to me like a dream. Oh,\r\nmamma! I have passed through a fiery ordeal of suffering since then. But\r\nit is useless," and as she continued her face assumed a brighter look,\r\n"to brood over the past. Let us be happy in the present. Let me tell you\r\nsomething which will please you. Do you remember telling me about your\r\nmother and brother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Marie, in a questioning tone."\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Iola, with eyes full of gladness, "I think I have\r\nfound them."\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible!" exclaimed Marie, in astonishment. "It is more than\r\nthirty years since we parted. I fear you are mistaken."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; I have drawn my conclusions from good circumstantial\r\nevidence. After I was taken from you, I passed through a fearful siege\r\nof suffering, which would only harrow up your soul to hear. I often\r\nshudder at the remembrance. The last man in whose clutches I found\r\nmyself was mean, brutal, and cruel. I was in his power when the Union\r\narmy came into C----, where I was living. A number of colored men\r\nstampeded to the Union ranks, with a gentleman as a leader, whom I think\r\nis your brother. A friend of his reported my case to the commander of\r\nthe post, who instantly gave orders for my release. A place was given me\r\nas nurse in the hospital. I attended that friend in his last illness.\r\nPoor fellow! he was the best friend I had in all the time I have been\r\ntossing about. The gentleman whom I think is your brother appeared to be\r\nvery anxious about his friend\'s recovery, and was deeply affected by his\r\ndeath. In one of the last terrible battles of the war, that of Five\r\nForks, he was wounded and put into the hospital ward where I was an\r\nattendant. For awhile he was delirious, and in his delirium he would\r\nsometimes think that I was his mother and at other times his sister. I\r\nhumored his fancies, would often sing to him when he was restless, and\r\nmy voice almost invariably soothed him to sleep. One day I sang to him\r\nthat old hymn we used to sing on the plantation:--\r\n\r\n    "Drooping souls no longer grieve,\r\n          Heaven is propitious;\r\n     If on Christ you do believe,\r\n          You will find Him precious."\r\n\r\n"I remember," said Marie, with a sigh, as memories of the past swept\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n"After I had finished the hymn," continued Iola, "he looked earnestly\r\nand inquiringly into my face, and asked, \'Where did you learn that hymn?\r\nI have heard my mother sing it when I was a boy, but I have never heard\r\nit since.\' I think, mamma, the words, \'I was lost but now I\'m found;\r\nglory! glory! glory!\' had imprinted themselves on his memory, and that\r\nhis mind was assuming a higher state of intellectuality. He asked me to\r\nsing it again, which I did, until he fell asleep. Then I noticed a\r\nmarked resemblance between him and Harry, and I thought, \'Suppose he\r\nshould prove to be your long-lost brother?\' During his convalescence we\r\nfound that we had a common ground of sympathy. We were anxious to be\r\nreunited to our severed relations. We had both been separated from our\r\nmothers. He told me of his little sister, with whom he used to play. She\r\nhad a mole on her cheek which he called her beauty spot. He had the red\r\nspot on his forehead which you told me of."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIGHTFUL REUNIONS.\r\n\r\nVery bright and happy was the home where Marie and her children were\r\ngathered under one roof. Mrs. Leroy\'s neighbors said she looked ten\r\nyears younger. Into that peaceful home came no fearful forebodings of\r\ncruel separations. Harry and Iola were passionately devoted to their\r\nmother, and did all they could to flood her life with sunshine.\r\n\r\n"Iola, dear," said Harry, one morning at the breakfast-table, "I have a\r\nnew pleasure in store for you."\r\n\r\n"What is it, brother mine?" asked Iola, assuming an air of interest.\r\n\r\n"There is a young lady living in this city to whom I wish to introduce\r\nyou. She is one of the most remarkable women I have ever met."\r\n\r\n"Do tell me all about her," said Iola. "Is she young and handsome,\r\nbrilliant and witty?\r\n\r\n"She," replied Harry, "is more than handsome, she is lovely; more than\r\nwitty, she is wise; more than brilliant, she is excellent."\r\n\r\n"Well, Harry," said Mrs. Leroy, smiling, "if you keep on that way I\r\nshall begin to fear that I shall soon be supplanted by a new daughter."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mamma," replied Harry, looking slightly confused, "I did not\r\nmean that."\r\n\r\n"Well, Harry," said Iola, amused, "go on with your description; I am\r\nbecoming interested. Tax your powers of description to give me her\r\nlikeness."\r\n\r\n"Well, in the first place," continued Harry, "I suppose she is about\r\ntwenty-five years old."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the idea," interrupted Iola, "of a gentleman talking of a lady\'s\r\nage. That is a tabooed subject."\r\n\r\n"Why, Iola, that adds to the interest of my picture. It is her\r\ncombination of earnestness and youthfulness which enhances her in my\r\nestimation."\r\n\r\n"Pardon the interruption," said Iola; "I am anxious to hear more about\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Well, she is of medium height, somewhat slender, and well formed, with\r\ndark, expressive eyes, full of thought and feeling. Neither hair nor\r\ncomplexion show the least hint of blood admixture."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it," said Iola. "Every person of unmixed blood who\r\nsucceeds in any department of literature, art, or science is a living\r\nargument for the capability which is in the race."\r\n\r\n"Yes," responded Harry, "for it is not the white blood which is on trial\r\nbefore the world. Well, I will bring her around this evening."\r\n\r\nIn the evening Harry brought Miss Delany to call on his sister and\r\nmother. They were much pleased with their visitor. Her manner was a\r\ncombination of suavity and dignity. During the course of the evening\r\nthey learned that she was a graduate of the University of A----. One day\r\nshe saw in the newspapers that colored women were becoming unfit to be\r\nservants for white people. She then thought that if they are not fit to\r\nbe servants for white people, they are unfit to be mothers to their own\r\nchildren, and she conceived the idea of opening a school to train future\r\nwives and mothers. She began on a small scale, in a humble building,\r\nand her work was soon crowned with gratifying success. She had enlarged\r\nher quarters, increased her teaching force, and had erected a large and\r\ncommodious school-house through her own exertions and the help of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nMarie cordially invited her to call again, saying, as she rose to go: "I\r\nam very glad to have met you. Young women like you always fill my heart\r\nwith hope for the future of our race. In you I see reflected some of the\r\nblessed possibilities which lie within us."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Miss Delany, "I want to be classed among those of whom\r\nit is said, \'She has done what she could.\'"\r\n\r\nVery pleasant was the acquaintance which sprang up between Miss Delany\r\nand Iola. Although she was older than Iola, their tastes were so\r\ncongenial, their views of life and duty in such unison, that their\r\nacquaintance soon ripened into strong and lasting friendship. There were\r\nno foolish rivalries and jealousies between them. Their lives were too\r\nfull of zeal and earnestness for them to waste in selfishness their\r\npower to be moral and spiritual forces among a people who so much needed\r\ntheir helping hands. Miss Delany gave Iola a situation in her school;\r\nbut before the term was quite over she was force to resign, her health\r\nhaving been so undermined by the fearful strain through which she had\r\npassed, that she was quite unequal to the task. She remained at home,\r\nand did what her strength would allow in assisting her mother in the\r\nwork of canning and preserving fruits.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Iola had been corresponding with Robert. She had told\r\nhim of her success in finding her mother and brother, and had received\r\nan answer congratulating her on the glad fruition of her hopes. He also\r\nsaid that his business was flourishing, that his mother was keeping\r\nhouse for him, and, to use her own expression, was as happy as the days\r\nare long. She was firmly persuaded that Marie was her daughter, and she\r\nwanted to see her before she died.\r\n\r\n"There is one thing," continued the letter, "that your mother may\r\nremember her by. It was a little handkerchief on which were a number of\r\ncats\' heads. She gave one to each of us."\r\n\r\n"I remember it well," said Marie, "she must, indeed, be my mother. Now,\r\nall that is needed to complete my happiness is her presence, and my\r\nbrother\'s. And I intend, if I live long enough, to see them both."\r\n\r\nIola wrote Robert that her mother remembered the incident of the\r\nhandkerchief, and was anxious to see them.\r\n\r\nIn the early fall Robert started for the South in order to clear up all\r\ndoubts with respect to their relationship. He found Iola, Harry, and\r\ntheir mother living cosily together. Harry was teaching and was a leader\r\namong the rising young men of the State. His Northern education and\r\nlater experience had done much toward adapting him to the work of the\r\nnew era which had dawned upon the South.\r\n\r\nMarie was very glad to welcome Robert to her home, but it was almost\r\nimpossible to recognize her brother in that tall, handsome man, with\r\ndark-brown eyes and wealth of chestnut-colored hair, which he readily\r\nlifted to show the crimson spot which lay beneath it.\r\n\r\nBut as they sat together, and recalled the long-forgotten scenes of\r\ntheir childhood, they concluded that they were brother and sister.\r\n\r\n"Marie," said Robert, "how would you like to leave the South?"\r\n\r\n"I should like to go North, but I hate to leave Harry. He\'s a splendid\r\nyoung fellow, although I say it myself. He is so fearless and outspoken\r\nthat I am constantly anxious about him, especially at election time."\r\n\r\nHarry then entered the room, and, being introduced to Robert, gave him a\r\ncordial welcome. He had just returned from school.\r\n\r\n"We were talking of you, my son," said Marie.\r\n\r\n"What were you saying? Nothing of the absent but good?" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n"I was telling your uncle, who wants me to come North, that I would go,\r\nbut I am afraid that you will get into trouble and be murdered, as many\r\nothers have been."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, mother, I shall not die till my time comes. And if I die\r\nhelping the poor and needy, I shall die at my post. Could a man choose a\r\nbetter place to die?"\r\n\r\n"Were you aware of the virulence of caste prejudice and the disabilities\r\nwhich surround the colored people when you cast your lot with them?"\r\nasked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Not fully," replied Harry; "but after I found out that I was colored, I\r\nconsulted the principal of the school, where I was studying, in\r\nreference to the future. He said that if I stayed in the North, he had\r\nfriends whom he believed would give me any situation I could fill, and I\r\ncould simply take my place in the rank of workers, the same as any other\r\nman. Then he told me of the army, and I made up my mind to enter it,\r\nactuated by a desire to find my mother and sister; and at any rate I\r\nwanted to avenge their wrongs. I do not feel so now. Since I have seen\r\nthe fearful ravages of war, I have learned to pity and forgive. The\r\nprincipal said he thought I would be more apt to find my family if I\r\njoined a colored regiment in the West than if I joined one of the Maine\r\ncompanies. I confess at first I felt a shrinking from taking the step,\r\nbut love for my mother overcame all repugnance on my part. Now that I\r\nhave linked my fortunes to the race I intend to do all I can for its\r\nelevation."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Robert gazed admiringly on the young face, lit up by noble\r\npurposes and lofty enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"You are right, Harry. I think it would be treason, not only to the\r\nrace, but to humanity, to have you ignoring your kindred and\r\nmasquerading as a white man."\r\n\r\n"I think so, too," said Marie.\r\n\r\n"But, sister, I am anxious for you all to come North. If Harry feels\r\nthat the place of danger is the post of duty, let him stay, and he can\r\nspend his vacations with us. I think both you and Iola need rest and\r\nchange. Mother longs to see you before she dies. She feels that we have\r\nbeen the children of many prayers and tears, and I want to make her last\r\ndays as happy as possible. The South has not been a paradise to you all\r\nthe time, and I should think you would be willing to leave it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so. Iola needs rest and change, and she would be such a\r\ncomfort to mother. I suppose, for her sake, I will consent to have her\r\ngo back with you, at least for awhile."\r\n\r\nIn a few days, with many prayers and tears, Marie, half reluctantly,\r\npermitted Iola to start for the North in company with Robert Johnson,\r\nintending to follow as soon as she could settle her business and see\r\nHarry in a good boarding place.\r\n\r\nVery joyful was the greeting of the dear grandmother. Iola soon nestled\r\nin her heart and lent additional sunshine to her once checkered life,\r\nand Robert, who had so long been robbed of kith and kin, was delighted\r\nwith the new accession to his home life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Robert," said Iola, after she had been North several weeks, "I\r\nhave a theory that every woman ought to know how to earn her own living.\r\nI believe that a great amount of sin and misery springs from the\r\nweakness and inefficiency of women."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps that\'s so, but what are you going to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to join the great rank of bread-winners. Mr. Waterman has\r\nadvertised for a number of saleswomen, and I intend to make\r\napplication."\r\n\r\n"When he advertises for help he means white women," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"He said nothing about color," responded Iola.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he did. He doesn\'t expect any colored girl to apply."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think I could fill the place. At least I should like to try.\r\nAnd I do not think when I apply that I am in duty bound to tell him my\r\ngreat-grandmother was a negro."\r\n\r\n"Well, child, there is no necessity for you to go out to work. You are\r\nperfectly welcome here, and I hope that you feel so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I certainly do. But still I would rather earn my own living."\r\n\r\nThat morning Iola applied for the situation, and, being prepossessing in\r\nher appearance, she obtained it.\r\n\r\nFor awhile everything went as pleasantly as a marriage bell. But one day\r\na young colored lady, well-dressed and well-bred in her manner, entered\r\nthe store. It was an acquaintance which Iola had formed in the colored\r\nchurch which she attended. Iola gave her a few words of cordial\r\ngreeting, and spent a few moments chatting with her. The attention of\r\nthe girls who sold at the same counter was attracted, and their\r\nsuspicion awakened. Iola was a stranger in that city. Who was she, and\r\nwho were her people? At last it was decided that one of the girls should\r\nact as a spy, and bring what information she could concerning Iola.\r\n\r\nThe spy was successful. She found out that Iola was living in a good\r\nneighborhood, but that none of the neighbors knew her. The man of the\r\nhouse was very fair, but there was an old woman whom Iola called\r\n"Grandma," and she was unmistakably colored. The story was sufficient.\r\nIf that were true, Iola must be colored, and she should be treated\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing the cause, Iola noticed a chill in the social atmosphere\r\nof the store, which communicated itself to the cash-boys, and they\r\ntreated her so insolently that her situation became very uncomfortable.\r\nShe saw the proprietor, resigned her position, and asked for and\r\nobtained a letter of recommendation to another merchant who had\r\nadvertised for a saleswoman.\r\n\r\nIn applying for the place, she took the precaution to inform her\r\nemployer that she was colored. It made no difference to him; but he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say anything about it to the girls. They might not be willing to\r\nwork with you."\r\n\r\nIola smiled, did not promise, and accepted the situation. She entered\r\nupon her duties, and proved quite acceptable as a saleswoman.\r\n\r\nOne day, during an interval in business, the girls began to talk of\r\ntheir respective churches, and the question was put to Iola:--\r\n\r\n"Where do you go to church?"\r\n\r\n"I go," she replied, "to Rev. River\'s church, corner of Eighth and L\r\nStreets."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; you must be mistaken. There is no church there except a colored\r\none."\r\n\r\n"That is where I go."\r\n\r\n"Why do you go there?"\r\n\r\n"Because I liked it when I came here, and joined it."\r\n\r\n"A member of a colored church? What under heaven possessed you to do\r\nsuch a thing?"\r\n\r\n"Because I wished to be with my own people."\r\n\r\nHere the interrogator stopped, and looked surprised and pained, and\r\nalmost instinctively moved a little farther from her. After the store\r\nwas closed, the girls had an animated discussion, which resulted in the\r\ninformation being sent to Mr. Cohen that Iola was a colored girl, and\r\nthat they protested against her being continued in his employ. Mr. Cohen\r\nyielded to the pressure, and informed Iola that her services were no\r\nlonger needed.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert came home in the evening, he found that Iola had lost her\r\nsituation, and was looking somewhat discouraged.\r\n\r\n"Well, uncle," she said, "I feel out of heart. It seems as if the\r\nprejudice pursues us through every avenue of life, and assigns us the\r\nlowest places."\r\n\r\n"That is so," replied Robert, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"And yet I am determined," said Iola, "to win for myself a place in the\r\nfields of labor. I have heard of a place in New England, and I mean to\r\ntry for it, even if I only stay a few months."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you _will_ go, say nothing about your color."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Robert, I see no necessity for proclaiming that fact on the\r\nhouse-top. Yet I am resolved that nothing shall tempt me to deny it. The\r\nbest blood in my veins is African blood, and I am not ashamed of it."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah for you!" exclaimed Robert, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\nAs Iola wished to try the world for herself, and so be prepared for any\r\nemergency, her uncle and grandmother were content to have her go to New\r\nEngland. The town to which she journeyed was only a few hours\' ride from\r\nthe city of P----, and Robert, knowing that there is no teacher like\r\nexperience, was willing that Iola should have the benefit of her\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nIola, on arriving in H----, sought the firm, and was informed that her\r\nservices were needed. She found it a pleasant and lucrative position.\r\nThere was only one drawback--her boarding place was too far from her\r\nwork. There was an institution conducted by professed Christian women,\r\nwhich was for the special use of respectable young working girls. This\r\nwas in such a desirable location that she called at the house to engage\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe matron conducted her over the house, and grew so friendly in the\r\ninterview that she put her arm around her, and seemed to look upon Iola\r\nas a desirable accession to the home. But, just as Iola was leaving, she\r\nsaid to the matron: "I must be honest with you; I am a colored woman."\r\n\r\nSwift as light a change passed over the face of the matron. She withdrew\r\nher arm from Iola, and said: "I must see the board of managers about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nWhen the board met, Iola\'s case was put before them, but they decided\r\nnot to receive her. And these women, professors of a religion which\r\ntaught, "If ye have respect to persons ye commit sin," virtually shut\r\nthe door in her face because of the outcast blood in her veins.\r\n\r\nConsiderable feeling was aroused by the action of these women, who, to\r\nsay the least, had not put their religion in the most favorable light.\r\n\r\nIola continued to work for the firm until she received letters from her\r\nmother and uncle, which informed her that her mother, having arranged\r\nher affairs in the South, was ready to come North. She then resolved to\r\nreturn, to the city of P----, to be ready to welcome her mother on her\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nIola arrived in time to see that everything was in order for her\r\nmother\'s reception. Her room was furnished neatly, but with those\r\ntouches of beauty that womanly hands are such adepts in giving. A few\r\ncharming pictures adorned the walls, and an easy chair stood waiting to\r\nreceive the travel-worn mother. Robert and Iola met her at the depot;\r\nand grandma was on her feet at the first sound of the bell, opened the\r\ndoor, clasped Marie to her heart, and nearly fainted for joy.\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible dat dis is my little Marie?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nIt did seem almost impossible to realize that this faded woman, with\r\npale cheeks and prematurely whitened hair, was the rosy-cheeked child\r\nfrom whom she had been parted more than thirty years.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Robert, after the first joyous greeting was over, "love is\r\na very good thing, but Marie has had a long journey and needs something\r\nthat will stick by the ribs. How about dinner, mother?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all ready," said Mrs. Johnson.\r\n\r\nAfter Marie had gone to her room and changed her dress, she came down\r\nand partook of the delicious repast which her mother and Iola had\r\nprepared for her.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Marie was settled in the home, and was well pleased with\r\nthe change. The only drawback to her happiness was the absence of her\r\nson, and she expected him to come North after the closing of his school.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Robert," said Iola, after her mother had been with them several\r\nweeks, "I am tired of being idle."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" asked Robert. "You are surely not going East\r\nagain, and leave your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not," said Marie, anxiously. "I have been so long without\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma, I am not going East. I can get suitable employment here in\r\nthe city of P----."\r\n\r\n"But, Iola," said Robert, "you have tried, and been defeated. Why\r\nsubject yourself to the same experience again?"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Robert, I think that every woman should have some skill or art\r\nwhich would insure her at least a comfortable support. I believe there\r\nwould be less unhappy marriages if labor were more honored among women."\r\n\r\n"Well, Iola," said her mother, "what is your skill?"\r\n\r\n"Nursing. I was very young when I went into the hospital, but I\r\nsucceeded so well that the doctor said I must have been a born nurse.\r\nNow, I see by the papers, that a gentleman who has an invalid daughter\r\nwants some one who can be a nurse and companion for her, and I mean to\r\napply for the situation. I do not think, if I do my part well in that\r\nposition, that the blood in my veins will be any bar to my success."\r\n\r\nA troubled look stole over Marie\'s face. She sighed faintly, but made no\r\nremonstrance. And so it was decided that Iola should apply for the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIola made application, and was readily accepted. Her patient was a frail\r\ngirl of fifteen summers, who was ill with a low fever. Iola nursed her\r\ncarefully, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing her restored to\r\nhealth. During her stay, Mr. Cloten, the father of the invalid, had\r\nlearned some of the particulars of Iola\'s Northern experience as a\r\nbread-winner, and he resolved to give her employment in his store when\r\nher services were no longer needed in the house. As soon as a vacancy\r\noccurred he gave Iola a place in his store.\r\n\r\nThe morning she entered on her work he called his employ\xe9s together, and\r\ntold them that Miss Iola had colored blood in her veins, but that he was\r\ngoing to employ her and give her a desk. If any one objected to working\r\nwith her, he or she could step to the cashier\'s desk and receive what\r\nwas due. Not a man remonstrated, not a woman demurred; and Iola at last\r\nfound a place in the great army of bread-winners, which the traditions\r\nof her blood could not affect.\r\n\r\n"How did you succeed?" asked Mrs. Cloten of her husband, when he\r\nreturned to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Admirably! \'Everything is lovely and the goose hangs high.\' I gave my\r\nemploy\xe9s to understand that they could leave if they did not wish to\r\nwork with Miss Leroy. Not one of them left, or showed any disposition\r\nto rebel."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad," said Mrs. Cloten. "I am ashamed of the way she has been\r\ntreated in our city, when seeking to do her share in the world\'s work. I\r\nam glad that you were brave enough to face this cruel prejudice, and\r\ngive her a situation."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear, do not make me a hero for a single act. I am grateful\r\nfor the care Miss Leroy gave our Daisy. Money can buy services, but it\r\ncannot purchase tender, loving sympathy. I was also determined to let my\r\nemploy\xe9s know that I, not they, commanded my business. So, do not crown\r\nme a hero until I have won a niche in the temple of fame. In dealing\r\nwith Southern prejudice against the negro, we Northerners could do it\r\nwith better grace if we divested ourselves of our own. We irritate the\r\nSouth by our criticisms, and, while I confess that there is much that is\r\nreprehensible in their treatment of colored people, yet if our Northern\r\ncivilization is higher than theirs we should \'criticise by creation.\' We\r\nshould stamp ourselves on the South, and not let the South stamp itself\r\non us. When we have learned to treat men according to the complexion of\r\ntheir souls, and not the color of their skins, we will have given our\r\nbest contribution towards the solution of the negro problem."\r\n\r\n"I feel, my dear," said Mrs. Cloten, "that what you have done is a right\r\nstep in the right direction, and I hope that other merchants will do the\r\nsame. We have numbers of business men, rich enough to afford themselves\r\nthe luxury of a good conscience."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD FRIEND.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Miss Leroy," said a cheery voice in tones of glad\r\nsurprise, and, intercepting her path, Dr. Gresham stood before Iola,\r\nsmiling, and reaching out his hand.\r\n\r\n"Why, Dr. Gresham, is this you?" said Iola, lifting her eyes to that\r\nwell-remembered face. "It has been several years since we met. How have\r\nyou been all this time, and where?"\r\n\r\n"I have been sick, and am just now recovering from malaria and nervous\r\nprostration. I am attending a medical convention in this city, and hope\r\nthat I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again."\r\n\r\nIola hesitated, and then replied: "I should be pleased to have you\r\ncall."\r\n\r\n"It would give me great pleasure. Where shall I call?"\r\n\r\n"My home is 1006 South Street, but I am only at home in the evenings."\r\n\r\nThey walked together a short distance till they reached Mr. Cloten\'s\r\nstore; then, bidding the doctor good morning, Iola left him repeating to\r\nhimself the words of his favorite poet:--\r\n\r\n    "Thou art too lovely and precious a gem\r\n      To be bound to their burdens and sullied by them."\r\n\r\nNo one noticed the deep flush on Iola\'s face as she entered the store,\r\nnor the subdued, quiet manner with which she applied herself to her\r\ntasks. She was living over again the past, with its tender, sad, and\r\nthrilling reminiscences.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Dr. Gresham called on Iola. She met him with a pleasant\r\nwelcome. Dr. Gresham gazed upon her with unfeigned admiration, and\r\nthought that the years, instead of detracting from, had only\r\nintensified, her loveliness. He had thought her very beautiful in the\r\nhospital, in her gray dress and white collar, with her glorious wealth\r\nof hair drawn over her ears. But now, when he saw her with that hair\r\nartistically arranged, and her finely-proportioned form arrayed in a\r\ndark crimson dress, relieved by a shimmer of lace and a bow of white\r\nribbon at her throat, he thought her superbly handsome. The lines which\r\ncare had written upon her young face had faded away. There was no\r\nundertone of sorrow in her voice as she stood up before him in the calm\r\nloveliness of her ripened womanhood, radiant in beauty and gifted in\r\nintellect. Time and failing health had left their traces upon Dr.\r\nGresham. His step was less bounding, his cheek a trifle paler, his\r\nmanner somewhat graver than it was when he had parted from Iola in the\r\nhospital, but his meeting with her had thrilled his heart with\r\nunexpected pleasure. Hopes and sentiments which long had slept awoke at\r\nthe touch of her hand and the tones of her voice, and Dr. Gresham found\r\nhimself turning to the past, with its sad memories and disappointed\r\nhopes. No other face had displaced her image in his mind; no other love\r\nhad woven itself around every tendril of his soul. His heart and hand\r\nwere just as free as they were the hour they had parted.\r\n\r\n"To see you again," said Dr. Gresham, "is a great and unexpected\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\n"You had not forgotten me, then?" said Iola, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Forget you! I would just as soon forget my own existence. I do not\r\nthink that time will ever efface the impressions of those days in which\r\nwe met so often. When last we met you were intending to search for your\r\nmother. Have you been successful?"\r\n\r\n"More than successful," said Iola, with a joyous ring in her voice. "I\r\nhave found my mother, brother, grandmother, and uncle, and, except my\r\nbrother, we are all living together, and we are so happy. Excuse me a\r\nfew minutes," she said, and left the room. Iola soon returned, bringing\r\nwith her her mother and grandmother.\r\n\r\n"These," said Iola, introducing her mother and grandmother, "are the\r\nonce-severed branches of our family; and this gentleman you have seen\r\nbefore," continued Iola, as Robert entered the room.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham looked scrutinizingly at him and said: "Your face looks\r\nfamiliar, but I saw so many faces at the hospital that I cannot just now\r\nrecall your name."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Robert Johnson, "I was one of your last patients, and I\r\nwas with Tom Anderson when he died."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," replied Dr. Gresham; "it all comes back to me. You were\r\nwounded at the battle of Five Forks, were you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"I saw you when you were recovering. You told me that you thought you\r\nhad a clue to your lost relatives, from whom you had been so long\r\nseparated. How have you succeeded?"\r\n\r\n"Admirably! I have been fortunate in finding my mother, my sister, and\r\nher children."\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed! I am delighted to hear it. Where are they?"\r\n\r\n"They are right here. This is my mother," said Robert, bending fondly\r\nover her, as she returned his recognition with an expression of intense\r\nsatisfaction; "and this," he continued, "is my sister, and Miss Leroy is\r\nmy niece."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? I am very glad to hear it. It has been said that every\r\ncloud has its silver lining, and the silver lining of our war cloud is\r\nthe redemption of a race and the reunion of severed hearts. War is a\r\ndreadful thing; but worse than the war was the slavery which preceded\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Slavery," said Iola, "was a fearful cancer eating into the nation\'s\r\nheart, sapping its vitality, and undermining its life."\r\n\r\n"And war," said Dr. Gresham, "was the dreadful surgery by which the\r\ndisease was eradicated. The cancer has been removed, but for years to\r\ncome I fear that we will have to deal with the effects of the disease.\r\nBut I believe that we have vitality enough to outgrow those effects."\r\n\r\n"I think, Doctor," said Iola, "that there is but one remedy by which our\r\nnation can recover from the evil entailed upon her by slavery."\r\n\r\n"What is that?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"A fuller comprehension of the claims of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and\r\ntheir application to our national life."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Robert; "while politicians are stumbling on the barren\r\nmountains of fretful controversy and asking what shall we do with the\r\nnegro? I hold that Jesus answered that question nearly two thousand\r\nyears ago when he said, \'Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,\r\ndo ye even so to them.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Gresham; "the application of that rule in dealing with\r\nthe negro would solve the whole problem."\r\n\r\n"Slavery," said Mrs. Leroy, "is dead, but the spirit which animated it\r\nstill lives; and I think that a reckless disregard for human life is\r\nmore the outgrowth of slavery than any actual hatred of the negro."\r\n\r\n"The problem of the nation," continued Dr. Gresham, "is not what men\r\nwill do with the negro, but what will they do with the reckless, lawless\r\nwhite men who murder, lynch and burn their fellow-citizens. To me these\r\nlynchings and burnings are perfectly alarming. Both races have reacted\r\non each other--men fettered the slave and cramped their own souls;\r\ndenied him knowledge, and darkened their spiritual insight; subdued him\r\nto the pliancy of submission, and in their turn became the thralls of\r\npublic opinion. The negro came here from the heathenism of Africa; but\r\nthe young colonies could not take into their early civilization a stream\r\nof barbaric blood without being affected by its influence and the negro,\r\npoor and despised as he is, has laid his hands on our Southern\r\ncivilization and helped mould its character."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Leroy; "the colored nurse could not nestle her master\'s\r\nchild in her arms, hold up his baby footsteps on their floors, and walk\r\nwith him through the impressible and formative period of his young life\r\nwithout leaving upon him the impress of her hand."\r\n\r\n"I am glad," said Robert, "for the whole nation\'s sake, that slavery\r\nhas been destroyed."\r\n\r\n"And our work," said Dr. Gresham, "is to build over the desolations of\r\nthe past a better and brighter future. The great distinction between\r\nsavagery and civilization is the creation and maintenance of law.\r\nA people cannot habitually trample on law and justice without\r\nretrograding toward barbarism. But I am hopeful that time will bring us\r\nchanges for the better; that, as we get farther away from the war, we\r\nwill outgrow the animosities and prejudices engendered by slavery. The\r\nshort-sightedness of our fathers linked the negro\'s destiny to ours. We\r\nare feeling the friction of the ligatures which bind us together, but I\r\nhope that the time will speedily come when the best members of both\r\nraces will unite for the maintenance of law and order and the progress\r\nand prosperity of the country, and that the intelligence and virtue of\r\nthe South will be strong to grapple effectually with its ignorance and\r\nvice."\r\n\r\n"I hope that time will speedily come," said Marie. "My son is in the\r\nSouth, and I am always anxious for his safety. He is not only a teacher,\r\nbut a leading young man in the community where he lives."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Robert, "and when I see the splendid work he is doing in the\r\nSouth, I am glad that, instead of trying to pass for a white man, he has\r\ncast his lot with us."\r\n\r\n"But," answered Dr. Gresham, "he would possess advantages as a white man\r\nwhich he could not if he were known to be colored."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Iola, decidedly, "he has greater advantages as a colored\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I do not understand you," said Dr. Gresham, looking somewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," continued Iola, "I do not think life\'s highest advantages are\r\nthose that we can see with our eyes or grasp with our hands. To whom\r\nto-day is the world most indebted--to its millionaires or to its\r\nmartyrs?"\r\n\r\n"Taking it from the ideal standpoint," replied the doctor, "I should say\r\nits martyrs."\r\n\r\n"To be," continued Iola, "the leader of a race to higher planes of\r\nthought and action, to teach men clearer views of life and duty, and to\r\ninspire their souls with loftier aims, is a far greater privilege than\r\nit is to open the gates of material prosperity and fill every home with\r\nsensuous enjoyment."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Mrs. Leroy, her face aglow with fervid feeling, "would\r\nrather--ten thousand times rather--see Harry the friend and helper of\r\nthe poor and ignorant than the companion of men who, under the cover of\r\nnight, mask their faces and ride the country on lawless raids."\r\n\r\n"Dr. Gresham," said Robert, "we ought to be the leading nation of the\r\nearth, whose influence and example should give light to the world."\r\n\r\n"Not simply," said Iola, "a nation building up a great material\r\nprosperity, founding magnificent cities, grasping the commerce of the\r\nworld, or excelling in literature, art, and science, but a nation\r\nwearing sobriety as a crown and righteousness as the girdle of her\r\nloins."\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham gazed admiringly upon Iola. A glow of enthusiasm overspread\r\nher beautiful, expressive face. There was a rapt and far-off look in her\r\neye, as if she were looking beyond the present pain to a brighter\r\nfuture for the race with which she was identified, and felt the\r\ngrandeur of a divine commission to labor for its uplifting.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Gresham was parting with Robert, he said: "This meeting has been\r\na very unexpected pleasure. I have spent a delightful evening. I only\r\nregret that I had not others to share it with me. A doctor from the\r\nSouth, a regular Bourbon, is stopping at the hotel. I wish he could have\r\nbeen here to-night. Come down to the Concordia, Mr. Johnson, to-morrow\r\nnight. If you know any colored man who is a strong champion of equal\r\nrights, bring him along. Good-night. I shall look for you," said the\r\ndoctor, as he left the door.\r\n\r\nWhen Robert returned to the parlor he said to Iola: "Dr. Gresham has\r\ninvited me to come to his hotel to-morrow night, and to bring some\r\nwide-awake colored man with me. There is a Southerner whom he wishes me\r\nto meet. I suppose he wants to discuss the negro problem, as they call\r\nit. He wants some one who can do justice to the subject. I wonder whom I\r\ncan take with me?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you who, I think, will be a capital one to take with you,\r\nand I believe he would go," said Iola.\r\n\r\n"Who?" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n"Rev. Carmicle, your pastor."\r\n\r\n"He is just the one," said Robert, "courteous in his manner and very\r\nscholarly in his attainments. He is a man whom if everybody hated him no\r\none could despise him."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Robert and Rev. Carmicle called on Dr. Gresham, and found\r\nDr. Latrobe, the Southerner, and a young doctor by the name of Latimer,\r\nalready there. Dr. Gresham introduced Dr. Latrobe, but it was a new\r\nexperience to receive colored men socially. His wits, however, did not\r\nforsake him, and he received the introduction and survived it.\r\n\r\n"Permit me, now," said Dr. Gresham, "to introduce you to my friend, Dr.\r\nLatimer, who is attending our convention. He expects to go South and\r\nlabor among the colored people. Don\'t you think that there is a large\r\nfield of usefulness before him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Dr. Latrobe, "if he will let politics alone."\r\n\r\n"And why let politics alone?" asked Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"Because," replied Dr. Latrobe, "we Southerners will never submit to\r\nnegro supremacy. We will never abandon our Caucasian civilization to an\r\ninferior race."\r\n\r\n"Have you any reason," inquired Rev. Carmicle, "to dread that a race\r\nwhich has behind it the heathenism of Africa and the slavery of America,\r\nwith its inheritance of ignorance and poverty, will be able, in less\r\nthan one generation, to domineer over a race which has behind it ages of\r\ndominion, freedom, education, and Christianity?"\r\n\r\nA slight shade of vexation and astonishment passed over the face of Dr.\r\nLatrobe. He hesitated a moment, then replied:--\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of the negro as he stands alone, but what I dread is\r\nthat in some closely-contested election ambitious men will use him to\r\nhold the balance of power and make him an element of danger. He is\r\nignorant, poor, and clannish, and they may impact him as their policy\r\nwould direct."\r\n\r\n"Any more," asked Robert, "than the leaders of the Rebellion did the\r\nignorant, poor whites during our late conflict?"\r\n\r\n"Ignorance, poverty, and clannishness," said Dr. Gresham, "are more\r\nsocial than racial conditions, which may be outgrown."\r\n\r\n"And I think," said Rev. Carmicle, "that we are outgrowing them as fast\r\nas any other people would have done under the same conditions."\r\n\r\n"The negro," replied Dr. Latrobe, "always has been and always will be an\r\nelement of discord in our country."\r\n\r\n"What, then, is your remedy?" asked Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"I would eliminate him from the politics of the country."\r\n\r\n"As disfranchisement is a punishment for crime, is it just to punish a\r\nman before he transgresses the law?" asked Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"If," said Dr. Latimer, "the negro is ignorant, poor, and clannish, let\r\nus remember that in part of our land it was once a crime to teach him to\r\nread. If he is poor, for ages he was forced to bend to unrequited toil.\r\nIf he is clannish, society has segregated him to himself."\r\n\r\n"And even," said Robert, "has given him a negro pew in your churches\r\nand a negro seat at your communion table."\r\n\r\n"Wisely, or unwisely," said Dr. Gresham, "the Government has put the\r\nballot in his hands. It is better to teach him to use that ballot aright\r\nthan to intimidate him by violence or vitiate his vote by fraud."\r\n\r\n"To-day," said Dr. Latimer, "the negro is not plotting in beer-saloons\r\nagainst the peace and order of society. His fingers are not dripping\r\nwith dynamite, neither is he spitting upon your flag, nor flaunting the\r\nred banner of anarchy in your face."\r\n\r\n"Power," said Dr. Gresham, "naturally gravitates into the strongest\r\nhands. The class who have the best brain and most wealth can strike with\r\nthe heaviest hand. I have too much faith in the inherent power of the\r\nwhite race to dread the competition of any other people under heaven."\r\n\r\n"I think you Northerners fail to do us justice," said Dr. Latrobe. "The\r\nmen into whose hands you put the ballot were our slaves, and we would\r\nrather die than submit to them. Look at the carpet-bag governments the\r\nwicked policy of the Government inflicted upon us. It was only done to\r\nhumiliate us."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" said Dr. Gresham, flushing, and rising to his feet. "We had no\r\nother alternative than putting the ballot in their hands."\r\n\r\n"I will not deny," said Rev. Carmicle, "that we have made woeful\r\nmistakes, but with our antecedents it would have been miraculous if we\r\nhad never committed any mistakes or made any blunders."\r\n\r\n"They were allies in war," continued Dr. Gresham, "and I am sorry that\r\nwe have not done more to protect them in peace."\r\n\r\n"Protect them in peace!" said Robert, bitterly. "What protection does\r\nthe colored man receive from the hands of the Government? I know of no\r\ncivilized country outside of America where men are still burned for real\r\nor supposed crimes."\r\n\r\n"Johnson," said Dr. Gresham, compassionately, "it is impossible to have\r\na policeman at the back of each colored man\'s chair, and a squad of\r\nsoldiers at each crossroad, to detect with certainty, and punish with\r\ncelerity, each invasion of his rights. We tried provisional governments\r\nand found them a failure. It seemed like leaving our former allies to be\r\nmocked with the name of freedom and tortured with the essence of\r\nslavery. The ballot is our weapon of defense, and we gave it to them for\r\ntheirs."\r\n\r\n"And there," said Dr. Latrobe, emphatically, "is where you signally\r\nfailed. We are numerically stronger in Congress to-day than when we went\r\nout. You made the law, but the administration of it is in our hands, and\r\nwe are a unit."\r\n\r\n"But, Doctor," said Rev. Carmicle, "you cannot willfully deprive the\r\nnegro of a single right as a citizen without sending demoralization\r\nthrough your own ranks."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Dr. Latrobe, "that we are right in suppressing the\r\nnegro\'s vote. This is a white man\'s government, and a white man\'s\r\ncountry. We own nineteen-twentieths of the land, and have about the same\r\nratio of intelligence. I am a white man, and, right or wrong, I go with\r\nmy race."\r\n\r\n"But, Doctor," said Rev. Carmicle, "there are rights more sacred than\r\nthe rights of property and superior intelligence."\r\n\r\n"What are they?" asked Dr. Latrobe.\r\n\r\n"The rights of life and liberty," replied Rev. Carmicle.\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Dr. Gresham; "and your Southern civilization will\r\nbe inferior until you shall have placed protection to those rights at\r\nits base, not in theory but in fact."\r\n\r\n"But, Dr. Gresham, we have to live with these people, and the North is\r\nconstantly irritating us by its criticisms."\r\n\r\n"The world," said Dr. Gresham, "is fast becoming a vast whispering\r\ngallery, and lips once sealed can now state their own grievances and\r\nappeal to the conscience of the nation, and, as long as a sense of\r\njustice and mercy retains a hold upon the heart of our nation, you\r\ncannot practice violence and injustice without rousing a spirit of\r\nremonstrance. And if it were not so I would be ashamed of my country and\r\nof my race."\r\n\r\n"You speak," said Dr. Latrobe, "as if we had wronged the negro by\r\nenslaving him and being unwilling to share citizenship with him. I think\r\nthat slavery has been of incalculable value to the negro. It has lifted\r\nhim out of barbarism and fetich worship, given him a language of\r\ncivilization, and introduced him to the world\'s best religion. Think\r\nwhat he was in Africa and what he is in America!"\r\n\r\n"The negro," said Dr. Gresham, thoughtfully, "is not the only branch of\r\nthe human race which has been low down in the scale of civilization and\r\nfreedom, and which has outgrown the measure of his chains. Slavery,\r\npolygamy, and human sacrifices have been practiced among Europeans in\r\nby-gone days; and when Tyndall tells us that out of savages unable to\r\ncount to the number of their fingers and speaking only a language of\r\nnouns and verbs, arise at length our Newtons and Shakspeares, I do not\r\nsee that the negro could not have learned our language and received our\r\nreligion without the intervention of ages of slavery."\r\n\r\n"If," said Rev. Carmicle, "Mohammedanism, with its imperfect creed, is\r\nsuccessful in gathering large numbers of negroes beneath the Crescent,\r\ncould not a legitimate commerce and the teachings of a pure Christianity\r\nhave done as much to plant the standard of the Cross over the ramparts\r\nof sin and idolatry in Africa? Surely we cannot concede that the light\r\nof the Crescent is greater than the glory of the Cross, that there is\r\nless constraining power in the Christ of Calvary than in the Prophet of\r\nArabia? I do not think that I underrate the difficulties in your way\r\nwhen I say that you young men are holding in your hands golden\r\nopportunities which it would be madness and folly to throw away. It is\r\nyour grand opportunity to help build up a new South, not on the shifting\r\nsands of policy and expediency, but on the broad basis of equal justice\r\nand universal freedom. Do this and you will be blessed, and will make\r\nyour life a blessing."\r\n\r\nAfter Robert and Rev. Carmicle had left the hotel, Drs. Latimer,\r\nGresham, and Latrobe sat silent and thoughtful awhile, when Dr. Gresham\r\nbroke the silence by asking Dr. Latrobe how he had enjoyed the evening.\r\n\r\n"Very pleasantly," he replied. "I was quite interested in that parson.\r\nWhere was he educated?"\r\n\r\n"In Oxford, I believe. I was pleased to hear him say that he had no\r\nwhite blood in his veins."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," replied Dr. Latrobe, "from his looks. But one\r\nswallow does not make a summer. It is the exceptions which prove the\r\nrule."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think," asked Dr. Gresham, "that we have been too hasty in\r\nour judgment of the negro? He has come handicapped into life, and is now\r\non trial before the world. But it is not fair to subject him to the same\r\ntests that you would a white man. I believe that there are possibilities\r\nof growth in the race which we have never comprehended."\r\n\r\n"The negro," said Dr. Latrobe, "is perfectly comprehensible to me. The\r\nonly way to get along with him is to let him know his place, and make\r\nhim keep it."\r\n\r\n"I think," replied Dr. Gresham, "every man\'s place is the one he is best\r\nfitted for."\r\n\r\n"Why," asked Dr. Latimer, "should any place be assigned to the negro\r\nmore than to the French, Irish, or German?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," replied Dr. Latrobe, "they are all Caucasians."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dr. Gresham, "is all excellence summed up in that branch of\r\nthe human race?"\r\n\r\n"I think," said Dr. Latrobe, proudly, "that we belong to the highest\r\nrace on earth and the negro to the lowest."\r\n\r\n"And yet," said Dr. Latimer, "you have consorted with them till you have\r\nbleached their faces to the whiteness of your own. Your children nestle\r\nin their bosoms; they are around you as body servants, and yet if one of\r\nthem should attempt to associate with you your bitterest scorn and\r\nindignation would be visited upon them."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Dr. Latrobe, "that feeling grows out of our Anglo-Saxon\r\nregard for the marriage relation. These white negroes are of\r\nillegitimate origin, and we would scorn to share our social life with\r\nthem. Their blood is tainted."\r\n\r\n"Who tainted it?" asked Dr. Latimer, bitterly. "You give absolution to\r\nthe fathers, and visit the misfortunes of the mothers upon the\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\n"But, Doctor, what kind of society would we have if we put down the bars\r\nand admitted everybody to social equality?"\r\n\r\n"This idea of social equality," said Dr. Latimer, "is only a bugbear\r\nwhich frightens well-meaning people from dealing justly with the negro.\r\nI know of no place on earth where there is perfect social equality, and\r\nI doubt if there is such a thing in heaven. The sinner who repents on\r\nhis death-bed cannot be the equal of St. Paul or the Beloved Disciple."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Dr. Gresham, "I sometimes think that the final solution\r\nof this question will be the absorption of the negro into our race."\r\n\r\n"Never! never!" exclaimed Dr. Latrobe, vehemently. "It would be a death\r\nblow to American civilization."\r\n\r\n"Why, Doctor," said Dr. Latimer, "you Southerners began this absorption\r\nbefore the war. I understand that in one decade the mixed bloods rose\r\nfrom one-ninth to one-eighth of the population, and that as early as\r\n1663 a law was passed in Maryland to prevent English women from\r\nintermarrying with slaves; and, even now, your laws against\r\nmiscegenation presuppose that you apprehend danger from that source."\r\n\r\n"Doctor, it is no use talking," replied Dr. Latrobe, wearily. "There\r\nare niggers who are as white as I am, but the taint of blood is there\r\nand we always exclude it."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it is there?" asked Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are tricks of blood which always betray them. My eyes are\r\nmore practiced than yours. I can always tell them. Now, that Johnson is\r\nas white as any man; but I knew he was a nigger the moment I saw him. I\r\nsaw it in his eye."\r\n\r\nDr. Latimer smiled at Dr. Latrobe\'s assertion, but did not attempt to\r\nrefute it; and bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Dr. Latrobe, "that our war was the great mistake of the\r\nnineteenth century. It has left us very serious complications. We cannot\r\namalgamate with the negroes. We cannot expatriate them. Now, what are we\r\nto do with them?"\r\n\r\n"Deal justly with them," said Dr. Gresham, "and let them alone. Try to\r\ncreate a moral sentiment in the nation, which will consider a wrong done\r\nto the weakest of them as a wrong done to the whole community. Whenever\r\nyou find ministers too righteous to be faithless, cowardly, and time\r\nserving; women too Christly to be scornful; and public men too noble to\r\nbe tricky and too honest to pander to the prejudices of the people,\r\nstand by them and give them your moral support."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Latrobe, "with your views you ought to be a preacher\r\nstriving to usher in the millennium."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t come too soon," replied Dr. Gresham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVERGING PATHS.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of his departure from the city of P----, Dr. Gresham called\r\non Iola, and found her alone. They talked awhile of reminiscences of the\r\nwar and hospital life, when Dr. Gresham, approaching Iola, said:--\r\n\r\n"Miss Leroy, I am glad the great object of your life is accomplished,\r\nand that you have found all your relatives. Years have passed since we\r\nparted, years in which I have vainly tried to get a trace of you and\r\nhave been baffled, but I have found you at last!" Clasping her hand in\r\nhis, he continued, "I would it were so that I should never lose you\r\nagain! Iola, will you not grant me the privilege of holding this hand as\r\nmine all through the future of our lives? Your search for your mother is\r\nended. She is well cared for. Are you not free at last to share with me\r\nmy Northern home, free to be mine as nothing else on earth is mine." Dr.\r\nGresham looked eagerly on Iola\'s face, and tried to read its varying\r\nexpression. "Iola, I learned to love you in the hospital. I have tried\r\nto forget you, but it has been all in vain. Your image is just as deeply\r\nengraven on my heart as it was the day we parted."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," she replied, sadly, but firmly, as she withdrew her hand from\r\nhis, "I feel now as I felt then, that there is an insurmountable barrier\r\nbetween us."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Iola?" asked Dr. Gresham, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"It is the public opinion which assigns me a place with the colored\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"But what right has public opinion to interfere with our marriage\r\nrelations? Why should we yield to its behests?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is stronger than we are, and we cannot run counter to it\r\nwithout suffering its penalties."\r\n\r\n"And what are they, Iola? Shadows that you merely dread?"\r\n\r\n"No! no! the penalties of social ostracism North and South, except here\r\nand there some grand and noble exceptions. I do not think that you fully\r\nrealize how much prejudice against colored people permeates society,\r\nlowers the tone of our religion, and reacts upon the life of the nation.\r\nAfter freedom came, mamma was living in the city of A----, and wanted to\r\nunite with a Christian church there. She made application for\r\nmembership. She passed her examination as a candidate, and was received\r\nas a church member. When she was about to make her first communion, she\r\nunintentionally took her seat at the head of the column. The elder who\r\nwas administering the communion gave her the bread in the order in which\r\nshe sat, but before he gave her the wine some one touched him on the\r\nshoulder and whispered a word in his ear. He then passed mamma by, gave\r\nthe cup to others, and then returned to her. From that rite connected\r\nwith the holiest memories of earth, my poor mother returned humiliated\r\nand depressed."\r\n\r\n"What a shame!" exclaimed Dr. Gresham, indignantly.\r\n\r\n"I have seen," continued Iola, "the same spirit manifested in the North.\r\nMamma once attempted to do missionary work in this city. One day she\r\nfound an outcast colored girl, whom she wished to rescue. She took her\r\nto an asylum for fallen women and made an application for her, but was\r\nrefused. Colored girls were not received there. Soon after mamma found\r\namong the colored people an outcast white girl. Mamma\'s sympathies,\r\nunfettered by class distinction, were aroused in her behalf, and, in\r\ncompany with two white ladies, she went with the girl to that same\r\nrefuge. For her the door was freely opened and admittance readily\r\ngranted. It was as if two women were sinking in the quicksands, and on\r\nthe solid land stood other women with life-lines in their hands, seeing\r\nthe deadly sands slowly creeping up around the hapless victims. To one\r\nthey readily threw the lines of deliverance, but for the other there was\r\nnot one strand of salvation. Sometime since, to the same asylum, came a\r\npoor fallen girl who had escaped from the clutches of a wicked woman.\r\nFor her the door would have been opened, had not the vile woman from\r\nwhom she was escaping followed her to that place of refuge and revealed\r\nthe fact that she belonged to the colored race. That fact was enough to\r\nclose the door upon her, and to send her back to sin and to suffer, and\r\nperhaps to die as a wretched outcast. And yet in this city where a\r\nnumber of charities are advertised, I do not think there is one of them\r\nwhich, in appealing to the public, talks more religion than the managers\r\nof this asylum. This prejudice against the colored race environs our\r\nlives and mocks our aspirations."\r\n\r\n"Iola, I see no use in your persisting that you are colored when your\r\neyes are as blue and complexion as white as mine."\r\n\r\n"Doctor, were I your wife, are there not people who would caress me as\r\na white woman who would shrink from me in scorn if they knew I had one\r\ndrop of negro blood in my veins? When mistaken for a white woman, I\r\nshould hear things alleged against the race at which my blood would\r\nboil. No, Doctor, I am not willing to live under a shadow of concealment\r\nwhich I thoroughly hate as if the blood in my veins were an undetected\r\ncrime of my soul."\r\n\r\n"Iola, dear, surely you paint the picture too darkly."\r\n\r\n"Doctor, I have painted it with my heart\'s blood. It is easier to\r\noutgrow the dishonor of crime than the disabilities of color. You have\r\ncreated in this country an aristocracy of color wide enough to include\r\nthe South with its treason and Utah with its abominations, but too\r\nnarrow to include the best and bravest colored man who bared his breast\r\nto the bullets of the enemy during your fratricidal strife. Is not the\r\nmost arrant Rebel to-day more acceptable to you than the most faithful\r\ncolored man?"\r\n\r\n"No! no!" exclaimed Dr. Gresham, vehemently. "You are wrong. I belong to\r\nthe Grand Army of the Republic. We have no separate State Posts for the\r\ncolored people, and, were such a thing proposed, the majority of our\r\nmembers, I believe, would be against it. In Congress colored men have\r\nthe same seats as white men, and the color line is slowly fading out in\r\nour public institutions."\r\n\r\n"But how is it in the Church?" asked Iola.\r\n\r\n"The Church is naturally conservative. It preserves old truths, even if\r\nit is somewhat slow in embracing new ideas. It has its social as well as\r\nits spiritual side. Society is woman\'s realm. The majority of church\r\nmembers are women, who are said to be the aristocratic element of our\r\ncountry. I fear that one of the last strongholds of this racial\r\nprejudice will be found beneath the shadow of some of our churches. I\r\nthink, on account of this social question, that large bodies of\r\nChristian temperance women and other reformers, in trying to reach the\r\ncolored people even for their own good, will be quicker to form\r\nseparate associations than our National Grand Army, whose ranks are open\r\nto black and white, liberals and conservatives, saints and agnostics.\r\nBut, Iola, we have drifted far away from the question. No one has a\r\nright to interfere with our marriage if we do not infringe on the rights\r\nof others."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," she replied, gently, "I feel that our paths must diverge. My\r\nlife-work is planned. I intend spending my future among the colored\r\npeople of the South."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," he replied, anxiously, "I am afraid that you are\r\ndestined to sad disappointment. When the novelty wears off you will be\r\ndisillusioned, and, I fear, when the time comes that you can no longer\r\nserve them they will forget your services and remember only your\r\nfailings."\r\n\r\n"But, Doctor, they need me; and I am sure when I taught among them they\r\nwere very grateful for my services."\r\n\r\n"I think," he replied, "these people are more thankful than grateful."\r\n\r\n"I do not think so; and if I did it would not hinder me from doing all\r\nin my power to help them. I do not expect all the finest traits of\r\ncharacter to spring from the hot-beds of slavery and caste. What matters\r\nit if they do forget the singer, so they don\'t forget the song? No,\r\nDoctor, I don\'t think that I could best serve my race by forsaking them\r\nand marrying you."\r\n\r\n"Iola," he exclaimed, passionately, "if you love your race, as you call\r\nit, work for it, live for it, suffer for it, and, if need be, die for\r\nit; but don\'t marry for it. Your education has unfitted you for social\r\nlife among them."\r\n\r\n"It was," replied Iola, "through their unrequited toil that I was\r\neducated, while they were compelled to live in ignorance. I am indebted\r\nto them for the power I have to serve them. I wish other Southern women\r\nfelt as I do. I think they could do so much to help the colored people\r\nat their doors if they would look at their opportunities in the light of\r\nthe face of Jesus Christ. Nor am I wholly unselfish in allying myself\r\nwith the colored people. All the rest of my family have done so. My dear\r\ngrandmother is one of the excellent of the earth, and we all love her\r\ntoo much to ignore our relationship with her. I did not choose my lot in\r\nlife, and the simplest thing I can do is to accept the situation and do\r\nthe best I can."\r\n\r\n"And is this your settled purpose?" he asked, sadly.\r\n\r\n"It is, Doctor," she replied, tenderly but firmly. "I see no other. I\r\nmust serve the race which needs me most."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps you are right," he replied; "but I cannot help feeling sad that\r\nour paths, which met so pleasantly, should diverge so painfully. And\r\nyet, not only the freedmen, but the whole country, need such helpful,\r\nself-sacrificing teachers as you will prove; and if earnest prayers and\r\nholy wishes can brighten your path, your lines will fall in the\r\npleasantest places."\r\n\r\nAs he rose to go, sympathy, love, and admiration were blended in the\r\nparting look he gave her; but he felt it was useless to attempt to\r\ndivert her from her purpose. He knew that for the true reconstruction of\r\nthe country something more was needed than bayonets and bullets, or the\r\nschemes of selfish politicians or plotting demagogues. He knew that the\r\nSouth needed the surrender of the best brain and heart of the country to\r\nbuild, above the wastes of war, more stately temples of thought and\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. LATROBE\'S MISTAKE.\r\n\r\nOn the morning previous to their departure for their respective homes,\r\nDr. Gresham met Dr. Latrobe in the parlor of the Concordia.\r\n\r\n"How," asked Dr. Gresham, "did you like Dr. Latimer\'s paper?"\r\n\r\n"Very much, indeed. It was excellent. He is a very talented young man.\r\nHe sits next to me at lunch and I have conversed with him several times.\r\nHe is very genial and attractive, only he seems to be rather cranky on\r\nthe negro question. I hope if he comes South that he will not make the\r\nmistake of mixing up with the negroes. It would be throwing away his\r\ninfluence and ruining his prospects. He seems to be well versed in\r\nscience and literature and would make a very delightful accession to our\r\nsocial life."\r\n\r\n"I think," replied Dr. Gresham, "that he is an honor to our profession.\r\nHe is one of the finest specimens of our young manhood."\r\n\r\nJust then Dr. Latimer entered the room. Dr. Latrobe arose and, greeting\r\nhim cordially, said: "I was delighted with your paper; it was full of\r\nthought and suggestion."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," answered Dr. Latimer, "it was my aim to make it so."\r\n\r\n"And you succeeded admirably," replied Dr. Latrobe. "I could not help\r\nthinking how much we owe to heredity and environment."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Dr. Gresham. "Continental Europe yearly sends to our shores\r\nsubjects to be developed into citizens. Emancipation has given us\r\nmillions of new citizens, and to them our influence and example should\r\nbe a blessing and not a curse."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Dr. Latimer, "I intend to go South, and help those who so\r\nmuch need helpers from their own ranks."\r\n\r\n"I hope," answered Dr. Latrobe, "that if you go South you will only\r\nsustain business relations with the negroes, and not commit the folly of\r\nequalizing yourself with them."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" asked Dr. Latimer, steadily looking him in the eye.\r\n\r\n"Because in equalizing yourself with them you drag us down; and our\r\nsocial customs must be kept intact."\r\n\r\n"You have been associating with me at the convention for several days; I\r\ndo not see that the contact has dragged you down, has it?"\r\n\r\n"You! What has that got to do with associating with niggers?" asked Dr.\r\nLatrobe, curtly.\r\n\r\n"The blood of that race is coursing through my veins. I am one of them,"\r\nreplied Dr. Latimer, proudly raising his head.\r\n\r\n"You!" exclaimed Dr. Latrobe, with an air of profound astonishment and\r\ncrimsoning face.\r\n\r\n"Yes;" interposed Dr. Gresham, laughing heartily at Dr. Latrobe\'s\r\ndiscomfiture. "He belongs to that negro race both by blood and choice.\r\nHis father\'s mother made overtures to receive him as her grandson and\r\nheir, but he has nobly refused to forsake his mother\'s people and has\r\ncast his lot with them."\r\n\r\n"And I," said Dr. Latimer, "would have despised myself if I had done\r\notherwise."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Dr. Latrobe, rising, "I was never so deceived before.\r\nGood morning!"\r\n\r\nDr. Latrobe had thought he was clear-sighted enough to detect the\r\npresence of negro blood when all physical traces had disappeared. But he\r\nhad associated with Dr. Latimer for several days, and admired his\r\ntalent, without suspecting for one moment his racial connection. He\r\ncould not help feeling a sense of vexation at the signal mistake he had\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nDr. Frank Latimer was the natural grandson of a Southern lady, in whose\r\nfamily his mother had been a slave. The blood of a proud aristocratic\r\nancestry was flowing through his veins, and generations of blood\r\nadmixture had effaced all trace of his negro lineage. His complexion was\r\nblonde, his eye bright and piercing, his lips firm and well moulded; his\r\nmanner very affable; his intellect active and well stored with\r\ninformation. He was a man capable of winning in life through his rich\r\ngifts of inheritance and acquirements. When freedom came, his mother,\r\nlike Hagar of old, went out into the wide world to seek a living for\r\nherself and child. Through years of poverty she labored to educate her\r\nchild, and saw the glad fruition of her hopes when her son graduated as\r\nan M.D. from the University of P----.\r\n\r\nAfter his graduation he met his father\'s mother, who recognized him by\r\nhis resemblance to her dear, departed son. All the mother love in her\r\nlonely heart awoke, and she was willing to overlook "the missing link of\r\nmatrimony," and adopt him as her heir, if he would ignore his identity\r\nwith the colored race.\r\n\r\nBefore him loomed all the possibilities which only birth and blood can\r\ngive a white man in our Democratic country. But he was a man of too much\r\nsterling worth of character to be willing to forsake his mother\'s race\r\nfor the richest advantages his grandmother could bestow.\r\n\r\nDr. Gresham had met Dr. Latimer at the beginning of the convention, and\r\nhad been attracted to him by his frank and genial manner. One morning,\r\nwhen conversing with him, Dr. Gresham had learned some of the salient\r\npoints of his history, which, instead of repelling him, had only\r\ndeepened his admiration for the young doctor. He was much amused when he\r\nsaw the pleasant acquaintanceship between him and Dr. Latrobe, but they\r\nagreed to be silent about his racial connection until the time came when\r\nthey were ready to divulge it; and they were hugely delighted at his\r\nsignal blunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITORS FROM THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n"Mamma is not well," said Iola to Robert. "I spoke to her about sending\r\nfor a doctor, but she objected and I did not insist."\r\n\r\n"I will ask Dr. Latimer, whom I met at the Concordia, to step in. He is\r\na splendid young fellow. I wish we had thousands like him."\r\n\r\nIn the evening the doctor called. Without appearing to make a\r\nprofessional visit he engaged Marie in conversation, watched her\r\ncarefully, and came to the conclusion that her failing health proceeded\r\nmore from mental than physical causes.\r\n\r\n"I am so uneasy about Harry," said Mrs. Leroy. "He is so fearless and\r\noutspoken. I do wish the attention of the whole nation could be turned\r\nto the cruel barbarisms which are a national disgrace. I think the term\r\n\'bloody shirt\' is one of the most heartless phrases ever invented to\r\ndivert attention from cruel wrongs and dreadful outrages."\r\n\r\nJust then Iola came in and was introduced by her uncle to Dr. Latimer,\r\nto whom the introduction was a sudden and unexpected pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter an interchange of courtesies, Marie resumed the conversation,\r\nsaying: "Harry wrote me only last week that a young friend of his had\r\nlost his situation because he refused to have his pupils strew flowers\r\non the streets through which Jefferson Davis was to pass."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Dr. Latimer, indignantly, "that the Israelites had just\r\nas much right to scatter flowers over the bodies of the Egyptians, when\r\nthe waves threw back their corpses on the shores of the Red Sea, as\r\nthese children had to strew the path of Jefferson Davis with flowers. We\r\nwant our boys to grow up manly citizens, and not cringing sycophants.\r\nWhen do you expect your son, Mrs. Leroy?"\r\n\r\n"Some time next week," answered Marie.\r\n\r\n"And his presence will do you more good than all the medicine in my\r\nchest."\r\n\r\n"I hope, Doctor," said Mrs. Leroy, "that we will not lose sight of you,\r\nnow that your professional visit is ended; for I believe your visit was\r\nthe result of a conspiracy between Iola and her uncle."\r\n\r\nDr. Latimer laughed, as he answered, "Ah, Mrs. Leroy, I see you have\r\nfound us all out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Doctor," exclaimed Iola, with pleasing excitement, "there is a\r\nyoung lady coming here to visit me next week. Her name is Miss Lucille\r\nDelany, and she is my ideal woman. She is grand, brave, intellectual,\r\nand religious."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? She would make some man an excellent wife," replied Dr.\r\nLatimer.\r\n\r\n"Now isn\'t that perfectly manlike," answered Iola, smiling. "Mamma, what\r\ndo you think of that? Did any of you gentlemen ever see a young woman of\r\nmuch ability that you did not look upon as a flotsam all adrift until\r\nsome man had appropriated her?"\r\n\r\n"I think, Miss Leroy, that the world\'s work, if shared, is better done\r\nthan when it is performed alone. Don\'t you think your life-work will be\r\nbetter done if some one shares it with you?" asked Dr. Latimer, slowly,\r\nand with a smile in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"That would depend on the person who shared it," said Iola, faintly\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Robert, a few evenings after this conversation, as he\r\nhanded Iola a couple of letters, "is something which will please you."\r\n\r\nIola took the letters, and, after reading one of them, said: "Miss\r\nDelany and Harry will be here on Wednesday; and this one is an\r\ninvitation which also adds to my enjoyment."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Marie; "an invitation to a hop or a german?"\r\n\r\n"No; but something which I value far more. We are all invited to Mr.\r\nStillman\'s to a _conversazione_."\r\n\r\n"What is the object?"\r\n\r\n"His object is to gather some of the thinkers and leaders of the race to\r\nconsult on subjects of vital interest to our welfare. He has invited Dr.\r\nLatimer, Professor Gradnor, of North Carolina, Mr. Forest, of New York,\r\nHon. Dugdale, Revs. Carmicle, Cantnor, Tunster, Professor Langhorne, of\r\nGeorgia, and a few ladies, Mrs. Watson, Miss Brown, and others."\r\n\r\n"I am glad that it is neither a hop nor a german," said Iola, "but\r\nsomething for which I have been longing."\r\n\r\n"Why, Iola," asked Robert, "don\'t you believe in young people having a\r\ngood time?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," answered Iola, seriously, "I believe in young people having\r\namusements and recreations; but the times are too serious for us to\r\nattempt to make our lives a long holiday."\r\n\r\n"Well, Iola," answered Robert, "this is the first holiday we have had\r\nin two hundred and fifty years, and you shouldn\'t be too exacting."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Marie, "human beings naturally crave enjoyment, and if\r\nnot furnished with good amusements they are apt to gravitate to low\r\npleasures."\r\n\r\n"Some one," said Robert, "has said that the Indian belongs to an old\r\nrace and looks gloomily back to the past, and that the negro belongs to\r\na young race and looks hopefully towards the future."\r\n\r\n"If that be so," replied Marie, "our race-life corresponds more to the\r\nfollies of youth than the faults of maturer years."\r\n\r\nOn Dr. Latimer\'s next visit he was much pleased to see a great change in\r\nMarie\'s appearance. Her eye had grown brighter, her step more elastic,\r\nand the anxiety had faded from her face. Harry had arrived, and with him\r\ncame Miss Delany.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, Dr. Latimer," said Iola, cheerily, as she entered the\r\nroom with Miss Lucille Delany. "This is my friend, Miss Delany, from\r\nGeorgia. Were she not present I would say she is one of the grandest\r\nwomen in America."\r\n\r\n"I am very much pleased to meet you," said Dr. Latimer, cordially; "I\r\nhave heard Miss Leroy speak of you. We were expecting you," he added,\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nJust then Harry entered the room, and Iola presented him to Dr. Latimer,\r\nsaying, "This is my brother, about whom mamma was so anxious."\r\n\r\n"Had you a pleasant journey?" asked Dr. Latimer, after the first\r\ngreetings were over.\r\n\r\n"Not especially," answered Miss Delany. "Southern roads are not always\r\nvery pleasant to travel. When Mr. Leroy entered the cars at A----, where\r\nhe was known, had he taken his seat among the white people he would have\r\nbeen remanded to the colored."\r\n\r\n"But after awhile," said Harry, "as Miss Delany and myself were sitting\r\ntogether, laughing and chatting, a colored man entered the car, and,\r\nmistaking me for a white man, asked the conductor to have me removed,\r\nand I had to insist that I was colored in order to be permitted to\r\nremain. It would be ludicrous, if it were not vexatious, to be too white\r\nto be black, and too black to be white."\r\n\r\n"Caste plays such fantastic tricks in this country," said Dr. Latimer.\r\n\r\n"I tell Mr. Leroy," said Miss Delany, "that when he returns he must put\r\na label on himself, saying, \'I am a colored man,\' to prevent annoyance."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS IN COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nOn the following Friday evening, Mr. Stillman\'s pleasant, spacious\r\nparlors were filled to overflowing with a select company of earnest men\r\nand women deeply interested in the welfare of the race.\r\n\r\nBishop Tunster had prepared a paper on "Negro Emigration." Dr. Latimer\r\nopened the discussion by speaking favorably of some of the salient\r\npoints, but said:--\r\n\r\n"I do not believe self-exilement is the true remedy for the wrongs of\r\nthe negro. Where should he go if he left this country?"\r\n\r\n"Go to Africa," replied Bishop Tunster, in his bluff, hearty tones. "I\r\nbelieve that Africa is to be redeemed to civilization, and that the\r\nnegro is to be gathered into the family of nations and recognized as a\r\nman and a brother."\r\n\r\n"Go to Africa?" repeated Professor Langhorne, of Georgia. "Does the\r\nUnited States own one foot of African soil? And have we not been\r\ninvesting our blood in the country for ages?"\r\n\r\n"I am in favor of missionary efforts," said Professor Gradnor, of North\r\nCarolina, "for the redemption of Africa, but I see no reason for\r\nexpatriating ourselves because some persons do not admire the color of\r\nour skins."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe," said Mr. Stillman, "in emptying on the shores of\r\nAfrica a horde of ignorant, poverty-stricken people, as missionaries of\r\ncivilization or Christianity. And while I am in favor of missionary\r\nefforts, there is need here for the best heart and brain to work in\r\nunison for justice and righteousness."\r\n\r\n"America," said Miss Delany, "is the best field for human development.\r\nGod has not heaped up our mountains with such grandeur, flooded our\r\nrivers with such majesty, crowned our valleys with such fertility,\r\nenriched our mines with such wealth, that they should only minister to\r\ngrasping greed and sensuous enjoyment."\r\n\r\n"Climate, soil, and physical environments," said Professor Gradnor,\r\n"have much to do with shaping national characteristics. If in Africa,\r\nunder a tropical sun, the negro has lagged behind other races in the\r\nmarch of civilization, at least for once in his history he has, in this\r\ncountry, the privilege of using climatic advantages and developing under\r\nnew conditions."\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Dr. Latimer, "and I do not wish our people to become\r\nrestless and unsettled before they have tried one generation of\r\nfreedom."\r\n\r\n"I am always glad," said Mr. Forest, a tall, distinguished-looking\r\ngentleman from New York, "when I hear of people who are ill treated in\r\none section of the country emigrating to another. Men who are deaf to\r\nthe claims of mercy, and oblivious to the demands of justice, can feel\r\nwhen money is slipping from their pockets."\r\n\r\n"The negro," said Hon. Dugdale, "does not present to my mind the picture\r\nof an effete and exhausted people, destined to die out before a stronger\r\nrace. Gilbert Haven once saw a statue which suggested this thought, \'I\r\nam black, but comely; the sun has looked down upon me, but I will teach\r\nyou who despise me to feel that I am your superior.\' The men who are\r\nacquiring property and building up homes in the South show us what\r\nenergy and determination may do even in that part of the country. I\r\nbelieve such men can do more to conquer prejudice than if they spent all\r\ntheir lives in shouting for their rights and ignoring their duties. No!\r\nas there are millions of us in this country, I think it best to settle\r\ndown and work out our own salvation here."\r\n\r\n"How many of us to-day," asked Professor Langhorne, "would be teaching\r\nin the South, if every field of labor in the North was as accessible to\r\nus as to the whites? It has been estimated that a million young white\r\nmen have left the South since the war, and, had our chances been equal\r\nto theirs, would we have been any more willing to stay in the South with\r\nthose who need us than they? But this prejudice, by impacting us\r\ntogether, gives us a common cause and brings our intellect in contact\r\nwith the less favored of our race."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe," said Miss Delany, "that the Southern white people\r\nthemselves desire any wholesale exodus of the colored from their labor\r\nfields. It would be suicidal to attempt their expatriation."\r\n\r\n"History," said Professor Langhorne, "tells that Spain was once the\r\nplace where barbarian Europe came to light her lamp. Seven hundred years\r\nbefore there was a public lamp in London you might have gone through the\r\nstreets of Cordova amid ten miles of lighted lamps, and stood there on\r\nsolidly paved land, when hundreds of years afterwards, in Paris, on a\r\nrainy day you would have sunk to your ankles in the mud. But she who\r\nbore the name of the \'Terror of Nations,\' and the \'Queen of the Ocean,\'\r\nwas not strong enough to dash herself against God\'s law of retribution\r\nand escape unscathed. She inaugurated a crusade of horror against a\r\nmillion of her best laborers and artisans. Vainly she expected the\r\nblessing of God to crown her work of violence. Instead of seeing the\r\nfruition of her hopes in the increased prosperity of her land,\r\ndepression and paralysis settled on her trade and business. A fearful\r\nblow was struck at her agriculture; decay settled on her manufactories;\r\nmoney became too scarce to pay the necessary expenses of the king\'s\r\nexchequer; and that once mighty empire became a fallen kingdom, pierced\r\nby her crimes and dragged down by her transgressions."\r\n\r\n"We did not," said Iola, "place the bounds of our habitation. And I\r\nbelieve we are to be fixtures in this country. But beyond the shadows I\r\nsee the coruscation of a brighter day; and we can help usher it in, not\r\nby answering hate with hate, or giving scorn for scorn, but by striving\r\nto be more generous, noble, and just. It seems as if all creation\r\ntravels to respond to the song of the Herald angels, \'Peace on earth,\r\ngood-will toward men.\'"\r\n\r\nThe next paper was on "Patriotism," by Rev. Cantnor. It was a paper in\r\nwhich the white man was extolled as the master race, and spoke as if it\r\nwere a privilege for the colored man to be linked to his destiny and to\r\nlive beneath the shadow of his power. He asserted that the white race of\r\nthis country is the broadest, most Christian, and humane of that branch\r\nof the human family.\r\n\r\nDr. Latimer took exception to his position. "Law," he said, "is the\r\npivot on which the whole universe turns; and obedience to law is the\r\ngauge by which a nation\'s strength or weakness is tried. We have had two\r\nevils by which our obedience to law has been tested--slavery and the\r\nliquor traffic. How have we dealt with them both? We have been weighed\r\nin the balance and found wanting. Millions of slaves and serfs have been\r\nliberated during this century, but not even in semi-barbaric Russia,\r\nheathen Japan, or Catholic Spain has slavery been abolished through such\r\na fearful conflict as it was in the United States. The liquor traffic\r\nstill sends its floods of ruin and shame to the habitations of men, and\r\nno political party has been found with enough moral power and numerical\r\nstrength to stay the tide of death."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Professor Gradnor, "that what our country needs is truth\r\nmore than flattery. I do not think that our moral life keeps pace with\r\nour mental development and material progress. I know of no civilized\r\ncountry on the globe, Catholic, Protestant, or Mohammedan, where life is\r\nless secure than it is in the South. Nearly eighteen hundred years ago\r\nthe life of a Roman citizen in Palestine was in danger from mob\r\nviolence. That pagan government threw around him a wall of living clay,\r\nconsisting of four hundred and seventy men, when more than forty Jews\r\nhad bound themselves with an oath that they would neither eat nor drink\r\nuntil they had taken the life of the Apostle Paul. Does not true\r\npatriotism demand that citizenship should be as much protected in\r\nChristian America as it was in heathen Rome?"\r\n\r\n"I would have our people," said Miss Delany, "more interested in\r\npolitics. Instead of forgetting the past, I would have them hold in\r\neverlasting remembrance our great deliverance. Hitherto we have never\r\nhad a country with tender, precious memories to fill our eyes with\r\ntears, or glad reminiscences to thrill our hearts with pride and joy. We\r\nhave been aliens and outcasts in the land of our birth. But I want my\r\npupils to do all in their power to make this country worthy of their\r\ndeepest devotion and loftiest patriotism. I want them to feel that its\r\nglory is their glory, its dishonor their shame."\r\n\r\n"Our esteemed friend, Mrs. Watson," said Iola, "sends regrets that she\r\ncannot come, but has kindly favored us with a poem, called the "Rallying\r\nCry." In her letter she says that, although she is no longer young, she\r\nfeels that in the conflict for the right there\'s room for young as well\r\nas old. She hopes that we will here unite the enthusiasm of youth with\r\nthe experience of age, and that we will have a pleasant and profitable\r\nconference. Is it your pleasure that the poem be read at this stage of\r\nour proceedings, or later on?"\r\n\r\n"Let us have it now," answered Harry, "and I move that Miss Delany be\r\nchosen to lend to the poem the charm of her voice."\r\n\r\n"I second the motion," said Iola, smiling, and handing the poem to Miss\r\nDelany.\r\n\r\nMiss Delany took the poem and read it with fine effect. The spirit of\r\nthe poem had entered her soul.\r\n\r\n              A RALLYING CRY.\r\n\r\n    Oh, children of the tropics,\r\n           Amid our pain and wrong\r\n    Have you no other mission\r\n           Than music, dance, and song?\r\n\r\n    When through the weary ages\r\n           Our dripping tears still fall,\r\n    Is this a time to dally\r\n           With pleasure\'s silken thrall?\r\n\r\n    Go, muffle all your viols;\r\n           As heroes learn to stand,\r\n    With faith in God\'s great justice\r\n           Nerve every heart and hand.\r\n\r\n    Dream not of ease nor pleasure,\r\n           Nor honor, wealth, nor fame,\r\n    Till from the dust you\'ve lifted\r\n           Our long-dishonored name;\r\n\r\n    And crowned that name with glory\r\n           By deeds of holy worth,\r\n    To shine with light emblazoned,\r\n           The noblest name on earth.\r\n\r\n    Count life a dismal failure,\r\n           Unblessing and unblest,\r\n    That seeks \'mid ease inglorious\r\n           For pleasure or for rest.\r\n\r\n    With courage, strength, and valor\r\n           Your lives and actions brace;\r\n    Shrink not from toil or hardship,\r\n           And dangers bravely face.\r\n\r\n    Engrave upon your banners,\r\n           In words of golden light,\r\n    That honor, truth, and justice\r\n           Are more than godless might.\r\n\r\n    Above earth\'s pain and sorrow\r\n           Christ\'s dying face I see;\r\n    I hear the cry of anguish:--\r\n           "Why hast thou forsaken me?"\r\n\r\n    In the pallor of that anguish\r\n           I see the only light,\r\n    To flood with peace and gladness\r\n           Earth\'s sorrow, pain, and night.\r\n\r\n    Arrayed in Christly armor\r\n           \'Gainst error, crime, and sin,\r\n    The victory can\'t be doubtful,\r\n           For God is sure to win.\r\n\r\nThe next paper was by Miss Iola Leroy, on the "Education of Mothers."\r\n\r\n"I agree," said Rev. Eustace, of St. Mary\'s parish, "with the paper. The\r\ngreat need of the race is enlightened mothers."\r\n\r\n"And enlightened fathers, too," added Miss Delany, quickly. "If there is\r\nanything I chafe to see it is a strong, hearty man shirking his burdens,\r\nputting them on the shoulders of his wife, and taking life easy for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"I always pity such mothers," interposed Iola, tenderly.\r\n\r\n"I think," said Miss Delany, with a flash in her eye and a ring of\r\ndecision in her voice, "that such men ought to be drummed out of town!"\r\nAs she spoke, there was an expression which seemed to say, "And I would\r\nlike to help do it!"\r\n\r\nHarry smiled, and gave her a quick glance of admiration.\r\n\r\n"I do not think," said Mrs. Stillman, "that we can begin too early to\r\nteach our boys to be manly and self-respecting, and our girls to be\r\nuseful and self-reliant."\r\n\r\n"You know," said Mrs. Leroy, "that after the war we were thrown upon the\r\nnation a homeless race to be gathered into homes, and a legally\r\nunmarried race to be taught the sacredness of the marriage relation. We\r\nmust instill into our young people that the true strength of a race\r\nmeans purity in women and uprightness in men; who can say, with Sir\r\nGalahad:--\r\n\r\n    \'My strength is the strength of ten,\r\n       Because my heart is pure.\'\r\n\r\nAnd where this is wanting neither wealth nor culture can make up the\r\ndeficiency."\r\n\r\n"There is a field of Christian endeavor which lies between the\r\nschool-house and the pulpit, which needs the hand of a woman more in\r\nprivate than in public," said Miss Delany.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have often felt the need of such work in my own parish. We need\r\na union of women with the warmest hearts and clearest brains to help in\r\nthe moral education of the race," said Rev. Eustace.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Iola, "if we would have the prisons empty we must make the\r\nhomes more attractive."\r\n\r\n"In civilized society," replied Dr. Latimer, "there must be restraint\r\neither within or without. If parents fail to teach restraint within,\r\nsociety has her check-reins without in the form of chain-gangs, prisons,\r\nand the gallows."\r\n\r\nThe closing paper was on the "Moral Progress of the Race," by Hon.\r\nDugdale. He said: "The moral progress of the race was not all he could\r\ndesire, yet he could not help feeling that, compared with other races,\r\nthe outlook was not hopeless. I am so sorry to see, however, that in\r\nsome States there is an undue proportion of colored people in prisons."\r\n\r\n"I think," answered Professor Langhorne, of Georgia, "that this is\r\nowing to a partial administration of law in meting out punishment to\r\ncolored offenders. I know red-handed murderers who walk in this Republic\r\nunwhipped of justice, and I have seen a colored woman sentenced to\r\nprison for weeks for stealing twenty-five cents. I knew a colored girl\r\nwho was executed for murder when only a child in years. And it was\r\nthrough the intervention of a friend of mine, one of the bravest young\r\nmen of the South, that a boy of fifteen was saved from the gallows."\r\n\r\n"When I look," said Mr. Forest, "at the slow growth of modern\r\ncivilization--the ages which have been consumed in reaching our present\r\naltitude, and see how we have outgrown slavery, feudalism, and religious\r\npersecutions, I cannot despair of the future of the race."\r\n\r\n"Just now," said Dr. Latimer, "we have the fearful grinding and friction\r\nwhich comes in the course of an adjustment of the new machinery of\r\nfreedom in the old ruts of slavery. But I am optimistic enough to\r\nbelieve that there will yet be a far higher and better Christian\r\ncivilization than our country has ever known."\r\n\r\n"And in that civilization I believe the negro is to be an important\r\nfactor," said Rev. Cantnor.\r\n\r\n"I believe it also," said Miss Delany, hopefully, "and this thought has\r\nbeen a blessed inspiration to my life. When I come in contact with\r\nChristless prejudices, I feel that my life is too much a part of the\r\nDivine plan, and invested with too much intrinsic worth, for me to be\r\nthe least humiliated by indignities that beggarly souls can inflict. I\r\nfeel more pitiful than resentful to those who do not know how much they\r\nmiss by living mean, ignoble lives."\r\n\r\n"My heart," said Iola, "is full of hope for the future. Pain and\r\nsuffering are the crucibles out of which come gold more fine than the\r\npavements of heaven, and gems more precious than the foundations of the\r\nHoly City."\r\n\r\n"If," said Mrs. Leroy, "pain and suffering are factors in human\r\ndevelopment, surely we have not been counted too worthless to suffer."\r\n\r\n"And is there," continued Iola, "a path which we have trodden in this\r\ncountry, unless it be the path of sin, into which Jesus Christ has not\r\nput His feet and left it luminous with the light of His steps? Has the\r\nnegro been poor and homeless? The birds of the air had nests and the\r\nfoxes had holes, but the Son of man had not where to lay His head. Has\r\nour name been a synonym for contempt? \'He shall be called a Nazarene.\'\r\nHave we been despised and trodden under foot? Christ was despised and\r\nrejected of men. Have we been ignorant and unlearned? It was said of\r\nJesus Christ, \'How knoweth this man letters, never having learned?\' Have\r\nwe been beaten and bruised in the prison-house of bondage? \'They took\r\nJesus and scourged Him.\' Have we been slaughtered, our bones scattered\r\nat the graves\' mouth? He was spit upon by the mob, smitten and mocked by\r\nthe rabble, and died as died Rome\'s meanest criminal slave. To-day that\r\ncross of shame is a throne of power. Those robes of scorn have changed\r\nto habiliments of light, and that crown of mockery to a diadem of glory.\r\nAnd never, while the agony of Gethsemane and the sufferings of Calvary\r\nhave their hold upon my heart, will I recognize any religion as His\r\nwhich despises the least of His brethren."\r\n\r\nAs Iola finished, there was a ring of triumph in her voice, as if she\r\nwere reviewing a path she had trodden with bleeding feet, and seen it\r\nchange to lines of living light. Her soul seemed to be flashing through\r\nthe rare loveliness of her face and etherealizing its beauty.\r\n\r\nEvery one was spell-bound. Dr. Latimer was entranced, and, turning to\r\nHon. Dugdale, said, in a low voice and with deep-drawn breath, "She is\r\nangelic!"\r\n\r\nHon. Dugdale turned, gave a questioning look, then replied, "She is\r\nstrangely beautiful! Do you know her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have met her several times. I accompanied her here to-night. The\r\ntones of her voice are like benedictions of peace; her words a call to\r\nhigher service and nobler life."\r\n\r\nJust then Rev. Carmicle was announced. He had been on a Southern tour,\r\nand had just returned.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Doctor," exclaimed Mrs. Stillman, "I am delighted to see you. We\r\nwere about to adjourn, but we will postpone action to hear from you."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," replied Rev. Carmicle. "I have not the cue to the meeting,\r\nand will listen while I take breath."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," answered Mrs. Stillman. "I should have been more thoughtful\r\nthan to press so welcome a guest into service before I had given him\r\ntime for rest and refreshment; but if the courtesy failed on my lips it\r\ndid not fail in my heart. I wanted our young folks to see one of our\r\nthinkers who had won distinction before the war."\r\n\r\n"My dear friend," said Rev. Carmicle, smiling, "some of these young\r\nfolks will look on me as a back number. You know the cry has already\r\ngone forth, \'Young men to the front.\'"\r\n\r\n"But we need old men for counsel," interposed Mr. Forest, of New York.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Rev. Carmicle, "we older men would rather retire\r\ngracefully than be relegated or hustled to a back seat. But I am pleased\r\nto see doors open to you which were closed to us, and opportunities\r\nwhich were denied us embraced by you."\r\n\r\n"How," asked Hon. Dugdale, "do you feel in reference to our people\'s\r\ncondition in the South?"\r\n\r\n"Very hopeful, although at times I cannot help feeling anxious about\r\ntheir future. I was delighted with my visits to various institutions of\r\nlearning, and surprised at the desire manifested among the young people\r\nto obtain an education. Where toil-worn mothers bent beneath their heavy\r\nburdens their more favored daughters are enjoying the privileges of\r\neducation. Young people are making recitations in Greek and Latin where\r\nit was once a crime to teach their parents to read. I also became\r\nacquainted with colored professors and presidents of colleges. Saw young\r\nladies who had graduated as doctors. Comfortable homes have succeeded\r\nold cabins of slavery. Vast crops have been raised by free labor. I read\r\nwith interest and pleasure a number of papers edited by colored men. I\r\nsaw it estimated that two millions of our people had learned to read,\r\nand I feel deeply grateful to the people who have supplied us with\r\nteachers who have stood their ground so nobly among our people."\r\n\r\n"But," asked Mr. Forest, "you expressed fears about the future of our\r\nrace. From whence do your fears arise?"\r\n\r\n"From the unfortunate conditions which slavery has entailed upon that\r\nsection of our country. I dread the results of that racial feeling which\r\never and anon breaks out into restlessness and crime. Also, I am\r\nconcerned about the lack of home training for those for whom the\r\ndiscipline of the plantation has been exchanged for the penalties of\r\nprisons and chain-gangs. I am sorry to see numbers of our young men\r\ngrowing away from the influence of the church and drifting into prisons.\r\nI also fear that in some sections, as colored men increase in wealth and\r\nintelligence, there will be an increase of race rivalry and jealousy. It\r\nis said that savages, by putting their ears to the ground, can hear a\r\nfar-off tread. So, to-day, I fear that there are savage elements in our\r\ncivilization which hear the advancing tread of the negro and would\r\nretard his coming. It is the incarnation of these elements that I dread.\r\nIt is their elimination I do so earnestly desire. Whether it be outgrown\r\nor not is our unsolved problem. Time alone will tell whether or not the\r\nvirus of slavery and injustice has too fully permeated our Southern\r\ncivilization for a complete recovery. Nations, honey-combed by vice,\r\nhave fallen beneath the weight of their iniquities. Justice is always\r\nuncompromising in its claims and inexorable in its demands. The laws of\r\nthe universe are never repealed to accommodate our follies."\r\n\r\n"Surely," said Bishop Tunster, "the negro has a higher mission than that\r\nof aimlessly drifting through life and patiently waiting for death."\r\n\r\n"We may not," answered Rev. Carmicle, "have the same dash, courage, and\r\naggressiveness of other races, accustomed to struggle, achievement, and\r\ndominion, but surely the world needs something better than the results\r\nof arrogance, aggressiveness, and indomitable power. For the evils of\r\nsociety there are no solvents as potent as love and justice, and our\r\ngreatest need is not more wealth and learning, but a religion replete\r\nwith life and glowing with love. Let this be the impelling force in the\r\nrace and it cannot fail to rise in the scale of character and\r\ncondition."\r\n\r\n"And," said Dr. Latimer, "instead of narrowing our sympathies to mere\r\nracial questions, let us broaden them to humanity\'s wider issues."\r\n\r\n"Let us," replied Rev. Carmicle, "pass it along the lines, that to be\r\nwillfully ignorant is to be shamefully criminal. Let us teach our people\r\nnot to love pleasure or to fear death, but to learn the true value of\r\nlife, and to do their part to eliminate the paganism of caste from our\r\nholy religion and the lawlessness of savagery from our civilization."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"How did you enjoy the evening, Marie?" asked Robert, as they walked\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\n"I was interested and deeply pleased," answered Marie.\r\n\r\n"I," said Robert, "was thinking of the wonderful changes that\r\nhave come to us since the war. When I sat in those well-lighted,\r\nbeautifully-furnished rooms, I was thinking of the meetings we used to\r\nhave in by-gone days. How we used to go by stealth into lonely woods and\r\ngloomy swamps, to tell of our hopes and fears, sorrows and trials. I\r\nhope that we will have many more of these gatherings. Let us have the\r\nnext one here."\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Marie, "I would gladly welcome such a conference at\r\nany time. I think such meetings would be so helpful to our young\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWNING AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Iola, as they walked home from the _conversazione_, "I\r\nwish I could do something more for our people than I am doing. I taught\r\nin the South till failing health compelled me to change my employment.\r\nBut, now that I am well and strong, I would like to do something of\r\nlasting service for the race."\r\n\r\n"Why not," asked Dr. Latimer, "write a good, strong book which would be\r\nhelpful to them? I think there is an amount of dormant talent among us,\r\nand a large field from which to gather materials for such a book."\r\n\r\n"I would do it, willingly, if I could; but one needs both leisure and\r\nmoney to make a successful book. There is material among us for the\r\nbroadest comedies and the deepest tragedies, but, besides money and\r\nleisure, it needs patience, perseverance, courage, and the hand of an\r\nartist to weave it into the literature of the country."\r\n\r\n"Miss Leroy, you have a large and rich experience; you possess a vivid\r\nimagination and glowing fancy. Write, out of the fullness of your heart,\r\na book to inspire men and women with a deeper sense of justice and\r\nhumanity."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," replied Iola, "I would do it if I could, not for the money it\r\nmight bring, but for the good it might do. But who believes any good can\r\ncome out of the black Nazareth?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Leroy, out of the race must come its own thinkers and writers.\r\nAuthors belonging to the white race have written good racial books, for\r\nwhich I am deeply grateful, but it seems to be almost impossible for a\r\nwhite man to put himself completely in our place. No man can feel the\r\niron which enters another man\'s soul."\r\n\r\n"Well, Doctor, when I write a book I shall take you for the hero of my\r\nstory."\r\n\r\n"Why, what have I done," asked Dr. Latimer, in a surprised tone, "that\r\nyou should impale me on your pen?"\r\n\r\n"You have done nobly," answered Iola, "in refusing your grandmother\'s\r\noffer."\r\n\r\n"I only did my duty," he modestly replied.\r\n\r\n"But," said Iola, "when others are trying to slip out from the race and\r\npass into the white basis, I cannot help admiring one who acts as if he\r\nfelt that the weaker the race is the closer he would cling to it."\r\n\r\n"My mother," replied Dr. Latimer, "faithful and true, belongs to that\r\nrace. Where else should I be? But I know a young lady who could have\r\ncast her lot with the favored race, yet chose to take her place with the\r\nfreed people, as their teacher, friend, and adviser. This young lady was\r\nalone in the world. She had been fearfully wronged, and to her stricken\r\nheart came a brilliant offer of love, home, and social position. But she\r\nbound her heart to the mast of duty, closed her ears to the syren song,\r\nand could not be lured from her purpose."\r\n\r\nA startled look stole over Iola\'s face, and, lifting her eyes to his,\r\nshe faltered:--\r\n\r\n"Do you know her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know her and admire her; and she ought to be made the subject\r\nof a soul-inspiring story. Do you know of whom I speak?"\r\n\r\n"How should I, Doctor? I am sure you have not made me your confidante,"\r\nshe responded, demurely; then she quickly turned and tripped up the\r\nsteps of her home, which she had just reached.\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation Dr. Latimer became a frequent visitor at Iola\'s\r\nhome, and a firm friend of her brother. Harry was at that age when, for\r\nthe young and inexperienced, vice puts on her fairest guise and most\r\nseductive smiles. Dr. Latimer\'s wider knowledge and larger experience\r\nmade his friendship for Harry very valuable, and the service he rendered\r\nhim made him a favorite and ever-welcome guest in the family.\r\n\r\n"Are you all alone," asked Robert, one night, as he entered the cosy\r\nlittle parlor where Iola sat reading. "Where are the rest of the folks?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma and grandma have gone to bed," answered Iola. "Harry and Lucille\r\nare at the concert. They are passionately fond of music, and find\r\nfacilities here that they do not have in the South. They wouldn\'t go to\r\nhear a seraph where they must take a negro seat. I was too tired to go.\r\nBesides, \'two\'s company and three\'s a crowd,\'" she added, significantly.\r\n\r\n"I reckon you struck the nail on the head that time," said Robert,\r\nlaughing. "But you have not been alone all the time. Just as I reached\r\nthe corner I saw Dr. Latimer leaving the door. I see he still continues\r\nhis visits. Who is his patient now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Uncle Robert," said Iola, smiling and flushing, "he is out with\r\nHarry and Lucille part of the time, and drops in now and then to see us\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Robert, "I suppose the case is now an affair of the heart.\r\nBut I cannot blame him for it," he added, looking fondly on the\r\nbeautiful face of his niece, which sorrow had touched only to chisel\r\ninto more loveliness. "How do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"I must have within me," answered Iola, with unaffected truthfulness, "a\r\nlarge amount of hero worship. The characters of the Old Testament I most\r\nadmire are Moses and Nehemiah. They were willing to put aside their own\r\nadvantages for their race and country. Dr. Latimer comes up to my ideal\r\nof a high, heroic manhood."\r\n\r\n"I think," answered Robert, smiling archly, "he would be delighted to\r\nhear your opinion of him."\r\n\r\n"I tell him," continued Iola, "that he belongs to the days of chivalry.\r\nBut he smiles and says, \'he only belongs to the days of hard-pan\r\nservice.\'"\r\n\r\n"Some one," said Robert, "was saying to-day that he stood in his own\r\nlight when he refused his grandmother\'s offer to receive him as her\r\nson."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Iola, "it was the grandest hour of his life when he made\r\nthat decision. I have admired him ever since I heard his story."\r\n\r\n"But, Iola, think of the advantages he set aside. It was no sacrifice\r\nfor me to remain colored, with my lack of education and race sympathies,\r\nbut Dr. Latimer had doors open to him as a white man which are forever\r\nclosed to a colored man. To be born white in this country is to be born\r\nto an inheritance of privileges, to hold in your hands the keys that\r\nopen before you the doors of every occupation, advantage, opportunity,\r\nand achievement."\r\n\r\n"I know that, uncle," answered Iola; "but even these advantages are too\r\ndearly bought if they mean loss of honor, true manliness, and self\r\nrespect. He could not have retained these had he ignored his mother and\r\nlived under a veil of concealment, constantly haunted by a dread of\r\ndetection. The gain would not have been worth the cost. It were better\r\nthat he should walk the ruggedest paths of life a true man than tread\r\nthe softest carpets a moral cripple."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," said Robert, laying his hand caressingly upon her head,\r\n"that we are destined to lose the light of our home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, uncle, how you talk! I never dreamed of what you are thinking,"\r\nanswered Iola, half reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"And how," asked Robert, "do you know what I am thinking about?"\r\n\r\n"My dear uncle, I\'m not blind."\r\n\r\n"Neither am I," replied Robert, significantly, as he left the room.\r\n\r\nIola\'s admiration for Dr. Latimer was not a one-sided affair. Day after\r\nday she was filling a larger place in his heart. The touch of her hand\r\nthrilled him with emotion. Her lightest words were an entrancing melody\r\nto his ear. Her noblest sentiments found a response in his heart. In\r\ntheir desire to help the race their hearts beat in loving unison. One\r\ngrand and noble purpose was giving tone and color to their lives and\r\nstrengthening the bonds of affection between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOING AND WEDDING.\r\n\r\nHarry\'s vacation had been very pleasant. Miss Delany, with her fine\r\nconversational powers and ready wit, had added much to his enjoyment.\r\nRobert had given his mother the pleasantest room in the house, and in\r\nthe evening the family would gather around her, tell her the news of the\r\nday, read to her from the Bible, join with her in thanksgiving for\r\nmercies received and in prayer for protection through the night. Harry\r\nwas very grateful to Dr. Latimer for the kindly interest he had shown in\r\naccompanying Miss Delany and himself to places of interest and\r\namusement. He was grateful, too, that in the city of P---- doors were\r\nopen to them which were barred against them in the South.\r\n\r\nThe bright, beautiful days of summer were gliding into autumn, with its\r\nglorious wealth of foliage, and the time was approaching for the\r\ndeparture of Harry and Miss Delany to their respective schools, when Dr.\r\nLatimer received several letters from North Carolina, urging him to come\r\nSouth, as physicians were greatly needed there. Although his practice\r\nwas lucrative in the city of P----, he resolved he would go where his\r\nservices were most needed.\r\n\r\nA few evenings before he started he called at the house, and made an\r\nengagement to drive Iola to the park.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed he drove up to the door in his fine equipage.\r\nIola stepped gracefully in and sat quietly by his side to enjoy the\r\nloveliness of the scenery and the gorgeous grandeur of the setting sun.\r\n\r\n"I expect to go South," said Dr. Latimer, as he drove slowly along.\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed," said Iola, assuming an air of interest, while a shadow\r\nflitted over her face. "Where do you expect to pitch your tent?"\r\n\r\n"In the city of C----, North Carolina," he answered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wish," she exclaimed, "that you were going to Georgia, where you\r\ncould take care of that high-spirited brother of mine."\r\n\r\n"I suppose if he were to hear you he would laugh, and say that he could\r\ntake care of himself. But I know a better plan than that."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked Iola, innocently.\r\n\r\n"That you will commit yourself, instead of your brother, to my care."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear," replied Iola, drawing a long breath. "What would mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"That she would willingly resign you, I hope."\r\n\r\n"And what would grandma and Uncle Robert say?" again asked Iola.\r\n\r\n"That they would cheerfully acquiesce. Now, what would I say if they all\r\nconsent?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," modestly responded Iola.\r\n\r\n"Well," replied Dr. Latimer, "I would say:--\r\n\r\n    "Could deeds my love discover,\r\n          Could valor gain thy charms,\r\n     To prove myself thy lover\r\n          I\'d face a world in arms."\r\n\r\n"And prove a good soldier," added Iola, smiling, "when there is no\r\nbattle to fight."\r\n\r\n"Iola, I am in earnest," said Dr. Latimer, passionately. "In the work to\r\nwhich I am devoted every burden will be lighter, every path smoother, if\r\nbrightened and blessed with your companionship."\r\n\r\nA sober expression swept over Iola\'s face, and, dropping her eyes, she\r\nsaid: "I must have time to think."\r\n\r\nQuietly they rode along the river bank until Dr. Latimer broke the\r\nsilence by saying:--\r\n\r\n"Miss Iola, I think that you brood too much over the condition of our\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I do," she replied, "but they never burn a man in the South\r\nthat they do not kindle a fire around my soul."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid," replied Dr. Latimer, "that you will grow morbid and\r\nnervous. Most of our people take life easily--why shouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Because," she answered, "I can see breakers ahead which they do not."\r\n\r\n"Oh, give yourself no uneasiness. They will catch the fret and fever of\r\nthe nineteenth century soon enough. I have heard several of our\r\nministers say that it is chiefly men of disreputable characters who are\r\nmade the subjects of violence and lynch-law."\r\n\r\n"Suppose it is so," responded Iola, feelingly. "If these men believe in\r\neternal punishment they ought to feel a greater concern for the wretched\r\nsinner who is hurried out of time with all his sins upon his head, than\r\nfor the godly man who passes through violence to endless rest."\r\n\r\n"That is true; and I am not counseling you to be selfish; but, Miss\r\nIola, had you not better look out for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Doctor, I am feeling quite well."\r\n\r\n"I know it, but your devotion to study and work is too intense," he\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"I am preparing to teach, and must spend my leisure time in study. Mr.\r\nCloten is an excellent employer, and treats his employ\xe9s as if they had\r\nhearts as well as hands. But to be an expert accountant is not the best\r\nuse to which I can put my life."\r\n\r\n"As a teacher you will need strong health and calm nerves. You had\r\nbetter let me prescribe for you. You need," he added, with a merry\r\ntwinkle in his eyes, "change of air, change of scene, and change of\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Well, Doctor," said Iola, laughing, "that is the newest nostrum out.\r\nHad you not better apply for a patent?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," replied Dr. Latimer, with affected gravity, "you know you must\r\nhave unlimited faith in your physician."\r\n\r\n"So you wish me to try the faith cure?" asked Iola, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, faith in me," responded Dr. Latimer, seriously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here we are at home!" exclaimed Iola. "This has been a glorious\r\nevening, Doctor. I am indebted to you for a great pleasure. I am\r\nextremely grateful."\r\n\r\n"You are perfectly welcome," replied Dr. Latimer. "The pleasure has been\r\nmutual, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"Will you not come in?" asked Iola.\r\n\r\nTying his horse, he accompanied Iola into the parlor. Seating himself\r\nnear her, he poured into her ears words eloquent with love and\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n"Iola," he said, "I am not an adept in courtly phrases. I am a plain\r\nman, who believes in love and truth. In asking you to share my lot, I am\r\nnot inviting you to a life of ease and luxury, for year after year I may\r\nhave to struggle to keep the wolf from the door, but your presence would\r\nmake my home one of the brightest spots on earth, and one of the fairest\r\ntypes of heaven. Am I presumptuous in hoping that your love will become\r\nthe crowning joy of my life?"\r\n\r\nHis words were more than a tender strain wooing her to love and\r\nhappiness, they were a clarion call to a life of high and holy worth, a\r\ncall which found a response in her heart. Her hand lay limp in his. She\r\ndid not withdraw it, but, raising her lustrous eyes to his, she softly\r\nanswered: "Frank, I love you."\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone, Iola sat by the window, gazing at the splendid stars,\r\nher heart quietly throbbing with a delicious sense of joy and love. She\r\nhad admired Dr. Gresham and, had there been no barrier in her way, she\r\nmight have learned to love him; but Dr. Latimer had grown irresistibly\r\nupon her heart. There were depths in her nature that Dr. Gresham had\r\nnever fathomed; aspirations in her soul with which he had never mingled.\r\nBut as the waves leap up to the strand, so her soul went out to Dr.\r\nLatimer. Between their lives were no impeding barriers, no inclination\r\nimpelling one way and duty compelling another. Kindred hopes and tastes\r\nhad knit their hearts; grand and noble purposes were lighting up their\r\nlives; and they esteemed it a blessed privilege to stand on the\r\nthreshold of a new era and labor for those who had passed from the old\r\noligarchy of slavery into the new commonwealth of freedom.\r\n\r\nOn the next evening, Dr. Latimer rang the bell and was answered by\r\nHarry, who ushered him into the parlor, and then came back to the\r\nsitting-room, saying, "Iola, Dr. Latimer has called to see you."\r\n\r\n"Has he?" answered Iola, a glad light coming into her eyes. "Come,\r\nLucille, let us go into the parlor."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," interposed Harry, shrugging his shoulders and catching\r\nLucille\'s hand. "He didn\'t ask for you. When we went to the concert we\r\nwere told three\'s a crowd. And I say one good turn deserves another."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry, you are so full of nonsense. Let Lucille go!" said Iola.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I will not. I want to have a good time as well as you," said\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re the most nonsensical man I know," interposed Miss Delany.\r\nYet she stayed with Harry.\r\n\r\n"You\'re looking very bright and happy," said Dr. Latimer to Iola, as she\r\nentered.\r\n\r\n"My ride in the park was so refreshing! I enjoyed it so much! The day\r\nwas so lovely, the air delicious, the birds sang so sweetly, and the\r\nsunset was so magnificent."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it. Why, Iola, your home is so happy your heart should be\r\nas light as a school-girl\'s."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," she replied, "I must be prematurely old. I have scarcely known\r\nwhat it is to be light-hearted since my father\'s death."\r\n\r\n"I know it, darling," he answered, seating himself beside her, and\r\ndrawing her to him. "You have been tried in the fire, but are you not\r\nbetter for the crucial test?"\r\n\r\n"Doctor," she replied, "as we rode along yesterday, mingling with the\r\nsunshine of the present came the shadows of the past. I was thinking of\r\nthe bright, joyous days of my girlhood, when I defended slavery, and of\r\nhow the cup that I would have pressed to the lips of others was forced\r\nto my own. Yet, in looking over the mournful past, I would not change\r\nthe Iola of then for the Iola of now."\r\n\r\n"Yes," responded Dr. Latimer, musingly,\r\n\r\n    "\'Darkness shows us worlds of light\r\n        We never saw by day.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Doctor, you cannot conceive what it must have been to be hurled\r\nfrom a home of love and light into the dark abyss of slavery; to be\r\ncompelled to take your place among a people you have learned to look\r\nupon as inferiors and social outcasts; to be in the power of men whose\r\npresence would fill you with horror and loathing, and to know that there\r\nis no earthly power to protect you from the highest insults which brutal\r\ncowardice could shower upon you. I am so glad that no other woman of my\r\nrace will suffer as I have done."\r\n\r\nThe flush deepened on her face, a mournful splendor beamed from her\r\nbeautiful eyes, into which the tears had slowly gathered.\r\n\r\n"Darling," he said, his voice vibrating with mingled feelings of\r\ntenderness and resentment, "you must forget the sad past. You are like a\r\ntender lamb snatched from the jaws of a hungry wolf, but who still needs\r\nprotecting, loving care. But it must have been terrible," he added, in a\r\npainful tone.\r\n\r\n"It was indeed! For awhile I was like one dazed. I tried to pray, but\r\nthe heavens seemed brass over my head. I was wild with agony, and had I\r\nnot been placed under conditions which roused all the resistance of my\r\nsoul, I would have lost my reason."\r\n\r\n"Was it not a mistake to have kept you ignorant of your colored blood?"\r\n\r\n"It was the great mistake of my father\'s life, but dear papa knew\r\nsomething of the cruel, crushing power of caste; and he tried to shield\r\nus from it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," replied Dr. Latimer, thoughtfully, "in trying to shield you\r\nfrom pain he plunged you into deeper suffering."\r\n\r\n"I never blame him, because I know he did it for the best. Had he lived\r\nhe would have taken us to France, where I should have had a life of\r\ncareless ease and pleasure. But now my life has a much grander\r\nsignificance than it would have had under such conditions. Fearful as\r\nthe awakening was, it was better than to have slept through life."\r\n\r\n"Best for you and best for me," said Dr. Latimer. "There are souls that\r\nnever awaken; but if they miss the deepest pain they also lose the\r\nhighest joy."\r\n\r\nDr. Latimer went South, after his engagement, and through his medical\r\nskill and agreeable manners became very successful in his practice. In\r\nthe following summer, he built a cosy home for the reception of his\r\nbride, and came North, where, with Harry and Miss Delany as attendants,\r\nhe was married to Iola, amid a pleasant gathering of friends, by Rev.\r\nCarmicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the summer when Dr. Latimer and his bride reached their\r\nhome in North Carolina. Over the cottage porch were morning-glories to\r\ngreet the first flushes of the rising day, and roses and jasmines to\r\ndistill their fragrance on the evening air. Aunt Linda, who had been\r\napprised of their coming, was patiently awaiting their arrival, and\r\nUncle Daniel was pleased to know that "dat sweet young lady who had sich\r\nputty manners war comin\' to lib wid dem."\r\n\r\nAs soon as they arrived, Aunt Linda rushed up to Iola, folded her in her\r\narms, and joyfully exclaimed: "How\'dy, honey! I\'se so glad you\'s come. I\r\nseed it in a vision dat somebody fair war comin\' to help us. An\' wen I\r\nyered it war you, I larffed and jist rolled ober, and larffed and jist\r\ngib up."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Linda, I am not very fair," replied Mrs. Latimer.\r\n\r\n"Well, chile, you\'s fair to me. How\'s all yore folks in de up kentry?"\r\n\r\n"All well. I expect them down soon to live here."\r\n\r\n"What, Har\'yet, and Robby, an\' yer ma? Oh, dat is too good. I allers\r\nsaid Robby had san\' in his craw, and war born for good luck. He war a\r\nmighty nice boy. Har\'yet\'s in clover now. Well, ebery dorg has its day,\r\nand de cat has Sunday. I allers tole Har\'yet ter keep a stiff upper lip;\r\ndat it war a long road dat had no turn."\r\n\r\nDr. Latimer was much gratified by the tender care Aunt Linda bestowed\r\non Iola.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t goin\' to let her do nuffin till she gits seasoned. She looks as\r\nsweet as a peach. I allers wanted some nice lady to come down yere and\r\nlarn our gals some sense. I can\'t read myself, but I likes ter yere dem\r\ndat can."\r\n\r\n"Well, Aunt Linda, I am going to teach in the Sunday-school, help in the\r\nchurch, hold mothers\' meetings to help these boys and girls to grow up\r\nto be good men and women. Won\'t you get a pair of spectacles and learn\r\nto read?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yer can\'t git dat book froo my head, no way you fix it. I knows\r\nnuff to git to hebben, and dat\'s all I wants to know." Aunt Linda was\r\nkind and obliging, but there was one place where she drew the line, and\r\nthat was at learning to read.\r\n\r\nHarry and Miss Delany accompanied Iola as far as her new home, and\r\nremained several days. The evening before their departure, Harry took\r\nMiss Delany a drive of several miles through the pine barrens.\r\n\r\n"This thing is getting very monotonous," Harry broke out, when they had\r\ngone some distance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I enjoy it!" replied Miss Delany. "These stately pines look so\r\ngrand and solemn, they remind me of a procession of hooded monks."\r\n\r\n"What in the world are you talking about, Lucille?" asked Harry, looking\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n"About those pine-trees," replied Miss Delany, in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw, I wasn\'t thinking about them. I\'m thinking about Iola and\r\nFrank."\r\n\r\n"What about them?" asked Lucille.\r\n\r\n"Why, when I was in P----, Dr. Latimer used to be first-rate company,\r\nbut now it is nothing but what Iola wants, and what Iola says, and what\r\nIola likes. I don\'t believe that there is a subject I could name to him,\r\nfrom spinning a top to circumnavigating the globe, that he wouldn\'t\r\nsomehow contrive to bring Iola in. And I don\'t believe you could talk\r\nten minutes to Iola on any subject, from dressing a doll to the latest\r\ndiscovery in science, that she wouldn\'t manage to lug in Frank."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you absurd creature!" responded Lucille, "this is their honeymoon,\r\nand they are deeply in love with each other. Wait till you get in love\r\nwith some one."\r\n\r\n"I am in love now," replied Harry, with a serious air.\r\n\r\n"With whom?" asked Lucille, archly.\r\n\r\n"With you," answered Harry, trying to take her hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry!" she exclaimed, playfully resisting. "Don\'t be so\r\nnonsensical! Don\'t you think the bride looked lovely, with that dress of\r\nspotless white and with those orange blossoms in her hair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did; that\'s a fact," responded Harry. "But, Lucille, I think\r\nthere is a great deal of misplaced sentiment at weddings," he added,\r\nmore seriously.\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, here are a couple just married, and who are as happy as happy can\r\nbe; and people will crowd around them wishing much joy; but who thinks\r\nof wishing joy to the forlorn old bachelors and restless old maids?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Harry, if you want people to wish you much happiness, why don\'t\r\nyou do as the doctor has done, get yourself a wife?"\r\n\r\n"I will," he replied, soberly, "when you say so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Harry, don\'t be so absurd."\r\n\r\n"Indeed there isn\'t a bit of absurdity about what I say. I am in\r\nearnest." There was something in the expression of Harry\'s face and the\r\ntone of his voice which arrested the banter on Lucille\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"I think it was Charles Lamb," replied Lucille, "who once said that\r\nschool-teachers are uncomfortable people, and, Harry, I would not like\r\nto make you uncomfortable by marrying you."\r\n\r\n"You will make me uncomfortable by not marrying me."\r\n\r\n"But," replied Lucille, "your mother may not prefer me for a daughter.\r\nYou know, Harry, complexional prejudices are not confined to white\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"My mother," replied Harry, with an air of confidence, "is too noble to\r\nindulge in such sentiments."\r\n\r\n"And Iola, would she be satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"Why, it would add to her satisfaction. She is not one who can\'t be\r\nwhite and won\'t be black."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," replied Lucille, "I will take the question of your comfort\r\ninto consideration."\r\n\r\nThe above promise was thoughtfully remembered by Lucille till a bridal\r\nring and happy marriage were the result.\r\n\r\nSoon after Iola had settled in C---- she quietly took her place in the\r\nSunday-school as a teacher, and in the church as a helper. She was\r\nwelcomed by the young pastor, who found in her a strong and faithful\r\nally. Together they planned meetings for the especial benefit of mothers\r\nand children. When the dens of vice are spreading their snares for the\r\nfeet of the tempted and inexperienced her doors are freely opened for\r\nthe instruction of the children before their feet have wandered and gone\r\nfar astray. She has no carpets too fine for the tread of their little\r\nfeet. She thinks it is better to have stains on her carpet than stains\r\non their souls through any neglect of hers. In lowly homes and\r\nwindowless cabins her visits are always welcome. Little children love\r\nher. Old age turns to her for comfort, young girls for guidance, and\r\nmothers for counsel. Her life is full of blessedness.\r\n\r\nDoctor Latimer by his kindness and skill has won the name of the "Good\r\nDoctor." But he is more than a successful doctor; he is a true patriot\r\nand a good citizen. Honest, just, and discriminating, he endeavors by\r\nprecept and example to instill into the minds of others sentiments of\r\ngood citizenship. He is a leader in every reform movement for the\r\nbenefit of the community; but his patriotism is not confined to race\r\nlines. "The world is his country, and mankind his countrymen." While he\r\nabhors their deeds of violence, he pities the short-sighted and besotted\r\nmen who seem madly intent upon laying magazines of powder under the\r\ncradles of unborn generations. He has great faith in the possibilities\r\nof the negro, and believes that, enlightened and Christianized, he will\r\nsink the old animosities of slavery into the new community of interests\r\narising from freedom; and that his influence upon the South will be as\r\nthe influence of the sun upon the earth. As when the sun passes from\r\nCapricorn to Cancer, beauty, greenness, and harmony spring up in his\r\npath, so he hopes that the future career of the negro will be a greater\r\ninfluence for freedom and social advancement than it was in the days of\r\nyore for slavery and its inferior civilization.\r\n\r\nHarry and Lucille are at the head of a large and flourishing school.\r\nLucille gives her ripening experience to her chosen work, to which she\r\nwas too devoted to resign. And through the school they are lifting up\r\nthe homes of the people. Some have pitied, others blamed, Harry for\r\ncasting his lot with the colored people, but he knows that life\'s\r\nhighest and best advantages do not depend on the color of the skin or\r\ntexture of the hair. He has his reward in the improved condition of his\r\npupils and the superb manhood and noble life which he has developed in\r\nhis much needed work.\r\n\r\nUncle Daniel still lingers on the shores of time, a cheery, lovable old\r\nman, loved and respected by all; a welcome guest in every home. Soon\r\nafter Iola\'s marriage, Robert sold out his business and moved with his\r\nmother and sister to North Carolina. He bought a large plantation near\r\nC----, which he divided into small homesteads, and sold to poor but\r\nthrifty laborers, and his heart has been gladdened by their increased\r\nprosperity and progress. He has seen the one-roomed cabins change to\r\ncomfortable cottages, in which cleanliness and order have supplanted the\r\nprolific causes of disease and death. Kind and generous, he often\r\nremembers Mrs. Johnson and sends her timely aid.\r\n\r\nMarie\'s pale, spiritual face still bears traces of the beauty which was\r\nher youthful dower, but its bloom has been succeeded by an air of\r\nsweetness and dignity. Though frail in health, she is always ready to\r\nlend a helping hand wherever and whenever she can.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Johnson was glad to return South and spend the remnant of\r\nher days with the remaining friends of her early life. Although feeble,\r\nshe is in full sympathy with her children for the uplifting of the race.\r\nMarie and her mother are enjoying their aftermath of life, one by\r\nrendering to others all the service in her power, while the other, with\r\nher face turned toward the celestial city, is\r\n\r\n    "Only waiting till the angels\r\n      Open wide the mystic gate."\r\n\r\nThe shadows have been lifted from all their lives; and peace, like\r\nbright dew, has descended upon their paths. Blessed themselves, their\r\nlives are a blessing to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nFrom threads of fact and fiction I have woven a story whose mission will\r\nnot be in vain if it awaken in the hearts of our countrymen a stronger\r\nsense of justice and a more Christlike humanity in behalf of those whom\r\nthe fortunes of war threw, homeless, ignorant and poor, upon the\r\nthreshold of a new era. Nor will it be in vain if it inspire the\r\nchildren of those upon whose brows God has poured the chrism of that new\r\nera to determine that they will embrace every opportunity, develop every\r\nfaculty, and use every power God has given them to rise in the scale of\r\ncharacter and condition, and to add their quota of good citizenship to\r\nthe best welfare of the nation. There are scattered among us materials\r\nfor mournful tragedies and mirth-provoking comedies, which some hand may\r\nyet bring into the literature of the country, glowing with the fervor of\r\nthe tropics and enriched by the luxuriance of the Orient, and thus add\r\nto the solution of our unsolved American problem.\r\n\r\nThe race has not had very long to straighten its hands from the hoe, to\r\ngrasp the pen and wield it as a power for good, and to erect above the\r\nruined auction-block and slave-pen institutions of learning, but\r\n\r\n    There is light beyond the darkness,\r\n          Joy beyond the present pain;\r\n    There is hope in God\'s great justice\r\n          And the negro\'s rising brain.\r\n    Though the morning seems to linger\r\n          O\'er the hill-tops far away,\r\n    Yet the shadows bear the promise\r\n          Of a brighter coming day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Iola Leroy, by Frances E.W.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
