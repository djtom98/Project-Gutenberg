We know that Heracles chose the\r\nformer and was therefore permitted to commit a certain number of crimes\r\nagainst the Arcadian Stag, the Amazons, the Golden Apples, and the\r\nGiants.\r\n\r\nHad Prodicos gone no further than this, he would simply have written a\r\nfable marked by a certain cheap Symbolism; but he was a good\r\nphilosopher, and his collection of tales, _The Hours_, in three parts,\r\npresented the moral truths under the various aspects that befit them,\r\naccording to the three ages of life. To little children he complacently\r\nheld up the example of the austere choice of Heracles; to young men,\r\ndoubtless, he related the voluptuous choice of Paris, and I imagine\r\nthat to full-grown men he addressed himself somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day Odysseus was roaming about the foot of the mountains of\r\nDelphi, hunting, when he fell in with two maidens holding one another\r\nby the hand. One of them had glossy, black hair, clear eyes, and a\r\ngrave look. She said to him: \xe2\x80\x98I am Arete.\xe2\x80\x99 The other had drooping\r\neyelids, delicate hands, and tender breasts. She said: \xe2\x80\x98I am \xe2\x80\x98Tryphe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd both exclaimed: \xe2\x80\x98Choose between us.\xe2\x80\x99 But the subtile Odysseus\r\nanswered sagely. \xe2\x80\x98How should I choose? You are inseparable. The eyes\r\nthat have seen you pass by separately have witnessed but a barren\r\nshadow. Just as sincere virtue does not repel the eternal joys that\r\npleasure offers it, in like manner self-indulgence would be in evil\r\nplight without a certain nobility of spirit. I will follow both of you.\r\nShow me the way.\xe2\x80\x99 No sooner had he finished speaking than the two\r\nvisions were merged in one another, and Odysseus knew that he had been\r\ntalking with the great golden Aphrodite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe principal character of the novel which the reader is about to have\r\nunder his eyes is a woman, a courtesan of antiquity; but let him take\r\nheart of grace: she will not be converted in the end.\r\n\r\nShe will be loved neither by a saint, nor by a prophet, nor by a god.\r\nIn the literature of to-day this is a novelty.\r\n\r\nA courtesan, she will be a courtesan with the frankness, the ardour,\r\nand also the conscious pride of every human being who has a vocation\r\nand has freely chosen the place he occupies in society; she will aspire\r\nto rise to the highest point; the idea that her life demands excuse or\r\nmystery will not even cross her mind. This point requires elucidation.\r\n\r\nHitherto, the modern writers who have appealed to a public less\r\nprejudiced than that of young girls and upper-form boys have resorted\r\nto a laborious stratagem the hypocrisy of which is displeasing to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have painted pleasure as it really is,\xe2\x80\x9d they say, \xe2\x80\x9cin order to exalt\r\nvirtue.\xe2\x80\x9d In commencing a novel which has Alexandria for its scene, I\r\nrefuse absolutely to perpetuate this anachronism.\r\n\r\nLove, with all that it implies, was, for the Greeks, the most virtuous\r\nof sentiments and the most prolific in greatness. They never attached\r\nto it the ideas of lewdness and immodesty which the Jewish tradition\r\nhas handed down to us with the Christian doctrine. Herodotos (I. 10)\r\ntells us in the most natural manner possible, \xe2\x80\x9cAmongst certain\r\nbarbarous peoples it is considered disgraceful to appear in public\r\nnaked.\xe2\x80\x9d When the Greeks or the Latins wished to insult a man who\r\nfrequented women of pleasure, they called him \xce\xbc\xce\xbf\xe1\xbc\xb4\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 or _m\xc5\x93chus_, which\r\nsimply means adulterer. A man and a woman who, without being bound by\r\nany tie, formed a union with one another, whether it were in public or\r\nnot, and whatever their youth might be, were regarded as injuring no\r\none and were left in peace.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the life of the ancients cannot be judged according\r\nto the ideas of morality which we owe to Geneva.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I have written this book with the same simplicity as an\r\nAthenian narrating the same adventures. I hope that it will be read in\r\nthe same spirit.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue to judge of the ancient Greeks according to ideas\r\nat present in vogue, it is necessary that _not a single_ exact\r\ntranslation of their great writers should fall in the hands of a\r\nfifth-form schoolboy. If M. Mounet\xe2\x80\x94Sully were to play his part of\r\n\xc5\x93dipus without making any omissions, the police would suspend the\r\nperformance. Had not M. Leconte de Lisle expurgated Theocritos, from\r\nprudent motives, his book would have been seized the very day it was\r\nput on sale. Aristophanes is regarded as exceptional! But we possess\r\nimportant fragments of fourteen hundred and forty comedies, due to one\r\nhundred and thirty-two Greek poets, some of whom, such as Alexis,\r\nPhiletairos, Strattis, Euboulos, Cratinos, have left us admirable\r\nlines, and nobody has yet dared to translate this immodest and charming\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nWith the object of defending Greek morals, it is the custom to quote\r\nthe teaching of certain philosophers who reproved sexual pleasures. But\r\nthere exists a confusion in this matter. These rare moralists blamed\r\nthe excesses of all the senses without distinction, without setting up\r\nany difference between the debauch of the bed and that of the table. A\r\nman who orders a solitary dinner which costs him six louis, at a modern\r\nParis restaurant, would have been judged by them to be as guilty, and\r\nno less guilty, than a man who should make a rendez-vous of too\r\nintimate a nature in the public street and should be condemned\r\ntherefore to a year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment by the existing laws. Moreover,\r\nthese austere philosophers were generally regarded by ancient society\r\nas dangerous madmen; they were scoffed at in every theatre; they\r\nreceived thrashings in the street; the tyrants chose them for their\r\ncourt jesters, and the citizens of free States sent them into exile,\r\nwhen they did not deem them worthy of capital punishment.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, by a conscious and voluntary fraud, that modern educators,\r\nfrom the Renaissance to the present day, have represented the ancient\r\ncode of morality as the inspiring source of their narrow virtues. If\r\nthis code was great, if it deserves to be chosen for a model and to be\r\nobeyed, it is precisely because none other has more successfully\r\ndistinguished the just from the unjust according to a criterion of\r\nbeauty; proclaimed the right of all men to find their individual\r\nhappiness within the bounds to which it is limited by the corresponding\r\nright of others, and declared that there is nothing under heaven more\r\nsacred than physical love, nothing more beautiful than the human body.\r\n\r\nSuch were the ethics of the nation that built the Acropolis; and if I\r\nadd that they are still those of all great minds, I shall merely attest\r\nthe value of a common-place. It is abundantly proved that the higher\r\nintelligences of artists, writers, warriors, or statesmen have never\r\nregarded the majestic toleration of ancient morals as illegitimate.\r\nAristotle began life by wasting his patrimony in the society of riotous\r\nwomen; Sappho has given her name to a special vice; C\xc3\xa6sar was the\r\n_m\xc5\x93chus calvus_; nor can we imagine Racine shunning the stage-women nor\r\nNapoleon practicing abstinence. Mirabeau\xe2\x80\x99s novels, Ch\xc3\xa9nier\xe2\x80\x99s Greek\r\nverses, Diderot\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence, and Montesquieu\xe2\x80\x99s minor works are as\r\ndaring as the writings of Catullus himself. And the most austere,\r\nsaintly, and laborious of all French authors, Button, would you know\r\nhis maxim of advice in the case of sentimental intrigues? \xe2\x80\x9cLove! why\r\nart thou the happiness of all beings and man\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune? Because only\r\nthe _physical part_ of this passion is good, and the rest is worth\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhence is this? And how comes it that in spite of the ruin of the\r\nancient system of thought, the grand sensuality of the Greeks has\r\nremained like a ray of light upon the foreheads of the highest?\r\n\r\nIt is because sensuality is the mysterious but necessary and creative\r\ncondition of intellectual development. Those who have not felt the\r\nexigencies of the flesh to the uttermost, whether for love or hatred,\r\nare incapable of understanding the full range of the exigencies of the\r\nmind. Just as the beauty of the soul illumines the whole face, in like\r\nmanner virility of the body is an indispensable condition of a fruitful\r\nbrain. The worst insult that Delacroix could address to men, the insult\r\nthat he hurled without distinction against the decriers of Rubens and\r\nthe detractors of Ingres, was the terrible word: eunuchs.\r\n\r\nBut furthermore, it would seem that the genius of peoples, like that of\r\nindividuals, is above all sensual. All the cities that have reigned\r\nover the world, Babylon, Alexandria, Athens, Rome, Venice, Paris, have\r\nby a general law been as licentious as they were powerful, as if their\r\ndissoluteness was necessary to their splendour. The cities where the\r\nlegislator has attempted to implant a narrow, unproductive, and\r\nartificial virtue have seen themselves condemned to utter death from\r\nthe very first day. It was so with Laced\xc3\xa6mon, which, in the centre of\r\nthe most prodigious intellectual development that the human spirit has\r\never witnessed, between Corinth and Alexandria, between Syracuse and\r\nMiletus, has bequeathed us neither a poet, nor a painter, nor a\r\nphilosopher, nor an historian, nor a savant, barely the popular renown\r\nof a sort of Bobillot who got killed in a mountain defile with three\r\nhundred men without even succeeding in gaining the victory. And it is\r\nfor this reason that after two thousand years we are able to gauge the\r\nnothingness of Spartan virtue, and declare, following Renan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexhortation, that we \xe2\x80\x9ccurse the soil that bred this mistress of sombre\r\nerrors, and insult it because it exists no longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShall we see the return of the days of Ephesus and Cyrene? Alas! the\r\nmodern world is succumbing to an invasion of ugliness. Civilization is\r\nmarching to the north, is entering into mist, cold, mud. What night! A\r\npeople clothed in black fills the mean streets. What is it thinking of?\r\nWe know not, but our twenty-five years shiver at being banished to a\r\nland of old men.\r\n\r\nBut let those who will ever regret not to have known that rapturous\r\nyouth of the earth which we call ancient life, be allowed to live\r\nagain, by a fecund illusion, in the days when human nudity, the most\r\nperfect form that we can know and even conceive of, since we believe it\r\nto be in God\xe2\x80\x99s image, could unveil itself under the features of a\r\nsacred courtesan, before the twenty thousand pilgrims who covered the\r\nstrands of Eleusis; when the most sensual love, the divine love of\r\nwhich we are born, was without sin: let them be allowed to forget\r\neighteen barbarous, hypocritical, and hideous centuries.\r\n\r\nLeave the quagmire for the pure spring, piously return to original\r\nbeauty, rebuild the great temple to the sound of enchanted flutes, and\r\nconsecrate with enthusiasm their hearts, ever charmed by the immortal\r\nAphrodite, to the sanctuaries of the true faith.\r\n\r\nPierre Lou\xc3\xbfs.\r\n\r\n\r\nill-001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nCHRYSIS\r\n\r\nShe lay upon her bosom, with her elbows in front of her, her legs wide\r\napart and her cheek resting on her hand, pricking, with a long golden\r\npin, small symmetrical holes in a pillow of green linen.\r\n\r\nLanguid with too much sleep, she had remained alone upon the disordered\r\nbed ever since she had awakened, two hours after mid-day.\r\n\r\nThe great waves of her hair, her only garment, covered one of her\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThis hair was resplendently opaque, soft as fur, longer than a bird\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwing, supple, uncountable, full of life and warmth. It covered half her\r\nback, flowed under her naked belly, glittered under her knees in thick,\r\ncurling clusters. The young woman was enwrapped in this precious\r\nfleece. It glinted with a russet sheen, almost metallic, and had\r\nprocured her the name of Chrysis, given her by the courtesans of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nIt was not the sleek hair of the court-woman from Syria, or the dyed\r\nhair of the Asiatics, or the black and brown hair of the daughters of\r\nEgypt. It was the hair of an Aryan race, the Galil\xc3\xa6ans across the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nChrysis. She loved the name. The young men who came to see her called\r\nher Chryse like Aphrodite, in the verses they laid at her door, with\r\nrose-garlands, in the morning. She did not believe in Aphrodite, but\r\nshe liked to be compared to the goddess, and she went to the temple\r\nsometimes, in order to give her, as to a friend, boxes of perfumes and\r\nblue veils.\r\n\r\nShe was born upon the borders of Lake Gennesaret, in a country of sun\r\nand shade, overgrown by laurel roses. Her mother used to go out in the\r\nevening upon the Jerusalem road, and wait for the travelers and\r\nmerchants. She gave herself to them in the grass, in the midst of the\r\nsilence of the fields. This woman was greatly loved in Galilee. The\r\npriests did not turn aside from her door, for she was charitable and\r\npious. She always paid for the sacrificial lambs, and the blessing of\r\nthe Eternal abode upon her house. Now when she became with child, her\r\npregnancy being a scandal (for she had no husband), a man celebrated\r\nfor his gift of prophecy told her that she would give birth to a maiden\r\nwho should one day carry \xe2\x80\x9cthe riches and faith of a people\xe2\x80\x9d around her\r\nneck. She did not well understand how that might be, but she named the\r\nchild Sarah, that is to say princess in Hebrew. And that closed the\r\nmouth of slander.\r\n\r\nChrysis had always remained in ignorance of this incident, the seer\r\nhaving told her mother how dangerous it is to reveal to people the\r\nprophecies of which they are the object. She knew nothing of her\r\nfuture. That is why she often thought about it. She remembered her\r\nchildhood but little, and did not like to speak about it. The only\r\nvivid sensation she had retained was the fear and disgust caused her by\r\nthe anxious surveillance of her mother, who, on the approach of her\r\ntime for going forth upon the road, shut her up alone in her chamber\r\nfor interminable hours. She also remembered the round window through\r\nwhich she saw the waters of the lake, the blue-tinted fields, the\r\ntransparent sky, the blithe air of Galilee. The house was covered with\r\ntamarisks and rose-coloured flax. Thorny caper-bushes reared their\r\ngreen heads in wild confusion, over-topping the fine mist of the\r\ngrasses. The little girls bathed in a limpid brook, where they found\r\nred shells under the tufts of flowering laurels; and there were flowers\r\nupon the water and flowers over all the mead and great lilies upon the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nShe was twelve years old when she escaped from home to follow a troop\r\nof young horsemen who were on their way to Tyre to sell ivory. She fell\r\nin with them before a cistern. They were adorning their long-tailed\r\nhorses with multi-coloured tufts. She well remembered how she was\r\ncarried off, pale with joy upon their horses, and how they stopped a\r\nsecond time during the night, a night so clear that the stars were\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nNeither had she forgotten how they entered Tyre: she in front, seated\r\nupon the panniers of a pack-horse, holding on to its mane with her\r\nfists, and proudly dangling her naked calves, to show the women of the\r\ntown that she had pure blood coursing in her well-shaped legs. They\r\nleft for Egypt that same evening. She followed the ivory-sellers as far\r\nas the market of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nill-002\r\n\r\n\r\n_Greek harlots from the isles told her the legend of Iphis._\r\n\r\nAnd it was there, in a little white house with a terrace and tapering\r\ncolumns, that they left her two months afterwards, with her bronze\r\nmirror, carpets, new cushions, and a beautiful Hindoo slave who was\r\nlearned in the dressing of courtesans\xe2\x80\x99 hair. Others came on the evening\r\nof their departure, and others on the morrow.\r\n\r\nAs she lived at the extreme east of the town, a quarter disdained by\r\nthe young Greeks of Brouchion, she was long before she made the\r\nacquaintance of aught but travellers and merchants, like her mother.\r\nYet she inspired interminable passions. Caravan-masters were known to\r\nsell their merchandise dirt cheap in order to stay with her, and ruin\r\nthemselves in a few nights. With these men\xe2\x80\x99s fortune she bought jewels,\r\nbed-cushions, rare perfumes, flowered robes, and four slaves.\r\n\r\nShe gained a knowledge of many foreign languages, and knew the tales of\r\nall countries. Assyrians told her the loves of Douzi and Ishtar;\r\nPh\xc5\x93nicians those of Ashtaroth and Adonis. Greek harlots from the isles\r\ntold her the legend of Iphis, and taught her strange caresses which\r\nsurprised her at first, but afterwards enchanted her so much that she\r\ncould not do without them for a whole day. She also knew the loves of\r\nAtalanta, and how, like her, flute-girls, while yet virgins, may tire\r\nout the strongest men. Finally, her Hindoo slave had taught her\r\npatiently, during seven years, the minutest details of the complex and\r\nvoluptuous art of the courtesans of Palibothra.\r\n\r\nFor love is an art, like music. It gives emotions of the same order,\r\nequally delicate, equally thrilling, sometimes perhaps more intense;\r\nand Chrysis, who knew all its rhythms and all its subtilities, regarded\r\nherself, with good reason, as a greater artist than Plango herself. Yet\r\nPlango was a musician of the temple.\r\n\r\nSeven years she lived thus, without dreaming of a life happier or more\r\nvaried. But shortly before her twentieth year, when she emerged from\r\ngirlhood to womanhood and saw the first charming line of nascent\r\nmaturity take form under her breasts, she suddenly conceived other\r\nambitions.\r\n\r\nAnd one morning, waking up two hours after mid-day, languid with too\r\nmuch sleep, she turned over upon her breast, threw out her legs, leaned\r\nher cheek upon her hand, and with a long golden pin, pricked little\r\nsymmetrical holes upon her pillow of green linen.\r\n\r\nHer reflexions were profound.\r\n\r\nFirst it was four little pricks which made a square, with a prick in\r\nthe centre. Then four other pricks to make a bigger square. Then she\r\ntried to make a circle. But it was a little difficult. Then, she\r\npricked away aimlessly and began to call:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDjala! Djala!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDjala was her Hindoo slave, and was called Djalantachtchandratchapala,\r\nwhich means: \xe2\x80\x9cMobile as the image of the moon upon the water.\xe2\x80\x9d Chrysis\r\nwas too lazy to say the whole name.\r\n\r\nThe slave entered and stood near the door, without entirely closing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho came yesterday, Djala?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not look. He was handsome? I think I slept all the time; I\r\nwas tired. I remember nothing at all about it. At what time did he go\r\naway? This morning early?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt sunrise, he said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he leave me? Is it much? No, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same\r\nto me. What did he say? Has no one been since? Will he come back again?\r\nGive me my bracelets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slave brought a casket, but Chrysis did not look at it, and,\r\nraising her arm as high as she could:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Djala,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cah! Djala! I long for extraordinary\r\nadventures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Djala, \xe2\x80\x9cor nought. The days\r\nresemble one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. Formerly it was not like that. In all the countries of the\r\nworld gods came down to earth and loved mortal women. Ah! on what beds\r\nawait them, in what forest search for them that are a little more than\r\nmen? What prayers shall I put up for the coming of them that will teach\r\nme something new or oblivion of all things? And if the gods will no\r\nlonger come down, if they are dead or too old, Djala, shall I too die\r\nwithout seeing a man capable of putting tragic events into my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned over upon her back and interlocked her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf somebody adored me, I think it would give me such joy to make him\r\nsuffer till he died. Those who come here are not worthy to weep. And\r\nthen, it is my fault as well: it is I who summon them; how should they\r\nlove me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat bracelet to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall put them all on. But leave me. I need no one. Go to the steps\r\nbefore the door, and if anyone comes, say that I am with my lover, a\r\nblack slave whom I pay. Go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not going out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall go out alone. I shall dress myself alone. I shall not\r\nreturn. Off with you! Off with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe let one leg drop upon the carpet and stretched herself into a\r\nstanding posture. Djala had gone away noiselessly.\r\n\r\nShe walked very slowly about the room, with her hands crossed behind\r\nher neck, entirely absorbed in the luxury of cooling the sweat of her\r\nnaked feet by stepping about on the tiles. Then she entered her bath.\r\n\r\nIt was a delight to her to look at herself through the water. She saw\r\nherself like a great pearl-shell lying open on a rock. Her skin became\r\nsmooth and perfect; the lines of her legs tapered away into blue light;\r\nher whole form was more supple; her hands were transfigured. The\r\nlightness of her body was such that she raised herself on two fingers\r\nand allowed herself to float for a little and fall gently back on the\r\nmarble, causing the water to ripple softly against her chin. The water\r\nentered her ears with the provocation of a kiss.\r\n\r\nIt was when taking her bath that Chrysis began to adore herself. Every\r\npart of her body became separately the object of tender admiration and\r\nthe motive of a caress. She played a thousand charming pranks with her\r\nhair and her breasts. Sometimes, even, she accorded a more direct\r\nsatisfaction to her perpetual desires, and no place of repose seemed to\r\nher more propitious for the minute slowness of this delicate solace.\r\n\r\nThe day was waning. She sat up in the piscina, stepped out of the\r\nwater, and walked to the door. Her foot-marks shone upon the stones.\r\nTottering, and as if exhausted, she opened the door wide and stopped,\r\nholding the latch at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length; then entered, and, standing upright\r\nnear her bed, and dripping with water, said to the slave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Malabar woman took a large sponge and passed it over Chrysis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngolden hair, which, being heavily charged with water, dripped streams\r\ndown her back. She dried it, smoothed it out, waved it gently to and\r\nfro, and, dipping the sponge into a jar of oil, she caressed her\r\nmistress with it even to the neck. She then rubbed her down with a\r\nrough towel which brought the colour to her supple skin.\r\n\r\nChrysis sank quivering into the coolness of a marble chair and\r\nmurmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDress my hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the level rays of evening her hair, still heavy and humid, shone\r\nlike rain illuminated by the sun: The slave took it in handfuls and\r\nentwined it. She rolled it into a spiral and picked it out with slim\r\ngolden pins, like a great metal serpent bristling with arrows. She\r\nwound the whole around a triple fillet of green in order that its\r\nreflections might be heightened by the silk.\r\n\r\nChrysis held a mirror of polished copper at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length. She watched\r\nthe slave\xe2\x80\x99s darting hands with a distracted eye, as she passed them\r\nthrough the heavy hair, rounded off the clusters, captured the stray\r\nlocks, and built up her head-dress like a spiral rhytium of clay. When\r\nall was finished, Djala knelt down on her knees before her mistress and\r\nshaved her rounded flesh to the skin, in order that she might have the\r\nnudity of a statue in her lovers\xe2\x80\x99 eyes.\r\n\r\nill-003\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysis became graver and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaint me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little pink box from the island of Dioscoris contained cosmetics of\r\nall colours. With a camel-hair brush, the slave took a little of a\r\ncertain black paste which she laid upon the long curves of the\r\nbeautiful eye-lashes, in order to heighten the blueness of the eyes.\r\nTwo firm lines put on with a pencil imparted increased length and\r\nsoftness to them; a bluish powder tinted the eye-lids the colour of\r\nlead; two touches of bright vermilion accentuated the tear-corners. In\r\norder to fix the cosmetics, it was necessary to anoint the face and\r\nbreast with fresh cerate. With a soft feather dipped in ceruse, Djala\r\npainted trails of white along the arms and on the neck; with a little\r\nbrush swollen with carmine she reddened the mouth and touched up the\r\nnipples of the breasts; with her fingers she spread a fine layer of red\r\npowder over the cheeks, marked three deep lines between the waist and\r\nthe belly, and in the rounded haunches two dimples that sometimes\r\nmoved; then with a plug of leather dipped in cosmetics she gave a\r\nindefinable tint to the elbows and polished up the ten nails. The\r\ntoilette was finished.\r\n\r\nThe Chrysis began to smile, and said to the Hindoo woman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat erect in her marble chair. Her pins gleamed with a golden glint\r\nbehind her head. Her painted finger-nails, pressed to her neck from\r\nshoulder to shoulder, broke the red line of her necklace, and her white\r\nfeet rested close together upon the stone.\r\n\r\nHuddled against the wall, Djala bethought her of the love-songs of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sang in a monotonous chant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis, thy hair is like a swarm of bees hanging on a tree. The hot\r\nwind of the south penetrates it with the dew of love-battles and the\r\nwet perfume of night-flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young woman alternated, in a softer, lower voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy hair is like an endless river in the plain when the flame-lit\r\nevening fades.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they sang, one after the other:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThine eyes are like blue water-lilies without stalks, motionless upon\r\nthe pools.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine eyes rest in the shadow of my lashes like deep lakes under dark\r\nbranches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy lips are two delicate flowers stained with the blood of a roe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy lips are the edges of a burning wound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy tongue is the bloody dagger that has made the wound of thy mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy tongue is inlaid with precious stones. It is red with the sheen of\r\nmy lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThine arms are tapering as two ivory tusks, and thy armpits are two\r\nmouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine arms are tapering as two lily-stalks and my fingers hang\r\ntherefrom like five petals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy thighs are two white elephants\xe2\x80\x99 trunks. They bear thy feet like\r\ntwo red flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy feet are two nenuphar-leaves upon the water: My thighs are two\r\nbursting nenuphar buds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy breasts are two silver bucklers with cusps steeped in blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy breasts are the moon and the reflection of the moon and the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-004\r\n\r\n\r\n_Huddled against the wall, Djala bethought herself of the love-songs of\r\nIndia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy navel is a deep pit in a desert of red sand, and thy belly a young\r\nkid lying on its mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy navel is a round pearl on an inverted cup, and the curve of my\r\nbelly is the clear crescent of Ph\xc5\x93be in the forests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. The slave raised her hands and bowed to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe courtesan proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like a purple flower, full of perfumes and honey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like a sea-serpent, soft and living, open at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the humid grotto, the ever-warm lodging, the Refuge where man\r\nreposes from his march to death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prostrate one murmured very low: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is appalling. It is the face\r\nof Medusa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysis planted her foot upon the slave\xe2\x80\x99s neck and said with trembling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDjala.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night had come on little by little, but the moon was so luminous\r\nthat the room was filled with blue light.\r\n\r\nChrysis looked at the motionless reflections of her naked body where\r\nthe shadows fell very black.\r\n\r\nShe rose brusquely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDjala, what are we thinking of? It is night, and I have not yet gone\r\nout. There will be nothing left upon the heptastadion but sleeping\r\nsailors. Tell me, Djala, I am beautiful?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, Djala, I am more beautiful than ever to-night? I am the most\r\nbeautiful of the Alexandrian women, and you know it? Will not he who\r\nshall presently pass within the sidelong glance of my eyes follow me\r\nlike a dog? Shall I not perform my pleasure upon him, and make a slave\r\nof him according to my whim, and can I not expect the most abject\r\nobedience from the first man whom I shall meet? Dress me, Djala.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDjala twined two silver serpents about her arms. On her feet she fixed\r\nsandals and attached them to her brown legs with crossed leather\r\nstraps. Over her warm belly Chrysis herself buckled a maiden\xe2\x80\x99s girdle,\r\nwhich sloped down from the upper part of the loins along the hollow\r\nline of the groins; in her ears she hung great circular rings, on her\r\nneck three golden phallus-bracelets enchased at Paphos by the\r\nhierodules. She contemplated herself for some time, standing naked in\r\nher jewels; then, drawing from the coffer in which she had folded it, a\r\nvast transparent stuff of yellow linen, she twisted it about her and\r\ndraped herself in it to the ground. Diagonal folds intersected the\r\nlittle that one saw of her body through the light tissue; one of her\r\nelbows stood out under the light tunic, and the other arm, which she\r\nhad left bare, carried the long train high out of reach of the dust.\r\n\r\nShe took her feather fan in her hand, and carelessly sauntered forth.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the steps of the threshold, with her hand leaning on the\r\nwhite wall, Djala watched the courtesan\xe2\x80\x99s retreating form.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly past the houses, in the deserted street bathed in\r\nmoonlight. A little flickering shadow danced behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE QUAY AT ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\nOn the quay at Alexandria a singing-girl was standing singing. By her\r\nside were two flute-girls, seated on the white parapet.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe satyrs pursue in the woods\r\n    The light-footed oreads.\r\nThey chase the nymphs upon the mountains,\r\n    They fill their eyes with affright,\r\nThey seize their hair in the wind,\r\n    They grasp their breasts in the chase,\r\nAnd throw their warm bodies backwards\r\n    Upon the green dew-covered moss,\r\nAnd the beautiful bodies, their beautiful bodies half divine,\r\n    Writhe with the agony . . .\r\nO women! Eros makes your lips cry aloud\r\n    With dolorous, sweet Desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flute-players repeated\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEros\r\nEros!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nand wailed in their twin reeds.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCybele pursues across the plain\r\n    Attys, beautiful as Apollo.\r\nEros has smitten her to the heart, and for him,\r\n    O Totoi! but not him for her,\r\nInstead of love, cruel god, wicked Eros,\r\n    Thou counsellest but hatred . . .\r\nAcross the meads, the vast distant plains,\r\n    Cybele chases Attys;\r\nAnd because she adores the scorned,\r\n    She infuses into his veins\r\nThe great cold breath, the breath of death.\r\n    O dolorous, sweet Desire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEros!\r\nEros!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShrill wailings poured from the flutes.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Goat-foot pursues to the river\r\n    Syrinx, the daughter of the fountain;\r\nPale Eros, that loves the taste of tears,\r\n    Kissed her as she ran, cheek to cheek;\r\nAnd the frail shadow of the drowned maiden\r\n    Shivers, reeds, upon the waters.\r\nBut Eros kings it over the world and the gods.\r\n    He kings it over death itself.\r\nOn the watery tomb he gathered for us\r\n    All the reeds, and with them made the flute,\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis a dead soul that weeps here, women,\r\n    Dolorous, sweet Desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the flute prolonged the slow chant of the last line, the singer\r\nheld out her hand to the passers-by standing around her in a circle,\r\nand collected four obols, which she slipped into her shoe.\r\n\r\nill-005\r\n\r\n\r\n_Groups formed in places, and women wandered amongst them_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crowd gradually melted away, innumerable, curious of itself and\r\nwatching its own movements. The noise of footsteps and voices drowned\r\neven the sound of the sea. Sailors hauled their boats upon the quay\r\nwith bowed shoulders. Fruit-sellers passed to and fro with teeming\r\nbaskets upon their arms. Beggars begged for alms with trembling hand.\r\nAsses, laden with leathern bottles, trotted in front of the goads of\r\ntheir drivers. But it was the hour of sunset; and the crowd of idlers,\r\nmore numerous than the crowd bent on affairs, covered the quay. Groups\r\nformed in places, and women wandered amongst them. The names of\r\nwell-known characters passed from mouth to mouth. The young men looked\r\nat the philosophers, and the philosophers looked at the courtesans.\r\n\r\nThe latter were of every kind and condition, from the most celebrated,\r\ndressed in fine silks and wearing shoes of gilded leather, to the most\r\nmiserable, who walked barefooted. The poor ones were no less beautiful\r\nthan the others, but less fortunate only, and the attention of the\r\nsages was fixed by preference upon those whose natural grace was not\r\ndisfigured by the artifice of girdles and weighty jewels. As it was the\r\nday before the Aphrodisi\xc3\xa6, these women had every license to choose the\r\ndress which suited them the best, and some of the youngest had even\r\nventured to wear nothing at all. But their nudity shocked nobody, for\r\nthey would not thus have exposed all the details of their bodies to the\r\nsun if they had possessed the slightest defect which might have\r\nrendered them the laughing-stock of the married women.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTryphera! Tryphera!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a young courtesan of joyful mien elbowed her way through the crowd\r\nto join a friend of whom she had just caught sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTryphera! are you invited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, Seso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. She is giving a dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dinner? A banquet, my dear. She is to liberate her most beautiful\r\nslave, Aphrodisia, on the second day of the feast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last! She has perceived at last that people came to see her only\r\nfor the sake of her slave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she has seen nothing. It is a whim of old Cheres, the\r\nship-owner on the quay. He wanted to buy the girl for ten min\xc3\xa6. Bacchis\r\nrefused. Twenty min\xc3\xa6; she refused again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, pray? It was her ambition to have a freed-woman. Besides, she was\r\nquite right to bargain. Cheres will give thirty-five min\xc3\xa6, and at that\r\nprice the girl becomes a freed-woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-five min\xc3\xa6? Three thousand five hundred drachm\xc3\xa6? Three thousand\r\nfive hundred drachm\xc3\xa6 for a negress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a white man\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut her mother is black.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBacchis declared that she would not part with her for less, and old\r\nCheres is so amorous that he consented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he is invited at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Aphrodisia is to be served up at the banquet as the last dish,\r\nafter the fruit. Everybody will taste of it at pleasure, and it is only\r\non the morrow that she is to be handed over to Cheres; but I am much\r\nafraid she will be tired . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pity her. With him she will have time to recover. I know him,\r\nSeso. I have watched him sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laughed together at Cheres. Then they complimented one another.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a pretty robe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seso. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you have it trimmed at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-006\r\n\r\n\r\nTryphera\xe2\x80\x99s robe was of fine sea-green stuff entirely trimmed with\r\nflowering iris. A carbuncle set in gold gathered it up into a\r\nspindle-shaped pleat over the left shoulder; the robe fell slantingly\r\nbetween the two breasts, leaving the entire right side of her body\r\nnaked down to the metal girdle; a narrow slit, that opened and closed\r\nat every step, alone revealed the whiteness of the leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeso!\xe2\x80\x9d said another voice. \xe2\x80\x9cSeso and Tryphera, come with me if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. I am going to the Ceramic Wall to see whether my\r\nname is written up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMousarion! Where have you come from, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Pharos. There is nobody there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? There is nothing to do but fish, it is so full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo turbots for me. I am off to the wall. Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the way, Seso told them about the projected banquet at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mousarion. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember the last dinner,\r\nTryphera, and all the stories about Chrysis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not repeat them. Seso is her friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMousarion bit her lips; but Seso had already taken the alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they say about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! various ill-natured things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet people talk,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Seso. \xe2\x80\x9cWe three together are not worth\r\nChrysis. The day she decides to leave her quarter and shew herself at\r\nBrouchion, I know of some of our lovers whom we shall never see again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I would commit any folly for that woman. Be sure that there\r\nis none here more beautiful than she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three girls had now arrived in front of the Ceramic Wall.\r\nInscriptions written in black succeeded one another along the whole\r\nlength of its immense white surface. When a lover desired to present\r\nhimself to a courtesan, he had merely to write up their two names, with\r\nthe price he offered; if the man and the money were approved of, the\r\nwoman remained standing under the notice until the lover re-appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Seso,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tryphera, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the practical joker who has written that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they read in huge letters:\r\n\r\nBACCHIS\r\nTHERSIES\r\n2 OBOLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ought not to be allowed to make fun of the women like that. If I\r\nwere the rhymarch, I should already have held an enquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut further on, Seso stopped before an inscription more to the point:\r\n\r\nSESO OF CNIDOS\r\nTIMON THE SON OF LYSIAS\r\n1 MINA\r\n\r\n\r\nShe turned slightly pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAnd she leaned her back against the wall under the envious glances of\r\nthe women that passed by.\r\n\r\nA few steps further on Mousarion found an acceptable offer, if not as\r\ngenerous an one. Tryphera returned to the quay alone.\r\n\r\nAs the hour was advanced, the crowd had become less compact. But the\r\nthree musicians were still singing and playing the flute.\r\n\r\nCatching sight of a stranger whose clothes and rotundity were slightly\r\nridiculous, Tryphera tapped him on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say! Papa! I wager that you are not an Alexandrian, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the honest fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have guessed\r\nrightly. I am quite astounded at the town and the people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are from Boubastis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. From Cabasa. I came here to sell grain, and I am going back again\r\nto-morrow, richer by fifty-two min\xc3\xa6. Thanks be to the gods! it has been\r\na good year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTryphera suddenly began to take an great interest in this merchant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed timidly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can give me a great joy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to return to Cabasa to-morrow without being able to tell my wife\r\nand three daughters that I have seen some celebrated men, You probably\r\nknow some celebrated men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome few,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Name them to me when they pass. I am sure that during the last\r\ntwo days I have met the most influential functionaries. I am in despair\r\nat not knowing them by sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-007\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have your wish. This is Naucrates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Naucrates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA philosopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does he teach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Zeus, that is a doctrine that does not require much genius, and\r\nthis philosopher does not please me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Phrasilas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Phrasilas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you mention him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause others consider him to be eminent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe says everything with a smile, and that enables him to pass off his\r\nerrors as international and common-places as subtile. He has all the\r\nadvantage. People have allowed themselves to be duped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is beyond me, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand. Besides, the face\r\nof this Phrasilas is marked by hypocrisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Philodemos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe strategist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. A Latin poet who writes in Greek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, he is an enemy. I am sorry to have seen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point a flutter of excitement ran through the crowd and a\r\nmurmur of voices pronounced the same name:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios . . . Demetrios . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTryphera mounted upon a street post, and she too said to the merchant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios . . . That is Demetrios. You were anxious to see celebrated\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-008\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tryphera mounted upon a street post._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios? the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s lover? Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are in luck. He never leaves his house. This is the first\r\ntime I have seen him on the quay since I have been at Alexandria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s he, bending over to look at the harbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two men leaning over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the one in blue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot see him very well. His back is turned to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow you not? he is the sculptor to whom the queen offered herself for\r\na model when he carved the Aphrodite in the temple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say he is the royal lover. They say he is the master of Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he is as beautiful as Apollo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! he has turned round. I am very glad that I came. I shall say that\r\nI have seen him. I have heard so much about him. It seems that no woman\r\nhas ever resisted him. He has had many love adventures, has he not? How\r\nis it that the queen has not heard of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe queen knows of them as well as we do. She loves him too much to\r\nspeak of them. She is afraid of his returning to Rhodes, to his master,\r\nPherecrates. He is as powerful as she is, and it is she who desired\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not look happy. Why does he look so sad? I think I should be\r\nhappy if I were in his place. I should like to be he, were it only for\r\nan evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sun had set. The women gazed at this man, their common dream. He,\r\nwithout appearing to be conscious of the stir he created, remained\r\nleaning over the parapet, listening to the flute-girls.\r\n\r\nThe little musicians made another collection; then, they softly threw\r\ntheir light flutes over their backs. The singing-girl placed her arms\r\nround their necks and all three returned to the town.\r\n\r\nAt night-fall, the other women went back into immense Alexandria in\r\nlittle groups, and the herd of men followed them; but all turned round\r\nas they walked, and looked at Demetrios.\r\n\r\nThe last girl who passed softly cast her yellow flowers at him, and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nNight fell upon the quays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nDEMETRIOS\r\n\r\nDemetrios remained alone, leaning on his elbow, at the spot vacated by\r\nthe flute-girls. He listened to the murmur of the sea, to the slow\r\ncreaking of the ships, to the wind passing beneath the stars.\r\n\r\nThe town was illumined by a dazzling little cloud which lingered upon\r\nthe moon, and the sky was bathed in soft light.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked around him. The flute-girls\xe2\x80\x99 tunics had left two\r\nmarks in the dust. He remembered their faces: they were two Ephesians.\r\nHe had thought the elder one pretty; but the younger was without charm,\r\nand, as ugliness was a torture to him, he avoided thinking about her.\r\n\r\nAn ivory object gleamed at his feet. He picked it up: it was a\r\nwriting-tablet, with a silver style attached to it. The wax was almost\r\nworn away and it had been necessary to go over the words several times\r\nin order to make them legible. They were even scratched into the ivory.\r\n\r\nThere were only these words:\r\n\r\nMyrtis Loves Rhodocleia\r\n\r\n\r\nand he did not know to which of the two women this belonged, and\r\nwhether the other was the loved one, or whether it was some unknown\r\ngirl left behind in Ephesos. Then he thought for a moment of overtaking\r\nthe two musicians in order to restore them what was perhaps the\r\nsouvenir of a cherished dead friend; but he could not have found them\r\nwithout difficulty, and as he was already beginning to lose interest in\r\nthem, he turned round languidly and threw the little object into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nIt fell rapidly, with a gliding motion like a white bird, and he heard\r\nthe splash it made away out in the black water. This little noise\r\nenhanced the immense silence of the harbour. Leaning against the cold\r\nparapet, he tried to drive away all thought, and began to look at the\r\nthings around him.\r\n\r\nHe had a horror of life. He only left his house when the life of the\r\nday was dying down, and he returned home when the dawn began to draw\r\nthe fishermen and market-gardeners to the town. The pleasure of seeing\r\nnought in the world but the ghost of the town and his own stature had\r\nbecome a voluptuous passion with him, and he did not remember having\r\nseen the mid-day sun for months.\r\n\r\nHe was wearied. The queen was tedious.\r\n\r\nHe could hardly understand, that night, the joy and pride that had\r\npossessed him three years before, when the queen, bewitched perhaps by\r\nthe stories of his beauty and genius, had sent for him to the palace,\r\nand had heralded him to the Evening Gate with the sound of the silver\r\nsalpinx.\r\n\r\nHis arrival at the palace sometimes lighted up his memory with one of\r\nthose souvenirs which, through excess of sweetness, become gradually\r\nembittered in the soul and then intolerable . . . The queen had\r\nreceived him alone, in her private apartments, consisting of three\r\nrooms of incomparable luxury, where every sound was muffled by\r\ncushions. She lay upon her left side, embedded, at it were, in a litter\r\nof greenish silks which, by reflection, bathed the black locks of her\r\nhair in purple. Her youthful body was arrayed in a daring open-worked\r\ncostume which she had had made before her eyes by a Phrygian courtesan,\r\nand which exposed the twenty-two places where caresses are\r\nirresistible. One had no need to take off that costume during a whole\r\nnight, even though one exhausted one\xe2\x80\x99s amorous imagination beyond the\r\nmost extravagant dreams.\r\n\r\nDemetrios fell respectfully on his knees, and took Queen Berenice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnaked little foot in his hand, in order to kiss it, as one kisses an\r\nobject delicate and rare.\r\n\r\nThen she rose.\r\n\r\nSimply, like a beautiful slave posing, she undid her corselet, her\r\nbandelettes, her open drawers, took off the very bracelets from her\r\narms, the rings from her ankles, and stood up erect, with her hands\r\nopen before her shoulders, her head slightly thrown back, and her coral\r\ncoif trembling upon her cheeks.\r\n\r\nShe was the daughter of a Ptolemy and a Syrian princess descended from\r\nall the gods, through Astarte, whom the Greeks call Aphrodite.\r\nDemetrios knew this, and that she was proud of her Olympian lineage.\r\nAccordingly he was not disconcerted when the queen said to him without\r\nmoving: \xe2\x80\x9cI am Astarte. Take a block of marble and your chisel and\r\nreveal me to the men of Egypt. I desire them to worship my image.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-009\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI am Astarte. Take a block of marble and your chisel and\r\nreveal me to the men of Egypt. I desire them to worship my image.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios looked at her, and divined, unerringly, the artless, novel\r\nsensuality with which this young girl\xe2\x80\x99s body was animated. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam the first to worship it,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took her in his arms. The queen was\r\nnot angry at this brusquerie, but stepped back a pace and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nthink yourself Adonis, that you dare to lay hands on the goddess?\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at him, smiled a little, and concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus was why he became insupportable, and his best friends left him;\r\nbut he ravished the hearts of all women.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered one of the apartments of the palace, the women of the\r\ncourt ceased talking, and the other women listened to him too, for the\r\nsound of his voice was an ecstasy. If he took refuge with the queen,\r\ntheir persecution followed him even there, under pretexts ever new. Did\r\nhe wander through the streets, the folds of his tunic became filled\r\nwith little papyri on which the women wrote their names with words of\r\nanguish. But he crumpled them up without reading them. He was tired of\r\nall that. When his handiwork was set up in the temple of Aphrodite, the\r\nsacred enclosure was invaded at every hour of the night by the crowd of\r\nhis feminine adorers, who came to read his name chiselled in the stone\r\nand offer a wealth of doves and roses to their living god.\r\n\r\nHis house was soon encumbered with gifts, which he accepted at first\r\nout of negligence, but ended by refusing all, when he understood what\r\nwas desired of him, and that he was being treated like a prostitute.\r\nHis very slave-women offered themselves. He had them whipped, and sold\r\nthem to the little porneion at Rhacotis. Then his men-slaves, seduced\r\nby presents, opened his door to unknown women whom he found at his\r\nbed-side when he came home, and whose attitude left no doubt as to\r\ntheir passionate intentions. The trinkets of his toilet-table\r\ndisappeared one after the other; more than one of the women of the town\r\nhad a sandal or a belt of his, a cup from which he had drunk, even the\r\nstones of the fruit he had eaten. If he dropped a flower as he walked,\r\nhe did not find it again. The women would have picked up the very dust\r\nupon which his shoes had trampled.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact that this persecution was becoming dangerous\r\nand threatened to kill all his sensibility, he had reached the stage of\r\nmanhood at which a thinking man perceives the urgency of dividing his\r\nlife into two parts, and of ceasing to confound the things of the\r\nintellect with the exigencies of the senses. The statue of Aphrodite\r\nwas for him the sublime pretext of this moral conversion. The highest\r\nrealization of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, all the idealism it was possible to\r\nread into the supple lines of her body, Demetrios had evoked it all\r\nfrom the marble, and from that day onward he imagined that no other\r\nwoman on earth would ever attain to the level of his dream. His statue\r\nbecame the object of his passion. He adored it only, and madly divorced\r\nfrom the flesh the supreme idea of the goddess, all the more immaterial\r\nbecause he had attached it to life.\r\n\r\nWhen he again saw the queen herself, she seemed to him destitute of\r\neverything which had constituted her charm. She served for a certain\r\ntime to hoodwink his aimless desires, but she was at once too different\r\nfrom the Other, and too like her. When she sank down in exhaustion\r\nafter his embraces, and incontinently went to sleep, he looked at her\r\nas if she were an intruder who had adopted the semblance of the beloved\r\none and usurped her place in his bed. The arms of the Other were more\r\nslender, her breast more finely cut, her hips narrower than those of\r\nthe Real one. The latter did not possess the three furrows of the\r\ngroins, thin as lines, that he had graved upon the marble. He finally\r\nwearied of her.\r\n\r\nHis feminine adorers were aware of it, and though he continued his\r\ndaily visits it was known that he ceased to be amorous of Berenice. And\r\nthe enthusiasm on his account doubled. He paid no attention to it. In\r\npoint of fact, he had need of a change of quite other importance.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that in the interval between two mistresses a man is\r\ntempted and satisfied by vulgar dissipation. Demetrios succumbed to it.\r\nWhen the necessity of going to the palace was more distasteful to him\r\nthan usual, he went off at night to the garden of the sacred\r\ncourtesans. This garden surrounded the temple on every side.\r\n\r\nThe women who frequented it did not know him. Moreover, they were so\r\nwearied by the superfluity of their loves that they had neither\r\nexclamations nor tears, and the satisfaction he was in search of was\r\nnot dashed, in that quarter at least, by those frenzied cat-cries with\r\nwhich the queen exasperated him.\r\n\r\nHis conversation with these fair, self-possessed ladies was idle and\r\nunaffected. The day\xe2\x80\x99s visitors, the probable weather on the morrow, the\r\nsoftness of the grass, the mildness of the night\xe2\x80\x94these were the\r\ncharming topics. They did not beg him to express his theories in\r\nstatuary, and they did not give their opinion upon the Achilleus of\r\nScopas. If it befell that they dismissed the lover who had chosen them,\r\nand that they thought him handsome and told him so, he was quite at\r\nliberty not to believe in their disinterestedness.\r\n\r\nWhen freed from the embrace of their religious arms, he mounted the\r\ntemple steps and fell to an ecstatic contemplation of the statue.\r\n\r\nBetween the slim columns crowned with Ionian volutes, the goddess stood\r\ninstinct with life upon a pedestal of rose-coloured stone laden with\r\nrich votive offerings. She was naked and fully sexed, tinted vaguely\r\nand like a woman. In one hand she held her mirror, the handle of which\r\nwas a priapus, and with the other she adorned her beauty with a pearl\r\nnecklace of seven strings. A pearl larger than the others, long and\r\nsilvery, gleamed between her two breasts, like the moon\xe2\x80\x99s crescent\r\nbetween two round clouds.\r\n\r\nDemetrios contemplated her tenderly, and would fain have believed, like\r\nthe common people, that they were real sacred pearls, born of the drops\r\nof water which had rolled in the shell of Anadyomene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO divine sister!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say. \xe2\x80\x9cO flowered one! O transfigured one!\r\nYou are no longer the little Asiatic woman whom I made your unworthy\r\nmodel. You are her immortal Idea, the terrestrial soul of Astarte, the\r\nmother of her race. You shone in her blazing eyes, you burned in her\r\nsombre lips, you swooned in her soft hands, you gaped in her great\r\nbreasts, you strained in entwining legs, long ago, before your birth;\r\nand the food which the daughter of a sinner hungers for is your tyrant\r\nalso, you, a goddess, the mother of gods and men, the joy and anguish\r\nof the world. But I have seen you, evolved you, caught you, O marvelous\r\nCytherea! It is not to your image, it is to yourself that I have given\r\nyour mirror, and yourself that I have covered with pearls, as on the\r\nday when you were born of the fiery heaven and the laughing foam of the\r\nsea, like the dew-steeped dawn, and escorted with acclamations by blue\r\ntritons to the shores of Cyprus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had been adoring her after this fashion when he entered the quay, at\r\nthe hour when the crowd was melting away, and he heard the anguish and\r\ntears of the flute-girls\xe2\x80\x99 chant.\r\n\r\nill-010\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he had spurned the courtesans of the temple that evening, because a\r\nglimpse of a couple beneath the branches had stirred him with disgust\r\nand revolted him to the soul.\r\n\r\nThe kindly influence of the night penetrated him little by little. He\r\nturned his face of the wind, the wind that had passed over the sea and\r\nseemed to carry to Egypt the lingering scent of the sweet-smelling\r\nroses of Amathus.\r\n\r\nBeautiful feminine forms took shape in his brain. He had been asked for\r\na group of the three Charites, enclasping one another, for the garden\r\nof the goddess, but it was distasteful to his youthful genius to copy\r\nconventions, and he dreamed of bringing together on the same block of\r\nmarble the three graceful motions of woman. Two of the Charites were to\r\nbe dressed, one holding a fan and half closing her eyelids to the\r\ngently-swaying feathers; the other dancing in the folds of her robe.\r\nThe third should be standing naked behind her sisters, and, with her\r\nuplifted arms, would be twisting the thick mass of her hair upon her\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nHis mind conceived still other projects, as, for example, to erect,\r\nupon the rocks of Pharos, an Andromeda of black marble confronting the\r\ntumultuous monster of the sea, or to enclose the agora of Brouchion\r\nbetween the four horses of the rising sun, like wrathful Pegasi; and\r\nwhat was not his exultant rapture at the idea, which began to germinate\r\nwithin him, of a Zagreus terror-stricken by the approaching Titans? Ah!\r\nhow beauty had once more taken him for its own! how he was escaping\r\nfrom the clutches of love! how he was separating from the flesh the\r\nsupreme idea of the goddess! In a word, how free he felt!\r\n\r\nNow, he turned his head towards the quays, and, in the distance, saw\r\nthe yellow shimmer of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE PASSER-BY\r\n\r\nShe carried slowly along the deserted quay, which was bathed in\r\nmoonlight. Her head leaned over one shoulder. A little shadow danced\r\nand flickered before her footsteps.\r\n\r\nDemetrios watched her as she drew near.\r\n\r\nDiagonal folds intersected the little one saw of her body through the\r\nthin tissue; one of her elbows stood out in relief under the tight\r\ntunic, and the other arm, which she had left bare, carried the long\r\ntrain, holding it high out of the dust.\r\n\r\nHe recognised by her jewels that she was a courtesan. In order to avoid\r\nher salutation he crossed the road rapidly.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to look at her. He obstinately centered his thoughts\r\nupon the rough plan of his Zagreus. Nevertheless his eyes turned in the\r\ndirection of the passer-by.\r\n\r\nThen he saw that she did not stop, that she paid no attention to him,\r\nthat she did not even affect to look at the sea, or to raise the front\r\nof her veil, or to absorb herself in her reflections; but that she was\r\nmerely taking a walk by herself and was in search of nothing but the\r\nfreshness of the breeze, solitude, abandonment, the subtle thrill of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nDemetrios did not take his eyes off her, and fell into a singular\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\nShe continued to walk like a yellow shadow in the distance, nonchalant,\r\nand preceded by the little black shadow.\r\n\r\nHe heard at each step the slight creak of her shoe in the dust.\r\n\r\nShe walked on as far as the island of Pharos and went up into the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, and as if he had loved this unknown woman for a long time,\r\nDemetrios ran after her, then stopped, retraced his steps, trembled,\r\ngot angry with himself, tried to leave the quay; but he had never\r\nutilised his will except in the service of his pleasure, and when it\r\nwas time to set it in motion for the salvation of his character and the\r\nordering of his life, he felt completely powerless and nailed to the\r\nspot on which he stood.\r\n\r\nAs he could not throw off the thought of this woman, he tried to find\r\nexcuses in his own eyes for the preoccupation which was so violently\r\ndistracting him. He imagined that his admiration for the graceful\r\napparition was due to a purely \xc3\xa6sthetic sentiment, and he said to\r\nhimself that she would make a perfect model for the Charis with the fan\r\nwhich he intended to design on the morrow.\r\n\r\nill-011\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, all his thoughts became confused, and a crowd of\r\nanxious questions surged up into his mind about this woman in yellow.\r\n\r\nWhat was she doing in the island at this hour of the night? Why, for\r\nwhom had she left home so late? Why had she not addressed him? She had\r\nseen him, certainly she had seen him while he was crossing the quay.\r\nWhy had she gone her way without a word of salutation? It was rumoured\r\nthat certain women sometimes chose the fresh hours before the dawn to\r\nbathe in the sea. But there was no bathing at Pharos. The sea was too\r\ndeep. Besides, how unlikely that a woman would be covered with all\r\nthose jewels for no other object than to go bathing! Then what took her\r\nso far from Rhacotis? A rendezvous perhaps? Some young rake, avid of\r\nvariety, who had chosen for a temporary bed the great rocks polished by\r\nthe waves?\r\n\r\nDemetrios wished to be certain. But the young woman was already\r\nreturning, with the same calm and indolent step. The sluggish radiance\r\nof the moon shone full upon her face as she advanced, brushing the dust\r\nof the parapet with the end of her fan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE MIRROR, THE COMB, AND THE NECKLACE\r\n\r\nShe had a special beauty of her own. Her hair seemed two masses of\r\ngold, but it was too abundant, and it padded her low forehead with two\r\nheavy waves charged with amber, which swallowed up the ears and twisted\r\nthemselves into a seven-fold coil upon the nape of the neck. The nose\r\nwas delicate, with expressive nostrils which palpitated sometimes,\r\nsurmounting a thick and painted mouth, with rounded mobile corners. The\r\nsupple line of the body undulated at every stop, receiving animation\r\nfrom the harmonious motion of her unfettered breasts, or from the swing\r\nof the beautiful hips that supported her lissom waist.\r\n\r\nWhen she was within ten paces of the young man, she turned her eyes\r\nupon him. Demetrios was seized with trembling. They were extraordinary\r\neyes; blue, but deep and brilliant at the same time, humid, weary,\r\nbathed in tears and flashing fire, almost closed under the weight of\r\nthe eyelids and eyelashes. The glance of these eyes was like the\r\nsiren\xe2\x80\x99s song. Whosoever crossed their path was inevitably a captive.\r\nShe knew it well, and cunningly she used their virtue; but she counted\r\nstill more upon affected indifference as a weapon of attack against the\r\nman whom so much sincere love had been incapable of touching deeply.\r\n\r\nThe navigators who have sailed over the purple seas, beyond the Ganges,\r\nrelate that they have seen, beneath the water, rocks of magnetic stone.\r\nWhen ships pass near them, the nails and iron fittings are wrenched\r\ndown to the submarine cliff and remain fixed to it for ever. And what\r\nwas once a swift craft, a habitation, a living being, becomes nought\r\nbut a flotsam of planks, scattered by the winds, tossed by the waves.\r\nThus did Demetrios, in the presence of the spell of two great eyes,\r\nlose his very self, and all his strength ebbed away.\r\n\r\nShe lowered her eyes and passed by close to him. He could have shouted\r\nwith impatience. He clenched his fists. He was afraid of not being able\r\nto recover a calm attitude, for speak to her he must. Nevertheless he\r\napproached her with the formula of convention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nill-012\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI salute you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI salute you also,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the woman_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI salute you also,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the woman.\r\n\r\nDemetrios continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to in so leisurely a fashion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she made a movement as if to resume her walk.\r\n\r\nThen Demetrios thought that perhaps he had made a mistake in taking her\r\nfor a courtesan. For some time past, the wives of the magistrates and\r\nfunctionaries had taken to dressing and painting themselves like the\r\nwomen of pleasure. She was probably a woman of honourable reputation,\r\nand it was not without irony that he finished his question thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her two hands to her sides and began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t one this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios bit his lip and suggested, almost timidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t look for one. You have set to work too late. There is no one\r\nabout now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that I was looking for one? I am taking a walk by myself,\r\nand am looking for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you come from then? You certainly have not put on all those\r\njewels for your own pleasure, and that silken veil. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have me go out naked, or dressed in wool like a slave-woman?\r\nI dress for my own benefit. I like to know that I am beautiful, and I\r\nlook at my fingers as I walk in order to recognise all my rings. . . .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have a mirror in your hand and look at nothing but your\r\neyes. Those eyes did not see the light at Alexandria. You are a Jewess.\r\nI recognise it by your voice, which is softer than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not a Jewess. I am a Galil\xc3\xa6n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name, Miriam or No\xc3\xabmi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Syriac name you shall not know. It is a royal name which is not\r\nhome here. My friends call me Chrysis, and it is a compliment that you\r\nmight have paid me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d she said mockingly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is much too late for this kind of\r\ntrifling. Let me go home quickly. I have been up for nearly three\r\nhours. I am dying of hunger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBending down, she took her foot in her hand:\r\n\r\nill-013\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bending down, she took her foot in her hand._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee how my little thongs hurt me. They are too tightly strapped. If I\r\ndo not loose them in a moment, I shall have a mark on my foot, and that\r\nwill be a pretty object to kiss. Leave me quickly. Ah! what an ado! If\r\nI had known, I would not have stopped. My yellow veil is all crumpled\r\nat the waist, look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios passed his hand over his forehead; then, with the careless\r\nair of a man who condescends to make his choice, he murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do nothing of the kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis with a stupefied air.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not even ask me whether it is my pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way! Listen to him! Do you take me for a porneion-girl,\r\nwho puts herself on her back for three obols without looking to see who\r\nis possessing her? Do you even know whether I am free? Do you know what\r\nappointments I may have? Have you followed me in the street? Have you\r\nnoted the doors that open for me? Have you counted the men who think\r\nthey are loved by Chrysis? Show me the way! I shall not show it you, if\r\nyou please. Stay here or go away, but you shall not go home with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know who I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? Of course I do! You are Demetrios of Sa\xc3\xafs; you made the statue of\r\nmy goddess; you are the lover of my queen and the lord of my town. But\r\nfor me you are nothing but a handsome slave, because you have seen me\r\nand you love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came a little nearer to him, and went on in a caressing voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you love me. Oh! don\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me. I know what you are going to\r\nsay: you love no one, you are loved. You are the Well-beloved, the\r\nDarling, the Idol. You refused Glycera, who had refused Antiochus.\r\nDemonassa the Lesbian, who had sworn to die a virgin, entered your bed\r\nduring your sleep, and would have taken you by force if your two Lybian\r\nslaves had not put her naked into the street. Callistion, the\r\nwell-named, despairing of approaching you, has bought the house\r\nopposite yours, and shows herself at the open window in the morning, as\r\nscantily dressed as Artemis in the bath. You think that I do not know\r\nall that? But we courtesans hear of everything. I heard of you the\r\nnight of your arrival at Alexandria; and since then not a single day\r\nhas passed without your name being mentioned. I even know things you\r\nhave forgotten. I even know things that you do not yet know yourself.\r\nPoor little Phyllis hanged herself the day before yesterday on your\r\ndoor-post, did she not? well, the fashion is catching. Lyde has done\r\nlike Phyllis: I saw her this evening as I passed, she was quite blue,\r\nbut the tears were not yet dry upon her cheeks. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know who Lyde\r\nis? a child, a little fifteen-year-old courtesan whom her mother sold\r\nlast month to a Samian shipwright who was passing the night at\r\nAlexandria before going up the river to Thebes. She came to see me. I\r\ngave her some advice; she knew absolutely nothing, not even how to play\r\nat dice. I often took her in my bed, because, when she had no lover,\r\nshe did not know where to sleep. And she loved you! If you had seen her\r\nhug me to her and call me by your name. She wanted to write to you. Do\r\nyou understand? I told her it was not worth while . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-014\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios gazed at her without understanding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, all that is a pure matter of indifference to you, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did not love her. It is I that you love. You\r\nhave not even listened to what I have just told you. I am sure you\r\ncould not repeat a single word. You are absorbed in wondering how my\r\neyelids are made up, speculating on the sweetness of my mouth, on the\r\nsoftness of my hair. Ah! how many others know all this! All who have\r\ndesired me have had their pleasure upon me: men, young men, old men,\r\nchildren, women, young girls. I have refused nobody, do you understand?\r\nFor seven years, Demetrios, I have only slept alone three nights. Count\r\nhow many lovers that makes. Two thousand five hundred and more. I do\r\nnot include those that came in the daytime. Last year I danced naked\r\nbefore twenty thousand persons, and I know that you were not one of\r\nthem. Do you think that I hide myself? Ah! for what, pray? All the\r\nwomen have seen me in the bath. All the men have seen me in bed. You\r\nalone, you shall never see me. I refuse you. I refuse you. You shall\r\nnever know anything of what I am, of what I feel, of my beauty, of my\r\nlove! You are an abominable man, fatuous, cruel, insensible, cowardly!\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why one of us has not had enough hatred to kill you both\r\nin one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms, first you, and afterwards the queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios quietly took her by the two arms, and, without answering a\r\nword, bent her backwards with violence.\r\n\r\nShe had a moment\xe2\x80\x99s anguish; but suddenly she stiffened her knees,\r\nstiffened her elbows, backed a little, and said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am not afraid of that, Demetrios! you shall never take me by\r\nforce, were I as feeble as an amorous virgin and you as strong as a son\r\nof Atlas. You desire not only the satisfaction of your own senses, but\r\nchiefly of mine. Moreover, you want to see me from head to foot,\r\nbecause you believe that I am beautiful, and I am beautiful indeed. Now\r\nthe moon gives less light than my twelve waxen torches. It is almost\r\ndark here. And then it is not customary to undress upon the quay. I\r\ncould not dress myself again without the help of my slave. Let me free,\r\nyou hurt my arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were silent for a few minutes; then Demetrios answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must have done with this, Chrysis. You know well that I shall not\r\nforce you. But let me follow you. However proud you are, you would pay\r\ndearly for the glory of refusing Demetrios.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis still kept silence. He continued more gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are accustomed to the love of others. Do you know what ought to be\r\ngiven to a courtesan who does not love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe became impatient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask you to love me. I am tired of being loved. I do not want\r\nto be loved. I ask you to abandon yourself. For that, I will give you\r\nall the gold in the world. I have it in Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have it in my hair. I am tired of gold. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want gold. I want\r\nbut three things. Will you give them to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios felt that she was going to ask for the impossible. He looked\r\nat her anxiously. But she began to smile, and said in slow tones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a silver mirror to gaze at my eyes within my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it. What else do you want? Quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a carved ivory comb to plunge into my hair like a net into\r\nwater that sparkles in the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will give me my comb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a pearl necklace to hang on my breast, when I dance you the\r\nnuptial dances of my country in my chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyebrows;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will give me my necklace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice became very tender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny I please? Ah! that is exactly what I wanted to ask you. Will you\r\nlet me choose my presents?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat oath will you swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDictate it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Aphrodite you carved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear by the Aphrodite. But why these precautions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! . . . I was uneasy; but now I am reassured\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nShe raised her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have chosen my presents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios suddenly became anxious and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Do you think I shall accept any sort of silver mirror, bought of\r\na merchant of Smyrna, or some stray courtesan. I want the mirror of my\r\nfriend Bacchis, who stole a lover from me last week and jeered at me\r\nspitefully in a little orgie she had with Tryphera, Mousarion, and some\r\nyoung fools who repeated everything to me. It is a mirror she prizes\r\ngreatly because it belonged to Ithodopis, who was fellow-slave with\r\n\xc3\xa6sop and was redeemed by Sappho\xe2\x80\x99s brother. You know that she is a very\r\ncelebrated courtesan. Her mirror is magnificent. It is said that Sappho\r\nused it, and it is for this reason that Bacchis lays store on it. She\r\nhas nothing more precious in the world; but I know where you will find\r\nit. She told me one night, when she was intoxicated. It is under the\r\nthird stone of the altar. She puts it there every evening when she\r\nleaves her house at sunset. Go to-morrow to her house at that hour and\r\nfear nothing: she takes her slaves with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is pure madness,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demetrios. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect me to steal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you not love me? I thought that you loved me. And then, have you\r\nnot sworn? I thought you had sworn. If I am mistaken, let us say no\r\nmore about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe understood that she was ruining him, but he yielded without a\r\nstruggle, almost willingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do what you say,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know well that you will. But you hesitate at first. I understand\r\nthat. It is not an ordinary present. I would not ask it of a\r\nphilosopher. I ask you for it. I know well that you will give it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe toyed a moment with the peacock feathers of her round fan, and\r\nsuddenly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! . . . Neither do I wish for a common ivory comb bought at a\r\ntradesman\xe2\x80\x99s in the town. You told me I might choose, did you not? Well,\r\nI want . . . I want the carved ivory comb in the hair of the wife of\r\nthe high priest. It is much more valuable than the mirror of Rhodopis.\r\nIt came from a queen of Egypt who lived a long time ago, and whose name\r\nis so difficult that I cannot pronounce it. Consequently the ivory is\r\nvery old, and as yellow as if it were gilded. It has a carved figure of\r\na young girl walking in a lotus-marsh. The lotus is higher than she is,\r\nand she is stepping on tiptoe in order not to get wet. . . . . It is\r\nreally a beautiful comb. I am glad you are going to give it to me. I\r\nhave also some little grievances against its present possessor. I had\r\noffered a blue veil to Aphrodite last month; I saw it on this woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead next day. It was a little hasty, and I bore her a grudge for it.\r\nHer comb will avenge me for my veil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how am I to get it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demetrios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! that will be a little more difficult. She is an Egyptian, you\r\nknow, and she makes up her two hundred plaits only once a year, like\r\nthe other women of her race. But I want my comb to-morrow, and you must\r\nkill her to get it. You have sworn an oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pouted at Demetrios, who was looking on the ground. Then she\r\nconcluded very quickly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have chosen my necklace also. I want the seven-stringed pearl\r\nnecklace on the neck of Aphrodite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios started violently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! this time, it is too much! You shall not have the laugh of me to\r\nthe end! Nothing, do you understand? neither the mirror, nor the comb,\r\nnor the collar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she closed his mouth with her hand and resumed her caressing tone:\r\n\r\nill-015\r\n\r\n\r\n_But she closed his mouth with her hand._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that. You know well that you will give me this too. I am\r\nsure of it. I shall have the three gifts. You will come to see me\r\nto-morrow evening, and the day after to-morrow if you like, and every\r\nevening. I shall be at home at any hour, in the costume you prefer,\r\npainted according to your taste, with my hair dressed after your\r\npleasure, ready for your most extravagant caprices. If you desire but\r\ntender love, I will cherish you like a child. If you thirst after rare\r\nsensations, I will not refuse you the most agonising. If you wish for\r\nsilence, I will hold my peace, when you want me to sing, ah! you will\r\nsee, Well-Beloved! I know songs of all countries. I know some that are\r\nsoft as the murmur of springs, others that are terrible as the coming\r\nof thunder. I know some so simple and fresh that a young girl might\r\nsing them to her mother; and I know some that could not be sung at\r\nLampsacos. I know some that Elephantis would have blushed to hear, and\r\nthat I dare not sing above a whisper. The nights you want me to dance,\r\nI will dance till morning. I will dance fully dressed, with my trailing\r\ntunic, or in a transparent veil, or in open drawers and a corselet with\r\ntwo openings to allow the breasts to peep through. But have I promised\r\nyou to dance naked? I will dance naked if you prefer. Naked and with\r\nflowers on my head, or naked with my hair loose, painted like a divine\r\nimage. I can balance my hands, circle my arms, vibrate my breast, heave\r\nmy belly, contort my croup, you will see! I dance on the tips of my\r\ntoes or lying down in the carpets. I know all the dances of Aphrodite,\r\nthat are danced before Ourania, and those that are danced before\r\nAstarte. I even know some they dare not dance. I will dance you all the\r\nloves. When this is finished we shall be only at the beginning. You\r\nwill see! The queen is richer than I am, but there is not in all the\r\npalace a chamber as amorous as mine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what you will\r\nfind there. There are things too beautiful for me to be able to give\r\nyou an idea of them, and others so strange that I do not know the words\r\nto describe them. And then, do you know what you will see, something\r\nwhich transcends all the rest? You will see Chrysis whom you love, and\r\nwhom you do not yet know. Yes, you have only seen my face, you do not\r\nknow how beautiful I am. Ah! Ah! . . . Ah! Ah! You will have surprises.\r\nAh! how you will play with my nipples, how you will bend my little\r\nwaist as it lies upon your arm, how you will tremble in the grasp of my\r\nknees, how you will faint away on my moving body! And how excellent my\r\nmouth! Ah! my kisses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios looked at her with a frenzied eye.\r\n\r\nShe continued tenderly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! You will not give me a poor old silver mirror when you may have\r\nall my hair like a golden forest in your hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios tried to touch it . . . She recoiled and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have it,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will not take for me a little ivory comb which pleases me,\r\nwhen you can have my two arms like two branches of ivory around your\r\nneck?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to stroke them. She drew them behind her back and repeated:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bring it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said very low. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\ncourtesan; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will also give me the seven-stringed necklace of\r\npearls on the neck of Aphrodite, and for that I will sell you all my\r\nbody, which is like a half-opened shell of mother-of-pearl, and more\r\nkisses in your mouth than there are pearls in the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-016\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios held out his head, supplicatingly.\r\n\r\nShe shot him a brilliant glance and gave him her sensual lips . . .\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes she was already afar off. A little pale shadow\r\ndanced before her floating veil.\r\n\r\nHe returned vaguely towards the town, with his forehead bent under the\r\nweight of an inexpressible shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTHE VIRGINS\r\n\r\nThe dim dawn rose on the sea. All things were tinted with lilac. The\r\nfurnace blazing on the summit of the tower of Pharos died down with the\r\nmoon. Fugitive yellow gleams appeared in the violet waves like sirens\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfaces under the hair of purple sea-weed. Daylight came all at once.\r\n\r\nThe quay was deserted. The town was dead. It was the grey light before\r\nthe first day blush that illumines the world\xe2\x80\x99s sleep and brings the\r\nfeverish dreams of morning.\r\n\r\nNothing existed, except silence.\r\n\r\nThe long boats anchored in line near the quays, with their rows of\r\nparallel oars hanging in the water, looked like sleeping birds. The\r\nperspective of the architectural line of the streets was unbroken by\r\nvehicle, horse, or slave. Alexandria was but a solitude, the unreal\r\nphantom of some antique city abandoned for centuries.\r\n\r\nBut the sound of light footsteps fell tremulously upon the ground, and\r\ntwo young girls appeared, one dressed in yellow, the other in blue.\r\n\r\nThey both wore maidens\xe2\x80\x99 girdles, which circled round the hips and\r\nbuckled low down upon the body below the navel. They were the musicians\r\nof the night, the singing-girl and one of the flute-girls.\r\n\r\nThe flute-girl was younger and prettier than her friend. Her eyes\r\nsmiled faintly, pale as the blue of her robe, half hidden under her\r\neyelids. Her two slender flutes hung dangling from her flowered\r\nshoulder-knot along her back. A double iris-garland, fastened to the\r\nankles by two silver anklets, undulated beneath the gauzy robe and\r\nencircled the rounded legs.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyrtocleia, do not be sad because you have lost our tablets. Would you\r\never have forgotten that you possess the love of Rhodis, and can you\r\nthink, naughty girl, you would ever have read in solitude the line\r\nwritten by my hand? Am I one of those faithless friends who engrave\r\ntheir bed-sister\xe2\x80\x99s name upon their nail and unite themselves to another\r\ngirl as soon as the nail has grown to the limit? Do you need a souvenir\r\nof me when you have my living body? I am barely of nubile age, and yet\r\nI was not half so old on the day I saw you for the first time. You\r\nremember it well. It was at the bath. Our mothers took us in their arms\r\nand held us towards one another. We played for a long time on the\r\nmarble before putting on our clothes again. We have never left one\r\nanother since that day, and, five years afterward, we loved each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another first day, Rhodis, and you know it. It is the day you\r\nlinked our two names together in writing upon the tablets. That was the\r\nfirst day! It will never come back again. But never mind. Each day is\r\nnew for me, and when you awake towards evening, it is as if I saw you\r\nfor the first time, You are not a girl at all: you are a little\r\nArcadian nymph that has left her forests because Phoibos has dried up\r\nher fountain. Your body is supple as an olive branch, your skin is soft\r\nas water in summer, the iris circles about your legs, and you wear the\r\nlotus-flower like Astarte the open fig. In what wood haunted by\r\nimmortals did your mother betake her to sleep before your\r\nthrice-blessed birth? and what roaming \xc3\xa6gipan, or what river-god united\r\nhimself with her in the grass? When we have left this terrible African\r\nsoil, you shall take me to your fountain, far beyond Psophis and\r\nPhenens, to vast shady forests where, upon the soft earth, one may see\r\nthe double footprints of satyrs and light-treading nymphs. There you\r\nshall search out a smooth rock, and you shall engrave upon the stone\r\nthe words you wrote upon the wax: the words that are our joy. Listen,\r\nlisten, Rhodis! By the girdle of Aphrodite upon which all desires are\r\nembroidered, all desires are unknown to me; for you are more than my\r\ndream! By the horn of Amaltheia whence flow all the good things of the\r\nworld, the world is a matter of indifference to me; for you are the\r\nonly good I have found in it! When I look at you and when I see myself,\r\nI know not why you love me in return. Your hair is as fair as ears of\r\ncorn; mine is black as a ram\xe2\x80\x99s fleece. Your skin is as white as\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s cheese; mine is brown as the sand upon the beach. Your\r\ntender breast is as flowered as the orange tree in autumn; mine is\r\nmeagre and barren as the rock pine. If my face has gained in beauty, it\r\nis because I have loved you. O Rhodis! well you know that my singular\r\nvirginity is like the lips of Pan eating a sprig of myrtle; yours is\r\nthe colour of roses, and dainty as the mouth of a little child. I do\r\nnot know why you love me; but if you ceased to love me for a day; if,\r\nlike your sister Theano who plays the flute by your side, you ever\r\nstayed to sleep in the houses that employ us, then I should never even\r\nthink of sleeping alone in our bed, and when you came in you would find\r\nme strangled with my girdle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe very idea was so wild and cruel that Rhodis\xe2\x80\x99s long eyes filled with\r\nsmiles and tears. She placed her foot upon a street-post:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy flowers between my legs hamper me. Undo them, adored Myrto. I have\r\nfinished dancing for to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singing-girl started.\r\n\r\nill-017\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is true. I had already forgotten them, those men and women.\r\nThey made both of you dance, you in this Cossian robe, transparent as\r\nwater, and your sister naked with you. If I had not protected you, they\r\nwould have possessed you like a prostitute, as they did your sister\r\nbefore our eyes in the same room. Oh, what an abomination! Did you hear\r\nher cries and wailings? How dolorous is the love of man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe knelt down beside Rhodis and unclasped the two garlands, and then\r\nthe three higher up, imprinting a kiss on the place of each. When she\r\nrose to her feet, the child took her by the neck and swooned under her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMyrto, you are not jealous of all those debauchees? What does it\r\nmatter that they should have seen me? Theano suffices them, and I have\r\nrelinquished her to them. They shall not have me, darling Myrto. Do not\r\nbe jealous of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJealous! I am jealous of everything that approaches you. In order that\r\nyour robes may not have you alone, I put them on when you have worn\r\nthem. In order that the flowers in your hair may not remain amorous of\r\nyou, I give them to mean courtesans who will defile them in their\r\norgies. I have given you nothing, in order that nothing may possess\r\nyou. I am afraid of everything you touch, and I hate everything you\r\nlook at. I should like to pass my whole life between the four walls of\r\na prison alone with myself and you, and unite myself with you so\r\nprofoundly, hide you so well between my arms, that no eye would suspect\r\nyour presence. I would I were the fruit that you eat, the perfume that\r\ndelights you, the sleep that glides beneath your eyelids, the love that\r\nstrains your limbs. I am jealous of the happiness I give you, and I\r\nwould I could give you the very happiness I derive from you. That is\r\nwhat I am jealous of; but I do not fear your mistresses of a night when\r\nthey help me to satisfy your girlish desires. As for lovers, I know\r\nwell that you will never be theirs; I know well that you cannot love\r\nman, intermittent and brutal man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhodis exclaimed with conviction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather go, like Nausithoe, and sacrifice my virginity to the\r\ngod Priapos adored at Thasos. But not this morning, darling. I have\r\ndanced a long time, and I am very tired. I wish I were at home,\r\nsleeping on your arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe smiled, and continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must tell Theano that our bed is no longer hers. We will make her\r\nup another one beside the door. After what I have seen this night I\r\ncannot embrace her again. Myrto, it is really horrible. Is it possible\r\nto love like that? Is that what they call love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it is that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey deceive themselves, Myrto. They do not know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia took her in her arms, and both kept silence together.\r\n\r\nThe wind mingled their hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nCHRYSIS\xe2\x80\x99S HAIR\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rhodis, \xe2\x80\x9clook! I see some one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singing-girl looked. A woman, in the distance, was walking rapidly\r\nalong the quay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recognise her.\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Chrysis. She is wearing her yellow robe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! is she dressed already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. Usually she does not go out before mid-day, and\r\nthe sun is hardly up. Something must have happened to her: something\r\nfortunate no doubt: she is so lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey advanced to meet her, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail, Chrysis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHail. How long have you been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It was daylight when we arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nobody on the quay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-018\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Chrysis. She is wearing her yellow robe.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a man! are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, quite sure. Why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis did not answer. Rhodis went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to see somebody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes . . . perhaps . . . I think perhaps it is as well I have not seen\r\nhim. Yes, it is as well. I was wrong to come back; I could not restrain\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the matter? Do tell us, Chrysis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even us? Not even us, your little friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know later on, together with the whole town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very amiable of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know a little before, if you really want to; but this\r\nmorning it is impossible. Extraordinary things are happening, my dears.\r\nI am dying to tell you, but I must hold my tongue. You were going home?\r\nCome and sleep with me, I am quite alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Chrysis, Chrysidion, we are so tired! We are going home certainly,\r\nbut to have a good sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can sleep afterwards. To-day is the eve of the Aphrodisi\xc3\xa6.\r\nIs it a day for rest? If you want the goddess to protect you and to\r\nmake you happy next year you must enter her temple with eyelids dark as\r\nviolets and cheeks white as lilies. We will see to that; come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her arms round their waists, and closing her caressing hands\r\nupon their little half naked breasts, bore them hurriedly off.\r\n\r\nRhodis, however, remained preoccupied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when we are in your bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you not tell us what is\r\nhappening; what you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you many things, everything you please; but about that\r\nsubject I shall say nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven when we are in your arms, naked, with the lamp extinguished?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not insist, Rhodis: you shall know to-morrow. Wait till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to be very happy? or very powerful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery powerful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhodis opened her eyes wide and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to sleep with the queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am going to be as powerful as she\r\nis. Do you desire anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the little girl became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Chrysis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is something impossible. Why should I ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia spoke for her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Ephesos, in our country, when two virgins of nubile age like Rhodis\r\nand me love one another, the law allows them to be united in marriage.\r\nThey both go to the temple of Athena and sacrifice their double girdle;\r\nthence to the sanctuary of Iphino\xc3\xab, where they offer a lock of their\r\nhair, interwined; and finally to the peristyle of Dionysios, where the\r\nmore male of the two receives a little knife of sharp-edged gold, and a\r\nwhite linen cloth to stanch the blood. In the evening, the \xe2\x80\x9cfiancee\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nconducted to her new home in a flowered chariot between her husband and\r\nthe paranymph, escorted by torch-bearers and flute-girls. And\r\nthenceforth they have the rights of married people; they may adopt\r\nlittle girls and associate them in their intimate life. They are\r\nrespected. They have a family. That is the dream of Rhodis. But it is\r\nnot the custom here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will change the law,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut leave it to me, you shall marry one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the little girl, flushing with joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask which of you is to be the husband. I know that\r\nMyrto possesses everything necessary to create that illusion. You are\r\nfortunate, Rhodis, to have such a friend. They are rare, whatever\r\npeople say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the door, where Djala was sitting on the steps weaving a\r\ntowel of flax. The slave-woman rose to allow them to pass, and then\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\nThe two flute-girls took off their simple clothing in an instant. They\r\nperformed minute ablutions upon each other in a green marble bowl\r\ncommunicating with the bath. Then they rolled upon the bed.\r\n\r\nChrysis looked at them without seeing them. The words spoken by\r\nDemetrios, even the most trivial, ran in her memory unceasingly. She\r\nwas not conscious of the presence of Djala, who silently untied and\r\nunwound her long saffron veil, unbuckled the girdle, took off the\r\nrings, the seals, the armlets, the silver serpents, the golden pins;\r\nbut the gentle titillation of her hair falling over her shoulders woke\r\nher vaguely.\r\n\r\nShe asked for her mirror.\r\n\r\nill-019\r\n\r\n\r\n_She was not conscious of the presence of Djala, who silently\r\nuntied and unwound her long saffron veil._\r\n\r\n\r\nWas she beginning to feel afraid that she was not beautiful enough to\r\nkeep this new lover\xe2\x80\x94for keep him she must\xe2\x80\x94after the mad exploits she\r\nhad demanded of him? Or was it that, by a detailed examination of each\r\none of her physical beauties, she wanted to calm her alarms and justify\r\nher confidence?\r\n\r\nShe brought the mirror close to every part of her body, touching each\r\nin succession. She appraised the whiteness of her skin, estimated its\r\nsoftness by long caresses, its warmth by embraces. She tested the\r\nfullness of her breasts, the firmness of her belly, the tension of her\r\nflesh. She measured her hair and considered its glossiness. She tried\r\nthe strength of her regard, the expression of her mouth, the fire of\r\nher breath; and she bestowed a long, slow kiss along her naked arm from\r\nthe region of the armpit down to the bend of the elbow.\r\n\r\nill-020\r\n\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary emotion, compounded of astonishment and pride, of\r\ncertainty and impatience, took possession of her at this contact with\r\nher own lips. She turned round as if she were looking for somebody; but\r\ncatching sight of the two forgotten Ephesian girls upon her bed, she\r\nleaped into their midst, separated them, hugged them with a sort of\r\namorous fury, and her long golden hair enveloped the three young heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE GARDENS OF THE GODDESS\r\n\r\nThe temple of Aphrodite-Astarte stood outside the gates of the town, in\r\nan immense park, full of flowers and shade. The Nile water, conveyed by\r\nseven aqueducts, induced an extraordinary verdure all the year round.\r\n\r\nThis flowering forest on the sea\xe2\x80\x99s verge, these deep streams, these\r\nlakes, these darkling meadows, had been created in the desert more than\r\ntwo centuries previously by the first of the Ptolemies. Since then, the\r\nsycamores planted by his orders had grown to gigantic size; under the\r\ninfluence of the fertilising waters, the lawns had grown into meads,\r\nthe basins had widened into ponds, nature had turned a park into a\r\nchampaign.\r\n\r\nThe gardens were more than a valley, more than a country; they were a\r\ncomplete world enclosed by bounds of stone and governed by a goddess,\r\nthe soul and centre of this universe. All around it stood a circular\r\nterrace, eighty stades long and thirty-two feet high. This was not a\r\nwall, it was a colossal \xe2\x80\x9ccit\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d composed of fourteen hundred houses. A\r\ncorresponding number of prostitutes inhabited this sacred town, and in\r\nthis unique spot were represented seventy different nationalities.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the sacred houses was uniform and as follows: the door, of\r\nred copper (a metal consecrated to the goddess), bore a phallos-shaped\r\nknocker which fell upon a receiving-plate in relief, the image of the\r\ncteis; and beneath was graved the courtesan\xe2\x80\x99s name, with the initials\r\nof the usual formula:\r\n\r\n\xce\xa9.\xce\x9e.\xce\x95.\r\n\xce\x9a\xce\x9f\xce\xa7\xce\x9b\xce\x99\xce\xa3\r\n\xce\xa0.\xce\xa0.\xce\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo rooms contrived like shops opened out on either side of the door,\r\nthat is to say, there was no wall on the side facing the gardens. The\r\none on the right, the \xe2\x80\x9cchambre expos\xc3\xa9e,\xe2\x80\x9d was the place where the\r\ncourtesan sat bedecked with her adornments upon a lofty cathedra at the\r\nhour when the men arrived. The one on the left was at the disposal of\r\nsuitors who wished to pass the night in the open air, without, however,\r\nsleeping on the grass.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was opened, a corridor gave access to a vast court-yard\r\npaved with marble, the centre of which was occupied by an oval basin. A\r\nperistyle cast a circle of shadow round this patch of light, and\r\ninterposed a zone of coolness between it and the entries to the seven\r\nchambers of the house. At the further end rose the altar of red\r\ngranite.\r\n\r\nEach woman had brought a little idol of the goddess from her native\r\ncountry, and each adored it in her own tongue, as it stood upon the\r\naltar, without understanding the other women. Lachmi, Ashtaroth, Venus,\r\nIschtar, Freia, Mylitta, Cypris, such were the religious names of their\r\ndeified VOLUPTAS. Some venerated her under a symbolic form: a red\r\npebble, a conical stone, a great knotted shell. Most of them had a\r\nlittle statuette on a pedestal of green wood, usually a rudely-carved\r\nfigure with thin arms, heavy breasts, and excessive hips. The hand\r\npointed to the delta-shaped locks of the belly. They laid a\r\nmyrtle-branch at its feet, scattered the altar with rose leaves, and\r\nburned a little grain of incense for every prayer granted. It was the\r\nconfidant of all their troubles, the witness of all their undertakings,\r\nthe supposed cause of all their pleasures. At their death, it was\r\nplaced in their fragile little coffin, to watch over their sepulture.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of these women came from the kingdoms of Asia. Every\r\nyear, the vessels which carried the presents of the tributaries or\r\nallies to Alexandria landed, together with the bales and leathern\r\nbottles, a cargo of a hundred virgins chosen by the priests for the\r\nservice of the sacred garden. They were Mysians and Jewesses, Phrygians\r\nand Cretans, daughters of Ecbatana and Babylon, maidens from the Bay of\r\nPearls and from the sacred banks of the Ganges. Some were white-skinned\r\nwith medallion-like faces and inflexible bosoms; others, brown as the\r\nearth under rain, wore silver rings in their noses. Their hair fell\r\nshort and dark upon their shoulders.\r\n\r\nSome came from a still greater distance: dainty, deliberate little\r\nbeings, whose language nobody understood, and who resembled yellow\r\nmonkeys.\r\n\r\nTheir long eyes pointed towards their temples; they dressed their\r\nstraight black hair in the quaintest fashion. These girls remained all\r\ntheir lives as timid as strayed animals. They knew the movements of\r\nlove, but refused the kiss upon the mouth. Between two passing unions\r\nthey were to be seen sitting on their little feet, and playing with one\r\nanother, and amusing themselves like infants.\r\n\r\nill-021\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a solitary meadow, the pink and pale daughters of the North lived\r\ntogether, lying upon the grass. They were Sarmatians with triple\r\ntresses, robust legs, square shoulders, who made garlands for\r\nthemselves with the branches of trees, and wrestled for a pastime.\r\nThere were big-breasted, flat-nosed, hairy Scythians, who paired in the\r\nattitude of beasts; gigantic Teutons who terrified the Egyptians with\r\ntheir hair pale as that of old men and their flesh softer than that of\r\nchildren; Gauls, sandy-hued like cows, and who laughed without a\r\nmotive; young Celts with sea-green eyes, who never went out naked.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, the brown-breasted Iberians assembled together during the\r\nday. They had heavy hair that they dressed with extreme care, and\r\nnervous bellies which they did not depilate. Their firm skins and\r\npowerful croups were held in great esteem by the Alexandrians. They\r\nwere chosen for dancing-girls as often as for mistresses. Under the\r\nlarge shadow of the palm-trees lived the daughters of Africa: Numidians\r\nveiled in white, Carthaginians apparelled in black gauze, Negresses\r\nenveloped in many-coloured costumes.\r\n\r\nThey were fourteen hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen once a woman had entered the garden, she never left it till the\r\nfirst day of her old age. She gave the half of her gains to the temple,\r\nand the remainder went to defray the cost of her meals and perfumes.\r\n\r\nill-022\r\n\r\n\r\n_The poorer tradesman . . . preferred to address themselves\r\nto the women who slept thus in the open air._\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were not slaves, and each was the real owner of one of the houses\r\nof the Terrace; but all were not equally beloved, and the most\r\nfortunate often found the opportunity of buying the neighbouring\r\nhouses, which their owners were willing to sell in order to escape the\r\nravages of hunger. These girls carried off their obscene statuettes to\r\nthe park and searched out a flat stone to serve as an altar, in a\r\ncorner which henceforth they did not leave. The poorer tradesmen were\r\naware of this. and preferred to address themselves to the women who\r\nslept thus in the open air upon the moss near their sanctuaries; but\r\noccasionally even these suitors were not forthcoming, and then the poor\r\ncreatures took to themselves a partner in distress. These passionate\r\nfriendships developed almost into conjugal love. The couple shared\r\neverything down to the last scrap of wool. They consoled one another\r\nfor their long periods of chastity by alternate complaisances.\r\n\r\nThose who had no girl friends offered themselves of their own accord as\r\nslaves to their more prosperous colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe latter were forbidden to have more than a dozen of these poor\r\ncreatures in their service; but twenty-two courtesans were quoted as\r\nhaving attained the maximum. These had chosen a motley staff of\r\ndomestics from all the nationalities.\r\n\r\nIf, in the course of their stray amours, they conceived a son, he was\r\nbrought up in the temple-enclosure in the contemplation of the perfect\r\nform and in the service of its divinity. If they were brought to bed of\r\na daughter, the child was consecrated to the goddess.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of its life, they celebrated its symbolic marriage\r\nwith the son of Dionysos, and the Hierophant deflowered it herself with\r\na little golden knife; for virginity is displeasing to Aphrodite. Later\r\non, the little girl entered the Didascalion, a great monumental school\r\nsituated behind the temple, and where the theory and practice of all\r\nthe erotic arts were taught in seven stages: the use of the eyes, the\r\nembrace, the motions of the body, the secrets of the bite, of the kiss,\r\nand of glottism.\r\n\r\nThe pupil chose the day of her first experiment at her own good\r\npleasure, because desire is ordained by the goddess, whose will must be\r\nobeyed. On that day, she was allotted one of the houses of the Terrace,\r\nand some of these children, who were not even nubile, counted amongst\r\nthe most zealous and the most esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Didascalion, the seven class-rooms, the little\r\ntheatre, and the peristyle of the court, were decorated with ninety-two\r\nfrescoes designed to sum up the whole of amatory teaching. It was the\r\nlife-work of one man. Cleochares of Alexandria, the natural son and\r\ndisciple of Apelles, had terminated them on the eve of his death.\r\nRecently, Queen Berenice, who was greatly interested in the celebrated\r\nschool and sent her young sisters to it, had ordered a series of marble\r\ngroups from Demetrios in order to complete the decoration; but as yet\r\nonly one of them had been erected, in the children\xe2\x80\x99s class-room.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each year, in the presence of the entire body of\r\ncourtesans, a great competition took place, which excited an\r\nextraordinary emulation amongst this crowd of women, for the twelve\r\nprizes which were offered conferred the right to the most exalted glory\r\nit was possible to dream of: the right to enter the Cotytteion.\r\n\r\nThis last monument was shrouded in so much mystery, that it is\r\nimpossible for us to give a detailed description of it. We know merely\r\nthat it was comprised in the peribola and that it had the form of a\r\ntriangle of which the base was a temple of the goddess Cotytto, in\r\nwhose name fearful unknown debauches took place. The other two sides of\r\nthe monument were composed of eighteen houses; they were inhabited by\r\nthirty-six courtesans, so sought after by rich lovers that they did not\r\ngive themselves for less than two min\xc3\xa6: they were the Baptes of\r\nAlexandria. Once a month, at full moon, they assembled in the temple\r\nenclosure, maddened by aphrodisiacs, and girt with the canonical\r\nphallos. The oldest of the thirty-six was required to take a mortal\r\ndose of the terrible erotogenous philter. The certainty of a speedy\r\ndeath impelled her to attempt without hesitation all the dangerous\r\nfeats of sensual passion before which the living recoil. Her body,\r\ncovered with foam, became the centre and model of the whirling orgie;\r\nin the midst of prolonged shriekings, cries, tears, and dances, the\r\nother naked women embraced her with frenzy, bathed their hair in her\r\nsweat, fastened on her burning flesh, and drew fresh ardors from the\r\nuninterrupted spasm of this furious agony. Three years these women\r\nlived thus, and such was the wild madness of their end at the close of\r\nthe thirty-sixth month.\r\n\r\nOther less venerated sanctuaries had been erected by the women, in\r\nhonour of the other names of the multiform Aphrodite. There was an\r\naltar sacred to the Ouranian Aphrodite, which received the chaste vows\r\nof sentimental courtesans: another to the Apostrophian Aphrodite, who\r\ngranted forgetfulness of unrequited loves; another to the Chrysean\r\nAphrodite, who attracted rich lovers; another to Genetyllis, the patron\r\ngoddess of women in child-birth; another to Aphrodite of Colias, who\r\npresided over gross passions, for everything which related to love fell\r\nwithin the pious cult of the goddess. But these special altars\r\npossessed no efficacy or virtue except in the case of unimportant\r\ndesires. Their service was haphazard, their favours were a matter of\r\ndaily occurrence, and their votaries were on terms of familiarity with\r\nthem. Suppliants whose prayers had been granted made simple offerings\r\nof flowers; those who were not content defiled them with their\r\nexcrements. They were neither consecrated nor kept up by the priests,\r\nand their profanation incurred no punishment.\r\n\r\nFar different was the discipline of the temple.\r\n\r\nThe temple, the Great Temple of the Great Goddess, the most sacred spot\r\nin all Egypt, the inviolable Astarte\xc3\xafon, was a colossal edifice one\r\nhundred and thirty six feet in length, standing on the summit of the\r\ngardens and approached on all sides by seventeen steps. The golden\r\ngates were guarded by twelve hermaphrodite hierodules, symbolising the\r\ntwo objects of love and the twelve hours of the night.\r\n\r\nill-023\r\n\r\n\r\nThe entrance did not face towards the east, but in the direction of\r\nPaphos, that is to say, towards the north-east. The sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays never\r\npenetrated directly into the sanctuary of the Great Goddess of the\r\nNight. Eighty-six columns upheld the architrave: they were tinted\r\npurple as far as their mid-height, and all the upper part stood out\r\nfrom these gaudy trappings with an unspeakable whiteness, like the\r\nbusts of standing women.\r\n\r\nBetween the epistyle and the coronis, the long belt-shaped Zophora\r\nunfolded its bestial sculptures, erotic and fabulous. There were\r\ncentauresses mounted by stallions, goats tumbled by meagre satyrs,\r\nvirgins served by monstrous bulls, na\xc3\xafads covered by stags, bacchantes\r\nloved by tigers, lionesses seized by griffins. All this great wallowing\r\nmultitude of beings was exalted by the irresistible divine passion. The\r\nmale strained, the female opened, and the fusion of the creative forces\r\nproduced the first thrill of life. The crowd of obscure couples\r\nsometimes, by chance, left a clear space round some immortal scene:\r\nEuropa on hands and knees bearing the weight of the glorious Olympian\r\nbeast; Leda guiding the hardy swan between her beautiful arched thighs.\r\nFarther on, the insatiable Siren exhausting expiring Glaucos; the god\r\nPan standing upright and possessing an hamadryad with flying hair; the\r\nSphinx raising her croup to the level of the horse Pegasos. At the end\r\nof the frieze, the sculptor had carved a figure of himself facing the\r\ngoddess Aphrodite. He stood there modelling the contours of a perfect\r\ncteis in soft wax, with the goddess herself as his model, as if his\r\nwhole ideal of beauty, joy, and virtue had long since taken refuge in\r\nthis precious fragile flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nMELITTA\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPurify thyself, stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall enter pure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demetrios.\r\n\r\nDipping the end of her hair in water, the young gate-keeper moistened\r\nfirst his eyelids, then his lips and fingers, in order that his glance\r\nmight be sanctified, as also the kiss of his mouth and the caress of\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nAnd then he pressed forward into the wood of Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark branches, he perceived a setting sun of sombre purple,\r\npowerless to dazzle the eyes. It was the evening of the day on which\r\nhis life had been convulsed by the meeting with Chrysis.\r\n\r\nThe feminine soul is of a simplicity incredible to men. Where there is\r\nnothing but a straight line, they obstinately search for the complexity\r\nof a web; they find emptiness and go astray in it. Thus it was that the\r\nsoul of Chrysis, limpid as a little child\xe2\x80\x99s, appeared to Demetrios more\r\nmysterious than a problem in metaphysics. After leaving this woman upon\r\nthe quay, he went back to his house like a man in a dream, incapable of\r\nanswering all the questions which tormented him. What did she want with\r\nthese three gifts? It was impossible for her either to wear or to sell\r\na celebrated mirror, acquired by theft, the comb of an assassinated\r\nwoman, the pearl necklace of the goddess. If she kept them at home, she\r\nwould expose herself every day to the possibility of a fatal discovery.\r\nThen why ask for them? To destroy them? He knew only too well that\r\nwomen are incapable of enjoying things in secret and that good fortune\r\nbrings them happiness only as soon as it is noised abroad. And then,\r\nwhat divination, what profound clairvoyance had led her to judge him\r\ncapable of accomplishing three such extraordinary actions for her sake?\r\n\r\nAssuredly, if he had liked, he might have carried off Chrysis from her\r\nhome, held her at his mercy, and made her his mistress, his wife, or\r\nhis slave, at choice. He had even the right to do away with her,\r\nsimply. Former revolutions had accustomed the citizens to violent\r\ndeaths, and no one would have troubled about the disappearance of a\r\ncourtesan. Chrysis must know this, and yet she had dared . . .\r\n\r\nill-024\r\n\r\n\r\n_The young gate-keeper moistened first his eyelids._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more he thought about her, the more grateful he was to her for\r\nhaving varied the usual routine of bargaining in so charming a manner.\r\nHow many women of equal worth with Chrysis had offered themselves\r\nclumsily! But what did this one ask for? Neither love, nor gold, nor\r\njewels, but three unheard-of crimes! She interested him keenly. He had\r\noffered her all the treasures of Egypt: he felt distinctly, now, that\r\nif she had accepted them she would not have received two obols, and\r\nthat he would have tired of her even before knowing her. Three crimes\r\nwere certainly an unusual salary; but she was worthy to receive it\r\nsince she was a woman capable of exacting it, and he promised himself\r\nto go on with the adventure.\r\n\r\nIn order not to give himself the time to repent of his firm resolve, he\r\nwent the very same day to the house of Bacchis, found the house empty,\r\ntook the silver mirror and went off to the gardens.\r\n\r\nWas it necessary to make a direct call on Chrysis\xe2\x80\x99s second victim?\r\nDemetrios thought not. The priestess Touni, who owned the famous ivory\r\ncomb, was so charming and so weak that he was afraid of repenting if he\r\nwent straight to her house without any preliminary precautions. He\r\nretraced his steps and went along the Grand Terrace.\r\n\r\nThe courtesans were on show in their \xe2\x80\x9cchambres expos\xc3\xa9es\xe2\x80\x9d like flowers\r\nin a shop window.\r\n\r\nTheir attitudes and their costumes had no less diversity than their\r\nages, types, and races. The most beautiful, according to the tradition\r\nof Phryne, leaving exposed nothing but the oval of their faces, sat\r\nenveloped from head to foot in their great garment of fine wool. Others\r\nhad adopted the fashion of transparent robes, under which one\r\ndistinguished their beauties mysteriously, just as, through limpid\r\nwater, one discerns the green mosses lying in splashes of shade upon\r\nthe bottom. Those whose sole charm consisted in their youthfulness sat\r\nnaked to the waist, stiffening out their busts in order to display to\r\nthe best advantage the firmness of their breasts. But the most mature,\r\nknowing that the features of the feminine visage age more quickly than\r\nthe skin of the body, sat quite naked, holding their breasts in their\r\nhands, and stretching their clumsy thighs apart, as if they wished to\r\nprove that they were still women.\r\n\r\nill-025\r\n\r\n\r\n_Demetrios passed slowly before them._\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios passed slowly before them, with unflagging admiration. He had\r\nnever yet succeeded in contemplating a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nudity without intense\r\nemotion. He understood neither disgust before the corpse of a young\r\nwoman nor insensibility to the body of a little girl. That evening any\r\nwoman could have charmed him. Provided she remained silent and did not\r\ndisplay more ardour than the minimum required by the etiquette of the\r\nbed, he was quite ready to forgive her for her lack of beauty. And what\r\nis more, he even preferred that she should have a coarse body, for the\r\nmore his intelligence considered faultless forms, the less room was\r\nthere for his sensual desires. The agitation which he felt upon contact\r\nwith living beauty was due to a sensualism exclusively cerebral, which\r\nannihilated mere sexual excitation. He remembered with anguish having\r\nremained all night as impotent as an old man, by the side of the most\r\nadmirable woman he had ever held in his arms. And since that night he\r\nhad learnt to choose mistresses of less purity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t recognise me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned round with a negative sign, and went on his way, for he never\r\nundressed the same woman twice. It was the principle that guided his\r\nvisits to the gardens. A woman one has not yet possessed retains\r\nsomething of the virgin; but what good result, what surprise can one\r\nexpect from a second rendez-vous? It is almost marriage. Demetrios did\r\nnot expose himself to the illusions of the second night. Queen Berenice\r\nsufficed for his rare conjugal impulses, and with that exception he was\r\ncareful to choose a new accomplice for every evening\xe2\x80\x99s indispensable\r\nadultery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClonarion!\r\n\r\nGnatene!\r\n\r\nPlango!\r\n\r\nMna\xc3\xafs!\r\n\r\nCrobyle!\r\n\r\nIoessa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey cried their names as he passed, and some added protestations of\r\ntheir ardent natures or proposed an abnormal vice. Demetrios followed\r\nthe road. He was preparing to choose at a venture, according to his\r\nhabit, when a little girl entirely dressed in blue leaned her head upon\r\nher shoulder and said to him softly, without rising:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it quite out of the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe novelty of this mode of address made him smile. He stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI choose you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little girl gleefully jumped to her feet and gave two raps with the\r\nphallus-shaped knocker. The door was opened by an old slave woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGorgo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little girl, \xe2\x80\x9cI have got somebody; quickly, get some\r\ncakes and Cretan wine, and make the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round to Demetrios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want any satyrion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have some?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to keep it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child. \xe2\x80\x9cI am asked for it oftener than\r\nyou think. Come this way; be careful of the steps, one of them is worn.\r\nGo into my room. I shall be back in a moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe room was quite simple, like those of the novices. A great bed, a\r\ncouch, a few seats and carpets composed all the scanty furniture; but\r\nthrough a large open bay there was a view over the gardens, the sea,\r\nthe double harbour of Alexandria. Demetrios remained standing and\r\nlooked at the distant city.\r\n\r\nSuns setting behind harbours! Incomparable glories of maritime cities,\r\ncalm skies, purple waters! Upon what soul vociferous with joy or sorrow\r\nwould you not cast a shroud of silence? What feet have not halted, what\r\npassions have not withered, what voices have not died away before you?\r\n. . . Demetrios looked; a swell of torrential flame seemed to issue\r\nfrom the sun, half dipping into the sea, and to flow straight to the\r\nleft bend of the wood of Aphrodite. From horizon to horizon, the\r\nMediterranean was flooded by the sumptuous purple spectrum which lay in\r\nsharply-defined bands of colour, golden red and dull violet side by\r\nside. Between this ever-shifting splendour and the peaty mirror of Lake\r\nMareotis, stood the white mass of the town, bathed in red and violet\r\nreflexions. Its twenty thousand flat houses spreading in different\r\ndirections picked it out marvellously with twenty thousand dashes of\r\ncolour that underwent a perpetual metamorphosis according to the\r\nvarious phases of the setting luminary. The flaming sun shot forth\r\nrapid shafts, then was swallowed up, almost suddenly, in the sea, and\r\nwith the first reflux of the night, there floated over the whole earth\r\na thrill, a muffled breeze, uniform and transparent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are figs, cakes, a piece of honeycomb, wine, a woman. Eat the\r\nfigs while it is daylight and the woman when it is dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the little girl, laughing as she entered. She bade the young man\r\nsit down, mounted astride on his knees, and stretching her two arms\r\nbehind her head, made fast a rose which was on the point of slipping\r\ndown from her auburn hair.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself Demetrios could not restrain an exclamation of\r\nsurprise. She was completely naked, and when divested of her ample\r\nrobe, her little body was seen to be so young, so infantine in the\r\nbreast, so narrow at the hips, so visibly immature, that Demetrios felt\r\na sense of pity, like a horseman on the point of throwing his man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweight upon an over-delicate mare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a woman! By the two goddesses, what am I, then? A Thracian, a\r\nporter, or an old philosopher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nill-026\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTen and a half. Eleven. One may say eleven. I was born in the gardens.\r\nMy mother is a Milesian. She is called Pythias, but she goes by the\r\nname of \xe2\x80\x98The Goat.\xe2\x80\x99 Shall I send for her, if you think me too little?\r\nHer house is not far from mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been to the Didascalion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am still there in the sixth class. I shall have finished next year;\r\nand not too soon either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAren\xe2\x80\x99t you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! if only you knew how difficult the mistresses are to please! They\r\nmake you recommence the same lesson twenty times! Things perfectly\r\nuseless that men never ask for. And then one is tired out, all for\r\nnothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that at all. Come, take a fig; not that one, it\r\nis not ripe. I will show you a new way to eat. Look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. It is longer and no better than the other way. I see that\r\nyou are a good pupil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I have learnt everything I know by myself. The mistresses would\r\nhave us believe that they are cleverer than we are. They have more\r\nstyle, that may be, but they have invented nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have many lovers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all too old: it is inevitable. Young men are so foolish! They\r\nonly like women forty years old. Now and again I see young men pretty\r\nas Eros pass by, and if you were to see what they choose! Hippopotami!\r\nIt is enough to make one turn pale. I hope sincerely that I shall never\r\nreach these women\xe2\x80\x99s age: I should be too ashamed to undress. I am so\r\nglad to be still quite young. The breasts always develop too soon. I\r\nthink that the first month I see my blood flow I shall feel ready to\r\ndie. Let me give you a kiss. I like you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation took a less serious if not a more silent turn,\r\nand Demetrios rapidly perceived that his scruples were beside the mark\r\nin the case of so expert a young lady. She seemed to realise that she\r\nwas somewhat meagre pasturage for a young man\xe2\x80\x99s appetite, and she\r\nbattled her lover by a prodigious activity of furtive finger-touches,\r\nwhich he could neither foresee nor elude, nor direct, and which never\r\nleft him the leisure for a loving embrace. She multiplied her agile,\r\nfirm little body around him, offered herself, refused herself, slipped\r\nand turned and struggled. Finally they grasped one another. But this\r\nhalf hour was merely a long game.\r\n\r\nShe jumped out of bed the first, dipped her finger in the honey-bowl\r\nand moistened her lips; then, making a thousand efforts not to laugh,\r\nshe bent over Demetrios and rubbed her mouth against his. Her round\r\ncurls danced on either side of their cheeks. The young man smiled and\r\nleaned upon his elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMelitta. Did you not see my name upon the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see it in my room. They have written it all over the walls. I\r\nshall soon be forced to have them repainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios raised his head: the four panels of the chamber were covered\r\nwith inscriptions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very curious, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMay one read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you like. I have no secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe read. Melitta\xe2\x80\x99s name was there several times repeated, coupled with\r\nvarious men\xe2\x80\x99s names and barbaric drawings. Tender, obscene, or comic\r\nsentences jostled oddly with one another. Lovers boasted of their\r\nvigour, or detailed the charms of the little courtesan, or poked fun at\r\nher girl-friends. All this was interesting merely as a written proof of\r\na general degradation. But, looking towards the bottom of the\r\nright-hand panel, Demetrios gave a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that? What is that? Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? What? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d said the child. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere. That name. Who wrote that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his finger stopped under this double line.\r\n\r\n\xce\x9c\xce\x95\xce\x9b\xce\x99\xce\xa4\xce\xa4\xce\x91 .\xce\x9b. \xce\xa7\xce\xa1\xce\xa5\xce\xa3\xce\x99\xce\x94\xce\x91\r\n\xce\xa7\xce\xa1\xce\xa5\xce\xa3\xce\x99\xce\xa3 .\xce\x9b. \xce\x9c\xce\x95\xce\x9b\xce\x99\xce\xa4\xce\xa4\xce\x91\xce\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s me. I wrote that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she, Chrysis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy great friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say. That is not what I ask you. Which Chrysis? There are\r\nmany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine, the most beautiful. Chrysis of Galilee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know her! you know her! But speak, speak! Where does she come\r\nfrom? where does she live? who is her lover? tell me everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down upon the couch and took the little girl upon his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in love, then?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat matters little to you. Tell me what you know; I am in a hurry to\r\nhear everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know nothing at all. It is quite short. She has been to see me\r\ntwice, and you may imagine that I have not asked her for details about\r\nher family. I was too happy to have her, and I did not lose time in\r\nconversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a pretty girl, what do you expect me to say? Do you want me to\r\nname all the parts of her body, adding that everything is beautiful?\r\nAnd then, she is a woman, a real woman . . . Every time I think about\r\nher I desire somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-027\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd she put her arm round the neck of Demetrios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know anything about her?\xe2\x80\x9d he began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x94I know that she comes from Galilee, that she is nearly twenty\r\nyears old, and that she lives in the Jews\xe2\x80\x99 quarter, in the east end,\r\nnear the gardens. But that is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd about her life, her tastes? can you tell me nothing? She is fond\r\nof women, since she came to see you. But is she altogether Lesbian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. The first night she passed here, she brought a lover,\r\nand I swear to you there was no make-believe about her. When a woman is\r\nsincere, I can see it by her eyes. That did not prevent her from\r\nreturning once quite alone. And she has promised me a third night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she has any other _amie_ in the gardens?\r\nNobody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, one of her countrywomen, Chimairis. She is very poor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere does she live? I must see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has slept in the wood for upwards of a year. She has sold her\r\nhouse. But I know where her den is. I can take you to it if you wish.\r\nPut on my sandals, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios rapidly buckled the plaited leather straps round Melitta\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslender ankles. Then he handed her her short robe, which she merely\r\nthrew over her arm, and they departed in haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey walked far. The park was immense. From time to time, a girl under\r\na tree proffered her name and opened her robe, then lay down again and\r\nleaned her face upon her hand. Melitta knew some of them: they embraced\r\nher without stopping her. Passing before a rustic altar, she gathered\r\nthree great flowers and placed them upon the stone.\r\n\r\nill-028\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cMy little girl! my little love! how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not yet dusk. The intense light of summer days has something\r\npermanent about it which lingers vaguely in the slow twilight.\r\n\r\nThe faint, humid stars, hardly brighter than the body of the sky,\r\ntwinkled and throbbed gently, and the shadows of the branches remained\r\nindecisive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma! There\xe2\x80\x99s mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Melitta suddenly.\r\n\r\nA woman, dressed in a garment of triple muslin striped with blue, was\r\nseen advancing with a tranquil step, alone. As soon as she caught sight\r\nof the child she ran up to her, raised her off the ground, lifted her\r\nup in her arms, and kissed her energetically on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little girl! my little love! how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am guiding somebody who wants to see Chimairis. And you? Are you out\r\nfor a walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorinna is _accouch\xc3\xa9e_. I have been to see her. I have dined by her\r\nbedside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has she given birth to? A boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo twin girls, my dear, as pink as wax dolls. You can go and see them\r\ntonight; she will show them to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how lovely! Two little courtesans. What are their names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are both called Pannychis, because they were born on the day\r\nbefore the Aphrodisi\xc3\xa6. It is a divine presage. They will be pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe replaced the child upon her feet, and turning to Demetrios:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of my daughter? Have I the right to be proud of\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the right to be satisfied with one another,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melitta.\r\n\r\nHe silently imprinted a kiss between her breasts. Pythias returned it\r\nto him upon the mouth, and they separated.\r\n\r\nDemetrios and the child advanced a few more paces beneath the trees,\r\nwhilst the courtesan receded into the distance, turning her head as she\r\nwalked. At last they reached their goal, and Melitta said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChimairis was sitting crouching upon her left heel, on a little\r\ngrass-plot between two trees and a bust. A sort of red rag, her last\r\nremaining day garment, lay spread out beneath her. At night, she slept\r\nupon it naked, at the hour the men passed. Demetrios contemplated her\r\nwith growing interest. She had the feverish aspect of certain emaciated\r\ndark women whose tawny bodies seem consumed by an ever-throbbing\r\nardour. Her powerful lips, the excessive brilliancy of her glance, her\r\nlivid eyelids combined to produce a double expression of sensual\r\nlustfulness and physical exhaustion. The curve of her hollow belly and\r\nher nervous thighs formed a natural cavity, designed as if to receive;\r\nand as she had sold everything, even her combs and pins, even her\r\ndepilatory tweezers, her hair was tangled together in inextricable\r\ndisorder. A black pubescence invested her nudity with a certain savage\r\nand shaggy effrontery.\r\n\r\nA great he-goat stood stiffly on its four legs beside her. It was\r\ntethered to a tree by a gold chain which had formerly glittered in a\r\nquadruple coil upon its mistress\xe2\x80\x99s breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChimairis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melitta, \xe2\x80\x9cget up. Here is somebody who wishes to\r\nspeak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Jewess looked, but did not move.\r\n\r\nDemetrios advanced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Chrysis?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see her often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you talk to me about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? No? What? you cannot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMelitta was stupefied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHave confidence. He loves her, he wishes her\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see clearly that he loves her.\xe2\x80\x9d answered Chimairis. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he loves\r\nher, he wishes her ill. If he loves her, I shall not speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios tingled with rage, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jewess. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will tell me whether I am\r\nmistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the young man\xe2\x80\x99s left hand and turned it towards the moonlight.\r\nMelitta leaned forward to see, although she could not read the\r\nmysterious lines, but their fatality attracted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demetrios.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see . . . Can I tell what I see? will you be obliged to me? First I\r\nsee happiness, but it is all in the past. I also see love, but it is\r\ndrowned in blood . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my blood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a woman\xe2\x80\x99s blood. And then the blood of another woman. And then\r\nyours, a little later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios shrugged his shoulders, and when he turned, he perceived\r\nMelitta fleeing down the alley at full speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has given her a fright,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chimairis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is no question of Melitta or of me. Let things take their\r\ncourse, since nothing can be prevented. Your destiny was certain even\r\nbefore your birth. Go. I shall say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d And she dropped his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nLOVE AND DEATH\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s blood. Afterwards another woman\xe2\x80\x99s blood. Afterwards yours,\r\nbut a little later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios repeated these words to himself as he walked, and in spite of\r\nhimself, his belief in them weighed upon him. He had never had any\r\nfaith in oracles drawn from the bodies of victims or the movements of\r\nplanets. These affinities seemed too problematical. But the complex\r\nlines of the hand have, in themselves, an exclusively personal\r\nhoroscopic aspect which he considered with uneasiness. The\r\nfortune-teller\xe2\x80\x99s prediction haunted his mind.\r\n\r\nIn his turn, he examined the palm of his left hand, on which his life\r\nwas summed up in secret and indelible signs.\r\n\r\nIn the first place he saw, at the summit, a sort of regular crescent,\r\nthe ends of which pointed towards the base of the fingers. Below this,\r\na deep quadruple line, knotted and roseale, marked in two places by\r\nvery red spots. Another line, but thinner, ran parallel to this at\r\nfirst, and then swerved brusquely round towards the wrist. Finally, a\r\nthird line, short and clear, turned round the base of the thumb, which\r\nwas entirely covered with thread-like markings. He saw all that; but,\r\nnot being able to read the hidden symbol, he passed his hand over his\r\neyes and changed the subject of his meditations.\r\n\r\nChrysis! Chrysis! Chrysis! This name throbbed within him like a fever.\r\nSatisfy her, vanquish her, clasp her in his arms, fly with her\r\nelsewhere, to Syria, to Greece, to Rome, no matter where, provided it\r\nwas a place where he had no mistress and she no lovers: that was the\r\nthing, and immediately, immediately.\r\n\r\nOf the three presents she had asked for, one was already in his\r\npossession. Remained the other two: the comb and the necklace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe comb first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\nEvery evening at sunset, the high priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife went forth and sat upon\r\na marble seat, with her back turned to the forest and her face set to\r\nthe great expanse of sea in front of her. Demetrios knew this well, for\r\nthis woman, like so many others, had been in love with him, and she had\r\ntold him that the day he chose to possess her it was there he would\r\nfind her.\r\n\r\nIt was to that spot, then, that he directed his steps. And there indeed\r\nshe was; but she did not see him coming. She was sitting with her eyes\r\nshut, with her body thrown back upon the seat, and her arms hanging\r\nnegligently by her sides.\r\n\r\nill-029\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was an Egyptian. Her name was Touni. She wore a light tunic of\r\nbright purple, without clasp or girdle, and without other adornments\r\nthan two black stars to mark the points of her breasts. The thin\r\ntissue, ironed into pleats, terminated at the curve of the delicate\r\nknees, and little shoes of blue leather, fitting like gloves, covered\r\nher dainty round feet. Her skin was very swarthy, her lips very thick,\r\nher shoulders very small, and her fragile, supple waist seemed to bend\r\nunder the weight of her full throat. She was asleep with her mouth\r\nopen, dreaming peacefully.\r\n\r\nDemetrios, noiselessly, sat down on the bench, by her side.\r\n\r\nHe slowly drew nearer and nearer, leaning over her, appreciating the\r\ndelicate lines of her smooth, dark-skinned shoulders, slender at the\r\nsummit, muscular near the armpit and joined to the bust by the shading\r\nof the bush beneath.\r\n\r\nLower down, the long, loose slit of the purple muslin tunic was open as\r\nfar as the hips. Through the gaping drapery, Demetrios slowly passed\r\nhis hand, and his united finger-tips touched the curves of her left\r\nbreast, damp with perspiration. Its nipple rose erect in the palm of\r\nhis hand. Notwithstanding, Touni slept on.\r\n\r\nHer dream gradually changed, but did not fade. Her breath came quicker\r\nthrough her half open lips and she murmured a long, unintelligible\r\nsentence, as her fevered head fell back once more.\r\n\r\nWith the same stealthy tenderness, Demetrios withdrew his hot hand, to\r\nlet it be refreshed by the light breeze.\r\n\r\nill-030\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_She was asleep.... dreaming peacefully._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the vague outline of the blue garden slopes as far as the immense\r\nscintillation of the night, shuddered the eternal sea. Like unto\r\nanother bosom of some fresh priestess, its undulations were swelling\r\nheavenwards, uplifted by the dreams of antiquity that still cause it to\r\nthrill in the sight of our belated glances. When the end of all things\r\nis nigh, the last living beings will try before they disappear to\r\nfathom the mysteries of the moving ocean.\r\n\r\nThe moon inclined her great goblet of blood over the waters. Far away,\r\nin the purest atmosphere that had ever united heaven and earth, a\r\nslight red trail, where black veins meandered, trembled on the surface\r\nof the waves beneath the rising orb of night, as when the agitation of\r\na caress on a rounded breast, in the dead of night, remains long after\r\nthe hand that caused it has been lifted.\r\n\r\nTouni still slumbered, her head leaning backwards, her body well-nigh\r\nnaked, enshrouded in tinted muslin folds.\r\n\r\nThe purple glare of the moon, as yet on the horizon, came over the sea\r\ntowards the sleeping woman. The fatal, vivid rays lit her up with a\r\nflame that seemed immobile. Little by little, their brilliancy mounted,\r\nencircling the Egyptian girl. Her black curls appeared one by one, and\r\nfinally the Comb flashed out of the darkness: the royal Comb that\r\nChrysis coveted. The ivory diadem was now bathed in the glory of the\r\ncrimson moonbeams.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the sculptor took Touni\xe2\x80\x99s sweet face in both his\r\nhands, turning her features towards his own. Her eyes opened and became\r\ndilated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios! Demetrios! Is it you? Oh! You have come at last! You are\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d she murmured, clasping him in her arms, as her voice rang with\r\nthe accents of happiness. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it really you, Demetrios, whose hands\r\nawake me? Is it you, son of my goddess; God of my body and my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios made as if to retreat. With one bound, she was close to him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you fear?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor you I am not the woman before whom\r\nall tremble, because she is surrounded by the might of the High Priest.\r\nForget my name, Demetrios. In their lovers\xe2\x80\x99 arms, women have no name. I\r\nam no longer what you think. I am nothing but a woman who loves and\r\nwhose yearning for you fills her frame as far as the points of her\r\nbreasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios did not open his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me a little while longer,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI know who enthrals\r\nyou. I will not even be your mistress, nor make the least attempt to\r\nrival the queen. No, Demetrios. Do with me as you will. Take me like\r\nsome little slave-wench that a man possesses for a few minutes, leaving\r\nher afterwards with a remembrance that becomes oblivion. Take me like\r\nthe lowest poverty-stricken harlot who, crouching by the roadside,\r\nawaits the charity of some furtive and brutal attack of lust. After\r\nall, what am I to place myself above those women? Have the Immortals\r\ngiven me anything more than that with which they have endowed the most\r\nservile of all my slaves? You, at least, are Beauty incarnate, with its\r\nout spreading emanations of the Gods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios, more steadfastly serious than before, pierced her with his\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWretched creature, what do you suppose emanates from the Gods, if it\r\nbe not. \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mean you?\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, starting to her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath! Yes,\r\nDeath indeed! But it is so far off for me! In sixty years\xe2\x80\x99 time, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthink of my end. Why speak to me of Death, Demetrios?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeath this very night!\xe2\x80\x9d he said quietly.\r\n\r\nShe laughed outright, in sheer fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight? No, no! Who says so? Why should I die? Answer me! Speak! What\r\nmeans this vile mockery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are condemned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy your destiny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow know you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause my destiny is interwoven with yours, Touni.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it my fate to die now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is your lot to die by my hand, on that bench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized her wrist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios!\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, affrighted. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll not shriek! I\xe2\x80\x99ll not call\r\nfor aid! Only let me speak first!\xe2\x80\x9d She wiped the sweat from her brow.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf death\xe2\x80\x94should come from you\xe2\x80\x94death will be sweet\xe2\x80\x94for me. I accept it;\r\nI desire it, but hearken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStaggering from stone to stone, she led him away in the dark night of\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince in your hands are all the gifts of the Gods,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe first thrill of life and the final throb of agony, let both your\r\npalms, bestowing all they hold, be opened to my eyes, Demetrios. Give\r\nme the hand of Love as well as that of Death. If you do this, I die\r\nwithout regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no reply in the vague look he gave her, but she thought she\r\nread the \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d he had not uttered.\r\n\r\nTransfigured a second time, she lifted towards him a new face, where\r\ndesire, born again, drove, with the strength of desperation, all terror\r\naway.\r\n\r\nill-031\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios!\xe2\x80\x9d she stammered, affrighted._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe spoke no more, but already between her lips that were never to\r\nclose again, each breath she drew sang a soft song, as if she was\r\nbeginning to feel the deepest voluptuousness of love before even being\r\ngripped in the conjunction she craved.\r\n\r\nill-032\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she gained this supreme victory.\r\n\r\nWith one movement, she tore off her light tunic and rolled it up into a\r\nball of muslin that she threw behind her, smiling with scarce a vestige\r\nof sadness. Her young and slender body was outstretched in such great\r\nand lively felicity that it was impossible for it not to be eternal,\r\nand as her preoccupied lover, who perhaps was merely anxiously\r\nhesitating, terminated the work of Love without beginning that of\r\nDeath, she suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Kill me! Kill me, I say, Demetrios! Why do you tarry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose up a little, resting on his hands; looked once more at Touni,\r\nwhose great eyes peered ecstatically in his face, from beneath him, and\r\ndrawing out one of the long, golden hairpins that glittered behind her\r\nears, he drove it deliberately home under her left breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nMOONLIGHT\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this woman would have given him her comb and her hair\r\nalso, for love\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nIf he did not ask for it, it was because he had scruples. Chrysis had\r\nvery categorically demanded a crime, and not such or such old jewel\r\nstuck in a young woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair. That is why he considered it his duty to\r\nconsent to bloodshed.\r\n\r\nHe might have reflected, too, that the vows one makes to women during\r\nthe first heat of passion may be forgotten in the interval without any\r\ngreat detriment to the moral worth of the lover who has sworn them, and\r\nthat if ever this involuntary forgetfulness deserved to be excused it\r\nwas certainly in a case where the life of another woman, assuredly\r\ninnocent, was also in the scales. But Demetrios did not trouble himself\r\nwith this method of reasoning. The adventure upon which he was engaged\r\nseemed to him too curious to allow of his juggling away its violent\r\nincidents. He was afraid that, later on, he might regret having cut out\r\nof the plot a scene which, though short, was indispensable for the\r\nbeauty of the _ensemble_. A feeble truckling to virtue is often all\r\nthat is required to reduce a tragedy to the common-places of everyday\r\nexistence. The death of Cassandra, he mused, is not absolutely\r\nnecessary for the development of Agamemnon; but if it had not taken\r\nplace, the whole Orestes Trilogy would have been spoilt.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after cutting the storied comb out of Touni\xe2\x80\x99s hair, he stowed\r\nit away in his garments, and, without further reflection thereon,\r\nundertook the third of the labours ordained by Chrysis: the seizing of\r\nAphrodite\xe2\x80\x99s necklace.\r\n\r\nIt was useless to dream of entering the temple by the main door. The\r\ntwelve hermaphrodites who guarded the entrance would certainly have\r\nallowed Demetrios to pass, in spite of the order directing the\r\nexclusion of every profane person in the absence of the priests; but he\r\nhad no need to prove his future guilt in this ingenuous manner, since a\r\nsecret entrance led to the sanctuary.\r\n\r\nDemetrios betook himself to a part of the wood which sheltered the\r\nNecropolis of the high priests of the goddess. He counted the first\r\ntombs, opened the door of the seventh, and closed it again behind him.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty, for the stone was heavy, he raised the\r\nburial-slab under which a marble staircase plunged down into the earth,\r\nand he descended step by step.\r\n\r\nHe knew that sixty paces were to be made in a straight line, and that\r\nafterwards it would be necessary to feel one\xe2\x80\x99s way along the wall in\r\norder not to knock against the subterranean staircase of the temple.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding freshness of the deep earth calmed him little by little.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he arrived at the limit.\r\n\r\nHe mounted the stairs, and pushed open the trap-door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was clear without, and pitch dark within the divine\r\nenclosure. When he had softly and carefully closed the resounding door,\r\na chill fell upon him, and he felt as though hemmed in by the coldness\r\nof the stones. He dared not raise his eyes. This black silence\r\nterrified him: the darkness became alive with the unknown. He put his\r\nhand to his forehead like a man who does not want to awake for fear of\r\nfinding himself among the living. At last he looked.\r\n\r\nHe saw, in a glory of moonbeams, the dazzling figure of the goddess.\r\nShe stood upon a pedestal of pink stone laden with pendent treasures.\r\nShe was naked and fully sexed, vaguely tinted with the natural colours\r\nof woman. With one hand, she held a mirror with a priapus handle, and\r\nwith the other she adorned her beauty with a seven-stringed pearl\r\nnecklace. One pearl larger than the others, long and silvery, shone\r\nbetween her two nipples like a nocturnal crescent between two rounded\r\nclouds. And they were the real sacred pearls born of the water-drops\r\nwhich had rolled into the shell of Anadyomene.\r\n\r\nill-033\r\n\r\n\r\n_Demetrios lost himself in ineffable adoration._\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios lost himself in ineffable adoration. He believed in very\r\ntruth that Aphrodite herself was there. He did not recognise his\r\nhandiwork, for the abyss between what he had been and what he had\r\nbecome was profound. He stretched out his arms and murmured the\r\nmysterious words of prayer which are used in the Phrygian ceremonies.\r\n\r\nSupernatural, luminous, impalpable, naked, and pure, the vision floated\r\nupon the stone, palpitated gently. He fixed his eyes upon it, dreading\r\nlest the caress of his glance should cause this frail hallucination to\r\ndissolve into thin air. He advanced very softly, touched the pink heel\r\nwith his finger, as if to make sure of the statue\xe2\x80\x99s existence, and,\r\nincapable of resisting the powerful attraction it exercised upon him,\r\nmounted to its side, laid his hands upon the white shoulders, and gazed\r\ninto its eyes.\r\n\r\nHe trembled, he grew faint, he began to laugh with joy. His hands\r\nwandered over the naked arms, pressed the hard, cold bust, descended\r\nalong the legs, caressed the globe of the belly. He hugged this\r\nimmortality to his breast with all his might. He looked at himself in\r\nthe mirror, he lifted up the pearl necklace, he took it off, he made it\r\nglitter in the moonlight, and put it back again, fearfully. He kissed\r\nthe bended hand, the round neck, the wave-like throat, the parted\r\nmarble lips. Then he stepped back to the edge of the pedestal, and,\r\ntaking the divine arms in his hands, tenderly gazed at the adorable\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe hair was dressed in the Oriental style, and veiled the forehead\r\nslightly. The half-closed eyes prolonged themselves in a smile. The\r\nlips were parted, as in the swoon of a kiss. He silently arranged the\r\nseven rows of pearls upon the glittering breast, and descended to the\r\nground to contemplate the idol at a distance.\r\n\r\nThen he became conscious of an awakening. He remembered what he had\r\ncome to do, what he had wished to accomplish, what he had barely\r\nescaped accomplishing: a monstrous deed. He flushed to the temples.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of Chrysis passed before his memory like a vision of\r\ngrossness. He enumerated all the flaws in her beauty: the thick lips,\r\nthe heavy knees, the loose gait. He had forgotten what her hands were\r\nlike; but he imagined them large, to add an odious detail to the image\r\nhe abhorred. His mental state became similar to that of a man surprised\r\nat dawn by his mistress in the bed of an ignoble prostitute, and unable\r\nto explain to himself how he had allowed himself to be tempted the\r\nnight before. He could find neither an excuse nor a serious reason.\r\nEvidently, throughout one day, he had been the victim of a sort of\r\ntemporary madness, a physical perturbation, a disease. He felt that he\r\nwas cured, though still drunk with giddiness.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete his recovery, he planted himself against the\r\ntemple wall and remained standing for a long time before the statue.\r\nThe light of the moon continued to descend through the square opening\r\nin the roof; Aphrodite was resplendent; and, as the eyes were veiled in\r\nshade, he sought to meet their glance.\r\n\r\nThe whole night passed thus. Then daylight came and the statue took on\r\nin succession the rosy lividness of the dawn and the gilded reflection\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nDemetrios had ceased to think. The ivory comb and the silver mirror\r\nwhich he carried in his tunic had slipped from his memory. He abandoned\r\nhimself voluptuously to serene contemplation.\r\n\r\nOutside, a tempest of bird-songs twittered, whistled, sang in the\r\ngarden. Women\xe2\x80\x99s voices were heard, talking and laughing at the foot of\r\nthe walls. The bustle of the early morning arose from the awakened\r\nearth. Demetrios experienced nothing but feelings of bliss.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already high, and the shadow of the roof had already\r\nshifted when he heard a confused sound of light feet upon the outer\r\nflight of steps.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless a sacrifice to be offered to the goddess, a procession\r\nof young women coming to carry out or utter vows before the statue, for\r\nthe first day of the Aphrodisi\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nDemetrios resolved to fly.\r\n\r\nThe sacred pedestal opened at the back, in a way known only to the\r\npriests and the sculptor. It was there that the hierophant stood to\r\ndictate to a young girl whose voice was clear and high the miraculous\r\ndiscourses which issued from the statue on the third day of the f\xc3\xaate.\r\nThence one might reach the gardens. Demetrios entered, and stopped\r\nbefore the bronze-plated openings which pierced the massive stone.\r\n\r\nThe two golden doors swung heavily open. Then the procession entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE INVITATION\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the night, Chrysis was awakened by three knocks\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nShe had slept all day between the two Ephesians, and, but for the\r\ndisorder of their bed, they might have been taken for three sisters\r\ntogether. The Galil\xc3\xa6an\xe2\x80\x99s thigh, bathed in perspiration, rested heavily\r\nupon Rhodis nestling up against her hostess. Myrtocleia was asleep upon\r\nher breast, with her face in her arm and her back uncovered.\r\n\r\nA sound of voices was heard in the entrance.\r\n\r\nChrysis disengaged herself with great care, stepping over her\r\ncompanions, and getting down from the couch, held the door ajar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it, Djala? Who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Naukrates who wants to see you. I have told him you are not at\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense! Certainly I am at liberty! Enter, Naukrates, I am in my\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she went back to bed.\r\n\r\nill-034\r\n\r\n\r\nNaukrates remained for some time on the threshold, as if fearing to\r\ncommit an indiscretion. The two music-girls opened their sleep-laden\r\neyes and made efforts to tear themselves away from their dreams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for coquetry between us. I\r\nknow that you do not come for me. What do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaukrates was a philosopher of repute, who had been Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s lover for\r\nmore than twenty years, and did not deceive her, more from indolence\r\nthan fidelity. His grey hair was cut short, his beard pointed \xc3\xa0 la\r\nDemosthenes, and his moustache cropped so as not to hide his lips. He\r\nwore a large white garment made of simple wool with a plain stripe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the bearer of an invitation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBacchis is giving a\r\ndinner to-morrow, to be followed by a f\xc3\xaate. We shall be seven, with\r\nyou. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fail to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA f\xc3\xaate? A propos of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is to liberate her most beautiful slave, Aphrodisia. There will be\r\ndancing-girls and flute-girls. I think that your two friends are\r\nengaged to be there, and, as a matter of fact, they ought not to be\r\nhere now. The rehearsal is going on at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s at this very moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rhodis, \xe2\x80\x9cwe had forgotten about it. Get up,\r\nMyrto, we are very late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chrysis protested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet! how disagreeable of you to steal away my women. If I had\r\nsuspected that, I would not have let you in. Why, they are actually\r\nready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur robes are not complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d said the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we are not\r\nbeautiful enough to spend much time in dressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you at the temple, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to-morrow morning, we are going to offer doves. I am taking a\r\ndrachma out of your purse, Chrysis, otherwise we should have nothing to\r\nbuy them with. Good-bye till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey ran out. Naucrates considered for a short time the door that had\r\njust closed upon them; then he folded his arms and, turning round to\r\nChrysis, said in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Your behaviour is charming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne woman is not enough for you. You must have two, now. You even pick\r\nthem up in the street. It is a noble example you are setting. But\r\nkindly tell me what is to become of us men? You have all got little\r\n_amies_, and after quitting their insatiable arms, you have just as\r\nmuch passion to offer as they are willing to leave you. Do you think\r\nthis can go on indefinitely? If things continue like this, we shall be\r\nforced to apply to Bathyllos . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will never get me to admit that! I know\r\nwell that people make the comparison, but it is entirely absurd; and I\r\nam astonished that you, who pretend to be a thinker, do not understand\r\nhow ridiculous it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what difference do you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a question of difference. There is no connection between the\r\none and the other: that\xe2\x80\x99s clear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say you are wrong. I want to know your reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I can tell them you in two words: listen carefully. From the point\r\nof view of love, woman is a perfect instrument. From head to foot she\r\nis constructed, solely, marvellously, for love. _She alone knows how to\r\nlove. She alone knows how to be loved._ Consequently, if a couple of\r\nlovers is composed of two women, it is perfect; if there is only one\r\nwoman, it is only half as good; if there is no woman at all, it is\r\npurely idiotic. That is all I have to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are hard on Plato, my girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat men are not, any more than the gods, great under all\r\ncircumstances. Pallas understands nothing about painting; Plato did not\r\nknow how to love. Philosophers, poets, or rhetoricians, all who follow\r\nhim, are as worthless as their master, and however admirable they may\r\nbe in their art, in love they are devoid of knowledge. Believe me,\r\nNaukrates, I feel that I am right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe philosopher made a gesture.\r\n\r\nill-035\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell Bacchis that she may count on you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are somewhat wanting in reverence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not by any\r\nmeans think you are wrong. My indignation was not real. There is\r\nsomething charming in the union of two young women, on condition that\r\nthey both consent to remain feminine, keep their hair long, uncover\r\ntheir breasts, and refrain from arming themselves with adventitious\r\ninstruments, as if they were illogically envious of the gross sex for\r\nwhich they profess such a pretty contempt. Yes, their liaison is\r\nremarkable because their caresses are entirely superficial, and the\r\nquality of their sensual satisfaction is all the more refined. They do\r\nnot clasp one another in a violent embrace, they touch one another\r\nlightly in order to taste of the supreme joy. Their wedding-night is\r\nnot defiled with blood. They are virgins, Chrysis. They are ignorant of\r\nthe brutal action; this constitutes their superiority over Bathyllos,\r\nwho maintains that he offers the equivalent, forgetting that you also,\r\neven in this sorry respect, could enter into competition with him.\r\nHuman love is to be distinguished from the rut of animals only by two\r\ndivine functions: the caress and the kiss. Now these are the only two\r\nfunctions known to the women in question. They have even brought them\r\nto perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis in astonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then what have you to\r\nreproach me with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy grievance is that there are a hundred thousand of you. Already a\r\ngreat number of women only derive perfect pleasure from their own sex.\r\nSoon you will refuse to receive us altogether, even as a makeshift. It\r\nis from jealousy that I blame you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point Naukrates considered that the conversation had lasted\r\nlong enough, and he rose to his feet, simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell Bacchis that she may count on you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Chrysis.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher kissed her knees and slowly went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she joined her hands together and spoke aloud though she was\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBacchis . . . Bacchis . . . he comes from her house and he does not\r\nknow! The mirror is still there, then! . . . Demetrios has forgotten me\r\n. . . If he has hesitated the first day, I am lost, he will do nothing.\r\nBut is it possible that all is finished? Bacchis has other mirrors\r\nwhich she uses more often. Doubtless she does not know yet. Gods! Gods!\r\nno means of having news, and perhaps . . . Ah! Djala! Djala!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slave-woman entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my knuckle-bones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell my own\r\nfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tossed the four little bones into the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh . . . Oh . . . Djala, look! the Aphrodite throw!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the name given to a very rare throw whereby all the\r\nknuckle-bones presented a different face. The odds against this\r\ncombination were exactly thirty-five to one. It was the best throw in\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nDjala remarked coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you ask for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis, disappointed. \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot to wish. I\r\ncertainly had something in my mind, but I said nothing. Does that count\r\nall the same?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not; you must begin again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis cast the bones again.\r\n\r\nill-036\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Midas throw, this time. What do you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne cannot tell. Good or bad. It is a throw which is interpreted by\r\nthe next one. Now start with a single bone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis consulted the game a third time; but as soon as the bone fell,\r\nshe stammered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe . . . the Chian ace!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she burst into sobs.\r\n\r\nDjala too was uneasy, and said nothing. Chrysis wept upon the bed, with\r\nher hair lying in confusion about her head. At last she turned round\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you make me begin again? I am sure the first throw counted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wished, yes. If not, no. You alone know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Djala.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the bones prove nothing. It is a Greek game. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe\r\nin it. I shall try something else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe dried her tears and crossed the room. She took a box of white\r\ncounters from a shelf, counted out twenty-two, then with the point of a\r\npearl clasp, engraved in succession the twenty-two letters of the\r\nHebrew alphabet. They were the arcana of the Cabbala she had learnt in\r\nGalilee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have confidence in this. This does not deceive\xe2\x80\x9d, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLift up\r\nthe skirt of your robe; I will use it as a bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe cast the twenty-two counters into the slave\xe2\x80\x99s tunic, repeating\r\nmentally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I wear Aphrodite\xe2\x80\x99s necklace? Shall I wear Aphrodite\xe2\x80\x99s necklace?\r\nShall I wear Aphrodite\xe2\x80\x99s necklace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she drew the tenth arcanam, and this signified plainly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-037\r\n\r\n\r\n_An old white-bearded priest preceded the youthful band._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nCHRYSIS\xe2\x80\x99S ROSE\r\n\r\nIt was a procession, white and blue and yellow and pink and green.\r\n\r\nThirty courtesans advanced, bearing baskets of flowers, snow-white\r\ndoves with red feet, veils of the most fragile azure, and precious\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nAn old white-bearded priest, swathed to the head in stiff unbleached\r\ncloth, preceded the youthful band and guided the line of bending\r\nworshippers to the altar of stone.\r\n\r\nThey sang, and their song languished like the sea, sighed like a\r\nsouthern breeze, panted like an amorous mouth. The first two carried\r\nharps which they rested upon the hollow of their left hand and which\r\ncurved forward like sickles of slender wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of them advanced and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTryphera, O beloved Cypris, offers thee this blue veil which she has\r\nwoven herself, that thou mayest continue to deal gently with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMousarion places at thy feet, O goddess of the beautiful coronal,\r\nthese wreaths of wall-flowers and this bouquet of drooping daffodils.\r\nShe has borne them in the orgie and has invoked thy name in the wild\r\necstasy of their perfumes, O! victorious one! have respect to these\r\nspoils of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYet another:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs an offering to thee, golden Cytherea, Timo consecrates this spiral\r\nbracelet. Mayest thou entwine vengeance round the throat of her thou\r\nwottest of, even as this silver serpent entwined itself around her\r\nnaked arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia and Rhodis advanced, holding one another by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two doves of Smyrna, with wings white as caresses, with feet\r\nred as kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! double goddess of Amathontis, accept them of our joined hands, if\r\nit be true that the tender Adonis is not alone sufficient for thee and\r\nthat sometimes thy sleep is retarded by a yet sweeter embrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA very young courtesan followed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAphrodite Peribasia, receive my virginity with this blood-stained\r\ntunic. I am Pannychis of Pharos: I have dedicated myself to thee since\r\nlast night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDorothea conjures thee, O charitable Epistrophia to remove far from\r\nher spirit the desire that Eros has implanted in it, or else to inflame\r\nfor her the eyes of him that says her nay. She offers thee this branch\r\nof myrtle, because it is the tree thou lovest best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn thine altar, O Paphia, Callistion places sixty silver drachm\xc3\xa6, the\r\nbalance of four min\xc3\xa6 she received from Cleomenos. Give her a lover\r\nstill more generous if thou thinkest it a goodly offering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained before the altar only a blushing little child who had\r\noccupied the last place in the procession. She held nothing in her hand\r\nbut a little crocus wreath, and the priest scorned her for the poverty\r\nof her offering.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not rich enough to give you silver coins, O glittering Olympian\r\ngoddess. Besides, what could I give thee that thou lackest? Here are\r\nflowers, yellow and green, pleated into a wreath for thy feet. And now\r\n. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe unbuckled the clasps of her tunic; the tissue slipped down to the\r\nground and she stood revealed quite naked.\r\n\r\n. . . \xe2\x80\x9cI dedicate myself to thee body and soul, beloved goddess. I\r\ndesire to enter thy gardens and die a courtesan of the temple. I swear\r\nto desire naught but love, I swear to love but to love, I renounce the\r\nworld and I shut myself up in thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the priest covered her with perfumes and enveloped her nudity in\r\nthe veil woven by Tryphera. They left the nave together by the door\r\nopening into the gardens.\r\n\r\nill-038\r\n\r\n\r\nThe procession seemed at an end, and the other courtesans were about to\r\nretrace their steps when another woman, a belated arrival, was seen\r\nupon the threshold. She had nothing in her hand, and it seemed as if\r\nshe also had naught but her beauty to offer. Her hair appeared as two\r\nstreams of gold, two deep waves full of shade, which engulfed the ears\r\nand were twisted in seven rolls over the back of the neck. The nose was\r\ndelicate, with expressive nostrils which palpitated at times over a\r\nthick painted mouth, the corners rounded and throbbing. The flexible\r\nline of the body undulated at every step, animated by the rolling of\r\nthe hips or the oscillation of the breasts, under which bent the supple\r\nwaist.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were extraordinary: blue but dark and bright at the same time,\r\nchanging and glinting like moonstones, half closed under drooping\r\nlashes. Those eyes looked, as sirens sing . . .\r\n\r\nThe priest turned towards her, waiting for her to speak.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis, O Chryseia, supplicates thee. Accept the poor gifts she lays\r\nat thy feet. Hear, love, and solace her that lives after thine example\r\nand for the cult of thy name, and grant her her prayers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hands gilded with rings, and bent low with her legs\r\nclose together.\r\n\r\nThe vague canticle began again. The murmur of the harps rose up towards\r\nthe statue with the swirling fumes of crackling incense from the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s censer.\r\n\r\nill-039\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cTo thee, O Hetaira! . . . Chrysis consecrates her necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up slowly to her full height and offered a bronze\r\nmirror which hung from her girdle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thee, Astarte of the Night, that joinest hand to hand and lip to\r\nlip, and whose symbol is like to the footprint of the deer upon the\r\npale soil of Syria, Chrysis consecrates her mirror. It has seen the\r\nhaggard darkness of the eyelids and the glitter of the eyes after love,\r\nthe hair glued to the temples by the sweat of thy battles, O!\r\nwarrior-queen of ruthless hand, thou that joinest body to body and\r\nmouth to mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe priest laid the mirror at the feet of the statue. Chrysis drew from\r\nher golden hair a long comb of red copper, the planetary metal of the\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thee,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnadyomene, born of the rosy dawn and the\r\nsea-foam\xe2\x80\x99s smile; to thee. O nudity shimmering with tremulous pearls,\r\nthat didst bind thy dripping hair with ribbons of green seaweed,\r\nChrysis consecrates her comb. It has plunged into her hair tossed by\r\nthy convulsions, O furiously-panting mistress of Adonis, that furrowest\r\nthe camber of the loins and racks the stiffening knee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gave the comb to the old man and inclined her head to the right in\r\norder to take off her emerald necklace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo thee\xe2\x80\x9d, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cO! Hetaira, that drivest away the blushes of\r\nshamefaced maidens and promptest the lewd laugh, for whom we sell the\r\nlove that streams from our entrails, Chrysis consecrates her necklace.\r\nIt was given to her for her fee by a man whose name she knows not, and\r\neach emerald is a kiss on which thou hast lived an instant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nill-040\r\n\r\n\r\nShe made a last and more prolonged reverence, put the collar into the\r\npriest\xe2\x80\x99s hand and took a step as if to depart.\r\n\r\nThe priest stayed her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you ask of the goddess for these precious offerings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, smiled, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she passed along the procession, stole a rose from a basket, and\r\nput it in her mouth as she went out.\r\n\r\nOne by one all the women followed. The door closed upon the empty\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios remained alone, concealed in the bronze pedestal.\r\n\r\nHe had not lost a gesture or a word of all this scene, and when\r\neverything was over, he remained motionless for a long time, harassed\r\nby new torments, passionate, irresolute.\r\n\r\nHe had thought himself quite cured of his madness of the night before,\r\nand had believed that henceforth nothing could throw him a second time\r\ninto the ardent shadow of this strange woman.\r\n\r\nBut he had counted without her.\r\n\r\nWomen! O women! if you wish to be loved, show yourselves, return,\r\npresent yourselves! The emotion he had felt on her entrance was so\r\nentire and overwhelming that it was out of the question to dream of\r\nstruggling against it by a violent effort of the will. Demetrios was\r\nbound like a barbarian slave to a triumphal car. The idea of escape was\r\nan illusion. Without knowing it, and quite naturally, she had made him\r\nher captive.\r\n\r\nHe had seen her coming in the distance, for she wore the same yellow\r\nrobe she had had on the quay. She walked with low, supple steps and\r\nwith languid undulations of the hips. She had come straight to him, as\r\nif she had divined him behind the stone.\r\n\r\nHe realised from the first instant that he was ready once more to fall\r\nat her feet. When she drew the mirror of polished bronze from her\r\ngirdle, she looked at herself in it for the last time before giving it\r\nto the priest, and the brilliancy of her eyes became stupefying. When,\r\nin order to take her copper comb, she laid her hand upon her hair and\r\nraised her bended arm, in conformity with the gesture of the Graces,\r\nthe beautiful line of her body revealed itself under the tissue, and\r\nthe sun illumined a tiny dew of brilliant sweat under her armpit.\r\nFinally, when, in order to lift up and unbuckle her necklace of heavy\r\nemeralds, she parted the pleated silk that veiled her double bosom down\r\nto the sweet shade-hidden place that admits of nothing more than a\r\nbouquet being slipped into it, Demetrios was seized with such a\r\nfrenzied desire to put his lips upon it and tear off the whole dress\r\nthat . . . But Chrysis began to speak.\r\n\r\nShe spoke, and every one of her words was torture to him. She seemed\r\nwantonly to insist and enlarge upon the prostitution of the vase of\r\nbeauty that she was, white as the statue itself, and full of\r\noverflowing gold streaming down in a shower of hair. She told how her\r\ndoor was open to the lounging passer-by, how her body was delivered\r\nover to the contemplation of the unworthy, how the task of firing her\r\ncheeks with the flush of passion was committed to clumsy children. She\r\nspoke of the venal fatigue of her eyes, of her lips hired by the night,\r\nof her hair entrusted to brutal hands, of her divinity crucified.\r\n\r\nEven the exceeding facility of her access was a charm in Demetrios\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes, though he was resolved to use it solely for his own benefit and\r\nto close the door behind him. For it is profoundly true that a woman\r\nonly reaches the utmost limit of her seductiveness when she gives\r\noccasion for jealousy.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having given the goddess her green necklace in exchange for the\r\none she hoped for. Chrysis returned to the town carrying a human will\r\nin her mouth, like the little stolen rose whose stalk she was nibbling.\r\n\r\nDemetrios waited until he was left alone in the temple; then he issued\r\nforth from his retreat.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the statue apprehensively, expecting an infernal inward\r\nstruggle. But, being incapable of renewing a violent emotion at so\r\nshort an interval of time, he once more became astonishingly calm,\r\nwithout premature remorse.\r\n\r\nNegligently, tranquilly, he climbed close up to the statue, took the\r\nnecklace of true pearls from off Anadyomene\xe2\x80\x99s neck, and slipped it into\r\nhis raiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTHE TALE OF THE ENCHANTED LYRE\r\n\r\nHe walked very rapidly, hoping to overtake Chrysis in the road which\r\nled to the town. He was afraid that if he delayed any further he might\r\nonce again lose his courage and his power of will.\r\n\r\nThe white, hot road was so luminous that Demetrios closed his eyes as\r\nif the midday sun was shining. He was walking in this way without\r\nlooking in front of him, when he narrowly escaped colliding with four\r\nblack slaves who were marching at the head of a fresh procession.\r\nSuddenly a musical little voice said softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-beloved, how glad I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his head: it was Queen Berenice leaning on her elbow in her\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\nShe gave the order:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, porters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd held out her arms to her lover.\r\n\r\nDemetrios was greatly put out, but he could not refuse, and he got in\r\nsulkily.\r\n\r\nThen Queen Berenice, beside herself with joy, crawled on her hands and\r\nknees to the far end, and rolled in the cushions like a playful kitten.\r\n\r\nFor this litter was a chamber carried by four and twenty slaves. It\r\nafforded ample room for twelve women to recline in it at random, upon a\r\nthick blue carpet strewn with stuffs and cushions; and its height was\r\nso great that one could not touch the roof, even with the tip of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfan. Its length was greater than its width, and it was closed in front\r\nand on the three sides by very fine yellow curtains which scintillated\r\nwith light. The back was of cedar-wood, draped in a long veil of\r\norange-coloured silk. At the top of this splendid wall, the great\r\ngolden hawk of Egypt hung grimly with its two wings extended to their\r\nfull extent. Lower down, carved in ivory and silver, the antique symbol\r\nof Astarte gaped above a lighted lamp whose rays strove with the\r\ndaylight in elusive reflections. Underneath, lay Queen Berenice, fanned\r\non either side by two Persian slave women, waving two tufts of\r\npeacock\xe2\x80\x99s feathers.\r\n\r\nShe beckoned the young sculptor to her side with her eyes, and\r\nrepeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-beloved, I am happy!\xe2\x80\x9d She stroked his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for you, Well-beloved. Where were you? I have not seen\r\nyou since the day before yesterday. If I had not met you I should soon\r\nhave died of grief. I was so unhappy all alone in this great litter. I\r\nhave thrown all my jewels over the bridge of Hermes, to make circles in\r\nthe water. You see I have neither rings nor necklace. I look like a\r\nlittle pauper at your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned round to him and kissed him on the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe two fan-bearers sat down upon their haunches a little further off,\r\nand when Queen Berenice began to speak in a low tone, they put their\r\nfingers close to their ears in order to make a semblance of not\r\nhearing. But Demetrios did not answer, barely listened, remained like\r\none bewildered. He saw of the young queen nothing but the red smile of\r\nher mouth and the black cushion of her hair which she always wore\r\nloosely bound in order to be able to rest her weary head upon it.\r\n\r\nill-041\r\n\r\n\r\n_But Demetrios did not answer._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-beloved, I have wept during the night. My bed was cold. When I\r\nawoke, I stretched my naked arms to my two sides and I did not find\r\nyou, and my hand nowhere met the hand I embrace to-day. I waited for\r\nyou in the morning, and you had not been since the full moon. I sent\r\nslaves into all the quarters of the town and I had them executed when\r\nthey came back without you. Where were you? were you at the temple? you\r\nwere not in the garden with those strange women? No, I see by your eyes\r\nthat you have not loved. Then what were you doing far away from me? You\r\nwere before the statue? Yes, I am sure you were there. You love it more\r\nthan me now. It is exactly like me, it has my eyes, my mouth, my\r\nbreasts, but it is the statue that you treasure. I am a poor deserted\r\nwoman. I weary you, and I see it well. You think of your marble and\r\nyour ugly statues as if I were not more beautiful than all of them,\r\nand, in addition, alive, amorous, and tender, ready to grant you\r\nwhatever you are willing to accept, resigned whenever you refuse. But\r\nyou want nothing. You have refused to be a king, you have refused to be\r\na god and be adored in a temple of your own. You almost refuse to love\r\nme now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gathered her feet under her and leaned upon her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would do anything to see you at the palace, Well-beloved. If you do\r\nnot want me any longer, tell me who it is that attracts you, she shall\r\nbe my friend. The . . . the women of my court . . . are beautiful. I\r\nhave a dozen also who have been kept in ignorance of the very existence\r\nof men. They shall all be your mistresses if you will come to see me\r\nafter them. . . And I have others with me who have had more lovers than\r\nthe sacred courtesans and are expert in love. Choose which you will, I\r\nhave also a thousand foreign slave-women; you shall have any of them\r\nyou please. I will dress them like myself, in yellow silk and silver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no, you are the most beautiful and the coldest of men. You love no\r\none, you suffer yourself to be loved, you lend yourself, out of\r\ncharity, to those who are captured by your eyes. You permit me to have\r\nmy pleasure of you, but as an animal allows itself to be milked,\r\nlooking somewhere else all the time. Ah! Gods! Ah! Gods! I shall end by\r\nbeing able to do without you, young coxcomb that the whole town adores,\r\nand from whom no woman can draw tears. I have other than women at the\r\npalace; I have sturdy Ethiopians with chests of bronze and arms bulging\r\nout with muscles. In their embrace, I shall soon forget your womanish\r\nlegs and your pretty beard. The spectacle of their passion will\r\ndoubtless be a new one for me, and I shall give my amorousness a rest.\r\nBut the day I am certain that your eyes have ceased to trouble me by\r\ntheir absence, and that I can replace your mouth, then I shall despatch\r\nyou from the top of the bridge of Hermes to join my necklace and my\r\nrings like a jewel I have worn too long. Ah! what it is to be a queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sat up and seemed as if waiting. But Demetrios remained impassive,\r\nand did not move a muscle, as if he had not heard her. She resumed\r\nangrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not understood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned carelessly upon his elbow and said quietly and unmovedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought of a tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong ago, long before the conquest of Thrace by your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nancestors, it was inhabited by wild beasts and a few timorous men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe animals were very beautiful: there were lions tawny as the sun,\r\ntigers striped like the evening, and bears black as night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe men were little and flat-nosed, covered with old, worn skins,\r\narmed with rude lances and bows without beauty. They shut themselves up\r\nin mountain holes, behind huge stones which they moved with difficulty.\r\nThey passed their lives at the chase. There was blood in the forests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe country was so forlorn that the gods had deserted it. When Artemis\r\nleft Olympus in the whiteness of the morning, she never took the path\r\nwhich would have led her to the North. The wars which were waged there\r\ndid not disturb Ares. The absence of pipes and flutes repelled Apollo.\r\nThe triple Hecate alone shone in solitude, like the face of a Medusa\r\nupon a petrified land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, there came to live in that country a man of more favoured race,\r\none who did not dress in skin like the mountain savages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wore a long white robe which trailed behind him a little. He loved\r\nto wander at night in the calm forest-glades by the light of the moon,\r\nholding in his hand a little tortoise-shell in which were fixed two\r\nauroch-horns. Between these horns were stretched three silver strings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen his fingers touched the strings, delicious music passed over\r\nthem, much sweeter than the sound of fountains, or the murmur of the\r\nwind in the trees, or the swaying of the barley. The first time he\r\nplayed, three sleepy tigers awoke, so prodigiously charmed that they\r\ndid him no harm, but approached as near as they could and retired when\r\nhe ceased. On the morrow there were many more, and wolves also, and\r\nhyenas, and snakes poised upright on their tails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a very short time the animals came of their own accord, and\r\nbegged him to play to them. A bear would often come quite alone to him\r\nand go away enchanted on hearing three marvellous chords. In return for\r\nhis favours, the wild beasts provided him with food and protected him\r\nagainst the men.\r\n\r\nill-042\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he tired of this tedious life. He became so certain of his genius,\r\nand of the pleasure he afforded to the beasts, that he ceased to care\r\nto play well. The animals were always satisfied, so long as it was he\r\nwho played. Soon he refused even to give them this satisfaction, and\r\nstopped playing altogether, from indifference. The whole forest\r\nmourned, but for all that the musician\xe2\x80\x99s threshold did not lack savoury\r\nmeats and fruits. They continued to nourish him, and loved him all the\r\nmore. The hearts of beasts are so constructed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow one day, he was leaning against his open door, looking at the\r\nsunset behind the motionless trees, when a lioness happened to pass by.\r\nHe took a step inside as if he feared tiresome solicitations. The\r\nlioness did not trouble about him, and simply passed by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he asked her in astonishment; \xe2\x80\x98Why do you not beg me to play?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe answered that she cared nothing about it. He said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Do you\r\nnot know me?\xe2\x80\x99 She answered: \xe2\x80\x98You are Orpheus.\xe2\x80\x99 He answered: \xe2\x80\x98And you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear Me?\xe2\x80\x99 She repeated, \xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98oh! how I\r\nam to be pitied! It is just for you that I should have liked to play.\r\nYou are much more beautiful than the others, and you must understand so\r\nmuch better. If you will listen to me one little hour, I will give you\r\neverything you can dream of.\xe2\x80\x99 She answered: \xe2\x80\x98Steal the fresh meats that\r\nbelong to the men of the plain. Assassinate the first person you meet.\r\nTake the victims they have offered to your gods, and lay all at my\r\nfeet.\xe2\x80\x99 He thanked her for the moderation of her demands, and did what\r\nshe required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor one hour he played before her: but afterwards he broke his lyre\r\nand lived as if he were dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe queen sighed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never understand allegories. Explain it to me, Well-beloved. What\r\ndoes it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not tell you this in order that you may understand. I have told\r\nyou a tale to calm you a little. It is late. Good-bye, Berenice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to weep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sure of it! I was sure of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid her like a child upon her soft bed of luxurious stuffs,\r\nimprinted a smiling kiss upon her unhappy eyes, and tranquilly\r\ndescended from the great litter without stopping it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE ARRIVAL\r\n\r\nBacchis had been a courtesan for more than twenty-five years. That is\r\nequivalent to saying that she was nearly forty, and that her beauty had\r\nchanged its character several times.\r\n\r\nHer mother, who had long been the directress of the house and her\r\ngeneral adviser, had given her principles of conduct and economy which\r\nhad enabled her gradually to acquire a great fortune, which she was in\r\na position to spend freely, at an age when the magnificence of the bed\r\nsupplies the place of physical splendour.\r\n\r\nThus it was that instead of buying adult slaves at the market at a high\r\nrate, an expense which so many others considered necessary, and which\r\nruined the young courtesans, she had been content for ten years with a\r\nsingle negress, and had provided for the future by making her beget a\r\nchild every year, in order to create for herself, for nothing, a\r\nnumerous staff of domestics who should be a source of riches later on.\r\n\r\nAs she had chosen the father with care, seven very beautiful mulatto\r\ngirls had been born of her slave, and also three boys whom she had\r\nkilled, because male slaves give useless suspicions to jealous lovers.\r\nShe had named the seven daughters after the seven planets, and had\r\nchosen them diverse functions, in harmony, as far as possible, with the\r\nnames they bore. Heliope was the slave for the day-time, Selene for the\r\nnight, Aretias guarded the door, Aphrodisia tended the bed, Hermione\r\ndid the buying, and Cronomagira, the cooking. Finally, Diomeda, the\r\nhousekeeper, kept the books and superintended the staff.\r\n\r\nAphrodisia was the favourite slave, the prettiest and best-loved. She\r\noften shared her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s bed at the request of lovers who took a\r\nfancy to her. Consequently, she was dispensed from all servile work in\r\norder that her arms might be kept delicate and her hands soft. By an\r\nexceptional favour, her hair was not covered, so that she was often\r\ntaken for a free woman, and that very night she was to be freed in\r\nreality at the enormous price of thirty-five min\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nill-043\r\n\r\n\r\nBacchis\xe2\x80\x99s seven slaves, all tall and admirably trained, were such a\r\nsource of pride to her that she never went out without having them in\r\nher train, at the risk of leaving her house empty. Thanks to this\r\nimprudence, Demetrios had been able to enter her house without\r\ndifficulty; but when she gave the festival to which Chrysis was invited\r\nshe was still in ignorance of the calamity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Chrysis was the first arrival.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a green robe worked with enormous rose-branches\r\nwhich flowered over her breasts.\r\n\r\nAretias opened the door for her without her having to knock, and,\r\naccording to the Greek custom, took her aside into a little room,\r\nuntied her red shoes, and gently washed her naked feet. Then, raising\r\nthe robe, or parting it, according to the place, she perfumed wherever\r\nthere was necessity for it: for the guests were spared every kind of\r\ntrouble, even that of making their toilette before going in to dinner.\r\nThen she offered a comb and pins to restore the lines of her\r\nhead-dress, together with cosmetics, both dry and moist, for her lips\r\nand cheeks.\r\n\r\nAt last, when Chrysis was ready:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the _shades?\xe2\x80\x9d_ she said to the slave.\r\n\r\nThis was the term applied to all the diners, except to one alone, the\r\nguest par excellence. The guest in honour of whom the dinner was given\r\nbrought whomsoever he pleased with him, and the \xe2\x80\x9cshades\xe2\x80\x9d had nothing to\r\ndo but to bring their bed-cushions and prove themselves people of\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nAretias answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaukrates has invited Philodemos with his mistress, Faustina, whom he\r\nhas brought back from Italy. He has also invited Phrasilas and Timon,\r\nand your friend Seso of Cuidos.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-044\r\n\r\n\r\n_Aretias opened the door for her._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeso entered at this precise moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two women embraced, and enlarged with many an exclamation upon the\r\nhappy chance which had brought them together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of being late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seso. \xe2\x80\x9cThat poor Archytas has kept\r\nme. . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Archytas again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always the same thing. Whenever I go out to dine, he imagines\r\nthat my body is to be at everybody\xe2\x80\x99s disposal in turn. Then he insists\r\non having his revenge beforehand, and that takes such a time! Ah! my\r\ndear, if he knew me better! I am far from wanting to deceive my lovers.\r\nI have quite enough of them as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the baby that is coming? It does not show yet, however.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not indeed. It is the third month. It is growing, the little\r\nwretch. But it does not bother me yet. In six weeks I shall begin to\r\ndance. I hope that will prove very unpleasant to it, and that it will\r\ndisappear quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let your shape get disfigured. I\r\nsaw Philemation yesterday, our former little friend, who lived three\r\nyears at Boubaste with a grain merchant. Do you know the first thing\r\nshe said to me? \xe2\x80\x98Ah! if you saw my breasts!\xe2\x80\x99 and she had tears in her\r\neyes. I told her she was still pretty, but she repeated: \xe2\x80\x98If you saw my\r\nbreasts! ah! ah! if you saw my breasts!\xe2\x80\x99 weeping like a Byblis. Then I\r\nsaw that she was almost anxious to show them, and I asked to see them.\r\nMy dear, two empty bags! And you know what beauties she had. They were\r\nso white that the points were invisible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil yours, my Seso.\r\nLeave them fresh and firm as they are. A courtesan\xe2\x80\x99s two breasts are\r\nworth more than her necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, the two women were making their toilette.\r\nFinally they entered the banqueting-room together, where Bacchis was\r\nstanding waiting, with her waist encircled by breast-bands and her neck\r\nloaded with rows of gold necklaces reaching up to the chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my pretty dears, what a good idea on the part of Naukrates to\r\ninvite you both together this evening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe congratulate ourselves on its being to your house that we are\r\ninvited,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Chrysis without appearing to understand the\r\ninnuendo. And, in order to say something venomous immediately, she\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is Doryclos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoryclos was a young and extremely rich lover who had just deserted\r\nBacchis to marry a Sicilian woman.\r\n\r\nill-045\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my pretty dears, what a good idea . . .\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI . . . I have turned him away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bacchis, brazenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; they say he is going to marry out of spite. But I expect him the\r\nday after his marriage. He is madly in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile asking: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is Doryclos?\xe2\x80\x9d Chrysis had thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your\r\nmirror?\xe2\x80\x9d But Bacchis did not look one in the face, and the only\r\nexpression to be read in her eyes was a vague embarrassment devoid of\r\nmeaning. Besides, there was time for Chrysis to elucidate this\r\nquestion, and, in spite of her impatience, she knew how to wait with\r\nresignation for a more favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\nShe was about to continue the conversation, when she was prevented by\r\nthe arrival of Philodemos, Faustina, and Naukrates, which involved\r\nBacchis in fresh interchanges of politeness. They fell into ecstasies\r\nover the poet\xe2\x80\x99s embroidered garment and the diaphanous robe of his\r\nmistress. This young girl, being unfamiliar with Alexandrian usage, had\r\nthought to Hellenize herself in this manner, not knowing that a dress\r\nof the kind was inadmissible at a festival where hired dancing-women,\r\nsimilarly unclothed, were to appear.\r\n\r\nBacchis affected not to notice this error, and in a few amiable phrases\r\ncomplimented Faustina on her heavy blue hair swimming in brilliant\r\nperfumes. She wore her hair raised high above the neck in order to\r\navoid staining her light silken stuffs with myrrh.\r\n\r\nThey were about to sit down to table when the seventh guest arrived; it\r\nwas Timon, a young man whose want of principle was a natural gift, but\r\nwho had discovered in the teaching of the philosophers of his time some\r\nsuperior reasons for self-satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have brought someone with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bacchis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA certain Demo, a girl from Mendes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemo! What can you be thinking of, my dear fellow? She is a street\r\ngirl. She can be had for a fig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood, good. We won\xe2\x80\x99t insist on it.\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just\r\nmade her acquaintance at the corner of the Canopic way. She asked me to\r\ngive her a dinner, and I brought her to you. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want her. .\r\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimon is really extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Bacchis.\r\n\r\nShe called a slave:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeliope, go and tell your sister that she will find a woman at the\r\ndoor and that she is to drive her away with a stick. Off you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned and looked round:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas not Phrasilas come yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE DINNER\r\n\r\nAt these words, a sickly little man, with a grey forehead, grey eyes,\r\nand a small, grey beard, advanced with little steps and said smiling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhrasilas was a polygraph of repute of whom it would have been\r\ndifficult to say exactly whether he was a philosopher, a grammarian, a\r\nhistorian, or a mythologist. He undertook the most weighty studies with\r\ntimid ardour and ephemeral curiosity. Write a treatise he dare not.\r\nConstruct a drama he could not. His style had something hypocritical,\r\nfinniking, and vain. For thinkers he was a poet; for poets he was a\r\nsage: for society he was a great man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! to table!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bacchis. And she lay down with her lover upon\r\nthe bed which stood at the head of the banqueting board. On her right,\r\nreclined Philodemos and Faustina with Phrasilas. On Naukrates\xe2\x80\x99s left,\r\nSeso, then Chrysis and young Timon. Each one of the guests reclined in\r\na diagonal position, leaning upon silken cushions and wearing wreaths\r\nof flowers upon their heads. A slave-girl brought the garlands of red\r\nroses and blue lotus-flowers, then the banquet began.\r\n\r\nTimon felt that his freak had chilled the women. He therefore did not\r\nspeak to them at first, but, addressing Philodemos, said gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say you are the devoted friend of Cicero. What do you think of\r\nhim, Philodemos? Is he an enlightened philosopher or a mere compiler,\r\nwithout discernment and without taste? for I have heard both opinions\r\nput forward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is precisely because I am his friend that I cannot answer your\r\nquestion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philodemos. \xe2\x80\x9cI know him too well; consequently I know\r\nhim ill. Ask Phrasilas, who, having read him but little, will judge him\r\nwithout error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what does Phrasilas think about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an admirable writer,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what sense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-046\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the sense that all writers, Timon, are admirable in something, like\r\nall landscapes and all souls. I cannot prefer the spectacle of the sea\r\nitself to the most monotonous plain. And so I am unable to classify in\r\nthe order of my sympathies a treatise by Cicero, an ode of Pindar, and\r\na letter written by Chrysis, even if I knew the style of our excellent\r\nlittle friend. When I put down a book, I am content if I carry away in\r\nmy memory a single line which has given me food for thought. Hitherto,\r\nall the books I have opened have contained that line: but no book has\r\never given me a second. Perhaps each of us has only one thing to say in\r\nhis life, and those who have attempted to speak at greater length have\r\ndone so because they were inflated by ambition. How much more do I\r\nregret the irreparable silence of the millions of souls who have said\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not of your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naukrates, without lifting his eyes.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe universe was created for the expression of three verities, and to\r\nour misfortune, their certitude was proved five centuries before this\r\nevening. Heraclitos has solved the riddle of the world; Parmenides has\r\nunmasked the soul; Pythagoras has measured God; we have nothing left us\r\nbut to hold our tongues. I consider the chickpea very rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeso lightly tapped the table with the handle of her fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimon, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you propound questions without any interest either for me who\r\nam ignorant of Latin, or for yourself who want to forget it? Do you\r\nfancy you can dazzle Faustina with your foreign erudition? My poor\r\nfellow, I am not the woman to be duped by your words. I undressed your\r\ngreat soul last night under my bed-clothes, and I know the chickpea it\r\nconcerns itself with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, simply.\r\n\r\nBut Phrasilas began a second little couplet, with a suave, ironical\r\nintonation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeso, when you think fit to give us the pleasure of judging Timon,\r\nwhether to applaud him, as he deserves, or to blame him, unjustly in my\r\nopinion, remember that he is an invisible being and that the nature of\r\nhis soul is hidden from us. It has no existence in itself, or at least\r\nwe cannot know it; but it reflects the souls of those that mirror\r\nthemselves in it, and changes its aspect when it changes its place.\r\nLast night it resembled you exactly; I am not astonished you were\r\npleased with it. Just now it took the image of Philodemos; that is why\r\nyou have just said it belied itself. Now it certainly does not belie\r\nitself, because it does not affirm itself. You see my dear, that we\r\nought to beware of rash judgments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTimon shot a glance of irritation at Phrasilas, but he reserved his\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Seso, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are four of us courtesans\r\nhere, and we intend to direct the conversation, in order that we may\r\nnot resemble pink children who only open their mouths to drink milk.\r\nFaustina, you arrived the last, please begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naukrates. \xe2\x80\x9cChoose for us, Faustina. What shall we\r\ntalk about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young Italian woman turned her head, raised her eyes, blushed, and\r\nwith an undulation of her whole body, sighed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very pretty subject,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seso, trying not to laugh.\r\n\r\nBut no one took it up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe table was covered with wreaths, flowers, tankards, and jugs. Slaves\r\nbrought wicker baskets, containing bread as light as snow. On\r\nterra-cotta plates were to be seen fat eels sprinkled with seasoning,\r\nwax-coloured alphests, and sacred beauty-fish.\r\n\r\nThere was also a pompilus, a purple fish which was supposed to have\r\nsprung from the same foam as Aphrodite, bebradons, a grey mullet served\r\nup with calmars, multi-coloured scorpenas. Some were brought in their\r\nlittle sauce-pans, in order that they might be eaten foaming hot; fat\r\ntunnyfish, hot devil-fish with tender tentacles, slices of lamprey;\r\nfinally the belly of a white electric eel, round as that of a beautiful\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first course. The guests chose little tit-bits from each\r\nfish, and left the rest to the slaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d began Phrasilas, \xe2\x80\x9cis a word which has no meaning, or rather too\r\nmuch, for it designates in turn two irreconcilable feelings: sensual\r\ngratification and passion. I do not know in what sense Faustina takes\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-047\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cI like to have the sensual gratification.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor my part,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Chrysis, \xe2\x80\x9cI like to have the sensual\r\ngratification, and to leave passion to my lovers. We must speak both of\r\none and the other, or my interest will only be partial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Philodemos, \xe2\x80\x9cis neither passion nor sensual\r\ngratification. Love is something quite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Timon, \xe2\x80\x9clet us have a banquet for\r\nonce without philosophies. We are aware, Phrasilas, that you can uphold\r\nwith graceful eloquence and honeyed persuasiveness the superiority of\r\nmultiple pleasure over exclusive passion. We are aware also that after\r\nhaving spoken for a full hour on such a thorny question, you would be\r\nready, during the next hour, with the same graceful eloquence and the\r\nsame honeyed persuasiveness, to defend the arguments of your adversary.\r\nI do not. . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me . . .\xe2\x80\x9d said Phrasilas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not deny,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Timon, \xe2\x80\x9cthe charm of this little sport, or\r\neven the wit you bring to bear on it. I have my doubts as to its\r\ndifficulty, and consequently as to its interest. The _Banquet_ you\r\npublished some time ago and incorporated in a story of lighter tone,\r\nand also the reflexions you placed recently in the mouth of a mythical\r\npersonage who resembles your ideal, seemed new and rare in the reign of\r\nPtolemy Auletes. But for three years we have been living under the\r\nyoung Queen Berenice, and I know not by what transformation the method\r\nof thought you had adopted, that of an illustrious exegetical critic,\r\nharmonious and smiling, has suddenly grown a century older under your\r\npen, like the fashion of tight sleeves and yellow hair. Excellent\r\nmaster, I deplore it, for if your stories lack fire, if your experience\r\nof the female heart is not worth serious consideration, on the other\r\nhand you are gifted with the comic spirit, and I am grateful to you for\r\nhaving made me smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimon!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bacchis in indignation.\r\n\r\nPhrasilas motioned to her to be silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him alone, my dear. Unlike most men, I retain only the eulogistic\r\nportion of the judgments people pass upon me. Timon has given me his;\r\nothers will praise me on other points. It would be impossible to live\r\nin the midst of unanimous approbation, and I regard the very variety of\r\nthe sentiments I provoke as a charming flower-bed in which I desire to\r\nbreathe the scent of the roses without tearing up the spurge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis moved her lips in a way which showed clearly how slight was the\r\nvalue she set on this man and his cleverness at terminating disputes.\r\nShe turned towards Timon, who shared her bed with her, and put her hand\r\non his neck. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the aim of life?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked him.\r\n\r\nIt was the question she usually asked when she was at a loss what to\r\nsay to a philosopher; but this time she introduced a tender note into\r\nher voice, and Timon fancied he detected a declaration of love.\r\n\r\nill-048\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless he answered with a certain calm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach one has his own object in life, my Chrysis. There is no object\r\nuniversal and common to all beings. For my part, I am the son of a\r\nbanker whose client\xc3\xa8le is composed of all the great courtesans of\r\nEgypt, and, my father having amassed an enormous fortune by ingenious\r\nmethods, I restore it honourably to the victims of his favours by\r\nsleeping with them as often as the strength the Gods have given me\r\nallows me to do so. I have decided that my energy is only susceptible\r\nof performing one duty in life. I have chosen this duty because it\r\ncombines the exigencies of the rarest virtue with contrary\r\nsatisfactions that another ideal would support less easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuring this speech he had slipped his right leg behind those of\r\nChrysis, who was lying on her side, and he tried to part the closed\r\nknees of the courtesan as if to give a precise object to existence for\r\nthat evening. But Chrysis did not humour him.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence for several minutes; then Seso began to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimon, it is very annoying of you to interrupt at the very beginning\r\nthe only serious conversation of which the subject is capable of\r\ninteresting us. At any rate, let Naukretes speak, since you are so\r\nspiteful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say about love?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the Guest par excellence. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis the name given to sorrow to console those who suffer. There are only\r\ntwo ways of being unhappy: either we desire what we have not, or we\r\npossess what we desired. Love begins with the first, and comes to an\r\nend with the second, in the most lamentable state, that is to say, as\r\nsoon as it succeeds. May the gods preserve us from love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to possess unexpectedly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philodemos, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cis not that\r\ntrue felicity?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a rarity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, if one is careful. Listen to me, Naukrates: not to desire,\r\nbut to act in such a way that the opportunity offers itself; not to\r\nlove, but to cherish from a distance certain well-chosen women for whom\r\none feels one might have a taste in the long run, if chance and\r\ncircumstances combined to throw them into one\xe2\x80\x99s arms; never to adorn a\r\nwoman with qualities one wants her to have, or with beauties of which\r\nshe makes a mystery, but always to take the insipid for granted in\r\norder to be astonished by the exquisite. Is not this the best advice a\r\nsage can give to lovers? They only have lived happily who, in the\r\ncourse of their dear existences, have been wise enough occasionally to\r\nreserve for themselves the priceless purity of unforeseen joys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second course was drawing to a close. There had been pheasants,\r\nattagas, a magnificent blue and red porphyris, and a swan with all its\r\nfeathers, the cooking of which had been spread over forty-eight hours\r\nso as not to burn its wings. Upon curved plates one saw phlexids,\r\npelicans, a white peacock which seemed to be sitting on a dozen and a\r\nhalf of roast and stuffed spermologues; in a word, enough food to feed\r\na hundred persons on the fragments left behind after the choice pieces\r\nhad been set aside. But all this was nothing compared with the last\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nThis chef-d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93uvre (such a work of art had not been seen for many a long\r\nday at Alexandria) was a young pig, of which one half had been roasted\r\nand the other boiled. It was impossible to distinguish the wound which\r\nhad provoked its death, or by what means its belly had been stuffed\r\nwith everything it contained. It was stuffed with round quails, chicken\r\nbreasts, field-larks, succulent sauces, and slices of vulva and\r\nmince-meat. The presence of all these things in an animal apparently\r\nintact seemed inexplicable.\r\n\r\nThe guests uttered an unanimous cry of admiration, and Faustina asked\r\nfor the recipe. Phrasilas smilingly delivered himself of sententious\r\nmetaphorical maxims; Philodemos improvised a distich in which the word\r\n\xcf\x87\xce\xbf\xe1\xbf\x96\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82 was taken alternately in both senses. This made Seso, already\r\ndrunk, laugh till the tears flowed, but Bacchis having given the order\r\nto pour seven rare wines into seven cups for the use of each guest, the\r\nconversation strayed.\r\n\r\nTimon turned to Bacchis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cshould you have been so hard on the poor girl I\r\nwanted to bring with me? She was a colleague, nevertheless. If I were\r\nin your place, I should respect a poor courtesan more highly than a\r\nrich matron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bacchis, without discussing the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have often noticed that those who, once in a way, venture to\r\nutter striking truths, are taken for lunatics. Paradoxes find everybody\r\nagreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, my friend; ask your neighbours, where is the man of birth\r\nwho would choose a girl without jewels as his mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philodemos with simplicity.\r\n\r\nAnd the women despised him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast year,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cat the end of spring, Cicero\xe2\x80\x99s exile gave me\r\ngood reason to fear for my own safety, and I took a little journey. I\r\nretired lo the foot of the Alps, to a charming place named Orobia, on\r\nthe borders of the little lake Clisius. It was a simple village with\r\nbarely three hundred women, and one of them had become a courtesan in\r\norder to protect the virtue of the others. Her house was to be\r\nrecognised by a bouquet of flowers hanging over the door, but she\r\nherself was indistinguishable from her sisters or cousins. She was\r\nignorant of the very existence of paint, perfumes, cosmetics,\r\ntransparent veils and curling-tongs. She did not know how to preserve\r\nher beauty, and depilitated herself with pitchy resin just as one pulls\r\nup weeds from a courtyard of white marble. One shudders at the thought\r\nthat she walked without boots, so that it was impossible to kiss her\r\nnaked feet as one kisses Faustina\xe2\x80\x99s, softer than one\xe2\x80\x99s hand. And yet I\r\ndiscovered so many charms in her that beside her brown body I forgot\r\nRome for a whole month and blessed Tyre and Alexandria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaukrates nodded approval, took a draught of wine, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great event in love is the instant when nudity is revealed.\r\nCourtesans should know this and spare us surprises. Now, it would seem\r\non the contrary that they devote all their efforts to disillusioning\r\nus. Is there anything more painful than a mass of hair bearing traces\r\nof the curling irons? Is there anything more disagreeable than painted\r\ncheeks that leave the marks of the cosmetics on the mouth that kisses\r\nthem! Is there anything more pitiable than a pencilled eye with the\r\ncharcoal half rubbed off? Strictly speaking, I can understand chaste\r\nwomen using these illusory devices: every woman likes to surround\r\nherself with a circle of male adorers, and the chaste ones amongst them\r\ndo not run the risk of familiarities which would unmask the secrets of\r\ntheir physique. But that courtesans whose end and resource is the bed,\r\nshould venture to show themselves less beautiful in it than in the\r\nstreet is really inconceivable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing about it, Naukrates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow that one does not keep one lover out of twenty; but one does not\r\nseduce one man out of five hundred, and before pleasing in the bed one\r\nmust please in the street. No one would notice us if we did not rouge\r\nour faces and darken our eyes. The little peasant-girl Philodemos\r\nspeaks of, attracted him without difficulty because she was alone in\r\nher village. There are fifteen thousand courtesans here. The\r\ncompetition is quite another thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that pure beauty has no need of adornment, and suffices\r\nfor itself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Well, institute a competition between a pure beauty, as you say,\r\nand Gnath\xc3\xa8ne, who is old and plain. Dress the former in a tunic covered\r\nwith holes and set her in the last row at the theatre, and put the\r\nlatter in her star-embroidered robe in the places reserved by her\r\nslaves, and note their prices at the end of the performance: the pure\r\nbeauty will get eight obols and Gnath\xc3\xa8ne two min\xc3\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen are stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d Seso concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, simply lazy. They do not take the trouble to choose their\r\nmistresses. The best-loved women are the most mendacious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Phrasilas, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if, on the one hand, I should\r\nwillingly applaud . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he delivered himself, with great charm, of two set discourses\r\nentirely devoid of interest.\r\n\r\nOne by one, twelve dancing girls appeared, the two first playing the\r\nflute and the last the timbrel, the others manipulating castanets. They\r\narranged their bandelets, rubbed their little sandals with white resin,\r\nand waited with extended arms for the music to begin . . . A note . . .\r\ntwo notes . . . a Lydian scale, and the twelve young girls shot forward\r\nto the accompaniment of a light rhythm.\r\n\r\nTheir dance was voluptuous, languorous, and without apparent order,\r\nalthough all the figures had been settled beforehand. They confined\r\ntheir evolutions to a small space: they intermingled like waves. Soon\r\nthey formed in couples, and without interrupting the step, unfastened\r\ntheir girdles and let their pink tunics glide to the ground. An odour\r\nof naked women spread about the men, dominating the perfume of the\r\nflowers and the steam of the gaping viands. They threw themselves\r\nbackwards with brusque movements, with their bellies tightly drawn, and\r\ntheir arms over their eyes. Then they straightened themselves up again\r\nand hollowed their loins, and touched one another, as they passed, with\r\nthe points of their dancing breasts. Timon\xe2\x80\x99s hand received the fugitive\r\ncaress of a hot thigh.\r\n\r\nill-049\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soon they formed in couples._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does our friend think about it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Phrasilas with his piping\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel perfectly happy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Timon. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never before so\r\nclearly understood the supreme mission of women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProstitution, either with or without art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is only an opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhrasilas, once again, we know that nothing can be proved: worse\r\nstill, we know that nothing exists, and that even that is not certain.\r\nThis being conceded and in order to satisfy your celebrated mania,\r\npermit me to hold a theory at once contestable and antiquated, as all\r\nof them are, but interesting to me, who affirm it, and to the majority\r\nof men, who deny it. In the ease of thought, originality is an ideal\r\nstill more chimerical than certitude. You are aware of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me some Lesbian wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seso to the slave. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is stronger\r\nthan the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI maintain,\xe2\x80\x9d Timon went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the married woman, by devoting\r\nherself to a man who deceives her, by refusing herself to all others\r\n(or by committing adultery very rarely, which comes to the same thing),\r\nby giving birth to children who deform her before they see the light\r\nand monopolise her when they are born,\xe2\x80\x94I maintain that by living thus a\r\nwoman destroys her life without merit, and that on her wedding-day a\r\nyoung girl concludes a dupe\xe2\x80\x99s bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe acts in fancied obedience to a duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Naukrates without\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA duty? and to whom? Is she not free to settle a question which\r\nconcerns nobody but herself? She is a woman, and in virtue of her sex\r\nis generally insensible to the pleasures of the intellect; and not\r\ncontent with remaining a stranger to one half of human joys, she\r\nexcludes herself, by her marriage, from the other aspect of pleasure.\r\nThus a young girl can say to herself, at the age when she is all\r\npassion: \xe2\x80\x98I shall know my husband, and in addition, ten lovers, perhaps\r\ntwelve\xe2\x80\x99, and believe that she will die without having regretted\r\nanything? Three thousand women will not be enough for me on the day I\r\ntake my leave of life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are ambitious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis.\r\n\r\nill-050\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with what incense, with what golden poesy,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the gentle\r\nPhilodemos, \xe2\x80\x9cshould we not praise to eternity the beneficent\r\ncourtesans! Thanks to them, we escape all the complicated precautions,\r\nthe jealousies, the stratagems, the throbbings of the heart that\r\naccompany adultery. It is they who spare us hours of waiting in the\r\nrain, rickety ladders, secret doors, interrupted meetings, and\r\nintercepted letters and misunderstood signals. O! dear creatures, how I\r\nlove you! With you there are no sieges to be undertaken: for a few\r\nlittle coins you give us what another would hardly be capable of\r\ngranting us as a condescension, after three weeks of coldness. For your\r\nenlightened souls, love is not a sacrifice, it is an equal favour\r\nexchanged by two lovers, and so the sums we confide to you do not serve\r\nto compensate you for your priceless caresses, but to pay at its proper\r\nprice for the multiple and charming luxury with which, by a supreme\r\ncomplaisance, you pacify nightly our ravenous passions. As you are\r\ninnumerable, we always find amongst you both the dream of our lives and\r\nour fancy for the evening, all women at a day\xe2\x80\x99s notice, hair of every\r\nshade, eyes of every colour, lips of every savour. There is no love\r\nunder heaven so pure that you cannot feign it, nor so revolting that\r\nyou dare not propose it. You are tender to the disreputable,\r\nconsolatory to the afflicted, hospitable to all, and beautiful! That is\r\nwhy I tell you, Chrysis, Bacchis, Seso, Faustina, that it is a just law\r\nof the gods which decrees that courtesans shall be the eternal desire\r\nof lovers and the eternal envy of virtuous spouses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dancing-girls had ceased dancing.\r\n\r\nA young girl-acrobat had just entered, who juggled with daggers and\r\nwalked on her hands between the upright blades.\r\n\r\nAs the attention of the guest was entirely absorbed by the lassie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndangerous sport, Timon looked at Chrysis, and gradually, without being\r\nseen, manoevered so that he lay behind her at full length and touched\r\nher with his feet and mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cno, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he had slipped his arm around her through the large slit in her\r\nrobe and was carefully caressing the reclining courtesan\xe2\x80\x99s delicate,\r\nburning skin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d she implored. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be seen. Bacchis will be angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-051\r\n\r\n\r\n_She let herself slip down from the bed._\r\n\r\n\r\nA glance convinced the young man that he was not being watched. He\r\nventured upon a caress after which women rarely resist when once they\r\nhave allowed things to go so far. Then, in order to quench by a\r\ndecisive argument the last scruples of expiring modesty, he put his\r\npurse in her hand, which happened by chance to be open.\r\n\r\nChrysis resisted no longer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young acrobat continued her subtle and dangerous tricks.\r\nShe walked upon her hands, with her skirt reversed, with her feet\r\ndangling in front of her head, between sharp swords and long keen\r\nblades. The effort occasioned by this critical posture, and perhaps\r\nalso the fear of wounds, flooded her cheeks with dark warm blood, which\r\nheightened still further the glitter of her wide-open eyes. Her waist\r\nbent and straightened itself again. Her legs parted like the arms of a\r\ndancing girl.\r\n\r\nA violent respiration agitated her naked breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis briefly: \xe2\x80\x9cyou have only excited me a little. Let\r\nus have no more of it. Leave me. Leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd at the moment when the two Ephesians rose, according to the\r\ntradition, to play _The Fable of Hermaphroditus_, she let herself slip\r\ndown from the bed and went out feverishly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nRHACOTIS\r\n\r\nHardly had the door closed upon her than Chrysis pressed the inflamed\r\ncentre of her desire with her hand as one presses a sore spot to\r\nrelieve shooting pains. Then she leaned up against a column and twisted\r\nher fingers, groaning with anguish.\r\n\r\nShe would never know anything, then!\r\n\r\nAs the hours passed, the improbability of her success increased, became\r\nflagrant. Brusquely to ask for the mirror was a very risky method of\r\ndiscovering the truth. In case it should have been taken, she would\r\nattract the suspicions of all to herself, and would be lost. On the\r\nother hand, she had left the banqueting hall out of sheer impatience.\r\n\r\nTimon\xe2\x80\x99s clumsinesses had merely served to exasperate her dumb rage. A\r\ntrembling fit due to over-excitement compelled her to apply her whole\r\nbody to the freshness of the smooth, monstrous column. She felt an\r\nattack coming on and was afraid.\r\n\r\nShe called the slave Aretias:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep my jewels for me: I am going out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she descended the seven stone steps.\r\n\r\nThe night was hot. Not a breath of wind to fan the heavy beads of sweat\r\nupon her forehead. The disappointment increased her discomfort and made\r\nher reel.\r\n\r\nShe walked along down the street.\r\n\r\nBacchis\xe2\x80\x99s house was situated at the extremity of Brouchion, on the\r\nlimits of the native town, an enormous slum inhabited by sailors and\r\nEgyptian women. The fishermen, who slept upon their vessels anchored\r\nduring the crippling heat of the day, came to pass their nights there\r\ntill the break of dawn, and in return for a double intoxication left\r\nthe harlots and the wine-sellers the price of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s catch.\r\n\r\nChrysis entered the narrow streets of this Alexandrian Suburra, full of\r\nsound, movement and barbarous music. She cast furtive glances through\r\nopen doors into rooms reeking with lamp smoke, where naked couples lay\r\nenlaced together. At the cross-roads, on low trestles erected in front\r\nof the houses, multi-coloured mattresses creaked and tumbled in the\r\nshadow, under a double human load. Chrysis walked along with\r\nembarrassment. A woman without a lover solicited her. An old man\r\ncaressed her breasts. A mother offered her her daughter. A gaping\r\npeasant kissed the back of her neck. She fled, in a sort of hot terror.\r\n\r\nThis foreign town within the Greek town was, for Chrysis, full of night\r\nand dangers. She was ill acquainted with the strange labyrinth, the\r\nintricacy of the streets, the secrets of certain houses. When, at rare\r\nintervals, she ventured to set foot in it, she always followed the same\r\ndirect road towards a little red door; and there she forgot her usual\r\nlovers in the indefatigable arms of a young ass-driver with strong\r\nmuscles, whom she had the joy of paying in her turn.\r\n\r\nBut this evening, she felt even without turning her head that she was\r\nbeing followed by a double footstep.\r\n\r\nShe increased her pace. The double footstep did likewise. She began to\r\nrun; the footsteps behind her ran also; then beside herself with\r\nterror, she took another alley, and then another in the opposite\r\ndirection, and then a long street which stretched away in an unknown\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWith dry throat and swollen temples, but sustained by Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s wine,\r\nshe pursued her flight, turned from right to left, pale,\r\npanic-stricken.\r\n\r\nFinally, a wall blocked farther progress: she was in a blind alley. She\r\ntried hastily to double, but two sailors with brown hands barred the\r\nnarrow passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, my little wisp of gold?\xe2\x80\x9d said one of them\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me pass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? you are lost, young lady, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know Rhacotis well, eh? We are\r\ngoing to show you the town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they both took her by the waist. She shouted, and struggled, struck\r\nout with her fist, but the second sailor seized both her hands in his\r\nleft hand and simply said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little calm, please. You know that the Greeks are not loved here:\r\nnobody will come to your assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not Greek!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou lie, you have a white skin and a straight nose. Unless you want\r\nthe stick, submit quietly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis looked at the speaker, and suddenly fell on his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you, I will follow you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will follow both of us.\r\nMy friend shall have his share. Walk with us: it will not be dull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhere were they taking her to? She had not the least idea, but this\r\nsecond sailor\xe2\x80\x99s very rudeness, his brutish head pleased her. She\r\nconsidered him with the imperturbable glance that young bitches have in\r\nthe presence of meat. She bent her body towards him, to touch him as\r\nshe walked.\r\n\r\nWith rapid steps they traversed strange quarters, without life, without\r\nlights. Chrysis could not understand how they threaded their way\r\nthrough this nocturnal maze out of which she never could have got alone\r\non account of the curious intricacy of the streets. The closed doors,\r\nthe deserted windows, the motionless shadows terrified her. Above her\r\nhead, between the houses, that almost met, ran a pale ribbon of sky,\r\nflooded with moonlight.\r\n\r\nFinally, they entered life once more. At a turning of the street,\r\nsuddenly, eight, ten, eleven lights appeared, illuminated doorways\r\noccupied by Nabat\xc3\xa6an women squatting between two red lamps which cast a\r\ngleam from below upon their heads hooded with gold.\r\n\r\nill-052\r\n\r\n\r\n_She shouted and struggled._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the distance, they heard first a swelling murmur, and then a\r\nconfused roar of chariots, tumbling bales, asses\xe2\x80\x99 footsteps, and human\r\nvoices. It was the square of Rhacotis where, during the Alexandrian\r\nsummer, all the provisions for nine hundred thousand mouths a day were\r\ncollected and stacked up.\r\n\r\nThey passed the houses of the square, between green piles, vegetables,\r\nlotus roots, smooth beans, baskets of olives. Chrysis took a handful of\r\nmulberries out of a violet heap, and ate them without stopping.\r\nFinally, they arrived before a low door and the sailors entered with\r\nher for whom had been stolen the True Pearls of Anadyomene.\r\n\r\nThere was an immense hall there. Five hundred men of the people sat\r\nwaiting for the day, drinking cups of yellow beer, eating figs,\r\nlentils, sesame cakes, olyra bread. In their midst, swarmed a herd of\r\nyelping women, a whole field of black hair and multicoloured flowers in\r\nan atmosphere of fire. They were poor homeless girls who were the\r\nproperty of all. They came there to beg for scraps, bare-footed,\r\nbare-breasted, with a scanty red or blue rag tied round their bellies,\r\ncarrying, for the most part, a tattered infant on their left arm. There\r\nwere also dancing-girls, six Egyptians on a dais, with an orchestra of\r\nthree musicians, the first two of whom smote ox-hide timbrels with\r\ndrum-sticks, whilst the third wielded a great sistrum of sonorous\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! myxaira sweets!\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis gleefully.\r\n\r\nAnd she bought two sous\xe2\x80\x99 worth of the little girl who hawked them.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she swooned, overcome by the insupportable stink of this\r\nden, and the sailors carried her out in their arms.\r\n\r\nThe fresh air brought her round a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to?\xe2\x80\x9d she implored. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us be quick: I can walk no\r\nmore. You see that I don\xe2\x80\x99t resist, I am nice to you. But let us find a\r\nbed as soon as possible, otherwise I shall drop down in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE ORGIE AT BACCHIS\xe2\x80\x99S\r\n\r\nWhen she once more found herself at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s door, she was penetrated\r\nby the delicious sensation produced by the respite from desire and the\r\nsilence of the flesh. Her forehead no longer ached. Her mouth no longer\r\ntwitched. She felt nothing but an intermittent pain which seized her\r\nfrom time to time in the small of the back. She mounted the steps and\r\ncrossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Chrysis had left the room the orgie had developed like a\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nOther friends entered, to whom the twelve dancing girls fell an easy\r\nprey. Forty tattered wreaths strewed the ground with flowers. A\r\nleathern bottle of Syracusan wine had burst in a corner, and its golden\r\nflood flowed under and around the table.\r\n\r\nPhilodemos was by the side of Faustina.\r\n\r\nHe had torn her robe and was singing her the verses he had made in her\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO feet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cO sweet thighs, deep reins, round croup, cloven\r\nfig, hips, shoulders, breasts, mobile neck; O all ye things that charm\r\nme, warm hands, expert movements, active tongue! You are a Roman, you\r\nare a Roman, you are too dark and you do not sing the poems of Sappho;\r\nbut Perseus was the lover of the Indian Andromeda.\xe2\x80\x9d [1]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Seso lay flat upon her belly on the table in a pile of\r\ncrushed fruit. She was completely overpowered by the fumes of Egyptian\r\nwine, and as she lay dipping the nipple of her right breast in a pond\r\nof snow-cooled wine, she kept repeating with a comical pathos:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrink, my little darling. You are thirsty. Drink, my little darling.\r\nDrink. Drink. Drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAphrodisia, still a slave, triumphed in the midst of a circle of men,\r\nand was celebrating her last night of servitude by an extravagant\r\ndebauch. In obedience to the tradition of all Alexandrian orgies, she\r\nhad begun by giving herself to three lovers at once; but her task did\r\nnot end there, and according to the law of slaves who became\r\ncourtesans, she was expected to prove by an incessant zeal, lasting all\r\nnight, that she had not usurped her new dignity.\r\n\r\nStanding alone behind a curtain, Naukrates and Phrasilas discussed\r\ncourteously the respective value of Arcesilas and Carneades.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hall, Myrtocleia protected Rhodis against the\r\nover-zealous enterprises of one of the guests.\r\n\r\nill-054\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the two Ephesians saw Chrysis enter, they rose to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome away, my Chryse. Theano stays: but we are going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stay too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the courtesan. And she lay down on her back upon a\r\ngreat bed covered with roses.\r\n\r\nA din of voices and the clattering of money falling on the floor\r\nattracted her attention. It was Theano who, in order to parody her\r\nsister, had bethought her to caricature the \xe2\x80\x9cFable of Dana\xc3\xab,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsimulating a mad ecstasy of voluptuous delight every time a golden coin\r\npenetrated her. The child\xe2\x80\x99s daring impiety amused all the guests, for\r\nthey were no longer in the days when the thunderbolt would have\r\nexterminated those who scoffed at the Immortal One. But the sport\r\ndegenerated, as might have been foreseen. A clumsy fellow hurt the poor\r\nlittle thing, and she fell to weeping noisily.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to invent a new amusement to console her. Two\r\ndancing-girls pushed into the centre of the room an immense silver-gilt\r\nbowl filled to the top with wine. Then somebody seized Theano by the\r\nfeet, and made her drink with her head downwards. This convulsed her\r\nwith a fit of laughter which she was unable to master.\r\n\r\nThis idea was such a success that everybody crowded around, and when\r\nthe flute-girl was set on her feet again, the sight of her little face\r\npurple with congestion and dripping with wine, produced such a general\r\nhilarity that Bacchis said to Selene:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mirror! a mirror! let her see herself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe slave brought a bronze mirror. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that one. The mirror of\r\nRhodopis. She merits it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-055\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysis sprang up with a bound. The blood spurted to her cheeks, then\r\nretired again, and she remained perfectly pale, with the beatings of\r\nher heart battering her breast, and her eyes fixed on the door through\r\nwhich the slave had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThat instant was to decide her whole life. Her last hope was either to\r\nvanish or be realised. The f\xc3\xaate continued all around her.\r\n\r\nAn iris wreath, thrown from somewhere or other, fell upon her lips. A\r\nman broke a little phial of perfume over her hair. It ran down too\r\nquickly and wetted her shoulders. The splashes of wine from a full\r\ntankard into which somebody had thrown a pomegranate spotted her silk\r\ntunic and penetrated to the skin. She bore all the traces of the orgie\r\nmagnificently.\r\n\r\nThe slave who had gone out did not return.\r\n\r\nChrysis remained stone-pale, motionless as a sculptured goddess. The\r\nrhythmic and monotonous wail of a woman in travail of love not far away\r\nmarked the passage of time for her. It seemed to her that this woman\r\nhad been moaning thus since the night before. She could have twisted\r\nsomething, broken her fingers, shouted.\r\n\r\nAt last Selene came back, empty-handed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mirror?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bacchis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt . . . It has gone . . . it . . . has been . . . stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d stammered\r\nthe servant.\r\n\r\nBacchis uttered a cry so piercing that all ceased speaking, and a\r\nfrightful silence brusquely interrupted the tumult.\r\n\r\nMen and women crowded round her from all parts of the vast chamber,\r\nleaving a little space in the centre which was occupied by the\r\ndistracted Bacchis and the kneeling slave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! What!\xe2\x80\x9d she shrieked.\r\n\r\nAnd as Selene did not answer, she seized her violently by the neck:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have stolen it yourself! You have stolen it yourself! Answer,\r\nanswer! I will loosen your tongue with the whip, miserable little\r\nbitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen a terrible thing happened. Beside herself with fear, the fear of\r\nsuffering, the fear of death, the most instant terror she had ever\r\nknown, the child exclaimed hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Aphrodisia! It is not I! it is not I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the mulatto woman; \xe2\x80\x9cit is Aphrodisia who has taken\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they dragged their sister, who had just fallen into a fainting fit,\r\nbefore Bacchis.\r\n\r\n [1] Philod\xc3\xa8me AP. V. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE CRUCIFIED ONE\r\n\r\nThey all repeated together:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Aphrodisia who has taken it! Bitch! Bitch! Filthy thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir hatred of the favourite sister was reinforced by their fear for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAretias gave her a kick in the breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Bacchis. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you put it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has given it to her lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn Opian sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is his ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sailed this evening for Rome. You will never see your mirror again.\r\nLet us crucify the bitch, the bloody animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Gods! Gods!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Bacchis.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly her sorrow changed into a frenzy of rage.\r\n\r\nill-056\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bacchis seized her by the hair._\r\n\r\n\r\nAphrodisia had come to herself again; but, paralysed by terror, and\r\nunable to understand what was happening, she remained speechless and\r\ntearless.\r\n\r\nBacchis seized her by the hair, dragged her over the soiled floor,\r\nthrough the flowers and pools of wine, and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cross! the cross! bring the nails! bring the hammer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Seso to her neighbour; \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen that. Let us\r\nfollow them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll pressed forward to follow. And Chrysis, who alone knew the guilty\r\none, and was alone the cause of everything, Chrysis followed too.\r\n\r\nBacchis went straight into the slaves\xe2\x80\x99 chamber, a square apartment\r\nfurnished with three mattresses on which they slept in couples when the\r\nnights were over. At the lower end, like an ever-present menace, stood\r\na T-shaped cross which had never yet been used.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the confused murmur of the young men and women, four\r\nslaves hoisted the martyr to the level of the branches of the cross.\r\n\r\nNot a sound had yet left her lips; but when she felt the touch of the\r\ncold rough beam on her naked back, her long eyes dilated, and she was\r\nseized with a convulsive fit of groaning which lasted till the end.\r\n\r\nThey put her astride on a wooden peg driven into the centre of the\r\nupright. This served to support the body and obviate the tearing of the\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThen they opened out her arms.\r\n\r\nChrysis looked on and held her peace. What could she say? She could\r\nonly have exonerated the slave by incriminating Demetrios, who was\r\nbeyond reach of all attack, and who would have taken a cruel revenge.\r\nBesides, a slave was a source of riches, and it was a satisfaction to\r\nthe long-standing grudge that Chrysis bore her enemy to think that she\r\nwas destroying in this way with her own hands the value of three\r\nthousand drachm\xc3\xa6 as completely as if she had thrown the money into the\r\nEunostis. And then, was the life of a minion worth troubling about?\r\n\r\nHeliope handed Bacchis the first nail and the hammer, and the torture\r\nbegan. Intoxication, rancour, anger, all the passions together, even\r\nthe instinct of cruelty which lurks in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, animated the\r\nsoul of Bacchis at the moment she struck, and she uttered a shriek\r\nalmost as piercing as that of Aphrodisia when the nail bent in the open\r\npalm.\r\n\r\nShe nailed up the second hand. She nailed the feet one upon the other.\r\nThen, excited by the sight of the blood spurting from the three wounds,\r\nshe cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not enough! Thief! Sow! Sailors\xe2\x80\x99 strumpet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the long pins out of her hair, and dug them violently into the\r\nflesh of her breasts, the belly, and the thighs. When she had no more\r\nweapons left in her hands, she smacked the poor wretch and spat upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe contemplated this work of vengeance for some time; then she\r\nreturned into the banqueting-hall with all the guests.\r\n\r\nPhrasilas and Timon alone did not follow her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s silent meditation, Phrasilas coughed slightly, put his\r\nright hand into his left, raised his head, lifted his eyebrows, and\r\ndrew near the crucified one, whose body shook with a continuous,\r\nhorrible trembling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her, \xe2\x80\x9cin divers circumstances, opposed to\r\nabsolute theories so-called, yet I cannot blind myself to the fact\r\nthat, in the conjuncture which has overtaken you, you would gain by\r\nbeing familiarised in more solid fashion with the maxims of the Stoics.\r\nZeno, who does not seem to have had a spirit completely exempt from\r\nerror, has left us several sophistries of no great general import, but,\r\nat the same time, you might derive profit from them to the particular\r\nend of calming your last moments.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPain\xe2\x80\x9d, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis a word void of meaning, since our will transcends\r\nthe imperfections of our perishable body. It is true that Zeno died at\r\nthe age of ninety-eight, without ever having had, according to his\r\nbiographers, any illness, however slight; but this circumstance cannot\r\nbe used as an argument against him, for from the mere fact that he\r\nsucceeded in maintaining an unimpaired good health, we cannot logically\r\nconclude that he would have been lacking in force of character had he\r\nfallen ill. Besides, it would be an abuse to compel the philosophers to\r\npractise in their persons the rules of conduct they profess, and to\r\ncultivate without respite the virtues they deem superior. In a word,\r\nnot to prolong inordinately a discourse which might last longer than\r\nyourself, endeavour to lift up your soul, my dear, as far as possible,\r\nabove your physical sufferings. However melancholy, however cruel they\r\nmay appear to you, I beg you to believe that I have a real part in\r\nthem. They are drawing to a close: be patient, forget. Between the\r\nvarious doctrines which attribute immortality to us, this is the moment\r\nfor choosing the one most fitted to alleviate your regrets at having to\r\ndisappear. If these doctrines are true, you will have lightened the\r\nbitter agony of the passage. If they lie, what does it matter? You will\r\nnever know that you were mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving spoken thus, Phrasilas re-adjusted the folds of his garment over\r\nhis shoulder and vanished with an unsteady gait.\r\n\r\nTimon remained alone in the room with the woman hanging in the throes\r\nof death upon the cross.\r\n\r\nThe memory of a night passed on the poor wretch\xe2\x80\x99s breast haunted his\r\nbrain, and confounded itself with the atrocious vision of the imminent\r\nrottenness into which this splendid body that had burned in his arms\r\nwas about to fall.\r\n\r\nHe pressed his hand over his eyes in order not to see her torture, but\r\nhe _heard_ the unceasing trembling of the body upon the cross.\r\n\r\nFinally, he looked. Great threads of blood formed a network on the skin\r\nfrom the pins in the breast down to the curled-up heels. The head\r\nturned perpetually. All the hair, matted with blood, sweat, and\r\nperfume, hung over the left side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAphrodisia! do you hear me! do you recognise me? It is I, Timon;\r\nTimon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer glance, almost blind, rested on him for a second. But the head\r\nturned incessantly. The body trembled continually.\r\n\r\nSoftly, as if he feared the sound of his foot-steps would hurt her, the\r\nyoung man advanced to the foot of the cross. He stretched out his arms,\r\nhe carefully took her strengthless and ever-turning head between his\r\ntwo fraternal hands, piously smoothed away her tear-drenched hair from\r\nher cheeks, and imprinted on the hot lips a kiss of infinite\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nAphrodisia closed her eyes. Did she recognise him who had charmed her\r\nhorrible end by this impulse of affectionate pity? An inexpressible\r\nsmile distended her blue eyelids, and with a sigh she gave up the\r\nghost.\r\n\r\nill-057\r\n\r\n\r\n_A kiss of infinite tenderness._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nENTHUSIASM\r\n\r\nSo, the deed was accomplished. Chrysis had the proof.\r\n\r\nIf Demetrios had brought himself to commit the first crime, the two\r\nothers had probably followed without delay. A man of his rank would\r\nconsider murder, and even sacrilege, as less dishonourable than theft.\r\n\r\nHe had obeyed, consequently he was a captive. This man, free,\r\nimpassive, and cold as he was, had submitted to the yoke of slavery\r\nlike the others, and his mistress, his tamer, it was she, Chrysis,\r\nSarah of Gennesaret.\r\n\r\nAh! to think of it, to repeat it, to say it out aloud, alone!\r\n\r\nChrysis rushed out of the noisy house and ran quickly, straight before\r\nher, with the fresh breeze of morning bathing her face.\r\n\r\nShe went as far as the Agora along the road which led to the sea, at\r\nthe end of which the masts of eight hundred ships stood huddled\r\ntogether like gigantic stalks of corn. Then she turned to the right,\r\nbefore the immense avenue of the Dromos where the house of Demetrios\r\nwas. A thrill of pride came over her when she passed in front of the\r\nwindows of her future lover; but she did not commit the indiscretion of\r\nattempting to see him the first. She followed the long road as far as\r\nthe Canopic Gate, and cast herself upon the ground between two aloes.\r\n\r\nHe had done it. He had done everything for her, certainly more than any\r\nlover had ever done for any woman. She repeated it unceasingly and\r\nreiterated her triumph again and again. Demetrios, the Well-Beloved,\r\nthe impossible and hopeless dream of so many feminine hearts, had run\r\nevery sort of peril for her, every kind of shame, of willing remorse.\r\nHe had even abjured the ideal of his thought, he had despoiled his\r\nhandiwork of the miraculous necklace, and that day which was just\r\ndawning would see the lover of the goddess at the feet of his new idol.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me! take me!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. She adored him now. She called out for\r\nhim. She longed for him. The three crimes became metamorphosed in her\r\nmind into three heroic actions, in return for which she would never be\r\nable to give enough affection, enough passion. With what an\r\nincomparable flame would their love burn\xe2\x80\x94this unique love of two beings\r\nequally young, equally beautiful, equally loved by one another and\r\nunited for ever after the conquest of so many obstacles.\r\n\r\nill-058\r\n\r\n\r\n_She extended her arms._\r\n\r\n\r\nThey would go away together, they would set sail for mysterious\r\ncountries, for Amaronthis, for Epidauros, or even for that unknown Rome\r\nwhich was the second town in the world after immense Alexandria, and\r\nwhich had undertaken the subjugation of the earth. What would they not\r\ndo, wherever they might be? What joy would be a stranger to them, what\r\nhuman felicity would not envy them theirs, and pale before their\r\nenchanted passage?\r\n\r\nChrysis rose from the ground, dazzled, She extended her arms, set back\r\nher shoulders, threw out her bust. A sensation of languor and mounting\r\njoy stiffened her firm breasts. She set out for home . . .\r\n\r\nOn opening the door of her chamber, she started with surprise to see\r\nthat nothing had changed under her roof since the night before. The\r\nlittle objects on her toilet-table, on the stands, on the shelves,\r\nappeared to her an inadequate setting for her new life.\r\n\r\nShe broke some that reminded her too directly of bygone useless lovers,\r\nfor whom she now conceived a sudden hatred. If she spared others, it\r\nwas not that she valued them more, but she was afraid of dismantling\r\nher chamber in case Demetrios had formed the design of passing the\r\nnight there.\r\n\r\nShe undressed slowly. Vestiges of the orgie fell from her tunic, crumbs\r\nof cake, hairs, rose-leaves.\r\n\r\nWhen her waist was relieved of the pressure of her girdle, she smoothed\r\nthe skin and plunged her fingers into her hair to lighten its weight.\r\n\r\nBut before going to bed a longing came over her to rest an instant on\r\nthe rugs of the terrace, where the coolness of the air was so\r\ndelicious.\r\n\r\nShe mounted.\r\n\r\nThe sun had barely risen. It lay on the horizon line like a vast\r\nswollen orange.\r\n\r\nA great gnarled palm-tree stood with its thicket of green leaves\r\nhanging over the balustrade. Chrysis ensconced her tingling nudity in\r\nits shade, and shivered, with her breasts in her hands.\r\n\r\nHer eyes wandered over the gradually whitening town. The violet vapours\r\nof the dawn rose from the silent streets and disappeared in the\r\npellucid air.\r\n\r\nill-059\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly, an idea burst upon her mind, grew upon her, took possession\r\nof her. Demetrios, who had already done so much, why should he not kill\r\nthe Queen, Demetrios who might be the king?\r\n\r\nAnd then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, that monumental ocean of houses, palaces, temples, porticoes,\r\ncolonnades, that swam before her eyes from the Necropolis of the west\r\nto the gardens of the Goddess: Brouchion, the Egyptian town, in front\r\nof which the gleaming Paneion reared itself aloft like a mountain\r\nacropolis; the Great Temple of Serapis, from the facade of which arose,\r\nhorn-like, two long pink obelisks; the Great Temple of Aphrodite\r\nengirded by the rustling of three hundred thousand palm-trees and\r\ncountless waves; the Temple of Persephone and the Temple of Arsino\xc3\xab,\r\nthe two sanctuaries of Poseidon, the three towers of Isis Lochias, and\r\nthe theatre, and the Hippodrome, and the Stadium where Pittacos had run\r\nin competition with Nicosthenes, and the tomb of Stratonice, and the\r\ntomb of the god Alexander\xe2\x80\x94Alexandria! Alexandria! the sea, the men, the\r\ncolossal marble Pharos whose mirror saved men from the sea! Alexandria!\r\nthe city of the eleven Ptolemies, Physcon, Philometor, Epiphanes,\r\nPhiladelphos; Alexandria, the climax of all dreams, the diadem of all\r\nthe glories conquered during three thousand years in Memphis, Thebes,\r\nAthens, Corinth, by the chisel, the pen, the compass, and the sword!\r\nStill farther away, the Delta, cloven by the seven tongues of Nile,\r\nSa\xc3\xafs, Boubastis, Heliopolis; then, travelling towards the South, that\r\nribbon of fertile land, the Heptanomos with the long array of its\r\ntwelve hundred riverside temples dedicated to all the gods, and further\r\nstill, Theba\xc3\xafs. Diospolis, the Isle of Elephants, the impassable\r\ncataracts, the Isle of Argo . . . Mero\xc3\xab . . . the unknown; and even, if\r\nit was permitted to believe the traditions of the Egyptians, the\r\ncountry of the fabulous lakes, whence escapes the antique Nile, lakes\r\nso vast that one loses sight of the horizon when crossing their purple\r\nflood, and perched so high upon the mountains that the stars are\r\nreflected in them like golden apples.\xe2\x80\x94all this, all, should be the\r\nkingdom, the domain, the possession of Chrysis, the courtesan.\r\n\r\nShe almost choked, and threw her arms on high as if she thought to\r\ntouch the heavens.\r\n\r\nAnd simultaneously, she watched on her left the slow flight towards the\r\nopen sea of a great bird with black wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nCLEOPATRA\r\n\r\nQueen Berenice had a young sister called Cleopatra. Many other Egyptian\r\nprincesses had borne the same name, but this girl became in later years\r\nthe great Cleopatra who destroyed her kingdom, and killed herself, as\r\none might say, on the corpse of her dead empire.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, she was twelve years of age, and no one could tell\r\nwhat her beauty would be. Her body, tall and thin, seemed out of place\r\nin a family where all the females were plump. She was ripening like\r\nsome badly-grafted, bastard fruit of foreign, obscure origin. Some of\r\nher lineaments were hard and bold, as seen in Macedonia; other traits\r\nappeared as if inherited from the depths of Nubia, where womankind is\r\ntender and swarthy, for her mother had been a female of inferior race\r\nwhose pedigree was doubtful. It was surprising to see Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s lips,\r\nalmost thick, under an aquiline nose of rather delicate shape. Her\r\nyoung breasts, very round, small, and widely separated, were crowned\r\nwith a swelling aureola, thereby showing she was a daughter of the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nThe little Princess lived in a spacious room, opening on to the vast\r\nsea and joined to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartment by a vestibule under a\r\ncolonnade.\r\n\r\nCleopatra passed the hours of the night on a bed of bluish silk, where\r\nthe skin of her young limbs, already of a dark hue, took on still\r\ndeeper tints.\r\n\r\nIt came to pass that in the night when\xe2\x80\x94far from her and her\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94the events already chronicled in these pages look place,\r\nCleopatra rose long before dawn. She had slept but little and badly,\r\nbeing anxious about her troubles of puberty which she had just\r\nexperienced, and disturbed by the extreme heat of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWithout waking the woman who watched over her slumbers, she softly put\r\nher feet to the ground, slipped her golden bangles round her ankles,\r\ngirded her little brown belly with a row of enormous pearls, and thus\r\naccoutred, left her chamber.\r\n\r\nIn the monumental corridor, armed guards were also sound asleep, except\r\none who stood sentinel at the door of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nHe fell on his knees and whispered in dire terror, as if he had never\r\nbefore found himself thus struggling in such a conflict of duty and\r\ndanger:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Cleopatra, I crave thy pardon! I cannot let thee pass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lass drew herself up to her full height, knitted her brows\r\nviolently, and dealt a dull blow on the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s forehead with her\r\nclenched fist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for thee,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in smothered accents, but with ferocious\r\nmeaning, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll raise a cry of rape, and have thee quartered!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, in silence, she entered the Queens chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBerenice was asleep, her head pillowed on her arm, her hand hanging\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nOver the great crimson couch, a hanging lamp mingled its feeble glare\r\nwith that of the moon, reflected by the whiteness of the walls. The\r\nvague, luminous outlines of the slumbering woman\xe2\x80\x99s supple nudity were\r\nthus enwrapped in misty shadow, between these two contrasting lights.\r\n\r\nSlender Cleopatra sat straight up on the edge of the bed. She took her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s face in her two little hands, waking Berenice up by touch and\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is your lover not with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nBerenice, startled, opened her lovely eyes.\r\n\r\nill-060\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCleopatra! What are you doing here? What do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is your lover not with you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the girl, insisting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he not with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not! You know that well enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue! He\xe2\x80\x99s never here. Oh, Cleopatra, how cruel of you to wake me, to\r\ntell me so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why is he always away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see him when he chooses,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Berenice, in grief. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94 for a minute or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not see him yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I met him by the roadside. I was in my litter. He got in with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as the Palace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94not quite. He was still in sight nearly as far as the gates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you tell him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was furious! I said most wicked things. Yes, darling, I did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the young girl, ironically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps too wicked, for he never answered me. Just when I felt myself\r\nscarlet with rage, he recited a long fable for my benefit. As I did not\r\nquite understand it, I did not know how to reply. He slipped out of the\r\nlitter, just as I thought of keeping him by my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not have called him back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feared to displease him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCleopatra, swelling with indignation, took her sister by the shoulders,\r\nand looking her full in the face, spoke thus to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow now! You are the Queen, the people\xe2\x80\x99s goddess! Half the world\r\nbelongs to you; all that Rome does not rule is yours; you reign over\r\nthe Nile and the entire ocean. You even reign over the heavens, since\r\nyou are nearer to the ear of the Gods than anyone, and yet you cannot\r\nreign over the man you love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReign . . . reign!\xe2\x80\x9d said Berenice, hanging her head. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s easy to\r\nsay, but, look you, one does not reign over a lover as if dominating a\r\nslave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause . . . But you cannot understand! To love, is to prefer the\r\nhappiness of another to that which we formerly selfishly desired before\r\nmeeting the loved one. Should Demetrios be content, so likewise would I\r\nbe, even weeping and far from his side. I wish for no delight that is\r\nnot his, and all I bestow on him gives me great joy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know not how to love,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lass.\r\n\r\nBerenice smiled sadly, then she stretched her two arms stiffly on\r\neither side of her couch, as she jutted out her breasts and arched her\r\nloins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, little presumptuous virgin!\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen for the first time\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll swoon in loving conjunction, then only will you understand why\r\none is never the queen of a man who causes you thus to lose your\r\nsenses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman can always be a queen should she so will it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she has no longer any power of will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have! Why should you not be the same? You are my elder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerenice smiled again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little girl, upon whom do you exercise your strength of will? On\r\nwhich one of your dolls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my lover!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nWithout allowing her sister time to find words to express her\r\nstupefaction, the damsel went on talking with growing vivacity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a lover! Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a lover! Why should I not have a\r\nsweetheart like everybody else, the same as you and my mother, and my\r\naunt, and the lowest woman in Egypt? A lover? Of a surety! And why not,\r\nprithee, seeing that for six months past, I am a woman, and you have\r\nnot yet found me a husband? Aye, Berenice, I have a lover. I\xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nlonger a little girl. I know now! I know! Be silent\xe2\x80\x94say nothing, for I\r\nknow more than you. I, too, have clasped my arms till they were fit to\r\nsnap, over the naked back of a man who thought he was my master. I,\r\ntoo, have crooked my toes in the empty air, feeling as if life was\r\nleaving me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve died a hundred times over in the same way as you\r\nhave swooned, but immediately afterwards, Berenice, I was on my feet,\r\nupstanding, erect! Say naught to me, for I am ashamed to claim you as\r\nmy Sovereign\xe2\x80\x94you, who are someone\xe2\x80\x99s slave!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Cleopatra drew herself up to her full height, endeavouring to\r\nappear as tall as possible. She took her head in her hands, like an\r\nAsiatic queen trying on a tiara.\r\n\r\nill-061\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated on the bed, her feet tucked under her, the elder sister\r\nlistened, and then knelt, so she could come near to the young lass and\r\nplace her hands on Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s sloping, slender shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve a lover?\xe2\x80\x9d Berenice now spoke timidly, almost respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me, you can look,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the girl, curtly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Berenice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it that you do not know this?\xe2\x80\x9d interrogated Cleopatra in her\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing, not even what goes on at the Palace. Demetrios is the\r\nonly subject of conversation I care about. I have not watched over you\r\nas I should have done, my child. All this is my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatch me if you like. When I can no longer have my own way, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kill\r\nmyself. Therefore, little care I, whatever happens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are free,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Berenice, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, it is\r\ntoo late to restrain you. But, answer me, darling. You have a lover\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94you manage to keep him to yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my way of holding him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI taught myself all alone. Such knowledge comes instinctively or\r\nnever. When I was but six years old, I knew how I meant to hold my\r\nsweetheart later on in life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBerenice rose slowly, put on a tunic and a mantle, shook out her heavy\r\ntresses, adhering together by the sweat of the bed, and both the\r\nsisters left the room.\r\n\r\nill-062\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleopatra crossed a courtyard._\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst went the youngest, straight along the vestibule, back to her bed.\r\nUnder the mattress of fresh, dry byssos, she took a newly-cut key.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me. It\xe2\x80\x99s rather far,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, turning to her sister.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the passage was a staircase which she ascended. Then\r\nshe glided along a never-ending colonnade, opened several doors,\r\nwalking on carpets, white marble slabs and the mosaic floors of a score\r\nof empty, silent apartments.\r\n\r\nShe descended a stone stairway, and stepped over the dark thresholds of\r\nclanging doors. Now and again, the two women came upon soldiers,\r\nresting on mats in couples, their spears close to their hands. Some\r\nlong time afterwards, Cleopatra crossed a courtyard lit up by the rays\r\nof the full moon, and the shadow of a palm-tree caressed her hips.\r\nBerenice, wrapped in her blue mantle, still followed her.\r\n\r\nAt last, they reached a massive door, clamped with iron like a\r\nwarrior\xe2\x80\x99s breastplate. In the lock, Cleopatra slipped her key, turning\r\nit twice. Then, pushing open the portal, a man\xe2\x80\x94a very giant in the\r\ndarkness\xe2\x80\x94rose to his full height out of the depths of his dungeon.\r\n\r\nBerenice stirred with emotion, looked in, and with drooping head, said\r\nvery softly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTis you, my child, who know not how to love. At least\xe2\x80\x94not yet. I was\r\nquite right when I told you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove for love, I prefer mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gives me naught but\r\njoy, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, erect on the prison threshold, and without making a step\r\nforward, she said to the man who stood in the shadow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome hither, and kiss my foot, son of a cur!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had done so, she pressed her mouth to his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nDEMETRIOS DREAMS A DREAM\r\n\r\nNow, with the mirror, the necklace, and the collar, Demetrios having\r\nreturned home, a dream visited him in his slumber, and this was his\r\ndream:\r\n\r\nHe is going towards the quay, mingled with the crowd, on a strange\r\nmoonless night, cloudless, but shedding a peculiar brilliance of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing why, or what it is that draws him, he is in a hurry to\r\narrive, to be _there_ as soon as he can, but he walks with effort, and\r\nthe air opposes an inexplicable resistance to his legs, as deep water\r\nhampers footsteps.\r\n\r\nHe trembles, he thinks he will never reach the goal, that he will never\r\nknow towards whom, in this bright obscurity, he is walking thus,\r\npanting and troubled.\r\n\r\nAt times, the crowd disappears entirely, whether it be that it really\r\nfades away, or that he ceases to be conscious of its presence. Then it\r\njostles more importunately than ever, and all press, on, on, on, with a\r\nquick and sonorous step, more quickly than he . . .\r\n\r\nThen the human mass closes in upon him; Demetrios pales; a man pushes\r\nhim with his shoulder; a woman\xe2\x80\x99s buckle tears his tunic; a young girl\r\nis wedged against him, so tightly that he feels the pressure of her\r\nnipples against his chest, and she pushes his face away with two\r\nterrified hands.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he is alone, the first, upon the quay. And as he turns to look\r\nbehind him, he perceives in the distance the white swarm of the crowd\r\nwhich has all at once receded to the Agora.\r\n\r\nAnd he realises that it will advance no further.\r\n\r\nThe quay lies white and straight like the first stage of an unfinished\r\nroad which has undertaken to cross the sea.\r\n\r\nHe wants to go to Pharos, and he walks. His legs have suddenly become\r\nlight. The wind blowing in the sandy deserts drives him headlong\r\ntowards the watery solitudes into which the quay plunges venturesomely.\r\nBut in proportion as he advances, Pharos retreats before him; the quay\r\nis immeasurably prolonged. Soon the high marble tower on which blazes a\r\npurple wood-pile touches the livid horizon, flickers, dies down, wanes,\r\nand sets like another moon.\r\n\r\nDemetrios walks ever onwards.\r\n\r\nill-063\r\n\r\n\r\nDays and nights seem to have passed since he left the great quay of\r\nAlexandria far behind him, and he dare not turn his head, for fear of\r\nseeing nothing but the road he has travelled along: a white line\r\nstretching to infinity\xe2\x80\x94and the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd still he turns round.\r\n\r\nAn island is behind him, covered with great trees whence droop enormous\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\nHas he crossed it like a blind man, or does it spring into sight at the\r\nsame instant and become mysteriously visible? He does not think of\r\nconjecturing: he accepts the impossible as a natural event . . .\r\n\r\nA woman is in the isle. She is standing before the door of its one\r\nhouse, with her eyes half closed and her face bending over a monstrous\r\niris-flower that reaches to the level of her lips. She has heavy hair,\r\nthe colour of dull gold, and of a length one may surmise to be\r\nmarvellous, judging by the mass of the great coil that lies on her\r\ndrooping neck. A black tunic envelopes this woman, and a robe blacker\r\nstill is draped upon the tunic, and the iris whose perfume she breathes\r\nwith downcast eyelids is of the same hue as night.\r\n\r\nIn all this mourning garb, Demetrios sees but the hair, like a golden\r\nvase on an ebony column. He recognises Chrysis.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of the mirror and of the necklace and of the comb\r\nrecurs to him vaguely; but he does not believe in it, and in this\r\nsingular vision reality alone seems to him a dream . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cFollow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe follows her. She slowly mounts a staircase strewn with white skins.\r\nHer arm rests upon the rail. Her naked heels float in and out from\r\nunder her robe.\r\n\r\nThe house has but one storey. Chrysis halts at the topmost step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are four chambers,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have seen them, you will never leave them. Will you follow\r\nme? Have you confidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-064\r\n\r\n\r\n_A monstrous iris-flower reaches to the level of her lips._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he will follow her everywhere. She opens the first door and closes\r\nit behind him.\r\n\r\nThis room is long and narrow. It is lighted by a single window, through\r\nwhich is seen enframed the great expanse of sea. On the right and left\r\nare two small tables and on them a dozen book-rolls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the books you love,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chrysis. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios opens them: they are _The Oineus_ of Ch\xc3\xa6remon, _The Return_\r\nof Alexis, _The Mirror of Lais_ of Aristippos, _The Enchantress_, _The\r\nCyclops_, the _Bucolics_ of Theocritos, _\xc5\x92dipus at Colonos_, the _Odes_\r\nof Sappho, and several other little works. Upon a pile of cushions, in\r\nthe midst of this ideal library, there is a naked girl who utters no\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs Chrysis, drawing from a long golden coder a manuscript\r\nconsisting of a single leaf, \xe2\x80\x9chere is the page of antique poesy that\r\nyou never read alone without weeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man reads at a venture:\r\n\r\n[Greek: Hoi men ar\xe2\x80\x99 ethr\xc3\xaaneon, epi de stenachonto gynaikes.\r\nT\xc3\xaasin d\xe2\x80\x99Andromach\xc3\xaa leuk\xc3\xb4lenos \xc3\xaarche gooio,\r\nHektoros androphonoio kar\xc3\xaa meta chersin echousa;\r\nAner, ap\xe2\x80\x99 ai\xc3\xb4nos neos \xc3\xb4leo, kadde me ch\xc3\xaar\xc3\xaan\r\nLeipeis en megaroisi; pais d\xe2\x80\x99eti n\xc3\xaapios aut\xc3\xb4s,\r\nHon tekomen sy t\xe2\x80\x99eg\xc3\xb4 te dysammoroi. . .]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stops, casting upon Chrysis a look of surprise and tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou show me this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you have not seen everything. Follow me. Follow me quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey open another door.\r\n\r\nThe second chamber is square. It is lighted by a single window, through\r\nwhich is seen enframed all nature. In the midst, stands a wooden\r\ntrestle bearing a lump of red clay, and in a corner, a naked girl lies\r\nupon a curved chair, and utters no word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you will model Andromeda and Zagreus and the Horses of the Sun.\r\nAs you will create them for yourself alone, you will break them in\r\npieces before your death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the House of Felicity,\xe2\x80\x9d says Demetrios in a low voice.\r\n\r\nAnd he lets his forehead sink into his hands.\r\n\r\nBut Chrysis opens another door.\r\n\r\nThe third chamber is vast and round. It is lighted by a single window,\r\nthrough which is seen enframed the great expanse of blue sky. Its walls\r\nconsist of gratings of bronze bars so disposed as to form\r\nlozenge-shaped interstices. Through them glides a music of flutes and\r\npipes played to a doleful measure by invisible musicians. And against\r\nthe far wall, upon a throne of green marble, sits a naked girl who\r\nutters no word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! Come!\xe2\x80\x9d repeats Chrysis.\r\n\r\nThey open another door.\r\n\r\nill-065\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth chamber is low, sombre, hermetically closed, and triangular.\r\nThick carpets and rugs array it so luxuriously from floor to roof that\r\nnudity is not astonished in it. Lovers can easily imagine that they\r\nhave cast off their garments upon the walls in all directions. When the\r\ndoor is closed again, it is impossible to guess where it was. There is\r\nno window. It is a narrow world, outside the world. A few wisps of\r\nblack hair hanging to the cushions shed tear-drops of perfumes. And\r\nthis chamber is lighted by seven little myrrhine panes which colour\r\ndiversely the incomprehensible light of seven subterranean lamps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee,\xe2\x80\x9d explains the woman in an affectionate and tranquil tone, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\r\nare three different beds in the three corners of _our_ chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios does not answer. And he asks within himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really a last term? Is it truly a goal of human existence? Have\r\nI then passed through the other three chambers only to stop in this\r\none? And shall I, shall I ever be able to leave it if I lie in it a\r\nwhole night in the attitude of love which is the prostration of the\r\ntomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Chrysis speaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-Beloved, you asked for me; I am come, look at me well . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raises her two arms together, lays her hands upon her hair, and,\r\nwith her elbows projecting in front of her, smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-Beloved, I am yours . . . Oh! not immediately . . . I promised\r\nyou to sing, I will sing first . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he thinks of her no more, and lays him down at her feet. She has\r\nlittle black sandals. Four threads of blue pearls pass between the\r\ndainty toes, on the nails of which has been painted a carmine lunar\r\ncrescent.\r\n\r\nWith her head reposing on her shoulder, she taps on the palm of her\r\nleft hand with her right, and undulates her hips almost imperceptibly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy night, on my bed,\r\nI sought him whom my soul loveth:\r\nI sought him, but I found him not. . . . .\r\nI charge ye, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,\r\nIf ye find my beloved,\r\nTell him\r\nThat I am sick of love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is the Song of Songs, Demetrios. It is the nuptial canticle of\r\nthe women of my country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sleep, but my heart waketh:\r\nIt is the voice of my beloved . . .\r\nThat knocketh at my door,\r\nThe voice of my beloved!\r\nHe cometh,\r\nLeaping upon the mountains\r\nLike a roe\r\nOr a young hart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy beloved speaks, and says unto me:\r\nOpen unto me, my sister, my fair one:\r\nMy head is filled with dew,\r\nAnd my locks with the drops of the night.\r\nRise up, my love, my fair one,\r\nAnd come away.\r\nFor lo, the winter is past,\r\nThe rain is over and gone,\r\nThe flowers appear on the earth.\r\nThe time of the singing of birds is come,\r\nThe voice of the turtle-dove is heard in the land.\r\nRise up, my love, my fair one,\r\nAnd come away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe casts her veil away, and stands up arrayed in some tight-fitting\r\nstuff wound closely round the legs and hips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have put off my coat;\r\nHow shall I put it on?\r\nI have washed my feet:\r\nHow shall I defile them?\r\nMy well-beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door,\r\nAnd my bowels were moved for him.\r\nI rose up to open to my beloved,\r\nAnd my hands dropped with myrrh,\r\nAnd my fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh,\r\nUpon the handles of the lock.\r\nLet him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!\r\n\r\n\r\nShe throws her head back and half closes her eyelids.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay me, comfort me,\r\nFor I am sick of love.\r\nLet his left hand be under my head\r\nAnd his right hand embrace me.\r\nThou hast ravished my heart, my sister, with\r\none of thine eyes,\r\nWith one chain of thy neck.\r\nHow fair is thy love!\r\nHow fair are thy caresses!\r\nHow much better than wine!\r\nThe smell of thee pleaseth me more than all spices.\r\nThy lips drop as the honeycomb:\r\nHoney and milk are under thy tongue.\r\nThe smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA garden enclosed is my sister,\r\nA spring shut up, a fountain sealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwake, O north wind!\r\nBlow, thou south!\r\nBlow upon my garden,\r\nThat the spices thereof may flow out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rounds her arms, and holds out her mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet my beloved come into his garden\r\nAnd eat of his pleasant fruits.\r\nYes, I come into my garden,\r\nO! my sister, my spouse,\r\nI gather my myrrh with my spice,\r\nI eat my honeycomb with my honey.\r\nI drink my wine with my milk.\r\nSET ME AS A SEAL UPON THINE HEART\r\nAS A SEAL UPON THINE ARM\r\nFOR LOVE IS STRONG AS DEATH.\xe2\x80\x9d [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout moving her feet, without bending her tightly-pressed knees, she\r\nslowly turns her body upon her motionless hips. Her face and her two\r\nbreasts, above her tightly-swathed legs, seem three great pink flowers\r\nin a flower-holder made of stuffs.\r\n\r\nShe dances gravely, with her shoulders and her head and the\r\nintermingling of her beautiful arms. She seems to suffer in her sheath\r\nand to reveal ever and ever more the whiteness of her half imprisoned\r\nbody. Her breathing inflates her breast. Her mouth cannot close. Her\r\neyelids cannot open. A heightening flame flushes her cheeks.\r\n\r\nNow her ten interlocked fingers join before her face. Now she raises\r\nher arms. She strains voluptuously. A long fugitive groove separates\r\nher shoulders as they rise and fall. Finally, with a single movement of\r\nher body, enveloping her panting visage in her hair as with a bridal\r\nveil, she tremblingly unfastens the sculptured clasp which retained her\r\ngarment about her loins, and allows all the mystery of her grace to\r\nslip down upon the ground.\r\n\r\nDemetrios and Chrysis . . .\r\n\r\nTheir first embracement before love is immediately so perfect, so\r\nharmonious, that they keep it immobile, in order fully to know its\r\nmultiple voluptuousness. One of her breasts stands out erect and round,\r\nfrom under the strong encircling arm of Demetrios. One of her burning\r\nthighs is rivetted between his two legs, and the other lies with all\r\nits heavy weight thrown upon them. They remain thus, motionless,\r\nclasped together but not penetrated, in the rising exaltation of an\r\ninflexible desire which they are loth to satisfy. At first, they catch\r\nat one another with their mouths alone. They intoxicate each other with\r\nthe contact of their aching and ungated virginities.\r\n\r\nill-066\r\n\r\n\r\n_She dances gravely with her shoulders and her head._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe look at nothing so minutely as the face of the woman we love. Seen\r\nat the excessively close range of the kiss, Chrysis\xe2\x80\x99s eyes seem\r\nenormous. When she closes them, two parallel creases remain on each\r\neyelid, and a leaden-hued patch extends from the brilliant eyebrows to\r\nthe verge of the cheeks. When she opens them, a green ring, fine as a\r\nsilken thread, illumines with a coloured coronal the fathomless black\r\neyeball immeasurably distended under the long curved lashes. The little\r\npellet of red flesh whence the tears flow has sudden palpitations.\r\n\r\nTheir kiss is endless. Chrysis would seem to have under her tongue, not\r\nmilk and honey, as in Holy Writ, but living, mobile, enchanted water.\r\nAnd this multiform tongue itself, now incurved like an arch, now rolled\r\nup like a spiral, now shrinking into its hiding-place, now darting\r\nforth like a flame, more caressing than the hand, more expressive than\r\nthe eyes, circling, flower-like, into a pistil, or thinning away into a\r\npetal, this ribbon of flesh that hardens when it quivers and softens\r\nwhen it licks, Chrysis animates it with all the resources of her\r\nendearing and passionate fantasy . . . Then she showers on him a series\r\nof prolonged caresses that twist and turn. Her nervous finger-tips\r\nsuffice to grasp him tightly, and to produce convulsive tremblings\r\nalong his sides. She is happy only when palpitating with desire or\r\nenervated by exhaustion: the transition terrifies her like a torture.\r\nAs soon as her lover summons her, she thrusts him away with rigid arms:\r\nshe presses her knees close together, she supplicates him dumbly with\r\nher lips. Demetrios constrains her by force.\r\n\r\n...No spectacle of nature, neither the blazing glory of the setting\r\nsun, nor the tempest in the palm-trees, nor the mirage, nor the mighty\r\nupheavals of the waters, seem worthy of astonishment to those who have\r\nwitnessed the transfiguration of a woman in their arms. Chrysis becomes\r\nextraordinary. Arching her body upwards, and sinking back again in\r\nturns, with her bent elbow resting on the cushions, she seizes the\r\ncorner of a pillow, clutches at it like a dying woman, and gasps for\r\nbreath, with her head thrown back. Her eyes, brilliant with gratitude,\r\nfix the madness of their glance at the corner of the eyelids. Her\r\ncheeks are resplendent. The curve of her swaying hair is disconcerting.\r\nTwo admirable, muscular lines, descending from the ear and the\r\nshoulder, meet under the right breast and bear it like a fruit.\r\n\r\nDemetrios contemplates this divine madness in the feminine body with a\r\nsort of religious awe\xe2\x80\x94this transport of a whole being, this superhuman\r\nconvulsion of which he is the direct cause, which he exalts or\r\nrepresses at will, and which confounds him for the thousandth time.\r\n\r\nUnder his very eyes all the mighty forces of life strain in the effort\r\nto create. The breasts have already assumed, up to their very tips,\r\nmaternal majesty. And these wails, these lamentable wails that\r\nprematurely weep over the labour of childbirth! . . .\r\n\r\n [1] Song of Songs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE PANIC\r\n\r\nFar above the sea and the Gardens of the Goddess, the moon poured down\r\ntorrents of light.\r\n\r\nMelitta\xe2\x80\x94that little damsel, so delicate and slender, possessed by\r\nDemetrios for a fleeting moment, and who had offered to take him to\r\nChimairis, learned in chiromancy\xe2\x80\x94had remained behind alone with the\r\nfortune-teller, crouching, and still fierce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not follow that man,\xe2\x80\x9d Chimairis had said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I will! I\xe2\x80\x99ve not even asked him if I am ever to see him again.\r\nLet me run after him to kiss him, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99ll not see him ever more. And so much the better, my girl.\r\nWomen who meet him once, learn to knew pain. Women who meet him twice,\r\ntrifle with death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-067\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cOh, prophetess of evil! Take back what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy say it? I\xe2\x80\x99ve just met him, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only trifled with pleasure in\r\nhis arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou owe your pleasure to him because you do not know what\r\nvoluptuousness means, my tiniest of tiny girls. Forget him as you would\r\na playmate and congratulate yourself on being only twelve years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo one is very unhappy when grown up?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the women\r\nhere chatter unceasingly of their troubles, and I, who never hardly\r\ncry, see so many weeping!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChimairis dug her two hands into her hair and uttered a groan. Her goat\r\nshook its gold collar and turned its head in her direction, but she did\r\nnot bestow a glance on the animal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I know one happy woman,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Melitta,\r\nsignificantly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my great friend, Chrysis. I\xe2\x80\x99m certain she never\r\nsheds a tear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chimairis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, prophetess of evil! Take back what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, distraught old\r\nwoman, or I shall hate you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s threatening gestures, the black goat reared up\r\nerect, its front legs bent under; its horns thrust forward.\r\n\r\nMelitta fled without looking where she went.\r\n\r\nTwenty paces farther on, she burst out laughing, as she caught sight of\r\na ridiculous couple hidden between two bushes. That sufficed to change\r\nthe current of her young thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe took the longest road before returning to her hut, and then decided\r\nnot to go home at all. It was a magnificent, warm, moonlight night. The\r\ngardens were full of many voices and songs. Satisfied with what she had\r\nearned through the visit of Demetrios, she was seized with a sudden\r\nfancy to play the part of a vagrant girl of roads and ditches, in the\r\ndepths of the wood, with pauper passers-by. In this way, she was\r\nenjoyed twice or three against a tree, a stone pillar, or on a bench,\r\nand found amusement as if the game was new, because the scene kept\r\nchanging. A soldier, standing in the middle of a pathway, lifted her\r\nbodily up in his robust arms and identified himself with the God of the\r\nGardens who joins himself to the wenches who tend the rose-trees\r\nwithout needing to let the hussies feet touch the ground. At this,\r\nMelitta uttered a cry of triumph.\r\n\r\nEscaping again, she continued her flight through an avenue of palms,\r\nwhere she met a lad, named Mikyllos, seemingly lost in the forest. She\r\noffered to be his guide, but led him astray designedly, so as to keep\r\nhim with her for her own purposes. Mikyllos was not long in fathoming\r\nMelitta\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, as well as her tiny talents and capabilities.\r\nSoon becoming companions, rather than lovers, they ran along side by\r\nside in solitude that grew more and more silent. Suddenly, they came in\r\nfront of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe spot where they found themselves was far distant from the parts\r\nwhere the courtesans generally celebrated the rites of their religious\r\nprofession. Why they chose other trysting-places in preference to\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94the most admirable of all\xe2\x80\x94they could not have told you. The part\r\nof the wood where the crowd gathered soon became a notorious central\r\nalley, surrounded by a network of bypaths and starry glades. On the\r\noutskirts, despite the charm or the beauty of the sites, there reigned\r\neternal solitude where luxuriant vegetation flourished peacefully.\r\n\r\nThus strolling, hand in hand, Mikyllos and Melitta reached the limit of\r\nthe public park, a low hedge of aloes, forming a useless dividing line\r\nbetween the gardens of Aphrodite and those of her High Priest.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the hushed solitude of this flowery wilderness, the young\r\ncouple easily climbed over the irregular wall formed by the quaint\r\ntwisted plants. The Mediterranean, at their feet, slowly swept the\r\nshore, with wavelets like the fringes of a river. The two children\r\nwaded in breast-high and chased each other, laughing meanwhile, as they\r\ntried to effect difficult conjunctions in the water. They soon put an\r\nend to these sports, which failed like games insufficiently rehearsed.\r\nAfter that, luminous and dripping wet, wriggling their frog-like legs\r\nin the moonlight, they sprang upon the dark edge of the sea.\r\n\r\nTraces of footprints on the sand urged the boy and girl onwards. They\r\nwalked, ran, and struggled, pulling each other by the hand; their\r\nblack, well-defined shadows sketching bold outlines of their two\r\nfigures. How far were they to go in this wise? They saw no other living\r\nthings on the immense azure horizon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Melitta, all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA courtesan! Oh, the shameless thing! She has fallen asleep in the\r\nopen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Melitta, shaking her head. \xe2\x80\x9cI dare not go near her,\r\nMikyllos. She\xe2\x80\x99s no courtesan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have thought she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I say, Mikyllos, she\xe2\x80\x99s not one of us. It\xe2\x80\x99s Touni, wife of the High\r\nPriest. Look well at her. She is not asleep. Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to approach\r\nher. Her eyes are wide open! Let us go away! I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid\xe2\x80\x94oh, so afraid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMikyllos made three steps forward on tip-toe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right, Melitta. She is not sleeping, poor woman! She is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a pin in her heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hand to draw it from her breast, but Melitta was\r\nterrified.\r\n\r\nill-068\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Touch her not! She is sacred! Remain by her side, watch over\r\nher, protect her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call for help. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fled with all the strength of her legs into the deep shadow of the\r\nblack trees.\r\n\r\nAlone and trembling, Mikyllos wandered round the corpse of the young\r\nwoman. He touched the pierced breast with his finger. Then, either\r\nscared by death, or more likely fearing to be taken for an accomplice\r\nof the murder, he suddenly took to his heels, resolved to apprise no\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe icy nakedness of Touni remained as before, abandoned in the bright\r\nlight of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA long time afterwards, the woods near where she lay became filled with\r\nmurmurs which were frightful because almost imperceptible.\r\n\r\nOn all sides, between tree-trunks and bushes, a thousand courtesans,\r\nhuddled together like frightened sheep, advanced slowly, their masses\r\nquivering with a unanimous shudder.\r\n\r\nBy a movement as regular as that of the sea striking the sandy\r\nforeshore, the front rank of this army made way for those following\r\nbehind. It seemed as if nobody wanted to be the first to find the dead\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nA great cry, taken up by a thousand mouths and dying away at a\r\ndistance, arose to salute the poor corpse when it was perceived\r\nstretched out at the foot of a tree.\r\n\r\nA thousand naked arms were first uplifted and then as many others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoddess! Not on us!\xe2\x80\x9d now sobbed many voices. \xe2\x80\x9cGoddess, not on us! If\r\nthou wreakest vengeance, Goddess, spare our lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Temple!\xe2\x80\x9d was the rallying-cry arising from one despairing\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nill-069\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the gates for us!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Temple! To the Temple!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated all the other women.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, a new eddy convulsed the surging multitude. Without\r\ndaring to cast another look at the dead woman, stretched out on her\r\nback on the ground, her eyes upturned and her arms thrown back, all the\r\ncourtesans in one great mob, black women and white, those of the East\r\nand the West, some in sumptuous robes and others in vague nudity,\r\nscampered through the trees, rushing across glades, paths, and roads;\r\nswarming into the vast open spaces in front of the houses, until they\r\nmounted the gigantic pink marble staircase that gleamed deeply red in\r\nthe light of coming day. With their weak clenched fists, they battered\r\nthe lofty bronze doors, squalling childishly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the gates for us! Open! Let us in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTHE CROWD\r\n\r\nThe morning the orgie at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s came to an end an event took place\r\nat Alexandria: rain fell.\r\n\r\nImmediately, contrarily to what usually happens in countries less\r\nAfrican, everybody went out to welcome the shower.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon was neither torrent-like nor stormy. Large warm drops\r\nfell from a violet cloud and traversed the air. The men looked at the\r\nsky with interest. The little children roared with laughter, and went\r\nabout splashing their tiny naked feet in the surface-mud.\r\n\r\nThen the cloud faded away in the light, the sky remained implacably\r\npure, and a short time after midday the mud had once more turned into\r\ndust under the sun.\r\n\r\nBut this momentary shower had sufficed. It filled the town with gaiety.\r\nThe men congregated on the pavement of the Agora, and the women\r\nthronged together in groups, intermingling their shrill voices.\r\n\r\nOnly the courtesans were there, for the third day of the Aphrodis\xc3\xa6\r\nbeing reserved for the exclusive devotions of the married women, the\r\nlatter had just started for the Astarte\xc3\xafon in a great procession, and\r\nthere was nothing in the square but flowered robes and eyes blackened\r\nwith paint.\r\n\r\nAs Myrtocleia passed by, a young girl called Philotis, who was talking\r\nwith many others, pulled her by the sleeve knot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo, my little lass! you played at Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s yesterday? What happened?\r\nWhat took place there? Did Bacchis put on a new necklace to hide the\r\ncavities in her neck? Has she got wooden breasts or copper ones? Did\r\nshe forget to dye the little white hairs on her temples before putting\r\non her wig? Come, speak, fried fish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose I looked at her? I arrived after the banquet, I played\r\nmy piece, I received my payment, and I ran off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t dissipate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo stain my robe and receive blows? No, Philotis. Only rich women can\r\nafford to indulge in orgies. Little flute-girls get nothing but tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stain one\xe2\x80\x99s robe, one leaves it in the\r\nante-chamber. When one receives blows, one insists on being paid\r\ndouble. It is quite elementary. So you have nothing to tell us? not an\r\nadventure, not a joke, not a scandal? We are yawning like storks.\r\nInvent something if you know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend Theano stayed after me. When I awoke a few minutes ago, she\r\nhad not yet come. The f\xc3\xaate is perhaps still going on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is finished,\xe2\x80\x9d said another woman. \xe2\x80\x9cTheano is down there, by the\r\nceramic wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe courtesans started off at a run, but presently stopped with a smile\r\nof pity.\r\n\r\nTheano, in a naive fit of drunkenness, was obstinately pulling at a\r\nrose stripped of its leaves, the thorns of which were caught in her\r\nhair. Her yellow tunic was soiled with red and white stains as if she\r\nhad borne the brunt of the whole orgie. The bronze clasp, which kept up\r\nup the converging folds of the stuff upon her left shoulder, dangled\r\nbelow the waist, and revealed the mobile globe of a young breast\r\nalready too mature, and which was stained with two spots of purple.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw Myrtocleia, she brusquely went off into a peal of\r\nsingular laughter. Everybody knew it at Alexandria, and it had procured\r\nher the nickname of the \xe2\x80\x9cFowl.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an interminable cluck-cluck, a\r\ntorrent of gaiety which commenced in a very low key and took her breath\r\naway, then shot up again into a shrill cry, and so forth, rhythmically,\r\nlike the joy of a triumphant hen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn egg! an egg!\xe2\x80\x9d said Philotis.\r\n\r\nill-070\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Myrtocleia made a gesture:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Theano, come to bed. You are not well. Come with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! . . . ha! . . . Ah! . . . ha!\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the child. And she took her\r\nbreast in her little hand, crying in a hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! . . . Ha! . . . the mirror . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Myrto, losing patience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mirror . . . it is stolen, stolen! Ah! haaa! I shall never laugh\r\nso much again if I live to be as old as Chronos. Stolen, stolen, the\r\nsilver mirror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singing-girl tried to drag her away, but Philotis had understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried to the others, waving her two arms. \xe2\x80\x9cCome here quickly!\r\nThere is news! Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s mirror has been stolen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapai\xc3\xab! Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s mirror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn an instant, thirty women crowded round the flute-girl:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is happening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBacchis has had her mirror stolen: Theano has just said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has taken it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe child shrugged her shoulders:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou passed the night there. You must know. It is not possible. Who\r\nentered her house? You have certainly been told. Try to collect\r\nyourself, Theano.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-071\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thirty women crowded round the flute-girl._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I know about it? There were more than twenty of them in the\r\nbanqueting room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had hired me to play the flute, but they prevented me from\r\nplaying because they do not like music. They asked me to mimic the\r\nfigure of Dana\xc3\xab and they threw gold coins at me, and Bacchis took them\r\nall away from me . . . It was a band of madmen. They made me drink head\r\ndownwards out of a bowl overflowing with wine. They had poured seven\r\ntankards in it because there were seven wines upon the table. My face\r\nwas all dripping. Even my hair was soaked, and my roses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Myrto, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are an awful fright. But the mirror? Who\r\ntook it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly! when they put me on my feet again, my head was suffused with\r\nblood, and I was covered with wine up to the ears. Ha! Ha! they all\r\nbegan to laugh . . . Bacchis sent for the mirror . . . Ha! ha! it had\r\ndisappeared. Somebody had taken it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? That is what we want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not I, that is all I know. It was no use searching me: I was\r\nquite naked. I cannot hide a mirror under my eyelid, like a drachma. It\r\nwas not I, that is all I know. She crucified a slave, perhaps on\r\naccount of that. When I saw that they were not looking at me, I picked\r\nup the Dana\xc3\xab coins. See, Myrto, I have five: you shall buy robes for\r\nthe three of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the theft spread gradually over the whole square. The\r\ncourtesans did not hide their envious satisfaction. A noisy curiosity\r\nanimated the moving groups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philotis; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a woman who is responsible for\r\nthis piece of work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the mirror was well hidden. A thief could have carried off\r\neverything in the room and upset everything without finding the stone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBacchis had enemies, especially her former friends. They knew all her\r\nsecrets. One of them has probably enticed her away somewhere, and then\r\nentered her house at the hour when the sun is hot and the streets are\r\nalmost deserted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! she has perhaps sold the mirror to pay her debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSupposing it were one of her lovers? They say she takes porters now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is a woman, I am sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the two goddesses! it serves her right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a still more excited mob rushed towards a point of the Agora,\r\nfollowed by a rising rumour which drew all the passers-by after it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? what is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd a shrill voice dominating the tumult shouted over all their heads:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe High-Priest\xe2\x80\x99s wife has been killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nViolent consternation took possession of the crowd. It was incredible.\r\nPeople refuse to believe that so atrocious a murder could have been\r\ncommitted at the very height of the Aphrodisis\xc3\xa6, bringing down the\r\nwrath of the gods upon the town. But the same sentence passed from\r\nmouth to mouth in all directions:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wife of the High-Priest has been killed! The festival at the\r\nTemple is put off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNews arrived rapidly. The body had been found, lying on a pink marble\r\nseat, in a lonely place, at the summit of the gardens.\r\n\r\nA long golden pin penetrated her left breast; the wound had not bled;\r\nbut the assassin had cut off all the young woman\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and had\r\ncarried away the antique comb of Queen Nitaoucrit.\r\n\r\nAfter the first exclamations of anguish, a profound stupor gained the\r\nuppermost. The whole multitude grew every minute. The whole town was\r\nthere: it was a sea of bare heads and women\xe2\x80\x99s hats, an immense herd\r\npouring simultaneously from the streets bathed in blue shade into the\r\ndazzling brilliance of the Alexandrian Agora. Such a throng had never\r\nbeen seen since the day when Ptolemy Auleter had been driven from the\r\nthrone by the partisans of Berenice. And even political revolutions\r\nseemed less terrible than this piece of sacrilege, on which the safety\r\nof the whole city might depend.\r\n\r\nThe men pushed their way close to the witnesses. They clamoured for\r\nfurther details. They put forth conjectures. Women informed the new\r\narrivals of the theft of the celebrated mirror. The wiseacres swore\r\nthat these two simultaneous crimes had been committed by the same hand.\r\n\r\nBut who could it be? Courtesans, who had made their offerings the night\r\nbefore for the ensuing year, were fearful lest the goddess should pay\r\nno attention to them, and sat sobbing, with their heads buried in their\r\nrobes.\r\n\r\nAn ancient superstition had it that two such events would be followed\r\nby a third and still graver one. The crowd awaited the third. After the\r\nmirror and the comb, what had the mysterious robber taken? A stifling\r\natmosphere, inflamed by the south wind and filled with sand dust,\r\nweighed upon the motionless crowd.\r\n\r\nGradually, as if this human mass were a single being, it was seized\r\nwith a shivering which grew little by little until it became a panic,\r\nand all eyes were turned towards the same point on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was at the distant extremity of the long straight avenue which\r\ntraversed Alexandria from the Canopic gate and led from the Temple to\r\nthe Agora. There, on the top of the gentle incline, where the road\r\nopened upon the sky, a second terror-stricken multitude had just made\r\nits appearance and was running down the hill to join the first one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe courtesans, the sacred courtesans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody stirred. Nobody dared to go and meet them, for fear of hearing\r\nof a new disaster. They arrived like a living flood, preceded by the\r\ndull noise of their footsteps on the ground. They waved their arms,\r\nthey jostled one another, they seemed to be in flight before an army.\r\nThey were to be recognised now. One could distinguish their robes,\r\ntheir girdles, their hair. Rays of light gleamed on their golden\r\njewels. They were quite near. They opened their mouths. There was a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe necklace of the Goddess has been stolen, the True Pearls of\r\nAnadyomene are gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-072\r\n\r\n\r\nA clamour of despair arose at the fatal utterance. The crowd retreated\r\nat first like a wave, then poured headlong forward, beating the walls,\r\nfilling the road, thrusting back the frightened women, in the long\r\navenue of the Dromos, towards the desecrated immortal saint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE RESPONSE\r\n\r\nAnd the Agora was left empty, like a beach after the tide.\r\n\r\nEmpty, but not completely: a man and a woman stayed behind, the only\r\ntwo mortals who knew the secret of the great public emotion, the two\r\nbeings who were the cause of it: Chrysis and Demetrios.\r\n\r\nThe young man was seated on a block of marble near the port. The young\r\nwoman stood at the opposite end of the square. They could not recognise\r\none another; but they divined one another mutually: Chrysis, drunk with\r\npride and finally with desire, ran in the full glare of the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done it!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have done it, then!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man simply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are obeyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quickly sat herself on his knees and embraced him deliriously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love you! I love you! I have never before felt what I feel now!\r\nGods! At last I know what it is to be in love! You see, my beloved, I\r\ngive you more than I promised you the day before yesterday. I, who have\r\nnever denied anyone, I could not dream that should change so quickly. I\r\nhad only sold you my body upon the bed, now I give you all my\r\nexcellence, all my purity, my sincerity, my passion, my virgin soul,\r\nDemetrios. Come with me; let us leave this town for a time; let us go\r\ninto a hidden place, where there are only you and I. We will spend days\r\nsuch as the world has never seen. Never did a lover do what you have\r\ndone for me. Never did a woman love as I love: it is not possible! it\r\nis not possible! I can hardly speak. I am choking. You see, I weep. I\r\nknow now what it is to weep: it is through excess of happiness. But you\r\ndo not answer! You say nothing? Kiss me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios stretched out his right leg to ease his knee, which was a\r\nlittle cramped. Then he raised the young woman, stood up, shook the\r\ncreases out of his garments, and said softly with an enigmatic smile:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo . . . Adieu . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-073\r\n\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x9cYou say nothing! Kiss me!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he tranquilly turned away.\r\n\r\nChrysis stood rooted to the ground with stupefaction, her mouth open\r\nand her head dangling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? What . . . what . . . what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say adieu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without raising his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut . . . but it cannot be you who . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I had promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen . . . I fail to understand . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, whether you understand or not is a matter of indifference to\r\nme. I leave this little mystery to your meditations. If what you have\r\ntold me is true, they are likely to be prolonged. This affair occurs\r\nmost conveniently to give them occupation. Adieu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios! What do I hear? . . . what is the meaning of this tone? Is\r\nit really you who speak? Explain! I conjure you! What has happened\r\nbetween us? It is enough to make one dash one\xe2\x80\x99s head against the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to repeat the same thing a hundred times? Yes, I have taken the\r\nmirror; yes, I have killed the priestess Touni in order to get the\r\npeerless comb; yes, I have stolen the great seven-stringed necklace of\r\nthe goddess. I was to hand you over the presents in exchange for a\r\nsingle sacrifice on your part. It was putting it at a high value, was\r\nit not? Now, I have ceased to estimate it at this extraordinary value,\r\nand I have nothing more to ask of you. Act in the same way, and let us\r\npart. I wonder you do not understand a situation the simplicity of\r\nwhich is so evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your presents! Do you suppose I care about them? It is yourself\r\nthat I want, you, you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know. But once again, I am not willing, and, as the consent of\r\nboth the parties is necessary for a rendez-vous, I am very much afraid\r\nit will not take place, if I persist in my present views. This is what\r\nI am trying to impress upon you with all the clearness of diction of\r\nwhich I am capable. I see it is inadequate; but as I cannot improve it,\r\nI beg you to kindly accept the accomplished fact with a good grace,\r\nwithout prying into what you consider obscure about it, since you do\r\nnot admit that it is within the limits of probability. I am most\r\nanxious to bring this discussion to an end. It can lead to no result,\r\nand might perhaps force me to be impolite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have been tittle-tattling about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I guess as much! People have been talking about me, don\xe2\x80\x99t deny\r\nit. They have said things about me behind my back! I have terrible\r\nenemies, Demetrios! You must not listen to them: I swear to you by the\r\ngods, they lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me! Believe me, Well-beloved! What interest could I have in\r\ndeceiving you, since I desire nothing from you except yourself? You are\r\nthe first person I have ever spoken to like this . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-074\r\n\r\n\r\nDemetrios looked her in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too late,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have possessed you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are raving . . . When? Where? How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak the truth. I have possessed you in spite of yourself. What I\r\nhoped from your complaisance you have given me without your knowledge.\r\nYou took me to the country you want to go to, in a dream, last night,\r\nand you were beautiful . . . ah! you were beautiful, Chrysis! I have\r\nreturned from that country. No human will shall force me to see it\r\nagain. The same event never brings happiness twice. I am not so mad as\r\nto ruin a happy souvenir. I am indebted for this to you, you will say;\r\nbut as I have only loved your shadow, you will dispense me, dear\r\ncreature, from thanking your reality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis pressed her hands to her temples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is abominable, abominable! And he dares to say this! And he makes a\r\nboast of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou jump to definite conclusions very quickly. I have told you that I\r\nhave had a dream: are you sure that I was asleep? I have told you that\r\nI was happy: does happiness, according to you, consist in the gross\r\nphysical thrill which you say you are so expert in producing, but which\r\nyou cannot diversify, since it is much the same with all women who give\r\nthemselves! No, it is yourself that you belittle by taking this most\r\nunbecoming point of view. I think you do not quite realise all the\r\nfelicities which spring from under your footsteps. What differentiates\r\nmistresses from one another is that they have each a fashion, personal\r\nto themselves, of preparing and terminating an incident which, as a\r\nmatter of fact, is as monstrous as it is necessary, and the quest of\r\nwhich, supposing we had only it in view, would not be worth all the\r\ntrouble we take to find a perfect mistress. In this preparation and in\r\nthis termination you excel beyond all women. At least, it has been a\r\npleasure to me to think so, and perhaps you will grant me that after\r\nhaving produced the Aphrodite of the Temple my imagination has had no\r\ngreat difficulty in divining the manner of woman you are. Once again, I\r\nwill not tell you whether it is a question of a night dream or a waking\r\nerror. It is enough for you to know that, whether dreamed or conceived,\r\nyour image has appeared to me in an extraordinary frame. Illusion; but,\r\nin all things I shall prevent you, Chrysis, from disillusioning me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd me, what do you mean to do with me, who loves you still in spite\r\nof all the horrors that proceed from your mouth? Have I had the\r\nconsciousness of your odious dream? Have I had my share in this\r\nhappiness of which you speak, and which you have stolen, stolen from\r\nme! Has one ever heard of a lover so amazingly selfish as to take his\r\npleasure of the woman who loves him without allowing her to share it! .\r\n. . This confounds all thought. It will drive me mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point, Demetrios dropped his tone of mockery, and said, in a\r\nvoice that trembled slightly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you trouble yourself about me when you took advantage of my sudden\r\npassion to extort from me, in a moment of folly, three actions which\r\nmight have destroyed my existence, and which will always leave behind\r\nthem the remembrance of a triple shame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I asked this, it was to attach you to me. I should not have got you\r\nif I had given myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. You have been satisfied. You have held me, not for long, but you\r\nhave held me, nevertheless, in the serfdom you desired. Today, you must\r\nallow me to free myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the only slave, Demetrios.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-075\r\n\r\n\r\n_He freed himself from both her arms._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you or I, but one of us two if he loves the other. Slavery!\r\nSlavery! that is the real name of passion. You have all of you only one\r\ndream, one idea in your heads; to break men\xe2\x80\x99s strength with your\r\nfeebleness and govern his intelligence with your futility. As soon as\r\nyour breasts take form, you desire neither to love nor to be loved, but\r\nto bind a man to your ankles, to lower him, to bow his head and put\r\nyour sandals upon it. Then, in conformity with your ambition, you can\r\ndash the sword, the chisel, or the compass out of our hands, break\r\neverything which transcends you, emasculate everything which frightens\r\nyou, tweak Hercules by the nose and set him a-spinning wool. But when\r\nyou have been able neither to bow his head nor weaken his character,\r\nyou adore the fist that beats you, the knee that strikes you to the\r\nground, the very mouth that insults you. The man who has refused to\r\nkiss your naked feet satisfies your dearest wish if he violates you.\r\nThe man who has not wept when you left his house, can drag you there by\r\nthe hair: your love will spring up again from your tears, for there is\r\nbut one thing that consoles you when you are unable to impose slavery,\r\namorous women! and that is to submit to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, beat me, if you like! but love me afterwards!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she hugged him so brusquely that he had not time to turn away his\r\nlips. He freed himself from both her arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest you! Adieu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nBut Chrysis clung to his mantle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not lie. You adore me. Your soul is full of me: but you are ashamed\r\nat having yielded. Listen, listen, Well-beloved! If that is all that is\r\nneeded to console your pride, I am ready to give you, in order to have\r\nyou, still more than I asked of you. Whatever sacrifice I make you, I\r\nwill not complain of life after our union.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemetrios looked at her curiously, and, like her, the night before upon\r\nthe quay, he said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat oath do you swear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Aphrodite also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not believe in Aphrodite. Swear by Jehovah Sabaoth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Galil\xc3\xa6an woman paled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not swear by Jehovah.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a terrible oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then said in a low voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI swear by Jehovah. What do\r\nyou want of me, Demetrios?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man kept silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak quickly, I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! very little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not ask you to give me three presents, were they as simple as\r\nthe first three were rare. It would be contrary to the usages. But I\r\ncan ask you to accept some, can I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis joyously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis mirror, this necklace, this comb, which you made me steal for\r\nyou, you did not expect to use them, I suppose? A stolen mirror, the\r\ncomb of a victim, and the goddess\xe2\x80\x99s necklace are not jewels one can\r\nmake a display of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thought so. It is therefore out of pure cruelty that you incited\r\nme to ravish them at the price of the three crimes with which the whole\r\ntown resounds to-day. Well, you are going to wear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must go into the little enclosed garden where the statue of the\r\nStygian Hermes is. This place is always deserted, and you will run no\r\nrisk of being disturbed. You will take off the god\xe2\x80\x99s left heel. The\r\nstone is broken, you will see. Then, in the interior of the pedestal,\r\nyou will find Bacchis\xe2\x80\x99s mirror, and you will place it in your hand; you\r\nwill find the great comb of Nitaoucrit, and will place it in your hair;\r\nyou will find the seven pearl necklaces of the goddess Aphrodite, and\r\nyou will put them on your neck. Thus adorned, beautiful Chrysis, you\r\nwill go about the town. The crowd will deliver you to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoldiers, but you will have what you desired, and I will go and see you\r\nin your prison before sunrise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE GARDEN OF HERMANUBIS\r\n\r\nChrysis\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was to shrug her shoulders. She would not be so\r\ningenuous as to keep her word.\r\n\r\nThe second was to go and see.\r\n\r\nA rising curiosity impelled her toward the mysterious place where\r\nDemetrios had hidden the three criminal trophies. She wanted to take\r\nthem, to touch them with her hands, to make them gleam in the sunlight,\r\nto possess them for an instant. It seemed to her that her victory would\r\nnot be quite complete so long as she should not have seized the booty\r\nof her ambitions.\r\n\r\nill-076\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for Demetrios: she would find the means of recapturing him\r\nultimately. How was it possible to believe that he had emancipated\r\nhimself from her for ever? The passion she attributed to him was not\r\none of those that die out in a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart irrevocably. The women one\r\nhas once greatly loved form a family of election in a man\xe2\x80\x99s heart and\r\nthe meeting with a former mistress, even though hated or forgotten,\r\nexcites an unexpected disorder of the soul whence the new love may\r\nburst forth. Chrysis was not ignorant of this. However ardent she might\r\nbe herself, however anxious to conquer the first man she had ever\r\nloved, she was not mad enough to buy him at the cost of her life when\r\nshe saw so many other methods of seducing him more simply.\r\n\r\nAnd yet . . . what a blessed end he had proposed to her!\r\n\r\nUnder the eyes of an innumerable crowd, bear the antique mirror into\r\nwhich Sappho had gazed, the comb which had held in place the royal hair\r\nof Nitaoucrit, the necklace of marine pearls that had rolled in the\r\nshell of the goddess Anadyomene . . . Then, from the evening till the\r\nmorning drink madly of all the sensations with which the wildest love\r\ncan inspire a woman . . . and towards the middle of the day, die\r\nwithout effort . . . what an incomparable destiny!\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes . . .\r\n\r\nBut no: she would not allow herself to be tempted.\r\n\r\nShe crossed Rhacotis and mounted the street which led in a straight\r\nline to the Great Serapeion. This road, constructed by the Greeks,\r\nseemed incongruous in this quarter of angular alleys. The two\r\npopulations mingled oddly, in a promiscuity from which hatred was not\r\nabsent. Amongst the blue-shirted Egyptians, the unbleached tunics of\r\nthe Hellenes made splashes of white. Chrysis mounted rapidly, without\r\nlistening to the conversations in which the people discoursed of the\r\ncrimes committed for her sake.\r\n\r\nBefore the steps of the monument, she turned to the right, took an\r\nobscure street, then another, the houses of which almost touched,\r\ncrossed a little star-shaped square where two swarthy little girls were\r\nplaying in a sunny fountain, and finally she stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden of Hermes Anubis was a little necropolis long ago abandoned,\r\na sort of no man\xe2\x80\x99s land to which parents no longer brought the\r\nlibations to the dead, and that the passers-by avoided. In the midst of\r\nthe crumbling tombs, Chrysis advanced in the greatest silence, quaking\r\nwith fear at every stone that clattered under her feet. The wind,\r\nalways charged with fine sand, blew her hair over her temples and sent\r\nher veil of scarlet silk floating towards the white leaves of the\r\nsycamores.\r\n\r\nShe discovered the statue between three monuments that hid it on all\r\nsides and enclosed it in a triangle. The spot was well chosen for the\r\nconcealment of a mortal secret.\r\n\r\nChrysis forced her way as best she could through the narrow, stony\r\npassage; on seeing the statue she paled slightly.\r\n\r\nThe jackal-headed god was in a standing attitude, with his right leg\r\nadvanced, and with his hair falling on his shoulders. This hair was\r\npierced by two holes for the arms.\r\n\r\nThe head on the top of the rigid body was bent downwards and\r\ncontemplated the movement of the hands as they performed the\r\ncharacteristic gesture of the embalmer. The left foot was loose.\r\n\r\nLooking round slowly and fearfully, Chrysis made sure that she was\r\nquite alone. A little noise behind her made her start; but it was only\r\na green lizard slipping away into a marble fissure.\r\n\r\nThen she ventured at last to lay hold of the broken foot of the statue.\r\nShe lifted it obliquely, and not without difficulty, for it was\r\nattached to a loose fragment of the hollow pedestal. And under the\r\nstone she suddenly saw the gleam of the enormous pearls.\r\n\r\nShe withdrew the necklace altogether. How heavy it was! She would never\r\nhave imagined that unmounted pearls could weigh with such a weight upon\r\nthe hand. The pearl globes were all marvellously round and of an almost\r\nlunar water. The seven strings succeeded one another in ever-widening\r\ncircles, like circular clouds on a star-studded lake.\r\n\r\nShe put it round her neck.\r\n\r\nill-077\r\n\r\n\r\n_On seeing the statue she paled slightly._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe arranged it in tiers with one hand, closing her eyes in order the\r\nbetter to feel the coldness of the pearls on her skin. She disposed the\r\nseven tiers regularly along her naked breast, and thrust the last one\r\ninto the warm channel between her breasts.\r\n\r\nThen she took the ivory comb, considered it for a time, caressed the\r\nwhite figurine carved in the dainty coronal, and plunged the jewel into\r\nher hair several times before fixing it exactly as she wished.\r\n\r\nThen she drew the silver mirror from the pedestal, looked at herself in\r\nit, saw her triumph in it, her eyes gleaming with pride, her shoulders\r\nadorned with the spoils of the gods . . .\r\n\r\nAnd enveloping herself to the hair in her great purple cyclas, she left\r\nthe necropolis, taking with her the terrible jewels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTHE WALLS OF PURPLE\r\n\r\nThen, out of the mouth of the hierodules, the people had learnt the\r\ncertainty of the sacrilege for the second time, they gradually melted\r\naway through the gardens.\r\n\r\nThe courtesans of the temple crowded by hundreds along the paths of\r\nblack olive trees. Some scattered ashes on their heads. Others beat\r\ntheir foreheads on the ground, or pulled out their hair, or tore their\r\nbreasts, as a sign of calamity. Many sobbed, with their heads in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe crowd descended into the town in silence, along the Dromos and\r\nalong the quay. Universal mourning spread consternation throughout the\r\nstreets. The shopkeepers had hastily taken in their multicoloured\r\nstands, from fear, and wooden shutters kept in place by iron bars\r\nsucceeded one another like a monotonous palisade on the ground-floor of\r\nwindowless houses.\r\n\r\nThe life of the harbour had come to a stand-still. The sailors sat\r\nmotionless on the street-posts, with their cheeks in their hands. The\r\nships ready to leave had taken in their long oars and clewed up their\r\npointed sails along the masts rocking in the wind. Those who wished to\r\nenter the harbour waited for the signals out in the open, and some of\r\ntheir passengers, who had relatives at the queen\xe2\x80\x99s palace, believing a\r\nbloody revolution was in progress, sacrificed to the infernal gods.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the island of Pharos and the quay, Rhodis recognised\r\nChrysis standing near her in the crowd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Chrysis! take me under your care! I am afraid! Myrto is here! but\r\nthe crowd is so great . . . I am afraid that we shall be separated.\r\nTake us by the hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Myrtocleia, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know what is happening? Do they know\r\nthe culprit? Is he being tortured? Nothing like it has ever been seen\r\nsince Hierostratos. The Olympians are deserting us. What is going to\r\nbecome of us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis did not answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had given doves,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little flute-player; \xe2\x80\x9cwill the goddess\r\nremember? The goddess must be very angry. And you, my poor Chryse! you\r\nwho were to be very happy to-day or very powerful . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is accomplished,\xe2\x80\x9d said the courtesan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis took two steps backwards and lifted her right hand to her\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook well, Rhodis; look, Myrtocleia. Human eyes have never beheld what\r\nyou are to behold to-day, since the day, when the goddess descended\r\nupon Ida. And such a sight will never be seen again upon the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends, believing her to be mad, recoiled in stupefaction. But\r\nChrysis, lost in her dream, walked to the monstrous Pharos, a mountain\r\nof gleaming marble in eight hexagonal tiers. Taking advantage of the\r\npublic inattention, she pushed open the bronze door and closed it on\r\nthe inside by letting drop the sonorous bars.\r\n\r\nA few minutes elapsed.\r\n\r\nThe crowd surged perpetually. The living tide added its clamour to the\r\nregular upheavals of the waters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a cry arose upon the air, repeated by a hundred thousand\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAphrodite!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAphrodite!!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA thunder of cries burst forth. The joy, the enthusiasm of a whole\r\npeople sang in an indescribable tumult of ecstasy at the walls of\r\nPharos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rout that covered the quay surged violently forward into the\r\nisland, took possession of the rocks, mounted on the houses, on the\r\nsignal masts, on the fortified towers. The isle was full, more than\r\nfull, and the crowd arrived ever more compact, like the onrush of a\r\nswollen river hurling long rows of human beings into the sea from the\r\ntop of the precipitous cliff.\r\n\r\nThis flood of men was interminable. From the palace of the Ptolemies to\r\nthe wall of the Canal, the banks of the Royal Port, of the Great Port,\r\nand of Euroste were alive with a dense mass of human beings that\r\nreceived continual reinforcements from the side streets. Above this\r\nocean, agitated by immense eddies, a foaming mass of arms and faces,\r\nfloated like a barque in peril the yellow sails of Queen Berenice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlitter. The tumult gathered force every moment and became formidable.\r\n\r\nNeither Helen on the Scain Gates, nor Phryne in the waves of Eleusis,\r\nnor Tha\xc3\xafs setting fire to Persepolis have known what triumph means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysis had appeared by the western Gate, on the first terrace of the\r\nred monument.\r\n\r\nShe was naked like the goddess, she held in her two hands the ends of\r\nher scarlet veil which floated with the wind upon the evening sky, and\r\nin her right hand the mirror, in which was reflected the setting sun.\r\n\r\nill-078\r\n\r\n\r\n_She went on her way towards the sky._\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, with bended head, moving with infinite grace and majesty, she\r\nmounted the outer staircase which wound around the high vermilion tower\r\nlike a spiral. Her veil flickered like a flame. The rosy sunset\r\nreddened the pearl necklace like a river of rubies.\r\n\r\nShe mounted, and in this glory, her gleaming skin took on all the\r\nmagnificence of flesh, blood, fire, blue carmine, velvety red, bright\r\npink, and revolving upwards with the great purple walls, she went on\r\nher way towards the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nTHE SUPREME NIGHT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are loved of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gaoler. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I, a poor slave,\r\nhad committed the hundredth part of your crimes, I should have been\r\nbound upon the rack, hung up by the feet, lashed with thongs, burnt\r\nwith pincers. They would have poured vinegar into my nostrils,\r\noverwhelmed and crushed me with bricks, and if I had died under the\r\nagony, my body would already be food for the jackals of the burning\r\nplains. But you who have stolen, assassinated, profaned, you may expect\r\nnothing more than the gentle hemlock, and in the meanwhile you enjoy a\r\ngood room. May Zeus blast me with his thunderbolt if I can tell why!\r\nYou probably know somebody at the palace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me figs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chrysis; \xe2\x80\x9cmy mouth is dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old slave brought her a dozen ripe figs in a green basket.\r\n\r\nChrysis was left alone.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and got up again, she walked round the room, she struck\r\nthe walls with the palms of her hands without thinking of anything\r\nwhatever. She let down her hair to cool it, and then put it up again\r\nalmost immediately.\r\n\r\nThey had dressed her in a long garment of white wool. The stuff was\r\nhot. Chrysis was bathed in perspiration. She stretched her arms,\r\nyawned, and leaned herself against the lofty window.\r\n\r\nOutside, the silvery moon shone in a sky of liquid purity, a sky so\r\npale and clear that not a star was visible.\r\n\r\nIt was on just such a night that, seven years before, Chrysis had left\r\nthe land of Gennesaret.\r\n\r\nShe remembered . . . They were five. They were sellers of ivory. Their\r\nlong-tailed horses were adorned with parti-coloured tufts. They had met\r\nthe child at the edge of a round cistern . . .\r\n\r\nAnd before that, the blue lake, the transparent sky, the light air of\r\nthe land of Galilee. . . . .\r\n\r\nThe house was environed with pink flax-plants and tamarisks. Thorny\r\ncaper-bushes pricked one\xe2\x80\x99s fingers when one went a-catching butterflies\r\n. . . One could almost see the wind in the undulations of the pine\r\ngrasses . . .\r\n\r\nill-079\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little girls bathed in a limpid brook where one found red shells\r\nunder the flowering laurels: and there were flowers upon the water, and\r\nflowers all over the mead, and great lilacs upon the mountains, and the\r\nline of the mountain was that of a young breast . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysis closed her eyes with a faint smile which suddenly died away.\r\nThe idea of death had just occurred to her. And she felt that, until\r\nthe last, she would be incapable of ceasing to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have I done? Why did I meet that man?\r\nWhy did he listen to me? Why did I let myself be caught in the trap?\r\nHow is it that, even now, I regret nothing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to love or to die: that is the choice God has given me. What have\r\nI done to deserve punishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd fragments of sacred verses occurred to her that she had heard\r\nquoted in her childhood. She had not thought of them for seven years.\r\nBut they returned, one after the other, with an implacable precision,\r\nto apply to her life and predict her penalty.\r\n\r\nShe murmured:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written:\r\n\r\nI remember thy love when thou wast young.\r\nFor of old thou hast broken thy yoke.\r\nAnd burst thy bonds;\r\nAnd thou hast said: I will no longer serve.\r\nBut upon every high hill,\r\nAnd under every green tree,\r\nThou hast wandered, playing the harlot. [1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written:\r\n\r\nI will follow after my lovers,\r\nWho give me my bread and my wine,\r\nAnd my wool and my flax,\r\nAnd my oil and my wine. [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written:\r\n\r\nHow canst thou say: I am not polluted?\r\nSee thy way in the valley,\r\nKnow what thou hast done,\r\nO thou dromedary traversing her ways,\r\nO thou wild ass,\r\nPanting and ever lustful,\r\nWho could prevent thee from satisfying thy desire? [3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is written:\r\n\r\n_She has played the harlot in the land of Egypt._\r\nShe has doted upon paramours\r\nWhose flesh is as the flesh of asses,\r\nAnd whose issue is like the issue of horses.\r\nThus thou callest to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth,\r\nIn bruising thy teats by the Egyptians\r\nFor the paps of thy youth.\xe2\x80\x9d [4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is I! It is I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is written again:\r\n\r\nThou hast played the harlot with many lovers,\r\nAnd thou wouldst return again to me! saith the Lord. [5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my chastisement also is written:\r\n\r\nBehold: I raise up thy lovers against thee:\r\nThey shall judge thee according to their judgments.\r\nThey shall take away thy nose and thine ears,\r\nAnd thy remnant shall fall by the sword. [6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd again:\r\n\r\nShe is undone: she is stripped naked, she is led away captive\r\nHer servants wail like doves\r\nAnd taber upon their breasts. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does one know what the Scripture says?\xe2\x80\x9d she added to console\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not written elsewhere:\r\n\r\nI will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom. [8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd elsewhere does not Scripture give this advice:\r\n\r\nGo thy way, eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry\r\nheart: for God now accepteth thy works. Let thy garments be always\r\nwhite, and let thy head lack no ointment. Live joyfully with the wife\r\nwhom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath\r\ngiven thee under the sun; for there is no work, nor device, nor\r\nknowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest. [9]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe shivered, and repeated in a low voice:\r\n\r\nFor there is no work, nor device nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the\r\ngrave, _whither thou goest!_ Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant\r\nthing it is to see the sun. [10]\r\n\r\n\r\nRejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the\r\ndays of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the sight\r\nof thine eyes, or ever thou goest to thy long home and the mourners go\r\nabout the streets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden\r\nbowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel\r\nbroken at the cistern, or the dust return to the earth as it was. [11]\r\n\r\n\r\nShivering once more, she repeated slowly:\r\n\r\nOr the dust return to the earth as it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as she took her head in her hands in order to stifle her thoughts,\r\nshe suddenly felt, without having foreseen it, the mortuary form of her\r\ncranium through the living skin: the empty temples, the enormous\r\norbits, the flat nose under the cartilage, and the protruding jaws.\r\n\r\nHorror! this it was, then, that she was about to become! With frightful\r\nlucidity, she had the vision of her corpse, and she passed her hands\r\nover her whole body in order to probe to the bottom an idea which,\r\nthough simple, had never yet occurred to her\xe2\x80\x94that she bore _her\r\nskeleton within her_, that it was not a result of death, a\r\nmetamorphosis, a culmination, but a thing one carries about, a spectre\r\ninseparable from the human form, and that the framework of life is\r\nalready the symbol of the tomb.\r\n\r\nA furious desire to live, to see everything again, to begin everything\r\nagain, to do everything again, suddenly came over her. It was a revolt\r\nin the presence of death: the impossibility of admitting that she would\r\nnever see the evening of the dawning day: the impossibility of\r\nunderstanding how this beauty, this body, this active thought, this\r\nopulent life of the flesh could cease to be, in its zenith, and go to\r\nrottenness.\r\n\r\nThe door opened quietly.\r\n\r\nDemetrios entered.\r\n\r\n  [1] _Jeremiah_ II, 2, 20.\r\n\r\n [2] _Hosea_ II, 5.\r\n\r\n [3] _Jeremiah_ II, 23, 24.\r\n\r\n [4] _Ezekiel_ XXIII, 20, 21.\r\n\r\n [5] _Jeremiah_ III, 1.\r\n\r\n [6] _Ezekiel_ XXIII, 22, 25.\r\n\r\n [7] _Nahum_ II, 7.\r\n\r\n [8] _Hosea_ IV, 14.\r\n\r\n [9] _Ecclesiastes_ IX, 7, 10.\r\n\r\n [10] _Ecclesiastes_ XI, 7.\r\n\r\n [11] _Ecclesiastes_ XII, 1, 5-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nDUST RETURNS TO EARTH\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemetrios!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nAnd she rushed forward.\r\n\r\nBut after carefully dropping the wooden bolt, the young man remained\r\nmotionless, and his glance betrayed such profound tranquility that\r\nChrysis was suddenly stricken with a cold chill.\r\n\r\nShe had hoped for an impulse of generosity, a movement of the arms, the\r\nlips, anything, an outstretched hand . . .\r\n\r\nDemetrios did not move.\r\n\r\nHe waited in silence for an instant, in an extremely correct attitude,\r\nas if he wished clearly to disavow all responsibility in the case.\r\n\r\nThen, seeing that nothing was asked of him, he strode towards the\r\nwindow and planted himself in the embrasure to contemplate the dawn of\r\nday.\r\n\r\nChrysis sat upon the low bed, with a fixed look in her dulled eyes.\r\n\r\nThen Demetrios began to commune with himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is better thus,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch trivial amusements on\r\nthe very eve of death would, as a matter of fact, be most lugubrious. I\r\nwonder, however, that she should not have had a presentiment of it from\r\nthe very beginning, and I marvel that she should have received me so\r\nenthusiastically. As for me, it is an adventure terminated. I regret\r\nsomewhat this denouement, for all things considered, the only crime of\r\nwhich Chrysis is guilty is to have expressed very frankly an ambition\r\nwhich might have been shared by most women, without doubt, and if it\r\nwere not necessary to cast a victim to the public indignation, I should\r\nbe satisfied with the banishment of this too-ardent young woman, in\r\norder to get rid of her and at the same time leave her the joys of\r\nlife. But there has been a scandal, and none can stop the course of\r\nevents. Such are the effects of passion. Thoughtless sensuality, or its\r\ncontrary, the idea without the reality, do not involve these fatal\r\nconsequences. We ought to have many mistresses, but to beware, with the\r\nhelp of the gods, of forgetting that all mouths resemble one another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-080\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chrysis sat upon the low bed._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus, in an audacious aphorism, summed up one of his moral\r\ntheories, he lightly resumed the normal course of his ideas.\r\n\r\nHe remembered vaguely an invitation to dine that he had accepted for\r\nthe night before and then forgotten in the whirl of events, and he\r\nresolved to send an apology.\r\n\r\nHe considered whether he should put his slave-tailor up for sale, an\r\nold man who had remained attached to the fashionable cut of the former\r\nregime, and who succeeded very imperfectly with the new puckered\r\ntunics.\r\n\r\nHis mind was even so free from all preoccupation that he stumped out\r\nupon the wall a rough study of his group of _Zagreus and the Titans_, a\r\nvariant which modified the position of the principal character\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\narm.\r\n\r\nHardly had he finished, when a gentle knock was heard at the door.\r\n\r\nDemetrios opened without haste. The old executioner entered, followed\r\nby two helmeted hoplites.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bring the little cup,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling obsequiously at the royal\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nDemetrios kept silence.\r\n\r\nChrysis, half beside herself, raised her head. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, my girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued the gaoler, \xe2\x80\x9cthe hour has come. The hemlock is crushed. There\r\nis really nothing left but to take it. Do not be afraid. There is no\r\npain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis looked at Demetrios, who did not turn away his eyes.\r\n\r\nStill continuing to regard him with her great black eyes that were\r\nrimmed with green light, Chrysis stretched out her hand, took the cup,\r\nand slowly raised it to her mouth.\r\n\r\nShe dipped her lips in it. The bitterness of the poison and also the\r\npangs of the poisoning had been tempered with honey and narcotics.\r\n\r\nShe drank half the contents of the cup, then, whether it was that she\r\nhad seen this gesture at the Theatre, in the _Thyestes_ of Agathon, or\r\nwhether it was really the outcome of a spontaneous sentiment, she\r\nhanded the poison to Demetrios. But the young man waved away this\r\nindiscreet suggestion.\r\n\r\nThen the Galil\xc3\xa6an drank the rest of the beverage even to the green\r\nslime at the bottom. An agonising smile overspread her cheeks, a smile\r\nin which there was certainly a little contempt.\r\n\r\nill-081\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat must I do?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the gaoler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk about the room, my girl, until you feel a heaviness in the legs.\r\nThen lie down on your back, and the poison will do the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChrysis walked to the window, leaned her head against the wall, with\r\nher temples in her hand, and cast a last look of vanished youth upon\r\nthe violet dawn.\r\n\r\nThe orient was bathed in a sea of colour. A long band, livid as a water\r\nleaf, enveloped the horizon with an olive-coloured girdle. Higher up,\r\nseveral tints sprang out of one another, liquid sheets of blue-green\r\nsky, irisated, or lilac-coloured, melting insensibly into the leaden\r\nazure of the upper heavens. Then, these tiers of colour rose slowly, a\r\nline of gold appeared, mounted, expanded: a thin thread of purple\r\nillumined this melancholic dawn, and, in a flood of blood, the sun was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nIt is written:\r\n\r\n"The light is sweet . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nShe remained thus, standing, so long as her legs could sustain her.\r\nWhen she showed signs of reeling, the hoplites carried her to the bed.\r\n\r\nThere, the old man disposed the white folds of the robe along the rigid\r\nlimbs. Then he touched her feet and asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-082\r\n\r\n\r\n_The hoplites carried her to the bed._\r\n\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe touched her knees and asked her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made a sign to him that she felt nothing, and suddenly, with a\r\nmovement of her mouth and shoulders (for her very hands were dead),\r\nseized with a supreme frenzy of passion, and perhaps with regret, at\r\nthis sterile hour, she raised herself towards Demetrios, but before he\r\ncould answer she fell back lifeless, with the light for ever gone from\r\nout of her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen the executioner covered her face with the upper folds of her\r\ngarment: and one of the assistant soldiers, supposing that a more\r\ntender past had once united this young man and woman, severed with his\r\nsword the uttermost lock of her hair, and it fell down upon the\r\npaving-stones.\r\n\r\nDemetrios took it in his hand, and in truth it was Chrysis in her\r\nentirety, the gold that survived her beauty, the very pretext of her\r\nname . . .\r\n\r\nHe took the warm lock between his thumb and his fingers, severed the\r\nstrands slowly, dropped them to the earth, and ground them into the\r\ndust under the sole of his shoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nCHRYSIS IMMORTAL\r\n\r\nWhen Demetrios found himself alone in his red studio, littered with\r\nmarble statuary, rough models, trestles, and scaffoldings, he\r\nendeavoured to apply himself once more to his work.\r\n\r\nWith his chisel in his left hand and his mallet in his right, he\r\nresumed, but without ardour, an interrupted rough study. It was the\r\nbreast and shoulders of a gigantic horse intended for the temple of\r\nPoseidon. Under the close-cropped mane, the skin of the neck, puckered\r\nby a movement of the head, curved in geometrically like an undulating\r\nmarine basin.\r\n\r\nThree days before, the details of this regular muscular arrangement had\r\nentirely absorbed all Demetrios\xe2\x80\x99s interest; but on the morning of the\r\ndeath of Chrysis, the aspect of things seemed changed. Less calm than\r\nhe could have wished, Demetrios could not succeed in fixing his\r\npreoccupied thoughts. A sort of veil which he could not lift interposed\r\nitself between him and the marble. He throw down his mallet and began\r\nto pace about amongst the dusty pedestals.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he crossed the court, called a slave, and said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepare the piscina and the aromatics. Bathe me and perfume me, give\r\nme my white garments, and light the round perfume-pans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his toilette, he summoned two other slaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s prison; hand the gaoler this lump of\r\npotter\xe2\x80\x99s earth, and tell him to place it in the death-chamber of\r\nChrysis the courtesan. If the body has not already been thrown into the\r\ndungeon, charge him to take no action until he receives my orders. Go\r\nquickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put a roughing-chisel into the fold of his girdle and opened the\r\nprincipal door which gave upon the deserted avenue of the Dromos.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he halted on the threshold, stupefied by the immense midday\r\nlight of Africa.\r\n\r\nill-083\r\n\r\n\r\nThe street was certainly white and the houses white too, but the flame\r\nof the perpendicular sunbeams bathed the gleaming surfaces with such a\r\nfury of reflections that the limestone walls and the pavements danced\r\nwith prodigious incandescence in dark blue, red, green, raw ochre, and\r\nhyacinth. Great palpitating pillars of colour seemed to hang in the air\r\nand to be superimposed in transparent masses over the shimmering,\r\nflaming facades. The very lines of the houses lost their shape behind\r\nthis dazzling magnificence; the right wall of the street rounded off\r\ndimly into space, floated like a piece of drapery, and in certain\r\nplaces became invisible. A dog lying near a street-post was literally\r\nbathed in crimson.\r\n\r\nLost in admiration, Demetrios saw a symbol of his new existence in this\r\nspectacle. He had lived long enough in solitary night, in silence, and\r\nin peace. Long enough had he taken moon-beams for light, and, for his\r\nideal, the languid line of a too delicate pose, His work was not\r\nvirile. There was an icy shiver on the skin of his statues.\r\n\r\nDuring the tragic adventure which had just convulsed his intelligence,\r\nhe had, for the first time, felt the great living breath of life\r\ninflate his breast. If he feared a second ordeal; if, victorious in the\r\nstruggle, he swore above all things not to run the risk of flinching\r\nfrom the beautiful attitude he had adopted in the face of the world, at\r\nany rate he had just realised that that only is worthy of being\r\nimagined which penetrates by means of marble, colour or speech to one\r\nof the profundities of human emotion\xe2\x80\x94and that formal beauty is merely\r\nso much uncertain matter, ever capable of being transfigured by the\r\nexpression of sorrow or joy.\r\n\r\nJust as he was finishing this line of thought, he arrived before the\r\ndoor of the criminal prison.\r\n\r\nHis two slaves were waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have brought the lump of red clay,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe body is on the\r\nbed. It has not been touched. The gaoler salutes you and hopes you will\r\nnot forget him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man entered in silence, followed the long corridor, mounted\r\nsome steps, and penetrated into the death-chamber. He carefully closed\r\nthe door after him.\r\n\r\nThe body lay upon the bed, with the head covered with a veil, the\r\nfingers extended, and the feet close together. The fingers were laden\r\nwith rings: two silver bangles encircled the pale ankles, and the nails\r\nof each toe were still red with powder.\r\n\r\nDemetrios laid his hand on the veil in order to raise it; but he had no\r\nsooner touched it than a dozen flies rapidly escaped from the opening.\r\n\r\nHe shivered from head to foot. Nevertheless he removed the tissue of\r\nwhite wool and wound it round the hair.\r\n\r\nChrysis\xe2\x80\x99 face had little by little become illumined with the expression\r\nof eternity that death dispenses to the eyelids and hair of corpses. In\r\nthe bluish whiteness of the cheeks, the azure veinlets gave the\r\nimmobile head the appearance of cold marble. The diaphanous nostrils\r\nwere distended above the fine lips. The fragile ears had something\r\nimmaterial about them. Never, in any light, even in his dreams, had\r\nDemetrios seen such superhuman beauty and such a brilliancy of fading\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then he remembered the words uttered by Chrysis during their first\r\ninterview: \xe2\x80\x9cYou only know my face. You do not know how beautiful I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAn intense emotion suddenly stifles him. He wishes to know. He has the\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOf his three days of passion he wishes to keep a souvenir which shall\r\nlast longer than himself.\xe2\x80\x94to lay bare the admirable body, to pose it as\r\na model in the violent attitude in which he saw it in his dreams, and\r\nto create, from the corpse, the statue of Immortal Life.\r\n\r\nHe unclasps the buckle and unties the knot. He throws back the\r\ndraperies. The body is heavy. He raises it. The head falls backwards.\r\nThe breasts tremble. The arms drop pendent. He withdraws the robe\r\nentirely and casts it into the middle of the chamber. Heavily, the body\r\nfalls back again.\r\n\r\nPlacing his two hands under the icy armpits, Demetrios pulls the dead\r\nwoman to the upper end of the bed. He turns the head over on to the\r\nleft cheek, collects and arranges the hair splendidly under the back.\r\nThen he raises the right arm, bends the forearm over the forehead,\r\ncloses the still soft fingers over the stuff of a cushion: two\r\nadmirable muscular lines, descending from the ear and elbow, meet under\r\nthe right breast and bear it like a fruit.\r\n\r\nill-084\r\n\r\n\r\n_The rough figure takes life and precision._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfterwards, he arranges the legs, one stretched out stiffly on one\r\nside, the other with the knee raised and the heel almost touching the\r\ncroup. He rectifies a few details, turns over the waist a little to the\r\nleft, straightens out the right foot and takes off the bracelets, the\r\nnecklaces and the rings, in order not to mar by a single dissonance the\r\npure and complete harmony of feminine nudity.\r\n\r\nThe Model has taken the pose.\r\n\r\nDemetrios casts the dark lump of clay upon the table. He presses it,\r\nkneads it, lengthens it out into human form: a sort of barbarous\r\nmonster takes shape under his burning fingers: he looks.\r\n\r\nThe motionless corpse preserves its attitude of passion. But a thin\r\nthread of blood trickles from the right nostril, flows upon the lip,\r\nand falls, drop by drop, under the half-opened mouth.\r\n\r\nDemetrios continues. The rough figure takes life and precision. A\r\nprodigious left arm circles over the body as if it were clasping\r\nsomeone in a tight embrace. The muscles of the thigh stand out\r\nviolently. The heels are bent upwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen night mounted from the earth and darkened the low chamber,\r\nDemetrios had finished the statue.\r\n\r\nHe had it carried to his studio by four slaves. That very evening, by\r\nlamplight, he had a block of Parian marble rough-hewed, and a year\r\nafter that day he was still working at the marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nPITY\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGaoler, open! Gaoler, open!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhodis and Myrtocleia knocked at the closed door.\r\n\r\nThe door opened half way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see our friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Myrto. \xe2\x80\x9cTo see Chrysis, poor Chrysis, who\r\ndied this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not allowed; go away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, let us enter. No one will know. We will tell no one. She was our\r\nfriend, let us see her once more. We will go out again. We will go out\r\nagain quickly. We will make no noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd supposing I am caught, my little girls? Supposing I am punished on\r\nyour account? You will not pay the fine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not be caught. You are alone here. There are no other inmates\r\nof the prison. You have sent away the soldiers. We know this. Let us\r\nenter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! Do not stay too long. Here is the key. It is the third\r\ndoor. Tell me when you go away. It is late and I want to go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe kindly old man handed them a key of beaten iron which hung from his\r\ngirdle, and the two little virgins ran immediately, on their noiseless\r\nsandals, along the obscure corridors.\r\n\r\nThen the gaoler re-entered his lodge, and did not insist any further\r\nupon a useless surveillance. The penalty of imprisonment was not\r\napplied in Greek Egypt, and the little white house that was placed\r\nunder the care of the gentle old man served merely for the reception of\r\nculprits condemned to death. In the interval between executions it\r\nremained almost deserted.\r\n\r\nThe moment the great key entered the lock, Rhodis arrested her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know whether I dare see her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI loved her well,\r\nMyrto . . . I am afraid . . . Go in first, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia pushed open the door; but as soon as she had cast a glance\r\ninto the chamber she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not enter, Rhodis! Wait for me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! What is there? You are afraid too . . . What is there on the bed?\r\nIs she not dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, wait for me . . . I will tell you . . . Stay in the corridor and\r\ndo not look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe body was still in the ecstatic attitude in which Demetrius had\r\narranged it for his Statue of Immortal Life. But the transports of\r\nextreme joy confine upon the convulsions of extreme pain, and\r\nMyrtocleia asked herself what atrocious sufferings, what agonies had\r\nproduced such an upheaval in the corpse.\r\n\r\nill-085\r\n\r\n\r\nShe approached the bed on tiptoe.\r\n\r\nThe thread of blood continued to flow from the diaphanous nostril. The\r\nskin of the body was perfectly white; the pale tips of the breasts\r\nreceded like delicate navels; not a single rose-coloured reflection\r\ngave life to the ephemeral recumbent statue; but some emerald-coloured\r\nspots that tinted the smooth belly signified that millions of new lives\r\nwere germinating in the scarcely-cold flesh, and were demanding \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nright of succession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia took the dead arm and laid it flat along the hip. She tried\r\nalso to pull out the left leg; but the knee was almost rigid, and she\r\ndid not succeed in pulling it out completely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRhodis,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a troubled voice, \xe2\x80\x9ccome; you can enter now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trembling child penetrated into the chamber. Her features\r\ncontracted, her eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they felt that there were two of them, they fell into one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s arms and burst into long-drawn sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Chrysis! Poor Chrysis!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the child.\r\n\r\nThey kissed one another on the cheek with a desperate affection from\r\nwhich all sensuality had disappeared and the taste of the tears upon\r\ntheir lips filled their forlorn little souls with bitterness.\r\n\r\nThey wept, and wailed, they looked at one another other with anguish,\r\nand sometimes they spoke both together in a hoarse voice of agony, and\r\ntheir words ended in sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow we loved her! She was not a friend for us. She was a little mother\r\nfor both of us . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhodis repeated:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a little mother . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Myrto, dragging her to the side of the dead woman, said in a low\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both bent down, and placed their hands upon the bed, as, with\r\nfresh sobs, they touched the icy forehead with their lips.\r\n\r\nAnd Myrto took the head between her two hands, buried them in the hair,\r\nand spoke to her thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis, my Chrysis, you who were the most beautiful and the most\r\nadored of women, who were so like the goddess that the people took you\r\nfor her, where are you now, what have they done with you? You lived to\r\nimpart beneficent joy. No fruit was ever sweeter than your mouth, no\r\nlight brighter than your eyes; your skin was a glorious robe that you\r\nwould not veil; voluptuousness floated upon it like a perpetual odour;\r\nand when you unclasped your hair, all desires flowed from it; and when\r\nyou clasped your naked arms, one implored the gods for permission to\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRhodis sat huddled up on the ground, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis, my Chrysis.\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Myrtocleia, \xe2\x80\x9cbut yesterday you were\r\nliving, and young, and hoping for length of days, and now you are dead,\r\nand no power on earth can induce you to speak a word to us. You have\r\nclosed your eyes, and we were not there. You have suffered and you did\r\nnot know that we wept for you behind the walls. Your dying eyes looked\r\nfor someone and did not meet our eyes stricken with sorrow and pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flute-girl wept continually. The singing girl took her by the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChrysis, my Chrysis, you once told us that one day, thanks to you, we\r\nshould marry. Our union is one of tears, and sad is the betrothal of\r\nRhodis and Myrtocleia. But sorrow, rather than love, welds together two\r\nenclasped hands. Those who have once wept together will never desert\r\none another. We are going to lay your dear body under the ground,\r\nChrysidion, and we will both of us cut off our hair upon your tomb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe enveloped the beautiful body and then she said to Rhodis:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nill-086\r\n\r\n\r\nThey lifted her up gently; but the burden was a heavy one for the\r\nlittle musicians, and they laid it down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us take off our sandals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Myrto. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us walk bare-footed in\r\nthe corridors. The gaoler is surely asleep. If we do not wake him we\r\nshall pass, but if he sees us he will prevent us . . . To-morrow\r\nmatters not: when he sees the empty bed, he will say to the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoldiers that he has thrown the body into a ditch, according to the\r\nlaw. Let us fear nothing, Rhodis! . . . Put your sandals in your\r\ngirdle, like me. And come! Take the body under the knees. Let the feet\r\nhang behind. Walk without noise, slowly, slowly . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nPIETY\r\n\r\nAfter the turning of the second street, they laid the body down a\r\nsecond time in order in put on their sandals. Rhodis\xe2\x80\x99s feet, too\r\ndelicate to walk naked, were torn and bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe night was full of brilliancy. The town was full of silence. The\r\niron-coloured shadows lay in square blocks in the middle of the\r\nstreets, according to the profile of the houses.\r\n\r\nThe little virgins resumed their load.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the child. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to bury\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the cemetery of Hermanubis. It is always deserted, it will be in\r\npeace there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Chrysis! Could I ever have thought that on her last day, I should\r\nbear her body without torches and without funeral car, secretly, like a\r\nthing stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen both began to talk volubly as if they were afraid of the silence,\r\ncheek by jowl with the corpse. The last day of Chrysis\xe2\x80\x99s life filled\r\nthem with astonishment. Where had she got the mirror, the necklace and\r\nthe comb? She could not have taken the pearls of the goddess herself.\r\nThe temple was too well guarded for a courtesan to be able to enter it.\r\nThen somebody must have acted for her? But who? She was not known to\r\npossess any lover amongst the Stolists to whom the guard of the divine\r\nstatue was entrusted. And then, if someone had acted for her, why had\r\nshe not denounced him? And, in any case, why these three crimes? Of\r\nwhat had they availed her, except to deliver her over to punishment? A\r\nwoman does not commit such follies without an object, unless she be in\r\nlove? Was Chrysis in love? and who could it be?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall never know\xe2\x80\x9d, concluded the flute-player. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has taken her\r\nsecret with her, and even if she had an accomplice he would be the last\r\nto enlighten us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point, Rhodis, who had been resting for several instants,\r\nsighed:\r\n\r\nill-087\r\n\r\n\r\n_The little virgins resumed their load_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot carry her any longer, Myrto. I shall fall down on my knees, I\r\nam broken with fatigue and grief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia took her by the neck:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry again, my darling. We _must_ carry her. Her nether life is at\r\nstake. If she has no sepulture and no obol in her hand, she will roam\r\neternally on the banks of the river of hell, and when we in our turn,\r\nRhodis, go down to the dead, she will reproach us with our impiety, and\r\nwe shall not know what to answer her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the child, overcome with weakness, burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuickly, quickly!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Myrtocleia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody is coming along the end of the street. Place yourself in\r\nfront of the body with me. Let us hide it behind our tunics . . . If it\r\nis seen, all is lost . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stooped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Timon. I recognise him. Timon with four women. Ah, gods! what is\r\ngoing to happen? He laughs at everything and will mock us . . . But no,\r\nstay here, Rhodis; I will speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, inspired by a sudden thought, she ran down the street to meet the\r\nlittle group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTimon,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and her voice was full of supplication; \xe2\x80\x9cTimon,\r\nstop. I have grave words to utter to you alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man, \xe2\x80\x9chow excited you are! Have\r\nyou lost your shoulder-knot or have you dropped your doll and broken\r\nits nose? This would be an irreparable disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl threw him a look of anguish; but the four women, Philotis,\r\nSeso of Cnidos, Callistion, and Tryphera, were already clamouring round\r\nher with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet away, little idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d said Tryphera, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have dried up your\r\nnurse\xe2\x80\x99s teats, we cannot help it, we have no milk. It is almost\r\ndaylight, you ought to be in bed; what business have children to roam\r\nabout in the moonlight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer nurse?\xe2\x80\x9d said Philotis. \xe2\x80\x9cShe wants to steal away Timon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whip! She deserves the whip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Callistion, who put one arm\r\nround Myrto\xe2\x80\x99s waist, lifting her off the ground and raising her little\r\nblue tunic, But Seso interposed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are mad,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMyrto has never known a man. If she calls\r\nTimon, it is not to sleep with him. Let her alone, and let us have done\r\nwith it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Timon, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want with me? Come here. Whisper in my\r\near. Is it really serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe body of Chrysis is there, in the street,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young girl\r\ntremblingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are carrying into the cemetary, my little friend and\r\nI, but it is heavy, and we ask you if you will help us. It will not\r\ntake long. Immediately afterwards you can rejoin your women . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTimon\xe2\x80\x99s look reassured her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor girls! To think that I laughed! You are better than we are . . .\r\nCertainly I will help you. Go and join your friend and wait for me, I\r\nam coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTurning to the four women . . .\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to my house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cby the street of the Potters. I shall be\r\nthere in a short time. Do not follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRhodis was still sitting in front of the corpse. When she saw Timon\r\ncoming, she implored him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not tell! We have stolen it to save her shade. Keep our secret, we\r\nwill love you, Timon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave no fears,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nHe took the body under the shoulders and Myrto took it under the knees,\r\nand they walked on in silence, with Rhodis tottering along behind.\r\n\r\nTimon said not a word. For the second time in two days, human passion\r\nhad carried off one of the transitory guests of his bed, and he\r\nmarvelled at the unreason that drove people out of the enchanted road\r\nthat leads to perfect happiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpassivity,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cindifference, quietude, voluptuous\r\nserenity! who amongst men will appreciate you? We fight, we struggle,\r\nwe hope, when one thing only is worth having: namely, to extract from\r\nthe fleeting moment all the joys it is capable of affording, and to\r\nleave one\xe2\x80\x99s bed as little as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey reached the gate of the ruined necropolis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall we put it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Myrto.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the god.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the statue? I have never been in here before. I was afraid of\r\nthe tombs and the inscriptions. I do not know the Hermanubis. It is\r\nprobably in the centre of the little garden. Let us look for it. I once\r\ncame here before when I was a child, in quest of a lost gazelle. Let us\r\nfollow the alley of white sycamores. We cannot fail to discern it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNor did they fail to find it.\r\n\r\nDawn mingled its delicate violets with the moonbeams on the monuments.\r\nA vague and distant harmony floated in the cypress branches. The\r\nregular rustling of the palms, so similar to tiny drops of falling\r\nrain, cast an illusion of freshness.\r\n\r\nTimon opened with difficulty a pink stone imbedded in the earth. The\r\nsepulture was excavated beneath the hands of the funerary god, whose\r\nattitude was that of the embalmer. It must have contained a body,\r\nformerly; but at present nothing was to be found but a handful of\r\nbrownish dust.\r\n\r\nill-881\r\n\r\n\r\n_They passed the limp body to Timon._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young man jumped into the grave, as far as his waist, and held out\r\nhis arms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Myrto. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to lay it at the far\r\nend, and we will close up the tomb again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Rhodis threw herself on the body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, do not bury her so quickly! I want to see her again! One last\r\ntime! One last time! Chrysis! My poor Chrysis! Ah! the horror of it . .\r\n. How she has changed! . . .\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMyrtocleia had just disarranged the blanket which covered the dead\r\nwoman, and the sight of the sudden change the face had undergone made\r\nthe two girls recoil. The cheeks had become square, the eyelids and\r\nlips were puffed out like half-a-dozen white pads. Nothing was left of\r\nall that superhuman beauty. They drew the thick winding-sheet over her\r\nagain: but Myrto slipped her hand under the stuff and placed an obol\r\nfor Charon in her fingers.\r\n\r\nThen, shaken by interminable sobs, they passed the limp inert body to\r\nTimon.\r\n\r\nAnd when Chrysis was laid in the bottom of the sandy tomb, Timon opened\r\nthe winding-sheet again. He fixed the silver obol tightly in the\r\nnerveless hand; he propped up the head with a flat stone; he spread the\r\nlong deep-gold hair over her body from the forehead to the knees.\r\n\r\nThen he left the tomb, and the musicians, kneeling before the yawning\r\nopening, cut off their young hair, bound it together in one sheaf, and\r\nburied it with the dead.\r\n\r\n\xce\xa4\xce\x9f\xce\x99\xce\x9d\xce\x94\xce\x95 \xce\xa0\xce\x95\xce\xa1\xce\x91\xce\xa3 \xce\x95\xce\xa3\xce\xa7\xce\x95 \xce\xa4\xce\x9f \xce\xa3\xce\xa5\xce\x9d\xce\xa4\xce\x91\xce\x93\xce\x9c\xce\x91\r\n\xce\xa4\xce\xa9\xce\x9d \xce\xa0\xce\x95\xce\xa1\xce\x99 \xce\xa7\xce\xa1\xce\xa5\xce\xa3\xce\x99\xce\x94\xce\x91 \xce\x9a\xce\x91\xce\x99 \xce\x94\xce\x97\xce\x9c\xce\x97\xce\xa4\xce\xa1\xce\x99\xce\x9f\xce\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nill-089\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ancient Manners, by Pierre Louys\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ANCIENT MANNERS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 36378-0.txt or 36378-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/6/3/7/36378/\r\n\r\nProduced by James D.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Newby\r\n    Chief Executive and Director\r\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
