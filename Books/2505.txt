Both looked\r\nup with a smile of welcome at the entrance of a tall, fine-looking young\r\nman, whom each greeted with \xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Laura. Good morning, Charles; I am glad you are\r\ndownstairs again! How are you to-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No way remarkable, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer, somewhat wearily given\r\nby Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You walked?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my uncle? I called at the post-office, and brought a\r\nletter for him. It has the Moorworth post-mark,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, producing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The post-town to Redclyffe; Sir Guy Morville\xe2\x80\x99s place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That old Sir Guy! What can he have to do with my father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you not know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98that my uncle is to be guardian to the\r\nboy--his grandson?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? No, I did not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98when old Sir Guy made it an especial point that my\r\nfather should take the guardianship, he only consented on condition\r\nthat my uncle should be joined with him; so now my uncle is alone in\r\nthe trust, and I cannot help thinking something must have happened at\r\nRedclyffe. It is certainly not Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must wait, unless your curiosity will carry you out in search of\r\npapa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98he is somewhere about, zealously supplying the\r\nplace of Jenkins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98there is no telling how much good you\r\nhave done him by convincing him of Jenkins\xe2\x80\x99 dishonesty. To say nothing\r\nof the benefit of being no longer cheated, the pleasure of having to\r\noverlook the farming is untold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled, and came to the table where she was drawing. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know\r\nthis place?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, looking up in his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stylehurst itself! What is it taken from?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From this pencil sketch of your sister\xe2\x80\x99s, which I found in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscrap book.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are making it very like, only the spire is too slender, and that\r\ntree--can\xe2\x80\x99t you alter the foliage?--it is an ash.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it? I took it for an elm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And surely those trees in the foreground should be greener, to throw\r\nback the middle distance. That is the peak of South Moor exactly, if it\r\nlooked further off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe began the alterations, while Philip stood watching her progress,\r\na shade of melancholy gathering on his face. Suddenly, a voice called\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura! Are you there? Open the door, and you will see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn Philip\xe2\x80\x99s opening it, in came a tall camellia; the laughing face,\r\nand light, shining curls of the bearer peeping through the dark green\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you! Oh, is it you, Philip? Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it. I must bring my\r\nown camellia to show Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You make the most of that one flower,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only see how many buds!\xe2\x80\x99 and she placed it by his sofa. Is it not a\r\nperfect blossom, so pure a white, and so regular! And I am so proud of\r\nhaving beaten mamma and all the gardeners, for not another will be out\r\nthis fortnight; and this is to go to the horticultural show. Sam would\r\nhardly trust me to bring it in, though it was my nursing, not his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, when the flower had been duly admired, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmust let me put it into the window, for you. It is too heavy for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, take care,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amabel, but too late; for, as he took it from\r\nher, the solitary flower struck against Charles\xe2\x80\x99s little table, and was\r\nbroken off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Amy, I am very sorry. What a pity! How did it happen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered; \xe2\x80\x98it will last a long time in water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was very unlucky--I am very sorry--especially because of the\r\nhorticultural show.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Make all your apologies to Sam,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98his feelings will be more\r\nhurt than mine. I dare say my poor flower would have caught cold at the\r\nshow, and never held up its head again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer tone was gay; but Charles, who saw her face in the glass, betrayed\r\nher by saying, \xe2\x80\x98Winking away a tear, O Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never nursed a dear gazelle!\xe2\x80\x99 quoted Amy, with a merry laugh; and\r\nbefore any more could be said, there entered a middle-aged gentleman,\r\nshort and slight, with a fresh, weather-beaten, good-natured face, gray\r\nwhiskers, quick eyes, and a hasty, undecided air in look and movement.\r\nHe greeted Philip heartily, and the letter was given to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! Eh? Let us look. Not old Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Eh? What can be the\r\nmatter? What? Dead! This is a sudden thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dead! Who? Sir Guy Morville?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, quite suddenly--poor old man.\xe2\x80\x99 Then stepping to the door, he\r\nopened it, and called, \xe2\x80\x98Mamma; just step here a minute, will you,\r\nmamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe summons was obeyed by a tall, handsome lady, and behind her crept,\r\nwith doubtful steps, as if she knew not how far to venture, a little\r\ngirl of eleven, her turned-up nose and shrewd face full of curiosity.\r\nShe darted up to Amabel; who, though she shook her head, and held up her\r\nfinger, smiled, and took the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand, listening meanwhile to\r\nthe announcement, \xe2\x80\x98Do you hear this, mamma? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a shocking thing! Sir\r\nGuy Morville dead, quite suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed! Well, poor man, I suppose no one ever repented or suffered more\r\nthan he. Who writes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His grandson--poor boy! I can hardly make out his letter.\xe2\x80\x99 Holding it\r\nhalf a yard from his eyes, so that all could see a few lines of hasty,\r\nirregular writing, in a forcible hand, bearing marks of having been\r\npenned under great distress and agitation, he read aloud:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. EDMONSTONE,--\r\n\r\nMy dear grandfather died at six this morning. He had an attack of\r\napoplexy yesterday evening, and never spoke again, though for a short\r\ntime he knew me. We hope he suffered little. Markham will make all\r\narrangements. We propose that the funeral should take place on Tuesday;\r\nI hope you will be able to come. I would write to my cousin, Philip\r\nMorville, if I knew his address; but I depend on you for saying all that\r\nought to be said. Excuse this illegible letter,--I hardly know what I\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cYours, very sincerely,\r\n                                      \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGuy Morville.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98he writes with a great deal of proper\r\nfeeling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very sad for him to be left alone there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very sad--very,\xe2\x80\x99 said her husband. \xe2\x80\x98I must start off to him at\r\nonce--yes, at once. Should you not say so--eh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. I think I had better go with you. It would be the correct\r\nthing, and I should not like to fail in any token of respect for poor\r\nold Sir Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course--of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98it would be the correct\r\nthing. I am sure he was always very civil to us, and you are next heir\r\nafter this boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLittle Charlotte made a sort of jump, lifted her eyebrows, and stared at\r\nAmabel.\r\n\r\nPhilip answered. \xe2\x80\x98That is not worth a thought; but since he and I\r\nare now the only representatives of the two branches of the house of\r\nMorville, it shall not be my fault if the enmity is not forgotten.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Buried in oblivion would sound more magnanimous,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; at\r\nwhich Amabel laughed so uncontrollably, that she was forced to hide\r\nher head on her little sister\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Charlotte laughed too, an\r\nimprudent proceeding, as it attracted attention. Her father smiled,\r\nsaying, half-reprovingly--\xe2\x80\x98So you are there, inquisitive pussy-cat?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nat her mother\xe2\x80\x99s question,--\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte, what business have you here?\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nstole back to her lessons, looking very small, without the satisfaction\r\nof hearing her mother\xe2\x80\x99s compassionate words--\xe2\x80\x98Poor child!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How old is he?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Edmonstone, returning to the former subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is of the same age as Laura--seventeen and a half,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember my brother saying what a satisfaction\r\nit was to see such a noble baby as she was, after such a poor little\r\nmiserable thing as the one at Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is grown into a fine spirited fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose we must have him here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. Should you not\r\nsay so--eh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly; I should think it very good for him. Indeed, his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s death has happened at a most favourable time for him. The\r\npoor old man had such a dread of his going wrong that he kept him--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know--as tight as a drum.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With strictness that I should think very bad for a boy of his impatient\r\ntemper. It would have been a very dangerous experiment to send him at\r\nonce among the temptations of Oxford, after such discipline and solitude\r\nas he has been used to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of it,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Mr. Edmonstone, spreading out his hands\r\nin a deprecating manner. \xe2\x80\x98We must do the best we can with him, for I\r\nhave got him on my hands till he is five-and-twenty--his grandfather\r\nhas tied him up till then. If we can keep him out of mischief, well and\r\ngood; if not, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have him all to yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, to my sorrow. If your poor father was alive, Philip, I should be\r\nfree of all care. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a pretty deal on my hands,\xe2\x80\x99 he proceeded, looking\r\nmore important than troubled. \xe2\x80\x98All that great Redclyffe estate is no\r\nsinecure, to say nothing of the youth himself. If all the world will\r\ncome to me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. I must go and speak to the men, if I am to\r\nbe off to Redclyffe tomorrow. Will you come, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go back soon, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I must see about my\r\nleave; only we should first settle when to set off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis arranged, Mr. Edmonstone hurried away, and Charles began by saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a ghost at Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it is said,\xe2\x80\x99 answered his cousin; \xe2\x80\x98though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is\r\ncertain whose it is. There is a room called Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s Chamber, over\r\nthe gateway, but the honour of naming it is undecided between Hugo de\r\nMorville, who murdered Thomas a Becket, and his namesake, the first\r\nBaronet, who lived in the time of William of Orange, when the quarrel\r\nbegan with our branch of the family. Do you know the history of it,\r\naunt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was about some property,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nthe rights of it. But the Morvilles were always a fiery, violent race,\r\nand the enmity once begun between Sir Hugh and his brother, was kept\r\nup, generation after generation, in a most unjustifiable way. Even I\r\ncan remember when the Morvilles of Redclyffe used to be spoken of in our\r\nfamily like a sort of ogres.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not undeservedly, I should think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98This poor old man, who\r\nis just dead, ran a strange career. Stories of his duels and mad freaks\r\nare still extant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor man! I believe he went all lengths,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was the true version of that horrible story about his son?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x98Did he strike him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! it was bad enough without that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was an only child, and lost his mother early. He was very ill\r\nbrought up, and was as impetuous and violent as Sir Guy himself, though\r\nwith much kindliness and generosity. He was only nineteen when he made a\r\nrunaway marriage with a girl of sixteen, the sister of a violin player,\r\nwho was at that time in fashion. His father was very much offended, and\r\nthere was much dreadfully violent conduct on each side. At last, the\r\nyoung man was driven to seek a reconciliation. He brought his wife to\r\nMoorworth, and rode to Redclyffe, to have an interview with his father.\r\nUnhappily, Sir Guy was giving a dinner to the hunt, and had been\r\ndrinking. He not only refused to see him, but I am afraid he used\r\nshocking language, and said something about bidding him go back to\r\nhis fiddling brother in-law. The son was waiting in the hall, heard\r\neverything, threw himself on his horse, and rushed away in the dark. His\r\nforehead struck against the branch of a tree, and he was killed on the\r\nspot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The poor wife?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Amabel, shuddering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She died the next day, when this boy was born.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Frightful!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98It might well make a reformation in old Sir\r\nGuy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard that nothing could be more awful than the stillness\r\nthat fell on that wretched party, even before they knew what had\r\nhappened--before Colonel Harewood, who had been called aside by the\r\nservants, could resolve to come and fetch away the father. No wonder Sir\r\nGuy was a changed man from that hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was then that he sent for my father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what made him think of doing so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know Colonel Harewood\xe2\x80\x99s house at Stylehurst? Many years ago, when\r\nthe St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s races used to be so much more in fashion, Sir Guy and\r\nColonel Harewood, and some men of that stamp, took that house amongst\r\nthem, and used to spend some time there every year, to attend to\r\nsomething about the training of the horses. There were some malpractices\r\nof their servants, that did so much harm in the parish, that my brother\r\nwas obliged to remonstrate. Sir Guy was very angry at first, but behaved\r\nbetter at last than any of the others. I suspect he was struck by\r\nmy dear brother\xe2\x80\x99s bold, uncompromising ways, for he took to him to a\r\ncertain degree--and my brother could not help being interested in him,\r\nthere seemed to be so much goodness in his nature. I saw him once, and\r\nnever did I meet any one who gave me so much the idea of a finished\r\ngentleman. When the poor son was about fourteen, he was with a tutor in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and used to be a good deal at Stylehurst, and, after\r\nthe unhappy marriage, my brother happened to meet him in London, heard\r\nhis story, and tried to bring about a reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98did not they come to Stylehurst? I have a dim\r\nrecollection of somebody very tall, and a lady who sung.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; your father asked them to stay there, that he might judge of her,\r\nand wrote to Sir Guy that she was a little, gentle, childish thing,\r\ncapable of being moulded to anything, and representing the mischief of\r\nleaving them to such society as that of her brother, who was actually\r\nmaintaining them. That letter was never answered, but about ten days\r\nor a fortnight after this terrible accident, Colonel Harewood wrote to\r\nentreat my brother to come to Redclyffe, saying poor Sir Guy had eagerly\r\ncaught at the mention of his name. Of course he went at once, and he\r\ntold me that he never, in all his experience as a clergyman, saw any one\r\nso completely broken down with grief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI found a great many of his letters among my father\xe2\x80\x99s papers,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip; \xe2\x80\x98and it was a very touching one that he wrote to me on my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death. Those Redclyffe people certainly have great force of\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And was it then he settled his property on my uncle?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98My brother did not like his doing so, but\r\nhe would not be at rest till it was settled. It was in vain to put him\r\nin mind of his grandchild, for he would not believe it could live; and,\r\nindeed, its life hung on a thread. I remember my brother telling me how\r\nhe went to Moorworth to see it--for it could not be brought home--in\r\nhopes of bringing, back a report that might cheer its grandfather, but\r\nhow he found it so weak and delicate, that he did not dare to try to\r\nmake him take interest in it. It was not till the child was two or three\r\nyears old, that Sir Guy ventured to let himself grow fond of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy was a very striking person,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98I shall not easily\r\nforget my visit to Redclyffe four years ago. It was more like a scene in\r\na romance than anything real--the fine old red sandstone house crumbling\r\naway in the exposed parts, the arched gateway covered with ivy; the\r\ngreat quadrangle where the sun never shone, and full of echoes; the\r\nlarge hall and black wainscoted rooms, which the candles never would\r\nlight up. It is a fit place to be haunted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That poor boy alone there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98I am glad you and\r\nyour uncle are going to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell us about him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was the most incongruous thing there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98There was a\r\ncalm, deep melancholy about the old man added to the grand courtesy\r\nwhich showed he had been what old books call a fine gentleman, that made\r\nhim suit his house as a hermit does his cell, or a knight his castle;\r\nbut breaking in on this \xe2\x80\x9cpenseroso\xe2\x80\x9d scene, there was Guy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what way?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always in wild spirits, rushing about, playing antics, provoking the\r\nsolemn echoes with shouting, whooping, singing, whistling. There was\r\nsomething in that whistle of his that always made me angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did this suit old Sir Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was curious to see how Guy could rattle on to him, pour out the\r\nwhole history of his doings, laughing, rubbing his hands, springing\r\nabout with animation--all with as little answer as if he had been\r\ntalking to a statue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean that Sir Guy did not like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did in his own way. There was now and then a glance or a nod, to\r\nshow that he was attending; but it was such slight encouragement, that\r\nany less buoyant spirits must have been checked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you like him, on the whole?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura. \xe2\x80\x98I hope he has not\r\nthis tremendous Morville temper? Oh, you don\xe2\x80\x99t say so. What a grievous\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a fine fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but I did not think Sir Guy managed\r\nhim well. Poor old man, he was quite wrapped up in him, and only thought\r\nhow to keep him out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. He would never let him be with other\r\nboys, and kept him so fettered by rules, so strictly watched, and so\r\nsternly called to account, that I cannot think how any boy could stand\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet, you say, he told everything freely to his grandfather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 added her mother, \xe2\x80\x98I was going to say that, as long as that went\r\non, I should think all safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As I said before,\xe2\x80\x99 resumed Philip, \xe2\x80\x98he has a great deal of frankness,\r\nmuch of the making of a fine character; but he is a thorough Morville. I\r\nremember something that will show you his best and worst sides. You know\r\nRedclyffe is a beautiful place, with magnificent cliffs overhanging the\r\nsea, and fine woods crowning them. On one of the most inaccessible\r\nof these crags there was a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s nest, about half-way down, so that\r\nlooking from the top of the precipice, we could see the old birds fly\r\nin and out. Well, what does Master Guy do, but go down this headlong\r\ndescent after the nest. How he escaped alive no one could guess; and his\r\ngrandfather could not bear to look at the place afterwards--but climb\r\nit he did, and came back with two young hawks, buttoned up inside his\r\njacket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a regular brick for you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles, delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His heart was set on training these birds. He turned the library upside\r\ndown in search of books on falconry, and spent every spare moment on\r\nthem. At last, a servant left some door open, and they escaped. I shall\r\nnever forget Guy\xe2\x80\x99s passion; I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate when I say he\r\nwas perfectly beside himself with anger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor boy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Served the rascal right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing had any effect on him till his grandfather came out, and, at\r\nthe sight of him, he was tamed in an instant, hung his head, came up to\r\nhis grandfather, and said--\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Guy answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d and there was not another word. I saw Guy no more that day, and\r\nall the next he was quiet and subdued. But the most remarkable part of\r\nthe story is to come. A couple of days afterwards we were walking in\r\nthe woods, when, at the sound of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s whistle, we heard a flapping and\r\nrustling, and beheld, tumbling along, with their clipped wings, these\r\ntwo identical hawks, very glad to be caught. They drew themselves up\r\nproudly for him to stroke them, and their yellow eyes looked at him with\r\npositive affection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty creatures!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98That is a very nice end to the story.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not the end,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I was surprised to see Guy so sober,\r\ninstead of going into one of his usual raptures. He took them home; but\r\nthe first thing I heard in the morning was, that he was gone to offer\r\nthem to a farmer, to keep the birds from his fruit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he do it of his own accord?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was just what I wanted to know; but any hint about them brought\r\nsuch a cloud over his face that I thought it would be wanton to irritate\r\nhim by questions. However, I must be going. Good-bye, Amy, I hope your\r\nCamellia will have another blossom before I come back. At least, I shall\r\nescape the horticultural meeting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Put the feud in your pocket till you can\r\nbury it in old Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s grave, unless you mean to fight it out with his\r\ngrandson, which would be more romantic and exciting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was gone before he could finish. Mrs. Edmonstone looked annoyed,\r\nand Laura said, \xe2\x80\x98Charlie, I wish you would not let your spirits carry\r\nyou away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I had anything else to carry me away!\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said his mother, looking sadly at him. \xe2\x80\x98Your high spirits are a\r\nblessing; but why misuse them? If they are given to support you through\r\npain and confinement, why make mischief with them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles looked more impatient than abashed, and the compunction seemed\r\nchiefly to rest with Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98I must go and see after my poor little\r\nprisoner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, as she went; \xe2\x80\x98it was no kindness in you to encourage\r\nCharlotte to stay, Amy, when you know how often that inquisitive temper\r\nhas got her into scrapes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, regretfully; \xe2\x80\x98but I had not the heart to send\r\nher away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is just what Philip says, that you only want bones and sinews in\r\nyour character to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear Philip\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms\r\nof my sister, I had rather she had no bones at all, than that they stuck\r\nout and ran into me. There are plenty of angles already in the world,\r\nwithout sharpening hers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe possessed himself of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s round, plump, childish hand, and spread\r\nout over it his still whiter, and very bony fingers, pinching her \xe2\x80\x98soft\r\npinky cushions,\xe2\x80\x99 as he called them, \xe2\x80\x98not meant for studying anatomy\r\nupon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you two spoil each other sadly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling, as she left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do Philip and Laura do to each other?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Improve each other, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, in a shy, simple tone, at\r\nwhich Charles laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I was as sensible as Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, presently, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was a more absurd wish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, tormenting her hand still\r\nmore, and pulling her curls; \xe2\x80\x98unwish it forthwith. Where should I be\r\nwithout silly little Amy? If every one weighed my wit before laughing, I\r\nshould not often be in disgrace for my high spirits, as they call them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so little younger than Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, still sadly, though\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Folly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98you are quite wise enough for your age, while\r\nLaura is so prematurely wise, that I am in constant dread that nature\r\nwill take her revenge by causing her to do something strikingly\r\nfoolish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy, indignantly. \xe2\x80\x98Laura do anything foolish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What I should enjoy,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles, \xe2\x80\x98would be to see her over head\r\nand ears in love with this hero, and Philip properly jealous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you say such things, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why? was there ever a beauty who did not fall in love with her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nward?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; but she ought to live alone with her very old father and horribly\r\ngrim maiden aunt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well, Amy, you shall be the maiden, aunt.\xe2\x80\x99 And as Laura returned\r\nat that moment, he announced to her that they had been agreeing that no\r\nhero ever failed to fall in love with his guardian\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If his guardian had a beautiful daughter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, resolved not to\r\nbe disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever hear such barefaced fishing for compliments?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles; but Amabel, who did not like her sister to be teased, and\r\nwas also conscious of having wasted a good deal of time, sat down to\r\npractise. Laura returned to her drawing, and Charles, with a yawn,\r\nlistlessly turned over a newspaper, while his fair delicate features,\r\nwhich would have been handsome but that they were blanched, sharpened,\r\nand worn with pain, gradually lost their animated and rather satirical\r\nexpression, and assumed an air of weariness and discontent.\r\n\r\nCharles was at this time nineteen, and for the last ten years had been\r\nafflicted with a disease in the hip-joint, which, in spite of the\r\nmost anxious care, caused him frequent and severe suffering, and had\r\noccasioned such a contraction of the limb as to cripple him completely,\r\nwhile his general health was so much affected as to render him an object\r\nof constant anxiety. His mother had always been his most devoted and\r\nindefatigable nurse, giving up everything for his sake, and watching him\r\nnight and day. His father attended to his least caprice, and his sisters\r\nwere, of course, his slaves; so that he was the undisputed sovereign of\r\nthe whole family.\r\n\r\nThe two elder girls had been entirely under a governess till a month\r\nor two before the opening of our story, when Laura was old enough to\r\nbe introduced; and the governess departing, the two sisters became\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s companions in the drawing-room, while Mrs. Edmonstone, who had\r\na peculiar taste and talent for teaching, undertook little Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlessons herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\n     If the ill spirit have so fair a house,\r\n     Good things will strive to dwell with\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n                                --THE TEMPEST\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasantest rooms at Hollywell was Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndressing-room--large and bay-windowed, over the drawing-room, having\r\nlittle of the dressing-room but the name, and a toilet-table with a\r\nblack and gold japanned glass, and curiously shaped boxes to match; her\r\nroom opened into it on one side, and Charles\xe2\x80\x99s on the other; it was a\r\nsort of up-stairs parlour, where she taught Charlotte, cast up accounts,\r\nspoke to servants, and wrote notes, and where Charles was usually to\r\nbe found, when unequal to coming down-stairs. It had an air of great\r\nsnugness, with its large folding-screen, covered with prints and\r\ncaricatures of ancient date, its book-shelves, its tables, its\r\npeculiarly easy arm-chairs, the great invalid sofa, and the grate, which\r\nalways lighted up better than any other in the house.\r\n\r\nIn the bright glow of the fire, with the shutters closed and curtains\r\ndrawn, lay Charles on his couch, one Monday evening, in a gorgeous\r\ndressing-gown of a Chinese pattern, all over pagodas, while little\r\nCharlotte sat opposite to him, curled up on a footstool. He was not\r\nalways very civil to Charlotte; she sometimes came into collision with\r\nhim, for she, too, was a pet, and had a will of her own, and at other\r\ntimes she could bore him; but just now they had a common interest, and\r\nhe was gracious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is striking six, so they must soon be here. I wish mamma would let\r\nme go down; but I must wait till after dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, Charlotte, as soon as you come in, hold up your hands, and\r\nexclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a guy!\xe2\x80\x9d There will be a compliment!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Charlie; I promised mamma and Laura that you should get me into no\r\nmore scrapes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you? The next promise you make had better depend upon yourself\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But Amy said I must be quiet, because poor Sir Guy will be too\r\nsorrowful to like a racket; and when Amy tells me to be quiet, I know\r\nthat I must, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most true,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think you shall like Sir Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be able to determine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, sententiously, \xe2\x80\x98when I\r\nhave seen whether he brushes his hair to the right or left.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip brushes his to the left.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then undoubtedly Sir Guy will brush his to the right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there not some horrid story about those Morvilles of Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98I asked Laura, and she told me not to be curious, so\r\nI knew there was something in it; and then I asked Amy, and she said it\r\nwould be no pleasure to me to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I would have you prepared.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, what is it? Oh! dear Charlie! are you really going to tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever hear of a deadly feud?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have read of them in the history of Scotland. They went on hating\r\nand killing each other for ever. There was one man who made his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren eat out of a pig-trough, and another who cut off his head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His own?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s, and put it on the table, at breakfast, with a piece of\r\nbread in its mouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well; whenever Sir Guy serves up Philip\xe2\x80\x99s head at breakfast, with\r\na piece of bread in his mouth, let me know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte started up. \xe2\x80\x98Charles, what do you mean? Such things don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhappen now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nevertheless, there is a deadly feud between the two branches of the\r\nhouse of Morville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is very wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, looking frightened.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wrong? Of course it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip won\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong. But how will they ever get on?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? It must be our serious endeavour to keep the peace, and\r\nprevent occasions of discord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think anything will happen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is much to be apprehended,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, solemnly.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sound of wheels was heard, and Charlotte flew off to\r\nher private post of observation, leaving her brother delighted at having\r\nmystified her. She returned on tip-toe. \xe2\x80\x98Papa and Sir Guy are come, but\r\nnot Philip; I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him anywhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah you have not looked in Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s great-coat pocket.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would not plague me so! You are not in earnest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe pettish inquiring tone was exactly what delighted him. And he\r\ncontinued to tease her in the same style till Laura and Amabel came\r\nrunning in with their report of the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is come!\xe2\x80\x99 they cried, with one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very gentlemanlike!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very pleasant looking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Such fine eyes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so much expression,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe exclamation, and the start which accompanied it, were caused by\r\nhearing her father\xe2\x80\x99s voice close to the door, which had been left partly\r\nopen. \xe2\x80\x98Here is poor Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 it said, \xe2\x80\x98come in, and see him; get over\r\nthe first introduction--eh, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 And before he had finished, both he\r\nand the guest were in the room, and Charlotte full of mischievous glee\r\nat her sister\xe2\x80\x99s confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Charlie, boy, how goes it?\xe2\x80\x99 was his father\xe2\x80\x99s greeting. \xe2\x80\x98Better,\r\neh? Sorry not to find you down-stairs; but I have brought Guy to\r\nsee you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, as Charles sat up and shook hands with Sir Guy, he\r\ncontinued--\xe2\x80\x98A fine chance for you, as I was telling him, to have a\r\ncompanion always at hand: a fine chance? eh, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so unreasonable as to expect any one to be always at hand,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles, smiling, as he looked up at the frank, open face, and\r\nlustrous hazel eyes turned on him with compassion at the sight of\r\nhis crippled, helpless figure, and with a bright, cordial promise of\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a pattering sound approached, the door was pushed open,\r\nand while Sir Guy exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98O, Bustle! Bustle! I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 there\r\nsuddenly appeared a large beautiful spaniel, with a long silky black and\r\nwhite coat, jetty curled ears, tan spots above his intelligent eyes, and\r\ntan legs, fringed with silken waves of hair, but crouching and looking\r\nbeseeching at meeting no welcome, while Sir Guy seemed much distressed\r\nat his intrusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O you beauty!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Come here, you fine fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBustle only looked wistfully at his master, and moved nothing but his\r\nfeather of a tail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I was afraid you would repent of your kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Guy to\r\nMr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, not at all!\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer; \xe2\x80\x98mamma never objects to\r\nin-door pets, eh, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A tender subject, papa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98poor Pepper!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy, ashamed of her disposition to cry at the remembrance of the dear\r\ndeparted rough terrier, bent down to hide her glowing face, and held out\r\nher hand to the dog, which at last ventured to advance, still creeping\r\nwith his body curved till his tail was foremost, looking imploringly at\r\nhis master, as if to entreat his pardon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike it?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Sir Guy, of Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I? O no. Here, you fine creature.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, then, behave like a rational dog, since you are come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir\r\nGuy; and Bustle, resuming the deportment of a spirited and well-bred\r\nspaniel, no longer crouched and curled himself into the shape of a\r\ncomma, but bounded, wagged his tail, thrust his nose into his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand and then proceeded to reconnoitre the rest of the company, paying\r\nespecial attention to Charles, putting his fore-paws on the sofa, and\r\nrearing himself up to contemplate him with a grave, polite curiosity,\r\nthat was very diverting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98did you ever see the like of such a\r\ndressing-gown? Are you satisfied? Give me your paw, and let us swear an\r\neternal friendship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite glad to see a dog in the house again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, and,\r\nafter a few more compliments, Bustle and his master followed Mr.\r\nEdmonstone out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of my father\xe2\x80\x99s well-judged proceedings,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Charles. \xe2\x80\x98That\r\npoor fellow had rather have gone a dozen, miles further than have been\r\nlugged in here. Really, if papa chooses to inflict such dressing-gowns\r\non me, he should give me notice before he brings men and dogs to make me\r\ntheir laughing-stock!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An unlucky moment,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Will my cheeks ever cool?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he did not hear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, consolingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did not ask about Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, with great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is staying at Thorndale, and then going to St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you are relieved,\xe2\x80\x99 said her brother; and she looked in doubt\r\nwhether she ought to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you think of Sir Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May he only be worthy of his dog!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98many men are neither worthy of their wives, nor of\r\ntheir dogs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Henley, I suppose, is the foundation of that aphorism,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Margaret Morville could marry him, she could hardly be too worthy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Think of throwing away Philip\xe2\x80\x99s whole soul!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Laura, she could not lose that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel.\r\n\r\nLaura looked as if she knew more; but at that moment, both her father\r\nand mother entered, the former rubbing his hands, as he always did when\r\nmuch pleased, and sending his voice before him, as he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nCharlie, well, young ladies, is not he a fine fellow--eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather under-sized,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? He\xe2\x80\x99ll grow. He is not eighteen, you know; plenty of time; a very\r\ngood height; you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect every one to be as tall as Philip; but\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s a capital fellow. And how have you been?--any pain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem--rather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, shortly, for he hated answering kind\r\ninquiries, when out of humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s a pity; I was sorry not to find you in the drawing-room, but\r\nI thought you would have liked just to see him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone,\r\ndisappointed, and apologizing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had rather have had some notice of your intention,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwould have made myself fit to be seen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry. I thought you would have liked his coming,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, only half conscious of his offence; \xe2\x80\x98but I see you are not\r\nwell this evening.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWorse and worse, for it was equivalent to openly telling Charles he was\r\nout of humour; and seeing, as he did, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s motive, he was still\r\nfurther annoyed when she hastily interposed a question about Sir Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should only hear them talk about him at Redclyffe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98No one was ever equal to him, according to them. Every one\r\nsaid the same--clergyman, old Markham, all of them. Such attention to\r\nhis grandfather, such proper feeling, so good-natured, not a bit of\r\npride--it is my firm belief that he will make up for all his family\r\nbefore him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles set up his eyebrows sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How does he get on with Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excellently. Just what could be wished. Philip is delighted with him;\r\nand I have been telling Guy all the way home what a capital friend he\r\nwill be, and he is quite inclined to look up to him.\xe2\x80\x99 Charles made an\r\nexaggerated gesture of astonishment, unseen by his father. \xe2\x80\x98I told him\r\nto bring his dog. He would have left it, but they seemed so fond of each\r\nother, I thought it was a pity to part them, and that I could promise it\r\nshould be welcome here; eh, mamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. I am very glad you brought it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are to have his horse and man in a little while. A beautiful\r\nchestnut--anything to raise his spirits. He is terribly cut up about his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nIt was now time to go down to dinner; and after Charles had made faces\r\nof weariness and disgust at all the viands proposed to him by his\r\nmother, almost imploring him to like them, and had at last ungraciously\r\ngiven her leave to send what he could not quite say he disliked, he was\r\nleft to carry on his teasing of Charlotte, and his grumbling over the\r\ndinner, for about the space of an hour, when Amabel came back to him,\r\nand Charlotte went down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hum!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Another swan of my father\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did not you like his looks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw only an angular hobbetyhoy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But every one at Redclyffe speaks so well of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if the same things were not said of every heir to more acres than\r\nbrains! However, I could have swallowed everything but the disposition\r\nto adore Philip. Either it was gammon on his part, or else the work of\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s imagination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For shame, Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it within the bounds of probability that he should be willing, at\r\nthe bidding of his guardian, to adopt as Mentor his very correct and\r\nsententious cousin, a poor subaltern, and the next in the entail? Depend\r\nupon it, it is a fiction created either by papa\xe2\x80\x99s hopes or Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-complacency, or else the unfortunate youth must have been brought\r\nvery low by strait-lacing and milk-and-water.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Thorndale is willing to look up to Philip,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Thorndale swan very--very much better than a tame\r\ngoose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98but the coalition is not so monstrous in his\r\ncase, since Philip was a friend of his own picking and choosing, and\r\nso his father\xe2\x80\x99s adoption did not succeed in repelling him. But that\r\nMorville should receive this \xe2\x80\x9cyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s companion,\xe2\x80\x9d on the word of a\r\nguardian whom he never set eyes on before, is too incredible--utterly\r\nmythical I assure you, Amy. And how did you get on at dinner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the dog is the most delightful creature I ever saw, so sensible and\r\nwell-mannered.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was of the man that I asked.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He said hardly anything, and sometimes started if papa spoke to him\r\nsuddenly. He winced as if he could not bear to be called Sir Guy, so\r\npapa said we should call him only by his name, if he would do the same\r\nby us. I am glad of it, for it seems more friendly, and I am sure he\r\nwants to be comforted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your compassion, my dear; few men need it less. With his\r\nproperty, those moors to shoot over, his own master, and with health to\r\nenjoy it, there are plenty who would change with him for all your pity,\r\nmy silly little Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely not, with that horrible ancestry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All very well to plume oneself upon. I rather covet that ghost myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if you watched his face, I think you would be sorry for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am tired of the sound of his name. One fifth of November is enough in\r\nthe year. Here, find something to read to me among that trumpery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy read till she was summoned to tea, when she found a conversation\r\ngoing on about Philip, on whose history Sir Guy did not seem fully\r\ninformed. Philip was the son of Archdeacon Morville, Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother, an admirable and superior man, who had been dead about five\r\nyears. He left three children, Margaret and Fanny, twenty-five and\r\ntwenty-three years of age, and Philip, just seventeen. The boy was at\r\nthe head of his school, highly distinguished for application and good\r\nconduct; he had attained every honour there open to him, won golden\r\nopinions from all concerned with him, and made proof of talents\r\nwhich could not have failed to raise him to the highest university\r\ndistinctions. He was absent from home at the time of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death,\r\nwhich took place after so short an illness, that there had been no time\r\nto summon him back to Stylehurst. Very little property was left to be\r\ndivided among the three; and as soon as Philip perceived how small\r\nwas the provision for his sisters, he gave up his hopes of university\r\nhonours, and obtained a commission in the army.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Sir Guy started forward: \xe2\x80\x98Noble!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98and yet\r\nwhat a pity! If my grandfather had but known it--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I was convinced of _that_,\xe2\x80\x99 broke in Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98and so, I am\r\nsure, was Philip himself; but in fact he knew we should never have given\r\nour consent, so he acted quite by himself, wrote to Lord Thorndale, and\r\nnever said a word, even to his sisters, till the thing was done. I never\r\nwas more surprised in my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One would almost envy him the opportunity of making such a sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Sir Guy, yet one must lament it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was done in a hasty spirit of independence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe if he had got a fellowship at Oxford, it would have answered\r\nmuch better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now that poor Fanny is dead, and Margaret married, there is all\r\nhis expensive education thrown away, and all for nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nEdmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98he planned for them to go on living at\r\nStylehurst, so that it would still have been his home. It is a\r\ngreat pity, for his talent is thrown away, and he is not fond of his\r\nprofession.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not suppose, though, that he is not a practical man,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nEdmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98I had rather take his opinion than any one\xe2\x80\x99s, especially\r\nabout a horse, and there is no end to what I hear about his good sense,\r\nand the use he is of to the other young men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should tell about Mr. Thorndale, papa,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah that is a feather in master Philip\xe2\x80\x99s cap; besides, he is your\r\nneighbour--at least, his father is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you know Lord Thorndale?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, in\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen him once at the Quarter Sessions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sir Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but he\r\nlives on the other side of Moorworth, and there was no visiting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, this youth, James Thorndale, the second son, was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s fag.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip says he was always licking him!\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He kept him out of some scrape or other, continued Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord Thorndale was very much obliged to him, had him to stay at his\r\nhouse, took pretty much to him altogether. It was through him that\r\nPhilip applied for his commission, and he has put his son into the same\r\nregiment, on purpose to have him under Philip\xe2\x80\x99s eye. There he is at\r\nBroadstone, as gentlemanlike a youth as I would wish to see. We will\r\nhave him to dinner some day, and Maurice too--eh, mamma? Maurice--he is\r\na young Irish cousin of my own, a capital fellow at the bottom, but a\r\nregular thoroughgoing rattle. That was my doing. I told his father that\r\nhe could not do better than put him into the --th. Nothing like a steady\r\nfriend and a good example, I said, and Kilcoran always takes my advice,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has been sorry. Maurice has kept much more out of\r\nscrapes of late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O papa,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98Maurice has been out riding on a hired\r\nhorse, racing with Mr. Gordon, and the horse tumbled down at the bottom\r\nof East-hill, and broke its knees.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98the instant my back is turned.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereupon the family fell into a discussion of home affairs, and thought\r\nlittle more of their silent guest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\n     The hues of bliss more brightly glow\r\n     Chastised by sober tints of woe.\r\n                                 --GRAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What use shall I make of him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles to himself, as he studied\r\nSir Guy Morville, who sat by the table, with a book in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe had the unformed look of a growing boy, and was so slender as to\r\nappear taller than he really was. He had an air of great activity; and\r\nthough he sat leaning back, there was no lounging in his attitude, and\r\nat the first summons he roused up with an air of alert attention that\r\nrecalled to mind the eager head of a listening greyhound. He had no\r\npretension to be called handsome; his eyes were his best feature; they\r\nwere very peculiar, of a light hazel, darker towards the outside of\r\nthe iris, very brilliant, the whites tinted with blue, and the lashes\r\nuncommonly thick and black; the eyebrows were also very dark, and of\r\na sharply-defined angular shape, but the hair was much lighter, loose,\r\nsoft, and wavy; the natural fairness of the complexion was shown by\r\nthe whiteness of the upper part of the forehead, though the rest of\r\nthe face, as well as the small taper hands, were tanned by sunshine and\r\nsea-breezes, into a fresh, hardy brown, glowing with red on the cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What use shall I make of him?\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t be worth his salt if he goes on in this way; he has got a graver\r\nspecimen of literature there than I ever saw Philip himself read on\r\na week-day; he has been puritanized till he is good for nothing; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntrouble myself no more about him!\xe2\x80\x99 He tried to read, but presently\r\nlooked up again. \xe2\x80\x98Plague! I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep my thoughts off him. That sober\r\nlook does not sit on that sun-burnt face as if it were native to it;\r\nthose eyes don\xe2\x80\x99t look as if the Redclyffe spirit was extinguished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone came in, and looking round, as if to find some\r\noccupation for her guest, at length devised setting him to play at chess\r\nwith Charles. Charles gave her an amiable look, expressing that neither\r\nliked it; but she was pretty well used to doing him good against his\r\nwill, and trusted to its coming right in time. Charles was a capital\r\nchess-player, and seldom found any one who could play well enough to\r\nafford him much real sport, but he found Sir Guy more nearly a match\r\nthan often fell to his lot; it was a bold dashing game, that obliged\r\nhim to be on his guard, and he was once so taken by surprise as to be\r\nabsolutely check-mated. His ill-humour evaporated, he was delighted to\r\nfind an opponent worth playing with, and henceforth there were games\r\nalmost every morning or evening, though Sir Guy seemed not to care much\r\nabout them, except for the sake of pleasing him.\r\n\r\nWhen left to himself, Guy spent his time in reading or in walking about\r\nthe lanes alone. He used to sit in the bay-window of the drawing-room\r\nwith his book; but sometimes, when they least expected it, the\r\ngirls would find his quick eyes following them with an air of amused\r\ncuriosity, as Amabel waited on Charles and her flowers, or Laura\r\ndrew, wrote letters, and strove to keep down the piles of books and\r\nperiodicals under which it seemed as if her brother might some day be\r\nstifled--a vain task, for he was sure to want immediately whatever she\r\nput out of his reach.\r\n\r\nLaura and Amabel both played and sung, the former remarkably well, and\r\nthe first time they had any music after the arrival of Sir Guy, his look\r\nof delighted attention struck everyone. He ventured nearer, stood by the\r\npiano when they practised, and at last joined in with a few notes of\r\nso full and melodious a voice, that Laura turned round in surprise,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98You sing better I than any of us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe coloured. \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I could not help it; I know\r\nnothing of music.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know the notes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you must have a very good ear. Let us try again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sisters were again charmed and surprised, and Guy looked gratified,\r\nas people do at the discovery of a faculty which they are particularly\r\nglad to possess. It was the first time he appeared to brighten, and\r\nLaura and her mother agreed that it would do him good to have plenty of\r\nmusic, and to try to train that fine voice. He was beginning to interest\r\nthem all greatly by his great helpfulness and kindness to Charles, as\r\nhe learnt the sort of assistance he required, as well as by the\r\nsilent grief that showed how much attached he must have been to his\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nOn the first Sunday, Mrs. Edmonstone coming into the drawing-room at\r\nabout half-past five, found him sitting alone by the fire, his dog lying\r\nat his feet. As he started up, she asked if he had been here in the dark\r\never since church-time?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not wanted light,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered with a sigh, long, deep, and\r\nirrepressible, and as she stirred the fire, the flame revealed to her\r\nthe traces of tears. She longed to comfort him, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This Sunday twilight is a quiet time for thinking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98how few Sundays ago--\xe2\x80\x99 and there he paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you had so little preparation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None. That very morning he had done business with Markham, and had\r\nnever been more clear and collected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you with him when he was taken ill?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nperceiving that it would be a relief to him to talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; it was just before dinner. I had been shooting, and went into the\r\nlibrary to tell him where I had been. He was well then, for he spoke,\r\nbut it was getting dark, and I did not see his face. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\r\nwas ten minutes dressing, but when I came down, he had sunk back in his\r\nchair. I saw it was not sleep--I rang--and when Arnaud came, we knew how\r\nit was.\xe2\x80\x99 His, voice became low with strong emotion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he recover his consciousness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that was _the_ comfort,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98It was after he had\r\nbeen bled that he seemed to wake up. He could not speak or move, but he\r\nlooked at me--or--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should have done.\xe2\x80\x99 The last words\r\nwere almost inaudible from the gush of tears that he vainly struggled\r\nto repress, and he was turning away to hide them, when he saw that Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s were flowing fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had great reason to be attached to him!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as soon as she\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, indeed I had.\xe2\x80\x99 And after a long silence--\xe2\x80\x98He was everything to\r\nme, everything from the first hour I can recollect. He never let me\r\nmiss my parents. How he attended to all my pleasures and wishes, how he\r\nwatched and cared for me, and bore with me, even I can never know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke in short half sentences of intense feeling, and Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nwas much moved by such affection in one said to have been treated with\r\nan excess of strictness, much compassionating the lonely boy, who had\r\nlost every family tie in one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When the first pain of the sudden parting has passed,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nwill like to remember the affection which you knew how to value.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had but known!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but there was I, hasty, reckless,\r\ndisregarding his comfort, rebelling against--O, what would I not give to\r\nhave those restraints restored!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is what we all feel in such losses,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98There is\r\nalways much to wish otherwise; but I am sure you can have the happiness\r\nof knowing you were his great comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was what I ought to have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe knew that nothing could have been more filial and affectionate than\r\nhis conduct, and tried to say something of the kind, but he would not\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is worst of all,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and you must not trust what they say\r\nof me. They would be sure to praise me, if I was anything short of a\r\nbrute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA silence ensued, while Mrs. Edmonstone was trying to think of some\r\nconsolation. Suddenly Guy looked up, and spoke eagerly:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to ask something--a great favour--but you make me venture. You\r\nsee how I am left alone--you know how little I can trust myself. Will\r\nyou take me in hand--let me talk to you--and tell me if I am wrong, as\r\nfreely as if I were Charles? I know it is asking a great deal, but you\r\nknew my grandfather, and it is in his name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand; and with tears answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I will, if I see any occasion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will let me trust to you to tell me when I get too vehement? above\r\nall, when you see my temper failing? Thank you; you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a\r\nrelief it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you must not call yourself alone. You are one of us now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; since you have made that promise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; and for the first\r\ntime she saw the full beauty of his smile--a sort of sweetness and\r\nradiance of which eye and brow partook almost as much as the lips. It\r\nalone would have gained her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must look on you as a kind of nephew,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, kindly. \xe2\x80\x98I used to\r\nhear so much of you from my brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, lighting up, \xe2\x80\x98Archdeacon Morville was always so kind to\r\nme. I remember him very well!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I wish--\xe2\x80\x99 there she paused, and added,--t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate \xe2\x80\x98it is not\r\nright to wish such things--and Philip is very like his father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad his regiment is so near. I want to know him better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You knew him at Redclyffe, when he was staying there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, his colour rising; \xe2\x80\x98but I was a boy then, and a\r\nvery foolish, headstrong one. I am glad to meet him again. What a\r\ngrand-looking person he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are very proud of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink there has been an hour\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety about him since he was born.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe conversation was interrupted by the sound of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s crutches\r\nslowly crossing the hall. Guy sprang to help him to his sofa, and then,\r\nwithout speaking, hurried up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma, tete-a-tete with the silent one!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not tell you all I think of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, leaving the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hum!\xe2\x80\x99 soliloquised Charles. \xe2\x80\x98That means that my lady mother has adopted\r\nhim, and thinks I should laugh at her, or straightway set up a dislike\r\nto him, knowing my contempt for heroes and hero-worship. It\xe2\x80\x99s a treat\r\nto have Philip out of the way, and if it was but possible to get out of\r\nhearing of his perfection, I should have some peace. If I thought this\r\nfellow had one spice of the kind, I\xe2\x80\x99d never trouble my head about him\r\nmore; and yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has such a pair of hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for\r\nnothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe hawk\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, as Charles called them, shone brighter from that\r\nday forth, and their owner began to show more interest in what passed\r\naround. Laura was much amused by a little conversation she held with\r\nhim one day when a party of their younger neighbours were laughing and\r\ntalking nonsense round Charles\xe2\x80\x99s sofa. He was sitting a little way off\r\nin silence, and she took advantage of the loud laughing to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think this is not very satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x99 And as he gave a quick glance\r\nof inquiry--\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind saying so. Philip and I often agree that it is a\r\npity spend so much time in laughing at nothing--at such nonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is nonsense?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen--no don\xe2\x80\x99t, it is too silly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense must be an excellent thing if it makes people so happy,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x98Look at them; they are like--not a picture--that has\r\nno life--but a dream--or, perhaps a scene in a play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you never see anything like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! All the morning calls I ever saw were formal, every one stiff,\r\nand speaking by rote, or talking politics. How glad I used to be to get\r\non horseback again! But to see these--why, it is like the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglimpse at the pixies!--as one reads a new book, or watches what one\r\nonly half understands--a rook\xe2\x80\x99s parliament, or a gathering of sea-fowl\r\non the Shag Rock.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A rook\xe2\x80\x99s parliament?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The people at home call it a rook\xe2\x80\x99s parliament when a whole cloud of\r\nrooks settle on some bare, wide common, and sit there as if they were\r\nconsulting, not feeding, only stalking about, with drooping wings, and\r\nsolemn, black cloaks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have found a flattering simile,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98as you know that\r\nrooks never open their mouths without cause.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy had never heard the riddle, but he caught the pun instantly, and the\r\nclear merry sound of his hearty laugh surprised Charles, who instantly\r\nnoted it as another proof that was some life in him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, each day began to make it evident that he had, on the whole,\r\nrather a superabundance of animation than otherwise. He was quite\r\nconfidential with Mrs. Edmonstone, on whom he used to lavish, with\r\nboyish eagerness, all that interested him, carrying her the passages\r\nin books that pleased him, telling her about Redclyffe\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, and\r\ngiving her his letters from Markham, the steward. His head was full\r\nof his horse, Deloraine, which was coming to him under the charge of a\r\ngroom, and the consultations were endless about the means of transport,\r\nMr. Edmonstone almost as eager about it as he was himself.\r\n\r\nHe did not so quickly become at home with the younger portion of the\r\nfamily, but his spirits rose every day. He whistled as he walked in the\r\ngarden, and Bustle, instead of pacing soberly behind him, now capered,\r\nnibbled his pockets, and drew him into games of play which Charles and\r\nAmabel were charmed to overlook from the dressing-room window. There was\r\nGuy leaping, bounding, racing, rolling the dog over, tripping him up,\r\ntwitching his ears, tickling his feet, catching at his tail, laughing at\r\nBustle\xe2\x80\x99s springs, contortions, and harmless open-mouthed attacks, while\r\nthe dog did little less than laugh too, with his intelligent amber eyes,\r\nand black and red mouth. Charles began to find a new interest in his\r\nlistless life in the attempt to draw Guy out, and make him give one of\r\nhis merry laughs. In this, however, he failed when his wit consisted\r\nin allusions to the novels of the day, of which Guy knew nothing. One\r\nmorning he underwent a regular examination, ending in--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you read anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I am very ignorant of modern books.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you read the ancient ones?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had nothing else to read.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing to read but ancient books!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amabel, with a mixture of\r\npity and astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sanchoniathon, Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98if he has the Vicar of Wakefield among his\r\nancient books, you need not pity him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is like Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98he was brought up on the old standard\r\nbooks, instead of his time being frittered away on the host of idle\r\nmodern ones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was free to concentrate his attention on Sir Charles Grandison,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could any one do so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98How could any one have any\r\nsympathy with such a piece of self-satisfaction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who could? Eh, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never read it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, suspecting malice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is your opinion of perfect heroes?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here comes one,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Amy to her brother, blushing at her piece of\r\nnaughtiness, as Philip Morville entered the room.\r\n\r\nAfter the first greetings and inquiries after his sister, whom he had\r\nbeen visiting, Laura told him what they had been saying of the advantage\r\nof a scanty range of reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98I have often been struck by finding how ignorant\r\npeople are, even of Shakspeare; and I believe the blame chiefly rests on\r\nthe cheap rubbish in which Charlie is nearly walled up there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98and who haunts that rubbish at the beginning of\r\nevery month? I suppose to act as pioneer, though whether any one but\r\nLaura heeds his warnings, remains to be proved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura does heed?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Philip, well pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I made her read me the part of Dombey that hurts women\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nmost, just to see if she would go on--the part about little Paul--and\r\nI declare, I shall think the worse of her ever after--she was so stony\r\nhearted, that to this day she does not know whether he is dead or\r\nalive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite say I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he lived or died,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98for I found Amy in a state that alarmed me, crying in the green-house,\r\nand I was very glad to find it was nothing worse than little Paul.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would have read it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; and looking shyly at Guy, she\r\nadded--\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done, Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98In the very face of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip does not really think it wrong,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98those books open fields of thought, and as their\r\nprinciples are negative, they are not likely to hurt a person well armed\r\nwith the truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meaning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that Guy and Laura have your gracious\r\npermission to read Dombey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When Laura has a cold or toothache.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not sure about, the expediency for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip \xe2\x80\x98it would be\r\na pity to begin with Dickens, when there is so much of a higher grade\r\nequally new to you. I suppose you do not understand Italian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, abruptly, and his dark eyebrows contracted.\r\n\r\nPhilip went on. \xe2\x80\x98If you did, I should not recommend you the translation\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cI promessi Sponsi,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the most beautiful books in any language.\r\nYou have it in English, I think, Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura fetched it; Guy, with a constrained \xe2\x80\x98thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 was going to take\r\nit up rather as if he was putting a force upon himself, when Philip\r\nmore quickly took the first volume, and eagerly turned over the pages--I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t stand this,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98where is the original?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was soon produced; and Philip, finding the beautiful history of Fra\r\nCristoforo, began to translate it fluently and with an admirable choice\r\nof language that silenced Charles\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to interrupt and criticise.\r\nSoon Guy, who had at first lent only reluctant attention, was entirely\r\nabsorbed, his eyebrows relaxed, a look of earnest interest succeeded,\r\nhis countenance softened, and when Fra Cristoforo humbled himself,\r\nexchanged forgiveness, and received \xe2\x80\x9cil pane del perdono,\xe2\x80\x9d tears hung on\r\nhis eyelashes.\r\n\r\nThe chapter was finished, and with a smothered exclamation of\r\nadmiration, he joined the others in begging Philip to proceed. The story\r\nthus read was very unlike what it had been to Laura and Amy, when they\r\npuzzled it out as an Italian lesson, or to Charles, when he carelessly\r\ntossed over the translation in search of Don Abbondio\xe2\x80\x99s humours;\r\nand thus between reading and conversation, the morning passed very\r\nagreeably.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon, Mr. Edmonstone asked Philip to come and spend a day or two\r\nat Hollywell, and he accepted the invitation for the next week. \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\nmake Thorndale drive me out if you will give him a dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98we shall be delighted. We\r\nwere talking of asking him, a day or two ago; eh, mamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98a family party is an especial treat to him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlaying a particular stress on the word \xe2\x80\x98family party,\xe2\x80\x99 and looking at\r\nhis aunt.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the butler came in, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s servant is come,\r\nand has brought the horse, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Deloraine come!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, springing up. \xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At the door, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy darted out, Mr. Edmonstone following. In another instant, however,\r\nGuy put his head into the room again. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Edmonstone, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come\r\nand see him? Philip, you have not seen Deloraine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOff he rushed, and the others were just in time to see the cordial look\r\nof honest gladness with which William, the groom, received his young\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s greeting, and the delighted recognition between Guy, Bustle,\r\nand Deloraine. Guy had no attention for anything else till he had heard\r\nhow they had prospered on the journey; and then he turned to claim\r\nhis friend\xe2\x80\x99s admiration for the beautiful chestnut, his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirthday present. The ladies admired with earnestness that compensated\r\nfor want of knowledge, the gentlemen with greater science and\r\ndiscrimination; indeed, Philip, as a connoisseur, could not but, for the\r\nsake of his own reputation, discover something to criticise. Guy\xe2\x80\x99s brows\r\ndrew together again, and his eyes glanced as if he was much inclined\r\nto resent the remarks, as attacks at once on Deloraine and on his\r\ngrandfather; but he said nothing, and presently went to the stable with\r\nMr. Edmonstone, to see about the horse\xe2\x80\x99s accommodations. Philip stood in\r\nthe hall with the ladies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I perceive you have dropped the title already,\xe2\x80\x99 observed he to\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, replying for her daughter, \xe2\x80\x98it seemed to\r\ngive him pain by reminding him of his loss, and he was so strange and\r\nforlorn just at first, that we were glad to do what we could to make him\r\nfeel himself more at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you get on pretty well now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe reply was in chorus with variations--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, excellently!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is so entertaining,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He sings so beautifully,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is so right-minded,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So very well informed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\nThen it all began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He plays chess so well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bustle is such a dear dog,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is so attentive to Charlie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, going into the\r\ndrawing-room to her son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa says he will make up for the faults of all his ancestors,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His music! oh, his music!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98you really should learn to like\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Learn, impertinent little puss?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98why should I\r\nnot like him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was sure you would try,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, impressively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it hard?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98But, oh, Philip! you could not help liking his\r\nsinging.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never heard such a splendid voice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98so clear and\r\npowerful, and yet so wonderfully sweet in the low soft notes. And a very\r\nfine ear: he has a real talent for music.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! inherited, poor fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, compassionately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you pity him for it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you forget?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I would not advise you to make much of\r\nthis talent in public; it is too much a badge of his descent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma did not think so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98She thought it a pity he should not\r\nlearn regularly, with such a talent; so the other day, when Mr. Radford\r\nwas giving us a lesson, she asked Guy just to sing up and down the\r\nscale. I never saw anything so funny as old Mr Radford\xe2\x80\x99s surprise,\r\nit was almost like the music lesson in \xe2\x80\x9cLa Figlia del Reggimento\xe2\x80\x9d; he\r\nstarted, and looked at Guy, and seemed in a perfect transport, and now\r\nGuy is to take regular lessons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But do you really mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98that if your mother had been a\r\nmusician\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and you had inherited her talent, that you would be\r\nashamed of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98I am equally far from\r\nguessing what I should do if my mother had been anything but what she\r\nwas, as from guessing what I should do if I had a talent for music.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone here called her daughters to get ready for their walk,\r\nas she intended to go to East-hill, and they might as well walk with\r\nPhilip as far as their roads lay together.\r\n\r\nPhilip and Laura walked on by themselves, a little in advance of the\r\nothers. Laura was very anxious to arrive at a right understanding of her\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure there is much to like in him,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is; but is it the highest praise to say there is much to like?\r\nPeople are not so cautious when they accept a man in toto.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, do you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s answer was--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98He who the lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelp has nurst,\r\n                   At home with fostering hand,\r\n                   Finds it a gentle thing at first,\r\n                   Obedient to command,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think him a lion\xe2\x80\x99s whelp?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I saw the lion just now in his flashing eyes and contracted\r\nbrow. There is an impatience of advice, a vehemence of manner that I\r\ncan hardly deem satisfactory. I do not speak from prejudice, for I think\r\nhighly of his candour, warmth of heart, and desire to do right; but from\r\nall I have seen, I should not venture as yet to place much dependence on\r\nhis steadiness of character or command of temper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems to have been very fond of his grandfather, in spite of his\r\nseverity. He is but just beginning to brighten up a little.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; his disposition is very affectionate,--almost a misfortune to one\r\nso isolated from family ties. He showed remarkably well at Redclyffe,\r\nthe other day; boyish of course, and without much self-command, but very\r\namiably. It is very well for him that he is removed from thence, for\r\nall the people idolize him to such a degree that they could not fail to\r\nspoil him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be a great pity if he went wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Great, for he has many admirable qualities, but still they are just\r\nwhat persons are too apt to fancy compensation for faults. I never\r\nheard that any of his family, except perhaps that unhappy old Hugh,\r\nwere deficient in frankness and generosity, and therefore these do not\r\nsatisfy me. Observe, I am not condemning him; I wish to be perfectly\r\njust; all I say is, that I do not trust him till I have seen him tried.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura did not answer, she was disappointed; yet there was a justice and\r\nguardedness in what Philip said, that made it impossible to gainsay\r\nit, and she was pleased with his confidence. She thought how cool and\r\nprudent he was, and how grieved she should be if Guy justified his\r\ndoubts; and so they walked on in such silence as is perhaps the\r\nstrongest proof of intimacy. She was the first to speak, led to do so\r\nby an expression of sadness about her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. \xe2\x80\x98What are you\r\nthinking of, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Locksley Hall. There is nonsense, there is affectation in that,\r\nLaura, there is scarcely poetry, but there is power, for there is\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Locksley Hall! I thought you were at Stylehurst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I was, but the one brings the other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose you went to Stylehurst while you were at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s? Did\r\nMargaret take you there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Margaret? Not she; she is too much engaged with her book-club, and her\r\nsoir\xc3\xa9es, and her societies of every sort and kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you get on with the Doctor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw as little of him as I could, and was still more convinced that he\r\ndoes not know what conversation is. Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 Philip gave a deep sigh. \xe2\x80\x98No;\r\nthe only thing to be done at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s is to walk across the moors\r\nto Stylehurst. It is a strange thing to leave that tumult of gossip, and\r\nnovelty, and hardness, and to enter on that quiet autumnal old world,\r\nwith the yellow leaves floating silently down, just as they used to do,\r\nand the atmosphere of stillness round the green churchyard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gossip!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Laura.\xe2\x80\x99 Surely not with Margaret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Literary, scientific gossip is worse than gossip in a primary sense,\r\nwithout pretension.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you had Stylehurst to go to. How was the old sexton\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well; trotting about on her pattens as merrily as ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you go into the garden?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s ivy has entirely covered the south wall, and the acacia is\r\nso tall and spreading, that I longed to have the pruning of it. Old Will\r\nkeeps everything in its former state.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey talked on of the old home, till the stern bitter look of regret and\r\ncensure had faded from his brow, and given way to a softened melancholy\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\n     A fig for all dactyls, a fig for all spondees,\r\n     A fig for all dunces and dominie grandees.\r\n                                         --SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How glad I am!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy, entering the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wherefore?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought I was too late, and I am very glad to find no one arrived,\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone not come down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I lost my way on the top of the down; I fancied some one told me there\r\nwas a view of the sea to be had there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And can\xe2\x80\x99t you exist without a view of the sea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy laughed. \xe2\x80\x98Everything looks so dull--it is as if the view was dead or\r\nimprisoned--walled up by wood and hill, and wanting that living ripple,\r\nheaving and struggling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your fine rocks?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you could see the Shag stone,--a great island mass, sloping on\r\none side, precipitous on the other, with the spray dashing on it. If you\r\nsee it from ever so far off, there is still that white foam coming and\r\ngoing--a glancing speck, like the light in an eye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hark! a carriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The young man and the young man\xe2\x80\x99s companion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98What would any one suppose Mr. Thorndale to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not Philip\xe2\x80\x99s valet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98if it is true that no man is a hero\r\nto his \xe2\x80\x9cvalley-de-sham\xe2\x80\x9d; whereas, what is not Philip to the Honourable\r\nJames Thorndale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip, Alexander, and Bucephalus into the bargain,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Amy,\r\nin her demure, frightened whisper, sending all but Laura into a fit of\r\nlaughter, the harder to check because the steps of the parties concerned\r\nwere heard approaching.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorndale was a quiet individual, one of those of whom there is\r\nleast to be said, so complete a gentleman that it would have been an\r\ninsult, to call him gentleman-like; agreeable and clever rather than\r\notherwise, good-looking, with a high-bred air about him, so that it\r\nalways seemed strange that he did not make more impression.\r\n\r\nA ring at the front-door almost immediately followed their arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Encore?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Philip, looking at Laura with a sort of displeased\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunately, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, drawing aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s family parties,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I wish I had not\r\nbrought Thorndale. Laura, what is to be done to prevent the tittering\r\nthat always takes place when Amy and those Harpers are together?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some game?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. He signed approval; but she had time to say no\r\nmore, for her father and mother came down, and some more guests entered.\r\n\r\nIt was just such a party that continually grew up at Hollywell, for\r\nMr. Edmonstone was so fond of inviting, that his wife never knew in the\r\nmorning how many would assemble at her table in the evening. But she was\r\nused to it, and too good a manager even to be called so. She liked to\r\nsee her husband enjoy himself in his good-natured, open-hearted way. The\r\nchange was good for Charles, and thus it did very well, and there were\r\nfew houses in the neighbourhood more popular than Hollywell.\r\n\r\nThe guests this evening were Maurice de Courcy, a wild young Irishman,\r\nall noise and nonsense, a great favourite with his cousin, Mr.\r\nEdmonstone; two Miss Harpers, daughters of the late clergyman,\r\ngood-natured, second-rate girls; Dr. Mayerne, Charles\xe2\x80\x99s kind old\r\nphysician, the friend and much-loved counsellor at Hollywell, and the\r\npresent vicar, Mr. Ross with his daughter Mary.\r\n\r\nMary Ross was the greatest friend that the Miss Edmonstones possessed,\r\nthough, she being five-and-twenty, they had not arrived at perceiving\r\nthat they were on the equal terms of youngladyhood.\r\n\r\nShe had lost her mother early, and had owed a great deal to the kindness\r\nof Mrs. Edmonstone, as she grew up among her numerous elder brothers.\r\nShe had no girlhood; she was a boy till fourteen, and then a woman, and\r\nshe was scarcely altered since the epoch of that transition, the same\r\nin likings, tastes, and duties. \xe2\x80\x98Papa\xe2\x80\x99 was all the world to her, and\r\npleasing him had much the same meaning now as then; her brothers were\r\nlike playfellows; her delights were still a lesson in Greek from papa, a\r\nschool-children\xe2\x80\x99s feast, a game at play, a new book. It was only a pity\r\nother people did not stand still too. \xe2\x80\x98Papa,\xe2\x80\x99 indeed, had never grown\r\nsensibly older since the year of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death: but her brothers\r\nwere whiskered men, with all the cares of the world, and no holidays;\r\nthe school-girls went out to service, and were as a last year\xe2\x80\x99s brood to\r\nan old hen; the very children she had fondled were young ladies, as old,\r\nto all intents and purposes, as herself, and here were even Laura and\r\nAmy Edmonstone fallen into that bad habit of growing up! though little\r\nAmy had still much of the kitten in her composition, and could play\r\nas well as Charlotte or Mary herself, when they had the garden to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nMary took great pains to amuse Charles, always walking to see him in\r\nthe worst weather, when she thought other visitors likely to fall, and\r\nchatting with him as if she was the idlest person in the world, though\r\nthe quantity she did at home and in the parish would be too amazing\r\nto be recorded. Spirited and decided, without superfluous fears and\r\nfineries, she had a firm, robust figure, and a rosy, good-natured face,\r\nwith a manner that, though perfectly feminine, had in it an air of\r\nstrength and determination.\r\n\r\nHollywell was a hamlet, two miles from the parish church of East-hill,\r\nand Mary had thus seen very little of the Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s guest, having\r\nonly been introduced to him after church on Sunday. The pleasure on\r\nwhich Charles chiefly reckoned for that evening was the talking him over\r\nwith her when the ladies came in from the dining-room. The Miss Harpers,\r\nwith his sisters, gathered round the piano, and Mrs. Edmonstone sat at\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s feet, while Mary knitted and talked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you get on well with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is one of those people who are never in the way, and yet you never\r\ncan forgot their presence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His manners are quite the pink of courtesy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98that old-school\r\ndeference and attention is very chivalrous, and sits prettily and\r\nquaintly on his high spirits and animation; I hope it will not wear\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A vain hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98At present he is like that German myth,\r\nKaspar Hauser, who lived till twenty in a cellar. It is lucky for mamma\r\nthat, in his green state, he is courtly instead of bearish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lucky for you, too, Charlie; he spoils you finely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has the rare perfection of letting me know my own mind. I never knew\r\nwhat it was to have my own way before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that your complaint, Charlie? What next?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you think I have my way, do you, Mary? That is all envy, you see,\r\nand very much misplaced. Could you guess what a conflict it is every\r\ntime I am helped up that mountain of a staircase, or the slope of\r\nmy sofa is altered? Last time Philip stayed here, every step cost an\r\nargument, till at last, through sheer exhaustion, I left myself a dead\r\nweight on his hands, to be carried up by main strength. And after all,\r\nhe is such a great, strong fellow, that I am afraid he did not mind it;\r\nso next time I _crutched_ myself down alone, and I hope that did provoke\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy is so kind that I am ashamed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98It seems\r\nas if we had brought him for the sole purpose of waiting on Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half his heart is in his horse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Never had man such\r\ndelight in the \xe2\x80\x9cbrute creation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have been his chief playfellows,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nchief of his time was spent in wandering in the woods or on the beach,\r\nwatching them and their ways.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fairly dreamt of that Elysium of his last night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98a swamp half frozen on a winter\xe2\x80\x99s night, full of wild ducks. Here,\r\nCharlotte, come and tell Mary the roll of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s pets.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte began. \xe2\x80\x98There was the sea-gull, and the hedgehog, and the fox,\r\nand the badger, and the jay, and the monkey, that he bought because it\r\nwas dying, and cured it, only it died the next winter, and a toad, and a\r\nraven, and a squirrel, and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will do, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! but Mary has not heard the names of all his dogs. And Mary, he has\r\ncured Bustle of hunting my Puss. We held them up to each other, and Puss\r\nhissed horribly, but Bustle did not mind it a bit; and the other day,\r\nwhen Charles tried to set him at her, he would not take the least\r\nnotice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, waving his hand, with a provoking mock\r\npoliteness, \xe2\x80\x98have the goodness to return to your friends.\r\n\r\nTea over, Laura proposed the game of definitions. \xe2\x80\x98You know it. Philip,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she, \xe2\x80\x98you taught us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes I learnt it of your sisters, Thorndale,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O pray let us have it. It must be charming!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Miss Harper, on\r\nthis recommendation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Definitions!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x98Dr. Johnson must be the\r\nhand for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are just the definitions not to be found in Johnson,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nThorndale. \xe2\x80\x98Our standing specimen is adversity, which may be differently\r\nexplained according to your taste, as \xe2\x80\x9ca toad with a precious jewel in\r\nits head,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe test of friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The spirit of words,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking eager and interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98though I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it sounds to me\r\npromising. Come, Maurice, define an Irishman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, don\xe2\x80\x99t let us be personal,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98I had thought of the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9chappiness\xe2\x80\x9d. We are each to write a definition on a slip of paper,\r\nthen compare them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe game was carried on with great spirit for more than an hour. It was\r\nhard to say, which made most fun, Maurice, Charles, or Guy; the last\r\nno longer a spectator, but an active contributor to the sport. When the\r\nbreak-up came, Mary and Amabel were standing over the table together,\r\ncollecting the scattered papers, and observing that it had been very\r\ngood fun. \xe2\x80\x98Some so characteristic,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98such as Maurice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndefinition of happiness,--a row at Dublin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some were very deep, though,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary; \xe2\x80\x98if it is not treason, I\r\nshould like to make out whose that other was of happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You mean this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy: \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cGleams from a brighter world, too soon\r\neclipsed or forfeited.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought it was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, but it is Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwriting. How very sad! I should not like to think so. And he was so\r\nmerry all the time! This is his, too, I see; this one about riches being\r\nthe freight for which the traveller is responsible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a great deal of character in them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98I should not\r\nhave wondered at any of us, penniless people, philosophizing in the fox\r\nand grapes style, but, for him, and at his age--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been brought up so as to make the theory of wisdom come early,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Philip, who was nearer than she thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that intended for disparagement?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked quickly.\r\n\r\nI think very highly of him; he has a great deal of sense and right\r\nfeeling,\xe2\x80\x99 was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s sedate answer; and he turned away to say some\r\nlast words to Mr. Thorndale.\r\n\r\nThe Rosses were the last to depart, Mary in cloak and clogs, while Mr.\r\nEdmonstone lamented that it was in vain to offer the carriage; and Mary\r\nlaughed, and thanked, and said the walk home with Papa was the greatest\r\nof treats in the frost and star-light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t I pity you, who always go out to dinner in a carriage!\xe2\x80\x99 were her\r\nlast words to Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98how do you like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very much, indeed. It was very pleasant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are getting into the fairy ring,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay\xe2\x80\x99 he said, smiling too; \xe2\x80\x98but it does not turn to tinsel. Would it if\r\nI saw more of it?\xe2\x80\x99 and he looked at Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be no compliment to ourselves to say so,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose tinsel or gold depends on the using,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, thoughtfully;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98there are some lumps of solid gold among those papers, I am sure, one,\r\nin particular, about a trifle. May I see that again? I mean--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98Little things\r\n                   On little wings\r\n                 Bear little souls to heaven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that was only a quotation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, turning over the definitions\r\nagain with him, and laughing at some of the most amusing; while, in the\r\nmean time, Philip went to help Laura, who was putting some books away in\r\nthe ante-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98he has thought, mind, and soul; he is no mere\r\nrattle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No indeed. Who could help seeing his superiority over Maurice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If only he does not pervert his gifts, and if it is not all talk. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like such excess of openness about his feelings; it is too like\r\ntalking for talking\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma says it in the transparency of youthfulness. You know he has\r\nnever been at school; so his thoughts come out in security of sympathy,\r\nwithout fear of being laughed at. But it is very late. Good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frost turned to rain the next morning, and the torrents streamed\r\nagainst the window, seeming to have a kind of attraction for Philip and\r\nGuy, who stood watching them.\r\n\r\nGuy wondered if the floods would be out at Redclyffe and his cousins\r\nwere interested by his description of the sudden, angry rush of the\r\nmountain streams, eddying fiercely along, bearing with them tree and\r\nrock, while the valleys became lakes, and the little mounds islets; and\r\nthe trees looked strangely out of proportion when only their branches\r\nwere visible. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! a great flood is famous fun,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98I have heard a legend of your being nearly\r\ndrowned in some flood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98I had a tolerable ducking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, tell us about it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! I have a curiosity to hear a personal experience of drowning,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles. \xe2\x80\x98Come, begin at the beginning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was standing watching the tremendous force of the stream, when I saw\r\nan unhappy old ram floating along, bleating so piteously, and making\r\nsuch absurd, helpless struggles, that I could not help pulling off my\r\ncoat and jumping in after him. It was very foolish, for the stream was\r\ntoo strong--I was two years younger then. Moreover, the beast was very\r\nheavy, and not at all grateful for any kind intentions, and I found\r\nmyself sailing off to the sea, with the prospect of a good many rocks\r\nbefore long; but just then an old tree stretched out its friendly\r\narms through the water; it stopped the sheep, and I caught hold of the\r\nbranches, and managed to scramble up, while my friend got entangled in\r\nthem with his wool\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98Omne quum Proteus pecus egit altos\r\n                                      Visere montes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nquoted Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98Ovium et summa, genus haesit ulmo,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nadded Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Ovium_,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Philip, with a face of horror. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that\r\n_O_ in _Ovis_ is short? Do anything but take liberties with Horace!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get out of the tree first, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98for at present your\r\nhistory seems likely to end with a long ohone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Triton--not Proteus--came to the rescue at last,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nlaughing; \xe2\x80\x98I could not stir, and the tree bent so frightfully with the\r\ncurrent that I expected every minute we should all go together; so I\r\nhad nothing for it but to halloo as loud as I could. No one heard but\r\nTriton, the old Newfoundland dog, who presently came swimming up, so\r\neager to help, poor fellow, that I thought he would have throttled me,\r\nor hurt himself in the branches. I took off my handkerchief and threw it\r\nto him, telling him to take it to Arnaud, who I knew would understand it\r\nas a signal of distress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he? How long had you to wait?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--it seemed long enough before a most welcome boat\r\nappeared, with some men in it, and Triton in an agony. They would never\r\nhave found me but for him, for my voice was gone; indeed the next thing\r\nI remember was lying on the grass in the park, and Markham saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir, if you do wish to throw away your life, let it be for\r\nsomething better worth saving than Farmer Holt\xe2\x80\x99s vicious old ram!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the language of the great Mr. Toots,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid you\r\ngot very wet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you the worse for it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least. I was so glad to hear it was Holt\xe2\x80\x99s! for you must\r\nknow that I had behaved very ill to Farmer Holt. I had been very angry\r\nat his beating our old hound, for, as he thought, worrying his sheep;\r\nnot that Dart ever did, though.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And was the ram saved?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and next time I saw it, it nearly knocked me down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you do it again?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you had a medal from the Humane Society,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would have been more proper for Triton.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours should have been an ovation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, cutting the o\r\nabsurdly short, and looking at Philip.\r\n\r\nLaura saw that the spirit of teasing was strong in Charles this morning\r\nand suspected that he wanted to stir up what he called the deadly\r\nfeud, and she hastened to change the conversation by saying, \xe2\x80\x98You quite\r\nimpressed Guy with your translation of Fra Cristoforo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed I must thank you for recommending the book,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98how\r\nbeautiful it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you entered into it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98it has every quality that\r\na fiction ought to have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never read anything equal to the repentance of the nameless man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he your favourite character?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, looking at him\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no--of course not--though he is so grand that one thinks most about\r\nhim, but no one can be cared about as much as Lucia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lucia! She never struck me as more than a well-painted peasant girl,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, indignantly; then, controlling himself, he continued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She pretends to no more than she is, but she shows the beauty of\r\ngoodness in itself in a--a--wonderful way. And think of the power of\r\nthose words of hers over that gloomy, desperate man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your sympathy with the Innominato again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. Every subject\r\nseemed to excite Guy to a dangerous extent, as Laura thought, and she\r\nturned to Philip to ask if he would not read to them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I brought this book on purpose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I wished to read you a\r\ndescription of that print from Raffaelle--you know it--the Madonna di\r\nSan Sisto?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The one you brought to show us?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98with the two little\r\nangels?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, here is the description,\xe2\x80\x99 and he began to read--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dwell on the form of the Child, more than human in grandeur, seated on\r\nthe arms of the Blessed Virgin as on an august throne. Note the tokens\r\nof divine grace, His ardent eyes, what a spirit, what a countenance is\r\nHis; yet His very resemblance to His mother denotes sufficiently that He\r\nis of us and takes care for us. Beneath are two figures adoring, each in\r\ntheir own manner. On one side is a pontiff, on the other a virgin each\r\na most sweet and solemn example, the one of aged, the other of maidenly\r\npiety and reverence. Between, are two winged boys, evidently presenting\r\na wonderful pattern of childlike piety. Their eyes, indeed, are not\r\nturned towards the Virgin, but both in face and gesture, they show how\r\ncareless of themselves they are in the presence of God.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll were struck by the description. Guy did not speak at first, but\r\nthe solemn expression of his face showed how he felt its power and\r\nreverence. Philip asked if they would like to hear more, and Charles\r\nassented: Amy worked, Laura went on with her perspective, and Guy sat\r\nby her side, making concentric circles with her compasses, or when she\r\nwanted them he tormented her parallel ruler, or cut the pencils, never\r\nletting his fingers rest except at some high or deep passage, or when\r\nsome interesting discussion arose. All were surprised when luncheon time\r\narrived; Charles held out his hand for the book; it was given with a\r\nslight smile, and he exclaimed\xe2\x80\x99 Latin! I thought you were translating.\r\nIs it your own property?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it very tough? I would read it, if any one would read it with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean me?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I should like it very much, but you have\r\nseen how little Latin I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the very thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98that Ovis of yours was music; I\r\nwould have made you a Knight of the Golden Fleece on the spot. Tutors I\r\ncould get by shoals, but a fellow-dunce is inestimable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a bargain, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98if Philip has done with the book and\r\nwill lend it to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe luncheon bell rang, and they all adjourned to the dining-room. Mr.\r\nEdmonstone came in when luncheon was nearly over, rejoicing that his\r\nletters were done, but then he looked disconsolately from the window,\r\nand pitied the weather. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing for it but billiards. People might say\r\nit was nonsense to have a billiard-table in such a house, but for his\r\npart he found there was no getting through a wet day without them.\r\nPhilip must beat him as usual, and Guy might have one of the young\r\nladies to make a fourth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not play--eh?\xe2\x80\x99 Well, we will teach you in the spinning of a ball, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have my little Amy to help me against you and Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Guy, colouring, \xe2\x80\x98I am under a promise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! Eh? What? Your grandfather? He could see no harm in such play as\r\nthis. For nothing, you understand. You did not suppose I meant anything\r\nelse?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, of course not,\xe2\x80\x99 eagerly replied Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but it is impossible for me\r\nto play, thank you. I have promised never even to look on at a game at\r\nbilliards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor man, he had too much reason.\xe2\x80\x99 uttered Mr. Edmonstone to\r\nhimself, but catching a warning look from his wife, he became suddenly\r\nsilent. Guy, meanwhile, sat looking lost in sad thoughts, till, rousing\r\nhimself, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me prevent you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone needed but little persuasion, and carried Philip off to\r\nthe billiard-table in the front hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I am so glad!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte, who had, within the last week,\r\nlearnt Guy\xe2\x80\x99s value as a playfellow. \xe2\x80\x98Now you will never go to those\r\nstupid billiards, but I shall have you always, every rainy day. Come and\r\nhave a real good game at ball on the stairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe already had hold of his hand, and would have dragged him off at\r\nonce, had he not waited to help Charles back to his sofa; and in the\r\nmean time she tried in vain to persuade her more constant playmate,\r\nAmabel, to join the game. Poor little Amy regretted the being obliged to\r\nrefuse, as she listened to the merry sounds and bouncing balls, sighing\r\nmore than once at having turned into a grown-up young lady; while Philip\r\nobserved to Laura, who was officiating as billiard-marker, that Guy was\r\nstill a mere boy.\r\n\r\nThe fates favoured Amy at last for about half after three, the billiards\r\nwere interrupted, and Philip, pronouncing the rain to be almost over,\r\ninvited Guy to take a walk, and they set out in a very gray wet mist,\r\nwhile Charlotte and Amy commenced a vigorous game at battledore and\r\nshuttle-cock.\r\n\r\nThe gray mist had faded into twilight, and twilight into something like\r\nnight, when Charles was crossing the hall, with the aid of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s arm,\r\nCharlotte carrying the crutch behind him, and Mrs. Edmonstone helping\r\nLaura with her perspective apparatus, all on their way to dress for\r\ndinner; the door opened and in came the two Morvilles. Guy, without,\r\neven stopping to take off his great coat, ran at once up-stairs, and\r\nthe next moment the door of his room was shut with a bang that shook the\r\nhouse, and made them all start and look at Philip for explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Redclyffe temper,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, coolly, with a half-smile curling his short\r\nupper lip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you been doing to him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing. At least nothing worthy of such ire. I only entered on the\r\nsubject of his Oxford life, and advised him to prepare for it, for his\r\neducation has as yet been a mere farce. He used to go two or three days\r\nin the week to one Potts, a self-educated genius--a sort of superior\r\nwriting-master at the Moorworth commercial school. Of course, though it\r\nis no fault of his, poor fellow, he is hardly up to the fifth form, and\r\nhe must make the most of his time, if he is not to be plucked. I set\r\nall this before him as gently as I could, for I knew with whom I had to\r\ndeal, yet you see how it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did he say?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He said nothing; so far I give him credit; but he strode on furiously\r\nfor the last half mile, and this explosion is the finale. I am very\r\nsorry for him, poor boy; I beg no further notice may be taken of it.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want an arm, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Charles, with a little surliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better. It really is too much for Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, making a\r\nmove as if to take possession of him, as he arrived at the foot of the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like the camellia, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied; and taking his other crutch\r\nfrom Charlotte, he began determinedly to ascend without assistance,\r\nresolved to keep Philip a prisoner below him as long as he could, and\r\nenjoying the notion of chafing him by the delay. Certainly teasing\r\nPhilip was a dear delight to Charles, though it was all on trust, as, if\r\nhe succeeded, his cousin never betrayed his annoyance by look or sign.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of an hour after, there was a knock at the\r\ndressing-room door. \xe2\x80\x98Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking up from her\r\nletter-writing, and Guy made his appearance, looking very downcast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am come,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98to ask pardon for the disturbance I made just\r\nnow. I was so foolish as to be irritated at Philip\xe2\x80\x99s manner, when he was\r\ngiving me some good advice, and I am very sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has happened to your lip?\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe put his handkerchief to it. \xe2\x80\x98Is it bleeding still? It is a trick\r\nof mine to bite my lip when I am vexed. It seems to help to keep down\r\nwords. There! I have given myself a mark of this hateful outbreak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe looked very unhappy, more so, Mrs. Edmonstone thought, than the\r\nactual offence required. \xe2\x80\x98You have only failed in part,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwas a victory to keep down words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The feeling is the _thing_,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98besides, I showed it plainly\r\nenough, without speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not easy to take advice from one so little your elder,\xe2\x80\x99 began\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, but he interrupted her. \xe2\x80\x98It was not the advice. That\r\nwas very good; I--\xe2\x80\x99 but he spoke with an effort,--\xe2\x80\x98I am obliged to\r\nhim. It was--no, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say what,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, his eyes kindling, then\r\nchanging in a moment to a sorrowful, resolute tone, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, but I _will_,\r\nand then I shall make myself thoroughly ashamed. It was his veiled\r\nassumption of superiority, his contempt for all I have been taught.\r\nJust as if he had not every right to despise me, with his talent and\r\nscholarship, after such egregious mistakes as I had made in the morning.\r\nI gave him little reason to think highly of my attainments; but let him\r\nslight me as much as he pleases, he must not slight those who taught me.\r\nIt was not Mr. Potts\xe2\x80\x99 fault.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven the name could not spoil the spirited sound of the speech, and Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone was full of sympathy. \xe2\x80\x98You must remember,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that in\r\nthe eyes of a man brought up at public school, nothing compensates for\r\nthe want of the regular classical education. I have no doubt it was very\r\nprovoking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be excused, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh I am grieved; for\r\nI thought the worst of my temper had been subdued. After all that has\r\npassed--all I felt--I thought it impossible. Is there no hope for--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe covered his face with his hands, then recovering and turning to Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, he said, \xe2\x80\x98It is encroaching too much on your kindness to\r\ncome here and trouble you with my confessions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98Remember how we agreed that you\r\nshould come to me like one of my own children. And, indeed, I do not see\r\nwhy you need grieve in this despairing way, for you almost overcame the\r\nfit of anger; and perhaps you were off your guard because the trial came\r\nin an unexpected way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It did, it did,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, eagerly; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t, mind being told point\r\nblank that I am a dunce, but that Mr. Potts--nay, by implication--my\r\ngrandfather should be set at nought in that cool--But here I am again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he, checking himself in the midst of his vehemence; \xe2\x80\x98he did not\r\nmean that, of course. I have no one to blame but myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98that if you always treat your\r\nfailings in this way, you must subdue them at last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all failing, and resolving, and failing again!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but the failures become slighter and less frequent, and the end is\r\nvictory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The end victory!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Guy, in a musing tone, as he stood leaning\r\nagainst the mantelshelf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, to all who persevere and seek for help,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Edmonstone;\r\nand he raised his eyes and fixed them on her with an earnest look that\r\nsurprised her, for it was almost as if the hope came home to him\r\nas something new. At that moment, however, she was called away, and\r\ndirectly after a voice in the next room exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Are you there, Guy?\r\nI want an arm!\xe2\x80\x99 while he for the first time perceived that Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor was ajar.\r\n\r\nCharles thought all this a great fuss about nothing, indeed he was glad\r\nto find there was anyone who had no patience with Philip; and in his\r\nusual mischievous manner, totally reckless of the fearful evil of\r\ninterfering with the influence for good which it was to be hoped that\r\nPhilip might exert over Guy, he spoke thus: \xe2\x80\x98I begin to think the world\r\nmust be more docile than I have been disposed to give it credit for. How\r\na certain cousin of ours has escaped numerous delicate hints to mind his\r\nown business is to me one of the wonders of the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one better deserves that his advice should be followed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nwith some constraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An additional reason against it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Plague on that bell!\r\nI meant to have broken through your formalities and had a candid opinion\r\nof Don Philip before it rang.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I am glad of it; I could hardly have given you a candid opinion\r\njust at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles was vexed; but he consoled himself by thinking that Guy did not\r\nyet feel himself out of his leading-strings, and was still on his good\r\nbehaviour. After such a flash as this there was no fear, but there was\r\nthat in him which would create mischief and disturbance enough. Charles\r\nwas well principled at the bottom, and would have shrunk with horror had\r\nit been set before him how dangerous might be the effect of destroying\r\nthe chance of a friendship between Guy and the only person whose\r\nguidance was likely to be beneficial to him; but his idle, unoccupied\r\nlife, and habit of only thinking of things as they concerned his\r\nimmediate amusement, made him ready to do anything for the sake of\r\nopposition to Philip, and enjoy the vague idea of excitement to be\r\nderived from anxiety about his father\xe2\x80\x99s ward, whom at the same time he\r\nregarded with increased liking as he became certain that what he called\r\nthe Puritan spirit was not native to him.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time, Guy was as silent as on his first arrival, and there\r\nwould have been very little conversation had not the other gentleman\r\ntalked politics, Philip leading the discussion to bear upon the duties\r\nand prospects of landed proprietors, and dwelling on the extent of\r\ntheir opportunities for doing good. He tried to get Guy\xe2\x80\x99s attention, by\r\nspeaking of Redclyffe, of the large circle influenced by the head of\r\nthe Morville family, and of the hopes entertained by Lord Thorndale\r\nthat this power would prove a valuable support to the rightful cause.\r\nHe spoke in vain; the young heir of Redclyffe made answers as brief,\r\nabsent, and indifferent, as if all this concerned him no more than the\r\nEmperor of Morocco, and Philip, mentally pronouncing him sullen, turned\r\nto address himself to Laura.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ladies had left the dining-room, Guy roused himself, and\r\nbegan by saying to his guardian that he was afraid he was very deficient\r\nin classical knowledge; that he found he must work hard before going to\r\nOxford; and asked whether there was any tutor in the neighbourhood to\r\nwhom he could apply.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone opened his eyes, as much amazed as if Guy had asked if\r\nthere was any executioner in the neighbourhood who could cut off his\r\nhead. Philip was no less surprised, but he held his peace, thinking it\r\nwas well Guy bad sense enough to propose it voluntarily, as he would\r\nhave suggested it to his uncle as soon as there was an opportunity of\r\ndoing so in private. As soon as Mr. Edmonstone had recollected himself,\r\nand pronounced it to be exceedingly proper, &c., they entered into a\r\ndiscussion on the neighbouring curates, and came at last to a resolution\r\nthat Philip should see whether Mr. Lascelles, a curate of Broadstone,\r\nand an old schoolfellow of his own, would read with Guy a few hours in\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nAfter this was settled, Guy looked relieved, though he was not himself\r\nall the evening, and sat in his old corner between the plants and the\r\nwindow, where he read a grave book, instead of talking, singing, or\r\nfinishing his volume of \xe2\x80\x98Ten Thousand a Year.\xe2\x80\x99 Charlotte was all this\r\ntime ill at ease. She looked from Guy to Philip, from Philip to Guy; she\r\nshut her mouth as if she was forming some great resolve, then coloured,\r\nand looked confused, rushing into the conversation with something more\r\nmal-apropos than usual, as if on purpose to appear at her ease. At last,\r\njust before her bed-time, when the tea was coming in, Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nengaged with that, Laura reading, Amy clearing Charles\xe2\x80\x99s little table,\r\nand Philip helping Mr. Edmonstone to unravel the confused accounts\r\nof the late cheating bailiff, Guy suddenly found her standing by him,\r\nperusing his face with all the power of her great blue eyes. She started\r\nas he looked up, and put her face into Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s great myrtle as if she\r\nwould make it appear that she was smelling to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and the sound of his voice made her speak,\r\nbut in a frightened, embarrassed whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy--Guy--Oh! I beg your pardon, but I wanted to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wanted to make sure that you are not angry with Philip. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to keep up the feud, do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Feud?--I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, too much in earnest to be diverted with\r\nher lecture. \xe2\x80\x98I am very much obliged to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you really?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, her head a little on one side. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nthought he had been scolding you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nScolding was so very inappropriate to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s calm, argumentative way\r\nof advising, that it became impossible not to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not scolding, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98You are too nearly grown up for\r\nthat, but telling you to learn, and being tiresome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was so foolish as to be provoked at first,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but I hope\r\nI have thought better of it, and am going to act upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte opened her eyes wider than ever, but in the midst of her\r\namazement Mrs. Edmonstone called to Guy to quit his leafy screen and\r\ncome to tea.\r\n\r\nPhilip was to return to Broadstone the next day, and as Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nhad some errands there that would occupy her longer than Charles liked\r\nto wait in the carriage, it was settled that Philip should drive her\r\nthere in the pony phaeton, and Guy accompany them and drive back, thus\r\nhaving an opportunity of seeing Philip\xe2\x80\x99s print of the \xe2\x80\x98Madonna di San\r\nSisto,\xe2\x80\x99 returning some calls, and being introduced to Mr. Lascelles,\r\nwhilst she was shopping. They appointed an hour and place of meeting,\r\nand kept to it, after which Mrs. Edmonstone took Guy with her to call on\r\nMrs. Deane, the wife of the colonel.\r\n\r\nIt was currently believed among the young Edmonstones that Mamma and\r\nMrs. Deane never met without talking over Mr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s good qualities,\r\nand the present visit proved no exception. Mrs. Deane, a kind,\r\nopen-hearted, elderly lady was very fond of Mr. Morville, and proud\r\nof him as a credit to the regiment; and she told several traits of his\r\nexcellent judgment, kindness of heart, and power of leading to the right\r\ncourse. Mrs. Edmonstone listened, and replied with delight; and no\r\nless pleasure and admiration were seen reflected in her young friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nradiant face.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s first question, as they set out on their homeward\r\ndrive, was, whether they had seen Mr. Lascelles?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98I am to begin to morrow, and go to him every Monday\r\nand Thursday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is prompt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I have no time to lose; besides I have been leading too smooth\r\na life with you. I want something unpleasant to keep me in order.\r\nSomething famously horrid,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated he, smacking the whip with a\r\nrelish, as if he would have applied that if he could have found nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think you live too smoothly at Hollywell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nhardly able, with all her respect for his good impulses, to help\r\nlaughing at this strange boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Happy, thoughtless, vehement; that is what your kindness makes\r\nme. Was it not a proof, that I must needs fly out at such a petty\r\nprovocation?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not have thought it such a very exciting life; certainly not\r\nsuch as is usually said to lead to thoughtlessness; and we have been\r\neven quieter than usual since you came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what stuff I am made of,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, gravely,\r\nthough smiling; \xe2\x80\x98your own home party is enough to do me harm; it is so\r\nexceedingly pleasant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pleasant things do not necessarily do harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to you; not to people who are not easily unsettled; but when I\r\ngo up-stairs, after a talking, merry evening, such as the night before\r\nlast, I find that I have enjoyed it too much; I am all abroad! I can\r\nhardly fix my thoughts, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do, since here I must\r\nbe, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t either be silent, or sit up in my own room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, smiling; \xe2\x80\x98there are duties of society which\r\nyou owe even to us dangerous people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no: don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me. The fault is in myself. If it was\r\nnot for that, I could learn nothing but good,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, speaking very\r\neagerly, distressed at her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I understand you,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, marvelling at the serious,\r\nascetic temper, coupled with the very high animal spirits. \xe2\x80\x98For your\r\ncomfort, I believe the unsettled feeling you complain of is chiefly the\r\neffect of novelty. You have led so very retired a life, that a lively\r\nfamily party is to you what dissipation would be to other people: and,\r\nas you must meet with the world some time or other, it is better the\r\nfirst encounter with should be in this comparatively innocent form. Go\r\non watching yourself, and it will do you no harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYes, but if I find it does me harm? It would be cowardly to run away,\r\nand resistance should be from within. Yet, on the other hand, there is\r\nthe duty of giving up, wrenching oneself from all that has temptation in\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98that has no temptation in it;\r\nbut I should think the rule was plain. If a duty such as that of living\r\namong us for the present, and making yourself moderately agreeable,\r\ninvolves temptations, they must be met and battled from within. In the\r\nsame way, your position in society, with all its duties, could not be\r\nlaid aside because it is full of trial. Those who do such things are\r\nfainthearted, and fail in trust in Him who fixed their station, and\r\nfinds room for them to deny themselves in the trivial round and common\r\ntask. It is pleasure involving no duty that should be given up, if we\r\nfind it liable to lead us astray.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy, musingly; \xe2\x80\x98and this reading comes naturally, and\r\nis just what I wanted to keep the pleasant things from getting a full\r\nhold of me. I ought to have thought of it sooner, instead of dawdling a\r\nwhole month in idleness. Then all this would not have happened. I hope\r\nit will be very tough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have no great love for Latin and Greek?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x98to be sure I delight in Homer and the\r\nGeorgics, and plenty more. What splendid things there are in these old\r\nfellows! But, I never liked the drudgery part of the affair; and now if\r\nI am to be set to work to be accurate, and to get up all the grammar and\r\nthe Greek roots, it will be horrid enough in all conscience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe groaned as deeply as if he had not been congratulating himself just\r\nbefore on the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was your tutor?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Potts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98He is a very clever man; he had a common\r\ngrammar-school education, but he struggled on--taught himself a great\r\ndeal--and at last thought it great promotion to be a teacher at the\r\nCommercial Academy, as they call it, at Moorworth, where Markham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnephews went to school. He is very clever, I assure you, and very\r\npatient of the hard, wearing life he must have of it there; and oh! so\r\nenjoying a new book, or an afternoon to himself. When I was about eight\r\nor nine, I began with him, riding into Moorworth three times in a week;\r\nand I have gone on ever since. I am sure he has done the best he could\r\nfor me; and he made the readings very pleasant by his own enjoyment. If\r\nPhilip had known the difficulties that man has struggled through, and\r\nhis beautiful temper, persevering in doing his best and being contented,\r\nI am sure he could never have spoken contemptuously of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure he would not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98all he meant was,\r\nthat a person without a university education cannot tell what the\r\nrequirements are to which a man must come up in these days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98how I wished Mr. Potts had been there to\r\nhave enjoyed listening to Philip and Mr. Lascelles discussing some\r\nnew Lexicon, digging down for roots of words, and quoting passages of\r\nobscure Greek poets at such a rate, that if my eyes had been shut I\r\ncould have thought them two withered old students in spectacles and\r\nsnuff-coloured coats.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip was in his element.\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Guy, with animation, \xe2\x80\x98the more I hear and see of\r\nPhilip, the more I wonder. What a choice collection of books he has--so\r\nmany of them school prizes, and how beautifully bound!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! that is one of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar ways. With all his prudence\r\nand his love of books, I believe he would not buy one unless he had a\r\nreasonable prospect of being able to dress it handsomely. Did you see\r\nthe print?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes that I did. What glorious loveliness! There is nothing that does\r\nit justice but the description in the lecture. Oh I forgot, you have\r\nnot heard it. You must let me read it to you by and by. Those two little\r\nangels, what faces they have. Perfect innocence--one full of reasoning,\r\nthe other of unreasoning adoration!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see it!\xe2\x80\x99 suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98I see what you are like\r\nin one of your looks, not by any means, in all--it is to the larger of\r\nthose two angels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very seldom, I should guess,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; and sinking his voice, as if\r\nhe was communicating a most painful fact, he added, \xe2\x80\x98My real likeness\r\nis old Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s portrait at home. But what were we saying? Oh! about\r\nPhilip. How nice those stories were of Mrs. Deane\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very fond of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To have won so much esteem and admiration, already from strangers, with\r\nno prejudice in his favour.--It must be entirely his own doing; and well\r\nit may! Every time one hears of him, something comes out to make\r\nhim seem more admirable. You are laughing at me, and I own it is\r\npresumptuous to praise; but I did not mean to praise, only to admire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like very much to hear my nephew praised; I was only smiling at your\r\nenthusiastic way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only wonder I am not more enthusiastic,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is\r\nhis plain good sense that drives away that sort of feeling, for he is\r\nas near heroism in the way of self-sacrifice as a man can be in these\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Philip! if disappointment can make a hero, it has fallen to his\r\nshare. Ah! Guy, you are brightening and looking like one of my young\r\nladies in hopes of a tale of true love crossed, but it was only love of\r\na sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sister for whom he gave up so much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, his sister Margaret. She was eight or nine years older, very\r\nhandsome, very clever, a good deal like him--a pattern elder sister;\r\nindeed, she brought him up in great part after his mother died, and he\r\nwas devoted to her. I do believe it made the sacrifice of his prospects\r\nquite easy to him, to know it was for her sake, that she would live\r\non at Stylehurst, and the change be softened to her. Then came Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nillness, and that lead to the marriage with Dr. Henley. It was just what\r\nno one could object to; he is a respectable man in full practice, with a\r\nlarge income; but he is much older than she is, not her equal in mind or\r\ncultivation, and though I hardly like to say so, not at all a religious\r\nman. At any rate, Margaret Morville was one of the last people one could\r\nbear to see marry for the sake of an establishment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could her brother do nothing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He expostulated with all his might; but at nineteen he could do little\r\nwith a determined sister of twenty-seven; and the very truth and power\r\nof his remonstrance must have made it leave a sting. Poor fellow, I\r\nbelieve he suffered terribly--just as he had lost Fanny, too, which he\r\nfelt very deeply, for she was a very sweet creature, and he was very\r\nfond of her. It was like losing both sisters and home at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he not just been staying with Mrs. Henley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. There was never any coolness, as people call it. He is the one\r\nthing she loves and is proud of. They always correspond, and he often\r\nstays with her; but he owns to disliking the Doctor, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nhe has much comfort in Margaret herself, for he always comes back more\r\ngrave and stern than he went. Her house, with all her good wishes, can\r\nbe no home to him; and so we try to make Hollywell supply the place of\r\nStylehurst as well as we can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How glad he must be to have you to comfort him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip? Oh no. He was always reserved; open to no one but Margaret, not\r\neven to his father, and since her marriage he has shut himself up within\r\nhimself more than ever. It has, at least I think it is this that has\r\ngiven him a severity, an unwillingness to trust, which I believe is\r\noften the consequence of a great disappointment either in love or in\r\nfriendship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for telling me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy: \xe2\x80\x98I shall understand him better,\r\nand look up to him more. Oh! it is a cruel thing to find that what one\r\nloves is, or has not been, all one thought. What must he not have gone\r\nthrough!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was well pleased to have given so much assistance to\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s sincere desire to become attached to his cousin, one of the most\r\nfavourable signs in the character that was winning so much upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\n     A cloud was o\xe2\x80\x99er my childhood\xe2\x80\x99s dream,\r\n           I sat in solitude;\r\n     I know not how--I know not why,\r\n     But round my soul all drearily\r\n           There was a silent shroud.\r\n                   --THOUGHTS IN PAST YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was anxious to hear Mr. Lascelle\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of his pupil,\r\nand in time she learnt that he thought Sir Guy had very good abilities,\r\nand a fair amount of general information; but that his classical\r\nknowledge was far from accurate, and mathematics had been greatly\r\nneglected. He had been encouraged to think his work done when he had\r\ngathered the general meaning of a passage, or translated it into English\r\nverse, spirited and flowing, but often further from the original than he\r\nor his tutor could perceive. He had never been taught to work, at least\r\nas other boys study, and great application would be requisite to bring\r\nhis attainments to a level with those of far less clever boys educated\r\nat a public school.\r\n\r\nMr. Lascelles told him so at first; but as there were no reflections on\r\nhis grandfather, or on Mr. Potts, Guy\xe2\x80\x99s lip did not suffer, and he\r\nonly asked how many hours a day he ought to read. \xe2\x80\x98Three,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMr. Lascelles, with a due regard to a probable want of habits of\r\napplication; but then, remembering how much was undone, he added, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it ought to be four or more, if possible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Four it _shall_ be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98five if I can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis whole strength of will was set to accomplish these four hours,\r\ntaking them before and after breakfast, working hard all the morning\r\ntill the last hour before luncheon, when he came to read the lectures on\r\npoetry with Charles. Here, for the first time, it appeared that Charles\r\nhad so entirely ceased to consider him as company, as to domineer over\r\nhim like his own family.\r\n\r\nUsed as Guy had been to an active out-of-doors life, and now turned\r\nback to authors he had read long ago, to fight his way through the\r\nconstruction of their language, not excusing himself one jot of the\r\ndifficulty, nor turning aside from one mountain over which his own\r\nefforts could carry him, he found his work as tough and tedious as he\r\ncould wish or fear, and by the end of the morning was thoroughly fagged.\r\nThen would have been the refreshing time for recreation in that pleasant\r\nidling-place, the Hollywell drawing-room. Any other time of day would\r\nhave suited Charles as well for the reading, but he liked to take the\r\nhour at noon, and never perceived that this made all the difference to\r\nhis friend of a toil or a pleasure. Now and then Guy gave tremendous\r\nyawns; and once when Charles told him he was very stupid, proposed a\r\ndifferent time; but as Charles objected, he yielded as submissively as\r\nthe rest of the household were accustomed to do.\r\n\r\nTo watch Guy was one of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s chief amusements, and he rejoiced\r\ngreatly in the prospect of hearing his history of his first\r\ndinner-party. Mr., Mrs. and Miss Edmonstone, and Sir Guy Morville, were\r\ninvited to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow. Mr. Edmonstone was delighted\r\nas usual with any opportunity of seeing his neighbours; Guy looked as\r\nif he did not know whether he liked the notion or not; Laura told him it\r\nwould be very absurd and stupid, but there would be some good music, and\r\nCharles ordered her to say no more, that he might have the account, the\r\nnext morning, from a fresh and unprejudiced mind.\r\n\r\nThe next morning\xe2\x80\x99s question was, of course, \xe2\x80\x98How did you like your\r\nparty?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, it was great fun.\xe2\x80\x99 Guy\xe2\x80\x99s favourite answer was caught up in the\r\nmidst, as Laura replied, \xe2\x80\x98It was just what parties always are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, let us have the history. Who handed who in to dinner? I hope Guy\r\nhad Mrs. Brownlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; we had both the honourables.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not Philip!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98the fidus Achetes was without his pious Aeneas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, enjoying the laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not help thinking of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, rather apologising, \xe2\x80\x98when\r\nI was watching Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s manner; it is such an imitation of Philip;\r\nlooking droller, I think, in his absence, than in his presence. I wonder\r\nif he is conscious of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It does not suit him at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; because he has no\r\nnatural dignity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A man ought to be six foot one, person and mind, to suit with that\r\ngrand, sedate, gracious way of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s Guy\xe2\x80\x99s measure of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s intellect,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98just six\r\nfoot one inch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As much more than other people\xe2\x80\x99s twice his height,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who was your neighbour, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Mayerne; I was very glad of him, to keep off those hunting friends\r\nof Mr. Brownlow, who never ask anything but if one has been to the\r\nraces, and if one likes balls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how did Mrs. Brownlow behave?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is a wonderful woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, in her quiet way;\r\nand Guy with an expression between drollery and simplicity, said, \xe2\x80\x98Then\r\nthere aren\xe2\x80\x99t many like her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she really a lady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip commonly calls her \xe2\x80\x9cthat woman,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98He has never\r\ngot over her one night classing him with his \xe2\x80\x9cyoung man\xe2\x80\x9d and myself, as\r\nthree of the shyest monkeys she ever came across.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She won\xe2\x80\x99t say so of Maurice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, as they recovered the laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I heard her deluding some young lady by saying he was the eldest son,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy, \xe2\x80\x98could she have thought so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I put in a gentle hint on Lord de Courcy\xe2\x80\x99s existence, to which she\r\nanswered, in her quick way, \xe2\x80\x98O ay, I forgot; but then he is the second,\r\nand that\xe2\x80\x99s the next thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you could but have heard the stories she and Maurice were telling\r\neach other!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98He was playing her off, I believe; for whatever\r\nshe told, he capped it with something more wonderful. Is she really a\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By birth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. It is only her high spirits and small\r\njudgment that make her so absurd.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How loud she is, too!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98What was all that about horses,\r\nGuy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was saying she drove two such spirited horses, that all the grooms\r\nwere afraid of them; and when she wanted to take out her little boy, Mr.\r\nBrownlow said \xe2\x80\x9cYou may do as you like my dear, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t have my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck broken, whatever you do with your own.\xe2\x80\x9d So Maurice answered by\r\ndeclaring he knew a lady who drove not two, but four-in-hand, and when\r\nthe leaders turned round and looked her in the face, gave a little nod,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged for your civility.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I wish I had heard that,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you hear her saying she smoked cigars?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEveryone cried out with horror or laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course, Maurice told a story of a lady who had a cigar case hanging\r\nat her chatelaine, and always took one to refresh her after a ball.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was interrupted by the announcement of his horse, and rode off at\r\nonce to Mr. Lascelles.\r\n\r\nOn his return he went straight to the drawing-room, where Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone was reading to Charles, and abruptly exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you wrong. She only said she had smoked one cigar.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nperceiving that he was interrupting, he added, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, on coming in from a solitary skating, he found the\r\nyounger party in the drawing-room, Charles entertaining the Miss Harpers\r\nwith the story of the cigars. He hastily interposed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told you it was but one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, tried one, and went on. She was preparing an order for Havannah.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought I told you I repeated the conversation incorrectly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it is not the letter, it is the spirit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, vexed at the\r\ninterference with his sport of amazing the Miss Harpers with outrageous\r\nstories of Mrs. Brownlow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is just like her,\xe2\x80\x99 said one of them. \xe2\x80\x98I could believe anything of\r\nMrs. Brownlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not believe this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, gently. \xe2\x80\x98I repeated incorrectly\r\nwhat had better have been forgotten, and I must beg my foolish\r\nexaggeration to go no further.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles became sullenly silent; Guy stood thoughtful; and Laura and\r\nAmabel could not easily sustain the conversation till the visitors took\r\ntheir leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a pother!\xe2\x80\x99 grumbled Charles, as soon as they were gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon for spoiling your story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; but it was my\r\nfault, so I was obliged to interfere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bosh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Who cares whether she smoked one or twenty? She\r\nis Mrs. Brownlow still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe point is, what was truth?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Straining at gnats,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little wings?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, glancing at Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have it your won way,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, throwing his head back; \xe2\x80\x98they must\r\nbe little souls, indeed that stick at such trash.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s brows were contracted with vexation, but Laura looked up very\r\nprettily, saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind him. We must all honour you for doing such an unpleasant\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will recommend him favourably to Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 growled Charles.\r\n\r\nThere was no reply, and presently Guy asked whether he would go up to\r\ndress? Having no other way of showing his displeasure, he refused, and\r\nremained nursing his ill-humour, till he forgot how slight the offence\r\nhad been, and worked himself into a sort of insane desire--half\r\nmischievous, half revengeful--to be as provoking as he could in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nSeldom had he been more contrary, as his old nurse was wont to call it.\r\nNo one could please him, and Guy was not allowed to do anything for him.\r\nWhatever he said was intended to rub on some sore place in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nHis mother and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s signs made him worse, for he had the pleasure of\r\nteasing them, also; but Guy endured it all with perfect temper, and he\r\ngrew more cross at his failure; yet, from force of habit, at bed-time,\r\nhe found himself on the stairs with Guy\xe2\x80\x99s arm supporting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98I tried hard to poke up the lion to-night,\r\nbut I see it won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis plea of trying experiments was neither absolutely true nor false;\r\nbut it restored Charles to himself, by saving a confession that he\r\nhad been out of temper, and enabling him to treat with him wonted\r\nindifference the expostulations of father, mother, and Laura.\r\n\r\nNow that the idea of \xe2\x80\x98poking up the lion\xe2\x80\x99 had once occurred, it became\r\nhis great occupation to attempt it. He wanted to see some evidence of\r\nthe fiery temper, and it was a new sport to try to rouse it; one, too,\r\nwhich had the greater relish, as it kept the rest of the family on\r\nthorns.\r\n\r\nHe would argue against his real opinion, talk against his better sense,\r\ntake the wrong side, and say much that was very far from his true\r\nsentiments. Guy could not understand at first, and was quite confounded\r\nat some of the views he espoused, till Laura came to his help, greatly\r\nirritating her brother by hints that he was not in earnest. Next time\r\nshe could speak to Guy alone, she told him he must not take all Charles\r\nsaid literally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought he could hardly mean it: but why should he talk so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t excuse him; I know it is very wrong, and at the expense of\r\ntruth, and it is very disagreeable of him--I wish he would not; but he\r\nalways does what he likes, and it is one of his amusements, so we must\r\nbear with him, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrom that time Guy seemed to have no trouble in reining in his temper\r\nin arguing with Charles, except once, when the lion was fairly roused by\r\nsomething that sounded like a sneer about King Charles I.\r\n\r\nHis whole face changed, his hazel eye gleamed with light like an\r\neagle\xe2\x80\x99s, and he started up, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did not mean that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask Strafford,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Charles, coolly, startled, but satisfied to\r\nhave found the vulnerable point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ungenerous, unmanly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, his voice low, but quivering with\r\nindignation; \xe2\x80\x98ungenerous to reproach him with what he so bitterly\r\nrepented. Could not his penitence, could not his own blood\xe2\x80\x99--but as he\r\nspoke, the gleam of wrath faded, the flush deepened on the cheek, and he\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 soliloquized Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it! I could fancy his wrath\r\nsomething terrific when it was once well up. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was\r\ncoming next; but I believe he has got himself pretty well in hand. It is\r\nplaying with edge tools; and now I have been favoured with one flash of\r\nthe Morville eye, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him alone; but it _ryled_ me to be treated as\r\nsomething beneath his anger, like a woman or a child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes, Guy came back: \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry that I was hasty just\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know you had such personal feelings about King Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you would do me a kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Guy, \xe2\x80\x98you would just say you\r\ndid not mean it. I know you do not, but if you would only say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you have the wit to see I have too much taste to be a\r\nroundhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I hope I shall know your jest from your earnest\r\nanother time. Only if you would oblige me, you would never jest again\r\nabout King Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis brow darkened into a stern, grave expression, so entirely in\r\nearnest, that Charles, though making no answer, could not do otherwise\r\nthan feel compliance unavoidable. Charles had never been so entirely\r\nconquered, yet, strange to say, he was not, as usual, rendered sullen.\r\n\r\nAt night, when Guy had taken him to his room, he paused and said--\xe2\x80\x98You\r\nare sure that you have forgiven me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! You have not forgotten that yet?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry you bear so much malice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you imagining?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy. \xe2\x80\x98It was my own part I was\r\nremembering, as I must, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles did not choose to betray that he did not see the necessity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought King Charles\xe2\x80\x99s wrongs were rankling. I only spoke as taking\r\nliberties with a friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x98it may be foolish, but I do not feel as\r\nif one could do so with King Charles. He is too near home; he suffered\r\nto much from scoffs and railings; his heart was too tender, his\r\nrepentance too deep for his friends to add one word even in jest to the\r\nheap of reproach. How one would have loved him!\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Guy, wrapped\r\nup in his own thoughts,--\xe2\x80\x98loved him for the gentleness so little\r\naccordant with the rude times and the part he had to act--served him\r\nwith half like a knight\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to his lady-love, half like devotion\r\nto a saint, as Montrose did--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x98Great, good, and just, could I but rate\r\n                    My grief, and thy too rigid fate,\r\n                  I\xe2\x80\x99d weep the world in such a strain,\r\n                    As it should deluge once again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, with sudden vehemence, \xe2\x80\x98how one would have fought\r\nfor him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I should like to see you and Deloraine\r\ncharging at the head of Prince Rupert\xe2\x80\x99s troopers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, suddenly recalled, and colouring deeply;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I forgot where I was, and have treated you to one of my old\r\ndreams in my boatings at home. You may quiz me as much as you please\r\ntomorrow. Good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a rhapsody!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Charles; \xe2\x80\x98yes it was. I wonder I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlaugh at it; but I was naturally carried along. Fancy that! He did it so\r\nnaturally; in fact, it was all from the bottom of his heart, and I\r\ncould not quiz him--no, no more than Montrose himself. He is a strange\r\narticle! But he keeps one awake, which is more than most people do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was indeed likely to keep every one awake just then; for Mr.\r\nEdmonstone was going to take him out hunting for the first time, and\r\nhe was half wild about it. The day came, and half an hour before Mr.\r\nEdmonstone was ready, Guy was walking about the hall, checking many an\r\nincipient whistle, and telling every one that he was beforehand with the\r\nworld, for he had read one extra hour yesterday, and had got through\r\nthe others before breakfast. Laura thought it very true that, as Philip\r\nsaid, he was only a boy, and moralized to Charlotte on his being the\r\nsame age as herself--very nearly eighteen. Mrs. Edmonstone told Charles\r\nit was a treat to see any one so happy, and when he began to chafe at\r\nthe delay, did her best to beguile the time, but without much success.\r\nGuy had ever learned to wait patiently, and had a custom of marching up\r\nand down, and listening with his head thrown back, or, as Charles used\r\nto call it, \xe2\x80\x98prancing in the hall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s patience was tried by the preparation for the hunt\r\nin the morning, it was no less her lot to hear of it in the evening. Guy\r\ncame home in the highest spirits, pouring out his delight to every one,\r\nwith animation and power of description giving all he said a charm. The\r\npleasure did not lose by repetition; he was more engrossed by it\r\nevery time; and no one could be more pleased with his ardour than Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, who, proud of him and his riding, gave a sigh to past hopes\r\nof poor Charles, and promoted the hunting with far more glee that he had\r\npromoted the reading.\r\n\r\nThe Redclyffe groom, William, whose surname of Robinson was entirely\r\nforgotten in the appellation of William of Deloraine, was as proud of\r\nSir Guy as Mr. Edmonstone could be; but made representations to his\r\nmaster that he must not hunt Deloraine two days in the week, and ride\r\nhim to Broadstone two more. Guy then walked to Broadstone; but\r\nWilliam was no better pleased, for he thought the credit of Redclyffe\r\ncompromised, and punished him by reporting Deloraine not fit to be\r\nused next hunting day. Mr. Edmonstone perceived that Guy ought to have\r\nanother hunter; Philip heard of one for sale, and after due inspection\r\nall admired--even William, who had begun by remarking that there might\r\nbe so many screw-looses about a horse, that a man did not know what to\r\nbe at with them.\r\n\r\nPhilip, who was conducting the negotiation, came to dine at Hollywell to\r\nsettle the particulars. Guy was in a most eager state; and they and Mr.\r\nEdmonstone talked so long about horses, that they sent Charles to sleep;\r\nhis mother began to read, and the two elder girls fell into a low,\r\nmysterious confabulation of their own till they were startled by a\r\nquestion from Philip as to what could engross them so deeply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98a banshee story in Eveleen de Courcy\xe2\x80\x99s last\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never like telling ghost stories to people who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in\r\nthem,\xe2\x80\x99 half whispered Amabel to her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you believe them?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Philip, looking full at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now I won\xe2\x80\x99t have little Amy asked the sort of question she most\r\ndislikes,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Laura; \xe2\x80\x98I had rather ask if you laugh at us for\r\nthinking many ghost stories inexplicable?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The universal belief could hardly be kept up without some grounds,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would apply as well to fairies,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every one has an unexplained ghost story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but I would give something to meet any one whose\r\nghost story did not rest on the testimony of a friend\xe2\x80\x99s cousin\xe2\x80\x99s cousin,\r\na very strong-minded person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how a person who has seen a ghost could ever speak of\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you not tell us a story of pixies at Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes; the people there believe in them firmly. Jonas Ledbury heard\r\nthem laughing one night when he could not get the gate open,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! You are the authority for ghosts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I forgot that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura: \xe2\x80\x98I wonder we never asked you about your\r\nRedclyffe ghost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look as if you had seen it yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amy, almost frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, let us have the whole story,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Was it your own\r\nreflection in the glass? was it old sir Hugh? or was it the murderer of\r\nBecket? Come, the ladies are both ready to scream at the right moment.\r\nNever mind about giving him a cocked-hat, for with whom may you take a\r\nliberty, if not with an ancestral ghost of your own?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy could not think how Philip could have gone on all this time; perhaps\r\nit was because he was not watching how Guy\xe2\x80\x99s colour varied, how he bit\r\nhis lip; and at last his eyes seemed to grow dark in the middle, and\r\nto sparkle with fire, as with a low, deep tone, like distant thunder,\r\nconveying a tremendous force of suppressed passion, he exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Beware of trifling--\xe2\x80\x99 then breaking off hastened out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Edmonstone, startled from his nap; and\r\nhis wife looked up anxiously, but returned to her book, as her nephew\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x98Nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could you Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really believe he has seen it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in a startled whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has felt it, Amy--the Morville spirit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a great pity you spoke of putting a cocked hat to it,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura; \xe2\x80\x98he must have suspected us of telling you what happened about\r\nMrs. Brownlow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are you going to do it now?\xe2\x80\x99 said her sister in a tone of\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think Philip should hear it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; and she proceeded to relate\r\nthe story. She was glad to see that her cousin was struck with it;\r\nhe admired this care to maintain strict truth, and even opened a\r\nmemorandum-book--the sight of which Charles dreaded--and read the\r\nfollowing extract: \xe2\x80\x98Do not think of one falsity as harmless, and another\r\nas slight, and another as unintended. Cast them all aside. They may be\r\nlight and accidental, but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the\r\npit, for all that; and it is better that our hearts should be swept\r\nclean of them, without over care as to which is the largest or\r\nblackest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura and Amy were much pleased; but he went on to regret that such\r\nexcellent dispositions should be coupled with such vehemence of\r\ncharacter and that unhappy temper. Amy was glad that her sister ventured\r\nto hint that he might be more cautious in avoiding collisions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am cautious\xe2\x80\x99, replied he, quickly and sternly; \xe2\x80\x98I am not to be told\r\nof the necessity of exercising forbearance with this poor boy; but it is\r\nimpossible to reckon on all the points on which he is sensitive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is sensitive,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean only in temper, but in\r\neverything. I wonder if it is part of his musical temperament to be as\r\nkeenly alive to all around, as his ear is to every note. A bright day,\r\na fine view, is such real happiness to him; he dwells on every beauty of\r\nRedclyffe with such affection; and then, when he reads, Charles says it\r\nis like going over the story again himself to watch his face act it in\r\nthat unconscious manner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He makes all the characters so real in talking them over,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and he does not always know how they will end before they begin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think it hardly safe for so excitable a mind to dwell much on\r\nthe world of fiction,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing has affected him so much as Sintram,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98I never saw\r\nanything like it. He took it up by chance, and stood reading it while\r\nall those strange expressions began to flit over his face, and at last\r\nhe fairly cried over it so much, that he was obliged to fly out of the\r\nroom. How often he has read it I cannot tell; I believe he has bought\r\none for himself, and it is as if the engraving had a fascination for\r\nhim; he stands looking at it as if he was in a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a great mystery,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All men are mysterious,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip \xe2\x80\x98but he not more than others,\r\nthough he may appear so to you, because you have not had much\r\nexperience, and also because most of the men you have seen have been\r\nrounded into uniformity like marbles, their sharp angles rubbed off\r\nagainst each other at school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would it be better if there were more sharp angles?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, thus\r\nsetting on foot a discussion on public schools, on which Philip had, of\r\ncourse, a great deal to say.\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s kind little heart was meanwhile grieving for Guy, and longing to\r\nsee him return, but he did not come till after Philip\xe2\x80\x99s departure. He\r\nlooked pale and mournful, his hair hanging loose and disordered, and\r\nher terror was excited lest he might actually have seen his ancestor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nghost, which, in spite of her desire to believe in ghosts, in general,\r\nshe did not by any means wish to have authenticated. He was surprised\r\nand a good deal vexed to find Philip gone, but he said hardly anything,\r\nand it was soon bedtime. When Charles took his arm, he exclaimed, on\r\nfinding his sleeve wet--\xe2\x80\x98What can you have been doing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Walking up and down under the wall,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Guy, with some reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, in the rain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, perhaps it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy, who was just behind, carrying the crutch, dreaded Charles\xe2\x80\x99s making\r\nany allusion to Sintram\xe2\x80\x99s wild locks and evening wanderings, but ever\r\nsince the outburst about King Charles, the desire to tease and irritate\r\nGuy had ceased.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the dressing-room door, and as Guy bade her good night,\r\nhe pushed back the damp hair that had fallen across his forehead,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry I disturbed your evening. I will tell you the\r\nmeaning of it another time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has certainly seen the ghost!\xe2\x80\x99 said silly little Amy, as she shut\r\nherself into her own room in such a fit of vague \xe2\x80\x98eerie\xe2\x80\x99 fright, that it\r\nwas not till she had knelt down, and with her face hidden in her hands,\r\nsaid her evening prayer, that she could venture to lift up her head and\r\nlook into the dark corners of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another time!\xe2\x80\x99 Her heart throbbed at the promise.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, as she and Laura were fighting with a refractory\r\nbranch of wisteria which had been torn down by the wind, and refused to\r\nreturn to its place, Guy, who had been with his tutor, came in from the\r\nstable-yard, reduced the trailing bough to obedience, and then joined\r\nthem in their walk. He looked grave, was silent at first, and then spoke\r\nabruptly--\xe2\x80\x98It is due to you to explain my behaviour last night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy thinks you must have seen the ghost,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, trying to be gay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I frighten you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, turning round, full of compunction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no. I never saw it. I never even heard of its being seen. I am very\r\nsorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was very silly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Guy, \xe2\x80\x98when I think of the origin of the ghost story, I\r\ncannot laugh, and if Philip knew all--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! He does not,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura; \xe2\x80\x98he only looks on it as we have always\r\ndone, as a sort of romantic appendage to Redclyffe. I should think\r\nbetter of a place for being haunted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to be proud of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I wanted to make out whether it\r\nwas old Sir Hugh or the murderer of Becket, who was said to groan and\r\nturn the lock of Dark Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. I hunted among old papers, and a\r\nhorrible story I found. That wretched Sir Hugh,--the same who began the\r\nquarrel with your mother\xe2\x80\x99s family--he was a courtier of Charles II, as\r\nbad or worse than any of that crew--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was the quarrel about?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was believed to have either falsified or destroyed his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill, so as to leave his brother, your ancestor, landless; his brother\r\nremonstrated, and he turned him out of doors. The forgery never was\r\nproved, but there was little doubt of it. There are traditions of his\r\ncrimes without number, especially his furious anger and malice. He\r\ncompelled a poor lady to marry him, though she was in love with another\r\nman; then he was jealous; he waylaid his rival, shut him up in the\r\nturret chamber, committed him to prison, and bribed Judge Jeffries\r\nto sentence him--nay it is even said he carried his wife to see the\r\nexecution! He was so execrated that he fled the country; he went to\r\nHolland, curried favour with William of Orange, brought his wealth to\r\nhelp him, and that is the deserving action which got him the baronetcy!\r\nHe served in the army a good many years, and came home when he thought\r\nhis sins would be forgotten. But do you remember those lines?\xe2\x80\x99 and Guy\r\nrepeated them in the low rigid tone, almost of horror, in which he had\r\nbeen telling the story:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x98On some his vigorous judgments light,\r\n                  In that dread pause \xe2\x80\x98twixt day and night,\r\n                      Life\xe2\x80\x99s closing twilight hour;\r\n                  Round some, ere yet they meet their doom,\r\n                  Is shed the silence of the tomb,\r\n                      The eternal shadows lower.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was so with him; he lost his senses, and after many actions of mad\r\nviolence, he ended by hanging himself in the very room where he had\r\nimprisoned his victim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Horrible!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Yet I do not see why, when it is all past, you\r\nshould feel it so deeply.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How should I not feel it?\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Is it not written that the\r\nsins of the fathers shall be visited on the children? You wonder to\r\nsee me so foolish about Sintram. Well, it is my firm belief that such\r\na curse of sin and death as was on Sintram rests on the descendants of\r\nthat miserable man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girls were silent, struck with awe and dismay at the fearful reality\r\nwith which he pronounced the words. At last, Amy whispered, \xe2\x80\x98But Sintram\r\nconquered his doom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the same time Laura gathered her thoughts together, and said, \xe2\x80\x98This\r\nmust be an imagination. You have dwelt on it and fostered it till you\r\nbelieve it, but such notions should be driven away or they will work\r\ntheir own fulfilment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look at the history of the Morvilles, and see if it be an imagination,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Crime and bloodshed have been the portion of each--each has\r\nadded weight and darkness to the doom which he had handed on. My own\r\npoor father, with his early death, was, perhaps, the happiest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura saw the idea was too deeply rooted to be treated as a fancy, and\r\nshe found a better argument. \xe2\x80\x98The doom of sin and death is on us all,\r\nbut you should remember that if you are a Morville, you are also a\r\nChristian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does remember it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, raising her eyes to his face, and then\r\ncasting them down, blushing at having understood his countenance, where,\r\nin the midst of the gloomy shades, there rested for an instant the gleam\r\nwhich her mother had likened to the expression of Raffaelle\xe2\x80\x99s cherub.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey walked on for some time in silence. At last Laura exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Are\r\nyou really like the portrait of this unfortunate Sir Hugh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy made a sign of assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! It must have been taken before he grew wicked,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; and Laura\r\nfelt the same conviction, that treacherous revenge could never have\r\nexisted beneath so open a countenance, with so much of highmindedness,\r\npure faith and contempt of wrong in every glance of the eagle eye, in\r\nthe frank expansion of the smooth forehead.\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s hearty voice, bawling across\r\nthe garden for one of the men. \xe2\x80\x98O Guy! are you there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, as\r\nsoon as he saw him. \xe2\x80\x98Just what I wanted! Your gun, man! We are going to\r\nferret a rabbit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy ran off at full speed in search of his gun, whistling to Bustle. Mr.\r\nEdmonstone found his man, and the sisters were again alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not tell all this to Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would show why he was hurt, and it can be no secret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say you are right, but I have a feeling against it. Well, I am\r\nglad he had not seen the ghost!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two girls had taken their walk, and were just going in, when,\r\nlooking round, they saw Philip walking fast and determinedly up the\r\napproach, and as they turned back to meet him, the first thing he said\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x98Where is Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ferreting rabbits with papa. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where is my aunt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDriving out with Charles and Charlotte. What is the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here. Can you tell me the meaning of this which I found on my\r\ntable when I came in this morning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a card of Sir Guy Morville, on the back of which was written in\r\npencil, \xe2\x80\x98Dear P., I find hunting and reading don\xe2\x80\x99t agree, so take no\r\nfurther steps about the horse. Many thanks for your trouble.--G.M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98is the result of brooding all night on his\r\nresentment.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh no!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura, colouring with eagerness, \xe2\x80\x98you do not\r\nunderstand him. He could not bear it last night, because, as he has been\r\nexplaining to us, that old Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s story was more shocking than we\r\never guessed, and he has a fancy that their misfortunes are a family\r\nfate, and he could not bear to hear it spoken of lightly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! He has been telling you his own story, has he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s colour grew still deeper, \xe2\x80\x98If you had been there,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you would have been convinced. Why will you not believe that he finds\r\nhunting interfere with reading?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He should have thought of that before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here have I half bought the horse! I have wasted the whole morning on\r\nit, and now I have to leave it on the man\xe2\x80\x99s hands. I had a dozen times\r\nrather take it myself, if I could afford it. Such a bargain as I had\r\nmade, and such an animal as you will not see twice in your life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a great pity,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98He should have known his own mind. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like people to give trouble for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Crazy about it last night, and giving it up this morning! A most\r\nextraordinary proceeding. No, no, Laura, this is not simple fickleness,\r\nit would be too absurd. It is temper, temper, which makes a man punish\r\nhimself, in hopes of punishing others.\r\n\r\nLaura still spoke for Guy, and Amy rejoiced; for if her sister had not\r\ntaken up the defence of the absent, she must, and she felt too strongly\r\nto be willing to speak. It seemed too absurd for one feeling himself\r\nunder such a doom to wrangle about a horse, yet she was somewhat amused\r\nby the conviction that if Guy had really wished to annoy Philip he had\r\ncertainly succeeded.\r\n\r\nThere was no coming to an agreement. Laura\xe2\x80\x99s sense of justice revolted\r\nat the notion of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s being guilty of petty spite; while Philip, firm\r\nin his preconceived idea of his character, and his own knowledge of\r\nmankind, was persuaded that he had imputed the true motive, and was\r\ndispleased at Laura\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to argue the point. He could not wait\r\nto see any one else, as he was engaged to dine out, and he set off again\r\nat his quick, resolute pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is very unfair!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did not mean to be so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98and though he is mistaken in\r\nimputing such motives, Guy\xe2\x80\x99s conduct has certainly been vexatious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were just turning to go in, when they were interrupted by the\r\nreturn of the carriage; and before Charles had been helped up the steps,\r\ntheir father and Guy came in sight. While Guy went to shut up Bustle,\r\nwho was too wet for the drawing-room, Mr. Edmonstone came up to the\r\nothers, kicking away the pebbles before him, and fidgeting with his\r\ngloves, as he always did when vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty go!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Here is Guy telling me he won\xe2\x80\x99t hunt any\r\nmore!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not hunt!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Edmonstone and Charles at once; \xe2\x80\x98and why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! something about its taking his mind from his reading; but that\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be it--impossible, you know; I\xe2\x80\x99d give ten pounds to know what has\r\nvexed him. So keen as he was about it last night, and I vow, one of the\r\nbest riders in the whole field. Giving up that horse, too--I declare\r\nit is a perfect sin! I told him he had gone too far, and he said he had\r\nleft a note with Philip this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; Philip has just been here about it. Guy left a card,\r\nsaying, hunting and reading would not agree.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is an excuse, depend upon it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Something has\r\nnettled him, I am sure. It could not be that Gordon, could it, with\r\nhis hail-fellow-well-met manner? I thought Guy did not half like it the\r\nother day, when he rode up with his \xe2\x80\x9cHollo, Morville!\xe2\x80\x9d The Morvilles\r\nhave a touch of pride of their own; eh, mamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should be inclined to believe his own account of himself,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you, \xe2\x80\x98tis utterly against reason,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, angrily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he was a fellow like Philip, or James Ross, I could believe it; but\r\nhe--he make a book-worm! He hates it, like poison, at the bottom of his\r\nheart, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it; and the worst of it is, the fellow putting\r\nforward such a fair reason one can\xe2\x80\x99t--being his guardian, and all--say\r\nwhat one thinks of it oneself. Eh, mamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you take him in hand, mamma. I dare say he will tell you the\r\nrights of it, and if it is only that Gordon, explain it rightly to him,\r\nshow him \xe2\x80\x98tis only the man\xe2\x80\x99s way; tell him he treats me so for ever, and\r\nwould the Lord-Lieutenant if he was in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For a\xe2\x80\x99 that and a\xe2\x80\x99 that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, as Amy led him into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are sure the reading is the only reason?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s quite absurd enough for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; but \xe2\x80\x98absurd\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\npronounced in a way that made its meaning far from annoying even to\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s little champion.\r\n\r\nGuy came in the next moment, and running lightly up-stairs after Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, found her opening the dressing-room door, and asked if he\r\nmight come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98I am quite ready for one of our twilight\r\ntalks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I have vexed Mr. Edmonstone,\xe2\x80\x99 began Guy; \xe2\x80\x98and I am very\r\nsorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was only afraid that something might have occurred to vex you, which\r\nyou might not like to mention to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, hesitating\r\na little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Me! What could I have done to make him think so? I am angry with no one\r\nbut myself. The fact is only this, the hunting is too pleasant; it fills\r\nup my head all day and all night; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t attend rightly to anything\r\nelse. If I am out in the morning and try to pay for it at night, it will\r\nnot do; I can but just keep awake and that\xe2\x80\x99s all; the Greek letters all\r\nseem to be hunting each other, the simplest things grow difficult, and\r\nat last all I can think of, is how near the minute hand of my watch is\r\nnear to the hour I have set myself. So, for the last fortnight, every\r\nconstruing with Mr. Lascelles has been worse than the last; and as to my\r\nLatin verses, they were beyond everything shocking, so you see there is\r\nno making the two things agree, and the hunting must wait till I grow\r\nsteadier, if I ever do. Heigho! It is a great bore to be so stupid, for\r\nI thought--But it is of no use to talk of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Edmonstone would be a very unreasonable guardian, indeed, to be\r\ndispleased,\xe2\x80\x99 said his friend, smiling. You say you stopped the purchase\r\nof the horse. Why so? Could you not keep him till you are more sure of\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think I might?\xe2\x80\x99 joyously exclaimed Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to Philip\r\nthis minute by the post. Such a splendid creature: it would do you good\r\nto see it--such action--such a neck--such spirit. It would be a shame\r\nnot to secure it. But no--no--\xe2\x80\x99 and he checked himself sorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave made my mind before that I don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it. If it was here, it\r\nwould always have to be tried: if I heard the hounds I don\xe2\x80\x99t know I\r\nshould keep from riding after them; whereas, now I can\xe2\x80\x99t, for William\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t let me take Deloraine. No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t trust myself to keep such a\r\nhorse, and not hunt. It will serve me right to see Mr. Brownlow on it,\r\nand he will never miss such a chance!\xe2\x80\x99 and the depth of his sigh bore\r\nwitness to the struggle it cost him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not like to use anyone as you use yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, looking at him with affectionate anxiety, which seemed\r\nsuddenly to change the current of his thought, for he exclaimed\r\nabruptly--\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Edmonstone, can you tell me anything about my mother?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid not,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, kindly; \xe2\x80\x98you know we had so little\r\nintercourse with your family, that I heard little but the bare facts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, leaning on the chimneypiece, \xe2\x80\x98that I ever\r\nthought much about her till I knew you, but lately I have fancied a\r\ngreat deal about what might have been if she had but lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s way to say half what she felt, and she went\r\non--\xe2\x80\x98Poor thing! I believe she was quite a child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only seventeen when she died,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone went to a drawer, took out two or three bundles of\r\nold letters, and after searching in them by the fire-light, said--\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a little about her; it is in a letter from my sister-in-law,\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s mother, when they were staying at Stylehurst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who? My father and mother?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you not know they had been there three or four days?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--I know less about them than anybody,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, sadly: but as Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone waited, doubtful as to whether she might be about to make\r\ndisclosures for which he was unprepared, he added, hastily--\xe2\x80\x98I do\r\nknow the main facts of the story; I was told them last autumn;\xe2\x80\x99 and an\r\nexpression denoting the remembrance of great suffering came over his\r\nface; then, pausing a moment, he said--\xe2\x80\x98I knew Archdeacon Morville had\r\nbeen very kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was always interested about your father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nhappening to meet him in London some little time after his marriage,\r\nhe--he was pleased with the manner in which he was behaving then,\r\nthought--thought--\xe2\x80\x99 And here, recollecting that she must not speak ill\r\nof old Sir Guy, nor palliate his son\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, poor Mrs. Edmonstone\r\ngot into an inextricable confusion--all the worse because the fierce\r\ntwisting of a penwiper in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s fingers denoted that he was suffering a\r\ngreat trial of patience. She avoided the difficulty thus: \xe2\x80\x98It is hard\r\nto speak of such things when there is so much to be regretted on both\r\nsides; but the fact was, my brother thought your father was harshly\r\ndealt with at that time. Of course he had done very wrong; but he had\r\nbeen so much neglected and left to himself, that it seemed hardly\r\nfair to visit his offence on him as severely as if he had had more\r\nadvantages. So it ended in their coming to spend a day or two at\r\nStylehurst; and this is the letter my sister-in-law wrote at the time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cOur visitors have just left us, and on the whole I am much better\r\npleased than I expected. The little Mrs. Morville is a very pretty\r\ncreature, and as engaging as long flaxen curls, apple-blossom\r\ncomplexion, blue eyes, and the sweetest of voices can make her; so\r\nfull of childish glee and playfulness, that no one would stop to think\r\nwhether she was lady-like any more than you would with a child. She\r\nused to go singing like a bird about the house as soon as the first\r\nstrangeness wore off, which was after her first game of play with Fanny\r\nand Little Philip. She made them very fond of her, as indeed she would\r\nmake every one who spent a day or two in the same house with her. I\r\ncould almost defy Sir Guy not to be reconciled after one sight of\r\nher sweet sunny face. She is all affection and gentleness, and with\r\ntolerable training anything might be made of her; but she is so young\r\nin mind and manners, that one cannot even think of blaming her for her\r\nelopement, for she had no mother, no education but in music; and her\r\nbrother seems to have forced it on, thrown her in Mr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s way,\r\nand worked on his excitable temperament, until he hurried them into\r\nmarriage. Poor little girl, I suppose she little guesses what she has\r\ndone; but it was very pleasant to see how devotedly attached he seemed\r\nto her; and there was something beautiful in the softening of his\r\nimpetuous tones when he said, \xe2\x80\x98Marianne;\xe2\x80\x99 and her pride in him was very\r\npretty, like a child playing at matronly airs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy gave a long, heavy sigh, brushed away a tear, and after a long\r\nsilence, said, \xe2\x80\x98Is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All that I like to read to you. Indeed, there is no more about her;\r\nand it would be of no use to read all the reports that were going\r\nabout.--Ah! here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking into another letter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98she speaks of your father as a very fine young man, with most generous\r\nimpulses,\xe2\x80\x99--but here again she was obliged to stop, for the next\r\nsentence spoke of \xe2\x80\x98a noble character ruined by mismanagement.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98She\r\nnever saw them again,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Dixon, your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s brother, had great influence with your father, and made matters\r\nworse--so much worse, that my brother did not feel himself justified in\r\nhaving any more to do with them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! he went to America,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know any more about him\r\nexcept that he came to the funeral and stood with his arms folded, not\r\nchoosing to shake hands with my poor grandfather.\xe2\x80\x99 After another silence\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98Will you read that again?\xe2\x80\x99 and when he had heard it, he sat\r\nshading his brow with his hand, as if to bring the fair, girlish picture\r\nfully before his mind, while Mrs. Edmonstone sought in vain among her\r\nletters for one which did not speak of the fiery passions ignited on\r\neither side, in terms too strong to be fit for his ears.\r\n\r\nWhen next he spoke it was to repeat that he had not been informed of\r\nthe history of his parents till within the last few months. He had,\r\nof course, known the manner of their death, but had only lately become\r\naware of the circumstances attending it.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that Guy had grown up peculiarly shielded from evil, but\r\nignorant of the cause of the almost morbid solicitude with which he was\r\nregarded by his grandfather. He was a very happy, joyous boy, leading\r\nan active, enterprising life, though so lonely as to occasion greater\r\ndreaminess and thoughtfulness than usual at such an early age. He was\r\ndevotedly attached to his grandfather, looking on him as the first and\r\nbest of human beings, and silencing the belief that Sir Hugh Morville\r\nhad entailed a doom of crime and sorrow on the family, by a reference to\r\nhim, as one who had been always good and prosperous.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Guy had reached an age at which he must encounter the\r\ninfluences which had proved so baneful to others of his family, his\r\ngrandfather thought it time to give him the warning of his own history.\r\n\r\nThe sins, which the repentance of years had made more odious in the\r\neyes of the old man, were narrated; the idleness and insubordination\r\nat first, then the reckless pursuit of pleasure, the craving for\r\nexcitement, the defiance of rule and authority, till folly had become\r\nvice, and vice had led to crime.\r\n\r\nHe had fought no fewer than three duels, and only one had been\r\nbloodless. His misery after the first had well-nigh led to a reform;\r\nbut time had dulled its acuteness--it had been lost in fresh scenes\r\nof excitement--and at the next offence rage had swept away such\r\nrecollections. Indeed, so far had he lost the natural generosity of his\r\ncharacter, that his remorse had been comparatively slight for the last,\r\nwhich was the worst of all, since he had forced the quarrel on his\r\nvictim, Captain Wellwood, whose death had left a wife and children\r\nalmost destitute. His first awakening to a sense of what his course had\r\nbeen, was when he beheld his only child, in the prime of youth, carried\r\nlifeless across his threshold, and attributed his death to his own\r\nintemperance and violence. That hour made Sir Guy Morville an old and a\r\nbroken-hearted man; and he repented as vigorously as he had sinned.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he dared to hope that his son\xe2\x80\x99s orphan would be spared,\r\nhe had been devoted to him, but still mournfully, envying and pitying\r\nhis innocence as something that could not last.\r\n\r\nHe saw bright blossoms put forth, as the boy grew older; but they were\r\nnot yet fruits, and he did not dare to believe they ever would be.\r\nThe strength of will which had, in his own case, been the slave of his\r\npassions, had been turned inward to subdue the passions themselves, but\r\nthis was only the beginning--the trial was not yet come. He could hope\r\nhis grandson might repent, but this was the best that he dared to think\r\npossible. He could not believe that a Morville could pass unscathed\r\nthrough the world, or that his sins would not be visited on the head of\r\nhis only descendant; and the tone of his narration was throughout such\r\nas might almost have made the foreboding cause its own accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe effect was beyond what he had expected; for a soul deeply dyed\r\nin guilt, even though loathing its own stains, had not the power of\r\nconceiving how foul was the aspect of vice, to one hitherto guarded from\r\nits contemplation, and living in a world of pure, lofty day-dreams. The\r\nboy sat the whole time without a word, his face bent down and hidden\r\nby his clasped hands, only now and then unable to repress a start or\r\nshudder at some fresh disclosure; and when it was ended, he stood up,\r\ngazed round, and walked uncertainly, as if he did not know where he\r\nwas. His next impulse was to throw himself on his knee beside his\r\ngrandfather, and caress him as he used to when a child. The \xe2\x80\x98good-night\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas spoken, and Guy was shut into his room, with his overwhelming\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather a blood-stained, remorseful man! The doom was complete,\r\nhimself heir to the curse of Sir Hugh, and fated to run the same career;\r\nand as he knew full well, with the tendency to the family character\r\nstrong within him, the germs of these hateful passions ready to take\r\nroot downwards and bear fruit upwards, with the very countenance of Sir\r\nHugh, and the same darkening, kindling eyes, of which traditions had\r\npreserved the remembrance.\r\n\r\nHe was crushed for awhile. The consciousness of strength not his own,\r\nof the still small voice that could subdue the fire, the earthquake, and\r\nthe whirlwind, was slow in coming to him; and when it came, he, like his\r\ngrandfather, had hope rather of final repentance than of keeping himself\r\nunstained.\r\n\r\nHis mind had not recovered the shock when his grandfather died,--died\r\nin faith and fear, with good hope of accepted repentance, but unable to\r\nconvey the assurance of such hope to his grandson. Grief for the only\r\nparent he had ever known, and the sensation of being completely alone in\r\nthe world, were joined to a vague impression of horror at the suddenness\r\nof the stroke, and it was long before the influence of Hollywell, or the\r\nelasticity of his own youthfulness, could rouse him from his depression.\r\n\r\nEven then it was almost against his will that he returned to enjoyment,\r\nunable to avoid being amused, but feeling as if joy was not meant for\r\nhim, and as if those around were walking \xe2\x80\x98in a world of light,\xe2\x80\x99 where he\r\ncould scarcely hope to tread a few uncertain steps. In this despondency\r\nwas Guy\xe2\x80\x99s chief danger, as it was likely to make him deem a struggle\r\nwith temptation fruitless, while his high spirits and powers of keen\r\nenjoyment increased the peril of recklessness in the reaction.\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Edmonstone who first spoke with him cheerfully of\r\na successful conflict with evil, and made him perceive that his\r\ntemptations were but such as is common to man. She had given him a clue\r\nto discover when and how to trust himself to enjoy; the story of Sintram\r\nhad stirred him deeply, and this very day, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s words, seemingly\r\nunheeded and unheard, had brought home to him the hope and encouragement\r\nof that marvellous tale.\r\n\r\nThey had helped him in standing, looking steadfastly upwards, and\r\ntreading down not merely evil, but the first token of coming evil,\r\nregardless of the bruises he might inflict on himself. Well for him if\r\nhe was constant.\r\n\r\nSuch was Guy\xe2\x80\x99s inner life; his outward life, frank and joyous, has been\r\nshown, and the two flowed on like a stream, pure as crystal, but into\r\nwhich the eye cannot penetrate from its depth. The surface would be\r\nsometimes obscured by cloud or shade, and reveal the sombre wells\r\nbeneath; but more often the sunshine would penetrate the inmost\r\nrecesses, and make them glance and sparkle, showing themselves as clear\r\nand limpid as the surface itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\n      Can piety the discord heal,\r\n      Or stanch the death-feud\xe2\x80\x99s enmity?\r\n                                --Scott\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that such a history of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s mind was expressed\r\nby himself, or understood by Mrs. Edmonstone; but she saw enough to\r\nguess at his character, perceive the sort of guidance he needed, and be\r\ndoubly interested in him. Much did she wish he could have such a friend\r\nas her brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a\r\nfriendship with her nephew.\r\n\r\nThe present question about the horse was, she thought, unfortunate,\r\nsince, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder\r\nPhilip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s vexation was soon over. As soon as\r\nshe had persuaded him that there had been no offence, he strove to say\r\nwith a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy he would be\r\na thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an\r\nexcellent joke.\r\n\r\nPhilip had made up his mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about\r\nit. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an\r\nunderstanding; but when she hinted it, he wore such a dignified air of\r\nnot being offended, that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct\r\none so much better able to judge. On his side Guy had no idea the\r\ntrouble he had caused; so, after bestowing his thanks in a gay, off-hand\r\nway, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, he did his best\r\nto bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of it, and\r\nappease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.\r\n\r\nWhen all William\xe2\x80\x99s manoeuvres resulted in his master\xe2\x80\x99s not hunting at\r\nall, he was persuaded it was Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s fault, compassionated\r\nSir Guy with all his heart, and could only solace himself by taking\r\nDeloraine to exercise where he was most likely to meet the hounds. He\r\nfurther chose to demonstrate that he was not Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s servant,\r\nby disregarding some of his stable regulations; but as soon as this came\r\nto his master\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, a few words were spoken so sharp and stern,\r\nthat William never attempted to disobey again.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if it was the perception that so much was kept back by a\r\nstrong force, that made Guy\xe2\x80\x99s least token of displeasure so formidable.\r\nA village boy, whom he caught misusing a poor dog, was found a few\r\nminutes after, by Mr. Ross, in a state of terror that was positively\r\nludicrous, though it did not appear that Sir Guy had said or done much\r\nto alarm him; it was only the light in his eyes, and the strength\r\nof repressed indignation in his short broken words that had made the\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if the force of his anger might be fearful, if once it\r\nbroke forth without control; yet at the same time he had a gentleness\r\nand attention, alike to small and great, which, with his high spirit\r\nand good nature, his very sweet voice and pleasant smile, made him a\r\npeculiarly winning and engaging person; and few who saw him could help\r\nbeing interested in him.\r\n\r\nNo wonder he had become in the eyes of the Edmonstones almost a part of\r\ntheir family. Mrs. Edmonstone had assumed a motherly control over him,\r\nto which he submitted with a sort of affectionate gratitude.\r\n\r\nOne day Philip remarked, that he never saw any one so restless as\r\nGuy, who could neither talk nor listen without playing with something.\r\nScissors, pencil, paper-knife, or anything that came in his way, was\r\nsure to be twisted or tormented; or if nothing else was at hand, he\r\nopened and shut his own knife so as to put all the spectators in fear\r\nfor his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98I saw how it tortured your eyebrows all the time you\r\nwere translating Schiller to us. I wondered you were not put out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I consider that to be put out--by which you mean to have the intellect\r\nat the mercy of another\xe2\x80\x99s folly--is beneath a reasonable creature,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but that I was annoyed, I do not deny. It is a token of a\r\nrestless, ill-regulated mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Restless, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone \xe2\x80\x98but not necessarily\r\nill-regulated. I should think it rather a sign that he had no one to\r\ntell him of the tricks which mothers generally nip in the bud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was going to say that I think he fidgets less,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98but I\r\nthink his chief contortions of the scissors have been when Philip has\r\nbeen here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They have, I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother, I was thinking of giving him a\r\nhint.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, aunt, you are a tamer of savage beasts if you venture on such a\r\nsubject,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you dare me?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he would do more than give you one of his\r\nlightning glances: but that, I think, is more than you desire.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Considerably,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98for his sake as much as my own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98mamma has nearly cured him of pawing like a horse in\r\nthe hall when he is kept waiting. He said he knew it was impatience,\r\nand begged her to tell him how to cure it. So she treated him as an old\r\nfairy might, and advised him in a grave, mysterious way, always to go\r\nand play the \xe2\x80\x9cHarmonious Blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x9d when he found himself getting\r\ninto \xe2\x80\x9ca taking\xe2\x80\x9d, just as if it was a charm. And he always does it most\r\ndutifully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has a very good effect,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98for it is apt to act\r\nas a summons to the other party, as well as a sedative to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must say I am curious to see what you will devise this time,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip; \xe2\x80\x98since you can\xe2\x80\x99t set him to play on the piano; and very few can\r\nbear to be told of a trick of the kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the course of that evening, Philip caused the great atlas to be\r\nbrought out in order to make investigations on the local habitation of\r\na certain Khan of Kipchack, who existed somewhere in the dark ages. Then\r\nhe came to Marco Polo, and Sir John Mandeville; and Guy, who knew both\r\nthe books in the library at Redclyffe, grew very eager in talking them\r\nover, and tracing their adventures--then to the Genoese merchants, where\r\nGuy confessed himself perfectly ignorant. Andrea Doria was the only\r\nGenoese he ever heard of; but he hunted out with great interest all the\r\nlocalities of their numerous settlements. Then came modern Italy, and\r\nits fallen palaces; then the contrast between the republican merchant\r\nand aristocratic lord of the soil; then the corn laws; and then, and not\r\ntill then, did Philip glance at his aunt, to show her Guy balancing a\r\nVenetian weight on as few of his fingers as could support it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98does that unfortunate glass inspire you with\r\nany arguments in favour of the Venetians?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy put it down at once, and Philip proceeded to improved methods of\r\nfarming, to enable landlords to meet the exigencies of the times. Guy\r\nhad got hold of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s spectacle-case, and was putting its\r\nspring to a hard trial. Mrs. Edmonstone doubted whether to interfere\r\nagain; she knew this was not the sort of thing that tried his temper,\r\nyet she particularly disliked playing him off, as it were for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\namusement, and quite as much letting him go on, and lower himself in her\r\nnephew\xe2\x80\x99s estimation. The spectacle-case settled the matter--a crack was\r\nheard, it refused to snap at all; and Guy, much discomfited, made many\r\napologies.\r\n\r\nAmy laughed; Philip was much too well-bred to do anything but curl his\r\nlip unconsciously. Mrs. Edmonstone waited till he was gone, then, when\r\nshe was wishing Guy \xe2\x80\x98good-night\xe2\x80\x99 at Charles\xe2\x80\x99s door, she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The spectacle-case forestalled me in giving you a lecture on sparing\r\nour nerves. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look so very full of compunction--it is only a trick\r\nwhich your mother would have stopped at five years old, and which you\r\ncan soon stop for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I will!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I hardly knew I did it, but I am very\r\nsorry it has teased you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThenceforward it was curious to see how he put down and pushed away all\r\nhe had once begun to touch and torture. Mrs. Edmonstone said it was\r\nself command in no common degree; and Philip allowed that to cure so\r\ninveterate a habit required considerable strength of will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I always gave the Morvilles credit for an iron\r\nresolution. Yes, Amy, you may laugh; but if a man is not resolute in a\r\nlittle, he will never be resolute in great matters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Guy has been resolute the right way this time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May he always be the same,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\nPhilip had undertaken, on his way back to Broadstone, to conduct\r\nCharlotte to East-hill, where she was to spend the day with a little\r\nniece of Mary Ross. She presently came down, her bonnet-strings tied\r\nin a most resolute-looking bow, and her little figure drawn up so as to\r\nlook as womanly is possible for her first walk alone with Philip. She\r\nwished the party at home \xe2\x80\x98goodbye;\xe2\x80\x99 and as Amy and Laura stood watching\r\nher, they could not help laughing to see her tripping feet striving to\r\nkeep step, her blue veil discreetly composed and her little head turned\r\nup, as if she was trying hard to be on equal terms with the tall cousin,\r\nwho meanwhile looked graciously down from his height, patronising her\r\nlike a very small child. After some space, Amy began to wonder what\r\nthey could talk about, or whether they would talk at all; but Laura said\r\nthere was no fear of Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s tongue ever being still, and Charles\r\nrejoined,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that Philip considers it due to himself that his\r\naudience should never be without conversation suited to their capacity?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, I give him credit for doing it as well as it is in nature of\r\nthings for it to be done. The strongest proof I know of his being a\r\nsuperior man, is the way he adapts himself to his company. He lays down\r\nthe law to us, because he knows we are all born to be his admirers; he\r\ncalls Thorndale his dear fellow and conducts him like a Mentor; but\r\nyou may observe how different he is with other people--Mr. Ross, for\r\ninstance. It is not showing off; it is just what the pattern hero should\r\nbe with the pattern clergyman. At a dinner party he is quite in his\r\nplace; contents himself with leaving an impression on his neighbour that\r\nMr. Morville is at home on every subject; and that he is the right thing\r\nwith his brother officers is sufficiently proved, since not even Maurice\r\neither hates or quizzes him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Charlie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, well pleased, I am glad you are convinced\r\nat last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think I ever wanted to be convinced that we were created for\r\nno other end than to applaud Philip? I was fulfilling the object of our\r\nexistence by enlarging on a remark of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s, that nothing struck him\r\nmore than the way in which Philip could adapt his conversation to the\r\nhearers. So the hint was not lost on me; and I came to the conclusion\r\nthat it was a far greater proof of his sense than all the maxims he\r\nlavishes on us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder Guy was the person to make the remark,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98for it is\r\nstrange that those two never appear to the best advantage together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Laura, that would be the very reason,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The very reason?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. Draw out your meaning, Miss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, colouring, \xe2\x80\x98If Guy--if a generous person, I mean--were\r\nvexed with another sometimes, it would be the very reason he would make\r\nthe most of all his goodness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heigh-ho!\xe2\x80\x99 yawned Charles. What o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it? I wonder when Guy is\r\never coming back from that Lascelles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your wonder need not last long,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98for I see him riding into\r\nthe stable yard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes he had entered; and, on being asked if he had met\r\nPhilip and Charlotte, and how they were getting on, he replied,--\xe2\x80\x98A good\r\ndeal like the print of Dignity and Impudence,\xe2\x80\x99 at the same time throwing\r\nback his shoulders, and composing his countenance to imitate Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlofty deportment and sedate expression, and the next moment putting his\r\nhead on one side with a sharp little nod, and giving a certain espiegle\r\nglance of the eye, and knowing twist of one corner of the mouth, just\r\nlike Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By the by,\xe2\x80\x99 added he, \xe2\x80\x98would Philip have been a clergyman if he had\r\ngone to Oxford?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was settled,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could never fancy him one\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98He would not have been what\r\nhe is now if he had gone to Oxford,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98He would have lived\r\nwith men of the same powers and pursuits with himself, and have found\r\nhis level.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that would have been a very high one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would; but there would be all the difference there is between a\r\nfeudal prince and an Eastern despot. He would know what it is to live\r\nwith his match.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to call him conceited!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, with a sort of\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is far above that; far too grand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should as soon think of calling Jupiter conceited,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; and\r\nLaura did not know how far to be gratified, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nCharles had not over-estimated Philip\xe2\x80\x99s readiness of self adaptation.\r\nCharlotte had been very happy with him, talking over the \xe2\x80\x9cLady of the\r\nLake\xe2\x80\x9d, which she had just read, and being enlightened, partly to\r\nher satisfaction, partly to her disappointment, as to how much was\r\nhistorical. He listened good-naturedly to a fit of rapture, and threw in\r\na few, not too many, discreet words of guidance to the true principles\r\nof taste; and next told her about an island, in a pond at Stylehurst,\r\nwhich had been by turns Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s isle and Robinson Crusoe\xe2\x80\x99s. It was at\r\nthis point in the conversation that Guy came in sight, riding slowly,\r\nhis reins on his horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck, whistling a slow, melancholy tune, his\r\neyes fixed on the sky, and so lost in musings, that he did not perceive\r\nthem till Philip arrested him by calling out, \xe2\x80\x98That is a very bad plan.\r\nNo horse is to be trusted in that way, especially such a spirited one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy started, and gathered up his reins, owning it was foolish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look only half disenchanted yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Has Lascelles put\r\nyou into what my father\xe2\x80\x99s old gardener used to call a stud?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing so worthy of a stud,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling and colouring a little.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was only dreaming over a picture of ruin--\r\n\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x98The steed is vanish\xe2\x80\x99d from the stall,\r\n                  No serf is seen in Hassan\xe2\x80\x99s hall,\r\n                  The lonely spider\xe2\x80\x99s thin grey pall\r\n                  Waves, slowly widening o\xe2\x80\x99er the wall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Byron!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I hope you are not dwelling on him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a volume I found in my room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, the \xe2\x80\x9cGiaour\xe2\x80\x9d!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Well, there is no great damage done;\r\nbut it is bad food for excitable minds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it get hold of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well;\xe2\x80\x99 and there was a cloud, but it cleared in a moment, and,\r\nwith a few gay words to both, he rode off at a quick pace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Foolish fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Philip, looking after him.\r\n\r\nAfter some space of silence, Charlotte began in a very grave tone--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother \xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 and another long pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether you\xe2\x80\x99ll be angry with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, marvelling at what was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy says he does not want to keep up the feud, and I wish you would\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The deadly feud!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What nonsense is this?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely--Oh Philip, there always was a deadly feud between our\r\nancestors, and the Redclyffe Morvilles, and it was very wrong, and ought\r\nnot to be kept up now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not I that keep it up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98But I am sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Guy. And I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t think why not, unless it is the deadly feud, for we are all so\r\nfond of him. Laura says it is a different house since he came.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hum!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Charlotte, you did well to make me promise not to\r\nbe angry with you, by which, I presume, you mean displeased. I should\r\nlike to know what put this notion into your head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlie told me,\xe2\x80\x99 almost whispered Charlotte, hanging down her head.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And--and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what? I can\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte was a good deal frightened; but either from firmness, or from\r\nthe female propensity to have the last word, or it might be the spirit\r\nof mischief, she got out--\xe2\x80\x98You have made me quite sure of it yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was so alarmed at having said this, that had it not been\r\nundignified, she would have run quite away, and never stopped till\r\nshe came to East-hill. Matters were not mended when Philip said\r\nauthoritatively, and as if he was not in the least bit annoyed (which\r\nwas the more vexatious), \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, Charlotte?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had a great mind to cry, by way of getting out of the scrape; but\r\nhaving begun as a counsellor and peacemaker, it would never do to be\r\nbabyish; and on his repeating the question, she said, in a tone which\r\nshe could not prevent from being lachrymose, \xe2\x80\x98You make Guy almost angry,\r\nyou tease him, and when people praise him, you answer as if it would not\r\nlast! And it is very unfair of you,\xe2\x80\x99 concluded she, with almost a sob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip, much more kindly than she thought she\r\ndeserved, after the reproach that seemed to her so dreadfully naughty,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you may dismiss all fear of deadly feud, whatever you may mean by it.\r\nCharles has been playing tricks on you. You know, my little cousin, that\r\nI am a Christian, and we live in the nineteenth century.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte felt as if annihilated at the aspect of her own folly. He\r\nresumed--\xe2\x80\x98You misunderstood me. I do think Guy very agreeable. He is\r\nvery attentive to Charles, very kind to you, and so attractive, that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wonder you like him. But those who are older than you see that he\r\nhas faults, and we wish to set him on his guard against them. It may be\r\npainful to ourselves, and irritating to him, but depend upon it, it is\r\nthe proof of friendship. Are you satisfied, my little cousin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could only say humbly, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need not ask pardon. Since you had the notion, it was right to\r\nspeak, as it was to me, one of your own family. When you are older, you\r\nneed never fear to speak out in the right place. I am glad you have\r\nso much of the right sort of feminine courage, though in this case you\r\nmight have ventured to trust to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo ended Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties respecting the deadly feud, and she had\r\nnow to make up her mind to the loss of her playfellow, who was to go to\r\nOxford at Easter, when he would be just eighteen, his birthday being the\r\n28th of March. Both her playmates were going, Bustle as well as Guy, and\r\nit was at first proposed that Deloraine should go too, but Guy bethought\r\nhimself that Oxford would be a place of temptation for William; and not\r\nchoosing to trust the horse to any one else, resolved to leave both at\r\nHollywell.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather had left an allowance for Guy, until his coming of age,\r\nsuch as might leave no room for extravagance, and which even Philip\r\npronounced to be hardly sufficient for a young man in his position. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nknow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, in his hesitating, good-natured way, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\never you have occasion sometimes for a little--a little more--you need\r\nonly apply to me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, anything rather than run into debt.\r\nYou know me, and \xe2\x80\x98tis your own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This shall do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, in the same tone as he had fixed his hours of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nEach of the family made Guy a birthday present, as an outfit for Oxford;\r\nMr. Edmonstone gave him a set of studs, Mrs. Edmonstone a Christian\r\nYear, Amabel copied some of his favourite songs, Laura made a drawing\r\nof Sintram, Charlotte worked a kettle-holder, with what was called by\r\ncourtesy a likeness of Bustle. Charles gave nothing, professing that he\r\nwould do nothing to encourage his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a bore it is to lose the one bit of quicksilver in\r\nthe house!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, yawning. \xe2\x80\x98I shall only drag on my existence till\r\nyou come back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You, Charles, the maker of fun!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, amazed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a case of flint and steel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98but be it owing to who\r\nit will, we have been alive since you came here. You have taken care\r\nto be remembered. We have been studying you, or laughing at you, or\r\nwondering what absurdity was to come next.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry--that is, if you are serious. I hoped at least I\r\nappeared like other people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what you appear like. Just what I would be if I was a\r\nfree man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never say that, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, wait a bit. I would never be so foolish. I would never give my\r\nsunny mornings to Euripides; I would not let the best hunter in the\r\ncounty go when I had wherewithal to pay for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not have such an ill-conditioned self to keep in rule.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Charles, yawning, \xe2\x80\x98it is no great compliment to\r\nsay I am sorry you are going. If you were an Ethiopian serenader, you\r\nwould be a loss to me. It is something to see anything beyond this old\r\ndrawing-room, and the same faces doing the same things every day. Laura\r\npoking over her drawing, and meditating upon the last entry in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemorandum-book, and Amy at her flowers or some nonsense or other,\r\nand Charlotte and the elders all the same, and a lot of stupid people\r\ndropping in and a lot of stupid books to read, all just alike. I can\r\ntell what they are like without looking in!\xe2\x80\x99 Charles yawned again,\r\nsighed, and moved wearily. \xe2\x80\x98Now, there came some life and freshness with\r\nyou. You talk of Redclyffe, and your brute creation there, not like\r\na book, and still less like a commonplace man; you are innocent and\r\nunsophisticated, and take new points of view; you are something to\r\ninterest oneself about; your coming in is something to look forward\r\nto; you make the singing not such mere milk-and-water, your reading the\r\nPraelectiones is an additional landmark to time; besides the mutton of\r\nto-day succeeding the beef of yesterday. Heigh-ho! I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\r\nGuy. Though I may carry it off with a high hand, \xe2\x80\x98tis no joke to be\r\na helpless log all the best years of a man\xe2\x80\x99s life,--nay, for my whole\r\nlife,--for at the very best of the contingencies the doctors are always\r\nflattering me with, I should make but a wretched crippling affair of it.\r\nAnd if that is the best hope they give me, you may guess it is likely to\r\nbe a pretty deal worse. Hope? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hoping these ten years, and much\r\ngood has it done me. I say, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 he proceeded, in a tone of extreme\r\nbitterness, though with a sort of smile, \xe2\x80\x98the only wonder is that I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t hate the very sight of you! There are times when I feel as if I\r\ncould bite some men,--that Tomfool Maurice de Courcy, for instance, when\r\nI hear him rattling on, and think--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know I have often talked thoughtlessly, I have feared afterwards I\r\nmight have given you pain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, you never have; you have carried me along with you. I like\r\nnothing better than to hear of your ridings, and shootings, and\r\nboatings. It is a sort of life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles had never till now alluded seriously to his infirmity before\r\nGuy, and the changing countenance of his auditor showed him to be\r\nmuch affected, as he stood leaning over the end of the sofa, with his\r\nspeaking eyes earnestly fixed on Charles, who went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now you are going to Oxford. You will take your place among the men\r\nof your day. You will hear and be heard of. You will be somebody. And\r\nI!--I know I have what they call talent--I could be something. They\r\nthink me an idle dog; but where\xe2\x80\x99s the good of doing anything? I only\r\nknow if I was not--not condemned to--to this--this life,\xe2\x80\x99 (had it not\r\nbeen for a sort of involuntary respect to the gentle compassion of the\r\nsoftened hazel eyes regarding him so kindly, he would have used the\r\nviolent expletive that trembled on his lip;) \xe2\x80\x98if I was not chained down\r\nhere, Master Philip should not stand alone as the paragon of the family.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve as much mother wit as he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That you have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98How fast you see the sense of a passage. You\r\ncould excel very much if you only tried.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tried?\xe2\x80\x99 And what am I to gain by it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that one ought to let talents rust,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nthoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is one\xe2\x80\x99s duty not; and surely it is a pity\r\nto give up those readings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall not get such another fellow dunce as you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98as I\r\ntold you when we began, and it would be a mere farce to do it alone. I\r\ncould not make myself, if I would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you make yourself do what you please?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, as if it was the\r\nsimplest thing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit, if the other half of me does not like it. I forget it, or\r\nput it off, and it comes to nothing. I do declare, though, I would get\r\nsomething to break my mind on, merely as a medical precaution, just to\r\nfreshen myself up, if I could find any one to do it with. No, nothing in\r\nthe shape of a tutor, against that I protest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your sisters,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hum\xe2\x80\x99! Laura is too intellectual already, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to poach on\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s manor; and if I made little Amy cease to be silly, I should do\r\naway with all the comfort I have left me in life. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, though,\r\nif she swallowed learning after Mary Ross\xe2\x80\x99s pattern, that it need do her\r\nmuch harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy came into the room at the moment. \xe2\x80\x98Amy, here is Guy advising me to\r\ntake you to read something awfully wise every day, something that will\r\nmake you as dry as a stick, and as blue--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As a gentianella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not mind being like a gentianella,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98But what\r\ndreadful thing were you setting him to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To make you read all the folios in my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s old library,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles. \xe2\x80\x98All that Margaret has in keeping against Philip has a house of\r\nhis own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sancho somebody, and all you talked of when first you came?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We were talking of the hour\xe2\x80\x99s reading that Charlie and I have had\r\ntogether lately,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking how Charlie would miss that hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98and we\r\nshall be very sorry not to have you to listen to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, Amy, suppose you read with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Charlie, thank you! Should you really like it?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy,\r\ncolouring with delight. \xe2\x80\x98I have always thought it would be so very\r\ndelightful if you would read with me, as James Ross used with Mary, only\r\nI was afraid of tiring you with my stupidity. Oh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo it was settled, and Charles declared that he put himself on honour to\r\ngive a good account of their doings to Guy, that being the only way of\r\nmaking himself steady to his resolution; but he was perfectly determined\r\nnot to let Philip know anything about the practice he had adopted,\r\nsince he would by no means allow him to guess that he was following his\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nCharles had certainly grown very fond of Guy, in spite of his propensity\r\nto admire Philip, satisfying himself by maintaining that, after all, Guy\r\nonly tried to esteem his cousin because he thought it a point of duty,\r\njust as children think it right to admire the good boy in a story book;\r\nbut that he was secretly fretted and chafed by his perfection. No one\r\ncould deny that there were often occasions when little misunderstandings\r\nwould arise, and that, but for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s coolness and Guy\xe2\x80\x99s readiness to\r\napologise they might often have gone further; but at the same time no\r\none could regret these things more than Guy himself, and he was willing\r\nand desirous to seek Philip\xe2\x80\x99s advice and assistance when needed. In\r\nespecial, he listened earnestly to the counsel which was bestowed on him\r\nabout Oxford: and Mrs. Edmonstone was convinced that no one could have\r\nmore anxiety to do right and avoid temptation. She had many talks\r\nwith him in her dressing-room, promising to write to him, as did also\r\nCharles; and he left Hollywell with universal regrets, most loudly\r\nexpressed by Charlotte, who would not be comforted without a lock of\r\nBustle\xe2\x80\x99s hair, which she would have worn round her neck if she had not\r\nbeen afraid that Laura would tell Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He goes with excellent intentions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, as they watched him\r\nfrom the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do hope he will do well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish he may,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98the agreeableness of his whole character\r\nmakes one more anxious. It is very dangerous. His name, his wealth, his\r\nsociable, gay disposition, that very attractive manner, all are so many\r\nperils, and he has not that natural pleasure in study that would be of\r\nitself a preservative from temptation. However, he is honestly anxious\r\nto do right, and has excellent principles. I only fear his temper and\r\nhis want of steadiness. Poor boy, I hope he may do well!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\n                    --Pray, good shepherd, what\r\n      Fair swain is this that dances with your daughter?\r\n        *         *         *         *          *\r\n      He sings several times faster than you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell money;\r\n      he utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      ears grow to his tunes.\r\n                                  --WINTER\xe2\x80\x99S TALE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day in June, the sky of pure deep dazzling blue, the\r\nsunshine glowing with brightness, but with cheerful freshness in the\r\nair that took away all sultriness, the sun tending westward in his\r\nlong day\xe2\x80\x99s career, and casting welcome shadows from the tall firs and\r\nhorse-chestnuts that shaded the lawn. A long rank of haymakers--men\r\nand women--proceeded with their rakes, the white shirt-sleeves, straw\r\nbonnets, and ruddy faces, radiant in the bath of sunshine, while in the\r\nshady end of the field were idler haymakers among the fragrant piles,\r\nCharles half lying on the grass, with his back against a tall haycock;\r\nMrs. Edmonstone sitting on another, book in hand; Laura sketching the\r\nbusy scene, the sun glancing through the chequered shade on her glossy\r\ncurls; Philip stretched out at full length, hat and neck-tie off,\r\nluxuriating in the cool repose after a dusty walk from Broadstone; and a\r\nlittle way off, Amabel and Charlotte pretending to make hay, but really\r\nbuilding nests with it, throwing it at each other, and playing as\r\nheartily as the heat would allow.\r\n\r\nThey talked and laughed, the rest were too hot, too busy, or too sleepy\r\nfor conversation, even Philip being tired into enjoying the \xe2\x80\x9cdolce far\r\nniente\xe2\x80\x9d; and they basked in the fresh breezy heat and perfumy hay with\r\nonly now and then a word, till a cold, black, damp nose was suddenly\r\nthrust into Charles\xe2\x80\x99s face, a red tongue began licking him; and at the\r\nsame moment Charlotte, screaming \xe2\x80\x98There he is!\xe2\x80\x99 raced headlong across\r\nthe swarths of hay, to meet Guy, who had just ridden into the field.\r\nHe threw Deloraine\xe2\x80\x99s rein to one of the haymakers, and came bounding to\r\nmeet her, just in time to pick her up as she put her foot into a hidden\r\nhole, and fell prostrate.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was in the midst of the whole party, who crowded\r\nround and welcomed him as if he had been a boy returning from his\r\nfirst half-year\xe2\x80\x99s schooling; and never did little school-boy look more\r\nholiday-like than he, with all the sunshine of that June day reflected,\r\nas it were, in his glittering eyes and glowing face, while Bustle\r\nescaping from Charles\xe2\x80\x99s caressing arm, danced round, wagging his tail\r\nin ecstasy, and claiming his share of the welcome. Then Guy was on\r\nthe ground by Charles, rejoicing to find him out there, and then, some\r\ndropping into their former nests on the hay, some standing round, they\r\ntalked fast and eagerly in a confusion of sound that did not subside for\r\nthe first ten minutes so as to allow anything to be clearly heard. The\r\nfirst distinct sentence was Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Bustle, darling old fellow, you\r\nare handsomer than ever!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a delicious day!\xe2\x80\x99 next exclaimed Guy, following Philip\xe2\x80\x99s example,\r\nby throwing off hat and neck-tie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A spontaneous tribute to the beauty of the day,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Really it is so ultra-splendid as to deserve notice!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\r\nthrowing himself completely back, and looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One cannot help revelling in that deep blue!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99ll be the happiest time of all the glad new year,\xe2\x80\x99 hummed Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah you will teach us all now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98after your grand singing\r\nlessons.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know what is in store for you, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! haven\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nheard about Lady Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s ball?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are to go, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98I am glad I am not. I hate\r\ndancing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I know as much about it as Bustle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, catching the dog by\r\nhis forepaws, and causing him to perform an uncouth dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, they will soon teach you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must I really go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He begins to think it serious,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Philip going?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy, looking as if he was taken by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is going to say something about dancing being a healthful recreation\r\nfor young people,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be disappointed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98It is much too hot to moralize.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Apollo unbends his bow,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles. \xe2\x80\x98The captain yields the\r\nfield.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Captain Morville, I ought to have congratulated you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nmust come to Broadstone early enough to see you on parade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to Broadstone! You aren\xe2\x80\x99t still bound to Mr. Lascelles,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he has time for me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I am too far behind the rest of the\r\nworld to afford to be idle this vacation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Philip, sitting up, and looking full of\r\napproval. \xe2\x80\x98With so much perseverance, you must get on at last. How did\r\nyou do in collections?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tolerably, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must be able to enter into the thing now,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Philip. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nare you reading?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thucydides.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you come to Pericles\xe2\x80\x99 oration? I must show you some notes that I\r\nhave on that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you get into the spirit of it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Up-hill work still,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy, disentangling some cinders from the\r\nsilky curls of Bustle\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which do you like best--that or the ball?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The hay-field best of all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, releasing Bustle, and blinding\r\nhim with a heap of hay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98who would not like hay-making better than\r\nthat stupid ball?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Charlotte!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; commiseration which irritated\r\nCharlotte into standing up and protesting,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma, you know I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more do I, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 said her brother, in a mock consoling tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You and I know what is good for us, and despise sublunary vanities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you will go, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98Philip is really going.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In spite of Lord Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s folly in going to such an expense as either\r\ntaking Allonby or giving the ball,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is my business to bring Lord Kilcoran to a sense of\r\nhis folly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I made all my protests to Maurice when first\r\nhe started the notion, but if his father chose to take the matter up, it\r\nis no concern of mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will understand, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that this ball is specially\r\ngot up by Maurice for Laura\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Believe as little as you please of that speech, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98the\r\ntruth is that Lord Kilcoran is very good-natured, and Eveleen was very\r\nmuch shocked to hear that Amy had never been to any ball, and I to only\r\none, and so it ended in their giving one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When is it to be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On Thursday week,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I wonder if you will think Eveleen as\r\npretty as we do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is Laura\xe2\x80\x99s great friend, is not she?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like her very much; I have known her all my life, and she has much\r\nmore depth than those would think who only know her manner.\xe2\x80\x99 And Laura\r\nlooked pleadingly at Philip as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are there any others of the family at home?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The two younger girls, Mabel and Helen, and the little boys,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord de Courcy is in Ireland, and all the others are away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord de Courcy is the wisest man of the family, and sets his face\r\nagainst absenteeism,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98so he is never visible here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to despise it, I hope, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, earnestly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it will be so delightful! And what fun we shall have in teaching you to\r\ndance!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy stretched himself, and gave a quaint grunt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98very little is required. You may easily\r\npass in the crowd. I never learnt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your ear will guide you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And no one can stay at home, since Mary Ross is going,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eveleen was always so fond of her, that she came and forced a promise\r\nfrom her by telling her she should come with mamma, and have no\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not seen Allonby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98There are such Vandykes, and\r\namong them, such a King Charles!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is not that the picture,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98before which Amy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O don\xe2\x80\x99t, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was found dissolved in tears?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not help it,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Amy, blushing crimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is all Charles\xe2\x80\x99s fate in his face,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,--\xe2\x80\x98earnest,\r\nmelancholy, beautiful! It would stir the feelings--were it an unknown\r\nportrait. No, Amy, you need not be ashamed of your tears.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Amy turned away, doubly ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it is not in the ball-room,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98it is in the library.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte, whose absence had become perceptible from the general\r\nquietness, here ran up with two envelopes, which she put into Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. One contained Lady Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s genuine card of invitation for Sir\r\nGuy Morville, the other Charlotte had scribbled in haste for Mr. Bustle.\r\n\r\nThis put an end to all rationality. Guy rose with a growl and a roar,\r\nand hunted her over half the field, till she was caught, and came back\r\nout of breath and screaming, \xe2\x80\x98We never had such a haymaking!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I think the haymakers will say!\xe2\x80\x99 answered her mother, rising to go\r\nindoors. \xe2\x80\x98What ruin of haycocks!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll set all that to rights,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, seizing a hay-fork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop, take care!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be built up in\r\nthe rick, and by and by, when my disconsolate family have had all the\r\nponds dragged for me, Deloraine will be heard to complain that they give\r\nhim very odd animal food.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who could resist such a piteous appeal!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, helping him to rise,\r\nand conducting him to his wheeled chair. The others followed, and when,\r\nshortly after, Laura looked out at her window, she saw Guy, with his\r\ncoat off, toiling like a real haymaker, to build up the cocks in all\r\ntheir neat fairness and height, whistling meantime the \xe2\x80\x98Queen of the\r\nMay,\xe2\x80\x99 and now and then singing a line. She watched the old cowman come\r\nup, touching his hat, and looking less cross than usual; she saw Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nready greeting, and perceived they were comparing the forks and rakes,\r\nthe pooks and cocks of their counties; and, finally, she beheld her\r\nfather ride into the field, and Guy spring to meet him.\r\n\r\nNo one could have so returned to what was in effect a home, unless his\r\ntime had been properly spent; and, in fact, all that Mr. Edmonstone or\r\nPhilip could hear of him, was so satisfactory, that Philip pronounced\r\nthat the first stage of the trial had been passed irreproachably, and\r\nLaura felt and looked delighted at this sanction to the high estimation\r\nin which she held him.\r\n\r\nHis own account of himself to Mrs. Edmonstone would not have been\r\nequally satisfactory if she had not had something else to check it with.\r\nIt was given by degrees, and at many different times, chiefly as they\r\nwalked round the garden in the twilight of the summer evenings, talking\r\nover the many subjects mentioned in the letters which had passed\r\nconstantly. It seemed as if there were very few to whom Guy would ever\r\ngive his confidence; but that once bestowed, it was with hardly any\r\nreserve, and that was his great relief and satisfaction to pour out his\r\nwhole mind, where he was sure of sympathy.\r\n\r\nTo her, then, he confided how much provoked he was with himself, his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98first term,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98having only shown him what an intolerable fool\r\nhe had to keep in order.\xe2\x80\x99 By his account, he could do nothing \xe2\x80\x98without\r\nturning his own head, except study, and that stupefied it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Never was\r\nthere a more idle fellow; he could work himself for a given time, but\r\nhis sense would not second him; and was it not most absurd in him to\r\ntake so little pleasure in what was his duty, and enjoy only what was\r\nbad for him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had tried boating, but it had distracted him from his work; so he had\r\nbeen obliged to give it up, and had done so in a hasty vehement manner,\r\nwhich had caused offence, and for which he blamed himself. It had\r\nbeen the same with other things, till he had left himself no regular\r\nrecreation but walking and music. \xe2\x80\x98The last,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98might engross\r\nhim in the same way; but he thought (here he hesitated a little) there\r\nwere higher ends for music, which made it come under Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrule, of a thing to be used guardedly, not disused.\xe2\x80\x99 He had resumed\r\nlight reading, too, which he had nearly discontinued before he went to\r\nOxford. \xe2\x80\x98One wants something,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98by way of refreshment, where\r\nthere is no sea nor rock to look at, and no Laura and Amy to talk to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had made one friend, a scholar of his own college, of the name of\r\nWellwood. This name had been his attraction; Guy was bent on friendship\r\nwith him; if, as he tried to make him out to be, he was the son of that\r\nCaptain Wellwood whose death had weighed so heavily on his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconscience, feeling almost as if it were his duty to ask forgiveness in\r\nhis grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s name, yet scarcely knowing how to venture on advances\r\nto one to whom his name had such associations. However, they had\r\ngradually drawn together, and at length entered on the subject, and Guy\r\nthen found he was the nephew, not the son of Captain Wellwood; indeed,\r\nhis former belief was founded on a miscalculation, as the duel had\r\ntaken place twenty-eight years ago. He now heard all his grandfather had\r\nwished to know of the family. There were two unmarried daughters, and\r\ntheir cousin spoke in the highest terms of their self-devoted life,\r\npromising what Guy much wished, that they should hear what deep\r\nrepentance had followed the crime which had made them fatherless. He was\r\nto be a clergyman, and Guy admired him extremely, saying, however, that\r\nhe was so shy and retiring, it was hard to know him well.\r\n\r\nFrom not having been at school, and from other causes, Guy had made few\r\nacquaintance; indeed, he amused Mrs. Edmonstone by fearing he had been\r\nmorose. She was ready to tell him he was an ingenious self-tormentor;\r\nbut she saw that the struggle to do right was the main spring of\r\nthe happiness that beamed round him, in spite of his self-reproach,\r\nheart-felt as it was. She doubted whether persons more contented with\r\nthemselves were as truly joyous, and was convinced that, while thus\r\ncombating lesser temptations, the very shadow of what are generally\r\nalone considered as real temptations would hardly come near him.\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for these talks, and now and then a thoughtful look,\r\nshe would have believed him one of the most light-hearted and merriest\r\nof beings. He was more full of glee and high spirits than she had ever\r\nseen him; he seemed to fill the whole house with mirth, and keep every\r\none alive by his fun and frolic, as blithe and untiring as Maurice de\r\nCourcy himself, though not so wild.\r\n\r\nVery pleasant were those summer days--reading, walking, music,\r\ngardening. Did not they all work like very labourers at the new arbour\r\nin the midst of the laurels, where Charles might sit and see the spires\r\nof Broadstone? Work they did, indeed! Charles looking on from his\r\nwheeled chair, laughing to see Guy sawing as if for his living and Amy\r\nhammering gallantly, and Laura weaving osiers, and Charlotte flying\r\nabout with messages.\r\n\r\nOne day, they were startled by an exclamation from Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, ha!\r\nPaddy, is that you?\xe2\x80\x99 and beheld the tall figure of a girl, advancing\r\nwith a rapid, springing step, holding up her riding habit with one hand,\r\nwith the other whisking her coral-handled whip. There was something\r\ndistinguished in her air, and her features, though less fine than\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s, were very pretty, by the help of laughing dark blue eyes, and\r\nvery black hair, under her broad hat and little waving feather. She\r\nthreatened Charles with her whip, calling out--\xe2\x80\x98Aunt Edmonstone said I\r\nshould find you here. What is the fun now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arbour building,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you see the head carpenter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered she to Laura, looking up at him, where he was\r\nmounted on the roof, thatching it with reed, the sunshine full on his\r\nglowing face and white shirt sleeves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, as Guy swung himself down with a bound, his face\r\nmuch redder than sun and work had already made it, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s another wild\r\nIrisher for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy Morville--Lady Eveleen de Courcy,\xe2\x80\x99 began Laura; but Lady\r\nEveleen cut her short, frankly holding out her hand, and saying, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nare almost a cousin, you know. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t leave off. Do give me something\r\nto do. That hammer, Amy, pray--Laura, don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how dearly I\r\nalways loved hammering?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you come?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With papa--\xe2\x80\x98tis his visit to Sir Guy. \xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x99 as Guy began to\r\nlook for his coat; \xe2\x80\x98he is only impending. He is gone on to Broadstone,\r\nbut he dropped me here, and will pick me up on his way back. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ngive me something to do on the top of that ladder? I should like it\r\nmightily; it looks so cool and airy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you, Eva?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Laura, reprovingly; but Lady Eveleen only\r\nshook her head at her, and declaring she saw a dangerous nail sticking\r\nout, began to hammer it in with such good will, that Charles stopped his\r\nears, and told her it was worse than her tongue. \xe2\x80\x98Go on about the ball,\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said she earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98do you think there is any hope of Captain\r\nMorville\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so glad! That is what papa is gone to Broadstone about. Maurice\r\nsaid he had given him such a lecture, that he would not be the one to\r\nthink of asking him, and papa must do it himself; for if he sets his\r\nface against it, it will spoil it all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may make your mind easy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98the captain is lenient,\r\nand looks on the ball as a mere development of Irish nature. He has been\r\nconsoling Guy on the difficulties of dancing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you dance?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Eveleen, looking at him with compassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such is my melancholy ignorance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have been talking of teaching him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Talk! will that do it?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Lady Eveleen, springing up. \xe2\x80\x98We will\r\nbegin this moment. Come out on the lawn. Here, Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 wheeling him\r\nalong, \xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, I like it,\xe2\x80\x99 as Guy was going to help her. \xe2\x80\x98There,\r\nCharles, be fiddler go on, tum-tum, tee! that\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Amy, Laura, be\r\nladies. I\xe2\x80\x99m the other gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 and she stuck on her hat in military\r\nstyle, giving it a cock. She actually set them quadrilling in spite of\r\nadverse circumstances, dancing better, in her habit, than most people\r\nwithout one, till Lord Kilcoran arrived.\r\n\r\nWhile he was making his visit, she walked a little apart, arm-in-arm\r\nwith Laura. \xe2\x80\x98I like him very much,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98he looks up to anything.\r\nI had heard so much of his steadiness, that it is a great relief to my\r\nmind to see him so unlike his cousin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eveleen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No disparagement to the captain, only I am so dreadfully afraid of him.\r\nI am sure he thinks me such an unmitigated goose. Now, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you would but take the right way to make him think otherwise, dear\r\nEva, and show the sense you really have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is just what my fear of him won\xe2\x80\x99t let me do. I would not for the\r\nworld let him guess it, so there is nothing for it but sauciness to\r\ncover one\xe2\x80\x99s weakness. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be sensible with those that won\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nme credit for it. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll mind and teach Sir Guy to dance; he has so\r\nmuch spring in him, he deserves to be an Irishman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this injunction, there used to be a clearance\r\nevery evening; Charles turned into the bay window out of the way, Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone at the piano, and the rest figuring away, the partnerless\r\none, called \xe2\x80\x98puss in the corner\xe2\x80\x99, being generally Amabel, while\r\nCharlotte, disdaining them all the time, used to try to make them\r\nimitate her dancing-master\xe2\x80\x99s graces, causing her father to perform such\r\ncaricatures of them, as to overpower all with laughing.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was half Irish. His mother, Lady Mabel Edmonstone, had\r\nnever thoroughly taken root in England, and on his marriage, had gone\r\nwith her daughter to live near her old home in Ireland. The present Earl\r\nof Kilcoran was her nephew, and a very close intercourse had always been\r\nkept up between the families, Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone being adopted by\r\ntheir younger cousins as uncle and aunt, and always so called.\r\n\r\nThe house at Allonby was in such confusion, that the family there\r\nexpected to dine nowhere on the day of the ball, and the Hollywell party\r\nthought it prudent to secure their dinner at home, with Philip and Mary\r\nRoss, who were to go with them.\r\n\r\nBy special desire, Philip wore his uniform; and while the sisters were\r\ndressing Charlotte gave him a thorough examination, which led to a talk\r\nbetween him and Mary on accoutrements and weapons in general; but while\r\ndeep in some points of chivalrous armour, Mary\xe2\x80\x99s waist was pinched\r\nby two mischievous hands, and a little fluttering white figure danced\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Amy! what do you want with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come and be trimmed up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you told me I was to have no trouble. I am dressed,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMary, looking complacently at her full folds of white muslin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more you shall; but you promised to do as you were told.\xe2\x80\x99 And Amy\r\nfluttered away with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98the comparison of Rose Flammock\r\ndragging off her father, to a little carved cherub trying to uplift a\r\nsolid monumental hero?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I must tell Mary!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte; but Philip stopped her, with\r\norders not to be a silly child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a pity Amy should not have her share,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The comparison to a Dutch cherub?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is more after the pattern of the little things on little wings, in\r\nyour blotting-book,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98certain lines in the predicament of\r\nthe cherubs of painters--heads \xe2\x80\x9cet proeterea nihil\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Guy, do you write verses? cried Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Guy, out of countenance; \xe2\x80\x98I thought I had made\r\naway with that rubbish; where is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the blotting-book in my room,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I must explain that\r\nthe book is my property, and was put into your room when mamma was\r\nbeautifying it for you, as new and strange company. On its return to me,\r\nat your departure, I discovered a great accession of blots and sailing\r\nvessels, beside the aforesaid little things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall resume my own property,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, departing in haste.\r\n\r\nCharlotte ran after him, to beg for a sight of it; and Philip asked\r\nCharles what it was like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A romantic incident,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98just fit for a novel. A Petrarch\r\nleaving his poems about in blotting-books.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles used the word Petrarch to stand for a poet, not thinking what\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s name he suggested; and he was surprised at the severity of\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s tone as he inquired, \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean anything, or do you not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerceiving with delight that he had perplexed and teased, he rejoiced in\r\nkeeping up the mystery:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? is it a tender subject with you, too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip rose, and standing over him, said, in a low but impressive tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell whether you are trifling or not; but you are no boy now,\r\nand can surely see that this is no subject to be played with. If you are\r\nconcealing anything you have discovered, you have a great deal to answer\r\nfor. I can hardly imagine anything more unfortunate than that he should\r\nbecome attached to either of your sisters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Et pourquoi?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charles, coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, retreating to his chair, and speaking with great\r\ncomposure, \xe2\x80\x98I did you injustice by speaking seriously.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, as his\r\nuncle came into the room, he asked some indifferent question, without\r\nbetraying a shade of annoyance.\r\n\r\nCharles meanwhile congratulated himself on his valour in keeping his\r\ncounsel, in spite of so tall a man in scarlet; but he was much nettled\r\nat the last speech, for if a real attachment to his sister had been\r\nin question, he would never have trifled about it. Keenly alive to his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s injustice, he rejoiced in having provoked and mystified the\r\nimpassable, though he little knew the storm he had raised beneath that\r\nserene exterior of perfect self-command.\r\n\r\nThe carriages were announced, and Mr. Edmonstone began to call the\r\nladies, adding tenfold to the confusion in the dressing-room. There was\r\nLaura being completed by the lady\xe2\x80\x99s maid, Amabel embellishing Mary, Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone with her arm loaded with shawls, Charlotte flourishing about.\r\nPoor Mary--it was much against her will--but she had no heart to refuse\r\nthe wreath of geraniums that Amy\xe2\x80\x99s own hands had woven for her; and\r\nthere she sat, passive as a doll, though in despair at their all waiting\r\nfor her. For Laura\xe2\x80\x99s toilette was finished, and every one began dressing\r\nher at once; while Charlotte, to make it better, screamed over the\r\nbalusters that all were ready but Mary. Sir Guy was heard playing the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Harmonious Blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x99 and Captain Morville\xe2\x80\x99s step was heard, fast and\r\nfirm. At last, when a long chain was put round her neck, she cried out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have submitted to everything so far; I can bear no more!\xe2\x80\x99 jumped\r\nup, caught hold of her shawl, and was putting it on, when there was a\r\ngeneral outcry that they must exhibit themselves to Charles.\r\n\r\nThey all ran down, and Amy, flying up to her brother, made a splendid\r\nsweeping curtsey, and twirled round in a pirouette.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Got up, regardless of expense!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles; \xe2\x80\x98display yourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young ladies ranged themselves in imitation of the book of fashions.\r\nThe sisters were in white, with wreaths of starry jessamine. It was\r\nparticularly becoming to Laura\xe2\x80\x99s bella-donna lily complexion, rich brown\r\ncurls, and classical features, and her brother exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura is exactly like Apollo playing the lyre, outside mamma\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nmanuscript book of music.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has not Amy made beautiful wreaths?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98She stripped the\r\ntree, and Guy had to fetch the ladder, to gather the sprays on the top\r\nof the wall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you see your bit of myrtle, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, pointing to it, on\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s head, \xe2\x80\x98that you tried to persuade me would pass for jessamine?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! it should have been all myrtle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\nPhilip leant meantime against the door. Laura only once glanced towards\r\nhim, thinking all this too trifling for him, and never imagining the\r\nintense interest with which he gave a meaning to each word and look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done, Mary!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles, \xe2\x80\x98they have furbished you up\r\nhandsomely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary made a face, and said she should wonder who was the fashionable\r\nyoung lady she should meet in the pier-glasses at Allonby. Then Mr.\r\nEdmonstone hurried them away, and they arrived in due time.\r\n\r\nThe saloon at Allonby was a beautiful room, one end opening into a\r\nconservatory, full of coloured lamps, fresh green leaves, and hot-house\r\nplants. There they found as yet only the home party, the good-natured,\r\nmerry Lord Kilcoran, his quiet English wife, who had bad health, and\r\nlooked hardly equal to the confusion of the evening; Maurice, and two\r\nyounger boys; Eveleen, and her two little sisters, Mabel and Helen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This makes it hard on Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Amy, while the two girls\r\ndragged her off to show her the lamps in the conservatory; and the rest\r\nattacked Mrs. Edmonstone for not having brought Charlotte, reproaching\r\nher with hardness of heart of which they had never believed her\r\ncapable--Lady Eveleen, in especial, talking with that exaggeration of\r\nher ordinary manner which her dread of Captain Morville made her assume.\r\nLittle he recked of her; he was absorbed in observing how far Laura\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct coincided with Charles\xe2\x80\x99s hints. On the first opportunity, he\r\nasked her to dance, and was satisfied with her pleased acquiescence;\r\nbut the next moment Guy came up, and in an eager manner made the same\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am engaged,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with a bright, proud glance at Philip; and Guy\r\npursued Amabel into the conservatory, where he met with better success.\r\nMr. Edmonstone gallantly asked Mary if he was too old a partner, and was\r\nsoon dancing with the step and spring that had once made him the best\r\ndancer in the county.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone watched her flock, proud and pleased, thinking how well\r\nthey looked and that, in especial, she had never been sensible how much\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s good looks excelled the rest of the world. They\r\nwere much alike in the remarkable symmetry both of figure and feature,\r\nthe colour of the deep blue eye, and fairness of complexion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is curious,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98that, so very handsome as\r\nPhilip is, it is never the first thing remarked about him, just as his\r\nheight never is observed till he is compared with other people. The fact\r\nis, that his superior sense carries off a degree of beauty which\r\nwould be a misfortune to most men. It is that sedate expression and\r\ndistinguished air that make the impression. How happy Laura looks, how\r\ngracefully she moves. No, it is not being foolish to think no one equal\r\nto Laura. My other pair!\xe2\x80\x99 and she smiled much more; \xe2\x80\x98you happy young\r\nthings, I would not wish to see anything pleasanter than your merry\r\nfaces. Little Amy looks almost as pretty as Laura, now she is lighted\r\nup by blush and smile, and her dancing is very nice, it is just like her\r\nlaughing, so quiet, and yet so full of glee. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she is less\r\ngraceful than her sister, but the complete enjoyment strikes one more.\r\nAnd as to enjoyment--there are those bright eyes of her partner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nperfectly sparkling with delight; he looks as if it was a world of\r\nenchantment to him. Never had any one a greater capacity for happiness\r\nthan Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone might well retain her opinion when, after the quadrille,\r\nGuy came to tell her that he had never seen anything so delightful; and\r\nhe entertained Mary Ross with his fresh, joyous pleasure, through the\r\nnext dance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Eveleen, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve one ambition. Do you guess it? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell him; but if he would, I should have a better opinion of myself ever\r\nafter. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll depreciate me to his friend; and really with Mr.\r\nThorndale, I was no more foolish than a ball requires.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLady Eveleen hoped in vain. Captain Morville danced with little Lady\r\nHelen, a child of eleven, who was enchanted at having so tall a partner;\r\nthen, after standing still for some time, chose his cousin Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are a good partner and neighbour,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, giving her his arm,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t want young lady talk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should you not have asked Mary? She has been sitting down this long\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think she cares for such a sport as dancing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been well off. You were dancing with Thorndale just now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. It was refreshing to have an old acquaintance among so many\r\nstrangers. And he is so delighted with Eveleen; but what is more,\r\nPhilip, that Mr. Vernon, who is dancing with Laura, told Maurice he\r\nthought her the prettiest and most elegant person here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura might have higher praise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98for hers is beauty of\r\ncountenance even more than of feature. If only--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look round, Amy, and you will see many a face which speaks of intellect\r\nwasted, or, if cultivated, turned aside from its true purpose, like the\r\ndouble blossom, which bears leaves alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you forget you are talking to silly little Amy. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see all\r\nthat. I had rather think people as happy and good as they look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep your child-like temper as long as you can--all your life,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nperhaps, for this is one of the points where it is folly to be wise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you only meant things in general? Nothing about Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Things in general,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Philip; \xe2\x80\x98bright promises blighted or\r\nthrown away--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut he spoke absently, and his eye was following Laura. Amy thought he\r\nwas thinking of his sister, and was sorry for him. He spoke no more, but\r\nshe did not regret it, for she could not moralize in such a scene, and\r\nthe sight and the dancing were pleasure enough.\r\n\r\nGuy, in the meantime, had met an Oxford acquaintance, who introduced him\r\nto his sisters--pretty girls--whose father Mr. Edmonstone knew, but\r\nwho was rather out of the Hollywell visiting distance. They fell into\r\nconversation quickly, and the Miss Alstons asked him with some interest,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Which was the pretty Miss Edmonstone?\xe2\x80\x99 Guy looked for the sisters, as\r\nif to make up his mind, for the fact was, that when he first knew Laura\r\nand Amy, the idea of criticising beauty had not entered his mind, and\r\nto compare them was quite a new notion. \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said he at last, \xe2\x80\x98if you\r\ncannot discover for yourselves when they are both before your eyes, I\r\nwill do nothing so invidious as to say which is _the_ pretty one. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell which is the eldest and which the youngest, but the rest you must\r\ndecide for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to know them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Alston. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! they are both very\r\nnice-looking girls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, that is Laura--Miss Edmonstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98that tall young\r\nlady, with the beautiful hair and jessamine wreath.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke as if he was proud of her, and had a property in her. The tone\r\ndid not escape Philip, who at that moment was close to them, with Amy\r\non his arm; and, knowing the Alstons slightly, stopped and spoke, and\r\nintroduced his cousin, Miss Amabel Edmonstone. At the same time Guy took\r\none of the Miss Alstons away to get some tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you knew my cousin at Oxford?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, to the brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, slightly. What an amusing fellow he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is something very bright, very unlike other people about him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Miss Alston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How does he get on? Is he liked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes, I should say so, on the whole; but it is rather as my sister\r\nsays, he is not like other people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In what respect?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh I can hardly tell. He is a very pleasant person, but he ought to\r\nhave been at school. He is a man of crotchets.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hard-working?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very; he makes everything give way to that. He is a capital companion\r\nwhen he is to be had, but he lives very much to himself. He is a man of\r\none friend, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother dance began, Mr. Alston went to look for his partner, Philip and\r\nAmy moved on in search of ice. \xe2\x80\x98Hum!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip to himself, causing\r\nAmy to gaze up at him, but he was musing too intently for her to venture\r\non a remark. She was thinking that she did not wonder that strangers\r\ndeemed Guy crotchety, since he was so difficult to understand; and then\r\nshe considered whether to take him to see King Charles, in the library,\r\nand concluded that she would wait, for she felt as if the martyr king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface would look on her too gravely to suit her present tone.\r\n\r\nPhilip helped her to ice, and brought her back to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneighbourhood without many more words. He then stood thoughtful for some\r\ntime, entered into conversation with one of the elder gentlemen, and,\r\nwhen that was interrupted, turned to talk to his aunt.\r\n\r\nLady Eveleen and her two cousins were for a moment together. \xe2\x80\x98What is\r\nthe matter, Eva?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, seeing a sort of dissatisfaction on her\r\nbright face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The roc\xe2\x80\x99s egg?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98The queen of the evening can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ncontent--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; you are the queen, if the one thing can make you so--the one thing\r\nwanting to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How absurd you are, Eva--when you say you are so afraid of him, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the very reason. I should get a better opinion of myself!\r\nBesides, there is nobody else so handsome. I declare I\xe2\x80\x99ll make a bold\r\nattempt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you don\xe2\x80\x99t think of such a thing,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura, very much shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never fear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen, \xe2\x80\x98faint heart, you know.\xe2\x80\x99 And with a nod, a\r\nflourish, of her bouquet, and an arch smile at her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s horror,\r\nshe moved on, and presently they heard her exclaiming, gaily, \xe2\x80\x98Captain\r\nMorville, I really must scold you. You are setting a shocking example\r\nof laziness! Aunt Edmonstone, how can you encourage such proceedings!\r\nIndolence is the parent of vice, you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled just as much as the occasion required, and answered, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nbeg your pardon, I had forgotten my duty. I\xe2\x80\x99ll attend to my business\r\nbetter in future.\xe2\x80\x99 And turning to a small, shy damsel, who seldom met\r\nwith a partner, he asked her to dance. Eveleen came back to Laura with\r\na droll disappointed gesture. \xe2\x80\x98Insult to injury,\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\ndisconsolately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98he could not have thought you wanted to dance\r\nwith him, or you would not have gone to stir him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, he was very obtuse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides, you are engaged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, to Mr. Thorndale! But who would be content with the squire when\r\nthe knight disdains her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Thorndale came to claim Eveleen at that moment. It was the second\r\ntime she had danced with him, and it did not pass unobserved by Philip,\r\nnor the long walk up and down after the dance was over. At length his\r\nfriend came up to him and said something warm in admiration of her.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very Irish,\xe2\x80\x99 was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s answer, with a cold smile, and Mr.\r\nThorndale stood uncomfortable under the disapprobation, attracted by\r\nEveleen\xe2\x80\x99s beauty and grace, yet so unused to trust his own judgment\r\napart from \xe2\x80\x98Morville\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 as to be in an instant doubtful whether he\r\nreally admired or not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not been dancing with her?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: she attracts too many to need the attention of a nobody like\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat \xe2\x80\x98too many,\xe2\x80\x99 seeming to confound him with the vulgar herd, made Mr.\r\nThorndale heartily ashamed of having been pleased with her.\r\n\r\nPhilip was easy about him for the present, satisfied that admiration had\r\nbeen checked, which, if it had been allowed to grow into an attachment,\r\nwould have been very undesirable.\r\n\r\nThe suspicions Charles had excited were so full in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s mind,\r\nhowever, that he could not as easily set it at rest respecting his\r\ncousin. Guy had three times asked her to dance, but each time she had\r\nbeen engaged. At last, just as the clock struck the hour at which the\r\ncarriage had been ordered, he came up, and impetuously claimed her. \xe2\x80\x98One\r\nquadrille we must have, Laura, if you are not tired?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! Oh, no! I could dance till this time to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We ought to be going,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O pray, Mrs. Edmonstone, this one more,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98Laura\r\nowes me this one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, this one more, mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, and they went off together,\r\nwhile Philip remained, in a reverie, till requested by his aunt to see\r\nif the carriage was ready.\r\n\r\nThe dance was over, the carriage was waiting, but Guy and Laura did not\r\nappear till, after two or three minutes spent in wonder and inquiries,\r\nthey came quietly walking back from the library, where they had been\r\nlooking at King Charles.\r\n\r\nAll the way home the four ladies in the carriage never ceased laughing\r\nand talking. The three gentlemen in theirs acted diversely. Mr.\r\nEdmonstone went to sleep, Philip sat in silent thought, Guy whistled\r\nand hummed the tunes, and moved his foot very much as if he was still\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\nThey met for a moment, and parted again in the hall at Hollywell, where\r\nthe daylight was striving to get in through the closed shutters. Philip\r\nwent on to Broadstone, Guy said he could not go to bed by daylight,\r\ncalled Bustle, and went to the river to bathe, and the rest crept\r\nupstairs to their rooms. And so ended Lord Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\n     Like Alexander, I will reign,\r\n     And I will reign alone,\r\n     My thoughts shall ever more disdain\r\n     A rival near my throne.\r\n     But I must rule and govern still,\r\n     And always give the law,\r\n     And have each subject at my will,\r\n     And all to stand in awe.\r\n                         --MONTROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne very hot afternoon, shortly after the ball, Captain Morville walked\r\nto Hollywell, accelerating his pace under the influence of anxious\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nHe could not determine whether Charles had spoken in jest; but in spite\r\nof Guy\xe2\x80\x99s extreme youth, he feared there was ground for the suspicion\r\nexcited by the hint, and was persuaded that such an attachment could\r\nproduce nothing but unhappiness to his cousin, considering how little\r\nconfidence could be placed in Guy. He perceived that there was much to\r\ninspire affection--attractive qualities, amiable disposition, the talent\r\nfor music, and now this recently discovered power of versifying, all\r\nwere in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s favour, besides the ancient name and long ancestry, which\r\nconferred a romantic interest, and caused even Philip to look up to him\r\nwith a feudal feeling as head of the family. There was also the familiar\r\nintercourse to increase the danger; and Philip, as he reflected on these\r\nthings, trembled for Laura, and felt himself her only protector; for his\r\nuncle was nobody, Mrs. Edmonstone was infatuated, and Charles would not\r\nlisten to reason. To make everything worse, he had that morning\r\nheard that there was to be a grand inspection of the regiment, and a\r\npresentation of colours; Colonel Deane was very anxious; and it was\r\nplain that in the interval the officers would be allowed little\r\nleisure. The whole affair was to end with a ball, which would lead to a\r\nrepetition of what had already disturbed him.\r\n\r\nThus meditating, Philip, heated and dusty, walked into the smooth green\r\nenclosure of Hollywell. Everything, save the dancing clouds of\r\ninsect youth which whirled in his face, was drooping in the heat. The\r\nhouse--every door and window opened--seemed gasping for breath; the\r\ncows sought refuge in the shade; the pony drooped its head drowsily; the\r\nleaves hung wearily; the flowers were faint and thirsty; and Bustle was\r\nstretched on the stone steps, mouth open, tongue out, only his tail now\r\nand then moving, till he put back his ears and crested his head to greet\r\nthe arrival. Philip heard the sounds that had caused the motion of the\r\nsympathizing tail--the rich tones of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Stepping over the dog,\r\nhe entered, and heard more clearly--\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98Two loving hearts may sever,\r\n           For sorrow fails them never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then another voice--\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98Who knows not love in sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s night,\r\n           He knows not love in light.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room, cool and comfortable in the green shade of the\r\nVenetian blinds of the bay window, stood Laura, leaning on the piano,\r\nclose to Guy, who sat on the music-stool, looking thoroughly at home in\r\nhis brown shooting-coat, and loosely-tied handkerchief.\r\n\r\nAny one but Philip would have been out of temper, but he shook hands\r\nas cordially as usual, and would not even be the first to remark on the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nLaura told him he looked hot and tired, and invited him to come out to\r\nthe others, and cool himself on the lawn. She went for her parasol, Guy\r\nran for her camp stool, and Philip, going to the piano, read what they\r\nhad been singing. The lines were in Laura\xe2\x80\x99s writing, corrected, here and\r\nthere, in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n           BE STEADFAST.\r\n\r\n           Two loving hearts may sever,\r\n           Yet love shall fail them never.\r\n           Love brightest beams in sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s night,\r\n           Love is of life the light.\r\n\r\n           Two loving hearts may sever,\r\n           Yet hope shall fail them never.\r\n           Hope is a star in sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s night,\r\n           Forget-me-not of light.\r\n\r\n           Two loving hearts may sever,\r\n           Yet faith may fail them never.\r\n           Trust on through sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s night,\r\n           Faith is of love and hope the light.\r\n\r\n           Two loving hearts may sever,\r\n           For sorrow fails them never.\r\n           Who knows not love in sorrow\xe2\x80\x99s night,\r\n           He knows not love in light.\r\n\r\nPhilip was by no means pleased. However, it was in anything but a\r\nsentimental manner that Guy, looking over him, said, \xe2\x80\x98For sever, read,\r\nbe separated, but \xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9d wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rhyme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I translated it into prose, and Guy made it verse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98I hope\r\nyou approve of our performance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is that thing of Helmine von Chezy, \xe2\x80\x9cBeharre\xe2\x80\x9d, is it not?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip, particularly civil, because he was so much annoyed. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nrendered the spirit very well\xe2\x80\x99, but you have sacrificed a good deal to\r\nyour double rhymes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; those last lines are not troubled with any equality of feet,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy; \xe2\x80\x98but the repetition is half the beauty. It put me in mind of those\r\nlines of Burns--\r\n\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cHad we never loved so kindly,\r\n           Had we never loved so blindly,\r\n           Never met and never parted,\r\n           We had ne\xe2\x80\x99er been broken hearted;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nbut there is a trust in these that is more touching than that despair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; the despair is ready, to wish the love had never been,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura. \xe2\x80\x98It does not see the star of trust. Why did you use that word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d only once, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not want to lose the three--faith, hope, love,--faith keeping the\r\nother two alive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My doubt was whether it was right to have that analogy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x98that analogy must be the best part of\r\nearthly love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Charlotte came to see if Guy and Laura meant to sing all the\r\nafternoon; and they went out. They found the others in the arbour,\r\nand Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s histories of its construction, gave Philip little\r\nsatisfaction. They next proceeded to talk over the ball.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98balls are the fashion just now. What do you say,\r\nAmy, [he was more inclined to patronize her than any one else] to the\r\ngaieties we are going to provide for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You! Are you going to have your new colours? Oh! you are not going to\r\ngive us a ball?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! that is fun!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy. \xe2\x80\x98What glory Maurice de Courcy must be\r\nin!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is gone to Allonby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98to announce it; saying, he must\r\npersuade his father to put off their going to Brighton. Do you think he\r\nwill succeed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98poor Lady Kilcoran was so knocked up by their\r\nball, that she is the more in want of sea air. Oh, mamma, Eva must come\r\nand stay here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That she must,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98that will make it easy. She is\r\nthe only one who will care about the ball.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was obliged to conceal his vexation, and to answer the many eager\r\nquestions about the arrangements. He stayed to dinner, and as the others\r\nwent in-doors to dress, he lingered near Charlotte, assuming, with some\r\ndifficulty, an air of indifference, and said--\xe2\x80\x98Well, Charlotte, did you\r\ntease Guy into showing you those verses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, with what the French call \xe2\x80\x9cun air capable\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what were they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. They were very pretty; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve promised.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Promised what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never to say anything about them. He made it a condition with me, and I\r\nassure you, I am to be trusted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be of no use,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, shaking her head, as if she\r\nwished he would prove her further.\r\n\r\nPhilip was in hopes of being able to speak to Laura after dinner,\r\nbut his uncle wanted him to come and look over the plans of an estate\r\nadjoining Redclyffe, which there was some idea of purchasing. Such an\r\nemployment would in general have been congenial; but on this occasion,\r\nit was only by a strong force that he could chain his attention, for\r\nGuy was pacing the terrace with Laura and Amabel, and as they passed and\r\nrepassed the window, he now and then caught sounds of repeating poetry.\r\n\r\nIn this Guy excelled. He did not read aloud well; he was too rapid, and\r\neyes and thoughts were apt to travel still faster than the lips, thus\r\nproducing a confusion; but no one could recite better when a passage had\r\ntaken strong hold of his imagination, and he gave it the full effect\r\nof the modulations of his fine voice, conveying in its inflections the\r\nimpressions which stirred him profoundly. He was just now enchanted\r\nwith his first reading of \xe2\x80\x98Thalaba,\xe2\x80\x99 where he found all manner of deep\r\nmeanings, to which the sisters listened with wonder and delight. He\r\nrepeated, in a low, awful, thrilling tone, that made Amy shudder, the\r\nlines in the seventh book, ending with--\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cWho comes from the bridal chamber!\r\n           It is Azrael, angel of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not been so taken up with any book since Sintram.\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is like Sintram,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it seems to me. A strife with the powers of darkness; the victory,\r\nforgiveness, resignation, death.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cThou know\xe2\x80\x99st the secret wishes of my heart,\r\n           Do with me as thou wilt, thy will is best.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would not speak as if you were Thalaba yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you bring the whole Domdaniel round us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid he is going to believe himself Thalaba as well as Sintram,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Laura. \xe2\x80\x98But you know Southey did not see all this himself, and did\r\nnot understand it when it was pointed out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell us that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay; I think there is something striking in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy then, with a\r\nsudden transition, \xe2\x80\x98but is not this ball famous?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd their talk was of balls and reviews till nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when they\r\nwere summoned to tea.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Philip returned to Broadstone by no means comforted.\r\n\r\nNever had he known so much difficulty in attending with patience to his\r\nduties as in the course of the next fortnight. They became a greater\r\ndurance, as he at length looked his feelings full in the face, and\r\nbecame aware of their true nature.\r\n\r\nHe perceived that the loss of Laura would darken his whole existence;\r\nyet he thought that, were he only secure of her happiness, he could have\r\nresigned her in silence. Guy was, however, one of the last men in the\r\nworld whom he could bear to see in possession of her; and probably\r\nshe was allowing herself to be entangled, if not in heart, at least in\r\nmanner. If so, she should not be unwarned. He had been her guide from\r\nchildhood, and he would not fail her now.\r\n\r\nThree days before the review, he succeeded in finding time for a walk to\r\nHollywell, not fully decided on the part he should act, though resolved\r\non making some remonstrance. He was crossing a stile, about a mile and a\r\nhalf from Hollywell, when he saw a lady sitting on the stump of a tree,\r\nsketching, and found that fate had been so propitious as to send Laura\r\nthither alone. The rest had gone to gather mushrooms on a down, and had\r\nleft her sketching the view of the spires of Broadstone, in the cleft\r\nbetween the high green hills. She was very glad to see him, and held up\r\nher purple and olive washes to be criticised; but he did not pay much\r\nattention to them. He was almost confused at the sudden manner in which\r\nthe opportunity for speaking had presented itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a long time since I have seen you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98An unheard-of time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Still longer since we have had any conversation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was just thinking so. Not since that hot hay-making, when Guy came\r\nhome. Indeed, we have had so much amusement lately that I have hardly\r\nhad time for thought. Guy says we are all growing dissipated.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! your German, and dancing, and music, do not agree with thought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor music!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98But I am ready for a lecture; I have\r\nbeen feeling more like a butterfly than I like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you think me unjust about music, and I freely confess that I\r\ncannot estimate the pleasure it affords, but I doubt whether it is a\r\nsafe pleasure. It forms common ground for persons who would otherwise\r\nhave little in common, and leads to intimacies which occasion results\r\nnever looked for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, receiving it as a general maxim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, you complain of feeling like a butterfly. Is not that a sign\r\nthat you were made for better things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what can I do? I try to read early and at night, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprevent the fun and gaiety; and, indeed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would. It is\r\ninnocent, and we never had such a pleasant summer. Charlie is so--so\r\nmuch more equable, and mamma is more easy about him, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nthinking it does them all good, though I do feel idle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is innocent, it is right for a little while,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but your\r\ndissatisfaction proves that you are superior to such things. Laura, what\r\nI fear is, that this summer holiday may entangle you, and so fix your\r\nfate as to render your life no holiday. O Laura take care; know what you\r\nare doing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What am I doing?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura, with an alarmed look of ingenuous\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nNever had it been so hard to maintain his composure as now, when her\r\nsimplicity forced him to come to plainer terms. \xe2\x80\x98I must speak,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x98because no one else will. Have you reflected whither this\r\nmay tend? This music, this versifying, this admitting a stranger so\r\nunreservedly into your pursuits?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe understood now, and hung her head. He would have given worlds to\r\njudge of the face hidden by her bonnet; but as she did not reply,\r\nhe spoke on, his agitation becoming so strong, that the struggle was\r\nperceptible in the forced calmness of his tone. \xe2\x80\x98I would not say a word\r\nif he were worthy, but Laura--Laura, I have seen Locksley Hall acted\r\nonce; do not let me see it again in a way which--which would give me\r\ninfinitely more pain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe faltering of his voice, so resolutely subdued, touched, her\r\nextremely, and a thrill of exquisite pleasure glanced through her, on\r\nhearing confirmed what she had long felt, that she had taken Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace--nay, as she now learnt, that she was even more precious to him.\r\nShe only thought of reassuring him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you need never fear _that_. He has no such thought, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe blushed deeply, but looked in his face. \xe2\x80\x98He treats us both alike,\r\nbesides, he is so young.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The mischief is not done,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, trying to resume his usual\r\ntone; \xe2\x80\x98I only meant to speak in time. You might let your manner go too\r\nfar; you might even allow your affections to be involved without knowing\r\nit, if you were not on your guard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; I could never dream of that with Guy. I\r\nlike Guy very much; I think better of him than you do; but oh no; he\r\ncould never be my first and best; I could never care for him in _that_\r\nway. How could you think so, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, I cannot but look on you with what may seem over-solicitude.\r\nSince I lost Fanny, and worse than lost Margaret, you have been my\r\nhome; my first, my most precious interest. O Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 and he did not even\r\nattempt to conceal the trembling and tenderness of his voice, \xe2\x80\x98could I\r\nbear to lose you, to see you thrown away or changed--you, dearest, best\r\nof all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura did not turn away her head this time, but raising her beautiful\r\nface, glowing with such a look as had never beamed there before, while\r\ntears rose to her eyes, she said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of my changing towards\r\nyou. I never could; for if there is anything to care for in me, it is\r\nyou that have taught it to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf ever face plainly told another that he was her first and best,\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s did so now. Away went misgivings, and he looked at her in\r\nhappiness too great for speech, at least, he could not speak till he\r\nhad mastered his emotion, but his countenance was sufficient reply. Even\r\nthen, in the midst of this flood of ecstasy, came the thought, \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nhave I done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had gone further than he had ever intended. It was a positive avowal\r\nof love; and what would ensue? Cessation of intercourse with her,\r\nendless vexations, the displeasure of her family, loss of influence,\r\ncontempt, and from Mr. Edmonstone, for the pretensions of a penniless\r\nsoldier. His joy was too great to be damped, but it was rendered\r\ncautious. \xe2\x80\x98Laura, my own!\xe2\x80\x99 (what delight the words gave her,) \xe2\x80\x98you have\r\nmade me very happy. We know each other now, and trust each other for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, yes; nothing can alter what has grown up with us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is for ever!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Philip. \xe2\x80\x98But, Laura, let us be content with\r\nour own knowledge of what we are to each other. Do not let us call in\r\nothers to see our happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura looked surprised, for she always considered any communication\r\nabout his private feelings too sacred to be repeated, and wondered he\r\nshould think the injunction necessary. \xe2\x80\x98I never can bear to talk about\r\nthe best kinds of happiness,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98but oh!\xe2\x80\x99 and she sprang up,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98here they come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Edmonstone, as she walked back from her mushroom-field, she\r\nlittle guessed that words had been spoken which would give the colouring\r\nto her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s whole life--she little guessed that her much-loved and\r\nesteemed nephew had betrayed her confidence! As she and the girls came\r\nup, Philip advanced to meet them, that Laura might have a few moments to\r\nrecover, while with an effort he kept himself from appearing absent in\r\nthe conversation that ensued. It was brief, for having answered some\r\nquestions with regard to the doings on the important day, he said, that\r\nsince he had met them he would not come on to Hollywell, and bade them\r\nfarewell, giving Laura a pressure of the hand which renewed the glow on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nHe walked back, trying to look through the dazzling haze of joy so as\r\nto see his situation clearly. It was impossible for him not to perceive\r\nthat there had been an absolute declaration of affection, and that he\r\nhad established a private understanding with his cousin. It was not,\r\nhowever, an engagement, nor did he at present desire to make it so.\r\nIt was impossible for him as yet to marry, and he was content to wait\r\nwithout a promise, since that could not add to his entire reliance on\r\nLaura. He could not bear to be rejected by her parents: he knew his\r\npoverty would be the sole ground of objection, and he was not asking her\r\nto share it. He believed sincerely that a long, lingering attachment to\r\nhimself would be more for her good than a marriage with one who would\r\nhave been a high prize for worldly aims, and was satisfied that by\r\nwinning her heart he had taken the only sure means of securing her from\r\nbecoming attached to Guy, while secrecy was the only way of preserving\r\nhis intercourse with her on the same footing, and exerting his influence\r\nover the family.\r\n\r\nIt was calmly reflected, for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s love was tranquil, though deep and\r\nsteady, and the rather sought to preserve Laura as she was than to\r\nmake her anything more; and this very calmness contributed to his\r\nself-deception on this first occasion that he had ever actually swerved\r\nfrom the path of right.\r\n\r\nWith an uncomfortable sensation, he met Guy riding home from his tutor,\r\nentirely unsuspicious. He stopped and talked of the preparations at\r\nBroadstone, where he had been over the ground with Maurice de Courcy,\r\nand had heard the band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What did you think of it? said Philip, absently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They _should_ keep better time! Really, Philip, there is one fellow\r\nwith a bugle that ought to be flogged every day of his life!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nmaking a droll, excruciated face.\r\n\r\nHow a few words can change the whole current of ideas. The band was\r\nconnected with Philip, therefore he could not bear to hear it found\r\nfault with, and adduced some one\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that the man in question was\r\none of the best of their musicians.\r\n\r\nGuy could not help shrugging his shoulders, as he laughed, and\r\nsaid,--\xe2\x80\x98Then I shall be obliged to take to my heels if I meet the rest.\r\nGood-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How conceited they have made that boy about his fine ear,\xe2\x80\x99 thought\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x98I wonder he is not ashamed to parade his music, considering\r\nwhence it is derived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9\r\n\r\n      Ah! county Guy, the hour is nigh,\r\n      The sun has left the lea,\r\n      The orange flower perfumes the bower,\r\n      The breeze is on the sea.\r\n      The lark, his lay, who thrilled all day,\r\n      Sits hushed, his partner nigh,\r\n      Breeze, bird, and flower, confess the hour,\r\n      But where is county Guy?\r\n                                --SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\nHow was it meantime with Laura? The others were laughing and talking\r\nround her, but all seemed lost in the transcendent beam that had shone\r\nout on her. To be told by Philip that she was all to him that he had\r\nalways been to her! This one idea pervaded her--too glorious, too happy\r\nfor utterance, almost for distinct thought. The softening of his voice,\r\nand the look with which he had regarded her, recurred again and again,\r\nstartling her with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the first\r\nmoment. Of the future Laura thought not. Never had a promise of love\r\nbeen made with less knowledge of what it amounted to: it seemed merely\r\nan expression of sentiments that she had never been without; for had she\r\nnot always looked up to Philip more than any other living creature,\r\nand gloried in being his favourite cousin? Ever since the time when\r\nhe explained to her the plates in the Encyclopaedia, and made her read\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joyce\xe2\x80\x99s Scientific Dialogues,\xe2\x80\x99 when Amy took fright at the first page.\r\nThat this might lead further did not occur to her; she was eighteen,\r\nshe had no experience, not even in novels, she did not know what she\r\nhad done; and above all, she had so leant to surrender her opinions\r\nto Philip, and to believe him always right, that she would never have\r\ndreamt of questioning wherever he might choose to lead her. Even the\r\ncaution of secrecy did not alarm her, though she wondered that he\r\nthought it required, safe as his confidence always was with her. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone had been so much occupied by Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness, as to have\r\nbeen unable to attend to her daughters in their girlish days; and in\r\nthe governess\xe2\x80\x99s time the habit had been disused of flying at once to her\r\nwith every joy or grief. Laura\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were not easy of access, and\r\nPhilip had long been all in all to her. She was too ignorant of life to\r\nperceive that it was her duty to make this conversation known; or, more\r\ntruly, she did not awaken her mind to consider that anything could be\r\nwrong that Philip desired.\r\n\r\nOn coming home, she ran up to her own room, and sitting by the open\r\nwindow, gave herself up to that delicious dream of new-found joy.\r\n\r\nThere she still sat when Amy came in, opening the door softly, and\r\ntreading lightly and airily as she entered, bringing two or three roses\r\nof different tints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura! not begun to dress?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I answer you according to what Philip calls my note of time, and\r\ntell you the pimpernels are closed, and the tigridias dropping their\r\nleaves? It would be a proper answer for you; you look as if you were in\r\nFairy Land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is papa come home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Long ago! and Guy too. Why, where could you have been, not to have\r\nheard Guy and Eveleen singing the Irish melodies?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a trance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, starting up, and laughing, with a slight\r\ndegree of constraint, which caused Amy, who was helping her to dress, to\r\nexclaim, \xe2\x80\x98Has anything happened, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What should have happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess, unless the fairies in the great ring on Ashendown came\r\nto visit you when we were gone. But seriously, dear Laura, are you sure\r\nyou are not tired? Is nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing at all, thank you. I was only thinking over the talk I had with\r\nPhilip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy never thought of entering into Philip\xe2\x80\x99s talks with Laura, and was\r\nperfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nBy this time Laura was herself again, come back to common life, and\r\nresolved to watch over her intercourse with Guy; since, though she was\r\nconvinced that all was safe at present, she had Philip\xe2\x80\x99s word for it\r\nthat there might be danger in continuing the pleasant freedom of their\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more reassuring than Guy\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour. His head seemed\r\nentirely full of the Thursday, and of a plan of his own for enabling\r\nCharles to go to the review. It had darted into his head while he was\r\ngoing over the ground with Maurice. It was so long since Charles had\r\nthought it possible to attempt any amusement away from home, and former\r\nexperiments had been so unsuccessful, that it had never even occurred\r\nto him to think of it; but he caught at the idea with great delight and\r\neagerness. Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say; she had much\r\nrather that it had not been proposed; yet it was very kind of Guy, and\r\nCharles was so anxious about it that she knew not how to oppose him.\r\n\r\nShe could not bear to have Charles in a crowd, helpless as he was; and\r\nshe had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occasion when they had\r\ntaken him to a flower-show, where they had lost, first Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nnext the carriage, and lastly, Amy and Charlotte--all had been\r\nfrightened, and Charles laid up for three days from the fatigue.\r\n\r\nAnswers, however, met each objection. Charles was much stronger; Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narm would be ready for him; Guy would find the carriage. Philip would\r\nbe there to help, besides Maurice; and whenever Charles was tired, Guy\r\nwould take him home at once, without spoiling any one\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except your own,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; but this would be so delightful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98it would be as great a triumph as the dog\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\ncaught the hare with the clog round his neck--the dog\xe2\x80\x99s, I mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will but trust me with him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, turning on her all the\r\npleading eloquence of his eyes, \xe2\x80\x98you know he can get in and out of the\r\npony-carriage quite easily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As well as walk across the room,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would drive him in it, and tell William to ride in and be at hand to\r\nhold the pony or take it out; and the tent is so near, that you could\r\nget to the breakfast, unless the review had been enough for you. I\r\npaced the distance to make sure, and it is no further than from the\r\ngarden-door to the cherry-tree.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And William shall be in waiting to bring the pony the instant you are\r\nready, and we can go home independently of every one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98that you were to go to the\r\nmess-dinner--what is to become of that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that will be simply a bore, and he may rejoice to be\r\nexcused from going the whole hog.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, I had rather dine in peace at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was not happy, but she had great confidence in Guy; and\r\nher only real scruple was, that she did not think it fair to occupy him\r\nentirely with attendance on her son. She referred it to papa, which, as\r\nevery one knew, was the same as yielding the point, and consoled herself\r\nby the certainty that to prevent it would be a great disappointment to\r\nboth the youths. Laura was convinced that to achieve the adventure of\r\nCharles at the review, was at present at least a matter of far more\r\nprominence with Guy than anything relating to herself.\r\n\r\nAll but Laura and her mother were wild about the weather, especially\r\non Wednesday, when there was an attempt at a thunder storm. Nothing was\r\nstudied but the sky; and the conversation consisted of prognostications,\r\nreports of rises and falls of the glass, of the way weather-cocks were\r\nturning, or about to turn, of swallows flying high or low, red sunsets,\r\nand halos round the moon, until at last Guy, bursting into a merry\r\nlaugh, begged Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s pardon for being such a nuisance, and\r\nmade a vow, and kept it, that be the weather what it might, he would say\r\nnot another word about it that evening; it deserved to be neglected, for\r\nhe had not been able to settle to anything all day.\r\n\r\nHe might have said for many days before; for since the last ball, and\r\nstill more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell, it had been one\r\nround of merriment and amusement. Scrambling walks, tea-drinkings out\r\nof doors, dances among themselves, or with the addition of the Harpers,\r\nwere the order of the day. Amy, Eveleen, and Guy, could hardly come into\r\nthe room without dancing, and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing\r\nbut waltzes, polkas, and now and then an Irish jig, for the special\r\nbenefit of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s ears. The morning was almost as much spent\r\nin mirth as the afternoon, for the dawdlings after breakfast, and before\r\nluncheon, had a great tendency to spread out and meet, there was new\r\nmusic and singing to be practised, or preparations made for evening\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiversion, or councils to be held, which Laura\xe2\x80\x99s absence could not break\r\nup, though it often made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Laura\r\nwas than herself. Eveleen said the same, but she was visiting, and\r\nit was a time to be idle; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same\r\nopinion with regard to his pupil; for, when Guy was vexed at not having\r\ndone as much work as usual, he only laughed at him for expecting to be\r\nable to go to balls, and spend a summer of gaiety, while he studied as\r\nmuch as at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThursday morning was all that heart could wish, the air cooled by the\r\nthunder, and the clouds looking as if raining was foreign to their\r\nnature. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, their daughters, and Lady Eveleen,\r\nwere packed inside and outside the great carriage, while Guy, carefully\r\nsettling Charles in the low phaeton, putting in all that any one\r\nrecommended, from an air-cushion to an umbrella, flourished his whip,\r\nand drove off with an air of exultation and delight.\r\n\r\nEverything went off to admiration. No one was more amused than Charles.\r\nThe scene was so perfectly new and delightful to one accustomed to such\r\na monotonous life, that the very sight of people was a novelty. Nowhere\r\nwas there so much laughing and talking as in that little carriage, and\r\nwhenever Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s anxious eye fell upon it, she always saw\r\nCharles sitting upright, with a face so full of eager interest as to\r\nbanish all thought of fatigue. Happy, indeed, he was. He enjoyed the\r\nsurprise of his acquaintance at meeting him; he enjoyed Dr. Mayerne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaugh and congratulation; he enjoyed seeing how foolish Philip thought\r\nhim, nodding to his mother and sisters, laughing at the dreadful faces\r\nGuy could not help making at any particularly discordant note of the\r\noffensive bugle; and his capabilities rising with his spirits, he did\r\nall that the others did, walked further than he had done for years, was\r\nlifted up steps without knowing how, sat out the whole breakfast, talked\r\nto all the world, and well earned the being thoroughly tired, as he\r\ncertainly was when Guy put him into the carriage and drove him home, and\r\nstill more so when Guy all but carried him up stairs, and laid him on\r\nthe sofa in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nHowever, his mother announced that it would have been so unnatural if\r\nhe had not been fatigued, that she should have been more anxious, and\r\nleaving him to repose, they all, except Mr. Edmonstone, who had stayed\r\nto dine at the mess, sat down to dinner.\r\n\r\nAmy came down dressed just as the carriage had been announced, and found\r\nLaura and Eveleen standing by the table, arranging their bouquets, while\r\nGuy, in the dark, behind the piano, was playing--not, as usual, in such\r\ncases, the Harmonious Blacksmith, but a chant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is mamma ready?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nearly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98but I wish she was not obliged to go! I am sure she\r\ncannot bear to leave Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope she is not going on my account,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98we must go; it would so frighten papa if we did not\r\ncome. Besides, there is nothing to be uneasy about with Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98she says so, only she is always anxious, and she is\r\nafraid he is too restless to go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must get home as fast as we can; if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, Eva,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura, remembering how her last dance with Guy had delayed them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I do any good to Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, ceasing his music. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not go!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the girls in consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is joking!\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen. \xe2\x80\x98But, I declare!\xe2\x80\x99 added she, advancing\r\ntowards him, \xe2\x80\x98he is not dressed! Come, nonsense, this is carrying it too\r\nfar; you\xe2\x80\x99ll make us all too late, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll set Maurice at you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid it is no joke,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must go. It will never do for you to stay away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura,\r\ndecidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you tired? Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you well?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite well, thank you, but I am sure I had better not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura thought she had better not seem anxious to take him, so she left\r\nthe task of persuasion, to the others, and Amy went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Neither Mamma nor Charlie could bear to think you stayed because of\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I assure you, Amy. I meant it before. I have been gradually\r\nfinding out that it must come to this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, you think it a matter of right and wrong! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t think balls\r\nwrong?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no; only they won\xe2\x80\x99t do for such an absurd person as I am. The last\r\nturned my head for a week, and I am much too unsteady for this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if you think it a matter of duty, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy\r\nsorrowfully; \xe2\x80\x98but I am very sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, thinking it compassion, not regret; \xe2\x80\x98but I shall\r\ndo very well. I shall be all the happier to-morrow for a quiet hour at\r\nmy Greek, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me all the fun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You liked it so much!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but you have made up your mind and I\r\nought not to tease you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right Amy; he does it on purpose to be teased,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and I never knew anybody so provoking. Mind, Sir Guy, if you make us\r\nall too late, you shan\xe2\x80\x99t have the ghost of a quadrille with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall console myself by quadrilling with Andromache,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, no nonsense--off to dress directly! How can you have the\r\nconscience to stand there when the carriage is at the door?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall have great pleasure in handing you in when you are ready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura--Amy! Does he really mean it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid he does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\nEveleen let herself fall on the sofa as if fainting. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98take him away! Let me never see the face of him again! I\xe2\x80\x99m perfectly\r\novercome! All my teaching thrown away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how do you mean to face Maurice?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him his first bugle has so distracted me that I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer for\r\nthe consequences if I come to-night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Edmonstone came in, saying,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, I have kept you waiting shamefully, but I have been consoling\r\nmyself by thinking you must be well entertained, as I heard no\r\nHarmonious Blacksmith. Papa will be wondering where we are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, mamma! Guy won\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy! is anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing, thank you, only idleness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This will never do. You really must go, Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed! I think not. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t order me, Mrs. Edmonstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it, Amy? Past ten! Papa will be in despair! What is to\r\nbe done? How long do you take to dress, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not under an hour,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! But if there was time I should certainly send you.\r\nSelf-discipline may be carried too far, Guy. But now it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhelped--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to keep papa waiting any longer. Laura, what\r\nshall I do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me go to Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I can read him to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; but don\xe2\x80\x99t talk, or he will be too excited. Reading would be\r\nthe very thing! It will be a pretty story to tell every one who asks for\r\nyou that I have left you to nurse my son!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, for no such good reason,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98only because I am a great\r\nfool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir Guy, I am glad you can say one sensible word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady\r\nEveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too true, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, as he handed her in. \xe2\x80\x98Good night!\r\nYou will keep the quadrille for me till I am rational.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe handed the others in, and shut the door. Mrs. Edmonstone, ruffled out\r\nof her composure, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, this is provoking!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every one will be vexed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be so stupid,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I give him up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen. \xe2\x80\x98I once had hopes of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it was not for papa, I really would turn back this moment and fetch\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Edmonstone, starting forward. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will give\r\noffence. I wish I had not consented.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t be made to see that his presence is of importance to any\r\nliving creature,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the reason of this whim?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Eveleen, it is not whim,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98it is because he thinks\r\ndissipation makes him idle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if he is idle I wonder what the rest of the world is!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nEveleen. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure we all ought to stay at home too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I know I shall feel all night as if I was wrong\r\nto be there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am angry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98and yet I believe it is a great\r\nsacrifice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mamma; after all our looking forward to it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand her voice lost its piteous tone, \xe2\x80\x98it is a real sacrifice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he was not a mere boy, I should say a lover\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel was at the\r\nbottom of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen. \xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it, Laura, it is all your\r\nfault. You only danced once with him at our ball, and all this week you\r\nhave played for us, as if it was on purpose to cut him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura was glad of the darkness, and her mother, who had a particular\r\ndislike to jokes of this sort, went on,--\xe2\x80\x98If it were only ourselves I\r\nshould not care, but there are so many who will fancy it caprice, or\r\nworse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only comfort is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98that it is Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s gain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope they will not talk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98But Charlie will\r\nnever hold his tongue. He will grow excited, and not sleep all night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Edmonstone! her trials did not end here, for when she replied\r\nto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry for Guy, Mr. Edmonstone said offence had\r\nalready been taken at his absence from the dinner; he would not have had\r\nthis happen for fifty pounds; she ought not to have suffered it; but it\r\nwas all her nonsense about Charles, and as to not being late, she should\r\nhave waited till midnight rather than not have brought him. In short,\r\nhe said as much more than he meant, as a man in a pet is apt to say, and\r\nnevertheless Mrs. Edmonstone had to look as amiable and smiling as if\r\nnothing was the matter.\r\n\r\nThe least untruthful answer she could frame to the inquiries for Sir Guy\r\nMorville was, that young men were apt to be lazy about balls, and\r\nthis sufficed for good-natured Mrs. Deane, but Maurice poured out many\r\nexclamations about his ill-behaviour, and Philip contented himself with\r\nthe mere fact of his not being there, and made no remark.\r\n\r\nLaura turned her eyes anxiously on Philip. They had not met since the\r\nimportant conversation on Ashen-down, and she found herself looking with\r\nmore pride than ever at his tall, noble figure, as if he was more her\r\nown; but the calmness of feeling was gone. She could not meet his eye,\r\nnor see him turn towards her without a start and tremor for which she\r\ncould not render herself a reason, and her heart beat so much that it\r\nwas at once a relief and a disappointment that she was obliged to accept\r\nher other cousin as her first partner. Philip had already asked Lady\r\nEveleen, for he neither wished to appear too eager in claiming Laura,\r\nnor to let his friend think he had any dislike to the Irish girl.\r\n\r\nEveleen was much pleased to have him for her partner, and told herself\r\nshe would be on her good behaviour. It was a polka, and there was not\r\nmuch talk, which, perhaps, was all the better for her. She admired the\r\nreview, and the luncheon, and spoke of Charles without any sauciness,\r\nand Philip was condescending and agreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must indulge myself in abusing that stupid cousin of yours!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe. Did you ever know a man of such wonderful crotchets?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a very unexpected one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It came like a thunder clap. I thought till the last moment he was\r\njoking, for he likes dancing so much; he was the life of our ball, and\r\nhow could any one suppose he would fly off at the last moment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He seems rather to enjoy doing things suddenly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell Laura she has affronted him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98She has\r\nbeen always busy of late when we have wanted her; and I assure her his\r\npride has been piqued. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that is an explanation, Captain\r\nMorville?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was Captain Morvilles belief, but he would not say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Laura looking lovely?\xe2\x80\x99 Eveleen went on. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure she is\r\nthe beauty of the night!\xe2\x80\x99 She was pleased to see Captain Morville\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattention gained. \xe2\x80\x98She is even better dressed than at our ball--those\r\nVenetian pins suit the form of her head so well. Her beauty is better\r\nthan almost any one\xe2\x80\x99s, because she has so much countenance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How proud Maurice looks of having her on his arm. Does not he? Poor\r\nMaurice! he is desperately in love with her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As is shown by his pining melancholy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEveleen laughed with her clear hearty laugh. \xe2\x80\x98I see you know what we\r\nmean by being desperately in love! No,\xe2\x80\x99 she added more gravely, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nvery glad it is only _that_ kind of desperation. One could not think of\r\nMaurice and Laura together. He does not know the best part of Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEveleen was highly flattered by Captain Morville conducting her a second\r\ntime round the room, instead of at once restoring her to her aunt.\r\n\r\nHe secured Laura next, and leading her away from her own party, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, have you been overdoing it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, wishing she could keep from blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the only motive that could excuse his extraordinary behaviour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely you know he says that he is growing unsettled. It is part of his\r\nrule of self discipline.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Absurd!--exaggerated!--incredible! This is the same story as there was\r\nabout the horse. It is either caprice or temper, and I am convinced\r\nthat some change in your manner--nay, I say unconscious, and am far from\r\nblaming you--is the cause. Why else did he devote himself to Charles,\r\nand leave you all on my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hands in the crowd?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We could shift for ourselves much better than Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This confirms my belief that my warning was not mistimed. I wish it\r\ncould have been done without decidedly mortifying him and rousing his\r\ntemper, because I am sorry others should be slighted; but if he takes\r\nyour drawing back so much to heart, it shows that it was time you should\r\ndo so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I thought I had!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was visible to others--to another, I should say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, that is only Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense! The only difference I am conscious\r\nof having made, was keeping more up-stairs, and not trying to persuade\r\nhim to come here to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt it was this that turned the scale, He only waited for\r\npersuasion, and you acted very wisely in not flattering his self-love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did I?--I did not know it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct is often better than reasoning, Laura; to do the\r\nright thing without knowing why. But come, I suppose we must play our\r\npart in the pageant of the night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor that evening Laura, contrary to the evidence of her senses, was\r\npersuaded by her own lover that Guy was falling in love with her; and\r\nafter musing all through the dance, she said, \xe2\x80\x98What do you think of the\r\nscheme that has been started for my going to Ireland with papa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your going to Ireland?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; you know none of us, except papa, have seen grandmamma since\r\nCharles began to be ill, and there is some talk of his taking me with\r\nhim when he goes this summer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew he was going, but I thought it was not to be till later in the\r\nyear--not till after the long vacation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So he intended, but he finds he must be at home before the end of\r\nOctober, and it would suit him best to go in August.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what becomes of Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He stays at Hollywell. It will be much better for Charles to have him\r\nthere while papa is away. I thought when the plan was first mentioned I\r\nshould be sorry, except that it is quite right to go to grandmamma; but\r\nif it is so, about Guy, this absence would be a good thing--it would\r\nmake a break, and I could begin again on different terms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wisely judged, Laura. Yes, on that account it would be very desirable,\r\nthough it will be a great loss to me, and I can hardly hope to be so\r\nnear you on your return.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! yes, so I feared!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we must give up something; and for Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, poor fellow, it\r\nwill be better to make a break, as you say. It will save him pain by and\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say papa will consult you about when his journey is to be. His\r\nonly doubt was whether it would do to leave Guy so long alone, and if\r\nyou say it would be safe, it would decide him at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see little chance of mischief. Guy has few temptations here, and a\r\nstrong sense of honour; besides, I shall be at hand. Taking all things\r\ninto consideration, Laura, I think that, whatever the sacrifice to\r\nourselves, it is expedient to recommend his going at once, and your\r\naccompanying him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll the remainder of the evening Philip was occupied with attentions\r\nto the rest of the world, but Laura\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed him everywhere, and\r\nthough she neither expected nor desired him to bestow more time on her,\r\nshe underwent a strange restlessness and impatience of feeling. Her\r\nnumerous partners teased her by hindering her from watching him moving\r\nabout the room, catching his tones, and guessing what he was talking\r\nof;--not that she wanted to meet his eye, for she did not like to blush,\r\nnor did she think it pleased him to see her do so, for he either looked\r\naway immediately or conveyed a glance which she understood as monitory.\r\nShe kept better note of his countenance than of her own partner\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorndale, meanwhile, kept aloof from Lady Eveleen de Courcy, but\r\nCaptain Morville perceived that his eyes were often turned towards her,\r\nand well knew it was principle, and not inclination, that held him at a\r\ndistance. He did indeed once ask her to dance, but she was engaged,\r\nand he did not ask her to reserve a future dance for him, but contented\r\nhimself with little Amy.\r\n\r\nAmy was doing her best to enjoy herself, because she thought it\r\nungrateful not to receive pleasure from those who wished to give it,\r\nbut to her it wanted the zest and animation of Lady Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s ball.\r\nBesides, she knew she had been as idle as Guy, or still more so, and she\r\nthought it wrong she should have pleasure while he was doing penance.\r\nIt was on her mind, and damped her spirits, and though she smiled, and\r\ntalked, and admired, and danced lightly and gaily, there was a sensation\r\nof weariness throughout, and no one but Eveleen was sorry when Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone sent Maurice to see for the carriage.\r\n\r\nPhilip was one of the gentlemen who came to shawl them. As he put\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s cloak round her shoulders he was able to whisper, \xe2\x80\x98Take care;\r\nyou must be cautious--self-command.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura, though blushing and shrinking the moment before was braced by his\r\nwords and tone to attempt all he wished. She looked up in what she meant\r\nto be an indifferent manner, and made some observation in a careless\r\ntone--anything rather than let Philip think her silly. After what he had\r\nsaid, was she not bound more than ever to exert herself to the utmost,\r\nthat he might not be disappointed in her? She loved him only the better\r\nfor what others might have deemed a stern coldness of manner, for it\r\nmade the contrast of his real warmth of affection more precious. She\r\nmused over it, as much as her companions\xe2\x80\x99 conversation would allow, on\r\nthe road home. They arrived, Mrs. Edmonstone peeped into Charles\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nannounced that he was quietly asleep, and they all bade each other good\r\nnight, or good morning, and parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10\r\n\r\n      Leonora. Yet often with respect he speaks of thee.\r\n      Tasso.   Thou meanest with forbearance, prudent, subtle,\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98Tis that annoys me, for he knows to use\r\n               Language so smooth and so conditional,\r\n               That seeming praise from him is actual blame.\r\n                                            --GOETHE\xe2\x80\x99S Tasso\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Hollywell party met at breakfast, Charles showed himself by no\r\nmeans the worse for his yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s experiment. He said he had gone to\r\nsleep in reasonable time, lulled by some poetry, he knew not what, of\r\nwhich Guy\xe2\x80\x99s voice had made very pretty music, and he was now full of\r\ntalk about the amusement he had enjoyed yesterday, which seemed likely\r\nto afford food for conversation for many a week to come. After all the\r\ncare Guy had taken of him, Mrs. Edmonstone could not find it in her\r\nheart to scold, and her husband, having spent his vexation upon her, had\r\nnone left to bestow on the real culprit. So when Guy, with his bright\r\nmorning face, and his hair hanging shining and wet round it, opened\r\nthe dining-room door, on his return from bathing in the river, Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s salutation only conveyed that humorous anger that no one\r\ncares for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning to you, Sir Guy Morville! I wonder what you have to say\r\nfor yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling; then, as he took his place by Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98I hope you are not tired after your hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, can you tell me the name of this flower?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! have you really found the arrow-head? How beautiful! Where did you\r\nget it? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it grew in our river.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is plenty of it in that reedy place beyond the turn. I thought it\r\nlooked like something out of the common way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes! What a purple eye it has! I must draw it. O, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Charlotte, Bustle has found you a moorhen\xe2\x80\x99s nest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How delightful! Is it where I can go and see the dear little things?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is rather a swamp; but I have been putting down stepping-stones for\r\nyou, and I dare say I can jump you across. It was that which made me\r\nso late, for which I ought to have asked pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, with his look of courtesy.\r\n\r\nNever did man look less like an offended lover, or like a morose\r\nself-tormentor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are others later,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at Lady\r\nEveleen\xe2\x80\x99s empty chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you think that is all you have to ask pardon for,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr.\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I advise you to study your apologies, for you are in pretty\r\ntolerable disgrace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, with such a change of countenance\r\nthat Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s good nature could not bear to see it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, \xe2\x80\x98tis no concern of mine! It would be going rather the wrong way,\r\nindeed, for you to be begging my pardon for all the care you\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntaking of Charlie; but you had better consider what you have to say for\r\nyourself before you show your face at Broadstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, puzzled for a moment, but quickly looking relieved, and\r\nlaughing, \xe2\x80\x98What! Broadstone in despair for want of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And we perfectly exhausted with answering questions as to what was\r\nbecome of Sir Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dreadful,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, now laughing heartily, in the persuasion that it\r\nwas all a joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Lady Eveleen, good morning; you are come in good time to give me the\r\nstory of the ball, for no one else tells me one word about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98I hope you have repented by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you want to make me repent, you should give me a very alluring\r\ndescription.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shan\xe2\x80\x99t say one word about it; I shall send you to Coventry, as\r\nMaurice and all the regiment mean to do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen, turning away\r\nfrom him with a very droll arch manner of offended dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hear, hear! Eveleen send any one to Coventry!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles. \xe2\x80\x98See what\r\nthe regiment say to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, when I am sent to Coventry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, Paddy, Paddy!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles, and there was a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura seems to be doing it in good earnest without announcing it,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadded Charles, when the laugh was over, \xe2\x80\x98which is the worst sign of\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, hastily; then afraid she had owned to\r\nannoyance, she blushed and was angry with herself for blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Laura, _do_ tell me who your partners were?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery provoking, thought Laura, that I cannot say what is so perfectly\r\nnatural and ordinary, without my foolish cheeks tingling. He may think\r\nit is because he is speaking to me. So she hurried on: \xe2\x80\x98Maurice first,\r\nthen Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 and then showed, what Amy and Eveleen thought, strange\r\noblivion of the rest of her partners.\r\n\r\nThey proceeded into the history of the ball; and Guy thought no more of\r\nhis offences till the following day, when he went to Broadstone. Coming\r\nback, he found the drawing-room full of visitors, and was obliged to\r\nsit down and join in the conversation; but Mrs. Edmonstone saw he was\r\ninwardly chafing, as he betrayed by his inability to remain still, the\r\ntwitchings of his forehead and lip, and a tripping and stumbling of the\r\nwords on his tongue. She was sure he wanted to talk to her, and longed\r\nto get rid of Mrs. Brownlow; but the door was no sooner shut on the\r\nvisitors, than Mr. Edmonstone came in, with a long letter for her\r\nto read and comment upon. Guy took himself out of the way of the\r\nconsultation, and began to hurry up and down the terrace, until, seeing\r\nAmabel crossing the field towards the little gate into the garden, he\r\nwent to open it for her.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, and exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing to signify,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98I was only waiting for your mother. I\r\nhave got into a mess, that is all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 began Amy, there resting in the doubt whether she might\r\ninquire further, and intending not to burthen him with her company, any\r\nlonger than till she reached the house door; but Guy went on,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you have no occasion to be sorry; it is all my own fault; at least,\r\nif I was clear how it is my fault, I should not mind it so much. It\r\nis that ball. I am sure I had not the least notion any one would care\r\nwhether I was there or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure we missed you very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are all so kind; beside, I belong in a manner you; but what could\r\nit signify to any one else? And here I find that I have vexed every\r\none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98mamma said she was afraid it would give offence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought to have attended to her. It was a fit of self-will in managing\r\nmyself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, murmuring low, as if trying to find the real\r\nindictment; \xe2\x80\x98yet I thought it a positive duty; wrong every way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has happened?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, turning back with him, though she had\r\nreached the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, the first person I met was Mr. Gordon; and he spoke like your\r\nfather, half in joke, and I thought entirely so; he said something about\r\nall the world being in such a rage, that I was a bold man to venture\r\ninto Broadstone. Then, while I was at Mr. Lascelles\xe2\x80\x99, in came Dr.\r\nMayerne. \xe2\x80\x98We missed you at the dinner,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and I hear you shirked\r\nthe ball, too.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him how it was, and he said he was glad that\r\nwas all, and advised me to go and call on Colonel Deane and explain. I\r\nthought that the best way--indeed, I meant it before, and was walking\r\nto his lodgings when Maurice de Courcy met me. \xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 he cries out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morville! I thought at least you would have been laid up for a month\r\nwith the typhus fever! As a friend, I advise you to go home and catch\r\nsomething, for it is the only excuse that will serve you. I am not quite\r\nsure that it will not be high treason for me to be seen speaking to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 I tried to get at the rights of it, but he is such a harum-scarum\r\nfellow there was no succeeding. Next I met Thorndale, who only bowed\r\nand passed on the other side of the street--sign enough how it was with\r\nPhilip; so I thought it best to go at once to the Captain, and get a\r\nrational account of what was the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, who, though concerned and rather alarmed, had been\r\nsmiling at the humorous and expressive tones with which he could not\r\nhelp giving effect to his narration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Philip was at home, and very--very--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gracious?\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Amy, as he hesitated for a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so. Only the vexatious thing was, that we never could succeed in\r\ncoming to an understanding. He was ready to forgive; but I could not\r\ndisabuse him of an idea--where he picked it up I cannot guess--that I\r\nhad stayed away out of pique. He would not even tell me what he thought\r\nhad affronted me, though I asked him over and over again to be only\r\nstraightforward; he declared I knew.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How excessively provoking!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy. \xe2\x80\x98You cannot guess what he\r\nmeant?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the least in the world. I have not the most distant suspicion. It\r\nwas of no use to declare I was not offended with any one; he only looked\r\nin that way of his, as if he knew much better than I did myself, and\r\ntold me he could make allowances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worse than all! How horrid of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t spoil me. No doubt he thinks he has grounds, and my\r\nirritation was unjustifiable. Yes, I got into my old way. He cautioned\r\nme, and nearly made me mad! I never was nearer coming to a regular\r\noutbreak. Always the same! Fool that I am.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Guy, that is always your way; when other people are provoking,\r\nyou abuse yourself. I am sure Philip was so, with his calm assertion of\r\nbeing right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The more provoking, the more trial for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you endured it. You say it was only _nearly_ an outbreak. You\r\nparted friends? I am sure of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it would have been rather too bad not to do that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why do you scold yourself, when you really had the victory?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The victory will be if the inward feeling as well as the outward token\r\nis ever subdued.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, that must be in time, of course. Only let me hear how you got on\r\nwith Colonel Deane.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was very good-natured, and would have laughed it off, but Philip\r\nwent with me, and looked grand, and begged in a solemn way that no more\r\nmight be said. I could have got on better alone; but Philip was very\r\nkind, or, as you say, gracious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And provoking,\xe2\x80\x99 added Amy, \xe2\x80\x98only I believe you do not like me to say\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is more agreeable to hear you call him so at this moment than is\r\ngood for me. I have no right to complain, since I gave the offence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The offence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The absenting myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that you did because you thought it right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to be clear that it was right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99 cried she, astonished. \xe2\x80\x98It was a great piece of\r\nself-denial, and I only felt it wrong not to be doing the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, how should such creatures as you need the same discipline as I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed to herself how far from his equal she was--how weak, idle,\r\nand self-pleasing she felt herself to be; but she could not say so--the\r\nwords would not come; and she only drooped her little head, humbled by\r\nhis treating her as better than himself.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Something wrong I have done, and I want the clue. Was it self-will in\r\nchoosing discipline contrary to your mother\xe2\x80\x99s judgment? Yet she could\r\nnot know all. I thought it her kindness in not liking me to lose the\r\npleasure. Besides, one must act for oneself, and this was only my own\r\npersonal amusement.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, timidly hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, with the gentle, deferential tone that contrasted with\r\nhis hasty, vehement self-accusations. \xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 and he waited, though not\r\nso as to hurry or frighten her, but to encourage, by showing her words\r\nhad weight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking of one thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98is it not sometimes right\r\nto consider whether we ought to disappoint people who want us to be\r\npleased?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There it is, I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, stopping and considering, then going\r\non with a better satisfied air, \xe2\x80\x98that is a real rule. Not to be so bent\r\non myself as to sacrifice other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings to what seems best for\r\nme. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see whose pleasure I interfered with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy could have answered, \xe2\x80\x98Mine;\xe2\x80\x99 but the maidenly feeling checked her\r\nagain, and she said, \xe2\x80\x98We all thought you would like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I had no right to sacrifice your pleasure! I see, I see. The\r\npleasure of giving pleasure to others is so much the best there is on\r\nearth, that one ought to be passive rather than interfere with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98just as I have seen Mary Ross let herself be swung\r\ntill she was giddy, rather than disappoint Charlotte and Helen, who\r\nthought she liked it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If one could get to look at everything with as much indifference as\r\nthe swinging! But it is all selfishness. It is as easy to be selfish for\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own good as for one\xe2\x80\x99s own pleasure; and I dare say, the first is\r\nas bad as the other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking of something else,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I should think it more\r\nlike the holly tree in Southey. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it? The young leaves are\r\nsharp and prickly, because they have so much to defend themselves from,\r\nbut as the tree grows older, it leaves off the spears, after it has won\r\nthe victory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very kind of you, and very pretty, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, smiling; \xe2\x80\x98but, in the\r\nmeantime, it is surely wrong to be more prickly than is unavoidable, and\r\nthere is the perplexity. Selfish! selfish! selfish! Oneself the first\r\nobject. That is the root.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy, if it is not impertinent to ask, I do wish you would tell me\r\none thing. Why did you think it wrong to go to that ball?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy,\r\ntimidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I thought it wrong to go to that individual ball,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but my notion was, that altogether I was getting into a\r\nrattling idle way, never doing my proper quantity of work, or doing\r\nit properly, and talking a lot of nonsense sometimes. I thought, last\r\nSunday, it was time to make a short turn somewhere and bring myself up.\r\nI could not, or did not get out of the pleasant talks as Laura does, so\r\nI thought giving up this ball would punish me at once, and set me on a\r\nnew tack of behaving like a reasonable creature.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t call yourself too many names, or you won\xe2\x80\x99t be civil to us. We\r\nall, except Laura, have been quite as bad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but you had not so much to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We ought,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but I meant to be reasonable when Eveleen is\r\ngone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought to have waited till then, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Lady Eveleen\r\nis so amusing that it leads to farther dawdling, and it would not do to\r\nwait to resist the temptation till it is out of the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, they saw Mrs. Edmonstone coming out, and went to meet her.\r\nGuy told her his trouble, detailing it more calmly than before he\r\nhad found out his mistake. She agreed with him that this had been in\r\nforgetting that his attending the ball did not concern only himself, but\r\nhe then returned to say that he could not see what difference it made,\r\nexcept to their own immediate circle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it was not you, Guy, who made that speech, I should call it fishing\r\nfor a compliment. You forget that rank and station make people sought\r\nafter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose there is something in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x98at any\r\nrate, it is no bad thing to think so, it is so humiliating.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is not the way most people would take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No? Does not it prevent one from taking any attention as paid to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreal self? The real flattering thing would be to be made as much of as\r\nPhilip is, for one\xe2\x80\x99s own merits, and not for the handle to one\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I think so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then,\xe2\x80\x99 as if he wished to gather the whole conversation into\r\none resolve, the point is to consider whether abstaining from innocent\r\nthings that may be dangerous to oneself mortifies other people. If so,\r\nthe vexing them is a certain wrong, whereas the mischief of taking the\r\npleasure is only a possible contingency. But then one must take it out\r\nof oneself some other way, or it becomes an excuse for self-indulgence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly with you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I had rather go at it at once, and forget all about other\r\npeople. You must teach me consideration, Mrs. Edmonstone, and in the\r\nmeantime will you tell me what you think I had better do about this\r\nscrape?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let it alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98You have begged every one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npardon, and it had better be forgotten as fast as possible. They have\r\nmade more fuss already than it is worth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t torment yourself about it\r\nany more; for, if you have made a mistake, it is on the right side; and\r\non the first opportunity, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and call on Mrs. Deane, and see if she\r\nis very implacable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe dressing-bell rang, and Amy ran up-stairs, stopping at Laura\xe2\x80\x99s door,\r\nto ask how she prospered in the drive she had been taking with Charles\r\nand Eveleen.\r\n\r\nAmy told her of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s trouble, and oh! awkward question, inquired if\r\nshe could guess what it could be that Philip imagined that Guy had been\r\noffended at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t he guess?\xe2\x80\x99 said poor Laura, to gain time, and brushing her hair\r\nover her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he has no idea, though Philip protested that he knew, and would not\r\ntell him. Philip must have been most tiresome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Has Guy been complaining?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, only angry with himself for being vexed. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how Philip\r\ncan go on so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush, Amy, you know nothing about it. He has reasons--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, indignantly; \xe2\x80\x98but what right has he to go on\r\nmistrusting? If people are to be judged by their deeds, no one is\r\nso good as Guy, and it is too bad to reckon up against him all his\r\nancestors have done. It is wolf and lamb, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does not!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura. \xe2\x80\x98He never is unjust! How can you say so,\r\nAmy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why does he impute motives, and not straightforwardly tell what he\r\nmeans?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is impossible in this case,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know what it is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, perfectly truthful, and feeling herself in a dreadful\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not for worlds,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura, in horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you get Philip to tell him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, no! I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it, Amy; and all that can be done is to let\r\nit die away as fast as possible. It is only the rout about it that is of\r\nconsequence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very odd,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98but I must dress,\xe2\x80\x99 and away she ran, much\r\npuzzled, but with no desire to look into Philip\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\r\n\r\nLaura rested her head on her hand, sighed, and wondered why it was so\r\nhard to answer. She almost wished she had said Philip had been advising\r\nher to discourage any attachment on Guy\xe2\x80\x99s part; but then Amy might have\r\nlaughed, and asked why. No! no! Philip\xe2\x80\x99s confidence was in her keeping,\r\nand cost her what it might, she would be faithful to the trust.\r\n\r\nThere was now a change. The evenings were merry, but the mornings were\r\noccupied. Guy went off to his room, as he used to do last winter; Laura\r\ncommenced some complicated perspective, or read a German book with a\r\ngreat deal of dictionary; Amy had a book of history, and practised her\r\nmusic diligently; even Charles read more to himself, and resumed the\r\nstudy with Guy and Amy; Lady Eveleen joined in every one\xe2\x80\x99s pursuits,\r\nenjoyed them, and lamented to Laura that it was impossible to be\r\nrational at her own home.\r\n\r\nLaura tried to persuade her that there was no need that she should be on\r\nthe level of the society round her, and it ended in her spending an hour\r\nin diligent study every morning, promising to continue it when she went\r\nhome, while Laura made such sensible comments that Eveleen admired her\r\nmore than ever; and she, knowing that some were second-hand from Philip,\r\nothers arising from his suggestions, gave him all the homage paid to\r\nherself, as a tribute to him who reigned over her whole being.\r\n\r\nYet she was far from happy. Her reserve towards Guy made her feel stiff\r\nand guarded; she had a craving for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s presence, with a dread of\r\nshowing it, which made her uncomfortable. She wondered he had not been\r\nat Hollywell since the bail, for he must know that she was going to\r\nIreland in a fortnight, and was not likely to return till his regiment\r\nhad left Broadstone.\r\n\r\nAn interval passed long enough for her not to be alone in her surprise\r\nat his absenting himself before he at length made his appearance, just\r\nbefore luncheon, so as to miss the unconstrained morning hours he used\r\nso much to enjoy. He found Guy, Charles, and Amy, deep in Butler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nAnalogy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you making poor little Amy read that?\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles; \xe2\x80\x98he is so disappointed that it is not Pickwick\r\nthat he does not know what else to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I take much in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but I like to be told what\r\nit means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I can do that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never spent much time over it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but I should think you\r\nwere out of your depth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98we will return to Dickens to oblige you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is your pleasure to wrest my words,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip, in his own calm\r\nmanner, though he actually felt hurt, which he had never done before.\r\nHis complacency was less secure, so that there was more need for\r\nself-assertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are the rest?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura and Eveleen are making a dictation lesson agreeable to\r\nCharlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98I found Eva making mistakes on purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How much longer does she stay?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Till Tuesday. Lord Kilcoran is coming to fetch her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte entered, and immediately ran up-stairs to announce her\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s arrival. Laura was glad of this previous notice, and hoped her\r\nblush and tremor were not observed. It was a struggle, through luncheon\r\ntime, to keep her colour and confusion within bounds; but she succeeded\r\nbetter than she fancied she did, and Philip gave her as much help as he\r\ncould, by not looking at her. Seeing that he dreaded nothing so much as\r\nher exciting suspicion, she was at once braced and alarmed.\r\n\r\nHer father was very glad to see him, and reproached him for making\r\nhimself a stranger, while her sisters counted up the days of his\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There was the time, to be sure, when we met you on Ashen-down, but that\r\nwas a regular cheat. Laura had you all to herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura bent down to feed Bustle, and Philip felt _his_ colour deepening.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone went on to ask him to come and stay at Hollywell for a\r\nweek, vowing he would take no refusal. \xe2\x80\x98A week was out of the question,\r\nsaid Philip; \xe2\x80\x98but he could come for two nights.\xe2\x80\x99 Amabel hinted that\r\nthere was to be a dinner-party on Thursday, thinking it fair to give\r\nhim warning of what he disliked, but he immediately chose that very day.\r\nAgain he disconcerted all expectations, when it was time to go out. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone and Charles were going to drive, the young ladies and Guy to\r\nwalk, but Philip disposed himself to accompany his uncle in a survey of\r\nthe wheat.\r\n\r\nLaura perceived that he would not risk taking another walk with her when\r\nthey might be observed. It showed implicit trust to leave her to his\r\nrival; but she was sorry to find that caution must put an end to the\r\nfreedom of their intercourse, and would have stayed at home, but that\r\nEveleen was so wild and unguarded that Mrs. Edmonstone did not like her\r\nto be without Laura as a check on her, especially when Guy was of the\r\nparty. There was some comfort in that warm pressure of her hand when she\r\nbade Philip good-bye, and on that she lived for a long time. He stood at\r\nthe window watching them till they were out of sight, then moved\r\ntowards his aunt, who with her bonnet on, was writing an invitation for\r\nThursday, to Mr. Thorndale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98if it would not be as well,\r\nif you liked, to ask Thorndale here for those two days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If _you_ think so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mrs. Edmonstone, looking at him more\r\ninquiringly than he could well bear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know how he enjoys being here, and I owe them all so much\r\nkindness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly; I will speak to your uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, going in search of\r\nhim. She presently returned, saying they should be very glad to see Mr.\r\nThorndale, asking him at the same time, in her kind tones of interest,\r\nafter an old servant for whom he had been spending much thought and\r\npains. The kindness cut him to the heart, for it evidently arose from\r\na perception that he was ill at ease, and his conscience smote him. He\r\nanswered shortly, and was glad when the carriage came; he lifted Charles\r\ninto it, and stood with folded arms as they drove away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The air is stormy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, looking back at him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You thought so, too?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have wondered for some time past.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was very decided to-day--that long absence--and there was no\r\nprovoking him to be sententious. His bringing his young man might be\r\nonly to keep him in due subjection; but his choosing the day of the\r\nparty, and above all, not walking with the young ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It not like himself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, in a leading tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Either the sweet youth is in love, or in the course of some strange\r\ntransformation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In love!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Have you any reason for thinking so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only as a solution of phenomena; but you look as if I had hit on the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it is no such thing; yet--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Charles, seriously. \xe2\x80\x98I think he has discovered the\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The danger of falling in love with Laura? Well, it would be odd if he\r\nwas not satisfied with his own work. But he must know how preposterous\r\nthat would be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you think that would prevent it?\xe2\x80\x99 said his mother, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nis just the man to plume himself on making his judgment conquer his\r\ninclination, setting novels at defiance. How magnanimously he would\r\nresolve to stifle a hopeless attachment!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is exactly what I think he is doing. I think he has found out the\r\nstate of his feelings, and is doing all in his power to check them by\r\navoiding her, especially in tete-a-tetes, and an unconstrained family\r\nparty. I am nearly convinced that is his reason for bringing Mr.\r\nThorndale, and fixing on the day of the dinner. Poor fellow, it must\r\ncost him a great deal, and I long to tell him how I thank him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hm! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it unlikely,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98It agrees with what\r\nhappened the evening of the Kilcoran ball, when he was ready to eat me\r\nup for saying something he fancied was a hint of a liking of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfor Laura. It was a wild mistake, for something I said about Petrarch,\r\nforgetting that Petrarch suggested Laura; but it put him out to a\r\ndegree, and he made all manner of denunciations on the horror of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfalling in love with her. Now, as far as I see, Guy is much more in\r\nlove with you, or with Deloraine, and the idea argues far more that the\r\nCaptain himself is touched.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it, Charlie, it was this that led to his detecting the true\r\nstate of the case. Ever since that he has kept away. It is noble!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you think about Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor child! I doubt if it was well to allow so much intimacy; yet I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see how it could have been helped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you think she is in for it? I hope not; but she has not been herself\r\nof late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think she misses what she has been used to from him, and thinks him\r\nestranged, but I trust it goes no further. I see she is out of spirits;\r\nI wish I could help her, dear girl, but the worst of all would be to let\r\nher guess the real name and meaning of all this, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t venture to\r\nsay a word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very innocent of novels,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98and that is well. It\r\nwould be an unlucky business to have our poor beauty either sitting\r\n\xe2\x80\x98like Patience on a monument\xe2\x80\x99, or \xe2\x80\x98cockit up on a baggage-waggon.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nthat will never be. Philip is not the man to have a wife in barracks. He\r\nwould have her like his books, in morocco, or not at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He would never involve her in discomforts. He may be entirely trusted,\r\nand as long as he goes on as he has begun, there is no harm done; Laura\r\nwill cheer up, will only consider him as her cousin and friend, and\r\nnever know he has felt more for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Her going to Ireland is very fortunate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has made me still more glad that the plan should take place at\r\nonce.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you say \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to nobody\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not. We must not let him guess we have observed anything;\r\nthere is no need to make your father uncomfortable, and such things need\r\nnot dawn on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s imagination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered at that Mrs. Edmonstone should confide such a subject\r\nto her son, but she knew that in a case really affecting his sister,\r\nand thus introduced, his silence was secure. In fact, confidence was the\r\nonly way to prevent the shrewd, unscrupulous raillery which would have\r\ncaused great distress, and perhaps led to the very disclosure to be\r\ndeprecated. Of late, too, there had been such a decrease of petulance\r\nin Charles, as justified her in trusting him, and lastly, it must be\r\nobserved that she was one of those open-hearted people who cannot make a\r\ndiscovery nor endure an anxiety without imparting it. Her tact, indeed,\r\nled her to make a prudent choice of confidants, and in this case her son\r\nwas by far the best, though she had spoken without premeditation. Her\r\nnature would never have allowed her to act as her daughter was doing;\r\nshe would have been without the strength to conceal her feelings,\r\nespecially when deprived of the safety-valve of free intercourse with\r\ntheir object.\r\n\r\nThe visit took place as arranged, and very uncomfortable it was to all\r\nwho looked deeper than the surface. In the first place, Philip found\r\nthere the last person he wished his friend to meet--Lady Eveleen, who\r\nhad been persuaded to stay for the dinner-party; but Mr. Thorndale was,\r\nas Charles would have said, on his good behaviour, and, ashamed of the\r\nfascination her manners exercised over him, was resolved to resist it,\r\nanswered her gay remarks with brief sentences and stiff smiles, and\r\nconsorted chiefly with the gentlemen.\r\n\r\nLaura was grave and silent, trying to appear unconscious, and only\r\nsucceeding in being visibly constrained. Philip was anxious and stern in\r\nhis attempts to appear unconcerned, and even Guy was not quite as bright\r\nand free as usual, being puzzled as to how far he was forgiven about the\r\nball.\r\n\r\nAmabel could not think what had come to every one, and tried in vain to\r\nmake them sociable. In the evening they had recourse to a game, said\r\nto be for Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s amusement, but in reality to obviate some of the\r\nstiffness and constraint; yet even this led to awkward situations. Each\r\nperson was to set down his or her favourite character in history and\r\nfiction, flower, virtue, and time at which to have lived, and these were\r\nall to be appropriated to the writers. The first read was--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lily of the valley--truth--Joan of Arc--Padre Cristoforo--the present\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see you are right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98but tell me your grounds!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Padre Cristoforo,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fancy little Amy choosing Joan of Arc,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen, \xe2\x80\x98she who is\r\nafraid of a tolerable sized grasshopper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to have been Joan\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and heard her tell about her\r\nvisions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would have taught her to believe them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Taught her!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Surely you take the high view of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98that she is a much injured person, as much\r\nby her friends as her enemies; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to enter either\r\nenthusiastically or philosophically into her character.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhat was it that made Guy\xe2\x80\x99s brow contract, as he began to strip the\r\nfeather of a pen, till, recollecting himself, he threw it from him with\r\na dash, betraying some irritation, and folded his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lavender,\xe2\x80\x99 read Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What should make any one choose that?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, looking up. \xe2\x80\x98I shall never forget the\r\ntufts of lavender round the kitchen garden at Stylehurst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled. Charlotte proceeded, and Charles saw Laura\xe2\x80\x99s colour\r\ndeepening as she bent over her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLavender--steadfastness--Strafford--Cordelia in \xe2\x80\x98King Lear\xe2\x80\x99--the\r\nlate war.\xe2\x80\x9d How funny!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98For hear the next:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoneysuckle--steadfastness--Lord Strafford--Cordelia--the present\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d Why, Laura, you must have copied it from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura neither looked nor spoke. Philip could hardly command his\r\ncountenance as Eveleen laughed, and told him he was much flattered by\r\nthose becoming blushes. But here Charles broke in,--\xe2\x80\x98Come, make haste,\r\nCharlotte, don\xe2\x80\x99t be all night about it;\xe2\x80\x99 and as Charlotte paused, as if\r\nto make some dangerous remark, he caught the paper, and read the next\r\nhimself. Nothing so startled Philip as this desire to cover their\r\nconfusion. Laura was only sensible of the relief of having attention\r\ndrawn from her by the laugh that followed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A shamrock--Captain Rock--the tailor that was \xe2\x80\x9cblue moulded for want of\r\na bating\xe2\x80\x9d--Pat Riotism--the time of Malachy with the collar of gold.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eva!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen; \xe2\x80\x98I am glad I know your tastes, Charles. They\r\ndo you honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More than yours do, if these are yours,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, reading them\r\ncontemptuously; \xe2\x80\x98Rose--generosity--Charles Edward--Catherine Seyton--the\r\ncivil wars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better not have disowned Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s, Lady Eveleen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay do you think I would put up with such a set as these?\xe2\x80\x99 retorted\r\nCharles; \xe2\x80\x98I am not fallen so low as the essence of young ladyism.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What can you find to say against them?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98No one ever can find anything to say for or\r\nagainst young ladies\xe2\x80\x99 tastes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You seem to be rather in the case of the tailor yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ready to do battle, if you could but get any opposition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98how you could wish to live in the civil\r\nwars?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, because they would be so entertaining.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s Paddy, genuine Paddy at last!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Depend upon\r\nit, the conventional young lady won\xe2\x80\x99t do, Eva.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter much more discussion, and one or two more papers, came Guy\xe2\x80\x99s--the\r\nlast. \xe2\x80\x98Heather--Truth--King Charles--Sir Galahad--the present time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir how much? exclaimed Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Sir Galahad--the Knight of the Siege\r\nPerilous--who won the Saint Greal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What language is that?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the Morte d\xe2\x80\x99Arthur! I thought every one did! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, Philip!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I once looked into it. It is very curious, in classical English; but it\r\nis a book no one could read through.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, indignantly; then, \xe2\x80\x98but you only looked into it. If you\r\nhad lived with its two fat volumes, you could not help delighting in it.\r\nIt was my boating-book for at least three summers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That accounts for it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98a book so studied in boyhood\r\nacquires a charm apart from its actual merits.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it has actual merits. The depth, the mystery, the allegory--the\r\nbeautiful characters of some of the knights.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look through the medium of your imagination,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; but\r\nyou must pardon others for seeing a great sameness of character and\r\nadventure, and for disapproving of the strange mixture of religion and\r\nromance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve never read it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, striving to speak patiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A cursory view is sufficient to show whether a book will repay the time\r\nspent in reading it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A cursory view enable one to judge better than making it your study?\r\nEh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is no paradox. The actual merits are better seen by an unprejudiced\r\nstranger than by an old friend who lends them graces of his own\r\ndevising.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles laughed: Guy pushed back his chair, and went to look out at the\r\nwindow. Perhaps Philip enjoyed thus chafing his temper; for after all he\r\nhad said to Laura, it was satisfactory to see his opinion justified, so\r\nthat he might not feel himself unfair. It relieved his uneasiness lest\r\nhis understanding with Laura should be observed. It had been in great\r\nperil that evening, for as the girls went up to bed, Eveleen gaily said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Laura, have you quarrelled with Captain Morville?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you say such things, Eva? Good night.\xe2\x80\x99 And Laura escaped into\r\nher own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of it, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a stranger makes us more formal,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an innocent you are! It is of no use to talk to you!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nEveleen, running away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; but Eva,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, pursuing her, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t go off with a wrong fancy.\r\nCharles has teased Laura so much about Philip, that of course it makes\r\nher shy of him before strangers; and it would never have done to laugh\r\nabout their choosing the same things when Mr. Thorndale was there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must be satisfied, I suppose. I know that is what you think, for you\r\ncould not say any other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, little innocence--it would only shock you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing you _really_ _thought_ about Laura could shock me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean what you might say in play.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, then, shall you think me in play or earnest when I say that I\r\nthink Laura likes Philip very much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In play\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98for you know that if we had not got our own Charlie\r\nto show us what a brother is, we should think of Philip as just the same\r\nas a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A brother! You are pretending to be more simple than you really are,\r\nAmy! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know what I mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, her cheeks lighting up, \xe2\x80\x98that must be only play, for he\r\nhas never asked her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but suppose she was in the state just ready to be asked?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that could never be, for he could never ask her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not, little Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because we are cousins, and everything,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, confused. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntalk any more about it, Eva; for though I know it is all play, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it, and mamma, would not wish me to talk of such things. And\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you laugh about it, dear Eva, pray; for it only makes every one\r\nuncomfortable. Pray!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy had a very persuasive way of saying \xe2\x80\x98pray,\xe2\x80\x99 and Eveleen thought she\r\nmust yield to it. Besides, she respected Laura and Captain Morville too\r\nmuch to resolve to laugh at them, whatever she might do when her fear of\r\nthe Captain made her saucy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone thought it best on all accounts to sit in the\r\ndrawing-room the next morning; but she need not have taken so much pains\r\nto chaperon her young ladies, for the gentlemen did not come near them.\r\n\r\nLaura was more at ease in manner, though very far from happy, for she\r\nwas restlessly eager for a talk with Philip; while he was resolved not\r\nto seek a private interview, sure that it would excite suspicion, and\r\nwilling to lose the consciousness of his underhand proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis was the day of the dinner-party, and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s heart leaped as she\r\ncalculated that it must fall to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s lot to hand her in to dinner.\r\nShe was not mistaken, he did give her his arm; and they found themselves\r\nmost favourably placed, for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s other neighbour was Mrs. Brownlow,\r\ntalking at a great rate to Mr. de Courcy, and on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s side was the\r\nrather deaf Mr. Hayley, who had quite enough to do to talk to Miss\r\nBrownlow. Charles was not at table, and not one suspicious eye could\r\nrest on them, yet it was not till the second course was in progress that\r\nhe said anything which the whole world might not have heard. Something\r\nhad passed about Canterbury, and its distance from Hollywell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can be here often,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you can only be guarded,--and I think you are becoming so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this a time to speak of--? Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the only time. No one is attending, and I have something to say\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOverpowering her dire confusion, in obedience to him, she looked at the\r\nepergne, and listened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have acted prudently. You have checked--\xe2\x80\x99 and he indicated\r\nGuy--\xe2\x80\x98without producing more than moderate annoyance. You have only to\r\nguard your self-possession.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very foolish,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ordinary women say so, and rest contented with the folly. You can do\r\nbetter things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a thrill of joy at finding him conversing with her as his\r\n\xe2\x80\x98own;\xe2\x80\x99 it overcame her embarrassment and alarm, and wishes he would not\r\nchoose such a time for speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shall I?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Employ yourself. Employ and strengthen your mind!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shall I, and without you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Find something to prevent you from dwelling on the future. That drawing\r\nis dreamy work, employing the fingers and leaving the mind free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been trying to read, but I cannot fix my mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose you take what will demand attention. Mathematics, algebra. I\r\nwill send you my first book of algebra, and it will help you to work\r\ndown many useless dreams and anxieties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; pray do; I shall be very glad of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will find it give a power and stability to your mind, and no longer\r\nhave to complain of frivolous occupation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel frivolous now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, sadly; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it is\r\nthat everything is so altered, I am really happier, but my light heart\r\nis gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have but now learnt the full powers of your soul, Laura, you have\r\nleft the world of childhood, with the gay feelings which have no depth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have what is better,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have, indeed. But those feelings must be regulated, and\r\nstrengthening the intellect strengthens the governing power.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip, with all his sense, was mystifying himself, because he was\r\ndeparting from right, the only true \xe2\x80\x98good sense.\xe2\x80\x99 His right judgment\r\nin all things was becoming obscured, so he talked metaphysical jargon,\r\ninstead of plain practical truth, and thought he was teaching Laura to\r\nstrengthen her powers of mind, instead of giving way to dreams, when\r\nhe was only leading her to stifle meditation, and thus securing her\r\ncomplete submission to himself.\r\n\r\nShe was happier after this conversation, and better able to pay\r\nattention to the guests, nor did she feel guilty when obliged to play\r\nand sing in the evening--for she knew he must own that she could do no\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nLady Eveleen gave, however, its brilliancy to the party. She had\r\nsomething wonderfully winning and fascinating about her, and Philip\r\nowned to himself that it took no small resolution on the part of Mr.\r\nThorndale to keep so steadily aloof from the party in the bay window,\r\nwhere she was reigning like a queen, and inspiring gaiety like a fairy.\r\nShe made Guy sing with her; it was the first time he had ever sung,\r\nexcept among themselves, as Mrs. Edmonstone had never known whether he\r\nwould like to be asked; but Eveleen refused to sing some of the Irish\r\nmelodies unless he would join her, and without making any difficulty he\r\ndid so. Mrs. Brownlow professed to be electrified, and Eveleen declaring\r\nthat she knew she sung like a peacock, told Mrs. Brownlow that the thing\r\nto hear was Sir Guy singing glees with Laura and Amy. Of course, they\r\nwere obliged to sing. Mrs. Brownlow was delighted; and as she had\r\nconsiderable knowledge of music, they all grew eager and Philip thought\r\nit very foolish of Guy to allow so much of his talent and enthusiasm to\r\ndisplay themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen all the people were gone, and the home party had wished each other\r\ngood-night, Philip lingered in the drawing-room to finish a letter. Guy,\r\nafter helping Charles up-stairs, came down a few moments after, to fetch\r\nsomething which he had forgotten. Philip looked up,--\xe2\x80\x98You contributed\r\ngreatly to the entertainment this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nGuy coloured, not quite sure that this was not said sarcastically, and\r\nprovoked with himself for being vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think one devoid of the sixth sense has no right to speak,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t expect all to think it, as I do, one of the best things in this\r\nworld or out of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, speaking quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know it is so felt by those who understand its secrets,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would not depreciate it; so you may hear me patiently, Guy. I only\r\nmeant to warn you, that it is often the means of bringing persons into\r\nundesirable intimacies, from which they cannot disentangle themselves as\r\neasily as they enter them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA flush crossed Guy\xe2\x80\x99s cheek, but it passed, and he simply said--\xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsuppose it may. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip looked after him, and pondered on what it was that had annoyed\r\nhim--manner, words, or advice. He ascribed it to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to\r\nbe advised, since he had observed that his counsel was apt to irritate\r\nhim, though his good sense often led him to follow it. In the present\r\ncase, Philip thought Mrs. Brownlow and her society by no means desirable\r\nfor a youth like Guy; and he was quite right.\r\n\r\nPhilip and his friend went the next morning; and in the afternoon Laura\r\nreceived the book of algebra--a very original first gift from a lover.\r\nIt came openly, with a full understanding that she was to use it by his\r\nrecommendation; her mother and brother both thought they understood the\r\nmotive, which one thought very wise, and the other very characteristic.\r\n\r\nLord Kilcoran and Lady Eveleen also departed. Eveleen very sorry to go,\r\nthough a little comforted by the prospect of seeing Laura so soon\r\nin Ireland, where she would set her going in all kinds of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98rationalities--reading, and school teaching, and everything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, when all were out of hearing but his mother; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nI shrewdly suspect the comfort would be still greater if it was Sir Guy\r\nMorville who was coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be no bad thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said his mother: \xe2\x80\x98Eveleen is a nice creature\r\nwith great capabilities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Capabilities! but will they ever come to anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a few years,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98and he is a mere boy at\r\npresent, so there is plenty of time for both to develop themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most true, madame mere; but it remains to be proved whether the liking\r\nfor Sir Guy, which has taken hold of my lady Eveleen, is strong enough\r\nto withstand all the coquetting with young Irishmen, and all the idling\r\nat Kilcoran.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope she has something better to be relied on than the liking for Sir\r\nGuy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may well do so, for I think he has no notion of throwing off his\r\nallegiance to you--his first and only love. He liked very well to make\r\nfun with Eva; but he regarded her rather as a siren, who drew him off\r\nfrom his Latin and Greek.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I am ashamed of myself for such a fit of match-making! Forget it,\r\nCharlie, as fast as you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11\r\n\r\n     This warld\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, when I think o\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\n     Its pride, and a\xe2\x80\x99 the lave o\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\n     Fie, fie on silly coward man,\r\n     That he should be the slave o\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n                             --BURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another week Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were to depart\r\non their Irish journey. Laura, besides the natural pain in leaving home,\r\nwas sorry to be no longer near Philip, especially as it was not likely\r\nthat he would be still at Broadstone on their return; yet she was so\r\nrestless and dissatisfied, that any change was welcome, and the fear of\r\nbetraying herself almost took away the pleasure of his presence.\r\n\r\nHe met them at the railway station at Broadstone, where Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nfinding himself much too early, recollected something he had forgotten\r\nin the town, and left his daughter to walk up and down the platform\r\nunder Philip\xe2\x80\x99s charge. They felt it a precious interval, but both were\r\nout of spirits, and could hardly profit by it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be gone long before we come back,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In a fortnight or three weeks, probably.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you will still be able to come to Hollywell now and then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so. It is all the pleasure I can look for. We shall never see\r\nsuch a summer again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it has been a memorable one!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Memorable! Yes. It has given me an assurance that compensates for all\r\nI have lost; yet it has made me feel, more than ever before, how poverty\r\nwithers a man\xe2\x80\x99s hopes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Philip, I always thought your poverty a great, noble thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You thought like a generous-tempered girl who has known nothing of its\r\neffects.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And do you know that Guy says the thing to be proud of is of holding\r\nthe place you do, without the aid of rank or riches.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would not have it otherwise--I would not for worlds that my father\r\nhad acted otherwise,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98You understand that, Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But when you speak--when Guy speaks of my holding the place I do, you\r\nlittle know what it is to feel that powers of usefulness are wasted--to\r\nknow I have the means of working my way to honour and distinction, such\r\nas you would rejoice in Laura, to have it all within, yet feel it thrown\r\naway. Locksley Hall, again--\xe2\x80\x9cevery door is barred with gold, and opens\r\nbut to golden keys.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish there was anything to be done,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is my profession that is the bar to everything. I have sold the best\r\nyears of my life, and for what? To see my sister degrade herself by that\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the real grief,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But for that, I should never have cast a look back on what I\r\nrelinquished. However, why do I talk of these things, these vain\r\nregrets? They only occurred because my welfare does not concern myself\r\nalone--and here\xe2\x80\x99s your father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone returned, out of breath, in too much bustle remark his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s blushes. Even when the train was moving off, he still had\r\nhis head out at the window, calling to Philip that they should expect\r\na visit from him as soon as ever they returned. Such cordiality gave\r\nPhilip a pang; and in bitterness of spirit he walked back to the\r\nbarracks. On the way he met Mrs. Deane who wanted to consult him about\r\ninviting his cousin, Sir Guy to a dinner-party she intended to give next\r\nweek. \xe2\x80\x98Such an agreeable, sensible youth, and we feel we owe him some\r\nattention, he took so much pains to make apologies about the ball.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say he will be very happy to come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will write at once. He is a very fine young man, without a shade of\r\nvanity or nonsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he has very pleasant, unaffected manners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure he will do credit to his estate. It is a very handsome\r\nfortune, is it not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a very large property.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad of it; I have no doubt we shall see him one of the first men\r\nof his time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThese words brought into contrast in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s mind the difference\r\nbetween Guy\xe2\x80\x99s position and his own. The mere possession of wealth was\r\nwinning for Guy, at an age when his merits could only be negative, that\r\nestimation which his own tried character had scarcely achieved, placing\r\nhim not merely on a level with himself, but in a situation where\r\nhappiness and influence came unbidden. His own talents, attainments, and\r\nequal, if not superior claims, to gentle blood, could not procure him\r\nwhat seemed to lie at Guy\xe2\x80\x99s feet. His own ability and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s heart\r\nalone were what wealth could not affect; yet when he thought how the\r\nwant of it wasted the one, and injured the hopes of the other, he\r\nrecurred to certain visions of his sister Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s, in days gone\r\nby, of what he was to do as Sir Philip, lord of Redclyffe. He was\r\nspeculating on what would have happened had Guy died in his sickly\r\ninfancy, when, suddenly recollecting himself, he turned his mind to\r\nother objects.\r\n\r\nGuy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane\xe2\x80\x99s invitation. He said he knew\r\nhe must go to make up for his rudeness about the ball; but he grumbled\r\nenough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh at him for being so stupid as\r\nto want to stay hum-drum in the chimney corner. No doubt it was very\r\npleasant there. There was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a\r\nremnant of a large party, when each member of it feels bound to prevent\r\nthe rest from being dull. Guy devoted himself to Charles more than\r\never, and in the fear that he might miss the late variety of amusement,\r\nexerted even more of his powers of entertainment than Lady Eveleen had\r\ncalled forth.\r\n\r\nThere were grave readings in the mornings, and long walks in the\r\nafternoons, when he dragged Charles, in his chair, into many a place he\r\nhad never expected to see again, and enabled him to accompany his mother\r\nand sisters in many a delightful expedition. In the evening there was\r\nmusic, or light reading, especially poetry, as this was encouraged by\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, in the idea that it was better that so excitable and\r\nenthusiastic a person as Guy should have his objects of admiration\r\ntested by Charles\xe2\x80\x99s love of ridicule.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st of\r\nSeptember, one which he greatly relished. Indeed, when he thought of his\r\nown deserted manors, he was heard to exclaim, in commiseration for the\r\nneglect, \xe2\x80\x98Poor partridges!\xe2\x80\x99 The Hollywell shooting was certainly not\r\nlike that at Redclyffe, where he could hardly walk out of his own\r\ngrounds, whereas here he had to bear in mind so many boundaries, that\r\nPhilip was expecting to have to help him out of some direful scrape. He\r\nhad generally walked over the whole extent, and assured himself that the\r\nbirds were very wild, and Bustle the best of dogs, before breakfast, so\r\nas to be ready for all the occupations of the day. He could scarcely be\r\ngrateful when the neighbours, thinking it must be very dull for him to\r\nbe left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her crippled son, used to ask\r\nhim to shoot or dine. He always lamented at first, and ended by enjoying\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nOne night, he came home, in such a state of eagerness, that he must\r\nneeds tell his good news; and, finding no one in the drawing-room, he\r\nran up-stairs, opened Charles\xe2\x80\x99s door, and exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s to be a\r\nconcert at Broadstone!\xe2\x80\x99 Then perceiving that Charles was fast asleep,\r\nhe retreated noiselessly, reserving his rejoicings till morning, when it\r\nappeared that Charles had heard, but had woven the announcement into a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThis concert filled Guy\xe2\x80\x99s head. His only grief was that it was to be in\r\nthe evening, so that Charles could not go to it; and his wonder was\r\nnot repressed at finding that Philip did not mean to favour it with his\r\npresence, since Guy would suffice for squire to Mrs. Edmonstone and her\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Philip was somewhat annoyed by the perpetual conversation about\r\nthe concert, and on the day on which it was to take place resolved on\r\nmaking a long expedition to visit the ruins of an old abbey, far out of\r\nall reports of it. As he was setting out, he was greeted, in a very loud\r\nvoice, by Mr. Gordon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hollo, Morville! how are you? So you have great doings to-night, I\r\nhear!\xe2\x80\x99 and he had only just forced himself from him, when he was again\r\naccosted, this time in a hasty, embarrassed manner,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir, but the ties of relationship--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up as if he was on parade, faced round, and replied\r\nwith an emphatic \xe2\x80\x98Sir!\xe2\x80\x99 as he behold a thin, foreign-looking man, in\r\na somewhat flashy style of dress, who, bowing low, repeated\r\nbreathlessly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon--Sir Guy Morville, I believe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain Morville, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon--I mistook. A thousand pardons,\xe2\x80\x99 and he retreated;\r\nwhile Philip, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s wonder, pursued his walk.\r\n\r\nThe Hollywell party entered Broadstone in a very different temper, and\r\ngreatly did they enjoy the concert, both for themselves and for each\r\nother. In the midst of it, while Amy was intent on the Italian words of\r\na song, Guy touched her hand, and pointed to a line in the programme--\r\n\r\n\r\n          Solo on the violin.... MR. S. B. DIXON.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked up in his face with an expression full of inquiry; but it\r\nwas no time for speaking, and she only saw how the colour mantled on his\r\ncheek when the violinist appeared, and how he looked down the whole time\r\nof the performance, only now and then venturing a furtive though earnest\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nHe did not say anything till they were seated in the carriage, and then\r\nastonished Mrs. Edmonstone by exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be my uncle!--I am sure it must. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride to Broadstone the\r\nfirst thing to-morrow, and find him out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your uncle!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I never thought of that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nS. B. Dixon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I know his name is Sebastian. It cannot be\r\nany one else. You know he went to America. How curious it is! I suppose\r\nthere is no fear of his being gone before I can come in to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think not. Those musical people keep late hours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would go before breakfast. Perhaps it would be best to go to old\r\nRedford, he will know all about him; or to the music-shop. I am so glad!\r\nIt is the very thing I always wished.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone to herself. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say every one would\r\nbe of your mind; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help liking you the better for it. I wish\r\nthe man had kept further off. I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home. I hope\r\nno harm will come of it. I wonder what I ought to do. Shall I caution\r\nhim? No; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can spoil his happiness--and perhaps the man\r\nmay be improved. He is his nearest relation, and I have no right\r\nto interfere. His own good sense will protect him--but I wish Mr.\r\nEdmonstone was at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe therefore did not check his expressions of delight, nor object to\r\nhis going to Broadstone early the next morning. He had just dismounted\r\nbefore the inn-yard, when a boy put a note into his hand, and he was so\r\nabsorbed in its contents, that he did not perceive Philip till after\r\ntwo greetings had passed unheard. When at length he was recalled,\r\nhe started, and exclaimed, rapturously, as he put the note into his\r\ncousin\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See here--it is himself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle. My poor mother\xe2\x80\x99s own brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sebastian Bach Dixon,\xe2\x80\x99 read Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Ha! it was he who took me for you\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw him at the concert--I was sure it could be no other. I came in\r\non purpose to find him, and here he is waiting for me. Is not it a happy\r\nchance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Happy!\xe2\x80\x99 echoed Philip, in a far different tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I have longed for this--for any one who could remember and tell me\r\nof her--of my mother--my poor, dear young mother! And her own brother!\r\nI have been thinking of it all night, and he knows I am here, and is as\r\neager as myself. He is waiting for me,\xe2\x80\x99 ended Guy, hurrying off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, gravely. \xe2\x80\x98Think before acting. I seriously advise\r\nyou to have nothing to do with this man, at least personally. Let me see\r\nhim, and learn what he wants.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wants me,\xe2\x80\x99 impatiently answered Guy. \xe2\x80\x98You are not his nephew.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Do you imagine your relationship is the\r\nsole cause of his seeking you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Guy, with vehemence. \xe2\x80\x98I will not\r\nlisten to suspicions of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is more than suspicion. Hear me calmly. I speak for your good. I\r\nknow this man\xe2\x80\x99s influence was fatal to your father. I know he did all in\r\nhis power to widen the breach with your grandfather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was eighteen years ago,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, walking on, biting his lip in a\r\nfiery fit of impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will not hear. Remember, that his position and associates render\r\nhim no fit companion for you. Nay, listen patiently. You cannot help the\r\nrelationship. I would not have you do otherwise than assist him. Let him\r\nnot complain of neglect, but be on your guard. He will either seriously\r\ninjure you, or be a burden for life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have heard you so far--I can hear no more,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, no longer\r\nrestraining his impetuosity. \xe2\x80\x98He is my uncle, that I know, I care for\r\nnothing else. Position--nonsense! what has that to do with it? I will\r\nnot be set against him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe strode off; but in a few moments turned back, overtook Philip, said--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for your advice. I beg your pardon for my hastiness. You mean\r\nkindly, but I must see my uncle.\xe2\x80\x99 And, without waiting for an answer, he\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nIn short space he was in the little parlour of the music-shop, shaking\r\nhands with his uncle, and exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so glad! I hoped it was you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very noble-hearted! I might have known it would be so with the\r\nson of my dearest sister and of my generous friend!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Dixon,\r\nwith eagerness that had a theatrical air, though it was genuine feeling\r\nthat filled his eyes with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw your name last night\xe2\x80\x99 continued Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I would have tried to speak\r\nto you at once, but I was obliged to stay with Mrs. Edmonstone, as I was\r\nthe only gentleman with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I thought it possible you might not be able to follow the dictate\r\nof your own heart; but this is a fortunate conjuncture, in the absence\r\nof your guardian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy recollected Philip\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance, and it crossed him whether his\r\nguardian might be of the same mind; but he felt confident in having told\r\nall to Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you know I was here?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I learnt it in a most gratifying way. Mr. Redford, without knowing\r\nour connection--for on that I will always be silent--mentioned that the\r\nfinest tenor he had ever known, in an amateur, belonged to his pupil,\r\nSir Guy Morville. You can imagine my feelings at finding you so near,\r\nand learning that you had inherited your dear mother\xe2\x80\x99s talent and\r\ntaste.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe conversation was long, for there was much to hear. Mr. Dixon had\r\nkept up a correspondence at long intervals with Markham, from whom he\r\nheard that his sister\xe2\x80\x99s child survived, and was kindly treated by his\r\ngrandfather; and inquiring again on the death of old Sir Guy, learnt\r\nthat he was gone to live with his guardian, whose name, and residence\r\nMarkham had not thought fit to divulge. He had been much rejoiced to\r\nhear his name from the music-master, and he went on to tell how he had\r\nbeen misled by the name of Morville into addressing the captain, who had\r\na good deal of general resemblance to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s father, a fine tall young\r\nman, of the same upright, proud deportment. He supposed he was the son\r\nof the Archdeacon, and remembering how strongly his own proceedings\r\nhad been discountenanced at Stylehurst, had been much disconcerted, and\r\ndeeming the encounter a bad omen, had used more caution in his advances\r\nto his nephew. It was from sincere affection that he sought his\r\nacquaintance, though very doubtful as to the reception he might meet,\r\nand was both delighted and surprised at such unembarrassed, open-hearted\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nThe uncle and nephew were not made to understand each other. Sebastian\r\nDixon was a man of little education, and when, in early youth, his\r\ntalents had placed him high in his own line, he had led a careless,\r\nextravagant life. Though an evil friend, and fatal counsellor, he had\r\nbeen truly attached to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s father, and the secret engagement, and\r\nrunaway marriage with his beautiful sister, had been the romance of his\r\nlife, promoted by him with no selfish end. He was a proud and passionate\r\nman, and resenting Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to receive his sister as a\r\ndaughter, almost as much as Sir Guy was incensed at the marriage, had\r\nled his brother-in-law to act in a manner which cut off the hope of\r\nreconciliation, and obliged Archdeacon Morville to give up his cause. He\r\nhad gloried in supporting his sister and her husband, and enabling them\r\nto set the old baronet at defiance. But young Morville\xe2\x80\x99s territorial\r\npride could not brook that he should be maintained, and especially that\r\nhis child, the heir of Redclyffe, should be born while he was living at\r\nthe expense of a musician. This feeling, aided by a yearning for home,\r\nand a secret love for his father, mastered his resentment; he took his\r\nresolution, quarrelled with Dixon, and carried off his wife, bent with\r\ndesperation on forcing his father into receiving her.\r\n\r\nSebastian had not surmounted his anger at this step when he learnt its\r\nfatal consequences. Ever since that time, nothing had prospered with\r\nhim: he had married and sunk himself lower, and though he had an\r\nexcellent engagement, the days were past when he was the fashion, and\r\nhis gains and his triumphs were not what they had been. He had a long\r\nlist of disappointments and jealousies with which to entertain Guy, who,\r\non his side, though resolved to like him, and dreading to be too refined\r\nto be friends with his relations, could not feel as thoroughly pleased\r\nas he intended to have been.\r\n\r\nMusic was, however, a subject on which they could meet with equal\r\nenthusiasm, and by means of this, together with the aid of his own\r\nimagination, Guy contrived to be very happy. He stayed with his uncle as\r\nlong as he could, and promised to spend a day with him in London, on his\r\nway to Oxford, in October.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Philip knew that Guy would be with his tutor, he\r\nwalked to Hollywell, came straight up to his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room, asked\r\nher to send Charlotte down to practise, and, seating himself opposite to\r\nher, began--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean to do about this unfortunate rencontre?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean Guy and his uncle? He is very much pleased, poor boy! I\r\nlike his entire freedom from false shame.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A little true shame would be hardly misplaced about such a connection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not his fault, and I hope it will not be his misfortune,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That it will certainly be,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip, \xe2\x80\x98if we are not on our\r\nguard; and, indeed, if we are, there is little to be done with one so\r\nwilful. I might as well have interfered with the course of a whirlwind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Philip; he is too candid to be wilful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot be of your opinion, when I have seen him rushing into this\r\nacquaintance in spite of the warnings he must have had here--to say\r\nnothing of myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, there I must defend him, though you will think me very unwise; I\r\ncould not feel that I ought to withhold him from taking some notice of\r\nso near a relation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip did think her so unwise, that he could only reply, gravely--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must hope it may produce no evil effects.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, much alarmed. \xe2\x80\x98Have you heard anything against\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember, of course, that Guy\xe2\x80\x99s father was regularly the victim of\r\nthis Dixon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes; but he has had enough to sober him. Do you know nothing\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, growing nervously anxious lest she had been\r\ndoing wrong in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been inquiring about him from old Redford, and I should judge\r\nhim to be a most dangerous companion; as, indeed, I could have told from\r\nhis whole air, which is completely that of a rou\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen him, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He paid me the compliment of taking me for Sir Guy, and of course\r\nmade off in dismay when he discovered on whom he had fallen. I have\r\nseldom seen a less creditable-looking individual.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what did Mr. Redford say? Did he know of the connection?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I am happy to say he did not. The fellow has decency enough not\r\nto boast of that. Well, Redford did not know much of him personally: he\r\nsaid he had once been much thought of, and had considerable talent and\r\nexecution, but taste changes, or he has lost something, so that, though\r\nhe stands tolerably high in his profession, he is not a leader. So much\r\nfor his musical reputation. As to his character, he is one of those\r\npeople who are called no one\xe2\x80\x99s enemy but their own, exactly the\r\nintroduction Guy has hitherto happily wanted to every sort of mischief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying to console herself, \xe2\x80\x98that Guy is\r\ntoo much afraid of small faults to be invited by larger evils. While\r\nhe punishes himself for an idle word, he is not likely to go wrong in\r\ngreater matters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is the man in debt or difficulties? Guy heard nothing of that, and I\r\nthought it a good sign.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he is. He ought not, for he has a fixed salary, besides\r\nwhat he gets by playing at concerts when it is not the London season.\r\nThe wasting money on a spendthrift relation would be a far less evil\r\nthan what I apprehend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I knew what to do! It is very unlucky that your uncle is from\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was frightened by the sense of responsibility, and was\r\nonly anxious to catch hold of something to direct her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would you have me do?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, hopelessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Speak seriously to Guy. He must attend to you: he cannot fly out with a\r\nwoman as he does with me. Show him the evils that must result from such\r\nan intimacy. If Dixon was in distress, I would not say a word, for he\r\nwould be bound to assist him but as it is, the acquaintance can serve no\r\npurpose but degrading Guy, and showing him the way to evil. Above all,\r\nmake a point of his giving up visiting him in London. That is the sure\r\nroad to evil. A youth of his age, under the conduct of a worn-out\r\nrou\xc3\xa9, connected with the theatres! I can hardly imagine anything more\r\nmischievous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes; I will speak to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, perfectly\r\nappalled.\r\n\r\nShe promised, but she found the fulfilment difficult, in her dislike of\r\nvexing Guy, her fear of saying what was wrong, and a doubt whether the\r\nappearance of persecuting Mr. Dixon was not the very way to prevent\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s own good sense from finding out his true character, so she waited,\r\nhoping Mr. Edmonstone might return before Guy went to Oxford, or that he\r\nmight write decisively.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone might have known her husband better than to expect him\r\nto write decisively when he had neither herself nor Philip at his elbow.\r\nThe same post had brought him a letter from Guy, mentioning his meeting\r\nwith his uncle, and frankly explaining his plans for London; another\r\nfrom Philip, calling on him to use all his authority to prevent this\r\nintercourse, and a third from his wife. Bewildered between them, he took\r\nthem to his sister, who, being as puzzle-headed as himself, and only\r\nhearing his involved history of the affair, confused him still more; so\r\nhe wrote to Philip, saying he was sorry the fellow had turned up, but he\r\nwould guard against him. He told Guy he was sorry to say that his uncle\r\nused to be a sad scamp, and he must take care, or it would be his poor\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s story over again; and to Mrs. Edmonstone he wrote that it was\r\nvery odd that everything always did go wrong when he was away.\r\n\r\nHe thought these letters a great achievement, but his wife\xe2\x80\x99s perplexity\r\nwas not materially relieved.\r\n\r\nAfter considering a good while, she at length spoke to Guy; but it was\r\nnot at a happy time, for Philip, despairing of her, had just taken on\r\nhimself to remonstrate, and had angered him to the verge of an outbreak.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, as mildly as she could, urged on him that such\r\nintercourse could bring him little satisfaction, and might be very\r\ninconvenient; that his uncle was in no distress, and did not require\r\nassistance; and that it was too probable that in seeking him out he\r\nmight meet with persons who might unsettle his principles,--in short,\r\nthat he had much better give up the visit to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is Philip\xe2\x80\x99s advice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is; but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy looked impatient, and she paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must forgive me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98if I follow my own judgment. If Mr.\r\nEdmonstone chose to lay his commands on me, I suppose I must submit; but\r\nI cannot see that I am bound to obey Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to obey, certainly; but his advice--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is prejudiced and unjust,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that my uncle would attempt to lead me into bad\r\ncompany; and surely you would not have me neglect or look coldly on one\r\nwho was so much attached to my parents. If he is not a gentleman, and is\r\nlooked down on by the world, it is not for his sister\xe2\x80\x99s son to make him\r\nconscious of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like your feelings, Guy; I can say nothing against it, but that I am\r\nmuch afraid your uncle is not highly principled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have only Philip\xe2\x80\x99s account of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are resolved?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I do not like not to take your advice, but I do believe this is my\r\nduty. I do not think my determination is made in self-will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nthoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x98I cannot think that I ought to neglect my uncle, because\r\nI happen to have been born in a different station, which is all I have\r\nheard proved against him,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98You will forgive me, will\r\nyou not, for not following your advice? for really and truly, if you\r\nwill let me say so, I think you would not have given it if Philip had\r\nnot been talking to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone confessed, with a smile, that perhaps it was so; but\r\nsaid she trusted much to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of the world. Guy agreed to\r\nthis; though still declaring Philip had no right to set him against his\r\nuncle, and there the discussion ended.\r\n\r\nGuy went to London. Philip thought him very wilful, and his aunt very\r\nweak; and Mr. Edmonstone, on coming home, said it could not be helped,\r\nand he wished to hear no more about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12\r\n\r\n     Her playful smile, her buoyance wild,\r\n     Bespeak the gentle, mirthful child;\r\n     But in her forehead\xe2\x80\x99s broad expanse,\r\n     Her chastened tones, her thoughtful glance,\r\n     Is mingled, with the child\xe2\x80\x99s light glee,\r\n     The modest maiden\xe2\x80\x99s dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne summer\xe2\x80\x99s day, two years after the ball and review, Mary Ross and her\r\nfather were finishing their early dinner, when she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me this afternoon, papa, I think I shall walk to\r\nHollywell. You know Eveleen de Courcy is there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I did not. What has brought her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As Charles expresses it, she has over-polked herself in London, and is\r\nsent here for quiet and country air. I want to call on her, and to\r\nask Sir Guy to give me some idea as to the singing the children should\r\npractise for the school-feast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you think Sir Guy will come to the feast?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I reckon on him to conceal all the deficiencies in the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsinging.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t desert you, as he did Mrs. Brownlow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O papa! you surely did not think him to blame in that affair?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Honestly, Mary, if I thought about the matter at all, I thought it a\r\npity he should go so much to the Brownlows.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I could tell you the history, if you thought it worth while;\r\nand though it may be gossip, I should like you to do justice to Sir\r\nGuy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well; though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is much danger of my doing\r\notherwise. I only wondered he should become intimate there at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe Mrs. Edmonstone thinks it right he should see as much of the\r\nworld as possible, and not be always at home in their own set.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fair and proper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know she has shown him all the people she could,--had Eveleen\r\nstaying there, and the Miss Nortons, and hunted him out to parties, when\r\nhe had rather have been at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought he was fond of society. I remember your telling me how amused\r\nyou were with his enjoyment of his first ball.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! he was two years younger then, and all was new. He seems to me too\r\ndeep and sensitive not to find more pain than pleasure in commonplace\r\nsociety. I have sometimes seen that he cannot speak either lightly or\r\nharshly of what he disapproves, and people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand him. I was\r\nonce sitting next him, when there was some talking going on about an\r\nelopement; he did not laugh, looked almost distressed, and at last said\r\nin a very low voice, to me, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish people would not laugh about such\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is an extraordinary mixture of gaiety of heart, and seriousness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, when Mrs. Brownlow had her nieces with her, and was giving those\r\nmusical parties, his voice made him valuable; and Mrs. Edmonstone told\r\nhim he ought to go to them. I believe he liked it at first, but he found\r\nthere was no end to it; it took up a great deal of time, and was a style\r\nof thing altogether that was not desirable. Mrs Edmonstone thought at\r\nfirst his reluctance was only shyness and stay-at-home nonsense, that\r\nought to be overcome; but when she had been there, and saw how Mrs.\r\nBrownlow beset him, and the unpleasant fuss they made about his singing,\r\nshe quite came round to his mind, and was very sorry she had exposed him\r\nto so much that was disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Mary, I am glad to hear your account. My impression arose from\r\nsomething Philip Morville said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain Morville never can approve of anything Sir Guy does! It is not\r\nlike Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How improved Charles Edmonstone is. He has lost that spirit of repining\r\nand sarcasm, and lives as if he had an object.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he employs himself now, and teaches Amy to do the same. You know,\r\nafter the governess went, we were afraid little Amy would never do\r\nanything but wait on Charles, and idle in her pretty gentle way; but\r\nwhen he turned to better things so did she, and her mind has been\r\ngrowing all this time. Perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, for she has not lost\r\nher likeness to a kitten, and looks all demure silence with the elders,\r\nbut she takes in what the wise say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is a very good little thing; and I dare say will not be the worse\r\nfor growing up slowly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those two sisters are specimens of fast and slow growth. Laura\r\nhas always seemed to be so much more than one year older than Amy,\r\nespecially of late. She is more like five-and-twenty than twenty. I\r\nwonder if she overworks herself. But how we have lingered over our\r\ndinner!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBy half-past three, Mary was entering a copse which led into Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s field, when she heard gay tones, and a snatch of one of the\r\nsweetest of old songs,--\r\n\r\n           Weep no more, lady; lady, weep no more,\r\n           Thy sorrow is in vain;\r\n           For violets pluck\xe2\x80\x99d, the sweetest showers\r\n           Will ne\xe2\x80\x99er make grow again.\r\n\r\nA merry, clear laugh followed, and a turn in the path showed her Guy,\r\nAmy, and Charlotte, busy over a sturdy stock of eglantine. Guy, little\r\nchanged in these two years,--not much taller, and more agile than\r\nrobust,--was lopping vigorously with his great pruning-knife, Amabel\r\nnursing a bundle of drooping rose branches, Charlotte, her bonnet in a\r\ngarland of wild sweet-brier, holding the matting and continually getting\r\nentangled in the long thorny wreaths.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And here comes the \xe2\x80\x9cfriar of orders gray,\xe2\x80\x9d to tell you so,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed\r\nGuy, as Mary, in her gray dress, came on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that is right, dear good friar,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are so busy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x98Guy has made Mr. Markham send all\r\nthese choice buds from Redclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not from the park,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98we don\xe2\x80\x99t deal much in gardening; but\r\nMarkham is a great florist, and these are his bounties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And are you cutting that beautiful wild rose to pieces?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not a pity?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98We have used up all the stocks in the\r\ngarden, and this is to be transplanted in the autumn.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has been consoling it all the time by telling it it is for its\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98cutting off wild shoots, and putting in better\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never said anything so pretty; and, after all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the\r\ngrand roses will be equal to these purple shoots and blushing buds with\r\nlong whiskers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So Sir Guy was singing about the violets plucked to comfort you. But\r\nyou must not leave off, I want to see how you do it. I am gardener\r\nenough to like to look on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have only two more to put in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nKnife and fingers were busy, and Mary admired the dexterity with which\r\nthe slit was made in the green bark, well armed with firm red thorns,\r\nand the tiny scarlet gem inserted, and bound with cotton and matting.\r\nAt the least critical parts of the work, she asked after the rest of\r\nthe party, and was answered that papa had driven Charles out in the pony\r\ncarriage, and that Laura and Eveleen were sitting on the lawn, reading\r\nand working with mamma. Eveleen was better, but not strong, or equal to\r\nmuch exertion in the heat. Mary went on to speak of her school feast and\r\nask her questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Guy, you must not go before that!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you going away?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is very naughty, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98He is going, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere all, to be stupid, and read mathematics.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A true bill, I am sorry to say,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I am to join a\r\nreading-party for the latter part of the vacation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not before Thursday week, though we are not asking you to\r\nanything worth staying for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, surely you need not go before that!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98need you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I believe I may stay till Friday, and I should delight in the\r\nfeast, thank you, Miss Ross,--I want to study such things. A bit more\r\nmatting, Amy, if you please. There, I think that will do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excellently. Here is its name. See how neatly Charlie has printed it,\r\nMary. Is it not odd, that he prints so well when he writes so badly?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe Seven Sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d There, fair sisterhood, grow and thrive, till I\r\ncome to transplant you in the autumn. Are there any more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that is the last. Now, Mary, let us come to mamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy waited to clear the path of the numerous trailing briery branches,\r\nand the others walked on, Amy telling how sorry they were to lose Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvacation, but that he thought he could not give time enough to\r\nhis studies here, and had settled, at Oxford, to make one of a\r\nreading-party, under the tutorship of his friend, Mr. Wellwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where do they go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not settled. Guy wished it to be the sea-side; but Philip has\r\nbeen recommending a farmhouse in Stylehurst parish, rather nearer St.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s Wells than Stylehurst, but quite out in the moor, and an\r\nimmense way from both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think it will be the place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; Guy thinks it would suit Mr. Wellwood, because he has friends at\r\nSt. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, so he gave his vote for it. He expects to hear how it is\r\nsettled to-day or to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nComing out on the lawn, they found the three ladies sitting under the\r\nacacia, with their books and work. Laura did, indeed, look older than\r\nher real age, as much above twenty as Amy looked under nineteen. She\r\nwas prettier than ever; her complexion exquisite in delicacy, her fine\r\nfigure and the perfect outline of her features more developed; but the\r\nchange from girl to woman had passed over her, and set its stamp on the\r\nanxious blue eye, and almost oppressed brow. Mary thought it would be\r\nhard to define where was that difference. It was not want of bloom,\r\nfor of that Laura had more than any of the others, fresh, healthy,\r\nand bright, while Amy was always rather pale, and Lady Eveleen was\r\npositively wan and faded by London and late hours; nor was it loss of\r\nanimation, for Laura talked and laughed with interest and eagerness; nor\r\nwas it thought, for little Amy, when at rest, wore a meditative, pensive\r\ncountenance; but there was something either added or taken away, which\r\nmade it appear that the serenity and carelessness of early youth had\r\nfled from her, and the air of the cares of life had come over her.\r\n\r\nMary told her plans,--Church service at four, followed by a tea-drinking\r\nin the fields; tea in the garden for the company, and play for the\r\nschool children and all who liked to join them. Every one likes such\r\nfestivals, which have the recommendation of permitting all to do as they\r\nplease, bringing friends together in perfect ease and freedom, with\r\nan object that raises them above the rank of mere gatherings for the\r\npleasure of rich neighbours.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone gladly made the engagement and Lady Eveleen promised to\r\nbe quite well, and to teach the children all manner of new games, though\r\nshe greatly despised the dullness of English children, and had many\r\ndroll stories of the stupidity of Laura\xe2\x80\x99s pupils, communicated to\r\nher, with perhaps a little exaggeration, by Charles, and still further\r\nembellished by herself, for the purpose of exciting Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nMary proceeded to her consultation about the singing, and was\r\nconducted by Guy and Amy to the piano, and when her ears could not be\r\nindoctrinated by their best efforts, they more than half engaged to walk\r\nto East-hill, and have a conversation with the new school-master, whom\r\nMary pitied for having fallen on people so unable to appreciate his\r\nmusical training as herself and her father. The whole party walked back\r\nwith her as far as the shade lasted; and at the end of the next field\r\nshe turned, saw them standing round the stile, thought what happy people\r\nthey were, and then resumed her wonder whither Laura\xe2\x80\x99s youthfulness had\r\nflown.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Philip and Laura had not changed. His regiment had\r\nnever been at any great distance from Hollywell, and he often came,\r\nventuring more as Laura learnt to see him with less trepidation. He\r\nseldom or never was alone with her; but his influence was as strong as\r\never, and look, word, and gesture, which she alone could understand,\r\ntold her what she was to him, and revealed his thoughts. To him she was\r\ndevoted, all her doings were with a view to please him, and deserve his\r\naffection; he was her world, and sole object. Indeed, she was sometimes\r\nstartled by perceiving that tenderly as she loved her own family, all\r\nwere subordinate to him. She had long since known the true name of her\r\nfeelings for him; she could not tell when or how the certainty had come,\r\nbut she was conscious that it was love that they had acknowledged for\r\none another and that she only lived in the light of his love. Still she\r\ndid not realize the evil of concealment; it was so deep a sensation of\r\nher innermost heart, that she never could imagine revealing it to any\r\nliving creature, and she had besides so surrendered her judgment to her\r\nidol, that no thought could ever cross her that he had enjoined what was\r\nwrong. Her heart and soul were his alone, and she left the future to him\r\nwithout an independent desire or reflection. All the embarrassments and\r\ndiscomforts which her secret occasioned her were met willingly for\r\nhis sake, and these were not a few, though time had given her more\r\nself-command, or, perhaps, more properly speaking, had hardened her.\r\n\r\nShe always had a dread of tete-a-tetes and conversations over novels,\r\nand these were apt to be unavoidable when Eveleen was at Hollywell.\r\nThe twilight wanderings on the terrace were a daily habit, and Eveleen\r\nalmost always paired with her. On this evening in particular, Laura was\r\nmade very uncomfortable by Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s declaring that it was positively\r\nimpossible and unnatural that the good heroine of some novel should have\r\nconcealed her engagement from her parents. Laura could not help saying\r\nthat there might be many excuses; then afraid that she was exciting\r\nsuspicion, changed the subject in great haste, and tried to make Eveleen\r\ncome indoors, telling her she would tire herself to death, and vexed\r\nby her cousin\xe2\x80\x99s protestations that the fresh cool air did her good.\r\nBesides, Eveleen was looking with attentive eyes at another pair\r\nwho were slowly walking up and down the shady walk that bordered the\r\ngrass-plot, and now and then standing still to enjoy the subdued silence\r\nof the summer evening, and the few distant sounds that marked the\r\nperfect lull.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How calm--how beautiful!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It only wants the low solemn surge and ripple of the tide, and its dash\r\non the rocks,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98If ever there was music, it is there; but it\r\nmakes one think what the ear must be that can take in the whole of those\r\nharmonics.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How I should like to hear it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And see it. O Amy! to show you the sunny sea,--the sense of breadth\r\nand vastness in that pale clear horizon line, and the infinite number of\r\nfields of light between you and it,--and the free feelings as you stand\r\non some high crag, the wind blowing in your face across half the globe,\r\nand the waves dashing far below! I am growing quite thirsty for the\r\nsea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know, papa said something about your taking your reading-party to\r\nRedclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Markham would like it, and it would put old\r\nMrs. Drew into no end of a fuss.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not like to have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes, I should be all very well; but if they heard I was bringing\r\nthree or four men with me, they would think them regular wild beasts.\r\nThey would be in an awful fright. Besides, it is so long since I have\r\nbeen at home, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t altogether fancy going there till I settle\r\nthere for good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! it will be sad going there at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it has not been my duty yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you will be glad when you get there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I? I wonder if any one has been to shoot the rabbits on the\r\nshag rock. They must have quite overrun it by this time. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike the notion of the first day. There is not only the great change,\r\nbut a stranger at the vicarage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know anything about the new clergyman? I believe Mrs. Ashford is\r\na connection of Lady Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; Thorndale calls them pattern people, and I have no doubt they will\r\ndo great good in the parish. I am sure we want some enlightenment, for\r\nwe are a most primitive race, and something beyond Jenny Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s dame\r\nschool would do us no harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Edmonstone called from the window that they must come in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone thought deeply that night. She had not forgotten her\r\nnotion that Eveleen was attracted by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s manners, and had been curious\r\nto see what would happen when Eveleen was sent to Hollywell for country\r\nair.\r\n\r\nShe had a very good opinion of Lady Eveleen. Since the former visit,\r\nshe had shown more spirit of improvement, and laid aside many little\r\nfollies; she had put herself under Laura\xe2\x80\x99s guidance, and tamed down into\r\nwhat gave the promise of a sensible woman, more than anything that had\r\nhitherto been observed in her; and little addicted to match-making as\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was, she could not help thinking that Eva was almost\r\nworthy of her dear Guy (she never could expect to find anyone she should\r\nthink quite worthy of him, he was too like one of her own children for\r\nthat), and on the other hand, how delighted Lord and Lady Kilcoran would\r\nbe. It was a very pretty castle in the air; but in the midst of it, the\r\nnotion suddenly darted into Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s head, that while she was\r\nthinking of it, it was Amy, not Eveleen, who was constantly with Guy.\r\nReading and music, roses, botany, and walks on the terrace! She looked\r\nback, and it was still the same. Last Easter vacation, how they used\r\nto study the stars in the evening, to linger in the greenhouse in\r\nthe morning nursing the geraniums, and to practise singing over the\r\nschool-room piano; how, in a long walk, they always paired together; and\r\nhow they seemed to share every pursuit or pleasure.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Edmonstone was extremely fond of Guy, and trusted him entirely;\r\nbut she thought she ought to consider how far this should be allowed.\r\nFeeling that he ought to see more of the world, she had sent him as\r\nmuch as she could into society, but it had only made him cling closer to\r\nhome. Still he was but twenty, it was only a country neighbourhood, and\r\nthere was much more for him to see before he could fairly be supposed\r\nto know his own mind. She knew he would act honourably; but she had a\r\nhorror of letting him entangle himself with her daughter before he was\r\nfairly able to judge of his own feelings. Or, if this was only behaving\r\nwith a brother\xe2\x80\x99s freedom and confidence, Mrs. Edmonstone felt it was not\r\nsafe for her poor little Amy, who might learn so to depend on him as\r\nto miss him grievously when this intimacy ceased, as it must when he\r\nsettled at his own home. It would be right, while it was still time, to\r\nmake her remember that they were not brother and sister, and by checking\r\ntheir present happy, careless, confidential intercourse, to save her\r\nfrom the chill which seemed to have been cast on Laura. Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nwas the more anxious, because she deeply regretted not having been\r\nsufficiently watchful in Laura\xe2\x80\x99s case, and perhaps she felt an\r\nunacknowledged conviction that if there was real love on Guy\xe2\x80\x99s part, it\r\nwould not be hurt by a little reserve on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s. Yet to have to speak\r\nto her little innocent daughter on such a matter disturbed her so much,\r\nthat she could hardly have set about it, if Amy had not, at that very\r\nmoment, knocked at her door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, what has kept you up so late?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have been sitting in Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s room, mamma, hearing about her London\r\nlife; and then we began to settle our plans for to-morrow, and I came to\r\nask what you think of them. You know Guy has promised to go and hear\r\nthe East-hill singing, and we were proposing, if you did not mind it,\r\nto take the pony-carriage and the donkey, and go in the morning to\r\nEast-hill, have luncheon, and get Mary to go with us to the top of the\r\ngreat down, where we have never been. Guy has been wanting us, for a\r\nlong time past, to go and see the view, and saying there is a track\r\nquite smooth enough to drive Charlie to the top.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy wondered at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s look of hesitation. In fact, the scheme was\r\nso accordant with their usual habits that it was impossible to find any\r\nobjection; yet it all hinged on Guy, and the appointment at East-hill\r\nmight lead to a great many more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you wish us to do anything else, mamma? We don\xe2\x80\x99t care about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98I see no reason against it.\r\nBut--\xe2\x80\x99 and she felt as if she was making a desperate plunge, \xe2\x80\x98there is\r\nsomething I want to say to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy stood ready to hear, but Mrs. Edmonstone paused. Another effort, and\r\nshe spoke:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, my dear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to find fault, but I thought of advising you\r\nto take care. About Guy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe very brilliant pink which instantly overspread Amy\xe2\x80\x99s face made her\r\nmother think her warning more expedient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been spending a great deal of time with him of late, very\r\nsensibly and pleasantly, I know; I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame you at all, my dear, so\r\nyou need not look distressed. I only want you to be careful. You know,\r\nthough we call him cousin, he is scarcely a relation at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mamma, don\xe2\x80\x99t go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said poor little Amy, hurriedly; \xe2\x80\x98indeed I am\r\nvery sorry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor Amy understood that it was imputed to her that she had been forward\r\nand unmaidenly. Mrs. Edmonstone saw her extreme distress, and, grieved\r\nat the pain she had inflicted, tried to reassure her as much as might be\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, my dear, you have done nothing amiss. I only intended to tell\r\nyou to be cautious for fear you should get into a way of going on which\r\nmight not look well. Don\xe2\x80\x99t make any great difference, I only meant that\r\nthere should not be quite so much singing and gardening alone with him,\r\nor walking in the garden in the evening. You can manage to draw back a\r\nlittle, so as to keep more with me or with Laura, and I think that will\r\nbe the best way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEvery word, no matter what, increased the burning of poor Amy\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks.\r\nA broad accusation of flirting would have been less distressing to many\r\ngirls than this mild and delicate warning was to one of such shrinking\r\nmodesty and maidenly feeling. She had a sort of consciousness that she\r\nenjoyed partaking in his pursuits, and this made her sense of confusion\r\nand shame overwhelming. What had she been thoughtlessly doing? She could\r\nnot speak, she could not look. Her mother put her arm round her, and Amy\r\nhid her head on her shoulder, and held her fast. Mrs. Edmonstone kissed\r\nand caressed the little fluttering bird, then saying, \xe2\x80\x98Good night, my\r\nown dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 unloosed her embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, dear mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need not be sorry, my dear, only be careful. Good night.\xe2\x80\x99 And it\r\nwould be hard to say whether the mother or the daughter had the hottest\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nPoor little Amy! what was her dismay as she asked herself, again and\r\nagain, what she had been doing and what she was to do? The last was\r\nplain,--she knew what was right, and do it she must. There would be an\r\nend of much that was pleasant, and a fresh glow came over her as she\r\nowned how very, very pleasant; but if it was not quite the thing,--if\r\nmamma did not approve, so it must be. True, all her doings received\r\ntheir zest from Guy,--her heart bounded at the very sound of his\r\nwhistle, she always heard his words through all the din of a whole\r\nparty,--nothing was complete without him, nothing good without his\r\nwithout his approval,--but so much the more shame for her. It was a\r\nkind of seeking him which was of all things the most shocking. So there\r\nshould be an end of it,--never mind the rest! Amy knelt down, and prayed\r\nthat she might keep her resolution.\r\n\r\nShe did not know how much of her severity towards herself was learned\r\nfrom the example that had been two years before her. Nor did she think\r\nwhether the seeking had been mutual; she imagined it all her own doing,\r\nand did not guess that she would give pain to Guy by withdrawing herself\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nThe morning gave vigour to her resolution, and when Laura came to ask\r\nwhat mamma thought of their project, Amy looked confused--said she\r\ndid not know--she believed it would not do. But just then in came her\r\nmother, to say she had been considering of the expedition, and meant to\r\njoin it herself. Amy understood, blushed, and was silently grateful.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura wanted to alter her demeanour towards Guy, being perfectly\r\ncool, and not in the least conscious, she had acted with great judgment,\r\nseen exactly what to do, and what to leave undone, so as to keep up\r\nappearances. But it was not so with Amy. She was afraid of herself,\r\nand was in extremes. She would not come down till the last moment,\r\nthat there might be no talking in the window. She hardly spoke at\r\nbreakfast-time, and adhered closely to Laura and Eveleen when\r\nthey wandered in the garden. Presently Charles looked out from the\r\ndressing-room window, calling,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, Guy is ready to read.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t come. Read without me,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, hoping Charlie would not\r\nbe vexed, and feeling her face light up again.\r\n\r\nThe hour for the expedition came, and Amy set off walking with Laura,\r\nbecause Guy was with Mrs. Edmonstone; but presently, after holding open\r\na gate for Charlotte, who was on the donkey, he came up to the sisters,\r\nand joined in the conversation. Amy saw something in the hedge--a\r\nfoxglove, she believed--it would have done as well if it had been a\r\nnettle--she stopped to gather it, hoping to fall behind them, but they\r\nwaited for her. She grew silent, but Guy appealed to her. She ran on to\r\nCharlotte and her donkey, but at the next gate Guy had joined company\r\nagain. At last she put herself under her mother\xe2\x80\x99s wing, and by keeping\r\nwith her did pretty well all the time she was at East-hill. But when\r\nthey went on, she was riding the donkey, and it, as donkeys always are,\r\nwas resolved on keeping a-head of the walkers, so that as Guy kept by\r\nher side, it was a more absolute tete-a-tete than ever.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the hill they found a fine view, rich and extensive, broad\r\nwoods, fields waving with silvery barley, trim meadows, fair hazy blue\r\ndistance, and a dim line of sea beyond. This, as Amy knew, was Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelight, and further, what she would not tell herself, was that he\r\nchiefly cared for showing it to her. It was so natural to call him to\r\nadmire everything beautiful, and ask if it was equal to Redclyffe, that\r\nshe found herself already turning to him to participate in his pleasure,\r\nas he pointed out all that was to be seen; but she recollected, blushed,\r\nand left her mother to speak. He had much to show. There was a hanging\r\nwood on one side of the hill, whence he had brought her more than one\r\nbotanical prize, and she must now visit their native haunts. It was too\r\ngreat a scramble for Mrs. Edmonstone, with all her good will; Eveleen\r\nwas to be kept still, and not to tire herself; Laura did not care for\r\nbotany, nor love brambles, and Amy was obliged to stand and look into\r\nthe wood, saying, \xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can,\xe2\x80\x99 and then run\r\nback to Mary and Charles; while Charlotte was loudly calling out that it\r\nwas delightful fun, and that she was very stupid. In another minute Guy\r\nhad overtaken her, and in his gentle, persuasive voice, was telling her\r\nit was very easy, and she must come and see the bird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest orchises.\r\nShe would have liked it above all things, but she thought it very kind\r\nof Guy not to seem angry when she said, \xe2\x80\x98No, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary, after what she had seen yesterday, could not guess at the real\r\nreason, or she would have come with her; but she thought Amy was tired,\r\nand would rather not. Poor Amy was tired, very tired, before the walk\r\nwas over, but her weary looks made it worse, for Guy offered her his\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x98No thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I am getting on very well;\xe2\x80\x99 and she\r\ntrudged on resolutely, for her mother was in the carriage, and to lag\r\nbehind the others would surely make him keep with her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for her fatigue, but Amy found it a good\r\nexcuse for not wandering in the garden, or joining in the music. It\r\nhad been a very uncomfortable day; she hoped she had done right; at any\r\nrate, she had the peaceful conviction of having tried to do so.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Amy was steady to her resolution. No reading with the two\r\nyouths, though Charles scolded her; sitting in her room till Guy was\r\ngone out, going indoors as soon as she heard him return, and in the\r\nevening staying with Charles when her sisters and cousins went out; but\r\nthis did not answer, for Guy came and sat by them. She moved away as\r\nsoon as possible, but the more inclined she was to linger, the more she\r\nthought she ought to go; so murmuring something about looking for Laura,\r\nshe threw on her scarf, and sprung to the window. Her muslin caught on\r\nthe bolt, she turned, Guy was already disentangling it, and she met\r\nhis eye. It was full of anxious, pleading inquiry, which to her seemed\r\nupbraiding, and, not knowing what to do, she exclaimed, hurriedly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; no harm done!\xe2\x80\x99 and darted into the garden, frightened\r\nto feel her face glowing and her heart throbbing. She could not help\r\nlooking back to see if he was following. No, he was not attempting it;\r\nhe was leaning against the window, and on she hastened, the perception\r\ndawning on her that she was hurting him; he might think her rude,\r\nunkind, capricious, he who had always been so kind to her, and when he\r\nwas going away so soon. \xe2\x80\x98But it is right; it must be done,\xe2\x80\x99 said little\r\nAmy to herself, standing still, now that she was out of sight. \xe2\x80\x98If I\r\nwas wrong before, I must bear it now, and he will see the rights of it\r\nsooner or later. The worst of all would be my not doing the very _most_\r\n_right_ to please any body. Besides he can\xe2\x80\x99t really care for missing\r\nsilly little Amy when he has mamma and Charlie. And he is going away, so\r\nit will be easier to begin right when he comes back. Be that as it may,\r\nit must be done. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get Charlie to tell me what he was saying about\r\nthe painted glass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13\r\n\r\n     Oh, thou child of many prayers!\r\n     Life hath quicksands--life hath snares--\r\n     Care and age come unawares.\r\n\r\n     Like the swell of some sweet tune,\r\n     Morning rises into noon,\r\n     May glides onward into June.\r\n                              --Longfellow\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with Amy? What makes her so odd?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charles, as\r\nhis mother came to wish him good night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little dear! don\xe2\x80\x99t take any notice,\xe2\x80\x99 was all the answer he\r\nreceived; and seeing that he was to be told no more, he held his peace.\r\n\r\nLaura understood without being told. She, too, had thought Guy and Amy\r\nwere a great deal together, and combining various observations, she\r\nperceived that her mother must have given Amy a caution. She therefore\r\nset herself, like a good sister, to shelter Amy as much as she could,\r\nsave her from awkward situations, and, above all, to prevent her altered\r\nmanner from being remarked. This was the less difficult, as Eveleen was\r\nsubdued and languid, and more inclined to lie on the sofa and read than\r\nto look out for mirth.\r\n\r\nAs to poor little Amy, her task was in one way become less hard, for Guy\r\nhad ceased to haunt her, and seemed to make it his business to avoid all\r\nthat could cause her embarrassment; but in another way it hurt her\r\nmuch more, for she now saw the pain she was causing. If obliged to do\r\nanything for her, he would give a look as if to ask pardon, and then\r\nher rebellious heart would so throb with joy as to cause her dismay at\r\nhaving let herself fall into so hateful a habit as wishing to attract\r\nattention. What a struggle it was not to obey the impulse of turning\r\nto him for the smile with which he would greet anything in conversation\r\nthat interested them both, and how wrong she thought it not to be more\r\nconsoled when she saw him talking to Eveleen, or to any of the others,\r\nas if he was doing very well without her. This did not often happen; he\r\nwas evidently out of spirits, and thoughtful, and Amy was afraid some\r\nstorm might be gathering respecting Mr. Sebastian Dixon, about whom\r\nthere always seemed to be some uncomfortable mystery.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone saw everything, and said nothing. She was very sorry for\r\nthem both, but she could not interfere, and could only hope she had done\r\nright, and protected Amy as far as she was able. She was vexed now and\r\nthen to see Eveleen give knowing smiles and significant glances, feared\r\nthat she guessed what was going on, and wondered whether to give her a\r\nhint not to add to Amy\xe2\x80\x99s confusion; but her great dislike to enter on\r\nsuch a subject prevailed, and she left things to take their course,\r\nthinking that, for once, Guy\xe2\x80\x99s departure would be a relief.\r\n\r\nThe approach of anything in the shape of a party of pleasure was one\r\nof the best cures for Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s ailments, and the evening before Mary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntea-drinking, she was in high spirits, laughing and talking a great\r\ndeal, and addressing herself chiefly to Guy. He exerted himself to\r\nanswer, but it did not come with life and spirit, his countenance did\r\nnot light up, and at last Eveleen said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah! I see I am a dreadful bore.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go away, and leave you to repose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lady Eveleen!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed, in consternation; \xe2\x80\x98what have I been\r\ndoing--what have I been thinking of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, that is best known to yourself, though I think perhaps I could\r\ndivine,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with that archness and grace that always seemed\r\nto remove the unfavourable impression that her proceedings might have\r\ngiven. \xe2\x80\x98Shall I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, colouring crimson, and then trying to laugh off\r\nhis confusion, and find some answer, but without success; and Eveleen,\r\nperceiving her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were upon her, suddenly recollected that she\r\nhad gone quite as far as decorum allowed, and made as masterly a retreat\r\nas the circumstances permitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I have always thought a \xe2\x80\x9cpenny for your thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d the boldest\r\noffer in the world, and now it is proved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis scene made Mrs. Edmonstone doubly annoyed, the next morning, at\r\nwaking with a disabling headache, which made it quite impossible for\r\nher to attempt going to Mary Ross\xe2\x80\x99s fete. With great sincerity, Amy\r\nentreated to be allowed to remain at home, but she thought it would\r\nonly be making the change more remarkable; she did not wish Mary to be\r\ndisappointed; among so many ladies, Amy could easily avoid getting into\r\ndifficulties; while Laura would, she trusted, be able to keep Eveleen in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe day was sunny, and all went off to admiration. The gentlemen\r\npresided over the cricket, and the ladies over \xe2\x80\x98blind man\xe2\x80\x99s buff\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n\xe2\x80\x98thread my needle;\xe2\x80\x99 but perhaps Mary was a little disappointed that,\r\nthough she had Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s bodily presence, the peculiar blitheness and\r\nanimation which he usually shed around him were missing. He sung at\r\nchurch, he filled tiny cups from huge pitchers of tea, he picked up\r\nand pacified a screaming child that had tumbled off a gate--he was\r\nas good-natured and useful as possible, but he was not his joyous and\r\nbrilliant self.\r\n\r\nAmy devoted herself to the smallest fry, played assiduously for three\r\nquarters of an hour with a fat, grave boy of three, who stood about a\r\nyard-and-a-half from her, solemnly throwing a ball into her lap, and\r\nnever catching it again, took charge of many caps and bonnets, and\r\nwalked about with Louisa Harper, a companion whom no one envied her.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the sky clouded over, it became chilly, and a shower\r\nbegan to fall. Laura pursued Eveleen, and Amy hunted up Charlotte from\r\nthe utmost parts of the field, where she was the very centre of \xe2\x80\x98winding\r\nup the clock,\xe2\x80\x99 and sorely against her will, dragged her off the wet\r\ngrass. About sixty yards from the house, Guy met them with an umbrella,\r\nwhich, without speaking, he gave to Charlotte. Amy said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand again came that look. Charlotte rattled on, and hung back to talk to\r\nGuy, so that Amy could not hasten on without leaving her shelterless.\r\nIt may be believed that she had the conversation to herself. At the\r\ndoor they met Mary and her father, going to dismiss their flock, who had\r\ntaken refuge in a cart-shed at the other end of the field. Guy asked\r\nif he could be of any use; Mr. Ross said no, and Mary begged Amy and\r\nCharlotte to go up to her room, and change their wet shoes.\r\n\r\nThere, Amy would fain have stayed, flushed and agitated as those looks\r\nmade her; but Charlotte was in wild spirits, delighted at having been\r\ncaught in the rain, and obliged to wear shoes a mile too large, and\r\neager to go and share the fun in the drawing-room. There, in the\r\ntwilight, they found a mass of young ladies herded together, making a\r\nconfused sound of laughter, and giggling, while at the other end of the\r\nroom, Amy could just see Guy sitting alone in a dark corner.\r\n\r\nCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s tongue was soon the loudest in the medley, to which Amy did\r\nnot at first attend, till she heard Charlotte saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you should hear Guy sing that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered to Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cThe Land of the Leal,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish he would sing it now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen Harper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This darkness would be just the time for music,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen; \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nquite a witching time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask him?\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen. \xe2\x80\x98Come, Charlotte, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\ngirl, go and ask him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, whispering and giggling with an affectation\r\nof shyness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No! why not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is so grave,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\nEveleen had been growing wilder and less guarded all day, and now,\r\npartly liking to tease and surprise the others, and partly emboldened by\r\nthe darkness, she answered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will do him all manner of good. Here, Charlotte, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how\r\nto make him. Tell him Amy wants him to do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! tell him so,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Ellen, and they laughed in a manner that\r\noverpowered Amy with horror and shyness. She sprung to seize Charlotte,\r\nand stop her; she could not speak, but Louisa Harper caught her arm, and\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s grave orders were drowned in a universal titter, and suppressed\r\nexclamation,--\xe2\x80\x98Go, Charlotte, go; we will never forgive you if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 Amy struggled to cry, breaking from Louisa, and springing up in\r\na sort of agony. Guy, who had such a horror of singing anything deep in\r\npathos or religious feeling to mixed or unfit auditors, asked to do\r\nso in her name! \xe2\x80\x98Stop! oh, Charlotte!\xe2\x80\x99 It was too late; Charlotte,\r\nthoughtless with merriment, amused at vexing Laura, set up with\r\napplause, and confident in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s good nature, had come to him, and was\r\nsaying,--\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Guy! Amy wants you to come and sing us the \xe2\x80\x9cLand of the\r\nLeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy saw him start up. What, did he think of her? Oh, what! He stepped\r\ntowards them. The silly girls cowered as if they had roused a lion. His\r\nvoice was not loud--it was almost as gentle as usual; but it quivered,\r\nas if it was hard to keep it so, and, as well as she could see, his\r\nface was rigid and stern as iron. \xe2\x80\x98Did you wish it?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, addressing\r\nhimself to her, as if she was the only person present.\r\n\r\nHer breath was almost gone. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 she faltered. She\r\ncould not exculpate herself, she saw it looked like an idle, almost like\r\nan indecorous trick, unkind, everything abhorrent to her and to him,\r\nespecially in the present state of things. His eyes were on her, his\r\nhead bent towards her; he waited for an answer. \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nall she could say.\r\n\r\nThere was--yes, there was--one of those fearful flashes of his kindling\r\neye. She felt as if she was shrinking to nothing; she heard him say, in\r\na low, hoarse tone, \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I cannot;\xe2\x80\x99 then Mr. Ross, Mary, lights\r\ncame in; there was a bustle and confusion, and when next she was clearly\r\nconscious, Laura was ordering the carriage.\r\n\r\nWhen it came, there was an inquiry for Sir Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is gone home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ross. \xe2\x80\x98I met him in the passage, and wished\r\nhim good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Ross did not add what he afterwards told his daughter, that Guy\r\nseemed not to know whether it was raining or not; that he had put an\r\numbrella into his hand, and seen him march off at full speed, through\r\nthe pouring rain, with it under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe ladies entered the carriage. Amy leant back in her corner, Laura\r\nforbore to scold either Eveleen or Charlotte till she could have them\r\nseparately; Eveleen was silent, because she was dismayed at the effect\r\nshe had produced, and Charlotte, because she knew there was a scolding\r\nimpending over her.\r\n\r\nThey found no one in the drawing-room but Mr. Edmonstone and Charles,\r\nwho said they had heard the door open, and Guy run up-stairs, but they\r\nsupposed he was wet through, as he had not made his appearance. It was\r\nvery inhospitable in the girls not to have made room for him in the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAmy went to see how her mother was, longing to tell her whole trouble,\r\nbut found her asleep, and was obliged to leave it till the morrow. Poor\r\nchild, she slept very little, but she would not go to her mother before\r\nbreakfast, lest she should provoke the headache into staying another\r\nday. Guy was going by the train at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and she was resolved\r\nthat something should be done; so, as soon as her father had wished Guy\r\ngoodbye, and ridden off to his justice meeting, she entreated her mother\r\nto come into the dressing-room, and hear what she had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, mamma! the most dreadful thing has happened!\xe2\x80\x99 and, hiding her face,\r\nshe told her story, ending with a burst of weeping as she said how Guy\r\nwas displeased. \xe2\x80\x98And well he might be! That after all that has vexed him\r\nthis week, I should tease him with such a trick. Oh, mamma, what must he\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, there was a good deal of silliness; but you need not treat it\r\nas if it was so very shocking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but it hurt him! He was angry, and now I know how it is, he is\r\nangry with himself for being angry. Oh, how foolish I have been! What\r\nshall I do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we can let him know it was not your fault,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, thinking it might be very salutary for Charlotte to send her\r\nto confess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think so?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! that would make it all\r\ncomfortable. Only it was partly mine, for not keeping Charlotte in\r\nbetter order, and we must not throw it all on her and Eveleen. You think\r\nwe may tell him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think he ought not to be allowed to fancy you let your name be so\r\nused.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA message came for Mrs. Edmonstone, and while she was attending to it,\r\nAmy hastened away, fully believing that her mother had authorized her\r\nto go and explain it to Guy, and ask his pardon. It was what she thought\r\nthe natural thing to do, and she was soon by his side, as she saw him\r\npacing, with folded arms, under the wall.\r\n\r\nMuch had lately been passing in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He had gone on floating on\r\nthe sunny stream of life at Hollywell, too happy to observe its especial\r\ncharm till the change in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s manner cast a sudden gloom over all. Not\r\ntill then did he understand his own feelings, and recognize in her the\r\nbeing he had dreamt of. Amy was what made Hollywell precious to him.\r\nSternly as he was wont to treat his impulses, he did not look on his\r\naffection as an earthborn fancy, liable to draw him from higher things,\r\nand, therefore, to be combated; he deemed her rather a guide and guard\r\nwhose love might arm him, soothe him, and encourage him. Yet he had\r\nlittle hope, for he did not do justice to his powers of inspiring\r\naffection; no one could distrust his temper and his character as much as\r\nhe did himself, and with his ancestry and the doom he believed attached\r\nto his race, with his own youth and untried principles, with his\r\nundesirable connections, and the reserve he was obliged to exercise\r\nregarding them, he considered himself as objectionable a person as could\r\nwell be found, as yet untouched by any positive crime, and he respected\r\nthe Edmonstones too much to suppose that these disadvantages could be\r\ncounterbalanced for a moment by his position; indeed, he interpreted\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s coolness by supposing that there was a desire to discourage his\r\nattentions. No poor tutor or penniless cousin ever felt he was doing\r\na more desperate thing in confessing an attachment, than did Sir Guy\r\nMorville when he determined that all should be told, at the risk of\r\nlosing her for ever, and closing against himself the doors of his happy\r\nhome. It was not right and fair by her parents, he thought, so to regard\r\ntheir daughter, and live in the same house with his sentiments unavowed,\r\nand as to Amy herself, if his feelings had reached such a pitch of\r\nsensitiveness that he must needs behave like an angry lion, because her\r\nname had been dragged into an idle joke, it was high time it should\r\nbe explained, unpropitious as the moment might be for declaring his\r\nattachment, when he had manifested such a temper as any woman might\r\ndread. Thus he made up his mind that, come of it what might, he would\r\nnot leave Hollywell that day till the truth was told. Just as he was\r\nturning to find Mrs. Edmonstone and \xe2\x80\x98put his fate to the touch,\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nlittle figure stood beside him, and Amy\xe2\x80\x99s own sweet, low tones were\r\nsaying, imploringly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy, I wanted to tell you how sorry I am you were so teased last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, taken extremely by surprise\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was our fault, I could not stop it; I should have kept Charlotte in\r\nbetter order, but they would not let her hear me. I knew it was what you\r\ndislike particularly, and I was very sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--I was--I was. But no matter now. Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 he added earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98may I\r\nask you to walk on with me a little way? I must say something to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWas this what \xe2\x80\x98mamma\xe2\x80\x99 objected to? Oh no! Amy felt she must stay now,\r\nand, in truth, she was glad it was right, though her heart beat fast,\r\nfast, faster, as Guy, pulling down a long, trailing branch of Noisette\r\nrose, and twisting it in his hand, paused for a few moments, then spoke\r\ncollectedly, and without hesitation, though with the tremulousness of\r\nsubdued agitation, looking the while not at her, but straight before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You ought to be told why your words and looks have such effect on me as\r\nto make me behave as I did last night. Shame on me for such conduct!\r\nI know its evil, and how preposterous it must make what I have to tell\r\nyou. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know now long it has been, but almost ever since I came\r\nhere, a feeling has been growing up in me towards you, such as I can\r\nnever have for any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe flame rushed into Amy\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and no one could have told what she\r\nfelt, as he paused again, and then went on speaking more quickly, as if\r\nhis emotion was less under control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If ever there is to be happiness for me on earth, it must be through\r\nyou; as you, for the last three years, have been all my brightness here.\r\nWhat I feel for you is beyond all power of telling you, Amy! But I know\r\nfull well all there is against me--I know I am untried, and how can I\r\ndare to ask one born to brightness and happiness to share the doom of my\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s impulse was that anything shared with him would be welcome; but\r\nthe strength of the feeling stifled the power of expression, and she\r\ncould not utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It seems selfish even to dream of it,\xe2\x80\x99 he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x98yet I must,--I\r\ncannot help it. To feel that I had your love to keep me safe, to know\r\nthat you watched for me, prayed for me, were my own, my Verena,--oh Amy!\r\nit would be more joy than I have ever dared to hope for. But mind,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded, after another brief pause, \xe2\x80\x98I would not even ask you to answer me\r\nnow, far less to bind yourself, even if--if it were possible. I know\r\nmy trial is not come; and were I to render myself, by positive act,\r\nunworthy even to think of you, it would be too dreadful to have\r\nentangled you, and made you unhappy. No. I speak now, because I ought\r\nnot to remain here with such feelings unknown to your father and\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment, close on the other side of the box-tree clump, were\r\nheard the wheels of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s garden-chair, and Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\ntalking to him, as he made his morning tour round the garden. Amy flew\r\noff, like a little bird to its nest, and never stopped till, breathless\r\nand crimson, she darted into the dressing room, threw herself on her\r\nknees, and with her face hidden in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s lap, exclaimed in\r\npanting, half-smothered, whispers, which needed all Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nintuition to make them intelligible,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mamma, mamma, he says--he says he loves me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Edmonstone was not so very much surprised; but she had\r\nno time to do more than raise and kiss the burning face, and see, at\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s glance, how bright was the gleam of frightened joy, in the\r\ndowncast eye and troubled smile; when two knocks, given rapidly, were\r\nheard, and almost at the same moment the door opened, and Guy stood\r\nbefore her, his face no less glowing than that which Amy buried again on\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come in, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, as he stood doubtful for a moment\r\nat the door, and there was a sweet smile of proud, joyful affection on\r\nher face, conveying even more encouragement than her tone. Amy raised\r\nher head, and moved as if to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x98unless you wish it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy did not wish it, especially now that she had her mother to save\r\nher confusion, and she sat on a footstool, holding her mother\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nlooking up to Guy, whenever she felt bold enough, and hanging down her\r\nhead when he said what showed how much more highly he prized her than\r\nsilly little Amy could deserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know what I am come to say,\xe2\x80\x99 he began, standing by the\r\nmantel-shelf, as was his wont in his conferences with Mrs. Edmonstone;\r\nand he repeated the same in substance as he had said to Amy in the\r\ngarden, though with less calmness and coherence, and far more warmth of\r\nexpression, as if, now that she was protected by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\r\nhe exercised less force in self-restraint.\r\n\r\nNever was anyone happier than was Mrs. Edmonstone; loving Guy so\r\nheartily, seeing the beauty of his character in each word, rejoicing\r\nthat such affection should be bestowed on her little Amy, exulting\r\nin her having won such a heart, and touched and gratified by the free\r\nconfidence with which both had at once hastened to pour out all to her,\r\nnot merely as a duty, but in the full ebullition of their warm young\r\nlove. The only difficulty was to bring herself to speak with prudence\r\nbecoming her position, whilst she was sympathizing with them as ardently\r\nas if she was not older than both of them put together. When Guy spoke\r\nof himself as unproved, and undeserving of trust, it was all she could\r\ndo to keep from declaring there was no one whom she thought so safe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While you go on as you have begun, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you tell me to hope! Oh, Mrs. Edmonstone, is it wrong that an\r\nearthly incentive to persevere should have power which sometimes seems\r\ngreater than the true one?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is the best and strongest ground of all for trusting you,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe. \xe2\x80\x98If you spoke keeping right only for Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, then I might fear;\r\nbut when she is second, there is confidence indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If speaking were all!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is one thing I ought to say,\xe2\x80\x99 she proceeded; \xe2\x80\x98you know you are\r\nvery young, and though--though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can say so in my own\r\nperson, a prudent woman would say, that you have seen so little of the\r\nworld, that you may easily meet a person you would like better than such\r\na quiet little dull thing as your guardian\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe look that he cast on Amy was worth seeing, and then, with a smile,\r\nhe answered--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t say it in your own person.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very bold and presumptuous in me to say anything at all in papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling; \xe2\x80\x98but I am sure he will think in\r\nthe same way, that things ought to remain as they are, and that it is\r\nour duty not to allow you to be, or to feel otherwise than entirely at\r\nliberty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say it may be right in you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, grudgingly. \xe2\x80\x98However,\r\nI must not complain. It is too much that you should not reject me\r\naltogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo all three that space was as bright a gleam of sunshine as ever\r\nembellished life, so short as to be free from a single care, a perfectly\r\nserenely happy present, the more joyous from having been preceded by\r\nvexations, each of the two young things learning that there was love\r\nwhere it was most precious. Guy especially, isolated and lonely as he\r\nstood in life, with his fear and mistrust of himself, was now not only\r\nallowed to love, and assured beyond his hopes that Amy returned his\r\naffection, but found himself thus welcomed by the mother, and gathered\r\ninto the family where his warm feelings had taken up their abode, while\r\nhe believed himself regarded only as a guest and a stranger.\r\n\r\nThey talked on, with happy silences between, Guy standing all the time\r\nwith his branch of roses in his hand, and Amy looking up to him, and\r\ntrying to realize it, and to understand why she was so very, very happy.\r\n\r\nNo one thought of time till Charlotte rushed in like a whirlwind,\r\ncrying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, here you are! We could not think what had become of you. There has\r\nDeloraine been at the door these ten minutes, and Charlie sent me to\r\nfind you, for he says if you are too late for Mrs. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, she\r\nwill write such an account of you to Philip as you will never get over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nVery little of this was heard, there was only the instinctive\r\nconsternation of being too late. They started up, Guy threw down his\r\nroses, caught Amy\xe2\x80\x99s hand and pressed it, while she bent down her head,\r\nhiding the renewed blush; he dashed out of the room, and up to his own,\r\nwhile Mrs. Edmonstone and Charlotte hurried down. In another second,\r\nhe was back again, and once more Amy felt the pressure of his hand on\r\nhers--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 he said; and she whispered another \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99 the only\r\nwords she had spoken.\r\n\r\nOne moment more he lingered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Verena!\xe2\x80\x99 said he; but the hurrying sounds in the hall warned\r\nhim--he sprang down to the drawing-room. Even Charles was on the alert,\r\nstanding, leaning against the table, and looking eager; but Guy had not\r\ntime to let him speak, he only shook hands, and wished good-bye, with a\r\nsort of vehement agitated cordiality, concealed by his haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98Amy! Is not she coming to wish him\r\ngood-bye?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said something, of which \xe2\x80\x98up-stairs\xe2\x80\x99 was the only audible word; held\r\nMrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s hand fast, while she said, in a low voice--\xe2\x80\x98You shall\r\nhear from papa to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 then sprung on his horse, and looked up. Amy\r\nwas at the window, he saw her head bending forward, under its veil of\r\ncurls, in the midst of the roses round the lattice; their eyes met once\r\nmore, he gave one beamy smile, then rode off at full speed, with Bustle\r\nracing after him, while Amy threw herself on her knees by her bed, and\r\nwith hands clasped over her face, prayed that she might be thankful\r\nenough, and never be unworthy of him.\r\n\r\nEvery one wanted to get rid of every one else except Mrs. Edmonstone;\r\nfor all but Charlotte guessed at the state of the case, and even she\r\nperceived that something was going on. Lady Eveleen was in a state of\r\ngreat curiosity; but she had mercy, she knew that they must tell each\r\nother before it came to her turn, and very good-naturedly she invited\r\nCharlotte to come into the garden with her, and kept her out of the way\r\nby a full account of her last fancy ball, given with so much spirit and\r\nhumour that Charlotte could not help attending.\r\n\r\nCharles and Laura gained little by this kind manoeuvre, for their mother\r\nwas gone up again to Amy, and they could only make a few conjectures.\r\nCharles nursed his right hand, and asked Laura how hers felt? She looked\r\nup from her work, to which she had begun to apply herself diligently,\r\nand gazed at him inquiringly, as if to see whether he intended anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For my part,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98I certainly thought he meant to carry off the\r\nhands of some of the family.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose we shall soon hear it explained,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Soon! If I had an many available legs as you, would I wait for other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s soon?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think she had rather be left to mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, going on\r\nwith her work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you do think there is something in it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, peering up\r\nin her face; but he saw he was teasing her, recollected that she\r\nhad long seemed out of spirits, and forbore to say any more. He was,\r\nhowever, too impatient to remain longer quiet, and presently Laura saw\r\nhim adjusting his crutches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Charlie! I am sure it will only be troublesome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to my own room,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, hopping off. \xe2\x80\x98I presume you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to forbid that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis room had a door into the dressing-room, so that it was an excellent\r\nplace for discovering all from which they did not wish to exclude him,\r\nand he did not believe he should be unwelcome; for though he might\r\npretend it was all fun and curiosity, he heartily loved his little Amy.\r\n\r\nThe tap of his crutches, and the slow motion with which he raised\r\nhimself from step to step, was heard, and Amy, who was leaning against\r\nher mother, started up, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mamma, here comes Charlie! May I tell him? I am sure I can\xe2\x80\x99t meet him\r\nwithout.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suspect he has guessed it already,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, going\r\nto open the door, just as he reached the head of the stairs, and then\r\nleaving them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking full at her carnation cheeks, \xe2\x80\x98are you\r\nprepared to see me turn lead-coloured, and fall into convulsions, like\r\nthe sister with the spine complaint?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Charlie! You know it. But how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy was helping him to the sofa, laid him down, and sat by him on the\r\nold footstool; he put his arm round her neck, and she rested her head on\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 I give you joy, my small woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, talking the more\r\nnonsense because of the fullness in his throat; \xe2\x80\x98and I hope you give me\r\ncredit for amazing self-denial in so doing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Charlie--dear Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99 and she kissed him, she could not blush more,\r\npoor little thing, for she had already reached her utmost capability of\r\nredness--\xe2\x80\x98it is no such thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No such thing? What has turned you into a turkey-cock all at once or\r\nwhat made him nearly squeeze off my unfortunate fingers? No such thing,\r\nindeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean--I mean, it is not _that_. We are so very young, and I am so\r\nsilly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that his reason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must make me so much better and wiser. Oh, if I could but be good\r\nenough!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor that matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one else would be good enough to take\r\ncare of such a silly little thing. But what is the that, that it is, or\r\nis not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing now, only when we are older. At least, you know papa has not\r\nheard it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Provided my father gives his consent, as the Irish young lady added to\r\nall her responses through the marriage service. But tell me all--all you\r\nlike, I mean--for you will have lovers\xe2\x80\x99 secrets now, Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone had, meantime, gone down to Laura. Poor Laura, as soon\r\nas her brother had left the room, she allowed the fixed composure of her\r\nface to relax into a restless, harassed, almost miserable expression,\r\nand walked up and down with agitated steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O wealth, wealth!\xe2\x80\x99--her lips formed the words, without uttering\r\nthem--\xe2\x80\x98what cruel differences it makes! All smooth here! Young, not\r\nto be trusted, with strange reserves, discreditable connections,--that\r\nfamily,--that fearful temper, showing itself even to her! All will be\r\noverlooked! Papa will be delighted, I know he will! And how is it with\r\nus? Proved, noble, superior, owned as such by all, as Philip is, yet,\r\nfor that want of hateful money, he would be spurned. And, for this--for\r\nthis--the love that has grown up with our lives must be crushed down and\r\nhidden--our life is wearing out in wearying self-watching!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe lock of the door turned, and Laura had resumed her ordinary\r\nexpression before it opened, and her mother came in: but there was\r\nanything but calmness beneath, for the pang of self-reproach had\r\ncome--\xe2\x80\x98Was it thus that she prepared to hear these tidings of her\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 began Mrs. Edmonstone, with the eager smile of one\r\nbringing delightful news, and sure of sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear, little Amy! I hope--\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nher eyes filled with tears; but she had learnt to dread any outbreak of\r\nfeeling, conquered it in a minute, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has happened? How does it stand?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It stands, at least as far as I can say without papa, as the dear\r\nGuy very rightly and wisely wished it to stand. There is no positive\r\nengagement, they are both too young; but he thought it was not right to\r\nremain here without letting us know his sentiments towards her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA pang shot through Laura; but it was but for a moment. Guy might doubt\r\nwhere Philip need never do so. Her mother went on,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Their frankness and confidence are most beautiful. We know dear little\r\nAmy could not help it; but there was something very sweet, very noble,\r\nin his way of telling all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother pang for Laura. But no! it was only poverty that was to blame.\r\nPhilip would speak as plainly if his prospects were as fair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I hope it will do well,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must,--it will!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Edmonstone, giving way to her joyful\r\nenthusiasm of affection. \xe2\x80\x98It is nonsense to doubt, knowing him as we do.\r\nThere is not a man in the world with whom I could be so happy to trust\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura could not hear Guy set above all men in the world, and she\r\nremembered Philip\xe2\x80\x99s warning to her, two years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is much that is very good and very delightful about him,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nsaid, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are thinking of the Morville temper,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother; \xe2\x80\x98but I am\r\nnot afraid of it. A naturally hot temper, controlled like his by strong\r\nreligious principle, is far safer than a cool easy one, without the\r\nprinciple.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura thought this going too far, but she felt some compensation due\r\nto Guy, and acknowledged how strongly he was actuated by principle.\r\nHowever--and it was well for her--they could not talk long, for Eveleen\r\nand Charlotte were approaching, and she hastily asked what was to be\r\ndone about telling Eva, who could not fail to guess something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must tell her, and make her promise absolute secrecy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I will speak to her myself; but I must wait till I have\r\nseen papa. There is no doubt of what he will say, but we have been\r\ntaking quite liberties enough in his absence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura did not see her sister till luncheon, when Amy came down, with\r\na glow on her cheeks that made her so much prettier than usual, that\r\nCharles wished Guy could have seen her. She said little, and ran up\r\nagain as soon as she could. Laura followed her; and the two sisters\r\nthrew their arms fondly round each other, and kissed repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma has told you? said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, it has made me so very happy; and\r\nevery one is so kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m only afraid--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has begun so well--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, nonsense! You cannot think I could be so foolish as to be afraid\r\nfor him! Oh no! But if he should take me for more than I am worth. O\r\nLaura, Laura! What shall I do to be as good and sensible as you! I must\r\nnot be silly little Amy any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps he likes you best as you are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean cleverness: I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that,--and he knows how stupid\r\nI am,--but I am afraid he thinks there is more worth in me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow, he has a sort of sunshine in his eyes and mind, that makes all\r\nhe cares about seem to him brighter and better than it really is. I am\r\nafraid he is only dressing me up with that sunshine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be strange sunshine that you want to make you better and\r\nbrighter than you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, kissing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy folding her hands, and standing\r\nwith her face raised, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t do now, as you told me once, to have no\r\nbones in my character. I must learn to be steady and strong, if I can;\r\nfor if this is to be, he will depend on me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean, to advise him,\r\nfor he knows better than anybody, but to be--you know what--if vexation,\r\nor trouble was to come! And Laura, think if he was to depend on me, and\r\nI was to fail! Oh, do help me to have firmness and self-command, like\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a long time ago that we talked of your wanting bones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, before he came; but I never forget it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura was obliged to go out with Eveleen. All went their different ways;\r\nand Amy had the garden to herself to cool her cheeks in. But this was a\r\nvain operation, for a fresh access of burning was brought on while\r\nLaura was helping her to dress for dinner, when her father\xe2\x80\x99s quick step\r\nsounded in the passage. He knocked at her door, and as she opened it, he\r\nkissed her on each cheek; and throwing his arm round her, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Miss Amy, you have made a fine morning\xe2\x80\x99s work of it! A pretty\r\nthing, for young ladies to be accepting offers while papa is out of the\r\nway. Eh, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy knew this was a manifestation of extreme delight; but it was not\r\nvery pleasant to Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you have made a conquest!\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Mr. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98and I heartily\r\nwish you joy of it, my dear. He is as amiable and good-natured a youth\r\nas I would wish to see; and I should say the same if he had not a\r\nshilling in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s heart bounded; but she knew, whatever her father might fancy,\r\nthe reality would be very different if Guy were as poor as Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall write to him this very evening,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98and tell him,\r\nif he has the bad taste to like such a silly little white thing, I am\r\nnot the man to stand in his way. Eh, Amy? Shall I tell him so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell him what you please, dear papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? What I please? Suppose I say we can\xe2\x80\x99t spare our little one, and he\r\nmay go about his business?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of you, papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, she\xe2\x80\x99s a good little thing--sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be teased. Eh, Laura? what\r\ndo you think of it, our beauty, to see your younger sister impertinent\r\nenough to set up a lover, while your pink cheeks are left in the lurch?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura not being wont to make playful repartees, her silence passed\r\nunnoticed. Her feelings were mixed; but perhaps the predominant one was\r\nsatisfaction that it was not for her pink cheeks that she was valued.\r\n\r\nIt had occurred to Mrs. Edmonstone that it was a curious thing, after\r\nher attempt at scheming for Eveleen, to have to announce to her that Guy\r\nwas attached to her own daughter; nay, after the willingness Eveleen had\r\nmanifested to be gratified with any attention Guy showed her, it seemed\r\ndoubtful for a moment whether the intelligence would be pleasing to her.\r\nHowever, Eveleen was just the girl to like men better than women, and\r\nnever to be so happy as when on the verge of flirting; it would probably\r\nhave been the same with any other youth that came in her, way, and Guy\r\nmight fully be acquitted of doing more than paying her the civilities\r\nwhich were requisite from him to any young lady visitor. He had, two\r\nyears ago, when a mere boy, idled, laughed, and made fun with her, but\r\nhis fear of trifling away his time had made him draw back, before he had\r\ninvolved himself in what might have led to anything further; and during\r\nthe present visit, no one could doubt that he was preoccupied with\r\nAmy. At any rate, it was right that Eveleen should know the truth, in\r\nconfidence, if only to prevent her from talking of any surmises she\r\nmight have.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was set at ease in a moment. Eveleen was enchanted,\r\ndanced round and round the room, declared they would be the most\r\ncharming couple in the world; she had seen it all along; she was so\r\ndelighted they had come to an understanding at last, poor things, they\r\nwere so miserable all last week; and she must take credit to herself for\r\nhaving done it all. Was not her aunt very much obliged to her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Eva,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone, into whose mind the notion\r\nnever entered that any one could boast of such a proceeding as hers last\r\nnight; but the truth was that Eveleen, feeling slightly culpable, was\r\ndelighted that all had turned out so well, and resolved to carry it off\r\nwith a high hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure! Poor little Amy! when she looked ready to sink into the\r\nearth, she little knew her obligations to me! Was not it the cleverest\r\nthing in the world? It was just the touch they wanted--the very thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, I am glad I know that you are sometimes given to talking\r\nnonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe me serious? You won\xe2\x80\x99t be grateful to me for my\r\nlucky hit\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen, looking comically injured. \xe2\x80\x98Oh auntie, that is\r\nvery hard, when I shall believe to my dying day that I did it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Eva, if I thought it had been done by design, I should find it\r\nvery hard to forgive you for it at all, rather hard even to accept Guy,\r\nso you had better not try to disturb my belief that it was only that\r\nspirit of mischief that makes you now and then a little mad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear! what a desperate scolding you must have given poor little\r\nCharlotte!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Eveleen, quaintly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone could not help laughing as she confessed that she had\r\naltogether forgotten Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you will. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go on forgetting her,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Eveleen. \xe2\x80\x98She only\r\ndid what she was told, and did not know the malice of it. There, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nrelenting! There\xe2\x80\x99s a good aunt! And now, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t be grateful, as\r\nany other mamma in the world would have been, and as I calculated on,\r\nwhen I pretended to have been a prudent, designing woman, instead of a\r\nwild mischievous monkey at least you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me enough to invite me\r\nto the wedding. Oh! what a beauty of a wedding it will be! I\xe2\x80\x99d come from\r\nKilcoran all the way on my bare knees to see it. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me be\r\nbridesmaid, and have a ball after it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no saying what I may do, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll only be a good girl, and\r\nhold your tongue. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prevent your telling anything to\r\nyour mamma, of course, but pray don\xe2\x80\x99t let it go any further. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nMaurice hear it, I have especial reasons for wishing it should not be\r\nknown. You know it is not even an engagement, and nothing must be done\r\nwhich can make Guy feel in the least bound?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEveleen promised, and Mrs. Edmonstone knew that she had sense and proper\r\nfeeling enough for her promise to deserve trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14\r\n\r\n     For falsehood now doth flow,\r\n     And subject faith doth ebbe,\r\n     Which would not be, if reason ruled,\r\n     Or wisdom weav\xe2\x80\x99d the webbe.\r\n\r\n     The daughter of debate,\r\n     That eke discord doth sowe,\r\n     Shal reape no gaine where former rule\r\n     Hath taught stil peace to growe.\r\n                        --QUEEN ELIZABETH\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \xe2\x80\x98ATHENAEUM TERRACE,\r\n                                 ST MILDRED\xe2\x80\x99S,\r\n                                 August 4th,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PHILIP,--Thank you for returning the books, which were brought\r\nsafely by Sir Guy. I am sorry you do not agree in my estimate of them. I\r\nshould have thought your strong sense would have made you perceive that\r\nreasoning upon fact, and granting nothing without tangible proof, were\r\nthe best remedy for a dreamy romantic tendency to the weakness and\r\ncredulity which are in the present day termed poetry and faith. It is\r\ncurious to observe how these vague theories reduce themselves to the\r\nabsurd when brought into practice. There are two Miss Wellwoods here,\r\ndaughters of that unfortunate man who fell in a duel with old Sir Guy\r\nMorville, who seem to make it their business to become the general\r\nsubject of animadversion, taking pauper children into their house, where\r\nthey educate them in a way to unfit them for their station, and teach\r\nthem to observe a sort of monastic rule, preaching the poor people in\r\nthe hospital to death, visiting the poor at all sorts of strange hours.\r\nDr Henley actually found one of them, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, in a\r\nmiserable lodging-house, filled with the worst description of inmates.\r\nQuite young women, too, and with no mother or elder person to direct\r\nthem; but it is the fashion among the attendants at the new chapel to\r\nadmire them. This subject has diverted me from what I intended to say\r\nwith respect to the young baronet. Your description agrees with all I\r\nhave hitherto seen, though I own I expected a Redclyffe Morville to\r\nhave more of the \xe2\x80\x9cheros de roman\xe2\x80\x9d, or rather of the grand tragic cast of\r\nfigure, as, if I remember right, was the case with this youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather, a much finer and handsomer young man. Sir Guy is certainly\r\ngentlemanlike, and has that sort of agreeability which depends on high\r\nanimal spirits. I should think him clever, but superficial; and with his\r\nmania for music, he can hardly fail to be merely an accomplished man. In\r\nspite of all you said of the Redclyffe temper, I was hardly prepared to\r\nfind it so ready to flash forth on the most inexplicable provocations.\r\nIt is like walking on a volcano. I have seen him two or three times draw\r\nhimself up, bite his lip, and answer with an effort and a sharpness that\r\nshows how thin a crust covers the burning lava; but I acknowledge that\r\nhe has been very civil and attentive, and speaks most properly of what\r\nhe owes to you. I only hope he will not be hurt by the possession of so\r\nlarge a property so early in life, and I have an idea that our good aunt\r\nat Hollywell has done a good deal to raise his opinion of himself. We\r\nshall, of course, show him every civility in our power, and give him the\r\nadvantage of intellectual society at our house. His letters are directed\r\nto this place, as you know South Moor Farm is out of the cognizance\r\nof the post. They seem to keep up a brisk correspondence with him from\r\nHollywell. Few guardians\xe2\x80\x99 letters are, I should guess, honoured with\r\nsuch deepening colour as his while reading one from my uncle. He tells\r\nme he has been calling at Stylehurst; it is a pity, for his sake, that\r\nColonel Harewood is at home, for the society of those sons is by no\r\nmeans advisable for him. I can hardly expect to offer him what is likely\r\nto be as agreeable to him as the conversation and amusements of Edward\r\nand Tom Harewood, who are sure to be at home for the St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nraces. I hear Tom has been getting into fresh scrapes at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98Your affectionate sister,\r\n                                          \xe2\x80\x98MARGARET HENLEY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98ATHENAEUM TERRACE.\r\n                                  ST. MILDRED\xe2\x80\x99S,\r\n                                  Sept. 6th.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PHILIP,--No one can have a greater dislike than myself to what\r\nis called mischief-making; therefore I leave it entirely to you to make\r\nwhat use you please of the following facts, which have fallen under my\r\nnotice. Sir Guy Morville has been several times at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, in\r\ncompany with Tom Harewood, and more than once alone with some strange\r\nquestionable-looking people; and not many days ago, my maid met him\r\ncoming out of a house in one of the low streets, which it is hard to\r\nassign a motive for his visiting. This, however, might be accident, and\r\nI should never have thought of mentioning it, but for a circumstance\r\nthat occurred this morning. I had occasion to visit Grey\xe2\x80\x99s Bank, and\r\nwhile waiting in conversation with Mr. Grey, a person came in whom I\r\nknew to be a notorious gambler, and offered a cheque to be changed. As\r\nit lay on the counter, my eye was caught by the signature. It was my\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s. I looked again, and could not be mistaken. It was a draft for\r\n\xc2\xa330 on Drummond, dated the 12th of August, to Sir Guy Morville, signed\r\nC. Edmonstone, and endorsed in Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own writing, with the name of\r\nJohn White. In order that I might be certain that I was doing the poor\r\nyoung man no injustice, I outstayed the man, and asked who he was,\r\nwhen Mr. Grey confirmed me in my belief that it was one Jack White,\r\na jockeying sort of man who attends all the races in the country, and\r\nmakes his livelihood by betting and gambling. And now, my dear brother,\r\nmake what use of this fact you think fit, though I fear there is\r\nlittle hope of rescuing the poor youth from the fatal habits which are\r\nhereditary in his family, and must be strong indeed not to have been\r\neradicated by such careful training as you say he has received. I leave\r\nit entirely to you, trusting in your excellent judgment, and only hoping\r\nyou will not bring my name forward. Grieving much at having to be the\r\nfirst to communicate such unpleasant tidings, which will occasion so\r\nmuch vexation at Hollywell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98Your affectionate sister,\r\n                                         \xe2\x80\x98MARGARET HENLEY.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Morville was alone when he received the latter of these letters.\r\nAt first, a look divided between irony and melancholy passed over his\r\nface, as he read his sister\xe2\x80\x99s preface and her hearsay evidence, but,\r\nas he went farther, his upper lip curled, and a sudden gleam, as of\r\nexultation in a verified prophecy, lighted his eye, shading off\r\nquickly, however, and giving place to an iron expression of rigidity\r\nand sternness, the compressed mouth, coldly-fixed eye, and sedate\r\nbrow, composed into a grave severity that might have served for an\r\nimpersonation of stern justice. He looked through the letter a second\r\ntime, folded it up, put it in his pocket, and went about his usual\r\naffairs; but the expression did not leave his face all day; and the next\r\nmorning he took a day-ticket by the railway to Broadstone, where, as it\r\nwas the day of the petty sessions, he had little doubt of meeting Mr.\r\nEdmonstone. Accordingly, he had not walked far down the High Street,\r\nbefore he saw his uncle standing on the step of the post-office, opening\r\na letter he had just received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! Philip, what brings you here? The very man I wanted. Coming to\r\nHollywell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, I go back this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, and, as he spoke,\r\nhe saw that the letter which Mr. Edmonstone held, and twisted with a\r\nhasty, nervous movement, was in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s writing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I am glad you are here, at any rate. Here is the most\r\nextraordinary thing! What possesses the boy I cannot guess. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Guy\r\nwriting to me for--What do you think? To send him a thousand pounds!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip in an expressive tone; yet, as if he was not very\r\nmuch amazed; \xe2\x80\x98no explanation, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, none at all. Here, see what he says yourself. No! Yes, you may,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadded Mr. Edmonstone, with a rapid glance at the end of the letter,--a\r\nmovement, first to retain it, and then following his first impulse, with\r\nan unintelligible murmuring.\r\n\r\nPhilip read,--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98SOUTH MOOR, SEPT. 7th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR MR. EDMONSTONE,--You will be surprised at the request I have to\r\nmake you, after my resolution not to exceed my allowance. However, this\r\nis not for my own expenses, and it will not occur again. I should be\r\nmuch obliged to you to let me have \xc2\xa31OOO, in what manner you please,\r\nonly I should be glad if it were soon. I am sorry I am not at liberty to\r\ntell you what I want it for, but I trust to your kindness. Tell Charlie\r\nI will write to him in a day or two, but, between our work, and walking\r\nto St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s for the letters, which we cannot help doing every\r\nday, the time for writing is short. Another month, however, and what a\r\nholiday it will be! Tell Amy she ought to be here to see the purple of\r\nthe hills in the early morning; it almost makes up for having no sea.\r\nThe races have been making St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s very gay; indeed, we laugh at\r\nWellwood for having brought us here, by way of a quiet place. I never\r\nwas in the way of so much dissipation in my life.\r\n\r\n                                 \xe2\x80\x98Yours very affectionately,\r\n                                              \xe2\x80\x98GUY MORVILLE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what do you think of it? What would you do in my place--eh,\r\nPhilip! What can he want of it, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, tormenting\r\nhis riding-whip, and looking up to study his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s face, which, with\r\nstern gravity in every feature, was bent over the letter, as if to\r\nweigh every line. \xe2\x80\x98Eh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mr. Edmonstone, several times,\r\nwithout obtaining an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is no place for discussion,\xe2\x80\x99 at last said Philip, deliberately\r\nreturning the letter. \xe2\x80\x98Come into the reading-room. We shall find no one\r\nthere at this hour. Here we are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well--well--well,\xe2\x80\x99 began Mr. Edmonstone, fretted by his coolness to the\r\nextreme of impatience, \xe2\x80\x98what do you think of it? He can\xe2\x80\x99t be after any\r\nmischief; \xe2\x80\x98tis not in the boy; when--when he is all but--Pooh! what am I\r\nsaying? Well, what do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid it confirms but too strongly a report which I received\r\nyesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From your sister? Does she know anything about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, from my sister. But I was very unwilling to mention it, because\r\nshe particularly requests that her name may not be used. I came here to\r\nsee whether you had heard of Guy lately, so as to judge whether it was\r\nneedful to speak of it. This convinces me; but I must beg, in the first\r\ninstance, that you will not mention her, not even to my aunt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, yes; very well. I promise. Only let me hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Young Harewood has, I fear, led him into bad company. There can now be\r\nno doubt that he has been gambling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was not prepared for the effect of these words. His uncle started\r\nup, exclaiming--\xe2\x80\x98Gambling! Impossible! Some confounded slander! I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t believe one word of it! I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear such things said of him,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nrepeated, stammering with passion, and walking violently about the room.\r\nThis did not last long; there was something in the unmoved way in which\r\nPhilip waited till he had patience to listen, which gradually mastered\r\nhim; his angry manner subsided, and, sitting down, he continued the\r\nargument, in a would-be-composed voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is utterly impossible! Remember, he thinks himself bound not so much\r\nas to touch a billiard cue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could have thought it impossible, but for what I have seen of the\r\nway in which promises are eluded by persons too strictly bound,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x98The moral force of principle is the only efficient pledge.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Principle! I should like to see who has better principles than Guy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98You have said so yourself, fifty times, and your\r\naunt has said so, and Charles. I could as soon suspect myself.\xe2\x80\x99 He was\r\ngrowing vehement, but again Philip\xe2\x80\x99s imperturbability repressed his\r\nviolence, and he asked, \xe2\x80\x98Well, what evidence have you? Mind, I am not\r\ngoing to believe it without the strongest. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I would\r\nbelieve my own eyes against him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very sad to find such confidence misplaced,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Most\r\nsincerely do I wish this could be proved to be a mistake; but this\r\nextraordinary request corroborates my sister\xe2\x80\x99s letter too fully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me hear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone feebly. Philip produced his letter,\r\nwithout reading the whole of it; for he could not bear the appearance of\r\ngossip and prying, and would not expose his sister; so he pieced it out\r\nwith his own words, and made it sound far less discreditable to her. It\r\nwas quite enough for Mr. Edmonstone; the accuracy of the details seemed\r\nto strike him dumb; and there was a long silence, which he broke by\r\nsaying, with a deep sigh,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who could have thought it? Poor little Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, ay. I did not mean to have said anything of it, I am sure; but\r\nthey did it among them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, growing ashamed, under\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s eye, as of a dreadful piece of imprudence. \xe2\x80\x98I was out of the\r\nway at the time, but I could not refuse my consent, you know, as things\r\nstood then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say that Amy is engaged to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, no--not exactly engaged, only on trial, you understand, to see if\r\nhe will be steady. I was at Broadstone; \xe2\x80\x98twas mamma settled it all.\r\nPoor little thing, she is very much in love with him, I do believe, but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s an end of everything now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very fortunate this has been discovered in time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Instead of pitying her, I should rejoice in her escape.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, ruefully. \xe2\x80\x98Who could have thought it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid the mischief is of long standing,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Philip,\r\nresolved, since he saw his uncle so grieved, to press him strongly,\r\nthinking that to save Amy from such a marriage was an additional motive.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He could hardly have arrived at losing as much as a thousand pounds,\r\nall at once, in this month at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. Depend upon it, that\r\npainful as it may be at present, there is great reason, on her account,\r\nto rejoice in the discovery. You say he has never before applied, to you\r\nfor money?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a farthing beyond his allowance, except this unlucky thirty pounds,\r\nfor his additional expense of the tutor and the lodging.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You remember, however, that he has always seemed short of money, never\r\nappeared able to afford himself any little extra expense. You have\r\nnoticed it, I know. You remember, too, how unsatisfactory his reserve\r\nabout his proceedings in London has been, and how he has persisted in\r\ndelaying there, in spite of all warnings. The work, no doubt, began\r\nthere, under the guidance of his uncle; and now the St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s races\r\nand Tom Harewood have continued it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish he had never set foot in the place!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay; for Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, the exposure is an advantage, if not for his own.\r\nThe course must have been long since begun; but he contrived to avoid\r\nwhat could lead to inquiry, till he has at length involved himself in\r\nsome desperate scrape. You see, he especially desires to have the money\r\n_soon_, and he never even attempts to say you would approve of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he has the grace not to say that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Altogether, it is worse than I could have thought possible,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip. I could have believed him unstable and thoughtless; but the\r\nconcealment, and the attempting to gain poor Amy\xe2\x80\x99s affections in the\r\nmidst of such a course--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Edmonstone, now fully provoked; \xe2\x80\x98there is the\r\nmonstrous part. He thought I was going to give up my poor little girl to\r\na gambler, did he? but he shall soon see what I think of him,--riches,\r\nRedclyffe, title, and all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew that would be your feeling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Feel! Yes; and he shall feel it, too. So, Sir Guy, you thought you had\r\nan old fool of a guardian, did you, whom you could blind as you pleased?\r\nbut you shall soon see the difference!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better begin cautiously,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Remember his unfortunate\r\ntemper, and write coolly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coolly? You may talk of coolness; but \xe2\x80\x98tis enough to make one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood boil to be served in such a way. With the face to be sending her\r\nmessages in the very same letter! That is a pass beyond me, to stand\r\ncoolly to see my daughter so treated.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would only give him the opportunity of saying what he can for\r\nhimself. He may have some explanation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit of no explanation! Passing himself off for steadiness\r\nitself; daring to think of my daughter, and all the time going on in\r\nthis fashion! I hate underhand ways! I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no explanation. He may\r\ngive up all thoughts of her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write and tell him so before I\xe2\x80\x99m a day\r\nolder; nay, before I stir from this room. My little Amy, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip put no obstacles in the way of this proposal, for he knew that\r\nhis uncle\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure, though hot at first, was apt to evaporate\r\nin exclamations; and he thought it likely that his good nature, his\r\npartiality for his ward, his dislike to causing pain to his daughter,\r\nand, above all, his wife\xe2\x80\x99s blind confidence in Guy, would, when once at\r\nhome, so overpower his present indignation as to prevent the salutary\r\nstrictness which was the only hope of reclaiming Guy. Beside, a letter\r\nwritten under Philip\xe2\x80\x99s inspection was likely to be more guarded, as well\r\nas more forcible, than an unassisted composition of his own, as was,\r\nindeed, pretty well proved by the commencement of his first attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Guy,--I am more surprised than I could have expected at your\r\napplication.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip read this aloud, so as to mark its absurdity, and he began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am greatly astonished, as well as concerned, at your application,\r\nwhich confirms the unpleasant reports--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why say anything of reports?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Reports are nothing. A man\r\nis not forced to defend himself from reports.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,--hum--ha,--the accounts I have received. No. You say there is not\r\nto be a word of Mrs. Henley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a word that can lead her to be suspected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confirms--confirms--\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t write as if you went on hearsay evidence. Speak of\r\nproofs--irrefragable proofs--and then you convict him at once, without\r\npower of eluding you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Edmonstone proceeded to write, that the application confirmed\r\nthe irrefragable proofs, then laughed at himself, and helplessly begged\r\nPhilip to give him a start. It now stood thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your letter of this morning has caused me more concern than surprise,\r\nas it unhappily only adds confirmation to the intelligence already in\r\nmy possession; that either from want of resolution to withstand the\r\nseductions of designing persons, or by the impetuosity and instability\r\nof your own character, you have been led into the ruinous and degrading\r\npractice of gambling; and that from hence proceed the difficulties that\r\noccasion your application to me for money. I am deeply grieved at thus\r\nfinding that neither the principles which have hitherto seemed to guide\r\nyou, nor the pledges which you used to hold sacred, nor, I may add, the\r\nfeelings you have so recently expressed towards a member of my family,\r\nhave been sufficient to preserve you from yielding to a temptation which\r\ncould never be presented to the mind of any one whose time was properly\r\noccupied in the business of his education.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that all I am to say about her,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98after\r\nthe atrocious way the fellow has treated her in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since it is, happily, no engagement, I cannot see how you can, with\r\npropriety, assume that it is one, by speaking of breaking it off.\r\nBesides, give him no ground for complaint, or he will take refuge in\r\nbelieving himself ill-used. Ask him if he can disprove it, and when he\r\ncannot, it will be time enough to act further. But wait--wait, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\nthe pen was moving over the paper, impatient to dash forward. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nnot told him yet of what you accuse him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip meditated a few moments, then produced another sentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no means of judging how long you have been following this\r\nunhappy course; I had rather believe it is of recent adoption, but I do\r\nnot know how to reconcile this idea with the magnitude of your demand,\r\nunless your downward progress has been more rapid than usual in such\r\nbeginnings. It would, I fear, be quite vain for me to urge upon you all\r\nthe arguments and reasons that ought to have been present to your mind,\r\nand prevented you from taking the first fatal step. I can only entreat\r\nyou to pause, and consider the ruin and degradation to which this\r\nhateful vice almost invariably conducts its victims, and consistently\r\nwith my duty as your guardian, everything in my power shall be done\r\nto extricate you from the embarrassments in which you have involved\r\nyourself. But, in the first place, I make it a point that you treat me\r\nwith perfect confidence, and make a full, unequivocal statement of your\r\nproceedings; above all, that you explain the circumstances, occasioning\r\nyour request for this large sum. Remember, I say, complete candour on\r\nyour part will afford the only means of rescuing you from difficulties,\r\nor of in any degree restoring you to my good opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo far the letter had proceeded slowly, for Philip was careful and\r\ndeliberate in composition, and while he was weighing his words, Mr.\r\nEdmonstone rushed on with something unfit to stand, so as to have to\r\nbegin over again. At last, the town clock struck five; Philip started,\r\ndeclaring that if he was not at the station in five minutes, he should\r\nlose the train; engaged to come to Hollywell on the day an answer might\r\nbe expected, and hastened away, satisfied by having seen two sheets\r\nnearly filled, and having said there was nothing more but to sign, seal,\r\nand send it.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone had, however, a page of note-paper more, and it was with\r\na sensation of relief that he wrote,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish, from the bottom of my heart, that you could clear yourself. If\r\na dozen men had sworn it till they were black in the face, I would not\r\nhave believed it of you that you could serve us in such a manner,\r\nafter the way you have been treated at home, and to dare to think of my\r\ndaughter with such things on your mind. I could never have believed it,\r\nbut for the proofs Philip has brought; and I am sure he is as sorry as\r\nmyself. Only tell the whole truth, and I will do my best to get you out\r\nof the scrape. Though all else must be at an end between us, I am your\r\nguardian still, and I will not be harsh with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe posted his letter, climbed up his tall horse, and rode home, rather\r\nheavy-hearted; but his wrath burning out as he left Broadstone behind\r\nhim. He saw his little Amy gay and lively, and could not bear to sadden\r\nher; so he persuaded himself that there was no need to mention\r\nthe suspicions till he had heard what Guy had to say for himself.\r\nAccordingly, he told no one but his wife; and she, who thought Guy as\r\nunlikely to gamble as Amy herself, had not the least doubt that he would\r\nbe able to clear himself, and agreed that it was much better to keep\r\nsilence for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\r\n   How much I have disabled mine estate,\r\n   By something showing a more swelling port\r\n   Than my faint means would grant continuance.\r\n                         --Merchant of Venice\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s was a fashionable summer resort, which the virtues of a\r\nmineral spring, and the reputation of Dr. Henley, had contributed\r\nto raise to a high degree of prosperity. It stood at the foot of a\r\nmagnificent range of beautifully formed hills, where the crescents and\r\nvillas, white and smart, showed their own insignificance beneath the\r\npurple peaks that rose high above them.\r\n\r\nAbout ten miles distant, across the hills, was Stylehurst, the parish\r\nof the late Archdeacon Morville, and the native place of Philip and his\r\nsister Margaret. It was an extensive parish, including a wide tract of\r\nthe hilly country; and in a farm-house in the midst of the moorland,\r\nmidway between St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s and the village of Stylehurst, had Mr.\r\nWellwood fixed himself with his three pupils.\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s first visit was of course to Mrs. Henley, and she was, on her\r\nside, prepared by her brother to patronize him as Philip would have\r\ndone in her place. Her patronage was valuable in her own circle; her\r\nconnections were good; the Archdeacon\xe2\x80\x99s name was greatly respected; she\r\nhad a handsome and well-regulated establishment, and this, together with\r\ntalents which, having no family, she had cultivated more than most women\r\nhave time to do, made her a person of considerable distinction at St.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s. She was, in fact, the leading lady of the place--the manager\r\nof the book-club, in the chair at all the charitable committees, and the\r\nprincipal person in society, giving literary parties, with a degree of\r\nexclusiveness that made admission to them a privilege.\r\n\r\nShe was a very fine woman, handsomer at two-and-thirty than in her early\r\nbloom; her height little less than that of her tall brother, and her\r\nmanner and air had something very distinguished. The first time Guy saw\r\nher, he was strongly reminded both of Philip and of Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nbut not pleasingly. She seemed to be her aunt, without the softness and\r\nmotherly affection, coupled with the touch of naivete that gave Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone her freshness, and loveableness; and her likeness to her\r\nbrother included that decided, self-reliant air, which became him well\r\nenough, but which did not sit as appropriately on a woman.\r\n\r\nGuy soon discovered another resemblance--for the old, unaccountable\r\nimpatience of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s conversation, and relief in escaping from it,\r\nhaunted him before he had been a quarter of an hour in Mrs. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrawing-room. She asked after the Hollywell party; she had not seen her\r\ncousins since her marriage, and happily for his feelings, passed over\r\nLaura and Amy as if they were nonentities; but they were all too near\r\nhis heart for him to be able with patience to hear \xe2\x80\x98poor Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntemper regretted, and still less the half-sarcastic, half-compassionate\r\ntone in which she implied that her aunt spoilt him dreadfully, and\r\nshowed how cheap she hold both Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Guy could not have kept down his irritation; but now he\r\nwas master of himself sufficiently to give a calm, courteous reply,\r\nso conveying his own respect for them, that Mrs. Henley was almost\r\ndisconcerted.\r\n\r\nStylehurst had great interest for Guy, both for the sake of Archdeacon\r\nMorville\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, and as the home which Philip regarded with\r\naffection, that seemed the one softening touch in his character. So Guy\r\nvisited the handsome church, studied the grave-yard, and gathered the\r\ntraditions of the place from the old sexton\xe2\x80\x99s wife, who rejoiced in\r\nfinding an auditor for her long stories of the good Archdeacon, Miss\r\nFanny, and Mr. Philip. She shook her head, saying times were changed,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98Miss Morville that was, never came neist the place.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe squire, Colonel Harewood, was an old friend of his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand therefore was to be called on. He had never been wise, and had been\r\ndissipated chiefly from vacancy of mind; he was now growing old, and\r\nled a quieter life, and though Guy did not find him a very entertaining\r\ncompanion, he accepted, his civilities, readily, for his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake. When his sons came home, Guy recognized in them the description\r\nof men he was wont to shun at Oxford, as much from distaste as from\r\nprinciple; but though he did not absolutely avoid them, he saw little\r\nof them, being very busy, and having pleasant companions in his fellow\r\npupils. It was a very merry party at South Moor, and Guy\xe2\x80\x99s high spirits\r\nmade him the life of everything.\r\n\r\nThe first time Mr. Wellwood went to call on his cousins at St.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s, the daughters of that officer who had fallen by the hand\r\nof old Sir Guy, he began repeating, for the twentieth time, what an\r\nexcellent fellow Morville was; then said he should not have troubled\r\nthem with any of his pupils, but Morville would esteem their receiving\r\nhim as an act of forgiveness, and besides, he wished them to know\r\none whom he valued so highly. Guy thus found himself admitted into an\r\nentirely new region. There were two sisters, together in everything.\r\nJane, the younger, was a kind-hearted, commonplace person, who would\r\nnever have looked beyond the ordinary range of duties and charities; but\r\nElizabeth was one of those who rise up, from time to time, as burning\r\nand shining lights. It was not spending a quiet, easy life, making her\r\ncharities secondary to her comforts, but devoting time, strength, and\r\ngoods; not merely giving away what she could spare, but actually sharing\r\nall with the poor, reserving nothing for the future. She not only taught\r\nthe young, and visited the distressed, but she gathered orphans into\r\nher house, and nursed the sick day and night. Neither the means nor the\r\nstrength of the two sisters could ever have been supposed equal to what\r\nthey were known to have achieved. It seemed as if the power grew with\r\nthe occasion, and as if they had some help which could not fail them.\r\nGuy venerated them more and more, and many a long letter about them\r\nwas written to Mrs. Edmonstone for Amy to read. There is certainly a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tyrannous hate\xe2\x80\x99 in the world for unusual goodness, which is a rebuke to\r\nit, and there was a strong party against the sisters. At the head of it\r\nwas Mrs. Henley, who had originally been displeased at their preferring\r\nthe direction of the clergyman to that of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 committee, though\r\nthe secret cause of her dislike was, perhaps, that Elizabeth Wellwood\r\nwas just what Margaret Morville might have been. So she blamed them,\r\nnot, indeed for their charity, but for slight peculiarities which might\r\nwell have been lost in the brightness of the works of mercy. She spoke\r\nas with her father\xe2\x80\x99s authority, though, if she had been differently\r\ndisposed, she might have remembered that his system and principles were\r\nthe same as theirs, and that, had he been alive, he would probably have\r\nfully approved of their proceedings. Archdeacon Morville\xe2\x80\x99s name was of\r\ngreat weight, and justified many persons, in their own opinion, in\r\nthe opposition made to Miss Wellwood, impeding her usefulness, and\r\nsubjecting her to endless petty calumnies.\r\n\r\nThese made Guy very angry. He knew enough of the Archdeacon through Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, and the opinions held by Philip, to think his daughter was\r\nascribing to him what he had never held but, be that as it might, Guy\r\ncould not bear to hear good evil spoken of, and his indignation was\r\nstirred as he heard these spiteful reports uttered by people who sat\r\nat home at ease, against one whose daily life was only too exalted\r\nfor their imitation. His brow contracted, his eye kindled, his lip was\r\nbitten, and now and then, when he trusted himself to reply, it was with\r\na keen, sharp power of rebuke that made people look round, astonished\r\nto hear such forcible words from one so young. Mrs. Henley was afraid of\r\nhim, without knowing it; she thought she was sparing the Morville temper\r\nwhen she avoided the subject, but as she stood in awe of no one else,\r\nexcept her brother, she disliked him accordingly.\r\n\r\nOne evening Guy had been dining at Dr. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s, and was setting out,\r\nenjoying his escape from Mrs. Henley and her friends, and rejoicing in\r\nthe prospect of a five miles\xe2\x80\x99 walk over the hills by moonlight. He had\r\nonly gone the length of two streets, when he saw a dark figure at a\r\nlittle distance from him, and a voice which he had little expected to\r\nhear, called out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy himself! No one else could whistle that Swedish air so\r\ncorrectly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I did not know that you were here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon laughed, said something about a fortunate rencontre, and began\r\nan account about a concert somewhere or other, mixed up with something\r\nabout his wife and child, all so rambling and confused, that Guy,\r\nbeginning to suspect he had been drinking, was only anxious to get rid\r\nof him, asked where he lodged, and talked of coming to see him in the\r\nmorning. He soon found, however, that this had not been the case, at\r\nleast not to any great extent. Dixon was only nervous and excited,\r\neither about something he had done, or some request he had to make, and\r\nhe went on walking by his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s side, talking in a strange, desultory\r\nway of open, generous-hearted fellows overlooking a little indiscretion,\r\nand of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s riches, which he seemed to think inexhaustible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If there is anything that you want me to do for you, tell me plainly\r\nwhat it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, at last.\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon began to overwhelm him with thanks, but he cut them short. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\npromise nothing. Let me hear what you want, and I can judge whether I\r\ncan do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSebastian broke out into exclamations at the words \xe2\x80\x98if I can,\xe2\x80\x99 as if he\r\nthought everything in the power of the heir of Redclyffe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have I not told you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98that for the present I have very\r\nlittle command of money? Hush! no more of that,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, sternly,\r\ncutting off an imprecation which his uncle was commencing on those who\r\nkept him so short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you are content to bear it? Did you never hear of ways and means?\r\nIf you were to say but one word of borrowing, they would go down on\r\ntheir knees to you, and offer you every farthing you have to keep you in\r\ntheir own hands.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am quite satisfied,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The greater fool are you!\xe2\x80\x99 was on Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s lips, but he did not\r\nutter it, because he wanted to propitiate him; and after some more\r\ncircumlocution, Guy succeeded in discovering that he had been gambling,\r\nand had lost an amount which, unless he could obtain immediate\r\nassistance, would become known, and lead to the loss of his character\r\nand situation. Guy stood and considered. He had an impulse, but he did\r\nnot think it a safe one, and resolved to give himself time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not say that I cannot help you,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98but I must have\r\ntime to consider.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Time! would you see me ruined while you are considering?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose this must be paid immediately. Where do you lodge?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon told him the street and number.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall hear from me to-morrow morning. I cannot trust my present\r\nthoughts. Good night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Dixon would fain have guessed whether the present thoughts were\r\nfavourable, but all his hope in his extremity was in his nephew; it\r\nmight be fatal to push him too far, and, with a certain trust in\r\nhis good-nature, Sebastian allowed him to walk away without further\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\nGuy knew his own impetuous nature too well to venture to act on impulse\r\nin a doubtful case. He had now first to consider what he was able to do,\r\nand secondly what he would do; and this was not as clear to his mind as\r\nin the earlier days of his acquaintance with his uncle.\r\n\r\nTheir intercourse had never been on a comfortable footing. It would\r\nperhaps have been better if Philip\xe2\x80\x99s advice had been followed, and no\r\nconnection kept up. Guy had once begged for some definite rule, since\r\nthere was always vexation when he was known to have been with his uncle,\r\nand yet Mr. Edmonstone would never absolutely say he ought not to see\r\nhim. As long as his guardian permitted it, or rather winked at it, Guy\r\ndid not think it necessary to attend to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s marked disapproval.\r\nPart of it was well founded, but part was dislike to all that might\r\nbe considered as vulgar, and part was absolute injustice to Sebastian\r\nDixon, there was everything that could offend in his line of argument,\r\nand in the very circumstance of his interfering; and Guy had a continual\r\nstruggle, in which he was not always successful, to avoid showing the\r\naffront he had taken, and to reason down his subsequent indignation. The\r\never-recurring irritation which Philip\xe2\x80\x99s conversation was apt to cause\r\nhim, made him avoid it as far as he could, and retreat in haste from the\r\nsubjects on which they were most apt to disagree, and so his manner had\r\nassumed an air of reserve, and almost of distrust, with his cousin, that\r\nwas very unlike its usual winning openness.\r\n\r\nThis had been one unfortunate effect of his intercourse with his uncle,\r\nand another was a certain vague, dissatisfied feeling which his silence,\r\nand Philip\xe2\x80\x99s insinuations respecting the days he spent in London,\r\nleft on Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and which gained strength from their\r\nrecurrence. The days were, indeed, not many; it was only that in coming\r\nfrom and going to Oxford, he slept a night at an hotel in London (for\r\nhis uncle never would take him to his lodgings, never even would tell\r\nhim where they were, but always gave his address at the place of his\r\nengagement), was conducted by him to some concert in the evening, and\r\nhad him to breakfast in the morning. He could not think there was any\r\nharm in this; he explained all he had done to Mr. Edmonstone the first\r\ntime, but nothing was gained by it: his visits to London continued to be\r\ntreated as something to be excused or overlooked--as something not quite\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nHe would almost have been ready to discontinue them, but that he saw\r\nthat his uncle regarded him with affection, and he could not bear the\r\nthought of giving up a poor relation for the sake of the opinion of\r\nhis rich friends. These meetings were the one pure pleasure to which\r\nSebastian looked, recalling to him the happier days of his youth, and of\r\nhis friendship with Guy\xe2\x80\x99s father; and when Guy perceived how he valued\r\nthem, it would have seemed a piece of cruel neglect to gratify himself\r\nby giving the time to Hollywell.\r\n\r\nEarly in the course of their acquaintance, the importunity of a creditor\r\nrevealed that, in spite of his handsome salary, Sebastian Dixon was\r\noften in considerable distress for money. In process of time, Guy\r\ndiscovered that at the time his uncle had been supporting his sister\r\nand her husband in all the luxury he thought befitted their rank, he had\r\ncontracted considerable debts, and he had only been able to return to\r\nEngland on condition of paying so much a-year to his creditors. This\r\nleft him very little on which to maintain his family, but still his\r\npride made him bent on concealing his difficulties, and it was not\r\nwithout a struggle that he would at first consent to receive assistance\r\nfrom his nephew.\r\n\r\nGuy resolved that these debts, which he considered as in fact his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s own, should be paid as soon as he had the command of his\r\nproperty; but, in the meantime, he thought himself bound to send his\r\nuncle all the help in his power, and when once the effort of accepting\r\nit at all was over, Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s expectations extended far beyond his power.\r\nHis allowance was not large, and the constant requests for a few pounds\r\nto meet some pressing occasion were more than he could well meet. They\r\nkept him actually a great deal poorer than men without a tenth part of\r\nhis fortune, and at the end of the term he would look back with surprise\r\nat having been able to pay his way; but still he contrived neither to\r\nexceed his allowance, nor to get into debt. This was, indeed, only done\r\nby a rigid self-denial of little luxuries such as most young men look\r\non nearly as necessaries; but he had never been brought up to think\r\nself-indulgence a consequence of riches, he did not care what was said\r\nof him, he had no expensive tastes, for he did not seek after society,\r\nso that he was not ill-prepared for such a course, and only thought of\r\nit as an assistance in abstaining from the time-wasting that might have\r\ntempted him if he had had plenty of money to spend.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that concerned him was a growing doubt lest he might be\r\nfeeding extravagance instead of doing good; and the more he disliked\r\nhimself for the suspicion, the more it would return. There was no doubt\r\nmuch distress, the children were sickly; several of them died; the\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s bills, and other expenses, pressed heavily, and Guy blamed\r\nhimself for having doubted. Yet, again, he could not conceal from\r\nhimself traces that his uncle was careless and imprudent. He had once,\r\nindeed, in a violent fit of self-reproach, confessed as much, allowed\r\nthat what ought to have been spent in the maintenance of his family, had\r\ngone in gambling, but immediately after, he had been seized with a fit\r\nof terror, and implored Guy to guard the secret, since, if once it\r\ncame to the knowledge of his creditors, it would be all over with him.\r\nConcealment of his present difficulties was therefore no less necessary\r\nthan assistance in paying the sum he owed. Indeed, as far as Guy was\r\nable to understand his confused statement, what he wanted was at once\r\nto pay a part of his debt, before he could go on to a place where he was\r\nengaged to perform, and where he would earn enough to make up the rest.\r\n\r\nGuy had intended to have sent for Deloraine, but had since given up the\r\nidea, in order to be able to help forward some plans of Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand resigning this project would enable him to place thirty pounds at\r\nhis uncle\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, leaving him just enough to pay his expenses at\r\nSouth Moor, and carry him back to Hollywell. It was sorely against his\r\ninclination that, instead of helping a charity, his savings should go\r\nto pay gaming debts, and his five-miles walk was spent in self-debate on\r\nthe right and wrong of the matter, and questions what should be done\r\nfor the future--for he was beginning to awaken to the sense of his\r\nresponsibility, and feared lest he might be encouraging vice.\r\n\r\nVery early next morning Guy put his head into his tutor\xe2\x80\x99s room,\r\nannounced that he must walk into St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s on business, but should\r\nbe back by eleven at the latest, ran down-stairs, called Bustle, and\r\nmade interest with the farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife for a hunch of dry bread and a cup\r\nof new milk.\r\n\r\nThen rejoicing that he had made up his mind, though not light-hearted\r\nenough to whistle, he walked across the moorland, through the white\r\nmorning mist, curling on the sides of the hills in fantastic forms, and\r\nnow and then catching his lengthened shadow, so as to make him smile by\r\nreminding him of the spectre of the Brocken.\r\n\r\nNot without difficulty, he found a back street, and a little shop, where\r\na slovenly maid was sweeping the steps, and the shutters were not yet\r\ntaken down. He asked if Mr. Dixon lodged there. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 the woman said,\r\nstaring in amazement that such a gentleman could be there at that time\r\nin the morning, asking for Mr. Dixon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir but he is not up yet. He was very late last night. Did you\r\nwant to speak to him? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Mrs. Dixon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mrs. Dixon here? Then tell her Sir Guy Morville would be glad to\r\nspeak to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe maid curtseyed, hurried off, and returned with a message from Mrs.\r\nDixon to desire he would walk in. She conducted him through a dark\r\npassage, and up a still darker stair, into a dingy little parlour, with\r\na carpet of red and green stripes, a horsehair sofa, a grate covered\r\nwith cut paper, and a general perfume of brandy and cigars. There were\r\nsome preparations for breakfast, but no one was in the room but a little\r\ngirl, about seven years old, dressed in shabby-genteel mourning.\r\n\r\nShe was pale and sickly-looking, but her eyes were of a lovely deep\r\nblue, with a very sweet expression, and a profusion of thick flaxen\r\ncurls hung round her neck and shoulders. She said in a soft, little, shy\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma says she will be here directly, if you will excuse her a moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving made this formal speech, the little thing was creeping off on\r\ntip-toe, so as to escape before the maid shut the door, but Guy held out\r\nhis hand, sat down so as to be on a level with her, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go, my little maid. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come and speak to your cousin Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nChildren never failed to be attracted, whether by the winning beauty of\r\nhis smile, or the sweetness of the voice in which he spoke to anything\r\nsmall or weak, and the little girl willingly came up to him, and put her\r\nhand into his. He stroked her thick, silky curls, and asked her name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Marianne,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.\r\n\r\nIt was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name, and this little creature had more resemblance\r\nto his tenderly-cherished vision of his young mother than any\r\ndescription Dixon could have given. He drew her closer to him, took the\r\nother small, cold hand, and asked her how she liked St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! much better than London. There are flowers!\xe2\x80\x99 and she proudly\r\nexhibited a cup holding some ragged robins, dead nettles, and other\r\ncommon flowers which a country child would have held cheap. He admired\r\nand gained more of her confidence, so that she had begun to chatter away\r\nquite freely about \xe2\x80\x98the high, high hills that reached up to the sky, and\r\nthe pretty stones,\xe2\x80\x99 till the door opened, and Mrs. Dixon and Bustle made\r\ntheir entrance.\r\n\r\nMarianne was so much afraid of the dog, Guy so eager to console, and her\r\nmother to scold her, and protest that it should not be turned out, that\r\nthere was nothing but confusion, until Guy had shown her that Bustle was\r\nno dangerous wild beast, induced her to accept his offered paw, and lay\r\na timid finger on his smooth, black head, after which the transition was\r\nshort to dog and child sitting lovingly together on the floor, Marianne\r\nstroking his ears, and admiring him with a sort of silent ecstasy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dixon was a great, coarse, vulgar woman, and Guy perceived why his\r\nuncle had been so averse to taking him to his home, and how he must have\r\nfelt the contrast between such a wife and his beautiful sister. She\r\nhad a sort of broad sense, and absence of pretension, but her manner of\r\ntalking was by no means pleasant, as she querulously accused her husband\r\nof being the cause of all their misfortunes, not even restrained by the\r\npresence of her child from entering into a full account of his offences.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dixon said she should not say a word, she should not care if it was\r\nnot for the child, but she could not see her wronged by her own father,\r\nand not complain; poor little dear! she was the last, and she supposed\r\nshe should not keep her long.\r\n\r\nIt then appeared that on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s obtaining an engagement for a\r\nseries of concerts at the chief county town, Mrs. Dixon had insisted\r\non coming with him to St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s in the hope that country air might\r\nbenefit Marianne, who, in a confined lodging in London, was pining and\r\ndwindling as her brothers and sisters had done before her. Sebastian,\r\nwho liked to escape from his wife\xe2\x80\x99s grumbling and rigid supervision, and\r\nlooked forward to amusement in his own way at the races, had grudgingly\r\nallowed her to come, and, as she described it, had been reluctant to go\r\nto even so slight an expense in the hope of saving his child\xe2\x80\x99s life. She\r\nhad watched him as closely as she could; but he had made his escape, and\r\nthe consequences Guy already knew.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have made it worse, it was finding that after parting\r\nlast night, he had returned, tried to retrieve his luck, had involved\r\nhimself further, had been drinking more; and at the very hour when his\r\nnephew was getting up to see what could be done for him, had come\r\nhome in a state, which made it by no means likely that he would be\r\npresentable, if his wife called him, as she offered to do.\r\n\r\nGuy much preferred arranging with her what was to be done on the present\r\nemergency. She was disappointed at finding thirty pounds was all the\r\nhelp he could give; but she was an energetic woman, full of resources,\r\nand saw her way, with this assistance, through the present difficulty.\r\nThe great point was to keep the gambling propensities out of sight of\r\nthe creditors; and as long as this was done, she had hope. Dixon would\r\ngo the next morning to the town where the musical meeting was to be\r\nheld, and there he would be with his employers, where he had a character\r\nto preserve, so that she was in no fear of another outbreak.\r\n\r\nIt ended, therefore, in his leaving with her Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s draft,\r\nsecuring its destination by endorsing it to the person who was to\r\nreceive it; and wishing her good morning, after a few more kind words to\r\nlittle Marianne, who had sat playing with Bustle all the time, sidling\r\ncontinually nearer and nearer to her new cousin, her eyes bent down, and\r\nno expression on her face which could enable him to guess how far she\r\nlistened to or comprehended the conversation so unfit for her ear. When\r\nhe rose to go, and stooped to kiss her, she looked wistfully in his\r\nface, and held up a small sparkling bit of spar, the most precious of\r\nall her hoards, gleaned from the roadsides of St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, child, do you want to give it to Sir Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\ndoes not want such trumpery, my dear, though you make such a work with\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you mean to give it to me, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, as the child hung\r\nher head, and, crimsoned with blushes, could scarcely whisper her timid\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe praised it, and let her put it in his waistcoat pocket, and promised\r\nhe would always keep it; and kissed her again, and left her a happy\r\nchild, confident in his promise of always keeping it, though her mother\r\naugured that he would throw it over the next hedge.\r\n\r\nHe was at South Moor by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, in time for his morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness, and made up for the troubles of the last few hours by a long\r\ntalk with Mr. Wellwood in the afternoon, while the other two pupils were\r\ngone to the races, for which he was not inclined, after his two ten-mile\r\nwalks.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was chiefly on Church prospects in general, and in\r\nparticular on Miss Wellwood and her plans; how they had by degrees\r\nenlarged and developed as the sin, and misery, and ignorance around\r\nhad forced themselves more plainly on her notice, and her means had\r\nincreased and grown under her hand in the very distribution. Other\r\nschemes were dawning on her mind, of which the foremost was the\r\nfoundation of a sort of school and hospital united, under the charge\r\nof herself, her sister, and several other ladies, who were desirous of\r\njoining her, as a sisterhood. But at present it was hoping against hope,\r\nfor there were no funds with which to make a commencement. All this was\r\ntold at unawares, drawn forth by different questions and remarks, till\r\nGuy inquired how much it would take to give them a start?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is impossible to say. Anything, I suppose, between one thousand\r\nand twenty. But, by the bye, this design of Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s is an absolute\r\nsecret. If you had not almost guessed it, I should never have said one\r\nword to you about it. You are a particularly dangerous man, with your\r\nconnection with Mrs. Henley. You must take special good care nothing of\r\nit reaches her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s first impression was, that he was the last person to mention it\r\nto Mrs. Henley; but when he remembered how often her brother was at\r\nHollywell, he perceived that there might be a train for carrying the\r\nreport back again to her, and recognized the absolute necessity of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing at the time, but a bright scheme came into his head,\r\nresulting in the request for a thousand pounds, which caused so much\r\nastonishment. He thought himself rather shabby to have named no more,\r\nand was afraid it was an offering that cost him nothing; but he much\r\nenjoyed devising beforehand the letter with which he would place the\r\nmoney at the disposal of Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16\r\n\r\n     Yet burns the sun on high beyond the cloud;\r\n     Each in his southern cave,\r\n     The warm winds linger, but to be allowed\r\n     One breathing o\xe2\x80\x99er the wave,\r\n     One flight across the unquiet sky;\r\n     Swift as a vane may turn on high,\r\n     The smile of heaven comes on.\r\n     So waits the Lord behind the veil,\r\n     His light on frenzied cheek, or pale,\r\n     To shed when the dark hour is gone.\r\n                              --LYRA INNOCENTIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon on which Guy expected an answer from Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nhe walked with his fellow pupil, Harry Graham, to see if there were any\r\nletters from him at Dr. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThe servant said Mrs. Henley was at home, and asked them to come in and\r\ntake their letters. These were lying on a marble table, in the hall; and\r\nwhile the man looked in the drawing-room for his mistress, and sent one\r\nof the maids up-stairs in quest of her, Guy hastily took up one, bearing\r\nhis address, in the well-known hand of Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\nYoung Graham, who had taken up a newspaper, was startled by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s loud,\r\nsudden exclamation,--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! What on earth does this mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd looking up, saw his face of a burning, glowing red, the features\r\nalmost convulsed, the large veins in the forehead and temples swollen\r\nwith the blood that rushed through them, and if ever his eyes flashed\r\nwith the dark lightning of Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s, it was then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Morville! What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Intolerable!--insulting! Me? What does he mean?\xe2\x80\x99 continued Guy, his\r\npassion kindling more and more. \xe2\x80\x98Proofs? I should like to see them!\r\nThe man is crazy! I to confess! Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 as he came towards the end, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsee it,--I see it. It is Philip, is it, that I have to thank. Meddling\r\ncoxcomb! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him repent it,\xe2\x80\x99 added he, with a grim fierceness of\r\ndetermination. Slandering me to them! And that,\xe2\x80\x99--looking at the words\r\nwith regard to Amy,--\xe2\x80\x98that passes all. He shall see what it is to insult\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it? Your guardian out of humour?\xe2\x80\x99 asked his companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My guardian is a mere weak fool. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame him,--he can\xe2\x80\x99t help it;\r\nbut to see him made a tool of! He twists him round his finger, abuses\r\nhis weakness to insult--to accuse. But he shall give me an account!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s voice had grown lower and more husky; but though the sound sunk,\r\nthe force of passion rather increased than diminished; it was like the\r\nlow distant sweep of the tempest as it whirls away, preparing to return\r\nwith yet more tremendous might. His colour, too, had faded to paleness,\r\nbut the veins were still swollen, purple, and throbbing, and there was\r\na stillness about him that made his wrath more than fierce, intense,\r\nalmost appalling.\r\n\r\nHarry Graham was dumb with astonishment; but while Guy spoke, Mrs.\r\nHenley had come down, and was standing before them, beginning a\r\ngreeting. The blood rushed back into Guy\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and, controlling his\r\nvoice with powerful effort, he said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had an insulting--an unpleasant letter,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, catching\r\nhimself up. \xe2\x80\x98You must excuse me;\xe2\x80\x99 and he was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has happened?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mrs. Henley, though, from her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, as well as from her observations during a long and purposely\r\nslow progress, along a railed gallery overhanging the hall, and down a\r\nwinding staircase, she knew pretty well the whole history of his anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said young Graham. \xe2\x80\x98Some absurd, person interfering\r\nbetween him and his guardian. I should be sorry to be him to fall in his\r\nway just now. It must be something properly bad. I never saw a man in\r\nsuch a rage. I think I had better go after him, and see what he has done\r\nwith himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Henley, detaining him, \xe2\x80\x98that his guardian\r\ncould have been finding fault with him with reason?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who? Morville? His guardian must have a sharp eye for picking holes, if\r\nhe can find any in Morville. Not a steadier fellow going,--only too much\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mrs. Henley, \xe2\x80\x98these young men always hang together;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nshe let him escape without further question. But, when he emerged from\r\nthe house, Guy was already out of sight, and he could not succeed in\r\nfinding him.\r\n\r\nGuy had burst out of the house, feeling as if nothing could relieve\r\nhim but free air and rapid motion; and on he hurried, fast, faster,\r\nconscious alone of the wild, furious tumult of rage and indignation\r\nagainst the maligner of his innocence, who was knowingly ruining him\r\nwith all that was dearest to him, insulting him by reproaches on his\r\nbreaking a most sacred, unblemished word, and, what Guy felt scarcely\r\nless keenly, forcing kind-hearted Mr. Edmonstone into a persecution so\r\nforeign to his nature. The agony of suffering such an accusation, and\r\nfrom such a quarter,--the violent storm of indignation and pride,--wild,\r\nundefined ideas of a heavy reckoning,--above all, the dreary thought of\r\nAmy denied to him for ever,--all these swept over him, and swayed him\r\nby turns, with the dreadful intensity belonging to a nature formed for\r\nviolent passions, which had broken down, in the sudden shock, all the\r\nbarriers imposed on them by a long course of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nOn he rushed, reckless whither he went, or what he did, driven forward\r\nby the wild impulse of passion, far over moor and hill, up and down,\r\ntill at last, exhausted at once by the tumult within, and by the\r\nviolent bodily exertion, a stillness--a suspension of thought and\r\nsensation--ensued; and when this passed, he found himself seated on\r\na rock which crowned the summit of one of the hills, his handkerchief\r\nloosened, his waistcoat open, his hat thrown off, his temples burning\r\nand throbbing with a feeling of distraction, and the agitated beatings\r\nof his heart almost stifling his panting breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x98a heavy account shall he pay me for this\r\ncrowning stroke of a long course of slander and ill-will! Have I not\r\nseen it? Has not he hated me from the first, misconstrued every word and\r\ndeed, though I have tried, striven earnestly, to be his friend,--borne,\r\nas not another soul would have done, with his impertinent interference\r\nand intolerable patronizing airs! But he has seen the last of it!\r\nanything but this might be forgiven; but sowing dissension between me\r\nand the Edmonstones--maligning me there. Never! Knowing, too, as he\r\nseems to do, how I stand, it is the very ecstasy of malice! Ay! this\r\nvery night it shall be exposed, and he shall be taught to beware--made\r\nto know with whom he has to deal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy uttered this last with teeth clenched, in an excess of deep,\r\nvengeful ire. Never had Morville of the whole line felt more deadly\r\nfierceness than held sway over him, as he contemplated his revenge,\r\nlooked forward with a dire complacency to the punishment he would wreak,\r\nnot for this offence alone, but for a long course of enmity. He sat,\r\nabsorbed in the plan of vengeance, perfectly still, for his physical\r\nexhaustion was complete; but as the pulsations of his heart grew\r\nless wild, his purpose became sterner and more fixed. He devised its\r\nexecution, planned his sudden journey, saw himself bursting on Philip\r\nearly next morning, summoning him to answer for his falsehoods. The\r\nimpulse to action seemed to restore his power over his senses. He looked\r\nround, to see where he was, raising his head from his hands.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting opposite to him, in a flood of gold,--a ruddy ball,\r\nsurrounded with its pomp of clouds, on the dazzling sweep of horizon.\r\nThat sight recalled him not only to himself, but to his true and better\r\nself; the good angel so close to him for the twenty years of his life,\r\nhad been driven aloof but for a moment, and now, either that, or a still\r\nhigher and holier power, made the setting sun bring to his mind, almost\r\nto his ear, the words,--\r\n\r\n          Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,\r\n          Neither give place to the devil.\r\n\r\nGuy had what some would call a vivid imagination, others a lively faith.\r\nHe shuddered, then, his elbows on his knees, and his hands clasped over\r\nhis brow, he sat, bending forward, with his eyes closed, wrought up in a\r\nfearful struggle; while it was to him as if he saw the hereditary demon\r\nof the Morvilles watching by his side, to take full possession of him\r\nas a rightful prey, unless the battle was fought and won before that red\r\norb had passed out of sight. Yes, the besetting fiend of his family--the\r\nspirit of defiance and resentment--that was driving him, even now, while\r\nrealizing its presence, to disregard all thoughts save of the revenge\r\nfor which he could barter everything--every hope once precious to him.\r\n\r\nIt was horror at such wickedness that first checked him, and brought him\r\nback to the combat. His was not a temper that was satisfied with half\r\nmeasures. He locked his hands more rigidly together, vowing to compel\r\nhimself, ere he left the spot, to forgive his enemy--forgive him\r\ncandidly--forgive him, so as never again to have to say, \xe2\x80\x98I forgive\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x99 He did not try to think, for reflection only lashed up his sense\r\nof the wrong: but, as if there was power in the words alone, he forced\r\nhis lips to repeat,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nColdly and hardly were they spoken at first; again he pronounced them,\r\nagain, again,--each time the tone was softer, each time they came more\r\nfrom the heart. At last the remembrance of greater wrongs, and worse\r\nrevilings came upon him, his eyes filled with tears, the most subduing\r\nand healing of all thoughts--that of the great Example--became present\r\nto him; the foe was driven back.\r\n\r\nStill he kept his hands over his face. The tempter was not yet defeated\r\nwithout hope. It was not enough to give up his first intention (no great\r\nsacrifice, as he perceived, now that he had time to think how Philip\r\nwould be certain to treat a challenge), it was not enough to wish no ill\r\nto his cousin, to intend no evil measure, he must pardon from the bottom\r\nof his heart, regard him candidly, and not magnify his injuries.\r\n\r\nHe sat long, in deep thought, his head bent down, and his countenance\r\nstern with inward conflict. It was the hardest part of the whole battle,\r\nfor the Morville disposition was as vindictive as passionate; but, at\r\nlast, he recovered clearness of vision. His request might well appear\r\nunreasonable, and possibly excite suspicion, and, for the rest, it was\r\ndoing a man of honour, like Philip, flagrant injustice to suspect him of\r\noriginating slanders. He was, of course, under a mistake, had acted, not\r\nperhaps kindly, but as he thought, rightly and judiciously, in making\r\nhis suspicions known. If he had caused his uncle to write provokingly,\r\nevery one knew that was his way, he might very properly wish, under his\r\nbelief, to save Amabel; and though the manner might have been otherwise,\r\nthe proceeding itself admitted complete justification. Indeed, when Guy\r\nrecollected the frenzy of his rage, and his own murderous impulse, he\r\nwas shocked to think that he had ever sought the love of that pure\r\nand gentle creature, as if it had been a cruel and profane linking of\r\ninnocence to evil. He was appalled at the power of his fury, he had\r\nnot known he was capable of it, for his boyish passion, even when\r\nunrestrained, had never equalled this, in all the strength of early\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\nHe looked up, and saw that the last remnant of the sun\xe2\x80\x99s disk was just\r\ndisappearing beneath the horizon. The victory was won!\r\n\r\nBut Guy\xe2\x80\x99s feeling was not the rejoicing of the conquest, it was more the\r\nrelief which is felt by a little child, weary of its fit of naughtiness,\r\nwhen its tearful face is raised, mournful yet happy, in having won true\r\nrepentance, and it says, \xe2\x80\x98I _am_ sorry now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rose, looked at his watch, wondered to find it so late; gazed round,\r\nand considered his bearings, perceiving, with a sense of shame, how far\r\nhe had wandered; then retraced his steps slowly and wearily, and did not\r\nreach South Moor till long after dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17\r\n\r\n     My blood hath been too cold and temperate,\r\n     Unapt to stir at these indignities;\r\n     But you have found me.\r\n                               --KING HENRY IV\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip, according to promise, appeared at Hollywell, and a volume of\r\nawful justice seemed written on his brow. Charles, though ignorant of\r\nits cause, perceived this at a glance, and greeted him thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enter Don Philip II, the Duke of Alva, alguazils, corregidors, and\r\nexecutioners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is anything the matter, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; a question which took him\r\nby surprise, as he could not believe her in ignorance. He was sorry for\r\nher, and answered gravely,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing is amiss with me, thank you, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe knew he meant that he would tell no more, and would have thought no\r\nmore about it, but that she saw her mother was very uneasy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ask whether there were any letters at the post?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy is using us shamefully--practising self-denial on us, I suppose. Is\r\nthere no letter from him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, where is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is to your father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, with a disappointed air. \xe2\x80\x98Are you sure? Depend on\r\nit, you overlooked my M. He has owed me a letter this fortnight. Let me\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is for my uncle,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Philip, as if to put an end to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he has been so stupid as to forget my second name. Come, give it\r\nme. I shall have it sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I assure you, Charles, it is not for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would not any one suppose he had been reading it?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you know Mary Ross was gone to stay with her brother John?\xe2\x80\x99 broke\r\nin Mrs. Edmonstone, in a nervous, hurried manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No is she?\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; his wife is ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe universal feeling was that something was amiss, and mamma was in the\r\nsecret. Amy looked wistfully at her, but Mrs. Edmonstone only gazed\r\nat the window, and so they continued for some minutes, while an\r\nuninteresting exchange of question and answer was kept up between her\r\nand her nephew until at length the dressing-bell rang, and cleared the\r\nroom. Mrs. Edmonstone lingered till her son and daughters were gone, and\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard from St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, as if he was as little inclined to be communicative\r\nto her as to his cousins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Guy, or from Margaret?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Margaret.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you say there is a letter from him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, for my uncle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does she say nothing more satisfactory?\xe2\x80\x99 asked his aunt, her anxiety\r\ntortured by his composure. \xe2\x80\x98Has she learnt no more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing more of his proceedings. I see Amy knows nothing of the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; her papa thought there was no need to distress her till we had seen\r\nwhether he could explain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone did not choose to discuss her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s affairs with\r\nhim, and she turned the conversation to ask if Margaret said much of\r\nGuy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She writes to tell the spirit in which he received my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\nIt is only the Morville temper, again, and, of course, whatever you may\r\nthink of that on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s account, I should never regard it, as concerns\r\nmyself, as other than his misfortune. I hope he may be able to explain\r\nthe rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! there comes your uncle!\xe2\x80\x99 and Mr. Edmonstone entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Philip? Brought better news, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is a letter to speak for itself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? From Guy? Give it me. What does he say? Let me see. Here, mamma,\r\nread it; your eyes are best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR MR. EDMONSTONE,--Your letter surprised and grieved me very\r\nmuch. I cannot guess what proofs Philip may think he has, of what\r\nI never did, and, therefore, I cannot refute them otherwise than by\r\ndeclaring that I never gamed in my life. Tell me what they are, and I\r\nwill answer them. As to a full confession, I could of course tell you\r\nof much in which I have done wrongly, though not in the way which he\r\nsupposes. On that head, I have nothing to confess. I am sorry I am\r\nprevented from satisfying you about the \xc2\xa31OOO, but I am bound in honour\r\nnot to mention the purpose for which I wanted it. I am sure you could\r\nnever believe I could have said what I did to Mrs. Edmonstone if I had\r\nbegun on a course which I detest from the bottom of my heart. Thank you\r\nvery much for the kindness of the latter part of your letter. I do not\r\nknow how I could have borne it, if it had ended as it began. I hope you\r\nwill soon send me these proofs of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s. Ever your affectionate, \xe2\x80\x98G.\r\nM.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a little surprised was Philip to find that he was known to be Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccuser; but the conclusion revealed that his style had betrayed him,\r\nand that Mr. Edmonstone had finished with some mention of him, and\r\nhe resolved that henceforth he would never leave a letter of his own\r\ndictation till he had seen it signed and sealed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Edmonstone, joyfully beating his own hand with his\r\nglove, \xe2\x80\x98that is all right. I knew it would be so. He can\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nguess what we are at. I am glad we did not tease poor little Amy. Eh,\r\nmamma?--eh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 the last eh being uttered much more doubtfully, and\r\nless triumphantly than the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder you think it right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What more would you have?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh? Oh, ay, he says he can\xe2\x80\x99t tell--bound in honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is easy to write off-hand, and say I cannot satisfy you, I am\r\nbound in honour; but that is not what most persons would think a full\r\njustification, especially considering the terms on which you stand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, yes, he might have said more. It would have been safe enough with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is his usual course of mystery, reserve, and defiance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, turning away, \xe2\x80\x98that it is a very\r\nproper letter; right sense, proper feeling--and if he never gamed in his\r\nlife, what would you have more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are different ways of understanding such a denial as this,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip. \xe2\x80\x98See, he says not in the way in which I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99 He held up\r\nhis hand authoritatively, as his aunt was about to interpose. \xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nagainst gaming that his vow was made. I never thought he had played, but\r\nhe never says he has not betted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He would never be guilty of a subterfuge!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not have thought so, without the evidence of the payment of\r\nthe cheque, my uncle had just given him, to this gambling fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip; \xe2\x80\x98yet it is only the natural consequence of the habit of eluding\r\ninquiry into his visits to London.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason for so harsh an accusation,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should hardly want more reason than his own words. He refuses to\r\nanswer the question on which my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s good opinion depends; he owns he\r\nhas been to blame, and thus retracts his full denial. In my opinion, his\r\nletter says nothing so plainly as, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I can stand fair with you I do\r\nnot wish to break with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will not find that quite so easy.\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I am no\r\nfool to be hoodwinked, especially where my little Amy is concerned. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsee all plain and straight before he says another word of her. But you\r\nsee what comes of their settling it while I was out of the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was grieved to see him so hurt at this. It could not\r\nhave been helped, and if all had been smooth, he never would have\r\nthought of it again; but it served to keep up his dignity in his own\r\neyes, and, as he fancied, to defend him from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s censure, and he\r\ntherefore made the most of it, which so pained her that she did not\r\nventure to continue her championship of Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98the question is what to do next--eh,\r\nPhilip?\xe2\x80\x99 I wish he would have spoken openly. I hate mysteries. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwrite and tell him this won\xe2\x80\x99t do; he must be explicit--eh, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will talk it over by and by,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\nHis aunt understood that it was to be in her absence, and left the room,\r\nfearing it would be impossible to prevent Amy from being distressed,\r\nthough she had no doubt that Guy would be able to prove his innocence of\r\nthe charges. She found Amy waiting for her in her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, ring, mamma, dear. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fasten your dress,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; then\r\npausing--\xe2\x80\x98Oh! mamma, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I ought to ask, but if you\r\nwould only tell me if there is nothing gone wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is anything really wrong, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, kissing her, as she saw how her colour first deepened and\r\nthen faded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! no,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But there is some mystery about his money-matters, which has vexed your\r\npapa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what has Philip to do with it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot quite tell, my dear. I believe Margaret Henley has heard\r\nsomething, but I do not know the whole.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see his letter, mamma? said Amy, in a low, trembling voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is just like himself, and absolutely denies the accusations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy did not say \xe2\x80\x98then they are false,\xe2\x80\x99 but she held up her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then papa is satisfied?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt all will be made clear in time,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nthere is still something unexplained, and I am afraid things may not\r\ngo smoothly just now. I am very sorry, my little Amy, that such a cloud\r\nshould have come over you, she added, smoothing fondly the long, soft\r\nhair, sad at heart to see the cares and griefs of womanhood gathering\r\nover her child\xe2\x80\x99s bright, young life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said I must learn to bear things!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Amy to herself. \xe2\x80\x98Only,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand the tears filled her eyes, and she spoke with almost childish\r\nsimplicity of manner, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear them to vex him. I wish Philip would\r\nlet papa settle it alone. Guy will be angry, and grieved afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by the dinner-bell, but Amy ran into her own room\r\nfor one moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said I would learn to bear,\xe2\x80\x99 said she to herself, \xe2\x80\x98or I shall never\r\nbe fit for him. Yes, I will, even though it is the thinking he is\r\nunhappy. He said I must be his Verena; I know what that means; I ought\r\nnot to be uneasy, for he will bear it beautifully, and say he is glad of\r\nit afterwards. And I will try not to seem cross to Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was fidgety and ill at ease, found fault with the dinner,\r\nand was pettish with his wife. Mrs. Edmonstone set Philip off\r\nupon politics, which lasted till the ladies could escape into the\r\ndrawing-room. In another minute Philip brought in Charles, set him down,\r\nand departed. Amy, who was standing by the window, resting her forehead\r\nagainst the glass, and gazing into the darkness, turned round hastily,\r\nand left the room, but in passing her brother, she put her hand into\r\nhis, and received a kind pressure. Her mother followed her, and the\r\nother three all began to wonder. Charles said he had regularly been\r\nturned out of the dining-room by Philip, who announced that he wanted to\r\nspeak to his uncle, and carried him off.\r\n\r\nThey conjectured, and were indignant at each other\xe2\x80\x99s conjectures, till\r\ntheir mother returned, and gave them as much information as she could;\r\nbut this only made them very anxious. Charles was certain that Mrs.\r\nHenley had laid a cockatrice egg, and Philip was hatching it; and Laura\r\ncould not trust herself to defend Philip, lest she should do it too\r\nvehemently. They could all agree in desire to know the truth, in hope\r\nthat Guy was not culpable, and, above all, in feeling for Amy; but by\r\ntacit consent they were silent on the three shades of opinion in their\r\nminds. Laura was confident that Philip was acting for the best; Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone thought he might be mistaken in his premises, but desirous of\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s real good; and Charles, though sure he would allege nothing which\r\nhe did not believe to be true, also thought him ready to draw the worst\r\nconclusions from small grounds, and to take pleasure in driving Mr.\r\nEdmonstone to the most rigorous measures.\r\n\r\nPhilip, meanwhile, was trying to practise great moderation and\r\nforbearance, not bringing forward at first what was most likely to\r\nincense Mr. Edmonstone, and without appearance of animosity in his cool,\r\nguarded speech. There was no design in this, he meant only to be just;\r\nyet anything less cool would have had far less effect.\r\n\r\nWhen he shut the dining-room door, he found his uncle wavering, touched\r\nby the sight of his little Amy, returning to his first favourable view\r\nof Guy\xe2\x80\x99s letter, ready to overlook everything, accept the justification,\r\nand receive his ward on the same footing as before, though he was at\r\nthe same time ashamed that Philip should see him relent, and desirous\r\nof keeping up his character for firmness, little guessing how his nephew\r\nfelt his power over him, and knew that he could wield him at will.\r\n\r\nPerceiving and pitying his feebleness, and sincerely believing strong\r\nmeasures the only rescue for Amy, the only hope for Guy, Philip found\r\nhimself obliged to work on him by the production of another letter from\r\nhis sister. He would rather, if possible, have kept this back, so much\r\ndid his honourable feeling recoil from what had the air of slander and\r\nmischief-making; but he regarded firmness on his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s part as the\r\nonly chance for Guy or for his cousin, and was resolved not to let him\r\nswerve from strict justice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley had written immediately after Guy\xe2\x80\x99s outburst in her house,\r\nand, taking it for granted that her brother would receive a challenge,\r\nshe wrote in the utmost alarm, urging him to remember how precious he\r\nwas to her, and not to depart from his own principles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not be so mad as to fight him, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nanxiously. \xe2\x80\x98You know better--besides, for poor Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the sake of right,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip, \xe2\x80\x98no. I have reassured my\r\nsister. I have told her that, let the boy do what he will, he shall\r\nnever make me guilty of his death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard from him, then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I suppose a night\xe2\x80\x99s reflection convinced him that he had no\r\nrational grounds for violent proceedings, and he had sense enough not to\r\nexpose himself to such an answer as I should have given. What caused his\r\nwrath to be directed towards me especially, I cannot tell, nor can my\r\nsister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, looking full at his uncle; \xe2\x80\x98but I seem to have\r\ncome in for a full share of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to read the description of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s passion, and the\r\nexpressions he had used. Violent as it had been, it did not lose in\r\nMrs. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s colouring; and what made the effect worse was that she had\r\nomitted to say she had overheard his language, so that it appeared as\r\nif he had been unrestrained even by gentlemanly feeling, and had thus\r\nspoken of her brother and uncle in her presence.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was resentful now, really displeased, and wounded to the\r\nquick. The point on which he was especially sensitive was his reputation\r\nfor sense and judgment; and that Guy, who had shown him so much respect\r\nand affection, whom he had treated with invariable kindness, and\r\nreceived into his family like a son, that he should thus speak of him\r\nshocked him extremely. He was too much overcome even to break out into\r\nexclamations at first, he only drank off his glass of wine hastily, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I would never have thought it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith these words, all desire for forbearance and toleration departed. If\r\nGuy could speak thus of him, he was ready to believe any accusation,\r\nto think him deceitful from the first, to say he had been trifling with\r\nAmy, to imagine him a confirmed reprobate, and cast him off entirely.\r\nPhilip had some difficulty to restrain him from being too violent;\r\nand to keep him to the matter in hand, he defended Guy from the\r\nexaggerations of his imagination in a manner which appeared highly\r\nnoble, considering how Guy had spoken of him. Before they parted that\r\nnight, another letter had been written, which stood thus,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR SIR GUY,--Since you refuse the confidence which I have a right to\r\ndemand, since you elude the explanation I asked, and indulge yourself in\r\nspeaking in disrespectful terms of me and my family, I have every reason\r\nto suppose that you have no desire to continue on the same footing as\r\nheretofore at Hollywell. As your guardian, I repeat that I consider\r\nmyself bound to keep a vigilant watch over your conduct, and, if\r\npossible, to recover you from the unhappy course in which you have\r\ninvolved yourself: but all other intercourse between you and this family\r\nmust cease. \xe2\x80\x98Your horse shall be sent to Redclyffe to-morrow.\r\n\r\n                                \xe2\x80\x98Yours faithfully,\r\n                                   \xe2\x80\x98C. EDMONSTONE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter was more harsh than Philip wished; but Mr. Edmonstone would\r\nhardly be prevailed on to consent to enter on no further reproaches.\r\nHe insisted on banishing Deloraine, as well as on the mention of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisrespect, both against his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s opinion; but it was necessary to\r\nlet him have his own way on these points, and Philip thought himself\r\nfortunate in getting a letter written which was in any degree rational\r\nand moderate.\r\n\r\nThey had been so busy, and Mr. Edmonstone so excited, that Philip\r\nthought it best to accept the offer of tea being sent them in the\r\ndining-room, and it was not till nearly midnight that their conference\r\nbroke up, when Mr. Edmonstone found his wife sitting up by the\r\ndressing-room fire, having shut Charles\xe2\x80\x99s door, sorely against his will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 began Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98you may tell Amy she may give him up,\r\nand a lucky escape she has had. But this is what comes of settling\r\nmatters in my absence.\xe2\x80\x99 So he proceeded with the narration, mixing the\r\nfacts undistinguishably with his own surmises, and overwhelming his wife\r\nwith dismay. If a quarter of this was true, defence of Guy was out of\r\nthe question; and it was still more impossible to wish Amy\xe2\x80\x99s attachment\r\nto him to continue; and though much was incredible, it was no time to\r\nsay so. She could only hope morning would soften her husband\xe2\x80\x99s anger,\r\nand make matters explicable.\r\n\r\nMorning failed to bring her comfort. Mr. Edmonstone repeated that Amy\r\nmust be ordered to give up all thoughts of Guy, and she perceived that\r\nthe words ascribed to him stood on evidence which could not be doubted.\r\nShe could believe he might have spoken them in the first shock of an\r\nunjust imputation, and she thought he might have been drawn into some\r\nscrape to serve a friend; but she could never suppose him capable of all\r\nMr. Edmonstone imagined.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to plead his cause, however, brought on her an angry\r\nreply; for Philip, by a hint, that she never saw a fault in Guy, had put\r\nit into his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s head that she would try to lead him, and made him\r\nparticularly inaccessible to her influence.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it, then; poor little Amy must hear the worst;\r\nand it was not long before Mrs. Edmonstone found her waiting in the\r\ndressing-room. Between obedience to her husband, her conviction of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninnocence, and her tenderness to her daughter, Mrs. Edmonstone had a\r\nhard task, and she could scarcely check her tears as Amy nestled up for\r\nher morning kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O mamma! what is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest, I told you a cloud was coming. Try to bear it. Your papa is\r\nnot satisfied with Guy\xe2\x80\x99s answer, and it seems he spoke some hasty words\r\nof papa and Philip; they have displeased papa very much, and, my dear\r\nchild, you must try to bear it, he has written to tell Guy he must not\r\nthink any more of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has spoken hasty words of papa!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Amy, as if she had not\r\nheard the rest. \xe2\x80\x98How sorry he must be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Charles\xe2\x80\x99s door was pushed open, and in he came, half\r\ndressed, scrambling on, with but one crutch, to the chair near which she\r\nstood, with drooping head and clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, little Amy, he said; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay my life \xe2\x80\x98tis only some\r\nmonstrous figment of Mrs. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s. Trust my word, it will right itself;\r\nit is only a rock to keep true love from running too smooth. Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncry, as her tears began to flow fast, \xe2\x80\x98I only meant to cheer you up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid, Charlie, said his mother, putting a force on her own\r\nfeeling, \xe2\x80\x98it is not the best or kindest way to do her good by telling\r\nher to dwell on hopes of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma one of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s faction!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of no faction at all, Charles, but I am afraid it is a bad case;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nMrs. Edmonstone related what she knew; glad to address herself to any\r\none but Amy, who stood still, meanwhile, her hands folded on the back of\r\nher brother\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\nCharles loudly protested that the charges were absurd and preposterous,\r\nand would be proved so in no time. He would finish dressing instantly,\r\ngo to speak to his father, and show him the sense of the thing. Amy\r\nheard and hoped, and his mother, who had great confidence in his clear\r\nsight, was so cheered as almost to expect that today\xe2\x80\x99s post might carry\r\na conciliatory letter.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Laura and Philip met in the breakfast-room, and in answer to\r\nher anxious inquiry, he had given her an account of Guy, which, though\r\nharsh enough, was far more comprehensible than what the rest had been\r\nable to gather.\r\n\r\nShe was inexpressibly shocked, \xe2\x80\x98My poor dear little Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Philip, now I see all you thought to save me from!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is an unhappy business that it ever was permitted!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little dear! She was so happy, so very happy and sweet in her\r\nhumility and her love. Do you know, Philip, I was almost jealous for a\r\nmoment that all should be so easy for them; and I blamed poverty; but\r\noh! there are worse things than poverty!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, but his dark blue eye softened with the tender look\r\nknown only to her; and it was one of the precious moments for which she\r\nlived. She was happy till the rest came down, and then a heavy cloud\r\nseemed to hang on them at breakfast time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles, who found anxiety on Guy\xe2\x80\x99s account more exciting, though\r\nconsiderably less agreeable, than he had once expected, would not go\r\naway with the womankind; but as soon as the door was shut, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now then, Philip, let me know the true grounds of your persecution.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not a conciliating commencement. His father was offended, and\r\npoured out a confused torrent of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s imagined misdeeds, while Philip\r\nexplained and modified his exaggerations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So the fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, at length, \xe2\x80\x98that Guy has asked for his\r\nown money, and when in lieu of it he received a letter full of unjust\r\ncharges, he declared Philip was a meddling coxcomb. I advise you not to\r\njustify his opinion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip disdained to reply, and after a few more of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexclamations Charles proceeded,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is the great sum total.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98I have proof of his gambling.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have shown it to your father, and he is satisfied.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not proof enough that he is lost to all sense of propriety,\r\nthat he should go and speak in that fashion of us, and to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nsister?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98What would you have more?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That little epithet applied to Captain Morville is hardly, to my mind,\r\nproof sufficient that a man is capable of every vice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles,\r\nwho, in the pleasure of galling his cousin, did not perceive the harm\r\nhe did his friend\xe2\x80\x99s cause, by recalling the affront which his father,\r\nat least, felt most deeply. Mr. Edmonstone grew angry with him for\r\ndisregarding the insulting term applied to himself; and Charles, who,\r\nthough improved in many points, still sometimes showed the effects of\r\nearly habits of disrespect to his father, answered hastily, that no one\r\ncould wonder at Guy\xe2\x80\x99s resenting such suspicions; he deserved no blame at\r\nall, and would have been a blockhead to bear it tamely.\r\n\r\nThis was more than Charles meant, but his temper was fairly roused, and\r\nhe said much more than was right or judicious, so that his advocacy only\r\ninjured the cause. He had many representations to make on the injustice\r\nof condemning Guy unheard, of not even laying before him the proofs on\r\nwhich the charges were founded, and on the danger of actually driving\r\nhim into mischief, by shutting the doors of Hollywell against him. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou wanted to make him all you say he is, you are taking the very best\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nQuite true; but Charles had made his father too angry to pay attention.\r\nThis stormy discussion continued for nearly two hours, with no effect\r\nsave inflaming the minds of all parties. At last Mr. Edmonstone was\r\ncalled away; and Charles, rising, declared he should go at that moment,\r\nand write to tell Guy that there was one person at least still in his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will do as you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for the permission,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not to me that your submission is due,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, Philip, I submit to my own father readily, but I do\r\nnot submit to Captain Morville\xe2\x80\x99s instrument.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have had enough of unbecoming retorts for one day,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\r\nquietly, and offering his arm.\r\n\r\nMuch as Charles disliked it, he was in too great haste not to accept it;\r\nand perceiving that there were visitors in the drawing-room, he desired\r\nto go up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98People who always come when they are not wanted!\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered, as he\r\nwent up, pettish with them as with everything else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not think you in a fit mood to be advised, Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but to free my own conscience, let me say this. Take care how you\r\npromote this unfortunate attachment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care what you say!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles, flushing with anger, as\r\nhe threw himself forward, with an impatient movement, trusting to his\r\ncrutch rather than retain his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s arm; but the crutch slipped, he\r\nmissed his grasp at the balusters, and would have fallen to the bottom\r\nof the flight if Philip had not been close behind. Stretching out his\r\nfoot, he made a barrier, receiving Charles\xe2\x80\x99s weight against his breast,\r\nand then, taking him in his arms, carried him up the rest of the way\r\nas easily as if he had been a child. The noise brought Amy out of the\r\ndressing-room, much frightened, though she did not speak till Charles\r\nwas deposited on the sofa, and assured them he was not in the least\r\nhurt, but he would hardly thank his cousin for having so dexterously\r\nsaved him; and Philip, relieved from the fear of his being injured,\r\nviewed the adventure as a mere ebullition of ill-temper, and went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fine helpless log am I,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles, as he found himself alone\r\nwith Amy. \xe2\x80\x98A pretty thing for me to talk of being of any use, when I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t so much as show my anger at an impertinence about my own sister,\r\nwithout being beholden for not breaking my neck to the very piece of\r\npresumption that uttered it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so\xe2\x80\x99 began Amy; and at that moment Philip was close\r\nto them, set down the crutch that had been dropped, and went without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who hears,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98I say there is no greater\r\nmisery in this world than to have the spirit of a man and the limbs of a\r\ncripple. I know if I was good for anything, things would not long be in\r\nthis state. I should be at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s by this time, at the bottom of\r\nthe whole story, and Philip would be taught to eat his words in no time,\r\nand make as few wry faces as suited his dignity. But what is the use of\r\ntalking? This sofa\xe2\x80\x99--and he struck his fist against it--\xe2\x80\x98is my prison,\r\nand I am a miserable cripple, and it is mere madness in me to think of\r\nbeing attended to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy, caressingly, and much distressed, \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t talk\r\nso. Indeed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it! You know it is not so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do I? Have not I been talking myself hoarse, showing up their\r\ninjustice, saying all a man could say to bring them to reason, and not\r\nan inch could I move them. I do believe Philip has driven my father\r\nstark mad with these abominable stories of his sister\xe2\x80\x99s, which I verily\r\nbelieve she invented herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no, she could not. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Are you going to believe them, too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is that which drives me beyond all patience,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nsee Philip lay hold of my father, and twist him about as he chooses, and\r\nset every one down with his authority.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip soon goes abroad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, who could not at the moment say\r\nanything more charitable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! there is the hope. My father will return to his natural state\r\nprovided they don\xe2\x80\x99t drive Guy, in the meantime, to do something\r\ndesperate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, they won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, give me the blotting-book. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to him this moment, and\r\ntell him we are not all the tools of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s malice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy gave the materials to her brother, and then turning away, busied\r\nherself in silence as best she might, in the employment her mother had\r\nrecommended her, of sorting some garden-seeds for the cottagers. After\r\nan interval, Charles said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Amy, what shall I say to him for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a little silence, and presently Amy whispered, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nI ought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Charles, not catching her very low tones, as she sat\r\nbehind him, with her head bent down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be right,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, more steadily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not right for you to say you don\xe2\x80\x99t think him a villain?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa said I was to have no--\xe2\x80\x98and there her voice was stopped with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is absurd, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98when it all was approved at first,\r\nand now my father is acting on a wrong impression; what harm can there\r\nbe in it? Every one would do so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure he would not think it right,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He? You\xe2\x80\x99ll never have any more to say to him, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take care\r\nwhat you are about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in a broken voice. \xe2\x80\x98It is not right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! folly!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98You are as bad as the rest. When they\r\nare persecuting, and slandering, and acting in the most outrageous way\r\nagainst him, and you know one word of yours would carry him through all,\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t say it, to save him from distraction, and from doing all my\r\nfather fancies he has done. Then I believe you don\xe2\x80\x99t care a rush for\r\nhim, and never want to see him again, and believe the whole monstrous\r\nfarrago. I vow I\xe2\x80\x99ll say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Charles, you are very cruel!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with an irrepressible burst\r\nof weeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you send one word to comfort\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe wept in silence for some moments; at last she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would not comfort him to think me disobedient. He will trust me\r\nwithout, and he will know what you think. You are very kind, dear\r\nCharlie; but don\xe2\x80\x99t persuade me any more, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it. I am going\r\naway now; but don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy I am angry, only I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can sit by\r\nwhile you write that letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor little Amy, she seldom knew worse pain than at that moment, when\r\nshe was obliged to go away to put it out of her power to follow the\r\npromptings of her heart to send the few kind words which might prove\r\nthat nothing could shake her love and trust.\r\n\r\nA fresh trial awaited her when she looked from her own window. She\r\nsaw Deloraine led out, his chestnut neck glossy in the sun and William\r\nprepared for a journey, and the other servants shaking hands, and\r\nbidding him good-bye. She saw him ride off, and could hardly help flying\r\nback to her brother to exclaim, \xe2\x80\x98O Charlie, they have sent Deloraine\r\naway!\xe2\x80\x99 while the longing to send one kind greeting became more earnest\r\nthan ever; but she withstood it, and throwing herself on the bed,\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will never come back--never, never!\xe2\x80\x99 and gave way, unrestrainedly,\r\nto a fit of weeping; nor was it till this had spent itself that she\r\ncould collect her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on the side of her bed trying to compose herself, when\r\nLaura, came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own Amy--my poor, dearest,--I am very sorry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, dear Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 and Amy gladly rested her aching head on her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I knew what to do for you!\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Laura. \xe2\x80\x98You cannot, cease\r\nto think about him, and yet you ought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I ought, I suppose I can,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy in a voice exhausted with\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right, darling. You will not be weak, and pine for one who is\r\nnot worthy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not worthy, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, withdrawing her arm, and holding up her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! my poor Amy, we thought--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and it is so still. I know it is so. I know he did not do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what do you think of Margaret and Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is some mistake.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd how can you defend what he said of papa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, hiding her face. \xe2\x80\x98That is the worst; but I am sure\r\nit was only a moment\xe2\x80\x99s passion, and that he must be very unhappy about\r\nit now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think papa would mind it, at least not long, if it\r\nwas not for this other dreadful misapprehension. O, Laura! why cannot\r\nsomething be done to clear it up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything will be done,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. Papa has written to Mr. Wellwood,\r\nand Philip means to go and make inquiries at Oxford and St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not till term begins. You know he is to have a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s leave before\r\nthe regiment goes to Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I hope it will come right then. People must come to an\r\nunderstanding when they meet; it is so different from writing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will do everything to set things on a right footing. You may be\r\nconfident of that, Amy, for your sake as much as anything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t think why he should know I have anything to do with it,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmy, blushing. \xe2\x80\x98I had much rather he did not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely, Amy, you think he can be trusted with your secret; and there\r\nis no one who can take more care for you. You must look on him as one of\r\nourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy made no answer, and Laura, was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are vexed with him for having told this to papa; but that is not\r\nreasonable of you, Amy; your better sense must tell you that it is the\r\nonly truly kind course, both towards Guy and yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was said in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s manner, which perhaps made it harder to bear;\r\nand Amy could scarcely answer,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He means it for the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not have had him be silent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, sadly. \xe2\x80\x98No; he should have done something, but\r\nhe might have done it more kindly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura endeavoured to persuade her that nothing could have been more kind\r\nand judicious, and Amy sat dejectedly owning the good intention, and\r\nsoothed by the affection of her family; with the bitter suffering of her\r\nheart unallayed, with all her fond tender feelings torn at the thought\r\nof what Guy must be enduring, and with the pain of knowing it was her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s work. She had one comfort, in the certainty that Guy would bear\r\nit nobly. She was happy to find her confidence confirmed by her mother\r\nand Charles; and one thing she thought she need not give up, though\r\nshe might no longer think of him as her lover, she might be his Verena\r\nstill, whether he knew it or not. It could not be wrong to remember any\r\none in her prayers, and to ask that he might not be led into temptation,\r\nbut have strength to abide patiently. That helped her to feel that he\r\nwas in the hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known; and\r\na line of poetry seemed to be whispered in her ears, in his own sweet\r\ntones,--\r\n\r\n           Wait, and the cloud shall roll away.\r\n\r\nSo, after the first day, she went on pretty well. She was indeed silent\r\nand grave, and no longer the sunbeam of Hollywell; but she took her\r\nshare in what was passing, and a common observer would hardly have\r\nremarked the submissive melancholy of her manner. Her father was very\r\naffectionate, and often called her his jewel of good girls; but he was\r\ntoo much afraid of women\xe2\x80\x99s tears to talk to her about Guy, he left\r\nthat to her mother: and Mrs. Edmonstone, having seen her submit to her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s will, was unwilling to say more.\r\n\r\nShe doubted whether it was judicious to encourage her in dwelling on\r\nGuy; for, even supposing his character clear, they had offended him\r\ndeeply, and released him from any engagement to her, so that there\r\nwas nothing to prevent him from forming an attachment elsewhere. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone did not think he would; but it was better to say nothing\r\nabout him, lest she should not speak prudently, and only keep up the\r\nsubject in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nCharles stormed and wrangled, told Mr. Edmonstone \xe2\x80\x98he was breaking his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart, that was all;\xe2\x80\x99 and talked of unfairness and injustice,\r\ntill Mr. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond all bearing, that his own son\r\nshould call him a tyrant, and accused Guy of destroying all peace in his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe replies to the letters came; some thought them satisfactory, and\r\nthe others wondered that they thought so. Mr. Wellwood gave the highest\r\ncharacter of his pupil, and could not imagine how any irregularities\r\ncould be laid to his charge; but when asked in plain terms how he\r\ndisposed of his time, could only answer in general, that he had friends\r\nand engagements of his own at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s and its neighbourhood, and\r\nhad been several times at Mrs. Henley\xe2\x80\x99s and at Colonel Harewood\xe2\x80\x99s. The\r\nlatter place, unfortunately, was the very object of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions;\r\nand thus the letter was anything but an exculpation.\r\n\r\nGuy wrote to Charles in the fulness of his heart, expressing gratitude\r\nfor his confidence and sympathy. He again begged for the supposed\r\nevidence of his misconduct, declaring he could explain it, whatever it\r\nmight be, and proceeded to utter deep regrets for his hasty expressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not know what I may have said,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote; \xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt it\r\nwas unpardonable, for I am sure my feelings were so, and that I deserve\r\nwhatever I have brought on myself. I can only submit to Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsentence, and trust that time will bring to his knowledge that I am\r\ninnocent of what I am accused of. He has every right to be displeased\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\nCharles pronounced this to be only Guy\xe2\x80\x99s way of abusing himself; but his\r\nfather saw in it a disguised admission of guilt. It was thought, also,\r\nto be bad sign that Guy intended to remain at South Moor till the end\r\nof the vacation, though Charles argued that he must be somewhere; and if\r\nthey wished to keep him out of mischief, why exile him from Hollywell!\r\nHe would hardly listen to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s representation, that on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount it would not be right to have him there till the mystery was\r\ncleared up.\r\n\r\nHe tried to stir his father up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\ninvestigate matters for himself; but, though Mr. Edmonstone would have\r\nliked the appearance of being important, this failed, because Philip\r\ndeclared it to be unadvisable, knowing that it would be no investigation\r\nat all, and that his uncle would be talked over directly. Next, Charles\r\nwould have persuaded Philip himself to go, but the arrangements about\r\nhis leave did not make this convenient; and it was put off till he\r\nshould pay his farewell visit to his sister, in October. Lastly, Charles\r\nwrote to Mrs. Henley, entreating her to give him some information about\r\nthis mysterious evidence which was wanting, but her reply was a complete\r\n\xe2\x80\x98set down\xe2\x80\x99 for interference in a matter with which he had no concern.\r\n\r\nHe was very angry. In fact, the post seldom came in without occasioning\r\na fresh dispute, which only had the effect of keeping up the heat of Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure, and making the whole house uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nFretfulness and ill-humour seemed to have taken possession of Charles\r\nand his father. Such a state of things had not prevailed since Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrival: Hollywell was hardly like the same house; Mrs. Edmonstone and\r\nLaura could do nothing without being grumbled at or scolded by one\r\nor other of the gentlemen; even Amy now and then came in for a little\r\npetulance on her father\xe2\x80\x99s part, and Charles could not always forgive her\r\nfor saying in her mournful, submissive tome,--\xe2\x80\x98It is of no use to talk\r\nabout it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18\r\n\r\n     This just decree alone I know,\r\n     Man must be disciplined by woe,\r\n     To me, whate\xe2\x80\x99er of good or ill\r\n     The future brings, since come it will,\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99ll bow my spirit, and be still.\r\n              --AESCHYLUS, (Anstice\xe2\x80\x99s Translation.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy, in the meantime, was enduring the storm in loneliness, for he was\r\nunwilling to explain the cause of his trouble to his companions. The\r\nonly occasion of the suspicions, which he could think of, was his\r\nrequest for the sum of money; and this he could not mention to\r\nMr. Wellwood, nor was he inclined to make confidants of his other\r\ncompanions, though pleasant, right-minded youths.\r\n\r\nHe had only announced that he had had a letter which had grieved him\r\nconsiderably, but of which he could not mention the contents; and as\r\nHarry Graham, who knew something of the Broadstone neighbourhood, had\r\npicked up a report that Sir Guy Morville was to marry Lady Eveleen de\r\nCourcy, there was an idea among the party that there was some trouble in\r\nthe way of his attachment. He had once before been made, by some\r\njoke, to colour and look conscious; and now this protected him from\r\ninconvenient questions, and accounted for his depression. He was like\r\nwhat he had been on first coming to Hollywell--grave and silent, falling\r\ninto reveries when others were talking, and much given to long, lonely\r\nwanderings. Accustomed as he had been in boyhood to a solitary life in\r\nbeautiful scenery, there was something in a fine landscape that was to\r\nhim like a friend and companion; and he sometimes felt that it would\r\nhave been worse if he had been in a dull, uniform country, instead of\r\namong mountain peaks and broad wooded valleys. Working hard, too, helped\r\nhim not a little, and conic sections served him almost as well as they\r\nserved Laura.\r\n\r\nA more real help was the neighbourhood of Stylehurst. On the first\r\nSunday after receiving Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s letter, he went to church there,\r\ninstead of with the others, to St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. They thought it was\r\nfor the sake of the solitary walk; but he had other reasons for the\r\npreference. In the first place it was a Communion Sunday, and in the\r\nnext, he could feel more kindly towards Philip there, and he knew he\r\nneeded all that could strengthen such a disposition.\r\n\r\nMany a question did he ask himself, to certify whether he wilfully\r\nentertained malice or hatred, or any uncharitableness. It was a long,\r\ndifficult examination; but at its close, he felt convinced that, if\r\nsuch passions knocked at the door of his heart, it was not at his own\r\nsummons, and that he drove them away without listening to them. And\r\nsurely he might approach to gain the best aid in that battle, especially\r\nas he was certain of his strong and deep repentance for his fit of\r\npassion, and longing earnestly for the pledge of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThe pardon and peace he sought came to him, and in such sort that the\r\ncomfort of that day, when fresh from the first shock, and waiting in\r\nsuspense for some new blow, was such as never to be forgotten. They\r\nlinked themselves with the grave shade of the clustered gray columns,\r\nand the angel heads on roof of that old church; with the long grass and\r\ntall yellow mullens among its churchyard graves, and with the tints of\r\nthe elm-trees that closed it in, their leaves in masses either of green\r\nor yellow, and opening here and there to show the purple hills beyond.\r\n\r\nHe wandered in the churchyard between the services. All enmity to Philip\r\nwas absent now; and he felt as if it would hardly return when he stood\r\nby the graves of the Archdeacon and of the two Frances Morvilles, and\r\nthought what that spot was to his cousin. There were a few flowers\r\nplanted round Mrs. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s grave, but they showed that they had long\r\nbeen neglected, and no such signs of care marked her daughter Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nAnd when Guy further thought of Mrs. Henley, and recollected how Philip\r\nhad sacrificed all his cherished prospects and hopes of distinction, and\r\nembraced an irksome profession, for the sake of these two sisters,\r\nhe did not find it difficult to excuse the sternness, severity, and\r\ndistrust which were an evidence how acutely a warm heart had suffered.\r\n\r\nThough he suffered cruelly from being cut off from Amy, yet his\r\nreverence for her helped him to submit. He had always felt as if she was\r\ntoo far above him; and though he had, beyond his hopes, been allowed\r\nto aspire to the thought of her, it was on trial, and his failure, his\r\nreturn to his old evil passions, had sunk him beneath her. He shuddered\r\nto think of her being united to anything so unlike herself, and which\r\nmight cause her so much misery; it was wretchedness to think that even\r\nnow she might be suffering for him; and yet not for worlds would he have\r\nlost the belief that she was so feeling, or the remembrance of the looks\r\nwhich had shone on him so sweetly and timidly as she sat at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet; though that remembrance was only another form of misery. But Amy\r\nwould be tranquil, pure and good, whatever became of him, and he should\r\nalways be able to think of her, looking like one of those peaceful\r\nspirits, with bending head, folded hands, and a star on its brow, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadiso\xe2\x80\x9d of Flaxman. Her serenity would be untouched; and though she\r\nmight be lost to him, he could still be content while he could look up\r\nat it through his turbid life. Better she were lost to him than that her\r\npeace should be injured.\r\n\r\nHe still, of course, earnestly longed to prove his innocence, though\r\nhis hopes lessened, for as long as the evidence was withheld, he had\r\nno chance. After writing as strongly as he could, he could do no more,\r\nexcept watch for something that might unravel the mystery; and Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwarm sympathy and readiness to assist him were a great comfort.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen his uncle again; perhaps Sebastian was ashamed to meet\r\nhim after their last encounter, and was still absent on his engagement;\r\nbut the wife and child were still at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, and one afternoon,\r\nwhen Guy had rather unwillingly gone thither with Mr. Wellwood, he saw\r\nMrs. Dixon sitting on one of the benches which were placed on the paths\r\ncut out on the side of the hill, looking very smart and smiling, among\r\nseveral persons of her own class.\r\n\r\nTo be ashamed to recognise her was a weakness beneath him; he spoke to\r\nher, and was leaving her, pluming herself on his notice, when he saw\r\nlittle Marianne\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes fixed wistfully upon him, and held out his\r\nhand to her. She ran up to him joyfully, and he led her a few steps from\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s party. \xe2\x80\x98Well, little one, how are you? I have your piece of\r\nspar quite safe. Have you said how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do to Bustle?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bustle! Bustle!\xe2\x80\x99 called the soft voice but it needed a whistle from his\r\nmaster to bring him to be caressed by the little girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been taking any more pleasant walks?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes. We have been all round these pretty paths. And I should like to\r\ngo to the top of this great high hill, and see all round; but mamma says\r\nshe has got a bone in her leg, and cannot go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think mamma would give you leave to go up with me? Should you\r\nlike it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe coloured all over; too happy even to thank him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy to his tutor, \xe2\x80\x98I will meet you here when you have done\r\nyour business in the town, in an hour or so. Poor little thing, she has\r\nnot many pleasures.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Dixon made no difficulty, and was so profuse in thanks that Guy got\r\nout of her way as fast as he could, and was soon on the soft thymy grass\r\nof the hill-side, the little girl frisking about him in great delight,\r\nplaying with Bustle, and chattering merrily.\r\n\r\nLittle Marianne was a delicate child, and her frolic did not last long.\r\nAs the ascent became steeper, her breath grew shorter, and she toiled on\r\nin a resolute uncomplaining manner after his long, vigorous steps, till\r\nhe looked round, and seeing her panting far behind, turned to help her,\r\nlead her, and carry her, till the top was achieved, and the little girl\r\nstood on the topmost stone, gazing round at the broad sunny landscape,\r\nwith the soft green meadows, the harvest fields, the woods in their\r\ngorgeous autumn raiment, and the moorland on the other side, with its\r\nother peaks and cairns, brown with withered bracken, and shadowed in\r\nmoving patches by the floating clouds. The exhilarating wind brought a\r\ncolour into her pale cheeks, and her flossy curls were blowing over her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe watched her in silence, pleased and curious to observe how beautiful\r\na scene struck the childish eye of the little Londoner. The first thing\r\nshe said, after three or four minutes\xe2\x80\x99 contemplation--a long time for\r\nsuch a child--was, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! I never saw anything so pretty!\xe2\x80\x99 then presently\r\nafter, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! I wish little brother Felix was here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a pleasant place to think about your little brother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nkindly; and she looked up in his face, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Oh! do you know\r\nabout Felix?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You shall tell me\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Here, sit on my knee, and rest after your\r\nscramble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma never lets me talk of Felix, because it makes her cry,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nMarianne; but I wish it sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer little heart was soon open. It appeared that Felix was the last who\r\nhad died, the nearest in age to Marianne, and her favourite playfellow.\r\nShe told of some of their sports in their London home, speaking of them\r\nwith eagerness and fondness that showed what joys they had been, though\r\nto Guy they seemed but the very proof of dreariness and dinginess. She\r\ntalked of walks to school, when Felix would tell what he would do when\r\nhe was a man, and how he took care of her at the crossings, and how rude\r\nboys used to drive them, and how they would look in at the shop windows\r\nand settle what they would buy if they were rich. Then she talked of his\r\nbeing ill--ill so very long; how he sat in his little chair, and could\r\nnot play, and then always lay in bed, and she liked to sit by him,\r\nthere; but at last he died, and they carried him away in a great black\r\ncoffin, and he would never come back again. But it was so dull now,\r\nthere was no one to play with her.\r\n\r\nThough the little girl did not cry, she looked very mournful, and Guy\r\ntried to comfort her, but she did not understand him. \xe2\x80\x98Going to heaven\xe2\x80\x99\r\nonly conveyed to her a notion of death and separation, and this phrase,\r\ntogether with a vague idea who had made her, and that she ought to be\r\ngood, seemed to be the extent of the poor child\xe2\x80\x99s religious knowledge.\r\nShe hardly ever had been at church and though she had read one or two\r\nBible stories, it seemed to have been from their having been used as\r\nlessons at school. She had a dim notion that good people read the\r\nBible, and there was one on the little table at home, with the\r\nshell-turkey-cock standing upon it, and mamma read it when Felix died;\r\nbut it was a big book, and the shell-turkey-cock always stood upon it;\r\nin short, it seemed only connected with mamma\xe2\x80\x99s tears, and the loss of\r\nher brother.\r\n\r\nGuy was very much shocked, and so deep in thought that he could hardly\r\ntalk to the child in their progress down the hill; but she was just\r\nso tired as to be inclined to silence, and quite happy clinging to his\r\nhand, till he delivered her over to her mother at the foot of the hill,\r\nand went to join his tutor, at the place appointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wellwood,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, breaking silence, when they had walked about half\r\nway back to the farm, \xe2\x80\x98do you think your cousin would do me a great\r\nkindness? You saw that child? Well, if the parents consent, it would be\r\nthe greatest charity on earth if Miss Wellwood would receive her into\r\nher school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On what terms? What sort of an education is she to have?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The chief thing she wants is to be taught Christianity, poor child;\r\nthe rest Miss Wellwood may settle. She is my first cousin. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether you are acquainted with our family history?\xe2\x80\x99 and he went on to\r\nexplain as much as was needful. It ended in a resolution that if Miss\r\nWellwood would undertake the charge, the proposal should be made to Mrs.\r\nDixon.\r\n\r\nIt was a way of assisting his relations likely to do real good, and on\r\nthe other hand, he would be able, under colour of the payment for the\r\nchild, to further Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s schemes, and give her the interest\r\nof the thousand pounds, until his five and twentieth year might put his\r\nproperty in his own power.\r\n\r\nMiss Wellwood readily consented, much pleased with the simplicity and\r\nabsence of false shame he showed in the whole transaction, and very\r\nanxious for the good of a child in a class so difficult to reach. He\r\nnext went to Mrs. Dixon, expecting more difficulty with her, but he\r\nfound none. She thought it better Marianne should live at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthan die in London, and was ready to catch at the prospect of her being\r\nfitted for a governess. Indeed, she was so strongly persuaded that the\r\nrich cousin might make Marianne\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, that she would have been very\r\nunwilling to interfere with the fancy he had taken for her.\r\n\r\nLittle Marianne was divided between fear of leaving mamma and liking\r\nfor St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, but her first interview with Miss Wellwood, and Miss\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s showing her a little white bed, quite turned the scale in their\r\nfavour. Before the time came for Guy\xe2\x80\x99s return to Oxford, he had seen her\r\nsettled, heard her own account of her happy life, and had listened to\r\nMiss Jane Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s delight in her sweet temper and good disposition.\r\n\r\nThose thousand pounds; Guy considered again and again whether he could\r\nexplain their destination, and whether this would clear him. It seemed\r\nto him only a minor charge, and besides his repugnance to mention such\r\na design, he saw too many obstacles in his way. Captain Morville and his\r\nsister were the very persons from whom Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s project was to\r\nbe kept secret. Besides, what would be gained? It was evident that Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown assertions were doubted, and he could bring no confirmation of them;\r\nhe had never spoken of his intention to his tutor, and Mr. Wellwood\r\ncould, therefore, say nothing in his favour. If Mr. Edmonstone alone had\r\nbeen concerned, or if this had been the only accusation, Guy might have\r\ntried to explain it; but with Philip he knew it would be useless, and\r\ntherefore would not enter on the subject. He could only wait patiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19\r\n\r\n     Most delicately, hour by hour,\r\n     He canvassed human mysteries,\r\n     And stood aloof from other minds.\r\n     Himself unto himself he sold,\r\n     Upon himself, himself did feed,\r\n     Quiet, dispassionate, and cold,\r\n     With chiselled features clear and sleek.\r\n                                --TENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy had been about a week at Oxford, when one evening, as he was\r\nsitting alone in his rooms, he received an unexpected visit from Captain\r\nMorville. He was glad, for he thought a personal interview would remove\r\nall misconstructions, and held out his hand cordially, saying:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You here, Philip! When did you come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half an hour ago. I am on my way to spend a week with the Thorndales. I\r\ngo on to-morrow to my sister\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile speaking, Philip was surveying the apartment, for he held that a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s room is generally an indication of his disposition, and assuredly\r\nthere was a great deal of character in his own, with the scrupulous\r\nneatness and fastidious taste of its arrangements. Here, he thought, he\r\ncould not fail to see traces of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s habits, but he was obliged\r\nto confess to himself that there was very little to guide him. The\r\nfurniture was strictly as its former occupant had left it, only rather\r\nthe worse for wear, and far from being in order. The chairs were so\r\nheaped with books and papers, that Guy had to make a clearance of\r\none before his visitor could sit down, but there was nothing else to\r\ncomplain of, not even a trace of cigars; but knowing him to be a great\r\nreader and lover of accomplishments, Philip wondered that the only\r\ndecorations were Laura\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of Sintram, and a little print of\r\nRedclyffe, and the books were chiefly such as were wanted for his\r\nstudies, the few others having for the most part the air of old library\r\nbooks, as if he had sent for them from Redclyffe. Was this another proof\r\nthat he had some way of frittering away his money with nothing to show\r\nfor it? A Sophocles and a lexicon were open before him on the table, and\r\na blotting-book, which he closed, but not before Philip had caught sight\r\nof what looked like verses.\r\n\r\nNeither did his countenance answer Philip\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. It had not his\r\nusual bright lively expression; there was a sadness which made him smile\r\nlike a gleam on a showery day, instead of constant sunshine; but there\r\nwas neither embarrassment nor defiance, and the gleam-like smile was\r\nthere, as with a frank, confiding tone, he said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is very kind of you, to come and see what you can do for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was by no means prepared to be thus met half-way, but he thought\r\nGuy wanted to secure him as an intercessor, and hardened himself into\r\nrighteous severity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one can be more willing to help you than I, but you must, in the\r\nfirst place, help yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nInstantly the sedate measured tone made Guy\xe2\x80\x99s heart and head throb with\r\nimpatience, awakening all the former memories so hardly battled down;\r\nbut with the impulse of anger came the thought, \xe2\x80\x98Here it is again! If I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t keep it down now, I am undone! The enemy will seize me again!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nforced himself not to interrupt, while Philip went calmly on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98While you are not open, nothing can be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My only wish, my only desire, is to be open,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, speaking fast\r\nand low, and repressing the feeling, which, nevertheless, affected his\r\nvoice; \xe2\x80\x98but the opportunity of explanation has never been given me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need complain of that no longer. I am here to convey to my uncle\r\nany explanation you may wish to address to him. I will do my best to\r\ninduce him to attend to it favourably, but he is deeply offended and\r\nhurt by what has passed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know--I know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, colouring deeply, and all irritation\r\ndisappearing from voice and manner; \xe2\x80\x98I know there is no excuse for me.\r\nI can only repeat that I am heartily sorry for whatever I may have said,\r\neither of him or of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Philip, \xe2\x80\x98I should never think of resenting what\r\nyou may have said in a moment of irritation, especially as you express\r\nregret for it. Consider it as entirely overlooked on my part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was nearly choked in uttering a \xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 which did not sound,\r\nafter all, much like acceptance of forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now to the real matter at issue,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip: \xe2\x80\x98the application for the\r\nmoney, which so amazed Mr. Edmonstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not see that it is the point,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98I wanted it for a scheme\r\nof my own: he did not think fit to let me have it, so there is an end of\r\nthe matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr Edmonstone does not think so. He wishes to be convinced that you\r\nhave not spent it beforehand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would you have beyond my word and honour that I have not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed Guy.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to say that he doubts it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; and as at\r\nthose words the flash of the Morville eye darted lightning, he expected\r\nthat the next moment, \xe2\x80\x98Do you?\xe2\x80\x99 would be thundered forth, and he could\r\nnot, with truth, answer \xe2\x80\x98No;\xe2\x80\x99 but it was one of his maxims that a\r\nman need never be forced into an open quarrel, and he tranquilly\r\ncontinued--\xe2\x80\x98but it is better not to depend entirely on assertion. Why do\r\nyou not bring him full proofs of your good intention, and thus restore\r\nyourself to his confidence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have said that I am bound not to mention the purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; then, while Guy bit his lip till it bled,\r\nthe pain really a relief, by giving some vent to his anger at the\r\nimplied doubt, he went on,--\xe2\x80\x98If it is impossible to clear this up, the\r\nnext advice I would give is, that you should show what your expenditure\r\nhas been; lay your accounts before him, and let them justify you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMost people would have resented this as an impertinent proposal, were\r\nit only that doing so would have served to conceal the awkward fact\r\nthat the accounts had not been kept at all. Guy had never been taught\r\nto regard exactness in this respect as a duty, had no natural taste for\r\nprecision, and did not feel responsible to any person; nor if he had\r\nkept any, could he have shown them, without exposing his uncle. To\r\nrefuse, would, however, be a subterfuge, and after a moment, he made an\r\neffort, and confessed he had none to show, though he knew Philip would\r\ndespise him for it as a fool, and probably take it as positive evidence\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nIt would have been more bearable if Philip would but have said \xe2\x80\x98How\r\nfoolish,\xe2\x80\x99 instead of drily repeating \xe2\x80\x98Unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, during which Guy was not sufficiently master of himself\r\nto speak, Philip added--\xe2\x80\x98Then this matter of the thousand pounds is to\r\nbe passed over? You have no explanation to offer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No:\xe2\x80\x99 and again he paused. \xe2\x80\x98When my word is not accepted, I have no more\r\nto say. But this is not the point. What I would know is, what are the\r\ncalumnies that accuse me of having gamed? If you really wish to do me\r\na service, you will give me an opportunity of answering these precious\r\nproofs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will\xe2\x80\x99 answered Philip; who could venture on doing so himself, though,\r\nfor his sister\xe2\x80\x99s sake, it was unsafe to trust Mr. Edmonstone, with whom\r\nwhat was not an absolute secret was not a secret at all. \xe2\x80\x98My uncle knows\r\nthat a thirty pound cheque of his, in your name, was paid by you to a\r\nnotorious gamester.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy did not shrink, as he simply answered--\xe2\x80\x98It is true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet you have neither played, nor betted, nor done anything that could\r\ncome under the definition of gambling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why this payment?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot explain that. I know appearances are against me,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Guy\r\nsteadily, and with less irritation than he had hitherto shown. I once\r\nthought my simple word would have sufficed, but, since it seems that\r\nwill not do, I will not again make what you call assertions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In fact, while you profess a desire to be open and sincere, a mystery\r\nappears at every turn. What would you have us do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you think fit,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered proudly.\r\n\r\nPhilip had been used to feel men\xe2\x80\x99s wills and characters bend and give\r\nway beneath his superior force of mind. They might, like Charles, chafe\r\nand rage, but his calmness always gave him the ascendant almost without\r\nexertion, and few people had ever come into contact with him without a\r\ncertain submission of will or opinion. With Guy alone it was not so;\r\nhe had been sensible of it once or twice before; he had no mastery, and\r\ncould no more bend that spirit than a bar of steel. This he could not\r\nbear, for it obliged him to be continually making efforts to preserve\r\nhis own sense of superiority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Since this is your ultimatum,\xe2\x80\x99 he said--\xe2\x80\x98since you deny your\r\nconfidence, and refuse any reply to these charges, you have no right to\r\ncomplain of suspicion. I shall do my best, both as your true friend, and\r\nas acting with your guardian\xe2\x80\x99s authority, to discover all that may lead\r\nto the elucidation of the mystery. In the first place, I am desired to\r\nmake every inquiry here as to your conduct and expenditure. I hope they\r\nwill prove satisfactory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy, his voice stern and\r\ndignified, and the smile that curled his lip was like Philip\xe2\x80\x99s own.\r\n\r\nPhilip was positively annoyed, and desirous to say something to put him\r\ndown, but he had not committed himself by any vehemence, and Philip\r\nwas too cool and wise to compromise his own dignity, so he rose to go,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Good night! I am sorry I cannot induce you to act in the only\r\nway that can right you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night!\xe2\x80\x99 replied Guy, in the same dignified manner in which he had\r\nspoken ever since his passion had been surmounted.\r\n\r\nThey parted, each feeling that matters were just where they were before.\r\nPhilip went back to his inn, moralizing on the pride and perverseness\r\nwhich made it impossible to make any impression on a Redclyffe Morville,\r\nwhom not even the fear of detection could lead to submission.\r\n\r\nNext morning, while Philip was hastily breakfasting, the door opened,\r\nand Guy entered, pale and disturbed, as if he had been awake all night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in his frank, natural voice, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we parted\r\nlast night as your good intentions deserved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, ho!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Philip; \xe2\x80\x98the fear of an investigation has brought him\r\nto reason;\xe2\x80\x99 and he said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I am very glad you see things in a truer\r\nlight this morning;\xe2\x80\x99 then asked if he had breakfasted. He had; and his\r\ncousin added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you anything to say on the matter we discussed last night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No. I can only repeat that I am not guilty, and wait for time to show\r\nmy innocence. I only came to see you once more, that I might feel we\r\nparted friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall always hope to be a true friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not come here for altercation,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy (an answer rather to the\r\nspirit than the words), \xe2\x80\x98so I will say no more. If you wish to see me\r\nagain, you will find me in my rooms. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was puzzled. He wondered whether Guy had come wishing to\r\npropitiate him, but had found pride indomitable at the last moment; or\r\nwhether he had been showing himself too severely just to admit entreaty.\r\nHe would be able to judge better after he had made his inquiries, and he\r\nproceeded with them at once. He met with no such replies as he expected.\r\nEvery one spoke of Sir Guy Morville in high terms, as strict in his\r\nhabits of application, and irreproachable in conduct. He was generally\r\nliked, and some regret was expressed that he lived in so secluded\r\na manner, forming so few intimacies; but no one seemed to think it\r\npossible that anything wrong could be imputed to him. Philip could even\r\nperceive that there was some surprise that such inquiries should be\r\nmade at all, especially by so young a man as himself. Mr. Wellwood, the\r\nperson whom he most wished to see, was not at Oxford, but was at home\r\npreparing for his ordination.\r\n\r\nNor could Philip get nearer to the solution of the mystery when he went\r\nto the tradesmen, who were evidently as much surprised as the tutors,\r\nand said he always paid in ready money. Captain Morville felt like a\r\nlawyer whose case is breaking down, no discoveries made, nothing done;\r\nbut he was not one whit convinced of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s innocence, thinking\r\nthe college authorities blind and careless, and the tradesmen combined\r\nto conceal their extortions, or else that the mischief had been done\r\nat St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. He was particularly provoked when he remembered Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninvitation to him to come to his rooms, knowing, as he must have done,\r\nwhat would be the result of his inquiry.\r\n\r\nPhilip was conscious that it would have been kind to have gone to say\r\nthat, so far, he had found nothing amiss, but he did not like giving Guy\r\nthis passing triumph. It made no difference in his real opinion; and\r\nwhy renew a useless discussion? He persuaded himself that he had left\r\nhimself no time, and should miss the train, and hastened off to the\r\nstation, where he had to wait a quarter of an hour, consoling himself\r\nwith reflecting--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After all, though I might have gone to him, it would have been useless.\r\nHe is obstinate, and occasions of irritating his unfortunate temper are\r\nabove all to be avoided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne short year after, what would not Philip have given for that quarter\r\nof an hour!\r\n\r\nBy six o\xe2\x80\x99clock he was at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, greeted with delight by his\r\nsister, and with cordiality by Dr. Henley. They were both proud of him,\r\nand every tender feeling his sister had was for Philip, her pet, and\r\nher pupil in his childhood, and her most valued companion and counsellor\r\nthrough her early womanhood.\r\n\r\nShe had a picked dinner-party to meet him, for she knew the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation was not exactly the thing to entertain him through a whole\r\nevening, and the guests might well think they had never seen a handsomer\r\nor more clever brother and sister than Mrs. Henley and Captain Morville.\r\nThe old county families, if they did wonder at her marriage, were always\r\nglad to meet her brother, and it was a great pleasure to him to see old\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nOnly once did his sister, in the course of the evening, make him feel\r\nthe difference of their sentiments, and that was about Miss Wellwood.\r\nPhilip defended her warmly; and when he heard that there was a plan\r\ngetting up for excluding her from the hospital, he expressed strong\r\ndisapprobation at the time; and after the guests were gone, spoke upon\r\nthe subject with his sister and her husband. The doctor entered into no\r\nparty questions, and had only been stirred up to the opposition by his\r\nwife; he owned that the Miss Wellwoods had done a great deal of good,\r\nand made the nurses do their duty better than he had ever known, and\r\nwas quite ready to withdraw his opposition. Mrs. Henley argued about\r\nopinions, but Philip was a match for her in her own line; and the end\r\nof it was, that though she would not allow herself to be convinced,\r\nand shook her head at her brother\xe2\x80\x99s way of thinking, he knew he had\r\nprevailed, and that Miss Wellwood would be unmolested.\r\n\r\nThere was not another person in the world to whom Margaret would have\r\nyielded; and it served to restore him to the sense of universal dominion\r\nwhich had been a little shaken by his conversation with Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy was a great deal with the Wellwoods,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Henley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was he, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, you need not think of _that_. It would be too absurd. The youngest\r\nmust be twice his age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was not thinking of any such thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, smiling, as he\r\nthought of the very different course Guy\xe2\x80\x99s affections had taken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did hear he was to marry Lady Eveleen de Courcy. Is there anything in\r\nthat report?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; certainly not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should pity the woman who married him, after the specimen I saw of\r\nhis temper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor boy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lady Eveleen has been a great deal at Hollywell, has she not? I rather\r\nwondered my aunt should like to have her there, considering all things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What things, sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Considering what a catch he would be for one of the Edmonstone girls.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you had just been pitying the woman who should marry him.\r\nPerhaps my aunt had Lady Eveleen there to act as a screen for her own\r\ndaughters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That our good-natured aunt should have acted with such ultra-prudence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Margaret, laughing at his grave ironical tone. \xe2\x80\x98Lady Eveleen is\r\nvery pretty, is she not? A mere beauty, I believe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so; she is much admired; but Guy is certainly not inclined to fall\r\nin love with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should have thought him the very man to fall in love young, like his\r\nfather. Do you think there is any chance for either of the Edmonstones?\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s beauty he spoke of, but it was not in a very lover-like way. Do\r\nyou admire Laura so much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And little Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is a mere child, and will hardly ever be anything more; but she is\r\na very good little amiable thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish poor Charles\xe2\x80\x99s temper was improved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So do I; but it is very far from improvement at present, in consequence\r\nof his zeal for Guy. Guy has been very attentive and good natured to\r\nhim, and has quite won his heart; so that I should positively honour him\r\nfor his championship if it was not in great degree out of opposition to\r\nhis father and myself. To-morrow, Margaret, you must give me some guide\r\nto the most probable quarters for learning anything respecting this poor\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s follies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley did her best in that way, and Philip followed up his\r\ninquiries with great ardour, but still unsuccessfully. Jack White, the\r\nhero of the draft, was not at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, nor likely to be heard\r\nof again till the next races; and whether Sir Guy had been on the\r\nrace-ground at all was a doubtful point. Next, Philip walked to\r\nStylehurst, to call on Colonel Harewood, and see if he could learn\r\nanything in conversation with him; but the Colonel did not seem to know\r\nanything, and his sons were not at home. Young Morville was, he thought,\r\na spirited lad, very good natured; he had been out shooting once or\r\ntwice with Tom, and had a very fine spaniel. If he had been at the\r\nraces, the Colonel did not know it; he had some thoughts of asking him\r\nto join their party, but had been prevented.\r\n\r\nThis was no reason, thought Philip, why Guy might not have been with Tom\r\nHarewood without the Colonel\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. Tom was just the man to lead\r\nhim amongst those who were given to betting; he might have been drawn\r\nin, and, perhaps, he had given some pledge of payment when he was of\r\nage, or, possibly, obtained an immediate supply of money from the old\r\nsteward at Redclyffe, who was devotedly attached to him. If so,\r\nPhilip trusted to be able to detect it from the accounts; on the other\r\nsupposition, there was no hope of discovery.\r\n\r\nThe conversation with Colonel Harewood kept him so late that he had no\r\ntime for going, as usual, to his old haunts, at Stylehurst; nor did\r\nhe feel inclined just then to revive the saddening reflections they\r\nexcited. He spent the evening in talking over books with his sister, and\r\nthe next day proceeded on his journey to Thorndale Park.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the places where he was always the most welcome, ever\r\nsince he had been a school-boy, received in a way especially flattering,\r\nconsidering that the friendship was entirely owing to the uncompromising\r\ngood sense and real kindness with which he had kept in order the follies\r\nof his former fag.\r\n\r\nCharles might laugh, and call them the young man and young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompanion, and Guy more classically term them the pious Aeneas and his\r\nfidus Achates, but it was a friendship that did honour to both; and the\r\nvalue that the Thorndales set upon Captain Morville was not misplaced,\r\nand scarcely over-rated. Not particularly clever themselves, they the\r\nmore highly appreciated his endowments, and were proud that James had\r\nbeen able to make such a friend, for they knew, as well as the rest of\r\nthe world, that Captain Morville was far from seeking the acquaintance\r\nfor the sake of their situation in life, but that it was from real\r\nliking and esteem. How far this esteem was gained by the deference the\r\nwhole family paid to his opinion, was another question; at any rate, the\r\ncourting was from them.\r\n\r\nThe Miss Thorndales deemed Captain Morville the supreme authority in\r\ndrawing, literature, and ecclesiastical architecture; and whenever a\r\nperson came in their way who was thought handsome, always pronounced\r\nthat he was not by any means equal to James\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Lady Thorndale\r\ndelighted to talk over James with him, and thank him for his kindness;\r\nand Lord Thorndale, rather a pompous man himself, liked his somewhat\r\nstately manners, and talked politics with him, sincerely wishing he was\r\nhis neighbour at Redclyffe, and calculating how much good he would do\r\nthere. Philip listened with interest to accounts of how the Thorndale\r\nand Morville influence had always divided the borough of Moorworth, and,\r\nif united, might dispose of it at will, and returned evasive answers to\r\nquestions what the young heir of Redclyffe might be likely to do.\r\n\r\nJames Thorndale drove his friend to Redclyffe, as Philip had authority\r\nfrom Mr. Edmonstone to transact any business that might be required\r\nwith Markham, the steward; and, as has been said before, he expected to\r\ndiscover in the accounts something that might explain why Guy had ceased\r\nto press for the thousand pounds. However, he could find nothing amiss\r\nin them, though--bearing in mind that it is less easy to detect the loss\r\nof a score of sheep than of one--he subjected them to a scrutiny which\r\nseemed by no means agreeable to the gruff old grumbling steward. He also\r\nwalked about the park, saw to the marking of certain trees that were\r\ninjuring each other; and finding that there was a misunderstanding\r\nbetween Markham and the new rector, Mr. Ashford, about certain parish\r\nmatters, where the clergyman was certainly right, he bore down Markham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopposition with Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s weight, and felt he was doing good\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHe paused at the gate, and looked back at the wide domain and fine old\r\nhouse. He pitied them, and the simple-hearted, honest tenantry, for\r\nbeing the heritage of such a family, and the possession of one so likely\r\nto misuse them, instead of training them into the means of conferring\r\nbenefits on them, on his country. What would not Philip himself do if\r\nthose lands were his,--just what was needed to give his talents free\r\nscope? and what would it be to see his beautiful Laura their mistress?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20\r\n\r\n     The longing for ignoble things,\r\n     The strife for triumph more than truth,\r\n     The hardening of the heart, that brings\r\n     Irreverence for the dreams of youth.\r\n                               --LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his week at Thorndale Park, Captain Morville returned to make his\r\nfarewell visit at Hollywell, before joining his regiment at Cork, whence\r\nit was to sail for the Mediterranean. He reckoned much on this visit,\r\nfor not even Laura herself could fathom the depth of his affection for\r\nher, strengthening in the recesses where he so sternly concealed it, and\r\nviewing her ever as more faultless since she had been his own. While she\r\nwas his noble, strong-minded, generous, fond Laura, he could bear with\r\nhis disappointment in his sister, with the loss of his home, and with\r\nthe trials that had made him a grave, severe man. She had proved the\r\nstrength of her mind by the self-command he had taught her, and for\r\nwhich he was especially grateful to her, as it made him safer and more\r\nunconstrained, able to venture on more demonstration than in those early\r\ndays when every look had made her blush and tremble.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone brought the carriage to fetch him from the station, and\r\nquickly began,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, as you have not written, you have found nothing out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you could do nothing with him. Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I could not get a word of explanation, nor break through the fence\r\nof pride and reserve. I must do him the justice to say that he bears the\r\nbest of characters at Oxford; and if there were any debts I could not\r\nget at them from the tradesmen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, say no more about it; he is an ungrateful young dog, and I\r\nam sick of it. I only wish I could wash my hands of him altogether.\r\nIt was mere folly to expect any of that set could ever come to good.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s everything going wrong all at once now; poor little Amy breaking\r\nher heart after him, and, worse than all, there\xe2\x80\x99s poor Charlie laid up\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, one of the most affectionate people in the\r\nworld; but his maundering mood making him speak of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness as\r\nif he only regarded it as an additional provocation for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles ill!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; another, of those formations in the joint. I hoped and trusted\r\nthat was all over now; but he is as bad as ever,--has not been able to\r\nmove for a week, and goodness knows when he will again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed! I am very sorry. Is there as much pain as before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes. He has not slept a wink these four nights. Mayerne talks\r\nof opium; but he says he won\xe2\x80\x99t have it till he has seen you, he is so\r\nanxious about this unlucky business. If anything could persuade me to\r\nhave Guy back again it would be that this eternal fretting after him is\r\nso bad for poor Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s account that it is impossible to have him here,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! He shall never set eyes on Amy again unless all this is cleared\r\nup, which it never will be, as I desire mamma to tell her. By the bye,\r\nPhilip, Amy said something of your having a slip with Charles on the\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was very nearly an accident; but I believed he was not hurt. I\r\nhope it has nothing to do with this illness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says it was all his own fault,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98and that he\r\nshould have been actually down but for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But is it really thought it can have caused this attack?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hardly suppose so; but Thompson fancies there may have been some\r\njar. However, don\xe2\x80\x99t distress yourself; I dare say it would have come on\r\nall the same.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip did not like to be forgiven by Mr. Edmonstone, and there was\r\nsomething very annoying in having this mischance connected with his\r\nname, though without his fault; nor did he wish Charles to have the kind\r\nof advantage over him that might be derived from seeming to pass over\r\nhis share in the misfortune.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Hollywell, it was twilight, but no one was in the\r\ndrawing-room, generally so cheerful at that time of day; the fire had\r\nlately been smothered with coals, and looked gloomy and desolate. Mr.\r\nEdmonstone left Philip there, and ran up to see how Charles was, and\r\nsoon after Laura came in, sprang to his side, and held his hand in both\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You bring no good news?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, sadly, as she read the answer in his\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x98O! how I wish you had. It would be such a comfort now. You have\r\nheard about poor Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and very sorry I am. But, Laura, is it really thought that\r\naccident could have occasioned it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Mayerne does not think so, only Mr. Thompson talked of remote\r\ncauses, when Amy mentioned it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it did any harm, and\r\nCharlie himself says you saved him from falling down-stairs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip had begun to give Laura his version of the accident, as he had\r\nalready done to her father, when Mrs. Edmonstone came down, looking\r\nharassed and anxious. She told her nephew that Charles was very desirous\r\nto see him, and sent him up at once.\r\n\r\nThere was a fire in the dressing-room, and the door was open into the\r\nlittle room, which was only lighted by a lamp on a small table, where\r\nAmy was sitting at work. After shaking hands, she went away, leaving him\r\nalone with Charles, who lay in his narrow bed against the wall, fixed\r\nin one position, his forehead contracted with pain, his eyelids red and\r\nheavy from sleeplessness, his eyes very quick and eager, and his hands\r\nand arms thrown restlessly outside the coverings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry to find you here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, coming up to him, and\r\ntaking, rather than receiving, his hot, limp hand. \xe2\x80\x98Is the pain very\r\nbad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is a matter of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, in a sharp, quick manner,\r\nhis voice full of suffering. \xe2\x80\x98I want to hear what you have been doing at\r\nOxford and St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry I do not bring the tidings you wish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not expect you would. I know you too well; but I want to hear\r\nwhat you have been doing--what he said,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Charles, in short,\r\nimpatient sentences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It can be of no use, Charlie. You are not in a state to enter on\r\nagitating subjects.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you I will hear all,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Charles, with increased asperity.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know you will say nothing to his advantage that you can help, but\r\nstill I know you will speak what you think the truth, and I want to\r\njudge for myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You speak as if I was not acting for his good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Palaver!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles, fully sensible of the advantage his illness\r\ngave him. \xe2\x80\x98I want the facts. Begin at the beginning. Sit down--there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nchair by you. Now tell me, where did you find him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip could not set Charles down in his present state, and was obliged\r\nto submit to a cross-examination, in which he showed no abatement of his\r\nnatural acuteness, and, unsparing as he always was, laid himself under\r\nno restraint at all. Philip was compelled to give a full history of his\r\nresearches; and if he had afforded no triumph to Guy, Charles revenged\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, what did Guy say when he heard the result of this fine voyage of\r\ndiscovery?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not see him again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not see him! not tell him he was so far justified!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had no time--at least I thought not. It would have been useless, for\r\nwhile these mysteries continue, my opinion is unchanged, and there was\r\nno benefit in renewing vain disputes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles. \xe2\x80\x98You have said all I expected, and\r\nmore too. I gave you credit for domineering and prejudice, now I see it\r\nis malignity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Laura entered from the dressing-room, and stood aghast at\r\nthe words, and then looked imploringly at her cousin. Dr. Mayerne was\r\nfollowing her, and Charles called out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, doctor, give me as much opium as you please. I only want to be\r\nstupefied till the world has turned round, and then you may wake me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip shook hands with Dr. Mayerne, and, without betraying a shade\r\nof annoyance, wished Charles good night; but Charles had drawn the\r\ncoverings over his head, and would not hear him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip to Laura, when they were out of the room. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nis a very generous partisan, and excitement and suffering make him carry\r\nhis zeal to excess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew you could not be angry with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not be angry at this time at far more provocation given by any\r\none belonging to you, Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s heart had that sensation which the French call \xe2\x80\x9cse serrer\xe2\x80\x9d, as\r\nshe heard him allude to the long separation to which there seemed no\r\nlimit; but they could say no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, when she returned to him after dinner, \xe2\x80\x98I am more\r\nthan ever convinced that things will right themselves. I never saw\r\nprejudice more at fault.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he tell you all about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I worked out of him all I could, and it is my belief Guy had the best\r\nof it. I only wonder he did not horsewhip Philip round the quadrangle. I\r\nwish he had.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no, no! But he controlled himself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he had not we should have heard of it fast enough;\xe2\x80\x99 and Charles told\r\nwhat he had been able to gather, while she sat divided between joy and\r\npain.\r\n\r\nPhilip saw very little more of Charles. He used to come to ask him how\r\nhe was once a day, but never received any encouragement to lengthen his\r\nvisit. These gatherings in the diseased joint were always excessively\r\npainful, and were very long in coming to the worst, as well as\r\nafterwards in healing; and through the week of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s stay at\r\nHollywell, Charles was either in a state of great suffering, or else\r\nheavy and confused with opiates. His mother\xe2\x80\x99s whole time and thoughts\r\nwere absorbed in him; she attended to him day and night, and could\r\nhardly spare a moment for anything else. Indeed, with all her affection\r\nand anxiety for the young lovers, Charles was so entirely her engrossing\r\nobject, that her first feeling of disappointment at the failure of\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s journey of investigation was because it would grieve Charlie.\r\nShe could not think about Guy just then, and for Amy there was nothing\r\nfor it but patience; and, good little creature, it was very nice to\r\nsee her put her own troubles aside, and be so cheerful a nurse to her\r\nbrother. She was almost always in his room, for he liked to have her\r\nthere, and she could not conquer a certain shrinking from Philip.\r\n\r\nLaura had once pleaded hard and earnestly for Guy with Philip, but\r\nall in vain; she was only taught to think the case more hopeless than\r\nbefore. Laura was a very kind nurse and sister, but she could better be\r\nspared than her mother and Amy, so that it generally fell to her lot to\r\nbe down-stairs, making the drawing-room habitable. Dr. Mayerne, whenever\r\nCharles was ill, used to be more at Hollywell than at his own house, and\r\nthere were few days that he did not dine there. When Amy was out of the\r\nway, Philip used to entertain them with long accounts of Redclyffe, how\r\nfine a place it was, how far the estate reached on the Moorworth road,\r\nof its capacities for improvement, wastes of moorland to be enclosed or\r\nplanted, magnificent timber needing nothing but thinning. He spoke of\r\nthe number of tenantry, and the manorial rights, and the influence in\r\nboth town and county, which, in years gone by, had been proved to the\r\nutmost in many a fierce struggle with the house of Thorndale. Sir Guy\r\nMorville might be one of the first men in England if he were not wanting\r\nto himself. Mr. Edmonstone enjoyed such talk, for it made him revel in\r\nthe sense of his own magnanimity in refusing his daughter to the owner\r\nof all this; and Laura sometimes thought how Philip would have graced\r\nsuch a position, yet how much greater it was to rest entirely on his own\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, my fine fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Dr. Mayerne to himself one day, when\r\nPhilip and his uncle had left the room, just after a discourse of this\r\nkind, \xe2\x80\x98I see you have not forgotten you are the next heir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n Laura coloured with indignation, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 then checked\r\nherself, as if such an aspersion was not worthy of her taking the\r\ntrouble to refute it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! Miss Edmonstone, I did not know you were there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you were talking to yourself, just as if you were at home,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharlotte, who was specially pert to the old doctor, because she knew\r\nherself to be a great pet. \xe2\x80\x98You were telling some home truths to make\r\nLaura angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, he would make a very good use of it if he had it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you\xe2\x80\x99ll make me angry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x98and you have not mended\r\nmatters with Laura. She thinks nothing short of four-syllabled words\r\ngood enough for Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! nonsense, Charlotte!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, much annoyed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There Charlotte, she is avenging herself on you because she can\xe2\x80\x99t scold\r\nme\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, pretending to whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte is only growing more wild than ever for want of mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura, trying to laugh it off, but there was so much annoyance evident\r\nabout her, that Dr. Mayerne said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seriously, I must apologize for my unlucky soliloquy; not that I\r\nthought I was saying much harm, for I did not by any means say or\r\nthink the Captain wished Sir Guy any ill, and few men who stood next in\r\nsuccession to such a property would be likely to forget it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but Philip is not like other men,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, who, at\r\nfourteen, had caught much of her brother\xe2\x80\x99s power of repartee, and could\r\nbe quite as provoking, when unrestrained by any one whom she cared to\r\nobey.\r\n\r\nLaura felt it was more for her dignity not to notice this, and replied,\r\nwith an effort for a laugh,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must be your guilty conscience that sets you apologizing, for you\r\nsaid no harm, as you observe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dr. Mayerne, good-humouredly. \xe2\x80\x98He does very well without it,\r\nand no doubt he would be one of the first men in the country if he had\r\nit; but it is in very good hands now, on the whole. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, even\r\nif the lad has been tempted into a little folly just now, that he can\r\never go very far wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x98but Charlie and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he has\r\ndone anything wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a little surly decided tone, as if her opinion put an end\r\nto the matter, and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s return closed the discussion.\r\n\r\nDivided as the party were between up-stairs and down-stairs, and in\r\nthe absence of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s shrewd observation, Philip and Laura had more\r\nopportunity of intercourse than usual, and now that his departure would\r\nput an end to suspicion, they ventured on more openly seeking each\r\nother. It never could be the perfect freedom that they had enjoyed\r\nbefore the avowal of their sentiments, but they had many brief\r\nconversations, giving Laura feverish, but exquisite, delight at each\r\nrenewal of his rare expressions of tenderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What are you going to do to-day?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, on the last morning before\r\nhe was to leave Hollywell. \xe2\x80\x98I must see you alone before I go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked down, and he kept his eyes fixed on her rather sternly, for\r\nhe had never before made a clandestine appointment, and he did not like\r\nfeeling ashamed of it. At last she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I go to East-hill School this afternoon. I shall come away at half-past\r\nthree.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary Ross was still absent; her six nephews and nieces having taken\r\nadvantage of her visit to have the measles, not like reasonable\r\nchildren, all at once, so as to be one trouble, but one after the other,\r\nso as to keep Aunt Mary with them as long as possible; and Mr. Ross did\r\nnot know what would have become of the female department of his parish\r\nbut for Laura, who worked at school-keeping indefatigably.\r\n\r\nLaura had some difficulty in shaking off Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s company this\r\nafternoon, and was obliged to make the most of the probability of rain,\r\nand the dreadful dirt of the roads. Indeed, she represented it as so\r\nformidable, that Mrs. Edmonstone, who had hardly time to look out of\r\nwindow, much less to go out of doors, strongly advised her to stay\r\nat home herself; and Charlotte grew all the more eager for the fun.\r\nLuckily, however, for Laura, Dr. Mayerne came in, laughing at the\r\nreports of the weather; and as he was wanted to prescribe for a poor\r\nold man in an opposite direction, he took Charlotte with him to show the\r\nway, and she was much better pleased to have him for a companion than\r\nthe grave Laura.\r\n\r\nPhilip, in the meantime, had walked all the way to Broadstone, timing\r\nhis return exactly, that he might meet Laura as she came out of the\r\nschool, and feel as if it had been by chance. It was a gray, misty\r\nNovember day, and the leaves of the elm-trees came floating round them,\r\nyellow and damp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had a wet walk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, as they met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not quite raining,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered; and they proceeded for some\r\nminutes in silence, until he said,--\xe2\x80\x98It is time we should come to an\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in alarm, and his voice was immediately gentler;\r\nindeed, at times it was almost inaudible from his strong emotion. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nbelieve that no affection has ever been stronger or truer than ours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has been!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Laura, in a wondering, bewildered voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is, if you are satisfied to leave things as they are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must be, if you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not say I am satisfied with what must be, as I am situated; but\r\nI felt it due to you to set the true state of the case before you. Few\r\nwould venture their love as I do mine with you, bound in reality, though\r\nnot formally, with no promise sought or given; yet I am not more assured\r\nthat I stand here than I am that our love is for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure it is!\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated fervently. \xe2\x80\x98O Philip, there never was a\r\ntime I did not love you: and since that day on Ashen Down, I have loved\r\nyou with my whole heart. I am sometimes afraid it has left no proper\r\nroom for the rest, when I find how much more I think of your going away\r\nthan of poor Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98you have understood me as none but you would have done,\r\nthrough coldness and reserve, apparently, even towards yourself, and\r\nwhen to others I have seemed grave and severe beyond my years. You have\r\nnever doubted, you have recognized the warmth within; you have trusted\r\nyour happiness to me, and it shall be safe in my keeping, for, Laura, it\r\nis all mine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is only one thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, timidly; \xe2\x80\x98would it not be better\r\nif mamma knew?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, I have considered that, but remember you are not bound; I have\r\nnever asked you to bind yourself. You might marry to-morrow, and I\r\nshould have no right to complain. There is nothing to prevent you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, as if with pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered; \xe2\x80\x98you could not, and that certainty suffices me. I\r\nask no more without your parents\xe2\x80\x99 consent; but it would be giving them\r\nand you useless distress and perplexity to ask it now. They would object\r\nto my poverty, and we should gain nothing; for I would never be so\r\nselfish as to wish to expose you to such a life as that of the wife of a\r\npoor officer; and an open engagement could not add to our confidence\r\nin each other. We must be content to wait for my promotion. By that\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x99--he smiled gravely--\xe2\x80\x98our attachment will have lasted so many years\r\nas to give it a claim to respect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is no new thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No newer than our lives; but remember, my Laura, that you are but\r\ntwenty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have made me feel much older,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Laura, \xe2\x80\x98not that I would be a\r\nthoughtless child again. That cannot last long, not even for poor little\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one would wish to part with the deeper feelings of elder years\r\nto regain the carelessness of childhood, even to be exempted from the\r\nsuffering that has brought them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For instance, these two years have scarcely been a time of great\r\nhappiness to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sometimes,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Laura, \xe2\x80\x98sometimes beyond all words, but often\r\ndreary and oppressive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven knows how unwillingly I have rendered it so. Rather than dim the\r\nbrightness of your life, I would have repressed my own sentiments for\r\never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, then, where would have been my brightness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would, I say, but for a peril to you. I see my fears were unfounded.\r\nYou were safe; but in my desire to guard you from what has come on poor\r\nAmy, my feelings, though not wont to overpower me, carried me further\r\nthan I intended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did they?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do not suppose I regret it. No, no, Laura; those were the most precious\r\nmoments in my life, when I drew from you those words and looks which\r\nhave been blessed in remembrance ever since; and doubly, knowing, as I\r\ndo, that you also prize that day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes;--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In the midst of much that was adverse, and with a necessity for a trust\r\nand self-control of which scarce a woman but yourself would have been\r\ncapable, you have endured nobly--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could bear anything, if you were not going so far away,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will bear that too, Laura, and bravely. It will not be for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long do you think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell. Several years may pass before I have my promotion. It\r\nmay be that I shall not see that cheek in its fresh bloom again, but I\r\nshall find the same Laura that I left, the same in love, and strength,\r\nand trust.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah; I shall grow faded and gray, and you will be a sun-burnt old\r\nsoldier,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, smiling, and looking, half sadly, half proudly, up\r\nto his noble features; \xe2\x80\x98but hearts don\xe2\x80\x99t change like faces!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter they came near the house, they walked up and down the lane for a\r\nlong time, for Philip avoided a less public path, in order to keep up\r\nhis delusion that he was doing nothing in an underhand way. It grew\r\ndark, and the fog thickened, straightening Laura\xe2\x80\x99s auburn ringlets, and\r\nhanging in dew-drops on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s rough coat, but little recked they; it\r\nwas such an hour as they had never enjoyed before. Philip had never\r\nso laid himself open, or assured her so earnestly of the force of his\r\naffection; and her thrills of ecstasy overcame the desolate expectation\r\nof his departure, and made her sensible of strength to bear seven, ten,\r\ntwenty years of loneliness and apparent neglect. She knew him, and he\r\nwould never fail her.\r\n\r\nYet, when at last they went in-doors, and Amy followed her to her room,\r\nwondering to find her so wet, and so late, who could have seen the two\r\nsisters without reading greater peace and serenity in the face of the\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\nPhilip felt an elder brother\xe2\x80\x99s interest for poor little Amy. He did not\r\nsee much of her; but he compassionated her as a victim to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimprudence, hoping she would soon be weaned from her attachment. He\r\nthought her a good, patient little thing, so soft and gentle as probably\r\nnot to have the strength and depth that would make the love incurable;\r\nand the better he liked her, the more unfit he thought her for Guy. It\r\nwould have been uniting a dove and a tiger; and his only fear was, that\r\nwhen he was no longer at hand, Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s weak good-nature might\r\nbe prevailed on to sacrifice her. He did his best for her protection, by\r\nmaking his uncle express a resolution never to admit Guy into his family\r\nagain, unless the accusation of gambling was completely disproved.\r\n\r\nThe last morning came, and Philip went to take leave of Charles. Poor\r\nCharles was feebler by this time, and too much subdued by pain and\r\nlanguor to receive him as at first, but the spirit was the same; and\r\nwhen Philip wished him good-bye, saying he hoped soon to hear he was\r\nbetter, he returned for answer,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Philip, I hope soon to hear you are better. I had rather have\r\nmy hip than your mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was in no condition to be answered, and Philip repeated his good-bye,\r\nlittle thinking how they were to meet again.\r\n\r\nThe others were assembled in the hall. His aunt\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were full of\r\ntears, for she loved him dearly, her brother\xe2\x80\x99s only son, early left\r\nmotherless, whom she had regarded like her own child, and who had so\r\nnobly fulfilled all the fondest hopes. All his overbearing ways and\r\nuncalled-for interference were forgotten, and her voice gave way as she\r\nembraced him, saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless you, Philip, wherever you may be. We shall miss you very\r\nmuch!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLittle Amy\xe2\x80\x99s hand was put into his, and he squeezed it kindly; but she\r\ncould hardly speak her \xe2\x80\x98good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 for the tears that came, because she\r\nwas grieved not to feel more sorry that her highly-esteemed cousin, so\r\nkind and condescending to her, was going away for so very long a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x98I shall be quite grown up by the\r\ntime you come home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t make such uncivil auguries, Puss,\xe2\x80\x99 said her father; but Philip\r\nheard her not, for he was holding Laura\xe2\x80\x99s hand in a grasp that seemed as\r\nif it never would unclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21\r\n\r\n     I will sing, for I am sad,\r\n     For many my misdeeds;\r\n     It is my sadness makes me glad,\r\n     For love for sorrow pleads.\r\n                          --WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his last interview with Philip, Guy returned to his rooms to force\r\nhimself into occupation till his cousin should come to acknowledge that\r\nhere, at least, there was nothing amiss. He trusted that when it was\r\nproved all was right in this quarter, the prejudice with regard to the\r\nother might be diminished, though his hopes were lower since he had\r\nfound out the real grounds of the accusation, reflecting that he should\r\nnever be able to explain without betraying his uncle.\r\n\r\nHe waited in vain. The hour passed at which Philip\xe2\x80\x99s coming was\r\npossible; Guy was disappointed, but looked for a letter; but post after\r\npost failed to bring him one. Perhaps Philip would write from Hollywell,\r\nor else Mr. Edmonstone would write, or at least he was sure that Charles\r\nwould write--Charles, whose confidence and sympathy, expressed in almost\r\ndaily letters, had been such a comfort. But not a line came. He reviewed\r\nin memory his last letter to Charles, wondering whether it could have\r\noffended him; but it did not seem possible; he thought over all that\r\nPhilip could have learnt in his visit, to see if it could by any means\r\nhave been turned to his disadvantage. But he knew he had done nothing\r\nto which blame could be attached; he had never infringed the rules\r\nof college discipline; and though still backward, and unlikely to\r\ndistinguish himself, he believed that was the worst likely to have been\r\nsaid of him. He only wished his true character was as good as what would\r\nbe reported of him.\r\n\r\nAs he thought and wondered, he grew more and more restless and unhappy.\r\nHe could imagine no reason for the silence, unless Mr. Edmonstone had\r\nabsolutely forbidden any intercourse, and it did not seem probable that\r\nhe would issue any commands in a manner to bind a grown-up son, more\r\nespecially as there had been no attempt at communication with Amy. It\r\nwas terrible thus, without warning, to be cut off from her, and all\r\nbesides that he loved. As long as Charles wrote, he fancied her sitting\r\nby, perhaps sealing the letter, and he could even tell by the kind of\r\npaper and envelope, whether they were sitting in the dressing-room or\r\ndown-stairs; but now there was nothing, no assurance of sympathy, no\r\nword of kindness; they might all have given him up; those unhappy words\r\nwere like a barrier, cutting him off for ever from the happiness of\r\nwhich he had once had a glimpse. Was the Redclyffe doom of sin and\r\nsorrow really closing in upon him?\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for chapel and study, he hardly knew how he should\r\nhave got through that term; but as the end of it approached, a feverish\r\nimpatience seized on him whenever the post came in, for a letter, if\r\nonly to tell him not to come to Hollywell. None came, and he saw nothing\r\nfor it but to go to Redclyffe; and if he dreaded seeing it in its\r\naltered state when his spirits were high and unbroken, how did he shrink\r\nfrom it now! He did, however, make up his mind, for he felt that his\r\nreluctance almost wronged his own beloved home. Harry Graham wanted to\r\npersuade him to come and spend Christmas at his home, with his lively\r\nfamily, but Guy felt as if gaiety was not for him, even if he could\r\nenjoy it. He did not wish to drown his present feelings, and steadily,\r\nthough gratefully, refused this as well as one or two other friendly\r\ninvitations.\r\n\r\nAfter lingering in vain till the last day of term, he wrote to desire\r\nthat his own room and the library might be made ready for him, and that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98something\xe2\x80\x99 might be sent to meet him at Moorworth.\r\n\r\nRailroads had come a step nearer, even to his remote corner of the world,\r\nin the course of the last three years; but there was still thirty miles\r\nof coach beyond, and these lay through a part of the country he had\r\nnever seen before. It was for the most part bleak, dreary moor, such as,\r\nunder the cold gray wintry sky, presented nothing to rouse him from his\r\nmusings on the welcome he might have been at that very moment receiving\r\nat Hollywell.\r\n\r\nA sudden, dip in the high ground made it necessary for the coach to\r\nput on the drag, and thus it slowly entered a village, which attracted\r\nattention from its wretched appearance. The cottages, of the rough stone\r\nof the country, were little better than hovels; slates were torn off,\r\nwindows broken. Wild-looking uncombed women, in garments of universal\r\ndirt colour, stood at the doors; ragged children ran and shrieked after\r\nthe coach, the church had a hole in the roof, and stood tottering in\r\nspite of rude repairs; the churchyard was trodden down by cattle, and\r\nthe whole place only resembled the pictures of Irish dilapidation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What miserable place is this?\xe2\x80\x99 asked a passenger. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what all\r\ngentlemen ask,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the coachman; \xe2\x80\x98and well you may. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\nmore noted place for thieves and vagabonds. They call it Coombe Prior.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy well knew the name, though he had never been there. It was a distant\r\noffset of his own property, and a horrible sense of responsibility for\r\nall the crime and misery there came over him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there no one to look; after it?\xe2\x80\x99 continued the traveller. \xe2\x80\x98No\r\nsquire, no clergyman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fox-hunting parson,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the coachman; \xe2\x80\x98who lives half-a-dozen\r\nmiles off, and gallops over for the service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy knew that the last presentation had been sold in the days of his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance, and beheld another effect of ancestral sin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know who is the owner of the place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir; \xe2\x80\x98tis Sir Guy Morville. You have heard tell of the old Sir Guy\r\nMorville, for he made a deal of noise in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! The noted--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I ought not to allow you to finish your sentence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, very\r\ncourteously, \xe2\x80\x98without telling you that I am his grandson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the traveller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, with a smile; \xe2\x80\x98I only thought it was fair to tell you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy himself!\xe2\x80\x99 said the coachman, turning round, and touching his\r\nhat, anxious to do the honours of his coach. \xe2\x80\x98I have not seen you on\r\nthis road before, sir, for I never forget a face; I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll often be\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a few more civilities, Guy was at liberty to attend to the fresh\r\ninflux of sad musings on thoughtless waste affecting not only the\r\ndestiny of the individual himself, but whole generations besides. How\r\nmany souls might it not have ruined? \xe2\x80\x98These sheep, what had they done!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHis grandfather had repented, but who was to preach repentance unto\r\nthese? He did not wonder now that his own hopes of happiness had been\r\nblighted; he only marvelled that a bright present or future had ever\r\nbeen his--\r\n\r\n\r\n        While souls were wandering far and wide,\r\n        And curses swarmed on every side.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe traveller was, meanwhile, observing the heir of Redclyffe, possessor\r\nof wealth and wide lands. Little did he guess how that bright-eyed youth\r\nlooked upon his riches.\r\n\r\nMiles were passed in one long melancholy musing, till Guy was roused by\r\nthe sight of familiar scenes, and found himself rattling over the stones\r\nof the little borough of Moorworth, with the gray, large-windowed,\r\nold-fashioned houses, on each side, looking at him with friendly eyes.\r\nThere, behind those limes cut out in arches, was the commercial school,\r\nwhere he had spent many an hour in construing with patient Mr. Potts;\r\nand though he had now a juster appreciation of his old master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nerudition, which he had once thought so vast, he recollected with\r\nveneration his long and patient submission to an irksome, uncongenial\r\nlife. Rumbling on, the coach was in the square market-place, the\r\nodd-looking octagon market-house in the middle, and the inn--the\r\nrespectable old \xe2\x80\x98George\xe2\x80\x99--with its long rank of stables and\r\nout-buildings forming one side. It was at this inn that Guy had been\r\nborn, and the mistress having been the first person who had him in her\r\narms, considered herself privileged to have a great affection for him,\r\nand had delighted in the greetings he always exchanged with her when he\r\nput up his pony at her stable, and went to his tutor.\r\n\r\nThere was a certainty of welcome here that cheered him, as he swung\r\nhimself from the roof of the coach, lifted Bustle down, and called out\r\nto the barmaid that he hoped Mrs. Lavers was well.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Mrs. Lavers was at the door herself, with her broad,\r\ngood-humoured face, close cap, bright shawl, and black gown, just as Guy\r\nalways recollected, and might, if he could, have recollected, when he\r\nwas born. If she had any more guests she neither saw nor cared for\r\nthem; her welcome was all for him; and he could not but smile and look\r\ncheerful, if only that he might not disappoint her, feeling, in very\r\ntruth, cheered and gratified by her cordiality. If he was in a hurry,\r\nhe would not show it; and he allowed her to seat him in her own peculiar\r\nabode, behind the glass-cases of tongue and cold chicken, told her he\r\ncame from Oxford, admired her good fire, and warmed his hands over it,\r\nbefore he even asked if the \xe2\x80\x98something\xe2\x80\x99 had arrived which was to take\r\nhim home. It was coming to the door at the moment, and proved to be Mr.\r\nMarkham\xe2\x80\x99s tall, high-wheeled gig, drawn by the old white-faced chestnut,\r\nand driven by Markham himself--a short, sturdy, brown-red, honest-faced\r\nold man, with frosted hair and whiskers, an air more of a yeoman than\r\nof a lawyer; and though not precisely gentlemanlike, yet not\r\nungentlemanlike, as there was no pretension about him.\r\n\r\nGuy darted out to meet him, and was warmly shaken by the hand, though\r\nthe meeting was gruff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So, Sir Guy! how d\xe2\x80\x99ye do? I wonder what brings you here on such short\r\nnotice? Good morning, Mrs. Lavers. Bad roads this winter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Mr. Markham. It is a treat, indeed, to have Sir Guy here\r\nonce more; so grown, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grown--hum!\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham, surveying him; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it. He\xe2\x80\x99ll never\r\nbe as tall as his father. Have you got your things, Sir Guy? Ay, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe way,--care for nothing but the dog. Gone on by the coach, most\r\nlikely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey might have been, for aught Guy knew to the contrary, but Boots had\r\nbeen more attentive, and they were right. Mrs. Lavers begged he would\r\nwalk in, and warm himself; but Markham answered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say, Sir Guy? The road is shocking, and it will be as dark\r\nas a pit by the time we get home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well; we won\xe2\x80\x99t keep old Whiteface standing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\r\nMrs. Lavers thank you. I shall see you again before long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Markham had finished a short private growl on the shocking state\r\nof the Moorworth pavement, and a protest that somebody should be called\r\nover the coals, Guy began,--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a horrible place Coombe Prior is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only know I wish you had more such tenants as Todd,\xe2\x80\x99 was Markham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanswer. \xe2\x80\x98Pays his rent to a day, and improves his land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what sort of man is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A capital farmer. A regular screw, I believe; but that is no concern of\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are all the cottages tumbling down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay? Are they? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder, for they are all in his lease; and he\r\nwould not lay out an unproductive farthing. And a precious bad lot they\r\nare there, too! There were actually three of them poaching in Cliffstone\r\nhanger this autumn; but we have them in jail. A pretty pass of impudence\r\nto be coming that distance to poach.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy used to be kindled into great wrath by the most distant hint of\r\npoachers; but now he cared for men, not for game; and instead of asking,\r\nas Markham expected, the particulars of their apprehension, continued--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The clergyman is that Halroyd, is he not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; every one knows what he is. I declare it went against me to take\r\nhis offer for the living; but it could not be helped. Money must be had;\r\nbut there! least said, soonest mended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must mend it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, so decidedly, that Markham looked at him\r\nwith surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done till Halroyd dies; and then you may give\r\nthe living to whom you please. He lives so hard he can\xe2\x80\x99t last long, that\r\nis one comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy sighed and pondered; and presently Markham resumed the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what has brought you home at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice? You might as well\r\nhave written two or three days before, at least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was waiting in hopes of going to Hollywell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, and what is the matter? You have not been quarrelling with your\r\nguardian, I hope and trust! Going the old way, after all!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed\r\nMarkham, not in his usual gruff, grumbling note, but with real anxiety,\r\nand almost mournfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He took up some unjust suspicion of me. I could not bear it patiently,\r\nand said something that has offended him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Sir Guy! hot and fiery as ever. I always told you that hasty temper\r\nwould be the ruin of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Too true!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, so dejectedly, that the old man instantly grew\r\nkinder, and was displeased with Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What could he have taken into his head to suspect you of?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of gaming at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why does not he believe you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He thinks he has proof against me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess how he discovered it;\r\nbut I was obliged to pay some money to a gambling sort of man, and he\r\nthinks I lost it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you show him your accounts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For one reason--because I have kept none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs if it was an immense relief to his mind, Markham launched out into a\r\ndiscourse on the extreme folly, imprudence, and all other evils of\r\nsuch carelessness. He was so glad to find this was the worst, that\r\nhis lecture lasted for two miles and a half, during which Guy, though\r\nattentive at first, had ample space for all the thrills of recognition\r\nat each well-known spot.\r\n\r\nThere was the long green-wooded valley between the hills where he had\r\nshot his first woodcock; there was the great stone on which he had\r\nbroken his best knife in a fit of geological research; there was the\r\npool where he used to skate; there the sudden break in the lulls that\r\ngave the first view of the sea. He could not help springing up at the\r\nsight--pale, leaden, and misty as it was; and though Markham forthwith\r\nrebuked him for not listening, his heart was still beating as at the\r\nfirst sight of a dear old friend, when that peep was far behind. More\r\nblack heaths, with stacks of peat and withered ferns. Guy was straining\r\nhis eyes far off in the darkness to look for the smoke of the old\r\nkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s cottage chimney, and could with difficulty refrain from\r\ninterrupting Markham to ask after the old man.\r\n\r\nAnother long hill, and then began a descent into a rich valley,\r\nbeautiful fields of young wheat, reddish soil, full of fatness, large\r\nspreading trees with noble limbs, cottages, and cottage gardens, very\r\nunlike poor Coombe Prior; Markham\xe2\x80\x99s house--a perfect little snuggery\r\ncovered all over with choice climbing plants, the smart plastered\r\ndoctor\xe2\x80\x99s house, the Morville Arms, looking honest and venerable, the\r\nchurch, with its disproportionately high tower, the parsonage rather\r\nhidden behind it; and, on the opposite side of the road, the park-wall\r\nand the gate, where old Sarah stood, in an ecstasy of curtsies.\r\n\r\nGuy jumped out to meet her, and to spare Whiteface; for there was a\r\nsharp, steep bit of hill, rising from the lodge, trying to horses, in\r\nspite of the road being cut out in long spirals. On he ran, leaving the\r\nroad to Markham, straight up the high, steep, slippery green slope. He\r\ncame in sight at the great dark-red sandstone pile of building; but he\r\npassed it, and ran on to where the ground rose on one side of it still\r\nmore abruptly, and at the highest point was suddenly broken away and cut\r\noff into a perpendicular crag, descending in some parts sheer down to\r\nthe sea, in others a little broken, and giving space for the growth of\r\nstunted brushwood. He stood at the highest point, where the precipice\r\nwas most abrupt. The sea was dashing far beneath; the ripple, dash, and\r\nroar were in his ears once more; the wind--such wind as only blows over\r\nthe sea--was breathing on his face; the broad, free horizon far before\r\nhim; the field of waves, in gray and brown shade indeed, but still his\r\nown beloved waves; the bay, shut in with rocks, and with Black Shag\r\nIsland and its train of rocks projecting far out to the west, and almost\r\nimmediately beneath him, to the left, the little steep street of the\r\nfishing part of the village, nestled into the cove, which was formed\r\nby the mouth of a little mountain-stream, and the dozen boats it could\r\nmuster rocking on the water.\r\n\r\nGuy stood and looked as if he could never cease looking, or enjoying the\r\nsea air and salt breeze. It was real pleasure at first, for there were\r\nhis home, his friends, and though there was a throb and tightness of\r\nheart at thinking how all was changed but such as this, and how all must\r\nchange; how he had talked with Amy of this very thing, and had longed to\r\nhave her standing beside him there; yet there was more of soothing than\r\nsuffering in the sensation.\r\n\r\nSo many thoughts rushed through his mind, that he fancied he had stood\r\nthere a long time, when he turned and hastened down again, but he had\r\nbeen so rapid as to meet Markham before the servants had had time to\r\nmiss him.\r\n\r\nThe servants were indeed few. There was, alas! William of Deloraine,\r\nwaiting to hold Whiteface; there was Arnaud, an old Swiss, first courier\r\nand then butler to old Sir Guy; there was Mrs. Drew, the housekeeper,\r\nalso a very old servant; and these were all; but their welcome was of\r\nthe heartiest, in feeling, if not in demonstration as the gig went with\r\nan echoing, thundering sound under the deep archway that led into the\r\npaved quadrangle; round which the house was built, that court where, as\r\nPhilip had truly averred, the sun hardly ever shone, so high were the\r\nwalls on each side.\r\n\r\nUp the stone steps into the spacious dark hall, and into the large,\r\ngloomy library, partially lighted by a great wood fire, replying to Mrs.\r\nDrew\xe2\x80\x99s questions about his dinner and his room, and asking Markham to\r\nstay and dine with him, Guy at length found himself at home, in the\r\nvery room where he had spent every evening of his boyhood, with the same\r\ngreen leather arm-chair, in the very place where his grandfather used to\r\nsit.\r\n\r\nMarkham consented to dine with him, and the evening was spent in talking\r\nover the news of Redclyffe. Markham spoke with much bitterness of the\r\nway in which Captain Morville had taken upon him; his looking into the\r\naccounts, though any one was welcome to examine them, was, he thought,\r\nscarcely becoming in so young a man--the heir-at-law, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t help doing minutely whatever he undertakes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. If you\r\nhad him here, you would never have to scold him like me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham, hastily. \xe2\x80\x98I know the same place would not\r\nhold him and me long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have told me nothing of our new vicar. How do you get on with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None the better for that same Captain Morville,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Markham,\r\nplunging forthwith into his list of grievances, respecting which he was\r\nwaging a petty warfare, in the belief that he was standing up for his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s rights.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard, the former clergyman, had been a quiet, old-fashioned man,\r\nvery kind-hearted, but not at all active, and things had gone on in\r\na sleepy, droning, matter-of-fact way, which Markham being used to,\r\nthought exactly what ought to be. Now, Mr. Ashford was an energetic\r\nperson, desirous to do his utmost for the parish, and whatever he did\r\nwas an offence to Markham, from the daily service, to the objecting to\r\nthe men going out fishing on Sunday. He opposed every innovation with\r\nall his might, and Captain Morville\xe2\x80\x99s interference, which had borne\r\nMarkham down with Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s authority, had only made him more\r\ndetermined not to bate an inch. He growled every time Guy was inclined\r\nto believe Mr. Ashford in the right, and brought out some fresh\r\ncomplaint. The grand controversy was at present about the school.\r\nThere was a dame\xe2\x80\x99s school in the cove or fishing part of the parish,\r\nmaintained at the expense of the estate, in a small cottage far from the\r\nchurch, and Mr. and Mrs. Ashford had fixed their eyes on a house in the\r\nvillage, and so near the church as to be very convenient for a Sunday\r\nSchool. It only wanted to be floored, and to have a partition taken\r\ndown, but to this Markham would not consent, treating it as a monstrous\r\nproposal to take away the school from old Jenny Robinson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose Mr. Ashford meant to pension her off?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He did say something about it; but who is to do it, I should like to\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pay two schoolmistresses mistresses at once! One for doing nothing! A\r\npretty tolerable proposal for Mr. Ashford to be making?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why. Of course it is my business!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that she is not as fit to keep school as ever she\r\nwas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That may well be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98We never used to be noted for\r\nour learning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be for bringing new lights into the parish, Sir Guy, or we\r\nshall never have any more peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall see about old Jenny,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy. \xe2\x80\x98As to the house, that must\r\nbe done directly. Her cottage is not fit to keep school in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrunt, grunt; but though a very unbending viceroy, a must from the\r\nreigning baronet had a potent effect on Markham, whether it was for good\r\nor evil. He might grumble, but he never disobeyed, and the boy he was\r\nused to scold and order had found that Morville intonation of the must,\r\nwhich took away all idea of resistance. He still, however remonstrated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As you please, Sir Guy, but we shall have the deer frightened, and the\r\nplantations cut to pieces, if the boys from the Cove are to be crossing\r\nthe park.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll be answerable for all the damage. If they are once properly spoken\r\nto, they will be on honour to behave well. I have seen a little of what\r\na village school ought to be at East-hill, and I should like to see\r\nRedclyffe like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrunt again; and Guy found that to make Markham amiable, he must inquire\r\nafter all his nephews and nieces.\r\n\r\nAll the evening he had much to occupy him, and the dreaded sense\r\nof solitude and bereavement did not come on till he had parted with\r\nMarkham, and stood alone before the fire in the large, gloomy room,\r\nwhere the light of the lamp seemed absorbed in the darkness of the\r\ndistant corners, and where he had scarcely been since the moment when\r\nhe found his grandfather senseless in that very chair. How different\r\nhad that room once been in his eyes, when his happy spirits defied every\r\nassociation of gloom, and the bookshelves, the carved chairs, the heavy\r\ndark-green curtains and deep windows were connected with merry freaks,\r\nearnest researches, delightful achievements or discoveries! How long ago\r\nthat time seemed! and how changed was he!\r\n\r\nThere was a certain tendency to melancholy in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s mind. High spirits,\r\nprosperity, and self-discipline, had kept it from developing itself\r\nuntil the beginning of his troubles, but since that time it had been\r\ngradually gaining ground, and this was a time of great suffering, as he\r\nstood alone in his forefathers\xe2\x80\x99 house, and felt himself, in his early\r\nyouth, a doomed man, destined to bear the penalty of their crimes in the\r\nruin of his dearest hopes, as if his heirloom of misery had but waited\r\nto seize on him till the very moment when it would give him the most to\r\nendure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But bear it, I must and will!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, lifting his head from the\r\ncarved chimney-piece, where he had been resting it. \xe2\x80\x98I have been in will\r\na murderer myself, and what right have I to repine like the Israelites,\r\nwith their self-justifying proverb? No; let me be thankful that I was\r\nnot given up even then, but have been able to repent, and do a little\r\nbetter next time. It will be a blessing as yet ungranted to any of us,\r\nif indeed I should bear to the full the doom of sorrow, so that it may\r\nbe vouchsafed me only to avoid actual guilt. Yes, Amy, your words are\r\nstill with me--\xe2\x80\x9cSintram conquered his doom,\xe2\x80\x9d--and it was by following\r\ndeath! Welcome, then, whatever may be in store for me, were it even a\r\nlong, cheerless life without you, Amy. There is another world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith the energy of freshened resolution, he lighted his candle, and\r\nwalked, with echoing steps, up the black oak staircase, along the broad\r\ngallery, up another flight, down another passage, to his own room. He\r\nhad expressly written \xe2\x80\x98his own room,\xe2\x80\x99 and confirmed it on his arrival,\r\nor Mrs. Drew would have lodged him as she thought more suitably for the\r\nmaster of the house. Nothing had been done to alter its old familiar\r\naspect, except lighting a fire, which he had never seen there before.\r\nThere were all his boyish treasures, his bows and arrows, his collection\r\nof birds\xe2\x80\x99 wings, his wonderful weapons and contrivances, from his\r\nfire-balloon down to the wren\xe2\x80\x99s-egg, all just as he left them, their\r\ngood condition attesting the care that Mrs. Drew had taken for his sake.\r\n\r\nHe renewed his acquaintance with them with a sort of regretful affection\r\nand superiority; but there was a refreshment in these old memories which\r\naided the new feeling of life imparted to him by his resolution to bear.\r\nNor had he only to bear, he had also to do; and before the late hour at\r\nwhich he fell asleep, he had made up his mind what was the first step\r\nto be taken about Coombe Priory, and had remembered with rejoicing that\r\nwhereas he had regretted leaving the chapel at college which had so\r\ncomforted and helped him, there was now daily service at Redclyffe\r\nChurch. The last thing in his mind, before reflection was lost in sleep,\r\nwas this stanza--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Gales from Heaven, if so He will,\r\n     Sweeter melodies may wake\r\n     On the lowly mountain rill\r\n     Than the meeting waters make.\r\n     Who hath the Father and the Son,\r\n     May be left, but not alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22\r\n\r\n     And when the solemn deep church-bell\r\n     Entreats the soul to pray,\r\n     The midnight phantoms feel the spell,\r\n     The shadows sweep away.\r\n\r\n     Down the broad Vale of Tears afar,\r\n     The spectral camp is fled;\r\n     Faith shineth as a morning star,\r\n     Our ghastly fears are dead.\r\n                           --LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ashford was a connection of Lady Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s, and it was about a\r\nyear since the living of Redclyffe had been presented to him. Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ashford were of course anxious to learn all they could about their\r\nyoung squire, on whom the welfare of the parish depended, even more than\r\nin most cases, as the whole was his property. Their expectations were\r\nnot raised by Mr. Markham\xe2\x80\x99s strenuous opposition to all their projects,\r\nand his constant appeals to the name of \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99; but, on the other\r\nhand, they were pleased by the strong feeling of affection that all the\r\nvillagers manifested for their landlord.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Redclyffe were a primitive race, almost all related\r\nto each other, rough and ignorant, and with a very strong feudal feeling\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 who was king, state, supreme authority, in their eyes;\r\nand Mrs. Ashford further found that \xe2\x80\x98Master Morville,\xe2\x80\x99 as the old women\r\ncalled him in his individual character, was regarded by them with great\r\npersonal affection.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion when Captain Morville came to Redclyffe, and left James\r\nThorndale to spend a couple of hours at the parsonage, they interrogated\r\nthe latter anxiously on his acquaintance with Sir Guy. He had not the\r\nleast idea of creating prejudice, indeed, he liked him as a companion,\r\nbut he saw everything through the medium of his friend, and spoke\r\nsomething to this effect: He was very agreeable; they would like his\r\nmanners; he was tolerably clever, but not to be named in the same day\r\nwith his cousin for abilities, far less in appearance. Very pleasant,\r\ngenerally liked, decidedly a taking man; but there was some cloud over\r\nhim just now--debts, probably. Morville had been obliged to go to Oxford\r\nabout it; but Mr. Thorndale did not profess to understand it, as of\r\ncourse Morville said as little of it as he could. Thereupon all began to\r\nadmire the aforesaid Morville, already known by report, and whose fine\r\ncountenance and sensible conversation confirmed all that had been said\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nAnd as, after his interference, Mr. Markham\xe2\x80\x99s opposition became surly,\r\nas well as sturdy, and Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s name was sure to stand arrayed against\r\nthem whichever way they turned, the younger part of the family learnt to\r\nregard him somewhat in the light of an enemy, and their elders awaited\r\nhis majority with more of fear than of hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Edward Ashford, rushing in, so as to bring the first news\r\nto his mother, who had not been to the early service, \xe2\x80\x98I do believe Sir\r\nGuy is come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy was at church!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Robert, almost at the same moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashford confirmed the intelligence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw him speaking, after church, to some of the old men, so afterwards\r\nI went to ask old John Barton, and found him with tears in his eyes,\r\npositively trembling with delight, for he said he never thought to have\r\nheard his cheery voice again, and that he was coming down by and by to\r\nsee the last letter from Ben, at sea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is very nice! Shall you call?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Even if he is only here for a day or two, it will be better to\r\nhave made the acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Ashford went to the Park at two in the afternoon, and did not return\r\ntill near four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98it is as James Thorndale says, there is something very\r\nprepossessing about him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been there all this time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He was not at home; so I left my card, and was coming away, when I\r\nmet him at the turn leading to the Cove. He need not have seen me unless\r\nhe had liked, but he came up in a good-natured cordial way, and thanked\r\nme for coming to call.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he like his cousin?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least; not nearly so tall or so handsome, but with a very\r\npleasant face, and seeming made up of activity, very slight, as if he\r\nwas all bone and sinew. He said he was going to see the Christmas ox\r\nat the farm, and asked me to come with him. Presently we came to a high\r\ngate, locked up. He was over it in an instant, begged me to wait while\r\nhe ran on to the farm for the key, and was back in a second with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he enter on any of the disputed subjects!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He began himself about the school, saying the house should be altered\r\ndirectly; and talked over the whole matter very satisfactorily;\r\nundertook himself to speak to Jenny Robinson; and was very glad to hear\r\nyou meant her still to keep the infants at the Cove; so I hope that\r\nmatter is in a right train.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Mr. Markham will but let him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, he is king or more here! We met Markham at the farm; and the first\r\nthing, after looking at the cattle, Sir Guy found some planks lying\r\nabout, and said they were the very thing for flooring the school.\r\nMarkham mentioned some barn they were intended for, but Sir Guy said the\r\nschool must be attended to at once, and went with us to look at it. That\r\nwas what kept me so long, measuring and calculating; and I hope it may\r\nbe begun in a week.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is delightful! What more could we wish?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will give trouble in parish matters, and in personal\r\nintercourse he will be sure to be most agreeable. I wish I knew there\r\nwas nothing amiss. It seems strange for him to come here for the\r\nvacation, instead of going to his guardian\xe2\x80\x99s, as usual, and altogether\r\nhe had an air of sadness and depression, not like a youth, especially\r\nsuch an active one. I am afraid something is wrong; those engaging\r\npeople are often unstable. One thing I forgot to tell you. We were\r\nwalking through that belt of trees on the east side of the hill, when\r\nhe suddenly called out to ask how came the old ash-tree to be marked.\r\nMarkham answered in his gruff way, it was not his doing, but the\r\nCaptain\xe2\x80\x99s. He turned crimson, and began some angry exclamation, but as\r\nMarkham was going on to tell something else about it, he stopped him\r\nshort, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Never mind! I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhear any more!\xe2\x80\x99 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he spoke much again till we got into\r\nthe village. I am afraid there is some misunderstanding between the\r\ncousins.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or more likely Mr. Markham is teaching him some jealousy of his heir.\r\nWe could not expect two Captain Morvilles in one family, and I am glad\r\nit is no worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll that the Ashfords further saw of their young baronet made an\r\nimpression in his favour; every difficulty raised by the steward\r\ndisappeared; their plans were forwarded, and they heard of little but\r\nhis good-nature to the poor people; but still they did not know how far\r\nto trust these appearances, and did not yet venture to form an opinion\r\non him, or enter into intimacy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So the singers will not come to us on Christmas Eve, because they say\r\nthey must go to the Park,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward, rather savagely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Ashford, \xe2\x80\x98how forlorn it will be for that\r\npoor youth to spend his Christmas-day alone in that great house. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou think we might ask him to dinner?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Ashford could answer, the boys made such an uproar at the\r\nproposal of bringing a stranger to spoil their Christmas, that their\r\nparents gave up the idea.\r\n\r\nIt was that Christmas-day that Guy especially dreaded, as recalling so\r\nmany contrasts both with those passed here and at Hollywell. Since his\r\nreturn, he had been exerting himself to attend to what he felt to be\r\nhis duty, going about among his people, arranging for their good or\r\npleasure, and spending a good deal of time over his studies. He had\r\nwritten to Mr. Ross, to ask his advice about Coombe Prior, and had set\r\nMarkham, much against his will, to remonstrate with Farmer Todd about\r\nthe repairs; but though there was a sort of satisfaction in doing these\r\nthings--though the attachment of his dependants soothed him, and brought\r\na new sense of the relation between himself and them--though views\r\nof usefulness were on each side opening before him--yet there was a\r\ndreariness about everything; he was weary even while he undertook and\r\nplanned energetically; each new project reminding him that there was no\r\nAmy to plan with him. He could not sufficiently care for them.\r\n\r\nStill more dreary was his return to his old haunts, and to the scenery\r\nwhich he loved so devotedly--the blue sea and purple hills, which had\r\nbeen like comrades and playfellows, before he had known what it was to\r\nhave living companions. They used to be everything to him, and he\r\nhad scarcely a wish beyond; afterwards his dreams had been of longing\r\naffection for them, and latterly the idea of seeing Amy love them and\r\nadmire them had been connected with every vision of them; and now the\r\nsight of the reality did but recall the sense that their charm had\r\ndeparted; they could no longer suffice to him as of old; and their\r\npresence brought back to him, with fresh pangs of disappointment,\r\nthe thought of lost happiness and ruined hopes, as if Amy alone could\r\nrestore their value.\r\n\r\nThe depression of his spirits inclined him to dwell at present more\r\non the melancholy history of his parents than on anything else. He had\r\nhitherto only heard the brief narration of his grandfather, when he\r\ncould ask no questions; but he now obtained full particulars from\r\nMarkham, who, when he found him bent on hearing all, related everything,\r\nperhaps intending it as a warning against the passions which, when\r\nonce called into force, he dreaded to find equally ungovernable in his\r\npresent master.\r\n\r\nMr. Morville had been his great pride and glory, and, in fact, had been\r\nso left to his care, as to have been regarded like a son of his own. He\r\nhad loved him, if possible, better than Guy, because he had been more\r\nhis own; he had chosen his school, and given him all the reproofs which\r\nhad ever been bestowed on him with his good in view, and how he had\r\ngrieved for him was never known to man. It was the first time he had\r\never talked it over, and he described, with strong, deep feeling, the\r\nnoble face and bearing of the dark-eyed, gallant-looking stripling, his\r\ngenerosity and high spirit tainted and ruined by his wild temper and\r\nimpatience of restraint. There seemed to have been a great sweetness of\r\ndisposition, excellent impulses, and so strong a love of his father, in\r\nspite of early neglect and present resentment, as showed what he might\r\nhave been with only tolerable training, which gave Guy\xe2\x80\x99s idea of him\r\nmore individuality than it had ever had before, and made him better\r\nunderstand what his unhappy grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s remorse had been. Guy doubted\r\nfor a moment whether it had not been selfish to make Markham narrate the\r\nhistory of the time when he had suffered so much; and Markham, when he\r\nhad been led into telling it, and saw the deepening sadness on his young\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s countenance, wished it had not been told, and ended by saying\r\nit was of no use to stir up what was better forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe would have regretted the telling it still more if he had known how\r\nGuy acted it all over in his solitude; picturing his father standing an\r\noutcast at the door of his own home, yielding his pride and resentment\r\nfor the sake of his wife, ready to do anything, yearning for\r\nreconciliation, longing to tread once more the friendly, familiar hall,\r\nand meeting only the angry repulse and cruel taunt! He imagined\r\nthe headlong passion, the despair, the dashing on his horse in\r\nwhirlwind-like swiftness, then the blow--the fall--the awful stillness\r\nof the form carried back to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, and laid on that table\r\na dead man! Fierce wrath--then another world! Guy worked himself up in\r\nimagining the horror of the scene, till it was almost as if he had been\r\nan actor in it.\r\n\r\nYet he had never cared so much for the thought of his father as for\r\nhis mother. His yearning for her which he had felt in early days at\r\nHollywell, had returned in double force, as he now fancied that she\r\nwould have been here to comfort him, and to share his grief, to be a\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, whose love no fault and no offence could ever cancel.\r\n\r\nHe rode to Moorworth, and made Mrs. Lavers tell him all she remembered.\r\nShe was nothing loath, and related how she had been surprised by Mr.\r\nMorville arriving with his fair, shrinking young wife, and how she had\r\nrejoiced in his coming home again. She described Mrs. Morville with\r\nbeautiful blue eyes and flaxen hair, looking pale and delicate, and with\r\nclinging caressing ways like a little child afraid to be left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Lavers, wiping her eyes; \xe2\x80\x98when he was going, she\r\nclung about him, and cried, and was so timid about being left, that at\r\nlast he called me, and begged me to stay with her, and take care of her.\r\nIt was very pretty to see how gentle and soft he was to her, sharp and\r\nhasty as he was with most; and she would not let him go, coaxing him not\r\nto stay away long; till at last he put her on the sofa, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nthere, Marianne, that will do. Only be a good child, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d I never forget those words, for they were the last I ever heard\r\nhim speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor dear! she cried heartily at first; but after a time she cheered\r\nup, and quite made friends with me. I remember she told me which were\r\nMr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s favourite songs, and sang little scraps of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you remember what they were?\xe2\x80\x99 eagerly exclaimed Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Law, no, air; I never had no head for music. And she laughed about her\r\njourney to Scotland, and got into spirits, only she could not bear I\r\nshould go out of the room; and after a time she grew very anxious for\r\nhim to come back. I made her some tea, and tried to get her to bed,\r\nbut she would not go, though she seemed very tired; for she said Mr.\r\nMorville would come to take her to Redclyffe, and she wanted to hear all\r\nabout the great house, listening for him all the time, and I trying to\r\nquiet her, and telling her the longer he stayed the better chance there\r\nwas. Then came a call for me, and down-stairs I found everything in\r\nconfusion; the news had come--I never knew how. I had not had time to\r\nhear it rightly myself, when there was a terrible cry from up-stairs.\r\nPoor thing! whether she thought he was come, or whether her mind misgave\r\nher, she had come after me to the head of the stairs, and heard what\r\nthey were saying. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe she ever rightly knew what had\r\nhappened, for before I could get to her she had fainted; and she was\r\nvery ill from that moment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it was the next day she died!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking up, after a long\r\nsilence. \xe2\x80\x98Did she--could she take any notice of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir; she lived but half an hour, or hardly that, after you were\r\nborn.\xe2\x80\x99 I told her it was a son; but she was not able to hear or mind me,\r\nand sank away, fainting like. I fancied I heard her say something like\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morville,\xe2\x80\x9d but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and her breath was very soon gone.\r\nPoor dear!\xe2\x80\x99 added Mrs. Lavers, wiping away her tears. \xe2\x80\x98I grieved for her\r\nas if she had been my own child; but then I thought of her waking up to\r\nhear he was dead. I little thought then, Sir Guy, that I should ever see\r\nyou stand there,--strong and well grown. I almost thought you were dead\r\nalready when I sent for Mr. Harrison to baptize you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it you that did so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, his face, mournful before, lighting\r\nup in a sudden beam of gratitude. \xe2\x80\x98Then I have to thank you for more\r\nthan all the world besides.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Law, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Lavers, smiling, and looking pleased, though as\r\nif but half entering into his meaning. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, it was in that very china\r\nbowl; I have kept it choice ever since, and never let it be used for\r\nanything. I thought it was making very bold, but the doctor and all\r\nthought you could not live, and Mr. Harrison might judge. I was very\r\nglad just before he came that Mr. Markham came from Redclyffe. He had\r\nnot been able to leave poor Sir Guy before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy soon after set out on his homeward ride. His yearning to hear of\r\nhis mother had been satisfied; but though he could still love the fair,\r\nsweet vision summoned up by her name, he was less disposed to feel that\r\nit had been hard upon him that she died. It was not Amy. In spite of his\r\ntender compassion and affection, he knew that he had not lost a Verena\r\nin her. None could occupy that place save Amy; and his mind,\r\nfrom custom, reverted to Amy as still his own, thrilled like a\r\nfreshly-touched wound, and tried to realize the solace that even yet she\r\nmight be praying for him.\r\n\r\nIt was dreariness and despondency by day, and he struggled with it by\r\nenergy and occupation; but it was something even worse in the evening,\r\nin the dark, solitary library, where the very size of the room gave\r\nan additional sense of loneliness; and in the silence he could hear,\r\nthrough the closed shutters, the distant plash and surge of the tide,--a\r\nsound, of which, in former years, he had never been sensible. There,\r\nevening after evening, he sat,--his attention roaming from his\r\nemployment to feed on his sad reflections.\r\n\r\nOne evening he went to the large dark dining-room, unlocked the door,\r\nwhich echoed far through the house, and found his way through the\r\npacked-up furniture to a picture against the wall, to which he held up\r\nhis light. It was a portrait by Lely, a half-length of a young man, one\r\nhand on his sword, the other holding his plumed hat. His dark chestnut\r\nhair fell on each side of a bright youthful face, full of life and\r\nhealth, and with eyes which, even in painting, showed what their\r\nvividness must have been. The countenance was full of spirit and joy;\r\nbut the mouth was more hard and stern than suited the rest; and there\r\nwas something in the strong, determined grasp of the sword, which made\r\nit seem as if the hand might be a characteristic portrait. In the corner\r\nof the picture was the name--\xe2\x80\x98Hugo Morville. AEt. 2O, 1671.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy stood holding up his light, and looking fixedly at it for a\r\nconsiderable time. Strange thoughts passed through his mind as the\r\npictured eyes seemed to gaze piercingly down into his own. When he\r\nturned away, he muttered aloud,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He, too, would have said--\xe2\x80\x9cIs thy servant a dog, that he should do\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as if he had once been in a happier, better world, with\r\nthe future dawning brightly on him; but as if that once yielding to the\r\npassions inherited from that wretched man, had brought on him the doom\r\nof misery. He had opened the door to the powers of evil, and must bear\r\nthe penalty.\r\n\r\nThese feelings might partly arise from its having been only now that,\r\nhad all been well, he could have been with Amabel; so that it seemed as\r\nif he had never hitherto appreciated the loss. He had at first comforted\r\nhimself by thinking it was better to be without her than to cause her\r\ndistress; but now he found how hard it was to miss her--his bright\r\nangel. Darkness was closing on him; a tedious, aimless life spread out\r\nbefore him; a despair of doing good haunted him, and with it a sense of\r\nsomething like the presence of an evil spirit, triumphing in his having\r\nonce put himself within its grasp.\r\n\r\nIt was well for Guy that he was naturally active, and had acquired\r\npower over his own mind. He would not allow himself to brood over\r\nthese thoughts by day, and in the evening he busied himself as much as\r\npossible with his studies, or in going over with Markham matters that\r\nwould be useful to him to know when he came to the management of his\r\nproperty. Yet still these thoughts would thicken on him, in spite of\r\nhimself, every evening when he sat alone in the library.\r\n\r\nThe late hours of Christmas Eve was the time when he had most to suffer.\r\nThe day had been gloomy and snowy, and he had spent it almost entirely\r\nin solitude, with no companion or diversion to restore the tone of his\r\nmind, when he had tried it with hard study. He tried to read, but it\r\nwould not do; and he was reduced to sit looking at the fire, recalling\r\nthis time last year, when he had been cutting holly, helping the sisters\r\nto deck the house, and in the evening enjoying a merry Christmas party,\r\nfull of blitheness and glee, where there were, of course, special\r\nrecollections of Amabel.\r\n\r\nAs usual, he dwelt on the contrast, mused on the estrangement of Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone, and tormented himself about Charles\xe2\x80\x99s silence, till he fell\r\ninto the more melancholy train of thought of the destiny of his race.\r\n\r\nFar better for him to bear all alone than to bring on Amy grief and\r\nhorror, such as had fallen on his own mother, but it was much to bear\r\nthat loneliness and desolation for a lifetime. The brow was contracted,\r\nand the lip drawn into a resolute expression of keeping down suffering,\r\nlike that of a man enduring acute bodily pain; as Guy was not yielding,\r\nhe was telling himself--telling the tempter, who would have made him\r\ngive up the struggle--that it was only for a life, and that it was shame\r\nand ingratitude to be faint-hearted, on the very night when he ought to\r\nbe rejoicing that One had come to ruin the power of the foe, and set him\r\nfree. But where was his rejoicing? Was he cheered,--was he comforted?\r\nWas not the lone, blank despondency that had settled on him more heavily\r\nthan ever, a token that he was shut out from all that was good,--nay,\r\nthat in former years there had been no true joy in him, only enjoyment\r\nof temporal pleasure? Had his best days of happiness been, then, nothing\r\nbut hollowness and self-deception?\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sound of a Christmas carol came faintly on his ear.\r\nIt was one of those tunes which, when the village choir were the only\r\nmusicians he knew, he had thought, unrivalled; and now, even to his\r\ntutored, delicate ear, softened as it was by distance, and endeared by\r\nassociation, it was full of refreshing, soothing harmony. He undrew the\r\ncurtain, opened the shutter, and looked into the court, where he saw\r\nsome figures standing. As soon as the light shone from the window, the\r\ncarol was resumed, and the familiar tones were louder and harsher, but\r\nhe loved them, with all their rudeness and dissonance, and throwing up\r\nthe window, called the singers by name, asking why they stood out in the\r\nsnow, instead of coming into the hall, as usual.\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the set came to the window to answer,--so old a man that\r\nhis voice was cracked, and his performance did more harm than good in\r\nthe psalms at church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see, Sir Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98there was some of us thought you might not\r\nlike to have us coming and singing like old times, \xe2\x80\x98cause \xe2\x80\x98tis not all\r\nas it used to be here with you. Yet we didn\xe2\x80\x99t like not to come at all,\r\nwhen you had been away so long, so we settled just to begin, and see\r\nwhether you took any notice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. It was a very kind thought, James,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, touched by the\r\nrough delicacy of feeling manifested by these poor men; \xe2\x80\x98I had rather\r\nhear the carols than anything. Come to the front door; I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 with a most grateful touch of the hat; and Guy\r\nhastened to set things in order, preferring the carols to everything at\r\nthat moment, even though disabused of his pristine admiration for James\r\nRobinson\xe2\x80\x99s fiddle, and for Harry Ray\xe2\x80\x99s grand shake. A long space was\r\nspent in listening, and a still longer in the endeavour to show what Mr.\r\nAshford meant by suggesting some improvements which they were regarding\r\nwith dislike and suspicion, till they found Sir Guy was of the same\r\nmind. In fact, when he had sung a verse or two to illustrate his\r\nmeaning, the opinion of the choir was, that, with equal advantages, Sir\r\nGuy might sing quite as well as Harry Ray.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time he had heard his own voice, except at church,\r\nsince the earlier days of St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, but as he went up the long\r\nstairs and galleries to bed, he found himself still singing. It was,\r\n\r\n       Who lives forlorn,\r\n       On God\xe2\x80\x99s own word doth rest,\r\n       His path is bright\r\n       With heavenly light,\r\n       His lot among the blest.\r\n\r\nHe wondered, and remembered finding music for it with Amy\xe2\x80\x99s help. He\r\nsighed heavily, but the anguish of feeling, the sense of being in the\r\npower of evil, had insensibly left him, and though sad and oppressed,\r\nthe unchangeable joy and hope of Christmas were shedding a beam on him.\r\n\r\nThey were not gone when he awoke, and rose to a solitary breakfast\r\nwithout one Christmas greeting. The light of the other life was\r\nbeginning to shine out, and make him see how to do and to bear, with\r\nthat hope before him. The hope was becoming less vague; the resolution,\r\nthough not more firm, yet less desponding, that he would go on to\r\ngrapple with temptation, and work steadfastly; and with that hope before\r\nhim, he now felt that even a lifetime without Amy would be endurable.\r\n\r\nThe power of rejoicing came more fully at church, and the service\r\nentered into his soul as it never had done before. It had never been\r\nsuch happiness, though repentance and mournful feelings were ever\r\npresent with him; nor was his \xe2\x80\x98Verena\xe2\x80\x99 absent from his mind. He\r\nwalked about between the services, saw the poor people dining in their\r\nholly-decked houses, exchanging Christmas wishes with them, and gave\r\nhis old, beautiful, bright smile as he received demonstrations of their\r\nattachment, or beheld their enjoyment. He went home in the dark, allowed\r\nMrs. Drew to have her own way, and serve him and Bustle with a dinner\r\nsufficient for a dozen people, and was shut up for the solitary\r\nChristmas evening which he had so much dreaded, and which would have\r\nbeen esteemed a misfortune even by those who had no sad thoughts to\r\noccupy them.\r\n\r\nYet when the clock struck eleven he was surprised, and owned that it had\r\nbeen more than not being unhappy. The dark fiends of remorse and despair\r\nhad not once assaulted him, yet it had not been by force of employment\r\nthat they had been averted. He had read and written a little, but very\r\nlittle, and the time had chiefly been spent in a sort of day-dream,\r\nthough not of a return to Hollywell, nor of what Redclyffe might be with\r\nAmy. It had been of a darkened and lonely course, yet, in another sense,\r\nneither dark nor lonely, of a cheerless home and round of duties, with\r\na true home beyond; and still it had been a happy, refreshing dream, and\r\nhe began the next morning with the fresh brightened spirit of a man who\r\nfelt that such an evening was sent him to reinvigorate his energies, and\r\nfit him for the immediate duties that lay before him.\r\n\r\nOn the breakfast-table was what he had not seen for a long time--a\r\nletter directed to him. It was from Mr. Ross, in answer to his question\r\nabout Coombe Prior, entering readily into the subject, and advising\r\nhim to write to the Bishop, altogether with a tone of friendly interest\r\nwhich, especially as coming from one so near Hollywell, was a great\r\npleasure, a real Christmas treat. There was the wonted wish of the\r\nseason--a happy Christmas--which he took gratefully, and lastly there\r\nwas a mention that Charles Edmonstone was better, the suffering over,\r\nthough he was not yet allowed to move.\r\n\r\nIt was a new light that Charles\xe2\x80\x99s silence had been occasioned by\r\nillness, and his immediate resolution was to write at once to Mr. Ross,\r\nto beg for further particulars. In the meantime, the perception that\r\nthere had been no estrangement was such a ray as can hardly be imagined\r\nwithout knowing the despondency it had enlivened. The truth was,\r\nperhaps, that the tone of mind was recovering, and after having fixed\r\nhimself in his resolution to endure, he was able to receive comfort and\r\nrefreshment from without as well as from within.\r\n\r\nHe set to work to write at once to the Bishop, as Mr. Ross advised. He\r\nsaid he could not bear to lose time, and therefore wrote at once. He\r\nshould be of age on the 28th of March, and he hoped then to be able to\r\narrange for a stipend for a curate, if the Bishop approved, and would\r\nkindly enter into communication on the appointment with Mr. Halroyd, the\r\nincumbent. After considering his letter a little while, and wishing he\r\nwas sufficiently intimate with Mr. Ashford to ask him if it would do, he\r\nwrote another to Mr. Ross, to inquire after Charles; then he worked for\r\nan hour at mathematics, till a message came from the gamekeeper to\r\nask whether he would go out shooting, whereat Bustle, evidently\r\nunderstanding, jumped about, and wagged his tail so imploringly, that\r\nGuy could not resist, so he threw his books upon the top of the great\r\npile on the sofa, and, glad that at least he could gratify dog and man,\r\nhe sent word that he should be ready in five minutes.\r\n\r\nHe could not help enjoying the ecstasy of all the dogs, and, indeed he\r\nwas surprised to find himself fully alive to the delight of forcing his\r\nway through a furze-brake, hearing the ice in the peaty bogs crackle\r\nbeneath his feet; getting a good shot, bringing down his bird, finding\r\nsnipe, and diving into the depths of the long, winding valleys and\r\ndingles, with the icicle-hung banks of their streamlets. He came home\r\nthrough the village at about half-past three o\xe2\x80\x99clock, sending the keeper\r\nto leave some of his game at the parsonage, while he went himself to see\r\nhow the work was getting on at the school. Mr. and Mrs. Ashford and the\r\nboys were come on the same errand, in spite of the cloud of dust rising\r\nfrom the newly-demolished lath-and-plaster partition. The boys looked\r\nwith longing eyes at the gun in his hand, and the half-frozen compound\r\nof black and red mud on his gaiters; but they were shy, and their enmity\r\nadded to their shyness, so that even when he shook hands with them, and\r\nspoke good-naturedly, they did not get beyond a monosyllable.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ashford, feeling some compunction for having left him to\r\nhis solitude so long, asked him to dinner for one of the ensuing days,\r\nwith some idea of getting some one to meet him, and named six o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t that put you out? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you always dine early?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nwould let me, I should like to join you at your tea-time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will endure a host of children,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ashford, \xe2\x80\x98I should\r\nlike it of all things,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I want to make acquaintance very\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x99 and he put his hand on Robert\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98Besides, I want to\r\ntalk to you about the singing, and how we are to get rid of that fiddle\r\nwithout breaking James Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe appointment was made, and Guy went home to his hasty dinner, his\r\nGreek, and a little refreshing return afterwards to the books which had\r\nbeen the delight of younger days. There was no renewal of the burthen of\r\ndespair that had so long haunted his evenings. Employments thickened on\r\nhis hands as the days passed on. There was further correspondence about\r\nCoombe Prior and the curate, and consultations with Markham about farmer\r\nTodd, who was as obstinate and troublesome as possible. Guy made Markham\r\ncome to Coombe Prior with him, examine and calculate about the cottages,\r\nand fairly take up the subject, though without much apparent chance of\r\ncoming to any satisfactory result. A letter came from Mr. Ross, telling\r\nhim even more than he had ventured to hope, for it brought a message\r\nfrom Charles himself. Charles had been delighted to hear of him, and had\r\nbegged that he might be told how very sorry he had been not to write;\r\nand how incapable he had been, and still was; but that he hoped Guy\r\nwould write to him, and believe him in the same mind. Mr. Ross added an\r\naccount of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness, saying the suffering had been more severe\r\nthan usual, and had totally disabled him for many weeks; that they had\r\nsince called in a London surgeon, who had given him hope that he might\r\nbe better now than ever before, but had prescribed absolute rest for\r\nat least six weeks longer, so that Charles was now flat on his back all\r\nday, beginning to be able to be amused, and very cheerful and patient.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure of entering into communication with Hollywell again, and\r\nknowing that Charles at least would be glad to hear from him, was so\r\nexquisite, that he was almost surprised, considering that in essentials\r\nhe was where he was before, and even Charles could not be Amy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23\r\n\r\n     They hadna sailed a league, a league,\r\n     A league, but barely three,\r\n     When the lift grew dark, and the wind grew loud,\r\n     And gurly grew the sea.\r\n                    --SIR PATRICK SPENS.--(Old Ballad.)\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s evening with the Ashfords threw down many of the barriers in the\r\nway of intimacy. He soon made friends with the children, beginning with\r\nthe two years old baby, and ending with gaining even the shy and sturdy\r\nRobin, who could not hold out any longer, when it appeared that Sir\r\nGuy could tell him the best place for finding sea-urchins, the present\r\nobjects of his affections.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we should have to go through the park,\xe2\x80\x99 said Edward,\r\ndisconsolately, when Guy had described the locality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must not go into the park!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the children, in chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not go into the park!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy, looking at Mrs. Ashford, in\r\namazement; then, as it flashed on him that it was his part to give\r\nleave, he added,--\xe2\x80\x98I did not know I was such a dog in the manger. I\r\nthought all the parish walked naturally in the park. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nelse it is good for. If Markham will lock it up, I must tell him to give\r\nyou a key.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boys were to come the next day--to be shown the way to the bay of\r\nurchins, and thenceforth they became his constant followers to such a\r\ndegree, that their parents feared they were very troublesome, but he\r\nassured them to the contrary; and no mother in the world could have\r\nfound it in her heart to keep them away from so much happiness. There\r\nwas continually a rushing home with a joyous outcry,--\xe2\x80\x98Mamma! Sir Guy\r\ngave me a ride on his horse!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Mamma! Sir Guy helped us to the top of\r\nthat great rock!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, papa! Sir Guy says we may come out shooting with\r\nhim to-morrow, if you will let us!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Mamma! papa! look! Do you see? I\r\nshot this rabbit my own self with Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s gun!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Papa! papa! Sir Guy\r\nshowed us his boat, and he says he will take us out to the Shag Rock, if\r\nyou will give us leave!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was beyond what papa, still further beyond what mamma, could like,\r\nsince the sea was often very rough in parts near the Shag; there were\r\na good many sunken rocks, and boys, water, and rocks, did not appear by\r\nany means a safe conjunction, so Mrs. Ashford put the matter off for the\r\npresent by the unseasonableness of the weather; and Mr. Ashford asked\r\none or two of the fishermen how far they thought landing on the Shag a\r\nprudent attempt.\r\n\r\nThey did not profess to have often tried, they always avoided those\r\nrocks; but it could hardly be very dangerous, they said, for when Sir\r\nGuy was a boy, he used to be about there for ever, at first with an\r\nold boatman, and afterwards alone in his little boat. They had often\r\nwondered he was trusted there; but if any one knew the rocks, he did.\r\n\r\nStill, Mrs. Ashford could not make up her mind to like the idea, and the\r\nboys came to Sir Guy in a state of great discomposure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps we shall manage it in the summer. We will\r\nget your father to go out with us himself; and, in the meantime, who\r\nlikes to come with me after the rabbits in Cliffstone Copse? Farmer\r\nHolt will thank Robin for killing a dozen or so, for he makes grievous\r\ncomplaints of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy conducted the boys out of sight of the sea, and, to console them,\r\ngave them so much more use of the gun than usual, that it might be\r\nconsidered as a wonder that he escaped being shot. Yet it did not\r\nprevent a few sighs being spent on the boating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98You have no loss, after all,\r\nfor we are likely to have no boating weather this long time. Hark! don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou hear the ground-swell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99 said the boys, standing still to listen to the distant\r\nsurge, like a continuous low moan, or roar, far, far away, though there\r\nwas no wind, and the sea was calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the sound that comes before stormy weather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98It is as\r\nif the sea was gathering up its forces for the tempest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what?--how? Tell me what it really is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Robin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is the wind on the sea before it has reached us,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy. \xe2\x80\x98How solemn it is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nToo solemn for the boys, who began all manner of antics and noises, by\r\nway of silencing the impression of awfulness. Guy laughed, and joined in\r\ntheir fun; but as soon as they were gone home, he stood in silence for\r\na long time, listening to the sound, and recalling the mysterious dreams\r\nand fancies with which it was connected in his boyhood, and which he had\r\nnever wished thus to drive away.\r\n\r\nThe storm he had predicted came on; and by the evening of the following\r\nday, sea and wind were thundering, in their might, against the foot of\r\nthe crags. Guy looked from the window, the last thing at night, and\r\nsaw the stars twinkling overhead, with that extreme brilliancy which\r\nis often seen in the intervals of fitful storms, and which suggested\r\nthoughts that sent him to sleep in a vague, soothing dream.\r\n\r\nHe was wakened by one tremendous continued roar of sea, wind, and\r\nthunder combined. Such was the darkness, that he could not see the form\r\nof the window, till a sheet of pale blue lightning brought it fully out\r\nfor the moment. He sat up, and listened to the \xe2\x80\x98glorious voice\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nfollowed it, thought what an awful night at sea, and remembered when he\r\nused to fancy it would be the height of felicity to have a shipwreck at\r\nRedclyffe, and shocked Mrs. Bernard by inhuman wishes that a ship would\r\nonly come and be wrecked. How often had he watched, through sounds like\r\nthese, for a minute gun! Nay, he had once actually called up poor Arnaud\r\nin the middle of the night for an imaginary signal. Redclyffe Bay was\r\na very dangerous one; a fine place for a wreck, with its precipitous\r\ncrags, its single safe landing-place, and the great Shag Stone, on the\r\neastern side, with a whole progeny of nearly sunken rocks, dreaded\r\nin rough weather by the fishermen themselves; but it was out of the\r\nordinary track of vessels, and there were only a few traditions of\r\nterrible wrecks long before his time.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if he had worked up his fancy again, for the sound of a gun\r\nwas for a moment in his ear. It was lost in the rush of hail against the\r\nwindow, and the moaning of the wind round the old house; but presently\r\nit returned too surely to be imaginary. He sprang to the window, and the\r\nbroad, flickering glare of lightning revealed the black cliff and pale\r\nsea-line; then all was dark and still, while the storm was holding\r\nits breath for the thunder-burst which in a few more seconds rolled\r\noverhead, shaking door and window throughout the house. As the awful\r\nsound died away, in a moment\xe2\x80\x99s lull, came the gun again. He threw up the\r\nwindow, and as the blast of wind and rain swept howling into the room,\r\nit brought another report.\r\n\r\nTo close the window, light his candle, throw on his clothes, and hasten\r\ndown-stairs, was the work of a very few seconds. Luckily, the key of\r\nthe boat-house was lying on the table in the hall, where he had left it,\r\nafter showing the boat to the Ashford boys; he seized it, caught up the\r\npocket telescope, put on a rough coat, and proceeded to undo the endless\r\nfastenings of the hall-door, a very patience-trying occupation; and,\r\nwhen completed, the gusts that were eddying round the house, ready to\r\nforce their way in everywhere, took advantage of the first opening to\r\nblow out his candle.\r\n\r\nHowever, they had in one way done good service, for the shower had\r\nbeen as brief as it was violent, and the inky cloud was drifting away\r\nfuriously towards the east, leaving the moon visible, near her setting,\r\nand allowing her white cold light to shine forth, contrasting with the\r\ndistant sheets of pale lightning, growing fainter and fainter.\r\n\r\nGuy ran across the court, round to the west side of the house, and\r\nstruggled up the slope in the face of the wind, which almost swept him\r\ndown again; and when at length he had gained the summit, came rushing\r\nagainst him with such force that he could hardly stand. He did, however,\r\nkeep his ground, and gazed out over the sea. The swell was fearful;\r\nmarked by the silver light on one side, where it caught the moonbeams,\r\nand the black shade on the other, ever alternating, so that the eye\r\ncould, not fix on them for a moment; the spray leapt high in its\r\nwhiteness, and the Shag stood up hard, bold, and black. The waves\r\nthundered, bursting on the cliff and, high as he stood, the spray dashed\r\nalmost blinding in his face, while the wind howled round him, as if\r\ngathering its might for the very purpose of wrenching him from the\r\ncliff; but he stood firm, and looked out again, to discern clearly\r\nwhat he thought he had seen. It was the mast of a vessel, seen plainly\r\nagainst the light silvery distance of sea on the reef west of the Shag.\r\nIt was in a slanting direction, and did not move; he could not doubt\r\nthat the ship had struck on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the\r\nbay; and as his eyes became more accustomed to the unusual light, and\r\nmade out what objects were or were not familiar, he could perceive the\r\nship herself. He looked with the glass, but could see no one on board,\r\nnor were any boats in sight; but observing some of the lesser rocks,\r\nhe beheld some moving figures on them. Help!--instant help!--was his\r\nthought; and he looked towards the Cove. Lights were in the cottage\r\nwindows, and a few sounds came up to him, as if the fishing population\r\nwere astir.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to the side of the cliff, which was partly clothed with\r\nbrushwood. There was a descent--it could hardly be called a path--which\r\nno one ventured to attempt but himself and a few of the boldest\r\nbirds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting boys of the village; but he could lose no time, and\r\nscrambling, leaping, swinging himself by the branches, he reached the\r\nfoot of the cliff in safety, and in five minutes more was on the little\r\nquay at the end of the steep street of the Cove.\r\n\r\nThe quay was crowded with the fisher-people, and there was a strange\r\nconfusion of voices; some saying all was lost; some that the crew had\r\ngot to the rock; others, that some one ought to put off and help them;\r\nothers, that a boat would never live in such a sea; and an old telescope\r\nwas in great requisition.\r\n\r\nBen Robinson, a tall, hardy young man, of five-and-twenty, wild,\r\nreckless, high-spirited and full of mischief and adventure, was standing\r\non a pile at the extreme verge above the foaming water, daring the\r\nothers to go with him to the rescue; and, though Jonas Ledbury, a feeble\r\nold man, was declaring, in a piteous tone, it was a sin and a shame to\r\nlet so many poor creatures be lost in sight, without one man stirring to\r\nhelp them; yet all stood irresolute, watching the white breakers dashing\r\non the Shag, and the high waves that swelled and rolled between.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know where the crew are?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy, shouting as loud as he\r\ncould, for the noise of the winds and waves was tremendous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, sir, on the flat black stone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fortunate possessor\r\nof the telescope. \xe2\x80\x98Some ten or eleven of them, I fancy, all huddled\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said old Ledbury. \xe2\x80\x98Poor creatures! there they be; and what\r\nis to be done, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say! I never saw a boat in such a sea, since the\r\nnight poor Jack, my brother, was lost, and Will Ray with him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, who had in the meantime looked through his\r\nglass. \xe2\x80\x98How soon is high water?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was an important question, for the rocks round the Shag were covered\r\nbefore full tide, even when the water was still. There was a looking up\r\nat the moon, and then Guy and the fishermen simultaneously exclaimed,\r\nthat it would be in three hours; which gave scarcely an hour to spare.\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Guy sprang from the quay to the boat-house,\r\nunlocked it, and, by example, showed that the largest boat was to be\r\nbrought out. The men helped him vigorously, and it stood on the narrow\r\npebbly beach, the only safe landing-place in the whole bay; he\r\nthrew into it a coil of rope, and called out in his clear commanding\r\nvoice--\xe2\x80\x98Five to go with me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHanging back was at an end. They were brave men, who had wanted nothing\r\nbut a leader, and with Sir Guy at their head, were ready for anything.\r\nNot five, but five-and-twenty were at his command; and even in the hurry\r\nof the moment, a strong, affectionate feeling filled his eyes with tears\r\nas he saw these poor fellows ready to trust their lives in his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you--thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x98Not all, though; you, Ben\r\nRobinson, Harry Ray, Charles Ray, Ben Ledbury, Wat Green.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were all young men, without families, such as could best be spared;\r\nand each, as his name was called, answered, \xe2\x80\x98Here, Sir Guy!\xe2\x80\x99 and came\r\nforward with a resolute satisfied air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be best to have a second boat,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Brown,\xe2\x80\x99 to the\r\nowner of the telescope, \xe2\x80\x98will you lend yours? \xe2\x80\x98tis the strongest and\r\nlightest. Thank you. Martin had best steer it, he knows the rocks;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe went on to name the rest of the crew; but at the last there was a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, as if he doubted.\r\n\r\nA tall athletic young fisherman took advantage of it to press forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please your honour, Sir Guy, may not I go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better not, Jem,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Remember,\xe2\x80\x99 in a lower voice, \xe2\x80\x98your\r\nmother has no one but you. Here!\xe2\x80\x99 he called, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x98Jack Horn, you\r\npull a good oar! Now, then, are we ready?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All ready,--yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe boat was launched, not without great difficulty, in the face of such\r\na sea. The men stoutly took their oars, casting a look forward at the\r\nrocks, then at the quay, and on the face of their young steersman.\r\nLittle they guessed the intense emotion that swelled in his breast as he\r\ntook the helm, to save life or to lose it; enjoying the enterprise, yet\r\nwith the thought that his lot might be early death; glad it was right\r\nthus to venture, earnest to save those who had freely trusted to him,\r\nand rapidly, though most earnestly, recalling his own repentance.\r\nAll this was in his mind, though nothing was on his face but cheerful\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nNight though it was, tidings of the wreck had reached the upper part\r\nof the village; and Mr. Ashford, putting his head out of his window to\r\nlearn the cause of the sounds in the street, was informed by many voices\r\nthat a ship was on the Shag reef, and that all were lost. To hasten\r\nto the Cove to learn the truth, and see if any assistance could yet\r\nbe afforded, was his instant thought; and he had not taken many steps\r\nbefore he was overtaken by a square, sturdy figure, wrapped in an\r\nimmense great-coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So, Mr. Markham, you are on your way to see about this wreck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham, roughly, though not with the repellent manner\r\nusual with him towards Mr. Ashford, \xe2\x80\x98I must be there, or that boy will\r\nbe in the thickest of it. Wherever is mischief, there is he. I only\r\nwonder he has not broken his neck long ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By mischief, you mean danger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I hope he has not heard of this wreck, for if he has, no power on\r\nearth would keep him back from it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nComparing the reports they had heard, the clergyman and steward walked\r\non, Markham\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety actually making him friendly. They reached the top\r\nof the steep street of the Cove; but though there was a good view of the\r\nsea from thence, they could distinguish nothing, for another cloud was\r\nrising, and had obscured the moon. They were soon on the quay, now still\r\nmore crowded, and heard the exclamations of those who were striving to\r\nkeep their eyes on the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s one!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, \xe2\x80\x98tis!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Markham. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean he is gone? Then I am too\r\nlate! What could you be thinking of, you old fool, Jonas, to let that\r\nboy go? You\xe2\x80\x99ll never see him again, I can tell you. Mercy! Here comes\r\nanother squall! There\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it, then!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarkham seemed to derive some relief from railing at the fishermen,\r\nsingly and collectively, while Mr. Ashford tried to learn the real\r\nfacts, and gather opinions as to the chance of safety. The old fishermen\r\nheld that there was frightful risk, though the attempt was far from\r\nhopeless; they said the young men were all good at their oars, Sir Guy\r\nknew the rocks very well, and the chief fear was, that he might not know\r\nhow to steer in such a sea; but they had seen that, though daring,\r\nhe was not rash. They listened submissively to Mr. Markham, but\r\ncommunicated in an under-tone to the vicar, how vain it would have been\r\nto attempt to restrain Sir Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said old James Robinson, \xe2\x80\x98he spoke just like the captain of\r\na man-of-war, and for all Mr. Markham says, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nbeen able to gainsay him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your son is gone with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, sir; and I would not say one word to stop him. I know Sir Guy won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrun him into risk for nothing; and I hope, please God, if Ben comes back\r\nsafe, it may be the steadying of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Twas he that volunteered to go before Sir Guy came, they say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man, with a pleased yet melancholy look. \xe2\x80\x98Ben\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrave enough; but there\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. He\xe2\x80\x99d have done it for the\r\nlark, and to dare the rest; but Sir Guy does it with thought, and\r\nbecause it is right. I wish it may be the steadying of Ben!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shower rushed over them again, shorter and less violent than the\r\nformer one, but driving in most of the crowd, and only leaving on the\r\nquay the vicar, the steward, and a few of the most anxious fishermen.\r\nThey could see nothing; for the dark slanting line of rain swept over\r\nthe waves, joining together the sea and thick low cloud; and the roaring\r\nof the sea and moaning of the wind were fearful. No one spoke, till\r\nat last the black edges of the Shag loomed clearer, the moon began to\r\nglance through the skirts of the cloud, and the heaving and tossing of\r\nthe sea, became more discernible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!--there!\xe2\x80\x99 shouted young Jem, the widow\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The boats?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?--where?--for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake! That\xe2\x80\x99s nothing!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Markham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes! I see both,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jem. \xe2\x80\x98The glass! Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglass!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarkham was trying to fix his own, but neither hand nor eye were\r\nsteady enough; he muttered,--\xe2\x80\x98Hang the glass!\xe2\x80\x99 and paced up and down\r\nin uncontrollable anxiety. Mr. Ashford turned with him, trying to\r\nspeak consolingly, and entirely liking the old man. Markham was not\r\nungrateful, but he was almost in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is the same over again!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98He is the age his father was,\r\nthough Mr. Morville never was such as he--never--how should he? He is\r\nthe last of them--the best--he would have been--he was. Would to heaven\r\nI were with him, that, if he is lost, we might all go together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 called Jem, who, being forbidden to do anything but watch,\r\ndid so earnestly; \xe2\x80\x98they be as far now as opposite West Cove. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee them, in that light place?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe moon had by this time gone down, but the first great light of dawn\r\nwas beginning to fall on the tall Shag, and show its fissures and dark\r\nshades, instead of leaving it one hard, unbroken mass. Now and then Jem\r\nthought he saw the boats; but never so distinctly as to convince the\r\nwatchers that they had not been swamped among the huge waves that\r\ntumbled and foamed in that dangerous tract.\r\n\r\nMr. Ashford had borrowed Markham\xe2\x80\x99s telescope, and was looking towards\r\nthe rock, where the shipwrecked crew had taken refuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is some one out of the boat, climbing on the rocks. Can you make\r\nhim out, Jem?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see--I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Brown; \xe2\x80\x98there are two of them. They are\r\nclimbing along the lee-side of the long ridge of rocks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, ay,\xe2\x80\x99 said old Ledbury; \xe2\x80\x98they can\xe2\x80\x99t get in a boat close to the flat\r\nrocks, they must take out a line. Bold fellows!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where are the boats?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mr. Ashford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can tell that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ledbury; \xe2\x80\x98they must have got under the lee of\r\nthe lesser Shag. There\xe2\x80\x99s a ring there that Sir Guy had put in to moor\r\nhis boat to. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be made fast there, and those two must be taking\r\nthe rope along that ledge, so as for the poor fellows on the rock to\r\nhave a hold of, as they creep along to where the boats are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those broken rocks!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ashford. \xe2\x80\x98Can there be a footing, and in\r\nsuch a sea?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you give a guess who they be, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Robinson, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d only let Jem have a look, maybe he could guess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarkham\xe2\x80\x99s glass was at his service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hullo! what a sea! I see them now. That\xe2\x80\x99s Ben going last--I know his\r\nred cap. And the first--why, \xe2\x80\x98tis Sir Guy himself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be such a fool, Jem\xe2\x80\x99 cried Markham, angrily. \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy knows\r\nbetter. Give me the glass.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut when it was restored, Markham went on spying in silence, while\r\nBrown, keeping fast possession of his own telescope, communicated his\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, I see them. Where are they? He\xe2\x80\x99s climbing now. There\xe2\x80\x99s a breaker\r\njust there, will wash them off, as sure as they\xe2\x80\x99re alive! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em. Yes, I do--there\xe2\x80\x99s Redcap! There\xe2\x80\x99s something stirring on the rock!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they watched till, after an interval, in which the boats\r\ndisappeared behind the rocks, they were seen advancing over the waters\r\nagain--one--yes--both, and loaded. They came fast, they were in sight\r\nof all, growing larger each moment, mounting on the crest of the huge\r\nrolling waves, then plunged in the trough so long as to seem as if\r\nthey were lost, then rising--rising high as mountains. Over the roaring\r\nwaters came at length the sound of voices, a cheer, pitched in a\r\ndifferent key from the thunder of wind and wave; they almost fancied\r\nthey knew the voice that led the shout. Such a cheer as rose in answer,\r\nfrom all the Redclyffe villagers, densely crowded on quay, and beach,\r\nand every corner of standing ground!\r\n\r\nThe sun was just up, his beams gilded the crests of the leaping waves,\r\nand the spray danced up, white and gay, round the tall rocks, whose\r\nshadow was reflected in deep green, broken by the ever-moving swell. The\r\nShag and its attendant rocks, and the broken vessel, were bathed in the\r\nclear morning light; the sky was of a beautiful blue, with magnificent\r\nmasses of dark cloud, the edges, where touched by the sunbeams, of a\r\npearly white; and across the bay, tracing behind them glittering streams\r\nof light, came up the two boats with their freight of rescued lives.\r\nMartin\xe2\x80\x99s boat was the first to touch the landing-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All saved,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98all owing to him,\xe2\x80\x99 pointing back to Sir Guy.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for questions; the wan, drenched sailors had to be\r\nhelped on shore, and the boat hauled up out of the way. In the meantime,\r\nGuy, as he steered in past the quay, smiled and nodded to Mr. Ashford\r\nand Markham, and renewed the call, \xe2\x80\x98All safe!\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Ashford thought that\r\nhe had never seen anything brighter than his face--the eyes radiant in\r\nthe morning sun, the damp hair hanging round it, and life, energy, and\r\npromptitude in every feature and movement.\r\n\r\nThe boat came in, the sailors were assisted out, partly by their\r\nrescuers, partly by the spectators. Guy stood up, and, with one foot on\r\nthe seat, supported on his knee and against his arm a little boy, round\r\nwhom his great-coat was wrapped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, Jem!\xe2\x80\x99 he shouted, to his rejected volunteer, who had been very\r\nactive in bringing in the boat, \xe2\x80\x98here\xe2\x80\x99s something for you to do. This\r\npoor little fellow has got a broken arm. Will you ask your mother to\r\ntake him in? She\xe2\x80\x99s the best nurse in the parish. And send up for Mr.\r\nGregson.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJem received the boy as tenderly as he was given; and, with one bound,\r\nGuy was by the side of his two friends. Mr. Ashford shook hands with\r\nheartfelt gratulation; Markham exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, Sir Guy, after the old fashion! Never was man so mad in this\r\nworld! I\xe2\x80\x99ve done talking! You\xe2\x80\x99ll never be content till you have got your\r\ndeath. As if no one could do anything without you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was it you who carried out the line on the rock?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ashford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ben Robinson and I. I had often been there, after sea anemones and\r\nweeds, and I had a rope round me, so don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, Markham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have no more to say,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Markham, almost surly. \xe2\x80\x98I might as\r\nwell talk to a sea-gull at once. As if you had any right to throw away\r\nyour life!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I enjoyed it too much to have anything to say for myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98besides, we must see after these poor men. There were two or three\r\nnearly drowned. Is no one gone for Mr. Gregson?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Gregson, the doctor, was already present, and no one who had\r\nany authority could do anything but attend to the disposal of the\r\nshipwrecked crew. Mr. Ashford went one way, Markham another, Guy a\r\nthird; but, between one cottage and another, Mr. Ashford learnt some\r\nparticulars. The crew had been found on a flat rock and the fishermen\r\nhad at first thought all their perils in vain, for it was impossible\r\nto bring the boats up, on account of the rocks, which ran out in a long\r\nreef. Sir Guy, who knew the place, steered to the sheltered spot where\r\nhe had been used to make fast his own little boat, and undertook to\r\nmake his way from thence to the rock where the crew had taken refuge,\r\ncarrying a rope to serve as a kind of hand-rail, when fastened from one\r\nrock to the other. Ben insisted on sharing his peril, and they had\r\ncrept along the slippery, broken reefs, lashed by the surge, for such\r\na distance, that the fishermen shuddered as they spoke of the danger of\r\nbeing torn off by the force of the waves, and dashed against the rocks.\r\nNothing else could have saved the crew. They had hardly accomplished the\r\npassage through the rising tide, even with the aid of the rope and the\r\nguidance of Sir Guy and Ben, and, before the boats had gone half a mile\r\non their return, the surge was tumbling furiously over the stones where\r\nthey had been found.\r\n\r\nThe sailors were safely disposed of, in bed, or by the fireside, the\r\nfishers vying in services to them. Mr. Ashford went to the cottage of\r\nCharity Ledbury, Jem\xe2\x80\x99s mother, to inquire for the boy with the broken\r\narm. As he entered the empty kitchen, the opposite door of the stairs\r\nwas opened, and Guy appeared, stepping softly, and speaking low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98he is just going to sleep. He bore it\r\nfamously!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The setting his arm?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He was quite sensible, and very patient, and that old Charity\r\nLedbury is a capital old woman. She and Jem are delighted to have him,\r\nand will nurse him excellently. How are all the others? Has that poor\r\nman come to his senses?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I saw him safe in bed at old Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s. The captain is at the\r\nBrowns\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what time of day it is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Past eight. Ah! there is the bell beginning. I was thinking of going\r\nto tell Master Ray we are not too much excited to remember church-going\r\nthis morning; but I am glad he has found it out only ten minutes too\r\nlate. I must make haste. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May not I come, too, or am I too strange a figure?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking\r\nat his dress, thrown on in haste, and saturated with sea-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ashford, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98Is it wise, with all your wet\r\nthings?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not given to colds,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Guy, and they walked on quickly\r\nfor some minutes; after which he said, in a low voice and hurried\r\nmanner,--\xe2\x80\x98would you make some mention of it in the Thanksgiving?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I will\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Ashford, with much emotion. \xe2\x80\x98The danger must\r\nhave been great.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, as if the strong feeling would show itself. \xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nmost merciful. That little boat felt like a toy at the will of the winds\r\nand waves, till one recollected who held the storm in His hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke very simply, as if he could not help it, with his eye fixed\r\non the clear eastern sky, and with a tone of grave awe and thankfulness\r\nwhich greatly struck Mr. Ashford, from the complete absence of\r\nself-consciousness, or from any attempt either to magnify or depreciate\r\nhis sense of the danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You thought the storm a more dangerous time than your expedition on the\r\nrock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not. The fishermen, who were used to such things, did not think\r\nmuch of it; but I am glad to have been out on such a night, if only for\r\nthe magnificent sensation it gives to realize one\xe2\x80\x99s own powerlessness\r\nand His might. As for the rock, there was something to do to look to\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s footing, and cling on; no time to think.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a desperate thing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so bad as it looked. One step at a time is all one wants, you know,\r\nand that there always was. But what a fine fellow Ben Robinson is! He\r\nbehaved like a regular hero--it was the thorough contempt and love of\r\ndanger one reads of. There must be a great deal of good in him, if one\r\nonly knew how to get hold of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look there!\xe2\x80\x99 was Mr. Ashford\xe2\x80\x99s answer, as he turned his head at the\r\nchurch wicket; and, at a short distance behind, Guy saw Ben himself\r\nwalking up the path, with his thankful, happy father, a sight that had\r\nnot been seen for months, nay, for years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98such a night as this, and such a good old man as the\r\nfather, could not fail to bring out all the good in a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mr. Ashford, \xe2\x80\x98such a night, under such a leader! The\r\nsight of so much courage based on that foundation is what may best touch\r\nand save that man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter church, Guy walked fast away; Mr. Ashford went home, made a long\r\nbreakfast, having the whole story to tell, and was on to the scene\r\nof action again, where he found the master, quite restored, and was\r\npresently joined by Markham. Of Sir Guy, there was no news, except that\r\nJem Ledbury said he had looked in after church to know how the cabin boy\r\nwas going on, and the master, understanding that he had been the leader\r\nin the rescue, was very anxious to thank him, and walked up to the house\r\nwith Markham and Mr. Ashford.\r\n\r\nMarkham conducted them straight to the library, the door of which was\r\nopen. He crossed the room, smiled, and made a sign to Mr. Ashford, who\r\nlooked in some surprise and amusement. It has been already said that\r\nthe room was so spacious that the inhabited part looked like a little\r\nencampment by the fire, though the round table was large, and the green\r\nleather sofa and arm chair were cumbrous.\r\n\r\nHowever, old Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair was never used by his grandson; Markham\r\nmight sit there, and Bustle did sometimes, but Guy always used one of\r\nthe unpretending, unluxurious chairs, which were the staple of the room.\r\nThis, however, was vacant, and on the table before it stood the remains\r\nof breakfast, a loaf reduced to half its dimensions, an empty plate and\r\ncoffee-cup. The fire was burnt down to a single log, and on the sofa,\r\non all the various books with which it was strewed, lay Guy, in anything\r\nbut a comfortable position, his head on a great dictionary, fairly\r\novercome with sleep, his very thick, black eyelashes resting on his\r\nfresh, bright cheek, and the relaxation of the grave expression of his\r\nfeatures making him look even younger than he really was. He was so\r\nsound asleep that it was not till some movement of Markham\xe2\x80\x99s that he\r\nawoke, and started up, exclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a horrid shame! I am very sorry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sorry! what for?\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham. \xe2\x80\x98I am glad, at any rate, you have been\r\nwise enough to change your things, and eat some breakfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I meant to have done so much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but sea-wind makes one so\r\nsleepy!\xe2\x80\x99 Then, perceiving the captain, he came forward, hoping he was\r\nquite recovered.\r\n\r\nThe captain stood mystified, for he could not believe this slim youth\r\ncould be the Sir Guy of whose name he had heard so much, and, after\r\nanswering the inquiry, he began,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I could have the honour of seeing Sir Guy--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, sir!\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain, while they all laughed, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndid not guess you could be so young a gentleman. I am sure, sir, \xe2\x80\x98tis\r\nwhat any man might be proud of having done, and--I never saw anything\r\nlike it!\xe2\x80\x99 he added, with a fresh start, \xe2\x80\x98and it will do you honour\r\neverywhere. All our lives are owing to you, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy did not cut him short, though very glad when it was over. He felt he\r\nshould not, in the captain\xe2\x80\x99s place, like to have his thanks shortened,\r\nand besides, if ever there was happiness or exultation, it was in the\r\nglistening eyes of old Markham, the first time he had ever been able\r\nto be justly proud of one of the family, whom he loved with so much\r\nfaithfulness and devotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24\r\n\r\n     Is there a word, or jest, or game,\r\n     But time encrusteth round\r\n     With sad associate thoughts the same?\r\n               --ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the persons who spent a forlorn autumn was Mr. Ross, though his\r\ntroubles were not quite of the same description as those of his young\r\nparishioners. He missed his daughter very much; all his household\r\naffairs got out of order; the school-girls were naughty, and neither\r\nhe, nor Miss Edmonstone, nor the mistress, could discover the culprits;\r\ntheir inquiries produced nothing but a wild confusion of mutual\r\naccusations, where the truth was undistinguishable. The cook never could\r\nfind anything to make broth of, Mr. Ross could, never lay his hands on\r\nthe books he wanted for himself or anybody else; and, lastly, none of\r\nhis shirts ever had their buttons on.\r\n\r\nMary, meanwhile, had to remain through a whole course of measles, then\r\nto greet the arrival of a new nephew, and to attend his christening: but\r\nshe had made a vow that she would be at home by Christmas, and she kept\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMr. Ross had the satisfaction of fetching her home from the station the\r\nday before Christmas Eve, and of seeing her opposite to him, on her\r\nown side of the table, in the evening, putting on the buttons, and\r\nconsidering it an especial favour and kindness, for which to be for ever\r\ngrateful, that he had written all his Christmas sermons beforehand,\r\nso as to have a whole evening clear before her. He was never a great\r\nletter-writer, and Mary had a great deal to hear, for all that had come\r\nto her were the main facts, with very few details.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had very few letters, even from Hollywell,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98I suppose\r\nit is on account of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness. You think him really better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, much better. I forgot to tell you, you are wanted for their\r\nChristmas party to-morrow night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! he is well enough for them not to put it off! Is he able to be out\r\nof bed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, he lies perfectly flat, and looks very thin. It has been a very\r\nsevere illness. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever knew him suffer so much; but,\r\nat the same time, I never knew him behave so well, or show so much\r\npatience, and consideration for other people, I was the more surprised,\r\nbecause at first he seemed to have relapsed into all the ways he thought\r\nhe had shaken off; he was so irritable and fretful, that poor Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone looked worn out; but it seems to have been only the beginning\r\nof the illness; it was very different after he was laid up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he had you to see him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, he asked for it, which he never did before, and Amabel reads to\r\nhim every morning. There is certainly much more that is satisfactory\r\nabout those young Edmonstones than there once seemed reason to expect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now tell me about Sir Guy. What is the matter? Why does he not come\r\nhome this winter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell you the rights of it, Mary. Mr. Edmonstone is very much\r\noffended about something he is reported to have said, and suspects\r\nhim of having been in mischief at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s; but I am not at all\r\npersuaded that it is not one of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s affronts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At Redclyffe. I have a letter from him which I am going to answer\r\nto-night. I shall tell the Edmonstones about it, for I cannot believe\r\nthat, if he had been guilty of anything very wrong, his mind would be\r\noccupied in this manner;\xe2\x80\x99 and he gave Mary the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Mary, as she read. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure he cannot be in any\r\nmischief. What an admirable person he is! I am very sorry this cloud has\r\narisen! I was thinking last summer how happy they all were together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Either this or Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness has cast a gloom over the whole house.\r\nThe girls are both grown much graver.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy graver?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think so. At least she did not seem to cheer up as I should have\r\nexpected when her brother grew better. She looks as if she had been\r\nnursing him too closely, and yet I see her walking a good deal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, and she asked no more questions, but was\r\nanxious to make her own observations.\r\n\r\nShe did not see the Edmonstones till the next evening, as the day was\r\nwet, and she only received a little note telling her that one carriage\r\nwould be sent to fetch her and Mr. Ross. The whole of the family, except\r\nCharles, were in the drawing-room, but Mary looked chiefly at Amy. She\r\nwas in white, with holly in her hair, and did not look sorrowful;\r\nbut she was paler and thinner than last summer, and though she spoke,\r\nsmiled, and laughed when she ought, it was without the gay, childish\r\nfreedom of former times. She was a small, pale, quiet girl now, not a\r\nmerry, caressing kitten. Mary recollected what she had been in the wood\r\nlast summer, and was sure it was more than Charles\xe2\x80\x99s illness that had\r\naltered her; yet still Amy had not Laura\xe2\x80\x99s harassed look.\r\n\r\nMary had not much talk with Amy, for it was a large party, with a good\r\nmany young ladies and children, and Amy had a great deal of work in the\r\nway of amusing them. She had a wearied look, and was evidently exerting\r\nherself to the utmost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look tired,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it is only stupidity,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, smiling rather sadly. \xe2\x80\x98We can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nentertaining without Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It has been a melancholy winter,\xe2\x80\x99 began Mary, but she was surprised,\r\nfor Amy\xe2\x80\x99s face and neck coloured in a moment; then, recovering herself,\r\nwith some hesitation, she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! but Charlie is much better, and that is a great comfort. I am glad\r\nyou are come home, Mary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are going to have some magic music,\xe2\x80\x99 was said at the other end of\r\nthe room. \xe2\x80\x98Who will play?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Where is she? She always does it to\r\nadmiration. Amy, come and be a performer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy rose, and came forward, but the colour had flushed into her cheeks\r\nagain, and the recollection occurred to Mary, that her fame as a\r\nperformer, in that way, arose from the very amusing manner in which she\r\nand Sir Guy had conducted the game last year. At the same moment her\r\nmother met her, and whispered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had you rather not, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can do it, mamma, thank you--never mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to send you up to Charlie--he has been so long alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! thank you, dear mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 with a look of relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is Charlotte wild to be a musician,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps you will see how she can manage; for I think Charles must want\r\na visit from his little nurse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy moved quietly away, and entered Charles\xe2\x80\x99s room, full of warm\r\ngratitude for the kindness which was always seeking how to spare her.\r\n\r\nCharles was asleep, and throwing a shawl round her, she sat down in the\r\ndim light of the lamp, relieved by the stillness, only broken by now and\r\nthen a louder note of the music down-stairs. It was very comfortable,\r\nafter all that buzz of talk, and the jokes that seemed so nonsensical\r\nand tiresome. There were but two people who could manage to make a party\r\nentertaining, and that was the reason it was so different last year.\r\nThen Amy wondered if she was the only person who felt sick at heart and\r\ndreary; but she only wondered for a moment--she murmured half aloud to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x98I said I never would think of him except at my prayers! Here I\r\nam doing it again, and on Christmas night. I won\xe2\x80\x99t hide my eyes and moan\r\nover my broken reed; for Christmas is come, and the circles of song are\r\nwidening round! Glory! good will, peace on earth! How he sang it last\r\nyear, the last thing, when the people were gone, before we went up to\r\nbed. But I am breaking my resolution again. I must do something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took up a book of sacred poetry, and began to learn a piece which\r\nshe already nearly knew; but the light was bad, and it was dreamy work;\r\nand probably she was half asleep, for her thoughts wandered off to\r\nSintram and the castle on the Mondenfelsen, which seemed to her like\r\nwhat she had pictured the Redclyffe crags, and the castle itself was\r\nconnected in her imagination with the deep, echoing porch, while Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown voice seemed to be chanting--\r\n\r\n\r\n        Who lives forlorn,\r\n        On God\xe2\x80\x99s own word doth rest;\r\n        His path is bright\r\n        With heavenly light,\r\n        His lot among the blest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you there, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, waking. \xe2\x80\x98What are you staying here\r\nfor? Don\xe2\x80\x99t they want you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma was so kind as to send me up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you are come, for I have something to tell you. Mr. Ross has\r\nbeen up to see me, you know, and he has a letter from Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s heart beat fast, and, with eyes fixed on the ground, she listened\r\nas Charles continued to give an account of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s letter about Coombe\r\nPrior. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Ross is quite satisfied about him, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 he concluded. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwish you could have heard the decided way in which he said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will\r\n_live_ it down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s answer was to stoop down and kiss her brother\xe2\x80\x99s forehead.\r\n\r\nAnother week brought Guy\xe2\x80\x99s renewal of the correspondence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, here is something for you to read,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, holding up the\r\nletter as she came into the room.\r\n\r\nShe knew the writing. \xe2\x80\x98Wait one moment, Charlie, dear;\xe2\x80\x99 and she ran out\r\nof the room, found her mother fortunately alone, and said, averting her\r\nface,--\xe2\x80\x98Mamma, dear, do you think I ought to let Charlie show me that\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone took hold of her hand, and drew her round so as to look\r\ninto the face through its veiling curls. The hand shook, and the face\r\nwas in a glow of eagerness. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, dearest!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, for she could not\r\nhelp it; and then, as Amy ran back again, she asked herself whether it\r\nwas foolish, and bad for her sweet little daughter, then declared to\r\nherself that it must--it should--it would come right.\r\n\r\nThere was not a word of Amy in the letter, but it, or something else,\r\nmade her more bright and cheerful than she had been for some time past.\r\nIt seemed as if the lengthening days of January were bringing renewed\r\ncomfort with them, when Charles, who ever since October had been\r\nconfined to bed, was able to wear the Chinese dressing-gown, be lifted\r\nto a couch, and wheeled into the dressing-room, still prostrate, but\r\nmuch enjoying the change of scene, which he called coming into the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThese were the events at quiet Hollywell, while Redclyffe was still\r\nengrossed with the shipwreck, which seemed to have come on purpose to\r\nenliven and occupy this solitary winter. It perplexed the Ashfords\r\nabout their baronet more than ever. Mr. Ashford said that no one whose\r\nconscience was not clear could have confronted danger as he had done;\r\nand yet the certainty that he was under a cloud, and the sadness, so\r\ninconsistent with his age and temperament still puzzled them. Mrs.\r\nAshford thought she had made a discovery. The second day after the\r\nwreck, the whole crew, except the little cabin-boy, were going to set\r\noff to the nearest sea-port; and the evening preceding their departure,\r\nthey were to meet their rescuers, the fishermen, at a supper in the\r\ngreat servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall at the park. Edward and Robert were in great glory,\r\nbringing in huge branches of evergreens to embellish the clean, cold\r\nplace; and Mr. and Mrs. Ashford and Grace were to come to see the\r\nentertainment, after having some coffee in the library.\r\n\r\nGuy prepared it for his company by tumbling his books headlong from\r\nthe sofa to a more remote ottoman, sticking a bit of holly on the\r\nmantel-shelf, putting out his beloved old friend, Strutt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Sports and\r\nPastimes,\xe2\x80\x99 to amuse Grace, and making up an immense fire; and then,\r\nlooking round, thought the room was uncommonly comfortable; but the\r\nfirst thing that struck Mrs. Ashford, when, with face beaming welcome,\r\nhe ushered her in from the great hall, was how forlorn rooms looked that\r\nhad not a woman to inhabit them.\r\n\r\nThe supper went off with great eclat. Arnaud at the head of the table\r\ncarved with foreign courtesies, contrasted with the downright bluff way\r\nof the sailors. As soon as Sir Guy brought Mrs. Ashford to look in on\r\nthem, old James Robinson proposed his health, with hopes he would soon\r\ncome and live among them for good, and Jonas Ledbury added another\r\nwish, that \xe2\x80\x98Lady Morville\xe2\x80\x99 might soon be there too. At these words, an\r\nexpression of pain came upon Guy\xe2\x80\x99s face; his lips were rigidly pressed\r\ntogether; he turned hastily away, and paced up and down before he could\r\ncommand his countenance. All were so busy cheering, that no one heeded\r\nhis change of demeanour save Mrs. Ashford; and though, when he returned\r\nto the place where he had been standing, his complexion was deepened,\r\nhis lip quivered, and his voice trembled in returning thanks, Mr.\r\nAshford only saw the emotion naturally excited by his people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe lady understood it better; and when she talked it over with her\r\nhusband in the evening, they were convinced the cause of his trouble\r\nmust be some unfortunate attachment, which he might think it his duty\r\nto overcome; and having settled this, they became very fond of him, and\r\nanxious to make Redclyffe agreeable to him.\r\n\r\nCaptain and crew departed; the little boy was better, and his hosts,\r\nCharity and Jem Ledbury, only wished to keep him for ever; the sensation\r\nat Redclyffe was subsiding, when one morning Markham came, in a state of\r\nextreme satisfaction and importance, to exhibit the county paper, with\r\na full account of the gallant conduct of the youthful baronet. Two or\r\nthree days after, on coming home from a ride to Coombe Prior, Guy found\r\nLord Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s card, and heard from Arnaud that \xe2\x80\x98my lord had made\r\nparticular inquiries how long he would be in the country, and had been\r\nto the cliff to see where the wreck was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarkham likewise attached great importance to this visit, and went\r\noff into a long story about his influence, and the representation\r\nof Moorworth, or even of the county. As soon as Guy knew what he was\r\ntalking about, he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I hope all that is not coming on me\r\nyet! Till I can manage Todd and Coombe Prior, I am sure I am not fit to\r\nmanage the country!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA few mornings after, he found on the table an envelope, which\r\nhe studied, as if playing with his eagerness. It had an East-hill\r\npost-mark, and a general air of Hollywell writing, but it was not in the\r\nhand of either of the gentlemen, nor was the tail of the y such as Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone was wont to make. It had even a resemblance to Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nwriting that startled him. He opened it at last, and within found the\r\nhand he could not doubt--Charles\xe2\x80\x99s, namely--much more crooked than\r\nusual, and the words shortened and blotted:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR G.,--I ought not to do this, but I must; I have tyrannized over\r\nCharlotte, and obtained the wherewithal. Write me a full account of your\r\ngallant conduct. I saw it first in A.\xe2\x80\x99s face. It has done you great good\r\nwith my father. I will write more when I can. I can\xe2\x80\x99t get on now. \xe2\x80\x98C. M.\r\nE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nHe might well say he had first seen it in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s face. She had\r\nbrought him the paper, and was looking for something he wanted her to\r\nread to him, when \xe2\x80\x98Redclyffe Bay\xe2\x80\x99 met her eye, and then came the whole\r\nat one delightful glance. He saw the heightened colour, the exquisite\r\nsmile, the tear-drop on the eyelash.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy! what have you there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the place, gave the paper into his hand, and burst into\r\ntears, the gush of triumphant feeling. Not one was shed because she was\r\ndivided from the hero of the shipwreck; they were pure unselfish tears\r\nof joy, exultation, and thankfulness. Charles read the history, and she\r\nlistened in silence; then looked it over again with him, and betrayed\r\nhow thoroughly she had been taught the whole geography of Redclyffe Bay.\r\nThe next person who came in was Charlotte; and as soon as she understood\r\nwhat occupied them, she went into an ecstasy, and flew away with the\r\npaper, rushing with it straight into her father\xe2\x80\x99s room, where she broke\r\ninto the middle of his letter-writing, by reading it in a voice of\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was delighted. He was just the person who would be far\r\nmore taken with an exploit of this kind, such as would make a figure in\r\nthe world, than by steady perseverance in well-doing, and his heart was\r\nwon directly. His wrath at the hasty words had long been diminishing,\r\nand now was absolutely lost in his admiration. \xe2\x80\x98Fine fellow! noble\r\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98He is the bravest boy I ever heard of, but I knew\r\nwhat was in him from the first. I wish from my heart there was not this\r\ncloud over him. I am sure the whole story has not a word of truth in it,\r\nbut he won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word to clear himself, or else we would have him here\r\nagain to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis was the first time Mr. Edmonstone had expressed anything of real\r\ndesire to recall Guy, and it was what Charles meant in his letter.\r\n\r\nThe tyranny over Charlotte was exercised while the rest were at dinner,\r\nand they were alone together. They talked over the adventure for the\r\ntenth time that day, and Charles grew so excited that he vowed that he\r\nmust at once write to Guy, ordered her to give him the materials, and\r\nwhen she hesitated, forced her into it, by declaring that he should get\r\nup and reach the things himself, which would be a great deal worse. She\r\nwanted to write from his dictation, but he would not consent, thinking\r\nthat his mother might not consider it proper, and he began vigorously;\r\nbut though long used to writing in a recumbent posture, he found himself\r\nless capable now than he had expected, and went on soliloquizing thus:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a pen you\xe2\x80\x99ve given me, Charlotte. There goes a blot! Here, another\r\ndip, will you! and take up that with the blotting paper before it\r\nbecomes more like a spider.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you make a fresh beginning?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that has cost me too much already. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no more command over my\r\nfingers. Here we go into the further corner of the paper. Well! C. M. E.\r\nThere \xe2\x80\x98tis--do it up, will you? If he can read it he\xe2\x80\x99ll be lucky. How my\r\narms ache!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it has not hurt you, Charlie; but I am sure he will be very glad\r\nof it. Oh! I am glad you said that about Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who told you to read it, Puss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could not help it, \xe2\x80\x98tis so large.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ _ought_ to have said it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell her I did,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles; \xe2\x80\x98but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of me--or what is more to the\r\npurpose, for the trouble of it--help putting it. He is too true a knight\r\nnot to hear that his lady, not exactly smiled, but cried.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a true knight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, emphatically, as with her best\r\npen, and with infinite satisfaction, she indited the \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy Morville,\r\nBart., Redclyffe Park, Moorworth,\xe2\x80\x99 only wishing she could lengthen out\r\nthe words infinitely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you remember, Charlie, how we sat here the first evening he came,\r\nand you took me in about the deadly feud?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was no take-in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98only the feud is all on one side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, dear! it has been such a stupid winter without Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed\r\nCharlotte; \xe2\x80\x98if this won\xe2\x80\x99t make papa forgive him, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it would, with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98but logically, if\r\nyou understand the word, Charlotte, it does not make much difference to\r\nthe accusation. It would not exactly be received as exculpatory evidence\r\nin a court of justice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the horrid stories?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe that Guy has gamed quite as much as I have myself; but I want\r\nto see him cleared beyond the power of Philip to gainsay or disbelieve\r\nit. I should like to have such a force of proof as would annihilate\r\nPhilip, and if I was anything but what I am, I would have it. If you\r\ncould but lend me a leg for two days, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One thing shall be done,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles: \xe2\x80\x98my father shall go and\r\nmeet him in person when he comes of age. Now Don Philip is out of the\r\nway, I trust I can bring that about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he would but come here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that must not be, as mamma says, till there is some explanation;\r\nbut if I was but in my usual state, I would go with papa and meet him\r\nin London. I wonder if there is any chance of it. The 28th of March--ten\r\nweeks off! If I can but get hold of those trusty crutches of mine by\r\nthat time I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. We will bring back Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknight with flying colours.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh how happy we should be!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I only knew what sort of sense that Markham of his may have, I would\r\ngive him a hint, and set him to ferret out at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. Or shall I\r\nget Dr. Mayerne to order me there for change of air?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo schemed Charles; while Guy, on his side, busied himself at Redclyffe\r\nas usual; took care and thought for the cabin-boy--returned Lord\r\nThorndale\xe2\x80\x99s call without finding him at home--saw the school finished,\r\nand opened--and became more intimate with the Ashfords.\r\n\r\nHe said he should not come home at Easter, as he should be very busy\r\nreading for his degree; and as his birthday this year fell in Holy\r\nWeek, there could be no rejoicings; besides, as he was not to have his\r\nproperty in his own hands till he was five-and-twenty, it would make\r\nno difference to the people. The Ashfords agreed they had rather he was\r\nsafe at home for the vacation, and were somewhat anxious when he spoke\r\nof coming home to settle, after he had taken his degree.\r\n\r\nFor his own part he was glad the season would prevent any rejoicings,\r\nfor he was in no frame of mind to enter into them and his birthday had\r\nbeen so sad a day for his grandfather, that he had no associations of\r\npleasure connected with it.\r\n\r\nMarkham understood the feeling, liked it, and shared it, only saying\r\nthat they would have their day of rejoicing when he married. Guy could\r\nnot answer, and the old steward remarked the look of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98is it that which is wrong with you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry\r\nwith an old man for asking the question, but I only would hope and trust\r\nyou are not getting into any scrape.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Markham,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, after an effort; \xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell you\r\nabout it. I will only set you at rest by saying it is nothing you could\r\nthink I ought to be ashamed of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then why--what has come between? What could man or woman object to in\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham, regarding him proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These unhappy suspicions,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham. \xe2\x80\x98You must have been doing something\r\nfoolish to give rise to them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy told nearly what he had said on the first day of his return, but\r\nnothing could be done towards clearing up the mystery, and he returned\r\nto Oxford as usual.\r\n\r\nMarch commenced, and Charles, though no longer absolutely recumbent, and\r\nable to write letters again, could not yet attempt to use his crutches,\r\nso that all his designs vanished, except that of persuading his father\r\nto go to London to meet Guy and Markham there, and transact the business\r\nconsequent on his ward\xe2\x80\x99s attaining his majority. He trusted much to\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s personal influence, and said to his father, \xe2\x80\x98You know no one has\r\nseen him yet but Philip, and he would tell things to you that he might\r\nnot to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was an argument that delighted Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I have more weight and experience, and--and poor Guy is very\r\nfond of us. Eh, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo Charles wrote to make an appointment for Guy to meet his guardian and\r\nMarkham in London on Easter Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x98If you will clear up the gambling\r\nstory,\xe2\x80\x99 he wrote, \xe2\x80\x98all may yet be well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy sighed as he laid aside the letter. \xe2\x80\x98All in vain, kind Charlie,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he to himself, \xe2\x80\x98vain as are my attempts to keep my poor uncle\r\nfrom sinking himself further! Is it fair, though,\xe2\x80\x99 continued he, with\r\nvehemence, \xe2\x80\x98that the happiness of at least one life should be sacrificed\r\nto hide one step in the ruin of a man who will not let himself be saved?\r\nIs it not a waste of self-devotion? Have I any right to sacrifice hers?\r\nOught I not rather\xe2\x80\x99--and a flash of joy came over him--\xe2\x80\x98to make my uncle\r\ngive me back my promise of concealment? I can make it up to him. It\r\ncannot injure him, since only the Edmonstones will know it! But\xe2\x80\x99--and\r\nhe pressed his lips firmly together--\xe2\x80\x98is this the spirit I have been\r\nstruggling for this whole winter? Did I not see that patient waiting and\r\nyielding is fit penance for my violence. It would be ungenerous. I will\r\nwait and bear, contented that Heaven knows my innocence at least in\r\nthis. For her, when at my best I dreaded that my love might bring sorrow\r\non her--how much more now, when I have seen my doom face to face,\r\nand when the first step towards her would be what I cannot openly and\r\nabsolutely declare to be right? That would be the very means of bringing\r\nthe suffering on her, and I should deserve it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy quitted these thoughts to write to Markham to make the appointment,\r\nfinishing his letter with a request that Markham would stop at St.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s on his way to London, and pay Miss Wellwood, the lady with\r\nwhom his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was placed, for her quarter\xe2\x80\x99s board. \xe2\x80\x98I hope\r\nthis will not be a very troublesome request,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but I know\r\nyou had rather I did it in this way, than disobey your maxims, as to not\r\nsending money by the post.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe time before the day of meeting was spent in strengthening himself\r\nagainst the pain it would be to refuse his confidence to Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nand thus to throw away the last chance of reconciliation, and of Amy.\r\nThis would be the bitterest pang of all--to see them ready to receive\r\nhim, and he forced to reject their kindness.\r\n\r\nSo passed the preceding week, and with it his twenty-first birthday,\r\nspent very differently from the way in which it would ordinarily be\r\npassed by a youth in his position. It went by in hard study and sad\r\nmusings, in bracing himself to a resolution that would cost him all he\r\nheld dear, and, as the only means of so bracing himself, in trying to\r\nfix his gaze more steadily beyond the earth.\r\n\r\nEaster day steadied the gaze once more for him, and as the past week had\r\nnerved him in the spirit of self-sacrifice, the feast day brought him\r\ntrue unchanging joy, shining out of sadness, and enlightening the path\r\nthat would lead him to keep his resolution to the utmost, and endure the\r\nwant of earthly hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25\r\n\r\n     Already in thy spirit thus divine,\r\n     Whatever weal or woe betide,\r\n     Be that high sense of duty still thy guide,\r\n     And all good powers will aid a soul like thine.\r\n                                       --SOUTHEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now for it!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Guy, as he dismissed his cab, and was shown\r\nup-stairs in the hotel. \xe2\x80\x98Give me the strength to withstand!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, and he beheld Mr. Edmonstone, Markham, and\r\nanother--it surely was Sebastian Dixon! All sprung up to receive him;\r\nand Mr. Edmonstone, seizing him by both hands, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here he is himself! Guy, my boy, my dear boy, you are the most generous\r\nfellow in the world! You have been used abominably. I wish my two hands\r\nhad been cut off before I was persuaded to write that letter, but it is\r\nall right now. Forget and forgive--eh, Guy? You\xe2\x80\x99ll come home with me,\r\nand we will write this very day for Deloraine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was almost giddy with surprise. He held one of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, and pressed it hard; his other hand he passed over his eyes, as\r\nif in a dream. \xe2\x80\x98All right?\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I know where your money went, and I\r\nhonour you for it, and there stands the man who told me the whole story.\r\nI said, from the first, it was a confounded slander. It was all owing to\r\nthe little girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy turned his face in amazement towards his uncle, who was only waiting\r\nto explain. \xe2\x80\x98Never till this morning had I the least suspicion that I\r\nhad been the means of bringing you under any imputation. How could you\r\nkeep me in ignorance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have told--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of the cheque,\xe2\x80\x99 broke in Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98and of all the rest, and\r\nof your providing for the little girl. How could you do it with that\r\npittance of an allowance of yours? And Master Philip saying you never\r\nhad any money! No wonder, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had known you were pinching yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dixon, \xe2\x80\x98my mind would\r\nhave revolted--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me understand it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, grasping the back of a chair. \xe2\x80\x98Tell\r\nme, Markham. Is it really so? Am I cleared? Has Mr. Edmonstone a right\r\nto be satisfied?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Sir Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 was Markham\xe2\x80\x99s direct answer. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Dixon has accounted\r\nfor your disposal of the thirty pound cheque, and there is an end of the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy drew a long breath, and the convulsive grasp of his fingers relaxed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot thank you enough!\xe2\x80\x99 said he to his uncle; then to Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98how is Charles?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better--much better, you shall see him to-morrow--eh, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I cannot explain about the one thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind--you never had it, so you can\xe2\x80\x99t have misspent it. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneither here nor there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you forgive my language respecting you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense about that! If you never said anything worse than that Philip\r\nwas a meddling coxcomb, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t much to repent of; and I am sure I\r\nwas ten old fools when I let him bore me into writing that letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; you did right under your belief; and circumstances were strong\r\nagainst me. And is it clear? Are we where we were before?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are--we are in everything, only we know better what you are worth,\r\nGuy. Shake hands once more. There\xe2\x80\x99s an end of all misunderstanding and\r\nvexation, and we shall be all right at home again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shake was a mighty one. Guy shaded his face for a moment or two, and\r\nthen said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is too much. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. How did you know this matter\r\nwanted explanation?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, turning to his uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I learnt it from Mr. Markham, and you will do me the justice to\r\nbelieve, that I was greatly shocked to find that your generosity--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The truth of the matter is this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham. \xe2\x80\x98You sent me to Miss\r\nWellwood\xe2\x80\x99s, at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. The principal was not within, and while\r\nwaiting for her to make the payment, I got into conversation with her\r\nsister, Miss Jane. She told me that the child, Mr. Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s daughter,\r\nwas always talking of your kindness, especially of a morning at St.\r\nMildred\xe2\x80\x99s, when you helped him in some difficulty. I thought this threw\r\nsome light on the matter, found out Mr. Dixon this morning, and you see\r\nthe result.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I wish I could attempt to thank you all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thanks enough for me to see you look like yourself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham. \xe2\x80\x98Did\r\nyou think I was going to sit still and leave you in the mess you had got\r\nyourself into, with your irregularity about keeping your accounts?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And to you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking at his uncle, as if it was especially\r\npleasant to be obliged to him. \xe2\x80\x98You never can guess what I owe to you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, I deserve no thanks at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Sebastian, \xe2\x80\x98since I was the\r\nmeans of bringing the imputation on you; and I am sure it is enough for\r\na wretch like me, not to have brought only misery wherever I turn--to\r\nhave done something to repair the evil I have caused. Oh, could I but\r\nbring back your father to what he was when first I saw him as you are\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was getting into one of those violent fits of self-reproach, at once\r\ngenuine and theatrical, of which Guy had a sort of horror, and it was\r\nwell Mr. Edmonstone broke in, like comedy into tragedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, what\xe2\x80\x99s past can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, and I have no end of work to be\r\ndone, so there\xe2\x80\x99s speechifying enough for once. Mr. Dixon, you must not\r\nbe going. Sit down and look over the newspaper, while we sign these\r\npapers. You must dine with us, and drink your nephew\xe2\x80\x99s health, though it\r\nis not his real birthday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was much pleased that Mr. Edmonstone should have given this\r\ninvitation, as well as with the consideration Markham had shown for\r\nDixon in his narration. Mr. Dixon, who had learnt to consider parents\r\nand guardians as foes and tyrants, stammered and looked confused\r\nand enraptured; but it appeared that he could not stay, for he had a\r\nprofessional engagement. He gave them an exhortation to come to the\r\nconcert where he was employed, and grew so ardent in his description of\r\nit, that Guy could have wished to go; but his companions were in haste\r\nto say there was far too much to do. And the next moment Guy told\r\nhimself, that Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s good-natured face and joyous \xe2\x80\x98eh, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwere more to him than any music he could hear nearer than Hollywell.\r\n\r\nHe went down-stairs with his uncle, who all the way raved about the\r\nmusic, satisfied to find ears that could comprehend, and was too full of\r\nit even to attend or respond to the parting thanks, for his last words\r\nwere something about a magnificent counter-tenor.\r\n\r\nGuy walked up slowly, trying to gather his thoughts: but when it came\r\nback to him that Amy was his again, his brain seemed to reel with\r\necstasy, and it would have taken far more time than he could spare to\r\nrecall his sober senses, so he opened the door, to convince himself at\r\nleast of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s presence, and was received with another shake\r\nof the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So here you are again. I was afraid he was carrying you off to his\r\nconcert after all! I believe you have half a mind for it. Do you like\r\nto stay in London for the next? Eh, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 and it was good to hear Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s hearty laugh, as he patted his ward on the shoulder, saw\r\nhis blushing, smiling shake of the head, and gave a knowing look, which\r\nlet in a fresh light on Markham, and luckily was unseen by Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98the man is more gentlemanlike than I\r\nexpected. A good sort of fellow at the bottom, I dare say. He was pretty\r\nconsiderably shocked to find he had brought you into such a scrape.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is very generous,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, there is much of a noble character\r\nin him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Noble! humph!\xe2\x80\x99 put in Markham. \xe2\x80\x98He has gone down-hill fast enough,\r\nsince I used to see him in your father\xe2\x80\x99s time; but I am glad he had the\r\ndecency not to be the undoing of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His feeling is his great point,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98when you can once get at\r\nit. I wish--\xe2\x80\x99 But breaking off short, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it out. What did\r\nlittle Marianne tell you? Or was it Miss Wellwood?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was first the youngest sister,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham. \xe2\x80\x98I sat there talking\r\nto her some little time; she said you had been very kind to the family,\r\nand the child was very grateful to you--was always talking of some\r\nmorning when you and your dog came, and helped her mother. Her father\r\nhad been out all night, and her mother was crying, she said, and\r\ndeclaring he would be sent to prison, till you came and helped them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I remembered what you had told me of the mystery of the draft,\r\nand guessed that this might be the clue to it. I begged to see the\r\nchild, and in she came, the very image of your mother, and a sharp\r\nlittle thing that knew what she meant, but had not much idea of the\r\nshame, poor child, about her father. She told me the story of his coming\r\nhome in the morning, and her mother being in great distress, and saying\r\nthey were ruined, till you came and talked to her mother, and gave her\r\nsomething. I asked if it was money, and she said it was paper. I showed\r\nher a draft, and she knew it was like that. So then I made her tell me\r\nwhere to find her father, whom I used to know in old times, and had to\r\nwrite to, now and then. I hunted him up, and a creditable figure he was,\r\nto be sure; but I got the truth out of him at last, and when he heard\r\nyou had got into disgrace on his account, he raved like a tragedy hero,\r\nand swore he would come and tell your guardian the whole story. I put\r\nhim into a cab for fear he should repent, and he had just got to the end\r\nof it when you came in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is of no use to thank you again, Markham!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, I have been getting your family out of scrapes these forty years\r\nor thereabouts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham; \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99tis all I am good for; and if they had\r\nbeen no worse than this one it would be better for all of us. But time\r\nis getting on, and there is enough to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo the accounts they went at once. There was a good deal to be settled;\r\nand though Guy had as yet no legal power, according to his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwill, he was of course consulted about everything. He was glad that,\r\nsince he could not be alone to bring himself to the realization of his\r\nnewly-recovered happiness, he should have this sobering and engrossing\r\noccupation. There he sat, coolly discussing leases and repairs, and only\r\nnow and then allowing himself a sort of glimpse at the treasury of\r\njoy awaiting him whenever he had time to dwell on it. The Coombe Prior\r\nmatters were set in a better train, the preliminary arrangements about\r\nthe curacy were made, and Guy had hopes it would be his friend Mr.\r\nWellwood\xe2\x80\x99s title for Orders.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to write to Hollywell, or rather Mr. Edmonstone forgot\r\nto do so till it was too late, and then consoled himself by observing\r\nthat it did not signify if his family were taken by surprise, since joy\r\nkilled no one.\r\n\r\nHis family were by no means of opinion that it did not signify when the\r\nnext morning\xe2\x80\x99s post brought them no letter. Mrs Edmonstone and Charles\r\nhad hoped much, and Amy did not know how much she hoped until the\r\nmelancholy words, \xe2\x80\x98no letter,\xe2\x80\x99 passed from one to the other.\r\n\r\nTo make it worse, by some of those mismanagements of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhich used to run counter to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements, a dinner-party had\r\nbeen fixed for this identical Wednesday, and the prospect was agreeable\r\nto no one, especially when the four o\xe2\x80\x99clock train did not bring Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, who, therefore, was not to be expected till seven, when all\r\nthe world would be arrived.\r\n\r\nLaura helped Amy to dress, put the flowers in her hair, kissed her, and\r\ntold her it was a trying day; and Amy sighed wearily, thanked her, and\r\nwent down with arms twined in hers, whispering, \xe2\x80\x98If I could help being\r\nso foolish as to let myself have a little hope!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura thought the case so hopeless, that she was sorry Amy could not\r\ncease from the foolishness, and did not answer. Amy sat down at the foot\r\nof the sofa, whither Charles was now carried down every day, and without\r\nventuring to look at him, worked at her netting. A carriage--her\r\ncolour came and went, but it was only some of the guests; another--the\r\nBrownlows. Amy was speaking to Miss Brownlow when she heard more\r\ngreetings; she looked up, caught by the arm of the sofa, and looked\r\nagain. Her father was pouring out apologies and welcomes, and her mother\r\nwas shaking hands with Guy.\r\n\r\nWas it a dream? She shut her eyes, then looked again. He was close to\r\nher by this time, she felt his fingers close on her white glove for\r\none moment, but she only heard his voice in the earnest \xe2\x80\x98How are you,\r\nCharlie?\xe2\x80\x99 Her father came to her, gave her first his usual kiss of\r\ngreeting, then, not letting her go, looked at her for a moment, and, as\r\nif he could not help it, kissed her on both cheeks, and said, \xe2\x80\x98How d\xe2\x80\x99ye\r\ndo, my little Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 in a voice that meant unutterable things. All the\r\nroom was swimming round; there was nothing for it but to run away, and\r\nshe ran, but from the ante-room she heard the call outside, \xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbag to his room,\xe2\x80\x99 and she could not rush out among the servants. At that\r\nmoment, however, she spied Mary Ross and her father; she darted up to\r\nthem, said something incoherent about Mary\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet, and took her up to\r\nher own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, my dear, you look wild. What has come to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa is come home, and--\xe2\x80\x99 the rest failed, and Amy was as red as the\r\ncamellia in her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And?\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Mary, \xe2\x80\x98and the mystery is explained?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; they are only just come, and I was so silly, I ran\r\naway,--I did not know what to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_They_ are come, are they?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mary. \xe2\x80\x98My little Amy, I see it\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe made the taking off her bonnet and the settling her lace as\r\nelaborate an operation as she could, and Amy flitted about as if she did\r\nnot by any means know what she was doing. A springy, running step was\r\nheard on the stairs and in the passage, and Mary, though she could not\r\nsee her little friend\xe2\x80\x99s face, perceived her neck turn red for a moment,\r\nafter which Amy took her arm, pressed it affectionately, and they went\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was very glad to see Amabel looking tolerably natural.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma\xe2\x80\x99 was of course burning to hear all, but she was so confident that\r\nthe essentials were safe, that her present care was to see how her two\r\nyoung lovers would be able to comport themselves, and to be on her guard\r\nagainst attending to them more than to her guests.\r\n\r\nAmy, after passing by Charles, and getting a squeeze from his\r\never-sympathizing hand, put herself away behind Mary, while Laura talked\r\nto every one, hoping to show that there was some self-possession in the\r\nfamily. Guy reappeared, but, after one glance to see if Amy was present,\r\nhe did not look at her again, but went and leant over the lower end of\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s sofa, just as he used to do; and Charles lay gazing at him,\r\nand entirely forgetting what he had been trying to say just before to\r\nMrs. Brownlow, professing to have come from London that morning,\r\nand making the absent mistakes likely to be attributed to the lovers\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone came, and dinner followed. As Mrs. Edmonstone paired off\r\nher company, she considered what to do with her new arrival.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you had come two hours ago,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, within herself, \xe2\x80\x98I would have\r\nlet you be at home. Now you must be a great man, and be content with me.\r\nIt will be better for Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAccordingly Guy was between her and Mrs. Gresham. She did not try\r\nto speak to him, and was amused by his fitful attempts at making\r\nconversation with Mrs. Gresham, when it struck him that he ought to be\r\ntaking notice of her. Amy (very fortunately, in her own opinion) was out\r\nof sight of him, on the same side of the table, next to Mr. Ross, who,\r\nlike his daughter, guessed enough about the state of things to let her\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nCharles was enjoying all manner of delightful conjectures with\r\nCharlotte, till the ladies returned to the drawing-room, and then he\r\nsaid as much as he dared to Mary Ross, far more than she had gained from\r\nLaura, who, as they came out of the dining-room, had said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me any questions, for I know nothing at all about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy was talked to by Mrs. Gresham about club-books, and new flowers, to\r\nwhich she was by this time able to attend very well, satisfied that\r\nhis happiness had returned, and content to wait till the good time for\r\nknowing how. She could even be composed when the gentlemen came in, Guy\r\ntalking to Mr. Ross about Coombe Prior, and then going to Charles; but\r\npresently she saw no more, for a request for music was made, and she was\r\nobliged to go and play a duet with Laura. She did not dislike this, but\r\nthere followed a persecution for some singing. Laura would have spared\r\nher, but could not; and while she was turning over the book to try to\r\nfind something that was not impossible to begin, and Laura whispering\r\nencouragingly, \xe2\x80\x98This--try this--your part is almost nothing; or can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou do this?\xe2\x80\x99 another hand turned over the leaves, as if perfectly at\r\nhome in them, and, without speaking, as if it was natural for him to\r\nspare Amy, found a song which they had often sung together, where she\r\nmight join as much or as little as she chose, under cover of his voice.\r\nShe had not a thought or sensation beyond the joy of hearing it again,\r\nand she stood, motionless, as if in a trance. When it was over, he said\r\nto Laura, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon for making such bad work. I am so much out\r\nof practice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Brownlow was seen advancing on them; Amy retreated, leaving Guy\r\nand Laura to fulfil all that was required of them, which they did with\r\na very good grace, and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s old familiar feeling began to revive,\r\nso much that she whispered while he was finding the place, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ndislike all this excessively?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It does as well as anything else, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer. \xe2\x80\x98I can do\r\nit better than talking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt last they were released, and the world was going away. Mary could not\r\nhelp whispering to Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98How glad you must be to get rid of\r\nus!\xe2\x80\x99 and, as Mrs. Edmonstone answered with a smile, she ventured further\r\nto say,--\xe2\x80\x98How beautifully Amy has behaved!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLittle Amy, as soon as she had heard the last carriage roll off, wished\r\nevery one good night, shook hands with Guy, holding up the lighted\r\ncandle between him and her face as a veil, and ran away to her own room.\r\nThe others remained in a sort of embarrassed silence, Mr. Edmonstone\r\nrubbing his hands; Laura lighted the candles, Charlotte asked after\r\nBustle, and was answered that he was at Oxford, and Charles, laying hold\r\nof the side of the sofa, pulled himself by it into a sitting posture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I help you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, but I am not ready yet; besides, I am an actual log now, and\r\nam carried as such, so it is of no use to wait for me. Mamma shall have\r\nthe first turn, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t even leave my door open.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, yes; go and have it out with mamma, next best to Amy herself,\r\nas she is run away--eh, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\nGuy and Mrs. Edmonstone had not hitherto trusted themselves to speak\r\nto each other, but they looked and smiled; then, wishing the rest good\r\nnight, they disappeared. Then there was a simultaneous outbreak of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Every word was untrue. He is the\r\nnoblest fellow in the world, as I knew all the time, and I was an old\r\nfool for listening to a pack of stories against him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hurrah!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles, drumming on the back of his sofa. \xe2\x80\x98Let us hear\r\nhow the truth came out, and what it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was that Dixon. There has he been helping that man for ever, sending\r\nhis child to school, giving him sums upon sums, paying his gaming debts\r\nwith that cheque!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, oh!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes that was it! The child told Markham of it, and Markham brought\r\nthe father to tell me. It puts me in a rage to think of the monstrous\r\nstories Philip has made me believe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was sure of it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I knew it would come out that he had\r\nonly been so much better than other people that nobody could believe it.\r\nCleared! cleared! Why, Charlotte, Mr. Ready-to-halt will be for footing\r\nit cleverly enough!\xe2\x80\x99 as she was wildly curvetting round him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was always sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I knew it was not in him to\r\ngo wrong. It was only Philip, who would persuade me black was white.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never believed one word of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98still less after I saw\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s animosity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cLes absens ont toujours tort,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Laura; then, afraid of\r\nsaying too much, she added,--\xe2\x80\x98Come, Charlotte, it is very late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I shall be the first to tell Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98Good night,\r\npapa!--good night, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rushed up-stairs, afraid of being forestalled. Laura lingered,\r\nputting some books away in the ante-room, trying to overcome the weary\r\npain at her heart. She did not know how to be confident. Her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgment was worthless in her eyes, and Philip had predicted that Amy\r\nwould be sacrificed after all. To see them happy made her sigh at the\r\ndistance of her own hopes, and worse than all was self-reproach\r\nfor unkindness in not rejoicing with the rest, in spite of her real\r\naffection for Guy himself. When she thought of him, she could not\r\nbelieve him guilty; when she thought of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s belief, she could not\r\nsuppose him innocent, and she pitied her sister for enjoying a delusive\r\nhappiness. With effort, however, she went to her room, and, finding her\r\na little overpowered by Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s tumultuous joy, saw that peace\r\nand solitude were best for her till she could have more certain\r\nintelligence, and, after very tender good-nights, carried off Charlotte.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to describe Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s emotion, as she preceded\r\nGuy to the dressing-room, and sat down, looking up to him as he stood in\r\nhis old place by the fire. She thought he did not look well, though it\r\nmight be only that the sun-burnt colour had given place to his natural\r\nfairness; his eyes, though bright as ever, did not dance and sparkle;\r\na graver expression sat on his brow; and although he still looked very\r\nyoung, a change there certainly was, which made him man instead of\r\nboy--a look of having suffered, and conquered suffering. She felt even\r\nmore motherly affection for him now than when he last stood there in the\r\nfull tide of his first outburst of his love for her daughter, and her\r\nheart was almost too full for speech; but he seemed to be waiting for\r\nher, and at last she said,--\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to have you here again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little, then said, \xe2\x80\x98May I tell you all about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sit down here. I want very much to hear it. I am sure you have gone\r\nthrough a good deal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n I have, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, simply and gravely; and there was a silence,\r\nwhile she was certain that, whatever he might have endured, he did not\r\nfeel it to have been in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But it is at an end,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98I have scarcely seen Mr. Edmonstone,\r\nbut he tells me he is perfectly satisfied.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is so kind as to be satisfied, though you know I still cannot\r\nexplain about the large sum I asked him for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will trust you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98but I am very\r\nanxious to hear how you came to an understanding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy went over the story in detail, and very much affected she was to\r\nhear how entirely unfounded had been the suspicion, and how thankful he\r\nwas for Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had rather to forgive us!\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You forget how ill I behaved,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, colouring. \xe2\x80\x98If you knew the\r\nmadness of those first moments of provocation, you would think that the\r\npenance of a lifetime, instead of only one winter, would scarce have\r\nbeen sufficient.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not say, as Charles does, that the suspicion justified your\r\nanger?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed!\xe2\x80\x99 He paused, and spoke again. \xe2\x80\x98Thank Heaven, it did not last\r\nlong; but the insight it gave me into the unsubdued evil about me was a\r\nfearful thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you conquered it. They were the unguarded exclamations of the first\r\nshock. Your whole conduct since, especially the interview with Philip,\r\nhas shown that your anger has not been abiding, and that you have learnt\r\nto subdue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It could not abide, for there was no just cause of offence. Of course\r\nsuch a dreadful outburst warned me to be on my guard; and you know the\r\nvery sight of Philip is a warning that there is danger in that way! I\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, becoming conscious that he had been very severe, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nmean that I know of old that I am apt to be worried by his manner, and\r\nthat ought to make me doubly cautious.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was struck by the soberer manner in which he spoke\r\nof his faults. He was as ready to take full blame, but without the\r\nvehemence which he used to expend in raving at himself instead of at the\r\noffender. It seemed as if he had brought himself to the tone he used to\r\ndesire so earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad to be able to explain all to Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will write as soon as possible. Oh, Mrs. Edmonstone! if you knew what\r\nit is to be brought back to such unhoped-for happiness, to sit here\r\nonce more, with you,\xe2\x80\x99--his voice trembled, and the tears were in her\r\neyes,--\xe2\x80\x98to have seen _her_, to have all overlooked, and return to all I\r\nhoped last year. I want to look at you all, to believe that it is true,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe finished, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You both behaved very well this evening,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, laughing, because\r\nshe could do so better than anything else at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You both!\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Guy to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! little Amy has been very good this winter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answered her with a beautiful expression of his eyes, was silent a\r\nlittle while, and suddenly exclaimed, in a candid, expostulating tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now, seriously, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it a very bad thing for her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, scarcely repressing a disposition to laugh, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ntold you last summer what I thought of it, and you must settle the rest\r\nwith Amy to-morrow. I hear the drawing-room bell, which is a sign I must\r\nsend you to bed. Good night!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night!\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Guy, as he held her hand. \xe2\x80\x98It is so long since I\r\nhave had any one to wish me good night! Good night, mamma!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand, then as he ran down to lend a helping hand in\r\ncarrying Charles, she, the tears in her eyes, crossed the passage to see\r\nhow it was with her little Amy, and to set her at rest for the night.\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s candle was out, and she was in bed, lying full in the light of the\r\nEaster moon, which poured in glorious whiteness through her window. She\r\nstarted up as the door opened. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, mamma! how kind of you to come!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can only stay a moment, my dear; your papa is coming up; but I must\r\njust tell you that I have been having such a nice talk with dear Guy.\r\nHe has behaved beautifully, and papa is quite satisfied. Now, darling,\r\nI hope you will not lie awake all night, or you won\xe2\x80\x99t be fit to talk to\r\nhim to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy sat up in bed, and put her arms round her mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x98Then he is\r\nhappy again,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered. \xe2\x80\x98I should like to hear all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He shall tell you himself to-morrow, my dear. Now, good night! you have\r\nbeen a very good child. Now, go to sleep, my dear one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy lay down obediently. \xe2\x80\x98Thank you for coming to tell me, dear mamma,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said. \xe2\x80\x98I am very glad; good night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes, and there was something in the sweet, obedient,\r\nplacid look of her face, as the white moonlight shone upon it, that made\r\nher mother pause and gaze again with the feeling, only tenderer, left\r\nby a beautiful poem. Amy looked up to see why she delayed; she gave her\r\nanother kiss, and left her in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nLittle Amy\xe2\x80\x99s instinct was to believe the best and do as she was bidden,\r\nand there was a quietness and confidence in the tone of her mind which\r\ngave a sort of serenity of its own even to suspense. A thankful, happy\r\nsensation that all was well, mamma said so, and Guy was there, had taken\r\npossession of her, and she did not agitate herself to know how or why,\r\nfor mamma, had told her to put herself to sleep; so she thought of all\r\nthe most thanksgiving verses of her store of poetry, and before the\r\nmoon had passed away from her window, Amabel Edmonstone was wrapped in a\r\nsleep dreamless and tranquil as an infant\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 26\r\n\r\n     Hence, bashful cunning,\r\n     And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.\r\n     I am your wife if you will marry me.\r\n                                 --TEMPEST\r\n\r\n\r\nAmabel awoke to such a sense of relief and repose that she scarcely\r\nliked to ask herself the cause, lest it might ruffle her complete peace.\r\nThose words \xe2\x80\x98all right,\xe2\x80\x99 seemed to be enough to assure her that the\r\ncloud was gone.\r\n\r\nHer mother came in, told her one or two of the main facts, and took her\r\ndown under her wing, only stopping by the way for a greeting to Charles,\r\nwho could not rise till after breakfast. He held her fast, and gazed up\r\nin her face, but she coloured so deeply, cast down her eyes, and looked\r\nso meek and submissive, that he let her go, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast party were for the most part quiet, silent, and happy.\r\nEven Charlotte was hushed by the subdued feeling of the rest, and Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s hilarity, though replied to in turn by each, failed to wake\r\nthem into mirth. Guy ran up and down-stairs continually, to wait upon\r\nCharles; and thus the conversation was always interrupted as fast as it\r\nbegan, so that the only fact that came out was the cause of the lateness\r\nof their arrival yesterday. Mr. Edmonstone had taken it for granted that\r\nGuy, like Philip, would watch for the right time, and warn him, while\r\nGuy, being excessively impatient, had been so much afraid of letting\r\nhimself fidget, as to have suffered the right moment to pass, and then\r\nborne all the blame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How you must have wanted to play the Harmonious Blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I caught myself going through the motions twice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone said to herself that he might contest the palm of temper\r\nwith Amy even; the difference being, that hers was naturally sweet, his\r\na hasty one, so governed that the result was the same. When breakfast\r\nwas over, as they were rising, Guy made two steps towards Amabel,\r\nat whom he had hitherto scarcely looked, and said, very low, in his\r\nstraightforward way: \xe2\x80\x98Can I speak to you a little while?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s face glowed as she moved towards him, and her mother said\r\nsomething about the drawing-room, where the next moment she found\r\nherself. She did not use any little restless arts to play with her\r\nembarrassment; she did not torment the flowers or the chimney ornaments,\r\nnor even her own rings, she stood with her hands folded and her head a\r\nlittle bent down, like a pendant blossom, ready to listen to whatever\r\nmight be said to her.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak at first, but moved uneasily about. At last he came\r\nnearer, and began speaking fast and nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amabel, I want you to consider--you really ought to think whether this\r\nis not a very bad thing for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe drooping head was raised, the downcast lids lifted up, and the\r\nblue eyes fixed on him with a look at once confiding and wondering. He\r\nproceeded--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have brought you nothing but unhappiness already. So far as you have\r\ntaken any interest in me, it could cause you only pain, and the more I\r\nthink of it, the more unfit it seems that one so formed for light, and\r\njoy, and innocent mirth, should have anything to do with the darkness\r\nthat is round me. Think well of it. I feel as if I had done a selfish\r\nthing by you, and now, you know, you are not bound. You are quite free!\r\nNo one knows anything about it, or if they did, the blame would rest\r\nentirely with me. I would take care it should. So, Amy, think, and think\r\nwell, before you risk your happiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to that,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Amy, in a soft, low voice, with _such_ a look of\r\ntruth in her clear eyes, \xe2\x80\x98I must care for whatever happens to you, and\r\nI had rather it was with you, than without you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, casting them\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Amy!--my own!--my Verena!\xe2\x80\x99--and he held fast one of her hands, as\r\nthey sat together on the sofa--\xe2\x80\x98I had a feeling that so it might be\r\nthrough the very worst, yet I can hardly believe it now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, looking up, with the gentle resolution that had lately\r\ngrown on her, \xe2\x80\x98you must not take me for more than I am worth, and I\r\nshould like to tell you fairly. I did not speak last time, because\r\nit was all so strange and so delightful, and I had no time to think,\r\nbecause I was so confused. But that is a long time ago, and this has\r\nbeen a very sad winter, and I have thought a great deal. I know, and you\r\nknow, too, that I am a foolish little thing; I have been silly little\r\nAmy always; you and Charlie have helped me to all the sense I have, and\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could ever be a clever, strong-minded woman, such as one\r\nadmires.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Heaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Guy; moved, perhaps, by a certain\r\nremembrance of St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Amy, \xe2\x80\x98I believe I do really wish to be good, and I know\r\nyou have helped me to wish it much more, and I have been trying to learn\r\nto bear things, and so\xe2\x80\x99--out came something, very like a sunny smile,\r\nthough some tears followed--\xe2\x80\x98so if you do like such a silly little\r\nthing, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped, and we will try to make the best of her. Only\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t say any more about my being happier without you, for one thing I\r\nam very sure of, Guy, I had rather bear anything with you, than know you\r\nwere bearing it alone. I am only afraid of being foolish and weak, and\r\nmaking things worse for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So much worse! But still,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98speak as you may, my Amy, I\r\ncannot, must not, feel that I have a right to think of you as my own,\r\ntill you have heard all. You ought to know what my temper is before you\r\nrisk yourself in its power. Amy, my first thought towards Philip was\r\nnothing short of murder.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes, and saw how far entirely he meant what he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The first--not the second,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the second--the third. There was a moment when I could have given\r\nmy soul for my revenge!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a moment!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only a moment, thank Heaven! and I have not done quite so badly since.\r\nI hope I have not suffered quite in vain; but if that shock could\r\noverthrow all my wonted guards, it might, though I pray Heaven it may\r\nnot, it might happen again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you conquered yourself then, and that you will again,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And suppose I was ever to be mad enough to be angry with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy smiled outright here. \xe2\x80\x98Of course, I should deserve it; but I think\r\nthe trouble would be the comforting you afterwards. Mamma said\xe2\x80\x99--she\r\nadded, after a long silence, during which Guy\xe2\x80\x99s feeling would not let\r\nhim speak--\xe2\x80\x98mamma said, and I think, that you are much safer and better\r\nwith such a quick temper as yours, because you are always struggling and\r\nfighting with it, on the real true religious ground, than a person more\r\neven tempered by nature, but not so much in earnest in doing right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if I did not believe myself to be in earnest about that, I could\r\nnever dare to speak to you at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will help each other,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98you have always helped me, long\r\nbefore we knew we cared for each other!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Amy, if you knew how the thought of you helped me last winter,\r\neven when I thought I had forfeited you for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTheir talk only ceased when, at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mrs. Edmonstone, who had\r\npronounced in the dressing-room that three hours was enough for them\r\nat once, came in, and asked Guy to go and help to carry Charles\r\ndown-stairs.\r\n\r\nHe went, and Amy nestled up to her mother, raising her face to be\r\nkissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very nice!\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered; and then arranged her brother\xe2\x80\x99s sofa,\r\nas she heard his progress down-stairs beginning. He was so light and\r\nthin as to be very easily carried, and was brought in between Guy\r\nand one of the servants. When he was settled on the sofa, he began\r\nthus,--\xe2\x80\x98There was a grand opportunity lost last winter. I was\r\ncontinually rehearsing the scene, and thinking what waste it was to go\r\nthrough such a variety of torture without the dignity of danger. If I\r\ncould but have got up ever so small an alarm, I would have conjured my\r\nfather to send for Guy, entreated pathetically that the reconciliation\r\nmight be effected, and have drawn my last breath clasping their hands,\r\nthus! The curtain falls!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made a feint of joining their hands, put his head back, and shut his\r\neyes with an air and a grace that put Charlotte into an ecstasy, and\r\nmade even Amy laugh, as she quitted the room, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if it had been your last breath,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98you would not\r\nhave been much the wiser.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would have come to life again in time to enjoy the \xe2\x80\x9ccoup de theatre\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\nI had some thoughts of trying an overdose of opium; but I thought Dr.\r\nMayerne would have found me out. I tell you, because it is fair I\r\nshould have the credit; for, Guy, if you knew what she was to me all the\r\nwinter, you would perceive my superhuman generosity in not receiving you\r\nas my greatest enemy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall soon cease to be surprised at any superhuman generosity,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy. \xe2\x80\x98But how thin you are, Charlie; you are a very feather to carry; I\r\nhad no notion it had been such a severe business.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Most uncommon!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, shaking his head, with a mock solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was the worst of all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98six weeks of constant\r\npain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very sorry Philip must have been!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, was it not owing to him? Surely, your father told me so. Did not\r\nhe let you fall on the stairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear father!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles, laughing; \xe2\x80\x98every disaster that\r\nhappens for the next twelvemonth will be imputed to Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was it, then?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fact was this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98it was in the thick of the\r\npersecution of you, and I was obliged to let Philip drag me upstairs,\r\nbecause I was in a hurry. He took the opportunity of giving me some\r\nimpertinent advice which I could not stand. I let go his arm, forgetting\r\nwhat a dependent mortal I am, and down I should assuredly have gone, if\r\nhe had not caught me, and carried me off, as a fox does a goose, so\r\nit was his fault, as one may say, in a moral, though not in a physical\r\nsense.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said his mother, \xe2\x80\x98you do think your illness was owing to that\r\naccident?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suppose the damage was brewing, and that the shake brought it into an\r\nactive state. There\xe2\x80\x99s a medical opinion for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I never knew what you thought of it before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, when I had a condor to pick on Guy\xe2\x80\x99s account with Philip, I was\r\nnot going to pick a crow on my own,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Oh! is luncheon\r\nready; and you all going? I never see anybody now. I want the story of\r\nthe shipwreck, though, of course, Ben What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-name was the hero, and\r\nSir Guy Morville not a bit of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura wanted to walk to East Hill, and the other young people agreed to\r\ngo thither, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be nice to go to church there to-day\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in a\r\nhalf-whisper, heard only by Guy, and answered by a look that showed how\r\nwell he understood and sympathized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Another thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, colouring a good deal; \xe2\x80\x98shall you mind my\r\ntelling Mary? I behaved so oddly last night, and she was so kind to me\r\nthat I think I ought.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary had seen enough last night to be very curious to-day, though hardly\r\nexpecting her curiosity to be gratified. However, as she was putting on\r\nher bonnet for church, she looked out of her window, and saw the four\r\ncoming across the fields from Hollywell. Guy and Amy did not walk into\r\nthe village arm-in-arm; but, as they came under the church porch, Guy,\r\nunseen by all held out his hand, sought hers, and, for one moment,\r\npressed it fervently. Amy knew he felt this like their betrothal.\r\n\r\nAfter the service, they stood talking with Mr. Ross and Mary, for some\r\nlittle time. Amy held apart, and Mary saw how it was. As they were about\r\nto turn homewards, Amy said quickly, \xe2\x80\x98Come and walk a little way home\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went on with Mary before the rest, and when out of sight of them\r\nall, said, \xe2\x80\x98Mary!\xe2\x80\x99 and then stopped short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I guess something, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell any one but Mr. Ross.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I have guessed right. My dear little Amy, I am very glad! So that\r\nwas the reason you flew out of the room last evening, and looked so\r\nbright and glowing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was so good of you to ask no questions!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need ask any now, Amy; for I see in your face how right\r\nand happy it all is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you all, Mary, but I must one thing,--that the whole\r\nterrible story arose from his helping a person in distress. I like you\r\nto know that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa was always sure that he had not been to blame,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; so Charlie told me, and that is the reason I wanted you to know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, Amy, something of this had begun last summer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but not as it is now. I did not half know what it was then.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor dear little Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary; \xe2\x80\x98what a very sad winter it must have\r\nbeen for you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, very!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but it was worse for him, because he was quite\r\nalone; and here every one was so kind to me. Mamma and Laura, and poor\r\nCharlie, through all his illness and pain, he was so very kind. And do\r\nyou know, Mary, now it is all over, I am very glad of this dismal time;\r\nfor I think that it has taught me how to bear things better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked very happy. Yet it struck Mary that it was strange to hear\r\nthat the first thought of a newly-betrothed maiden was how to brace\r\nherself in endurance. She wondered, however, whether it was not a more\r\ntruly happy and safe frame than that of most girls, looking forward to a\r\nlife of unclouded happiness, such as could never be realized. At least,\r\nso it struck Mary, though she owned to herself that her experience of\r\nlovers was limited.\r\n\r\nMary walked with Amy almost to the borders of Hollywell garden; and when\r\nthe rest came up with them, though no word passed, there was a great\r\ndeal of congratulation in her warm shake of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and no lack of\r\nreply in his proud smile and reddening cheek. Charlotte could not help\r\nturning and going back with her a little way, to say, \xe2\x80\x98Are not you\r\ndelighted, Mary? Is not Amy the dearest thing in the world? And you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know, for it is a secret, and I know it, how very noble Guy has\r\nbeen, while they would suspect him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very, very glad, indeed! It is everything delightful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never was so happy in my life,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte; \xe2\x80\x98nor Charlie, either.\r\nOnly think of having Guy for our brother; and he is going to send for\r\nBustle to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary laughed, and parted with Charlotte, speculating on the cause of\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s graver looks. Were they caused by the fear of losing her sister,\r\nor by a want of confidence in Guy?\r\n\r\nThat evening, how happy was the party at Hollywell, when Charles put\r\nGuy through a cross-examination on the shipwreck, from the first puff of\r\nwind to the last drop of rain; and Guy submitted very patiently, since\r\nhe was allowed the solace of praising his Redclyffe fishermen.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this time was full of tranquil, serene happiness. It was like\r\nthe lovely weather only to be met with in the spring, and then but\r\nrarely, when the sky is cloudless, and intensely blue,--the sunshine\r\none glow of clearness without burning,--not a breath of wind checks the\r\nsilent growth of the expanding buds of light exquisite green. Such days\r\nas these shone on Guy and Amabel, looking little to the future, or if\r\nthey did so at all, with a grave, peaceful awe, reposing in the present,\r\nand resuming old habits,--singing, reading, gardening, walking as of\r\nold, and that intercourse with each other that was so much more than\r\never before.\r\n\r\nIt was more, but it was not quite the same; for Guy was a very\r\nchivalrous lover; the polish and courtesy that sat so well on his frank,\r\ntruthful manners, were even more remarkable in his courtship. His\r\nways with Amy had less of easy familiarity than in the time of their\r\nbrother-and-sister-like intimacy, so that a stranger might have imagined\r\nher wooed, not won. It was as if he hardly dared to believe that she\r\ncould really be his own, and treated her with a sort of reverential love\r\nand gentleness, while she looked up to him with ever-increasing honour.\r\nShe was better able to understand him now than in her more childish days\r\nlast summer; and she did not merely see, as before, that she was looking\r\nat the upper surface of a mystery. He had, at the same time, grown in\r\ncharacter, his excitability and over-sensitiveness seemed to have been\r\nsmoothed away, and to have given place to a calmness of tone, that was\r\nby no means impassibility.\r\n\r\nWhen alone with Amy, he was generally very grave, often silent and\r\nmeditative, or else their talk was deep and serious; and even with the\r\nfamily he was less merry and more thoughtful than of old, though very\r\nbright and animated, and showing full, free affection to them all, as\r\nentirely accepted and owned as one of them.\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, he was. Mr. Edmonstone, with his intense delight in lovers,\r\npatronized them, and made commonplace jokes, which they soon learnt\r\nto bear without much discomposure. Mrs. Edmonstone was all that her\r\nconstant appellation of \xe2\x80\x98mamma\xe2\x80\x99 betokened, delighting in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s having\r\nlearnt to call her so. Charles enjoyed the restoration of his friend,\r\nthe sight of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, and the victory over Philip, and was\r\ngrowing better every day. Charlotte was supremely happy, watching the\r\nfirst love affair ever conducted in her sight, and little less so in the\r\nreturn of Bustle, who resumed his old habits as regularly as if he had\r\nonly left Hollywell yesterday.\r\n\r\nLaura alone was unhappy. She did not understand her own feelings; but\r\nsad at heart she was; with only one who could sympathize with her, and\r\nhe far away, and the current of feeling setting against him. She could\r\nnot conceal her depression, and was obliged to allow it to be attributed\r\nto the grief that one sister must feel in parting with another; and as\r\nher compassion for her little Amy, coupled with her dread of her latent\r\njealousy, made her particularly tender and affectionate, it gave even\r\nmore probability to the supposition. This made Guy, who felt as if he\r\nwas committing a robbery on them all, particularly kind to her, as if\r\nhe wished to atone for the injury of taking away her sister; and his\r\nkindness gave her additional pain at entertaining such hard thoughts of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHow false she felt when she was pitied! and how she hated the\r\ncongratulations, of which she had the full share! She thought, however,\r\nthat she should be able to rejoice when she had heard Philip\xe2\x80\x99s opinion;\r\nand how delightful it would be for him to declare himself satisfied with\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s exculpation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27\r\n\r\n     I forgave thee all the blame,\r\n     I could not forgive the praise.\r\n                        --TENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If ever there was a meddlesome coxcomb on this earth!\xe2\x80\x99 Such was the\r\nexclamation that greeted the ears of Guy as he supported Charles into\r\nthe breakfast-room; and, at the same time, Mr. Edmonstone tossed a\r\nletter into Guy\xe2\x80\x99s plate, saying,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s something for you to read.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy began; his lips were tightly pressed together; his brows made one\r\nblack line across his forehead, and his eye sparkled even through his\r\nbent-down eyelashes; but this lasted only a few moments; the forehead\r\nsmoothed, again, and there was a kind of deliberate restraint and force\r\nupon himself, which had so much power, that no one spoke till he had\r\nfinished, folded it up with a sort of extra care, and returned it, only\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should not show one such letters, Mr. Edmonstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does not it beat everything?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98If that is not\r\nimpertinence, I should like to know what is! But he has played my\r\nLord Paramount rather too long, as I can tell him! I ask his consent,\r\nforsooth! Probation, indeed! You might marry her to-morrow, and welcome.\r\nThere, give it to mamma. See if she does not say the same. Mere spite\r\nand malice all along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Laura! would no one refute such cruel injustice? Yes, Guy spoke,\r\neagerly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No no; that it never was. He was quite right under his belief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me! Not a word in his favour will I hear!\xe2\x80\x99 stormed on Mr.\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Mere envy and ill-will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always told him so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Pure malignity!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, sharply; \xe2\x80\x98there is no such thing about\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Guy; I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t have him\r\ndefended; I never thought to be so deceived; but you all worshipped the\r\nboy as if every word that came out of his mouth was Gospel truth, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve set him up till he would not condescend to take an advice of his\r\nown father, who little thought what an upstart sprig he was rearing; but\r\nI tell him he has come to the wrong shop for domineering--eh, mamma?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Edmonstone, who had read till near the end with\r\ntolerable equanimity; this really is too bad!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma and all!\xe2\x80\x99 thought poor Laura, while her mother continued,--\xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis wilful prejudice, to say the least,--I never could have believed him\r\ncapable of it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles next had the letter, and was commenting on it in a style of\r\nmingled sarcasm and fury; while Laura longed to see it justify itself,\r\nas she was sure it would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Read it, all of you--every bit,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98that you may see\r\nthis paragon of yours!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had rather not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, shrinking as it came towards her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like you to do so, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike it very much,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy.\r\n\r\nShe read in silence; and then came the turn of Laura, who marvelled at\r\nthe general injustice as she read.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x98CORK, April 8th.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR UNCLE,--I am much obliged to you for the communication of your\r\nintention with regard to Amabel; but, indeed, I must say I am a good\r\ndeal surprised that you should have so hastily resolved on so important\r\na step, and have been satisfied with so incomplete an explanation of\r\ncircumstances which appeared to you, as well as to myself, to show that\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s character was yet quite unsettled, and his conduct such as to\r\ncreate considerable apprehension that he was habitually extremely\r\nimprudent, to say the least of it, in the management of his own affairs.\r\nHow much more unfit, therefore, to have the happiness of another\r\nintrusted to him? I believe--indeed, I understood you to have declared\r\nto me that you were resolved never to allow the engagement to be\r\nrenewed, unless he should, with the deference which is only due to\r\nyou as his guardian, consent to clear up the mystery with which he\r\nhas thought fit to invest all his pecuniary transactions, and this, it\r\nappears, he refuses, as he persists in denying all explanation of his\r\ndemand for that large sum of money. As to the cheque, which certainly\r\nwas applied to discreditable uses, though I will not suffer myself to\r\nsuppose that Guy was in collusion with his uncle, yet it is not at\r\nall improbable that Dixon, not being a very scrupulous person, may, on\r\nhearing of the difficulties in which his nephew has been placed, come\r\nforward to relieve him from his embarrassment, in the hope of further\r\nprofit, by thus establishing a claim on his gratitude. In fact, this\r\nproof of secretly renewed intercourse with Dixon rather tends to\r\nincrease the presumption that there is something wrong. I am not writing\r\nthis in the expectation that the connection should be entirely broken\r\noff, for that, indeed, would be out of the question as things stand at\r\npresent, but for my little cousin\xe2\x80\x99s sake, as well as his own, I entreat\r\nof you to pause. They are both extremely young--so young, that if there\r\nwas no other ground, many persons would think it advisable to wait a few\r\nyears; and why not wait until the time fixed by his grandfather for\r\nhis coming into possession of his property? If the character of his\r\nattachment to Amabel is firm and true, the probation may be of infinite\r\nservice to him, as keeping before him, during the most critical period\r\nof his life, a powerful motive for restraining the natural impetuosity\r\nof his disposition; while, on the other hand, if this should prove\r\nto have been a mere passing fancy for the first young lady into whose\r\nsociety he has been thrown on terms of easy familiar intercourse, you\r\nwill then have the satisfaction of reflecting that your care and caution\r\nhave preserved your daughter from a life of misery. My opinion has\r\nnever altered respecting him, that he is brave and generous, with good\r\nfeelings and impulses, manners peculiarly attractive, and altogether a\r\ncharacter calculated to inspire affection, but impetuous and unsteady,\r\neasily led into temptation, yet obstinate in reserve, and his temper of\r\nunchecked violence. I wish him happiness of every kind; and, as you well\r\nknow, would, do my utmost for his welfare; but my affection for your\r\nwhole family, and my own conscientious conviction, make me feel it my\r\nduty to offer this remonstrance, which I hope will be regarded as by no\r\nmeans the result of any ill-will, but simply of a sincere desire for the\r\ngood of all parties, such as can only be evinced by plain speaking.\r\n\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x98Yours affectionately,\r\n                                \xe2\x80\x98P. MORVILLE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the time Laura was reading, Guy was defending Philip against the\r\nexaggerated abuse that Mr. Edmonstone and Charles were pouring out, till\r\nat last, Mrs. Edmonstone, getting out of patience, said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Guy, if we did not know you so well, we should almost accuse\r\nyou of affectation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I shall go away,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, laughing as he rose. \xe2\x80\x98Can you come\r\nout with me?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a lower tone, leaning over the back of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; wait a bit,\xe2\x80\x99 interposed Mr. Edmonstone; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t take her out, or\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t be to be found, anywhere, and I want to speak to you before\r\nI write my letter, and go to the Union Meeting. I want to tell Master\r\nPhilip, on the spot, that the day is fixed, and we snap our fingers at\r\nhim and his probation. Wait till twenty-five! I dare say!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt \xe2\x80\x98I want to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x99 the ladies had made the first move towards\r\ndeparture, but they were not out of hearing at the conclusion. Guy\r\nlooked after Amy, but she would not look round, and Charles lay twisting\r\nBustle\xe2\x80\x99s curls round his fingers, and smiling to himself at the manner\r\nin which the letter was working by contraries. The overthrow of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence was a great triumph for him, apart from the way in which it\r\naffected his friend and his sister.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was disappointed that Guy would not set about fixing the\r\nday, in time for him to announce it in a letter to be written in the\r\ncourse of an hour. Guy said he had not begun on the subject with Amy,\r\nand it would never do to hurry her. Indeed, it was a new light to\r\nhimself that Mr. Edmonstone would like it to take place so soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray, when did you think it was to be?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Upon my\r\nword, I never in all my days saw a lover like you, Guy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was too happy to think about the future; besides, I did not know\r\nwhether you had sufficient confidence in me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Confidence, nonsense! I tell you if I had a dozen daughters, I would\r\ntrust them all to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy smiled, and was infected by Charles\xe2\x80\x99s burst of laughing, but Mr.\r\nEdmonstone went on unheeding--\xe2\x80\x98I have the most absolute confidence\r\nin you! I am going to write to Philip this minute, to tell him he has\r\nplayed three-tailed Bashaw rather too long. I shall tell him it is to\r\nbe very soon, at any rate; and that if he wishes to see how I value his\r\npragmatical advice, he may come and dance at the wedding. I declare,\r\nyour mamma and that colonel of his have perfectly spoilt him with their\r\nflattery! I knew what would come of it; you all would make a prodigy of\r\nhim, till he is so puffed up, that he entirely forgets who he is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not I\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98that can\xe2\x80\x99t be laid to my door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I\xe2\x80\x99ll write him such a letter this instant as shall make him\r\nremember what he is, and show him who he has to deal with. Eh, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, preparing to go, \xe2\x80\x98that it might be better\r\nto wait a day or two, till we see our way clearer, and are a little\r\ncooler?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I tell you, Guy, there is no one that puts me out of patience now, but\r\nyourself. You are as bad as Philip himself. Cool? I am coolness itself,\r\nall but what\xe2\x80\x99s proper spirit for a man to show when his family is\r\naffronted, and himself dictated to, by a meddling young jackanapes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nserve him out properly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA message called him away. Guy stood looking perplexed and sorrowful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care the letter is moderate.\r\nBesides, it is only Philip, and he knows that letter-writing is not his\r\nforte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid things will be said in irritation, which you will both\r\nregret. There are justice and reason in the letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There shall be more in the answer, as you will see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I will not see. It is Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s concern, not mine. I am the\r\nlast person who should have anything to do with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just what the individual in question would not have said.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you do one thing to oblige me, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything but not speaking my mind to, or of, the captain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the very thing, unluckily. Try to get the answer put off till\r\nto-morrow, and that will give time to look at this letter candidly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All the candour in the world will not make me think otherwise than that\r\nhe is disappointed at being no longer able to make us the puppets of his\r\nmalevolence. Don\xe2\x80\x99t answer, or if you do, tell me what you say in favour\r\nof that delicate insinuation of his.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy made a step towards the window, and a step back again. \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis not\r\nfair to ask such questions,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, after a moment. \xe2\x80\x98It is throwing\r\noil on the fire. I was trying to forget it. He neither knows my uncle\r\nnor the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I am glad there is a point on which you can\xe2\x80\x99t even pretend to\r\nstand up for him, or I should have thought you crazed with Quixotism.\r\nBut I am keeping you when you want to be off to Amy. Never mind Mr.\r\nReady-to-halt; I shall wait till my father comes back. If you want the\r\nletter put off you had better give some hopes of--Oh! he is gone, and\r\ndisinterested advice it is of mine, for what is to become of me without\r\nAmy remains to be proved. Laura, poor thing, looks like Patience on a\r\nmonument. I wonder whether Philip\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace has anything to do with it.\r\nHum! If mamma\xe2\x80\x99s old idea was right, the captain has been more like moth\r\nand candle than consistent with his prudence, unless he thought it \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ntoute epreuve\xe2\x80\x9d. I wonder what came to pass last autumn, when I was ill,\r\nand mamma\xe2\x80\x99s head full of me. He may not intend it, and she may not know\r\nit, but I would by no means answer for Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s being guiltless of that\r\nharassed look she has had ever since that ball-going summer. Oh! there\r\ngo that pretty study, Amy and her true knight. As to Guy, he is more\r\nincomprehensible than ever; yet there is no avoiding obeying him, on the\r\nprinciple on which that child in the \xe2\x80\x9cMoorland cottage\xe2\x80\x9d said she should\r\nobey Don Quixote.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo when his father came in, Charles wiled him into deferring the letter\r\ntill the next day, by giving him an indistinct hope that some notion\r\nwhen the marriage would be, might be arrived at by that time. He\r\nconsented the more readily, because he was in haste to investigate a\r\ncomplaint that had just been made of the union doctor; but his last\r\nwords to his wife and son before he went, were--\xe2\x80\x98Of course, they must\r\nmarry directly, there is nothing on earth to wait for. Live at Redclyffe\r\nalone? Not to be thought of. No, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see little Amy my Lady Morville,\r\nbefore Philip goes abroad, if only to show him I am not a man to be\r\ndictated to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone sighed; but when he was gone, she agreed with Charles\r\nthat there was nothing to wait for, and that it would be better for Guy\r\nto take his wife at once with him, when he settled at Redclyffe. So it\r\nmust be whenever Amy could make up her mind to it; and thereupon they\r\nmade plans for future meetings, Charles announcing that the Prince of\r\nthe Black Isles would become locomotive, and Charlotte forming grand\r\ndesigns upon Shag Island.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Guy and Amy were walking in the path through the wood,\r\nwhere he began: \xe2\x80\x98I would not have asked you to do anything so unpleasant\r\nas reading that letter, but I thought you ought to consider of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was just like himself! How could he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether he will ever see his own harshness?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis very strange, that with all his excellence and real kindness, there\r\nshould be some distortion in his view of all that concerns me. I cannot\r\nunderstand it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must let me call it prejudice, Guy, in spite of your protest. It is\r\na relief to say something against him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, don\xe2\x80\x99t be venomous!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, in a playful tone of reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but you know it is not _me_ whom he has been abusing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, musingly, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose it is right there should be this\r\ncloud, or it would be too bright for earth. It has been one of my chief\r\nwishes to have things straight with Philip, ever since the time he\r\nstayed at Redclyffe as a boy. I saw his superiority then; but it fretted\r\nme, and I never could make a companion of him. Ever since, I have\r\nlooked to his approval as one of the best things to be won. It shows\r\nhis ascendancy of character; yet, do what I will, the mist has gone on\r\nthickening between us; and with reason, for I have never been able to\r\ngive him the confidence he required, and his conduct about my uncle has\r\nso tried my patience, that I never have been quite sure whether I ought\r\nto avoid him or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now you are the only person who will speak for him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\npapa is provoked with you,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, pretending to be wilful. \xe2\x80\x98I only\r\nhope you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make me do the same. I could bear anything better\r\nthan his old saying about your attractive manners and good impulses,\r\nand his opinion that has never altered. O Guy, he is the most provoking\r\nperson in all the world. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try to make me admire him, nor be sorry\r\nfor him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not when you remember how he was looked on here? and how, without\r\ndoing anything worthy of blame, nay, from his acting unsparingly, as he\r\nthought right, every one has turned against him? even mamma, who used to\r\nbe so fond of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, not Laura, and I am thankful to her for it; for all this makes me\r\nfeel as if I had supplanted him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, yes, it is like you; but don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to feel that yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmy, with tears in her eyes,\xe2\x80\x99 or I shall be obliged to tell you what you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t like to hear, about his tone of triumph that terrible time last\r\nyear. It was so very different, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could ever forgive him,\r\nif it had not made me so miserable too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy pressed her arm. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; but he thought himself right. He meant to do\r\nthe kindest thing by you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, so entirely without effort, that no\r\none could doubt it came straight from his heart. \xe2\x80\x98So he thinks still,\r\nAmy; there is fairness, justice, good sense in his letter, and we\r\nmust not blind our eyes to it, though there is injustice, at least,\r\nharshness. I did fail egregiously in my first trial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fail!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In temper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Amy, I wanted to ask what you think about the four years he\r\nspeaks of. Do you think, as he says, my habits might be more fixed, and\r\naltogether you might have more confidence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t look on you quite as he does now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with a very pretty\r\nsmile. \xe2\x80\x98Do you think his opinion of you will ever alter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what do you think? Is there not some reason in what he says?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The only use I can see is, that perhaps I should be wiser at\r\ntwenty-four, and fitter to take care of such a great house; but then you\r\nhave been always helping me to grow wiser, and I am not much afraid but\r\nthat you will be patient with me. Indeed, Guy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\r\nis a thing I ought to say,\xe2\x80\x99 she added, blushing, \xe2\x80\x98but I think it would\r\nbe dismal for you to go and live all alone at Redclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Honestly, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, after a little pause, \xe2\x80\x98if you feel so, and\r\nyour father approves, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be better to wait. I know\r\nyour presence is a safeguard, and if the right motives did not suffice\r\nto keep me straight, and I was only apparently so from hopes of you, why\r\nthen I should be so utterly good for nothing at the bottom, if not on\r\nthe surface, that you had better have nothing to say to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy laughed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That being settled,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Guy, \xe2\x80\x98did you hear what your father said\r\nas you left the breakfast-room?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe coloured all over, and there was silence. \xe2\x80\x98What did you answer?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she, at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I said, whatever happened, you must not be taken by surprise in having\r\nto decide quickly. Do you wish to have time to think? I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in and\r\nleave you to consider, if you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I only want to know what you wish,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, not parting with his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had rather you did just as suits you best. Of course, you know what\r\nmy wish must be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy walked on a little way in silence. \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, presently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think you and mamma had better settle it. The worst\xe2\x80\x99--she had tears\r\nin her eyes--\xe2\x80\x98the going away--mamma--Charlie--all that will be as bad at\r\none time as at another.\xe2\x80\x99 The tears flowed faster. \xe2\x80\x98It had better be as\r\nyou all like best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Amy! I wonder at myself for daring to ask you to exchange your bright\r\ncheerful home for my gloomy old house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, your home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I used to wonder why it was called gloomy; but it will be so no more\r\nwhen you are there. Yet there is a shadow hanging over it, which\r\nmakes it sometimes seem too strange that you and it should be brought\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have read somewhere that there is no real gloom but what people raise\r\nfor themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True. Gloom is in sin, not sorrow. Yes, there would be no comfort if I\r\nwere not sure that if aught of grief or pain should come to you through\r\nme, it will not, cannot really hurt you, my Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, unless by my own fault, and you will help me to meet it. Hark! was\r\nthat a nightingale?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, the first! How beautiful! There--don\xe2\x80\x99t you see it? Look on that\r\nhazel, you may see its throat moving. Well!\xe2\x80\x99 when they had listened for\r\na long time,--\xe2\x80\x98after all, that creature and the sea will hardly let one\r\nspeak of gloom, even in this world, to say nothing of other things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sea! I am glad I have never seen it, because now you will show it\r\nto me for the first time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will never, can never imagine it, Amy! and he sung,--\r\n\r\n\r\n         \xe2\x80\x98With all tones of waters blending,\r\n          Glorious is the breaking deep,\r\n          Glorious, beauteous, without ending,\r\n          Songs of ocean never sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nA silence followed, only broken by the notes of the birds, and presently\r\nby the strokes of the great clock. Guy looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eleven, Amy! I must go to my reading, or you will have to be very much\r\nashamed of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor, after the first few days, Guy had returned to study regularly every\r\nday. He said it was a matter of necessity, not at all of merit, for\r\nthough he did not mean to try for honours, Amy must not marry a plucked\r\nman. His whole career at Oxford had been such a struggle with the\r\ndisadvantages of his education, that all his diligence had, he thought,\r\nhardly raised him to a level with his contemporaries. Moreover,\r\ncourtship was not the best preparation for the schools, so that\r\nthough he knew he had done his best, he expected no more than to pass\r\nrespectably, and told Amy it was very good of her to be contented with a\r\ndunce, whereat she laughed merrily. But she knew him too well to try to\r\nkeep him lingering in the April sunshine, and in they went, Guy to his\r\nGreek, and Amy to her mother. Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s lessons had been in\r\nabeyance, or turned over to Laura of late, and Mrs. Edmonstone and her\r\ndressing-room were always ready for the confidences of the family, who\r\nsought her there in turn--all but one, and that the one whose need was\r\nthe sorest.\r\n\r\nAmy and her mother comforted themselves with a good quiet cry, that was\r\nnot exactly sorrowful, and came to the conclusion that Guy was the most\r\nconsiderate person in the world, and they would do whatever best suited\r\nhim and papa. So, when Mr. Edmonstone came home, he was rewarded for\r\nputting off the letter by finding every one willing to let the marriage\r\ntake place whenever he pleased. There were various conferences in the\r\ndressing-room, and Guy and Amy both had burning faces when they came\r\ndown to dinner. Laura beheld them with a throbbing heart, while she\r\nmechanically talked to Dr. Mayerne, as if nothing was going on. She\r\nwas glad there was no singing that evening, for she felt incapable of\r\njoining; and when at night Charles and his father talked of sitting up\r\nto write to Philip, the misery was such that she had no relief till she\r\nhad shut herself in her room, to bear or to crush the suffering as best\r\nshe might.\r\n\r\nShe was still sitting helpless in her wretchedness when Amy knocked\r\nat the door, and came in glowing with blushes and smiles, though her\r\neyelashes were dewy with tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, dearest! if you would not be so very unhappy! I wish I knew what\r\nto do for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura laid her head on her shoulder, and cried. It was a great comfort,\r\nlittle as Amy could understand her trouble. Amy kissed her, soothed her\r\ncaressingly, cried too, and said, in broken sentences, how often they\r\nwould be together, and how comfortable it was that Charlie was so much\r\nbetter, and Charlotte quite a companion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you have fixed the day?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Laura, at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Tuesday in Whitsun-week,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Amy, resting her forehead on\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. \xe2\x80\x98They all thought it right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura flung her arms round her, and wept too much to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, after a time, \xe2\x80\x98it is very kind of you,\r\nbut--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Amy! you don\xe2\x80\x99t know. You must not think so much better of me than\r\nI deserve. It is not only--No, I would not be so selfish, if but--but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\nNever had her self-command so given way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you are unhappy about Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; and Laura, alarmed lest\r\nshe might have betrayed him, started, and tried to recover herself;\r\nbut she saw Amy was quite unsuspicious, and the relief from this fright\r\nhelped her through what her sister was saying,--\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you, who were so\r\nfond of him, must be vexed at this unkindness on his part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure it is his real wish for your good,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with displeasure. Then changing her tone, \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyour pardon, dear Laura, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can quite bear to hear any\r\none but Guy defend him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very generous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, is not it, Laura? and he says he is so grieved to see us turned\r\nagainst Philip, after being so fond of him; he says it makes him feel\r\nas if he had supplanted him, and that he is quite thankful to you for\r\ntaking his part still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shall I bear it?\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Laura, to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether he will come?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think so?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Well, Guy would be glad. Yes. O Laura, if\r\nPhilip would learn to do Guy justice, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there would be any\r\nmore to wish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will in time,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98He is too generous not to be won by\r\nsuch generosity as Guy\xe2\x80\x99s; and when all this is forgotten, and all these\r\naccusations have been lived down, he will be the warmest of friends.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, as if she wished to be convinced; \xe2\x80\x98but if he would only\r\nleave off saying his opinion has never altered, I think I could bring\r\nmyself to look on him as Guy wants me to do. Good night! dear Laura,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t be unhappy. Oh! one thing I must tell you; Guy made Charles\r\npromise to do all he could not to let it be a hasty letter. Now, good\r\nnight!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Laura, she knew not whether gratitude to Guy was not one of her\r\nmost painful sensations. She wished much to know what had been said in\r\nthe letter; but only one sentence transpired, and that was, that Mr.\r\nEdmonstone had never heard it was necessary to apply to a nephew for\r\nconsent to a daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. It seemed as if it must have been\r\nas cutting as Charles could make it; but Laura trusted to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge of the family, and desire for their good, to make him forgive\r\nit, and the expectation of seeing him again at the wedding, cheered her.\r\nIndeed, a hope of still greater consequences began to rise in her mind,\r\nafter Charles one day said to her, \xe2\x80\x98I think you ought to be much obliged\r\nto Guy. This morning, he suddenly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cI say, Charlie, I wish you\r\nwould take care Amy\xe2\x80\x99s fortune is not settled on her so that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ngot rid of.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked how he meant to make ducks and drakes of it; and he\r\nexplained, that if either of you two did not happen to marry for money,\r\nlike Amy, it might do you no harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are very much obliged to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, more earnestly than\r\nCharles had expected. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know what it is, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you want to calculate the amount of your obligation! Somewhere\r\nabout five thousand pounds, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles watched Laura, and the former idea recurred, as he wondered\r\nwhether there was any particular meaning in her inquiry.\r\n\r\nMeaning, indeed, there was. Laura knew nothing about the value of money;\r\nshe did not know what Philip had of his own; how far five, or even ten,\r\nthousand would go in enabling them to marry, or whether it was available\r\nin her father\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime; but she thought this prospect might smooth the\r\nway to the avowal of their attachment, as effectually as his promotion;\r\nshe reckoned on relief from the weary oppression of secrecy, and fully\r\nexpected that it would all be told in the favourable juncture, when her\r\nparents were full of satisfaction in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. Gratitude to Guy\r\nwould put an end to all doubt, dislike, and prejudice, and Philip would\r\nreceive him as a brother.\r\n\r\nThese hopes supported Laura, and enabled her to take part with more\r\nappearance of interest in the consultations and arrangements for the\r\nmarriage, which were carried on speedily, as the time was short, and Mr.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s ideas were on a grand scale. It seemed as if he meant\r\nto invite all the world, and there were no limits to his views of\r\nbreakfast, carriages, and splendours. His wife let him run on without\r\ncontradiction, leaving the plans either to evaporate or condense, as\r\ntime might prove best. Guy took Amy out walking, and asked what she\r\nthought of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you dislike it very much?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hardly tell. Of course, as a general rule, the less parade and\r\nnonsense the better; but if your father wishes it, and if people do find\r\nenjoyment in that way, it seems hard they should not have all they can\r\nout of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes; the school children and poor people,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How happy the Ashford children will be, feasting the poor people at\r\nRedclyffe! Old Jonas Ledbury will be in high glory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure it does not seem like merit to feast one\xe2\x80\x99s poor neighbours\r\nrather than the rich. It is so much pleasanter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, since the poor will be feasted, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the rich ones\r\nwill do us much harm.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure I shall know very little about them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The realities are so great to us, that they will swallow up the\r\naccessories. There must be the church, and all that; and for the rest,\r\nAmy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall find out whether you wear lace or grogram.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement for me!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98However, what I\r\nmean is, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about it, if I am not obliged to attend, and\r\ngive my mind, to those kind of things just then, and that mamma will\r\ntake care of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it not a great trouble for her? I forgot that. It was selfish; for\r\nwe slip out of the fuss, and it all falls on her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it would tease her more to have to\r\npersuade papa out of what he likes, and alter every little matter? That\r\nwould be worry, the rest only exertion; and, do you know, I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe, with a rising tear, \xe2\x80\x98that it will be better for her, to keep her\r\nfrom thinking about losing me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see. Very well, we will take the finery quietly. Only one thing, Amy,\r\nwe will not be put out of,--we will not miss the full holy-day service.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes; that will be the comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One other thing, Amy. You know I have hardly a friend of my own; but\r\nthere is one person I should like to ask,--Markham. He has been so\r\nkind, and so much attached to me; he loved my father so devotedly, and\r\nsuffered so much at his death, that it is a pity he should not be made\r\nhappy; and very happy he will be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And there is one person I should like to ask, Guy, if mamma thinks we\r\ncan do it. I am sure little Marianne ought to be one of my bridesmaids.\r\nCharlotte would take care of her, and it would be very nice to have\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 28\r\n\r\n     But no kind influence deign they shower,\r\n     Till pride be quelled and love be free.\r\n                                --SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\nKilcoran was about twenty miles from Cork, and Captain Morville was\r\nengaged to go and spend a day or two there. Maurice de Courcy drove him\r\nthither, wishing all the way for some other companion, since no one ever\r\nventured to smoke a cigar in the proximity of \xe2\x80\x98Morville\xe2\x80\x99; and, besides,\r\nMaurice\xe2\x80\x99s conversational powers were obliged to be entirely bestowed\r\non his horse and dog, for the captain, instead of, as usual, devoting\r\nhimself to suit his talk to his audience, was wrapped in the deepest\r\nmeditation, now and then taking out a letter and referring to it.\r\n\r\nThis letter was the reply jointly compounded by Mr. Edmonstone and\r\nCharles, and the subject of his consideration was, whether he should\r\naccept the invitation to the wedding. Charles had taken care fully to\r\nexplain how the truth respecting the cheque had come out, and Philip\r\ncould no longer suspect that it had been a fabrication of Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s; but\r\nwhile Guy persisted in denial of any answer about the thousand pounds,\r\nhe thought the renewal of the engagement extremely imprudent. He was\r\nvery sorry for poor little Amy, for her comfort and happiness were, he\r\nthought, placed in the utmost jeopardy, with such a hot temper, under\r\nthe most favourable circumstances; and there was the further peril, that\r\nwhen the novelty of the life with her at Redclyffe had passed off, Guy\r\nmight seek for excitement in the dissipation to which his uncle had\r\nprobably already introduced him. In the four years\xe2\x80\x99 probation, he\r\nsaw the only hope of steadying Guy, or of saving Amy, and he was much\r\nconcerned at the rejection of his advice, entirely for their sakes, for\r\nhe could not condescend to be affronted at the scornful, satirical tone\r\ntowards himself, in which Charles\xe2\x80\x99s little spitefulness was so fully\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was a regular sacrifice, and Amabel was nothing but a\r\nvictim; but an invitation to Hollywell had a charm for him that he\r\nscarcely could resist. To see Laura again, after having parted, as he\r\nthought, for so many years, delighted him in anticipation; and it would\r\nmanifest his real interest in his young cousins, and show that he was\r\nsuperior to taking offence at the folly of Charles or his father.\r\n\r\nThese were his first thoughts and inclinations; his second were, that\r\nit was contrary to his principles to sanction so foolish and hasty a\r\nmarriage by his presence; that he should thus be affording a triumph to\r\nGuy, and to one who would use it less moderately--to Charles. It would\r\nbe more worthy of himself, more consistent with his whole course of\r\nconduct, to refuse his presence, instead of going amongst them when they\r\nwere all infatuated, and unable to listen to sober counsel. If he stayed\r\naway now, when Guy should have justified his opinion, they would all\r\nown how wisely he had acted, and would see the true dignity which had\r\nrefused, unlike common minds, to let his complaisance draw him into\r\ngiving any sanction to what he so strongly disapproved. Laura, too,\r\nwould pass through this trying time better if she was not distracted\r\nby watching him; she would understand the cause of his absence, and he\r\ncould trust her to love and comprehend him at a distance, better than\r\nhe could trust her to hear the marriage-service in his presence without\r\nbetraying herself. Nor did he wish to hear her again plead for the\r\nconfession of their engagement; and, supposing any misadventure should\r\nlead to its betrayal, what could be more unpleasant than for it to be\r\nrevealed at such a time, when Charles would so turn it against him, that\r\nall his influence and usefulness would be for ever at an end?\r\n\r\nLove drew him one way, and consistency another. Captain Morville had\r\nnever been so much in the condition of Mahomet\xe2\x80\x99s coffin in his life; and\r\nhe grew more angry with his uncle, Charles, and Guy, for having put him\r\nin so unpleasant a predicament. So the self-debate lasted all the way\r\nto Kilcoran and he only had two comforts--one, that he had sent the\r\nfollower who was always amenable to good advice, safe out of the way\r\nof Lady Eveleen, to spend his leave of absence at Thorndale--the other,\r\nthat Maurice de Courcy was, as yet, ignorant of the Hollywell news, and\r\ndid not torment him by talking about it.\r\n\r\nThis satisfaction, however, lasted no longer than till their arrival at\r\nKilcoran; for, the instant they entered the drawing-room, Lady Eveleen\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98O Maurice, I have been so longing for you to come! Captain\r\nMorville, I hope you have not told him, for I can\xe2\x80\x99t flatter myself to be\r\nbeforehand with you, now at least.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has told me nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Maurice; \xe2\x80\x98indeed, such bad company has\r\nseldom been seen as he has been all the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it? How delightful! O, mamma! think\r\nof knowing something Captain Morville does not!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid I cannot flatter you so far,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, knowing this was\r\nno place for allowing his real opinion to be guessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you do know?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Kilcoran, sleepily; \xe2\x80\x98I am sure it is a\r\nsubject of great rejoicing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what is it, Eva? Make haste and tell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Maurice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; you must guess!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, you would not be in such a way about it if it was not a wedding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right, Maurice; now, who is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of the Edmonstones, I suppose. \xe2\x80\x98Tis Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wrong!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, not Laura! I thought she would have been off first. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot no taste, then, for Laura is the prettiest girl I know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! your heart has escaped breaking this time, Maurice. It is that\r\nlittle puss, Amy, that has made a great conquest. Now guess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! young Morville, of course. But what possessed him to take Amy, and\r\nleave Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps Laura was not to be had. Men are so self-sufficient, that they\r\nalways think they may pick and choose. Is it not so, Captain Morville?\r\nI like Sir Guy better than most men, but Laura is too good for any one\r\nI know. If I could make a perfect hero, I would at once, only Charles\r\nwould tell me all the perfect heroes in books are bores. How long have\r\nyou known of it, Captain Morville?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For the last ten days.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you never mentioned it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know whether they intended to publish it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Captain Morville, I hope to make some progress in your good\r\nopinion. Of course, you believe I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a secret; but what do you\r\nthink of my having known it ever since last summer, and held my tongue\r\nall that time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A great effort, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98It would have\r\nbeen greater, I suppose, if the engagement had been positive, not\r\nconditional.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! every one knew what it must come to. No one could have the least\r\nfear of Sir Guy. Yes; I saw it all. I gave my little aid, and I am\r\nsure I have a right to be bridesmaid, as I am to be. Oh! won\xe2\x80\x99t it be\r\ncharming? It is to be the grandest wedding that ever was seen. It is to\r\nbe on Whit-Tuesday; and papa is going to take me and Aunt Charlotte;\r\nfor old Aunt Mabel says Aunt Charlotte must go. There are to be six\r\nbridesmaids, and a great party at the breakfast; everything as splendid\r\nas possible; and I made Mrs. Edmonstone promise from the first that we\r\nshould have a ball. You must go, Maurice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be on the high seas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, that is horrid! But you don\xe2\x80\x99t sail with the regiment, I think,\r\nCaptain Morville. You surely go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not certain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; especially disgusted by hearing of the\r\nsplendour, and thinking that he had supposed Guy would have had more\r\nsense; and it showed how silly Amy really was, since she was evidently\r\nonly anxious to enjoy the full paraphernalia of a bride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not certain!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Maurice and Eveleen, in a breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not sure that I shall have time. You know I have been intending to\r\nmake a walking tour through Switzerland before joining at Corfu.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you really would prefer going by yourself--\xe2\x80\x9capart, unfriended,\r\nmelancholy, slow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very slow, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Maurice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A wedding is a confused melancholy affair,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98You know I am\r\nno dancing man, Lady Eveleen; one individual like myself can make little\r\ndifference to persons engrossed with their own affairs; I can wish my\r\ncousins well from a distance as well as at hand; and though they\r\nhave been kind enough to ask me, I think that while their house is\r\noverflowing with guests of more mark, my room will be preferred to my\r\ncompany.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you do not mean to go?\xe2\x80\x99 said Lady Kilcoran. \xe2\x80\x98I do not,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x98for my health is never equal to so much excitement, and it\r\nwould only be giving poor Mrs. Edmonstone additional trouble to have to\r\nattend to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you really mean to stay away?\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not entirely decided.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At any rate you must go and tell old Aunt Mabel all about them,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nEveleen. \xe2\x80\x98She is so delighted. You will be quite worshipped, at\r\nthe cottage, for the very name of Morville. I spend whole hours in\r\ndiscoursing on Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s perfections.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip could not refuse; but his feelings towards Guy were not warmed\r\nby the work he had to go through, when conducted to the cottage, where\r\nlived old Lady Mabel Edmonstone and her daughter, and there required\r\nto dilate on Guy\xe2\x80\x99s excellence. He was not wanted to speak of any of the\r\npoints where his conscience would not let him give a favourable report;\r\nit was quite enough for him to tell of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s agreeable manners and\r\nmusical talents, and to describe the beauty and extent of Redclyffe.\r\nLady Mabel and Miss Edmonstone were transported; and the more Philip saw\r\nof the light and superficial way in which the marriage was considered,\r\nthe more unwilling he became to confound himself with such people by\r\neagerness to be present at it, and to join in the festivities. Yet he\r\nexercised great forbearance in not allowing one word of his disapproval\r\nor misgivings to escape him; no censure was uttered, and Lady Eveleen\r\nherself could not make out whether he rejoiced or not. He was grave and\r\nphilosophical, superior to nonsensical mirth, that was all that she\r\nsaw; and he made himself very agreeable throughout his visit, by taking\r\ncondescending interest in all that was going on, and especially to Lady\r\nEveleen, by showing that he thought her worthy of rational converse.\r\n\r\nHe made himself useful, as usual. Lord Kilcoran wanted a tutor for\r\nhis two youngest boys, and it had been proposed to send them to Mr.\r\nWellwood, at his curacy at Coombe Prior. He wished to know what Captain\r\nMorville thought of the plan; and Philip, thinking that Mr. Wellwood had\r\nbeen very inattentive to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, though\r\nhe would not blame him, considered it very fortunate that he had a\r\ndifferent plan to recommend. One of the officers of his regiment had\r\nlately had staying with him a brother who had just left Oxford, and was\r\nlooking out for a tutorship, a very clever and agreeable young man, whom\r\nhe liked particularly, and he strongly advised Lord Kilcoran to keep his\r\nsons under his own eye, and place them under the care of this gentleman.\r\nHis advice, especially when enforced by his presence, was almost sure to\r\nprevail, and thus it was in the present case.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of his visit was, that he thought worse and worse of the\r\nsense of the whole Edmonstone connection,--considered that it would be\r\nof no use for him to go to Hollywell,--adhered to his second resolution,\r\nand wrote to his uncle a calm and lofty letter, free from all token of\r\noffence, expressing every wish for the happiness of Guy and Amabel, and\r\nthanking his uncle for the invitation, which, however, he thought it\r\nbest to decline, much as he regretted losing the opportunity of seeing\r\nHollywell and its inhabitants again. His regiment would sail for Corfu\r\neither in May or June; but he intended, himself, to travel on foot\r\nthrough Germany and Italy, and would write again before quitting\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98there were at the marriage the Picanninies, and the\r\nJoblillies, and the Garryulies, but not the grand Panjandrum himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor the little round button at top!\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s his own look out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98It is of a piece\r\nwith all the rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure we don\xe2\x80\x99t want him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in this humour,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother.\r\n\r\nAmy said nothing; and if she did not allow herself to avow that\r\nhis absence was a relief, it was because she saw it was a grief and\r\ndisappointment to Guy.\r\n\r\nLaura was, of course, very much mortified,--almost beyond the power of\r\nconcealment. She thought he would have come for the sake of seeing\r\nher, and she had reckoned so much on this meeting that it was double\r\nvexation. He did not know what he was missing by not coming; and she\r\ncould not inform him, for writing to him was impossible, without the\r\nunderhand dealings to which they would never, either of them, have\r\nrecourse. So much for herself; and his perseverance in disapproval, in\r\nspite of renewed explanation, made her more anxious and sorry on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount. Very mournful were poor Laura\xe2\x80\x99s sensations; but there was\r\nno remedy but to try to bewilder and drive them away in the bustle of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nGuy had to go and take his degree, and then return to make his own\r\npreparations at Redclyffe. Amy begged him, as she knew he would like,\r\nto leave things alone as much as possible; for she could not bear old\r\nplaces to be pulled to pieces to suit new-comers; and she should like to\r\nfind it just as he had been used to it.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and said, \xe2\x80\x98It should only be made habitable.\xe2\x80\x99 She must have\r\na morning-room, about which he would consult Mrs. Ashford: and he would\r\nchoose her piano himself. The great drawing-room had never been unpacked\r\nsince his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s time, so that must be in repair; and, as for a\r\ngarden, they would lay it out together. There could not be much done;\r\nfor though they did not talk of it publicly, lest they should shock Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, they meant to go home directly after their marriage.\r\n\r\nTo Oxford, then, went Guy; his second letter announced that he had done\r\ntolerably well on his examination; and it came round to the Edmonstones,\r\nthat it was a great pity he had not gone up for honours, as he would\r\ncertainly have distinguished himself.\r\n\r\nRedclyffe was, of course, in a state of great excitement at the news\r\nthat Sir Guy was going to be married. Markham was very grand with the\r\nletter that announced it, and could find nothing to grumble about but\r\nthat the lad was very young, and it was lucky it was no worse.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashford was glad it was so good a connection, and obtained all the\r\nintelligence she could from James Thorndale, who spoke warmly of the\r\nHollywell family in general; and, in particular, said that the young\r\nladies looked after schools and poor people,--that Miss Edmonstone was\r\nvery handsome and clever--a very superior person; but as to Miss Amabel,\r\nhe did not know that there was anything to say about her. She was just\r\nlike other young ladies, and very attentive to her invalid brother.\r\n\r\nMarkham\xe2\x80\x99s enmity to Mr. Ashford had subsided at the bidding of his\r\nmaster; and he informed him one day, with great cordiality, that Sir Guy\r\nwould be at home the next. He was to sleep that night at Coombe Prior,\r\nand ride to Redclyffe in the morning; and, to the great delight of the\r\nboys, it was at the parsonage door that he dismounted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashford looked up in his bright face, and saw no more of the shade\r\nthat had perplexed her last winter. His cheeks were deeper red as she\r\nwarmly shook hands with him; and then the children sprung upon him for\r\ntheir old games,--the boys claiming his promise, with all their might,\r\nto take them out to the Shag. She wondered when she should venture to\r\ntalk to him about Miss Amabel. He next went to find Markham, and met\r\nhim before he reached his house. Markham was too happy not to grant and\r\ngrumble more than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir Guy; so here you are! You\xe2\x80\x99ve lost no time about it, however.\r\nA fine pair of young housekeepers, and a pretty example of early\r\nmarriages for the parish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy laughed. \xe2\x80\x98You must come and see the example, Markham. I have a\r\nmessage from Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, to ask you to come to Hollywell at\r\nWhitsuntide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrunt! \xe2\x80\x98You are making a fool of me, Sir Guy. What\xe2\x80\x99s a plain old man\r\nlike me to do among all your lords and ladies, and finery and flummery?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do no such thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to oblige me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oblige you? Nonsense! Much you\xe2\x80\x99ll care for me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, Markham, you must not stay away. You, my oldest and best\r\nfriend,--my only home friend. I owe all my present happiness to you, and\r\nit would really be a great disappointment to me if you did not come. She\r\nwishes it, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Sir Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 and the grunt was of softer tone, \xe2\x80\x98if you do choose to\r\nmake a fool of me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. You must have your own way; though\r\nyou might have found a friend that would do you more credit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I may say that you will come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say I am very much obliged to Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone for their\r\ninvitation. It is very handsome of them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you will have the settlements ready by that time. You must,\r\nMarkham.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the house must be ready to come home to at once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are talking of, Sir Guy!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Markham, at\r\nonce aghast and angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I do. We don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to turn the house upside down with new\r\nfurniture.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may talk as you please, Sir Guy, but I know what\xe2\x80\x99s what; and it is\r\nmere nonsense to talk of bringing a lady to a house in this condition.\r\nA pretty notion you have of what is fit for your bride! I hope she knows\r\nwhat sort of care you mean to take of her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will be satisfied,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98She particularly wishes not to have\r\neverything disarranged, I only must have two rooms furnished for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But the place wants painting from head to foot, and the roof is in such\r\na state--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The roof? That\xe2\x80\x99s serious!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Serious; I believe so. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have it about your ears in no time, if\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t look sharp.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll look this minute,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, jumping up. \xe2\x80\x98Will you come with me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp he went, climbing about in the forest of ancient timbers, where he\r\ncould not but be convinced that there was more reason than he could wish\r\nin what Markham said, and that his roof was in no condition to bring\r\nhis bride to. Indeed it was probable that it had never been thoroughly\r\nrepaired since the time of old Sir Hugh, for the Morvilles had not been\r\nwont to lay out money on what did not make a display. Guy was in dismay,\r\nhe sent for the builder from Moorworth; calculated times and costs;\r\nbut, do what he would, he could not persuade himself that when once the\r\nworkmen were in Redclyffe, they would be out again before the autumn.\r\n\r\nGuy was very busy during the fortnight he spent at home. There were the\r\nbuilder and his plans, and Markham and the marriage settlements, and\r\nthere were orders to be given about the furniture. He came to Mrs.\r\nAshford about this, conducted her to the park, and begged her to be so\r\nkind as to be his counsellor, and to superintend the arrangement. He\r\nshowed her what was to be Amy\xe2\x80\x99s morning-room--now bare and empty, but\r\nwith the advantages of a window looking south, upon the green wooded\r\nslope of the park, with a view of the church tower, and of the moors,\r\nwhich were of very fine form. He owned himself to be profoundly ignorant\r\nabout upholstery matters, and his ideas of furniture seemed to consist\r\nin prints for the walls, a piano, a bookcase, and a couch for Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have heard about Charles?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, raising his bright face from\r\nthe list of needful articles which he was writing, using the window-seat\r\nas a table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Ashford. \xe2\x80\x98Is he entirely confined to the sofa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He cannot move without crutches; but no one could guess what he is\r\nwithout seeing him. He is so patient, his spirits never flag; and it is\r\nbeautiful to see how considerate he is, and what interest he takes\r\nin all the things he never can share, poor fellow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nHollywell would be without Charlie! I wonder how soon he will be able to\r\ncome here! Hardly this year, I am afraid, for things must be comfortable\r\nfor him, and I shall never get them so without Amy, and then it will be\r\nautumn. Well, what next? Oh, you said window-curtains. Some blue sort\r\nof stuff, I suppose, like the drawing-room ones at Hollywell. What\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nname of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mrs. Ashford was much of his opinion, that he never would make\r\nthings comfortable without Amy, though he gave his best attention to the\r\ninquiries that were continually made of him; and where he had an idea,\r\ncarried it out to the utmost. He knew much better what he was about in\r\nthe arrangements for Coombe Prior, where he had installed his friend,\r\nMr. Wellwood, and set on foot many plans for improvements, giving them\r\nas much attention as if he had nothing else to occupy his mind. Both the\r\ncurate and Markham were surprised that he did not leave these details\r\ntill his return home; but he answered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better do things while we may. The thought of this unhappy place is\r\nenough to poison everything; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could rest without\r\nknowing that the utmost was being done for it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was very happy making arrangements for a village feast on the\r\nwedding-day. The Ashfords asked if he would not put it off till his\r\nreturn, and preside himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt them to have one first. Let them make sure of all the\r\nfun they can,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered; and the sentiment was greatly applauded by\r\nEdward and Robert, who followed him about more than ever, and grew so\r\nfond of him, that it made them very angry to be reminded of the spirit\r\nof defiance in which their acquaintance had begun. Nevertheless they\r\nseemed to be preparing the same spirit for his wife, for when their\r\nmother told them they must not expect to monopolize him thus when he was\r\nmarried, they declared, that they did not want a Lady Morville at all,\r\nand could not think why he was so stupid as to want a wife.\r\n\r\nTheir father predicted that he would never have time to fulfil his old\r\nengagement of taking them out to the Shag Rock, but the prediction was\r\nnot verified, for he rowed both them and Mr. Ashford thither one fine\r\nMay afternoon, showed them all they wanted to see, and let them scramble\r\nto their heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. He laughed at their hoard of scraps of the\r\nwood of the wreck, which they said their mamma had desired them to fetch\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nSo many avocations came upon Guy at once,--so many of the neighbours\r\ncame to call on him,--such varieties of people wanted to speak\r\nto him,--the boys followed him so constantly,--and he had so many\r\ninvitations from Mr. Wellwood and the Ashfords, that he never had any\r\ntime for himself, except what must be spent in writing to Amabel. There\r\nwas a feeling upon him, that he must have time to commune with himself,\r\nand rest from this turmoil of occupation, in the solitude of which\r\nRedclyffe had hitherto been so full. He wanted to be alone with his old\r\nhome, and take leave of it, and of the feelings of his boyhood, before\r\nbeginning on this new era of his life; but whenever he set out for a\r\nsolitary walk, before he could even get to the top of the crag, either\r\nMarkham marched up to talk over some important question,--a farmer\r\nwaylaid him to make some request,--some cottager met him, to tell of a\r\ngrievance,--Mr. Wellwood rode over,--or the Ashford boys rushed up, and\r\nfollowed like his shadow.\r\n\r\nAt length, on Ascension day, the last before he was to leave Redclyffe,\r\nwith a determination that he would escape for once from his pursuers, he\r\nwalked to the Cove as soon as he returned from morning service, launched\r\nhis little boat and pushed off into the rippling whispering waters. It\r\nwas a resumption of the ways of his boyhood; it seemed like a holiday to\r\nhave left all these cares behind him, just as it used to be when all his\r\nlessons were prepared, and he had leave to disport himself, by land or\r\nwater, the whole afternoon, provided he did not go out beyond the Shag\r\nRock. He took up his sculls and rowed merrily, singing and whistling to\r\nkeep time with their dash, the return to the old pleasure quite enough\r\nat first, the salt breeze, the dashing waves, the motion of the boat.\r\nSo he went on till he had come as far as his former boundary, then\r\nhe turned and gazed back on the precipitous rocks, cleft with deep\r\nfissures, marbled with veins of different shades of red, and tufted here\r\nand therewith clumps of samphire, grass, and a little brushwood, bright\r\nwith the early green of spring. The white foam and spray were leaping\r\nagainst their base, and roaring in their hollows; the tract of wavelets\r\nbetween glittered in light, or heaved green under the shadow of the\r\npassing clouds; the sea-birds floated smoothly in sweeping undulating\r\nlines,\r\n\r\n\r\n       As though life\xe2\x80\x99s only call and care\r\n       Were graceful motion;\r\n\r\n\r\nthe hawks poised themselves high in air near the rocks. The Cove lay in\r\nsunshine, its rough stone chimneys and rude slate roofs overgrown\r\nwith moss and fern, rising rapidly, one above the other, in the\r\nfast descending hollow, through which a little stream rushed to the\r\nsea,--more quietly than its brother, which, at some space distant, fell\r\nsheer down over the crag in a white line of foam, brawling with a tone\r\nof its own, distinguishable among all the voices of the sea contending\r\nwith the rocks. Above the village, in the space where the outline of two\r\nhills met and crossed, rose the pinnacled tower of the village church,\r\nthe unusual height of which was explained by the old custom of lighting\r\na beacon-fire on its summit, to serve as a guide to the boats at sea.\r\nStill higher, apparently on the very brow of the beetling crag that\r\nfrowned above, stood the old Gothic hall, crumbling and lofty, a fit\r\neyrie for the eagles of Morville. The sunshine was indeed full upon\r\nit; but it served to show how many of the dark windows were without the\r\nlining of blinds and curtains, that alone gives the look of life and\r\nhabitation to a house. How crumbled by sea-wind were the old walls, and\r\nthe aspect altogether full of a dreary haughtiness, suiting with the\r\nwhole of the stories connected with its name, from the time when it\r\nwas said the very dogs crouched and fled from the presence of the\r\nsacrilegious murderer of the Archbishop, to the evening when the heir of\r\nthe line lay stretched a corpse before his father\xe2\x80\x99s gate.\r\n\r\nGuy sat resting on his oars, gazing at the scene, full of happiness,\r\nyet with a sense that it might be too bright to last, as if it scarcely\r\nbefitted one like himself. The bliss before him, though it was surely a\r\nbeam from heaven, was so much above him, that he hardly dared to believe\r\nit real: like a child repeating, \xe2\x80\x98Is it my own, my very own?\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\npausing before it will venture to grasp at a prize beyond its hopes. He\r\nfeared to trust himself fully, lest it should carry him away from his\r\nself-discipline, and dazzle him too much to let him keep his gaze on the\r\nlight beyond; and he rejoiced in this time of quiet, to enable him\r\nto strive for power over his mind, to prevent himself from losing in\r\ngladness the balance he had gained in adversity.\r\n\r\nIt was such a check as he might have wished for, to look at that grim\r\nold castle, recollect who he was, and think of the frail tenure of all\r\nearthly joy, especially for one of the house of Morville. Could that\r\nabode ever be a home for a creature like Amy, with the bright innocent\r\nmirth that seemed too soft and sweet ever to be overshadowed by gloom\r\nand sorrow? Perhaps she might be early taken from him in the undimmed\r\nbeauty of her happiness and innocence, and he might have to struggle\r\nthrough a long lonely life with only the remembrance of a short-lived\r\njoy to lighten it; and when he reflected that this was only a melancholy\r\nfancy, the answer came from within, that there was nothing peculiar to\r\nhim in the perception that earthly happiness was fleeting. It was\r\nbest that so it should be, and that he should rest in the trust that\r\nbrightened on him through all,--that neither life nor death, sorrow nor\r\npain, could separate, for ever, him and his Amy.\r\n\r\nAnd he looked up into the deep blue sky overhead, murmuring to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In heart and mind thither ascend, and with Him continually dwell,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ngazed long and intently as he rocked on the green waters, till he again\r\nspoke to himself,--\xe2\x80\x98Why stand ye here gazing up into heaven?\xe2\x80\x99 then\r\npulled vigorously back to the shore, leaving a shining wake far behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 29\r\n\r\n     Hark, how the birds do sing,\r\n     And woods do ring!\r\n     All creatures have their joy, and man hath his;\r\n     Yet if we rightly measure,\r\n     Man\xe2\x80\x99s joy and pleasure\r\n     Rather hereafter than in present is:\r\n\r\n     Not that he may not here\r\n     Taste of the cheer,\r\n     But as birds drink and straight lift up the head,\r\n     So must he sip and think\r\n     Of better drink\r\n     He may attain to after he is dead.\r\n                                   --HERBERT\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy returned to Hollywell on the Friday, there to spend a quiet week\r\nwith them all, for it was a special delight to Amy that Hollywell and\r\nher family were as precious to him for their own sakes as for hers. It\r\nwas said that it was to be a quiet week--but with all the best efforts\r\nof Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura to preserve quiet, there was an amount, of\r\nconfusion that would have been very disturbing, but for Amy\xe2\x80\x99s propensity\r\nnever to be ruffled or fluttered.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done in the honeymoon was the question for consideration.\r\nGuy and Amy would have liked to make a tour among the English\r\ncathedrals, pay a visit at Hollywell, and then go home and live in a\r\ncorner of the house till the rest was ready; for Amy could not see why\r\nshe should take up so much more room than old Sir Guy, and Guy declared\r\nhe could not see that happiness was a reason for going pleasure-hunting;\r\nbut Charles pronounced this very stupid, and Mr. Edmonstone thought a\r\njourney on the Continent was the only proper thing for them to do. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone wished Amy to see a little of the world. Amy was known to\r\nhave always desired to see Switzerland; it occurred to Guy that it would\r\nbe a capital opportunity of taking Arnaud to see the relations he\r\nhad been talking for the last twenty years of visiting, and so they\r\nacquiesced; for as Guy said, when they talked it over together, it did\r\nnot seem to him to come under the denomination of pleasure-hunting,\r\nsince they had not devised it for themselves; they had no house to\r\ngo to; they should do Arnaud a service, and perhaps they should meet\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That will not be pleasure-hunting, certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; then,\r\nremembering that he could not bear to hear Philip under-rated, she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98I mean, unless you could convince him, and then it would be more\r\nthan pleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be my first of unattained wishes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Then we will\r\nenjoy the journey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No fear on that score,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And for fear we should get too much into the stream of enjoyment, as\r\npeople abroad forget home-duties, let us stick to some fixed time for\r\ncoming back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You said Redclyffe would be ready by Michaelmas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have told the builder it must be. So, Amy, as far as it depends on\r\nourselves, we are determined to be at home by Michaelmas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll seemed surprised to find the time for the wedding so near at hand.\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s spirits began to flag, Amy was a greater loss to him than to\r\nanybody else; she could never again be to him what she had been, and\r\nunable as he was to take part in the general bustle and occupation, he\r\nhad more time for feeling this, much more than his mother and Laura, who\r\nwere employed all day. He and Guy were exemplary in their civilities to\r\neach other in not engrossing Amy, and one who had only known him three\r\nyears ago, when he was all exaction and selfishness, could have hardly\r\nbelieved him to be the same person who was now only striving to avoid\r\ngiving pain, by showing how much it cost him to yield up his sister. He\r\ncould contrive to be merry, but the difficulty was to be cheerful; he\r\ncould make them all laugh in spite of themselves, but when alone with\r\nAmy, or when hearing her devolve on her sisters the services she had\r\nbeen wont to perform for him, it was almost more than he could endure;\r\nbut then he dreaded setting Amy off into one of her silent crying-fits,\r\nfor which the only remedy was the planning a grand visit to Redclyffe,\r\nand talking overall the facilities of railroads and carriages.\r\n\r\nThe last day had come, and a long strange one it was; not exactly joyful\r\nto any, and very sad to some, though Amy, with her sweet pensive face,\r\nseemed to have a serenity of her own that soothed them whenever they\r\nlooked at her. Charlotte, though inclined to be wild and flighty,\r\nwas checked and subdued in her presence; Laura could not be entirely\r\nwretched about her; Charles lay and looked at her without speaking; her\r\nfather never met her without kissing her on each side of her face, and\r\ncalling her his little jewel; her mother--but who could describe Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone on that day, so full of the present pain, contending with the\r\nunselfish gladness.\r\n\r\nGuy kept out of the way, thinking Amy ought to be left to them. He sat\r\nin his own room a good while, afterwards rode to Broadstone, in coming\r\nhome made a long visit to Mr. Ross; and when he returned, he found\r\nCharles in his wheeled chair on the lawn, with Amy sitting on the grass\r\nby his side. He sat down by her and there followed a long silence,--one\r\nof those pauses full of meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When shall we three meet again?\xe2\x80\x99 at length said Charles, in a would-be\r\nlively tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And where?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98you will come here to tell your adventures, and\r\ntake up Bustle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98We could not help it. The telling you about it\r\nwill be a treat to look forward to all the time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; your sight-seeing is a public benefit. You have seen many a thing\r\nfor me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the pleasure of seeing and hearing, the thing that is not\r\nfleeting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The unselfish part, you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; and mused again, till Guy,\r\nstarting up, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are the people!\xe2\x80\x99 as a carriage came in view in the lane. \xe2\x80\x98Shall I\r\nwheel you home, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy leant over the back, and pushed him along; and as he did so murmured\r\nin a low tremulous tone, \xe2\x80\x98Wherever or whenever we may be destined to\r\nmeet, Charlie, or if never again, I must thank you for a great part of\r\nmy happiness here--for a great deal of kindness and sympathy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles looked straight before him, and answered--\xe2\x80\x98The kindness was\r\nall on your part. I had nothing to give in return but ill-temper and\r\nexactions. But, Guy, you must not think I have not felt all you have\r\ndone for me. You have made a new man of me, instead of a wretched stick,\r\nlaughing at my misery, to persuade myself and others that I did not feel\r\nit. I hope you are proud of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if I had anything to do with it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, you, that\xe2\x80\x99s all! I know what you won\xe2\x80\x99t deny, at any rate--what\r\na capital man-of-all-work you have been to me, when I had no right to\r\nask it, as now we have,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, smiling, because Amy was looking at\r\nhim, but not making a very successful matter of the smile. \xe2\x80\x98When you\r\ncome back, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see me treat you as indeed \xe2\x80\x9ca man and a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis talk retarded them a little, and they did not reach the house till\r\nthe guests were arriving. The first sight that met the eyes of Aunt\r\nCharlotte and Lady Eveleen as they entered, was, in the frame of the\r\nopen window, Guy\xe2\x80\x99s light agile figure, assisting Charles up the step,\r\nhis brilliant hazel eyes and glowing healthy complexion contrasting with\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s pale, fair, delicate face, and features sharpened and refined\r\nby suffering. Amy, her deep blushes and downcast eyes almost hidden by\r\nher glossy curls, stood just behind, carrying her brother\xe2\x80\x99s crutch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There they are,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Miss Edmonstone, springing forward from her\r\nbrother and his wife, and throwing her arms round Amy in a warm embrace.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, dear little niece, I congratulate you with all my heart, and\r\nthat I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare your hot cheeks, Amy dearest!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Eveleen, as Amy\r\npassed to her embrace, while Aunt Charlotte hastily kissed Charles,\r\nand proceeded--\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for an introduction;\xe2\x80\x99 and vehemently shook\r\nhands with Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, did I say a word too much in his praise?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he all out as fine a fellow as I told you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was glad to turn away to shake hands with Lord Kilcoran, and the\r\nnext moment he drew Amy out of the group eagerly talking round Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsofa, and holding her hand, led her up to a sturdy, ruddy-brown, elderly\r\nman, who had come in at the same time, but after the first reception had\r\nno share in the family greetings. \xe2\x80\x98You know him, already,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; and\r\nAmy held out her hand, saying--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I am sure I do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMarkham was taken by surprise, he gave a most satisfied grunt, and shook\r\nhands as heartily as if she had been his favourite niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the little girl?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes.--I picked her up at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s: one of the servants took\r\ncharge of her in the hall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch her,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Charlotte, as Amy was turning to the door, and\r\nthe next moment she led in little Marianne Dixon, clinging to her hand.\r\nAmy kissed her, and held her fast in her arms, and Marianne looked up,\r\nconsoled in her bewilderment, by the greeting of her dear old friend,\r\nSir Guy.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone patted her head; and when the others had spoken kindly to\r\nher, Charlotte, under whose especial charge Guy and Amy had placed her,\r\ncarried her off to the regions up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was hurry and confusion. Mrs. Edmonstone was\r\nvery busy, and glad to be so, as she must otherwise have given way; and\r\nthere was Aunt Charlotte to be talked to, whom they had not seen since\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s illness. She was a short, bustling, active person, with a\r\njoyous face, inexhaustible good-humour, a considerable touch of Irish,\r\nand referring everything to her mother,--her one thought. Everything was\r\nto be told to her, and the only drawback to her complete pleasure was\r\nthe anxiety lest she should be missed at home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was occupied with her, telling her the history of the\r\nengagement, and praising Guy; Amy went up as soon as dinner was over,\r\nto take leave of old nurse, and to see little Marianne; and Eveleen sat\r\nbetween Laura and Charlotte, asking many eager questions, which were not\r\nall convenient to answer.\r\n\r\nWhy Sir Guy had not been at home at Christmas was a query to which it\r\nseemed as if she should never gain a reply; for that Charles had been\r\nill, and Guy at Redclyffe, was no real answer; and finding she should\r\nnot be told, she wisely held her tongue. Again she made an awkward\r\ninquiry--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now tell me, is Captain Morville pleased about this or not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura would have been silent, trusting to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s propensity for\r\ntalking, for bringing her to some speech that it might be easier to\r\nanswer, but Charlotte exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98What has he been saying about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Saying? O nothing. But why does not he come?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have seen him more lately than we have,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is an evasion,\xe2\x80\x99 said Eveleen; \xe2\x80\x98as if you did not know more of his\r\nmind than I could ever get at, if I saw him every day of my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is provoking, that is all,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant him; but Laura and Guy will both of them take his part.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA call came at that moment,--the box of white gloves was come, and Laura\r\nmust come and count them. She would fain have taken Charlotte with her;\r\nbut neither Charlotte nor Eveleen appeared disposed to move, and she\r\nwas obliged to leave them. Eva had already guessed that there was more\r\nchance of hearing the facts from Charlotte, and presently she knew a\r\ngood deal. Charlotte had some prudence, but she thought she might\r\ntell her own cousin what half the neighbourhood knew--that Philip had\r\nsuspected Guy falsely, and had made papa very angry with him, that the\r\nengagement had been broken off, and Guy had been banished, while all the\r\ntime he was behaving most gloriously. Now it was all explained; but\r\nin spite of the fullest certainty, Philip would not be convinced, and\r\nwanted them to have waited five years.\r\n\r\nEveleen agreed with Charlotte that this was a great deal too bad,\r\nadmired Guy, and pitied Amy to her heart\xe2\x80\x99s content.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So, he was banished, regularly banished!\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98However of course\r\nAmy never gave him up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, she never mistrusted him one minute.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And while he had her fast, it was little he would care for the rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if he had known it, but she could not tell him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEveleen looked arch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But I am sure she did not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, rather angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know nothing about it, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but I do; for mamma said to Charlie how beautifully she did\r\nbehave, and he too,--never attempting any intercourse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very good of you to believe it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure of it, certain sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98How could you venture\r\nto think they would either of them do anything wrong?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not say they would.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, not to write to each other when papa had forbidden it, and do it\r\nin secret, too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, don\xe2\x80\x99t look so innocently irate. Goodness has nothing to do\r\nwith it, it would be only a moderate constancy. You know nothing at all\r\nof lovers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I know nothing of lovers, I know a great deal of Amy and Guy, and I\r\nam quite sure that nothing on earth would tempt them to do anything in\r\nsecret that they were forbidden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wait till you are in love, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll change your mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never mean to be in love,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte indignantly. Eveleen\r\nlaughed the more, Charlotte grew more angry and uncomfortable at the\r\ntone of the conversation, and was heartily glad that it was broken off\r\nby the entrance of the gentlemen. Guy helped Charles to the sofa, and\r\nthen turned away to continue his endless talk on Redclyffe business with\r\nMarkham. Charlotte flew up to the sofa, seized an interval when no one\r\nwas in hearing, and kneeling down to bring her face on a level with her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s whispered--\xe2\x80\x98Charlie, Eva won\xe2\x80\x99t believe but that Guy and Amy\r\nkept up some intercourse last winter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I tell her they did not, she only laughs at me. Do tell her they\r\ndid not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have too much self-respect to lay myself open to ridicule.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlie, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it possible yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charlotte, in\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Possible--no indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She _will_ say it is not wrong, and that I know nothing of lovers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You should have told her that ours are not commonplace lovers, but far\r\nbeyond her small experience.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I had! Tell her so, Charlie; she will believe you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t say one word about it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because she is not worthy. If she can\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate them, I would let\r\nher alone. I once thought better of Eva, but it is very bad company she\r\nkeeps when she is not here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles, however, was not sorry when Eveleen came to sit by him, for a\r\nbantering conversation with her was the occupation of which he was moat\r\ncapable. Amy, returning, came and sat in her old place beside him, with\r\nher hand in his, and her quiet eyes fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe last evening for many weeks that she would thus sit with him,--the\r\nlast that she would ever be a part of his home. She had already ceased\r\nto belong entirely to him; she who had always been the most precious to\r\nhim, except his mother.\r\n\r\nOnly his mother could have been a greater loss,--he could not dwell\r\non the anticipation; and still holding her hand, he roused himself to\r\nlisten, and answer gaily to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s description of the tutor, Mr.\r\nFielder, \xe2\x80\x98a thorough gentleman, very clever and agreeable, who had read\r\nall the books in the world; the ugliest, yes, without exaggeration, the\r\nmost quaintly ugly man living,--little, and looking just as if he was\r\nmade of gutta percha, Eveleen said, \xe2\x80\x98always moving by jerks,--so Maurice\r\nadvised the boys not to put him near the fire, lest he should melt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only when he gives them some formidable lesson, and they want to\r\nmelt his heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, talking at random, in hopes of saying\r\nsomething laughable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then his eyes--\xe2\x80\x98tis not exactly a squint, but a cast there is, and one\r\nset of eyelashes are black and the other light, and that gives him just\r\nthe air of a little frightful terrier of Maurice\xe2\x80\x99s named Venus, with a\r\nblack spot over one eye. The boys never call him anything but Venus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you encourage them in respect for their tutor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, he holds his own at lessons, I trow; but he pretends to have such\r\na horror of us wild Irish, and to wonder not to find us eating potatoes\r\nwith our fingers, and that I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear a petticoat over my head instead\r\nof a bonnet, in what he calls the classical Carthaginian Celto-Hibernian\r\nfashion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98no wonder Philip recommended him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, I assure you he has the gift, no one else but Captain Morville talks\r\nnear as well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo talked on Eveleen, and Charles answered her as much in her own\r\nfashion as he could, and when at last the evening came to an end, every\r\none felt relieved.\r\n\r\nLaura lingered long in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s room, perceiving that hitherto she had\r\nknown only half the value of her sister her sweet sister. It would\r\nbe worse than ever now, when left with the others, all so much less\r\nsympathizing, all saying sharp things of Philip, none to cling to her\r\nwith those winsome ways that had been unnoted till the time when they\r\nwere no more to console her, and she felt them to have been the only\r\ncharm that had softened her late dreary desolation.\r\n\r\nSo full was her heart, that she must have told Amy all her grief but for\r\nthe part that Philip had acted towards Guy, and her doubts of Guy would\r\nnot allow her the consolation of dwelling on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, which\r\ncheered the rest. She could only hang about her in speechless grief, and\r\ncaress her fondly, while Amy cried, and tried to comfort her, till her\r\nmother came to wish her good night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone did not stay long, because she wished Amy, if possible\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, as she received her last kiss, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t think why I am\r\nnot more unhappy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all as it should be,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\nAmabel slept, and awakened to the knowledge that it was her wedding-day.\r\nShe was not to appear at the first breakfast, but she came to meet\r\nCharles in the dressing-room; and as they sat together on the sofa,\r\nwhere she had watched and amused so many of his hours of helplessness,\r\nhe clasped round her arm his gift,--a bracelet of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s hair. His\r\nfingers trembled and his eyes were hazy, but he would not let her help\r\nhim. Her thanks were obliged to be all kisses, no words would come but\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlie; Charlie! how could I ever have promised to leave you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense! who ever dreamt that my sisters were to be three monkeys tied\r\nto a dog?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to smile, though it was but for a\r\nmoment,--Charles\xe2\x80\x99s mirth was melancholy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, dear Charlie, you will not miss me so very much; do pray let\r\nCharlotte wait upon you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98After the first, perhaps, I may not hate her. Oh, Amy, I little knew\r\nwhat I was doing when I tried to get him back again for you. I was\r\nsawing off the bough I was sitting on. But there! I will not flatter\r\nyou, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough to turn that head of yours. Stand up, and let\r\nme take a survey. Very pretty, I declare,--you do my education credit.\r\nThere, if it will be for your peace, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to wear on without\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted a brother all my life, and you are giving me the very\r\none I would have picked out of a thousand--the only one I could forgive\r\nfor presuming to steal you, Amy. Here he is. Come in,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, as Guy\r\nknocked at his door, to offer to help him down-stairs.\r\n\r\nGuy hardly spoke, and Amy could not look in his face. It was late, and\r\nhe took down Charles at once. After this, she had very little quiet,\r\nevery one was buzzing about her, and putting the last touches to her\r\ndress; at last, just as she was quite finished, Charlotte exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, there is Guy\xe2\x80\x99s step; may I call him in to have one look?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone did not say no; and Charlotte, opening the dressing-room\r\ndoor, called to him. He stood opposite to Amy for some moments, then\r\nsaid, with a smile, \xe2\x80\x98I was wrong about the grogram. I would not for\r\nanything see you look otherwise than you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura that these words made them lose\r\nsight of the details of lace and silk that had been occupying them, so\r\nthat they only saw the radiance, purity, and innocence of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s bridal\r\nappearance. No more was said, for Mr. Edmonstone ran up to call Guy, who\r\nwas to drive Charles in the pony-carriage.\r\n\r\nAmabel, of course, went with her parents. Poor child! her tears flowed\r\nfreely on the way, and Mr. Edmonstone, now that it had really come to\r\nthe point of parting with his little Amy, was very much overcome, while\r\nhis wife, hardly refraining from tears, could only hold her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand very close.\r\n\r\nThe regular morning service was a great comfort, by restoring their\r\ntranquillity, and by the time it was ended, Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s countenance had\r\nsettled into its own calm expression of trust and serenity. She scarcely\r\neven trembled when her father led her forward; her hand did not shake,\r\nand her voice, though very low, was firm and audible, while Guy\xe2\x80\x99s deep,\r\nsweet tones had a sort of thrill and quiver of intense feeling.\r\n\r\nNo one could help observing that Laura was the most agitated person\r\npresent; she trembled so much that she was obliged to lean on Charlotte,\r\nand her tears gave the infection to the other bridesmaids--all but Mary\r\nRoss, who could never cry when other people did, and little Marianne,\r\nwho did nothing but look and wonder.\r\n\r\nMary was feeling a great deal, both of compassion for the bereaved\r\nfamily and of affectionate admiring joy for the young pair who knelt\r\nbefore the altar. It was a showery day, with gleams of vivid sunshine,\r\nand one of these suddenly broke forth, casting a stream of colour from a\r\nmartyr\xe2\x80\x99s figure in the south window, so as to shed a golden glory on the\r\nwave of brown hair over Guy\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, then passing on and tinting the\r\nbride\xe2\x80\x99s white veil with a deep glowing shade of crimson and purple.\r\n\r\nEither that golden light, or the expression of the face on which it\r\nbeamed, made Mary think of the lines--\r\n\r\n\r\n         Where is the brow to wear in mortal\xe2\x80\x99s sight,\r\n         The crown of pure angelic light?\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles stood with his head leaning against a pillar as if he could not\r\nbear to look up; Mr. Edmonstone was restless and almost sobbing; Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone alone collected, though much flushed and somewhat trembling,\r\nwhile the only person apparently free from excitement was the little\r\nbride, as there she knelt, her hand clasped in his, her head bent down,\r\nher modest, steadfast face looking as if she was only conscious of\r\nthe vow she exchanged, the blessing she received, and was, as it were,\r\nlifted out of herself.\r\n\r\nIt was over now. The feast, in its fullest sense, was held, and the\r\nrichest of blessings had been called down on them.\r\n\r\nThe procession came out of the vestry in full order, and very pretty it\r\nwas; the bride and bridegroom in the fresh bright graciousness of\r\ntheir extreme youth, and the six bridesmaids following; Laura and Lady\r\nEveleen, two strikingly handsome and elegant girls; Charlotte, with the\r\npretty little fair Marianne; Mary Ross, and Grace Harper. The village\r\npeople who stood round might well say that such a sight as that was\r\nworth coming twenty miles to see.\r\n\r\nThe first care, after the bridal pair had driven off, was to put Charles\r\ninto his pony-carriage. Charlotte, who had just pinned on his favour,\r\nbegged to drive him, for she meant to make him her especial charge,\r\nand to succeed to all Amy\xe2\x80\x99s rights. Mrs. Edmonstone asked whether Laura\r\nwould not prefer going with him, but she hastily answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, let Charlotte;\xe2\x80\x99 for with her troubled feelings, she\r\ncould better answer talking girls than parry the remarks of her shrewd,\r\nobservant brother.\r\n\r\nSome one said it would rain, but Charlotte still pleaded earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, then, puss,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, rallying his spirits, \xe2\x80\x98only don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nupset me, or it will spoil their tour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte drove off with elaborate care,--then came a deep sigh, and she\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Well! he is our brother, and all is safe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98no more fears for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had you any? I am very glad if you had.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because it was so like a book. I had a sort of feeling, all the time,\r\nthat Philip would come in quite grand and terrible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if he must act Ogre. I am not sure that I had not something of\r\nthe same notion,--that he might appear suddenly, and forbid the banns,\r\nentirely for Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and as the greatest kindness to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, he can\xe2\x80\x99t separate them now; let him do his worst, and while\r\nAmy is Guy\xe2\x80\x99s wife, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we shall easily be made to quarrel. I\r\nam glad the knot is tied, for I had a fatality notion that the feud was\r\nso strong, that it was nearly a case of the mountains bending and the\r\nstreams ascending, ere she was to be our foeman\xe2\x80\x99s bride.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98it ought to be like that story of Rosaura and\r\nher kindred, don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember? The fate would not be appeased by the\r\nmarriage, till Count Julius had saved the life of one of the hostile\r\nrace. That would be _it_,--perhaps they will meet abroad, and Guy will\r\n_do_ _it_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That won\xe2\x80\x99t do. Philip will never endanger his precious life, nor ever\r\nforgive Guy the obligation. Well, I suppose there never was a prettier\r\nwedding--how silly of me to say so, I shall be sick of hearing it before\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do wish all these people were gone; I did not know it would be so\r\nhorrid. I should like to shut myself up and cry, and think what I could\r\never do to wait on you. Indeed, Charlie, I know I never can be like Amy\r\nbut if you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be anything but sentimental; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a fool of myself\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles, with a smile and tone as if he was keeping sorrow at bay.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it if we were left to ourselves this evening, we should be\r\nso desperately savage that we should quarrel furiously, and there would\r\nbe no Amy to set us to rights.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How Aunt Charlotte did cry! What a funny little woman she is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I see now who you take after, puss. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be just like her when\r\nyou are her age.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So I mean to be,--I mean to stay and take care of you all my life, as\r\nshe does of grandmamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do, do you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I never mean to marry, it is so disagreeable. O dear! But how\r\nlovely dear Amy did look.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the rain!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Charles, as some large drops began to fall\r\nin good time to prevent them from being either savage or sentimental,\r\nthough at the expense of Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s pink and white; for they had no\r\numbrella, and she would not accept a share of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s carriage-cloak.\r\nShe laughed, and drove on fast through the short cut, and arrived at the\r\nhouse-door, just as the pelting hail was over, having battered her thin\r\nsleeves, and made her white bonnet look very deplorable. The first thing\r\nthey saw was Guy, with Bustle close to him, for Bustle had found out\r\nthat something was going on that concerned his master, and followed him\r\nabout more assiduously than ever, as if sensible of the decree, that he\r\nwas to be left behind to Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte, how wet you are.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind, Charlie is not.\xe2\x80\x99 She sprung out, holding his hand, and\r\nfelt as if she could never forget that moment when her new brother first\r\nkissed her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 and while Guy lifted Charles out, Charlotte was clasped in her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you wet, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, Charlotte would not be wise, and made me keep the cloak to myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are wet through, poor child; come up at once, and change,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmy, flying nimbly up the stairs,--up even to Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s own room, the\r\nold nursery, and there she was unfastening the drenched finery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Amy, don\xe2\x80\x99t do all this. Let me ring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, the servants are either not come home or are too busy. Charles\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t want me, he has Guy. Can I find your white frock?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but Amy--let me see!\xe2\x80\x99 Charlotte made prisoner the left hand, and\r\nlooked up with an arch smile at the face where she had called up a\r\nblush. \xe2\x80\x98Lady Morville must not begin by being lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me--let me, Charlotte, dear, I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do anything for\r\nyou this long time.\xe2\x80\x99 Amy\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled, and Charlotte held her fast\r\nto kiss her again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must make haste,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, recovering herself. \xe2\x80\x98There are the\r\ncarriages.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile the frock was being fastened, Charlotte looked into the\r\nPrayer-book Amy had laid down. There was the name, Amabel Frances\r\nMorville, and the date.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he just written it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; when we came home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Amy! dear, dear Amy; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether I am glad or sorry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe I am both,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura hastened in. Then was the time\r\nfor broken words, tears and smiles, as Amy leant against her mother, who\r\nlocked her in a close embrace, and gazed on her in a sort of trance, at\r\nonce of maternal pride and of pain, at giving up her cherished nestling.\r\nPoor Laura! how bitter were her tears, and how forced her smiles,--far\r\nunlike the rest!\r\n\r\nNo one would care to hear the details of the breakfast, and the\r\nsplendours of the cake; how Charlotte recovered her spirits while\r\ndistributing the favours: and Lady Eveleen set up a flirtation with\r\nMarkham, and forced him into wearing one, though he protested, with many\r\na grunt, that she was making a queer fool of him; how often Charles was\r\nobliged to hear it had been a pretty wedding; and how well Lord Kilcoran\r\nmade his speech proposing the health of Sir Guy and Lady Morville. All\r\nthe time, Laura was active and useful,--feeling as if she was acting a\r\nplay, sustaining the character of Miss Edmonstone, the bridesmaid at\r\nher sister\xe2\x80\x99s happy marriage; while the true Laura, Philip\xe2\x80\x99s Laura, was\r\nlonely, dejected, wretched; half fearing for her sister, half jealous\r\nof her happiness, forced into pageantry with an aching heart,--with only\r\none wish, that it was over, and that she might be again alone with her\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nShe was glad when her mother rose, and the ladies moved into the\r\ndrawing-room,--glad to escape from Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s quick eye, and to avoid\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s clear sense,--glad to talk to comparative strangers,--glad of\r\nthe occupation of going to prepare Amabel for her journey. This lasted\r\na long time,--there was so much to be said, and hearts were so full,\r\nand Amy over again explained to Charlotte how to perform all the little\r\nservices to Charles which she relinquished; while her mother had so many\r\naffectionate last words, and every now and then stopped short to look at\r\nher little daughter, saying, she did not know if it was not a dream.\r\n\r\nAt length Amabel was dressed in her purple and white shot silk, her\r\nmuslin mantle, and white bonnet. Mrs. Edmonstone left her and Laura\r\nto have a few words together, and went to the dressing-room. There she\r\nfound Guy, leaning on the mantelshelf, as he used to do when he brought\r\nhis troubles to her. He started as she entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ought I not to be here? he said. \xe2\x80\x98I could not help coming once more.\r\nThis room has always been the kernel of my home, my happiness here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, it has been a very great pleasure to have you here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been very kind to me,\xe2\x80\x99 he proceeded, in a low, reflecting\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x98You have helped me very much, very often; even when--Do you\r\nremember the day I begged you to keep me in order, as if I were Charles?\r\nI did not think then--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent; and Mrs. Edmonstone little able to find words, smiling,\r\ntried to say,--\xe2\x80\x98I little thought how truly and how gladly I should be\r\nable to call you my son;\xe2\x80\x99 and ended by giving him a mother\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish I could tell you half,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,--\xe2\x80\x98half what I feel for the\r\nkindness that made a home to one who had no right to any. Coming as a\r\nstranger, I found--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We found one to love with all our hearts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave often looked back, and seen that you brought a brightness to us\r\nall--especially to poor Charles. Yes, it dates from your coming; and I\r\ncan only wish and trust, Guy, that the same brightness will rest on your\r\nown home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There must be brightness where she is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I need not tell you to take care of her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x98I think I can trust you; but I feel rather as I did when first\r\nI sent her and Laura to a party of pleasure by themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura at this moment, came in. Alone with Amy, she could not speak, she\r\ncould only cry; and fearful of distressing her sister, she came away;\r\nbut here, with Guy, it was worse, for it was unkind not to speak one\r\nwarm word to him. Yet what could she say! He spoke first--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, you must get up your looks again, now this turmoil is over.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t do too much mathematics, and wear yourself down to a shadow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura gave her sad, forced smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you do one thing for me, Laura? I should like to have one of\r\nyour perspective views of the inside of the church. Would it be too\r\ntroublesome to do?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; I shall be very glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t set about it till you quite like it, and have plenty of time.\r\nThank you. I shall think it is a proof that you can forgive me for all\r\nthe pain I am causing you. I am very sorry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are so very kind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, bursting into tears; and, as her\r\nmother was gone, she could not help adding, \xe2\x80\x98but don\xe2\x80\x99t try to comfort\r\nme, Guy; don\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself,--\xe2\x80\x98tisn\xe2\x80\x99t only that,--but I am so very,\r\nvery unhappy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy told me you were grieved for Philip. I wish I could help it, Laura.\r\nI want to try to meet him in Switzerland, and, if we can, perhaps it may\r\nbe set right. At any rate he will be glad to know you see the rights of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura wept still more; but she could never again lose the sisterly\r\nfeeling those kind words had awakened. If Philip had but known what he\r\nmissed!\r\n\r\nCharlotte ran in. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am glad to find you here, Guy; I wanted to put\r\nyou in mind of your promise. You must write me the first letter you sign\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour affectionate brother!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget, Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy! Where\xe2\x80\x99s Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 called Mr. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98The rain\xe2\x80\x99s going off. You\r\nmust come down, both of you, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll be too late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone hastened to call Amabel. Those moments that she had\r\nbeen alone, Amabel had been kneeling in an earnest supplication that all\r\nmight be forgiven that she had done amiss in the home of her childhood,\r\nthat the blessings might be sealed on her and her husband, and that she\r\nmight go forth from her father\xe2\x80\x99s house in strength sent from above. Her\r\nmother summoned her; she rose, came calmly forth, met Guy at the head of\r\nthe stairs, put her arm in his, and they went down.\r\n\r\nCharles was on the sofa in the ante-room, talking fast, and striving for\r\nhigh spirits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, woman, you do us credit! Well, write soon, and don\xe2\x80\x99t break your\r\nheart for want of me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a confusion of good-byes, and then all came out to the hall\r\ndoor; even Charles, with Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s arm. One more of those fast-locked\r\nembraces between the brother and sister, and Mr. Edmonstone put Amabel\r\ninto the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, good-bye, my own dearest little one! Bless you, bless you!\r\nand may you be as happy as a Mayflower! Guy, goodbye. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you\r\nthe best I had to give,--and \xe2\x80\x98tis you that are welcome to her. Take care\r\nwhat you do with her, for she\xe2\x80\x99s a precious little jewel! Good-bye, my\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s face and grasping hand were the reply. As he was about to spring\r\ninto the carriage, he turned again. \xe2\x80\x98Charlotte, I have shut Bustle up in\r\nmy room. Will you let him out in half an hour? I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained it all to\r\nhim, and he will be very good. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention him in every letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, Markham, mind, if our house is not ready by Michaelmas, we shall\r\nbe obliged to come and stay with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGrunt!\r\n\r\nLastly, as if he could not help it, Guy dashed up the step once more,\r\npressed Charles\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and said, \xe2\x80\x98God bless you, Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn an instant he was beside Amabel, and they drove off,--Amabel leaning\r\nforward, and gazing wistfully at her mother and Charles, till she was\r\nstartled by a long cluster of laburnums, their yellow bloom bent down\r\nand heavy with wet, so that the ends dashed against her bonnet, and the\r\ncrystal drops fell on her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, Amy, the Hollywell flowers are weeping for the loss of you!\r\n\r\nShe gave a sweet, sunny smile through her tears. At that moment they\r\ncame beyond the thick embowering shrubs, while full before them was the\r\ndark receding cloud, on which the sunbeams were painting a wide-spanned\r\nrainbow. The semicircle was perfect, and full before them, like an arch\r\nof triumph under which they were to pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How beautiful!\xe2\x80\x99 broke from them both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bride, after a few minutes had faded the rainbow, and\r\nturned them from its sight, \xe2\x80\x98shall I tell you what I was thinking? I\r\nwas thinking, that if there is a doom on us, I am not afraid, if it will\r\nonly bring a rainbow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The rainbow will come after, if not with it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 30\r\n\r\n     She\xe2\x80\x99s a winsome wee thing,\r\n     She\xe2\x80\x99s a handsome wee thing,\r\n     She\xe2\x80\x99s a bonnie wee thing,\r\n     This sweet wee wifie of mine.\r\n                        --BURNS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, pointing to a name in the traveller\xe2\x80\x99s book\r\nat Altdorf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Captain Morville!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98July 14th. That was only the day\r\nbefore yesterday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder whether we shall overtake him! Do you know what was this\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s route?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired Guy, in French that was daily becoming more\r\nproducible.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but his knapsack, had\r\nnot made much sensation. There was a vague idea that he had gone on\r\nto the St. Gothard; but the guide who was likely to know, was not\r\nforthcoming, and all Guy\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries only resulted in, \xe2\x80\x98I dare say we\r\nshall hear of him elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed, and she could see,\r\nthough he said nothing, that Guy was not very sorry. These two months\r\nhad been so very happy, there had been such full enjoyment, such freedom\r\nfrom care and vexation, or aught that could for a moment ruffle the\r\nstream of delight. Scenery, cathedrals music, paintings, historical\r\nassociation, had in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure; and,\r\nabove all, Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts inspired by\r\nthe scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of ideal happiness,\r\nso exquisite, that she could hardly believe it real. A taste of society,\r\nwhich they had at Munich, though very pleasant, had only made them\r\nmore glad to be alone together again; any companion would have been an\r\ninterruption, and Philip, so intimate, yet with his carping, persecuting\r\nspirit towards Guy, was one of the last persons she could wish to\r\nmeet; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition Guy wished to\r\nencourage, she held her peace.\r\n\r\nFor the present, no more was said about Philip; and they proceeded to\r\nInterlachen, where they spent a day or two, while Arnaud was with his\r\nrelations; and they visited the two beautiful lakes of Thun and Brientz.\r\nOn first coming among mountains, Amabel had been greatly afraid of\r\nthe precipices, and had been very much alarmed at the way in which Guy\r\nclambered about, with a sureness of foot and steadiness of head acquired\r\nlong ago on the crags of Redclyffe, and on which the guides were always\r\ncomplimenting him; but from seeing him always come down safe, and from\r\nhaving been enticed by him to several heights, which had at first seemed\r\nto her most dizzy and dangerous, she had gradually laid aside her fears,\r\nand even become slightly, very slightly, adventurous herself.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful evening, they were wandering on the side of the\r\nBeatenberg, in the little narrow paths traced by the tread of the goats\r\nand their herdsmen. Amabel sat down to try to sketch the outline of the\r\nwhite-capped Jung Frau and her attendant mountains, wishing she could\r\ndraw as well as Laura, but intending her outline to aid in describing\r\nthe scene to those whose eyes she longed to have with her. While she was\r\ndrawing, Guy began to climb higher, and was soon out of sight, though\r\nshe still heard him whistling. The mountains were not easy to draw,\r\nor rather she grew discontented with her black lines and white paper,\r\ncompared with the dazzling snow against the blue sky, tinged by the\r\nroseate tints of the setting sun, and the dark fissures on the rocky\r\nsides, still blacker from the contrast.\r\n\r\nShe put up her sketching materials, and began to gather some of the\r\ndelightful treasury of mountain flowers. A gentle slope of grass was\r\nclose to her, and on it grew, at some little distance from her, a tuft\r\nof deep purple, the beautiful Alpine saxifrage, which she well knew by\r\ndescription. She went to gather it, but the turf was slippery, and when\r\nonce descending, she could not stop herself; and what was the horror of\r\nfinding herself half slipping, half running down a slope, which became\r\nsteeper every moment, till it was suddenly broken off into a sheer\r\nprecipice! She screamed, and grasped with both hands at some low bushes,\r\nthat grew under a rock at the side of the treacherous turf. She caught\r\na branch, and found herself supported, by clinging to it with her hands,\r\nwhile she rested on the slope, now so nearly perpendicular, that to lose\r\nher hold would send her instantly down the precipice. Her whole weight\r\nseemed to depend on that slender bough, and those little hands that\r\nclenched it convulsively,--her feet felt in vain for some hold. \xe2\x80\x98Guy!\r\nGuy!\xe2\x80\x99 she shrieked again. Oh, where was he? His whistle ceased,--he\r\nheard her,--he called,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, help me!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. But with that moment\xe2\x80\x99s joy came the horror,\r\nhe could not help her--he would only fall himself. \xe2\x80\x98Take care! don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncome on the grass!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. She must let go the branch in a short,\r\ntime then a slip, the precipice,--and what would become of him? Those\r\nmoments were hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am coming--hold fast!\xe2\x80\x99 She heard his voice above her, very near.\r\nTo find him so close made the agony of dread and of prayer even more\r\nintense. To be lost, with her husband scarcely a step from her! Yet how\r\ncould he stand on the slippery turf, and so as to be steady enough to\r\nraise her up?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, speaking from the rock under which the brushwood\r\ngrew, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot reach you unless you raise up your hand to me--your left\r\nhand--straight up. Let go. Now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful moment. Amabel could not see him, and felt as if\r\nrelinquishing her grasp of the tree was certain destruction. The\r\ninstinct of self-preservation had been making her cling desperately with\r\nthat left hand, especially as it held by the thicker part of the bough.\r\nBut the habit of implicit confidence and obedience was stronger still;\r\nshe did not hesitate, and tightening her hold with the other hand, she\r\nunclasped the left and stretched it upwards.\r\n\r\nJoy unspeakable to feel his fingers close over her wrist, like iron,\r\neven while the bush to which she had trusted was detaching itself,\r\nalmost uprooted by her weight! If she had waited a second she would have\r\nbeen lost, but her confidence had been her safety. A moment or two more,\r\nand with closed eyes she was leaning against him; his arm was round\r\nher, and he guided her steps, till, breathless, she found herself on the\r\nbroad well-trodden path, out of sight of the precipice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank heaven!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a very low voice, as he stood still. \xe2\x80\x98Thank\r\nGod! my Amy, I have you still.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked up and saw how pale he was, though his voice had been so\r\nsteady throughout. She leant on his breast, and rested her head on\r\nhis shoulder again in silence, for her heart was too full of awe and\r\nthankfulness for words, even had she not been without breath or power to\r\nspeak, and needing his support in her giddiness and trembling.\r\n\r\nMore than a minute passed thus. Then, beginning to recover, she looked\r\nup to him again, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, it was dreadful! I did not think you\r\ncould have saved me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so too for a moment!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, in a stifled voice. \xe2\x80\x98You are\r\nbetter now? You are not hurt? are you sure?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite sure! I did not fall, you know, only slipped. No, I have nothing\r\nthe matter with me, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe tried to stand alone, but the trembling returned. He made her sit\r\ndown, and she rested against him, while he still made her assure him\r\nthat she was unhurt. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, quite unhurt--quite well; only this wrist is\r\na little strained, and no wonder. Oh, I am sure it was Providence that\r\nmade those bushes grow just there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did it happen?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was my fault. I went after a flower; my foot slipped on the turf,\r\nand I could not stop myself. I thought I should have run right down the\r\nprecipice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shut her eyes and shuddered again. \xe2\x80\x98It was frightful!\xe2\x80\x99 he said,\r\nholding her fast. \xe2\x80\x98It was a great mercy, indeed. Thank heaven, it is\r\nover! You are not giddy now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; not at all!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And your wrist?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing. I only told you to show you what was the worst,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Amy, smiling with recovered playfulness, the most re-assuring of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What flower was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A piece of purple saxifrage. I thought there was no danger, for it did\r\nnot seem steep at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it was not your fault. You had better not move just yet; sit still\r\na little while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Guy, where are you going?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only for your sketching tools and my stick. I shall not be gone an\r\ninstant. Sit still and recover.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds he came back with her basket, and in it a few of the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, coming to meet him; \xe2\x80\x98I wish I had told you I\r\ndid not care for them. Why did you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not put myself in any peril about them. I had my trusty staff,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad I did not guess what you were doing. I thought it so\r\nimpossible, that I did not think of begging you not. I shall keep them\r\nalways. It is a good thing for us to be put in mind how frail all our\r\njoy is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Guy, scarcely as if replying to her, while, though his arm\r\npressed hers, his eye was on the blue sky, as he answered himself, \xe2\x80\x98Your\r\njoy no man taketh from you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel was much impressed, as she thought what it would have been\r\nfor him if his little wife bad been snatched from him so suddenly and\r\nfrightfully. His return--his meeting her mother--his desolate home and\r\nsolitary life. She could almost have wept for him. Yet, at the moment of\r\nrelief from the fear of such misery, he could thus speak. He could look\r\nonward to the joy beyond, even while his cheek was still blanched with\r\nthe horror and anguish of the apprehension; and how great they had\r\nbeen was shown by the broken words he uttered in his sleep, for several\r\nnights afterwards, while by day he was always watching and cautioning\r\nher. Assuredly his dependence on the joy that could not be lost did not\r\nmake her doubt his tenderness; it only made her feel how far behind him\r\nshe was, for would it have been the same with her, had the danger been\r\nhis?\r\n\r\nIn a couple of days they arrived at the beautiful Lugano, and, as usual,\r\ntheir first walk was to the post-office, but disappointment awaited\r\nthem. There had been some letters addressed to the name of Morville,\r\nbut the Signor Inglese had left orders that such should be forwarded to\r\nComo. Amabel, in her best Italian, strove hard to explain the difference\r\nbetween the captain and Sir Guy, the Cavaliere Guido, as she translated\r\nhim, who stood by looking much amused by the perplexities of his lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconstruing; while the post-master, though very polite and sorry for the\r\nSignora\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment, stuck to the address being Morville, poste\r\nrestante.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is one good thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cavaliere, as they walked away, \xe2\x80\x98we\r\ncan find the captain now. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write and ask him--shall I say to meet us\r\nat Varenna or at Bellagio?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whichever suits him best, I should think. It can\xe2\x80\x99t make much difference\r\nto us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your voice has a disconsolate cadence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking at her with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not mean it,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered; \xe2\x80\x98I have not a word to say against it.\r\nIt is quite right, and I am sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to do otherwise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only it is the first drawback in our real day-dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so, and that is all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98I am glad you feel the same, not\r\nthat I want you to change your mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember our resolution against mere pleasure-hunting? That\r\nadventure at Interlachen seemed to be meant to bring us up short just as\r\nwe were getting into that line.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You think we were?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was, at least; for I know it was a satisfaction not to find a letter,\r\nto say Redclyffe was ready for us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I had rather it was Redclyffe than Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, I would not change my own dancing leaping waves for this\r\nclear blue looking-glass of a lake, or even those white peaks. I want\r\nyou to make friends with those waves, Amy. But it is a more real matter\r\nto make friends with Philip, the one wish of my life. Not that I exactly\r\nexpect to clear matters up, but if some move is not made now, when it\r\nmay, we shall stand aloof for life, and there will be the feud where it\r\nwas before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is quite right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98I dare say that, meeting so far from\r\nhome, he will be glad to see us, and to hear the Hollywell news. I\r\nlittle thought last autumn where I should meet him again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the second evening from that time, Philip Morville was walking, hot\r\nand dusty, between the high stone walls bordering the road, and shutting\r\nout the beautiful view of the lake, at the entrance of Ballagio,\r\nmeditating on the note he had received from Guy, and intending to be\r\nmagnanimous, and overlook former offences for Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s sake. He would\r\nshow that he considered the marriage to have cleared off old scores, and\r\nthat as long as she was happy, poor little thing, her husband should\r\nbe borne with, though not to the extent of the spoiling the Edmonstones\r\ngave him.\r\n\r\nThus reflecting, he entered the town, and walked on in search of the\r\nhotel. He presently found himself on a terrace, looking out on the\r\ndeep blue lake, there divided by the promontory of Bellagio, into two\r\nbranches, the magnificent mountain forms rising opposite to him. A\r\nlittle boat was crossing, and as it neared the landing-place, he saw\r\nthat it contained a gentleman and lady, English--probably his cousins\r\nthemselves. They looked up, and in another moment had waved their\r\nrecognition. Gestures and faces were strangely familiar, like a bit\r\nof Hollywell transplanted into that Italian scene. He hastened to the\r\nlanding-place, and was met by a hearty greeting from Guy, who seemed\r\nfull of eagerness to claim their closer relationship, and ready to be\r\ncongratulated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How d\xe2\x80\x99ye do, Philip? I am glad we have caught you at last. Here she\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf he had wished to annoy Philip, he could hardly have done so more\r\neffectually than by behaving as if nothing was amiss, and disconcerting\r\nhis preparations for a reconciliation. But the captain\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary manner\r\nwas calculated to cover all such feelings; and as he shook hands, he\r\nfelt much kindness for Amabel, as an unconscious victim, whose very\r\nsmiles were melancholy, and plenty of them there were, for she rejoiced\r\nsincerely in the meeting, as Guy was pleased, and a home face was a\r\nwelcome sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have your letters in my knapsack; I will unpack them as soon as we\r\nget to the hotel. I thought it safer not to send them in search of you\r\nagain, as we were to meet so soon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. Are there many?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One for each of you, both from Hollywell. I was very sorry to have\r\nengrossed them; but not knowing you were so near, I only gave my\r\nsurname.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was lucky for us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98otherwise we could not have traced\r\nyou. We saw your name at Altdorf, and have been trying to come up with\r\nyou ever since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad we have met. What accounts have you from home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excellent,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98Charlie is uncommonly well, he has been out of\r\ndoors a great deal, and has even dined out several times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know he has been improving ever since his great illness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would be surprised to see how much better he moves,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98he\r\nhelps himself so much more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can he set his foot to the ground?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98there is no hope of that; but he is more active,\r\nbecause his general health is improved; he can sleep and eat more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I always thought exertion would do more for him than anything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel was vexed, for she thought exertion depended more on health, than\r\nhealth on exertion; besides, she thought Philip ought to take some blame\r\nto himself for the disaster on the stairs. She made no answer, and Guy\r\nasked what Philip had been doing to-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Walking over the hills from Como. Do you always travel in this fashion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cimpedimentis relictis\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98the \xe2\x80\x9cimpedimenta\xe2\x80\x9d are, some at Varenna, some\r\nat the inn with Arnaud.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you have Arnaud with you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, and Anne Trower,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, for her maid was a Stylehurst person,\r\nwho had lived at Hollywell ever since she had been fit for service. \xe2\x80\x98She\r\nwas greatly pleased to hear we were going to meet the captain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We amuse ourselves with thinking how she gets on with Arnaud,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy. \xe2\x80\x98Their introduction took place only two days before we were\r\nmarried, since which, they have had one continued tete-a-tete, which\r\nmust have been droll at first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More so at last,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98At first Anne thought Mr. Arnaud so fine a\r\ngentleman, that she hardly dared to speak to him. I believe nothing\r\nawed her so much as his extreme courtesy; but lately he has been quite\r\nfatherly to her, and took her to dine at his sister\xe2\x80\x99s chalet, where\r\nI would have given something to see her. She tells me he wants her\r\nto admire the country, but she does not like the snow, and misses our\r\nbeautiful clover-fields very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stylehurst ought to have been better training for mountains,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nThey were fast losing the stiffness of first meeting. Philip could not\r\nbut acknowledge to himself that Amy was looking very well, and so happy\r\nthat Guy must be fulfilling the condition on which he was to be borne\r\nwith. However, these were early days, and of course Guy must be kind to\r\nher at least in the honeymoon, before the wear and tear of life began.\r\nThey both looked so young, that having advised them to wait four years,\r\nhe was ready to charge them with youthfulness, if not as a fault, at\r\nleast as a folly; indeed, the state of his own affairs made him inclined\r\nto think it a foible, almost a want of patience, in any one to marry\r\nbefore thirty. It was a conflict of feeling. Guy was so cordial and\r\ngood-humoured, that he could not help being almost gained; but, on the\r\nother hand, he had always thought Guy\xe2\x80\x99s manners eminently agreeable; and\r\nas happiness always made people good-humoured, this was no reason for\r\nrelying on him. Besides, the present ease and openness of manner might\r\nonly result from security.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances combined, more than the captain imagined, in what is\r\npopularly called putting him out. He had always been hitherto on equal\r\nterms with Guy; indeed, had rather the superiority at Hollywell, from\r\nhis age and assumption of character, but here Sir Guy was somebody, the\r\ncaptain nobody, and even the advantage of age was lost, now that Guy was\r\nmarried and head of a family, while Philip was a stray young man and his\r\nguest. Far above such considerations as he thought himself, and\r\ndeeming them only the tokens of the mammon worship of the time, Philip,\r\nnevertheless, did not like to be secondary to one to whom he had always\r\nbeen preferred; and this, and perhaps the being half ashamed of it, made\r\nhim something more approaching to cross than ever before; but now and\r\nthen, the persevering amiability of both would soften him, and restore\r\nhim to his most gracious mood.\r\n\r\nHe gave them their letters when they reached the inn, feeling as if he\r\nhad a better right than they, to one which was in Laura\xe2\x80\x99s writing, and\r\nwhen left in solitary possession of the sitting-room--a very pleasant\r\none, with windows opening on the terrace just above the water--paced up\r\nand down, chafing at his own perplexity of feeling.\r\n\r\nPresently they came back; Guy sat down to continue their joint\r\njournal-like letter to Charles, while Amabel made an orderly arrangement\r\nof their properties, making the most of their few books, and taking out\r\nher work as if she had been at home. Philip looked at the books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you a \xe2\x80\x9cChilde Harold\xe2\x80\x9d here?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I want to look at something\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, we have not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy, you never forget poetry; I dare say you can help me out with those\r\nstanzas about the mists in the valley.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have never read it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember warning me against\r\nByron?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You did not think that was for life! Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, feeling\r\nthis reply inconsistent with his contempt for Guy\xe2\x80\x99s youth, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\napplied to his perversions of human passions, not to his descriptions of\r\nscenery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking up from his letter, \xe2\x80\x98I should be more\r\nunwilling to take a man like that to interpret nature than anything\r\nelse, except Scripture. It is more profane to attempt it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see what you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98More than I do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I never supposed you would take my\r\nadvice \xe2\x80\x9cau pied de la lettre\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x99 he had almost added, \xe2\x80\x98perversely.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have felt my obligations for that caution ever since I have come to\r\nsome knowledge of what Byron was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The fascination of his \xe2\x80\x9cGiaour\xe2\x80\x9d heroes has an evil influence on some\r\nminds,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I think you do well to avoid it. The half truth,\r\nresulting from its being the effect of self-contemplation, makes it more\r\ndangerous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, though he little knew how much he owed to having\r\nattended to that caution, for who could have told where the mastery\r\nmight have been in the period of fearful conflict with his passions, if\r\nhe had been feeding his imagination with the contemplation of revenge,\r\ndark hatred, and malice, and identifying himself with Byron\xe2\x80\x99s brooding\r\nand lowering heroes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Philip, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot see why you should shun the fine\r\ndescriptions which are almost classical--the Bridge of Sighs, the\r\nGladiator.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He may describe the gladiator as much as he pleases,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98indeed\r\nthere is something noble in that indignant line--\r\n\r\n\r\n         Butchered to make a Roman holiday;\r\n\r\n\r\nbut that is not like his meddling with these mountains or the sea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fine description is the point in both. You are over-drawing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My notion is this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,--\xe2\x80\x98there is danger in listening to a\r\nman who is sure to misunderstand the voice of nature,--danger, lest by\r\nfilling our ears with the wrong voice we should close them to the true\r\none. I should think there was a great chance of being led to stop\r\nshort at the material beauty, or worse, to link human passions with the\r\nglories of nature, and so distort, defile, profane them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have never read the poem, so you cannot judge,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\r\nthinking this extremely fanciful and ultra-fastidious. \xe2\x80\x98Your rule would\r\nexclude all descriptive poetry, unless it was written by angels, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; by men with minds in the right direction.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very little you would leave us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98Almost all the poetry we really care\r\nabout was written by such men.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shakspeare, for instance?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one can doubt of the bent of his mind from the whole strain of his\r\nwritings,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98So again with Spenser; and as to Milton, though\r\nhis religion was not quite the right sort, no one can pretend to say he\r\nhad it not. Wordsworth, Scott--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Scott?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Including the descriptions of scenery in his novels,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98where,\r\nI am sure, there is the spirit and the beauty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or rather, the spirit is the beauty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is a good deal in what you say,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Philip, who would not\r\nlay himself open to the accusation of being uncandid, \xe2\x80\x98but you will\r\nforgive me for thinking it rather too deep an explanation of the grounds\r\nof not making Childe Harold a hand-book for Italy, like other people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel thought this so dogged and provoking, that she was out of\r\npatience; but Guy only laughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Rather so, considering that\r\nthe fact was that we never thought of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were times when, as Philip had once said, good temper annoyed him\r\nmore than anything, and perhaps he was unconsciously disappointed at\r\nhaving lost his old power of fretting and irritating Guy, and watching\r\nhim champ the bit, so as to justify his own opinion of him. Every\r\nproceeding of his cousins seemed to give him annoyance, more especially\r\ntheir being at home together, and Guy\xe2\x80\x99s seeming to belong more to\r\nHollywell than himself. He sat by, with a book, and watched them, as Guy\r\nasked for Laura\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and Amy came to look over his half-finished\r\nanswer, laughing over it, and giving her commands and messages, looking\r\nso full of playfulness and happiness, as she stood with one hand on the\r\nback of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and the other holding the letter, and Guy\r\nwatching her amused face, and answering her remarks with lively words\r\nand bright smiles. \xe2\x80\x98People who looked no deeper than the surface would,\r\nsay, what a well-matched pair,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Philip; \xe2\x80\x98and no doubt they were\r\nvery happy, poor young things, if it would but last.\xe2\x80\x99 Here Guy turned,\r\nand asked him a question about the line of perpetual snow, so much in\r\nhis own style, that he was almost ready to accuse them of laughing at\r\nhim. Next came what hurt him most of all, as they talked over Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, and a few words passed about Laura, and the admiration of some\r\nperson she had met at Allonby. The whole world was welcome to admire\r\nher: nothing could injure his hold on her heart, and no joke of Charles\r\ncould shake his confidence; but it was hard that he should be forced to\r\nhear such things, and ask no questions, for they evidently thought him\r\noccupied with his book, and did not intend him to listen. The next thing\r\nthey said, however, obliged him to show that he was attending, for it\r\nwas about her being better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who? Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a tone that, in spite of himself, had a\r\nstartled sound. \xe2\x80\x98You did not say she had been ill?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, she has not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Dr. Mayerne said there was nothing really\r\nthe matter: but she has been worried and out of spirits lately; and\r\nmamma thought it would be good for her to go out more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip would not let himself sigh, in spite of the oppressing\r\nconsciousness of having brought the cloud over her, and of his own\r\ninability to do aught but leave her to endure it in silence and\r\npatience. Alas! for how long! Obliged, meanwhile, to see these young\r\ncreatures, placed, by the mere factitious circumstance of wealth, in\r\npossession of happiness which they had not had time either to earn or to\r\nappreciate. He thought it shallow, because of their mirth and gaiety, as\r\nif they were only seeking food for laughter, finding it in mistakes, for\r\nwhich he was ready to despise them.\r\n\r\nArnaud had brought rather antiquated notions to the renewal of his\r\noffice as a courier: his mind had hardly opened to railroads and\r\nsteamers, and changes had come over hotels since his time. Guy and\r\nAmabel, both young and healthy, caring little about bad dinners, and\r\nunwilling to tease the old man by complaints, or alterations of his\r\narrangements, had troubled themselves little about the matter; took\r\nthings as they found them, ate dry bread when the cookery was bad,\r\nwalked if the road was \xe2\x80\x98shocking\xe2\x80\x99; went away the sooner, if the inns\r\nwere \xe2\x80\x98intolerable\xe2\x80\x99; made merry over every inconvenience, and turned\r\nit into an excellent story for Charles. They did not even distress\r\nthemselves about sights which they had missed seeing.\r\n\r\nPhilip thought all this very foolish and absurd, showing that they were\r\nunfit to take care of themselves, and that Guy was neglectful of his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s comforts: in short, establishing his original opinion of their\r\nyouth and folly.\r\n\r\nSo passed the first evening; perhaps the worst because, besides what he\r\nhad heard about Laura, he had been somewhat over-fatigued by various hot\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 walks.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that next morning he was not nearly so much inclined\r\nto be displeased with them for laughing, when, in speaking to Anne, he\r\ninadvertently called her mistress Miss Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, as Anne departed--and he looked disconcerted, as\r\na precise man always does when catching himself in a mistake--\xe2\x80\x98Anne is\r\nused to it, Guy is always doing it, and puzzles poor Arnaud sorely by\r\nsending him for Miss Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s parasol.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the other day,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98when Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s brother, at Munich,\r\ninquired after Lady Morville, I had to consider who she was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! you saw Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s brother, did you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; he was very obliging. Guy had to go to him about our passports:\r\nand when he found who we were, he brought his wife to call on us, and\r\nasked us to an evening party.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you go?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy thought we must, and it was very entertaining. We had a curious\r\nadventure there. In the morning, we had been looking at those\r\nbeautiful windows of the great church, when I turned round, and saw a\r\ngentleman--an Englishman--gazing with all his might at Guy. We met again\r\nin the evening, and presently Mr. Thorndale came and told us it was Mr.\r\nShene.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shene, the painter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. He had been very much struck with Guy\xe2\x80\x99s face: it was exactly what\r\nhe wanted for a picture he was about, and he wished of all things just\r\nto be allowed to make a sketch.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you submit?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98and we were rewarded. I never saw a more agreeable\r\nperson, or one who gave so entirely the impression of genius. The next\r\nday he took us through the gallery, and showed us all that was worth\r\nadmiring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And in what character is he to make you appear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the strange part of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how\r\nGuy once puzzled us by choosing Sir Galahad for his favourite hero? It\r\nis that very Sir Galahad, when he kneels to adore the Saint Greal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Shene said he had long been dreaming over it, and at last, as he\r\nsaw Guy\xe2\x80\x99s face looking upwards, it struck him that it was just what he\r\nwanted: it would be worth anything to him to catch the expression.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder what I was looking like!\xe2\x80\x99 ejaculated Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he take you as yourself, or as Sir Galahad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As myself, happily.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did he succeed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy likes it; but decidedly I should never have known myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said his wife--\r\n\r\n\r\n         \xe2\x80\x98Could some fay the giftie gie us,\r\n         To see ourselves as others see us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As far as the sun-burnt visage is concerned, the glass does that every\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t look at yourself exactly as you do at a painted\r\nwindow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in her demure way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot think how you found time for sitting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, it is quite a little thing, a mere sketch, done in two evenings and\r\nhalf an hour in the morning. He promises it to me when he has done with\r\nSir Galahad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Two--three evenings. You must have been a long time at Munich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A fortnight,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98there is a great deal to see there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip did not quite understand this, nor did he think it very\r\nsatisfactory that they should thus have lingered in a gay town, but he\r\nmeant to make the best of them to-day, and returned to his usual fashion\r\nof patronizing and laying down the law. They were so used to this that\r\nthey did not care about it; indeed, they had reckoned on it as the most\r\namiable conduct to be expected on his part.\r\n\r\nThe day was chiefly spent in an excursion on the lake, landing at the\r\nmost beautiful spots, walking a little way and admiring, or while in the\r\nboat, smoothly moving over the deep blue waters, gaining lovely views of\r\nthe banks, and talking over the book with which their acquaintance had\r\nbegun, \xe2\x80\x9cI Promessi Sposi\xe2\x80\x9d. Never did tourists spend a more serene and\r\npleasant day.\r\n\r\nOn comparing notes as to their plans, it appeared that each party had\r\nabout a week or ten days to spare; the captain before he must embark for\r\nCorfu, and Sir Guy and Lady Morville before the time they had fixed\r\nfor returning home. Guy proposed to go together somewhere, spare the\r\npost-office further blunders, and get the Signor Capitano to be their\r\ninterpreter. Philip thought it would be an excellent thing for his young\r\ncousins for him to take charge of them, and show them how people ought\r\nto travel; so out came his little pocket map, marked with his route,\r\nbefore he left Ireland, whereas they seemed to have no fixed object,\r\nbut to be always going \xe2\x80\x98somewhere.\xe2\x80\x99 It appeared that they had thought of\r\nVenice, but were easily diverted from it by his design of coasting the\r\neastern bank of the Lago di Como, and so across the Stelvio into the\r\nTyrol, all together as far as Botzen, whence Philip would turn southward\r\nby the mountain paths, while they would proceed to Innsbruck on their\r\nreturn home.\r\n\r\nAmabel was especially pleased to stay a little longer on the banks of\r\nthe lake, and to trace out more of Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s haunts; and if she secretly\r\nthought it would have been pleasanter without a third person, she was\r\ngratified to see how much Guy\xe2\x80\x99s manner had softened Philip\xe2\x80\x99s injustice\r\nand distrust, making everything so smooth and satisfactory, that at the\r\nend of the day, she told her husband that she thought his experiment had\r\nnot failed.\r\n\r\nShe was making the breakfast the next morning, when the captain came\r\ninto the room, and she told him Guy was gone to settle their plans with\r\nArnaud. After lingering a little by the window, Philip turned, and with\r\nmore abruptness than was usual with him, said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any cause of anxiety about Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; certainly not!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, surprised. \xe2\x80\x98She has not been looking well\r\nlately, but Dr. Mayerne says it is nothing, and you know\xe2\x80\x99--she blushed\r\nand looked down--\xe2\x80\x98there were many things to make this a trying time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is she quite strong? Can she do as much as usual?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She does more than ever: mamma is only afraid of her overworking\r\nherself, but she never allows that she is tired. She goes to school\r\nthree days in the week, besides walking to East-hill on Thursday, to\r\nhelp in the singing; and she is getting dreadfully learned. Guy gave her\r\nhis old mathematical books, and Charlie always calls her Miss Parabola.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was silent, knowing too well why she sought to stifle care in\r\nemployment; and feeling embittered against the whole world, against her\r\nfather, against his own circumstances, against the happiness of others;\r\nnay, perhaps, against the Providence which had made him what he was.\r\n\r\nPresently Guy came in, and the first thing he said was, \xe2\x80\x98I am afraid we\r\nmust give up our plan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed both Philip and Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have just heard that there is a fever at Sondrio, and all that\r\nneighbourhood, and every one says it would be very foolish to expose\r\nourselves to it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What shall we do instead?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I told Arnaud we would let him know in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time; I thought of\r\nVenice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Venice, oh, yes, delightful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you say, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I say that I cannot see any occasion for our being frightened out of\r\nour original determination. If a fever prevails among the half-starved\r\npeasantry, it need not affect well-fed healthy persons, merely passing\r\nthrough the country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You see we could hardly manage without sleeping there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy: \xe2\x80\x98we\r\nmust sleep either at Colico, or at Madonna. Now Colico, they say, is a\r\nmost unhealthy place at this time of year, and Madonna is the very\r\nheart of the fever--Sondrio not much better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it is to\r\nbe safely done; and though very likely we might not catch the fever, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see any use in trying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is making yourself a slave to the fear of infection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what purpose would be answered by running the risk,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you chose to give it so dignified a name as a risk,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98I should not care if there was\r\nany reason for going there, but, as there is not, I shall face Mr.\r\nEdmonstone better if I don\xe2\x80\x99t run Amy into any more chances of mischief.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Amy grateful for the care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98after all her wishes for\r\nthe eastern bank?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy is a good wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98For Venice, then. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for Arnaud.\r\nYou will come with us, won\xe2\x80\x99t you, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I thank you; I always intended to see the Valtelline, and an\r\nepidemic among the peasantry does not seem to me to be sufficient to\r\ndeter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Philip, you surely will not?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My mind is made up, Amy, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would be persuaded,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I should like particularly\r\nto have you to lionize us there; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy your running into\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe argument lasted long. Philip by no means approved of Venice,\r\nespecially after the long loitering at Munich, thinking that in both\r\nplaces there was danger of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s being led into mischief by his musical\r\nconnections. Therefore he did his best, for Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to turn them\r\nfrom their purpose, persuaded in his own mind that the fever was a\r\nmere bugbear, raised up by Arnaud; and, perhaps, in his full health\r\nand strength, almost regarding illness itself as a foible, far more\r\nthe dread of it. He argued, therefore, in his most provoking strain,\r\nbecoming more vexatious as the former annoyance was revived at\r\nfinding the impossibility of making Guy swerve from his purpose, while\r\nadditional mists of suspicion arose before him, making him imagine that\r\nthe whole objection was caused by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s dislike to submit to him, and\r\na fit of impatience of which Amy was the victim; nay, that his cousin\r\nwanted to escape from his surveillance, and follow the beat of his\r\ninclinations; and the whole heap of prejudices and half-refuted\r\naccusations resumed their full ascendancy. Never had his manner been\r\nmore vexatious, though without departing from the coolness which always\r\ncharacterized it; but all the time, Guy, while firm and unmoved in\r\npurpose, kept his temper perfectly, and apparently without effort. Even\r\nAmabel glowed with indignation, at the assumption with which he was\r\nstriving to put her husband down, though she rejoiced to see its entire\r\nfailure: for some sensible argument, or some gay, lively, good-humoured\r\nreply, was the utmost he could elicit. Guy did not seem to be in the\r\nleast irritated or ruffled by the very behaviour which used to cause him\r\nso many struggles. Having once seriously said that he did not think it\r\nright to run into danger, without adequate cause, he held his position\r\nwith so much ease, that he could afford to be playful, and laugh at his\r\nown dread of infection, his changeableness, and credulity. Never had\r\ntemper been more entirely subdued; for surely if he could bear this, he\r\nneed never fear himself again.\r\n\r\nSo passed the hour; and Amabel was heartily glad when the debate was\r\nclosed by Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s coming for orders. Guy went with him; Amabel began to\r\ncollect her goods; and Philip, after a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 reflection, spoke in\r\nthe half-compassionate, half-patronizing manner with which he used, now\r\nand then, to let fall a few crumbs of counsel or commendation for silly\r\nlittle Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Amy, you yielded very amiably, and that is the only way. You will\r\nalways find it best to submit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe got no further in his intended warning against the dissipations of\r\nVenice, for her eyes were fixed on him at first with a look of extreme\r\nwonder. Then her face assumed an expression of dignity, and gently, but\r\ngravely, she said, \xe2\x80\x98I think you forget to whom you are speaking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe gentlemanlike instinct made him reply, \xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon\xe2\x80\x99--and\r\nthere he stopped, as much taken by surprise as if a dove had flown in\r\nhis face. He actually was confused; for in very truth, he had, after a\r\nfashion, forgotten that she was Lady Morville, not the cousin Amy with\r\nwhom Guy\xe2\x80\x99s character might be freely discussed. He had often presumed as\r\nfar with his aunt; but she, though always turning the conversation, had\r\nnever given him a rebuff. Amabel had not done; and in her soft voice,\r\nfirmly, though not angrily, she spoke on. \xe2\x80\x98One thing I wish to say,\r\nbecause we shall never speak on this subject again, and I was always\r\nafraid of you before. You have always misunderstood him, I might almost\r\nsay, chosen to misunderstand him. You have tried his temper more than\r\nany one, and never appreciated the struggles that have subdued it. It\r\nis not because I am his wife that I say this--indeed I am not sure it\r\nbecomes me to say it; yet I cannot bear that you should not be told of\r\nit, because you think he acts out of enmity to you. You little know\r\nhow your friendship has been his first desire--how he has striven for\r\nit--how, after all you have done and written, he defended you with\r\nall his might when those at home were angry--how he sought you out on\r\npurpose to try to be real cordial friends\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s face had grown rigid, and chiefly at the words, \xe2\x80\x98those at home\r\nwere angry.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is not I that prevent that friendship,\xe2\x80\x99 said he: \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nhis own want of openness. My opinion has never changed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I know it has never changed\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in a tone of sorrowful\r\ndispleasure. \xe2\x80\x98Whenever it does, you will be sorry you have judged him so\r\nharshly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe left the room, and Philip held her in higher esteem. He saw there\r\nwas spirit and substance beneath that soft girlish exterior, and hoped\r\nshe would better be able to endure the troubles which her precipitate\r\nmarriage was likely to cause her; but as to her husband, his\r\ncombined fickleness and obstinacy had only become more apparent than\r\never--fickleness in forsaking his purpose, obstinacy in adherence to his\r\nown will.\r\n\r\nDispleased and contemptuous, Philip was not softened by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s freedom\r\nand openness of manner and desire to help him as far as their roads lay\r\ntogether. He was gracious only to Lady Morville, whom he treated with\r\nkindness, intended to show that he was pleased with her for a reproof\r\nwhich became her position well, though it could not hurt him. Perhaps\r\nshe thought this amiability especially insufferable: for when she\r\narrived at Varenna her chief thought was that here they should be free\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, at that last moment, \xe2\x80\x98I wish you would think\r\nbetter of it after all, and come with us to Milan.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, my mind is made up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t catch the fever: for I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the trouble of\r\nnursing you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; I hope to require no such services of my friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPhilip, with a proud stem air, implying, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. Then remembering his promise to Laura, he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98I wish we could have seen more of you. They will be glad to hear\r\nof you at Hollywell. You have had one warm friend there all along.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was touched for a moment by this kind speech, and his tone was less\r\ngrave and dignified. \xe2\x80\x98Remember me to them when you write,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and tell Laura she must not wear herself out with her studies.\r\nGood-bye, Amy, I hope you will have a pleasant journey.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe farewells were exchanged and the carriage drove off. \xe2\x80\x98Poor little\r\nAmy!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip to himself, \xe2\x80\x98how she is improved. He has a sweet\r\nlittle wife in her. The fates have conspired to crown him with all man\r\ncan desire, and little marvel if he should abuse his advantages. Poor\r\nlittle Amy! I have less hope than ever, since even her evident wishes\r\ncould not bend his determination in this trifle; but she is a good\r\nlittle creature, happy in her blindness. May it long continue! It is my\r\nuncle and aunt who are to be blamed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe set himself to ascend the mountain path, and they looked back,\r\nwatching the firm vigorous steps with which he climbed the hill side,\r\nthen stood to wave his hand to Amabel looking a perfect specimen of\r\nhealth and activity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just like himself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, drawing so long a breath that Guy smiled,\r\nbut did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you much vexed?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I had made the most of my opportunities.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then if you have not, I can tell you who has. What do you think of his\r\nbeginning to give me a lecture how to behave to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he think you wanted it very much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know: for of course I could not let him go on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was so much diverted at the idea of her wanting a lecture\r\non wife-like deportment, that he had no time to be angry at the\r\nimpertinence, and he made her laugh also by his view that was all force\r\nof habit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Guido--good Cavaliere Guido--do grant me one satisfaction,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe, coaxingly. \xe2\x80\x98Only say you are very glad he is gone his own way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I am sorry he is running his head into a fever,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nGuy, pretending to be provoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to be glad of that, I only want you to be glad he is\r\nnot sitting here towering over us.\xe2\x80\x99 Guy smiled, and began to whistle--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x98Cock up your beaver, and cock it fu\xe2\x80\x99 sprush!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 31\r\n\r\n     And turned the thistles of a curse\r\n     To types beneficent.\r\n                          --WORDSWORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about three weeks after the rendezvous at Bellagio, that Sir Guy\r\nand Lady Morville arrived at Vicenza, on their way from Venice. They\r\nwere in the midst of breakfast when Arnaud entered, saying,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was well, Sir Guy, that you changed your intention of visiting the\r\nValtelline with Captain Morville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What! Have you heard anything of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I fear that his temerity has caused him to suffer. I have just heard\r\nthat an Englishman of your name is severely ill at Recoara.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At \xe2\x80\x9cla badia di Recoara\xe2\x80\x9d. It is what in English we call a\r\nwatering-place, on the mountains to the north, where the Vicentini do\r\ngo in summer for \xe2\x80\x9cfraicheur\xe2\x80\x9d, but they have all returned in the last two\r\ndays for fear of the infection.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and make inquiries\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, rising in haste. Returning in a\r\nquarter of an hour, he said,--\xe2\x80\x98It is true. It can be no other than poor\r\nPhilip. I have seen his doctor, an Italian, who, when he saw our name\r\nwritten, said it was the same. He calls it \xe2\x80\x9cuna febbre molto grave\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very heavy! Did he only know the name in writing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only from seeing it on his passport. He has been unable to give any\r\ndirections.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dreadfully ill he must be! And alone! What shall we do? You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of leaving me behind you, whatever you do?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amabel,\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is at no great distance, and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. Only take me with you. I will try to bear it, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think it right; but it will be very hard.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer eyes were full of tears, but she struggled to repress them, and was\r\nsilent in suspense as she saw him considering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My poor Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, presently; \xe2\x80\x98I believe the anxiety would be worse\r\nfor you if I were to leave you here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will have nothing to do with the nursing. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\r\nis much risk; so we will go together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you! thank you! and perhaps I may be of some use. But is it very\r\ninfectious?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not: caught at Colico, and imported to a fresh place. I should\r\nthink there was little fear of its spreading. However, we must soon\r\nbe off: I am afraid he is very ill, and almost deserted. In the first\r\nplace, I had better send an express to the Consul at Venice, to ask him\r\nto recommend us a doctor, for I have not much faith in this Italian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were soon on the way to Recoara, a road bordered on one side by\r\nhigh rocks, on the other by a little river flowing down a valley, shut\r\nin by mountains. The valley gradually contracted in the ascent, till\r\nit became a ravine, and further on a mere crevice marked by the thick\r\ngrowth of the chestnut-trees; but before this greater narrowing, they\r\nsaw the roofs of the houses in the little town. The sun shone clear, the\r\nair had grown fresh as they mounted higher; Amabel could hardly imagine\r\nsickness and sorrow in so fair a spot, and turned to her husband to say\r\nso, but he was deep in thought, and she would not disturb him.\r\n\r\nThe town was built on the bank of the stream, and very much shut in by\r\nthe steep crags, which seemed almost to overhang the inn, to which they\r\ndrove, auguring favourably of the place from its fresh, clean aspect.\r\n\r\nGuy hastened to the patient; while Amabel was conducted to a room with\r\na polished floor, and very little furniture, and there waited anxiously\r\nuntil he returned. There was a flush on his face, and almost before he\r\nspoke, he leant far out of the window to try to catch a breath of air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must find another room for him directly,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98He cannot\r\npossibly exist where he is--a little den--such an atmosphere of\r\nfever--enough to knock one down! Will you have one got ready for him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Directly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, ringing. \xe2\x80\x98How is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is in a stupor; it is not sleep. He is frightfully ill, I never felt\r\nanything like the heat of his skin. But that stifling hole would account\r\nfor much; very likely he may revive, when we get him into a better\r\natmosphere. No one has attended to him properly. It is a terrible thing\r\nto be ill in a foreign country without a friend!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nArnaud came, and Amabel sent for the hostess, while Guy returned to his\r\ncharge. Little care had been taken for the solitary traveller on foot,\r\ntoo ill to exact attention, and whose presence drove away custom; but\r\nwhen his case was taken up by a Milord Inglese, the people of the inn\r\nwere ready to do their utmost to cause their neglect to be forgotten,\r\nand everything was at the disposal of the Signora. The rooms were many,\r\nbut very small, and the best she could contrive was to choose three\r\nrooms on the lower floor, rather larger than the rest, and opening into\r\neach other, as well as into the passage, so that it was possible to\r\nproduce a thorough draught. Under her superintendence, Anne made the\r\napartment look comfortable, and almost English, and sending word that\r\nall was ready, she proceeded to establish herself in the corresponding\r\nrooms on the floor above.\r\n\r\nPhilip was perfectly unconscious when he was carried to his new room.\r\nHis illness had continued about a week, and had been aggravated first by\r\nhis incredulous and determined resistance of it, and then by the neglect\r\nwith which he had been treated. It was fearful to see how his great\r\nstrength had been cut down, as there he lay with scarcely a sign of\r\nlife, except his gasping, labouring breath. Guy stood over him, let the\r\nair blow in from the open window, sprinkled his face with vinegar, and\r\nmoistened his lips, longing for the physician, for whom, however,\r\nhe knew he must wait many hours. Perplexed, ignorant of the proper\r\ntreatment, fearing to do harm, and extremely anxious, he still was\r\nalmost rejoiced: for there was no one to whom he was so glad to do a\r\nservice, and a hope arose of full reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe patient was somewhat revived by the fresh air, he breathed more\r\nfreely, moved, and made a murmuring sound, as if striving painfully for\r\na word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cDa bere\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x99 at last he said; and if Guy had not known its meaning, it\r\nwould have been plain from the gasping, parched manner in which it was\r\nuttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some water?\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, holding it to his lips, and on hearing the\r\nEnglish, Philip opened his eyes, and, as he drank, gazed with a heavy\r\nsort of wonder. \xe2\x80\x98Is that enough? Do you like some on your forehead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that more comfortable? We only heard to-day you were ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned away restlessly, as if hardly glad to see Guy, and not awake\r\nto the circumstances, in a dull, feverish oppression of the senses.\r\nDelirium soon came on, or, more properly, delusion. He was distressed by\r\nthinking himself deserted, and struggling to speak Italian, and when Guy\r\nreplied in English, though the native tongue seemed to fall kindly on\r\nhis ear, yet, to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s great grief, the old dislike appeared to prevent\r\nall comfort in his presence, though he could not repel his attentions.\r\nAt night the wandering increased, till it became unintelligible raving,\r\nand strength was required to keep him in bed.\r\n\r\nAmabel seldom saw her husband this evening. He once came up to see her,\r\nwhen she made him drink some coffee, but he soon went, telling her he\r\nshould wait up, and begging her to go to rest quietly, as she looked\r\npale and tired. The night was a terrible one, and morning only brought\r\ninsensibility. The physician arrived, a sharp-looking Frenchman, who\r\npronounced it to be a very severe and dangerous case, more violent than\r\nusual in malaria fever, and with more affection of the brain. Guy was\r\nglad to be set to do something, instead of standing by in inaction; but\r\nice and blisters were applied without effect, and they were told that it\r\nwas likely to be long before the fever abated.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed without improvement, and with few gleams of\r\nconsciousness, and even these were not free from wandering; they were\r\nonly intervals in the violent ravings, or the incoherent murmurs, and\r\nwere never clear from some torturing fancy that he was alone and ill at\r\nBroadstone, and neither the Edmonstones nor his brother-officers would\r\ncome to him, or else that he was detained from Stylehurst. \xe2\x80\x98Home\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwas the word oftenest on his lips. \xe2\x80\x98I would not go home,\xe2\x80\x99 the only\r\nexpression that could sometimes be distinctly heard. He was obliged to\r\ndepend on Guy as the only Englishman at hand; but whenever he recognized\r\nhim, the traces of repugnance were evident, and in his clearer\r\nintervals, he always showed a preference for Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s attendance. Still\r\nGuy persevered indefatigably, sitting up with him every night, and\r\nshowing himself an invaluable nurse, with his tender hand, modulated\r\nvoice, quick eye, and quiet activity. His whole soul was engrossed: he\r\nnever appeared to think of himself, or to be sensible of fatigue; but\r\nwas only absorbed in the one thought of his patient\xe2\x80\x99s comfort! He seldom\r\ncame to Amabel except at meals, and now and then for a short visit to\r\nher sitting-room to report on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s condition. If he could spare a\r\nlittle more time when Philip was in a state of stupor, she used to try\r\nto persuade him to take some rest; and if it was late, or in the heat\r\nof noon, she could sometimes get him, as a favour to her, to lie down\r\non the sofa, and let her read to him; but it did not often end in\r\nsleep, and he usually preferred taking her out into the fresh air, and\r\nwandering about among the chestnut-trees and green hillocks higher up in\r\nthe ravine.\r\n\r\nVery precious were these walks, with the quiet grave talk that the scene\r\nand the circumstances inspired--when he would tell the thoughts that had\r\noccupied him in his night-watches, and they shared the subdued and\r\ndeep reflection suited to this period of apprehension. These were her\r\nhappiest times, but they were few and uncertain. She had in the meantime\r\nto wait, to watch, and hope alone, though she had plenty of employment;\r\nfor besides writing constant bulletins, all preparations for the\r\nsickroom fell to her share. She had to send for or devise substitutes\r\nfor all the conveniences that were far from coming readily to hand in a\r\nremote Italian inn--to give orders, send commissions to Vicenza, or even\r\nto Venice, and to do a good deal, with Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 assistance, by her own\r\nmanual labour. Guy said she did more for Philip outside his room than\r\nhe did inside, and often declared how entirely at a loss he should have\r\nbeen if she had not been there, with her ready resources, and, above\r\nall, with her sweet presence, making the short intervals he spent out of\r\nthe sick chamber so much more than repose, such refreshment at the time,\r\nand in remembrance.\r\n\r\nThus it had continued for more than a fortnight, when one evening as the\r\nFrench physician was departing, he told Guy that he would not fail to\r\ncome the next night, as he saw every reason to expect a crisis. Guy sat\r\nintently marking every alteration in the worn, flushed, suffering face\r\nthat rested helplessly on the pillows, and every unconscious movement\r\nof the wasted, nerveless limbs stretched out in pain and helplessness,\r\ncontrasting his present state with what he was when last they parted,\r\nin the full pride of health, vigour, and intellect. He dwelt on all that\r\nhad passed between them from the first, the strange ancestral enmity\r\nthat nothing had as yet overcome, the misunderstandings, the prejudices,\r\nthe character whose faultlessness he had always revered, and the\r\nrepeated failure of all attempts to be friends, as if his own impatience\r\nand passion had borne fruit in the merited distrust of the man whom of\r\nall others he respected, and whom he would fain love as a brother. He\r\nearnestly hoped that so valuable a life might be spared; but if that\r\nmight not be, his fervent wish was, that at least a few parting words\r\nof goodwill and reconciliation might be granted to be his comfort in\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nSo mused Guy during the night, as he watched the heavy doze between\r\nsleep and stupor, and tried to catch the low, indistinct mutterings that\r\nnow and then seemed to ask for something. Towards morning Philip awoke\r\nmore fully, and as Guy was feeling his pulse, he faintly asked,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many?\xe2\x80\x99 while his eyes had more of their usual expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot count,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but it is less than in the evening.\r\nSome drink?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip took some, then making an effort to look round, said,--\xe2\x80\x98What day\r\nis it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Saturday morning, the 23rd of August.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been ill a long time!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have indeed, full three weeks; but you are better to-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was silent for some moments; then, collecting himself, and\r\nlooking fixedly at Guy, he said, in his own steady voice, though very\r\nfeeble,--\xe2\x80\x98I suppose, humanly speaking, it is an even chance between life\r\nand death?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, firmly, the low sweet tones of his voice full of\r\ntenderness. \xe2\x80\x98You are very ill; but not without hope.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, after a\r\npause, during which Philip looked thoughtful, but calm, he added,--\xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave tried to bring a clergyman here, but I could not succeed. Would you\r\nlike me to read to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you-presently--but I have something to say. Some more\r\nwater;--thank you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, after pausing, \xe2\x80\x98Guy, you have thought I judged\r\nyou harshly; I meant to act for the best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t think of that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, with a rush of joy at hearing the words\r\nof reconciliation he had yearned for so long.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now you have been most kind. If I live, you shall see that I am\r\nsensible of it;\xe2\x80\x99 and he feebly moved his hand to his cousin, who pressed\r\nit, hardly less happy than on the day he stood before Mrs. Edmonstone in\r\nthe dressing-room. Presently, Philip went on. \xe2\x80\x98My sister has my will. My\r\nlove to her, and to--to--to poor Laura.\xe2\x80\x99 His voice suddenly failed;\r\nand while Guy was again moistening his lips, he gathered strength, and\r\nsaid,--\xe2\x80\x98You and Amy will do what you can for her. Do not let the blow\r\ncome suddenly. Ah! you do not know. We have been engaged this long\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy did not exclaim, but Philip saw his amazement. \xe2\x80\x98It was very wrong;\r\nit was not her fault,\xe2\x80\x99 he added. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you now; but if I live\r\nall shall be told. If not, you will be kind to her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed we will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 again said Philip, in a much weaker voice, and after lying\r\nstill a little longer, he faintly whispered,--\xe2\x80\x98Read to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy read till he fell into a doze, which lasted till Arnaud came in the\r\nmorning, and Guy went up to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, entering with a quiet bright look, \xe2\x80\x98he has spoken to me\r\naccording to my wish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then it is all right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, answering his look with one as calm\r\nand sweet. \xe2\x80\x98Is he better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not materially; his pulse is still very high; but there was a gleam of\r\nperfect consciousness; he spoke calmly and clearly, fully understanding\r\nhis situation. Come what will, it is a thing to be infinitely thankful\r\nfor! I am very glad! Now for our morning reading.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was over, and when Guy had satisfied himself that the\r\npatient was still quiet, they sat down to breakfast. Guy considered a\r\nlittle while, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been very much surprised. Had you any idea of an attachment\r\nbetween him and Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know she is very fond of him, and she has always been his favourite.\r\nWhat? Has he been in love with her all this time, poor fellow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He says they are engaged.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura? Our sister! Oh, Guy, impossible! He must have been wandering.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could have almost thought so; but his whole manner forbade me to\r\nthink there was any delusion. He was too weak to explain; but he said it\r\nwas not her fault, and was overcome when speaking of her. He begged\r\nus to spare her from suddenly hearing of his death. He was as calm and\r\nreasonable as I am at this moment. No, Amy, it was not delirium.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to believe it!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98It is so impossible for\r\nLaura, and for him too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know how, sometimes in fevers, people\r\ntake a delusion, and are quite rational about everything else, and that,\r\ntoo; if only it was true; and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it very likely, that if he\r\nreally has been in love with her all this time, (how much he must have\r\ngone through!) he may fancy he has been secretly engaged, and reproach\r\nhimself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98there was a reality in his manner of\r\nspeaking that refuses to let me disbelieve him. Surely it cannot be one\r\nof the horrors of death that we should be left to reproach ourselves\r\nwith the fancied sins we have been prone to, as well as with our real\r\nones. Then\xe2\x80\x99--and he rose, and walked about the room--\xe2\x80\x98if so, more than\r\never, in the hour of death, good Lord, deliver us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel was silent, and presently he sat down, saying,--\xe2\x80\x98Well, time will\r\nshow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot think it\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Laura! How could she help telling mamma!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd as Guy smiled at the recollection of their own simultaneous coming\r\nto mamma, she added,--\xe2\x80\x98Not only because it was right, but for the\r\ncomfort of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Amy, do you remember what I told you of poor Laura\xe2\x80\x99s fears, and\r\nwhat she said to me, on our wedding-day?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Yet--\xe2\x80\x99 She paused, and Guy presently said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, if I can possibly help it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to\r\nlose my faith in my sister\xe2\x80\x99s perfection, or Philip\xe2\x80\x99s, especially now.\r\nBut I must go; I have loitered too long, and Arnaud ought to go to his\r\nbreakfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel sat long over the remains of her breakfast. She did not puzzle\r\nherself over Philip\xe2\x80\x99s confession, for she would not admit it without\r\nconfirmation; and she could not think of his misdoings, even those\r\nof which she was certain, on the day when his life was hanging in the\r\nbalance. All she could bear to recollect was his excellence; nay, in the\r\ntenderness of her heart, she nearly made out that she had always been\r\nvery fond of him, overlooking that even before Guy came to Hollywell,\r\nshe had always regarded him with more awe than liking, been disinclined\r\nto his good advice, shrunk from his condescension, and regularly enjoyed\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s quizzing of him. All this, and all the subsequent injuries\r\nwere forgotten, and she believed, as sincerely as her husband, that\r\nPhilip had been free from any unkind intention. But she chiefly dwelt on\r\nher own Guy, especially that last speech, so unlike some of whom she had\r\nheard, who were rather glad to find a flaw in a faultless model, if only\r\nto obtain a fellow-feeling for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 thought she, \xe2\x80\x98he might look far without finding anything better\r\nthan himself, though he won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. If ever he could make me\r\nangry, it will be by treating me as if I was better than he. Such\r\nnonsense! But I suppose his goodness would not be such if he was\r\nconscious of it, so I must be content with him as he is. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be so\r\nunwifelike after all; for I am sure nothing makes me feel so small and\r\nfoolish as that humility of his! Come, I must see about some dinner for\r\nthe French doctor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe set to work on her housewifery cares; but when these were\r\ndespatched, it was hard to begin anything else on such a day of\r\nsuspense, when she was living on reports from the sick room. The\r\ndelirium had returned, more violent than ever; and as she sat at her\r\nopen window she often heard the disconnected words. She could do nothing\r\nbut listen--she could neither read nor draw, and even letter-writing\r\nfailed her to-day, for it seemed cruel to send a letter to his sister,\r\nand if Philip was not under a delusion, it was still worse to write to\r\nHollywell; it made her shudder to think of the misery she might have\r\ninflicted in the former letters, where she had not spared the detail of\r\nher worst fears and conjectures, and by no means softened the account,\r\nas she had done to his sister.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the physician came, and she heard of his being\r\nquieter; indeed, there were no sounds below. It grew dark; Arnaud\r\nbrought lights, and told her Captain Morville had sunk into stupor.\r\nAfter another long space, the doctor came to take some coffee, and said\r\nthe fever was lessening, but that strength was going with it, and if \xe2\x80\x9cle\r\nmalade\xe2\x80\x9d was saved, it would be owing to the care and attention of \xe2\x80\x9cle\r\nchevalier\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nOf Guy she saw no more that evening. The last bulletin was pencilled by\r\nhim on a strip of paper, and sent to her at eleven at night:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pulse almost nothing; deadly faintness; doctor does not give him up; it\r\nmay be many hours: don\xe2\x80\x99t sit up; you shall hear when there is anything\r\ndecisive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy submitted, and slowly put herself to bed, because she thought Guy\r\nwould not like to find her up; but she had little sleep, and that was\r\ndreamy, full of the same anxieties as her waking moments, and perhaps\r\nmaking the night seem longer than if she had been awake the whole time.\r\n\r\nAt last she started from a somewhat sounder doze than usual, and saw it\r\nwas becoming light, the white summits of the mountains were beginning to\r\nshow themselves, and there was twilight in the room. Just then she heard\r\na light, cautious tread in the passage; the lock of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room\r\nwas gently, slowly turned. It was over then! Life or death? Her heart\r\nbeat as she heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s step in the next room, and her suspense\r\nwould let her call out nothing but--\xe2\x80\x98I am not asleep!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy came forward, and stood still, while she looked up to the outline\r\nof his figure against the window. With a kind of effort he said, with\r\nforced calmness--\xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll do now! and came to the bedside. His face was\r\nwet with tears, and her eyes were over-flowing. After a few moments he\r\nmurmured a few low words of deep thanksgivings, and again there was a\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is asleep quietly and comfortably,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, presently, \xe2\x80\x98and his\r\npulse is steadier. The faintness and sinking have been dreadful; the\r\ndoctor has been sitting with his hand on his pulse, telling me when to\r\nput the cordial into his mouth. Twice I thought him all but gone; and\r\ntill within the last hour, I did not think he could have revived; but\r\nnow, the doctor says we may almost consider the danger as over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, how glad I am! Was he sensible? Could he speak?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sensible at least when not fainting; but too weak to speak, or often,\r\nto look up. When he did though, it was very kindly, very pleasantly. And\r\nnow! This is joy coming in the morning, Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder if you are happier now than after the shipwreck,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy,\r\nafter a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How can you ask? The shipwreck was a gleam, the first ray that came to\r\ncheer me in those penance hours, when I was cut off from all; and now,\r\noh, Amy! I cannot enter into it. Such richness and fullness of blessing\r\nshowered on me, more than I ever dared to wish for or dream of, both in\r\nthe present and future hopes. It seems more than can belong to man, at\r\nleast to me, so unlike what I have deserved, that I can hardly believe\r\nit. It must be sent as a great trial.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel thought this so beautiful, that she could not answer; and he\r\npresently gave her some further particulars. He went back in spite of\r\nher entreaties that he would afford himself a little rest, saying that\r\nthe doctor was obliged to go away, and Philip still needed the most\r\ncareful watching. Amy could not sleep any more, but lay musing over that\r\never-brightening goodness which had lately at all times almost startled\r\nher from its very unearthliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 32\r\n\r\n     Sure all things wear a heavenly dress,\r\n     Which sanctifies their loveliness,\r\n     Types of that endless resting day,\r\n     When we shall be as changed as they.\r\n                           --HYMN FOR SUNDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that time there was little more cause for anxiety. Philip was,\r\nindeed, exceedingly reduced, unable to turn in bed, to lift his head,\r\nor to speak except now and then a feeble whisper; but the fever was\r\nentirely gone, and his excellent constitution began rapidly to repair\r\nits ravages. Day by day, almost hour by hour, he was rallying, spending\r\nmost of his time profitably in sleep, and looking very contented in\r\nhis short intervals of waking. These became each day rather longer, his\r\nvoice became stronger, and he made more remarks and inquiries. His\r\nfirst care, when able to take heed of what did not concern his immediate\r\ncomfort, was that Colonel Deane should be written to, as his leave of\r\nabsence was expired; but he said not a word about Hollywell, and Amabel\r\ntherefore hoped her surmise was right, that his confession had been\r\nprompted by a delirious fancy, though Guy thought something was implied\r\nby his silence respecting the very persons of whom it would have been\r\nnatural to have talked.\r\n\r\nHe was very patient of his weakness and dependence, always thankful and\r\nwilling to be pleased, and all that had been unpleasant in his manner to\r\nGuy was entirely gone. He liked to be waited on by him, and received\r\nhis attentions without laborious gratitude, just in the way partly\r\naffectionate, partly matter of course, that was most agreeable; showing\r\nhimself considerate of his fatigue, though without any of his old\r\ndomineering advice.\r\n\r\nOne evening Guy was writing, when Philip, who had been lying still, as\r\nif asleep, asked, \xe2\x80\x98Are you writing to Hollywell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, to Charlotte; but there is no hurry, it won\xe2\x80\x99t go till tomorrow.\r\nHave you any message?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy fancied he sighed; and there was a long silence, at the end of which\r\nhe asked, \xe2\x80\x98Guy, have I said anything about Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, putting down the pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought so; but I could not remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, turning round,\r\nand settling himself for conversation, with much of his ordinary\r\ndeliberate preparation; \xe2\x80\x98I hope it was not when I had no command of\r\nmyself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, you were seldom intelligible, you were generally trying to speak\r\nItalian, or else talking about Stylehurst. The only time you mentioned\r\nher was the night before the worst.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I recollect,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I will not draw back from the resolution\r\nI then made, though I did not know whether I had spoken it, let the\r\nconsequences be what they may. The worst is, that they will fall the\r\nmost severely on her: and her implicit reliance on me was her only\r\nerror.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis voice was very low, and so full of painful feeling that Guy doubted\r\nwhether to let him enter on such a subject at present; but remembering\r\nthe relief of free confession, he thought it best to allow him to\r\nproceed, only now and then putting in some note of sympathy or of\r\ninterrogation, in word or gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must explain,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98that you may see how little blame can be\r\nimputed to her. It was that summer, three years ago, the first after you\r\ncame. I had always been her chief friend. I saw, or thought I saw, cause\r\nfor putting her on her guard. The result has shown that the danger\r\nwas imaginary; but no matter--I thought it real. In the course of the\r\nconversation, more of my true sentiments were avowed than I was aware\r\nof; she was very young, and before we, either of us, knew what we were\r\ndoing, it had been equivalent to a declaration. Well! I do not speak to\r\nexcuse the concealment, but to show you my motive. If it had been known,\r\nthere would have been great displeasure and disturbance; I should have\r\nbeen banished; and though time might have softened matters, we should\r\nboth have had a great deal to go through. Heaven knows what it may be\r\nnow! And, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, breaking off with trembling eagerness, \xe2\x80\x98when\r\ndid you hear from Hollywell? Do you know how she has borne the news of\r\nmy illness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have heard since they knew of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98the letter was from\r\nMrs. Edmonstone to Amy; but she did not mention Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has great strength; she would endure anything rather than give way;\r\nbut how can she have borne the anxiety and silence? You are sure my aunt\r\ndoes not mention her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certain. I will ask Amy for the letter, if you like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, do not go; I must finish, since I have begun. We did not speak of\r\nan engagement; it was little more than an avowal of preference; I doubt\r\nwhether she understood what it amounted to, and I desired her to be\r\nsilent. I deceived myself all along, by declaring she was free; and I\r\nhad never asked for her promise; but those things will not do when we\r\nsee death face to face, and a resolve made at such a moment must be\r\nkept, let it bring what it may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98True.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will be relieved; she wished it to be known; but I thought it best\r\nto wait for my promotion--the only chance of our being able to marry.\r\nHowever, it shall be put into her father\xe2\x80\x99s hands as soon as I can hold\r\na pen. All I wish is, that she should not have to bear the brunt of his\r\nanger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is too kind and good-natured to keep his displeasure long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it would only light on the right head, instead of on the head of the\r\nnearest. You say she was harassed and out of spirits. I wish you were at\r\nhome; Amy would comfort her and soften them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We hope to go back as soon as you are in travelling condition. If you\r\nwill come home with us, you will be at hand when Mr. Edmonstone is ready\r\nto forgive, as I am sure he soon will be. No one ever was so glad to\r\nforget his displeasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; it will be over by the time I meet him, for she will have borne it\r\nall. There is the worst! But I will not put off the writing, as soon\r\nas I have the power. Every day the concealment continues is a further\r\noffence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And present suffering is an especial earnest and hope of forgiveness,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Guy. \xe2\x80\x98I have no doubt that much may be done to make Mr. Edmonstone\r\nthink well of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If any suffering of mine would spare hers!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed Philip. \xe2\x80\x98You cannot\r\nestimate the difficulties in our way. You know nothing of poverty,--the\r\nbar it is to everything; almost a positive offence in itself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is only tiring yourself with talking,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, perceiving how\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s bodily weakness was making him fall into a desponding strain.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must make haste to get well, and come home with us, and I think we\r\nshall find it no such bad case after all. There\xe2\x80\x99s Amy\xe2\x80\x99s fortune to begin\r\nwith, only waiting for such an occasion. No, I can\xe2\x80\x99t have you answer;\r\nyou have talked, quite long enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip was in a state of feebleness that made him willing to avoid the\r\ntrouble of thinking, by simply believing what he was told, \xe2\x80\x98that it was\r\nno bad case.\xe2\x80\x99 He was relieved by having confessed, though to the person\r\nwhom, a few weeks back, he would have thought the last to whom he could\r\nhave made such a communication, over whom he had striven to assume\r\nsuperiority, and therefore before whom he could have least borne to\r\nhumble himself--nay, whose own love he had lately traversed with an\r\narrogance that was rendered positively absurd by this conduct of his\r\nown. Nevertheless, he had not shrunk from the confession. His had been\r\nreal repentance, so far as he perceived his faults; and he would have\r\nscorned to avail himself of the certainty of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s silence on what he\r\nhad said at the time of his extreme danger. He had resolved to speak,\r\nand had found neither an accuser nor a judge, not even one\r\nconsciously returning good for evil, but a friend with honest, simple,\r\nstraightforward kindness, doing the best for him in his power, and\r\ndreading nothing so much as hurting his feelings. It was not the way in\r\nwhich Philip himself could have received such a confidence.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Guy could leave him, he went up to his wife. \xe2\x80\x98Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\nrather sadly, \xe2\x80\x98we have had it out. It is too true.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer first exclamation surprised him: \xe2\x80\x98Then Charlie really is the\r\ncleverest person in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How? Had he any suspicion?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I know of; but, more than once, lately, I have been alarmed by\r\nrecollecting how he once said that poor Laura was so much too wise for\r\nher age, that Nature would some day take her revenge, and make her do\r\nsomething very foolish. But has Philip told you all about it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; explained it all very kindly. It must have cost him a great deal;\r\nbut he spoke openly and nobly. It is the beginning of a full confession\r\nto your father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So, it is true!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amabel, as if she heard it for the first\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x98How shocked mamma will be! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to think it possible!\r\nAnd poor Laura! Imagine what she must have gone through, for you know I\r\nnever spared the worst accounts. Do tell me all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy told what he had just heard, and she was indignant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t be as angry with him as I should like,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98now that he\r\nis sorry and ill; but it was a great deal too bad! I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how he\r\ncould look any of us in the face, far less expect to rule us all, and\r\ninterfere with you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see I never appreciated the temptations of poverty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy,\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x98I have often thought of those of wealth, but never of\r\npoverty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you would not excuse him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind your doing it about\r\nourselves, because, though he made you unhappy, he could not make you\r\ndo wrong. Ah! I know what you mean; but that was over after the first\r\nminute; and he only made you better for all his persecution; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how to pardon his making poor Laura so miserable, and leading her\r\nto do what was not right. Poor, dear girl! no wonder she looked so worn\r\nand unhappy! I cannot help being angry with him, indeed, Guy!\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\nher eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The best pleading is his own repentance, Amy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can\r\nbe very unrelenting when you see how subdued and how altered he is. You\r\nknow you are to make him a visit to-morrow, now the doctor says all fear\r\nof infection is over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall be thinking of poor Laura the whole time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how she would like to see him in his present state? What shall\r\nyou do if I bring him home to Redclyffe? Shall you go to Hollywell, to\r\ncomfort Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall wait till you send me. Besides, how can you invite company till\r\nwe know whether we have a roof over our house or not? What is he doing\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As usual, he has an unlimited capacity for sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish you had. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have slept two hours together since\r\nyou left off sitting up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am beginning to think it a popular delusion. I do just as well\r\nwithout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you say; but Mr. Shene would never have taken such a fancy to you,\r\nif you always had such purple lines as those under your eyes. Look!\r\nIs that a face for Sir Galahad, or Sir Guy, or any of the Round Table?\r\nCome, I wish you would lie down, and be read to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like a walk much better. It is very cool and bright. Will you\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey walked for some time, talking over the conduct of Philip and\r\nLaura. Amabel seemed quite oppressed by the thought of such a burthen of\r\nconcealment. She said she did not know what she should have done in\r\nher own troubles without mamma and Charlie; and she could not imagine\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s keeping silence through the time of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s danger; more\r\nespecially as she recollected how appalling some of her bulletins had\r\nbeen. The only satisfaction was in casting as much of the blame on him\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know he never would let her read novels; and I do believe that was\r\nthe reason she did not understand what it meant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think there is a good deal in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, laughing, \xe2\x80\x98though\r\nCharlie would say it is a very _novel_ excuse for a young lady falling\r\nimprudently in love.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do believe, if it was any one but Laura, Charlie would be very glad\r\nof it. He always fully saw through Philip\xe2\x80\x99s supercilious shell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; let me go on, Guy, for you must allow that it was much worse in\r\nsuch a grave, grand, unromantic person, who makes a point of thinking\r\nbefore he speaks, than if it had been a hasty, hand-over-head man like\r\nMaurice de Courcy, who might have got into a scrape without knowing it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That must have made the struggle to confess all the more painful; and a\r\nmost free, noble, open-hearted confession it was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey tried to recollect all that had passed during that summer, and to\r\nguess against whom he had wished to warn her; but so far were they from\r\ndivining the truth, that they agreed it must either have been Maurice,\r\nor some other wild Irishman.\r\n\r\nNext, they considered what was to be done. Philip must manage his\r\nconfession his own way; but they had it in their power greatly to\r\nsoften matters; and there was no fear that, after the first shock,\r\nMr. Edmonstone would insist on the engagement being broken off, Philip\r\nshould come to recover his health at Redclyffe, where he would be ready\r\nto meet the first advance towards forgiveness,--and Amabel thought it\r\nwould soon be made. Papa\xe2\x80\x99s anger was sharp, but soon over; he was very\r\nfond of Philip, and delighted in a love affair, but she was afraid mamma\r\nwould not get over it so soon, for she would be excessively hurt and\r\ngrieved. \xe2\x80\x98And when I was naughty,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98nothing ever made me so\r\nsorry as mamma\xe2\x80\x99s kindness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy launched out into more schemes for facilitating their marriage than\r\never he had made for himself; and the walk ended with extensive castle\r\nbuilding on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s account, in the course of which Amy was obliged\r\nto become much less displeased. Guy told her, in the evening, that she\r\nwould have been still more softened if she could have heard him talk\r\nabout Stylehurst and his father. Guy had always wished to hear him speak\r\nof the Archdeacon, though they had never been on terms to enter on such\r\na subject. And now Philip had been much pleased by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s account of his\r\nwalks to Stylehurst, and taken pleasure in telling which were his old\r\nhaunts, making out where Guy had been, and describing his father\xe2\x80\x99s ways.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and Amabel was to pay her cousin a visit. Guy\r\nwas very eager about it, saying it was like a stage in his recovery; and\r\nthough the thought of her mother and Laura could not be laid aside, she\r\nwould not say a word to damp her husband\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure in the anticipation.\r\nIt seemed as if Guy, wanting to bestow all he could upon his cousin in\r\ngratitude for his newly-accorded friendship, thought the sight of his\r\nlittle wife the very best thing he had to give.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful day, early in September, with a little autumnal\r\nfreshness in the mountain breezes that they enjoyed exceedingly.\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s convalescence, and their own escape, might be considered as so\r\nfar decided, that they might look back on the peril as past. Amabel felt\r\nhow much cause there was for thankfulness; and, after all, Philip\r\nwas not half as bad now as when he was maintaining his system of\r\nconcealment; he had made a great effort, and was about to do his best\r\nby way of reparation; but it was so new to her to pity him, that she did\r\nnot know how to begin.\r\n\r\nShe tried to make the day seem as Sunday-like as she could, by putting\r\non her white muslin dress and white ribbons, with Charles\xe2\x80\x99s hair\r\nbracelet, and a brooch of beautiful silver workmanship, which Guy had\r\nbought for her at Milan, the only ornament he had ever given to her.\r\nShe sat at her window, watching the groups of Italians in their holiday\r\ncostume, and dwelling on the strange thoughts that had passed through\r\nher mind often before in her lonely Sundays in this foreign land,\r\nthinking much of her old home and East-hill Church, wondering whether\r\nthe letter had yet arrived which was to free them from anxiety, and\r\nlosing herself in a maze of uncomfortable marvels about Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then,\xe2\x80\x99 at length said Guy, entering, \xe2\x80\x98I only hope he has not\r\nknocked himself up with his preparations, for he would make such a\r\nsetting to rights, that I told him I could almost fancy he expected the\r\nqueen instead of only Dame Amabel Morville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe led her down, opened the door, and playfully announced, \xe2\x80\x98Lady\r\nMorville! I have done it right this time. Here she is\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n\r\nShe had of course expected to see Philip much altered, but she was\r\nstartled by the extent of the change; for being naturally fair and\r\nhigh-coloured, he was a person on whom the traces of illness were\r\nparticularly visible. The colour was totally gone, even from his lips;\r\nhis cheeks were sunken, his brow looked broader and more massive\r\nfrom the thinness of his face and the loss of his hair, and his eyes\r\nthemselves appeared unlike what they used to be in the hollows round\r\nthem. He seemed tranquil, and comfortable, but so wan, weak, and\r\nsubdued, and so different from himself, that she was very much shocked,\r\nas smiling and holding out a hand, where the white skin seemed hardly\r\nto cover the bone and blue vein, he said, in a tone, slow, feeble, and\r\nlanguid, though cheerful,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Amy. You see Guy was right, after all. I am sorry to have\r\nmade your wedding tour end so unpleasantly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, most pleasantly, since you are better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, laughing,\r\nbecause she was almost ready to cry, and her displeasure went straight\r\nout of her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Are you doing the honours of my room, Guy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, raising his\r\nhead from the pillow, with a becoming shade of his ceremonious courtesy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Give her a chair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy smiled and thanked him, while he lay gazing at her as a sick person\r\nis apt to do at a flower, or the first pretty enlivening object from\r\nwhich he is able to derive enjoyment, and as if he could not help\r\nexpressing the feeling, he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that your wedding-dress, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; that was all lace and finery.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You look so nice and bridal--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment that such an old wife ought to make the most of,\r\nAmy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, looking at her with a certain proud satisfaction in\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s admiration. \xe2\x80\x98It is high time to leave off calling you a bride,\r\nafter your splendid appearance at the party at Munich, in all your\r\nwhiteness and orange-flowers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was quite enough of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98you have all your troubles in the visiting\r\nline to come, when you go home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you know the people, and will be a great help to us,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy,\r\nand Guy was much pleased to hear her taking a voluntary share in the\r\ninvitation, knowing as he did that she only half liked it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you; we shall see,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; we shall see when you are fit for the journey, and it will not be\r\nlong before we can begin, by short stages. You have got on wonderfully\r\nin the last few days. How do you think he is looking, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 finished\r\nGuy, with an air of triumph, that was rather amusing, considering what a\r\npale skeleton face he was regarding with so much satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say he is looking much mended,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but you must not\r\nexpect me to see it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t get a compliment for me, Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I was a good\r\ndeal surprised when Arnaud brought me the glass this morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a pity you did not see yourself a week ago,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, shaking\r\nhis head drolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is certain, as the French doctor says, that monsieur has a very\r\nvigorous constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles says, having a good constitution is only another name for\r\nundergoing every possible malady,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather good\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98for I certainly find it answer very well to\r\nhave none at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, rather startled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or how do you know?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip; \xe2\x80\x98especially as you never were ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a dictum of old Walters, the Moorworth doctor, the last time\r\nI had anything to do with him, when I was a small child. I suppose I\r\nremembered it for its oracular sound, and because I was not intended\r\nto listen. He was talking over with Markham some illness I had just got\r\nthrough, and wound up with, \xe2\x80\x9cHe may be healthy and active now; but he\r\nhas no constitution, there is a tendency to low fever, and if he meets\r\nwith any severe illness, it will go hard with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How glad I am I did not know that before\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you remember it when you came here?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, not in the least conscious of the impression his words\r\nmade on the others. \xe2\x80\x98By the bye, Philip, I wish you would tell us how\r\nyou fared after we parted, and how you came here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went on according to my former plan,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, \xe2\x80\x98walking through\r\nthe Valtelline, and coming down by a mountain path. I was not well at\r\nBolzano, but I thought it only fatigue, which a Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s rest would\r\nremove, so on I went for the next two days, in spite of pain in head and\r\nlimbs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not walking!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, walking. I thought it was stiffness from mountain climbing, and\r\nthat I could walk it off; but I never wish to go through anything like\r\nwhat I did the last day, between the up and downs of that mountain path,\r\nand the dazzle of the snow and heat of the sun. I meant to have reached\r\nVicenza, but I must have been quite knocked up when I arrived here,\r\nthough I cannot tell. My head grew so confused, that my dread, all the\r\nway, was that I should forget my Italian; I can just remember conning a\r\nphrase over and over again, lest I should lose it. I suppose I was able\r\nto speak when I came here, but the last thing I remember was feeling\r\nvery ill in some room, different from this, quite alone, and with a\r\nhorror of dying deserted. The next is a confused recollection of the\r\nrelief of hearing English again, and seeing my excellent nurse here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a little more talk, but a little was enough for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeeble voice, and Guy soon told him he was tired, and ordered in his\r\nbroth. He begged that Amy would stay, and it was permitted on condition\r\nthat he would not talk, Guy even cutting short a quotation of,--\xe2\x80\x98As Juno\r\nhad been sick and he her dieter,\xe2\x80\x99--appropriate to the excellence of\r\nthe broths, which Amabel and her maid, thanks to their experience of\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s fastidious tastes, managed to devise and execute, in spite\r\nof bad materials. It was no small merit in Guy to stop the compliment,\r\nconsidering how edified he had been by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected ingenuity,\r\nand what a comical account he had written of it to her mother, such, as\r\nAmy told him, deserved to be published in a book of good advice to young\r\nladies, to show what they might come to if they behaved well. However,\r\nshe was glad to have ocular demonstration of the success of the cookery,\r\nwhich she had feared might turn out uneatable; and her gentle\r\nfeelings towards Philip were touched, by seeing one wont to be full of\r\nindependence and self-assertion, now meek and helpless, requiring to\r\nbe lifted, and propped up with pillows, and depending entirely and\r\nthankfully upon Guy.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been settled and made comfortable, they read the service;\r\nand she thought her husband\xe2\x80\x99s tones had never been so sweet as now,\r\nmodulated to the pitch best suited to the sickroom, and with the\r\npeculiarly beautiful expression he always gave such reading. It was the\r\nlesson from Jeremiah, on the different destiny of Josiah and his sons,\r\nand he read that verse, \xe2\x80\x98Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him,\r\nbut weep sore for him that goeth away; for he shall return no more, nor\r\nsee his native country;\xe2\x80\x99 with so remarkable a melancholy and beauty in\r\nhis voice, that she could hardly refrain from tears, and it also greatly\r\nstruck Philip, who had been so near \xe2\x80\x98returning no more, neither seeing\r\nhis native country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the reading was over, and they were leaving him to rest, while they\r\nwent to dinner, he said, as he wished Amy good-bye, \xe2\x80\x98Till now I never\r\ndiscovered the practical advantage of such a voice as Guy\xe2\x80\x99s. There never\r\nwas such a one for a sick-room. Last week, I could not bear any one else\r\nto speak at all; and even now, no one else could have read so that I\r\ncould like it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your voice; yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, after they had returned to their own\r\nsitting-room. \xe2\x80\x98I want to hear it very much. I wonder when you will sing\r\nto me again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not till he has recovered strength to bear the infliction with\r\nfirmness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy; \xe2\x80\x98but, Amy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we will do, if you\r\nare sure it is good for you. He will have a good long sleep, and we will\r\nhave a walk on the green hillocks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAccordingly they wandered in the cool of the evening on the grassy\r\nslopes under the chestnut-trees, making it a Sunday walk, calm, bright\r\nand meditative, without many words, but those deep and grave, \xe2\x80\x98such as\r\ntheir walks had been before they were married,\xe2\x80\x99 as Amabel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.\r\n\r\nA silence, broken by her asking, \xe2\x80\x98Do you recollect your melancholy\r\ndefinition of happiness, years ago?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gleams from another world, too soon eclipsed or forfeited. It made me\r\nsad then. Do you hold to it now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to know what you would say now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gleams from another world, brightening as it gets nearer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel repeated--\r\n\r\n\r\n       Ever the richest, tenderest glow,\r\n       Sets round the autumnal sun;\r\n       But their sight fails, no heart may know\r\n       The bliss when life is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old age,\xe2\x80\x99 she added; \xe2\x80\x98that seems very far off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Each day is a step,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, and then came a silence while both\r\nwere thinking deeply.\r\n\r\nThey sat down to rest under a tree, the mountains before them with heavy\r\ndark clouds hanging on their sides, and the white crowns clear against\r\nthe blue sky, a perfect stillness on all around, and the red glow of an\r\nItalian sunset just fading away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is only one thing wanting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98You may sing now. You are\r\nfar from Philip\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. Suppose we chant this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s psalms.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the fifth day of the month, and the psalms seemed especially\r\nsuitable to their thoughts. Before the 29th was finished, it was\r\nbeginning to grow dark. There were a few pale flashes of lightning\r\nin the mountains, and at the words \xe2\x80\x98The voice of the Lord shaketh the\r\nwilderness,\xe2\x80\x99 a low but solemn peal of thunder came as an accompaniment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe full sweet melody died away, but the echo caught it up and answered\r\nlike the chant of a spirit in the distance--\xe2\x80\x98The blessing of peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe effect was too solemn and mysterious to be disturbed by word or\r\nremark. Guy drew her arm into his, and they turned homewards.\r\n\r\nThey had some distance to walk, and night had closed in before they\r\nreached the village, but was only more lovely. The thunder rolled\r\nsolemnly among the hills, but the young moon shone in marvellous\r\nwhiteness on the snowy crowns, casting fantastic shadows from the crags,\r\nwhile whole showers of fire-flies were falling on them from the trees,\r\nfloating and glancing in the shade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a pity to go in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. But Arnaud did not seem to be of the\r\nsame opinion: he came out to meet them very anxiously, expostulating on\r\nthe dangers of the autumnal dew; and Guy owned that though it had been\r\nthe most wonderful and delightful evening he had ever known, he was\r\nrather fatigued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 33\r\n\r\n     From darkness here and dreariness,\r\n     We ask not full repose.\r\n                        --CHRISTIAN YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the fatigue which Guy had undergone was going to make\r\nitself felt at last, for he had a slight headache the next morning, and\r\nseemed dull and weary. Both he and Amabel sat for some time with Philip,\r\nand when she went away to write her letters, Philip began discussing\r\na plan which had occurred to him of offering himself as chief of the\r\nconstabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. It was\r\nan office which would suit him very well, and opened a new hope of\r\nhis marriage, and he proceeded to reckon on Lord Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\r\ncounting up all the magistrates he knew, and talking them over with Guy,\r\nwho, however, did not know enough of his own neighbourhood to be of much\r\nuse; and when he came up-stairs a little after, said he was vexed\r\nat having been so stupid. He was afraid he had seemed unkind and\r\nindifferent. But the truth was that he was so heavy and drowsy, that he\r\nhad actually fallen twice into a doze while Philip was talking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98gentle sleep will take her revenge at last for\r\nyour calling her a popular delusion. Lie down, let her have her own way,\r\nand you will be good for something by and by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe took her advice, slept for a couple of hours, and awoke a good deal\r\nrefreshed, so that though his head still ached, he was able to attend as\r\nusual to Philip in the evening.\r\n\r\nHe did not waken the next morning till so late, that he sprung up\r\nin consternation, and began to dress in haste to go to Philip; but\r\npresently he came back from his dressing-room with a hasty uncertain\r\nstep, and threw himself down on the bed. Amabel came to his side in an\r\ninstant, much frightened at his paleness, but he spoke directly. \xe2\x80\x98Only\r\na fit of giddiness--it is going off;\xe2\x80\x99 and he raised himself, but was\r\nobliged to lie down again directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You had better keep quiet\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98Is it your headache?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is aching,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, and she put her hand over it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How hot and throbbing!\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98You must have caught cold in that\r\nwalk. No, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to move; it is only making it worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go to Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, starting up; but this brought on\r\nsuch a sensation of dizziness and faintness, that he sunk back on the\r\npillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; it is of no use to fight against it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, as soon as he was a\r\nlittle better. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind Philip, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to him. You must keep quiet,\r\nand I will get you a cup of hot tea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he lay still, she had the comfort of seeing him somewhat revived, but\r\nhe listened to her persuasions not to attempt to move. It was later than\r\nshe had expected, and she found that breakfast was laid out in the next\r\nroom. She brought him some tea; but he did not seem inclined to lift\r\nhis head to drink it; and begged her to go at once to Philip, fearing\r\nhe must be thinking himself strangely forgotten, and giving her many\r\ndirections about the way he liked to be waited on at breakfast.\r\n\r\nVery much surprised was Philip to see her instead, of her husband, and\r\ngreatly concerned to hear that Guy was not well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Over-fatigue,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98He could not but feel the effects of such\r\nlong-continued exertion.\xe2\x80\x99 Then, after an interval, during which he had\r\nbegun breakfast, with many apologies for letting her wait on him, he\r\nsaid, with some breaks, \xe2\x80\x98Never was there such a nurse as he, Amy; I have\r\nfelt much more than I can express, especially now. You will never have\r\nto complain of my harsh judgment again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is too much for you to talk of these things,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, moved\r\nby the trembling of his feeble voice, but too anxious to return to\r\nher husband to like to wait even to hear that Philip\xe2\x80\x99s opinion _had_\r\naltered. It required much self-command not to hurry, even by manner,\r\nher cousin\xe2\x80\x99s tardy, languid movements; but she had been well trained by\r\nCharles in waiting on sick breakfasts.\r\n\r\nWhen at length she was able to escape, she found that Guy had undressed,\r\nand gone to bed again. He said he was more comfortable, and desired\r\nher to go and take her own breakfast before coming back to him, and she\r\nobeyed as well as she could, but very soon was again with him. He\r\nlooked flushed and oppressed, and when she put her cool hand across his\r\nforehead, she was frightened at the increased throbbing of his temples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking steadily at her, \xe2\x80\x98this is the fever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout answering, she drew his hand into hers, and felt his pulse,\r\nwhich did indeed plainly respond fever. Each knew that the other was\r\nrecollecting what he had said, on Sunday, of the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prediction,\r\nand Amy knew he was thinking of death; but all that passed was a\r\nproposal to send at once for the French physician. Amabel wrote her note\r\nwith steadiness, derived from the very force of the shock. She could\r\nnot think; she did not know whether she feared or hoped. To act from\r\none moment to another was all she attempted, and it was well that her\r\nimagination did not open to be appalled at her own situation--so young,\r\nalone with the charge of two sick men in a foreign country; her cousin,\r\nindeed, recovering, but helpless, and not even in a state to afford her\r\ncounsel; her husband sickening for this frightful fever, and with\r\nmore than ordinary cause for apprehension, even without the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecy, when she thought of his slight frame, and excitable\r\ntemperament, and that though never as yet tried by a day\xe2\x80\x99s illness, he\r\ncertainly had more spirit than strength, while all the fatigue he\r\nhad been undergoing was likely to tell upon him now. She did not\r\nlook forward, she did not look round; she did not hope or fear; she\r\n_trusted_, and did her best for each, as she was wanted, trying not to\r\nmake herself useless to both, by showing that she wished to be in two\r\nplaces at once.\r\n\r\nIt was a day sufficiently distressing in itself had there been no\r\nfurther apprehension, for there was the restlessness of illness, working\r\non a character too active and energetic to acquiesce without a trial in\r\nthe certainty that there was no remedy for present discomfort. There was\r\nno impatience nor rebellion against the illness itself, but a wish to\r\ntry one after another the things that had been effective in relieving\r\nPhilip during his recovery. At the same time, he could not bear that\r\nAmabel should do anything to tire herself, and was very anxious that\r\nPhilip should not be neglected. He tossed from one side to the other\r\nin burning oppression or cold chills; Amy saw him looking wistful,\r\nsuggested something by way of alleviation, then found he had been\r\nwishing for it, but refraining from asking in order to spare her, and\r\nthat he was sorry when she procured it. Again and again this happened;\r\nshe smoothed the coverings, and shook up the pillow: he would thank\r\nher, look at her anxiously, beg her not to exert herself, but soon grew\r\nrestless, and the whole was repeated.\r\n\r\nAt last, as she was trying to arrange the coverings, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see how it is. This is impatience. Now, I will not stir for an hour,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand as he made the resolution, he smiled at treating himself so like a\r\nchild. His power of self-restraint came to his aid, and long before the\r\nhour was over he had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nThis was a relief; yet that oppressed, flushed, discomposed slumber, and\r\nheavy breathing only confirmed her fears that the fever had gained full\r\npossession of him. She had not the heart to write such tidings, at least\r\ntill the physician should have made them too certain, nor could she even\r\nbear to use the word \xe2\x80\x98feverish,\xe2\x80\x99 in her answers to the anxious inquiries\r\nPhilip made whenever she went into his room, though when he averted his\r\nface with a heavy sigh, she knew his conclusion was the same as her own.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the physician was the only thing wanting to bring home\r\nthe certainty, and that fell on her like lead in the evening; with one\r\ncomfort, however, that he thought it a less severe case than the former\r\none. It was a great relief, too, that there was no wandering of mind,\r\nonly the extreme drowsiness and oppression; and when Guy was roused by\r\nthe doctor\xe2\x80\x99s visit, he was as clear and collected as possible, making\r\ninquiries and remarks, and speaking in a particularly calm and quiet\r\nmanner. As soon as the doctor was gone, he looked up to Amabel, saying,\r\nwith his own smile, only very dim,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be of no use, and it would not be true, to say I had rather\r\nyou did not nurse me. The doctor hopes there is not much danger of\r\ninfection, and it is too late for precautions.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you must be wise, and not hurt yourself. Will you promise me not to\r\nsit up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very kind of you to tell me nothing worse,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with a sad\r\nsubmissiveness.\r\n\r\nHe smiled again. \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking very\r\ntenderly at her. \xe2\x80\x98To have us both on your hands at once! But it comes\r\nstraight from Heaven, that is one comfort, and you made up your mind to\r\nsuch things when you took me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSadness in his eye, a sweet smile on his lip, and serenity on his brow,\r\njoined with the fevered cheek, the air of lassitude, and the panting,\r\noppressed breath, there was a strange, melancholy beauty about him;\r\nand while Amy felt an impulse of ardent, clinging affection to one so\r\nprecious to her, there was joined with it a sort of awe and veneration\r\nfor one who so spoke, looked, and felt. She hung over him, and sprinkled\r\nhim with Eau-de-Cologne; then as his hair teased him by falling into his\r\neyes, he asked her to cut the front lock off. There was something sad\r\nin doing this, for that \xe2\x80\x98tumble-down wave,\xe2\x80\x99 as Charlotte called it, was\r\nrather a favourite of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s; it always seemed to have so much sympathy\r\nwith his moods, and it was as if parting with it was resigning him to a\r\nlong illness. However, it was too troublesome not to go, and he looked\r\namused at the care with which she folded up the glossy, brown wave, and\r\ntreasured it in her dressing-case, then she read to him a few verses of\r\na psalm, and he soon fell into another doze.\r\n\r\nThere was little more of event, day after day. The fever never ran as\r\nhigh as in Philip\xe2\x80\x99s case, and there was no delirium. There was almost\r\nconstant torpor, but when for any short space he was thoroughly\r\nawakened, his mind was perfectly clear, though he spoke little, and then\r\nonly on the subject immediately presented to him. There he lay for\r\none quiet hour after another, while Amy sat by him, with as little\r\nconsciousness of time as he had himself, looking neither forward nor\r\nbackward, only to the present, to give him drink, bathe his face and\r\nhands, arrange his pillows, or read or repeat some soothing verse. It\r\nalways was a surprise when meal times summoned her to attend to Philip,\r\nwhen she was asked for the letters for the post, when evening twilight\r\ngathered in, or when she had to leave the night-watch to Arnaud, and go\r\nto bed in the adjoining room.\r\n\r\nThis was a great trial, but he would not allow her to sit up; and her\r\nown sense showed her that if this was to be a long illness, it would\r\nnot do to waste her strength. She knew he was quiet at night, and her\r\ntrustful temper so calmed and supported her, that she was able to sleep,\r\nand thus was not as liable to be overworked as might have been feared,\r\nand as Philip thought she must be.\r\n\r\nShe always appeared in his room with her sweet face mournful and\r\nanxious, but never ruffled, or with any air of haste or discomfiture,\r\ndesirous as she was to return to her husband; for, though he frequently\r\nsent her to take care of herself or of Philip, she knew that while she\r\nwas away he always grew more restless and uncomfortable, and his look of\r\nrelief at her re-entrance said as much to her as a hundred complaints of\r\nher absence would have done.\r\n\r\nPhilip was in the meantime sorely tried by being forced to be entirely\r\ninactive and dependent, while he saw Amabel in such need of assistance;\r\nand so far from being able to requite Guy\xe2\x80\x99s care, he could only look on\r\nhimself as the cause of their distress, and an addition to it--a burthen\r\ninstead of a help. If he had been told a little while ago what would be\r\nthe present state of things, he would almost have laughed the speaker\r\nto scorn. He would never have thought a child as competent as Amy to the\r\nsole management of two sick persons, and he not able either to advise\r\nor cheer her. Yet he could not see anything went wrong that depended on\r\nher. His comforts were so cared for, that he was often sorry she should\r\nhave troubled herself about them; and though he could have little of her\r\ncompany, he never was allowed to feel himself deserted. Anne, Arnaud,\r\nthe old Italian nurse, or Amy herself, were easily summoned, and gave\r\nhim full care and attention.\r\n\r\nHe was, however, necessarily a good deal alone; and though his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks were at his disposal, eyes and head were too weak for reading, and\r\nhe was left a prey to his own thoughts. His great comfort was, that Guy\r\nwas less ill than he had been himself, and that there was no present\r\ndanger; otherwise, he could never have endured the conviction that all\r\nhad been caused by his own imprudence. Imprudence! Philip was brought\r\nvery low to own that such a word applied to him, yet it would have been\r\nwell for him had that been the chief burthen on his mind. Was it only an\r\nordinary service of friendship and kindred that Guy had, at the peril\r\nof his own life, rendered him? Was it not a positive return of good\r\nfor evil? Yes, evil! He now called that evil, or at least harshness and\r\nhastiness in judgment, which he had hitherto deemed true friendship and\r\nconsideration for Guy and Amy. Every feeling of distrust and jealousy\r\nhad been gradually softening since his recovery began; gratitude had\r\ndone much, and dismay at Guy\xe2\x80\x99s illness did more. It would have been\r\nnoble and generous in Guy to act as he had done, had Philip\xe2\x80\x99s surmises\r\nbeen correct, and this he began to doubt, though it was his only\r\njustification, and even to wish to lose it. He had rather believe Guy\r\nblameless. He would do so, if possible; and he resolved, on the first\r\nopportunity, to beg him to give him one last assurance that all was\r\nright, and implicitly believe him. But how was it possible again\r\nto assume to be a ruler and judge over Guy after it was known\r\nhow egregiously he himself had erred? There was shame, sorrow,\r\nself-humiliation, and anxiety wherever he turned, and it was no wonder\r\nthat depression of spirits retarded his recovery.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the tenth day after Guy\xe2\x80\x99s illness had begun that Philip\r\nwas able to be dressed, and to come into the next room, where Amabel had\r\npromised to dine with him. As he lay on the sofa, she thought he looked\r\neven more ill than in bed, the change from his former appearance being\r\nrendered more visible, and his great height making him look the more\r\nthin. He was apparently exhausted with the exertion of dressing, for he\r\nwas very silent all dinner-time, though Amabel could have better talked\r\nto-day than for some time past, since Guy had had some refreshing sleep,\r\nwas decidedly less feverish, seemed better for nourishing food, and said\r\nthat he wanted nothing but a puff of Redclyffe wind to make him well.\r\nHe was pleased to hear of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s step in recovery, and altogether, Amy\r\nwas cheered and happy.\r\n\r\nShe left her cousin as soon as dinner was over, and did not come to him\r\nagain for nearly an hour and a half. She was then surprised to find\r\nhim finishing a letter, resting his head on one hand, and looking wan,\r\nweary, and very unhappy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you come to letter writing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, in a worn, dejected tone, \xe2\x80\x98I must ask you to direct\r\nthis, I can\xe2\x80\x99t make it legible,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo wonder, so much did his hand tremble, as he held out the envelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To your sister?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; to yours. I never wrote to her before. There\xe2\x80\x99s one enclosed to your\r\nfather, to tell all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad you have done it,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Amy, in a quiet tone of sincere\r\ncongratulation. \xe2\x80\x98You will be better now it is off your mind. But how\r\ntired you are. You must go back to bed. Shall I call Arnaud?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must rest first\xe2\x80\x99--and his voice failing, he laid back on the sofa,\r\nclosed his eyes, turned ashy pale, and became so faint that she could\r\nnot leave him, and was obliged to apply every restorative within reach\r\nbefore she could bring him back to a state of tolerable comfort.\r\n\r\nThe next minute her work was nearly undone, when Anne came in to ask for\r\nthe letters for the post. \xe2\x80\x98Shall I send yours?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Amy.\r\n\r\nHe muttered an assent. But when she looked back to him after speaking to\r\nAnne, she saw a tremulous, almost convulsed working of the closed eyes\r\nand mouth, while the thin hands were clenched together with a force\r\ncontrasting with the helpless manner in which they had hung a moment\r\nbefore. She guessed at the intensity of anguish it mast cost a temper so\r\nproud, a heart of so strong a mould, and feelings so deep, to take the\r\nfirst irrevocable step in self-humiliation, giving up into the hands of\r\nothers the engagement that had hitherto been the cherished treasure\r\nof his life; and above all, in exposing Laura to bear the brunt of the\r\npenalty of the fault into which he had led her. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, for Guy to comfort\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x99 thought she, feeling herself entirely incompetent, dreading to\r\nintrude on his feelings, yet thinking it unkind to go away without one\r\nsympathizing word when he was in such distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will be glad, in time,\xe2\x80\x99 at last she said. He made no answer.\r\n\r\nShe held the stimulants to him again, and tried to arrange him more\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 at last he said. \xe2\x80\x98How is Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has just had another nice quiet sleep, and is quite refreshed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is a blessing, at least. But does not he want you? I have been\r\nkeeping you a long time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, as he is awake, I should like to go back. You are better\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, while I don\xe2\x80\x99t move.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t try. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send Arnaud, and as soon as you can, you had better go\r\nto bed again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGuy was still awake, and able to hear what she had to tell him about\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98We must try to soften it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shall I write?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Mamma will be pleased to hear of his having\r\ntold you, and they must be sorry for him, when they hear how much the\r\nletter cost him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! they will not guess at half his sorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will write to papa, and send it after the other letters, so that he\r\nmay read it before he hears of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Could not you write a note to her too? I want\r\nher to be told that I am very sorry, if I ever gave her pain by speaking\r\nthoughtlessly of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98you have not much to reproach yourself with\r\nin that way. It was I that always abused him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can never do so again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can, now I have seen his sorrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel was quite in spirits, as she brought her writing to his bed-side,\r\nand read her sentences to him as she composed the letter to her father,\r\nwhile he suggested and approved. It was a treat indeed to have him able\r\nto consult with her once more, and he looked so much relieved and\r\nso much better, that she felt as if it was the beginning of real\r\nimprovement, though still his pulse was fast, and the fever, though\r\nlessened, was not gone.\r\n\r\nThe letter was almost as much his as her own, and he ended his dictation\r\nthus: \xe2\x80\x98Say that I am sure that if I get better we may make arrangements\r\nfor their marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, as Amy was finishing the letter with her hopes of his amendment,\r\nhe added, speaking to her, and not dictating--\xe2\x80\x98If not,\xe2\x80\x99--she shrank and\r\nshivered, but did not exclaim, for he looked so calm and happy that she\r\ndid not like to interrupt him--\xe2\x80\x98If not, you know, it will be very easy\r\nto put the money matters to rights, whatever may happen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 34\r\n\r\n     Sir,\r\n     It is your fault I have loved Posthumus;\r\n     You bred him as my playfellow; and he is\r\n     A man worth any woman, over-buys me\r\n     Almost the sum he pays.\r\n                           --CYMBELINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first tidings of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s illness arrived at Hollywell one morning\r\nat breakfast, and were thus announced by Charles--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There! So he has been and gone and done it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What? Who? Not Guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here has the Captain gone and caught a regular bad fever, in some\r\nmalaria hole; delirious, and all that sort of thing, and of course our\r\nwise brother and sister must needs go and nurse him, by way of a pretty\r\nlittle interlude in their wedding tour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s voice alone was unheard in the chorus of inquiry. She sat cold,\r\nstiff, and silent, devouring with her ears each reply, that fell like\r\na death-blow, while she was mechanically continuing the occupations of\r\nbreakfast. When all was told, she hurried to her own room, but the want\r\nof sympathy was becoming intolerable. If Amabel had been at home, she\r\nmust have told her all. There was no one else; and the misery to\r\nbe endured in silence was dreadful. Her dearest--her whole joy and\r\nhope--suffering, dying, and to hear all round her speaking of him with\r\nkindness, indeed, but what to her seemed indifference; blaming him for\r\nwilfulness, saying he had drawn it on himself,--it seemed to drive her\r\nwild. She conjured up pictures of his sufferings, and dreaded Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninexperience, the want of medical advice, imagining everything that was\r\nterrible. Her idol, to whom her whole soul was devoted, was passing\r\nfrom her, and no one pitied her; while the latent consciousness of\r\ndisobedience debarred her from gaining solace from the only true source.\r\nAll was blank desolation--a wild agony, untempered by resignation,\r\nuncheered by prayer; for though she did pray, it was without trust,\r\nwithout hope, while her wretchedness was rendered more overwhelming by\r\nher efforts to conceal it. These were so far ineffectual that no one\r\ncould help perceiving that she was extremely unhappy, but then all the\r\nfamily knew she was very fond of Philip, and neither her mother nor\r\nbrother could be surprised at her distress, though it certainly appeared\r\nto them excessive. Mrs. Edmonstone was very sorry for her, and very\r\naffectionate and considerate; but Laura was too much absorbed, in her\r\nown feelings to perceive or to be grateful for her kindness; and as each\r\nday brought a no better report, her despair became so engrossing that\r\nshe could not attempt any employment. She wandered in the garden, sat in\r\ndreamy fits of silence in the house, and at last, after receiving one of\r\nthe worst accounts, sat up in her dressing-gown the whole of one night,\r\nin one dull, heavy, motionless trance of misery.\r\n\r\nShe recollected that she must act her part, dressed in the morning and\r\ncame down; but her looks were ghastly; she tasted no food, and as soon\r\nas possible left the breakfast-room. Her mother was going in quest\r\nof her when old nurse came with an anxious face to say,--\xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I am\r\nafraid Miss Edmonstone must be very ill, or something. Do you know,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, her bed has not been slept in all night?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so, nurse!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Jane told me so, and I went to look myself. Poor child,\r\nshe is half distracted about Master Philip, and no wonder, for they were\r\nalways together; but I thought you ought to know, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, for she will\r\nmake herself ill, to a certainty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to see about her this moment, nurse,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone;\r\nand presently she found Laura wandering up and down the shady walk, in\r\nthe restlessness of her despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, dearest,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, putting her arm round her, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot bear to\r\nsee you so unhappy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura did not answer; for though solitude was oppressive, every one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence was a burthen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot think it right to give way thus,\xe2\x80\x99 continued her mother. \xe2\x80\x98Did\r\nyou really sit up all night, my poor child?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. They did so with him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, this will never do. You are making yourself seriously unwell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish--I wish I was ill; I wish I was dying!\xe2\x80\x99 broke from Laura, almost\r\nunconsciously, in a hoarse, inward voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are saying. You forget that this\r\nself-abandonment, and extravagant grief would be wrong in any one; and,\r\nif nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura\xe2\x80\x99s over-wrought feelings could bear no more, and in a tone which,\r\nthough too vehement to be addressed to a parent, had in it an agony\r\nwhich almost excused it, by showing how unable she was to restrain\r\nherself, she broke forth:----\xe2\x80\x98Unbecoming! Who has a right to grieve for\r\nhim but me?--his own, his chosen,--the only one who can love him, or\r\nunderstand him. Her voice died away in a sob, though without tears.\r\n\r\nHer mother heard the words, but did not take in their full meaning;\r\nand, believing that Laura\xe2\x80\x99s undeveloped affection had led her to this\r\nuncontrolled grief, she spoke again, with coldness, intended to rouse\r\nher to a sense that she was compromising her womanly dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Take care, Laura; a woman has no right to speak in such a manner of a\r\nman who has given her no reason to believe in his preference of her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Preference! It is his love!--his love! His whole heart! The one thing\r\nthat was precious to me in this world! Preference! You little guess what\r\nwe have felt for each other!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 Mrs. Edmonstone stood still, overpowered. \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe could not put the question more plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have I done?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Laura. \xe2\x80\x98I have betrayed him!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered\r\nherself in a tone of despair, as she hid her face in her hands;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98betrayed him when he is dying!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer mother was too much shocked to speak in the soft reluctant manner in\r\nwhich she was wont to reprove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I must understand this. What has passed between you\r\nand Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura only replied by a flood of tears, ungovernable from the exhaustion\r\nof sleeplessness and want of food. Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s kindness returned;\r\nshe soothed her, begged her to control herself, and at length brought\r\nher into the house, and up to the dressing-room, where she sank on the\r\nsofa, weeping violently. It was the reaction of the long restraint\r\nshe had been exercising on herself, and the silence she had\r\nbeen maintaining. She was not feeling the humiliation, her own\r\nacknowledgement of disobedience, but of the horror of being forced to\r\nreveal the secret he had left in her charge.\r\n\r\nLong did she weep, breaking out more piteously at each attempt of her\r\nmother to lead her to explain. Poor Mrs. Edmonstone was alarmed and\r\nperplexed beyond measure; this half confession had so overthrown all her\r\nideas that she was ready to apprehend everything most improbable, and\r\nalmost expected to hear of a private marriage. Her presence seemed only\r\nto make Laura worse, and at length she said,--\xe2\x80\x98I shall leave you\r\nfor half an hour, in hopes that by that time you may have recovered\r\nyourself, and be able to give the explanation which I _require_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went into her own room, and waited, with her eyes on her watch, a\r\nprey to every strange alarm and anticipation, grievously hurt at this\r\nwant of confidence, and wounded, where she least expected it, by both\r\ndaughter and nephew. She thought, guessed, recollected, wondered,\r\ntormented herself, and at the last of the thirty minutes, hastily opened\r\nthe door into the dressing-room. Laura sat as before, crouched up in the\r\ncorner of the wide sofa; and when she raised her face, at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrance, it was bewildered rather than embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 She waited unanswered; and the wretchedness of the look\r\nso touched her, that, kissing her, she said, \xe2\x80\x98Surely, my dear, you need\r\nnot be afraid to tell me anything?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura did not respond to the kindness, but asked, looking perplexed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have I said? Have I told it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you have given me reason to believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, trying\r\nto bring herself to speak it explicitly, \xe2\x80\x98that you think Philip is\r\nattached to you. You do not deny it. Let me know on what terms you\r\nstand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout looking up, she murmured, \xe2\x80\x98If you would not force it from me at\r\nsuch a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, it is for your own good. You are wretched now, my poor child;\r\nwhy not relieve yourself by telling all? If you have not acted openly,\r\ncan you have any comfort till you have confessed? It may be a painful\r\neffort, but relief will come afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to confess,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98There is no such thing as you\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No engagement?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what am I to understand by your exclamations?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is no engagement,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Laura. \xe2\x80\x98He would never have asked that\r\nwithout papa\xe2\x80\x99s consent. We are only bound by our own hearts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you have a secret understanding with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have never written to each other; we have never dreamed of any\r\nintercourse that could be called clandestine. He would scorn it. He\r\nwaited only for his promotion to declare it to papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how long has it been declared to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ever since the first summer Guy was here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three years!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed her mother. \xe2\x80\x98You have kept this from me three\r\nyears! O Laura!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was of no use to speak!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, faintly.\r\n\r\nIf she had looked up, she would have seen those words, \xe2\x80\x98no use,\xe2\x80\x99 cut her\r\nmother more deeply than all; but there was only coldness in the tone\r\nof the answer, \xe2\x80\x98No use to inform your parents, before you pledged your\r\naffections!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98I was sure that you knew his worth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Worth! when he was teaching you to live in a course of insincerity?\r\nYour father will be deeply hurt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa! Oh, you must not tell him! Now, I have betrayed him, indeed! Oh,\r\nmy weakness!\xe2\x80\x99 and another paroxysm of tears came on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, you seem to think you owe nothing to any one but Philip. You\r\nforget you are a daughter! that you have been keeping up a system of\r\ndisobedience and concealment, of which I could not have believed a child\r\nof mine could be capable. O Laura, how you have abused our confidence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura was touched by the sorrow of her tone; and, throwing her arms\r\nround her neck, sobbed out, \xe2\x80\x98You will forgive me, only forgive him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was softened in a moment. \xe2\x80\x98Forgive you, my poor child!\r\nYou have been very unhappy!\xe2\x80\x99 and she kissed her, with many tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Must you tell papa?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Judge for yourself, Laura. Could I know such a thing, and hide it from\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura ceased, seeing her determined, and yielded to her pity, allowing\r\nherself to be nursed as she required, so exhausted was she. She was laid\r\non the sofa, and made comfortable with pillows, in her mother\xe2\x80\x99s gentlest\r\nway. When Mrs. Edmonstone was called away, Laura held her dress, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are kind to me, but you must forgive him. Say you have forgiven\r\nhim, mamma, dearest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, in the grave all things are forgiven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe could not help saying so; but, feeling as if she had been cruel, she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98I mean, while he is so ill, we cannot enter on such a matter. I\r\nam very sorry for you,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded she, still arranging for Laura\xe2\x80\x99s ease;\r\nthen kissing her, hoped she would sleep, and left her.\r\n\r\nSympathy was a matter of necessity to Mrs. Edmonstone; and as her\r\nhusband was out, she went at once to Charles, with a countenance so\r\ndisturbed, that he feared some worse tidings had come from Italy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, nothing of that sort; it is poor Laura.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, with a significant though anxious look, that caused\r\nher to exclaim,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Surely you had no suspicion!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte, who was reading in the window, trembled lest she should be\r\nseen, and sent away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I suspected poor Laura had parted with her heart. But what do you mean?\r\nWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could you have guessed? but first remember how ill he is; don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nviolent, Charlie. Could you have guessed that they have been engaged,\r\never since the summer we first remarked them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe had expected a great storm; but Charles only observed, very coolly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! it is come out at last!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you knew it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think they would choose me for their confidant!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, with the odd sort of laugh with\r\nwhich even the most sensitive people, in the height of their troubles,\r\nreply to anything ludicrous; \xe2\x80\x98but really,\xe2\x80\x99 she continued, \xe2\x80\x98every idea\r\nof mine is so turned upside-down, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think of\r\nanybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We always knew Laura to be his slave and automaton. He is so\r\ninfallible in her eyes, that no doubt she thought her silence an act of\r\npraiseworthy resolution.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She was a mere child, poor dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother; \xe2\x80\x98only eighteen! Yet\r\nAmy was but a year older last summer. How unlike! She must have known\r\nwhat she was doing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not with her senses surrendered to him, without volition of her own. I\r\nwonder by what magnetism he allowed her to tell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has gone through a great deal, poor child, and I am afraid there is\r\nmuch more for her to suffer, whether he recovers or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He will recover\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, with the decided manner in which people\r\nprophesy the restoration of those they dislike, probably from a feeling\r\nthat they must not die, till there is more charity in their opinion of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your father will be so grieved.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I suppose we must begin to make the best of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has been as good as married to him these four years, for any use\r\nshe has been to us; it has been only the name of the thing, so he had\r\nbetter--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear Charlie, what are you talking of? You don\xe2\x80\x99t imagine they can\r\nmarry?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They will some time or other, for assuredly neither will marry any\r\none else. You will see if Guy does not take up the cause, and return\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s meddling--which, by the bye, is now shown to have been more\r\npreposterous still--by setting their affairs in order for them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Guy, it is a comfort not to have been deceived in him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Except when you believed Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Could anything have been more different?\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Mrs. Edmonstone;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98yet the two girls had the same training.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98With an important exception,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98Laura is Philip\xe2\x80\x99s pupil,\r\nAmy mine; and I think her little ladyship is the best turned out of\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How shocked Amy will be! If she was but here, it would be much better,\r\nfor she always had more of Laura\xe2\x80\x99s confidence than I. Oh, Charlie, there\r\nhas been the error!\xe2\x80\x99 and Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were full of tears.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What fearful mistake have I made to miss my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s confidence!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not ask me, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, face and voice full of\r\naffectionate emotion. \xe2\x80\x98I know too well that I have been exacting and\r\nselfish, taking too much advantage of your anxieties for me, and that if\r\nyou were not enough with my sisters when they were young girls, it was\r\nmy fault as much as my misfortune. But, after all, it has not hurt Amy\r\nin the least; nor do I think it will hurt Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte did not venture to give way to her desire to kiss her mother,\r\nand thank Charles, lest she should be exiled as an intruder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles, serious, though somewhat roguish, \xe2\x80\x98I suspect\r\nthat no attention would have made much difference. You were always too\r\nyoung, and Laura too much addicted to the physical sciences to get on\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A weak, silly mother, sighed Mrs. Edmonstone.\r\n\r\nThis was too much for Charlotte, who sprang forward, and flung her arms\r\nround her neck, sobbing out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma! dear mamma! don\xe2\x80\x99t say such horrid things! No one is half so wise\r\nor so good,--I am sure Guy thinks so too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the same time Bustle, perceiving a commotion, made a leap, planted\r\nhis fore-feet on Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s lap, wagging his tail vehemently, and\r\ntrying to lick her face. It was not in human nature not to laugh; and\r\nMrs. Edmonstone did so as heartily as either of the young ones; indeed,\r\nCharlotte was the first to resume her gravity, not being sure of her\r\nground, and being hurt at her impulse of affection being thus reduced to\r\nthe absurd. She began to apologize,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear mamma, I could not help it. I thought you knew I wad in the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 and her mother kissed her warmly, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide\r\nanything from you. You are my only home-daughter now.\xe2\x80\x99 Then recollecting\r\nher prudence, she proceeded,--\xe2\x80\x98You are old enough to understand the\r\ndistress this insincerity of poor Laura\xe2\x80\x99s has occasioned,--and now that\r\nAmy is gone, we must look to you to comfort us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDid ever maiden of fourteen feel more honoured, and obliged to be very\r\ngood and wise than Charlotte, as she knelt by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side? Happily\r\ntact was coming with advancing years, and she did not attempt to mingle\r\nin the conversation, which was resumed by Charles observing that the\r\nstrangest part of the affair was the incompatibility of so novelish and\r\nimprudent a proceeding with the cautious, thoughtful character of\r\nboth parties. It was, he said, analogous to a pentagon flirting with a\r\nhexagon; whereas Guy, a knight of the Round Table, in name and nature,\r\nand Amy, with her little superstitions, had been attached in the most\r\nmatter-of-fact, hum-drum way, and were in a course of living very\r\nhappy ever after, for which nature could never have designed them. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone smiled, sighed, hoped they were prudent, and wondered whether\r\ncamphor and chloride of lime were attainable at Recoara.\r\n\r\nLaura came down no more that day, for she was worn out with agitation,\r\nand it was a relief to be sufficiently unwell to be excused facing her\r\nfather and Charles. She had little hope that Charlotte had not heard\r\nall; but she might seem to believe her ignorant, and could, therefore,\r\nendure her waiting on her, with an elaborate kindness and compassion,\r\nand tip-toe silence, far beyond the deserts of her slight indisposition.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Charles and his mother broke the tidings to Mr.\r\nEdmonstone as gently as they could, Charles feeling bound to be the\r\ncool, thinking head in the family. Of course Mr. Edmonstone stormed,\r\nvowed that he could not have believed it, then veered round, and said\r\nhe could have predicted it from the first. It was all mamma\xe2\x80\x99s fault\r\nfor letting him be so intimate with the girls--how was a poor lad to\r\nbe expected not to fall in love? Next he broke into great wrath at the\r\nabuse of his confidence, then at the interference with Guy, then at the\r\nintolerable presumption of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of Laura. He would soon\r\nlet him know what he thought of it! When reminded of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\ncondition, he muttered an Irish imprecation on the fever for interfering\r\nwith his anger, and abused the \xe2\x80\x98romantic folly\xe2\x80\x99 that had carried Guy to\r\nnurse him at Recoara. He was not so much displeased with Laura; in fact\r\nhe thought all young ladies always ready to be fallen in love with,\r\nand hardly accountable for what their lovers might make them do, and he\r\npitied her heartily, when he heard of her sitting up all night. Anything\r\nof extravagance in love met with sympathy from him, and there was no\r\neffort in his hearty forgiveness of her. He vowed that she should give\r\nthe fellow up, and had she been present, would have tried to make her do\r\nso at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s warning; but in process of time he was convinced that\r\nhe must not persecute her while Philip was in extremity, and though,\r\nlike Charles, he scorned the notion of his death, and, as if it was\r\nan additional crime, pronounced him to be as strong as a horse, he was\r\nquite ready to put off all proceedings till his recovery, being glad to\r\ndefer the evil day of making her cry.\r\n\r\nSo when Laura ventured out, she met with nothing harsh; indeed, but for\r\nthe sorrowful kindness of her family towards her, she could hardly have\r\nguessed that they knew her secret.\r\n\r\nHer heart leapt when Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s letter was silently handed to her, and she\r\nsaw the news of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s amendment, but a sickening feeling succeeded,\r\nthat soon all forbearance would be at an end, and he must hear that her\r\nweakness had betrayed his secret. For the present, however, nothing was\r\nsaid, and she continued in silent dread of what each day might bring\r\nforth, till one afternoon, when the letters had been fetched from\r\nBroadstone, Mrs. Edmonstone, with an exclamation of dismay, read\r\naloud:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Recoara, September 8th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAREST MAMMA,--Don\xe2\x80\x99t be very much frightened when I tell you that Guy\r\nhas caught the fever. He has been ailing since Sunday, and yesterday\r\nbecame quite ill; but we hope it will not be so severe an illness as\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s was. He sleeps a great deal, and is in no pain, quite sensible\r\nwhen he is awake. Arnaud is very useful, and so is Anne; and he is so\r\nquiet at night, that he wants no one but Arnaud, and will not let me sit\r\nup with him. Philip is better.\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Your most affectionate,\r\n                       \xe2\x80\x98A.F.M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reading was followed by a dead silence, then Mr. Edmonstone said he\r\nhad always known how it would be, and what would poor Amy do?\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was too unhappy to answer, for she could see no means of\r\nhelping them. Mr. Edmonstone was of no use in a sick-room, and she had\r\nnever thought it possible to leave Charles. It did not even occur to her\r\nthat she could do so till Charles himself suggested that she must go to\r\nAmy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can you spare me?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as if it was a new light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why not? Who can be thought of but Amy? She ought not to be a day\r\nlonger without you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dr. Mayerne would look in on you,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, considering, \xe2\x80\x98and Laura\r\ncan manage for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I shall do very well. Do you think I could bear to keep you from\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Some one must go,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, \xe2\x80\x98and even if I could think of\r\nletting Laura run the risk, this unhappy affair about Philip puts her\r\ngoing out of the question.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one but you can go, said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98it is of no use to talk of\r\nanything else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was settled that if the next account was not more favourable, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Edmonstone should set off for Recoara. Laura heard, in\r\nconsternation at the thought of her father\xe2\x80\x99s meeting Philip, still weak\r\nand unwell, without her, and perhaps with Guy too ill to be consulted.\r\nAnd oh! what would Philip think of her? Her weakness had disclosed his\r\nsecret, and sunk her beneath him, and he must hear it from others. She\r\nfelt as if she could have thrown herself at her mother\xe2\x80\x99s feet as she\r\nimplored her to forbear, to spare him, to spare her. Her mother pitied\r\nher incoherent distress, but it did not make her feel more in charity\r\nwith Philip. She would not promise that the subject should, not be\r\ndiscussed, but she tried to reassure Laura by saying that nothing should\r\nbe done that could retard his recovery.\r\n\r\nWith this Laura was obliged to content herself; and early the second\r\nmorning, after the letter arrived, she watched the departure of her\r\nfather and mother.\r\n\r\nShe had expected to find the care of Charles very anxious work, but she\r\nprospered beyond her hopes. He was very kind and considerate, and both\r\nhe and Charlotte were so sobered by anxiety, that there was no fear of\r\ntheir spirits overpowering her.\r\n\r\nMary Ross used to come almost every afternoon to inquire. One day she\r\nfound Charles alone, crutching himself slowly along the terrace, and she\r\nthought nothing showed the forlorn state of the family so much as to see\r\nhim out of doors with no one for a prop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary! Just as I wanted you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What account?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, taking the place of one of the crutches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Excellent; the fever and drowsiness seem to be going off. It must have\r\nbeen a light attack, and the elders will hardly come in time for mamma\r\nto have any nursing. So there\xe2\x80\x99s Guy pretty well off one\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And Amy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This was such a long letter, and so cheerful, that she must be all\r\nright. What I wanted to speak to you about was Laura. You know the state\r\nof things. Well, the captain--I wish he was not so sorry, it deprives\r\none of the satisfaction of abusing him--the captain, it seems, was\r\nbrought to his senses by his illness, confessed all to Guy, and now has\r\nwritten to tell the whole truth to my father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he? That is a great relief!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that I have seen his letter; Laura ran away with it, and has not\r\nsaid a word of it. I know it from one to papa from Amy, trying to make\r\nthe best of it, and telling how thoroughly he is cut up. She says he\r\nall but fainted after writing. Fancy that poor little thing with a great\r\nman, six foot one, fainting away on her hands!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought he was pretty well again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He must be to have written at all, and a pretty tolerably bitter pill\r\nit must have been to set about it. What a thing for him to have had to\r\ntell Guy, of all people--I do enjoy that! So, of course, Guy takes up\r\nhis cause, and sends a message, that is worth anything, as showing he is\r\nhimself better, though in any one else it would be a proof of delirium.\r\nMy two brothers-in-law might sit for a picture of the contrast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you think Mr. Edmonstone will consent?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure; we shall have him coming home, saying--\r\n\r\n\r\n       It is a fine thing to be father in-law\r\n       To a very magnificent three-tailed bashaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe will never hold out against Guy and Amy, and Philip will soon set up\r\na patent revolver, to be turned by the little god of love on the newest\r\nscientific principles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I turned her out to walk with Charlotte, and I want some counsel, as\r\nmamma says I know nothing of lovers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because I know so much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know feminine nature I want to know what is the best thing to\r\ndo for Laura. Poor thing! I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear to see her look so wretched,\r\nworrying herself with care of me. I have done the best I could by taking\r\nCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s lessons, and sending her out to mope alone, as she likes\r\nbest; but I wish you would tell me how to manage her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know nothing better for her than waiting on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s hard,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that having made the world dance\r\nattendance on me for my pleasure, I must now do it for theirs. But\r\nwhat do you think about telling her of this letter, or showing it,\r\nremembering that not a word about her troubles has passed between us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all means tell her. You must judge about showing it, but I should\r\nthink the opening for talking to her on the subject a great gain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should you? What, thinking as I do of the man? Should I not be between\r\nthe horns of a dilemma if I had to speak the honest truth, yet not hurt\r\nher feelings?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has been so long shut up from sympathy, that any proof of kindness\r\nmust be a comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I should like to do her some good, but it will be a mercy, if she\r\ndoes not make me fall foul of Philip! I can get up a little Christian\r\ncharity, when my father or Charlotte rave at him, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nhearing him praised. I take the opportunity of saying so while I can,\r\nfor I expect he will come home as her betrothed, and then we shall not\r\nbe able to say one word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I dare say he will be so altered and subdued that you will not be\r\nso disposed to rail. This confession is a grand thing. Good-bye I must\r\nget back to church. Poor Laura! how busy she has been about her sketch\r\nthere lately.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, she has been eager about finishing it ever since Guy began to be\r\nill. Good-bye. Wish me well through my part of confidant to-night. It\r\nis much against the grain, though I would give something to cheer up my\r\npoor sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure you would,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mary to herself, as she looked back at\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98what a quantity of kind, right feeling there in under that odd,\r\ndry manner, that strives to appear to love nothing but a joke.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs soon as Charlotte was gone to bed, Charles, in accordance with his\r\ndetermination, said to Laura,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you any fancy for seeing Amy\xe2\x80\x99s letter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you;\xe2\x80\x99 and, without speaking, Laura took it. He forbore to watch\r\nher expression as she read. When she had finished, her face was fixed in\r\nsilent unhappiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been suffering a great deal, I am sure,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, kindly.\r\nIt was the first voluntary word of compassion towards Philip that Laura\r\nhad heard, and it was as grateful as unexpected. Her face softened, and\r\ntears gushed from her eyes as she said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You do not know how much. There he is grieving for me! thinking they\r\nwill be angry with me, and hurting himself with that! Oh! if this had\r\nbut come before they set off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Guy and Amy will tell them of his having written.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear, dear Guy and Amy! He speaks so earnestly of their kindness. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t fear it so much now he and Guy understand each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRecollecting her love, Charles refrained, only saying, \xe2\x80\x98You can rely on\r\ntheir doing everything to make it better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hardly bear to think of what we owe to them,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How glad I am that Amy was there after he wrote, when he was so much\r\novercome! Amy has written me such a very kind note; I think you must see\r\nthat--it is so like her own dear self.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave it to him, and he read:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAREST,--I never could tell you before how we have grieved for you\r\never since we knew it. I am so sorry I wrote such dreadful accounts;\r\nand Guy says he wants to ask your pardon, if he ever said anything that\r\npained you about Philip. I understand all your unhappiness now, my poor\r\ndear; but it will be better now it is known. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be reserved, with\r\nCharlie, pray; for if he sees you are unhappy, he will be so very kind.\r\nI have just seen Philip again, and found him rested and better. He is\r\nonly anxious about you; but I tell him I know you will be glad it is\r\ntold.\r\n\r\n        \xe2\x80\x98Your most affectionate sister,\r\n                             \xe2\x80\x98A. F. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, finishing the letter, \xe2\x80\x98Amy gives you very good\r\nadvice, as far as I am concerned. I do want to be of as much use to you\r\nas I can--I mean as kind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know--I know; thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, struggling with her tears. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nhave been--you are; but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I see, she won\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied, if my kindness\r\nincludes her alone. What will my honesty let me say to please her? Oh! I\r\nknow.--You must not expect me to say that Philip has, behaved properly,\r\nLaura, nothing but being in love could justify such a delusion; but I do\r\nsay that there is greatness of mind in his confessing it, especially at\r\na time when he could put it off, and is so unequal to agitation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was the absence of any tone of satire that made this speech come home\r\nto Laura as it was meant. There was no grudging in the praise, and she\r\nanswered, in a very low, broken voice,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will think so still more when you see this note, which he sent\r\nopen, inside mine, to be given to papa when I had told my own story. Oh,\r\nhis considerateness for me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave it to him. The address, \xe2\x80\x98C. Edmonstone, Esq.,\xe2\x80\x99 was a mere\r\nscrawl, and within the writing was very trembling and weak. Charles\r\nremarked it, and she answered by saying that her own letter began in\r\nhis own strong hand, but failed and grew shaky at the end, as if from\r\nfatigue and agitation. The words were few, brief, and simple, very\r\nunlike his usual manner of letter-writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR UNCLE,--My conduct has been unjustifiable--I feel it. Do not\r\nvisit it on Laura--I alone should suffer. I entreat your pardon, and my\r\naunt\xe2\x80\x99s, and leave all to you. I will write more at length. Be kind to\r\nher.--Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98PH. M.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Philip!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, really very much touched. From that moment,\r\nLaura no longer felt completely isolated, and deprived of sympathy. She\r\nsat by Charles till late that night, and told him the whole history\r\nof her engagement, much relieved by the outpouring of her long-hidden\r\ngriefs, and comforted by his kindness, though he could not absolutely\r\nrefrain from words and gestures of censure. It was as strange that\r\nCharles should be the first person to whom Laura told this history, as\r\nthat Guy should have been Philip\xe2\x80\x99s first confidant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 35\r\n\r\n     There is a Rock, and nigh at hand,\r\n     A shadow in a weary land,\r\n     Who in that stricken Rock hath rest,\r\n     Finds water gushing from its breast.\r\n                                  --NEALE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the days passed at Recoara without much change for the\r\nbetter or worse. After the first week, Guy\xe2\x80\x99s fever had diminished; his\r\npulse was lower, the drowsiness ceased, and it seemed as if there was\r\nnothing to prevent absolute recovery. But though each morning seemed to\r\nbring improvement, it never lasted; the fever, though not high, could\r\nnever be entirely reduced, and strength was perceptibly wasting, in\r\nspite of every means of keeping it up.\r\n\r\nThere was not much positive suffering, very little even of headache,\r\nand he was cheerful, though speaking little, because he was told not to\r\nexcite or exhaust himself. Languor and lassitude were the chief causes\r\nof discomfort; and as his strength failed, there came fits of exhaustion\r\nand oppression that tried him severely. At first, these were easily\r\nremoved by stimulants; but remedies seemed to lose their effect, and the\r\nsinking was almost death-like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I could bear acute pain better!\xe2\x80\x99 he said one day; and more than\r\nonce the sigh broke from him almost unconsciously,--\xe2\x80\x98Oh for one breath\r\nof Redclyffe sea-wind!\xe2\x80\x99 Indeed, it seemed as if the close air of the\r\nshut-in-valley, at the end of a long hot day was almost enough to\r\noverwhelm him, weak as he had become. Every morning, when Amabel let in\r\nthe fresh breeze at the window, she predicted it would be a cool day,\r\nand do him good; every afternoon the wind abated, the sun shone full\r\nin, the room was stifling, the faintness came on, and after a few vain\r\nattempts at relieving it, Guy sighed that there was nothing for it but\r\nquiet, and Amy was obliged to acquiesce. As the sun set, the breeze\r\nsprung up, it became cooler, he fell asleep, awoke revived, was\r\ncomfortable all the evening, and Amy left him at eleven or twelve, with\r\nhopes of his having a good night.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her as if ages had passed in this way, when one evening two\r\nletters were brought in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98and this one,\xe2\x80\x99 holding it up, \xe2\x80\x98is for you. It\r\nmust have been hunting us everywhere. How many different directions!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98From Markham,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98It must be the letter we were waiting for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe letter to tell them Redclyffe was ready to receive them! Amabel put\r\nit down with a strange sensation, and opened her mother\xe2\x80\x99s. With a start\r\nof joy she exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are coming--mamma and papa!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then all is right!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If we do not receive a much better account,\xe2\x80\x99 read Amy, \xe2\x80\x98we shall set\r\noff early on Wednesday, and hope to be with you not long after you\r\nreceive this letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh I am so glad! I wonder how Charlie gets on without her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a great comfort,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you will see what a nurse mamma is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now you will be properly cared for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How nice it will be! She will take care of you all night, and never\r\nbe tired, and devise everything I am too stupid for, and make you so\r\ncomfortable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, no one could do that better than you, Amy. But it is joy\r\nindeed--to see mamma again--to know you are safe with her. Everything\r\ncomes to make it easy!\xe2\x80\x99 The last words were spoken very low; and she did\r\nnot disturb him by saying anything till he asked about the rest of the\r\nletter, and desired her to read Markham\xe2\x80\x99s to him.\r\n\r\nThis cost her some pain, for it had been written in ignorance of\r\neven Philip\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and detailed triumphantly the preparations at\r\nRedclyffe, hinting that they must send timely notice of their return,\r\nor they would disappoint the tenantry, who intended grand doings, and\r\nconcluding with a short lecture on the inexpediency of lingering in\r\nforeign parts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Markham,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy.\r\n\r\nShe understood; but these things did not come on her like a shock now,\r\nfor he had been saying them more or less ever since the beginning of his\r\nillness; and fully occupied as she was, she never opened her mind to the\r\nfuture. After a long silence, Guy said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for him. I have been making Arnaud write to him for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, have you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was better for you not to do it, Arnaud has written for me at night.\r\nYou will send it, Amy, and another to my poor uncle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as he looked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have told Markham,\xe2\x80\x99 said he presently, \xe2\x80\x98to send you my desk. There\r\nare all sorts of things in it, just as I threw them in when I cleared\r\nout my rooms at Oxford. I had rather nobody but you saw some of them.\r\nThere is nothing of any importance, so you may look at them when you\r\nplease, or not at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him without answering. If there had been any struggle\r\nto retain him, it would have been repressed by his calmness; but the\r\nthought had not come on her suddenly, it was more like an inevitable\r\nfate seen at first at a distance, and gradually advancing upon her. She\r\nhad never fastened on the hope of his recovery, and it had dwindled in\r\nan almost imperceptible manner. She kept watch over him, and followed\r\nhis thoughts, without stretching her mind to suppose herself living\r\nwithout him; and was supported by the forgetfulness of self, which gave\r\nher no time to realize her feelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to have seen Redclyffe bay again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, after a\r\nspace. \xe2\x80\x98Now that mamma is coming, that is the one thing. I suppose I had\r\nset my heart on it, for it comes back to me how I reckoned on standing\r\non that rock with you, feeling the wind, hearing the surge, looking\r\nat the meeting of earth and sky, and the train of sunlight.\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke\r\nslowly, pausing between each recollection,--\xe2\x80\x98You will see it some day,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe added. \xe2\x80\x98But I must give it up; it is earth after all, and looking\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThrough the evening, he seemed to be dwelling on thoughts of his own,\r\nand only spoke to tell her of some message to friends at Redclyffe, or\r\nHollywell, to mention little Marianne Dixon, or some other charge that\r\nhe wished to leave. She thought he had mentioned almost every one with\r\nwhom he had had any interchange of kindness at either of his homes, even\r\nto old nurse at Hollywell, remembering them all with quiet pleasure. At\r\nhalf-past eleven, he sent her to bed, and she went submissively, cheered\r\nby thinking him likely to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could conscientiously call the night over, she returned\r\nto him, and was received with one of the sweet, sunny, happy looks\r\nthat had always been his peculiar charm, and, of late, had acquired an\r\nexpression almost startling from their very beauty and radiance. It was\r\nhardly to be termed a smile, for there was very little, if any, movement\r\nof the lips, it was more like the reflection of some glory upon the\r\nwhole countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had a good night?\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have had my wish, I have seen Redclyffe;\xe2\x80\x99 then, seeing her look\r\nstartled, \xe2\x80\x98Of course, it was a sort of wandering; but I never quite lost\r\nthe consciousness of being here, and it was very delightful. I saw the\r\nwaves, each touched with light,--the foam--the sea-birds, floating in\r\nshade and light,--the trees--the Shag--the sky--oh! such a glory as I\r\nnever knew--themselves--but so intensely glorious!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, with a strange participation of the delight it\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand such goodness!\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98As if it were not\r\nenough to look to heaven beyond, to have this longing gratified, which I\r\nthought I ought to conquer. Oh, Amy! is not that being Fatherly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, indeed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now after that, and with mamma\xe2\x80\x99s coming (for you will have her if I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see her), I have but one wish unfulfilled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! a clergyman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, but if that is withheld, I must believe it is rightly ordered. We\r\nmust think of that Sunday at Stylehurst and Christmas-day, and that last\r\ntime at Munich.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am so glad we stayed at Munich for that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those were times, indeed! and many more. Yes; I have been a great deal\r\ntoo much favoured already, and now to be allowed to die just as I should\r\nhave chosen--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe broke off to take what Amabel was preparing for him, and she felt\r\nhis pulse. There was fever still, which probably supplied the place\r\nof strength, for he said he was very comfortable, and his eyes were as\r\nbright as ever; but the beats were weak and fluttering, and a thrill\r\ncrossed her that it might be near; but she must attend to him, and could\r\nnot think.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time for her to go down to breakfast with Philip, Guy said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think Philip could come to me to-day? I want much to speak to\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure he could.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then pray ask him to come, if it will not tire him very much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip had, the last two mornings, risen in time to breakfast with\r\nAmabel, in the room adjoining his own; he was still very weak, and\r\nattempted no more than crossing the room, and sitting in the balcony to\r\nenjoy the evening air. He had felt the heat of the weather severely, and\r\nhad been a good deal thrown back by his fatigue and agitation the day he\r\nwrote the letter, while also anxiety for Guy was retarding his progress,\r\nthough he only heard the best side of his condition. Besides all this,\r\nhis repentance both for his conduct with regard to Laura and the hard\r\nmeasure he had dealt to Guy was pressing on him increasingly; and the\r\nwarm feelings, hardened and soured by early disappointment, regained\r\ntheir force, and grew into a love and admiration that made it still more\r\nhorrible to perceive that he had acted ungenerously towards his cousin.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s desire to see him, he was pleased, said he was\r\nquite able to walk up-stairs, had been thinking of offering to help her\r\nby sitting with him, and was very glad to hear he was well enough to\r\nwish for a visit. She saw she must prepare him for what the conversation\r\nwas likely to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is very anxious to see you,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98He is wishing to set all in\r\norder. And if he does speak about--about dying, will you be so kind as\r\nnot to contradict him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no danger?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Philip, startling, with a sort of agony. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nis no worse? You said the fever was lower.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is rather better, I think; but he wishes so much to have everything\r\narranged, that I am sure it will be better for him to have it off\r\nhis mind. So, will you bear it, please, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99 ended she, with an\r\nimploring look, that reminded him of her childhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How do you bear it?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know--I can\xe2\x80\x99t vex him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip said no more, and only asked when he should come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, perhaps, or whenever he was ready,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98for\r\nhe could rest in the sitting-room before coming in to Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe found mounting the stairs harder than he had expected, and, with\r\naching knees and gasping breath, at length reached the sitting-room,\r\nwhere Amabel was ready to pity him, and made him rest on the sofa till\r\nhe had fully recovered. She then conducted him in; and his first glance\r\ngave him infinite relief, for he saw far less change than was still\r\napparent in himself. Guy\xe2\x80\x99s face was at all times too thin to be capable\r\nof losing much of its form, and as he was liable to be very much tanned,\r\nthe brown, fixed on his face by the sunshine of his journey had not gone\r\noff, and a slight flush on his cheeks gave him his ordinary colouring;\r\nhis beautiful hazel eyes were more brilliant than ever; and though the\r\nhand he held out was hot and wasted, Philip could not think him nearly\r\nas ill as he had been himself, and was ready to let him talk as he\r\npleased. He was reassured, too, by his bright smile, and the strength\r\nof his voice, as he spoke a few playful words of welcome and\r\ncongratulation. Amy set a chair, and with a look to remind Philip to be\r\ncautious, glided into her own room, leaving the door open, so as to see\r\nand hear all that passed, for they were not fit to be left absolutely\r\nalone together.\r\n\r\nPhilip sat down; and after a little pause Guy began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There were a few things I wanted to say, in case you should be my\r\nsuccessor at Redclyffe.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA horror came over Philip; but he saw Amy writing at her little table,\r\nand felt obliged to refrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think of directing you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy, \xe2\x80\x98You will make a far better\r\nlandlord than I; but one or two things I should like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything you wish!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Markham. He has old-world notions and prejudices, but his soul is\r\nin the family and estate. His heart will be half broken, for me, and if\r\nhe loses his occupation, he will be miserable. Will you bear with him,\r\nand be patient while he lives, even if he is cross and absurd in his\r\nobjections, and jealous of all that is not me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes--if--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you. Then there is Coombe Prior. I took Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s pay on myself.\r\nWill you? And I should like him to have the living. Then there is the\r\nschool to be built; and I thought of enclosing that bit of waste, to\r\nmake gardens for the people; but that you\xe2\x80\x99ll do much better. Well;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember when you were at Redclyffe last year\xe2\x80\x99 (Philip winced)\r\n\xe2\x80\x98telling Markham that bit of green by Sally\xe2\x80\x99s gate ought to be taken\r\ninto the park? I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t do that, for it is the only place the\r\npeople have to turn out their cows and donkeys. And you won\xe2\x80\x99t cut them\r\noff from the steps from the Cove, for it saves the old people from being\r\nlate for church? Thank you. As to the rest, it is pleasant to think it\r\nwill be in such hands if--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat \xe2\x80\x98if\xe2\x80\x99 gave Philip some comfort, though it did not mean what he\r\nfancied. He thought of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s recovery; Guy referred to the possibility\r\nof Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s guardianship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy has a list of the old people who have had so much a week, or their\r\ncottages rent-free,\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98If it comes to you, you will not let\r\nthem feel the difference? And don\xe2\x80\x99t turn off the old keeper Brown; he is\r\nof no use, but it would kill him. And Ben Robinson, who was so brave\r\nin the shipwreck, a little notice now and then would keep him straight.\r\nWill you tell him I hope he will never forget that morning-service after\r\nthe wreck? He may be glad to think of it when he is as I am now. You\r\ntell him, for he will mind more what comes from a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll this had been spoken with pauses for recollection, and for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsigns of assent. Amabel came to give him some cordial; and as soon as\r\nshe had retreated he went on:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My poor uncle; I have written--that is, caused Arnaud to write to him.\r\nI hope this may sober him; but one great favour I have to ask of you. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t leave him money, it would only be a temptation; but will you keep\r\nan eye on him, and let Amy rely on you to tell her when to help him I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t ask any one else, and she cannot do it for herself; but you would\r\ndo it well. A little kindness might save him; and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\ngenerous a character it is, run to waste. Will you undertake this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure I will!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you very much. You will judge rightly; but he has delicate\r\nfeelings. Yes, really; and take care you don\xe2\x80\x99t run against them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnother silence followed; after which Guy said, smiling with his natural\r\nplayfulness, \xe2\x80\x98One thing more. You are the lawyer of the family, and I\r\nwant a legal opinion. I have been making Arnaud write my will. I\r\nhave wished Miss Wellwood of St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s to have some money for a\r\nsisterhood she wants to establish. Now, should I leave it to herself or\r\nname trustees?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip heard as if a flash of light was blinding him, and he\r\ninterrupted, with an exclamation:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me one thing! Was that the thousand pounds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. I was not at liberty to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe stopped, for he was unheard. At the first word Philip had sunk on\r\nhis knees, hiding his face on the bed-clothes, in an agony of\r\nself-abasement, before the goodness he had been relentlessly\r\npersecuting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was that?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a sort of stifled sob. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, can you forgive\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe could not look up; but he felt Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hand touch his head, and heard\r\nhim say, \xe2\x80\x98That was done long ago. Even as you pardoned my fierce rage\r\nagainst you, which I trust is forgiven above. It has been repented!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a knock at the door, and, with the instinctive\r\ndread of being found in his present posture, Philip sprang to his feet.\r\nAmabel went to the door, and was told that the physician was down-stairs\r\nwith two gentlemen; and a card was given her, on which she read the name\r\nof an English clergyman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, again!\xe2\x80\x99 said Guy. \xe2\x80\x98Everything comes to me. Now it is all quite\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel was to go and speak to them, and Guy would see Mr. Morris, the\r\nclergyman, as soon as the physician had made his visit. \xe2\x80\x98You must not go\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x99 he then said to Philip. \xe2\x80\x98You will wait in the sitting-room, won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou? We shall want you again, you know,\xe2\x80\x99 and his calm brightness was a\r\ncontrast to Philip\xe2\x80\x99s troubled look. \xe2\x80\x98All is clear between us now,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded, as Philip turned away.\r\n\r\nLong ago, letters had been written to Venice, begging that if an English\r\nclergyman should travel that way he might be told how earnestly his\r\npresence was requested; this was the first who had answered the summons.\r\nHe was a very young man, much out of health, and travelling under the\r\ncare of a brother, who was in great dread of his doing anything\r\nto injure himself. Amabel soon perceived that, though kind and\r\nright-minded, he could not help them, except as far as his office was\r\nconcerned. He was very shy, only just in priest\xe2\x80\x99s orders; he told her he\r\nhad never had this office to perform before, and seemed almost to expect\r\nher to direct him; while his brother was so afraid of his over-exerting\r\nhimself, that she could not hope he would take charge of Philip.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the physician had seen Guy, she brought Mr. Morris to\r\nhim, and came forward, or remained in her room, according as she was\r\nwanted. She thought her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face was at each moment acquiring more\r\nunearthly beauty, and feeling with him, she was raised above thought or\r\nsensation of personal sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen the first part of the service was over, and she exchanged a few\r\nwords, out of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hearing, with Mr. Morris, he said to her, as from\r\nthe very fullness of his heart, \xe2\x80\x98One longs to humble oneself to him. How\r\nit puts one to shame to hear such repentance with such a confession!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe time came when Philip was wanted. Amabel had called in Anne and the\r\nclergyman\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and went to fetch her cousin. He was where she had\r\nleft him in the sitting-room, his face hidden in his arms, crossed on\r\nthe table, the whole man crushed, bowed down, overwhelmed with remorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are ready. Come, Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot; I am not worthy,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, not looking up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, you are surely in no uncharitableness with him now,\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\ngently.\r\n\r\nA shudder expressed his no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And if you are sorry--that is repentance--more fit now than ever--Won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou come? Would you grieve him now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You take it on yourself, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, almost sharply, raising\r\nhis haggard face.\r\n\r\nShe did not shrink, and answered, \xe2\x80\x98A broken and contrite heart, O God,\r\nThou wilt not despise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a drop of balm, a softening drop. He rose, and trembling from\r\nhead to foot, from the excess of his agitation, followed her into Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe rite was over, and stillness succeeded the low tones, while all\r\nknelt in their places. Amabel arose first, for Guy, though serene,\r\nlooked greatly exhausted, and as she sprinkled him with vinegar, the\r\nothers stood up. Guy looked for Philip, and held out his hand. Whether\r\nit was his gentle force, or of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s own accord Amabel could not\r\ntell; but as he lay with that look of perfect peace and love, Philip\r\nbent down over him and kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you!\xe2\x80\x99 he faintly whispered. \xe2\x80\x98Good night. God bless you and my\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip went, and he added to Amy, \xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow! It will be worse for him\r\nthan for you. You must take care of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe hardly heard the last words, for his head sunk on one side in a\r\ndeathlike faintness, the room was cleared of all but herself, and Anne\r\nfetched the physician at once.\r\n\r\nAt length it passed off, and Guy slept. The doctor felt his pulse, and\r\nshe asked his opinion of it. Very low and unequal, she was told: his\r\nstrength was failing, and there seemed to be no power of rallying it,\r\nbut they must do their best to support him with cordials, according\r\nto the state of his pulse. The physician could not remain all night\r\nhimself, but would come as soon as he could on the following day.\r\n\r\nAmabel hardly knew when it was that he went away; the two Mr. Morrises\r\nwent to the other hotel; and she made her evening visit to Philip. It\r\nwas all like a dream, which she could afterwards scarcely remember, till\r\nnight had come on, and for the first time she found herself allowed to\r\nkeep watch over her husband.\r\n\r\nHe had slept quietly for some time, when she roused him to give him some\r\nwine, as she was desired to do constantly. He smiled, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Is no\r\none here but you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My own sweet wife, my Verena, as you have always been. We have been\r\nvery happy together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed we have,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, a look of suffering crossing her face, as\r\nshe thought of their unclouded happiness. \xe2\x80\x98It will not be so long before\r\nwe meet again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A few months, perhaps\xe2\x80\x99--said Amabel, in a stifled voice, \xe2\x80\x98like your\r\nmother--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, don\xe2\x80\x99t wish that, Amy. You would not wish it to have no mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will pray--\xe2\x80\x99 She could say no more, but struggled for calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98I trust you to it and to mamma for comfort. And\r\nCharlie--I shall not rob him any longer. I only borrowed you for a\r\nlittle while,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, smiling. \xe2\x80\x98In a little while we shall meet.\r\nYears and months seem alike now. I am sorry to cause you so much grief,\r\nmy Amy, but it is all as it should be, and we have been very happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy listened, her eyes intently fixed on him, unable to repress her\r\nagitation, except by silence. After some little time, he spoke again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My love to Charlie--and Laura--and Charlotte, my brother and sisters.\r\nHow kindly they have made me one of them! I need not ask Charlotte to\r\ntake care of Bustle, and your father will ride Deloraine. My love to\r\nhim, and earnest thanks, for you above all, Amy. And dear mamma! I must\r\nlook now to meeting her in a brighter world; but tell her how I have\r\nfelt all her kindness since I first came in my strangeness and grief.\r\nHow kind she was! how she helped me and led me, and made me know what\r\na mother was. Amy, it will not hurt you to hear it was your likeness to\r\nher that first taught me to love you. I have been so very happy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was again silent, as in contemplation, and Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s overcoming\r\nemotion had been calmed and chastened down again, now that it was no\r\nlonger herself that was spoken of. Both were still, and he seemed to\r\nsleep a little. When next he spoke, it was to ask if she could repeat\r\ntheir old favourite lines in \xe2\x80\x9cSintram\xe2\x80\x9d. They came to her lips, and she\r\nrepeated them in a low, steady voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n       When death, is coming near,\r\n       And thy heart shrinks in fear,\r\n           And thy limbs fail,\r\n       Then raise thy hands and pray\r\n       To Him who smooths the way\r\n           Through the dark vale.\r\n\r\n       Seest thou the eastern dawn!\r\n       Hear\xe2\x80\x99st thou, in the red morn,\r\n           The angel\xe2\x80\x99s song?\r\n       Oh! lift thy drooping head,\r\n       Thou, who in gloom and dread\r\n           Hast lain so long.\r\n\r\n       Death comes to set thee free,\r\n       Oh! meet him cheerily,\r\n           As thy true friend\r\n       And all thy fears shall cease,\r\n       And In eternal peace\r\n           Thy penance end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In eternal peace,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Guy; \xe2\x80\x98I did not think it would have been so\r\nsoon. I can\xe2\x80\x99t think where the battle has been. I never thought my life\r\ncould be so bright. It was a foolish longing, when first I was ill, for\r\nthe cool waves of Redclyffe bay and that shipwreck excitement, if I was\r\nto die. This is far better. Read me a psalm, Amy, \xe2\x80\x9cOut of the deep.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was something in his perfect happiness that would not let her\r\ngrieve, though a dull heavy sense of consternation was growing on her.\r\nSo it went on through the night--not a long, nor a dreary one--but more\r\nlike a dream. He dozed and woke, said a few tranquil words, and listened\r\nto some prayer, psalm, or verse, then slept again, apparently without\r\nsuffering, except when he tried to take the cordials, and this he did\r\nwith such increasing difficulty, that she hardly knew how to bear to\r\ncause him so much pain, though it was the last lingering hope. He strove\r\nto swallow them, each time with the mechanical \xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 so affecting\r\nwhen thus spoken; but at last he came to, \xe2\x80\x98It is of no use; I cannot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she knew all hope was gone, and sat still, watching him. The\r\ndarkness lessened, and twilight came. He slept, but his breath grew\r\nshort, and unequal; and as she wiped the moisture on his brow, she knew\r\nit was the death-damp.\r\n\r\nMorning light came on--the church bell rang out matins--the white hills\r\nwere tipped with rosy light. His pulse was almost gone--his hand was\r\ncold. At last he opened his eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Amy! he said, as if bewildered, or in\r\npain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, dearest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sun was rising, and the light streamed in at the open\r\nwindow, and over the bed; but it was \xe2\x80\x9canother dawn than ours\xe2\x80\x9d that he\r\nbeheld as his most beautiful of all smiles beamed over his face, and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Glory in the Highest!--peace--goodwill\xe2\x80\x99--A struggle for breath\r\ngave an instant\xe2\x80\x99s look of pain, then he whispered so that she could but\r\njust hear--\xe2\x80\x98The last prayer.\xe2\x80\x99 She read the Commendatory Prayer. She knew\r\nnot the exact moment, but even as she said \xe2\x80\x98Amen\xe2\x80\x99 she perceived it was\r\nover. The soul was with Him with whom dwell the spirits of just men made\r\nperfect; and there lay the earthly part with a smile on the face. She\r\nclosed the dark fringed eyelids--saw him look more beautiful than in\r\nsleep--then, laying her face down on the bed, she knelt on. She took no\r\nheed of time, no heed of aught that was earthly. How long she knelt she\r\nnever knew, but she was roused by Anne\xe2\x80\x99s voice in a frightened sob--\xe2\x80\x98My\r\nlady, my lady--come away! Oh, Miss Amabel, you should not be here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe lifted her head, and Anne afterwards told Mary Ross, \xe2\x80\x98she should\r\nnever forget how my lady looked. It was not grief: it was as if she had\r\nbeen a little way with her husband, and was just called back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe rose--looked at his face again--saw Arnaud was at hand--let Anne\r\nlead her into the next room, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 36\r\n\r\n     The matron who alone has stood\r\n     When not a prop seemed left below,\r\n     The first lorn hour of widowhood,\r\n     Yet, cheered and cheering all the while,\r\n     With sad but unaffected, smile.\r\n                          --CHRISTIAN YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe four months\xe2\x80\x99 wife was a widow before she was twenty-one, and\r\nthere she sat in her loneliness, her maid weeping, seeking in vain for\r\nsomething to say that might comfort her, and struck with fear at seeing\r\nher thus composed. It might be said that she had not yet realized her\r\nsituation, but the truth was, perhaps, that she was in the midst of the\r\ntrue realities. She felt that her Guy was perfectly happy--happy beyond\r\nthought or comparison--and she was so accustomed to rejoice with him,\r\nthat her mind had not yet opened to understand that his joy left her\r\nmourning and desolate.\r\n\r\nThus she remained motionless for some minutes, till she was startled by\r\na sound of weeping--those fearful overpowering sobs, so terrible in a\r\nstrong man forced to give way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip!\xe2\x80\x99 thought she; and withal Guy\xe2\x80\x99s words returned--\xe2\x80\x98It will be\r\nworse for him than for you. Take care of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said she at once.\r\n\r\nShe took up a purple prayer-book that she had unconsciously brought\r\nin her hand from Guy\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and walked down-stairs, without pausing to\r\nthink what she should say or do, or remembering how she would naturally\r\nhave shrunk from the sight of violent grief.\r\n\r\nPhilip had retired to his own room the night before, overwhelmed by\r\nthe first full view of the extent of the injuries he had inflicted, the\r\nfirst perception that pride and malevolence had been the true source of\r\nhis prejudice and misconceptions, and for the first time conscious of\r\nthe long-fostered conceit that had been his bane from boyhood. All had\r\nflashed on him with the discovery of the true purpose of the demand\r\nwhich he thought had justified his persecution. He saw the glory\r\nof Guy\xe2\x80\x99s character and the part he had acted,--the scales of\r\nself-admiration fell from his eyes, and he knew both himself and his\r\ncousin.\r\n\r\nHis sole comfort was in hope for the future, and in devising how his\r\nbrotherly affection should for the rest of his life testify his altered\r\nmind, and atone for past ill-will. This alone kept him from being\r\ncompletely crushed,--for he by no means imagined how near the end was,\r\nand the physician, willing to spare himself pain, left him in hopes,\r\nthough knowing how it would be. He slept but little, and was very\r\nlanguid in the morning; but he rose as soon as Arnaud came to him, in\r\norder not to occupy Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s time, as well as to be ready in case Guy\r\nshould send for him again, auguring well from hearing that there was\r\nnothing stirring above, hoping this was a sign that Guy was asleep. So\r\nhoped the two servants for a long time, but at length, growing alarmed,\r\nafter many consultations, they resolved to knock at the door, and learn\r\nwhat was the state of things.\r\n\r\nPhilip likewise was full of anxiety, and coming to his room door to\r\nlisten for intelligence, it was the \xe2\x80\x9ce morto\xe2\x80\x9d of the passing Italians\r\nthat first revealed to him the truth. Guy dead, Amy widowed, himself\r\nthe cause--he who had said he would never be answerable for the death of\r\nthis young man.\r\n\r\nTruly had Guy\xe2\x80\x99s threat, that he would make him repent, been fulfilled.\r\nHe tottered back to his couch, and sank down, in a burst of anguish\r\nthat swept away all the self-control that had once been his pride. There\r\nAmabel found him stretched, face downwards, quivering and convulsed by\r\nfrightful sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t--don\xe2\x80\x99t, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in her gentle voice. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry so\r\nterribly!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout looking up, he made a gesture with his hand, as if to drive her\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t come here to reproach me!\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no; don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so. I want you to hear me; I have something for\r\nyou from him. If you would only listen, I want to tell you how happy and\r\ncomfortable it was.\xe2\x80\x99 She took a chair and sat down by him, relieved on\r\nperceiving that the sobs grew a little less violent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was very peaceful, very happy,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated she. \xe2\x80\x98We ought to be very\r\nglad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe turned round, and glanced at her for a moment; but he could not bear\r\nto see her quiet face. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you say,\xe2\x80\x99 he gasped. \xe2\x80\x98No;\r\ntake care of yourself, don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself for such as me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must; he desired me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98You will be happier, indeed,\r\nPhilip, if you would only think what glory it is, and that he is all\r\nsafe, and has won the victory, and will have no more of those hard,\r\nhard struggles, and bitter repentance. It has been such a night, that it\r\nseems wrong to be sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you say he spoke of me again?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; here is his Prayer-book. Your father gave it to him, and he meant\r\nto have told you about it himself, only he could not talk yesterday\r\nevening, and could not part with it till--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy broke off by opening the worn purple cover, and showing the name, in\r\nthe Archdeacon\xe2\x80\x99s writing. \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s very fond of it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98it is the\r\none he always uses.\xe2\x80\x99 (Alas! she had not learnt to speak of him in the\r\npast tense.)\r\n\r\nPhilip held out his hand, but the agony of grief returned the next\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x98My father, my father! He would have done him justice. If he had\r\nlived, this would never have been!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is over, you do him justice now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98You did, indeed you\r\ndid, make him quite happy. He said so, again and again. I never saw him\r\nso happy as when you began to get better. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one ever had\r\nso much happiness and it never ceased, it was all quiet, and peace, and\r\njoy, till it brightened quite into perfect day--and the angel\xe2\x80\x99s song!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember yesterday, how clear and sweet his voice came out in\r\nthat? and it was the last thing almost he said. I believe\xe2\x80\x99--she lowered\r\nher voice--\xe2\x80\x98I believe he finished it among them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe earnest placid voice, speaking thus, in calmness and simplicity,\r\ncould not fail in soothing him; but he was so shaken and exhausted,\r\nthat she had great difficulty in restoring him. After a time, he lay\r\nperfectly still on the sofa, and she was sitting by, relieved by the\r\ntranquillity, when there was a knock at the door, and Arnaud came in,\r\nand stood hesitating, as if he hardly knew how to begin. The present\r\nfear of agitating her charge helped her now, when obliged to turn her\r\nthoughts to the subjects on which she knew Arnaud was come. She went to\r\nthe door, and spoke low, hoping her cousin might not hear or understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How soon must it be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My lady, to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Arnaud, looking down. \xe2\x80\x98They say that so it\r\nmust be; and the priest consents to have it in the churchyard here. The\r\nbrother of the clergyman is here, and would know if your ladyship would\r\nwish--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will speak to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, reluctant to send such messages\r\nthrough servants.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, who understood what was going on, and was of\r\ncourse impelled to spare her as much as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98if you are able!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes; I\xe2\x80\x99ll go at once!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stop,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as he was setting forth; \xe2\x80\x98you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you are\r\ngoing to say.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe put his hand to his head in confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He wished to be buried here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, \xe2\x80\x98and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut this renewal of the assurance of the death was too much; and\r\ncovering his face with his hands, he sank back in another paroxysm of\r\nviolent sobs. Amabel could not leave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ask Mr. Morris to be so good as to wait, and I will come directly,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she, then returned to her task of comfort till she again saw Philip\r\nlying, with suspended faculties, in the repose of complete exhaustion.\r\n\r\nShe then went to Mr. Morris, with a look and tone of composure\r\nthat almost startled him, thanking him for his assistance in the\r\narrangements. The funeral was to be at sunrise the next day, before the\r\nvillagers began to keep the feast of St. Michael, and the rest was to\r\nbe settled by Arnaud and Mr. Morris. He then said, somewhat reluctantly,\r\nthat his brother had desired to know whether Lady Morville wished to see\r\nhim to-day, and begged to be sent for; but Amy plainly perceived that\r\nhe thought it very undesirable for his brother to have any duties to\r\nperform to-day. She questioned herself whether she might not ask him to\r\nread to her, and whether it might be better for Philip; but she thought\r\nshe ought not to ask what might injure him merely for her own comfort;\r\nand, besides, Philip was entirely incapable of self-command, and it\r\nwould not be acting fairly to expose him to the chance of discovering to\r\na stranger, feelings that he would ordinarily guard so scrupulously.\r\n\r\nShe therefore gratefully refused the offer, and Mr. Morris very nearly\r\nthanked her for doing so. He took his leave, and she knew she must\r\nreturn to her post; but first she indulged herself with one brief visit\r\nto the room where all her cares and duties had lately centred. A look--a\r\nthought--a prayer. The beauteous expression there fixed was a help, as\r\nit had ever been in life and she went back again cheered and sustained.\r\n\r\nThroughout that day she attended on her cousin, whose bodily\r\nindisposition required as much care as his mind needed soothing. She\r\ntalked to him, read to him, tried to set him the example of taking food,\r\ntook thought for him as if he was the chief sufferer, as if it was the\r\nnatural thing for her to do, working in the strength her husband had\r\nleft her, and for him who had been his chief object of care. She had no\r\ntime to herself, except the few moments that she allowed herself now and\r\nthen to spend in gazing at the dear face that was still her comfort\r\nand joy; until, at last, late in the evening, she succeeded in reading\r\nPhilip to sleep. Then, as she sat in the dim candle-light, with\r\neverything in silence, a sense of desolation came upon her, and she knew\r\nthat she was alone.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a carriage thundered at the door, and she remembered for\r\nthe first time that she was expecting her father and mother. She softly\r\nleft the room and closed the door; and finding Anne in the nest room,\r\nsent her down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Meet mamma, Anne,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98tell her I am quite well. Bring them\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey entered; and there stood Amabel, her face a little flushed, just\r\nlike, only calmer, the daughter they had parted with on her bridal day,\r\nfour months ago. She held up her hand as a sign of silence, and said,--\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! don\xe2\x80\x99t wake Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone was almost angry, and actually began an impatient\r\nexclamation, but broke it off with a sob, caught her in his arms, kissed\r\nher, and then buried his face in his handkerchief. Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nstill aghast at the tidings they had met at Vicenza, and alarmed at\r\nher unnatural composure, embraced her; held her for some moments, then\r\nlooked anxiously to see her weep. But there was not a tear, and her\r\nvoice was itself, though low and weak, as, while her father began pacing\r\nup and down, she repeated,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, papa; Philip has been so ill all day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Philip--pshaw!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, hastily. \xe2\x80\x98How are you, yourself,\r\nmy poor darling?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite well, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98There is a room ready for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was extremely alarmed, sure that this was a grief too\r\ndeep for outward tokens, and had no peace till she had made Amabel\r\nconsent to come up with her, and go at once to bed. To this she agreed,\r\nafter she had rung for Arnaud, and stood with him in the corridor, to\r\ndesire him to go at once to Captain Morville, as softly as he could, and\r\nwhen he waked, to say Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone were come, but she thought\r\nhe had better not see them to-night; to tell him from her that she\r\nwished him good night, and hoped he would, sleep quietly. \xe2\x80\x98And, Arnaud,\r\ntake care you do not let him know the hour tomorrow. Perhaps, as he is\r\nso tired, he may sleep till afterwards.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was very impatient of this colloquy, and glad when\r\nAmabel ended it, and led the way up-stairs. She entered her little room,\r\nthen quietly opened another door, and Mrs. Edmonstone found herself\r\nstanding by the bed, where that which was mortal lay, with its face\r\nbright with the impress of immortality.\r\n\r\nThe shock was great, for he was indeed as a son to her; but her fears\r\nfor Amabel would not leave room for any other thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is not he beautiful?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with a smile like his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, my dear, you ought not to be here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\ntrying to lead her away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you would let me say my prayers here!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, submissively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to refuse, if it would be a comfort,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs. Edmonstone, much distressed, \xe2\x80\x98but I can\xe2\x80\x99t think it right.\r\nThe danger is greater after. And surely, my poor dear child, you have a\r\nreason for not risking yourself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go, mamma, I ought not to have brought you here; I forgot about\r\ninfection,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, with the tranquillity which her mother had\r\nhoped to shake by her allusion. \xe2\x80\x98I am coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe took up Guy\xe2\x80\x99s watch and a book from the table by the bed-side, and\r\ncame back to her sleeping-room. She wound up the watch, and then allowed\r\nher mother to undress her, answering all her inquiries about her health\r\nin a gentle, indifferent, matter-of-fact way. She said little of Guy,\r\nbut that little was without agitation, and in due time she lay down in\r\nbed. Still, whenever Mrs. Edmonstone looked at her, there was no sleep\r\nin her eyes, and at last she persuaded her to leave her, on the plea\r\nthat being watched made her more wakeful, as she did not like to see\r\nmamma sitting up.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as it was light, Mrs. Edmonstone returned, and was\r\npositively frightened, for there stood Amabel, dressed in her white\r\nmuslin, her white bonnet, and her deep lace wedding-veil. All her glossy\r\nhair was hidden away, and her face was placid as ever, though there was\r\na red spot on each cheek. She saw her mother\xe2\x80\x99s alarm, and reassured her\r\nby speaking calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know I have nothing else but colours; I should like to wear this,\r\nif you will let me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, dearest, you must not--cannot go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very near. We often walked there together. I would not if I\r\nthought it would hurt me, but I wish it very much indeed. At home by\r\nMichaelmas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone yielded, though her mind misgave her, comforted by\r\nhoping for the much-desired tears. But Amabel, who used to cry so easily\r\nfor a trifle, had now not a tear. Her grief was as yet too deep, or\r\nperhaps more truly sorrow and mourning had not begun while the influence\r\nof her husband\xe2\x80\x99s spirit was about her still.\r\n\r\nIt was time to set forth, and the small party of mourners met in the\r\nlong corridor. Mr. Edmonstone would have given his daughter his arm, but\r\nshe said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I beg your pardon, dear papa, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can;\xe2\x80\x99 and she walked\r\nalone and firmly.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight that English funeral, so far from England. The\r\nbearers were Italian peasants. There was a sheet thrown over the coffin\r\ninstead of a pall, and this, with the white dress of the young widow,\r\ngave the effect of the emblematic whiteness of a child\xe2\x80\x99s funeral; and\r\nthe impression was heightened by the floating curling white clouds of\r\nvapour rising in strange shrouded shadowy forms, like spirit mourners,\r\nfrom the narrow ravines round the grave-yard, and the snowy mountains\r\nshining in the morning light against the sky.\r\n\r\nGliding almost like one of those white wreaths of mist, Amabel walked\r\nalone, tearless and calm, her head bent down, and her long veil falling\r\nround her in full light folds, as when it had caught the purple light\r\non her wedding-day. Her parents were close behind, weeping more for the\r\nliving than the dead, though Guy had a fast hold of their hearts; and\r\nhis own mother could scarce have loved him better than Mrs. Edmonstone\r\ndid. Lastly, were Anne and Arnaud, sincere mourners, especially Arnaud,\r\nwho had loved and cherished his young master from childhood.\r\n\r\nThey went to the strangers\xe2\x80\x99 corner of the grave-yard, for, of course\r\nthe church did not open to a member of another communion of the visible\r\nchurch; but around them were the hills in which he had read many a\r\nmeaning, and which had echoed a response to his last chant with the\r\npromise of the blessing of peace.\r\n\r\nThe blessing of peace came in the precious English burial-service, as\r\nthey laid him to rest in the earth, beneath the spreading chestnut-tree,\r\nrendered a home by those words of his Mother Church--the mother who had\r\nguided each of his steps in his orphaned life. It was a distant grave,\r\nfar from his home and kindred, but in a hallowed spot, and a most fair\r\none; and there might his mortal frame meetly rest till the day when he\r\nshould rise, while from their ancestral tombs should likewise awaken the\r\nforefathers whose sins were indeed visited on him in his early death;\r\nbut, thanks to Him who giveth the victory, in death without the sting.\r\n\r\nAmabel, in obedience to a sign from her mother, sat on a root of the\r\ntree while the Lesson was read, and afterwards she moved forward and\r\nstood at the edge of the grave, her hands tightly clasped, and her\r\nhead somewhat raised, as if her spirit was following her husband to his\r\nrepose above, rather than to his earthly resting-place.\r\n\r\nThe service was ended, and she was taking a last long gaze, while her\r\nmother, in the utmost anxiety, was striving to make up her mind to draw\r\nher away, when suddenly a tall gaunt figure was among them--his\r\nface ghastly pale, and full of despair and bewilderment--his step\r\nuncertain--his dress disordered.\r\n\r\nAmabel turned, went up to him, laid her hand on his arm, and said,\r\nsoftly, and quietly looking up in his face, \xe2\x80\x98It is over now, Philip; you\r\nhad better come home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot attempting to withstand her, he obeyed as if it was his only\r\ninstinct. It was like some vision of a guiding, succouring spirit, as\r\nshe moved on, slowly gliding in her white draperies. Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nwatched her in unspeakable awe and amazement, almost overpowering her\r\nanxieties. It seemed as impossible that the one should be Amy as that\r\nthe other should be Philip, her gentle little clinging daughter, or her\r\nproud, imperturbable, self-reliant nephew.\r\n\r\nBut it was Amy\xe2\x80\x99s own face, when they entered the corridor and she turned\r\nback her veil, showing her flushed and heated cheeks, at the same time\r\nopening Philip\xe2\x80\x99s door and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Now you must rest, for you ought not\r\nto have come out. Lie down, and let mamma read to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was reluctant, but Amy looked up earnestly and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear mamma, I should like to be alone a little while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe then conducted her father to the sitting-room up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will give you the papers,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; and leaving him, returned\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is his will,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98You will tell me if there is anything\r\nI must do at once. Here is a letter to Mr. Markham, and another to Mr.\r\nDixon, if you will be so kind as to write and enclose them. Thank you,\r\ndear papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe drew a blotting-book towards him, saw that there was ink and pen,\r\nand left him too much appalled at her ways to say anything.\r\n\r\nHis task was less hard than the one she had set her mother. Strong\r\nexcitement had carried Philip to the grave-yard as soon as he learnt\r\nwhat was passing. He could hardly return even with Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s support, and\r\nhe had only just reached the sofa before he fell into a fainting-fit.\r\n\r\nIt was long before he gave any sign of returning life, and when\r\nhe opened his eyes and saw Mrs. Edmonstone, he closed them almost\r\nimmediately, as if unable to meet her look. It was easier to treat him\r\nin his swoon than afterwards. She knew nothing of his repentance and\r\nconfession; she only knew he had abused her confidence, led Laura to\r\nact insincerely, and been the cause of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s death. She did not know\r\nhow bitterly he accused himself, and though she could not but see he was\r\nmiserable, she could by no means fathom his wretchedness, nor guess that\r\nher very presence made him conscious how far he was fallen. He was so\r\nill that she could not manifest her displeasure, nor show anything\r\nbut solicitude for his relief; but her kindness was entirely to his\r\ncondition, not to himself; and perceiving this, while he thought his\r\nconfession had been received, greatly aggravated his distress, though he\r\nowned within himself that he well deserved it.\r\n\r\nShe found that he was in no state for being read to; he was completely\r\nexhausted, and suffering from violent headache. So when she could\r\nconscientiously say that to be left quiet was the best thing for him,\r\nshe went to her daughter.\r\n\r\nAmabel was lying on her bed, her Bible open by her; not exactly reading,\r\nbut as if she was now and then finding a verse and dwelling on it.\r\nGentle and serene she looked; but would she never weep? would those\r\nquiet blue eyes be always sleepless and tearless?\r\n\r\nShe asked anxiously for Philip, and throughout the day he seemed to\r\nbe her care. She did not try to get up and go to him, but she was\r\ncontinually begging her mother to see about him. It was a harassing day\r\nfor poor Mrs. Edmonstone. She would have been glad to have sat by Amabel\r\nall the time, writing to Charles, or hearing her talk. Amy had much\r\nto say, for she wished to make her mother share the perfect peace and\r\nthankfulness that had been breathed upon her during those last hours\r\nwith her husband, and she liked to tell the circumstances of his illness\r\nand his precious sayings, to one who would treasure them almost like\r\nherself. She spoke with her face turned away, so as not to see her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s tears, but her mild voice unwavering, as if secure in the\r\nhappiness of these recollections. This was the only comfort of Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s day, but when she heard her husband\xe2\x80\x99s boots creaking in the\r\ncorridor, it was a sure sign that he was in some perplexity, and that\r\nshe must go and help him to write a letter, or make some arrangement.\r\nPhilip, too, needed attention; but excellent nurse as Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nwas, she only made him worse. The more he felt she was his kind aunt\r\nstill, the more he saw how he had wounded her, and that her pardon\r\nwas an effort. The fond, spontaneous, unreserved affection--almost\r\npetting--which he had well-nigh dared to contemn, was gone; her manner\r\nwas only that of a considerate nurse. Much as he longed for a word\r\nof Laura, he did not dare to lead to it,--indeed, he was so far from\r\nspeaking to her of any subject which touched him, that he did not\r\npresume even to inquire for Amabel, he only heard of her through Arnaud.\r\n\r\nAt night sheer exhaustion worked its own cure; he slept soundly, and\r\nawoke in the morning revived. He heard from Arnaud that Lady Morville\r\nwas pretty well, but had not slept; and presently Mrs. Edmonstone came\r\nin and took pains to make him comfortable, but with an involuntary\r\ndryness of manner. She told him his uncle would come to see him as soon\r\nas he was up, if he felt equal to talking over some business. Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrain reeled with dismay and consternation, for it flashed on him that\r\nhe was heir of Redclyffe. He must profit by the death he had caused; he\r\nhad slain, and he must take possession of the lands which, with loathing\r\nand horror, he remembered that he had almost coveted. Nothing more\r\nwas wanting. There was little consolation in remembering that the\r\ninheritance would clear away all difficulties in the way of his\r\nmarriage. He had sinned; wealth did not alter his fault, and his spirit\r\ncould not brook that if spurned in poverty, he should be received for\r\nhis riches. He honoured his aunt for being cold and reserved, and could\r\nnot bear the idea of seeing his uncle ready to meet him half-way.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock he became anxious to have the meeting over, know\r\nthe worst, and hear on what ground he stood with Laura. As soon as he\r\nwas dressed, he sent a message to announce that he was ready, and lay\r\non the sofa awaiting his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s arrival, as patiently as he could. Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, meantime, was screwing up his courage--not that he meant to\r\nsay a word of Laura,--Philip was too unwell to be told his opinion of\r\nhim, but now he had ceased to rely on his nephew, he began to dread\r\nhim and his overbearing ways; and besides he had a perfect horror of\r\nwitnessing agitation.\r\n\r\nAt last he came, and Philip rose to meet him with a feeling of shame and\r\ninferiority most new to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, don\xe2\x80\x99t, I beg,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, with what was meant for\r\ndignity. \xe2\x80\x98Lie still; you had much better. My stars! how ill you look!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe exclaimed, startled by Philip\xe2\x80\x99s altered face and figure. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nhad a sharpish touch; but you are better, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well; I thought I had better come and speak to you, if you felt up to\r\nit. Here is--here is--I hope it is all right and legal; but that you\r\ncan tell better than I; and you are concerned in it anyhow. Here is poor\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s will, which we thought you had better look over, if you liked, and\r\nfelt equal, eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, holding out his hand; but Mr. Edmonstone\r\nwithheld it, trying his patience by an endless quantity of discursive\r\nhalf-sentences, apparently without connection with each other, about\r\ndisappointment, and hopes, and being sorry, and prospects, and its\r\n\xe2\x80\x98being an unpleasant thing,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98best not raise his expectations:\xe2\x80\x99\r\nduring all which time Philip, expecting to hear of Laura, and his heart\r\nbeating so fast as to renew the sensation of faintness, waited in vain,\r\nand strove to gather the meaning, and find out whether he was forgiven,\r\nalmost doubting whether the confusion was in his own mind or in\r\nhis uncle\xe2\x80\x99s words. However, at last the meaning bolted out in one\r\ncomprehensive sentence, when Mr. Edmonstone thought he had sufficiently\r\nprepared him for his disappointment,--\xe2\x80\x98Poor Amy is to be confined in the\r\nspring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere Mr. Edmonstone stopped short, very much afraid of the effect;\r\nbut Philip raised himself, his face brightened, as if he was greatly\r\nrelieved, and from his heart he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Thank Heaven!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right! that is very well said!\xe2\x80\x99 answered Mr. Edmonstone, very\r\nmuch pleased. \xe2\x80\x98It would be a pity it should go out of the old line after\r\nall; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very generous thing in you to say so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, shrinking into himself at even such praise as\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 said his uncle, \xe2\x80\x98you will see he has thought of you, be it\r\nhow it may. There! I only hope it is right; though it does seem rather\r\nqueer, appointing poor little Amy executor rather than me. If I had but\r\nbeen here in time! But \xe2\x80\x98twas Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s will; and so--It does not signify,\r\nafter all, if it is not quite formal. We understand each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe will was on a sheet of letter-paper, in Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s stiff French\r\nhandwriting; it was witnessed by the two Mr. Morrises, and signed on\r\nthe 27th of September, in very frail and feeble characters. Amabel and\r\nMarkham were the executors, and Amabel was to be sole guardian, in case\r\nof the birth of a child. If it was a son, \xc2\xa31O,OOO was left to Philip\r\nhimself; if not, he was to have all the plate, furniture, &c., of\r\nRedclyffe, with the exception of whatever Lady Morville might choose for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nPhilip scarcely regarded the legacy (though it smoothed away his chief\r\ndifficulties) as more than another of those ill-requited benefits\r\nwhich were weighing him to the earth. He read on to a sentence which\r\nreproached him so acutely, that he would willingly have hidden from it,\r\nas he had done from Guy\xe2\x80\x99s countenance. It was the bequest of \xc2\xa35000 to\r\nElizabeth Wellwood. Sebastian Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s debts were to be paid off; \xc2\xa31000\r\nwas left to Marianne Dixon, and the rest of the personal property was to\r\nbe Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe gave back the paper, with only the words \xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99 He did not feel\r\nas if it was for him to speak; and Mr. Edmonstone hesitated, made an\r\nattempt at congratulating him, broke down, and asked if it was properly\r\ndrawn up. He glanced at the beginning and end, said it was quite\r\ncorrect, and laid his head down, as if the examination had been a great\r\ndeal of trouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And what do you think of Amy\xe2\x80\x99s being under age?\xe2\x80\x99 fidgeted on Mr.\r\nEdmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98How is she to act, poor dear! Shall I act for her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She will soon be of age,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, wearily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In January, poor darling. Who would have thought how it would have been\r\nwith her? I little thought, last May--but, holloa! what have I been\r\nat?\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, jumping up in a great fright, as Philip, so weak as to be\r\novercome by the least agitation, changed countenance, covered his face\r\nwith his hands, and turned away with a suppressed sob. \xe2\x80\x98I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nit, I am sure! Here! mamma!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, recovering, and sitting up; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t call her, I\r\nbeg. There is nothing the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone obeyed, but he was too much afraid of causing a renewal\r\nof agitation to continue the conversation; and after walking about the\r\nroom a little while, and shaking it more than Philip could well bear, he\r\nwent away to write his letters.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Amabel had been spending her morning in the same quiet\r\nway as the former day. She wrote part of a letter to Laura, and walked\r\nto the graveyard, rather against her mother\xe2\x80\x99s wish; but she was so good\r\nand obedient, it was impossible to thwart her, though Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nwas surprised at her proposal to join her father and Philip at tea. \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nyou like it, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He told me to take care of him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot feel that he deserves you should worry yourself about him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98If you knew all--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do know all, mamma,--if you mean about Laura. Surely you must\r\nforgive. Think how he repents. What, have you not had his letter? Then\r\nhow did you know?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I learned it from Laura herself. Her trouble at his illness revealed\r\nit. Do you say he has written?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, mamma; he told Guy all about it, and was very sorry, and wrote\r\nas soon as he was able. Guy sent you a long message. He was so anxious\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel showed more eagerness to understand the state of the case, than\r\nshe had about anything else. She urged that Philip should be spoken to,\r\nas soon as possible, saying the suspense must be grievous, and dwelling\r\non his repentance. Mrs. Edmonstone promised to speak to papa, and\r\nthis satisfied her; but she held her resolution of meeting Philip\r\nthat evening, looking on him as a charge left her by her husband, and\r\nconscious that, as she alone understood how deep was his sorrow, she\r\ncould make the time spent with her parents less embarrassing.\r\n\r\nHer presence always soothed him, and regard for her kept her father\r\nquiet; so that the evening passed off very well. Mrs. Edmonstone waited\r\non both; and, in Amy\xe2\x80\x99s presence, was better able to resume her usual\r\nmanner towards her nephew, and he sat wondering at the placidity of\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s pale face. Her hair was smoothed back, and she wore a cap,--the\r\nloss of her long shady curls helping to mark the change from the bright\r\ndays of her girlhood; but the mournfulness of her countenance did\r\nnot mar the purity and serenity that had always been its great\r\ncharacteristic; and in the faint sweet smile with which she received\r\na kind word or attention, there was a likeness to that peculiar and\r\nbeautiful expression of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s, so as, in spite of the great\r\ndifference of feature and colouring, to give her a resemblance to him.\r\n\r\nAll this day had been spent by Mr. Edmonstone in a fret to get away from\r\nRecoara, and his wife was hardly less desirous to leave it than himself,\r\nfor she could have no peace or comfort about Amabel, till she had her\r\nsafely at home. Still she dreaded proposing the departure, and even more\r\nthe departure itself; and, in spite of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s impatience, she\r\nlet her alone till she had her mourning; but when, after two days of\r\nhard work, Anne had nearly managed to complete it, she made up her mind\r\nto tell her daughter that they ought to set out.\r\n\r\nAmabel replied by mentioning Philip. She deemed him a sort of trust, and\r\nhad been reposing in the thought of making him a reason for lingering in\r\nthe scene where the brightness of her life had departed from her. Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone would not allow that she ought to remain for his sake, and\r\ntold her it was her duty to resolve to leave the place. She said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\r\nbut for him;\xe2\x80\x99 and it ended in Mrs. Edmonstone going, without telling\r\nher, to inform him that she thought Amy ought to be at home as soon\r\nas possible; but that it was difficult to prevail on her, because\r\nshe thought him as yet not well enough to be left. He was, of course,\r\nshocked at being thus considered, and as soon as he next saw Amabel,\r\ntold her, with great earnestness, that he could not bear to see her\r\nremaining there on his account; that he was almost well, and meant to\r\nleave Recoara very soon; the journey was very easy, the sea voyage\r\nwould be the best thing for him, and he should be glad to get to the\r\nregimental doctor at Corfu.\r\n\r\nAmabel sighed, and knew she ought to be convinced. The very pain it gave\r\nher to lose sight of that green, grave, the chestnut-tree, and the white\r\nmountain; to leave the rooms and passages which still, to her ears,\r\nwere haunted by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s hushed step and voice, and to part with the window\r\nwhere she used each wakeful night to retrace his profile as he had stood\r\npausing before telling her of his exceeding happiness; that very pain\r\nmade her think that opposition would be selfish. She must go some time\r\nor other, and it was foolish to defer the struggle; she must not detain\r\nher parents in an infected place, nor keep her mother from Charles. She\r\ntherefore consented, and let them do what they pleased,--only insisting\r\non Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99s being left with Philip.\r\n\r\nPhilip did not think this necessary, but yielded, when she urged it as\r\na relief to her own mind; and Arnaud, though unwilling, and used to his\r\nown way, could make no objection when she asked it as a personal favour.\r\nArnaud was, at his own earnest wish, to continue in her service; and, as\r\nsoon as Philip was able to embark, was to follow her to Hollywell.\r\n\r\nAll this time nothing passed about Laura. Amabel asked several times\r\nwhether papa had spoken, but was always answered, \xe2\x80\x98Not yet;\xe2\x80\x99 and at last\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, after vainly trying to persuade him, was obliged to\r\ngive it up. The truth was, he could not begin; he was afraid of his\r\nnephew, and so unused to assume superiority over him that he did\r\nnot know what to do, and found all kinds of reasons for avoiding the\r\nembarrassing scene. Since Philip still must be dealt with cautiously,\r\nbetter not enter on the subject at all. When reminded that the suspense\r\nwas worse than anything, he said, no one could tell how things would,\r\nturn out, and grew angry with his wife for wishing him to make up a\r\nshameful affair like that, when poor Guy had not been dead a week, and\r\nhe had been the death of him; but it was just like mamma, she always\r\nspoilt him. He had a great mind to vow never to consent to his\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s marrying such an overbearing, pragmatical fellow; she ought\r\nto be ashamed of even thinking of him, when he was no better than her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s murderer.\r\n\r\nAfter this tirade, Mrs. Edmonstone might well feel obliged to tell\r\nAmabel, that papa must not be pressed any further; and, of course, if he\r\nwould not speak, she could not (nor did she wish it).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then, mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, with the air of decision that had lately\r\ngrown on her, \xe2\x80\x98I must tell him. I beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 she added,\r\nimploringly; \xe2\x80\x98but indeed I must. It is hard on him not to hear that you\r\nhad not his letter, and that Laura has told. I know Guy would wish me,\r\nso don\xe2\x80\x99t be displeased, dear mamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t be displeased with anything you do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you give me leave?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure I do,--leave to do anything but hurt yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And would it be wrong for me to offer to write to him? No one else\r\nwill, and it will be sad for him not to hear. It cannot be wrong,\r\ncan it?\xe2\x80\x99 said she, as the fingers of her right hand squeezed her\r\nwedding-ring, a habit she had taken up of late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not, my poor darling. Do just as you think fit. I am sorry\r\nfor him, for I am sure he is in great trouble, and I should like him to\r\nbe comforted--if he can. But, Amy, you must not ask me to do it. He has\r\ndisappointed me too much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone left the room in tears.\r\n\r\nAmabel went up to the window, looked long at the chestnut-tree, then\r\nup into the sky, sat down, and leant her forehead on her hand in\r\nmeditation, until she rose up, cheered and sustained, as if she had been\r\nholding council with her husband.\r\n\r\nShe did not over-estimate Philip\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings from suspense and anxiety.\r\nHe had not heard a word of Laura; how she had borne his illness, nor how\r\nmuch displeasure his confession had brought upon her; nor could he learn\r\nwhat hope there was that his repentance was accepted. He did not venture\r\nto ask; for after engaging to leave all to them, could he intrude his\r\nown concerns on them at such a time? It was but a twelvemonth since\r\nhe had saddened and shadowed Guy\xe2\x80\x99s short life and love with the\r\nvery suffering from uncertainty that he found so hard to bear. As he\r\nremembered this, he had a sort of fierce satisfaction in enduring this\r\nretributive justice; though there were moods when he felt the torture so\r\nacutely, that it seemed to him as if his brain would turn if he saw them\r\ndepart, and was left behind to this distracting doubt.\r\n\r\nThe day had come, on which they were to take their first stage, as far\r\nas Vicenza, and his last hopes were fading. He tried to lose the sense\r\nof misery by bestirring himself in the preparations; but he was too\r\nweak, and Mrs. Edmonstone, insisting on his attempting no more, sent him\r\nback: to his own sitting-room.\r\n\r\nPresently there was a knock, and in came Amabel, dressed, for the first\r\ntime, in her weeds, the blackness and width of her sweeping crape making\r\nher young face look smaller and paler, while she held in her hand some\r\nleaves of chestnut, that showed where she had been. She smiled a little\r\nas she came in, saying, \xe2\x80\x98I am come to you for a little quiet, out of the\r\nbustle of packing up. I want you to do something for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Anything for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is what you will like to do,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, with _that_ smile, \xe2\x80\x98for it\r\nis more for _him_ than for me. Could you, without teasing yourself, put\r\nthat into Latin for me, by and by? I think it should be in Latin, as it\r\nis in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe gave him a paper in her own writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUY MORVILLE, OF REDCLYFFE, ENGLAND. DIED THE EVE OF ST. MICHAEL AND ALL\r\nANGELS, 18--AGED 21 1/2. I BELIEVE IN THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you be so kind as to give it to Arnaud when it is done?\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncontinued; \xe2\x80\x98he will send it to the man who is making the cross. I think\r\nthe kind people here will respect it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 it is soon done, and thank you for letting me do\r\nit. But, Amy, I would not alter your choice; yet there is one that seems\r\nto me more applicable \xe2\x80\x9cGreater love hath no man--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know what you mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; \xe2\x80\x98but that has so high a meaning that\r\nhe could not bear it to be applied to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or rather, what right have I to quote it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x98His\r\nfriend! No, Amy; you should rather choose, \xe2\x80\x9cIf thine enemy thirst, give\r\nhim drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I am sure they are burning on mine,\xe2\x80\x99 and he pressed his hand on his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t say such things. We both know that, at the worst of times, he\r\nlooked on you as a sincere friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip groaned, and she thought it best to go on to something else.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like this best,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It will be nice to think of far away. I\r\nshould like, too, for these Italians to see the stranger has the same\r\ncreed as themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, during which he looked at the paper, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, I have one thing to ask of you. Will you write my name in the\r\nPrayer-book?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, and Philip drew it from under the sofa cushion,\r\nand began putting together his pocket gold pen. While he was doing this,\r\nshe said, \xe2\x80\x98Will you write to me sometimes? I shall be so anxious to know\r\nhow you get on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; with a sigh, as if he would fain have said\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe paused; then said, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x98Do you know they never had your\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! Good heavens!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, starting up in consternation; \xe2\x80\x98then they\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They do. Sit down, Philip, and hear. I wanted to tell you about it.\r\nThey know it. Poor Laura was so unhappy when you were ill, that mamma\r\nmade it out from her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe obeyed the hand that invited him back to his seat, and turned his\r\nface earnestly towards her. He must let her be his comforter, though a\r\nmoment before his mind would have revolted at troubling the newly-made\r\nwidow with his love affairs. Amabel told him, as fully and clearly as\r\nshe could, how the truth had come out, how gently Laura had been dealt\r\nwith, how Charles had been trying to soften his father, and papa had not\r\nsaid one angry word to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They forgive her. Oh, Amy, thanks indeed! You have taken away one of\r\nthe heaviest burdens. I am glad, indeed, that she spoke first. For my\r\nown part, I see through all their kindness and consideration how they\r\nregard me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They know how sorry you are, and that you wrote to tell all,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nAmabel. \xe2\x80\x98They forgive, indeed they do; but they cannot bear to speak\r\nabout it just yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you forgive, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a husky voice, \xe2\x80\x98I may hope for pardon\r\nfrom any.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush! don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. You have been so kind, all this time, and we have\r\nfelt together so much, that no one could help forgetting anything that\r\nwent before. Then you will write to me; and will you tell me how to\r\ndirect to you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will write to me?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Philip, brightening for a moment with glad\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Amy, you will quite overpower me with your goodness!--The\r\ncoals of fire,\xe2\x80\x99 he finished, sinking his voice, and again pressing his\r\nhand to his brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must not speak so, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 then looking at him, \xe2\x80\x98Is your head\r\naching?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not so much aching as--\xe2\x80\x99 he paused, and exclaimed, as if carried away\r\nin spite of himself, \xe2\x80\x98almost bursting with the thoughts of--of you,\r\nAmy,--of him whom I knew too late,--wilfully misunderstood, envied,\r\npersecuted; who,--oh! Amy, Amy, if you could guess at the anguish of but\r\none of my thoughts, you would know what the first murderer meant when he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMy punishment is greater than I can bear.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say don\xe2\x80\x99t think,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in her sweet, calm tone; \xe2\x80\x98for I\r\nhave seen how happy repentance made him, but I know it must be dreadful.\r\nI suppose the worse it is at the time, the better it must be afterwards.\r\nAnd I am sure this Prayer-book\xe2\x80\x99--she had her hand on it all the time,\r\nas if it was a pleasure to her to touch it again--\xe2\x80\x98must be a comfort\r\nto you. Did you not see that he made me give it to you to use that day,\r\nwhen, if ever, there was pardon and peace--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, in a low, grave, heartfelt tone; and as she\r\ntook the pen, and was writing his name below the old inscription, he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98And the date, Amy, and--yes,\xe2\x80\x99 as he saw her write \xe2\x80\x98From\r\nG. M.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98but put from A. F. M. too. Thank you! One thing more;\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nhesitated, and spoke very low, \xe2\x80\x98You _must_ write in it what you said\r\nwhen you came to fetch me that day,--\xe2\x80\x9cA broken\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99--\r\n\r\nAs she finished writing, Mrs. Edmonstone came in. \xe2\x80\x98My Amy, all is ready.\r\nWe must go. Good-bye, Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in the tone of one so eager for\r\ndeparture as to fancy farewells would hasten it. However, she was not\r\nmore eager than Mr. Edmonstone, who rushed in to hurry them on, shaking\r\nhands cordially with Philip, and telling him to make haste and recover\r\nhis good looks. Amabel held out her hand. She would fain have said\r\nsomething cheering, but the power failed her. A deep colour came into\r\nher cheeks; she drew her thick black veil over her face, and turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\nPhilip came down-stairs with them, saw her enter the carriage followed\r\nby her mother, Mr. Edmonstone outside. He remembered the gay smile with\r\nwhich he last saw her seated in that carriage, and the active figure\r\nthat had sprung after her; he thought of the kind bright eyes that had\r\npleaded with him for the last time, and recollected the suspicions and\r\nthe pride with which he had plumed himself on his rejection, and thrown\r\naway the last chance.\r\n\r\nShould he ever see Amabel again? He groaned and went back to the\r\ndeserted rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 37\r\n\r\n                                And see\r\n     If aught of sprightly, fresh, or free,\r\n     With the calm sweetness may compare\r\n     Of the pale form half slumbering there.\r\n     Therefore this one dear couch about\r\n     We linger hour by hour:\r\n     The love that each to each we bear,\r\n     All treasures of enduring care,\r\n     Into her lap we pour.\r\n                         --LYRA INNOCENTUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brother and sisters, left at home together, had been a very sad and\r\nsilent party, unable to attempt comforting each other. Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrief was wild and ungovernable; breaking out into fits of sobbing, and\r\nattending to nothing till she was abashed first by a reproof from Mr.\r\nRoss, and next by the description of Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct; when she grew\r\nashamed and set herself to atone, by double care, for her neglect of\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s comforts.\r\n\r\nCharles, however, wanted her little. He had rather be let alone. After\r\none exclamation of, \xe2\x80\x98My poor Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 he said not a word of lamentation,\r\nbut lay hour after hour without speaking, dwelling on the happy days he\r\nhad spent with Guy,--companion, friend, brother,--the first beam that\r\nhad brightened his existence, and taught him to make it no longer\r\ncheerless; musing on the brilliant promise that had been cut off;\r\nremembering his hopes for his most beloved sister, and feeling his\r\nsorrow with imagining hers. It was his first grief, and a very deep one.\r\nHe seemed to have no comfort but in Mr. Ross, who contrived to come to\r\nhim every day, and would tell him how fully he shared his affection and\r\nadmiration for Guy, how he had marvelled at his whole character, as it\r\nhad shown itself more especially at the time of his marriage, when his\r\nchastened temper had been the more remarkable in so young a man, with\r\nthe world opening on him so brightly. As to the promise lost, that,\r\nindeed, Mr. Ross owned, and pleased Charles by saying how he had hoped\r\nto watch its fulfilment; but he spoke of its having been, in truth, no\r\nblight, only that those fair blossoms were removed where nothing could\r\ncheck their full development or mar their beauty. \xe2\x80\x98The hope in earthly\r\nfurrows sown, would ripen in the sky;\xe2\x80\x99 Charles groaned, saying it was\r\nhard not to see it, and they might speak as they would, but that would\r\nnot comfort him in thinking of his sister. What was his sorrow to hers?\r\nBut Mr. Ross had strong trust in Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s depth and calm resignation.\r\nHe said her spirit of yielding would support her, that as in drowning or\r\nfalling, struggling is fatal, when quietness saves, so it would be with\r\nher: and that even in this greatest of all trials she would rise instead\r\nof being crushed, with all that was good and beautiful in her purified\r\nand refined. Charles heard, strove to believe and be consoled, and\r\nbrought out his letters, trying, with voice breaking down, to show\r\nMr. Ross how truly he had judged of Amy, then listened with a kind of\r\npleasure to the reports of the homely but touching laments of all the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nLaura did not, like her brother and sister, seek for consolation from\r\nMr. Ross or Mary. She went on her own way, saying little, fulfilling her\r\nhousehold cares, writing all the letters that nobody else would write,\r\nproviding for Charles\xe2\x80\x99s ease, and looking thoroughly cast down and\r\nwretched, but saying nothing; conscious that her brother and sister did\r\nnot believe her affection for Guy equal to theirs; and Charles was too\r\nmuch dejected, and too much displeased with Philip, to try to console\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to hear, at length, that the travellers had landed, and\r\nwould be at home in the evening, not till late, wrote Mrs. Edmonstone,\r\nbecause she thought it best for Amabel to go at once to her room, her\r\nown old room, for she particularly wished not to be moved from it.\r\n\r\nThe evening had long closed in; poor Bustle had been shut up in\r\nCharlotte\xe2\x80\x99s room, and the three sat together round the fire, unable to\r\nguess how they should meet her, and thinking how they had lately been\r\nlooking forward to greeting their bride, as they used proudly to call\r\nher. Charles dwelt on that talk on the green, and his \xe2\x80\x98when shall\r\nwe three meet again?\xe2\x80\x99 and spoke not a word; Laura tried to read; and\r\nCharlotte heard false alarms of wheels; but all were so still, that when\r\nthe wheels really came, they were heard all down the turnpike road, and\r\nalong the lane, before they sounded on the gravel drive.\r\n\r\nLaura and Charlotte ran into the hall, Charles reached his crutches, but\r\nhis hands shook so much that he could not adjust them, and was obliged\r\nto sit down, rising the next minute as the black figures entered\r\ntogether. Amy\xe2\x80\x99s sweet face was pressed to his, but neither spoke. That\r\nagitated \xe2\x80\x98My dear, dear Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99 was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s, as she threw her\r\narms around him, with redoubled kisses and streaming tears; and there\r\nwas a trembling tone in his father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Well, Charlie boy, how have you\r\ngot on without us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey sat down, Charles with his sister beside him, and holding a hand\r\nsteadier than his own, but hot and feverish to the touch. He leant\r\nforward to look at her face, and, as if in answer, she turned it on\r\nhim. It was the old face, paler and thinner, and the eyelids had a\r\nhard reddened look, from want of sleep: but Charles, like his mother\r\nat first, was almost awed by the melancholy serenity of the expression.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you been quite well?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked, in a voice which sounded\r\nstrangely familiar, in its fond, low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, quite.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, followed by an interchange of question and answer\r\nbetween the others, on the journey, and on various little home\r\ncircumstances. Presently Mrs. Edmonstone said Amy had better come\r\nup-stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not seen Bustle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, looking at Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is in my room,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should like to see him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharlotte hastened away, glad to wipe her tears when outside the door.\r\nPoor Bustle had been watching for his master ever since his departure,\r\nand hearing the sounds of arrival, was wild to escape from his prison.\r\nHe rushed out the moment the door was open, and was scratching to be let\r\ninto the drawing-room before Charlotte could come up with him. He dashed\r\nin, laid his head on Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s knee, and wagged his tail for welcome;\r\ngave the same greeting to Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, but only for a\r\nmoment, for he ran restlessly seeking round the room, came to the door,\r\nand by his wistful looks made Charlotte let him out. She followed\r\nhim, and dropping on her knees as soon as she was outside, pressed her\r\nforehead to his glossy black head, whispered that it was of no use, he\r\nwould never come back. The dog burst from her, and the next moment was\r\nsmelling and wagging his tail at a portmanteau, which he knew as well as\r\nshe did, and she could hardly refrain from a great outburst of sobbing\r\nas she thought what joy its arrival had hitherto been.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Bustle bounded away, and as Charlotte stood trying to compose\r\nherself enough to return to the drawing-room, she heard the poor fellow\r\nwhining to be let in at Guy\xe2\x80\x99s bed-room door. At the same time the\r\ndrawing-room door opened, and anxious that Amy should neither see nor\r\nhear him, she ran after him, admitted him, and shut herself in with him\r\nin the dark, where, with her hands in his long silky curls, and sitting\r\non the ground, she sobbed over him as long as he would submit to her\r\ncaresses.\r\n\r\nAmabel meantime returned to her room, and looked round on its well-known\r\naspect with a sad smile, as she thought of the prayer with which she\r\nhad quitted it on her bridal day, and did not feel as if it had been\r\nunanswered; for surely the hand of a Father had been with her to support\r\nher through her great affliction.\r\n\r\nThough she said she was very well, her mother made her go to bed at\r\nonce, and Laura attended on her with a sort of frightened, respectful\r\ntenderness, hardly able to bear her looks of gratitude. The first time\r\nthe two sisters were alone, Amabel said, \xe2\x80\x98Philip is much better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura, who was settling some things on the table, started back and\r\ncoloured, then, unable to resist the desire of hearing of him, looked\r\nearnestly at her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is gone to Corfu,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98He only kept Arnaud three\r\ndays after we were gone, and Arnaud overtook us at Geneva, saying his\r\nstrength had improved wonderfully. Will you give me my basket? I should\r\nlike to read you a piece of a note he sent me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura brought it, and Amabel, holding her hand, looked up at her face,\r\nwhich she vainly tried to keep in order. \xe2\x80\x98Dearest, I have been very\r\nsorry for you, and so has Guy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy!\xe2\x80\x99 and Laura found herself giving way to her tears, in spite of all\r\nher previous exhortations to Charlotte, about self-control; \xe2\x80\x98my own, own\r\nsister!\xe2\x80\x99 To have Amy at home was an unspeakable comfort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Papa and mamma were both as kind as possible to Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 continued\r\nAmabel; \xe2\x80\x98but they could not bear to enter on _that_. So I told him you\r\nhad told all, and he was very glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He was not displeased at my betraying him?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\r\nhe was glad; he said it was a great relief, for he was very anxious\r\nabout you, Laura. He has been so kind to me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, so earnestly,\r\nthat Laura received another comfort, that of knowing that her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation against him had all passed by. \xe2\x80\x98Now I will read you what he\r\nsays. You see his writing is quite itself again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Laura observed that Amabel only held towards her the \xe2\x80\x98Lady Morville\xe2\x80\x99\r\non the outside, keeping the note to herself, and reading, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\ncontinued to gain strength since you went; so that there is no further\r\nneed of detaining Arnaud. I have twice been out of doors, and am\r\nconvinced that I am equal to the journey; indeed, it is hardly possible\r\nfor me to endure remaining here any longer.\xe2\x80\x99 She read no more, but\r\nfolded it up, saying, \xe2\x80\x98I had rather no one saw the rest. He makes\r\nhimself so unhappy about that unfortunate going to Sondrio, that he says\r\nwhat is only painful to hear. I am glad he is able to join his regiment,\r\nfor a change will be the best thing for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe laid her head on the pillow as if she had done with the subject, and\r\nLaura did not venture to pursue it, but went down to hear her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount of her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone was feeling it a great comfort to have her son to talk\r\nto again, and availed herself of it to tell him of Philip, while Laura\r\nwas absent, and then to return to speak of Amy on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s re-entrance.\r\nShe said, all through the journey, Amy had been as passive and tranquil\r\nas possible, chiefly leaning back in the carriage in silence, excepting\r\nthat when they finally left the view of the snowy mountains, she gazed\r\nafter them as long as the least faint cloud-like summit was visible.\r\nStill she could not sleep, except that now and then she dozed a little\r\nin the carriage, but at night she heard every hour strike in turn, and\r\nlay awake through all, nor had she shed one tear since her mother had\r\njoined her. Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was very great, for she said she\r\nknew Amy must pay for that unnatural calmness, and the longer it was\r\nbefore it broke down, the worse it would be for her. However, she was at\r\nhome, that was one thing to be thankful for, and happen what might, it\r\ncould not be as distressing as if it had been abroad.\r\n\r\nAnother night of \xe2\x80\x98calm unrest,\xe2\x80\x99 and Amabel rose in the morning, at her\r\nusual hour, to put on the garments of her widowhood, where she had last\r\nstood as a bride. Charles was actually startled by her entering the\r\ndressing-room, just as she used to do, before breakfast, to read with\r\nhim, and her voice was as steady as ever. She breakfasted with the\r\nfamily, and came up afterwards with Laura, to unpack her dressing-case,\r\nand take out the little treasures that she and her husband had enjoyed\r\nbuying in the continental towns, as presents for the home party.\r\n\r\nAll this, for which she had previously prepared herself, she underwent\r\nas quietly as possible; but something unexpected came on her. Charlotte,\r\ntrying to pet and comfort her in every possible way, brought in all\r\nthe best flowers still lingering in the garden, and among them a last\r\nblossom of the Noisette rose, the same of which Guy had been twisting a\r\nspray, while he first told her of his love.\r\n\r\nIt was too much. It recalled his perfect health and vigour, his light\r\nactivity, and enjoyment of life, and something came on her of the\r\nsensation we feel for an insect, one moment full of joyous vitality, the\r\nnext, crushed and still. She had hitherto thought of his feverish thirst\r\nand fainting weariness being at rest, and felt the relief, or else\r\nfollowed his spirit to its repose, and rejoiced; but now the whole\r\nscene brought back what he once was; his youthful, agile frame, his eyes\r\ndancing in light, his bounding step, his gay whistle, the strong hand\r\nthat had upheld her on the precipice, the sure foot that had carried\r\naid to the drowning sailors, the arm that was to have been her stay for\r\nlife, all came on her in contrast with--death! The thought swept over\r\nher, carrying away every other, and she burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe tears would have their course; she could not restrain them when once\r\nthey began, and her struggles to check them only brought an increase of\r\nthem. Her sobs grew so violent that Laura, much alarmed, made a sign\r\nto Charlotte to fetch her mother; and Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in haste,\r\nfound it was indeed the beginning of a frightful hysterical attack.\r\nThe bodily frame had been overwrought to obey the mental firmness and\r\ncomposure, and now nature asserted her rights; the hysterics returned\r\nagain and again, and when it seemed as if exhaustion had at length\r\nproduced quiet, the opening of a door, or a sound in the distance, would\r\nrenew all again.\r\n\r\nIt was not till night had closed in that Mrs. Edmonstone was at all\r\nsatisfied about her, and had at length the comfort of seeing her\r\nfall into a sound deep sleep; such an unbroken dreamless sleep as had\r\nscarcely visited her since she first went to Recoara. Even this sleep\r\ndid not restore her; she became very unwell, and both Dr. Mayerne and\r\nher mother insisted on her avoiding the least exertion or agitation. She\r\nwas quite submissive, only begging earnestly to be allowed to see\r\nMr. Ross, saying she knew it would do her good rather than harm, and\r\npromising to let him leave her the instant she found it too much for\r\nher; and though Mrs. Edmonstone was reluctant and afraid, they agreed\r\nthat as she was so reasonable and docile, she ought to be allowed to\r\njudge for herself.\r\n\r\nShe begged that he might come after church on All Saints\xe2\x80\x99 day. He came,\r\nand after his first greeting of peace, Mrs. Edmonstone signed to him to\r\nread at once, instead of speaking to her. The beautiful lesson for the\r\nday overcame Mrs. Edmonstone so much that she was obliged to go out of\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s sight, but as the words were read, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s face recovered once\r\nmore the serenity that had been swept away by the sight of the flowers.\r\nPeace had returned, and when the calm every-day words of the service\r\nwere over, she held out her hand to Mr. Ross, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, that\r\nwas very nice. Now talk to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult request, but Mr. Ross understood her, and talked to\r\nher as she sought, in a gentle, deep, high strain of hope and faith,\r\nvery calm and soothing, and with a fatherly kindness that was very\r\npleasant from him who had baptized her, taught her, and whom she had\r\nlast seen blessing her and her husband. It ended by her looking up to\r\nhim when it was time for him to go, and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you. You will\r\ncome again when you have time, I hope. My love to dear Mary, I should\r\nlike to see her soon, but I knew you would do me more good than anybody,\r\nand know better how it feels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Ross knew she meant that he must better understand her loss, because\r\nhe was a widower, and was greatly touched, though he only answered by a\r\nblessing, a farewell, and a promise to come very soon to see her again.\r\n\r\nAmabel was right, the peace which he had recalled, and the power of\r\nresignation that had returned, had a better effect on her than all her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s precautions; she began to improve, and in a few days more was\r\nable to leave her bed, and lie on the sofa in the dressing-room, though\r\nshe was still so weak and languid that this was as much as she could\r\nattempt. Any exertion was to be carefully guarded against, and her tears\r\nnow flowed so easily, that she was obliged to keep a check on them lest\r\nthey might again overpower her. Mr. Ross came again and again, and she\r\nwas able to tell him much of the grounds for her great happiness in Guy,\r\nhear how entirely he had understood him, and be assured that she had\r\ndone right, and not taken an undue responsibility on herself by the\r\nargument she had used to summon Philip, that last evening. She had begun\r\nto make herself uneasy about this; for she said she believed she was\r\nthinking of nothing but Guy, and had acted on impulse; and she was\r\nvery glad Mr. Ross did not think it wrong, while Mr. Ross meanwhile\r\nwas thinking how fears and repentance mingle with the purest sweetest,\r\nholiest deeds.\r\n\r\nShe was able now to take pleasure in seeing Mary Ross; she wrote to\r\nPhilip at Corfu, and sent for Markham to begin to settle the executor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness. Poor Markham! the Edmonstones thought he looked ten years\r\nolder when he arrived, and after his inquiry for Lady Morville, his\r\ngrunt almost amounted to a sob. The first thing he did was to give Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone a note, and a little box sent from Mrs. Ashford. The note was\r\nto say that Mrs. Ashford had intended for her wedding present, a little\r\ncross made out of part of the wood of the wreck, which she now thought\r\nit beat to send to Mrs. Edmonstone, that she might judge whether Lady\r\nMorville would like to see it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s judgment was to carry it at once to Amabel, and\r\nshe was right, for the pleasure she took in it was indescribable. She\r\nfondled it, set it up by her on her little table, made Charlotte put\r\nit in different places that she might see what point of view suited it\r\nbest, had it given back to her, held it in her hands caressingly,\r\nand said she must write at once to Mrs. Ashford to thank her for\r\nunderstanding her so well. There was scarcely one of the mourners to be\r\npitied more than Markham, for the love he had set on Sir Guy had\r\nbeen intense, compounded of feudal affection, devoted admiration, and\r\npaternal care--and that he, the very flower of the whole race, should\r\nthus have been cut down in the full blossom of his youth and hopes, was\r\nalmost more than the old man could bear or understand. It was a great\r\nsorrow, too, that he should be buried so far away from his forefathers;\r\nand the hearing it was by his own desire, did not satisfy him, he sighed\r\nover it still, and seemed to derive a shade of comfort only when he was\r\ntold there was to be a tablet in Redclyffe church to the memory of Guy,\r\nsixth baronet.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Markham became very confidential with Charles; telling\r\nhim about the grievous mourning and lamentation at Redclyffe, when the\r\nbells rung a knell instead of greeting the young master and his bride,\r\nand how there was scarcely one in the parish that did not feel as if\r\nthey had lost a son or a brother. He also told more and more of Sir\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s excellence, and talked of fears of his own, especially last\r\nChristmas; that the boy was too unlike other people, too good to live;\r\nand lastly, he indulged in a little abuse of Captain Morville, which\r\ndid Charles\xe2\x80\x99s heart good, at the same time as it amused him to think how\r\nMarkham would recollect it, when he came to hear of Laura\xe2\x80\x99s engagement.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the next day, Markham had his conference with Lady\r\nMorville in the dressing-room, and brought her two or three precious\r\nparcels, which he would not, for the world, have given into any other\r\nhands. He could hardly bear to look at her in her widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap, and\r\nbehaved to her with a manner varying between his deference and respect\r\nto the Lady of Redclyffe, and his fatherly fondness for the wife of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98his boy.\xe2\x80\x99 As to her legal powers, he would have thought them foolishly\r\nbestowed, if they had been conferred by any one save his own Sir Guy,\r\nand he began by not much liking to act with her; but he found her so\r\nclear-headed, that he was much surprised to find a woman could have so\r\nmuch good sense, and began to look forward with some satisfaction to\r\nbeing her prime minister. They understood each other very well; Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood sense and way of attending to the one matter in hand, kept her from\r\npuzzling and alarming herself by thinking she had more to do than she\r\ncould ever understand or accomplish; she knew it was Guy\xe2\x80\x99s work, and a\r\ncharge he had given her,--a great proof of his confidence,--and she\r\ndid all that was required of her very well, so that matters were put in\r\ntrain to be completed when she should be of age, in the course of the\r\nnext January.\r\n\r\nWhen Markham left her she was glad to be alone, and to open her parcels.\r\nThere was nothing here to make her hysterical, for she was going to\r\ncontemplate the living soul, and felt almost, as if it was again being\r\nalone with her husband. There were his most prized and used books,\r\ncovered with marks and written notes; there was Laura\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of\r\nSintram, which had lived with him in his rooms at Oxford; there was a\r\nroll of music, and there was his desk. The first thing when she opened\r\nit was a rough piece of spar, wrapped in paper, on which was written,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98M. A. D., Sept. 18.\xe2\x80\x99 She remembered what he had told her of little\r\nMarianne\xe2\x80\x99s gift. The next thing made her heart thrill, for it was a slip\r\nof pencilling in her own writing, \xe2\x80\x98Little things, on little wings, bear\r\nlittle souls to heaven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer own letters tied up together, those few that she had written in the\r\nshort time they were separated just before their marriage! Could that\r\nbe only six months ago? A great bundle of Charles\xe2\x80\x99s and of Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s; those she might like to read another time, but not now.\r\nMany other papers letters signed S. B. Dixon, which she threw aside,\r\nnotes of lectures, and memoranda, only precious for the handwriting; but\r\nwhen she came to the lower division; she found it full of verses, almost\r\nall the poetry he had ever written.\r\n\r\nThere were the classical translations that used to make him inaccurate,\r\na scrap of a very boyish epic about King Arthur, beginning with a storm\r\nat Tintagel, sundry half ballads, the verses he was suspected of, and\r\nnever would show, that first summer at Hollywell, and a very touching\r\nvision of his fair young mother. Except a translation or two, some words\r\nwritten to suit their favourite airs (a thing that used to seem to come\r\nas easily to him as singing to a bird), and a few lively mock heroic\r\naccounts of walks or parties, which had all been public property, there\r\nwas no more that she could believe to have been composed till last year,\r\nfor he was more disposed to versify in sorrow than in joy. There were\r\na good many written during his loneliness, for his reflections had a\r\ntendency to flow into verse, and pouring them out thus had been a great\r\nsolace. The lines were often imperfect and irregular, but not one that\r\nwas not deep, pure, and genuine, and here and there scattered with\r\npassages of exquisite beauty and harmony, and full of power and grace.\r\nNo one could have looked at them without owning in them the marks of a\r\nthorough poet, but this was not what the wife was seeking, and when\r\nshe perceived it, though it made her face beam with a sort of satisfied\r\npride, it was a secondary thing. She was studying not his intellect, but\r\nhis soul; she did not care whether he would have been a poet, what she\r\nlooked for was the record of the sufferings and struggles of the sad six\r\nmonths when his character was established, strengthened, and settled.\r\n\r\nShe found it. There was much to which she alone had the clue, too deep,\r\nand too obscurely hinted, to be understood at a glance. She met with\r\nsuch evidence of suffering as made her shudder and weep, tokens of\r\nthe dark thoughts that had gathered round him, of the manful spirit of\r\npenitence and patience that had been his stay, and of the gleams that\r\nlighted his darkest hours, and showed he had never been quite forsaken.\r\nNow and then came a reference which brought home what he had told her;\r\nhow the thought of his Verena had cheered him when he dared not hope she\r\nwould be restored. Best of all were the lines written when the radiance\r\nof Christmas was, once for all, dispersing the gloom, and the vision\r\nopening on him, which he was now realizing. In reading them, she felt\r\nthe same marvellous sympathy of subdued wondering joy in the victory of\r\nwhich she had partaken as she knelt beside his death-bed. These were\r\nthe last. He had been too happy for poetry, except one or two scraps\r\nin Switzerland, and these had been hers from the time she had detected\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Amabel almost lived on those papers! It would not be too much\r\nto say she was very happy in her own way when alone with them; the desk\r\non a chair by her sofa. They were too sacred for any one else; she did\r\nnot for many weeks show one even to her mother; but to her they were\r\nlike a renewal of his presence, soothing the craving after him that had\r\nbeen growing on her ever since the first few days when his sustaining\r\npower had not passed away. As she sorted them, and made out their dates,\r\nfinding fresh stores of meaning at each fresh perusal she learnt through\r\nthem, as well as through her own trial, so patiently borne, to enter\r\ninto his character even more fully than when he was in her sight.\r\nMrs. Edmonstone, who had at first been inclined to dread her constant\r\ndwelling on them, soon perceived that they were her great aids through\r\nthis sad winter.\r\n\r\nShe had much pleasure in receiving the portrait, which was sent her by\r\nMr. Shene. It was a day or two before she could resolve to look at it,\r\nor feel that she could do so calmly. It was an unfinished sketch, taken\r\nmore with a view to the future picture than to the likeness; but Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas a face to be better represented by being somewhat idealized, than\r\nby copying merely the material form of the features. An ordinary artist\r\nmight have made him like a Morville, but Mr. Shene had shown all\r\nthat art could convey of his individual self, with almost one of his\r\nunearthly looks. The beautiful eyes, with somewhat of their peculiar\r\nlightsomeness, the flexible look of the lip, the upward pose of the\r\nhead, the set of that lock of hair that used to wave in the wind, the\r\nanimated position, \xe2\x80\x98just ready for a start,\xe2\x80\x99 as Charles used to call it,\r\nwere recalled as far as was in the power of chalk and crayon, but so as\r\nto remind Amabel of him more as one belonging to heaven than to earth.\r\nThe picture used to be on her mantel-shelf all night, the shipwreck\r\ncross before it, and Sintram and Redclyffe on each side; and she\r\nbrought it into the dressing-room with her in the morning, setting it up\r\nopposite to the sofa, before settling herself.\r\n\r\nHer days were much alike. She felt far from well, or capable of\r\nexertion, and was glad it was thought right to keep her entirely\r\nupstairs; she only wished to spare her mother anxiety, by being\r\nsubmissive to her care, in case these cares should be the last for her.\r\nShe did not dwell on the future, nor ask herself whether she looked for\r\nlife or death. Guy had bidden her not desire the last, and she believed\r\nshe did not form a wish; but there was repose to her in the belief that\r\nshe ought not to conceal from herself that there was more than ordinary\r\nrisk, and that it was right to complete all her affairs in this world,\r\nand she was silent when her mother tried to interest her in prospects\r\nthat might cheer her; as if afraid to fasten on them, and finding more\r\npeace in entire submission, than in feeding herself on hope that must be\r\ncoupled with fear.\r\n\r\nChristmas-day was not allowed to pass without being a festival for\r\nher, in her quiet room, where she lay, full of musings on his lonely\r\nChristmas night last year, his verses folded among her precious books,\r\nand the real joy of the season more within her grasp than in the turmoil\r\nof last year. She was not afraid now to let herself fancy his voice in\r\nthe Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Song, and the rainbow was shining on her cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 38\r\n\r\n     The coldness from my heart is gone,\r\n     But still the weight is there,\r\n     And thoughts which I abhor will come\r\n     To tempt me to despair.\r\n                            --SOUTHEY\r\n\r\n\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s one anxiety was for Philip. For a long time nothing was heard\r\nof him at Hollywell, and she began to fear that he might have been less\r\nfit to take care of himself than he had persuaded her to believe. When\r\nat length tidings reached them, it was through the De Courcys. \xe2\x80\x98Poor\r\nMorville,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote Maurice, \xe2\x80\x98had been carried ashore at Corfu, in the\r\nstupor of a second attack of fever. He had been in extreme danger for\r\nsome time, and though now on the mend, was still unable to give any\r\naccount of himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn effect, it was a relapse of the former disease, chiefly affecting\r\nthe brain, and his impatience to leave Recoara, and free himself from\r\nArnaud, had been a symptom of its approach, though it fortunately did\r\nnot absolutely overpower him till after he had embarked for Corfu, and\r\nwas in the way to be tended with the greatest solicitude. Long after the\r\nfever was subdued, and his strength returning, his mind was astray, and\r\neven when torturing delusions ceased, and he resumed the perception of\r\nsurrounding objects, memory and reflection wavered in dizzy confusion,\r\nmore distressing than either his bodily weakness, or the perpetual pain\r\nin his head, which no remedy could relieve.\r\n\r\nThe first date to which he could afterwards recur, though for more than\r\na week he had apparently been fully himself, was a time when he was\r\nsitting in an easy-chair by the window, obliged to avert his heavy eyes\r\nfrom the dazzling waters of the Corcyran bay, where Ulysses\xe2\x80\x99 transformed\r\nship gleamed in the sunshine, and the rich purple hills of Albania\r\nsloped upwards in the distance. James Thorndale was, as usual, with him,\r\nand was explaining that there had been a consultation between the doctor\r\nand the colonel, and they had decided that as there was not much chance\r\nof restoring his health in that climate in the spring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Spring!\xe2\x80\x99 he interrupted, with surprise and eagerness, \xe2\x80\x98Is it spring?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hardly--except that there is no winter here. This is the 8th of\r\nJanuary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe let his head fall on his hand again, and listened with indifference\r\nwhen told he was to be sent to England at once, under the care of his\r\nservant, Bolton, and Mr. Thorndale himself, who was resolved to see him\r\nsafe in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s hands. He made no objection; he had become used\r\nto be passive, and one place was much the same to him as another; so he\r\nmerely assented, without a question about the arrangements. Presently,\r\nhowever, he looked up, and inquired for his letters. Though he had done\r\nso before, the request had always been evaded, until now he spoke in a\r\nmanner which decided his friend on giving him all except one with broad\r\nblack edges, and Broadstone post-mark; the effect of which, it was\r\nthought, might be very injurious to his shattered nerves and spirits.\r\n\r\nHowever, he turned over the other letters without interest, just\r\nglancing languidly through them, looked disappointed, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98None from Hollywell! Has nothing been heard from them? Thorndale,\r\nI insist on knowing whether De Courcy has heard anything of Lady\r\nMorville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has heard of her arrival in England.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My sister mentions that--more than two months ago--I can hardly believe\r\nshe has not written, if she was able. She promised, yet how can\r\nI expect--\xe2\x80\x99 then interrupting himself, he added, authoritatively,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thorndale, is there no letter for me? I see there is. Let me have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis friend could not but comply, and had no reason to regret having done\r\nso; for after reading it twice, though he sighed deeply, and the tears\r\nwere in his eyes, he was more calm and less oppressed than he had been\r\nat any time since his arrival in Corfu. He was unable to write, but\r\nColonel Deane had undertaken to write to Mrs. Henley to announce his\r\ncoming; and as the cause of his silence must be known at Hollywell, he\r\nresolved to let Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s letter wait for a reply till his arrival in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt was on a chilly day in February that Mrs. Henley drove to the station\r\nto meet her brother, looking forward with a sister\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction to\r\nnursing his recovery, and feeling (for she had a heart, after all) as if\r\nit was a renewal of the days, which she regarded with a tenderness mixed\r\nwith contempt, when all was confidence between the brother and sister,\r\nthe days of nonsense and romance. She hoped that now poor Philip, who\r\nhad acted hastily on his romance, and ruined his own prospects for her\r\nsake in his boyish days, had a chance of having it all made up to him,\r\nand reigning at Redclyffe according to her darling wish.\r\n\r\nAs she anxiously watched the arrival of the train, she recognized\r\nMr. Thorndale, whom she had known in his school-days as Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotege--but could that be her brother? It was his height, indeed; but\r\nhis slow weary step as he crossed the platform, and left the care of his\r\nbaggage to others, was so unlike his prompt, independent air, that\r\nshe could hardly believe it to be himself, till, with his friend, he\r\nactually advanced to the carriage, and then she saw far deeper traces\r\nof illness than she was prepared for. A confusion of words took place;\r\ngreetings on one hand, and partings on the other, for James Thorndale\r\nwas going on by the train, and made only a few minutes\xe2\x80\x99 halt in which to\r\nassure Mrs. Henley that though the landing and the journey had knocked\r\nup his patient to-day, he was much better since leaving Corfu, and to\r\nbeg Philip to write as soon as possible. The bell rang, he rushed back,\r\nand was whirled away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you are better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Henley, anxiously surveying her\r\nbrother. \xe2\x80\x98You are sadly altered! You must let us take good care of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you! I knew you would be ready to receive me, though I fear I am\r\nnot very good company.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Say no more, my dearest brother. You know both Dr. Henley and myself\r\nhave made it our first object that our house should be your home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This salubrious air must benefit you,\xe2\x80\x99 she added. \xe2\x80\x98How thin you are!\r\nAre you very much fatigued?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Rather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, who was leaning back wearily; but the next moment\r\nhe exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98What do you hear from Hollywell?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is no news yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know how she is? When did you hear of her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98About a week ago; when she wrote to inquire for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She did? What did she say of herself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing particular, poor little thing; I believe she is always on the\r\nsofa. My aunt would like nothing so well as making a great fuss about\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you any objection to show me her letter?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, unable to\r\nbear hearing Amabel thus spoken of, yet desirous to learn all he could\r\nrespecting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have not preserved it,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer. \xe2\x80\x98My correspondence is so\r\nextensive that there would be no limit to the accumulation if I did not\r\ndestroy the trivial letters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden flush on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s pale face that caused his sister to\r\npause in her measured, self-satisfied speech, and ask if he was in pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, shortly, and Margaret pondered on his strange manner,\r\nlittle guessing what profanation her mention of Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s letter had\r\nseemed to him, or how it jarred on him to hear this exaggerated likeness\r\nof his own self-complacent speeches.\r\n\r\nShe was much shocked and grieved to see him so much more unwell than she\r\nhad expected. He was unfit for anything but to go to bed on his arrival.\r\nDr. Henley said the system had received a severe shock, and it would be\r\nlong before the effects would be shaken off; but that there was no fear\r\nbut his health would be completely restored if he would give himself\r\nentire rest.\r\n\r\nThere was no danger that Margaret would not lavish care enough on her\r\nbrother. She waited on him in his room all the next day, bringing him\r\neverything he could want, and trying to make him come down-stairs, for\r\nshe thought sitting alone there very bad for his spirits; but he said\r\nhe had a letter to write, and very curious she was to know why he was\r\nso long doing it, and why he did not tell her to whom it was addressed.\r\nHowever, she saw when it was put into the post-bag, that it was for Lady\r\nMorville.\r\n\r\nAt last, too late to see any of the visitors who had called to inquire,\r\nwhen the evening had long closed in, she had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nPhilip enter the drawing-room, and settling him in the most comfortable\r\nof her easy-chairs on one side of the fire to wait till the Doctor\r\nreturned for dinner. The whole apartment was most luxurious, spacious,\r\nand richly furnished; the fire, in its brilliant steel setting, glancing\r\non all around, and illuminating her own stately presence, and rich glace\r\nsilk, as she sat opposite her brother cutting open the leaves of one of\r\nthe books of the club over which she presided. She felt that this was\r\nsomething like attaining one of the objects for which she used to say\r\nand think she married,--namely, to be able to receive her brother in a\r\ncomfortable home. If only he would but look more like himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you like a cushion for your head, Philip? Is it better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better since morning, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did those headaches come on before your second illness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t distinctly remember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I cannot think how the Edmonstones could leave you. I shall always\r\nblame them for that relapse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It had nothing to do with it. Their remaining was impossible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s account? No, poor thing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her, for she must\r\nhave been quite helpless; but it was exactly like my aunt, to have but\r\none idea at a time. Charles used to be the idol, and now it is Amy, I\r\nsuppose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If anything could have made it more intolerable for me, it would have\r\nbeen detaining them there for my sake, at such a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I felt a great deal for you. You must have been very sorry for that\r\npoor little Amy. She was very kind in writing while you were ill. How\r\ndid she contrive, poor child? I suppose you took all the head work for\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I? I was nothing but a burden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were you still so very ill?\xe2\x80\x99 said Margaret, tenderly. \xe2\x80\x98I am sure you\r\nmust have been neglected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would that I had!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Philip, so low that she did not catch the\r\nwords. Then aloud,--\xe2\x80\x98No care could have been greater than was taken for\r\nme. It was as if no one had been ill but myself, and the whole thought\r\nof every one had been for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then Amabel managed well, poor thing! We do sometimes see those weak\r\nsoft characters--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sister!\xe2\x80\x99 he interrupted.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have not you told me so yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was a fool, or worse,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a tone of suffering. \xe2\x80\x98No words can\r\ndescribe what she proved herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Self-possessed? energetic?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mrs. Henley, with whom those were the\r\nfirst of qualities; and as her brother paused from repugnance to speak\r\nof Amabel to one so little capable of comprehending her, she proceeded:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No doubt she did the best she could, but she must have been quite\r\ninexperienced. It was a very young thing in the poor youth to make her\r\nexecutrix. I wonder the will was valid; but I suppose you took care of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you see it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My uncle showed it to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you can tell me what I want to hear, for no one has told me\r\nanything. I suppose my uncle is to be guardian?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; Lady Morville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it? Most lover-like indeed. That poor girl to manage\r\nthat great property? Everything left to her!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Henley,\r\ncontinuing her catechism in spite of the unwillingness of his replies.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Were there any legacies? I know of Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That to Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and my own,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours? How was it that I never heard of it? What is it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ten thousand,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am delighted to hear it!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Margaret. \xe2\x80\x98Very proper of Sir\r\nGuy--very proper indeed, poor youth. It is well thought of to soften the\r\ndisappointment.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip started forward. \xe2\x80\x98Disappointment!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed he, with horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You need not look as if I wished to commit murder,\xe2\x80\x99 said his sister,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x98Have you forgotten that it depends on whether it is a son or\r\ndaughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis dismay was not lessened. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to say that this is to come on\r\nme if the child is a daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you were so young when the entail was made, that you knew nothing\r\nof it. Female heirs were expressly excluded. There was some aunt whom\r\nold Sir Guy passed over, and settled the property on my father and you,\r\nfailing his own male heirs.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one would take advantage of such a chance,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do not make any rash resolutions, my dear brother, whatever you do,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Margaret. \xe2\x80\x98You have still the same fresh romantic generous spirit\r\nof self-sacrifice that is generally so soon worn out, but you must not\r\nlet it allow you--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough of this,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, hastily, for every word was a dagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you are right not to dwell on the uncertainty. I am almost sorry\r\nI told you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Margaret. \xe2\x80\x98Tell me about Miss Wellwood\xe2\x80\x99s legacy,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncontinued, desirous of changing the subject. \xe2\x80\x98I want to know the truth\r\nof it, for every one is talking of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How comes the world to know of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There have been reports ever since his death, and now it has been paid,\r\nwhatever it is, on Lady Morville\xe2\x80\x99s coming of age. Do you know what\r\nit is? The last story I was told was, that it was \xc2\xa32O,OOO, to found a\r\nconvent to pray for his grand--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Five thousand for her hospital,\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted Philip. \xe2\x80\x98Sister!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nadded; speaking with effort, \xe2\x80\x98it was for that hospital that he made the\r\nrequest for which we persecuted him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I thought so, I could have told you so!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Margaret, triumphant\r\nin her sagacity, but astonished, as her brother started up and stood\r\nlooking at her, as if he could hardly resolve to give credit to her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You--thought--so,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I guessed it from the first. He was always with that set, and I thought\r\nit a very bad thing for him; but as it was only a guess, it was not\r\nworth while to mention it: besides, the cheque seemed full evidence. It\r\nwas the general course, not the individual action.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you thought so, why not mention it to me? Oh! sister, what would you\r\nnot have spared me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I might have done so if it had appeared that it might lead to his\r\nexculpation, but you were so fully convinced that his whole course\r\nconfirmed the suspicions, that a mere vague idea was not worth dwelling\r\non. Your general opinion, of him satisfied me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I cannot blame you,\xe2\x80\x99 was all his reply, as he sat down again, with his\r\nface averted from the light.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Henley was doubtful whether he meant that she had been\r\njudicious! She spoke again, unconscious of the agony each word\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor youth! we were mistaken in those facts, and of course, all is\r\nforgiven and forgotten now; but he certainly had a tremendous temper.\r\nI shall never forget that exhibition. Perhaps poor Amabel is saved much\r\nunhappiness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once for all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, sternly, \xe2\x80\x98let me never hear you speak of\r\nhim thus. We were both blind to a greatness of soul and purity of heart\r\nthat we shall never meet again. Yours was only prejudice; mine I must\r\ncall by a darker name. Remember, that he and his wife are only to be\r\nspoken of with reverence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe composed himself to silence; and Margaret, after looking at him for\r\nsome moments in wonder, began in a sort of exculpatory tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course we owe him a great deal of gratitude. It was very kind and\r\nproper to come to you when you were ill, and his death must have been\r\na terrible shock. He was a fine young man; amiable, very attractive in\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No more!\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That, you always said of him,\xe2\x80\x99 continued she, not hearing, \xe2\x80\x98but you\r\nhave no need to reproach yourself. You always acted the part of a true\r\nfriend, did full justice to his many good qualities, and only sought his\r\nreal good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Every word you speak is the bitterest satire on me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\r\ngoaded into rousing himself for a moment. \xe2\x80\x98Say no more, unless you would\r\ndrive me distracted!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMargaret was obliged to be silent, and marvel, while her brother sat\r\nmotionless, leaning back in his chair, till Dr. Henley came in; and\r\nafter a few words to him, went on talking to his wife, till dinner was\r\nannounced. Philip went with them into the dining-room, but had\r\nscarcely sat down before he said he could not stay, and returned to the\r\ndrawing-room sofa. He said he only wanted quiet and darkness, and sent\r\nhis sister and her husband back to their dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has he been doing?\xe2\x80\x99 said the Doctor; \xe2\x80\x98here is his pulse up to a\r\nhundred again. How can he have raised it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He only came down an hour ago, and has been sitting still ever since.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Talking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; and there, perhaps, I was rather imprudent. I did not know\r\nhe could so little bear to hear poor Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s name mentioned; and,\r\nbesides, he did not know, till I told him, that he had so much chance of\r\nRedclyffe. He did not know the entail excluded daughters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he not! That accounts for it. I should like to see the man who\r\ncould hear coolly that he was so near such a property. This suspense is\r\nunlucky just now; very much against him. You must turn his thoughts from\r\nit as much as possible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll the next day, Mrs. Henley wondered why her brother\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were so\r\nmuch depressed, resisting every attempt to amuse or cheer them; but, on\r\nthe third, she thought some light was thrown on the matter. She was\r\nat breakfast with the Doctor when the post came in, and there was a\r\nblack-edged letter for Captain Morville, evidently from Amabel. She took\r\nit up at once to his room. He stretched out his hand for it eagerly,\r\nbut laid it down, and would not open it while she was in the room. The\r\ninstant she was gone, however, he broke the seal and read:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Hollywell, February 20th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PHILIP,--Thank you much for writing to me. It was a great\r\ncomfort to see your writing again, and to hear of your being safe in our\r\nown country. We had been very anxious about you, though we did not hear\r\nof your illness till the worst was over. I am very glad you are at\r\nSt. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, for I am sure Margaret must be very careful of you, and\r\nStylehurst air must be good for you. Every one here is well; Charles\r\ngrowing almost active, and looking better than I ever saw him. I wish\r\nI could tell you how nice and quiet a winter it has been; it has been\r\na great blessing to me in every way, so many things have come to me to\r\nenjoy. Mr. Ross has come to me every Sunday, and often in the week, and\r\nhas been so very kind. I think talking to him will be a great pleasure\r\nto you when you are here again. You will like to hear that Mr. Shene has\r\nsent me the picture, and the pleasure it gives me increases every day.\r\nIndeed, I am so well off in every way, that you must not grieve yourself\r\nabout me, though I thank you very much for what you say. Laura reads to\r\nme all the evening from dinner to tea. I am much better than I was in\r\nthe winter, and am enjoying the soft spring air from the open window,\r\nmaking it seem as if it was much later in the year. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye, my dear\r\ncousin; may God bless and comfort you. Remember, that after all, it was\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s will, not your doing; and therefore, as he said himself, all is as\r\nit should be, and so it will surely be.\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Your affectionate cousin,\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x98AMABEL F. MORVILLE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nChildishly simple as this letter might be called, with its set of facts\r\nwithout comment, and the very commonplace words of consolation, it spoke\r\nvolumes to Philip of the spirit in which it was written--resignation,\r\npardon, soothing, and a desire that her farewell, perhaps her last,\r\nshould carry with it a token of her perfect forgiveness. Everything from\r\nAmabel did him good; and he was so perceptibly better, that his sister\r\nexclaimed, when she was next alone with Dr. Henley, \xe2\x80\x98I understand it\r\nall, poor fellow; I thought long ago, he had some secret attachment; and\r\nnow I see it was to Amabel Edmonstone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Lady Morville?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. You know how constantly he was at Hollywell, my aunt so fond of\r\nhim? I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose Amy knew of it; and, of course, she could not be\r\nblamed for accepting such an offer as Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s; besides, she never had\r\nmuch opinion of her own.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How? No bad speculation for him. She must have a handsome jointure; but\r\nwhat are your grounds?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Everything. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember he would not go to the marriage? He\r\nmentions her almost like a saint; can\xe2\x80\x99t hear her name from any one\r\nelse--keeps her letter to open alone, is more revived by it than\r\nanything else. Ah! depend upon it, it was to avoid her, poor fellow,\r\nthat he refused to go to Venice with them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Their going to nurse him is not as if Sir Guy suspected it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he did, nor Amy either. No one ever had so much power\r\nover himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip would not have thanked his sister for her surmise, but it was so\r\nfar in his favour that it made her avoid the subject, and he was thus\r\nspared from hearing much of Amabel or of Redclyffe. It was bad enough\r\nwithout this. Sometimes in nursery tales, a naughty child, under the\r\ncare of a fairy, is chained to an exaggeration of himself and his own\r\nfaults, and rendered a slave to this hateful self. The infliction\r\nhe underwent in his sister\xe2\x80\x99s house was somewhat analogous, for Mrs.\r\nHenley\xe2\x80\x99s whole character, and especially her complacent speeches, were a\r\nstrong resemblance of his own in the days he most regretted. He had ever\r\nsince her marriage regarded her as a man looks at a fallen idol, but\r\nnever had her alteration been so clear to him, as he had not spent much\r\ntime with her, making her short visits, and passing the chief of each\r\nday at Stylehurst. Now, he was almost entirely at her mercy, and her\r\nunvarying kindness to him caused her deterioration to pain him all the\r\nmore; while each self-assertion, or harsh judgment, sounded on his ear\r\nlike a repetition of his worst and most hateful presumption. She little\r\nguessed what she made him endure, for he had resumed his wonted stoicism\r\nof demeanour, though the hardened crust that had once grown over his\r\nfeelings had been roughly torn away, leaving an extreme soreness and\r\ntenderness to which an acute pang was given whenever he was reminded,\r\nnot only of his injuries to Guy, but of the pride and secret envy that\r\nhad been their root.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he disappointed her by his continued reserve and\r\ndepression. The confidence she had forfeited was never to be restored,\r\nand she was the last person to know how incapable she was of receiving\r\nit, or how low she had sunk in her self-exaltation.\r\n\r\nHe was soon able to resume the hours of the family, but was still far\r\nfrom well; suffering from languor, pain in the head, want of sleep and\r\nappetite; and an evening feverishness. He was unequal to deep reading,\r\nand was in no frame for light books; he could not walk far, and his\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s literary coteries, which he had always despised, were at\r\npresent beyond his powers of endurance. She hoped that society would\r\ndivert his thoughts and raise his spirits, and arranged her parties with\r\na view to him; but he never could stay long in the room, and Dr. Henley,\r\nwho, though proud of his wife and her talents, had little pleasure in\r\nher learned circle, used to aid and abet his escape.\r\n\r\nThus Philip got through the hours as best he might, idly turning the\r\npages of new club-books, wandering on the hills till he tired himself,\r\nsitting down to rest in the damp air, coming home chilled and fatigued,\r\nand lying on the sofa with his eyes shut, to avoid conversation, all the\r\nevening. Neither strength, energy, nor intellect would, serve him for\r\nmore; and this, with the load and the stings of a profound repentance,\r\nformed his history through the next fortnight.\r\n\r\nHe used often to stand gazing at the slowly-rising walls of Miss\r\nWellwood\xe2\x80\x99s buildings, and the only time he exerted himself in his old\r\nway to put down any folly in conversation, was when he silenced some of\r\nthe nonsense talked about her, and evinced his own entire approval of\r\nher proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 39\r\n\r\n     Beneath a tapering ash-tree\xe2\x80\x99s shade\r\n     Three graves are by each other laid.\r\n     Around the very place doth brood\r\n     A strange and holy quietude.\r\n                          --BAPTISTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nLate on the afternoon of the 6th of March, Mary Ross entered by the\r\nhalf-opened front door at Hollywell, just as Charles appeared slowly\r\ndescending the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well! how is she?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Mary eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little dear!\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, with a sigh; \xe2\x80\x98she looks very nice and\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, you have seen her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am at this moment leaving her room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is going on well, I hope?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perfectly well. There is one comfort at least,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, drawing\r\nhimself down the last step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Amy! And the babe--did you see it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; the little creature was lying by her, and she put her hand on it,\r\nand gave one of those smiles that are so terribly like his; but I could\r\nnot have spoken about it for the world. Such fools we be!\xe2\x80\x99 concluded\r\nCharles, with an attempt at a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is healthy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All a babe ought to be, they say, all that could be expected of it,\r\nexcept the not being of the right sort, and if Amy does not mind that,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who should,\xe2\x80\x99 and Charles deposited himself on the sofa,\r\nheaving a deep sigh, intended to pass for the conclusion of the\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you think she is not disappointed?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not. The first thing she said when she was told it was a\r\ngirl, was, \xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d and she does seem very happy with it, poor\r\nlittle thing! In fact, mamma thinks she had so little expected that\r\nit would go well with herself, or with it, that now it is all like a\r\nsurprise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, first broken by Charles saying, \xe2\x80\x98You must be\r\ncontent with me--I can\xe2\x80\x99t send for anyone. Bustle has taken papa and\r\nCharlotte for a walk, and Laura is on guard over Amy, for we have made\r\nmamma go and lie down. It was high time, after sitting up two nights,\r\nand meaning to sit up a third.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has she really--can she bear it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I am afraid I have trained her in sitting up, and Amy and all of\r\nus know that anxiety hurts her more than fatigue. She would only lie\r\nawake worrying herself, instead of sitting peaceably by the fire,\r\nholding the baby, or watching Amy, and having a quiet cry when she is\r\nasleep. For, after all, it is very sad!\xe2\x80\x99 Charles was trying to brave\r\nhis feelings, but did not succeed very well. \xe2\x80\x98Yesterday morning I was\r\nproperly frightened. I came into the dressing-room, and found mamma\r\ncrying so, that I fully believed it was all wrong, but she was just\r\ncoming to tell us, and was only overcome by thinking of not having him\r\nto call first, and how happy he would have been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And the dear Amy herself!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. She is a wonderful person for keeping herself composed\r\nwhen she ought. I see she has his picture in full view, but she says not\r\na word, except that mamma saw her to-day, when she thought no one was\r\nlooking, fondling the little thing, and whispering to it--\xe2\x80\x9cGuy\xe2\x80\x99s baby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9cGuy\xe2\x80\x99s little messenger!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 Charles gave up the struggle, and\r\nfairly cried, but in a moment rallying his usual tone, he went on, half\r\nlaughing,--\xe2\x80\x98To be sure, what a morsel of a creature it is! It is awful\r\nto see anything so small calling itself a specimen of humanity!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is your first acquaintance with infant humanity, I suppose? Pray,\r\ndid you ever see a baby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not to look at. In fact, Mary, I consider it a proof of your being a\r\nrational woman that you have not asked me whether it is pretty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you no judge of the article.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, it was not to inspect it that Amy sent for me; though after all it\r\nwas for a business I would almost as soon undertake, a thing I would not\r\ndo for any other living creature.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I know what it is. To write some kind message to Captain Morville.\r\nJust like the dear Amy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just like her, and like no one else, except--Of course my father wrote\r\nhim an official communication yesterday, very short; but the fact must\r\nhave made it sweet enough, savage as we all were towards him, as there\r\nwas no one else to be savage to, unless it might be poor Miss Morville,\r\nwho is the chief loser by being of the feminine gender,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles,\r\nagain braving what he was pleased to call sentimentality. \xe2\x80\x98Well, by and\r\nby, my lady wants to know if any one has written to \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nshe will call him, and, by no means contented by hearing papa had,\r\nshe sends to ask me to come to her when I came in from wheeling in the\r\ngarden; and receives me with a request that I would write and tell him\r\nhow well she is, and how glad, and so on. There\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of work for\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Luckily you are not quite so savage as you pretend, either to him, or\r\nyour poor little niece.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whew! I should not care whether she was niece or nephew but for him;\r\nat least not much, as long as she comforted Amy; but to see him at\r\nRedclyffe, and be obliged to make much of him at the same time, is more\r\nthan I can very well bear; though I may as well swallow it as best I\r\ncan, for she will have me do it, as well as on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\nAmy believes, you know, that he will think the inheritance a great\r\nmisfortune; but that is only a proof that she is more amiable than any\r\none else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should think he would not rejoice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not exactly; but I have no fear that he will not console himself by\r\nthinking of the good he will do with it. I have no doubt that he was\r\nthoroughly cut up, and I could even go the length of believing that\r\ndistress of mind helped to bring on the relapse, but it is some time\r\nago. And as to his breaking his heart after the first ten minutes at\r\nfinding himself what he has all his life desired to be, in a situation\r\nwhere the full influence of his talents may be felt,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, with\r\na shade of imitation of his measured tones, \xe2\x80\x98why that, no one but silly\r\nlittle Amy would ever dream of.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I dare say you will grow merciful as you write.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that is not the way to let my indignation ooze out at my fingers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nends. I shall begin by writing to condole with Markham. Poor man! what\r\na state he must be in; all the more pitiable because he evidently had\r\nentirely forgotten that there could ever be a creature of the less\r\nworthy gender born to the house of Morville; so it will take him quite\r\nby surprise. What will he do, and how will he ever forgive Mrs. Ashford,\r\nwho, I see in the paper, has a son whom nobody wants, as if for the\r\nexpress purpose of insulting Markham\xe2\x80\x99s feelings! Well-a-day! I should\r\nhave liked to have had the sound of Sir Guy Morville still in my ears,\r\nand yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I could have endured its being applied to a\r\nlittle senseless baby! And, after all, we are the gainers; for it would\r\nhave been a forlorn thing to have seen Amy go off to reign queen-mother\r\nat Redclyffe,--and most notably well would she have reigned, with that\r\nclear little head. I vow \xe2\x80\x98tis a talent thrown away! However, I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngrumble. She is much happier without greatness thrust on her, and for\r\nmy own part, I have my home-sister all to myself, with no rival but that\r\nsmall woman--and how she will pet her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And how you will! What a spoiling uncle you will be! But now, having\r\nheard you reason yourself into philosophy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to write. We\r\nwere so anxious, that I could not help coming. I am so glad that little\r\none thrives! I should like to leave my love for Amy, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The rarity of such a message from you may enable me. I was lying\r\nhere alone, and received the collected love of five Harpers to convey\r\nup-stairs, all which I forgot; though in its transit by Arnaud and his\r\nFrench, it had become \xe2\x80\x9cthat they made their friendships to my lady and\r\nMrs. Edmonstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles had not talked so like himself for months; and Mary felt that\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s child, if she had disappointed some expectations, had come like\r\na spring blossom, to cheer Hollywell, after its long winter of sorrow\r\nand anxiety. She seemed to have already been received as a messenger to\r\ncomfort them for the loss, greatest of all to her, poor child, though\r\nshe would never know how great. Next Mary wondered what kind of letter\r\nCharles would indite, and guessed it would be all the kinder for the\r\noutpouring he had made to her, the only person with whom he ventured to\r\nindulge in a comfortable abuse of Philip, since his good sense taught\r\nhim that, ending as affairs must, it was the only wise way to make the\r\nbest of it, with father, mother, and Charlotte, all quite sufficiently\r\ndisposed to regard Philip with aversion without his help.\r\n\r\nPhilip was at breakfast with the Henleys, on the following morning, a\r\nSunday,--or rather, sitting at the breakfast-table, when the letters\r\nwere brought in. Mrs. Henley, pretending to be occupied with her own,\r\nhad an eager, watchful eye on her brother, as one was placed before him.\r\nShe knew Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s writing, but was restrained from exclaiming\r\nby her involuntary deference for her brother. He flushed deep red one\r\nmoment, then turned deadly pale, his hand, when first he raised it,\r\ntrembled, but then became firm, as if controlled by the force of his\r\nresolution. He broke the black seal, drew out the letter, paused another\r\ninstant, unfolded it, glanced at it, pushed his chair from the table,\r\nand hastened to me door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, tell me, Philip, what is it?\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, rising to follow\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe turned round, threw the letter on the table, and with a sign that\r\nforbade her to come with him, left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor fellow! how he feels it! That poor young creature!\xe2\x80\x99 said she,\r\ncatching up the letter for explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ha! No! Listen to this, Dr. Henley. Why, he must have read it wrong!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Hollywell, March 5th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98DEAR PHILIP,--I have to announce to you that Lady Morville was safely\r\nconfined this morning with a daughter. I shall be ready to send all the\r\npapers and accounts of the Redclyffe estate to any place you may appoint\r\nas soon as she is sufficiently recovered to transact business. Both she\r\nand the infant are as well as can be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n        --Yours sincerely,\r\n               \xe2\x80\x98C. EDMONSTONE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A daughter!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Dr. Henley. \xe2\x80\x98Well, my dear, I congratulate you! It\r\nis as fine a property as any in the kingdom. We shall see him pick up\r\nstrength now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go and find him. He surely has mistaken!\xe2\x80\x99 said Margaret,\r\nhastening in search of him; but he was not to be found, and she saw him\r\nno more till she found him in the seat at church.\r\n\r\nShe hardly waited to be in the churchyard, after the service, before she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Surely you mistook the letter!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I did not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw that she is doing well, and it is a girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And will you not let me congratulate you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted by some acquaintance; but when she looked round he\r\nwas nowhere to be seen, and she was obliged to be content with telling\r\nevery one the news. One or two of her many tame gentlemen came home\r\nwith her to luncheon, and she had the satisfaction of dilating on the\r\ngrandeur of Redclyffe. Her brother was not in the drawing-room, but\r\nanswered when she knocked at his door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Luncheon is ready. Will you come down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is any one there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Brown and Walter Maitland. Shall I send you anything, or do you\r\nlike to come down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll come, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, thus secured from a tete-a-tete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had you better come? Is not your head too bad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will not be better for staying here; I\xe2\x80\x99ll come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went down, telling her visitors that, since his illness, her brother\r\nalways suffered so much from excitement that he was too unwell to have\r\nderived much pleasure from the tidings: and when he appeared his air\r\ncorresponded with her account, for his looks were of the gravest and\r\nsternest. He received the congratulations of the gentlemen without\r\nthe shadow of a smile, and made them think him the haughtiest and most\r\ndignified landed proprietor in England.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley advised strongly against his going to church, but without\r\neffect, and losing him in the crowd coming out, saw him no more till\r\njust before dinner-time. He had steeled himself to endure all that she\r\nand the Doctor could inflict on him that evening, and he had a hope of\r\npersuading Amabel that it would be only doing justice to her child to\r\nlet him restore her father\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance, which had come to him through\r\ncircumstances that could not have been foreseen. He was determined to do\r\nnothing like an act of possession of Redclyffe till he had implored her\r\nto accept the offer; and it was a great relief thus to keep it in doubt\r\na little longer, and not absolutely feel himself profiting by Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath and sitting in his seat. Not a word, however, must be said to let\r\nhis sister guess at his resolution, and he must let her torture him in\r\nthe meantime. He was vexed at having been startled into betraying his\r\nsuffering, and was humiliated at the thought of the change from that\r\niron imperturbability, compounded of strength, pride, and coldness in\r\nwhich he had once gloried.\r\n\r\nDr. Henley met him with a shake of the hand, and hearty exclamation:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I congratulate you, Sir Philip Morville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; that is spared me,\xe2\x80\x99 was his answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem! The baronetcy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Margaret, \xe2\x80\x98I thought you knew that only goes to the direct\r\nheir of old Sir Hugh. But you must drop the \xe2\x80\x9ccaptain\xe2\x80\x9d at least. You will\r\nsell out at once?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe patiently endured the conversation on the extent and beauty of\r\nRedclyffe, wearing all the time a stern, resolute aspect, that his\r\nsister knew to betoken great unhappiness. She earnestly wished to\r\nunderstand him, but at last, seeing how much her conversation increased\r\nhis headache, she desisted, and left him to all the repose his thoughts\r\ncould give him. He was very much concerned at the tone of the note from\r\nhis uncle, as if it was intended to show that all connection with the\r\nfamily was to be broken off. He supposed it had been concerted with some\r\none; with Charles, most likely,--Charles, who had judged him too truly,\r\nand with his attachment to Guy, and aversion to himself, was doubtless\r\nstrengthening his father\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure, all the more for this hateful\r\nwealth. And Laura? What did she feel?\r\n\r\nMonday morning brought another letter. At first, he was struck with\r\nthe dread of evil tidings of Amabel or her babe, especially when he\r\nrecognized Charles\xe2\x80\x99s straggling handwriting; and, resolved not to be\r\nagain betrayed, he carried it up to read in his own room before his\r\nsister had noticed it. He could hardly resolve to open it, for surely\r\nCharles would not write to him without necessity; and what, save sorrow,\r\ncould cause that necessity? He saw that his wretchedness might be even\r\nmore complete! At length he read it, and could hardly believe his own\r\neyes as he saw cheering words, in a friendly style of interest and\r\nkindliness such as he would never have expected from Charles, more\r\nespecially now.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Hollywell, March 6th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PHILIP,--I believe my father wrote to you in haste yesterday,\r\nbut I am sure you will be anxious for further accounts, and when there\r\nis good news there is satisfaction in conveying it. I know you will be\r\nglad to hear our affairs are very prosperous; and Amy, whom I have just\r\nbeen visiting, is said by the authorities to be going on as well as\r\npossible. She begs me to tell you of her welfare, and to assure you that\r\nshe is particularly pleased to have a daughter; or, perhaps, it will be\r\nmore satisfactory to have her own words. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must tell him how well\r\nI am, Charlie, and how very glad. And tell him that he must not vex\r\nhimself about her being a girl, for that is my great pleasure; and I\r\ndo believe, the very thing I should have chosen if I had set to work to\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x9d You know Amy never said a word but in all sincerity, so you must\r\ntrust her, and I add my testimony that she is in placid spirits, and may\r\nwell be glad to escape the cares of Redclyffe. My father says he desired\r\nMarkham to write to you on the business matters. I hope the sea-breezes\r\nmay do you good. All the party here are well; but I see little of them\r\nnow, all the interest of the house is upstairs.\r\n\r\n--Your affectionate,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98C. M, EDMONSTONE.\r\n\r\nP. S. The baby is very small, but so plump and healthy, that no one\r\nattempts to be uneasy about her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nNever did letter come in better time to raise a desponding heart. Of\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness he was already certain; but that she should have\r\nmade Charles his friend was a wonder beyond all others. It gave him more\r\nhope for the future than he had yet been able to entertain, and showed\r\nhim that the former note was no studied renunciation of him, but only an\r\nebullition of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment.\r\n\r\nIt gave him spirit enough to undertake what he had long been meditating,\r\nbut without energy to set about it--an expedition to Stylehurst.\r\nHitherto it had been his first walk on coming to St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, but now\r\nthe distance across the moor was far beyond his powers; and even that\r\nlength of ride was a great enterprise. It was much further by the\r\ncarriage road, and his sister never liked going there. He had never\r\nfailed to visit his old home till last year, and he felt almost glad\r\nthat he had not carried his thoughts, at that time, to his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave. It was strange that, with so many more important burdens on\r\nhis mind, it had been this apparent trivial omission, this slight to\r\nStylehurst, that, in both his illnesses, had been the most frequently\r\nrecurring idea that had tormented him in his delirium. So deeply,\r\nsecurely fixed is the love of the home of childhood in men of his mould,\r\nin whom it is perhaps the most deeply rooted of all affections.\r\n\r\nWithout telling his sister his intention, he hired a horse, and pursued\r\nthe familiar moorland tracks. He passed South Moor Farm; it gave him too\r\ngreat a pang to look at it; he rode on across the hills where he used to\r\nwalk with his sisters, and looked down into narrow valleys where he\r\nhad often wandered with his fishing-rod, lost in musings on plans for\r\nattaining distinction, and seeing himself the greatest man of his day.\r\nLittle had he then guessed the misery which would place him in the way\r\nto the coveted elevation, or how he would loathe it when it lay within\r\nhis grasp.\r\n\r\nThere were the trees round the vicarage, the church spire, the cottages,\r\nwhose old rough aspect, he knew so well, the whole scene, once \xe2\x80\x98redolent\r\nof joy and youth:\xe2\x80\x99 but how unable to breathe on him a second spring! He\r\nput up his horse at the village inn, and went to make his first call on\r\nSusan, the old clerk\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and one of the persons in all the world who\r\nloved him best. He knocked, opened the door, and saw her, startled from\r\nher tea-drinking, looking at him as a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless us! It beant never Master Philip!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, her head\r\nshaking very fast, as she recognized his voice. \xe2\x80\x98Why, sir, what a turn\r\nyou give me! How bad you be looking, to be sure!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe sat down and talked with her, with feelings of comfort. Tidings of\r\nSir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s death had reached the old woman, and she was much grieved for\r\nthe nice, cheerful-spoken young gentleman, whom she well remembered; for\r\nshe, like almost every one who had ever had any intercourse with him,\r\nhad an impression left of him, as of something winning, engaging,\r\nbrightening, like a sunbeam. It was a refreshment to meet with one who\r\nwould lament him for his own sake, and had no congratulations for Philip\r\nhimself; and the \xe2\x80\x98Sure, sure, it must have been very bad for you,\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nwhich old Susan heard of the circumstances, carried more of the comfort\r\nof genuine sympathy than all his sister\xe2\x80\x99s attempts at condolence.\r\n\r\nShe told him how often Sir Guy had been at Stylehurst, how he had talked\r\nto her about the archdeacon; and especially she remembered his helping\r\nher husband one day when he found him trimming the ash over the\r\narchdeacon\xe2\x80\x99s grave. He used to come very often to church there, more in\r\nthe latter part of his stay; there was one Sunday--it was the one before\r\nMichaelmas--he was there all day, walking in the churchyard, and sitting\r\nin the porch between services.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Sunday before Michaelmas!\xe2\x80\x99 thought Philip, the very time when he\r\nhad been most earnest in driving his uncle to persecute, and delighting\r\nhimself in having triumphed over Guy at last, and obtained tangible\r\ndemonstration of his own foresight, and his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s vindictive spirit.\r\nWhat had he been throwing away? Where had, in truth, been the hostile\r\nspirit?\r\n\r\nHe took the key of the church, and walked thither alone, standing for\r\nseveral minutes by the three graves, with a sensation as if his father\r\nwas demanding of him an account of the boy he had watched, and brought\r\nto his ancestral home, and cared for through his orphaned childhood. But\r\nfor the prayer-book, the pledge that there had been peace at the last,\r\nhow could he have borne it?\r\n\r\nHere was the paved path he had trodden in early childhood, holding his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s hand, where, at each recurring vacation during his school days,\r\nhe had walked between his admiring sisters, in the consciousness that he\r\nwas the pride of his family and of all the parish. Of his family? Did he\r\nnot remember his return home for the last time before that when he was\r\nsummoned thither by his father\xe2\x80\x99s death? He had come with a whole freight\r\nof prizes, and letters full of praises; and as he stood, in expectation\r\nof the expression of delighted satisfaction, his father laid his hand\r\non his trophy, the pile of books, saying, gravely,--\xe2\x80\x99 All this would I\r\ngive, Philip, for one evidence of humility of mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt had been his father\xe2\x80\x99s one reproof. He had thought it unjust and\r\nunreasonable, and turned away impatiently to be caressed and admired by\r\nMargaret. His real feelings had been told to her, because she flattered\r\nthem and shared them, he had been reserved and guarded with the\r\nfather who would have perceived and repressed that ambition and the\r\nself-sufficiency which he himself had never known to exist, nor regarded\r\nas aught but sober truth. It had been his bane, that he had been always\r\ntoo sensible to betray outwardly his self-conceit, in any form that\r\ncould lead to its being noticed.\r\n\r\nHe opened the church door, closed it behind him, and locked himself in.\r\n\r\nHe came up to the communion rail, where he had knelt for the first time\r\ntwelve years ago, confident in himself, and unconscious of the fears\r\nwith which his father\xe2\x80\x99s voice was trembling in the intensity of his\r\nprayer for one in whom there was no tangible evil, and whom others\r\nthought a pattern of all that could be desired by the fondest hopes.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down, with bowed head, and hands clasped. Assuredly, if his\r\nfather could have beheld him then, it would have been with rejoicing. He\r\nwould not have sorrowed that robust frame was wasted, and great strength\r\nbrought low; that the noble features were worn, the healthful cheek\r\npale, and the powerful intellect clouded and weakened; he would hardly\r\nhave mourned for the cruel grief and suffering, such would have been\r\nhis joy that the humble, penitent, obedient heart had been won at last.\r\nAbove all, he would have rejoiced that the words that most soothed that\r\nwounded spirit were,--\xe2\x80\x98A broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not\r\ndespise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was solace in that solemn silence; the throbs of head and heart\r\nwere stilled in the calm around. It was as if the influences of the\r\nprayers breathed for him by his father, and the forgiveness and loving\r\nspirit there won by Guy, had been waiting for him there till he came to\r\ntake them up, for thenceforth the bitterest of his despair was over, and\r\nhe could receive each token of Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness, not as heaped coals\r\nof fire, but as an earnest of forgiveness sealed in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe worst was over, and though he still had much to suffer, he was\r\nbecoming open to receive comfort; the blank dark remorse in which he had\r\nbeen living began to lighten, and the tone of his mind to return.\r\n\r\nHe spoke more cheerfully to Susan when he restored the key; but she had\r\nbeen so shocked at his appearance, that when, the next day, a report\r\nreached her that Mr. Philip was now a grand gentleman, and very rich,\r\nshe answered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, if it be so, I am glad of it, but he said never a word of it to\r\nme, and it is my belief he would give all the money as ever was coined,\r\nto have the poor young gentleman back again. Depend upon it, he hates\r\nthe very sound of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt the cost of several sheets of paper, Philip at length completed a\r\nletter to Mr. Edmonstone, which, when he had sent it, made his suspense\r\nmore painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, March 12th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR MR. Edmonstone,--It is with a full sense of the unfitness of\r\nintruding such a subject upon you in the present state of the family,\r\nthat I again address you on the same topic as that on which I wrote to\r\nyou from Italy, at the first moment at which I have felt it possible\r\nto ask your attention. I was then too ill to be able to express my\r\ncontrition for all that has passed; in fact, I doubt whether it was even\r\nthen so deep as at present, since every succeeding week has but added\r\nto my sense of the impropriety of my conduct, and my earnest desire for\r\npardon. I can hardly venture at such a time to ask anything further, but\r\nI must add that my sentiments towards your daughter are unaltered, and\r\ncan never cease but with my life, and though I know I have rendered\r\nmyself unworthy of her, and my health, both mental and bodily, is far\r\nfrom being re-established, I cannot help laying my feelings before\r\nyou, and entreating that you will put an end to the suspense which has\r\nendured for so many months, by telling me to hope that I have not for\r\never forfeited your consent to my attachment. At least, I trust to your\r\nkindness for telling me on what terms I am for the present to stand with\r\nyour family. I am glad to hear such favourable reports of Lady Morville,\r\nand with all my heart I thank Charles for his letter.\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Yours ever affectionately,\r\n                \xe2\x80\x98P. H. MORVILLE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nHe ardently watched for a reply. He could not endure the idea of\r\nreceiving it where Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s eyes could scan the emotion he could\r\nnow only conceal by a visible rigidity of demeanour, and he daily\r\nwent himself to the post-office, but in vain. He received nothing but\r\nbusiness letters, and among them one from Markham, with as much defiance\r\nand dislike in its style as could be shown, in a perfectly formal,\r\nproper letter. Till he had referred to Lady Morville, he would not\r\nmake any demonstration towards Redclyffe, and evaded all his sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquestions as to what he was doing about it, and when he should take\r\nmeasures for leaving the army, or obtaining a renewal of the baronetcy.\r\n\r\nAnxiety made him look daily more wretchedly haggard; the Doctor was at\r\nfault, Mrs. Henley looked sagacious, while his manner became so dry\r\nand repellent that visitors went away moralizing on the absurdity of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnouveaux riches\xe2\x80\x9d taking so much state on them.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how soon he might venture to write to Amabel, on whom alone\r\nhe could depend; but he felt it a sort of profanity to disturb her.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly given up his visits to the post in despair, when one\r\nmorning he beheld what never failed to bring some soothing influence,\r\nnamely, the fair pointed characters he had not dared to hope for. He\r\nwalked quickly into the promenade, sat down, and read:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Hollywell, March 22nd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR PHILIP,--Papa does not answer your letter, because he says\r\nspeaking is better than writing, and we hope you are well enough to\r\ncome to us before Sunday week. I hope to take our dear little girl to\r\nbe christened on that day, and I want you to be so kind as to be\r\nher godfather. I ask it of you, not only in my own name, but in her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s, for I am sure it is what he would choose. Her Aunt Laura and\r\nMary Ross are to be her godmothers, I hope you will not think me very\r\nfoolish and fanciful for naming her Mary Verena, in remembrance of our\r\nold readings of Sintram. She is a very healthy, quiet creature, and I am\r\ngetting on very well. I am writing from the dressing-room, and I expect\r\nto be down-stairs in a few days. If you do not dislike it very much,\r\ncould you be so kind as to call upon Miss Wellwood, and pay little\r\nMarianne Dixon\xe2\x80\x99s quarter for me? It is \xc2\xa31O, and it will save trouble\r\nif you would do it; besides that, I should like to hear of her and the\r\nlittle girl. I am sorry to hear you are not better,--perhaps coming here\r\nmay do you good.--Four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I have been keeping my letter in hopes\r\nof persuading papa to put in a note, but he says he had rather send a\r\nmessage that he is quite ready to forgive and forget, and it will be\r\nbest to talk it over when you come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your affectionate cousin,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A. F. MORVILLE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was well he was not under his sister\xe2\x80\x99s eye, for he could not read\r\nthis letter calmly, and he was obliged to take several turns along\r\nthe walk before he could recover his composure enough to appear in the\r\nbreakfast-room, where he found his sister alone, dealing her letters\r\ninto separate packets of important and unimportant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good morning, Philip. Dr. Henley is obliged to go to Bramshaw this\r\nmorning, and has had an early breakfast. Have you been out?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, it is very fine--I mean it will be--the haze is clearing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMargaret saw that he was unusually agitated, and not by grief; applied\r\nherself to tea-making, and hoped his walk had given him an appetite; but\r\nthere seemed little chance of this so long were his pauses between each\r\nmorsel, and so often did he lean back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am going to leave you on--on Friday,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at length, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, are you going to Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; to Hollywell. Lady Morville wishes me to be her little girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsponsor; I shall go to London on Friday, and on, the next day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad they have asked you. Does she write herself? Is she pretty\r\nwell?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; she is to go down-stairs in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am rejoiced that she is recovering so well. Do you know whether she\r\nis in tolerable spirits?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She writes cheerfully.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How many years is it since I saw her? She was quite a child, but very\r\nsweet-tempered and attentive to poor Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Henley, feeling\r\nmost amiably disposed towards her future sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just so. Her gentleness and sweet temper were always beautiful; and\r\nshe has shown herself under her trials what it would be presumptuous to\r\npraise.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMargaret had no doubt now, and thought he was ready for more open\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must let me congratulate you now on this unexpected dawn of hope,\r\nafter your long trial, my dear brother. It is a sort of unconscious\r\nencouragement you could hardly hope for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know you knew anything of it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! my dear brother, you betrayed yourself. You need not be\r\ndisconcerted; only a sister could see the real cause of your want of\r\nspirits. Your manner at each mention of her, your anxiety, coupled with\r\nyour resolute avoidance of her--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of whom? Do you know what you are talking of, sister!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip,\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of Amabel, of course.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip rose, perfectly awful in his height and indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sister!\xe2\x80\x99 he said--paused, and began again. \xe2\x80\x98I have been attached to\r\nLaura Edmonstone for years past, and Lady Morville knows it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Henley, in amaze. \xe2\x80\x98Are you engaged?\xe2\x80\x99 and, as he\r\nwas hardly prepared to answer, she continued, \xe2\x80\x98If you have not gone too\r\nfar to recede, only consider before you take any rash step. You come\r\ninto this property without ready money, you will find endless claims,\r\nand if you marry at once, and without fortune, you will never be clear\r\nfrom difficulties.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have considered,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, with cold loftiness that would have\r\nsilenced any one, not of the same determined mould.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are positively committed, then!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, much vexed. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Philip!\r\nI did not think you would have married for mere beauty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can hear no more discussion on this point,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Philip, in the\r\nserious, calm tone that showed so much power over himself and every one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIt put Margaret to silence, though she was excessively disappointed to\r\nfind him thus involved just at his outset, when he might have married\r\nso much more advantageously. She was sorry, too, that she had shown her\r\nopinion so plainly, since it was to be, and hurt his feelings just as\r\nhe seemed to be thawing. She would fain have learned more; but he was\r\ncompletely shut up within himself, and never opened again to her. She\r\nhad never before so grated on every delicate feeling in his mind; and\r\nhe only remained at her house because in his present state of health,\r\nhe hardly knew where to bestow himself till it was time for him to go to\r\nHollywell.\r\n\r\nHe went to call on Miss Wellwood, to whom his name was no slight\r\nrecommendation, and she met him eagerly, asking after Lady Morville,\r\nwho, she said, had twice written to her most kindly about little\r\nMarianne.\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant visit, and a great relief. He looked at the\r\nplans, heard the fresh arrangements, admired, was interested, and took\r\npleasure in having something to tell Amabel. He asked for Marianne, and\r\nheard that she was one of the best of children--amiable, well-disposed,\r\nonly almost too sensitive. Miss Wellwood said it was remarkable how\r\ndeep an impression Sir Guy had made upon her, and how affectionately she\r\nremembered his kindness; and her distress at hearing of his death had\r\nbeen far beyond what such a child could have been supposed to feel, both\r\nin violence and in duration.\r\n\r\nPhilip asked to see her, knowing it would please Amabel, and in she\r\ncame--a long, thin, nine-year-old child, just grown into the encumbering\r\nshyness, that is by no means one of the graces of \xe2\x80\x9cla vieillesse de\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99enfance\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nHe wished to be kind and encouraging; but melancholy, added to his\r\nnatural stateliness, made him very formidable; and poor Marianne was\r\ncapable of nothing beyond \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98no.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe told her he was going to see Lady Morville and her little girl,\r\nwhereat she eagerly raised her eyes, then shrank in affright at anything\r\nso tall, and so unlike Sir Guy. He said the baby was to be christened\r\nnext Sunday, and Miss Wellwood helped him out by asking the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, for he was by no means inclined to explain the Verena,\r\nthough he knew not half what it conveyed to Amabel.\r\n\r\nLastly, he asked if Marianne had any message; when she hung down her\r\nhead, and whispered to Miss Wellwood, what proved to be \xe2\x80\x98My love to dear\r\nlittle cousin Mary.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe promised to deliver it, and departed, wishing he could more easily\r\nunbend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 40\r\n\r\n     Blest, though every tear that falls\r\n     Doth in its silence of past sorrow tell,\r\n     And makes a meeting seem most like a dear farewell.\r\n                                     --WORDSWORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday afternoon, about half-past five, Philip Morville found\r\nhimself driving up to the well-known front door of Hollywell. At the\r\ndoor he heard that every one was out excepting Lady Morville, who never\r\ncame down till the evening, save for a drive in the carriage.\r\n\r\nHe entered the drawing-room, and gazed on the scene where he had spent\r\nso many happy hours, only darkened by that one evil spot, that had\r\ngrown till it not only poisoned his own mind, but cast a gloom over that\r\nbright home.\r\n\r\nAll was as usual. Charles\xe2\x80\x99s sofa, little table, books, and inkstand, the\r\nwork-boxes on the table, the newspaper in Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s old folds.\r\nOnly the piano was closed, and an accumulation of books on the hinge\r\ntold how long it had been so; and the plants in the bay window were\r\nbrown and dry, not as when they were Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s cherished nurslings. He\r\nremembered Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s laughing face and abundant curls, when she carried\r\nin the camellia, and thought how little he guessed then that he should\r\nbe the destroyer of the happiness of her young life. How should he meet\r\nher--a widow in her father\xe2\x80\x99s house--or look at her fatherless child?\r\nHe wondered how he had borne to come thither at all, and shrank at the\r\nthought that this very evening, in a few hours, he must see her.\r\n\r\nThe outer door opened, there was a soft step, and Amabel stood before\r\nhim, pale, quiet, and with a smile of welcome. Her bands of hair looked\r\nglossy under her widow\xe2\x80\x99s cap, and the deep black of her dress was\r\nrelieved by the white robes of the babe that lay on her arm. She held\r\nout her hand, and he pressed it in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you would like just to see baby,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in a voice\r\nsomething like apology.\r\n\r\nHe held out his arms to take it, for which Amy was by no means prepared.\r\nShe was not quite happy even in trusting it in her sister\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and\r\nshe supposed he had never before touched an infant. But that was all\r\nnonsense, and she would not vex him with showing any reluctance; so she\r\nlaid the little one on his arm, and saw his great hand holding it most\r\ncarefully, but the next moment he turned abruptly from her. Poor silly\r\nlittle Amy, her heart beat not a little till he turned back, restored\r\nthe babe, and while he walked hastily to the window, she saw that two\r\nlarge tear-drops had fallen on the white folds of its mantle. She did\r\nnot speak; she guessed how much he must feel in thus holding Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild, and, besides, her own tears would now flow so easily that she\r\nmust be on her guard. She sat down, settled the little one on her knee,\r\nand gave him time to recover himself.\r\n\r\nPresently he came and stood by her saying, in a most decided tone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amabel, you must let me do this child justice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked up, wondering what he could mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not delay in taking steps for restoring her inheritance,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, hoping by determination to overpower Amabel, and make her believe it\r\na settled and a right thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O Philip, you are not thinking of that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is to be done.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not be so unkind to this poor little girl,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with a\r\npersuasive smile, partaking of her old playfulness, adding, very much\r\nin earnest, \xe2\x80\x98Pray put it out of your head directly, for it would be very\r\nwrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe nurse knocked at the door to fetch the baby, as Amabel had desired.\r\nWhen this interruption was over, Philip came and sat down opposite to\r\nher, and began with his most decided manner:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You must listen to me, Amy, and not allow any scruples to prevent you\r\nfrom permitting your child to be restored to her just rights. You must\r\nsee that the estate has come to me by circumstances such that no honest\r\nman can be justified in retaining it. The entail was made to exclude\r\nfemales, only because of the old Lady Granard. It is your duty to\r\nconsent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The property has always gone in the male line,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Amabel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There never was such a state of things. Old Sir Guy could never have\r\nthought of entailing it away from his own descendant on a distant\r\ncousin. It would be wrong of me to profit by these unforeseen\r\ncontingencies, and you ought not, in justice to your child, to object.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe spoke so forcibly and decidedly that he thought he must have\r\nprevailed. But not one whit convinced, Amabel answered, in her own\r\ngentle voice, but beginning with a business-like argument:--\xe2\x80\x98Such a\r\npossibility was contemplated. It was all provided for in the marriage\r\nsettlements. Indeed, I am afraid that, as it is, she will be a great\r\ndeal too rich. Besides, Philip, I am sure this is exactly what Guy would\r\nhave chosen,\xe2\x80\x99 and the tears rose in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98The first thing that came\r\ninto my head when she was born, was, that it was just what he wished,\r\nthat I should have her for myself, and that you should take care of\r\nRedclyffe. I am certain now that he hoped it would be so. I know--indeed\r\nI do--that he took great pleasure in thinking of its being in your\r\nhands, and of your going on with all he began. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have forgotten\r\nhow much he left in your charge? If you were to give it up, it would be\r\nagainst his desire; and with that knowledge, how could I suffer it?\r\nThen think what a misfortune to her, poor little thing, to be a great\r\nheiress, and how very bad for Redclyffe to have no better a manager\r\nthan me! Oh, Philip, can you not see it is best as it is, and just as he\r\nwished?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe almost groaned--\xe2\x80\x98If you could guess what a burden it is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! but you must carry it, not throw it down on such hands as mine and\r\nthat tiny baby\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would have been the same if it had been a boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; then I must have done the best I could, and there would have been\r\nan end to look to, but I am so glad to be spared. And you are so fit for\r\nit, and will make it turn to so much use to every one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as if I should ever be of use to any one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, in\r\na tone of complete dejection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your head is aching,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It always does, more or less,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, resting it on his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am so sorry. Has it been so ever since you were ill? But you are\r\nbetter? You look better than when I saw you last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am better on the whole, but I doubt whether I shall ever be as strong\r\nas I used to be. That ought to make me hesitate, even if--\xe2\x80\x99 then came a\r\npause, while he put his hand over his face, and seemed struggling with\r\nirrepressible emotion; and after all he was obliged to take two walks to\r\nthe window before he could recover composure, and could ask in a voice\r\nwhich he tried to make calm and steady, though his face was deeply\r\nflushed--\xe2\x80\x98Amy, how is Laura?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is very well,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98Only you must not be taken by\r\nsurprise if you see her looking thinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And she has trusted--she has endured through all?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, with\r\ninquiring earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And they--your father and mother--can forgive?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They do--they have. But, Philip, it was one of the things I came down\r\nto say to you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you must expect papa to begin about it\r\nhimself. You know he does not like awkwardness, though he will be very\r\nglad when once it is done, and ready to meet you half way.\xe2\x80\x99 He did not\r\nanswer, and after a silence Amabel added, \xe2\x80\x98Laura is out of doors. She\r\nand Charlotte take very long walks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And is she really strong and well, or is it that excited overdoing of\r\nemployment that I first set her upon?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She is perfectly well, and to be busy has been a great help to her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98It was a great comfort that we did not know how ill you\r\nhad been at Corfu, till the worst was over. Eveleen only mentioned it\r\nwhen you were better. I was very anxious, for I had some fears from the\r\nnote that you sent by Arnaud. I am very glad to see you safe here, for I\r\nhave felt all along that we forsook you; but I could not help it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very glad you did not stay. The worst of all would have been that\r\nyou should have run any risk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is the carriage,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Mamma and Charlie have been to\r\nBroadstone. They thought they might meet you by the late train.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s colour rose. He stood up--sat down; then rising once more,\r\nleant on the mantel-piece, scarcely knowing how to face either of\r\nthem--his aunt, with her well-merited displeasure, and Charles, who\r\nwhen he parted with him had accused him so justly--Charles, who had seen\r\nthrough him and had been treated with scorn.\r\n\r\nA few moments, and Charles came in, leaning on his mother. They both\r\nshook hands, exclaimed at finding Amabel downstairs, and Mrs. Edmonstone\r\nasked after Philip\xe2\x80\x99s health in her would-be cordial manner. The two\r\nladies then went up-stairs together, and thus ended that conference,\r\nin which both parties had shown rare magnanimity, of which they were\r\nperfectly unconscious; and perhaps the most remarkable part of all\r\nwas that Philip quietly gave up the great renunciation and so-called\r\nsacrifice, with which he had been feeding his hopes, at the simple\r\nbidding of the gentle-spoken Amabel--not even telling her that he\r\nresigned it. He kept the possessions which he abhorred, and gave up the\r\nrenunciation he had longed to make, and in this lay the true sacrifice,\r\nthe greater because the world would think him the gainer.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother and daughter were gone, the cousins were silent, Philip\r\nresting his elbow on the mantel-shelf and his head on his hand, and\r\nCharles sitting at the end of the sofa, warming first one hand, then the\r\nother, while he looked up to the altered face, and perceived in it grief\r\nand humiliation almost as plainly as illness. His keen eyes read that\r\nthe sorrow was indeed more deeply rooted than he had hitherto believed,\r\nand that Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s pity had not been wasted; and he was also struck by\r\nthe change from the great personal strength that used to make nothing of\r\nlifting his whole weight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to see you so pulled down,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98We must try if we can\r\ndoctor you better than they did at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s. Are you getting on, do\r\nyou think?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe had hardly ever spoken to Philip, so entirely without either\r\nbitterness or sarcasm, and his manner hardly seemed like that of the\r\nsame person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I am growing stronger; but as long as I cannot get rid of\r\nthis headache, I am good for nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have had a long spell of illness indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect to shake off two fevers in no time. Now all the anxiety is over,\r\nyou will brighten like this house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But tell me, what is thought of Amabel? Is she as well as she ought to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, quite, they say--has recovered her strength very fast, and is\r\nin just the right spirits. She was churched yesterday, and was not\r\nthe worse for it. It was a trial, for she had not been to East-hill\r\nsince--since last May.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a blessing, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has been so very happy with the baby,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98You hear what\r\nits name is to be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, she told me in her letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To avoid having to tell you here, I suppose. Mary is for common wear,\r\nVerena is for ourselves. She asked if it would be too foolish to give\r\nsuch a name, and mamma said the only question was, whether she would\r\nlike indifferent people to ask the reason of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip lapsed into thought, and presently said, abruptly, \xe2\x80\x98When last we\r\nparted you told me I was malignant. You were right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shake hands!\xe2\x80\x99 was all Charles\xe2\x80\x99s reply, and no more was said till\r\nCharles rose, saying it was time to dress. Philip was about to help him,\r\nbut he answered, \xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, I am above trusting to anything but my\r\nown crutches now; I am proud to show you what feats I can perform.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles certainly did get on with less difficulty than heretofore, but\r\nit was more because he wanted to spare Philip fatigue than because he\r\ndisdained assistance, that he chose to go alone. Moreover, he did what\r\nhe had never done for any one before--he actually hopped the whole\r\nlength of the passage, beyond his own door to do the honours of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and took a degree of pains for his comfort that seemed too\r\nmarvellous to be true in one who had hitherto only lived to be attended\r\non.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had settled Philip, the rest of the party had come home,\r\nand he found himself wanted in the dressing-room, to help his mother\r\nto encourage his father to enter on the conversation with Philip in the\r\nevening, for poor Mr. Edmonstone was in such a worry and perplexity,\r\nthat the whole space till the dinner-bell rang was insufficient to\r\nconsole him in. Laura, meanwhile, was with Amabel, who was trying to\r\ncheer her fluttering spirits and nerves, which, after having been so\r\nlong harassed, gave way entirely at the moment of meeting Philip again.\r\nHow would he regard her after her weakness in betraying him for want\r\nof self-command? Might he not be wishing to be free of one who had so\r\ndisappointed him, and only persisting in the engagement from a sense of\r\nhonour! The confidence in his affection, which had hitherto sustained\r\nher, was failing; and not all Amabel could say would reassure her. No\r\none could judge of him but herself, his words were so cautious, and he\r\nhad so much command over himself, that nobody could guess. Of course he\r\nfelt bound to her; but if she saw one trace of his being only influenced\r\nby honour and pity, she would release him, and he should never see the\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nShe had worked herself up into almost a certainty that so it would be,\r\nand Amabel was afraid she would not be fit to go down to dinner; but the\r\nsound of the bell, and the necessity of moving, seemed to restore the\r\nhabit of external composure in a moment. She settled her countenance,\r\nand left the room.\r\n\r\nCharlotte, meantime, had been dressing alone, and raging against Philip,\r\ndeclaring she could never bear to speak to him, and that if she was Amy\r\nshe would never have chosen him for a godfather. And to think of his\r\nmarrying just like a good hero in a book, and living very happy ever\r\nafter! To be sure she was sorry for poor Laura; but it was all very\r\nwrong, and now they would be rewarded! How could Charlie be so provoking\r\nas to talk about his sorrow! She hoped he was sorry; and as to his\r\nillness, it served him right.\r\n\r\nAll this Charlotte communicated to Bustle; but Bustle had heard some\r\nmysterious noise, and insisted on going to investigate the cause; and\r\nCharlotte, finding her own domain dark and cold, and private conferences\r\ngoing on in Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s apartment and the dressing-room, was fain to follow\r\nhim down-stairs, as soon as her toilet was complete, only hoping Philip\r\nwould keep out of the way.\r\n\r\nBut, behold, there he was; and even Bustle was propitiated, for she\r\nfound him, his nose on Philip\xe2\x80\x99s knee, looking up in his face, and\r\nwagging his tail, while Philip stroked and patted him, and could hardly\r\nbear the appealing expression of the eyes, that, always wistful, now\r\nseemed to every one to be looking for his master.\r\n\r\nTo see this attention to Bustle won Charlotte over in a moment. \xe2\x80\x98How are\r\nyou, Philip? Good dog, dear old Bustle!\xe2\x80\x99 came in a breath, and they were\r\nboth making much of the dog, when she amicably asked if he had seen the\r\nbaby, and became eager in telling about the christening.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell brought every one down but Amabel. The trembling hands\r\nof Philip and Laura met for a moment, and they were in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nDiligently and dutifully did Charles and Mrs. Edmonstone keep up the\r\nconversation; the latter about her shopping, the former about the\r\nacquaintances who had come to speak to him as he sat in the carriage. As\r\nsoon as possible, Mrs. Edmonstone left the dining-room, then Laura flew\r\nup again to the dressing-room, sank down on a footstool by Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, and exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98O Amy, he is looking so ill!\xe2\x80\x99 burst into a flood\r\nof tears.\r\n\r\nThe change had been a shock for which Laura had not been prepared.\r\nAmy, who had seen him look so much worse, had not thought of it, and\r\nit overcame Laura more than all her anxieties, lest his love should be\r\nforfeited. She sobbed inconsolably over the alteration, and it was long\r\nbefore Amabel could get her to hear that his face was much less thin\r\nnow, and that he was altogether much stronger; it was fatigue and\r\nanxiety to-night, and to-morrow he would be better. Laura proceeded\r\nto brood over her belief that his altered demeanour, his settled\r\nmelancholy, his not seeking her eye, his cold shake of the hand, all\r\narose from the diminution of his love, and his dislike to be encumbered\r\nwith a weak, foolish wife, with whom he had entangled himself when he\r\ndeemed her worthy of him. She dwelt on all this in silence, as she\r\nsat at her sister\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and Amy left her to think, only now and then\r\ngiving some caress to her hair or cheek, and at each touch the desolate\r\nwaste of life that poor Laura was unfolding before herself was rendered\r\nless dreary by the thought, \xe2\x80\x98I have my sister still, and she knows\r\nsorrow too.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she half envied Amy, who had lost her dearest by\r\ndeath, and held his heart fast to the last; not, like herself, doomed to\r\nsee the love decay for which she had endured so long--decay at the very\r\nmoment when the suspense was over.\r\n\r\nLaura might justly have envied Amabel, though for another reason; it was\r\nbecause in her cup there was no poison of her own infusing.\r\n\r\nThere she stayed till Charlotte came to summon her to tea, saying the\r\ngentlemen, except Charles, were still in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThey had remained sitting over the fire for a considerable space,\r\nwaiting for each other to begin, Mr. Edmonstone irresolute, Philip\r\nstriving to master his feelings, and to prevent increasing pain and\r\nconfusion from making him forget what he intended, to say. At last, Mr.\r\nEdmonstone started up, pulled out his keys, took a candle, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come to the study--I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the Redclyffe papers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, also rising, but only because he could not sit\r\nwhile his uncle stood. \xe2\x80\x98Not to-night, if you please. I could not attend\r\nto them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What, your head? Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Partly. Besides, there is another subject on which I hope you will set\r\nme at rest before I can enter on any other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--yes--I know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Edmonstone, moving uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am perfectly conscious how deeply I have offended.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Edmonstone could not endure the apology.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, well,\xe2\x80\x99 he broke in nervously, \xe2\x80\x98I know all that, and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nhelped. Say no more about it. Young people will be foolish, and I have\r\nbeen young and in love myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat Captain Morville should live to be thankful for being forgiven in\r\nconsideration of Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s having been young!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I then consider myself as pardoned, and as having obtained your\r\nsanction?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, yes; and I hope it will cheer poor Laura up again a little.\r\nFour years has it gone on? Constancy, indeed! and it is time it should\r\nbe rewarded. We little thought what you were up to, so grave and demure\r\nas you both were. So you won\xe2\x80\x99t have the papers to-night? I can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nyou do look fit for business. Perhaps Laura may suit you better--eh,\r\nPhilip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLove-making was such a charming sight to Mr. Edmonstone, that having\r\nonce begun to look on Philip and Laura as a pair of lovers, he could not\r\nhelp being delighted, and forgetting, as well as forgiving, all that had\r\nbeen wrong.\r\n\r\nThey did not, however, exactly answer his ideas; Laura did not once look\r\nup, and Philip, instead of going boldly to take the place next her, sat\r\ndown, holding his hand to his forehead, as if too much overpowered by\r\nindisposition to think of anything else. Such was in great measure the\r\ncase; he was very much fatigued with the journey, and these different\r\nagitating scenes had increased the pain in his head to a violent degree;\r\nbesides which, feeling that his aunt still regarded him as she did\r\nat Recoara, he could not bear to make any demonstration towards Laura\r\nbefore her, lest she might think it a sort of triumphant disregard of\r\nher just displeasure.\r\n\r\nPoor Laura saw in it both severe suffering and dislike to her; and the\r\nmore she understood from her father\xe2\x80\x99s manner what had passed in the\r\nother room, the more she honoured him for the sacrifice he was making of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone waited on the headache with painful attention, but they\r\nall felt that the only thing to be done for the two poor things was\r\nto let them come to an explanation; so Charlotte was sent to bed, her\r\nmother went up to Amy, Charles carried off his father to the study, and\r\nthey found themselves alone.\r\n\r\nLaura held down her face, and struggled to make her palpitating heart\r\nand dry tongue suffer her to begin the words to which she had wound\r\nherself up. Philip raised his hands from his eyes as the door shut, then\r\nrose up, and fixed them on Laura. She, too, looked up, as if to begin;\r\ntheir eyes met, and they understood all. He stepped towards her, and\r\nheld out his hands. The next moment both hers were clasped in his--he\r\nhad bent down and kissed her brow.\r\n\r\nNo words of explanation passed between them. Laura knew he was her own,\r\nand needed no assurance that her misgivings had been vain. There was a\r\nstart of extreme joy, such as she had known twice before, but it could\r\nbe only for a moment while he looked so wretchedly unwell. It did but\r\ngive her the right to attend to him. The first thing she said was to beg\r\nhim to lie down on the sofa; her only care was to make him comfortable\r\nwith cushions, and he was too entirely worn out to say anything he had\r\nintended, capable only of giving himself up to the repose of knowing her\r\nentirely his own, and of having her to take care of him. There he lay\r\non the sofa, with his eyes shut, and Laura\xe2\x80\x99s hand in his, while she sat\r\nbeside him, neither of them speaking; and, excepting that she withdrew\r\nher hand, neither moved when the others returned.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone compassionated him, and showed a great deal of\r\nsolicitude about him, trying hard to regard him as she used to do, yet\r\nunable to bring back the feeling, and therefore, do what she would,\r\nfailing to wear its semblance.\r\n\r\nLaura, sad, anxious, and restless, had no relief till she went to wish\r\nher sister good night. Amabel, who was already in bed, stretched out her\r\nhand with a sweet look, beaming with affection and congratulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be convinced now that all is right!\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98His head is so dreadfully bad!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! it will get better now his mind is at rest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it will but do so!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you know you must be happy to-morrow, because of baby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, coming in, \xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to prevent your\r\ntalk, but Amy must not be kept awake. She must keep her strength for\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, then, dear, dear Laura. I am so glad your trouble is over,\r\nand you have him again!\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Amabel, with her parting kiss; and\r\nLaura went away, better able to hope, to pray, and to rest, than she\r\ncould have thought possible when she left the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor dear Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, sighing; \xe2\x80\x98I hope he will soon\r\nbe better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has it been very uncomfortable?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say much for it, my dear. He was suffering terribly with his\r\nhead, so that I should have been quite alarmed if he had not said it was\r\napt to get worse in the evening; and she, poor thing, was only watching\r\nhim. However, it is a comfort to have matters settled; and papa and\r\nCharlie are well pleased with him. But I must not keep you awake after\r\ndriving Laura away. You are not over-tired to-night I hope, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; only sleepy. Good night, dearest mamma.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good night, my own Amy;\xe2\x80\x99 then, as Amy put back the coverings to show\r\nthe little face nestled to sleep on her bosom, \xe2\x80\x98good night, you little\r\ndarling! don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb your mamma. How comfortable you look! Good night,\r\nmy dearest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone looked for a moment, while trying to check the tears\r\nthat came at the thought of the night, one brief year ago, when she left\r\nAmy sleeping in the light of the Easter moon. Yet the sense of peace and\r\nserenity that had then given especial loveliness to the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchamber on that night, was there still with the young widow. It was dim\r\nlamplight now that beamed on the portrait of her husband, casting on it\r\nthe shade of the little wooden cross in front, while she was shaded by\r\nthe white curtains drawn from her bed round the infant\xe2\x80\x99s little cot,\r\nso as to shut them both into the quiet twilight, where she lay with\r\nan expression of countenance that, though it was not sorrow, made Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone more ready to weep than if it had been; so with her last good\r\nnight she left her.\r\n\r\nAnd Amabel always liked to be shut in by herself, dearly as she loved\r\nthem all, and mamma especially; there was always something pleasant in\r\nbeing able to return to her own world, to rest in the thoughts of her\r\nhusband, and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that\r\nhad come to inhabit that inner world of hers, the creature that was only\r\nhis and hers.\r\n\r\nShe had from the first always felt herself less lonely when quite\r\nalone, before with his papers, and now with his child; and could Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone have seen her face, she would have wept and wondered more, as\r\nAmy fondled and hushed her babe, whispering to it fond words which she\r\ncould never have uttered in the presence of any one who could understand\r\nthem, and which had much of her extreme youthfulness in them. Not one\r\nwas so often repeated or so endearing as \xe2\x80\x98Guy\xe2\x80\x99s baby! Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own dear\r\nlittle girl!\xe2\x80\x99 It did not mean half so much when she called it her baby;\r\nand she loved to tell the little one that her father had been the best\r\nand the dearest, but he was gone away, and would she be contented to be\r\nloving and good with only her mother to take care of her, and tell her,\r\nas well as she could, what a father hers was, when she was old enough to\r\nknow about him?\r\n\r\nTo-night, Amy told her much in that soft, solemn, murmuring tone, about\r\nwhat was to befall her to-morrow, and the great blessings to be given\r\nto her, and how the poor little fatherless one would be embraced in the\r\narms of His mercy, and received by her great Father in heaven:--\xe2\x80\x98Ay, and\r\nbrought nearer to your own papa, and know him in some inner way, and he\r\nwill know his little child then, for you will be as good and pure and\r\nbright as he, and you will belong to the great communion of saints\r\nto-morrow, you precious little one, and be so much nearer to him as you\r\nwill be so much better than I. Oh! baby, if we can but both endure to\r\nthe end!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith such half-uttered words, Amabel Morville slept the night before her\r\nbabe\xe2\x80\x99s christening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 41\r\n\r\n     A stranger\xe2\x80\x99s roof to hold thy head,\r\n     A stranger\xe2\x80\x99s foot thy grave to tread;\r\n     Desert and rock, and Alp and sea,\r\n     Spreading between thy home and thee.\r\n                            --SEWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Ross was eager for the first report from Hollywell the next\r\nmorning, and had some difficulty in keeping her attention fixed on her\r\nclass at school. Laura and Charlotte came in together in due time, and\r\nsatisfied her so far as to tell her that Amy was very well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Captain Morville come?\xe2\x80\x99 thought Mary. \xe2\x80\x98No, I cannot guess by Laura\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpressive face. Never mind, Charles will tell me all between services.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe first thing she saw on coming out of school was the pony carriage,\r\nwith Charles and Captain Morville himself. Charlotte, who was all\r\nexcitement, had time to say, while her sister was out of hearing,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all made up now, Mary, and I really am very sorry for Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that Mary understood the amiable meaning this speech\r\nwas intended to convey, and she began to enter into its grounds in the\r\nshort conference after church, when she saw the alteration in the whole\r\nexpression of countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, who as usual remained at the vicarage during the\r\ntwo services, and who perceived what passed in her mind, \xe2\x80\x98if it is any\r\nsatisfaction to you to have a good opinion of your fellow-sponsor, I\r\nassure you that I am converted to Amy\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. I do believe the black\r\ndog is off his back for good and all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I never saw any one more changed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Regularly tamed,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. He is something more like his old self\r\nto-day than last night, and yet not much. He was perfectly overpowered\r\nthen--so knocked up that there was no judging of him. To-day he has all\r\nhis sedateness and scrupulous attention, but all like a shadow of former\r\ntime--not a morsel of sententiousness, and seeming positively grateful\r\nto be treated in the old fashion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He looks very thin and pale. Do you think him recovered?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A good way from it,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98He is pretty well to-day,\r\ncomparatively, though that obstinate headache hangs about him. If this\r\nchange last longer than that and his white looks, I shall not even\r\ngrudge him the sponsorship Amy owed me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very magnanimous!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98Poor Laura! I am glad her suspense is\r\nover. I wondered to see her at school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They are very sad and sober lovers, and it is the best way of not\r\nmaking themselves unbearable, considering--Well, that was a different\r\nmatter. How little we should have believed it, if any one had told us\r\nlast year what would be the state of affairs to-day. By the bye, Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngodson is christened to-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear that the Ashfords managed to get Amy asked if she would\r\ndislike their calling their boy by that name we shall never hear again,\r\nand she was very much pleased, and made offer in her own pretty way to\r\nbe godmother. I wonder how Markham endures it! I believe he is nearly\r\ncrazy. He wrote me word he should certainly have given up all concern\r\nwith Redclyffe, but for the especial desire of--.What a state of mind\r\nhe will be in, when he remembers how he has been abusing the captain to\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was fresh and clear, and there was a spring brightness in\r\nthe sunshine that Amabel took as a greeting to her little maiden, as\r\nshe was carried along the churchyard path. Many an eye was bent on the\r\nmother and child, especially on the slight form, unseen since she had\r\nlast walked down the aisle, her arm linked in her bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little Amy Edmonstone,\xe2\x80\x99 as they had scarcely learnt to cease from\r\ncalling her, before she was among them again, the widowed Lady Morville;\r\nand with those kind looks of compassion for her, were joined many\r\naffectionate mourning thoughts of the young husband and father, lying\r\nfar away in his foreign grave, and endeared by kindly remembrances to\r\nalmost all present. There was much of pity for his unconscious infant,\r\nand tears were shed at the thought of what the wife must be suffering;\r\nbut if the face could have been seen beneath the thick crape folds\r\nof her veil, it would have shown no tears--only a sweet, calm look of\r\npeace, and almost gladness.\r\n\r\nThe babe was on her knees when the time for the christening came; she\r\nwas awake, and now and then making a little sound and as she was quieter\r\nwith her than any one else, Amabel thought she might herself carry her\r\nto the font.\r\n\r\nIt was deep, grave happiness to stand there, with her child in her arms,\r\nand with an undefined sense that she was not alone as if in some manner\r\nher husband was present with her; praying with her prayers, and joining\r\nin offering up their treasure; when the babe was received into Mr.\r\nRoss\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and Amy, putting back her veil, gazed up with a wistful but\r\nserene look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To her life\xe2\x80\x99s end?\xe2\x80\x99 Therewith came a vision of the sunrise at Recoara,\r\nand the more glorious dawn that had shone in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s dying smile, and\r\nAmabel knew what would be her best prayer for his little Mary Verena, as\r\nshe took her back, the drops glistening on her brow, her eyes open, and\r\narms outspread. It was at that moment that Amabel was first thrilled\r\nwith a look in her child that was like its father. She had earnestly and\r\noften sought a resemblance without being able honestly to own that she\r\nperceived any; but now, though she knew not in what it consisted, there\r\nwas something in that baby face that recalled him more vividly than\r\npicture or memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThose words seemed to come from her own heart. She had brought Guy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter to be baptized, and completed his work of pardon, and she had a\r\nyearning to be departing in peace, whither her sunshine was gone. But he\r\nhad told her not to wish that his child should be motherless; she had\r\nto train her to be fit to meet him. The sunshine was past, but she\r\nhad plenty to do in the shade, and it was for his sake. She would,\r\ntherefore, be content to remain to fulfil her duties among the dear ones\r\nto whom he had trusted her for comfort, and with the sense of renewed\r\ncommunion with him that she had found in returning again to church.\r\n\r\nSo felt Amabel, as she entered into the calm that followed the one year\r\nin which she had passed through the great events of life, and known the\r\nchief joy and deepest grief that she could ever experience.\r\n\r\nIt was far otherwise with her sister. Laura\xe2\x80\x99s term of trouble seemed to\r\nbe ending, and the spring of life beginning to dawn on her.\r\n\r\nDoubt and fear were past, she and Philip were secure of each other,\r\nhe was pardoned, and they could be together without apprehension, or\r\nplaying tricks with their consciences; but she had as yet scarcely been\r\nable to spend any time with him; and as Charles said, their ways were\r\nfar more grave and less lover-like than would have seemed natural after\r\ntheir long separation.\r\n\r\nIn truth, romantic and uncalculating as their attachment was, they\r\nnever had been lover-like. They had never had any fears or doubts; her\r\nsurrender of her soul had been total, and every thought, feeling, and\r\njudgment had taken its colour from him as entirely as if she had been a\r\nwife of many years\xe2\x80\x99 standing. She never opened her mind to perceive that\r\nhe had led her to act wrongly, and all her unhappiness had been from\r\nanxiety for him, not repentance on her own account; for so complete was\r\nher idolatry, that she entirely overlooked her failure in duty to her\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nIt took her by surprise when, as they set out together that evening to\r\nwalk home from East-hill, he said, as soon as they were apart from the\r\nvillage--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, you have more to forgive than all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, speak so, Philip, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t. Do you think I would not have\r\nborne far more unhappiness willingly for your sake? Is it not all\r\nforgotten as if it had not been?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not unhappiness I meant,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98though I cannot bear\r\nto think of what you have undergone. Unhappiness enough have I caused\r\nindeed. But I meant, that you have to forgive the advantage I took of\r\nyour reliance on me to lead you into error, when you were too young to\r\nknow what it amounted to.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not an engagement,\xe2\x80\x99 faltered Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Laura, don\xe2\x80\x99t, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, recall my own hateful sophistries,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed Philip, as if unable to control the pain it gave him; \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nhad enough of that from my sister;\xe2\x80\x99 then softening instantly: \xe2\x80\x98it was\r\nself-deceit; a deception first of myself, then of you. You had not\r\nexperience enough to know whither I was leading you, till I had involved\r\nyou; and when the sight of death showed me the fallacy of the salve to\r\nmy conscience, I had nothing for it but to confess, and leave you to\r\nbear the consequences. O Laura! when I think of my conduct towards you,\r\nit seems even worse than that towards--towards your brother-in-law!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis low, stern tone of bitter suffering and self-reproach was something\r\nnew and frightful to Laura. She clung to his arm and tried to say--\xe2\x80\x98O,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t speak in that way! You know you meant the best. You could not help\r\nbeing mistaken.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I did know any such thing, Laura! but the misery of perceiving that\r\nmy imagined anxiety for his good,--his good, indeed! was but a cloak for\r\nmy personal enmity--you can little guess it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura tried to say that appearances were against Guy, but he would not\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If they were, I triumphed in them. I see now that a shade of honest\r\ndesire to see him exculpated would have enabled me to find the clue. If\r\nI had gone to St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s at once--interrogated him as a friend--seen\r\nWellwood--but dwelling on the _ifs_ of the last two years can bring\r\nnothing but distraction,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, pausing suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And remember,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, \xe2\x80\x98that dear Guy himself was always grateful\r\nto you. He always upheld that you acted for his good. Oh! the way he\r\ntook it was the one comfort I had last year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The acutest sting, and yet the only balm,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Philip; \xe2\x80\x98see,\r\nLaura,\xe2\x80\x99 and he opened the first leaf of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s prayer-book, which he had\r\nbeen using at the christening.\r\n\r\nA whispered \xe2\x80\x98Dear Guy!\xe2\x80\x99 was the best answer she could make, and the\r\ntears were in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98He was so very kind to me, when he saw me that\r\nunhappy wedding-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did Amy tell you his last words to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God bless you and my sister!\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated, so low that she could hardly\r\nhear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy left that for you to tell,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, as her tears streamed fast.\r\nHow can we speak of her, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only as an angel of pardon and peace!\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to tell you of all her kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; \xe2\x80\x98half\r\nthe bitterness of it seemed to be over when once she was in the house\r\nagain, and, all the winter, going into her room was like going into some\r\npeaceful place where one must find comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSpirits of peace, where are ye\xe2\x80\x9d I could have said, when I saw her\r\ndrive away at Recoara, and carry all good angels with her except those\r\nthat could not but hover round that grave.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How very sad it must have been! Did--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of it; don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me of it\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, hastily. \xe2\x80\x98There\r\nis nothing in my mind but a tumult of horror and darkness that it is\r\nmadness to remember. Tell me of yourself--tell me that you have not been\r\nhurt by all that I have brought on you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura \xe2\x80\x98besides, that is all at an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All an end! Laura, I fear in joining your fate to mine, you will find\r\ncare and grief by no means at an end. You must be content to marry a\r\nsaddened, remorseful man, broken down in health and spirits, his\r\nwhole life embittered by that fatal remembrance, forced to endure an\r\ninheritance that seems to have come like the prosperity of the wicked.\r\nYet you are ready to take all this? Then, Laura, that precious, most\r\nprecious love, that has endured through all, will be the one drop of\r\ncomfort through the rest of my life.\r\n\r\nShe could but hear such words with thrills of rejoicing affection; and\r\non they walked, Laura trembling and struck with sorrow at the depth of\r\nrepentance he now and then disclosed, though not in the least able to\r\nfathom it, thinking it all his nobleness of mind, justifying him to\r\nherself, idolizing him too much to own he had ever been wrong; yet the\r\ninnate power of tact and sympathy teaching her no longer to combat\r\nhis self-reproaches, and repeat his former excuses, but rather to say\r\nsomething soothing and caressing, or put in some note of thankfulness\r\nand admiration of Amy and Guy. This was the best thing she could do\r\nfor him, as she was not capable, like Amy, of acknowledging that his\r\nrepentance was well-founded. She was a nurse, not a physician, to\r\nthe wounded spirit; but a very good and gentle nurse she was, and the\r\nthorough enjoyment of her affection and sympathy, the opening into\r\nconfidence, and the freedom from doubt and suspense, were comforts that\r\nwere doing him good every hour.\r\n\r\nThe christening party consisted only of the Rosses, and Dr. Mayerne,\r\nwho had joined them at East-hill church, and walked home with Mr.\r\nEdmonstone. They could not have been without him, so grateful were they\r\nfor his kindness all through their anxious winter, and Mr. Edmonstone\r\nwas well pleased to tell him on the way home that they might look to\r\nhaving a wedding in the family; it had been a very long attachment,\r\nconstancy as good as a story, and he could all along have told what was\r\nthe matter, when mamma was calling in the doctor to account for Laura\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlooking pale.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was not surprised at the news, for perhaps he, too, had had\r\nsome private theory about those pale looks; but, knowing pretty well\r\nthe sentiments Charles had entertained the winter before last, he was\r\ncurious to find out how he regarded this engagement. Charles spoke of\r\nit in the most ready cordial way. \xe2\x80\x98Well, doctor, so you have heard our\r\nnews! I flatter myself we have as tall and handsome a pair of lovers to\r\nexhibit here, as any in the United Kingdom, when we have fattened him a\r\nlittle into condition.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never was there a better match,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dr. Mayerne. \xe2\x80\x98Made for each\r\nother all along. One could not see them without feeling it was the first\r\nchapter of a novel.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Edmonstone came in, the doctor was a little taken aback. He\r\nthought her mind must be with poor Sir Guy, and was afraid the lovers\r\nhad been in such haste as to pain Lady Morville; for there was a\r\nstaidness and want of \xe2\x80\x9cepanchement du coeur\xe2\x80\x9d of answering that was very\r\nunlike her usual warm manner. At dinner, Mr. Edmonstone was in high\r\nspirits, delighted at Amy\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, happy to have a young man about\r\nthe house again, charmed to see two lovers together, pleased that Laura\r\nshould be mistress of Redclyffe, since it could not belong to Amy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild; altogether, as joyous as ever. His wife, being at ease about Amy,\r\ndid her best to smile, and even laugh, though sad at heart all the time,\r\nas she missed the father from the christening feast, and thought how\r\nhappy she had been in that far different reunion last year. It might be\r\nthe same with Charles; but the outward effect was exhibited in lively\r\nnonsense; Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s spirits were rising fast, and only Philip and\r\nLaura themselves were grave and silent, she, the more so, because she\r\nwas disappointed to find that the one walk back from East-hill, much as\r\nhe had enjoyed it, had greatly tired Philip. However, the others talked\r\nenough without them; and Mr. Edmonstone was very happy, drinking the\r\nhealth of Miss Morville, and himself carrying a bit of the christening\r\ncake to the mamma in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThere sat Amabel by the fire, knowing that from henceforth she must\r\nexert herself to take part in the cheerfulness of the house, and willing\r\nto join the external rejoicing in her child\xe2\x80\x99s christening, or at least\r\nnot to damp it by remaining up-stairs. Yet any one but Mr. Edmonstone\r\nwould have seen more sadness than pleasure in the sweet smile with\r\nwhich she met and thanked him; but they were cheerful tones in which she\r\nreplied, and in her presence everything was hushed and gentle, subdued,\r\nyet not mournful. The spirit of that evening was only recognized after\r\nit was past, and then it ever grew fairer and sweeter in recollection,\r\nso as never to be forgotten by any of those who shared it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 42\r\n\r\n     She was not changed when sorrow came,\r\n       That awed the sternest men;\r\n     It rather seemed she kept her flame\r\n       To comfort us till then.\r\n\r\n     But sorrow passed, and others smiled\r\n       With happiness once more;\r\n     And she drew back the spirit mild\r\n       She still had been before.\r\n                              --S. R.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilip\xe2\x80\x99s marriage could not take place at once. No one said, but every\r\none felt, that it must not be talked of till the end of Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nyear of widowhood; and in the meantime Philip remained at Hollywell,\r\ngaining strength every day, making more progress in one week than he had\r\ndone in six at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, finding that, as his strength returned,\r\nhis mind and memory regained their tone, and he was as capable as ever\r\nof applying to business, and, above all, much settled and comforted by\r\nsome long conversations with Mr. Ross.\r\n\r\nStill he could not endure the thought of being at Redclyffe. The\r\nbusiness connected with it was always performed with pain and dislike,\r\nand he shrank with suffering at every casual mention of his going\r\nthither. Mrs. Edmonstone began to wonder whether he could mean to linger\r\nat Hollywell all the summer, and Amabel had some fears that it would end\r\nin his neglecting Redclyffe, till a letter arrived from Lord Thorndale,\r\nsaying that his brother, the member for Moorworth, had long been\r\nthinking of giving up his seat, and latterly had only waited in\r\nhopes that the succession at Redclyffe might come to Philip Morville.\r\nMoorworth was entirely under the Thorndale and Morville interest, and\r\nLord Thorndale wrote to propose that Philip should come forward at once,\r\ninviting him to Thorndale instead of going to his own empty house.\r\n\r\nTo be in parliament had been one of the favourite visions of Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyouth, and for that very reason he hesitated, taking it as one of the\r\nstrange fulfilments of his desires that had become punishments. He could\r\nnot but feel that as this unhappy load of wealth had descended on him,\r\nhe was bound to make it as beneficial as he could to others, and not\r\nseeking for rest or luxury, to stand in the gap where every good man and\r\ntrue was needed. But still he dreaded his old love of distinction. He\r\ndisliked a London life for Laura, and he thought that, precarious as\r\nhis health had become, it might expose her to much anxiety, since he\r\nwas determined that if he undertook it at all, he would never be an idle\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nIt ended in his referring the decision to Laura, who, disliking London,\r\nfearful for his health, eager for his glory, and reluctant to keep back\r\nsuch a champion from the battle, was much perplexed, only desirous to\r\nsay what he wished, yet not able to make out what that might be. She\r\ncarried her doubts to Charles and Amabel, who both pronounced that the\r\nthought of going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for him than any degree\r\nof employment--that occupation of the mind was the best thing for his\r\nspirits; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should be consulted.\r\n\r\nHe was of the same opinion. He said a man could hardly have two fevers\r\nfollowing, and one of them upon the brain, without having reason to\r\nremember them. That his constitution had been seriously weakened, and\r\nthere was an excitability of brain and nerves which made care requisite;\r\nbut depression of spirits was the chief thing to guard against, and a\r\nLondon life, provided he did not overwork himself, was better for him\r\nthan solitude at Redclyffe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Philip went to Thorndale, and was returned for Moorworth\r\nwithout opposition. Markham sent his nephew to transact business with\r\nhim at Thorndale, for he could not bear to meet him himself, and while\r\nthere was any prospect of his coming to Redclyffe, walked about in\r\nparoxysms of grunting and ill-humour. The report that Mr. Morville was\r\nengaged to the other Miss Edmonstone did but render him more furious,\r\nfor he regarded it as a sort of outrage to Lady Morville\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nthat a courtship should be carried on in the house with her. She was at\r\npresent the object of all his devoted affection for the family, and he\r\nwould not believe, but that she had been as much disappointed at the\r\nbirth of her daughter, as he was himself. He would not say one word\r\nagainst Mr. Morville, but looked and growled enough to make Mr. Ashford\r\nafraid that the new squire would find him very troublesome.\r\n\r\nThe Ashfords were in a state of mind themselves to think that Mr.\r\nMorville ought to be everything excellent to make up for succeeding Sir\r\nGuy; but having a very high opinion of him to begin with, they were very\r\nsorry to find all Redclyffe set against him. In common with the parish,\r\nthey were very anxious for the first report of his arrival and at length\r\nhe came. James Thorndale, as before, drove him thither, coming to the\r\nAshfords while he was busy with Markham. He would not go up to the Park,\r\nhe only went through some necessary business with Markham, and then\r\nwalked down to the Cove, afterwards sitting for about ten minutes in\r\nMrs. Ashford\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe result of the visit was that old James Robinson reported that the\r\nnew squire took on as much about poor Sir Guy as any one could do, and\r\nturned as pale as if he had been going into a swoon, when he spoke his\r\nname and gave Ben his message. And as to poor Ben, the old man said, he\r\nregularly did cry like a child, and small blame to him, to hear that\r\nSir Guy had took thought of him at such a time and so far away; and he\r\nverily believed Ben could never take again to his bad ways, after such a\r\nmessage as that.\r\n\r\nMarkham was gruff with the Robinsons for some time after and was even\r\nheard to mutter something about worshipping the rising sun, an act of\r\nidolatry of which he could not be accused, since it was in the most\r\ngrudging manner that he allowed, that Mr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s sole anxiety seemed\r\nto be to continue all Sir Guy had undertaken; while Mrs. Ashford, on the\r\nother hand was much affected by the account her cousin James had been\r\ngiving her of the grief that he had suffered at Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s death, his\r\nlong illness, his loss of spirits, the reluctance he had shown to come\r\nhere at all, and his present unconquerable dread of going to the Park.\r\n\r\nHe was soon after in London, where, as far as could be judged in such\r\nearly days, he seemed likely to distinguish himself according to the\r\nfondest hopes that Margaret or Laura could ever have entertained. Laura\r\nwas only afraid he was overworking himself, especially as, having at\r\npresent little command of ready money, he lived in a small lodging, kept\r\nno horse, and did not enter into society; but she was reassured when\r\nhe came to Hollywell for a day or two at Whitsuntide, not having indeed\r\nregained flesh or colour, but appearing quite well, in better spirits,\r\nand very eager about political affairs.\r\n\r\nAll would have been right that summer, but that, as Philip observed, the\r\nfirst evening of his arrival, Amabel was not looking as well as she had\r\ndone at the time of the christening. She had, just after it, tried\r\nher strength and spirits too much, and had ever since been not exactly\r\nunwell, but sad and weary, more dejected than ever before, unable to\r\nbear the sight of flowers or the sound of music, and evidently suffering\r\nmuch under the recurrence of the season, which had been that of\r\nher great happiness--the summer sunshine, the long evenings, the\r\nnightingale\xe2\x80\x99s songs. She was fatigued by the most trifling exertion, and\r\nseemed able to take interest in nothing but her baby, and a young widow\r\nin the village, who was in a decline; and though she was willing to do\r\nall that was asked of her, it was in a weary, melancholy manner, as if\r\nshe had no peace but in being allowed to sit alone, drooping over her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nFrom society she especially shrunk, avoiding every chance of meeting\r\nvisitors, and distressed and harassed when her father brought home some\r\nof his casual dinner guests, and was vexed not to see her come into the\r\ndrawing-room in the evening. If she did make the effort of coming, to\r\nplease him, she was so sure to be the worse for it, that her mother\r\nwould keep her up-stairs the next time, and try to prevent her from\r\nknowing that her father was put out, and declared it was nonsense to\r\nexpect poor Amy to get up her spirits, while she never saw a living\r\nsoul, and only sat moping in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nA large dinner-party did not interfere with her, for even he could not\r\nexpect her to appear at it, and one of these he gave during Philip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvisit, for the pleasure of exhibiting such company as the M.P. for\r\nMoorworth. After dinner, Charlotte told Mary Ross to go and see Amy.\r\nNot finding her in the dressing-room, she knocked at her own door. \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nin,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the low soft voice; and in the window, overhung by the\r\nlong shoots of the roses, Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s close cap and small head were seen\r\nagainst the deep-blue evening sky, as she sat in the summer twilight,\r\nher little one asleep in her cot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for coming,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98I thought you would not mind sitting\r\nhere with baby and me. I have sent Anne out walking.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How pretty she looks!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, stooping over the infant. \xe2\x80\x98Sleep is\r\ngiving her quite a colour; and how fast she grows!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor little woman!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tired, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, sitting down, and taking up the little\r\nlambswool shoe, that Amy had been knitting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N--no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, with another sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid you are. You have been walking to Alice Lamsden\xe2\x80\x99s again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that tires me. Indeed, I believe the truth is,\xe2\x80\x99 and her\r\nvoice sounded especially sad in the subdued tone in which she spoke,\r\nthat she might not disturb the child, \xe2\x80\x98I am not so much tired with what\r\nI do, which is little enough, as of the long, long life that is before\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s heart was full, but she did not show her thought otherwise than\r\nby a look towards the babe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, poor little darling,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, \xe2\x80\x98I know there is double\r\nquantity to be done for her, but I am so sorry for her, when I think she\r\nmust grow up without knowing him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She has you, though,\xe2\x80\x99 Mary could not help saying, as she felt that\r\nAmabel was superior to all save her husband.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Amy did not hear; she went up to the cot, and went on:--\xe2\x80\x98If he\r\nhad but once seen her, if she had but had one kiss, one touch that I\r\ncould tell her of by and by, it would not seem as if she was so very\r\nfatherless. Oh no, baby, I must wait, that you may know something about,\r\nhim; for no one else can tell you so well what he was, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntell much!\xe2\x80\x99 She presently returned to her seat. \xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\r\nreally wish I was like poor Alice,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98I hope not; I am sure I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t for her sake. But, Mary, I never knew till I was well again how\r\nmuch I had reckoned on dying when she was born. I did not think I was\r\nwishing it, but it seemed likely, and I was obliged to arrange things\r\nin case of it. Then somehow, as he came back last spring, after that sad\r\nwinter, it seemed as if this spring, though he would not come back to\r\nme, I might be going to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But then she comforted you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that she did, my precious one; I was so glad of her, it was a sort\r\nof having him again, and so it is still sometimes, and will be more so,\r\nI dare say. I am very thankful for her, indeed I am; and I hope I am not\r\nrepining, for it does not signify after all, in the end, if I am weary\r\nand lonely sometimes. I wish I was sure it was not wrong. I know I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwish to alter things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I am sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, smiling, \xe2\x80\x98it is only the old, silly little Amy that\r\ndoes feel such a heart-aching and longing for one glance of his eye, or\r\ntouch of his hand, or sound of his foot in the passage. Oh, Mary, the\r\nworst of all is to wake up, after dreaming I have heard his voice. There\r\nis nothing for it but to take our baby and hold her very tight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dearest Amy! But you are not blaming yourself for these feelings. It\r\nmight be wrong to indulge them and foster them; but while you struggle\r\nwith them, they can\xe2\x80\x99t in themselves be wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel pausing to think. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have \xe2\x80\x9cthe joy\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nthe bottom still; I know it is all quite right, and it came straight\r\nfrom heaven, as he said. I can get happy very often when I am by myself,\r\nor at church, with him; it is only when I miss his bright outside\r\nand can\xe2\x80\x99t think myself into the inner part, that it is so forlorn and\r\ndreary. I can do pretty well alone. Only I wish I could help being so\r\ntroublesome and disagreeable to everybody\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, concluding in a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary, almost laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is so stupid of me to be always poorly, and making mamma anxious\r\nwhen there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the matter with me. And I know I am a check on\r\nthem down-stairs--papa, and Charlotte, and all--they are very kind,\r\nconsiderate, and yet\xe2\x80\x99--she paused--\xe2\x80\x98and it is a naughty feeling; but\r\nwhen I feel all those dear kind eyes watching me always, and wanting me\r\nto be happy, it is rather oppressive, especially when I can\xe2\x80\x99t; but if I\r\ntry not to disappoint them, I do make such a bad hand of it, and am sure\r\nto break down afterwards, and that grieves mamma all the more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will be better when this time of year is over,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps, yes. He always seemed to belong to summer days, and to come\r\nwith them. Well, I suppose trials always come in a different shape from\r\nwhat one expects; for I used to think I could bear all the doom with\r\nhim, but, I did not know it would be without him, and yet that is the\r\nbest. Oh, baby!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should not have come to disturb her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No--never mind; she never settles fairly to sleep till we are shut in\r\nby ourselves. Hush! hush, darling--No? Will nothing do but being taken\r\nup? Well, then, there! Come, and show your godmamma what a black fringe\r\nthose little wakeful eyes are getting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when Mary went down it was with the conviction that those black\r\neyelashes, too marked to be very pretty in so young a babe, were more of\r\na comfort to Amabel than anything she could say.\r\n\r\nThe evening wore on, and at length Laura came into her sister\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\nShe looked fagged and harassed, the old face she used to wear in the\r\ntime of disguise and secrecy, Amabel asked if it had been a tiresome\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes--no--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Just like others,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are tired, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98You took too long a ride\r\nwith Philip. I saw you come in very late.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not in the least tired, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then he is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98I hope he has not one of his headaches\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, still in a dissatisfied, uncomfortable tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No? Dear Laura, I am sure there is something wrong;\xe2\x80\x99 and with a little\r\nmore of her winning, pleading kindness, she drew from Laura that Philip\r\nhad told her she idolized him. He had told her so very gently and\r\nkindly, but he had said she idolized him in a manner that was neither\r\ngood for herself nor him; and he went on to blame himself for it, which\r\nwas what she could not bear. It had been rankling in her mind ever since\r\nthat he had found fault with her for loving him so well, and it had\r\nmade her very unhappy. She _could_ not love him less, and how should she\r\nplease him? She had much rather he had blamed her than himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I see what he means\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, thoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x98He has grown\r\nafraid of himself, and afraid of being admired now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But how am I to help that, Amy?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, with tears in her eyes:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98he cannot help being the first, the very first of all with me--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, quickly, \xe2\x80\x98not the very first, or what would you do\r\nif you were to be--like me? Don\xe2\x80\x99t turn away, dear Laura; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nI over could bear this at all, if dear Guy had not kept it always before\r\nmy eyes from the very first that we were to look to something else\r\nbesides each other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course I meant the first earthly thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura; but it was not\r\nheartfelt--she knew she ought, therefore she thought she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And so,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Amy, \xe2\x80\x98I think if that other is first, it would make\r\nyou have some other standard of right besides himself, then you would be\r\na stay and help to him. I think that is what he means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy! let me ask you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, a little entreatingly, yet as if she\r\nmust needs put the question--\xe2\x80\x98surely, you never thought Guy had faults?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHer colour deepened. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, firmly. \xe2\x80\x98I could not\r\nhave understood his repentance if I had not thought so. And, dear\r\nLaura, if you will forgive me for saying it, it would be much better for\r\nyourself and Philip if you would see the truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought you forgave him,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Laura! but does not that word \xe2\x80\x9cforgive\xe2\x80\x9d imply something? I could\r\nnot have done anything to comfort him that day, if I had not believed\r\nhe had something to be comforted for. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be pleasant to him to see\r\nyou think his repentance vain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is noble and great.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But if it was not real, it would be thrown away. Besides, dear Laura,\r\ndo let me say this for once. If you would but understand that you let\r\nhim lead you into what was not right, and be really sorry for that, and\r\nshow mamma that you are, I do think it would all begin much more happily\r\nwhen you are married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I could never have told, till I was obliged to betray myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura. \xe2\x80\x98You know, Amy, it was no engagement. We never wrote to each\r\nother, we had but one walk; it was no business of his to speak till he\r\ncould hope for papa\xe2\x80\x99s consent to our marriage. It would have been all\r\nconfusion if he had told, and that would have been only that we had\r\nalways loved each other with all our hearts, which every one knew\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yet, Laura, it was what preyed on him when he thought he was dying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Because it was the only thing like a fault he could think of,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nLaura, excited by this shade of blame to defend him vehemently--\xe2\x80\x98because\r\nhis scruples are high and noble and generous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe spoke so eagerly, that the baby\xe2\x80\x99s voice again broke on the\r\nconversation, and she was obliged to go away; but though her idolatry\r\nwas complete, it did not seem to give full satisfaction or repose. As to\r\nPhilip, though his love for her was unchanged, it now and then was\r\nfelt, though not owned by him, that she was not fully a helpmeet, only\r\na \xe2\x80\x98Self\xe2\x80\x99; not such a \xe2\x80\x98Self\xe2\x80\x99 as he had left at St. Mildred\xe2\x80\x99s, but still\r\nreflecting on him his former character, instead of aiding him to a new\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 43\r\n\r\n     But nature to its inmost part\r\n     Faith had refined; and to her heart\r\n       A peaceful cradle given,\r\n     Calm as the dew drops free to rest\r\n     Within a breeze-fanned rose\xe2\x80\x99s breast\r\n       Till it exhales to heaven.\r\n                             --WORDSWORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had long been a promise that Mr. Edmonstone should take Charlotte to\r\nvisit her grandmamma, in Ireland. They would have gone last autumn,\r\nbut for Guy\xe2\x80\x99s illness, and now Aunt Charlotte wrote to hasten the\r\nperformance of the project. Lady Mabel was very anxious to see them,\r\nshe said; and having grown much more infirm of late, seemed to think\r\nit would be the last meeting with her son. She talked so much of Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone and Laura, that it was plain that she wished extremely for a\r\nvisit from them, though she did not like to ask it, in the present state\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\nA special invitation was sent to Bustle; indeed, Charles said Charlotte\r\ncould not have gone without his permission, for he reigned like a tyrant\r\nover her, evidently believing her created for no purpose but to wait on\r\nhim, and take him to walk.\r\n\r\nLaura was a great favourite at the cottage of Kilcoran, and felt she\r\nought to offer to go. Philip fully agreed, and held out home hopes of\r\nfollowing as soon as the session, was over, and he had been to Redclyffe\r\nabout some business that had been deferred too long.\r\n\r\nAnd now it appeared that Mr. Edmonstone had a great desire to take\r\nhis wife, and she herself said, that under any other circumstances she\r\nshould have been very desirous of going. She had not been to Ireland\r\nfor fifteen years, and was sorry to have seen so little of her\r\nmother-in-law; and now that it had been proved that Charles could exist\r\nwithout her, she would not have hesitated to leave him, but for Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstate of health and spirits, which made going from home out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nCharles and Amabel did not think so. It was not to be endured, that when\r\ngrandmamma wished for her, she should stay at home for them without real\r\nnecessity; besides, the fatigue, anxiety, and sorrow she had undergone\r\nof late, had told on her, and had made her alter perceptibly, from being\r\nremarkably fresh and youthful, to be somewhat aged; and the change to a\r\nnew scene, where she could not be distressing herself at every failure\r\nin cheerfulness of poor Amy\xe2\x80\x99s, was just the thing to do her good.\r\n\r\nAmabel was not afraid of the sole charge of Charles or of the baby, for\r\nshe had been taught but too well to manage for herself, she understood\r\nCharles very well, and had too much quiet good sense to be fanciful\r\nabout her very healthy baby. Though she was inexperienced, with old\r\nnurse hard by, and Dr. Mayerne at Broadstone, there was no fear of\r\nher not having good counsel enough. She was glad to be of some use, by\r\nenabling her mother to leave Charles, and her only fear was of being\r\ndull company for him; but as he was so kind as to bear it, she would\r\ndo her best, and perhaps their neighbours would come and enliven him\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\nCharles threw his influence into the same scale. His affectionate\r\nobservation had shown him that it oppressed Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s spirits to be the\r\nobject of such constant solicitude, and he was convinced it would be\r\nbetter for her, both to have some necessary occupation and to be free\r\nfrom that perpetual mournful watching of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s that caused her\r\nto make the efforts to be cheerful which did her more harm than anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nTo let her alone to look and speak as she pleased without the fear of\r\npaining and disappointing those she loved, keep the house quiet, and\r\ngive her the employment of household cares and attending on himself,\r\nwas, he thought, the best thing for her; and he was full of eagerness\r\nand pleasure at the very notion of being of service to her, if only by\r\nbeing good for nothing but to be waited on. He thought privately that\r\nthe spring of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s mind had been so much injured by the grief\r\nshe had herself suffered for \xe2\x80\x98her son Guy,\xe2\x80\x99 her cruel disappointment in\r\nLaura, and the way in which she threw herself into all Amy\xe2\x80\x99s affliction,\r\nthat there was a general depression in her way of observing and\r\nattending Amy, which did further harm; and that to change the current of\r\nher thoughts, and bring her home refreshed and inspirited, would be the\r\nbeginning of improvement in all. Or, as he expressed it to Dr. Mayerne,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall set off on a new tack.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis counsel and Mr. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s wishes at length decided mamma, on\r\ncondition that Mary Ross and Dr. Mayerne would promise to write on\r\nalternate weeks a full report, moral and physical, as Charles called\r\nit. So in due time the goods were packed, Mrs. Edmonstone cried heartily\r\nover the baby, advised Amabel endlessly about her, and finally looked\r\nback through her tears, as she drove away, to see Charles nodding and\r\nwaving his hand at the bay-window, and Amabel standing with her parting\r\nsmile and good-bye on the steps.\r\n\r\nThe reports, moral and physical, proved that Charles had judged wisely.\r\nAmabel was less languid as she had more cause for exertion, and\r\nseemed relieved by the absence of noise and hurry, spending more time\r\ndown-stairs, and appearing less weary in the evening. She still avoided\r\nthe garden, but she began to like short drives with her brother in the\r\npony-carriage, when he drove on in silence, and let her lean back and\r\ngaze up into the sky, or into the far distance, undisturbed. Now\r\nand then he would be rejoiced by a bright, genuine smile, perfectly\r\nrefreshing, at some of the pretty ways of the babe, a small but plump\r\nand lively creature, beginning to grasp with her hands, laugh and gaze\r\nabout with eyes that gave promise of the peculiar colour and brilliancy\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s. Amabel was afraid she might be tempted into giving\r\nCharles too much of the little lady\xe2\x80\x99s society; but he was very fond of\r\nher, regarding her with an odd mixture of curiosity and amusement, much\r\nentertained with watching what he called her unaccountable manners,\r\nand greatly flattered when he could succeed in attracting her notice.\r\nIndeed, the first time she looked full at him with a smile on the verge\r\nof a laugh, it completely overcame him, by the indescribably forcible\r\nmanner in which it suddenly recalled the face which had always shone on\r\nhim like a sunbeam. Above all, it was worth anything to see the looks\r\nshe awoke in her mother, for which he must have loved her, even had she\r\nnot been Guy\xe2\x80\x99s child.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, especially on Sunday, Amabel would sometimes talk to him\r\nas she had never yet been able to do, about her last summer\xe2\x80\x99s journey,\r\nand her stay at Recoara, and his way of listening and answering had in\r\nit something that gave her great pleasure; while, on his side, he deemed\r\neach fresh word of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of treasure for which to be grateful\r\nto her. The brother and sister were a great help and happiness to each\r\nother; Amabel found herself restored to Charles, as Guy had liked to\r\nthink of her, and Charles felt as if the old childish fancies were\r\nfulfilled, in which he and Amy were always to keep house together. He\r\nwas not in the least dull; and though his good-natured visitors in the\r\nmorning were welcome, and received with plenty of his gay lively talk,\r\nhe did not by any means stand in need of the compassion they felt for\r\nhim, and could have done very well without them; while the evenings\r\nalone with Amy had in them something so pleasant that they were almost\r\nbetter than those when Mr. Ross and Mary came to tea. He wrote word to\r\nhis mother that she might be quite at ease about them, and he thought\r\nAmy would get through the anniversaries of September better while the\r\nhouse was quiet, so that she need not think of trying to hurry home.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to have done so, for the letters, which scarcely missed a\r\nday in being written by his mother and Charlotte, seemed to show that\r\ntheir stay was likely to be long. Lady Mabel was more broken than they\r\nhad expected, and claimed a long visit, as she was sure it would be\r\ntheir last, while the Kilcoran party had taken possession of Laura and\r\nCharlotte, as if they never meant to let them go. Charlotte wrote her\r\nbrother very full and very droll accounts of the Iricisms around her\r\nwhich she enjoyed thoroughly, and Charles, declaring he never expected\r\nto see little Charlotte come out in the character of the facetious\r\ncorrespondent, used to send Mary Ross into fits of laughing by what he\r\nread to her. Mr. Fielder, the tutor, wrote Charlotte, was very nearly\r\nequal to Eveleen\xe2\x80\x99s description of him, but very particularly agreeable,\r\nin fact, the only man who had any conversation, whom she had seen since\r\nshe had been at Kilcoran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Imagine,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98the impertinent little puss setting up for\r\nintellectual conversation, forsooth!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what comes of living with good company,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister used sometimes to drive to Broadstone to fetch\r\ntheir letters by the second post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte, of course,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, as he opened one. \xe2\x80\x98My Lady\r\nMorville, what\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only Mr. Markham,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, \xe2\x80\x98about the winding up of our business\r\ntogether, I suppose. What does Charlotte say?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte is in a fit of impudence, for which she deserves\r\nchastisement,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, unable to help laughing, as he read,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our last event was a call from the fidus Achates, who, it seems, can no\r\nlonger wander up and down the Mediterranean without his pius Aeneas,\r\nand so has left the army, and got a diplomatic appointment somewhere in\r\nGermany. Lord Kilcoran has asked him to come and stay here, and Mabel\r\nand I are quite sure he comes for a purpose. Of course he has chosen\r\nthis time, in order that he may be able to have his companion before his\r\neyes, as a model for courtship, and I wish I had you to help me look\r\non whenever Philip comes, as that laugh I must enjoy alone with Bustle.\r\nHowever, when Philip will come we cannot think, for we have heard\r\nnothing of him this age, not even Laura, and she is beginning to look\r\nvery anxious about him. Do tell us if you know anything about him.\r\nThe last letter was when parliament was prorogued, and he was going to\r\nRedclyffe, at least three weeks ago.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder if Mr. Markham mentions him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, hastily unfolding\r\nher letter, which was, as she expected, about the executors\xe2\x80\x99 business,\r\nbut glancing on to the end, she exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! here it is. Listen, Charlie. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Morville has been here for\r\nthe last few weeks, and is, I fear, very unwell. He has been entirely\r\nconfined to the house, almost ever since his arrival, by violent\r\nheadache, which has completely disabled him from attending to business;\r\nbut he will not call in any advice. I make a point of going to see him\r\nevery day, though I believe my presence is anything but acceptable, as\r\nin his present state of health and spirits, I cannot think it right that\r\nhe should be left to servants.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor fellow! Redclyffe has been too much\r\nfor him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Over-worked, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I thought he was coming it\r\npretty strong these last few weeks.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not even writing to Laura! How very bad he must be! I will write at\r\nonce to ask Mr. Markham for more particulars.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe did so, and on the third day they drove again to fetch the answer.\r\nIt was a much worse account. Mr. Morville was, said Markham, suffering\r\ndreadfully from headache, and lay on the sofa all day, almost unable to\r\nspeak or move, but resolved against having medical advice, though his\r\nown treatment of himself did not at all succeed in relieving him. There\r\nwas extreme depression of spirits, and an unwillingness to see any one.\r\nHe had positively refused to admit either Lord Thorndale or Mr. Ashford,\r\nand would hardly bear to see Markham himself, who, indeed, only forced\r\nhis presence on him from thinking it unfit to leave him entirely to the\r\nservants, and would be much relieved if some of Mr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s friends\r\nwere present to free him from the responsibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it sounds comfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is just as I feared!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98Great excitability of brain and\r\nnerve, Dr. Mayerne said. All the danger of a brain fever again! Poor\r\nLaura! What is to be done?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is for want of some one to talk to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98I know how\r\nhe broods over his sad recollections, and Redclyffe must make it so much\r\nworse. If mamma and Laura were but at home to go to him, it might save\r\nhim, and it would be fearful for him to have another illness, reduced as\r\nhe is. How I wish he was here!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He cannot come, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98or he would be in Ireland.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. How well Guy knew when he said it would be worse for him than for\r\nme! How I wish I could do something now to make up for running away from\r\nhim in Italy. If I was but at Redclyffe!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you really wish it?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, if I could do him any good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would you go there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I had but papa or mamma to go with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think I should do as well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlie!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you think there would be any use in it, and choose to take the\r\ntrouble of lugging me about the country, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! Charlie, how very, kind! How thankful poor Laura will be to you! I\r\ndo believe it will save him!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Amabel, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99--he paused--\xe2\x80\x98shall you like to see Redclyffe?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! that is no matter,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, quickly. \xe2\x80\x98I had rather see after\r\nPhilip than anything. I told you how he was made my charge, you know.\r\nAnd Laura! Only will it not be too tiring for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how it should hurt me. But I forget, what is to be done\r\nabout your daughter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what harm it could do her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, considering. \xe2\x80\x98Mrs.\r\nGresham brought a baby of only three months old from Scotland the other\r\nday, and she is six. It surely cannot hurt her, but we will ask Dr.\r\nMayerne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma will never forgive us if we don\xe2\x80\x99t take the doctor into our\r\ncouncils.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arnaud can manage for us. We would sleep in London, and go on by an\r\nearly train, and we can take our--I mean my--carriage, for the journey\r\nafter the railroad. It would not be too much for you. How soon could we\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sooner the better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98If we are to do him any good, it\r\nmust be speedily, or it will be a case of shutting the stable-door. Why\r\nnot to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe project was thoroughly discussed that evening, but still with the\r\nfeeling as if it could not be real, and when they parted at night they\r\nsaid,--\xe2\x80\x98We will see how the scheme looks in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCharles was still wondering whether it was a dream, when the first thing\r\nhe heard in the court below his window was--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here, William, here\xe2\x80\x99s a note from my lady for you to take to Dr.\r\nMayerne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They be none of them ill?\xe2\x80\x99 answered William\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O no; my lady has been up this hour, and Mr. Charles has rung his bell.\r\nStop, William, my lady said you were to call at Harris\xe2\x80\x99s and bring home\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cBradshaw\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReality, indeed, thought Charles, marvelling at his sister, and his\r\nelastic spirits throwing him into the project with a sort of enjoyment,\r\npartaking of the pleasure of being of use, the spirit of enterprise, and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98fun\xe2\x80\x99 of starting independently on an expedition unknown to all the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHe met Amabel with a smile that showed both were determined. He\r\nundertook to announce the plan to his mother, and she said she would\r\nwrite to tell Mr. Markham that as far as could be reckoned on two such\r\nfrail people, they would be at Redclyffe the next evening, and he must\r\nuse his own discretion about giving Mr. Morville the note which she\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nDr. Mayerne came in time for breakfast, and the letter from Markham was\r\nat once given to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A baddish state of things, eh, doctor!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Well, what do\r\nyou think this lady proposes? To set off forthwith, both of us, to take\r\ncharge of him. What do you think of that, Dr. Mayerne?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I should say it was the only chance for him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, looking\r\nonly at the latter. \xe2\x80\x98Spirits and health reacting on each other, I see\r\nit plain enough. Over-worked in parliament, doing nothing in moderation,\r\ngoing down to that gloomy old place, dreaming away by himself, going\r\njust the right way to work himself into another attack on the brain, and\r\nthen he is done for. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that you could do a wiser thing than\r\ngo to him, for he is no more fit to tell what is good for him than a\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x99 So spoke the doctor, thinking only of the patient till looking\r\nup at the pair he was dismissing to such a charge, the helpless,\r\ncrippled Charles, unable to cross the room without crutches, and Amabel,\r\nher delicate face and fragile figure in her widow\xe2\x80\x99s mourning, looking\r\nlike a thing to be pitied and nursed with the tenderest care, with that\r\nyoung child, too, he broke off and said--\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean you are in\r\nearnest?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Never more so in our lives,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; on which Dr. Mayerne looked\r\nso wonderingly and inquiringly at Amabel, that she answered,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes that we are, if you think it safe for Charles and baby.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is there no one else to go? What\xe2\x80\x99s become of his sister?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would never do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that is not the question;\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\ndetailed their plan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why it should not succeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor, \xe2\x80\x98or how\r\nyou can any of you damage yourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And baby?\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What should happen to her, do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor with\r\nhis kind, reassuring roughness. \xe2\x80\x98Unless you leave her behind in the\r\ncarriage, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what harm she could come to, and even then, if\r\nyou direct her properly, she will come safe to hand.\xe2\x80\x99 Amabel smiled, and\r\nsaying she would fetch her to be inspected, ran up-stairs with the light\r\nnimble step of former days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There goes one of the smallest editions of the wonders of the world!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles, covering a sigh with a smile. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will do\r\nher any harm?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not if she wishes it. I have long thought a change, a break, would\r\nbe the best thing for her--poor child!--I should have sent her to the\r\nsea-side if you had been more movable, and if I had not seen every fuss\r\nabout her made it worse.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what I call being a reasonable and valuable doctor,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nCharles. \xe2\x80\x98If you had routed the poor little thing out to the sea, she\r\nwould have only pined the more. But suppose the captain turns out too\r\nbad for her management, for old Markham seems in a proper taking?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hem! No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it is come to that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Be that as it may, I have a head, if nothing else, and some one is\r\nwanted. I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to you according as we find Philip.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe doctor was wanted for another private interview, in which to assure\r\nAmabel that there was no danger for Charles, and then, after promising\r\nto come to Redclyffe if there was occasion, and engaging to write and\r\ntell Mrs. Edmonstone they had his consent, he departed to meet them by\r\nand by at the station, and put Charles into the carriage.\r\n\r\nA very busy morning followed; Amabel arranged household affairs as\r\nbefitted the vice-queen; took care that Charles\xe2\x80\x99s comforts were provided\r\nfor; wrote many a note; herself took down Guy\xe2\x80\x99s picture, and laid it in\r\nher box, before Anne commenced her packing; and lastly, walked down to\r\nthe village to take leave of Alice Lamsden.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as the last hues of sunset were fading, on the following evening,\r\nLady Morville and Charles Edmonstone were passing from the moor into\r\nthe wooded valley of Redclyffe. Since leaving Moorworth not a word had\r\npassed. Charles sat earnestly watching his sister; though there was too\r\nmuch crape in the way for him to see her face, and she was perfectly\r\nstill, so that all he could judge by was the close, rigid clasping\r\ntogether of the hands, resting on the sleeping infant\xe2\x80\x99s white mantle.\r\nEach spot recalled to him some description of Guy\xe2\x80\x99s, the church-tower,\r\nthe school with the two large new windows, the park wall, the rising\r\nground within. What was she feeling? He did not dare to address her,\r\ntill, at the lodge-gate, he exclaimed--\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s Markham;\xe2\x80\x99 and, at the\r\nsame time, was conscious of a feeling between hope and fear, that this\r\nmight after all be a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand, and a wonder how they and the master\r\nof the house would meet if it turned out that they had taken fright\r\nwithout cause.\r\n\r\nAt his exclamation, Amy leant forward, and beckoned. Markham came up to\r\nthe window, and after the greeting on each side, walked along with\r\nhis hand on the door, as the carriage slowly mounted the steep hill,\r\nanswering her questions: \xe2\x80\x98How is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No better. He has been putting on leeches, and made himself so giddy,\r\nthat yesterday he could hardly stand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And they have not relieved him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in the least. I am glad you are come, for it has been an absurd way\r\nof going on.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; on the sofa in the library.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you give him my note? Does he expect us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I went to see about telling him this morning, but found him so low\r\nand silent, I thought it was better not. He has not opened a letter this\r\nweek, and he might have refused to see you, as he did Lord Thorndale.\r\nBesides, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how he would take my writing about him, though\r\nif you had not written, I believe I should have let Mrs. Henley know by\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is an escape for him,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured Charles to his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have done the best in our power to receive you\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Markham;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope you will find it comfortable, Lady Morville, but--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, I am not afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, smiling a little. Markham\xe2\x80\x99s eye\r\nwas on the little white bundle in her lap, but he did not speak of\r\nit, and went on with explanations about Mrs. Drew and Bolton and the\r\nsitting-room, and tea being ready.\r\n\r\nCharles saw the great red pile of building rise dark, gloomy, and\r\nhaunted-looking before them. The house that should have been Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s own beloved home! How could she bear it? But she was eagerly\r\nasking Markham how Philip should be informed of their arrival, and\r\nMarkham was looking perplexed, and saying, that to drive under the\r\ngateway, into the paved court, would make a thundering sound, that he\r\ndreaded for Mr. Morville. Could Mr. Charles Edmonstone cross the court\r\non foot? Charles was ready to do so; the carriage stopped, Amabel gave\r\nthe baby to Anne, saw Arnaud help Charles out; and turning to Markham,\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I had better go to him at once. Arnaud will show my brother the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The sitting-room, Arnaud\xe2\x80\x99 said Markham, and walked on fast with her,\r\nwhile Charles thought how strange to see her thus pass the threshold of\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s house, come thither to relieve and comfort his enemy.\r\n\r\nShe entered the dark-oak hall. On one side the light shone cheerfully\r\nfrom the sitting-room, the other doors were all shut. Markham hesitated,\r\nand stood reluctant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, you had better tell him I am here,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, in the voice, so\r\ngentle, that no one perceived its resolution.\r\n\r\nMarkham knocked at one of the high heavy doors, and softly opened it.\r\nAmabel stood behind it, and looked into the room, more than half dark,\r\nwithout a fire, and very large, gloomy, and cheerless, in the gray\r\nautumn twilight, that just enabled her to see the white pillows on the\r\nsofa, and Philip\xe2\x80\x99s figure stretched out on it. Markham advanced and\r\nstood doubtful for an instant, then in extremity, began--\xe2\x80\x98Hem! Lady\r\nMorville is come, and--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWithout further delay she came forward, saying--\xe2\x80\x98How are you, Philip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe neither moved nor seemed surprised, he only said, \xe2\x80\x98So you are come to\r\nheap more coals on my head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA thrill of terror came over her, but she did not show it, as she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sorry to find you so poorly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if before he had taken her presence for a dream; for,\r\nentirely roused, he exclaimed, in a tone of great surprise, \xe2\x80\x98Is it you,\r\nAmy?\xe2\x80\x99 Then sitting up, \xe2\x80\x98Why? When did you come here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just now. We were afraid you were ill, we heard a bad account of you,\r\nso we have taken you by storm: Charles, your goddaughter, and I, are\r\ncome to pay you a visit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles! Charles here?\xe2\x80\x99 cried Philip, starting up. \xe2\x80\x98Where is he?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Coming in,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy; and Philip, intent only on hospitality, hastened\r\ninto the hall, and met him at the door, gave him his arm and conducted\r\nhim where the inviting light guided them to the sitting-room. The full\r\nbrightness of lamp and fire showed the ashy paleness of his face; his\r\nhair, rumpled with lying on the sofa, had, on the temples, acquired a\r\nnoticeable tint of gray, his whole countenance bore traces of terrible\r\nsuffering; and Amabel thought that even at Recoara she had never seen\r\nhim look more wretchedly ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you come?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. \xe2\x80\x98It was very kind. I hope you will be\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We have taken good care of ourselves,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I wrote to Mr.\r\nMarkham, for I thought you were not well enough to be worried with\r\npreparations. We ought to beg your pardon for breaking on you so\r\nunceremoniously.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If any one should be at home here--\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, earnestly;--then\r\ninterrupting himself, he shaded his eyes from the light, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow to make you welcome enough. When did you set off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yesterday afternoon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98we slept in London, and came on\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you dined?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, looking perplexed to know where the\r\ndinner could come from.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; at K----, thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will you have? I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for Mrs. Drew.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you; don\xe2\x80\x99t tease yourself. Mrs. Drew will take care of us.\r\nNever mind; but how bad your head is!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, as he sat down on\r\nthe sofa, leaning his elbow on his knee, and pressing his hand very hard\r\non his forehead. \xe2\x80\x98You must lie down and keep quiet, and never mind us.\r\nWe only want a little tea. I am just going to take off my bonnet, and\r\nsee what they have done with baby, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come down. Pray lie\r\nstill till then. Mind he does, Charlie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey thought she was gone; but the next moment there she was with the\r\ntwo pillows from the library sofa, putting them under Philip\xe2\x80\x99s head,\r\nand making him comfortable; while he, overpowered by a fresh access of\r\nheadache, had neither will nor power to object. She rang, asked for Mrs.\r\nDrew, and went.\r\n\r\nPhilip lay, with closed eyes, as if in severe pain: and Charles, afraid\r\nto disturb him, sat feeling as if it was a dream. That he, with Amy and\r\nher child, should be in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s home, so differently from their old plans,\r\nso very differently from the way she should have arrived. He looked\r\nround the room, and everywhere knew what Guy\xe2\x80\x99s taste had prepared for\r\nhis bride--piano, books, prints, similarities to Hollywell, all with\r\na fresh new bridal effect, inexpressibly melancholy. They brought a\r\nthought of the bright eye, sweet voice, light step, and merry whistle;\r\nand as he said to himself \xe2\x80\x98gone for ever,\xe2\x80\x99 he could have hated Philip,\r\nbut for the sight of his haggard features, gray hairs, and the deep\r\nlines which, at seven-and-twenty, sorrow had traced on his brow. At\r\nlength Philip turned and looked up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charles,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I trust you have not let her run any risk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: we got Dr. Mayerne\xe2\x80\x99s permission.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is like all the rest,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, closing his eyes again.\r\nPresently he asked: \xe2\x80\x98How did you know I was not well?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Markham said something in a business letter that alarmed Amy. She wrote\r\nto inquire, and on his second letter we thought we had better come and\r\nsee after you ourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo more was said till Amabel returned. She had made some stay up-stairs,\r\ntalking to Mrs. Drew, who was bewildered between surprise, joy, and\r\ngrief; looking to see that all was comfortable in Charles\xe2\x80\x99s room, making\r\narrangements for the child, and at last relieving herself by a short\r\nspace of calm, to feel where she was, realize that this was Redclyffe,\r\nand whisper to her little girl that it was her father\xe2\x80\x99s own home. She\r\nknew it was the room he had destined for her; she tried, dark as it\r\nwas, to see the view of which he had told her, and looked up, over the\r\nmantel-piece, at Muller\xe2\x80\x99s engraving of St. John. Perhaps that was the\r\nhardest time of all her trial, and she felt as if, without his child\r\nin her arms, she could never have held up under the sense of desolation\r\nthat came over her, left behind, while he was in his true home. Left,\r\nshe told herself, to finish the task he had begun, and to become fit to\r\nfollow him. Was she not in the midst of fulfilling his last charge, that\r\nPhilip should be taken, care of? It was no time for giving way, and here\r\nwas his own little messenger of comfort looking up with her sleepy eyes\r\nto tell her so. Down she must go, and put off \xe2\x80\x98thinking herself into\r\nhappiness\xe2\x80\x99 till the peaceful time of rest; and presently she softly\r\nre-entered the sitting-room, bringing to both its inmates in her very\r\npresence such solace as she little guessed, in her straightforward\r\ndesire to nurse Philip, and take care Charles was not made\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThat stately house had probably never, since its foundation, seen\r\nanything so home-like as Amabel making tea and waiting on her two\r\ncompanions; both she and Charles pleasing each other by enjoying the\r\nmeal, and Philip giving his cup to be filled again and again, and\r\nwondering why one person\xe2\x80\x99s tea should taste so unlike another\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe was not equal to conversation, and Charles and Amabel were both\r\ntired, so that tea was scarcely over before they parted for the night;\r\nand Amy, frightened at the bright and slipperiness of the dark-oak\r\nstairs, could not be at peace till she had seen Arnaud help Charles\r\nsafely up them, and made him promise not to come down without assistance\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nShe was in the sitting-room soon after nine next morning, and found\r\nbreakfast on one table, and Charles writing a letter on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, as she kissed him, \xe2\x80\x98all right with you and little\r\nmiss?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quite, thank you. And are you rested?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slept like a top; and what did you do? Did you sleep like a sensible\r\nwoman?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Pretty well, and baby was very good. Have you heard anything of\r\nPhilip?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bolton thinks him rather better, and says he is getting up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How long have you been up?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A long time. I told Arnaud to catch Markham when he came up, as\r\nhe always does in a morning to see after Philip, and I have had a\r\nconference with him and Bolton, so that I can lay the case before Dr.\r\nMayerne scientifically.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you think of it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think we came at the right time. He has been getting more and more\r\ninto work in London, taking no exercise, and so was pretty well knocked\r\nup when he came here; and this place finished it. He tried to attend to\r\nbusiness about the property, but it always ended in his head growing\r\nso bad, he had to leave all to Markham, who, by the way, has been\r\nthoroughly propitiated by his anxiety for him. Then he gave up entirely;\r\nhas not been out of doors, written a note, nor seen a creature the last\r\nfortnight, but there he has lain by himself in the library, given up to\r\nall manner of dismal thoughts without a break.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How dreadful!\xe2\x80\x99 said Annabel, with tears in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Then he would not\r\nsee Mr. Ashford? Surely, he could have done something for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, lowering his voice,\xe2\x80\x99 from what\r\nBolton says, I think he had a dread of worse than brain fever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and was paler, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I believe,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Charles, \xe2\x80\x98that it is one half nervous and the\r\noppression of this place, and the other half, the over-straining of a\r\nhead that was already in a ticklish condition. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was\r\nany real danger of more than such a fever as he had at Corfu, which\r\nwould probably have been the death of him; but I think he dreaded still\r\nworse, and that his horror of seeing any one, or writing to Laura, arose\r\nfrom not knowing how far he could control his words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O! I am glad we came,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Amabel, pressing her hands together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has been doctoring himself,\xe2\x80\x99 proceeded Charles; \xe2\x80\x98and probably has\r\nkept off the fever by strong measures, but, of course, the more he\r\nreduced his strength, the greater advantage he gave to what was simply\r\nlow spirits. He must have had a terrible time of it, and where it would\r\nhave ended I cannot guess, but it seems to me that most likely, now that\r\nhe is once roused, he will come right again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust as Charles had finished speaking, he came down, looking extremely\r\nill, weak, and suffering; but calmed, and resting on that entire\r\ndependence on Amabel which had sprung up at Recoara.\r\n\r\nShe would not let him go back to his gloomy library, but made him lie\r\non the sofa in the sitting-room, and sat there herself, as she thought\r\na little quiet conversation between her and Charles would be the best\r\nthing for him. She wrote to Laura, and he sent a message, for he could\r\nnot yet attempt to write; and Charles wrote reports to his mother and\r\nDr. Mayerne; a little talk now and then going on about family matters.\r\n\r\nAmabel asked Philip if he knew that Mr. Thorndale was at Kilcoran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98he believed there was a letter from him, but his eyes\r\nhad ached too much of late to read.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Ashford sent in to ask whether Lady Morville would like to see her.\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed, and she proposed going to her in the library; but\r\nPhilip, disliking Amy\xe2\x80\x99s absence more than the sight of a visitor, begged\r\nshe might come to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\nThe Ashfords had been surprised beyond measure at the tidings that\r\nLady Morville had actually come to Redclyffe, and had been very slow\r\nto believe it; but when convinced by Markham\xe2\x80\x99s own testimony, Mrs.\r\nAshford\xe2\x80\x99s first idea had been to go and see if she could be any help to\r\nthe poor young thing in that great desolate house, whither Mrs. Ashford\r\nhad not been since, just a year ago, Markham had conducted her to admire\r\nhis preparations. There was much anxiety, too, about Mr. Morville, of\r\nwhose condition, Markham had been making a great mystery, and on her\r\nreturn, Mr. Ashford was very eager for her report.\r\n\r\nMr. Morville, she said, did look and seem very far from well, but Lady\r\nMorville had told her they hoped it was chiefly from over fatigue, and\r\nthat rest would soon restore him. Lady Morville herself was a fragile\r\ndelicate creature, very sweet looking, but so gentle and shrinking,\r\napparently, that it gave the impression of her having no character at\r\nall, not what Mrs. Ashford would have expected Sir Guy to choose. She\r\nhad spoken very little, and the chief of the conversation had been\r\nsustained by her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was very much taken with that young Mr. Edmonstone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs.\r\nAshford; \xe2\x80\x98he is about three-and-twenty, sadly crippled, but with such a\r\npleasing, animated face, and so extremely agreeable and sensible, I\r\ndo not wonder at Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s enthusiastic way of talking of him. I\r\ncould almost fancy it was admiration of the brother transferred to the\r\nsister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then after all you are disappointed in her, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lament, like\r\nMarkham, that she is not mistress here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: I won\xe2\x80\x99t say I am disappointed; she is a very sweet creature. O yes,\r\nvery! but far too soft and helpless for such a charge as this property,\r\nunless she had her father or brother to help her. But I must tell you\r\nthat she took me to see her baby, a nice little lively thing, poor\r\nlittle dear! and when we were alone, she spoke rather more, begged me\r\nto send her godson to see her, thanked me for coming, but crying stopped\r\nher from saying more. I could grow very fond of her. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder\r\nat him, for there is a great charm in anything so soft and dependent.\r\n\r\nDecidedly, Mary Ross had been right when she said, that except Sir Guy,\r\nthere was no one so difficult to know as Amy.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Charles insisted on Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s going out for fresh\r\nair and exercise, and she liked the idea of a solitary wandering; but\r\nPhilip, to her surprise, offered to come with her, and she was too glad\r\nto see him exert himself, to regret the musings she had hoped for; so\r\nout they went, after opening the window to give Charles what he called\r\nan airing, and he said, that in addition he should \xe2\x80\x98hirple about a\r\nlittle to explore the ground-floor of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must contrive some way for him to drive out,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, as he\r\ncrossed the court with Amabel; \xe2\x80\x98and you too. There is no walk here, but\r\nup hill or down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nUp-hill they went, along the path leading up the green slope, from which\r\nthe salt wind blew refreshingly. In a few minutes, Amabel found herself\r\non a spot which thrilled her all over.\r\n\r\nThere lay before her Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own Redclyffe bay; the waves lifting their\r\ncrests and breaking, the surge resounding, the sea-birds skimming round,\r\nthe Shag Rock dark and rugged, the scene which seemed above all the\r\ncentre of his home affections, which he had so longed to show her,\r\nthat it had cost him an effort on his death-bed to resign the hope;\r\nthe leaping waves that he said he would not change for the white-headed\r\nmountains. And now he was lying among those southern mountains, and she\r\nstood in the spot where he had loved to think of seeing her; and with\r\nPhilip by her side. His sea, his own dear sea, the vision of which had\r\ncheered, his last day, like the face of a dear old friend; his sea,\r\nrippling and glancing on, unknowing that the eyes that had loved it so\r\nwell would gaze on it no more; the wind that he had longed for to\r\ncool his fevered brow, the rock which had been like a playmate in his\r\nboyhood, and where he had perilled his life, and rescued so many. It\r\nwas one of the seasons when a whole gush of fresh perceptions of his\r\nfeelings, like a new meeting with himself, would come on her, her best\r\nof joys; and there she stood, gazing fixedly, her black veil fluttering\r\nin the wind, and her hands pressed close together, till Philip, little\r\nknowing what the sight was to her, shivered, saying it was very cold\r\nand windy, and without hesitation she turned away, feeling that now\r\nRedclyffe was precious indeed.\r\n\r\nShe brought her mind back to listen, while Philip was considering of\r\nmeans of taking Charles out of doors; he supposed there might be some\r\nvehicle about the place; but he thought there was no horse. Very unlike\r\nwas this to the exact Philip. The great range of stables was before\r\nthem, where the Morvilles had been wont to lodge their horses as\r\nsumptuously as themselves, and Amabel proposed to go and see what they\r\ncould find; but nothing was there but emptiness, till they came to\r\na pony in one stall, a goat in another, and one wheelbarrow in the\r\ncoach-house.\r\n\r\nOn leaving it, under the long-sheltered sunny wall, they came in\r\nsight of a meeting between the baby taking the air in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s arms,\r\nand Markham, who had been hovering about all day, anxious to know\r\nhow matters were going on. His back was towards them, so that he was\r\nunconscious of their approach, and they saw how he spoke to Anne, looked\r\nfixedly at the child, made her laugh, and finally took her in his arms,\r\nas he had so often carried her father, studying earnestly her little\r\nface. As soon as he saw them coming, he hastily gave her back to Anne,\r\nas if ashamed to be thus caught, but he was obliged to grunt and put\r\nhis hand up to his shaggy eyelashes, before he could answer Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\nHe could hardly believe his eyes, that here was Mr. Morville, who\r\nyesterday was scarcely able to raise his head from the pillow, and could\r\nattend to nothing. He could not think what Lady Morville had done to\r\nhim, when he heard him inquiring and making arrangements about sending\r\nfor a pony carriage, appearing thoroughly roused, and the dread of being\r\nseen or spoken to entirely passed away, Markham was greatly rejoiced,\r\nfor Mr. Morville\xe2\x80\x99s illness, helplessness, and dependence upon himself,\r\nhad softened and won him to regard him kindly as nothing else would have\r\ndone; and his heart was entirely gained when, after they had wished him\r\ngood-bye, he saw Philip and Amabel walk on, overtake Anne, Amy take the\r\nbaby and hold her up to Philip, who looked at her with the same earnest\r\ninterest. From thenceforward Markham knew that Redclyffe was nothing but\r\na burden to Mr. Morville, and he could bear to see it in his possession\r\nsince like himself, he seemed to regard Sir Guy\xe2\x80\x99s daughter like a\r\ndisinherited princess.\r\n\r\nThis short walk fatigued Philip thoroughly. He slept till dinner-time,\r\nand when he awoke said it was the first refreshing dreamless sleep\r\nhe had had for weeks. His head was much better, and at dinner he had\r\nsomething like an appetite.\r\n\r\nIt was altogether a day of refreshment, and so were the ensuing ones.\r\nEach day Philip became stronger, and resumed more of his usual habits.\r\nFrom writing a few lines in Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s daily letter to Laura, he proceeded\r\nto filling the envelope, and from being put to sleep by Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreading, to reading aloud the whole evening himself. The pony carriage\r\nwas set up, and he drove Charles out every day, Amabel being then\r\nreleased from attending him, and free to enjoy herself in her own way in\r\nrambles about the house and park, and discoveries of the old haunts she\r\nknew so well by description.\r\n\r\nShe early found her way to Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own room, where she would walk up and\r\ndown with her child in her arms, talking to her, and holding up to her,\r\nto be admired, the treasures of his boyhood, that Mrs. Drew delighted to\r\nkeep in order. One day, when alone in the sitting-room, she thought of\r\ntrying the piano he had chosen for her. It was locked, but the key was\r\non her own split-ring, where he had put it for her the day he returned\r\nfrom London. She opened it, and it so happened, that the first note she\r\nstruck reminded her of one of the peculiarly sweet and deep tones of\r\nGuy\xe2\x80\x99s voice. It was like awaking its echo again, and as it died away,\r\nshe hid her face and wept. But from that time the first thing she did\r\nwhen her brother and cousin were out, was always to bring down her\r\nlittle girl, and play to her, watching how she enjoyed the music.\r\n\r\nLittle Mary prospered in the sea air, gained colour, took to springing\r\nand laughing; and her intelligent lively way of looking about brought\r\nout continually more likeness to her father. Amabel herself was no\r\nlonger drooping and pining, her step grew light and elastic, a shade of\r\npink returned to her cheek, and the length of walk she could take was\r\nwonderful, considering her weakness in the summer. Every day she stood\r\non the cliff and looked at \xe2\x80\x98Guy\xe2\x80\x99s sea,\xe2\x80\x99 before setting out to visit the\r\ncottages, and hear the fond rough recollections of Sir Guy, or to wander\r\nfar away into the woods or on the moor, and find the way to the places\r\nhe had loved. One day, when Philip and Charles came in from a drive,\r\nthey overtook her in the court, her cloak over her arm, her crape limp\r\nwith spray, her cheeks brightened to a rosy glow by the wind, and a\r\nreal smile as she looked up to them. When Charles was on his sofa, she\r\nstooped over him and whispered, \xe2\x80\x98James and Ben Robinson have taken me\r\nout to the Shag!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe saw Mr. Wellwood, and heard a good account of Coombe Prior. She made\r\ngreat friends with the Ashfords, especially little Lucy and the baby.\r\nShe delighted in visits to the cottages, and Charles every day wondered\r\nwhere was the drooping dejection that she could not shake off at home.\r\nShe would have said that in Guy\xe2\x80\x99s own home, \xe2\x80\x98the joy\xe2\x80\x99 had come to her,\r\nno longer in fitful gleams and held by an effort for a moment, but\r\nsteadily brightening. She missed him indeed, but the power of finding\r\nrest in looking forward to meeting him, the pleasure of dwelling on the\r\ndays he had been with her, and the satisfaction of doing his work for\r\nthe present, had made a happiness for her, and still in him, quiet,\r\ngrave, and subdued, but happiness likely to bloom more and more brightly\r\nthroughout her life. The anniversary of his death was indeed a day of\r\ntears, but the tears were blessed ones, and she was more full of the\r\nfeeling that had sustained her on that morning, than she had been\r\nthrough all the year before.\r\n\r\nCharles and Philip, meanwhile, proceeded excellently together, each very\r\nanxious for the comfort of the other. Philip was a good deal overwhelmed\r\nat first by the quantity of business on his hands, and setting about it\r\nwhile his head was still weak, would have seriously hurt himself again,\r\nif Charles had not come to his help, worked with a thorough good will,\r\ngreat clearness and acuteness, and surprised Philip by his cleverness\r\nand perseverance. He was elated at being of so much use; and begged to\r\nbe considered for the future as Philip\xe2\x80\x99s private secretary, to which\r\nthe only objection was, that his handwriting was as bad as Philip\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\ngood; but it was an arrangement so much to the benefit of both parties,\r\nthat it was gladly made. Philip was very grateful for such valuable\r\nassistance; and Charles amused himself with triumphing in his\r\nimportance, when he should sit in state on his sofa at Hollywell,\r\nsurrounded with blue-books, getting up the statistics for some\r\nmagnificent speech of the honourable member for Moorworth.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Charles and Amabel saw no immediate prospect of\r\ntheir party returning from Ireland, and thought it best to remain at\r\nRedclyffe, since Philip had so much to do there; and besides, events\r\nwere occurring at Kilcoran which would have prevented his visit, even\r\nwithout his illness.\r\n\r\nOne of the first drives that Charles and Philip took, after the latter\r\nwas equal to any exertion, was to Thorndale. There Charles was much\r\namused by the manner in which Philip was received, and he himself, for\r\nhis sake; and as he said to Amabel on his return, there was no question\r\nnow, that the blame of spoiling Philip did not solely rest at Hollywell.\r\n\r\nFinding only Lady Thorndale at home, and hearing that Lord Thorndale was\r\nin the grounds, Philip went out to look for him, leaving Charles on the\r\nsofa, under her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s care. Charles, with a little exaggeration,\r\nprofessed that he had never been so flattered in his whole life, as\r\nhe was by the compliments that reflected on him as the future\r\nbrother-in-law of Philip; and that he had really begun to think even\r\nLaura not half sensible enough of her own happiness. Lady Thorndale\r\nafterwards proceeded to inquiries about the De Courcy family, especially\r\nLady Eveleen; and Charles, enlightened by Charlotte, took delight in\r\ngiving a brilliant description of his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s charms, for which he\r\nwas rewarded by very plain intimations of the purpose for which her son\r\nJames was gone to Kilcoran.\r\n\r\nOn talking the visit over, as they drove home, Charles asked Philip if\r\nhe had guessed at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s intentions. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you never took the credit of it. Why did you not tell us?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I knew it from himself, in confidence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, amusing himself with the notion of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndutifully asking the permission of his companion, unshaken in allegiance\r\nthough the staff might be broken, and the book drowned deeper than did\r\never plummet sound. Philip spoke no more, and Charles would ask no\r\nmore, for Philip\xe2\x80\x99s own affairs of the kind were not such as to encourage\r\ntalking of other people\xe2\x80\x99s. No explanation was needed why he should now\r\npromote an attachment which he had strongly disapproved while James\r\nThorndale was still in the army.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, however, came a letter from Charlotte, bringing\r\nfurther news, at which Charles was so amazed, that he could not help\r\ncommunicating it at once to his companions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So! Eveleen won\xe2\x80\x99t have him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that she has refused Thorndale?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Even so!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Charlotte says he is gone. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Mr. Thorndale\r\nleft us this morning, after a day of private conferences, in which\r\nhe seems to have had no satisfaction, for his resolute dignity and\r\ndetermination to be agreeable all the evening were\xe2\x80\x9d--ahem--\xe2\x80\x9cwere great.\r\nMabel cannot get at any of the real reasons from Eveleen, though I think\r\nI could help her, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Charlotte means mischief.\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, as he concluded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip. \xe2\x80\x98I did think Lady Eveleen would have\r\nbeen able to estimate Thorndale. It will be a great disappointment--the\r\ninclination has been of long standing. Poor Thorndale!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would have been a very good thing for Eva,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nThorndale is such a sensible man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I thought his steady sense just what was wanting to bring out all\r\nher good qualities that are running to waste in that irregular home,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Philip. \xe2\x80\x98What can have possessed her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! something must have possessed her,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Eva was always\r\nready to be fallen in love with on the shortest notice, and if there\r\nwas not something prior in her imagination, Thorndale would not have had\r\nmuch difficulty. By the bye, depend upon it, \xe2\x80\x98tis the tutor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip looked a little startled, but instantly reassuring himself,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98George Fielder! Impossible! You have never seen him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember her description!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, in a low voice,\r\nrather sadly.\r\n\r\nThe very reason, Amy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles; \xe2\x80\x98it showed that he had attracted\r\nher fancy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip smiled a little incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98you may smile, but you handsome men can little\r\nappreciate the attractiveness of an interesting ugliness. It is the way\r\nto be looked at in the end. Mark my words, it is the tutor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope not!\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, as if shaken in his confidence. \xe2\x80\x98Any way it\r\nis a bad affair. I am very much concerned for Thorndale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo sincerely concerned, that his head began to ache in the midst of some\r\nwriting. He was obliged to leave it to Charles to finish, and go out to\r\nwalk with Amy.\r\n\r\nAmabel came in before him, and began to talk to Charles about his great\r\nvexation at his friend\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am almost sorry you threw out that hint about Mr. Fielder,\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember how he was recommended?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I had forgotten it was Philip\xe2\x80\x99s doing; a bit of his spirit of\r\nopposition,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Were not the boys to have gone to Coombe\r\nPrior?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, \xe2\x80\x98that is the thing that seems to have made him\r\nso unhappy about it. I am sure I hope it is not true,\xe2\x80\x99 she added,\r\nconsidering, \xe2\x80\x98for, Charlie, you must know that Guy had an impression\r\nagainst him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Had he?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was only an impression, nothing he could accuse him of, or mention\r\nto Lord Kilcoran. He would have told no one but me, but he had seen\r\nsomething of him at Oxford, and thought him full of conversation,\r\nvery clever, only not the sort of talk he liked.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\r\nCharlotte concurs in testifying to his agreeableness; and in the dearth\r\nof intellect, I should not wonder at Eva\xe2\x80\x99s taking up with him. He would\r\nbe a straw to the drowning. It looks dangerous.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey were very anxious for further intelligence, but received none,\r\nexcept that Philip had a letter from his friend, on which his only\r\ncomment was a deep sigh, and \xe2\x80\x98Poor Thorndale! She little knows what\r\nshe has thrown away!\xe2\x80\x99 Letters from Kilcoran became rare; Laura scarcely\r\nwrote at all to Philip, and though Mrs. Edmonstone wrote as usual, she\r\ndid not notice the subject; while Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s gravity and constraint,\r\nwhen she did achieve a letter to Charles, were in such contrast to her\r\nusual free and would-be satirical style, that such eyes as her brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncould hardly fail to see that something was on her mind.\r\n\r\nSo it went on week after week, Charles and Amabel wondering when they\r\nshould ever have any notice to go home, and what their family could be\r\ndoing in Ireland. October had given place to November, and more than a\r\nweek of November had passed, and here they still were, without anything\r\nlike real tidings.\r\n\r\nAt last came a letter from Mrs. Edmonstone, which Amabel could not\r\nread without one little cry of surprise and dismay, and then had some\r\ndifficulty in announcing its contents to Philip.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Kilcoran, Nov. 8th.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My Dearest Amy,--You will be extremely surprised at what I have to tell\r\nyou, and no less grieved. It has been a most unpleasant, disgraceful\r\nbusiness from beginning to end, and the only comfort in it to us is the\r\ngreat discretion and firmness that Charlotte has shown. I had better,\r\nhowever, begin at the beginning, and tell you the history as far as I\r\nunderstand it myself. You know that Mr. James Thorndale has been here,\r\nand perhaps you know it was for the purpose of making an offer to\r\nEveleen. Every one was much surprised at her refusing him, and still\r\nmore when, after much prevarication, it came out that the true motive\r\nwas her attachment to Mr. Fielder, the tutor. It appeared that they had\r\nbeen secretly engaged for some weeks, ever since they had perceived\r\nMr. Thorndale\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, and not, as it was in poor Laura\xe2\x80\x99s case,\r\nan unavowed attachment, but an absolute engagement. And fancy Eva\r\njustifying it by Laura\xe2\x80\x99s example! There was of course great anger and\r\nconfusion. Lord Kilcoran was furious, poor Lady Kilcoran had nervous\r\nattacks, the gentleman was dismissed from the house, and supposed to be\r\ngone to England, Eva shed abundance of tears, but after a great deal of\r\nvehemence she appeared subdued and submissive. We were all very sorry\r\nfor her, as there is much that is very agreeable and likely to attract\r\nher in Mr. Fielder, and she always had too much mind to be wasted in\r\nsuch a life as she leads here. It seemed as if Laura was a comfort\r\nto her, and Lady Kilcoran was very anxious we should stay as long\r\nas possible. This was all about three weeks or a month ago; Eva was\r\nrecovering her spirits, and I was just beginning a letter to tell you we\r\nhoped to be at home in another week, when Charlotte came into my room in\r\ngreat distress to tell me that Eveleen and Mr. Fielder were on the verge\r\nof a run-away marriage. Charlotte had been coming back alone from a\r\nvisit to grandmamma, and going down a path out of the direct way to\r\nrecall Bustle, who had run on, she said, as if he scented mischief,\r\ncame, to her great astonishment, on Eveleen walking arm-in-arm with Mr.\r\nFielder! Charlie will fancy how Charlotte looked at them! They shuffled,\r\nand tried to explain it away, but Charlotte was too acute for them, or\r\nrather, she held steadily to \xe2\x80\x9cbe that as it may, Lord Kilcoran ought\r\nto know it.\xe2\x80\x9d They tried to frighten her with the horrors of betraying\r\nsecrets, but she said none had been confided to her, and mamma would\r\njudge. They tried to persuade her it was the way of all lovers, and\r\nappealed to Laura s example, but there little Charlotte was less to be\r\nshaken than on any point. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not think them worthy to hear their\r\nnames,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I told them, that I had seen that the\r\ntruest and deepest of love had a horror of all that was like wrong,\r\nand as to Philip and Laura, they little knew what they had suffered;\r\nbesides, theirs was not half so bad.\xe2\x80\x9d I verily believe these were the\r\nvery words she used to them. At last Eva threw herself on her mercy,\r\nand begged so vehemently that she would only wait another day, that she\r\nsuspected, and, with sharpness very like Charlie\xe2\x80\x99s, forced from Eva that\r\nthey were to marry the next morning. Then she said it would be a great\r\ndeal better that they should abuse her and call her a spy than do what\r\nthey would repent of all their lives; she begged Eva\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, and cried\r\nso much that Eva was in hopes she would relent, and then came straight\r\nto me, very unhappy, and not in the least triumphant in her discovery.\r\nYou can guess what a dreadful afternoon we had, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any one\r\nwas more miserable than poor Charlotte, who stayed shut up in my room\r\nall day, dreading the sight of any one, and expecting to be universally\r\ncalled a traitor. The end was, that after much storming, Lord Kilcoran,\r\nfinding Eveleen determined, and anxious to save her the discredit of an\r\nelopement, has agreed to receive Mr. Fielder, and they are to be married\r\nfrom this house on the 6th of December, though what they are to live\r\nupon no one can guess. The Kilcorans are very anxious to put the best\r\nface on the matter possible, and have persuaded us, for the sake of\r\nthe family, to stay for the wedding; indeed, poor Lady Kilcoran is so\r\ncompletely overcome, that I hardly like to leave her till this is over.\r\nHow unpleasant the state of things in the house is no one can imagine,\r\nand very, very glad shall I be to get back to Hollywell and my Amy and\r\nCharlie. Dearest Amy,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your most affectionate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98L. EDMONSTONE.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news was at length told, and Philip was indeed thunder-struck at\r\nthis fresh consequence of his interference. It threatened at first to\r\noverthrow his scarcely recovered spirits, and but for the presence of\r\nhis guests, it seemed as if it might have brought on a renewal of the\r\nstate from which they had restored him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles to Amy, when they talked it over alone, \xe2\x80\x98It seems\r\nas if good people could do wrong with less impunity than others. It is\r\nrather like the saying about fools and angels. Light-minded people see\r\nthe sin, but not the repentance, so they imitate the one without being\r\ncapable of the other. Here are Philip and Laura finishing off like the\r\nend of a novel, fortune and all, and setting a very bad example to the\r\nworld in general.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As the world cannot see below the surface,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98how distressed\r\nLaura, must be! You see, mamma does not say one word about her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip had not much peace till he had written to Mr. Thorndale, who\r\nwas going at once to Germany, not liking to return home to meet the\r\ncondolences. Mrs. Edmonstone had nearly the whole correspondence of the\r\nfamily on her hands; for neither of her daughters liked to write, and\r\nshe gave the description of the various uncomfortable scenes that took\r\nplace. Lord de Courcy\xe2\x80\x99s stern and enduring displeasure, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfast subsiding violence; Lady Kilcoran\xe2\x80\x99s distress, and the younger\r\ngirls\xe2\x80\x99 excitement and amusement; but she said she thought the very\r\nproper and serious way in which Charlotte viewed it, would keep it from\r\ndoing them much harm, provided, as was much to be feared, Lord Kilcoran\r\ndid not end by keeping the pair always at home, living upon him till Mr.\r\nFielder could get a situation. In fact, it was difficult to know what\r\nother means there were of providing for them.\r\n\r\nAt last the wedding took place, and Mrs. Edmonstone wrote a letter,\r\ndivided between indignation at the foolish display that had attended it,\r\nand satisfaction at being able at length to fix the day for the meeting\r\nat Hollywell. No one could guess how she longed to be at home again, and\r\nto be once more with Charlie.\r\n\r\nNor were Charles and Amabel less ready to go home, though they could\r\nboth truly say that they had much enjoyed their stay at Redclyffe.\r\nPhilip was to come with them, and it was privately agreed that he should\r\nreturn to Redclyffe no more till he could bring Laura with him. Amabel\r\nhad talked of her sister to Mrs. Ashford, and done much to smooth the\r\nway; and even on the last day or two, held a few consultations with\r\nPhilip, as to the arrangements that Laura would like. One thing,\r\nhowever, she must ask for her own pleasure. \xe2\x80\x98Philip,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmust let me have this piano.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis answer was by look and gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I want very much to ask a question, Philip. Will you tell me which\r\nis Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s picture?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have been sitting opposite to it every day at dinner.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amy. \xe2\x80\x98From what I heard, I fully expected to have\r\nknown Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s in a moment, and I often looked at that one, but I\r\nnever could see more likeness than there is in almost all the pictures\r\nabout the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe went at once to study it again, and wondered more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have seen him sometimes look like it; but it is not at all the strong\r\nlikeness I expected.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPhilip stood silently gazing, and certainly the countenance he recalled,\r\npleading with him to desist from his wilfulness, and bending over him\r\nin his sickness, was far unlike in expression to the fiery youth before\r\nhim. In a few moments more, Amabel had run up-stairs, and brought down\r\nMr. Shene\xe2\x80\x99s portrait. There was proved to be more resemblance than\r\neither of them had at first sight credited. The form of the forehead,\r\nnose, and short upper lip were identical, so were the sharply-defined\r\nblack eyebrows, the colour of the eyes; and the way of standing in both\r\nhad a curious similarity; but the expression was so entirely different,\r\nthat strict comparison alone proved, that Guy\xe2\x80\x99s animated, contemplative,\r\nand most winning countenance, was in its original lineaments entirely\r\nthe same with that of his ancestor. Although Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s was then far\r\nfrom unprepossessing, and bore as yet no trace of his unholy passions,\r\nit bought to Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s mind the shudder with which Guy had mentioned\r\nhis likeness to that picture, and seemed to show her the nature he had\r\ntamed.\r\n\r\nPhilip, meanwhile, after one glance at Mr. Shene\xe2\x80\x99s portrait, which he\r\nhad not before seen, had turned away, and stood leaning against the\r\nwindow-frame. When Amy had finished her silent comparison, and was\r\ngoing to take her treasure back, he looked up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Do you dislike\r\nleaving that with me for a few minutes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Keep it as long as you like,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, going at once, and she saw him\r\nno more till nearly an hour after; when, as she was coming out of her\r\nown room, he met her, and gave it into her hands, saying nothing except\r\na smothered \xe2\x80\x98Thank you;\xe2\x80\x99 but his eyelids were so swollen and heavy, that\r\nCharles feared his head was bad again, while Amy was glad to perceive\r\nthat he had had the comfort of tears.\r\n\r\nEvery one was sorry to wish Lady Morville and her brother good-bye, only\r\nconsoling themselves with hoping that their sister might be like them;\r\nand as to little Mary, the attention paid to her was so devoted and\r\nuniversal, that her mamma thought it very well she should receive the\r\nfirst ardour of it while she was too young to have her head turned.\r\n\r\nThey again slept a night in London, and in the morning Philip took\r\nCharles for a drive through the places he had heard of, and was much\r\nedified by actually beholding. They were safely at home the same\r\nevening, and on the following, the Hollywell party was once more\r\ncomplete, gathered round Charles\xe2\x80\x99s sofa in a confusion of welcomes and\r\ngreetings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edmonstone could hardly believe her eyes, so much had Charles\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountenance lost its invalid look, and his movements were so much more\r\nactive; Amabel, too, though still white and thin, had a life in her eye\r\nand an air of health most unlike her languor and depression.\r\n\r\nEvery one looked well and happy but Laura, and she had a worn, faded,\r\nharassed aspect, which was not cheered even by Philip\xe2\x80\x99s presence;\r\nindeed, she seemed almost to shrink from speaking to him. She was the\r\nonly silent one of the party that evening, as they gathered round the\r\ndinner or tea-table, or sat divided into threes or pairs, talking over\r\nthe subjects that would not do to be discussed in public. Charlotte\r\ngenerally niched into Amy\xe2\x80\x99s old corner by Charles, hearing about\r\nRedclyffe, or telling about Ireland. Mrs. Edmonstone and Amy on the\r\nopposite sides of the ottoman, their heads meeting over the central\r\ncushion, talking in low, fond, inaudible tones; Mr. Edmonstone going in\r\nand out of the room, and joining himself to one or other group, telling\r\nand hearing news, and sometimes breaking up the pairs; and then Mrs.\r\nEdmonstone came to congratulate Charles on Amy\xe2\x80\x99s improved looks, or\r\nCharlotte pressed up close to Amy to tell her about grandmamma. For\r\nCharlotte could not talk about Eveleen, she had been so uncomfortable at\r\nthe part she had had to act, that all the commendation she received was\r\nonly like pain and shame, and her mother was by no means dissatisfied\r\nthat it should be so, since a degree of forwardness had been her chief\r\ncause of anxiety in Charlotte; and it now appeared that without losing\r\nher high spirit and uncompromising sense of right, her sixteenth year\r\nwas bringing with it feminine reserve.\r\n\r\nLaura lingered late in Amabel\xe2\x80\x99s room, and when her mother had wished\r\nthem good night, and left them together, she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Amy! I am\r\nso glad to be come back to you. I have been so very miserable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you see he is quite well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98We think him looking better\r\nthan in the summer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98O yes! Oh, Amy, what have you not done? If you could guess the relief\r\nof hearing you were with him, after that suspense!\xe2\x80\x99 But as if losing\r\nthat subject in one she was still more eager about, \xe2\x80\x98What did he think\r\nof me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am the right person to tell you\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw how it struck him when he heard of my share in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yours? Mamma never mentioned you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Always kind!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Amy! what will you think of me when I\r\ntell I knew poor Eva\xe2\x80\x99s secret all the time? What could I do, when Eva\r\npleaded my own case? It was very different, but she would not see it,\r\nand I felt as if I was guilty of all. Oh, how I envied Charlotte.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Laura, no wonder you were unhappy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing hitherto has been equal to it! said Laura. \xe2\x80\x98There was the\r\nmisery of his silence, and the anxiety that you, dearest, freed me from,\r\nthen no sooner was that over than this was confided to me. Think what I\r\nfelt when Eva put me in mind of a time when I argued in favour of\r\nsome such concealment in a novel! No, you can never guess what I went\r\nthrough, knowing that he would think me weak, blameable, unworthy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, he blames himself too much to blame you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that he must not do! It was my fault from the beginning. If I had\r\nbut gone at once to mamma!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I am so glad!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Amy, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Glad?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I mean,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, looking down, \xe2\x80\x98now you have said that, I am sure you\r\nwill be happier.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Happier, now I feel and see how I have lowered myself even in his\r\nsight?\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, drooping her head and hiding her face in her hands,\r\nas she went on in so low a tone that Amy could hardly hear her. \xe2\x80\x98I know\r\nit all now. He loves me still, as he must whatever he has once taken,\r\ninto that deep, deep heart of his: he will always; but he cannot have\r\nthat honouring, trusting, confiding love that--you enjoyed and deserved,\r\nAmy--that he would have had if I had cared first for what became me. If\r\nI had only at first told mamma, he would not even have been blamed; he\r\nwould have been spared half this suffering and self-reproach; he would\r\nhave loved me more; Eva might not have been led astray, at least she\r\ncould not have laid it to my charge,--and I could lift up my head,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nfinished, as she hung it almost to her knees.\r\n\r\nHer sister raised the head, laid it on her own bosom, and kissed, the\r\ncheeks and brow again and again. \xe2\x80\x98Dearest, dearest Laura, I am so sorry\r\nfor you; but I am sure you must feel freer and happier now you know it\r\nall, and see the truth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And at least you will be better able to comfort him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, I shall only add to his self-reproach. He will see more plainly\r\nwhat a wretched weak creature he fancied had firmness and discretion.\r\nOh, what a broken reed I have been to him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is strength and comfort for us all to lean upon,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98But\r\nyou ought to go to bed. Shall I read to you, Laura? you are so tired, I\r\nshould like to come and read you to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura was not given to concealments; that fatal one had been her only\r\ninsincerity, and she never thought of doing otherwise than telling the\r\nwhole of her conduct in Ireland to Philip. She sat alone with him the\r\nnext morning, explained all, and entreated his pardon, humiliating\r\nherself so much, that he could not bear to hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was the fault of our whole lifetime, Laura,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, recovering\r\nhimself, when a few agitated words had passed on either side. \xe2\x80\x98I taught\r\nyou to take my dictum for law, and abused your trusty and perverted all\r\nthe best and most precious qualities. It is I who stand first to bear\r\nthe blame, and would that I could bear all the suffering! But as it is,\r\nLaura, we must look to enduring the consequence all our lives, and give\r\neach other what support we may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLaura could hardly brook his self-accusation, but she could no longer\r\nargue the point; and there was far more peace and truth before them than\r\nwhen she believed him infallible, and therefore justified herself for\r\nall she had done in blind obedience to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 44\r\n\r\n     Thus souls by nature pitched too high,\r\n       By sufferings plunged too low,\r\n     Meet in the church\xe2\x80\x99s middle sky,\r\n       Halfway \xe2\x80\x98twixt joy and woe;\r\n\r\n     To practise there the soothing lay,\r\n       That sorrow best relieves,\r\n     Thankful for all God takes away,\r\n       Humbled by all He gives.\r\n                       --CHRISTIAN YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Afternoon, late in April, Charles opened the dressing-room door, and\r\npaused a moment, smiling. There sat Amabel on the floor before the fire,\r\nher hand stretched out, playfully holding back the little one, who, with\r\nscanty, flossy, silken curls, hazel eyes and jet-black lashes, plump,\r\nmottled arms, and tiny tottering feet, stood crowing and shouting in\r\nexulting laughter, having just made a triumphant clutch at her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair, and pulled down all the light, shining locks, while under their\r\nshade the reddening, smiling face recalled the Amy of days long gone by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right! cried Charles, delighted, \xe2\x80\x98pull it all down. Out with\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s own curls again!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I can never wear my curls again,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, so mournfully, that\r\nhe was sorry he had referred to them; and perceiving this, she smiled\r\nsweetly, and pulling a tress to its full length, showed how much too\r\nshort it was for anything but being put plainly under the cap, to which\r\nshe restored it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is Mrs. Henley come?\xe2\x80\x99 she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As large as life, and that is saying a good deal. She would make two of\r\nPhilip. As tall and twice as broad. I thought Juno herself was advancing\r\non me from the station.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How did you get on with her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Famously; I told her all about everything, and how the affair is to be\r\nreally quiet, which she had never believed. She could hardly believe my\r\nword, when I told her there was to be absolutely no one but ourselves\r\nand Mary Ross. She supposed it was for your sake, and I did not tell her\r\nit was for their own. It really was providential that the Kilcoran folk\r\ndisgusted my father with grand weddings, for Philip never could endure\r\none.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Miss Mischief, there goes my hair again! You know Philip is\r\nexceedingly worried about Mr. Fielder. Lord Kilcoran has been writing to\r\nask him to find him a situation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is an article they will be seeking all the rest of their lives,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles. \xe2\x80\x98A man is done for when he begins to look for a situation!\r\nYes, those Fielders will be a drag on Philip and Laura for ever; for\r\nthey don\xe2\x80\x99t quite like to cast them off, feeling as he does that he led\r\nto her getting into the scrape, by recommending him; and poor Laura\r\nthinking she set the example.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish Eva was away from home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy, \xe2\x80\x98for Aunt Charlotte\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccounts of her vex Laura so much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay! trying to eat her cake and have it, expecting to be Mr. Fielder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife, and reign as the earl\xe2\x80\x99s daughter all the same. Poor thing! the day\r\nthey get the situation will be a sad one for her. She does not know what\r\npoortith cauld will be like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Eva!\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98I dare say she will shine and be all the better\r\nfor trouble. There is much that is so very nice in her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, if she has not spoilt it all by this time,--as that creature is\r\ndoing with your hair! You little monkey, what have you to say to me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only to wish you good night. Come, baby, we must go to Anne. Good\r\nnight, Uncle Charles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust as Amabel had borne off her little girl, Mrs. Edmonstone and\r\nCharlotte came in, after conducting Mrs. Henley to her room. Charlotte\r\nmade a face of wonder and dismay, and Mrs. Edmonstone asked where Amy\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She carried the baby to the nursery just before you came. I wish you\r\nhad seen her. The little thing had pulled down her hair and made her\r\nlook so pretty and like herself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How well her spirits keep up! She has been running up and down stairs\r\nall day, helping about everything. Well! we little thought how things\r\nwould turn out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And that after all Amy would be the home-bird,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel as if it was wrong to rejoice in having her in this sweet, shady\r\nbrightness, as she is now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know whether she means to go to church to-morrow? I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nto ask.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nor I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know she does,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte. \xe2\x80\x98She told me so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I hope it will not be too much for her! Dear Amy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She would say it was wrong to have our heads fuller of her than of our\r\nbride,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor Laura!\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98I am glad it is all right at last.\r\nThey have both gone through a great deal.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And not in vain,\xe2\x80\x99 added Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Philip is--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I say not a word against him!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98He is most\r\nexcellent; he will be very distinguished,--he will make her very happy.\r\nYes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In fact,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98he is made to be one of the first in this\r\nworld, and to be first by being above it; and the only reason we are\r\nalmost discontented is, that we compare him with one who was too good\r\nfor this world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not only that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! you did not see him at Redclyffe, or you would do more than simply\r\nforgiving him as a Christian.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is not quite enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, smiling, with a mischievous\r\nair, though fully in earnest. \xe2\x80\x98Is it, Charlotte? She must take him home\r\nto her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s own heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no, that is asking too much, Charlie,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone. \xe2\x80\x98Only\r\none ever was--\xe2\x80\x99 then breaking off--\xe2\x80\x98and I can never think of Philip as I\r\nused to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I like him much better now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For my part,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98I never liked him--nay, that\xe2\x80\x99s too mild, I\r\ncould not abide him, I rebelled against him, heart, soul, and taste. If\r\nit had not been for Guy, his fashion of goodness would have made me into\r\nan extract of gall and wormwood, at the very time you admired him, and\r\nyet a great deal of it was genuine. But it is only now that I have liked\r\nhim. Nay, I look up to him, I think him positively noble and grand, and\r\nwhen I see proofs of his being entirely repentant, I perceive he is a\r\nthorough great man. If I had not seen one greater, I should follow his\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s example and take him for my hero model.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if you wanted a hero model,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Charlotte, in a tone between\r\ncaressing and impertinence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve had one!\xe2\x80\x99 returned Charles, also aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs. Edmonstone, going on with her own thoughts, \xe2\x80\x98unless\r\nthere had been a great fund of real goodness, he would never have felt\r\nit so deeply. Indeed, even when I best liked Philip, I never thought him\r\ncapable of such repentance as he has shown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If mamma wants to like him very much,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte, \xe2\x80\x98I think she has\r\nonly to look at our other company.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay!\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles, \xe2\x80\x98we want no more explanation of the tone of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d with which he answered the offer to invite his sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One comfort is, she can\xe2\x80\x99t stay long. She has got a committee meeting\r\nfor the Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Literary and Scientific Association, and must go home\r\nfor it the day after to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charlotte.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you are very good, perhaps she will give you a ticket, Charlotte,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid her brother, \xe2\x80\x98and another for Bustle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley was, meanwhile, highly satisfied with the impression she\r\nthought she was making on her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s family, especially on Charles and\r\nCharlotte. The latter she patronized, to her extreme though suppressed\r\nindignation, as a clever, promising girl; the former, she discovered to\r\nbe a very superior young man, a most valuable assistant to her brother\r\nin his business, and her self-complacency prevented her from finding out\r\nhow he was playing her off, whenever neither Philip nor Laura were at\r\nhand to be hurt by it.\r\n\r\nShe thought Laura a fine-looking person, like her own family, and fit to\r\nbe an excellent lady of the house; and in spite of the want of fortune,\r\nshe perceived that her brother\xe2\x80\x99s choice had been far better than if he\r\nhad married that poor pale little Amabel, go silent and quiet that she\r\nnever could make a figure anywhere, and had nothing like the substantive\r\ncharacter that her brother must have in a wife.\r\n\r\nCould Mrs. Henley have looked behind the scenes she would have\r\nmarvelled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One kiss for mamma; and one for papa,\xe2\x80\x99 was Amy\xe2\x80\x99s half-uttered morning\r\ngreeting, as she lifted from her cot her little one, with cheeks flushed\r\nby sleep. Morning and evening Amy spoke those words, and was happy in\r\nthe double kiss that Mary had learnt to connect with them; happy too\r\nin holding her up to the picture, and saying \xe2\x80\x98papa,\xe2\x80\x99 so that his child\r\nmight never recollect a time when he had not been a familiar and beloved\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nA little play with the merry child, then came Anne to take her away; and\r\nwith a suppressed sigh, Amabel dressed for the first time without her\r\nweeds, which she had promised to leave off on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s wedding-day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I will not sigh!\xe2\x80\x99 then she thought, \xe2\x80\x98it does not put me further\r\nfrom him. He would be more glad than any one this day, and so I must\r\nshow some sign of gladness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo she put on such a dress as would be hers for life--black silk, and\r\nface cap over her still plain hair, then with real pleasure she put on\r\nCharles\xe2\x80\x99s bracelet, and the silver brooch, which she had last worn the\r\nevening when the echoes of Recoara had answered Guy\xe2\x80\x99s last chant. Soon\r\nshe was visiting Laura, cheering her, soothing her agitation, helping\r\nher to dress in her bridal array, much plainer than Amy\xe2\x80\x99s own had been,\r\nfor it had been the especial wish of both herself and Philip that their\r\nwedding should be as quiet and unlike Guy\xe2\x80\x99s as possible. Then Amabel\r\nwas running down-stairs to see that all was right, thinking the\r\nbreakfast-table looked dull and forlorn, and calling Charlotte to\r\nhelp her to make it appear a little more festal, with the aid of some\r\nflowers. Charlotte wondered to see that she had forgotten how she\r\nshunned flowers last summer, for there she was flitting from one old\r\nfamiliar plant to another in search of the choicest, arranging little\r\nbouquets with her own peculiar grace and taste, and putting them by each\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x99s place, in readiness to receive them.\r\n\r\nIt was as if no one else could smile that morning, except Mr.\r\nEdmonstone, who was so pleased to see her looking cheerful, in her\r\naltered dress, that he kissed her repeatedly, and confidentially told\r\nMrs. Henley that his little Amy was a regular darling, the sweetest girl\r\nin the world, poor dear, except Laura.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley, in the richest of all silks, looked magnificent and\r\nsuperior. Mrs. Edmonstone had tears in her eyes, and attended to every\r\none softly and kindly, without a word; Charlotte was grave, helpful,\r\nand thoughtful; Charles watching every one, and intent on making things\r\nsmooth; Laura looked fixed in the forced composure which she had long\r\nago learnt, and Philip,--it was late before he appeared at all, and\r\nwhen he came down, there was nothing so plainly written on his face as\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\nIt was so severe that the most merciful thing was to send him to lie\r\non the sofa in the dressing-room. Amabel said she would fetch him\r\nsome camphor, and disappeared, while Laura sat still with her forced\r\ncomposure. Her father fidgeted, only restrained by her presence from\r\nexpressing his fears that Philip was too unwell for the marriage to take\r\nplace to-day, and Charles talked cheerfully of the great improvement in\r\nhis general health, saying this was but a chance thing, and that on the\r\nwhole he might be considered as quite restored.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henley listened and answered, but could not comprehend the state of\r\nthings. Breakfast was over, when she heard Amabel speaking to Laura in\r\nthe ante-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will go off soon. Here is a cup of hot coffee for you to take him.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll call you when it is time to go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel and Charlotte were very busy looking after Laura\xe2\x80\x99s packing up,\r\nand putting all that was wanted into the carriage, in which the pair\r\nwere to set off at once from church, without returning to Hollywell.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment she went to warn Philip it was time to go, if he\r\nmeant to walk to church alone, the best thing for his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is better,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, somewhat comforted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Much better for your bathing it, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip, rising; then,\r\nturning to Amy,--\xe2\x80\x98Do I wish you good-bye now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, I shall see you at church, unless you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to have my\r\nblackness there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Would we not have our guardian angel, Laura?\xe2\x80\x99 said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You know _he_ would have been there,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amy. \xe2\x80\x98No one would have been\r\nmore glad, so thank you for letting me come.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you for coming,\xe2\x80\x99 said Laura, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98It is a comfort.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey left her, and she stood a few minutes to enjoy the solitude, and\r\nto look from the window at her little girl, whom she had sent out with\r\nAnne. She was just about to open the window to call to her, and make her\r\nlook up with one of her merry shouts of \xe2\x80\x98Mamma!\xe2\x80\x99 when Philip came out at\r\nthe garden-door, and was crossing the lawn. Mary was very fond of him,\r\nflattered by the attention of the tallest person in the house, and she\r\nstretched her arms, and gave a cry of summons. Amabel watched him turn\r\ninstantly, take her from her nurse, and hold her in a close embrace,\r\nwhilst her little round arms met round his neck. She was unwilling to\r\nbe restored to Anne, and when he left she looked up in his face, and\r\nunprompted, held up to him the primroses and violets in her hand.\r\n\r\nThose flowers were in his coat when Amabel saw him again at church,\r\nand she knew that this spontaneous proof of affection from Guy\xe2\x80\x99s little\r\nunconscious child was more precious to him than all the kindnesses she\r\ncould bestow.\r\n\r\nLittle space was there for musing, for it was high time to set off for\r\nchurch. Mary Ross met the party at the wicket of the churchyard, took\r\nCharles on her arm, and by look and sign inquired for Amy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bright outwardly,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98and I think so inwardly. Nothing does\r\nher so much good as to represent him. Did you wonder to see her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 said Mary. \xe2\x80\x98I thought she would come. It is the crowning point of\r\nhis forgiveness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such forgiveness that she has forgotten there is anything to forgive,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Charles.\r\n\r\nPhilip Morville and Laura Edmonstone stood before Mr. Ross. It was not\r\nsuch a wedding as the last. There was more personal beauty, but no such\r\nair of freshness, youth, and peace. He was, indeed, a very fine-looking\r\nman, his countenance more noble than it had ever been, though pale and\r\nnot only betraying the present suffering of the throbbing, burning brow,\r\nbut with the appearance of a care-worn, harassed man, looking more as if\r\nhis age was five-and-thirty than eight-and-twenty. And she, in her plain\r\nwhite muslin and quiet bonnet, was hardly bridal-looking in dress, and\r\nso it was with her face, still beautiful and brilliant in complexion,\r\nbut with the weight of care permanent on it, and all the shades of\r\nfeeling concealed by a fixed command of countenance, unable, however, to\r\nhide the oppression of dejection and anxiety.\r\n\r\nYet to the eyes that only beheld the surface, there was nothing but\r\nprosperity and happiness in a marriage between a pair who had loved so\r\nlong and devotedly, and after going through so much for each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, were united at length, with wealth, honour, and distinction before\r\nthem. His health was re-established, and the last spring had proved\r\nthat his talents would place him in such a position as had been the\r\nvery object of his highest hopes. Was not everything here for which the\r\nfondest and most aspiring wishes could seek? Yet for the very reason\r\nthat there was sadness at almost every heart, not one tear was shed.\r\nMrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts were less engrossed with the bride than with\r\nthe young slender figure in black, standing in her own drooping way,\r\nher head bent down, and the fingers of her right hand clasping tight her\r\nwedding-ring, through her white glove.\r\n\r\nThe service was over. Laura hung round her mother\xe2\x80\x99s neck in an ardent\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Your pardon! O, mamma, I see it all now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor thing! she had too much failed in a daughter\xe2\x80\x99s part to go forth\r\nfrom her home with the clear, loving, hopeful heart her sister had\r\ncarried from it! Mrs. Edmonstone\xe2\x80\x99s kiss was a full answer, however, a\r\nkiss unlike what it had been with all her efforts for many and many a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, pray that it may not be visited!\xe2\x80\x99 were the last words breathed to\r\nher sister, as they were pressed in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\nPhilip scarcely spoke, only met their kindnesses with grateful gestures\r\nand looks, and brief replies, and the parting was hastened that he might\r\nas soon as possible be at rest. His only voluntary speech was as he bade\r\nfarewell to Amabel,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My sister now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And _his_ brother,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs soon as Amabel was alone in the carriage with Charles, she leant\r\nback, and gave way to a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, has it been too much?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, recovering herself; \xe2\x80\x98but I am so glad! It was _his_\r\nchief desire. Now everything he wished is fulfilled.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you are free of your great charge. He has been a considerable care\r\nto you, but now he is safe on Laura\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and well and satisfactory;\r\nso you have no care but your daughter, and we settle into our home\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Amy, I do wish I was sure you are happy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear Charlie, indeed I am. You are all so very kind to me, and it\r\nis a blessing, indeed, that my own dear home can open to take in me and\r\nbaby. You know _he_ liked giving me back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And it is happiness, not only thinking it ought to be! Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\ntease you, Amy, don\xe2\x80\x99t answer if you had rather not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Charlie, it _is_ happiness. It must be when I remember how\r\nvery happy he used to be, and there can be nothing to spoil it. When\r\nI see how all the duties of his station worry and perplex Philip, I am\r\nglad he was spared from it, and had all his freshness and brightness\r\nhis whole life. It beams out on me more now, and it was such perfect\r\nhappiness while I had him here, and it is such a pleasure and honour to\r\nbe called by his name; besides, there is baby. Oh! Charlie, I must be\r\nhappy--I am; do believe it! Indeed, you know I have you and mamma and\r\nall too. And, Charlie, I think he made you all precious to me over again\r\nby the way he loved you all, and sent me back, to you especially. Yes,\r\nCharlie, you must not fancy I grieve. I am very happy, for he is, and\r\nall I have is made bright and precious by him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, looking at her, as the colour had come into her face,\r\nand she looked perfectly lovely with eager, sincere happiness; one of\r\nher husband\xe2\x80\x99s sweetest looks reflected on her face; altogether, such a\r\npicture of youth, joy, and love, as had not been displayed by the\r\nbride that morning. \xe2\x80\x98Amy, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe anything could make you long\r\nunhappy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nothing but my own fault. Nothing else can part me from him,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nwhispered almost to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; no one else had such a power of making happy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles,\r\nthoughtfully. \xe2\x80\x98Amy, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether even you owe as much\r\nto your husband as I do. You were good for something before, but when\r\nI look back on what I was when first he came, I know that his leading,\r\nunconscious as it was, brought out the stifled good in me. What a wretch\r\nI should have been; what a misery to myself and to you all by this time,\r\nand now, I verily believe, that since he let in the sunlight from heaven\r\non me, I am better off than if I had as many legs as other people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better off?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes. Nobody else lives in such an atmosphere of petting, and has so\r\nlittle to plague them. Nobody else has such a \xe2\x80\x9cmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d to say nothing of\r\nsilly little Amy, or Charlotte, or Miss Morville. And as to being of\r\nno use, which I used to pine about--why, when the member for Moorworth\r\ngoverns the country, I mean to govern him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am sure you are of wonderful use to every one,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel; \xe2\x80\x98neither\r\nPhilip nor papa could get on without you to do their writing for them.\r\nBesides, I want you to help me when baby grows older.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is that the laudable result of that great book on education I saw you\r\nreading the other day?\xe2\x80\x99 said Charles. \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you borrow a few hints\r\nfrom Mrs. Henley?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmy\xe2\x80\x99s clear, playful laugh was just what it used to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is all settled, then, that you go on with us! Not that I ever\r\nthought you were going to do anything so absurd as to set up for\r\nyourself, you silly little woman: but it seems to be considered right\r\nto come to a formal settlement about such a grand personage as my Lady\r\nMorville.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; it was better to come to an understanding,\xe2\x80\x99 said Amabel. \xe2\x80\x98It was\r\nbetter that papa should make up his mind to see that I can\xe2\x80\x99t turn into a\r\nyoung lady again. You see Charlotte will go out with him and be the Miss\r\nEdmonstone for company, and he is so proud of her liveliness and--how\r\npretty she is growing--so that will keep him from being vexed. So\r\nnow you see I can go on my own way, attend to baby, and take Laura\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness about the school, and keep out of the way of company, so that\r\nit is very nice and comfortable. It is the very thing that Guy wished!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAmabel\xe2\x80\x99s life is here pretty well shown. That of Philip and Laura may\r\nbe guessed at. He was a distinguished man, one of the most honoured and\r\nrespected in the country, admired for his talents and excellence, and\r\nregarded universally as highly prosperous and fortunate, the pride of\r\nall who had any connection with him. Yet it was a harassed, anxious\r\nlife, with little of repose or relief; and Laura spent her time between\r\nwatching him and tending his health, and in the cares and representation\r\nbefitting her station, with little space for domestic pleasure and\r\nhome comfort, knowing her children more intimately through her sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation than through her own.\r\n\r\nPerfect and devoted as ever was their love, and they were thought most\r\nadmirable and happy people. There was some wonder at his being a grave,\r\nmelancholy man, when he had all before him so richly to enjoy, contrary\r\nto every probability when he began life. Still there was one who never\r\ncould understand why others should think him stern and severe, and why\r\neven his own children should look up to him with love that partook\r\nof distant awe and respect, one to whom he never was otherwise than\r\nindulgent, nay, almost reverential, in the gentleness of his kindness,\r\nand that was Mary Verena Morville.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s The Heir of Redclyffe, by Charlotte M.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
