NAT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, sir, is this Plumfield?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a ragged boy of the man who\r\nopened the great gate at which the omnibus left him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Who sent you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Laurence. I have got a letter for the lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; go up to the house, and give it to her; she'll see to you,\r\nlittle chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man spoke pleasantly, and the boy went on, feeling much cheered by\r\nthe words. Through the soft spring rain that fell on sprouting grass\r\nand budding trees, Nat saw a large square house before him, a\r\nhospitable-looking house, with an old-fashioned porch, wide steps, and\r\nlights shining in many windows. Neither curtains nor shutters hid the\r\ncheerful glimmer; and, pausing a moment before he rang, Nat saw many\r\nlittle shadows dancing on the walls, heard the pleasant hum of young\r\nvoices, and felt that it was hardly possible that the light and warmth\r\nand comfort within could be for a homeless \xe2\x80\x9clittle chap\xe2\x80\x9d like him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the lady will see to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, and gave a timid rap with\r\nthe great bronze knocker, which was a jovial griffin's head.\r\n\r\nA rosy-faced servant-maid opened the door, and smiled as she took the\r\nletter which he silently offered. She seemed used to receiving strange\r\nboys, for she pointed to a seat in the hall, and said, with a nod:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit there and drip on the mat a bit, while I take this in to missis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat found plenty to amuse him while he waited, and stared about him\r\ncuriously, enjoying the view, yet glad to do so unobserved in the dusky\r\nrecess by the door.\r\n\r\nThe house seemed swarming with boys, who were beguiling the rainy\r\ntwilight with all sorts of amusements. There were boys everywhere,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cup-stairs and down-stairs and in the lady's chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d apparently, for\r\nvarious open doors showed pleasant groups of big boys, little boys,\r\nand middle-sized boys in all stages of evening relaxation, not to say\r\neffervescence. Two large rooms on the right were evidently schoolrooms,\r\nfor desks, maps, blackboards, and books were scattered about. An open\r\nfire burned on the hearth, and several indolent lads lay on their backs\r\nbefore it, discussing a new cricket-ground, with such animation that\r\ntheir boots waved in the air. A tall youth was practising on the flute\r\nin one corner, quite undisturbed by the racket all about him. Two or\r\nthree others were jumping over the desks, pausing, now and then, to get\r\ntheir breath and laugh at the droll sketches of a little wag who was\r\ncaricaturing the whole household on a blackboard.\r\n\r\nIn the room on the left a long supper-table was seen, set forth with\r\ngreat pitchers of new milk, piles of brown and white bread, and perfect\r\nstacks of the shiny gingerbread so dear to boyish souls. A flavor of\r\ntoast was in the air, also suggestions of baked apples, very tantalizing\r\nto one hungry little nose and stomach.\r\n\r\nThe hall, however, presented the most inviting prospect of all, for\r\na brisk game of tag was going on in the upper entry. One landing\r\nwas devoted to marbles, the other to checkers, while the stairs were\r\noccupied by a boy reading, a girl singing a lullaby to her doll, two\r\npuppies, a kitten, and a constant succession of small boys sliding down\r\nthe banisters, to the great detriment of their clothes and danger to\r\ntheir limbs.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed did Nat become in this exciting race, that he ventured\r\nfarther and farther out of his corner; and when one very lively boy\r\ncame down so swiftly that he could not stop himself, but fell off the\r\nbanisters, with a crash that would have broken any head but one rendered\r\nnearly as hard as a cannon-ball by eleven years of constant bumping, Nat\r\nforgot himself, and ran up to the fallen rider, expecting to find him\r\nhalf-dead. The boy, however, only winked rapidly for a second, then lay\r\ncalmly looking up at the new face with a surprised, \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Nat, not knowing what else to say, and thinking that\r\nform of reply both brief and easy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a new boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the recumbent youth, without stirring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't know yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat Blake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine's Tommy Bangs. Come up and have a go, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy got\r\nupon his legs like one suddenly remembering the duties of hospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess I won't, till I see whether I'm going to stay or not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nNat, feeling the desire to stay increase every moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Demi, here's a new one. Come and see to him;\xe2\x80\x9d and the lively\r\nThomas returned to his sport with unabated relish.\r\n\r\nAt his call, the boy reading on the stairs looked up with a pair of big\r\nbrown eyes, and after an instant's pause, as if a little shy, he put the\r\nbook under his arm, and came soberly down to greet the new-comer, who\r\nfound something very attractive in the pleasant face of this slender,\r\nmild-eyed boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Aunt Jo?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as if that was some sort of important\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven't seen anybody yet but you boys; I'm waiting,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Uncle Laurie send you?\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Demi, politely, but gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Laurence did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is Uncle Laurie; and he always sends nice boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat looked gratified at the remark, and smiled, in a way that made his\r\nthin face very pleasant. He did not know what to say next, so the two\r\nstood staring at one another in friendly silence, till the little girl\r\ncame up with her doll in her arms. She was very like Demi, only not so\r\ntall, and had a rounder, rosier face, and blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my sister, Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Demi, as if presenting a rare and\r\nprecious creature.\r\n\r\nThe children nodded to one another; and the little girl's face dimpled\r\nwith pleasure, as she said affably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you'll stay. We have such good times here; don't we, Demi?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we do: that's what Aunt Jo has Plumfield for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a very nice place indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nat, feeling that he must\r\nrespond to these amiable young persons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the nicest place in the world, isn't it, Demi?\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, who\r\nevidently regarded her brother as authority on all subjects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think Greenland, where the icebergs and seals are, is more\r\ninteresting. But I'm fond of Plumfield, and it is a very nice place\r\nto be in,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Demi, who was interested just now in a book on\r\nGreenland. He was about to offer to show Nat the pictures and\r\nexplain them, when the servant returned, saying with a nod toward the\r\nparlor-door:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; you are to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm glad; now come to Aunt Jo.\xe2\x80\x9d And Daisy took him by the hand with a\r\npretty protecting air, which made Nat feel at home at once.\r\n\r\nDemi returned to his beloved book, while his sister led the new-comer\r\ninto a back room, where a stout gentleman was frolicking with two little\r\nboys on the sofa, and a thin lady was just finishing the letter which\r\nshe seemed to have been re-reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is, aunty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this is my new boy? I am glad to see you, my dear, and hope you'll\r\nbe happy here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, drawing him to her, and stroking back the\r\nhair from his forehead with a kind hand and a motherly look, which made\r\nNat's lonely little heart yearn toward her.\r\n\r\nShe was not at all handsome, but she had a merry sort of face that never\r\nseemed to have forgotten certain childish ways and looks, any more than\r\nher voice and manner had; and these things, hard to describe but very\r\nplain to see and feel, made her a genial, comfortable kind of person,\r\neasy to get on with, and generally \xe2\x80\x9cjolly,\xe2\x80\x9d as boys would say. She saw\r\nthe little tremble of Nat's lips as she smoothed his hair, and her keen\r\neyes grew softer, but she only drew the shabby figure nearer and said,\r\nlaughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Mother Bhaer, that gentleman is Father Bhaer, and these are the\r\ntwo little Bhaers. Come here, boys, and see Nat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three wrestlers obeyed at once; and the stout man, with a chubby\r\nchild on each shoulder, came up to welcome the new boy. Rob and Teddy\r\nmerely grinned at him, but Mr. Bhaer shook hands, and pointing to a low\r\nchair near the fire, said, in a cordial voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a place all ready for thee, my son; sit down and dry thy wet\r\nfeet at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWet? So they are! My dear, off with your shoes this minute, and I'll\r\nhave some dry things ready for you in a jiffy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bhaer,\r\nbustling about so energetically that Nat found himself in the cosy\r\nlittle chair, with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet, before he\r\nwould have had time to say Jack Robinson, if he had wanted to try. He\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d instead; and said it so gratefully that Mrs.\r\nBhaer's eyes grew soft again, and she said something merry, because she\r\nfelt so tender, which was a way she had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are Tommy Bangs' slippers; but he never will remember to put them\r\non in the house; so he shall not have them. They are too big; but that's\r\nall the better; you can't run away from us so fast as if they fitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't want to run away, ma'am.\xe2\x80\x9d And Nat spread his grimy little hands\r\nbefore the comfortable blaze, with a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's good! Now I am going to toast you well, and try to get rid of\r\nthat ugly cough. How long have you had it, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bhaer, as\r\nshe rummaged in her big basket for a strip of flannel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll winter. I got cold, and it wouldn't get better, somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder, living in that damp cellar with hardly a rag to his poor\r\ndear back!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, in a low tone to her husband, who was\r\nlooking at the boy with a skillful pair of eyes that marked the thin\r\ntemples and feverish lips, as well as the hoarse voice and frequent fits\r\nof coughing that shook the bent shoulders under the patched jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobin, my man, trot up to Nursey, and tell her to give thee the\r\ncough-bottle and the liniment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, after his eyes had\r\nexchanged telegrams with his wife's.\r\n\r\nNat looked a little anxious at the preparations, but forgot his fears in\r\na hearty laugh, when Mrs. Bhaer whispered to him, with a droll look:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear my rogue Teddy try to cough. The syrup I'm going to give you has\r\nhoney in it; and he wants some.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLittle Ted was red in the face with his exertions by the time the bottle\r\ncame, and was allowed to suck the spoon after Nat had manfully taken a\r\ndose and had the bit of flannel put about his throat.\r\n\r\nThese first steps toward a cure were hardly completed when a great bell\r\nrang, and a loud tramping through the hall announced supper. Bashful Nat\r\nquaked at the thought of meeting many strange boys, but Mrs. Bhaer held\r\nout her hand to him, and Rob said, patronizingly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't be 'fraid; I'll\r\ntake care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwelve boys, six on a side, stood behind their chairs, prancing with\r\nimpatience to begin, while the tall flute-playing youth was trying to\r\ncurb their ardor. But no one sat down till Mrs. Bhaer was in her place\r\nbehind the teapot, with Teddy on her left, and Nat on her right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is our new boy, Nat Blake. After supper you can say how do you do?\r\nGently, boys, gently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke every one stared at Nat, and then whisked into their seats,\r\ntrying to be orderly and failing utterly. The Bhaers did their best to\r\nhave the lads behave well at meal times, and generally succeeded pretty\r\nwell, for their rules were few and sensible, and the boys, knowing that\r\nthey tried to make things easy and happy, did their best to obey.\r\nBut there are times when hungry boys cannot be repressed without real\r\ncruelty, and Saturday evening, after a half-holiday, was one of those\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little souls, do let them have one day in which they can howl and\r\nracket and frolic to their hearts' content. A holiday isn't a holiday\r\nwithout plenty of freedom and fun; and they shall have full swing once\r\na week,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bhaer used to say, when prim people wondered why\r\nbanister-sliding, pillow-fights, and all manner of jovial games were\r\nallowed under the once decorous roof of Plumfield.\r\n\r\nIt did seem at times as if the aforesaid roof was in danger of flying\r\noff, but it never did, for a word from Father Bhaer could at any time\r\nproduce a lull, and the lads had learned that liberty must not be\r\nabused. So, in spite of many dark predictions, the school flourished,\r\nand manners and morals were insinuated, without the pupils exactly\r\nknowing how it was done.\r\n\r\nNat found himself very well off behind the tall pitchers, with Tommy\r\nBangs just around the corner, and Mrs. Bhaer close by to fill up plate\r\nand mug as fast as he could empty them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that boy next the girl down at the other end?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat to\r\nhis young neighbor under cover of a general laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's Demi Brooke. Mr. Bhaer is his uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a queer name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis real name is John, but they call him Demi-John, because his\r\nfather is John too. That's a joke, don't you see?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, kindly\r\nexplaining. Nat did not see, but politely smiled, and asked, with\r\ninterest:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't he a very nice boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you he is; knows lots and reads like any thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the fat one next him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that's Stuffy Cole. His name is George, but we call him Stuffy\r\n'cause he eats so much. The little fellow next Father Bhaer is his boy\r\nRob, and then there's big Franz his nephew; he teaches some, and kind of\r\nsees to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe plays the flute, doesn't he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat as Tommy rendered himself\r\nspeechless by putting a whole baked apple into his mouth at one blow.\r\n\r\nTommy nodded, and said, sooner than one would have imagined possible\r\nunder the circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, don't he, though? And we dance sometimes,\r\nand do gymnastics to music. I like a drum myself, and mean to learn as\r\nsoon as ever I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like a fiddle best; I can play one too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, getting\r\nconfidential on this attractive subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you?\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy stared over the rim of his mug with round eyes,\r\nfull of interest. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bhaer's got an old fiddle, and he'll let you play\r\non it if you want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I? Oh, I would like it ever so much. You see, I used to go round\r\nfiddling with my father, and another man, till he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn't that fun?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, much impressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was horrid; so cold in winter, and hot in summer. And I got\r\ntired; and they were cross sometimes; and I didn't get enough to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Nat paused to take a generous bite of gingerbread, as if to assure\r\nhimself that the hard times were over; and then he added regretfully:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did love my little fiddle, and I miss it. Nicolo took it away\r\nwhen father died, and wouldn't have me any longer, 'cause I was sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll belong to the band if you play good. See if you don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a band here?\xe2\x80\x9d Nat's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess we do; a jolly band, all boys; and they have concerts and things.\r\nYou just see what happens to-morrow night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter this pleasantly exciting remark, Tommy returned to his supper, and\r\nNat sank into a blissful reverie over his full plate.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer had heard all they said, while apparently absorbed in filling\r\nmugs, and overseeing little Ted, who was so sleepy that he put his spoon\r\nin his eye, nodded like a rosy poppy, and finally fell fast asleep, with\r\nhis cheek pillowed on a soft bun. Mrs. Bhaer had put Nat next to Tommy,\r\nbecause that roly-poly boy had a frank and social way with him, very\r\nattractive to shy persons. Nat felt this, and had made several small\r\nconfidences during supper, which gave Mrs. Bhaer the key to the new\r\nboy's character, better than if she had talked to him herself.\r\n\r\nIn the letter which Mr. Laurence had sent with Nat, he had said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR JO: Here is a case after your own heart. This poor lad is an\r\norphan now, sick and friendless. He has been a street-musician; and\r\nI found him in a cellar, mourning for his dead father, and his lost\r\nviolin. I think there is something in him, and have a fancy that between\r\nus we may give this little man a lift. You cure his overtasked body,\r\nFritz help his neglected mind, and when he is ready I'll see if he is\r\na genius or only a boy with a talent which may earn his bread for him.\r\nGive him a trial, for the sake of your own boy,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTEDDY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we will!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bhaer, as she read the letter; and when\r\nshe saw Nat she felt at once that, whether he was a genius or not, here\r\nwas a lonely, sick boy who needed just what she loved to give, a home\r\nand motherly care. Both she and Mr. Bhaer observed him quietly; and in\r\nspite of ragged clothes, awkward manners, and a dirty face, they saw\r\nmuch about Nat that pleased them. He was a thin, pale boy, of twelve,\r\nwith blue eyes, and a good forehead under the rough, neglected hair; an\r\nanxious, scared face, at times, as if he expected hard words, or blows;\r\nand a sensitive mouth that trembled when a kind glance fell on him;\r\nwhile a gentle speech called up a look of gratitude, very sweet to see.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the poor dear, he shall fiddle all day long if he likes,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bhaer to herself, as she saw the eager, happy expression on his\r\nface when Tommy talked of the band.\r\n\r\nSo, after supper, when the lads flocked into the schoolroom for more\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chigh jinks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jo appeared with a violin in her hand, and after a\r\nword with her husband, went to Nat, who sat in a corner watching the\r\nscene with intense interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lad, give us a little tune. We want a violin in our band, and I\r\nthink you will do it nicely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe expected that he would hesitate; but he seized the old fiddle at\r\nonce, and handled it with such loving care, it was plain to see that\r\nmusic was his passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll do the best I can, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he said; and then drew the bow\r\nacross the strings, as if eager to hear the dear notes again.\r\n\r\nThere was a great clatter in the room, but as if deaf to any sounds but\r\nthose he made, Nat played softly to himself, forgetting every thing in\r\nhis delight. It was only a simple Negro melody, such as street-musicians\r\nplay, but it caught the ears of the boys at once, and silenced them,\r\ntill they stood listening with surprise and pleasure. Gradually they got\r\nnearer and nearer, and Mr. Bhaer came up to watch the boy; for, as if he\r\nwas in his element now, Nat played away and never minded any one, while\r\nhis eyes shone, his cheeks reddened, and his thin fingers flew, as he\r\nhugged the old fiddle and made it speak to all their hearts the language\r\nthat he loved.\r\n\r\nA hearty round of applause rewarded him better than a shower of pennies,\r\nwhen he stopped and glanced about him, as if to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've done my best; please like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you do that first rate,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, who considered Nat his\r\nprotege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be the first fiddle in my band,\xe2\x80\x9d added Franz, with an\r\napproving smile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer whispered to her husband:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTeddy is right: there's something in the child.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Bhaer nodded\r\nhis head emphatically, as he clapped Nat on the shoulder, saying,\r\nheartily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou play well, my son. Come now and play something which we can sing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the proudest, happiest minute of the poor boy's life when he was\r\nled to the place of honor by the piano, and the lads gathered round,\r\nnever heeding his poor clothes, but eying him respectfully and waiting\r\neagerly to hear him play again.\r\n\r\nThey chose a song he knew; and after one or two false starts they got\r\ngoing, and violin, flute, and piano led a chorus of boyish voices that\r\nmade the old roof ring again. It was too much for Nat, more feeble than\r\nhe knew; and as the final shout died away, his face began to work, he\r\ndropped the fiddle, and turning to the wall sobbed like a little child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bhaer, who had been singing with all\r\nher might, and trying to keep little Rob from beating time with his\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are all so kind and it's so beautiful I can't help it,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Nat,\r\ncoughing till he was breathless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me, dear; you must go to bed and rest; you are worn out, and\r\nthis is too noisy a place for you,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Bhaer; and took him\r\naway to her own parlor, where she let him cry himself quiet.\r\n\r\nThen she won him to tell her all his troubles, and listened to the\r\nlittle story with tears in her own eyes, though it was not a new one to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, you have got a father and a mother now, and this is home.\r\nDon't think of those sad times any more, but get well and happy; and be\r\nsure you shall never suffer again, if we can help it. This place is made\r\nfor all sorts of boys to have a good time in, and to learn how to help\r\nthemselves and be useful men, I hope. You shall have as much music as\r\nyou want, only you must get strong first. Now come up to Nursey and have\r\na bath, and then go to bed, and to-morrow we will lay some nice little\r\nplans together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat held her hand fast in his, but had not a word to say, and let his\r\ngrateful eyes speak for him, as Mrs. Bhaer led him up to a big room,\r\nwhere they found a stout German woman with a face so round and cheery\r\nthat it looked like a sort of sun, with the wide frill of her cap for\r\nrays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Nursey Hummel, and she will give you a nice bath, and cut your\r\nhair, and make you all 'comfy,' as Rob says. That's the bath-room in\r\nthere; and on Saturday nights we scrub all the little lads first, and\r\npack them away in bed before the big ones get through singing. Now then,\r\nRob, in with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she talked, Mrs. Bhaer had whipped off Rob's clothes and popped him\r\ninto a long bath-tub in the little room opening into the nursery.\r\n\r\nThere were two tubs, besides foot-baths, basins, douche-pipes, and all\r\nmanner of contrivances for cleanliness. Nat was soon luxuriating in the\r\nother bath; and while simmering there, he watched the performances of\r\nthe two women, who scrubbed, clean night-gowned, and bundled into bed\r\nfour or five small boys, who, of course, cut up all sorts of capers\r\nduring the operation, and kept every one in a gale of merriment till\r\nthey were extinguished in their beds.\r\n\r\nBy the time Nat was washed and done up in a blanket by the fire, while\r\nNursey cut his hair, a new detachment of boys arrived and were shut into\r\nthe bath-room, where they made as much splashing and noise as a school\r\nof young whales at play.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat had better sleep here, so that if his cough troubles him in the\r\nnight you can see that he takes a good draught of flax-seed tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bhaer, who was flying about like a distracted hen with a large\r\nbrood of lively ducklings.\r\n\r\nNursey approved the plan, finished Nat off with a flannel night-gown, a\r\ndrink of something warm and sweet, and then tucked him into one of the\r\nthree little beds standing in the room, where he lay looking like a\r\ncontented mummy and feeling that nothing more in the way of luxury\r\ncould be offered him. Cleanliness in itself was a new and delightful\r\nsensation; flannel gowns were unknown comforts in his world; sips of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood stuff\xe2\x80\x9d soothed his cough as pleasantly as kind words did his\r\nlonely heart; and the feeling that somebody cared for him made that\r\nplain room seem a sort of heaven to the homeless child. It was like a\r\ncosy dream; and he often shut his eyes to see if it would not vanish\r\nwhen he opened them again. It was too pleasant to let him sleep, and he\r\ncould not have done so if he had tried, for in a few minutes one of the\r\npeculiar institutions of Plumfield was revealed to his astonished but\r\nappreciative eyes.\r\n\r\nA momentary lull in the aquatic exercises was followed by the sudden\r\nappearance of pillows flying in all directions, hurled by white goblins,\r\nwho came rioting out of their beds. The battle raged in several rooms,\r\nall down the upper hall, and even surged at intervals into the nursery,\r\nwhen some hard-pressed warrior took refuge there. No one seemed to\r\nmind this explosion in the least; no one forbade it, or even looked\r\nsurprised. Nursey went on hanging up towels, and Mrs. Bhaer laid out\r\nclean clothes, as calmly as if the most perfect order reigned. Nay,\r\nshe even chased one daring boy out of the room, and fired after him the\r\npillow he had slyly thrown at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't they hurt 'em?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, who lay laughing with all his might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no! We always allow one pillow-fight Saturday night. The cases\r\nare changed to-morrow; and it gets up a glow after the boys' baths; so\r\nI rather like it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, busy again among her dozen\r\npairs of socks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a very nice school this is!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nat, in a burst of\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's an odd one,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Mrs. Bhaer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see we don't believe\r\nin making children miserable by too many rules, and too much study. I\r\nforbade night-gown parties at first; but, bless you, it was of no use.\r\nI could no more keep those boys in their beds than so many jacks in the\r\nbox. So I made an agreement with them: I was to allow a fifteen-minute\r\npillow-fight every Saturday night; and they promised to go properly to\r\nbed every other night. I tried it, and it worked well. If they don't\r\nkeep their word, no frolic; if they do, I just turn the glasses round,\r\nput the lamps in safe places, and let them rampage as much as they\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a beautiful plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, feeling that he should like to join\r\nin the fray, but not venturing to propose it the first night. So he lay\r\nenjoying the spectacle, which certainly was a lively one.\r\n\r\nTommy Bangs led the assailing party, and Demi defended his own room with\r\na dogged courage fine to see, collecting pillows behind him as fast as\r\nthey were thrown, till the besiegers were out of ammunition, when they\r\nwould charge upon him in a body, and recover their arms. A few slight\r\naccidents occurred, but nobody minded, and gave and took sounding\r\nthwacks with perfect good humor, while pillows flew like big snowflakes,\r\ntill Mrs. Bhaer looked at her watch, and called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime is up, boys. Into bed, every man jack, or pay the forfeit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the forfeit?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, sitting up in his eagerness to know\r\nwhat happened to those wretches who disobeyed this most peculiar, but\r\npublic-spirited school-ma'am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLose their fun next time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bhaer. \xe2\x80\x9cI give them five\r\nminutes to settle down, then put out the lights, and expect order. They\r\nare honorable lads, and they keep their word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was evident, for the battle ended as abruptly as it began, a parting\r\nshot or two, a final cheer, as Demi fired the seventh pillow at the\r\nretiring foe, a few challenges for next time, then order prevailed. And\r\nnothing but an occasional giggle or a suppressed whisper broke the quiet\r\nwhich followed the Saturday-night frolic, as Mother Bhaer kissed her new\r\nboy and left him to happy dreams of life at Plumfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE BOYS\r\n\r\nWhile Nat takes a good long sleep, I will tell my little readers\r\nsomething about the boys, among whom he found himself when he woke up.\r\n\r\nTo begin with our old friends. Franz was a tall lad, of sixteen now, a\r\nregular German, big, blond, and bookish, also very domestic, amiable,\r\nand musical. His uncle was fitting him for college, and his aunt for a\r\nhappy home of his own hereafter, because she carefully fostered in him\r\ngentle manners, love of children, respect for women, old and young,\r\nand helpful ways about the house. He was her right-hand man on all\r\noccasions, steady, kind, and patient; and he loved his merry aunt like a\r\nmother, for such she had tried to be to him.\r\n\r\nEmil was quite different, being quick-tempered, restless, and\r\nenterprising, bent on going to sea, for the blood of the old vikings\r\nstirred in his veins, and could not be tamed. His uncle promised that he\r\nshould go when he was sixteen, and set him to studying navigation, gave\r\nhim stories of good and famous admirals and heroes to read, and let him\r\nlead the life of a frog in river, pond, and brook, when lessons were\r\ndone. His room looked like the cabin of a man-of-war, for every thing\r\nwas nautical, military, and shipshape. Captain Kyd was his delight, and\r\nhis favorite amusement was to rig up like that piratical gentleman, and\r\nroar out sanguinary sea-songs at the top of his voice. He would dance\r\nnothing but sailors' hornpipes, rolled in his gait, and was as\r\nnautical in conversation to his uncle would permit. The boys called him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommodore,\xe2\x80\x9d and took great pride in his fleet, which whitened the\r\npond and suffered disasters that would have daunted any commander but a\r\nsea-struck boy.\r\n\r\nDemi was one of the children who show plainly the effect of intelligent\r\nlove and care, for soul and body worked harmoniously together. The\r\nnatural refinement which nothing but home influence can teach, gave\r\nhim sweet and simple manners: his mother had cherished an innocent and\r\nloving heart in him; his father had watched over the physical growth of\r\nhis boy, and kept the little body straight and strong on wholesome food\r\nand exercise and sleep, while Grandpa March cultivated the little mind\r\nwith the tender wisdom of a modern Pythagoras, not tasking it with long,\r\nhard lessons, parrot-learned, but helping it to unfold as naturally and\r\nbeautifully as sun and dew help roses bloom. He was not a perfect child,\r\nby any means, but his faults were of the better sort; and being early\r\ntaught the secret of self-control, he was not left at the mercy of\r\nappetites and passions, as some poor little mortals are, and then\r\npunished for yielding to the temptations against which they have\r\nno armor. A quiet, quaint boy was Demi, serious, yet cheery, quite\r\nunconscious that he was unusually bright and beautiful, yet quick to see\r\nand love intelligence or beauty in other children. Very fond of books,\r\nand full of lively fancies, born of a strong imagination and a spiritual\r\nnature, these traits made his parents anxious to balance them with\r\nuseful knowledge and healthful society, lest they should make him one of\r\nthose pale precocious children who amaze and delight a family sometimes,\r\nand fade away like hot-house flowers, because the young soul blooms too\r\nsoon, and has not a hearty body to root it firmly in the wholesome soil\r\nof this world.\r\n\r\nSo Demi was transplanted to Plumfield, and took so kindly to the life\r\nthere, that Meg and John and Grandpa felt satisfied that they had done\r\nwell. Mixing with other boys brought out the practical side of him,\r\nroused his spirit, and brushed away the pretty cobwebs he was so fond of\r\nspinning in that little brain of his. To be sure, he rather shocked\r\nhis mother when he came home, by banging doors, saying \xe2\x80\x9cby George\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n emphatically, and demanding tall thick boots \xe2\x80\x9cthat clumped like papa's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But John rejoiced over him, laughed at his explosive remarks, got the\r\nboots, and said contentedly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is doing well; so let him clump. I want my son to be a manly boy,\r\nand this temporary roughness won't hurt him. We can polish him up by\r\nand by; and as for learning, he will pick that up as pigeons do peas. So\r\ndon't hurry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy was as sunshiny and charming as ever, with all sorts of\r\nwomanlinesses budding in her, for she was like her gentle mother,\r\nand delighted in domestic things. She had a family of dolls, whom she\r\nbrought up in the most exemplary manner; she could not get on without\r\nher little work-basket and bits of sewing, which she did so nicely, that\r\nDemi frequently pulled out his handkerchief to display her neat stitches,\r\nand Baby Josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by Sister Daisy.\r\nShe like to quiddle about the china-closet, prepare the salt-cellars,\r\nput the spoons straight on the table; and every day went round the\r\nparlor with her brush, dusting chairs and tables. Demi called her a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetty,\xe2\x80\x9d but was very glad to have her keep his things in order, lend\r\nhim her nimble fingers in all sorts of work, and help him with his\r\nlessons, for they kept abreast there, and had no thought of rivalry.\r\n\r\nThe love between them was as strong as ever; and no one could laugh\r\nDemi out of his affectionate ways with Daisy. He fought her battles\r\nvaliantly, and never could understand why boys should be ashamed to\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cright out,\xe2\x80\x9d that they loved their sisters. Daisy adored her twin,\r\nthought \xe2\x80\x9cmy brother\xe2\x80\x9d the most remarkable boy in the world, and every\r\nmorning, in her little wrapper, trotted to tap at his door with a\r\nmotherly \xe2\x80\x9cGet up, my dear, it's 'most breakfast time; and here's your\r\nclean collar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRob was an energetic morsel of a boy, who seemed to have discovered the\r\nsecret of perpetual motion, for he never was still. Fortunately, he was\r\nnot mischievous, nor very brave; so he kept out of trouble pretty well,\r\nand vibrated between father and mother like an affectionate little\r\npendulum with a lively tick, for Rob was a chatterbox.\r\n\r\nTeddy was too young to play a very important part in the affairs of\r\nPlumfield, yet he had his little sphere, and filled it beautifully.\r\nEvery one felt the need of a pet at times, and Baby was always ready to\r\naccommodate, for kissing and cuddling suited him excellently. Mrs.\r\nJo seldom stirred without him; so he had his little finger in all the\r\ndomestic pies, and every one found them all the better for it, for they\r\nbelieved in babies at Plumfield.\r\n\r\nDick Brown, and Adolphus or Dolly Pettingill, were two eight year-olds.\r\nDolly stuttered badly, but was gradually getting over it, for no one was\r\nallowed to mock him and Mr. Bhaer tried to cure it, by making him talk\r\nslowly. Dolly was a good little lad, quite uninteresting and ordinary,\r\nbut he flourished here, and went through his daily duties and pleasures\r\nwith placid content and propriety.\r\n\r\nDick Brown's affliction was a crooked back, yet he bore his burden so\r\ncheerfully, that Demi once asked in his queer way, \xe2\x80\x9cDo humps make people\r\ngood-natured? I'd like one if they do.\xe2\x80\x9d Dick was always merry, and did\r\nhis best to be like other boys, for a plucky spirit lived in the\r\nfeeble little body. When he first came, he was very sensitive about his\r\nmisfortune, but soon learned to forget it, for no one dared remind him\r\nof it, after Mr. Bhaer had punished one boy for laughing at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod don't care; for my soul is straight if my back isn't,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Dick\r\nto his tormentor on that occasion; and, by cherishing this idea, the\r\nBhaers soon led him to believe that people also loved his soul, and did\r\nnot mind his body, except to pity and help him to bear it.\r\n\r\nPlaying menagerie once with the others, some one said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat animal will you be, Dick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I'm the dromedary; don't you see the hump on my back?\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nlaughing answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are, my nice little one that don't carry loads, but marches by\r\nthe elephant first in the procession,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who was arranging the\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope others will be as kind to the poor dear as my boys have learned\r\nto be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, quite satisfied with the success of her teaching,\r\nas Dick ambled past her, looking like a very happy, but a very feeble\r\nlittle dromedary, beside stout Stuffy, who did the elephant with\r\nponderous propriety.\r\n\r\nJack Ford was a sharp, rather a sly lad, who was sent to this school,\r\nbecause it was cheap. Many men would have thought him a smart boy, but\r\nMr. Bhaer did not like his way of illustrating that Yankee word, and\r\nthought his unboyish keenness and money-loving as much of an affliction\r\nas Dolly's stutter, or Dick's hump.\r\n\r\nNed Barker was like a thousand other boys of fourteen, all legs,\r\nblunder, and bluster. Indeed the family called him the \xe2\x80\x9cBlunderbuss,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and always expected to see him tumble over the chairs, bump against the\r\ntables, and knock down any small articles near him. He bragged a good\r\ndeal about what he could do, but seldom did any thing to prove it, was\r\nnot brave, and a little given to tale-telling. He was apt to bully the\r\nsmall boys, and flatter the big ones, and without being at all bad, was\r\njust the sort of fellow who could very easily be led astray.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cole had been spoilt by an over-indulgent mother, who stuffed him\r\nwith sweetmeats till he was sick, and then thought him too delicate\r\nto study, so that at twelve years old, he was a pale, puffy boy, dull,\r\nfretful, and lazy. A friend persuaded her to send him to Plumfield, and\r\nthere he soon got waked up, for sweet things were seldom allowed, much\r\nexercise required, and study made so pleasant, that Stuffy was gently\r\nlured along, till he quite amazed his anxious mamma by his improvement,\r\nand convinced her that there was really something remarkable in\r\nPlumfield air.\r\n\r\nBilly Ward was what the Scotch tenderly call an \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent,\xe2\x80\x9d for though\r\nthirteen years old, he was like a child of six. He had been an unusually\r\nintelligent boy, and his father had hurried him on too fast, giving him\r\nall sorts of hard lessons, keeping at his books six hours a day, and\r\nexpecting him to absorb knowledge as a Strasburg goose does the food\r\ncrammed down its throat. He thought he was doing his duty, but he nearly\r\nkilled the boy, for a fever gave the poor child a sad holiday, and when\r\nhe recovered, the overtasked brain gave out, and Billy's mind was like a\r\nslate over which a sponge has passed, leaving it blank.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible lesson to his ambitious father; he could not bear the\r\nsight of his promising child, changed to a feeble idiot, and he sent\r\nhim away to Plumfield, scarcely hoping that he could be helped, but sure\r\nthat he would be kindly treated. Quite docile and harmless was Billy,\r\nand it was pitiful to see how hard he tried to learn, as if groping\r\ndimly after the lost knowledge which had cost him so much.\r\n\r\nDay after day, he pored over the alphabet, proudly said A and B, and\r\nthought that he knew them, but on the morrow they were gone, and all\r\nthe work was to be done over again. Mr. Bhaer had infinite patience with\r\nhim, and kept on in spite of the apparent hopelessness of the task, not\r\ncaring for book lessons, but trying gently to clear away the mists from\r\nthe darkened mind, and give it back intelligence enough to make the boy\r\nless a burden and an affliction.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer strengthened his health by every aid she could invent, and\r\nthe boys all pitied and were kind to him. He did not like their active\r\nplays, but would sit for hours watching the doves, would dig holes for\r\nTeddy till even that ardent grubber was satisfied, or follow Silas, the\r\nman, from place to place seeing him work, for honest Si was very good to\r\nhim, and though he forgot his letters Billy remembered friendly faces.\r\n\r\nTommy Bangs was the scapegrace of the school, and the most trying\r\nscapegrace that ever lived. As full of mischief as a monkey, yet\r\nso good-hearted that one could not help forgiving his tricks; so\r\nscatter-brained that words went by him like the wind, yet so penitent\r\nfor every misdeed, that it was impossible to keep sober when he\r\nvowed tremendous vows of reformation, or proposed all sorts of queer\r\npunishments to be inflicted upon himself. Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer lived in\r\na state of preparation for any mishap, from the breaking of Tommy's own\r\nneck, to the blowing up of the entire family with gunpowder; and Nursey\r\nhad a particular drawer in which she kept bandages, plasters, and salves\r\nfor his especial use, for Tommy was always being brought in half dead;\r\nbut nothing ever killed him, and he arose from every downfall with\r\nredoubled vigor.\r\n\r\nThe first day he came, he chopped the top off one finger in the\r\nhay-cutter, and during the week, fell from the shed roof, was chased by\r\nan angry hen who tried to pick his out because he examined her chickens,\r\ngot run away with, and had his ears boxed violent by Asia, who caught\r\nhim luxuriously skimming a pan of cream with half a stolen pie.\r\nUndaunted, however, by any failures or rebuffs, this indomitable youth\r\nwent on amusing himself with all sorts of tricks till no one felt safe.\r\nIf he did not know his lessons, he always had some droll excuse to\r\noffer, and as he was usually clever at his books, and as bright as a\r\nbutton in composing answers when he did not know them, he go on pretty\r\nwell at school. But out of school, Ye gods and little fishes! how Tommy\r\ndid carouse!\r\n\r\nHe wound fat Asia up in her own clothes line against the post, and left\r\nhere there to fume and scold for half an hour one busy Monday morning.\r\nHe dropped a hot cent down Mary Ann's back as that pretty maid was\r\nwaiting at table one day when there were gentlemen to dinner, whereat\r\nthe poor girl upset the soup and rushed out of the room in dismay,\r\nleaving the family to think that she had gone mad. He fixed a pail of\r\nwater up in a tree, with a bit of ribbon fastened to the handle, and\r\nwhen Daisy, attracted by the gay streamer, tried to pull it down, she\r\ngot a douche bath that spoiled her clean frock and hurt her little\r\nfeelings very much. He put rough white pebbles in the sugar-bowl when\r\nhis grandmother came to tea, and the poor old lady wondered why they\r\ndidn't melt in her cup, but was too polite to say anything. He passed\r\naround snuff in church so that five of the boys sneezed with such\r\nviolence they had to go out. He dug paths in winter time, and then\r\nprivately watered them so that people should tumble down. He drove poor\r\nSilas nearly wild by hanging his big boots in conspicuous places,\r\nfor his feet were enormous, and he was very much ashamed of them. He\r\npersuaded confiding little Dolly to tie a thread to one of his loose\r\nteeth, and leave the string hanging from his mouth when he went to\r\nsleep, so that Tommy could pull it out without his feeling the dreaded\r\noperation. But the tooth wouldn't come at the first tweak, and poor\r\nDolly woke up in great anguish of spirit, and lost all faith in Tommy\r\nfrom that day forth.\r\n\r\nThe last prank had been to give the hens bread soaked in rum, which made\r\nthem tipsy and scandalized all the other fowls, for the respectable old\r\nbiddies went staggering about, pecking and clucking in the most maudlin\r\nmanner, while the family were convulsed with laughter at their antics,\r\ntill Daisy took pity on them and shut them up in the hen-house to sleep\r\noff their intoxication.\r\n\r\nThese were the boys and they lived together as happy as twelve lads\r\ncould, studying and playing, working and squabbling, fighting faults and\r\ncultivating virtues in the good old-fashioned way. Boys at other schools\r\nprobably learned more from books, but less of that better wisdom which\r\nmakes good men. Latin, Greek, and mathematics were all very well, but in\r\nProfessor Bhaer's opinion, self knowledge, self-help, and self-control\r\nwere more important, and he tried to teach them carefully. People shook\r\ntheir heads sometimes at his ideas, even while they owned that the boys\r\nimproved wonderfully in manners and morals. But then, as Mrs. Jo said to\r\nNat, \xe2\x80\x9cit was an odd school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. SUNDAY\r\n\r\nThe moment the bell rang next morning Nat flew out of bed, and dressed\r\nhimself with great satisfaction in the suit of clothes he found on\r\nthe chair. They were not new, being half-worn garments of one of the\r\nwell-to-do boys; but Mrs. Bhaer kept all such cast-off feathers for the\r\npicked robins who strayed into her nest. They were hardly on when Tommy\r\nappeared in a high state of clean collar, and escorted Nat down to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining into the dining-room on the well-spread table, and\r\nthe flock of hungry, hearty lads who gathered round it. Nat observed\r\nthat they were much more orderly than they had been the night before,\r\nand every one stood silently behind his chair while little Rob, standing\r\nbeside his father at the head of the table, folded his hands, reverently\r\nbent his curly head, and softly repeated a short grace in the devout\r\nGerman fashion, which Mr. Bhaer loved and taught his little son to\r\nhonor. Then they all sat down to enjoy the Sunday-morning breakfast of\r\ncoffee, steak, and baked potatoes, instead of the bread and milk fare\r\nwith which they usually satisfied their young appetites. There was much\r\npleasant talk while the knives and forks rattled briskly, for certain\r\nSunday lessons were to be learned, the Sunday walk settled, and plans\r\nfor the week discussed. As he listened, Nat thought it seemed as if this\r\nday must be a very pleasant one, for he loved quiet, and there was\r\na cheerful sort of hush over every thing that pleased him very much;\r\nbecause, in spite of his rough life, the boy possessed the sensitive\r\nnerves which belong to a music-loving nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lads, get your morning jobs done, and let me find you ready\r\nfor church when the 'bus comes round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Bhaer, and set the\r\nexample by going into the school-room to get books ready for the morrow.\r\n\r\nEvery one scattered to his or her task, for each had some little daily\r\nduty, and was expected to perform it faithfully. Some brought wood and\r\nwater, brushed the steps, or ran errands for Mrs. Bhaer. Others fed the\r\npet animals, and did chores about the barn with Franz. Daisy washed the\r\ncups, and Demi wiped them, for the twins liked to work together, and\r\nDemi had been taught to make himself useful in the little house at home.\r\nEven Baby Teddy had his small job to do, and trotted to and fro, putting\r\nnapkins away, and pushing chairs into their places. For half and hour\r\nthe lads buzzed about like a hive of bees, then the 'bus drove round,\r\nFather Bhaer and Franz with the eight older boys piled in, and away they\r\nwent for a three-mile drive to church in town.\r\n\r\nBecause of the troublesome cough Nat prefered to stay at home with\r\nthe four small boys, and spent a happy morning in Mrs. Bhaer's room,\r\nlistening to the stories she read them, learning the hymns she taught\r\nthem, and then quietly employing himself pasting pictures into an old\r\nledger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my Sunday closet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, showing him shelves filled with\r\npicture-books, paint-boxes, architectural blocks, little diaries, and\r\nmaterials for letter-writing. \xe2\x80\x9cI want my boys to love Sunday, to find it\r\na peaceful, pleasant day, when they can rest from common study and\r\nplay, yet enjoy quiet pleasures, and learn, in simple ways, lessons more\r\nimportant than any taught in school. Do you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nwatching Nat's attentive face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to be good?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after hesitating a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; to be good, and to love to be good. It is hard work sometimes, I\r\nknow very well; but we all help one another, and so we get on. This is\r\none of the ways in which I try to help my boys,\xe2\x80\x9d and she took down a\r\nthick book, which seemed half-full of writing, and opened at a page on\r\nwhich there was one word at the top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that's my name!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, looking both surprised and interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I have a page for each boy. I keep a little account of how he gets\r\non through the week, and Sunday night I show him the record. If it is\r\nbad I am sorry and disappointed, if it is good I am glad and proud; but,\r\nwhichever it is, the boys know I want to help them, and they try to do\r\ntheir best for love of me and Father Bhaer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think they would,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, catching a glimpse of Tommy's\r\nname opposite his own, and wondering what was written under it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer saw his eye on the words, and shook her head, saying, as she\r\nturned a leaf,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't show my records to any but the one to whom each belongs. I\r\ncall this my conscience book; and only you and I will ever know what is\r\nto be written on the page below your name. Whether you will be pleased\r\nor ashamed to read it next Sunday depends on yourself. I think it will\r\nbe a good report; at any rate, I shall try to make things easy for you\r\nin this new place, and shall be quite contented if you keep our few\r\nrules, live happily with the boys, and learn something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll try ma'am;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat's thin face flushed up with the earnestness\r\nof his desire to make Mrs. Bhaer \xe2\x80\x9cglad and proud,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9csorry and\r\ndisappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a great deal of trouble to write about so\r\nmany,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as she shut her book with an encouraging pat on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to me, for I really don't know which I like best, writing or boys,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, laughing to see Nat stare with astonishment at the last item.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know many people think boys are a nuisance, but that is because\r\nthey don't understand them. I do; and I never saw the boy yet whom I\r\ncould not get on capitally with after I had once found the soft spot in\r\nhis heart. Bless me, I couldn't get on at all without my flock of dear,\r\nnoisy, naughty, harum-scarum little lads, could I, my Teddy?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs.\r\nBhaer hugged the young rogue, just in time to save the big inkstand from\r\ngoing into his pocket.\r\n\r\nNat, who had never heard anything like this before, really did not know\r\nwhether Mother Bhaer was a trifle crazy, or the most delightful woman he\r\nhad ever met. He rather inclined to the latter opinion, in spite of her\r\npeculiar tastes, for she had a way of filling up a fellow's plate before\r\nhe asked, of laughing at his jokes, gently tweaking him by the ear, or\r\nclapping him on the shoulder, that Nat found very engaging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I think you would like to go into the school-room and practise\r\nsome of the hymns we are to sing to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rightly guessing\r\nthe thing of all others that he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nAlone with the beloved violin and the music-book propped up before him\r\nin the sunny window, while Spring beauty filled the world outside, and\r\nSabbath silence reigned within, Nat enjoyed an hour or two of genuine\r\nhappiness, learning the sweet old tunes, and forgetting the hard past in\r\nthe cheerful present.\r\n\r\nWhen the church-goers came back and dinner was over, every one read,\r\nwrote letters home, said their Sunday lessons, or talked quietly to one\r\nanother, sitting here and there about the house. At three o'clock the\r\nentire family turned out to walk, for all the active young bodies must\r\nhave exercise; and in these walks the active young minds were taught\r\nto see and love the providence of God in the beautiful miracles which\r\nNature was working before their eyes. Mr. Bhaer always went with them,\r\nand in his simple, fatherly way, found for his flock, \xe2\x80\x9cSermons in\r\nstones, books in the running brooks, and good in everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer with Daisy and her own two boys drove into town, to pay the\r\nweekly visit to Grandma, which was busy Mother Bhaer's one holiday and\r\ngreatest pleasure. Nat was not strong enough for the long walk, and\r\nasked to stay at home with Tommy, who kindly offered to do the honors\r\nof Plumfield. \xe2\x80\x9cYou've seen the house, so come out and have a look at\r\nthe garden, and the barn, and the menagerie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, when they were\r\nleft alone with Asia, to see that they didn't get into mischief;\r\nfor, though Tommy was one of the best-meaning boys who ever adorned\r\nknickerbockers, accidents of the most direful nature were always\r\nhappening to him, no one could exactly tell how.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your menagerie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, as they trotted along the drive\r\nthat encircled the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have pets, you see, and we keep 'em in the corn-barn, and call\r\nit the menagerie. Here you are. Isn't my guinea-pig a beauty?\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy\r\nproudly presented one of the ugliest specimens of that pleasing animal\r\nthat Nat ever saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know a boy with a dozen of 'em, and he said he'd give me one, only I\r\nhadn't any place to keep it, so I couldn't have it. It was white, with\r\nblack spots, a regular rouser, and maybe I could get it for you if you'd\r\nlike it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, feeling it would be a delicate return for Tommy's\r\nattentions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like it ever so much, and I'll give you this one, and they can live\r\ntogether if they don't fight. Those white mice are Rob's, Franz gave\r\n'em to him. The rabbits are Ned's, and the bantams outside are Stuffy's.\r\nThat box thing is Demi's turtle-tank, only he hasn't begun to get 'em\r\nyet. Last year he had sixty-two, whackers some of 'em. He stamped one of\r\n'em with his name and the year, and let it go; and he says maybe he will\r\nfind it ever so long after and know it. He read about a turtle being\r\nfound that had a mark on it that showed it must be hundreds of years\r\nold. Demi's such a funny chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is in this box?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, stopping before a large deep one,\r\nhalf-full of earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that's Jack Ford's worm-shop. He digs heaps of 'em and keeps 'em\r\nhere, and when we want any to go afishing with, we buy some of him. It\r\nsaves lots of trouble, only he charged too much for 'em. Why, last time\r\nwe traded I had to pay two cents a dozen, and then got little ones.\r\nJack's mean sometimes, and I told him I'd dig for myself if he didn't\r\nlower his prices. Now, I own two hens, those gray ones with top knots,\r\nfirst-rate ones they are too, and I sell Mrs. Bhaer the eggs, but I\r\nnever ask her more than twenty-five cents a dozen, never! I'd be ashamed\r\nto do it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, with a glance of scorn at the worm-shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho owns the dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, much interested in these commercial\r\ntransactions, and feeling that T. Bangs was a man whom it would be a\r\nprivilege and a pleasure to patronize.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe big dog is Emil's. His name is Christopher Columbus. Mrs. Bhaer\r\nnamed him because she likes to say Christopher Columbus, and no one\r\nminds it if she means the dog,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Tommy, in the tone of a\r\nshow-man displaying his menagerie. \xe2\x80\x9cThe white pup is Rob's, and the\r\nyellow one is Teddy's. A man was going to drown them in our pond, and\r\nPa Bhaer wouldn't let him. They do well enough for the little chaps, I\r\ndon't think much of 'em myself. Their names are Castor and Pollux.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like Toby the donkey best, if I could have anything, it's so nice\r\nto ride, and he's so little and good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, remembering the weary\r\ntramps he had taken on his own tired feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Laurie sent him out to Mrs. Bhaer, so she shouldn't carry Teddy\r\non her back when we go to walk. We're all fond of Toby, and he's a\r\nfirst-rate donkey, sir. Those pigeons belong to the whole lot of us, we\r\neach have our pet one, and go shares in all the little ones as they come\r\nalong. Squabs are great fun; there ain't any now, but you can go up and\r\ntake a look at the old fellows, while I see if Cockletop and Granny have\r\nlaid any eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat climbed up a ladder, put his head through a trap door and took a\r\nlong look at the pretty doves billing and cooing in their spacious loft.\r\nSome on their nests, some bustling in and out, and some sitting at\r\ntheir doors, while many went flying from the sunny housetop to the\r\nstraw-strewn farmyard, where six sleek cows were placidly ruminating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has got something but me. I wish I had a dove, or a hen, or\r\neven a turtle, all my own,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Nat, feeling very poor as he saw the\r\ninteresting treasures of the other boys. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you get these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, when he joined Tommy in the barn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe find 'em or buy 'em, or folks give 'em to us. My father sends me\r\nmine; but as soon as I get egg money enough, I'm going to buy a pair of\r\nducks. There's a nice little pond for 'em behind the barn, and people\r\npay well for duck-eggs, and the little duckies are pretty, and it's fun\r\nto see 'em swim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, with the air of a millionaire.\r\n\r\nNat sighed, for he had neither father nor money, nothing in the wide\r\nworld but an old empty pocketbook, and the skill that lay in his ten\r\nfinger tips. Tommy seemed to understand the question and the sigh which\r\nfollowed his answer, for after a moment of deep thought, he suddenly\r\nbroke out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, I'll tell you what I'll do. If you will hunt eggs for me, I\r\nhate it, I'll give you one egg out of every dozen. You keep account, and\r\nwhen you've had twelve, Mother Bhaer will give you twenty-five cents for\r\n'em, and then you can buy what you like, don't you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll do it! What a kind feller you are, Tommy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, quite\r\ndazzled by this brilliant offer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! that is not anything. You begin now and rummage the barn, and\r\nI'll wait here for you. Granny is cackling, so you're sure to find one\r\nsomewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy threw himself down on the hay with a luxurious\r\nsense of having made a good bargain, and done a friendly thing.\r\n\r\nNat joyfully began his search, and went rustling from loft to loft till\r\nhe found two fine eggs, one hidden under a beam, and the other in an old\r\npeck measure, which Mrs. Cockletop had appropriated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have one and I'll have the other, that will just make up my\r\nlast dozen, and to-morrow we'll start fresh. Here, you chalk your\r\naccounts up near mine, and then we'll be all straight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy,\r\nshowing a row of mysterious figures on the side of an old winnowing\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nWith a delightful sense of importance, the proud possessor of one egg\r\nopened his account with his friend, who laughingly wrote above the\r\nfigures these imposing words,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cT. Bangs & Co.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Nat found them so fascinating that he was with difficulty persuaded\r\nto go and deposit his first piece of portable property in Asia's\r\nstore-room. Then they went on again, and having made the acquaintance\r\nof the two horses, six cows, three pigs, and one Alderney \xe2\x80\x9cBossy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as calves are called in New England, Tommy took Nat to a certain old\r\nwillow-tree that overhung a noisy little brook. From the fence it was\r\nan easy scramble into a wide niche between the three big branches, which\r\nhad been cut off to send out from year to year a crowd of slender twigs,\r\ntill a green canopy rustled overhead. Here little seats had been fixed,\r\nand a hollow place a closet made big enough to hold a book or two, a\r\ndismantled boat, and several half-finished whistles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Demi's and my private place; we made it, and nobody can come up\r\nunless we let 'em, except Daisy, we don't mind her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, as Nat\r\nlooked with delight from the babbling brown water below to the green\r\narch above, where bees were making a musical murmur as they feasted on\r\nthe long yellow blossoms that filled the air with sweetness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it's just beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat. \xe2\x80\x9cI do hope you'll let me up\r\nsometimes. I never saw such a nice place in all my life. I'd like to be\r\na bird, and live here always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is pretty nice. You can come if Demi don't mind, and I guess he\r\nwon't, because he said last night that he liked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat smiled with pleasure, for Demi's regard seemed to be\r\nvalued by all the boys, partly because he was Father Bhaer's nephew, and\r\npartly because he was such a sober, conscientious little fellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Demi likes quiet chaps, and I guess he and you will get on if you\r\ncare about reading as he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Nat's flush of pleasure deepened to a painful scarlet at those last\r\nwords, and he stammered out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't read very well; I never had any time; I was always fiddling\r\nround, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't love it myself, but I can do it well enough when I want to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tommy, after a surprised look, which said as plainly as words, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nboy twelve years old and can't read!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can read music, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nat, rather ruffled at having to\r\nconfess his ignorance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't;\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy spoke in a respectful tone, which emboldened Nat to\r\nsay firmly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to study real hard and learn every thing I can, for I never had\r\na chance before. Does Mr. Bhaer give hard lessons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he isn't a bit cross; he sort of explains and gives you a boost\r\nover the hard places. Some folks don't; my other master didn't. If we\r\nmissed a word, didn't we get raps on the head!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy rubbed his own\r\npate as if it tingled yet with the liberal supply of raps, the memory\r\nof which was the only thing he brought away after a year with his \xe2\x80\x9cother\r\nmaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could read this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, who had been examining the books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead a bit, then; I'll help you,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Tommy, with a patronizing\r\nair.\r\n\r\nSo Nat did his best, and floundered through a page with may friendly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cboosts\xe2\x80\x9d from Tommy, who told him he would soon \xe2\x80\x9cgo it\xe2\x80\x9d as well as\r\nanybody. Then they sat and talked boy-fashion about all sorts of things,\r\namong others, gardening; for Nat, looking down from his perch, asked\r\nwhat was planted in the many little patches lying below them on the\r\nother side of the brook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are our farms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe each have our own patch, and\r\nraise what we like in it, only have to choose different things, and\r\ncan't change till the crop is in, and we must keep it in order all\r\nsummer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to raise this year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, I cattleated to hev beans, as they are about the easiest crop\r\na-goin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat could not help laughing, for Tommy had pushed back his hat, put his\r\nhands in his pockets, and drawled out his words in unconscious imitation\r\nof Silas, the man who managed the place for Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, you needn't laugh; beans are ever so much easier than corn or\r\npotatoes. I tried melons last year, but the bugs were a bother, and the\r\nold things wouldn't get ripe before the frost, so I didn't have but one\r\ngood water and two little 'mush mellions,'\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, relapsing into a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilasism\xe2\x80\x9d with the last word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorn looks pretty growing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, politely, to atone for his laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you have to hoe it over and over again. Now, six weeks' beans\r\nonly have to be done once or so, and they get ripe soon. I'm going to\r\ntry 'em, for I spoke first. Stuffy wanted 'em, but he's got to take\r\npeas; they only have to be picked, and he ought to do it, he eats such a\r\nlot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if I shall have a garden?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, thinking that even\r\ncorn-hoeing must be pleasant work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from below, and there was Mr. Bhaer\r\nreturned from his walk, and come to find them, for he managed to have\r\na little talk with every one of the lads some time during the day, and\r\nfound that these chats gave them a good start for the coming week.\r\n\r\nSympathy is a sweet thing, and it worked wonders here, for each boy knew\r\nthat Father Bhaer was interested in him, and some were readier to open\r\ntheir hearts to him than to a woman, especially the older ones, who\r\nliked to talk over their hopes and plans, man to man. When sick or in\r\ntrouble they instinctively turned to Mrs. Jo, while the little ones made\r\nher their mother-confessor on all occasions.\r\n\r\nIn descending from their nest, Tommy fell into the brook; being used to\r\nit, he calmly picked himself out and retired to the house to be dried.\r\nThis left Nat to Mr. Bhaer, which was just what he wished, and, during\r\nthe stroll they took among the garden plots, he won the lad's heart by\r\ngiving him a little \xe2\x80\x9cfarm,\xe2\x80\x9d and discussing crops with him as gravely as\r\nif the food for the family depended on the harvest. From this pleasant\r\ntopic they went to others, and Nat had many new and helpful thoughts put\r\ninto a mind that received them as gratefully as the thirsty earth had\r\nreceived the warm spring rain. All supper time he brooded over them,\r\noften fixing his eyes on Mr. Bhaer with an inquiring look, that seemed\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cI like that, do it again, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d I don't know whether the man\r\nunderstood the child's mute language or not, but when the boys were all\r\ngathered together in Mrs. Bhaer's parlor for the Sunday evening talk,\r\nhe chose a subject which might have been suggested by the walk in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nAs he looked about him Nat thought it seemed more like a great family\r\nthan a school, for the lads were sitting in a wide half-circle round the\r\nfire, some on chairs, some on the rug, Daisy and Demi on the knees of\r\nUncle Fritz, and Rob snugly stowed away in the back of his mother's\r\neasy-chair, where he could nod unseen if the talk got beyond his depth.\r\n\r\nEvery one looked quite comfortable, and listened attentively, for the\r\nlong walk made rest agreeable, and as every boy there knew that he would\r\nbe called upon for his views, he kept his wits awake to be ready with an\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce upon a time,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Bhaer, in the dear old-fashioned way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere was a great and wise gardener who had the largest garden ever\r\nseen. A wonderful and lovely place it was, and he watched over it with\r\nthe greatest skill and care, and raised all manner of excellent and\r\nuseful things. But weeds would grow even in this fine garden; often the\r\nground was bad and the good seeds sown in it would not spring up. He\r\nhad many under gardeners to help him. Some did their duty and earned the\r\nrich wages he gave them; but others neglected their parts and let them\r\nrun to waste, which displeased him very much. But he was very patient,\r\nand for thousands and thousands of years he worked and waited for his\r\ngreat harvest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have been pretty old,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who was looking straight into\r\nUncle Fritz's face, as if to catch every word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Demi, it's a fairy story,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think it's an arrygory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a arrygory?\xe2\x80\x9d called out Tommy, who was of an inquiring turn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him, Demi, if you can, and don't use words unless you are quite\r\nsure you know what they mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do know, Grandpa told me! A fable is a arrygory; it's a story that\r\nmeans something. My 'Story without an end' is one, because the child in\r\nit means a soul; don't it, Aunty?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, eager to prove himself\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's it, dear; and Uncle's story is an allegory, I am quite sure; so\r\nlisten and see what it means,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Jo, who always took part in\r\nwhatever was going on, and enjoyed it as much as any boy among them.\r\n\r\nDemi composed himself, and Mr. Bhaer went on in his best English, for he\r\nhad improved much in the last five years, and said the boys did it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis great gardener gave a dozen or so of little plots to one of his\r\nservants, and told him to do his best and see what he could raise. Now\r\nthis servant was not rich, nor wise, nor very good, but he wanted to\r\nhelp because the gardener had been very kind to him in many ways. So he\r\ngladly took the little plots and fell to work. They were all sorts of\r\nshapes and sizes, and some were very good soil, some rather stony, and\r\nall of them needed much care, for in the rich soil the weeds grew fast,\r\nand in the poor soil there were many stones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was growing in them besides the weeds, and stones?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat; so\r\ninterested, he forgot his shyness and spoke before them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, with a kind look. \xe2\x80\x9cEven the roughest, most\r\nneglected little bed had a bit of heart's-ease or a sprig of mignonette\r\nin it. One had roses, sweet peas, and daisies in it,\xe2\x80\x9d here he pinched\r\nthe plump cheek of the little girl leaning on his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother had all\r\nsorts of curious plants in it, bright pebbles, a vine that went climbing\r\nup like Jack's beanstalk, and many good seeds just beginning to sprout;\r\nfor, you see, this bed had been taken fine care of by a wise old man,\r\nwho had worked in gardens of this sort all his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this part of the \xe2\x80\x9carrygory,\xe2\x80\x9d Demi put his head on one side like an\r\ninquisitive bird, and fixed his bright eye on his uncle's face, as if he\r\nsuspected something and was on the watch. But Mr. Bhaer looked perfectly\r\ninnocent, and went on glancing from one young face to another, with a\r\ngrave, wistful look, that said much to his wife, who knew how earnestly\r\nhe desired to do his duty in these little garden plots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I tell you, some of these beds were easy to cultivate, that means\r\nto take care of Daisy, and others were very hard. There was one\r\nparticularly sunshiny little bed that might have been full of fruits and\r\nvegetables as well as flowers, only it wouldn't take any pains, and when\r\nthe man sowed, well, we'll say melons in this bed, they came to nothing,\r\nbecause the little bed neglected them. The man was sorry, and kept on\r\ntrying, though every time the crop failed, all the bed said, was, 'I\r\nforgot.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a general laugh broke out, and every one looked at Tommy, who had\r\npricked up his ears at the word \xe2\x80\x9cmelons,\xe2\x80\x9d and hung down his head at the\r\nsound of his favorite excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew he meant us!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, clapping his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the man,\r\nand we are the little gardens; aren't we, Uncle Fritz?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have guessed it. Now each of you tell me what crop I shall try to\r\nsow in you this spring, so that next autumn I may get a good harvest out\r\nof my twelve, no, thirteen, plots,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, nodding at Nat as he\r\ncorrected himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't sow corn and beans and peas in us. Unless you mean we are to\r\neat a great many and get fat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy, with a sudden brightening of\r\nhis round, dull face as the pleasing idea occurred to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe don't mean that kind of seeds. He means things to make us good; and\r\nthe weeds are faults,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, who usually took the lead in these\r\ntalks, because he was used to this sort of thing, and liked it very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, each of you think what you need most, and tell me, and I will help\r\nyou to grow it; only you must do your best, or you will turn out like\r\nTommy's melons, all leaves and no fruit. I will begin with the oldest,\r\nand ask the mother what she will have in her plot, for we are all parts\r\nof the beautiful garden, and may have rich harvests for our Master if we\r\nlove Him enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Father Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall devote the whole of my plot to the largest crop of patience I\r\ncan get, for that is what I need most,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, so soberly that\r\nthe lads fell to thinking in good earnest what they should say when\r\ntheir turns came, and some among them felt a twinge of remorse, that\r\nthey had helped to use up Mother Bhaer's stock of patience so fast.\r\n\r\nFranz wanted perseverance, Tommy steadiness, Ned went in for good\r\ntemper, Daisy for industry, Demi for \xe2\x80\x9cas much wiseness as Grandpa,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nNat timidly said he wanted so many things he would let Mr. Bhaer choose\r\nfor him. The others chose much the same things, and patience, good\r\ntemper, and generosity seemed the favorite crops. One boy wished to like\r\nto get up early, but did not know what name to give that sort of seed;\r\nand poor Stuffy sighed out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I loved my lessons as much as I do my dinner, but I can't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will plant self-denial, and hoe it and water it, and make it grow so\r\nwell that next Christmas no one will get ill by eating too much dinner.\r\nIf you exercise your mind, George, it will get hungry just as your body\r\ndoes, and you will love books almost as much as my philosopher here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Bhaer; adding, as he stroked the hair off Demi's fine forehead,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are greedy also, my son, and you like to stuff your little mind\r\nfull of fairy tales and fancies, as well as George likes to fill his\r\nlittle stomach with cake and candy. Both are bad, and I want you to\r\ntry something better. Arithmetic is not half so pleasant as 'Arabian\r\nNights,' I know, but it is a very useful thing, and now is the time to\r\nlearn it, else you will be ashamed and sorry by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, 'Harry and Lucy,' and 'Frank,' are not fairy books, and they\r\nare all full of barometers, and bricks, and shoeing horses, and useful\r\nthings, and I'm fond of them; ain't I, Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, anxious to\r\ndefend himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they are; but I find you reading 'Roland and Maybird,' a great deal\r\noftener than 'Harry and Lucy,' and I think you are not half so fond of\r\n'Frank' as you are of 'Sinbad.' Come, I shall make a little bargain with\r\nyou both, George shall eat but three times a day, and you shall read but\r\none story-book a week, and I will give you the new cricket-ground; only,\r\nyou must promise to play in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Fritz, in his persuasive\r\nway, for Stuffy hated to run about, and Demi was always reading in play\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we don't like cricket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not now, but you will when you know it. Besides, you do like to\r\nbe generous, and the other boys want to play, and you can give them the\r\nnew ground if you choose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was taken them both on the right side, and they agreed to the\r\nbargain, to the great satisfaction of the rest.\r\n\r\nThere was a little more talk about the gardens, and then they all sang\r\ntogether. The band delighted Nat, for Mrs. Bhaer played the piano, Franz\r\nthe flute, Mr. Bhaer a bass viol, and he himself the violin. A very\r\nsimple little concert, but all seemed to enjoy it, and old Asia, sitting\r\nin the corner, joined at times with the sweetest voice of any, for in\r\nthis family, master and servant, old and young, black and white, shared\r\nin the Sunday song, which went up to the Father of them all. After this\r\nthey each shook hands with Father Bhaer; Mother Bhaer kissed them every\r\none from sixteen-year-old Franz to little Rob, how kept the tip of her\r\nnose for his own particular kisses, and then they trooped up to bed.\r\n\r\nThe light of the shaded lamp that burned in the nursery shone softly on\r\na picture hanging at the foot of Nat's bed. There were several others\r\non the walls, but the boy thought there must be something peculiar about\r\nthis one, for it had a graceful frame of moss and cones about it, and\r\non a little bracket underneath stood a vase of wild flowers freshly\r\ngathered from the spring woods. It was the most beautiful picture of\r\nthem all, and Nat lay looking at it, dimly feeling what it meant, and\r\nwishing he knew all about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's my picture,\xe2\x80\x9d said a little voice in the room. Nat popped up his\r\nhead, and there was Demi in his night-gown pausing on his way back from\r\nAunt Jo's chamber, whither he had gone to get a cot for a cut finger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing to the children?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Christ, the Good Man, and He is blessing the children. Don't\r\nyou know about Him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much, but I'd like to, He looks so kind,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat, whose chief\r\nknowledge of the Good Man consisted in hearing His name taken in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about it, and I like it very much, because it is true,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Grandpa, he knows every thing, and tells the best stories in\r\nthe world. I used to play with his big books, and make bridges, and\r\nrailroads, and houses, when I was a little boy,\xe2\x80\x9d began Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, respectfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Most ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a lot of things, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you see my head is pretty big, and Grandpa says it will take a\r\ngood deal to fill it, so I keep putting pieces of wisdom into it as fast\r\nas I can,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Demi, in his quaint way.\r\n\r\nNat laughed, and then said soberly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell on, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Demi gladly told on without pause or punctuation. \xe2\x80\x9cI found a very\r\npretty book one day and wanted to play with it, but Grandpa said I\r\nmustn't, and showed me the pictures, and told me about them, and I liked\r\nthe stories very much, all about Joseph and his bad brothers, and the\r\nfrogs that came up out of the sea, and dear little Moses in the water,\r\nand ever so many more lovely ones, but I liked about the Good Man best\r\nof all, and Grandpa told it to me so many times that I learned it by\r\nheart, and he gave me this picture so I shouldn't forget, and it was\r\nput up here once when I was sick, and I left it for other sick boys to\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes Him bless the children?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, who found something very\r\nattractive in the chief figure of the group.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause He loved them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they poor children?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, wistfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so; you see some haven't got hardly any clothes on, and\r\nthe mothers don't look like rich ladies. He liked poor people, and was\r\nvery good to them. He made them well, and helped them, and told rich\r\npeople they must not be cross to them, and they loved Him dearly,\r\ndearly,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas He rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no! He was born in a barn, and was so poor He hadn't any house to\r\nlive in when He grew up, and nothing to eat sometimes, but what people\r\ngave Him, and He went round preaching to everybody, and trying to make\r\nthem good, till the bad men killed Him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat sat up in his bed to look and listen, so interested\r\nwas he in this man who cared for the poor so much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you all about it; Aunt Jo won't mind;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi settled\r\nhimself on the opposite bed, glad to tell his favorite story to so good\r\na listener.\r\n\r\nNursey peeped in to see if Nat was asleep, but when she saw what was\r\ngoing on, she slipped away again, and went to Mrs. Bhaer, saying with\r\nher kind face full of motherly emotion,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill the dear lady come and see a pretty sight? It's Nat listening\r\nwith all his heart to Demi telling the story of the Christ-child, like a\r\nlittle white angel as he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer had meant to go and talk with Nat a moment before he slept,\r\nfor she had found that a serious word spoken at this time often did\r\nmuch good. But when she stole to the nursery door, and saw Nat eagerly\r\ndrinking in the words of his little friends, while Demi told the sweet\r\nand solemn story as it had been taught him, speaking softly as he sat\r\nwith his beautiful eyes fixed on the tender face above them, her own\r\nfilled with tears, and she went silently away, thinking to herself,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi is unconsciously helping the poor boy better than I can; I will\r\nnot spoil it by a single word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe murmur of the childish voice went on for a long time, as one\r\ninnocent heart preached that great sermon to another, and no one hushed\r\nit. When it ceased at last, and Mrs. Bhaer went to take away the lamp,\r\nDemi was gone and Nat fast asleep, lying with his face toward the\r\npicture, as if he had already learned to love the Good Man who loved\r\nlittle children, and was a faithful friend to the poor. The boy's face\r\nwas very placid, and as she looked at it she felt that if a single day\r\nof care and kindness had done so much, a year of patient cultivation\r\nwould surely bring a grateful harvest from this neglected garden, which\r\nwas already sown with the best of all seed by the little missionary in\r\nthe night-gown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. STEPPING-STONES\r\n\r\nWhen Nat went into school on Monday morning, he quaked inwardly, for now\r\nhe thought he should have to display his ignorance before them all. But\r\nMr. Bhaer gave him a seat in the deep window, where he could turn his\r\nback on the others, and Franz heard him say his lessons there, so no one\r\ncould hear his blunders or see how he blotted his copybook. He was truly\r\ngrateful for this, and toiled away so diligently that Mr. Bhaer said,\r\nsmiling, when he saw his hot face and inky fingers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't work so hard, my boy; you will tire yourself out, and there is\r\ntime enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must work hard, or I can't catch up with the others. They know\r\nheaps, and I don't know anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, who had been reduced to a\r\nstate of despair by hearing the boys recite their grammar, history, and\r\ngeography with what he thought amazing ease and accuracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know a good many things which they don't,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, sitting\r\ndown beside him, while Franz led a class of small students through the\r\nintricacies of the multiplication table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat looked utterly incredulous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; for one thing, you can keep your temper, and Jack, who is quick\r\nat numbers, cannot; that is an excellent lesson, and I think you have\r\nlearned it well. Then, you can play the violin, and not one of the lads\r\ncan, though they want to do it very much. But, best of all, Nat, you\r\nreally care to learn something, and that is half the battle. It seems\r\nhard at first, and you will feel discouraged, but plod away, and things\r\nwill get easier and easier as you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat's face had brightened more and more as he listened, for, small as\r\nthe list of his learning was, it cheered him immensely to feel that\r\nhe had anything to fall back upon. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can keep my temper father's\r\nbeating taught me that; and I can fiddle, though I don't know where the\r\nBay of Biscay is,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, with a sense of comfort impossible to\r\nexpress. Then he said aloud, and so earnestly that Demi heard him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do want to learn, and I will try. I never went to school, but I\r\ncouldn't help it; and if the fellows don't laugh at me, I guess I'll get\r\non first rate you and the lady are so good to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shan't laugh at you; if they do, I'll I'll tell them not to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Demi, quite forgetting where he was.\r\n\r\nThe class stopped in the middle of 7 times 9, and everyone looked up to\r\nsee what was going on.\r\n\r\nThinking that a lesson in learning to help one another was better than\r\narithmetic just then, Mr. Bhaer told them about Nat, making such an\r\ninteresting and touching little story out of it that the good-hearted\r\nlads all promised to lend him a hand, and felt quite honored to be\r\ncalled upon to impart their stores of wisdom to the chap who fiddled so\r\ncapitally. This appeal established the right feeling among them, and Nat\r\nhad few hindrances to struggle against, for every one was glad to give\r\nhim a \xe2\x80\x9cboost\xe2\x80\x9d up the ladder of learning.\r\n\r\nTill he was stronger, much study was not good for him, however, and Mrs.\r\nJo found various amusements in the house for him while others were at\r\ntheir books. But his garden was his best medicine, and he worked away\r\nlike a beaver, preparing his little farm, sowing his beans, watching\r\neagerly to see them grow, and rejoicing over each green leaf and slender\r\nstock that shot up and flourished in the warm spring weather. Never\r\nwas a garden more faithfully hoed; Mr. Bhaer really feared that nothing\r\nwould find time to grow, Nat kept up such a stirring of the soil; so he\r\ngave him easy jobs in the flower garden or among the strawberries, where\r\nhe worked and hummed as busily as the bees booming all about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the crop I like best,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bhaer used to say, as she pinched\r\nthe once thin cheeks, now getting plump and ruddy, or stroked the bent\r\nshoulders that were slowly straightening up with healthful work, good\r\nfood, and the absence of that heavy burden, poverty.\r\n\r\nDemi was his little friend, Tommy his patron, and Daisy the comforter of\r\nall his woes; for, though the children were younger than he, his timid\r\nspirit found a pleasure in their innocent society, and rather shrunk\r\nfrom the rough sports of the elder lads. Mr. Laurence did not forget\r\nhim, but sent clothes and books, music and kind messages, and now and\r\nthen came out to see how his boy was getting on, or took him into town\r\nto a concert; on which occasions Nat felt himself translated into the\r\nseventh heaven of bliss, for he went to Mr. Laurence's great house, saw\r\nhis pretty wife and little fairy of a daughter, had a good dinner, and\r\nwas made so comfortable, that he talked and dreamed of it for days and\r\nnights afterward.\r\n\r\nIt takes so little to make a child happy that it is a pity, in a world\r\nso full of sunshine and pleasant things, that there should be any\r\nwistful faces, empty hands, or lonely little hearts. Feeling this, the\r\nBhaers gathered up all the crumbs they could find to feed their flock of\r\nhungry sparrows, for they were not rich, except in charity. Many of\r\nMrs. Jo's friends who had nurseries sent her they toys of which their\r\nchildren so soon tired, and in mending these Nat found an employment\r\nthat just suited him. He was very neat and skillful with those slender\r\nfingers of his, and passed many a rainy afternoon with his gum-bottle,\r\npaint-box, and knife, repairing furniture, animals, and games, while\r\nDaisy was dressmaker to the dilapidated dolls. As fast as the toys were\r\nmended, they were put carefully away in a certain drawer which was\r\nto furnish forth a Christmas-tree for all the poor children of the\r\nneighborhood, that being the way the Plumfield boys celebrated the\r\nbirthday of Him who loved the poor and blessed the little ones.\r\n\r\nDemi was never tired of reading and explaining his favorite books, and\r\nmany a pleasant hour did they spend in the old willow, revelling over\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobinson Crusoe,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cArabian Nights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEdgeworth's Tales,\xe2\x80\x9d and the other\r\ndear immortal stories that will delight children for centuries to come.\r\nThis opened a new world to Nat, and his eagerness to see what came next\r\nin the story helped him on till he could read as well as anybody, and\r\nfelt so rich and proud with his new accomplishment, that there was\r\ndanger of his being as much of a bookworm as Demi.\r\n\r\nAnother helpful thing happened in a most unexpected and agreeable\r\nmanner. Several of the boys were \xe2\x80\x9cin business,\xe2\x80\x9d as they called it, for\r\nmost of them were poor, and knowing that they would have their own way\r\nto make by and by, the Bhaers encouraged any efforts at independence.\r\nTommy sold his eggs; Jack speculated in live stock; Franz helped in\r\nthe teaching, and was paid for it; Ned had a taste for carpentry, and a\r\nturning-lathe was set up for him in which he turned all sorts of useful\r\nor pretty things, and sold them; while Demi constructed water-mills,\r\nwhirligigs, and unknown machines of an intricate and useless nature, and\r\ndisposed of them to the boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him be a mechanic if he likes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer. \xe2\x80\x9cGive a boy a\r\ntrade, and he is independent. Work is wholesome, and whatever talent\r\nthese lads possess, be it for poetry or ploughing, it shall be\r\ncultivated and made useful to them if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, when Nat came running to him one day to ask with an excited face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I go and fiddle for some people who are to have a picnic in our\r\nwoods? They will pay me, and I'd like to earn some money as the other\r\nboys do, and fiddling is the only way I know how to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer answered readily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, and welcome. It is an easy and a pleasant way to work, and I am\r\nglad it is offered you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat went, and did so well that when he came home he had two dollars in\r\nhis pocket, which he displayed with intense satisfaction, as he told how\r\nmuch he had enjoyed the afternoon, how kind the young people were, and\r\nhow they had praised his dance music, and promised to have him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so much nicer than fiddling in the street, for then I got none\r\nof the money, and now I have it all, and a good time besides. I'm in\r\nbusiness now as well as Tommy and Jack, and I like it ever so much,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Nat, proudly patting the old pocketbook, and feeling like a\r\nmillionaire already.\r\n\r\nHe was in business truly, for picnics were plenty as summer opened,\r\nand Nat's skill was in great demand. He was always at liberty to go if\r\nlessons were not neglected, and if the picnickers were respectable young\r\npeople. For Mr. Bhaer explained to him that a good plain education is\r\nnecessary for everyone, and that no amount of money should hire him to\r\ngo where he might be tempted to do wrong. Nat quite agreed to this, and\r\nit was a pleasant sight to see the innocent-hearted lad go driving away\r\nin the gay wagons that stopped at the gate for him, or to hear him come\r\nfiddling home tired but happy, with his well-earned money in one pocket,\r\nand some \xe2\x80\x9cgoodies\xe2\x80\x9d from the feast for Daisy or little Ted, whom he never\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to save up till I get enough to buy a violin for myself, and\r\nthen I can earn my own living, can't I?\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, as he brought\r\nhis dollars to Mr. Bhaer to keep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, Nat; but we must get you strong and hearty first, and put a\r\nlittle more knowledge into this musical head of yours. Then Mr. Laurie\r\nwill find you a place somewhere, and in a few years we will all come to\r\nhear you play in public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith much congenial work, encouragement, and hope, Nat found life\r\ngetting easier and happier every day, and made such progress in his\r\nmusic lessons that his teacher forgave his slowness in some other\r\nthings, knowing very well that where the heart is the mind works best.\r\nThe only punishment the boy ever needed for neglect of more important\r\nlessons was to hang up the fiddle and the bow for a day. The fear of\r\nlosing his bosom friend entirely made him go at his books with a will;\r\nand having proved that he could master the lessons, what was the use of\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cI can't?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy had a great love of music, and a great reverence for any one who\r\ncould make it, and she was often found sitting on the stairs outside\r\nNat's door while he was practising. This pleased him very much, and he\r\nplayed his best for that one quiet little listener; for she never would\r\ncome in, but preferred to sit sewing her gay patchwork, or tending one\r\nof her many dolls, with an expression of dreamy pleasure on her face\r\nthat made Aunt Jo say, with tears in her eyes: \xe2\x80\x9cSo like my Beth,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ngo softly by, lest even her familiar presence mar the child's sweet\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nNat was very fond of Mrs. Bhaer, but found something even more\r\nattractive in the good professor, who took fatherly care of the shy\r\nfeeble boy, who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea on\r\nwhich his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years. Some\r\ngood angel must have been watching over him, for, though his body had\r\nsuffered, his soul seemed to have taken little harm, and came ashore as\r\ninnocent as a shipwrecked baby. Perhaps his love of music kept it sweet\r\nin spite of the discord all about him; Mr. Laurie said so, and he ought\r\nto know. However that might be, Father Bhaer took pleasure in fostering\r\npoor Nat's virtues, and in curing his faults, finding his new pupil as\r\ndocile and affectionate as a girl. He often called Nat his \xe2\x80\x9cdaughter\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n when speaking of him to Mrs. Jo, and she used to laugh at his fancy, for\r\nMadame liked manly boys, and thought Nat amiable but weak, though you\r\nnever would have guessed it, for she petted him as she did Daisy, and he\r\nthought her a very delightful woman.\r\n\r\nOne fault of Nat's gave the Bhaers much anxiety, although they saw how\r\nit had been strengthened by fear and ignorance. I regret to say that\r\nNat sometimes told lies. Not very black ones, seldom getting deeper than\r\ngray, and often the mildest of white fibs; but that did not matter, a\r\nlie is a lie, and though we all tell many polite untruths in this queer\r\nworld of ours, it is not right, and everybody knows it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot be too careful; watch your tongue, and eyes, and hands, for\r\nit is easy to tell, and look, and act untruth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, in one\r\nof the talks he had with Nat about his chief temptation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, and I don't mean to, but it's so much easier to get along\r\nif you ain't very fussy about being exactly true. I used to tell 'em\r\nbecause I was afraid of father and Nicolo, and now I do sometimes\r\nbecause the boys laugh at me. I know it's bad, but I forget,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\r\nlooked much depressed by his sins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a little lad I used to tell lies! Ach! what fibs they were,\r\nand my old grandmother cured me of it how, do you think? My parents had\r\ntalked, and cried, and punished, but still did I forget as you. Then\r\nsaid the dear old grandmother, 'I shall help you to remember, and put a\r\ncheck on this unruly part,' with that she drew out my tongue and snipped\r\nthe end with her scissors till the blood ran. That was terrible, you\r\nmay believe, but it did me much good, because it was sore for days, and\r\nevery word I said came so slowly that I had time to think. After that I\r\nwas more careful, and got on better, for I feared the big scissors. Yet\r\nthe dear grandmother was most kind to me in all things, and when she lay\r\ndying far away in Nuremberg, she prayed that little Fritz might love God\r\nand tell the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never had any grandmothers, but if you think it will cure me, I'll\r\nlet you snip my tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, heroically, for he dreaded pain, yet\r\ndid wish to stop fibbing.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer smiled, but shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a better way than that, I tried it once before and it worked\r\nwell. See now, when you tell a lie I will not punish you, but you shall\r\npunish me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, startled at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall ferule me in the good old-fashioned way; I seldom do it\r\nmyself, but it may make you remember better to give me pain than to feel\r\nit yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrike you? Oh, I couldn't!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen mind that tripping tongue of thine. I have no wish to be hurt, but\r\nI would gladly bear much pain to cure this fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis suggestion made such an impression on Nat, that for a long time he\r\nset a watch upon his lips, and was desperately accurate, for Mr. Bhaer\r\njudged rightly, that love of him would be more powerful with Nat that\r\nfear for himself. But alas! one sad day Nat was off his guard, and when\r\npeppery Emil threatened to thrash him, if it was he who had run over his\r\ngarden and broken down his best hills of corn, Nat declared he didn't,\r\nand then was ashamed to own up that he did do it, when Jack was chasing\r\nhim the night before.\r\n\r\nHe thought no one would find it out, but Tommy happened to see him, and\r\nwhen Emil spoke of it a day or two later, Tommy gave his evidence, and\r\nMr. Bhaer heard it. School was over, and they were all standing about in\r\nthe hall, and Mr. Bhaer had just set down on the straw settee to enjoy\r\nhis frolic with Teddy; but when he heard Tommy and saw Nat turn scarlet,\r\nand look at him with a frightened face, he put the little boy down,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cGo to thy mother, bubchen, I will come soon,\xe2\x80\x9d and taking Nat by\r\nthe hand led him into the school and shut the door.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at one another in silence for a minute, then Tommy\r\nslipped out and peeping in at the half-closed blinds, beheld a sight\r\nthat quite bewildered him. Mr. Bhaer had just taken down the long rule\r\nthat hung over his desk, so seldom used that it was covered with dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eye! He's going to come down heavy on Nat this time. Wish I hadn't\r\ntold,\xe2\x80\x9d thought good-natured Tommy, for to be feruled was the deepest\r\ndisgrace at this school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember what I told you last time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, sorrowfully,\r\nnot angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but please don't make me, I can't bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, backing\r\nup against the door with both hands behind him, and a face full of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't he up and take it like a man? I would,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tommy, though\r\nhis heart beat fast at the sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall keep my word, and you must remember to tell the truth. Obey me,\r\nNat, take this and give me six good strokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTommy was so staggered by this last speech that he nearly tumbled down\r\nthe bank, but saved himself, and hung onto the window ledge, staring in\r\nwith eyes as round as the stuffed owl's on the chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nNat took the rule, for when Mr. Bhaer spoke in that tone everyone obeyed\r\nhim, and, looking as scared and guilty as if about to stab his master,\r\nhe gave two feeble blows on the broad hand held out to him. Then\r\nhe stopped and looked up half-blind with tears, but Mr. Bhaer said\r\nsteadily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, and strike harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if seeing that it must be done, and eager to have the hard task soon\r\nover, Nat drew his sleeve across his eyes and gave two more quick hard\r\nstrokes that reddened the hand, yet hurt the giver more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked in a breathless sort of tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo more,\xe2\x80\x9d was all the answer, and he gave them, hardly seeing where\r\nthey fell, then threw the rule all across the room, and hugging the kind\r\nhand in both his own, laid his face down on it sobbing out in a passion\r\nof love, and shame, and penitence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will remember! Oh! I will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Bhaer put an arm about him, and said in a tone as compassionate\r\nas it had just now been firm:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will. Ask the dear God to help you, and try to spare us\r\nboth another scene like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTommy saw no more, for he crept back to the hall, looking so excited and\r\nsober that the boys crowded round him to ask what was being done to Nat.\r\n\r\nIn a most impressive whisper Tommy told them, and they looked as if the\r\nsky was about to fall, for this reversing the order of things almost\r\ntook their breath away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made me do the same thing once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, as if confessing a crime\r\nof the deepest dye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you hit him? dear old Father Bhaer? By thunder, I'd just like\r\nto see you do it now!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned, collaring Emil in a fit of righteous\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was ever so long ago. I'd rather have my head cut off than do it\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d and Emil mildly laid Ned on his back instead of cuffing him, as he\r\nwould have felt it his duty to do on any less solemn occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, appalled at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was hopping mad at the time, and thought I shouldn't mind a\r\nbit, rather like it perhaps. But when I'd hit uncle one good crack,\r\neverything he had ever done for me came into my head all at once\r\nsomehow, and I couldn't go on. No sir! If he'd laid me down and walked\r\non me, I wouldn't have minded, I felt so mean,\xe2\x80\x9d and Emil gave himself a\r\ngood thump in the chest to express his sense of remorse for the past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat's crying like anything, and feels no end sorry, so don't let's say\r\na word about it; will we?\xe2\x80\x9d said tender-hearted Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we won't, but it's awful to tell lies,\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi looked as if\r\nhe found the awfulness much increased when the punishment fell not upon\r\nthe sinner, but his best Uncle Fritz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we all clear out, so Nat can cut upstairs if he wants to,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n proposed Franz, and led the way to the barn, their refuge in troublous\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nNat did not come to dinner, but Mrs. Jo took some up to him, and said a\r\ntender word, which did him good, though he could not look at her. By and\r\nby the lads playing outside heard the violin, and said among themselves:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's all right now.\xe2\x80\x9d He was all right, but felt shy about going down,\r\ntill opening his door to slip away into the woods, he found Daisy\r\nsitting on the stairs with neither work nor doll, only her little\r\nhandkerchief in her hand, as if she had been mourning for her captive\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to walk; want to come?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, trying to look as if\r\nnothing was the matter, yet feeling very grateful for her silent\r\nsympathy, because he fancied everyone must look upon him as a wretch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes!\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy ran for her hat, proud to be chosen as a companion\r\nby one of the big boys.\r\n\r\nThe others saw them go, but no one followed, for boys have a great deal\r\nmore delicacy than they get credit for, and the lads instinctively felt\r\nthat, when in disgrace, gentle little Daisy was their most congenial\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThe walk did Nat good, and he came home quieter than usual, but looking\r\ncheerful again, and hung all over with daisy-chains made by his little\r\nplaymate while he lay on the grass and told her stories.\r\n\r\nNo one said a word about the scene of the morning, but its effect was\r\nall the more lasting for that reason, perhaps. Nat tried his very best,\r\nand found much help, not only from the earnest little prayers he prayed\r\nto his Friend in heaven, but also in the patient care of the earthly\r\nfriend whose kind hand he never touched without remembering that it had\r\nwillingly borne pain for his sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. PATTYPANS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter, Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boys won't let me play with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say girls can't play football.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can, for I've done it!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Bhaer laughed at the remembrance\r\nof certain youthful frolics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I can play; Demi and I used to, and have nice times, but he\r\nwon't let me now because the other boys laugh at him,\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy looked\r\ndeeply grieved at her brother's hardness of heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the whole, I think he is right, deary. It's all very well when you\r\ntwo are alone, but it is too rough a game for you with a dozen boys; so\r\nI'd find some nice little play for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm tired of playing alone!\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy's tone was very mournful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll play with you by and by, but just now I must fly about and get\r\nthings ready for a trip into town. You shall go with me and see mamma,\r\nand if you like you can stay with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go and see her and Baby Josy, but I'd rather come\r\nback, please. Demi would miss me, and I love to be here, Aunty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't get on without your Demi, can you?\xe2\x80\x9d and Aunt Jo looked as if\r\nshe quite understood the love of the little girl for her only brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Course I can't; we're twins, and so we love each other more than other\r\npeople,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Daisy, with a brightening face, for she considered\r\nbeing a twin one of the highest honors she could ever receive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, what will you do with your little self while I fly around?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMrs. Bhaer, who was whisking piles of linen into a wardrobe with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know, I'm tired of dolls and things; I wish you'd make up a new\r\nplay for me, Aunty Jo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, swinging listlessly on the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to think of a brand new one, and it will take me some\r\ntime; so suppose you go down and see what Asia has got for your lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Mrs. Bhaer, thinking that would be a good way in which to\r\ndispose of the little hindrance for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I'd like that, if she isn't cross,\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy slowly\r\ndeparted to the kitchen, where Asia, the black cook, reigned\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, Daisy was back again, with a wide-awake face, a bit of\r\ndough in her hand and a dab of flour on her little nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh aunty! Please could I go and make gingersnaps and things? Asia isn't\r\ncross, and she says I may, and it would be such fun, please do,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nDaisy, all in one breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust the thing, go and welcome, make what you like, and stay as long as\r\nyou please,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bhaer, much relieved, for sometimes the one\r\nlittle girl was harder to amuse than the dozen boys.\r\n\r\nDaisy ran off, and while she worked, Aunt Jo racked her brain for a\r\nnew play. All of a sudden she seemed to have an idea, for she smiled\r\nto herself, slammed the doors of the wardrobe, and walked briskly away,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll do it, if it's a possible thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat it was no one found out that day, but Aunt Jo's eyes twinkled so\r\nwhen she told Daisy she had thought of a new play, and was going to buy\r\nit, that Daisy was much excited and asked questions all the way into\r\ntown, without getting answers that told her anything. She was left at\r\nhome to play with the new baby, and delight her mother's eyes, while\r\nAunt Jo went off shopping. When she came back with all sorts of queer\r\nparcels in corners of the carry-all, Daisy was so full of curiosity that\r\nshe wanted to go back to Plumfield at once. But her aunt would not be\r\nhurried, and made a long call in mamma's room, sitting on the floor with\r\nbaby in her lap, making Mrs. Brooke laugh at the pranks of the boys, and\r\nall sorts of droll nonsense.\r\n\r\nHow her aunt told the secret Daisy could not imagine, but her mother\r\nevidently knew it, for she said, as she tied on the little bonnet and\r\nkissed the rosy little face inside, \xe2\x80\x9cBe a good child, my Daisy, and\r\nlearn the nice new play aunty has got for you. It's a most useful and\r\ninteresting one, and it is very kind of her to play it with you, because\r\nshe does not like it very well herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis last speech made the two ladies laugh heartily, and increased\r\nDaisy's bewilderment. As they drove away something rattled in the back\r\nof the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy, pricking up her ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe new play,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Jo, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it made of?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIron, tin, wood, brass, sugar, salt, coal, and a hundred other things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange! What color is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll sorts of colors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it large?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPart of it is, and a part isn't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever see one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEver so many, but never one so nice as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what can it be? I can't wait. When shall I see it?\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy\r\nbounced up and down with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning, after lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it for the boys, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, all for you and Bess. The boys will like to see it, and want to\r\nplay one part of it. But you can do as you like about letting them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll let Demi, if he wants to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear that they won't all want to, especially Stuffy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs.\r\nBhaer's eyes twinkled more than ever as she patted a queer knobby bundle\r\nin her lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me feel just once,\xe2\x80\x9d prayed Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a feel; you'd guess in a minute and spoil the fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy groaned and then smiled all over her face, for through a little\r\nhole in the paper she caught a glimpse of something bright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I wait so long? Couldn't I see it today?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no! It has got to be arranged, and ever so many parts fixed in\r\ntheir places. I promised Uncle Teddy that you shouldn't see it till it\r\nwas all in apple-pie order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf uncle knows about it then it must be splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy,\r\nclapping her hands; for this kind, rich, jolly uncle of hers was as\r\ngood as a fairy godmother to the children, and was always planning merry\r\nsurprises, pretty gifts, and droll amusements for them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Teddy went and bought it with me, and we had such fun in the shop\r\nchoosing the different parts. He would have everything fine and large,\r\nand my little plan got regularly splendid when he took hold. You must\r\ngive him your very best kiss when he comes, for he is the kindest uncle\r\nthat ever went and bought a charming little coo Bless me! I nearly told\r\nyou what it was!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Bhaer cut that most interesting word short\r\noff in the middle, and began to look over her bills, as if afraid she\r\nwould let the cat out of the bag if she talked any more. Daisy folded\r\nher hands with an air of resignation, and sat quite still trying to\r\nthink what play had a \xe2\x80\x9ccoo\xe2\x80\x9d in it.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home she eyed every bundle that was taken out, and one\r\nlarge heavy one, which Franz took straight upstairs and hid in the\r\nnursery, filled her with amazement and curiosity. Something very\r\nmysterious went on up there that afternoon, for Franz was hammering,\r\nand Asia trotting up and down, and Aunt Jo flying around like a\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp, with all sort of things under her apron, while little\r\nTed, who was the only child admitted, because he couldn't talk plain,\r\nbabbled and laughed, and tried to tell what the \xe2\x80\x9csumpin pitty\xe2\x80\x9d was.\r\n\r\nAll this made Daisy half-wild, and her excitement spread among the boys,\r\nwho quite overwhelmed Mother Bhaer with offers of assistance, which she\r\ndeclined by quoting their own words to Daisy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls can't play with boys. This is for Daisy, and Bess, and me, so\r\nwe don't want you.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon the young gentlemen meekly retired, and\r\ninvited Daisy to a game of marbles, horse, football, anything she liked,\r\nwith a sudden warmth and politeness which astonished her innocent little\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThanks to these attentions, she got through the afternoon, went early\r\nto bed, and next morning did her lessons with an energy which made Uncle\r\nFritz wish that a new game could be invented every day. Quite a thrill\r\npervaded the school-room when Daisy was dismissed at eleven o'clock,\r\nfor everyone knew that now she was going to have the new and mysterious\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nMany eyes followed her as she ran away, and Demi's mind was so\r\ndistracted by this event that when Franz asked him where the desert\r\nof Sahara was, he mournfully replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the nursery,\xe2\x80\x9d and the whole\r\nschool laughed at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Jo, I've done all my lessons, and I can't wait one single minute\r\nmore!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, flying into Mrs. Bhaer's room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all ready, come on;\xe2\x80\x9d and tucking Ted under one arm, and her\r\nworkbasket under the other, Aunt Jo promptly led the way upstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't see anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, staring about her as she got inside\r\nthe nursery door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear anything?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Aunt Jo, catching Ted back by his little\r\nfrock as he was making straight for one side of the room.\r\n\r\nDaisy did hear an odd crackling, and then a purry little sound as of a\r\nkettle singing. These noises came from behind a curtain drawn before a\r\ndeep bay window. Daisy snatched it back, gave one joyful, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nstood gazing with delight at what do you think?\r\n\r\nA wide seat ran round the three sides of the window; on one side hung\r\nand stood all sorts of little pots and pans, gridirons and skillets;\r\non the other side a small dinner and tea set; and on the middle part a\r\ncooking-stove. Not a tin one, that was of no use, but a real iron stove,\r\nbig enough to cook for a large family of very hungry dolls. But the best\r\nof it was that a real fire burned in it, real steam came out of the\r\nnose of the little tea-kettle, and the lid of the little boiler actually\r\ndanced a jig, the water inside bubbled so hard. A pane of glass had\r\nbeen taken out and replaced by a sheet of tin, with a hole for the small\r\nfunnel, and real smoke went sailing away outside so naturally, that it\r\ndid one's heart good to see it. The box of wood with a hod of charcoal\r\nstood near by; just above hung dust-pan, brush and broom; a little\r\nmarket basket was on the low table at which Daisy used to play, and over\r\nthe back of her little chair hung a white apron with a bib, and a droll\r\nmob cap. The sun shone in as if he enjoyed the fun, the little stove\r\nroared beautifully, the kettle steamed, the new tins sparkled on the\r\nwalls, the pretty china stood in tempting rows, and it was altogether as\r\ncheery and complete a kitchen as any child could desire.\r\n\r\nDaisy stood quite still after the first glad \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d but her eyes went\r\nquickly from one charming object to another, brightening as they looked,\r\ntill they came to Aunt Jo's merry face; there they stopped as the happy\r\nlittle girl hugged her, saying gratefully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh aunty, it's a splendid new play! Can I really cook at the dear\r\nstove, and have parties and mess, and sweep, and make fires that truly\r\nburn? I like it so much! What made you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour liking to make gingersnaps with Asia made me think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bhaer, holding Daisy, who frisked as if she would fly. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew Asia\r\nwouldn't let you mess in her kitchen very often, and it wouldn't be\r\nsafe at this fire up here, so I thought I'd see if I could find a little\r\nstove for you, and teach you to cook; that would be fun, and useful too.\r\nSo I travelled round among the toy shops, but everything large cost too\r\nmuch and I was thinking I should have to give it up, when I met Uncle\r\nTeddy. As soon as he knew what I was about, he said he wanted to help,\r\nand insisted on buying the biggest toy stove we could find. I scolded,\r\nbut he only laughed, and teased me about my cooking when we were young,\r\nand said I must teach Bess as well as you, and went on buying all sorts\r\nof nice little things for my 'cooking class' as he called it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm so glad you met him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, as Mrs. Jo stopped to laugh at\r\nthe memory of the funny time she had with Uncle Teddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must study hard and learn to make all kinds of things, for he says\r\nhe shall come out to tea very often, and expects something uncommonly\r\nnice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the sweetest, dearest kitchen in the world, and I'd rather\r\nstudy with it than do anything else. Can't I learn pies, and cake, and\r\nmacaroni, and everything?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, dancing round the room with a\r\nnew saucepan in one hand and the tiny poker in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll in good time. This is to be a useful play, I am to help you, and\r\nyou are to be my cook, so I shall tell you what to do, and show you how.\r\nThen we shall have things fit to eat, and you will be really learning\r\nhow to cook on a small scale. I'll call you Sally, and say you are a new\r\ngirl just come,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Jo, settling down to work, while Teddy sat\r\non the floor sucking his thumb, and staring at the stove as if it was a\r\nlive thing, whose appearance deeply interested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be so lovely! What shall I do first?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sally, with such\r\na happy face and willing air that Aunt Jo wished all new cooks were half\r\nas pretty and pleasant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, put on this clean cap and apron. I am rather\r\nold-fashioned, and I like my cook to be very tidy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSally tucked her curly hair into the round cap, and put on the apron\r\nwithout a murmur, though usually she rebelled against bibs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you can put things in order, and wash up the new china. The old\r\nset needs washing also, for my last girl was apt to leave it in a sad\r\nstate after a party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAunt Jo spoke quite soberly, but Sally laughed, for she knew who the\r\nuntidy girl was who had left the cups sticky. Then she turned up her\r\ncuffs, and with a sigh of satisfaction began to stir about her kitchen,\r\nhaving little raptures now and then over the \xe2\x80\x9csweet rolling pin,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdarling dish-tub,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9ccunning pepper-pot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Sally, take your basket and go to market; here is the list of\r\nthings I want for dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, giving her a bit of paper when\r\nthe dishes were all in order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the market?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy, thinking that the new play got more\r\nand more interesting every minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsia is the market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAway went Sally, causing another stir in the schoolroom as she passed\r\nthe door in her new costume, and whispered to Demi, with a face full of\r\ndelight, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a perfectly splendid play!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Asia enjoyed the joke as much as Daisy, and laughed jollily as the\r\nlittle girl came flying into the room with her cap all on one side, the\r\nlids of her basket rattling like castanets and looking like a very crazy\r\nlittle cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Aunt Jo wants these things, and I must have them right away,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDaisy, importantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's see, honey; here's two pounds of steak, potatoes, squash, apples,\r\nbread, and butter. The meat ain't come yet; when it does I'll send it\r\nup. The other things are all handy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Asia packed one potato, one apple, a bit of squash, a little pat\r\nof butter, and a roll, into the basket, telling Sally to be on the watch\r\nfor the butcher's boy, because he sometimes played tricks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy hoped it would be Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll see,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Asia would say; and Sally went off in great\r\nspirits, singing a verse from dear Mary Howitt's sweet story in rhyme:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAway went little Mabel,\r\n     With the wheaten cake so fine,\r\n     The new-made pot of butter,\r\n     And the little flask of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut everything but the apple into the store-closet for the present,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Jo, when the cook got home.\r\n\r\nThere was a cupboard under the middle shelf, and on opening the door\r\nfresh delights appeared. One half was evidently the cellar, for wood,\r\ncoal, and kindlings were piled there. The other half was full of little\r\njars, boxes, and all sorts of droll contrivances for holding small\r\nquantities of flour, meal, sugar, salt, and other household stores. A\r\npot of jam was there, a little tin box of gingerbread, a cologne bottle\r\nfull of currant wine, and a tiny canister of tea. But the crowning charm\r\nwas two doll's pans of new milk, with cream actually rising on it, and\r\na wee skimmer all ready to skim it with. Daisy clasped her hands at\r\nthis delicious spectacle, and wanted to skim it immediately. But Aunt Jo\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet; you will want the cream to eat on your apple pie at dinner,\r\nand must not disturb it till then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I going to have pie?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, hardly believing that such bliss\r\ncould be in store for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; if your oven does well we will have two pies, one apple and one\r\nstrawberry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, who was nearly as much interested in the new\r\nplay as Daisy herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what next?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sally, all impatience to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut the lower draught of the stove, so that the oven may heat.\r\nThen wash your hands and get out the flour, sugar, salt, butter, and\r\ncinnamon. See if the pie-board is clean, and pare your apple ready to\r\nput in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could be\r\nexpected, from so young a cook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don't know how to measure for such tiny pies; I must guess\r\nat it, and if these don't succeed, we must try again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo,\r\nlooking rather perplexed, and very much amused with the small concern\r\nbefore her. \xe2\x80\x9cTake that little pan full of flour, put in a pinch of salt,\r\nand then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate. Always remember\r\nto put your dry things together first, and then the wet. It mixes better\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how; I saw Asia do it. Don't I butter the pie plates too? She\r\ndid, the first thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, whisking the flour about at a great\r\nrate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right! I do believe you have a gift for cooking, you take to it\r\nso cleverly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow a dash of cold water,\r\njust enough to wet it; then scatter some flour on the board, work in\r\na little, and roll the paste out; yes, that's the way. Now put dabs of\r\nbutter all over it, and roll it out again. We won't have our pastry very\r\nrich, or the dolls will get dyspeptic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy laughed at the idea, and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand.\r\nThen she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin, and having\r\ngot her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it. Next the\r\napple was sliced in, sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it, and\r\nthen the top crust put on with breathless care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always wanted to cut them round, and Asia never would let me. How\r\nnice it is to do it all my ownty donty self!\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, as the little\r\nknife went clipping round the doll's plate poised on her hand.\r\n\r\nAll cooks, even the best, meet with mishaps sometimes, and Sally's first\r\none occurred then, for the knife went so fast that the plate slipped,\r\nturned a somersault in the air, and landed the dear little pie upside\r\ndown on the floor. Sally screamed, Mrs. Jo laughed, Teddy scrambled to\r\nget it, and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn't spill or break, because I pinched the edges together so hard;\r\nit isn't hurt a bit, so I'll prick holes in it, and then it will be\r\nready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, picking up the capsized treasure and putting it into\r\nshape with a child-like disregard of the dust it had gathered in its\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy new cook has a good temper, I see, and that is such a comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Jo. \xe2\x80\x9cNow open the jar of strawberry jam, fill the uncovered pie,\r\nand put some strips of paste over the top as Asia does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll make a D in the middle, and have zigzags all round, that will be\r\nso interesting when I come to eat it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally, loading the pie with\r\nquirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I put them in!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed; when the last grimy knob had been\r\ncarefully planted in the red field of jam, and with an air of triumph\r\nshe shut them into the little oven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear up your things; a good cook never lets her utensils collect. Then\r\npare your squash and potatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one potato,\xe2\x80\x9d giggled Sally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCut it in four pieces, so it will go into the little kettle, and put\r\nthe bits into cold water till it is time to cook them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I soak the squash too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed! Just pare it and cut it up, and put in into the steamer\r\nover the pot. It is drier so, though it takes longer to cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it, when Kit\r\nappeared with a covered basket in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's the butcher boy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, much tickled at the idea, as she\r\nrelieved him of his load, whereat he licked his lips and began to beg,\r\nevidently thinking that it was his own dinner, for he often carried it\r\nto his master in that way. Being undeceived, he departed in great wrath\r\nand barked all the way downstairs, to ease his wounded feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the basket were two bits of steak (doll's pounds), a baked pear, a\r\nsmall cake, and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled, \xe2\x80\x9cFor Missy's\r\nlunch, if her cookin' don't turn out well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't want any of her old pears and things; my cooking will turn out\r\nwell, and I'll have a splendid dinner; see if I don't!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may like them if company should come. It is always well to have\r\nsomething in the storeroom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, who had been taught this\r\nvaluable fact by a series of domestic panics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe is hundry,\xe2\x80\x9d announced Teddy, who began to think what with so much\r\ncooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something. His\r\nmother gave him her workbasket to rummage, hoping to keep him quiet till\r\ndinner was ready, and returned to her housekeeping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut on your vegetables, set the table, and then have some coals\r\nkindling ready for the steak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot;\r\nto peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer; to whisk\r\nopen the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on, and\r\nat last when the coals were red and glowing, to put two real steaks on\r\na finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork. The potatoes\r\nwere done first, and no wonder, for they had boiled frantically all the\r\nwhile. The were pounded up with a little pestle, had much butter and no\r\nsalt put in (cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment), then it\r\nwas made into a mound in a gay red dish, smoothed over with a knife\r\ndipped in milk, and put in the oven to brown.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed in these last performances had Sally been, that she forgot\r\nher pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato, then a wail\r\narose, for alas! alas! the little pies were burnt black!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my pies! My darling pies! They are all spoilt!\xe2\x80\x9d cried poor Sally,\r\nwringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work.\r\nThe tart was especially pathetic, for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in\r\nall directions from the blackened jelly, like the walls and chimney of a\r\nhouse after a fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, I forgot to remind you to take them out; it's just my\r\nluck,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, remorsefully. \xe2\x80\x9cDon't cry, darling, it was my fault;\r\nwe'll try again after dinner,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, as a great tear dropped from\r\nSally's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart.\r\n\r\nMore would have followed, if the steak had not blazed up just then,\r\nand so occupied the attention of cook, that she quickly forgot the lost\r\npastry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the meat-dish and your own plates down to warm, while you mash the\r\nsquash with butter, salt, and a little pepper on the top,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo,\r\ndevoutly hoping that the dinner would meet with no further disasters.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ccunning pepper-pot\xe2\x80\x9d soothed Sally's feelings, and she dished up her\r\nsquash in fine style. The dinner was safely put upon the table; the six\r\ndolls were seated three on a side; Teddy took the bottom, and Sally the\r\ntop. When all were settled, it was a most imposing spectacle, for one\r\ndoll was in full ball costume, another in her night-gown; Jerry, the\r\nworsted boy, wore his red winter suit, while Annabella, the noseless\r\ndarling, was airily attired in nothing but her own kid skin. Teddy, as\r\nfather of the family, behaved with great propriety, for he smilingly\r\ndevoured everything offered him, and did not find a single fault. Daisy\r\nbeamed upon her company like the weary, warm, but hospitable hostess so\r\noften to be seen at larger tables than this, and did the honors with an\r\nair of innocent satisfaction, which we do not often see elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe steak was so tough that the little carving-knife would not cut it;\r\nthe potato did not go round, and the squash was very lumpy; but the\r\nguests appeared politely unconscious of these trifles; and the master\r\nand mistress of the house cleared the table with appetites that anyone\r\nmight envy them. The joy of skimming a jug-full of cream mitigated the\r\nanguish felt for the loss of the pies, and Asia's despised cake proved a\r\ntreasure in the way of dessert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the nicest lunch I ever had; can't I do it every day?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nDaisy as she scraped up and ate the leavings all round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can cook things every day after lessons, but I prefer that you\r\nshould eat your dishes at your regular meals, and only have a bit of\r\ngingerbread for lunch. To-day, being the first time, I don't mind, but\r\nwe must keep our rules. This afternoon you can make something for tea\r\nif you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, who had enjoyed the dinner-party very much,\r\nthough no one had invited her to partake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo let me make flapjacks for Demi, he loves them so, and it's such fun\r\nto turn them and put sugar in between,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, tenderly wiping a\r\nyellow stain off Annabella's broken nose, for Bella had refused to eat\r\nsquash when it was pressed upon her as good for \xe2\x80\x9clumatism,\xe2\x80\x9d a complaint\r\nwhich it is no wonder she suffered from, considering the lightness of\r\nher attire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you give Demi goodies, all the others will expect some also, and\r\nthen you will have your hands full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn't I have Demi come up to tea alone just this one time? And after\r\nthat I could cook things for the others if they were good,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed\r\nDaisy, with a sudden inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a capital idea, Posy! We will make your little messes rewards\r\nfor the good boys, and I don't know one among them who would not like\r\nsomething nice to eat more than almost anything else. If little men are\r\nlike big ones, good cooking will touch their hearts and soothe their\r\ntempers delightfully,\xe2\x80\x9d added Aunt Jo, with a merry nod toward the\r\ndoor, where stood Papa Bhaer, surveying the scene with a face full of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat last hit was for me, sharp woman. I accept it, for it is true; but\r\nif I had married thee for thy cooking, heart's dearest, I should have\r\nfared badly all these years,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the professor, laughing as he\r\ntossed Teddy, who became quite apoplectic in his endeavors to describe\r\nthe feast he had just enjoyed.\r\n\r\nDaisy proudly showed her kitchen, and rashly promised Uncle Fritz as\r\nmany flapjacks as he could eat. She was just telling about the new\r\nrewards when the boys, headed by Demi, burst into the room snuffing the\r\nair like a pack of hungry hounds, for school was out, dinner was not\r\nready, and the fragrance of Daisy's steak led them straight to the spot.\r\n\r\nA prouder little damsel was never seen than Sally as she displayed her\r\ntreasures and told the lads what was in store for them. Several rather\r\nscoffed at the idea of her cooking anything fit to eat, but Stuffy's\r\nheart was won at once. Nat and Demi had firm faith in her skill, and the\r\nothers said they would wait and see. All admired the kitchen, however,\r\nand examined the stove with deep interest. Demi offered to buy\r\nthe boiler on the spot, to be used in a steam-engine which he was\r\nconstructing; and Ned declared that the best and biggest saucepan was\r\njust the thing to melt his lead in when he ran bullets, hatchets, and\r\nsuch trifles.\r\n\r\nDaisy looked so alarmed at these proposals, that Mrs. Jo then and\r\nthere made and proclaimed a law that no boy should touch, use, or\r\neven approach the sacred stove without a special permit from the\r\nowner thereof. This increased its value immensely in the eyes of the\r\ngentlemen, especially as any infringement of the law would be punished\r\nby forfeiture of all right to partake of the delicacies promised to the\r\nvirtuous.\r\n\r\nAt this point the bell rang, and the entire population went down to\r\ndinner, which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving Daisy a\r\nlist of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as he\r\nearned them. Daisy, whose faith in her stove was unlimited, promised\r\neverything, if Aunt Jo would tell her how to make them. This suggestion\r\nrather alarmed Mrs. Jo, for some of the dishes were quite beyond her\r\nskill wedding-cake, for instance, bull's-eye candy; and cabbage soup\r\nwith herrings and cherries in it, which Mr. Bhaer proposed as his\r\nfavorite, and immediately reduced his wife to despair, for German\r\ncookery was beyond her.\r\n\r\nDaisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done, but she was only\r\nallowed to clear up, fill the kettle ready for tea, and wash out her\r\napron, which looked as if she had a Christmas feast. She was then sent\r\nout to play till five o'clock, for Uncle Fritz said that too much study,\r\neven at cooking stoves, was bad for little minds and bodies, and Aunt Jo\r\nknew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they are\r\nnot prudently used.\r\n\r\nEveryone was very kind to Daisy that afternoon. Tommy promised her the\r\nfirst fruits of his garden, though the only visible crop just then was\r\npigweed; Nat offered to supply her with wood, free of charge; Stuffy\r\nquite worshipped her; Ned immediately fell to work on a little\r\nrefrigerator for her kitchen; and Demi, with a punctuality beautiful\r\nto see in one so young, escorted her to the nursery just as the clock\r\nstruck five. It was not time for the party to begin, but he begged so\r\nhard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitors\r\nenjoy, for he kindled the fire, ran errands, and watched the progress\r\nof his supper with intense interest. Mrs. Jo directed the affair as she\r\ncame and went, being very busy putting up clean curtains all over the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk Asia for a cup of sour cream, then your cakes will be light without\r\nmuch soda, which I don't like,\xe2\x80\x9d was the first order.\r\n\r\nDemi tore downstairs, and returned with the cream, also a puckered-up\r\nface, for he had tasted it on his way, and found it so sour that he\r\npredicted the cakes would be uneatable. Mrs. Jo took this occasion to\r\ndeliver a short lecture from the step-ladder on the chemical properties\r\nof soda, to which Daisy did not listen, but Demi did, and understood it,\r\nas he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I see, soda turns sour things sweet, and the fizzling up makes\r\nthem light. Let's see you do it, Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, everything has to have salt in it, seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sally,\r\nwho was tired of opening the pill-box in which it was kept.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSalt is like good-humor, and nearly every thing is better for a pinch\r\nof it, Posy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Uncle Fritz stopped as he passed, hammer in hand, to\r\ndrive up two or three nails for Sally's little pans to hang on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not invited to tea, but I'll give you some cakes, and I won't\r\nbe cross,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, putting up her floury little face to thank him\r\nwith a kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFritz, you must not interrupt my cooking class, or I'll come in and\r\nmoralize when you are teaching Latin. How would you like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Jo, throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, try it and see,\xe2\x80\x9d and the amiable Father Bhaer went singing\r\nand tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the soda into the cream, and when it 'fizzles,' as Demi says, stir\r\nit into the flour, and beat it up as hard as ever you can. Have your\r\ngriddle hot, butter it well, and then fry away till I come back,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nAunt Jo vanished also.\r\n\r\nSuch a clatter as the little spoon made, and such a beating as the\r\nbatter got, it quite foamed, I assure you; and when Daisy poured some\r\non to the griddle, it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that made\r\nDemi's mouth water. To be sure, the first one stuck and scorched,\r\nbecause she forgot the butter, but after that first failure all went\r\nwell, and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I like maple-syrup better than sugar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, from his\r\narm-chair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a new\r\nand peculiar manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go and ask Asia for some,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Daisy, going into the\r\nbath-room to wash her hands.\r\n\r\nWhile the nursery was empty something dreadful happened. You see, Kit\r\nhad been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yet\r\ngot none to pay him. He was not a bad dog, but he had his little faults\r\nlike the rest of us, and could not always resist temptation. Happening\r\nto stroll into the nursery at that moment, he smelt the cakes, saw them\r\nunguarded on the low table, and never stopping to think of consequences,\r\nswallowed all six at one mouthful. I am glad to say that they were very\r\nhot, and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp.\r\nDaisy heard it, ran in, saw the empty dish, also the end of a yellow\r\ntail disappearing under the bed. Without a word she seized that tail,\r\npulled out the thief, and shook him till his ears flapped wildly, then\r\nbundled him down-stairs to the shed, where he spent a lonely evening in\r\nthe coal-bin.\r\n\r\nCheered by the sympathy which Demi gave her, Daisy made another bowlful\r\nof batter, and fried a dozen cakes, which were even better than the\r\nothers. Indeed, Uncle Fritz after eating two sent up word that he had\r\nnever tasted any so nice, and every boy at the table below envied Demi\r\nat the flapjack party above.\r\n\r\nIt was a truly delightful supper, for the little teapot lid only fell\r\noff three times and the milk jug upset but once; the cakes floated in\r\nsyrup, and the toast had a delicious beef-steak flavor, owing to cook's\r\nusing the gridiron to make it on. Demi forgot philosophy, and stuffed\r\nlike any carnal boy, while Daisy planned sumptuous banquets, and the\r\ndolls looked on smiling affably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dearies, have you had a good time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo, coming up with\r\nTeddy on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very good time. I shall come again soon,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Demi, with\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid you have eaten too much, by the look of that table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven't; I only ate fifteen cakes, and they were very little\r\nones,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Demi, who had kept his sister busy supplying his plate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won't hurt him, they are so nice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, with such a funny\r\nmixture of maternal fondness and housewifely pride that Aunt Jo could\r\nonly smile and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, on the whole, the new game is a success then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, as if his approval was all that was necessary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the dearest play ever made!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, hugging her little\r\ndish-tub as she proposed to wash up the cups. \xe2\x80\x9cI just wish everybody\r\nhad a sweet cooking stove like mine,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, regarding it with\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis play out to have a name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, gravely removing the syrup\r\nfrom his countenance with his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked both children eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think we will call it Pattypans,\xe2\x80\x9d and Aunt Jo retired,\r\nsatisfied with the success of her last trap to catch a sunbeam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. A FIRE BRAND\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, ma'am, could I speak to you? It is something very important,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Nat, popping his head in at the door of Mrs. Bhaer's room.\r\n\r\nIt was the fifth head which had popped in during the last half-hour; but\r\nMrs. Jo was used to it, so she looked up, and said, briskly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, my lad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat came in, shut the door carefully behind him, and said in an eager,\r\nanxious tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's a boy I used to know when I fiddled round the streets. He sold\r\npapers, and he was kind to me, and I saw him the other day in town, and\r\ntold him how nice it was here, and he's come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear boy, that is rather a sudden way to pay a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it isn't a visit; he wants to stay if you will let him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don't know about that,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mrs. Bhaer, rather startled by\r\nthe coolness of the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with you,\r\nand be kind to 'em as you were to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, looking surprised and\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I do, but I like to know something about them first. I have to\r\nchoose them, because there are so many. I have not room for all. I wish\r\nI had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told him to come because I thought you'd like it, but if there isn't\r\nroom he can go away again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\nThe boy's confidence in her hospitality touched Mrs. Bhaer, and she\r\ncould not find the heart to disappoint his hope, and spoil his kind\r\nlittle plan, so she said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about this Dan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know any thing, only he hasn't got any folks, and he's poor,\r\nand he was good to me, so I'd like to be good to him if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent reasons every one; but really, Nat, the house is full, and\r\nI don't know where I could put him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, more and more\r\ninclined to prove herself the haven of refuge he seemed to think her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe could have my bed, and I could sleep in the barn. It isn't cold\r\nnow, and I don't mind, I used to sleep anywhere with father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nSomething in his speech and face made Mrs. Jo put her hand on his\r\nshoulder, and say in her kindest tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring in your friend, Nat; I think we must find room for him without\r\ngiving him your place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat joyfully ran off, and soon returned followed by a most\r\nunprepossessing boy, who slouched in and stood looking about him, with a\r\nhalf bold, half sullen look, which made Mrs. Bhaer say to herself, after\r\none glance,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bad specimen, I am afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Dan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, presenting him as if sure of his welcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat tells me you would like to come and stay with us,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mrs. Jo,\r\nin a friendly tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the gruff reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you no friends to take care of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, 'No, ma'am,'\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan't neither,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout fourteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look older. What can you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Most anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you stay here we shall want you to do as the others do, work and\r\nstudy as well as play. Are you willing to agree to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't mind trying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can stay a few days, and we will see how we get on together.\r\nTake him out, Nat, and amuse him till Mr. Bhaer comes home, when we will\r\nsettle about the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, finding it rather difficult to\r\nget on with this cool young person, who fixed his big black eyes on her\r\nwith a hard, suspicious expression, sorrowfully unboyish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Nat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and slouched out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nat, as he followed him, feeling without quite\r\nunderstanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his\r\nungracious friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fellows are having a circus out in the barn; don't you want to come\r\nand see it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they big fellows?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the big ones are gone fishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFire away, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\nNat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set, who were\r\ndisporting themselves among the half-empty lofts. A large circle was\r\nmarked out with hay on the wide floor, and in the middle stood Demi with\r\na long whip, while Tommy, mounted on the much-enduring Toby, pranced\r\nabout the circle playing being a monkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must pay a pin apiece, or you can't see the show,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy,\r\nwho stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band, consisting of a\r\npocket-comb blown upon by Ned, and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by\r\nRob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's company, so I'll pay for both,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, handsomely, as he stuck\r\ntwo crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box.\r\n\r\nWith a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards,\r\nand the performance went on. After the monkey act, Ned gave them a fine\r\nspecimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair, and running up\r\nand down ladders, sailor fashion. Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity\r\nbeautiful to behold. Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy, and\r\nspeedily laid that stout youth upon the ground. After this, Tommy\r\nproudly advanced to turn a somersault, an accomplishment which he had\r\nacquired by painful perseverance, practising in private till every joint\r\nof his little frame was black and blue. His feats were received with\r\ngreat applause, and he was about to retire, flushed with pride and a\r\nrush of blood to the head, when a scornful voice in the audience was\r\nheard to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! that ain't any thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that again, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy bristled up like an angry\r\nturkey-cock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to fight?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, promptly descending from the barrel\r\nand doubling up his fists in a business-like manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't;\xe2\x80\x9d and the candid Thomas retired a step, rather taken aback\r\nby the proposition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFighting isn't allowed!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the others, much excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a nice lot,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, if you don't behave, you shan't stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, firing up at\r\nthat insult to his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to see him do better than I did, that's all,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Tommy,\r\nwith a swagger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear the way, then,\xe2\x80\x9d and without the slightest preparation Dan turned\r\nthree somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't beat that, Tom; you always hit your head and tumble flat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Nat, pleased at his friend's success.\r\n\r\nBefore he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more\r\nsomersaults backwards, and a short promenade on the hands, head down,\r\nfeet up. This brought down the house, and Tommy joined in the admiring\r\ncries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself, and\r\nlooked at them with an air of calm superiority.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I could learn to do it without its hurting me very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Tom meekly asked, as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after the\r\nlast attempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you give me if I'll teach you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy new jack-knife; it's got five blades, and only one is broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle.\r\nDan examined it carefully, then putting it into his pocket, walked off,\r\nsaying with a wink,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it up till you learn, that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA howl of wrath from Tommy was followed by a general uproar, which did\r\nnot subside till Dan, finding himself in a minority, proposed that they\r\nshould play stick-knife, and whichever won should have the treasure.\r\nTommy agreed, and the game was played in a circle of excited faces,\r\nwhich all wore an expression of satisfaction, when Tommy won and secured\r\nthe knife in the depth of his safest pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come off with me, and I'll show you round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, feeling that\r\nhe must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between them no one knew, but when they appeared again, Dan\r\nwas more respectful to every one, though still gruff in his speech, and\r\nrough in his manner; and what else could be expected of the poor lad\r\nwho had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one to\r\nteach him any better?\r\n\r\nThe boys had decided that they did not like him, and so they left him\r\nto Nat, who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility, but too\r\nkind-hearted to desert him.\r\n\r\nTommy, however, felt that in spite of the jack-knife transaction,\r\nthere was a bond of sympathy between them, and longed to return to the\r\ninteresting subject of somersaults. He soon found an opportunity, for\r\nDan, seeing how much he admired him, grew more amiable, and by the end\r\nof the first week was quite intimate with the lively Tom.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer, when he heard the story and saw Dan, shook his head, but only\r\nsaid quietly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe experiment may cost us something, but we will try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Dan felt any gratitude for his protection, he did not show it, and\r\ntook without thanks all that was give him. He was ignorant, but very\r\nquick to learn when he chose; had sharp eyes to watch what went on about\r\nhim; a saucy tongue, rough manners, and a temper that was fierce and\r\nsullen by turns. He played with all his might, and played well at almost\r\nall the games. He was silent and gruff before grown people, and only\r\nnow and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads. Few of them really\r\nliked him, but few could help admiring his courage and strength, for\r\nnothing daunted him, and he knocked tall Franz flat on one occasion with\r\nan ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance from\r\nhis fists. Mr. Bhaer watched him silently, and did his best to tame the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild Boy,\xe2\x80\x9d as they called him, but in private the worthy man shook his\r\nhead, and said soberly, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the experiment will turn out well, but I\r\nam a little afraid it may cost too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day, yet\r\nnever gave him up, and always insisted that there was something good\r\nin the lad, after all; for he was kinder to animals than to people, he\r\nliked to rove about in the woods, and, best of all, little Ted was fond\r\nof him. What the secret was no one could discover, but Baby took to him\r\nat once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong back\r\nto ride on to any of the others and called him \xe2\x80\x9cMy Danny\xe2\x80\x9d out of his\r\nown little head. Teddy was the only creature to whom Dan showed an\r\naffection, and this was only manifested when he thought no one\r\nelse would see it; but mothers' eyes are quick, and motherly hearts\r\ninstinctively divine who love their babies. So Mrs. Jo soon saw and felt\r\nthat there was a soft spot in rough Dan, and bided her time to touch and\r\nwin him.\r\n\r\nBut an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plans,\r\nand banished Dan from Plumfield.\r\n\r\nTommy, Nat, and Demi began by patronizing Dan, because the other\r\nlads rather slighted him; but soon they each felt there was a certain\r\nfascination about the bad boy, and from looking down upon him they came\r\nto looking up, each for a different reason. Tommy admired his skill and\r\ncourage; Nat was grateful for past kindness; and Demi regarded him as\r\na sort of animated story book, for when he chose Dan could tell his\r\nadventures in a most interesting way. It pleased Dan to have the three\r\nfavorites like him, and he exerted himself to be agreeable, which was\r\nthe secret of his success.\r\n\r\nThe Bhaers were surprised, but hoped the lads would have a good\r\ninfluence over Dan, and waited with some anxiety, trusting that no harm\r\nwould come of it.\r\n\r\nDan felt they did not quite trust him, and never showed them his best\r\nside, but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting\r\ntheir hopes as far as he dared.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting, and did not think it a proof of\r\neither manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for\r\nthe amusement of the rest. All sorts of hardy games and exercises were\r\nencouraged, and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles\r\nwithout whining; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it\r\nwere forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play.\r\n\r\nDan laughed at this rule, and told such exciting tales of his own valor,\r\nand the many frays that he had been in, that some of the lads were fired\r\nwith a desire to have a regular good \xe2\x80\x9cmill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't tell, and I'll show you how,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan; and, getting half a dozen\r\nof the lads together behind the barn, he gave them a lesson in boxing,\r\nwhich quite satisfied the ardor of most of them. Emil, however, could\r\nnot submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself, for Emil was\r\npast fourteen and a plucky fellow, so he challenged Dan to a fight. Dan\r\naccepted at once, and the others looked on with intense interest.\r\n\r\nWhat little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew,\r\nbut, in the very hottest of the fray, when Dan and Emil were fighting\r\nlike a pair of young bulldogs, and the others with fierce, excited\r\nfaces were cheering them on, Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring, plucked the\r\ncombatants apart with a strong hand, and said, in the voice they seldom\r\nheard,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't allow this, boys! Stop it at once; and never let me see it\r\nagain. I keep a school for boys, not for wild beasts. Look at each other\r\nand be ashamed of yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou let me go, and I'll knock him down again,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Dan, sparring\r\naway in spite of the grip on his collar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, come on, I ain't thrashed yet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emil, who had been down\r\nfive times, but did not know when he was beaten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are playing be gladdy what-you-call-'ems, like the Romans, Uncle\r\nFritz,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Demi, whose eyes were bigger than ever with the\r\nexcitement of this new pastime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were a fine set of brutes; but we have learned something since\r\nthen, I hope, and I cannot have you make my barn a Colosseum. Who\r\nproposed this?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan,\xe2\x80\x9d answered several voices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you know that it is forbidden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Dan, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why break the rule?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey'll all be molly-coddles, if they don't know how to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you found Emil a molly-coddle? He doesn't look much like one,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face. Dan had a black eye, and his\r\njacket was torn to rags, but Emil's face was covered with blood from a\r\ncut lip and a bruised nose, while a bump on his forehead was already as\r\npurple as a plum. In spite of his wounds however, he still glared upon\r\nhis foe, and evidently panted to renew the fight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe'd make a first-rater if he was taught,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, unable to withhold\r\nthe praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe'll be taught to fence and box by and by, and till then I think\r\nhe will do very well without any lessons in mauling. Go and wash your\r\nfaces; and remember, Dan, if you break any more of the rules again, you\r\nwill be sent away. That was the bargain; do your part and we will do\r\nours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lads went off, and after a few more words to the spectators, Mr.\r\nBhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators. Emil went\r\nto bed sick, and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week.\r\n\r\nBut the lawless lad had no thought of obeying, and soon transgressed\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play, Tommy\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's go down to the river, and cut a lot of new fish-poles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Toby to drag them back, and one of us can ride him down,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed\r\nStuffy, who hated to walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means you, I suppose; well, hurry up, lazy-bones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\nAway they went, and having got the poles were about to go home, when\r\nDemi unluckily said to Tommy, who was on Toby with a long rod in his\r\nhand,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight, only you\r\nhaven't got a red cloth, or pretty clothes on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to see one; there's old Buttercup in the big meadow, ride at\r\nher, Tom, and see her run,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed Dan, bent on mischief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you mustn't,\xe2\x80\x9d began Demi, who was learning to distrust Dan's\r\npropositions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, little fuss-button?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think Uncle Fritz would like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ever say we must not have a bull-fight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't think he ever did,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen hold your tongue. Drive on, Tom, and here's a red rag to flap at\r\nthe old thing. I'll help you to stir her up,\xe2\x80\x9d and over the wall went\r\nDan, full of the new game, and the rest followed like a flock of sheep;\r\neven Demi, who sat upon the bars, and watched the fun with interest.\r\n\r\nPoor Buttercup was not in a very good mood, for she had been lately\r\nbereft of her calf, and mourned for the little thing most dismally. Just\r\nnow she regarded all mankind as her enemies (and I do not blame her),\r\nso when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief\r\nflying at the end of his long lance, she threw up her head, and gave\r\na most appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cMoo!\xe2\x80\x9d Tommy rode gallantly at her, and Toby\r\nrecognizing an old friend, was quite willing to approach; but when the\r\nlance came down on her back with a loud whack, both cow and donkey were\r\nsurprised and disgusted. Toby back with a bray of remonstrance, and\r\nButtercup lowered her horns angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt her again, Tom; she's jolly cross, and will do it capitally!\xe2\x80\x9d called\r\nDan, coming up behind with another rod, while Jack and Ned followed his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nSeeing herself thus beset, and treated with such disrespect, Buttercup\r\ntrotted round the field, getting more and more bewildered and excited\r\nevery moment, for whichever way she turned, there was a dreadful boy,\r\nyelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip. It was\r\ngreat fun for them, but real misery for her, till she lost patience and\r\nturned the tables in the most unexpected manner. All at once she wheeled\r\nshort round, and charged full at her old friend Toby, whose conduct cut\r\nher to the heart. Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped\r\nover a stone, and down went horse, matadore, and all, in one ignominious\r\nheap, while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall,\r\nand galloped wildly out of sight down the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch her, stop her, head her off! run, boys, run!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Dan,\r\ntearing after her at his best pace, for she was Mr. Bhaer's pet\r\nAlderney, and if anything happened to her, Dan feared it would be all\r\nover with him. Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as\r\nthere was before she was caught! The fish-poles were left behind; Toby\r\nwas trotted nearly off his legs in the chase; and every boy was red,\r\nbreathless, and scared. They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower\r\ngarden, where she had taken refuge, worn out with the long run.\r\nBorrowing a rope for a halter, Dan led her home, followed by a party\r\nof very sober young gentlemen, for the cow was in a sad state, having\r\nstrained her shoulder jumping, so that she limped, her eyes looked wild,\r\nand her glossy coat was wet and muddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll catch it this time, Dan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, as he led the wheezing\r\ndonkey beside the maltreated cow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo will you, for you helped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all did, but Demi,\xe2\x80\x9d added Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe put it into our heads,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you not to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, who was most broken-hearted at\r\npoor Buttercup's state.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Bhaer will send me off, I guess. Don't care if he does,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered\r\nDan, looking worried in spite of his words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll ask him not to, all of us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, and the others assented\r\nwith the exception of Stuffy, who cherished the hope that all the\r\npunishment might fall on one guilty head. Dan only said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't bother\r\nabout me;\xe2\x80\x9d but he never forgot it, even though he led the lads astray\r\nagain, as soon as the temptation came.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bhaer saw the animal, and heard the story, he said very little,\r\nevidently fearing that he should say too much in the first moments of\r\nimpatience. Buttercup was made comfortable in her stall, and the boys\r\nsent to their rooms till supper-time. This brief respite gave them time\r\nto think the matter over, to wonder what the penalty would be, and to\r\ntry to imagine where Dan would be sent. He whistled briskly in his room,\r\nso that no one should think he cared a bit; but while he waited to know\r\nhis fate, the longing to stay grew stronger and stronger, the more he\r\nrecalled the comfort and kindness he had known here, the hardship and\r\nneglect he had felt elsewhere. He knew they tried to help him, and at\r\nthe bottom of his heart he was grateful, but his rough life had made\r\nhim hard and careless, suspicious and wilful. He hated restraint of any\r\nsort, and fought against it like an untamed creature, even while he knew\r\nit was kindly meant, and dimly felt that he would be the better for it.\r\nHe made up his mind to be turned adrift again, to knock about the city\r\nas he had done nearly all his life; a prospect that made him knit\r\nhis black brows, and look about the cosy little room with a wistful\r\nexpression that would have touched a much harder heart than Mr. Bhaer's\r\nif he had seen it. It vanished instantly, however, when the good man\r\ncame in, and said in his accustomed grave way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard all about it, Dan, and though you have broken the rules\r\nagain, I am going to give you one more trial, to please Mother Bhaer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan flushed up to his forehead at this unexpected reprieve, but he only\r\nsaid in his gruff way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't know there was any rule about bull-fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I never expected to have any at Plumfield, I never did make such\r\na rule,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bhaer, smiling in spite of himself at the boy's\r\nexcuse. Then he added gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cBut one of the first and most important\r\nof our few laws is the law of kindness to every dumb creature on the\r\nplace. I want everybody and everything to be happy here, to love\r\nand trust, and serve us, as we try to love and trust and serve them\r\nfaithfully and willingly. I have often said that you were kinder to the\r\nanimals than any of the other boys, and Mrs. Bhaer liked that trait in\r\nyou very much, because she thought it showed a good heart. But you have\r\ndisappointed us in that, and we are sorry, for we hoped to make you\r\nquite one of us. Shall we try again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan's eyes had been on the floor, and his hands nervously picking at\r\nthe bit of wood he had been whittling as Mr. Bhaer came in, but when he\r\nheard the kind voice ask that question, he looked up quickly, and said\r\nin a more respectful tone than he had ever used before,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, we will say no more, only you will stay at home from\r\nthe walk to-morrow, as the other boys will and all of you must wait on\r\npoor Buttercup till she is well again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, go down to supper, and do your best, my boy, more for your own\r\nsake than for ours.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Mr. Bhaer shook hands with him, and Dan went\r\ndown more tamed by kindness than he would have been by the good whipping\r\nwhich Asia had strongly recommended.\r\n\r\nDan did try for a day or two, but not being used to it, he soon tired\r\nand relapsed into his old wilful ways. Mr. Bhaer was called from home\r\non business one day, and the boys had no lessons. They liked this, and\r\nplayed hard till bedtime, when most of them turned in and slept like\r\ndormice. Dan, however, had a plan in his head, and when he and Nat were\r\nalone, he unfolded it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking from under his bed a bottle, a cigar, and a\r\npack of cards, \xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to have some fun, and do as I used to with\r\nthe fellows in town. Here's some beer, I got if of the old man at the\r\nstation, and this cigar; you can pay for 'em or Tommy will, he's got\r\nheaps of money and I haven't a cent. I'm going to ask him in; no, you\r\ngo, they won't mind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe folks won't like it,\xe2\x80\x9d began Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won't know. Daddy Bhaer is away, and Mrs. Bhaer's busy with Ted;\r\nhe's got croup or something, and she can't leave him. We shan't sit up\r\nlate or make any noise, so where's the harm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsia will know if we burn the lamp long, she always does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she won't, I've got a dark lantern on purpose; it don't give much\r\nlight, and we can shut it quick if we hear anyone coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\nThis idea struck Nat as a fine one, and lent an air of romance to the\r\nthing. He started off to tell Tommy, but put his head in again to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want Demi, too, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't; the Deacon will rollup eyes and preach if you tell him. He\r\nwill be asleep, so just tip the wink to Tom and cut back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat obeyed, and returned in a minute with Tommy half dressed, rather\r\ntousled about the head and very sleepy, but quite ready for fun as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, keep quiet, and I'll show you how to play a first-rate game called\r\n'Poker,'\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, as the three revellers gathered round the table, on\r\nwhich were set forth the bottle, the cigar, and the cards. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst we'll\r\nall have a drink, then we'll take a go at the 'weed,' and then we'll\r\nplay. That's the way men do, and it's jolly fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beer circulated in a mug, and all three smacked their lips over it,\r\nthough Nat and Tommy did not like the bitter stuff. The cigar was worse\r\nstill, but they dared not say so, and each puffed away till he was dizzy\r\nor choked, when he passed the \xe2\x80\x9cweed\xe2\x80\x9d on to his neighbor. Dan liked\r\nit, for it seemed like old times when he now and then had a chance\r\nto imitate the low men who surrounded him. He drank, and smoked, and\r\nswaggered as much like them as he could, and, getting into the spirit\r\nof the part he assumed, he soon began to swear under his breath for\r\nfear some one should hear him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn't; it's wicked to say 'Damn!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Tommy, who had followed his leader so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, hang! don't you preach, but play away; it's part of the fun to\r\nswear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd rather say 'thunder turtles,'\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, who had composed this\r\ninteresting exclamation and was very proud of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I'll say 'The Devil;' that sounds well,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nat, much impressed\r\nby Dan's manly ways.\r\n\r\nDan scoffed at their \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d and swore stoutly as he tried to teach\r\nthem the new game.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy was very sleepy, and Nat's head began to ache with the beer\r\nand the smoke, so neither of them was very quick to learn, and the game\r\ndragged. The room was nearly dark, for the lantern burned badly; they\r\ncould not laugh loud nor move about much, for Silas slept next door in\r\nthe shed-chamber, and altogether the party was dull. In the middle of a\r\ndeal Dan stopped suddenly, and called out, \xe2\x80\x9cWho's that?\xe2\x80\x9d in a startled\r\ntone, and at the same moment drew the slide over the light. A voice in\r\nthe darkness said tremulously, \xe2\x80\x9cI can't find Tommy,\xe2\x80\x9d and then there was\r\nthe quick patter of bare feet running away down the entry that led from\r\nthe wing to the main house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Demi! he's gone to call some one; cut into bed, Tom, and don't\r\ntell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan, whisking all signs of the revel out of sight, and\r\nbeginning to tear off his clothes, while Nat did the same.\r\n\r\nTommy flew to his room and dived into bed, where he lay, laughing\r\ntill something burned his hand, when he discovered that he was still\r\nclutching the stump of the festive cigar, which he happened to be\r\nsmoking when the revel broke up.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly out, and he was about to extinguish it carefully when\r\nNursey's voice was heard, and fearing it would betray him if he hid it\r\nin the bed, he threw it underneath, after a final pinch which he thought\r\nfinished it.\r\n\r\nNursey came in with Demi, who looked much amazed to see the red face of\r\nTommy reposing peacefully upon his pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn't there just now, because I woke up and could not find him\r\nanywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, pouncing on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mischief are you at now, bad child?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nursey, with a\r\ngood-natured shake, which made the sleeper open his eyes to say meekly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only ran into Nat's room to see him about something. Go away, and let\r\nme alone; I'm awful sleepy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNursey tucked Demi in, and went off to reconnoitre, but only found two\r\nboys slumbering peacefully in Dan's room. \xe2\x80\x9cSome little frolic,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought, and as there was no harm done she said nothing to Mrs. Bhaer,\r\nwho was busy and worried over little Teddy.\r\n\r\nTommy was sleepy, and telling Demi to mind his own business and not ask\r\nquestions, he was snoring in ten minutes, little dreaming what was going\r\non under his bed. The cigar did not go out, but smouldered away on the\r\nstraw carpet till it was nicely on fire, and a hungry little flame went\r\ncreeping along till the dimity bedcover caught, then the sheets, and\r\nthen the bed itself. The beer made Tommy sleep heavily, and the smoke\r\nstupified Demi, so they slept on till the fire began to scorch them, and\r\nthey were in danger of being burned to death.\r\n\r\nFranz was sitting up to study, and as he left the school-room he smelt\r\nthe smoke, dashed up-stairs and saw it coming in a cloud from the left\r\nwing of the house. Without stopping to call any one, he ran into the\r\nroom, dragged the boys from the blazing bed, and splashed all the water\r\nhe could find at hand on to the flames. It checked but did not quench\r\nthe fire, and the children wakened on being tumbled topsy-turvy into\r\na cold hall, began to roar at the top of their voices. Mrs. Bhaer\r\ninstantly appeared, and a minute after Silas burst out of his room\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone that raised the whole house. A flock of\r\nwhite goblins with scared faces crowded into the hall, and for a minute\r\nevery one was panic-stricken.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Bhaer found her wits, bade Nursey see to the burnt boys, and\r\nsent Franz and Silas down-stairs for some tubs of wet clothes which\r\nshe flung on the bed, over the carpet, and up against the curtains, now\r\nburning finely, and threatening to kindle the walls.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys stood dumbly looking on, but Dan and Emil worked\r\nbravely, running to and fro with water from the bath-room, and helping\r\nto pull down the dangerous curtains.\r\n\r\nThe peril was soon over, and ordering the boys all back to bed, and\r\nleaving Silas to watch lest the fire broke out again, Mrs. Bhaer and\r\nFranz went to see how the poor boys got on. Demi had escaped with one\r\nburn and a grand scare, but Tommy had not only most of his hair scorched\r\noff his head, but a great burn on his arm, that made him half crazy with\r\nthe pain. Demi was soon made cosy, and Franz took him away to his own\r\nbed, where the kind lad soothed his fright and hummed him to sleep as\r\ncosily as a woman. Nursey watched over poor Tommy all night, trying to\r\nease his misery, and Mrs. Bhaer vibrated between him and little Teddy\r\nwith oil and cotton, paregoric and squills, saying to herself from time\r\nto time, as if she found great amusement in the thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI always knew\r\nTommy would set the house on fire, and now he has done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bhaer got home next morning he found a nice state of things.\r\nTommy in bed, Teddy wheezing like a little grampus, Mrs. Jo quite used\r\nup, and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once,\r\nand almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins. Under his quiet\r\nmanagement things soon fell into order, for every one felt that he was\r\nequal to a dozen conflagrations, and worked with a will at whatever task\r\nhe gave them.\r\n\r\nThere was no school that morning, but by afternoon the damaged room was\r\nput to rights, the invalids were better, and there was time to hear and\r\njudge the little culprits quietly. Nat and Tommy told their parts in the\r\nmischief, and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the\r\ndear old house and all in it. But Dan put on his devil-may-care look,\r\nand would not own that there was much harm done.\r\n\r\nNow, of all things, Mr. Bhaer hated drinking, gambling, and swearing;\r\nsmoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it,\r\nand it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy, with whom he\r\nhad tried to be most forbearing, should take advantage of his absence to\r\nintroduce these forbidden vices, and teach his innocent little lads\r\nto think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them. He talked long and\r\nearnestly to the assembled boys, and ended by saying, with an air of\r\nmingled firmness and regret,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Tommy is punished enough, and that scar on his arm will remind\r\nhim for a long time to let these things alone. Nat's fright will do for\r\nhim, for he is really sorry, and does try to obey me. But you, Dan, have\r\nbeen many times forgiven, and yet it does no good. I cannot have my boys\r\nhurt by your bad example, nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears, so\r\nyou can say good-bye to them all, and tell Nursey to put up your things\r\nin my little black bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! sir, where is he going?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a pleasant place up in the country, where I sometimes send boys when\r\nthey don't do well here. Mr. Page is a kind man, and Dan will be happy\r\nthere if he chooses to do his best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he ever come back?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will depend on himself; I hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page,\r\nand the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is\r\ngoing on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you'll like it,\xe2\x80\x9d began Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShan't stay if I don't,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan coolly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you go?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may go to sea, or out west, or take a look at California,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nDan, with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little\r\nboys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don't! stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here; do, Dan,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n pleaded Nat, much affected at the whole affair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care where I go, or how long I stay, and I'll be hanged if I\r\never come back here,\xe2\x80\x9d with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up\r\nhis things, every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him.\r\n\r\nThat was the only good-bye he gave the boys, for they were all talking\r\nthe matter over in the barn when he came down, and he told Nat not to\r\ncall them. The wagon stood at the door, and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak\r\nto Dan, looking so sad that his heart smote him, and he said in a low\r\ntone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I say good-bye to Teddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear; go in and kiss him, he will miss his Danny very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo one saw the look in Dan's eyes as he stooped over the crib, and saw\r\nthe little face light up at first sight of him, but he heard Mrs. Bhaer\r\nsay pleadingly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't we give the poor lad one more trial, Fritz?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer answer\r\nin his steady way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear, it is not best, so let him go where he can do no harm to\r\nothers, while they do good to him, and by and by he shall come back, I\r\npromise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's the only boy we ever failed with, and I am so grieved, for I\r\nthought there was the making of a fine man in him, spite of his faults.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh, and he wanted to ask for one more trial\r\nhimself, but his pride would not let him, and he came out with the hard\r\nlook on his face, shook hands without a word, and drove away with Mr.\r\nBhaer, leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page, saying that\r\nDan was doing well, whereat they all rejoiced. But three weeks later\r\ncame another letter, saying that Dan had run away, and nothing had been\r\nheard of him, whereat they all looked sober, and Mr. Bhaer said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I ought to have given him another chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer, however, nodded wisely and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't be troubled,\r\nFritz; the boy will come back to us, I'm sure of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut time went on and no Dan came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. NAUGHTY NAN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFritz, I've got a new idea,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bhaer, as she met her husband\r\none day after school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d and he waited willingly to hear the new\r\nplan, for some of Mrs. Jo's ideas were so droll, it was impossible to\r\nhelp laughing at them, though usually they were quite sensible, and he\r\nwas glad to carry them out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy needs a companion, and the boys would be all the better for\r\nanother girl among them; you know we believe in bringing up little men\r\nand women together, and it is high time we acted up to our belief. They\r\npet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns, and she is getting spoilt. Then\r\nthey must learn gentle ways, and improve their manners, and having girls\r\nabout will do it better than any thing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, as usual. Now, who shall we have?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer,\r\nseeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to\r\npropose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle Annie Harding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Naughty Nan, as the lads call her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bhaer, looking very\r\nmuch amused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she is running wild at home since her mother died, and is too\r\nbright a child to be spoilt by servants. I have had my eye on her for\r\nsome time, and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him\r\nwhy he did not send her to school. He said he would gladly if he could\r\nfind as good a school for girls as ours was for boys. I know he would\r\nrejoice to have her come; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and\r\nsee about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave not you cares enough now, my Jo, without this little gypsy to\r\ntorment you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer, patting the hand that lay on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mother Bhaer, briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cI like it, and never was\r\nhappier than since I had my wilderness of boys. You see, Fritz, I feel a\r\ngreat sympathy for Nan, because I was such a naughty child myself that\r\nI know all about it. She is full of spirits, and only needs to be taught\r\nwhat to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy. Those quick\r\nwits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed, and what\r\nis now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy, happy child. I know\r\nhow to manage her, for I remember how my blessed mother managed me,\r\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you succeed half as well as she did, you will have done a\r\nmagnificent work,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Bhaer, who labored under the delusion\r\nthat Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, if you make fun of my plan I'll give you bad coffee for a week,\r\nand then where are you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Jo, tweaking him by the ear\r\njust as if he was one of the boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't Daisy's hair stand erect with horror at Nan's wild ways?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMr. Bhaer, presently, when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat, and Rob\r\nup his back, for they always flew at their father the minute school was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first, perhaps, but it will do Posy good. She is getting prim and\r\nBettyish, and needs stirring up a bit. She always has a good time when\r\nNan comes over to play, and the two will help each other without knowing\r\nit. Dear me, half the science of teaching is knowing how much children\r\ndo for one another, and when to mix them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only hope she won't turn out another firebrand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Dan! I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n sighed Mrs. Bhaer.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the name, little Teddy, who had never forgotten his\r\nfriend, struggled down from his father's arms, and trotted to the door,\r\nlooked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face, and then trotted\r\nback again, saying, as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for\r\nsight,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Danny's tummin' soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really think we ought to have kept him, if only for Teddy's sake, he\r\nwas so fond of him, and perhaps baby's love would have done for him what\r\nwe failed to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've sometimes felt that myself; but after keeping the boys in a\r\nferment, and nearly burning up the whole family, I thought it safer to\r\nremove the firebrand, for a time at least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDinner's ready, let me ring the bell,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob began a solo upon that\r\ninstrument which made it impossible to hear one's self speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I may have Nan, may I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dozen Nans if you want them, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bhaer, who had\r\nroom in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon, before she could\r\nunpack the load of little boys, without whom she seldom moved, a small\r\ngirl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the\r\nhouse, shouting,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi, Daisy! where are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy came, and looked pleased to see her guest, but also a trifle\r\nalarmed, when Nan said, still prancing, as if it was impossible to keep\r\nstill,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to stay here always, papa says I may, and my box is coming\r\ntomorrow, all my things had to be washed and mended, and your aunt came\r\nand carried me off. Isn't it great fun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes. Did you bring your big doll?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy, hoping she had,\r\nfor on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house, and insisted on\r\nwashing Blanche Matilda's plaster face, which spoilt the poor dear's\r\ncomplexion for ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she's somewhere round,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Nan, with most unmaternal\r\ncarelessness. \xe2\x80\x9cI made you a ring coming along, and pulled the hairs out\r\nof Dobbin's tail. Don't you want it?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan presented a horse-hair\r\nring in token of friendship, as they had both vowed they would never\r\nspeak to one another again when they last parted.\r\n\r\nWon by the beauty of the offering, Daisy grew more cordial, and proposed\r\nretiring to the nursery, but Nan said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want to see the boys, and\r\nthe barn,\xe2\x80\x9d and ran off, swinging her hat by one string till it broke,\r\nwhen she left it to its fate on the grass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo! Nan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boys as she bounced in among them with the\r\nannouncement,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Tommy from the wall on which he was perched, for Nan\r\nwas a kindred spirit, and he foresaw \xe2\x80\x9clarks\xe2\x80\x9d in the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bat; let me play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who could turn her hand to any\r\nthing, and did not mind hard knocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ain't playing now, and our side beat without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can beat you in running, any way,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Nan, falling back on her\r\nstrong point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan she?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat of Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe runs very well for a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jack, who looked down upon Nan\r\nwith condescending approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you try?\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, longing to display her powers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's too hot,\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy languished against the wall as if quite\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the matter with Stuffy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, whose quick eyes were roving\r\nfrom face to face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBall hurt his hand; he howls at every thing,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jack scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't, I never cry, no matter how I'm hurt; it's babyish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan,\r\nloftily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! I could make you cry in two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Stuffy, rousing\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee if you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and pick that bunch of nettles, then,\xe2\x80\x9d and Stuffy pointed to a\r\nsturdy specimen of that prickly plant growing by the wall.\r\n\r\nNan instantly \xe2\x80\x9cgrasped the nettle,\xe2\x80\x9d pulled it up, and held it with a\r\ndefiant gesture, in spite of the almost unbearable sting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boys, quick to acknowledge courage even in one\r\nof the weaker sex.\r\n\r\nMore nettled than she was, Stuffy determined to get a cry out of her\r\nsomehow, and he said tauntingly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are used to poking your hands into\r\nevery thing, so that isn't fair. Now go and bump your head real hard\r\nagainst the barn, and see if you don't howl then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, who hated cruelty.\r\n\r\nBut Nan was off, and running straight at the barn, she gave her head a\r\nblow that knocked her flat, and sounded like a battering-ram. Dizzy, but\r\nundaunted, she staggered up, saying stoutly, though her face was drawn\r\nwith pain,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat hurt, but I don't cry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy angrily; and Nan would have done it, but Nat\r\nheld her; and Tommy, forgetting the heat, flew at Stuffy like a little\r\ngame-cock, roaring out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop it, or I'll throw you over the barn!\xe2\x80\x9d and so shook and hustled\r\npoor Stuffy that for a minute he did not know whether he was on his head\r\nor his heels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me to,\xe2\x80\x9d was all he could say, when Tommy let him alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind if she did; it is awfully mean to hurt a little girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHo! I don't mind; I ain't a little girl, I'm older than you and Daisy;\r\nso now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, ungratefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't preach, Deacon, you bully Posy every day of your life,\xe2\x80\x9d called\r\nout the Commodore, who just then hove in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't hurt her; do I, Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi turned to his sister, who was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpooring\xe2\x80\x9d Nan's tingling hands, and recommending water for the purple\r\nlump rapidly developing itself on her forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the best boy in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d promptly answered Daisy; adding,\r\nas truth compelled her to do, \xe2\x80\x9cYou hurt me sometimes, but you don't mean\r\nto.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut away the bats and things, and mind what you are about, my hearties.\r\nNo fighting allowed aboard this ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, who rather lorded it\r\nover the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do, Madge Wildfire?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, as Nan came in with\r\nthe rest to supper. \xe2\x80\x9cGive the right hand, little daughter, and mind thy\r\nmanners,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as Nan offered him her left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor little hand! what has it been doing to get those blisters?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, drawing it from behind her back, where she had put it with a look\r\nwhich made him think she had been in mischief.\r\n\r\nBefore Nan could think of any excuse, Daisy burst out with the whole\r\nstory, during which Stuffy tried to hide his face in a bowl of bread and\r\nmilk. When the tale was finished, Mr. Bhaer looked down the long table\r\ntowards his wife, and said with a laugh in his eyes,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis rather belongs to your side of the house, so I won't meddle with\r\nit, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo knew what he meant, but she liked her little black sheep all the\r\nbetter for her pluck, though she only said in her soberest way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why I asked Nan to come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo plague me,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Stuffy, with his mouth full.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo help make little gentlemen of you, and I think you have shown that\r\nsome of you need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Stuffy retired into his bowl again, and did not emerge till Demi\r\nmade them all laugh by saying, in his slow wondering way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can she, when she's such a tomboy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's just it, she needs help as much as you, and I expect you set her\r\nan example of good manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she going to be a little gentleman too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe'd like it; wouldn't you, Nan?\xe2\x80\x9d added Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shouldn't; I hate boys!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan fiercely, for her hand still\r\nsmarted, and she began to think that she might have shown her courage in\r\nsome wiser way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you hate my boys, because they can be well-mannered, and\r\nmost agreeable when they choose. Kindness in looks and words and ways is\r\ntrue politeness, and any one can have it if they only try to treat other\r\npeople as they like to be treated themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer had addressed herself to Nan, but the boys nudged one\r\nanother, and appeared to take the hint, for that time at least, and\r\npassed the butter; said \xe2\x80\x9cplease,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthank you,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cyes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno,\r\nma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d with unusual elegance and respect. Nan said nothing, but kept\r\nherself quiet and refrained from tickling Demi, though strongly tempted\r\nto do so, because of the dignified airs he put on. She also appeared\r\nto have forgotten her hatred of boys, and played \xe2\x80\x9cI spy\xe2\x80\x9d with them till\r\ndark. Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candy-ball\r\nduring the game, which evidently sweetened her temper, for the last\r\nthing she said on going to bed was,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen my battledore and shuttle-cock comes, I'll let you all play with\r\n'em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer first remark in the morning was \xe2\x80\x9cHas my box come?\xe2\x80\x9d and when told\r\nthat it would arrive sometime during the day, she fretted and fumed, and\r\nwhipped her doll, till Daisy was shocked. She managed to exist, however,\r\ntill five o'clock, when she disappeared, and was not missed till\r\nsupper-time, because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with\r\nTommy and Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mary Ann, coming in with the hasty-pudding, and finding every one\r\nasking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Nan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has run home, little gypsy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Bhaer, looking anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Franz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible, she does not know the way, and if she found it, she\r\ncould never carry the box a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, beginning to think\r\nthat her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be like her,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find\r\nthe child, when a shout from Jack, who was at the window, made everyone\r\nhurry to the door.\r\n\r\nThere was Miss Nan, to be sure, tugging along a very large band-box tied\r\nup in linen bag. Very hot and dusty and tired did she look, but marched\r\nstoutly along, and came puffing up to the steps, where she dropped\r\nher load with a sigh of relief, and sat down upon it, observed as she\r\ncrossed her tired arms,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn't wait any longer, so I went and got it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did not know the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, while the rest stood round\r\nenjoying the joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I found it, I never get lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a mile, how could you go so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was pretty far, but I rested a good deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn't that thing very heavy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's so round, I couldn't get hold of it good, and I thought my arms\r\nwould break right off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't see how the station-master let you have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't say anything to him. He was in the little ticket place, and\r\ndidn't see me, so I just took it off the platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun down and tell him it is all right, Franz, or old Dodd will think\r\nit is stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, joining in the shout of laughter at Nan's\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you we would send for it if it did not come. Another time you\r\nmust wait, for you will get into trouble if you run away. Promise me\r\nthis, or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBhaer, wiping the dust off Nan's little hot face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I won't, only papa tells me not to put off doing things, so I\r\ndon't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is rather a poser; I think you had better give her some supper\r\nnow, and a private lecture by and by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, too much amused\r\nto be angry at the young lady's exploit.\r\n\r\nThe boys thought it \xe2\x80\x9cgreat fun,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan entertained them all\r\nsupper-time with an account of her adventures; for a big dog had barked\r\nat her, a man had laughed at her, a woman had given her a doughnut, and\r\nher hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink, exhausted\r\nwith her exertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy you will have your hands full now, my dear; Tommy and Nan are\r\nquite enough for one woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, half an hour later.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it will take some time to tame the child, but she is such a\r\ngenerous, warm-hearted little thing, I should love her even if she were\r\ntwice as naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Jo, pointing to the merry group, in\r\nthe middle of which stood Nan, giving away her things right and left, as\r\nlavishly as if the big band-box had no bottom.\r\n\r\nIt was those good traits that soon made little \xe2\x80\x9cGiddygaddy,\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\ncalled her, a favorite with every one. Daisy never complained of being\r\ndull again, for Nan invented the most delightful plays, and her pranks\r\nrivalled Tommy's, to the amusement of the whole school. She buried her\r\nbig doll and forgot it for a week, and found it well mildewed when she\r\ndragged it up. Daisy was in despair, but Nan took it to the painter who\r\nas at work about the house, got him to paint it brick red, with staring\r\nblack eyes, then she dressed it up with feathers, and scarlet flannel,\r\nand one of Ned's leaden hatchets; and in the character of an Indian\r\nchief, the late Poppydilla tomahawked all the other dolls, and caused\r\nthe nursery to run red with imaginary gore. She gave away her new shoes\r\nto a beggar child, hoping to be allowed to go barefoot, but found it\r\nimpossible to combine charity and comfort, and was ordered to ask leave\r\nbefore disposing of her clothes. She delighted the boys by making a\r\nfire-ship out of a shingle with two large sails wet with turpentine,\r\nwhich she lighted, and then sent the little vessel floating down the\r\nbrook at dusk. She harnessed the old turkey-cock to a straw wagon, and\r\nmade him trot round the house at a tremendous pace. She gave her coral\r\nnecklace for four unhappy kittens, which had been tormented by some\r\nheartless lads, and tended them for days as gently as a mother, dressing\r\ntheir wounds with cold cream, feeding them with a doll's spoon, and\r\nmourning over them when they died, till she was consoled by one of\r\nDemi's best turtles. She made Silas tattoo an anchor on her arm like\r\nhis, and begged hard to have a blue star on each cheek, but he dared not\r\ndo it, though she coaxed and scolded till the soft-hearted fellow longed\r\nto give in. She rode every animal on the place, from the big horse Andy\r\nto the cross pig, from whom she was rescued with difficulty. Whatever\r\nthe boys dared her to do she instantly attempted, no matter how\r\ndangerous it might be, and they were never tired of testing her courage.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer suggested that they should see who would study best, and Nan\r\nfound as much pleasure in using her quick wits and fine memory as her\r\nactive feet and merry tongue, while the lads had to do their best to\r\nkeep their places, for Nan showed them that girls could do most things\r\nas well as boys, and some things better. There were no rewards in\r\nschool, but Mr. Bhaer's \xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Bhaer's good report on the\r\nconscience book, taught them to love duty for its own sake, and try to\r\ndo it faithfully, sure sooner or later the recompense would come. Little\r\nNan was quick to feel the new atmosphere, to enjoy it, to show that it\r\nwas what she needed; for this little garden was full of sweet flowers,\r\nhalf hidden by the weeds; and when kind hands gently began to\r\ncultivate it, all sorts of green shoots sprung up, promising to blossom\r\nbeautifully in the warmth of love and care, the best climate for young\r\nhearts and souls all the world over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. PRANKS AND PLAYS\r\n\r\nAs there is no particular plan to this story, except to describe a few\r\nscenes in the life at Plumfield for the amusement of certain little\r\npersons, we will gently ramble along in this chapter and tell some of\r\nthe pastimes of Mrs. Jo's boys. I beg leave to assure my honored readers\r\nthat most of the incidents are taken from real life, and that the oddest\r\nare the truest; for no person, no matter how vivid an imagination he may\r\nhave, can invent anything half so droll as the freaks and fancies that\r\noriginate in the lively brains of little people.\r\n\r\nDaisy and Demi were full of these whims, and lived in a world of their\r\nown, peopled with lovely or grotesque creatures, to whom they gave the\r\nqueerest names, and with whom they played the queerest games. One of\r\nthese nursery inventions was an invisible sprite called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Naughty\r\nKitty-mouse,\xe2\x80\x9d whom the children had believed in, feared, and served for\r\na long time. They seldom spoke of it to any one else, kept their rites\r\nas private as possible; and, as they never tried to describe it even to\r\nthemselves, this being had a vague mysterious charm very agreeable\r\nto Demi, who delighted in elves and goblins. A most whimsical and\r\ntyrannical imp was the Naughty Kitty-mouse, and Daisy found a fearful\r\npleasure in its service, blindly obeying its most absurd demands, which\r\nwere usually proclaimed from the lips of Demi, whose powers of invention\r\nwere great. Rob and Teddy sometimes joined in these ceremonies, and\r\nconsidered them excellent fun, although they did not understand half\r\nthat went on.\r\n\r\nOne day after school Demi whispered to his sister, with an ominous wag\r\nof the head,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kitty-mouse wants us this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sackerryfice,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Demi, solemnly. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a fire behind\r\nthe big rock at two o'clock, and we must all bring the things we like\r\nbest, and burn them!\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with an awful emphasis on the last\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! I love the new paper dollies Aunt Amy painted for me best\r\nof any thing; must I burn them up?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, who never thought of\r\ndenying the unseen tyrant any thing it demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one. I shall burn my boat, my best scrapbook, and all my\r\nsoldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi firmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will; but it's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest\r\nthings,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of, so we must,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n explained Demi, to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing\r\nUncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were\r\nreading about them in school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Rob coming too,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he is going to bring his toy village; it is all made of wood,\r\nyou know, and will burn nicely. We'll have a grand bonfire, and see them\r\nblaze up, won't we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brilliant prospect consoled Daisy, and she ate her dinner with a\r\nrow of paper dolls before her, as a sort of farewell banquet.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth, each child\r\nbearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse. Teddy\r\ninsisted on going also, and seeing that all the others had toys, he\r\ntucked a squeaking lamb under one arm, and old Annabella under the\r\nother, little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going, my chickens?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo, as the flock passed\r\nher door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo play by the big rock; can't we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, only don't do near the pond, and take good care of baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, leading forth her charge with a capable air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you must all sit round, and not move till I tell you. This flat\r\nstone is an altar, and I am going to make a fire on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDemi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze, as he had seen the boys\r\ndo at picnics. When the flame burned well, he ordered the company to\r\nmarch round it three times and then stand in a circle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall begin, and as fast as my things are burnt, you must bring\r\nyours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures,\r\npasted in by himself; this was followed by a dilapidated boat, and\r\nthen one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death. Not one\r\nfaltered or hung back, from the splendid red and yellow captain to the\r\nsmall drummer who had lost his legs; all vanished in the flames and\r\nmingled in one common pool of melted lead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Daisy!\xe2\x80\x9d called the high priest of Kitty-mouse, when his rich\r\nofferings had been consumed, to the great satisfaction of the children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear dollies, how can I let them go?\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Daisy, hugging the\r\nentire dozen with a face full of maternal woe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must,\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Demi; and with a farewell kiss to each, Daisy laid\r\nher blooming dolls upon the coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me keep one, the dear blue thing, she is so sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d besought the\r\npoor little mamma, clutching her last in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore! more!\xe2\x80\x9d growled an awful voice, and Demi cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's the\r\nKitty-mouse! she must have every one, quick, or she will scratch us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn went the precious blue belle, flounces, rosy hat, and all, and\r\nnothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand the houses and trees round, and let them catch themselves; it\r\nwill be like a real fire then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who liked variety even in his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csackerryfices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCharmed by this suggestion, the children arranged the doomed village,\r\nlaid a line of coals along the main street, and then sat down to watch\r\nthe conflagration. It was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint,\r\nbut at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up, fired a tree of the\r\npalm species, which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion,\r\nand in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily. The wooden\r\npopulation stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads, as they\r\nwere, till they also caught and blazed away without a cry. It took\r\nsome time to reduce the town to ashes, and the lookers-on enjoyed the\r\nspectacle immensely, cheering as each house fell, dancing like wild\r\nIndians when the steeple flamed aloft, and actually casting one wretched\r\nlittle churn-shaped lady, who had escaped to the suburbs, into the very\r\nheart of the fire.\r\n\r\nThe superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a degree,\r\nthat he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and before it had\r\ntime even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre. Of\r\ncourse she did not like it, and expressed her anguish and resentment in\r\na way that terrified her infant destroyer. Being covered with kid,\r\nshe did not blaze, but did what was worse, she squirmed. First one leg\r\ncurled up, then the other, in a very awful and lifelike manner; next\r\nshe flung her arms over her head as if in great agony; her head itself\r\nturned on her shoulders, her glass eyes fell out, and with one final\r\nwrithe of her whole body, she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins\r\nof the town. This unexpected demonstration startled every one and\r\nfrightened Teddy half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed\r\nand fled toward the house, roaring \xe2\x80\x9cMarmar\xe2\x80\x9d at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue, but Teddy could only\r\ncling to her and pour out in his broken way something about \xe2\x80\x9cpoor Bella\r\nhurted,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca dreat fire,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9call the dollies dorn.\xe2\x80\x9d Fearing some dire\r\nmishap, his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action,\r\nwhere she found the blind worshippers of Kitty-mouse mourning over the\r\ncharred remains of the lost darling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been at? Tell me all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, composing\r\nherself to listen patiently, for the culprits looked so penitent, she\r\nforgave them beforehand.\r\n\r\nWith some reluctance Demi explained their play, and Aunt Jo laughed till\r\nthe tears ran down her cheeks, the children were so solemn, and the play\r\nwas so absurd.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this. If\r\nI had any Kitty-mouse I'd have a good one who liked you to play in safe\r\npleasant ways, and not destroy and frighten. Just see what a ruin you\r\nhave made; all Daisy's pretty dolls, Demi's soldiers, and Rob's new\r\nvillage beside poor Teddy's pet lamb, and dear old Annabella. I shall\r\nhave to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes\r\nof toys,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe children of Holland take pleasure in making,\r\n     What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never will again, truly, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the repentant little sinners,\r\nmuch abashed at this reproof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi told us to,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people, who had altars\r\nand things, and so I wanted to be like them, only I hadn't any live\r\ncreatures to sackerryfice, so we burnt up our toys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, that is something like the bean story,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, laughing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about it,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Daisy, to change the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce there was a poor woman who had three or four little children, and\r\nshe used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work, to keep\r\nthem safe. On day when she was going away she said, 'Now, my dears,\r\ndon't let baby fall out of window, don't play with the matches, and\r\ndon't put beans up your noses.' Now the children had never dreamed of\r\ndoing that last thing, but she put it into their heads, and the minute\r\nshe was gone, they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of\r\nbeans, just to see how it felt, and she found them all crying when she\r\ncame home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid it hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, with such intense interest that his mother\r\nhastily added a warning sequel, lest a new edition of the bean story\r\nshould appear in her own family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, as I know, for when my mother told me this story, I was so\r\nsilly that I went and tried it myself. I had no beans, so I took some\r\nlittle pebbles, and poked several into my nose. I did not like it at\r\nall, and wanted to take them out again very soon, but one would not\r\ncome, and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been that I went for\r\nhours with the stone hurting me very much. At last the pain got so bad\r\nI had to tell, and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came.\r\nThen I was put in a chair and held tight, Rob, while he used his ugly\r\nlittle pincers till the stone hopped out. Dear me! how my wretched\r\nlittle nose did ache, and how people laughed at me!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo shook\r\nher head in a dismal way, as if the memory of her sufferings was too\r\nmuch for her.\r\n\r\nRob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the warning to\r\nheart. Demi proposed that they should bury poor Annabella, and in the\r\ninterest of the funeral Teddy forgot his fright. Daisy was soon consoled\r\nby another batch of dolls from Aunt Amy, and the Naughty Kitty-mouse\r\nseemed to be appeased by the last offerings, for she tormented them no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrops\xe2\x80\x9d was the name of a new and absorbing play, invented by Bangs.\r\nAs this interesting animal is not to be found in any Zoological Garden,\r\nunless Du Chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of Africa, I\r\nwill mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits, for the benefit of\r\ninquiring minds. The Brop is a winged quadruped, with a human face of\r\na youthful and merry aspect. When it walks the earth it grunts, when it\r\nsoars it gives a shrill hoot, occasionally it goes erect, and talks good\r\nEnglish. Its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a\r\nshawl, sometimes red, sometimes blue, often plaid, and, strange to say,\r\nthey frequently change skins with one another. On their heads they have\r\na horn very like a stiff brown paper lamp-lighter. Wings of the same\r\nsubstance flap upon their shoulders when they fly; this is never very\r\nfar from the ground, as they usually fall with violence if they attempt\r\nany lofty flights. They browse over the earth, but can sit up and eat\r\nlike the squirrel. Their favorite nourishment is the seed-cake; apples\r\nalso are freely taken, and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food\r\nis scarce. They live in dens, where they have a sort of nest, much like\r\na clothes-basket, in which the little Brops play till their wings are\r\ngrown. These singular animals quarrel at times, and it is on these\r\noccasions that they burst into human speech, call each other names, cry,\r\nscold, and sometimes tear off horns and skin, declaring fiercely that\r\nthey \xe2\x80\x9cwon't play.\xe2\x80\x9d The few privileged persons who have studied them are\r\ninclined to think them a remarkable mixture of the monkey, the sphinx,\r\nthe roc, and the queer creatures seen by the famous Peter Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThis game was a great favorite, and the younger children beguiled many\r\na rainy afternoon flapping or creeping about the nursery, acting like\r\nlittle bedlamites and being as merry as little grigs. To be sure, it was\r\nrather hard upon clothes, particularly trouser-knees, and jacket-elbows;\r\nbut Mrs. Bhaer only said, as she patched and darned,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do things just as foolish, and not half so harmless. If I could\r\nget as much happiness out of it as the little dears do, I'd be a Brop\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat's favorite amusements were working in his garden, and sitting in the\r\nwillow-tree with his violin, for that green nest was a fairy world to\r\nhim, and there he loved to perch, making music like a happy bird. The\r\nlads called him \xe2\x80\x9cOld Chirper,\xe2\x80\x9d because he was always humming, whistling,\r\nor fiddling, and they often stopped a minute in their work or play to\r\nlisten to the soft tones of the violin, which seemed to lead a little\r\norchestra of summer sounds. The birds appeared to regard him as one of\r\nthemselves, and fearlessly sat on the fence or lit among the boughs to\r\nwatch him with their quick bright eyes. The robins in the apple-tree\r\nnear by evidently considered him a friend, for the father bird hunted\r\ninsects close beside him, and the little mother brooded as confidingly\r\nover her blue eggs as if the boy was only a new sort of blackbird who\r\ncheered her patient watch with his song. The brown brook babbled and\r\nsparkled below him, the bees haunted the clover fields on either side,\r\nfriendly faces peeped at him as they passed, the old house stretched its\r\nwide wings hospitably toward him, and with a blessed sense of rest and\r\nlove and happiness, Nat dreamed for hours in this nook, unconscious what\r\nhealthful miracles were being wrought upon him.\r\n\r\nOne listener he had who never tired, and to whom he was more than a\r\nmere schoolmate. Poor Billy's chief delight was to lie beside the brook,\r\nwatching leaves and bits of foam dance by, listening dreamily to the\r\nmusic in the willow-tree. He seemed to think Nat a sort of angel who sat\r\naloft and sang, for a few baby memories still lingered in his mind and\r\nseemed to grow brighter at these times. Seeing the interest he took in\r\nNat, Mr. Bhaer begged him to help them lift the cloud from the feeble\r\nbrain by this gentle spell. Glad to do any thing to show his gratitude,\r\nNat always smiled on Billy when he followed him about, and let him\r\nlisten undisturbed to the music which seemed to speak a language he\r\ncould understand. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp one another,\xe2\x80\x9d was a favorite Plumfield motto,\r\nand Nat learned how much sweetness is added to life by trying to live up\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nJack Ford's peculiar pastime was buying and selling; and he bid fair\r\nto follow in the footsteps of his uncle, a country merchant, who sold\r\na little of every thing and made money fast. Jack had seen the sugar\r\nsanded, the molasses watered, the butter mixed with lard, and things of\r\nthat kind, and labored under the delusion that it was all a proper part\r\nof the business. His stock in trade was of a different sort, but he made\r\nas much as he could out of every worm he sold, and always got the\r\nbest of the bargain when he traded with the boys for string, knives,\r\nfish-hooks, or whatever the article might be. The boys who all had\r\nnicknames, called him \xe2\x80\x9cSkinflint,\xe2\x80\x9d but Jack did not care as long as the\r\nold tobacco-pouch in which he kept his money grew heavier and heavier.\r\n\r\nHe established a sort of auction-room, and now and then sold off all the\r\nodds and ends he had collected, or helped the lads exchange things with\r\none another. He got bats, balls, hockey-sticks, etc., cheap, from one\r\nset of mates, furbished them up, and let them for a few cents a time to\r\nanother set, often extending his business beyond the gates of Plumfield\r\nin spite of the rules. Mr. Bhaer put a stop to some of his speculations,\r\nand tried to give him a better idea of business talent than mere\r\nsharpness in overreaching his neighbors. Now and then Jack made a bad\r\nbargain, and felt worse about it than about any failure in lessons or\r\nconduct, and took his revenge on the next innocent customer who came\r\nalong. His account-book was a curiosity; and his quickness at figures\r\nquite remarkable. Mr. Bhaer praised him for this, and tried to make his\r\nsense of honesty and honor as quick; and, by and by, when Jack found\r\nthat he could not get on without these virtues, he owned that his\r\nteacher was right.\r\n\r\nCricket and football the boys had of course; but, after the stirring\r\naccounts of these games in the immortal \xe2\x80\x9cTom Brown at Rugby,\xe2\x80\x9d no feeble\r\nfemale pen may venture to do more than respectfully allude to them.\r\n\r\nEmil spent his holidays on the river or the pond, and drilled the elder\r\nlads for a race with certain town boys, who now and then invaded\r\ntheir territory. The race duly came off, but as it ended in a general\r\nshipwreck, it was not mentioned in public; and the Commodore had serious\r\nthoughts of retiring to a desert island, so disgusted was he with his\r\nkind for a time. No desert island being convenient, he was forced\r\nto remain among his friends, and found consolation in building a\r\nboat-house.\r\n\r\nThe little girls indulged in the usual plays of their age, improving\r\nupon them somewhat as their lively fancies suggested. The chief and\r\nmost absorbing play was called \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Shakespeare Smith;\xe2\x80\x9d the name\r\nwas provided by Aunt Jo, but the trials of the poor lady were quite\r\noriginal. Daisy was Mrs. S. S., and Nan by turns her daughter or a\r\nneighbor, Mrs. Giddygaddy.\r\n\r\nNo pen can describe the adventures of these ladies, for in one short\r\nafternoon their family was the scene of births, marriages, deaths,\r\nfloods, earthquakes, tea-parties, and balloon ascensions. Millions of\r\nmiles did these energetic women travel, dressed in hats and habits never\r\nseen before by mortal eye, perched on the bed, driving the posts like\r\nmettlesome steeds, and bouncing up and down till their heads spun. Fits\r\nand fires were the pet afflictions, with a general massacre now and then\r\nby way of change. Nan was never tired of inventing fresh combinations,\r\nand Daisy followed her leader with blind admiration. Poor Teddy was a\r\nfrequent victim, and was often rescued from real danger, for the excited\r\nladies were apt to forget that he was not of the same stuff their\r\nlongsuffering dolls. Once he was shut into the closet for a dungeon, and\r\nforgotten by the girls, who ran off to some out-of-door game. Another\r\ntime he was half drowned in the bath-tub, playing be a \xe2\x80\x9ccunning little\r\nwhale.\xe2\x80\x9d And, worst of all, he was cut down just in time after being hung\r\nup for a robber.\r\n\r\nBut the institution most patronized by all was the Club. It had no other\r\nname, and it needed none, being the only one in the neighborhood. The\r\nelder lads got it up, and the younger were occasionally admitted if\r\nthey behaved well. Tommy and Demi were honorary members, but were always\r\nobliged to retire unpleasantly early, owing to circumstances over\r\nwhich they had no control. The proceedings of this club were somewhat\r\npeculiar, for it met at all sorts of places and hours, had all manner\r\nof queer ceremonies and amusements, and now and then was broken up\r\ntempestuously, only to be re-established, however, on a firmer basis.\r\n\r\nRainy evenings the members met in the schoolroom, and passed the time in\r\ngames: chess, morris, backgammon, fencing matches, recitations, debates,\r\nor dramatic performances of a darkly tragical nature. In summer the barn\r\nwas the rendezvous, and what went on there no uninitiated mortal\r\nknows. On sultry evenings the Club adjourned to the brook for aquatic\r\nexercises, and the members sat about in airy attire, frog-like and cool.\r\nOn such occasions the speeches were unusually eloquent, quite flowing,\r\nas one might say; and if any orator's remarks displeased the audience,\r\ncold water was thrown upon him till his ardor was effectually quenched.\r\nFranz was president, and maintained order admirably, considering the\r\nunruly nature of the members. Mr. Bhaer never interfered with their\r\naffairs, and was rewarded for this wise forbearance by being invited now\r\nand then to behold the mysteries unveiled, which he appeared to enjoy\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nWhen Nan came she wished to join the Club, and caused great excitement\r\nand division among the gentlemen by presenting endless petitions, both\r\nwritten and spoken, disturbing their solemnities by insulting them\r\nthrough the key-hole, performing vigorous solos on the door, and\r\nwriting up derisive remarks on walls and fences, for she belonged to\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cIrrepressibles.\xe2\x80\x9d Finding these appeals in vain, the girls, by the\r\nadvice of Mrs. Jo, got up an institution of their own, which they called\r\nthe Cosy Club. To this they magnanimously invited the gentlemen whose\r\nyouth excluded them from the other one, and entertained these favored\r\nbeings so well with little suppers, new games devised by Nan, and other\r\npleasing festivities, that, one by one, the elder boys confessed a\r\ndesire to partake of these more elegant enjoyments, and, after much\r\nconsultation, finally decided to propose an interchange of civilities.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Cosy Club were invited to adorn the rival\r\nestablishment on certain evenings, and to the surprise of the gentlemen\r\ntheir presence was not found to be a restraint upon the conversation\r\nor amusement of the regular frequenters; which could not be said of all\r\nClubs, I fancy. The ladies responded handsomely and hospitably to these\r\novertures of peace, and both institutions flourished long and happily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. DAISY'S BALL\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Shakespeare Smith would like to have Mr. John Brooke, Mr. Thomas\r\nBangs, and Mr. Nathaniel Blake to come to her ball at three o'clock\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S. Nat must bring his fiddle, so we can dance, and all the boys must\r\nbe good, or they cannot have any of the nice things we have cooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis elegant invitation would, I fear, have been declined, but for the\r\nhint given in the last line of the postscript.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been cooking lots of goodies, I smelt 'em. Let's go,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nTommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe needn't stay after the feast, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d added Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never went to a ball. What do you have to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we just play be men, and sit round stiff and stupid like grown-up\r\nfolks, and dance to please the girls. Then we eat up everything, and\r\ncome away as soon as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could do that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, after considering Tommy's\r\ndescription for a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll write and say we'll come;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi despatched the following\r\ngentlemanly reply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will all come. Please have lots to eat. J. B. Esquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGreat was the anxiety of the ladies about their first ball, because if\r\nevery thing went well they intended to give a dinner-party to the chosen\r\nfew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Jo likes to have the boys play with us, if they are not rough;\r\nso we must make them like our balls, then they will do them good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDaisy, with her maternal air, as she set the table and surveyed the\r\nstore of refreshments with an anxious eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi and Nat will be good, but Tommy will do something bad, I know he\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Nan, shaking her head over the little cake-basket which\r\nshe was arranging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I shall send him right home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, with decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople don't do so at parties, it isn't proper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never ask him any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would do. He'd be sorry not to come to the dinner-ball, wouldn't\r\nhe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess he would! we'll have the splendidest things ever seen, won't\r\nwe? Real soup with a ladle and a tureem [she meant tureen] and a little\r\nbird for turkey, and gravy, and all kinds of nice vegytubbles.\xe2\x80\x9d Daisy\r\nnever could say vegetables properly, and had given up trying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is 'most three, and we ought to dress,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who had arranged a\r\nfine costume for the occasion, and was anxious to wear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the mother, so I shan't dress up much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, putting on a\r\nnight-cap ornamented with a red bow, one of her aunt's long skirts, and\r\na shawl; a pair of spectacles and large pocket handkerchief completed\r\nher toilette, making a plump, rosy little matron of her.\r\n\r\nNan had a wreath of artificial flowers, a pair of old pink slippers, a\r\nyellow scarf, a green muslin skirt, and a fan made of feathers from the\r\nduster; also, as a last touch of elegance, a smelling-bottle without any\r\nsmell in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the daughter, so I rig up a good deal, and I must sing and dance,\r\nand talk more than you do. The mothers only get the tea and be proper,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sudden very loud knock caused Miss Smith to fly into a chair, and fan\r\nherself violently, while her mamma sat bolt upright on the sofa, and\r\ntried to look quite calm and \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d Little Bess, who was on a visit,\r\nacted the part of maid, and opened the door, saying with a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cWart\r\nin, gemplemun; it's all weady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn honor of the occasion, the boys wore high paper collars, tall\r\nblack hats, and gloves of every color and material, for they were an\r\nafterthought, and not a boy among them had a perfect pair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, in a deep voice, which was so hard to keep\r\nup that his remarks had to be extremely brief.\r\n\r\nEvery one shook hands and then sat down, looking so funny, yet so sober,\r\nthat the gentlemen forgot their manners, and rolled in their chairs with\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don't!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Smith, much distressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't ever come again if you act so,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Smith, rapping Mr.\r\nBangs with her bottle because he laughed loudest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't help it, you look so like fury,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Mr. Bangs, with most\r\nuncourteous candor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do you, but I shouldn't be so rude as to say so. He shan't come to\r\nthe dinner-ball, shall he, Daisy?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better dance now. Did you bring your fiddle, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMrs. Smith, trying to preserve her polite composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is outside the door,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat went to get it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter have tea first,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed the unabashed Tommy, winking openly\r\nat Demi to remind him that the sooner the refreshments were secured, the\r\nsooner they could escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we never have supper first; and if you don't dance well you won't\r\nhave any supper at all, not one bit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Smith, so sternly\r\nthat her wild guests saw she was not to be trifled with, and grew\r\noverwhelmingly civil all at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will take Mr. Bangs and teach him the polka, for he does not know it\r\nfit to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d added the hostess, with a reproachful look that sobered\r\nTommy at once.\r\n\r\nNat struck up, and the ball opened with two couples, who went\r\nconscientiously through a somewhat varied dance. The ladies did well,\r\nbecause they liked it, but the gentlemen exerted themselves from more\r\nselfish motives, for each felt that he must earn his supper, and labored\r\nmanfully toward that end. When every one was out of breath they were\r\nallowed to rest; and, indeed, poor Mrs. Smith needed it, for her long\r\ndress had tripped her up many times. The little maid passed round\r\nmolasses and water in such small cups that one guest actually emptied\r\nnine. I refrain from mentioning his name, because this mild beverage\r\naffected him so much that he put cup and all into his mouth at the ninth\r\nround, and choked himself publicly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask Nan to play and sing now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy to her brother, who\r\nsat looking very much like an owl, as he gravely regarded the festive\r\nscene between his high collars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us a song, mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said the obedient guest, secretly wondering where\r\nthe piano was.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith sailed up to an old secretary which stood in the room,\r\nthrew back the lid of the writing-desk, and sitting down before it,\r\naccompanied herself with a vigor which made the old desk rattle as she\r\nsang that new and lovely song, beginning\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cGaily the troubadour\r\n     Touched his guitar,\r\n     As he was hastening\r\n     Home from the war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen applauded so enthusiastically that she gave them \xe2\x80\x9cBounding\r\nBillows,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bo-Peep,\xe2\x80\x9d and other gems of song, till they were\r\nobliged to hint that they had had enough. Grateful for the praises\r\nbestowed upon her daughter, Mrs. Smith graciously announced,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will have tea. Sit down carefully, and don't grab.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful to see the air of pride with which the good lady did\r\nthe honors of her table, and the calmness with which she bore the little\r\nmishaps that occurred. The best pie flew wildly on the floor when she\r\ntried to cut it with a very dull knife; the bread and butter vanished\r\nwith a rapidity calculated to dismay a housekeeper's soul; and, worst of\r\nall, the custards were so soft that they had to be drunk up, instead of\r\nbeing eaten elegantly with the new tin spoons.\r\n\r\nI grieve to state that Miss Smith squabbled with the maid for the best\r\njumble, which caused Bess to toss the whole dish into the air, and burst\r\nout crying amid a rain of falling cakes. She was comforted by a seat at\r\nthe table, and the sugar-bowl to empty; but during this flurry a large\r\nplate of patties was mysteriously lost, and could not be found. They\r\nwere the chief ornament of the feast, and Mrs. Smith was indignant at\r\nthe loss, for she had made them herself, and they were beautiful to\r\nbehold. I put it to any lady if it was not hard to have one dozen\r\ndelicious patties (made of flour, salt, and water, with a large raisin\r\nin the middle of each, and much sugar over the whole) swept away at one\r\nfell swoop?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hid them, Tommy; I know you did!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the outraged hostess,\r\nthreatening her suspected guest with the milk-pot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't proper to contradict,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who was hastily eating up the\r\njelly during the fray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive them back, Demi,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's a fib, you've got them in your own pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Demi, roused\r\nby the false accusation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's take 'em away from him. It's too bad to make Daisy cry,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n suggested Nat, who found his first ball more exciting than he expected.\r\n\r\nDaisy was already weeping, Bess like a devoted servant mingled her tears\r\nwith those of her mistress, and Nan denounced the entire race of boys as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplaguey things.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile the battle raged among the gentlemen, for,\r\nwhen the two defenders of innocence fell upon the foe, that hardened\r\nyouth intrenched himself behind a table and pelted them with the stolen\r\ntarts, which were very effective missiles, being nearly as hard as\r\nbullets. While his ammunition held out the besieged prospered, but the\r\nmoment the last patty flew over the parapet, the villain was seized,\r\ndragged howling from the room, and cast upon the hall floor in an\r\nignominious heap. The conquerors then returned flushed with victory, and\r\nwhile Demi consoled poor Mrs. Smith, Nat and Nan collected the scattered\r\ntarts, replaced each raisin in its proper bed, and rearranged the dish\r\nso that it really looked almost as well as ever. But their glory had\r\ndeparted, for the sugar was gone, and no one cared to eat them after the\r\ninsult offered to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess we had better go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, suddenly, as Aunt Jo's voice was\r\nheard on the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP'r'aps we had,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat hastily dropped a stray jumble that he had\r\njust picked up.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Jo was among them before the retreat was accomplished, and into\r\nher sympathetic ear the young ladies poured the story of their woes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more balls for these boys till they have atoned for this bad\r\nbehavior by doing something kind to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, shaking her head\r\nat the three culprits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were only in fun,\xe2\x80\x9d began Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't like fun that makes other people unhappy. I am disappointed in\r\nyou, Demi, for I hoped you would never learn to tease Daisy. Such a kind\r\nlittle sister as she is to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys always tease their sisters; Tom says so,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't intend that my boys shall, and I must send Daisy home if you\r\ncannot play happily together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, soberly.\r\n\r\nAt this awful threat, Demi sidled up to his sister, and Daisy hastily\r\ndried her tears, for to be separated was the worst misfortune that could\r\nhappen to the twins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat was bad, too, and Tommy was baddest of all,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Nan, fearing\r\nthat two of the sinners would not get their fair share of punishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, much ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain't!\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Tommy through the keyhole, where he was listening with\r\nall his might.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo wanted very much to laugh, but kept her countenance, and said\r\nimpressively, as she pointed to the door,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can go, boys, but remember, you are not to speak to or play with\r\nthe little girls till I give you leave. You don't deserve the pleasure,\r\nso I forbid it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ill-mannered young gentlemen hastily retired, to be received\r\noutside with derision and scorn by the unrepentant Bangs, who would\r\nnot associate with them for at least fifteen minutes. Daisy was soon\r\nconsoled for the failure of her ball, but lamented the edict that parted\r\nher from her brother, and mourned over his short-comings in her tender\r\nlittle heart. Nan rather enjoyed the trouble, and went about turning up\r\nher pug nose at the three, especially Tommy, who pretended not to care,\r\nand loudly proclaimed his satisfaction at being rid of those \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\r\ngirls.\xe2\x80\x9d But in his secret soul he soon repented of the rash act that\r\ncaused this banishment from the society he loved, and every hour of\r\nseparation taught him the value of the \xe2\x80\x9cstupid girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others gave in very soon, and longed to be friends, for now there\r\nwas no Daisy to pet and cook for them; no Nan to amuse and doctor them;\r\nand, worst of all, no Mrs. Jo to make home life pleasant and life easy\r\nfor them. To their great affliction, Mrs. Jo seemed to consider herself\r\none of the offended girls, for she hardly spoke to the outcasts, looked\r\nas if she did not see them when she passed, and was always too busy now\r\nto attend to their requests. This sudden and entire exile from favor\r\ncast a gloom over their souls, for when Mother Bhaer deserted them,\r\ntheir sun had set at noon-day, as it were, and they had no refuge left.\r\n\r\nThis unnatural state of things actually lasted for three days, then\r\nthey could bear it no longer, and fearing that the eclipse might become\r\ntotal, went to Mr. Bhaer for help and counsel.\r\n\r\nIt is my private opinion that he had received instructions how to behave\r\nif the case should be laid before him. But no one suspected it, and he\r\ngave the afflicted boys some advice, which they gratefully accepted and\r\ncarried out in the following manner:\r\n\r\nSecluding themselves in the garret, they devoted several play-hours to\r\nthe manufacture of some mysterious machine, which took so much paste\r\nthat Asia grumbled, and the little girls wondered mightily. Nan nearly\r\ngot her inquisitive nose pinched in the door, trying to see what was\r\ngoing on, and Daisy sat about, openly lamenting that they could not\r\nall play nicely together, and not have any dreadful secrets. Wednesday\r\nafternoon was fine, and after a good deal of consultation about wind and\r\nweather, Nat and Tommy went off, bearing an immense flat parcel hidden\r\nunder many newspapers. Nan nearly died with suppressed curiosity, Daisy\r\nnearly cried with vexation, and both quite trembled with interest when\r\nDemi marched into Mrs. Bhaer's room, hat in hand, and said, in the\r\npolitest tone possible to a mortal boy of his years,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Aunt Jo, would you and the girls come out to a surprise party\r\nwe have made for you? Do it's a very nice one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, we will come with pleasure; only, I must take Teddy with\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Bhaer, with a smile that cheered Demi like sunshine\r\nafter rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'd like to have him. The little wagon is all ready for the girls; you\r\nwon't mind walking just up to Pennyroyal Hill, will you Aunty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it exceedingly; but are you quite sure I shall not be in\r\nthe way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, indeed! we want you very much; and the party will be spoilt if\r\nyou don't come,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, with great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you kindly, sir;\xe2\x80\x9d and Aunt Jo made him a grand curtsey, for she\r\nliked frolics as well as any of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, young ladies, we must not keep them waiting; on with the hats, and\r\nlet us be off at once. I'm all impatience to know what the surprise is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Bhaer spoke every one bustled about, and in five minutes the\r\nthree little girls and Teddy were packed into the \xe2\x80\x9cclothes-basket,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nthey called the wicker wagon which Toby drew. Demi walked at the head of\r\nthe procession, and Mrs. Jo brought up the rear, escorted by Kit. It was\r\na most imposing party, I assure you, for Toby had a red feather-duster\r\nin his head, two remarkable flags waved over the carriage, Kit had a\r\nblue bow on his neck, which nearly drove him wild, Demi wore a nosegay\r\nof dandelions in his buttonhole, and Mrs. Jo carried the queer Japanese\r\numbrella in honor of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe girls had little flutters of excitement all the way; and Teddy was\r\nso charmed with the drive that he kept dropping his hat overboard, and\r\nwhen it was taken from him he prepared to tumble out himself, evidently\r\nfeeling that it behooved him to do something for the amusement of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the hill \xe2\x80\x9cnothing was to be seen but the grass\r\nblowing in the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d as the fairy books say, and the children looked\r\ndisappointed. But Demi said, in his most impressive manner,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you all get out and stand still, and the surprise party with come\r\nin;\xe2\x80\x9d with which remark he retired behind a rock, over which heads had\r\nbeen bobbing at intervals for the last half-hour.\r\n\r\nA short pause of intense suspense, and then Nat, Demi, and Tommy marched\r\nforth, each bearing a new kite, which they presented to the three young\r\nladies. Shrieks of delight arose, but were silenced by the boys, who\r\nsaid, with faces brimful of merriment, \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn't all the surprise;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and, running behind the rock, again emerged bearing a fourth kite of\r\nsuperb size, on which was printed, in bright yellow letters, \xe2\x80\x9cFor Mother\r\nBhaer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought you'd like one, too, because you were angry with us, and\r\ntook the girls' part,\xe2\x80\x9d cried all three, shaking with laughter, for this\r\npart of the affair evidently was a surprise to Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands, and joined in the laugh, looking thoroughly\r\ntickled at the joke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boys, that is regularly splendid! Who did think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nreceiving the monster kite with as much pleasure as the little girls did\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Fritz proposed it when we planned to make the others; he said\r\nyou'd like it, so we made a bouncer,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Demi, beaming with\r\nsatisfaction at the success of the plot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Fritz knows what I like. Yes, these are magnificent kites, and\r\nwe were wishing we had some the other day when you were flying yours,\r\nweren't we, girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's why we made them for you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, standing on his head as\r\nthe most appropriate way of expressing his emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us fly them,\xe2\x80\x9d said energetic Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know how,\xe2\x80\x9d began Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll show you, we want to!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the boys in a burst of devotion,\r\nas Demi took Daisy's, Tommy Nan's, and Nat, with difficulty, persuaded\r\nBess to let go her little blue one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunty, if you will wait a minute, we'll pitch yours for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi, feeling that Mrs. Bhaer's favor must not be lost again by any\r\nneglect of theirs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your buttons, dear, I know all about it; and here is a boy who\r\nwill toss up for me,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Jo, as the professor peeped over the\r\nrock with a face full of fun.\r\n\r\nHe came out at once, tossed up the big kite, and Mrs. Jo ran off with it\r\nin fine style, while the children stood and enjoyed the spectacle. One\r\nby one all the kites went up, and floated far overhead like gay birds,\r\nbalancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the\r\nhill. Such a merry time as they had! running and shouting, sending up\r\nthe kites or pulling them down, watching their antics in the air, and\r\nfeeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape.\r\nNan was quite wild with the fun, Daisy thought the new play nearly as\r\ninteresting as dolls, and little Bess was so fond of her \xe2\x80\x9cboo tite,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n that she would only let it go on very short flights, preferring to\r\nhold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by\r\nTommy's dashing brush. Mrs. Jo enjoyed hers immensely, and it acted as\r\nif it knew who owned it, for it came tumbling down head first when least\r\nexpected, caught on trees, nearly pitched into the river, and finally\r\ndarted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nBy and by every one got tired, and fastening the kite-strings to trees\r\nand fences, all sat down to rest, except Mr. Bhaer, who went off to look\r\nat the cows, with Teddy on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever have such a good time as this before?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, as they\r\nlay about on the grass, nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot since I last flew a kite, years ago, when I was a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nMrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to have known you when you were a girl, you must have been so\r\njolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a naughty little girl, I am sorry to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like naughty little girls,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Tommy, looking at Nan, who made\r\na frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't I remember you then, Aunty? Was I too young?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose my memory hadn't come then. Grandpa says that different parts\r\nof the mind unfold as we grow up, and the memory part of my mind hadn't\r\nunfolded when you were little, so I can't remember how you looked,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n explained Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, little Socrates, you had better keep that question for grandpa, it\r\nis beyond me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, putting on the extinguisher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will, he knows about those things, and you don't,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nDemi, feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the\r\ncomprehension of the present company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about the last time you flew a kite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, for Mrs. Jo had\r\nlaughed as she spoke of it, and he thought it might be interesting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it was only rather funny, for I was a great girl of fifteen, and\r\nwas ashamed to be seen at such a play. So Uncle Teddy and I privately\r\nmade our kites, and stole away to fly them. We had a capital time, and\r\nwere resting as we are now, when suddenly we heard voices, and saw a\r\nparty of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic. Teddy did\r\nnot mind, though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite,\r\nbut I was in a great flurry, for I knew I should be sadly laughed at,\r\nand never hear the last of it, because my wild ways amused the neighbors\r\nas much as Nan's do us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What shall I do?' I whispered to Teddy, as the voices drew nearer and\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I'll show you,' he said, and whipping out his knife he cut the\r\nstrings. Away flew the kites, and when the people came up we were\r\npicking flowers as properly as you please. They never suspected us, and\r\nwe had a grand laugh over our narrow escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere the kites lost, Aunty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite lost, but I did not care, for I made up my mind that it would be\r\nbest to wait till I was an old lady before I played with kites again;\r\nand you see I have waited,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, beginning to pull in the big\r\nkite, for it was getting late.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust we go now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, or you won't have any supper; and that sort of surprise party\r\nwould not suit you, I think, my chickens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHasn't our party been a nice one?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tommy, complacently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d answered every one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know why? It is because your guests have behaved themselves,\r\nand tried to make everything go well. You understand what I mean, don't\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes'm,\xe2\x80\x9d was all the boys said, but they stole a shamefaced look at one\r\nanother, as they meekly shouldered their kites and walked home, thinking\r\nof another party where the guests had not behaved themselves, and things\r\nhad gone badly on account of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN\r\n\r\nJuly had come, and haying begun; the little gardens were doing finely\r\nand the long summer days were full of pleasant hours. The house stood\r\nopen from morning till night, and the lads lived out of doors, except at\r\nschool time. The lessons were short, and there were many holidays, for\r\nthe Bhaers believed in cultivating healthy bodies by much exercise,\r\nand our short summers are best used in out-of-door work. Such a rosy,\r\nsunburnt, hearty set as the boys became; such appetites as they had;\r\nsuch sturdy arms and legs, as outgrew jackets and trousers; such\r\nlaughing and racing all over the place; such antics in house and barn;\r\nsuch adventures in the tramps over hill and dale; and such satisfaction\r\nin the hearts of the worthy Bhaers, as they saw their flock prospering\r\nin mind and body, I cannot begin to describe. Only one thing was needed\r\nto make them quite happy, and it came when they least expected it.\r\n\r\nOne balmy night when the little lads were in bed, the elder ones bathing\r\ndown at the brook, and Mrs. Bhaer undressing Teddy in her parlor, he\r\nsuddenly cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my Danny!\xe2\x80\x9d and pointed to the window, where the\r\nmoon shone brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, lovey, he is not there, it was the pretty moon,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Danny at a window; Teddy saw him,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted baby, much\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might have been,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Bhaer hurried to the window, hoping it\r\nwould prove true. But the face was gone, and nowhere appeared any signs\r\nof a mortal boy; she called his name, ran to the front door with Teddy\r\nin his little shirt, and made him call too, thinking the baby voice\r\nmight have more effect than her own. No one answered, nothing appeared,\r\nand they went back much disappointed. Teddy would not be satisfied with\r\nthe moon, and after he was in his crib kept popping up his head to ask\r\nif Danny was not \xe2\x80\x9ctummin' soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy and by he fell asleep, the lads trooped up to bed, the house grew\r\nstill, and nothing but the chirp of the crickets broke the soft silence\r\nof the summer night. Mrs. Bhaer sat sewing, for the big basket was\r\nalways piled with socks, full of portentous holes, and thinking of the\r\nlost boy. She had decided that baby had been mistaken, and did not even\r\ndisturb Mr. Bhaer by telling him of the child's fancy, for the poor\r\nman got little time to himself till the boys were abed, and he was busy\r\nwriting letters. It was past ten when she rose to shut up the house. As\r\nshe paused a minute to enjoy the lovely scene from the steps, something\r\nwhite caught her eye on one of the hay-cocks scattered over the lawn.\r\nThe children had been playing there all the afternoon, and, fancying\r\nthat Nan had left her hat as usual, Mrs. Bhaer went out to get it. But\r\nas she approached, she saw that it was neither hat nor handkerchief, but\r\na shirt sleeve with a brown hand sticking out of it. She hurried round\r\nthe hay-cock, and there lay Dan, fast asleep.\r\n\r\nRagged, dirty, thin, and worn-out he looked; one foot was bare, the\r\nother tied up in the old gingham jacket which he had taken from his own\r\nback to use as a clumsy bandage for some hurt. He seemed to have hidden\r\nhimself behind the hay-cock, but in his sleep had thrown out the arm\r\nthat had betrayed him. He sighed and muttered as if his dreams disturbed\r\nhim, and once when he moved, he groaned as if in pain, but still slept\r\non quite spent with weariness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must not lie here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, and stooping over him she\r\ngently called his name. He opened his eyes and looked at her, as if she\r\nwas a part of his dream, for he smiled and said drowsily, \xe2\x80\x9cMother Bhaer,\r\nI've come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look, the words, touched her very much, and she put her hand under\r\nhis head to lift him up, saying in her cordial way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you would, and I'm so glad to see you, Dan.\xe2\x80\x9d He seemed to\r\nwake thoroughly then, and started up looking about him as if he suddenly\r\nremembered where he was, and doubted even that kind welcome. His face\r\nchanged, and he said in his old rough way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going off in the morning. I only stopped to peek in, as I went\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not come in, Dan? Didn't you hear us call you? Teddy saw, and\r\ncried for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn't suppose you'd let me in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, fumbling with a little bundle\r\nwhich he had taken up as if going immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and see,\xe2\x80\x9d was all Mrs. Bhaer answered, holding out her hand and\r\npointing to the door, where the light shone hospitably.\r\n\r\nWith a long breath, as if a load was off his mind, Dan took up a stout\r\nstick, and began to limp towards the house, but stopped suddenly, to say\r\ninquiringly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bhaer won't like it. I ran away from Page.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows it, and was sorry, but it will make no difference. Are you\r\nlame?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo, as he limped on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGetting over a wall a stone fell on my foot and smashed it. I don't\r\nmind,\xe2\x80\x9d and he did his best to hide the pain each step cost him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer helped him into her own room, and, once there, he dropped\r\ninto a chair, and laid his head back, white and faint with weariness and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Dan! drink this, and then eat a little; you are at home now,\r\nand Mother Bhaer will take good care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only looked up at her with eyes full of gratitude, as he drank the\r\nwine she held to his lips, and then began slowly to eat the food she\r\nbrought him. Each mouthful seemed to put heart into him, and presently\r\nhe began to talk as if anxious to have her know all about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, beginning to get out some\r\nbandages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ran off more'n a month ago. Page was good enough, but too strict. I\r\ndidn't like it, so I cut away down the river with a man who was going in\r\nhis boat. That's why they couldn't tell where I'd gone. When I left the\r\nman, I worked for a couple of weeks with a farmer, but I thrashed his\r\nboy, and then the old man thrashed me, and I ran off again and walked\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the man didn't pay me, and I wouldn't ask for it. Took it out in\r\nbeating the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan laughed, yet looked ashamed, as he glanced at\r\nhis ragged clothes and dirty hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you live? It was a long, long tramp for a boy like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I got on well enough, till I hurt my foot. Folks gave me things to\r\neat, and I slept in barns and tramped by day. I got lost trying to make\r\na short cut, or I'd have been here sooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you did not mean to come in and stay with us, what were you\r\ngoing to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I'd like to see Teddy again, and you; and then I was going\r\nback to my old work in the city, only I was so tired I went to sleep on\r\nthe hay. I'd have been gone in the morning, if you hadn't found me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sorry I did?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo looked at him with a half merry, half\r\nreproachful look, as she knelt down to look at his wounded foot.\r\n\r\nThe color came up into Dan's face, and he kept his eyes fixed on his\r\nplate, as he said very low, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma'am, I'm glad, I wanted to stay, but\r\nI was afraid you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not finish, for Mrs. Bhaer interrupted him by an exclamation of\r\npity, as she saw his foot, for it was seriously hurt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have walked on it in this state?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a stick, and I washed it at every brook I came to, and one woman\r\ngave me a rag to put on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Bhaer must see and dress it at once,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo hastened into the\r\nnext room, leaving the door ajar behind her, so that Dan heard all that\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFritz, the boy has come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho? Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Teddy saw him at the window, and he called to him, but he went\r\naway and hid behind the hay-cocks on the lawn. I found him there just\r\nnow fast asleep, and half dead with weariness and pain. He ran away\r\nfrom Page a month ago, and has been making his way to us ever since. He\r\npretends that he did not mean to let us see him, but go on to the city,\r\nand his old work, after a look at us. It is evident, however, that the\r\nhope of being taken in has led him here through every thing, and there\r\nhe is waiting to know if you will forgive and take him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis eyes did, and when I waked him, he said, like a lost child, 'Mother\r\nBhaer, I've come home.' I hadn't the heart to scold him, and just took\r\nhim in like a poor little black sheep come back to the fold. I may keep\r\nhim, Fritz?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you may! This proves to me that we have a hold on the boy's\r\nheart, and I would no more send him away now than I would my own Rob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan heard a soft little sound, as if Mrs. Jo thanked her husband without\r\nwords, and, in the instant's silence that followed, two great tears that\r\nhad slowly gathered in the boy's eyes brimmed over and rolled down his\r\ndusty cheeks. No one saw them, for he brushed them hastily away; but\r\nin that little pause I think Dan's old distrust for these good people\r\nvanished for ever, the soft spot in his heart was touched, and he felt\r\nan impetuous desire to prove himself worthy of the love and pity that\r\nwas so patient and forgiving. He said nothing, he only wished the wish\r\nwith all his might, resolved to try in his blind boyish way, and\r\nsealed his resolution with the tears which neither pain, fatigue, nor\r\nloneliness could wring from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and see his foot. I am afraid it is badly hurt, for he has kept\r\non three days through heat and dust, with nothing but water and an old\r\njacket to bind it up with. I tell you, Fritz, that boy is a brave lad,\r\nand will make a fine man yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, for your sake, enthusiastic woman, your faith deserves\r\nsuccess. Now, I will go and see your little Spartan. Where is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my room; but, dear, you'll be very kind to him, no matter how\r\ngruff he seems. I am sure that is the way to conquer him. He won't bear\r\nsternness nor much restraint, but a soft word and infinite patience will\r\nlead him as it used to lead me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if you ever like this little rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bhaer, laughing, yet\r\nhalf angry at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in spirit, though I showed it in a different way. I seem to know\r\nby instinct how he feels, to understand what will win and touch him, and\r\nto sympathize with his temptations and faults. I am glad I do, for it\r\nwill help me to help him; and if I can make a good man of this wild boy,\r\nit will be the best work of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless the work, and help the worker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer spoke now as earnestly as she had done, and both came in\r\ntogether to find Dan's head down upon his arm, as if he was quite\r\novercome by sleep. But he looked up quickly, and tried to rise as Mr.\r\nBhaer said pleasantly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you like Plumfield better than Page's farm. Well, let us see if we\r\ncan get on more comfortably this time than we did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanky, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, trying not to be gruff, and finding it easier\r\nthan he expected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the foot! Ach! this is not well. We must have Dr. Firth to-morrow.\r\nWarm water, Jo, and old linen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer bathed and bound up the wounded foot, while Mrs. Jo prepared\r\nthe only empty bed in the house. It was in the little guest-chamber\r\nleading from the parlor, and often used when the lads were poorly, for\r\nit saved Mrs. Jo from running up and down, and the invalids could see\r\nwhat was going on. When it was ready, Mr. Bhaer took the boy in his\r\narms, and carried him in, helped him undress, laid him on the little\r\nwhite bed, and left him with another hand-shake, and a fatherly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan dropped asleep at once, and slept heavily for several hours; then\r\nhis foot began to throb and ache, and he awoke to toss about uneasily,\r\ntrying not to groan lest any one should hear him, for he was a brave\r\nlad, and did bear pain like \xe2\x80\x9ca little Spartan,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mr. Bhaer called him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo had a way of flitting about the house at night, to shut the\r\nwindows if the wind grew chilly, to draw mosquito curtains over Teddy,\r\nor look after Tommy, who occasionally walked in his sleep. The least\r\nnoise waked her, and as she often heard imaginary robbers, cats, and\r\nconflagrations, the doors stood open all about, so her quick ear caught\r\nthe sound of Dan's little moans, and she was up in a minute. He was just\r\ngiving his hot pillow a despairing thump when a light came glimmering\r\nthrough the hall, and Mrs. Jo crept in, looking like a droll ghost,\r\nwith her hair in a great knob on the top of her head, and a long gray\r\ndressing-gown trailing behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in pain, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's pretty bad; but I didn't mean to wake you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm a sort of owl, always flying about at night. Yes, your foot is like\r\nfire; the bandages must be wet again,\xe2\x80\x9d and away flapped the maternal owl\r\nfor more cooling stuff, and a great mug of ice water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that's so nice!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Dan, the wet bandages went on again, and a\r\nlong draught of water cooled his thirsty throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, now, sleep your best, and don't be frightened if you see me\r\nagain, for I'll slip down by and by, and give you another sprinkle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Mrs. Jo stooped to turn the pillow and smooth the\r\nbed-clothes, when, to her great surprise, Dan put his arm around her\r\nneck, drew her face down to his, and kissed her, with a broken \xe2\x80\x9cThank\r\nyou, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d which said more than the most eloquent speech could have\r\ndone; for the hasty kiss, the muttered words, meant, \xe2\x80\x9cI'm sorry, I will\r\ntry.\xe2\x80\x9d She understood it, accepted the unspoken confession, and did not\r\nspoil it by any token of surprise. She only remembered that he had no\r\nmother, kissed the brown cheek half hidden on the pillow, as if ashamed\r\nof the little touch of tenderness, and left him, saying, what he long\r\nremembered, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are my boy now, and if you choose you can make me proud\r\nand glad to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce again, just at dawn, she stole down to find him so fast asleep\r\nthat he did not wake, and showed no sign of consciousness as she wet his\r\nfoot, except that the lines of pain smoothed themselves away, and left\r\nhis face quite peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe day was Sunday, and the house so still that he never waked till near\r\nnoon, and, looking round him, saw an eager little face peering in at\r\nthe door. He held out his arms, and Teddy tore across the room to cast\r\nhimself bodily upon the bed, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Danny's tum!\xe2\x80\x9d as he hugged\r\nand wriggled with delight. Mrs. Bhaer appeared next, bringing breakfast,\r\nand never seeming to see how shamefaced Dan looked at the memory of the\r\nlittle scene last night. Teddy insisted on giving him his \xe2\x80\x9cbetfus,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfed him like a baby, which, as he was not very hungry, Dan enjoyed very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThen came the doctor, and the poor Spartan had a bad time of it, for\r\nsome of the little bones in his foot were injured, and putting them to\r\nrights was such a painful job, that Dan's lips were white, and great\r\ndrops stood on his forehead, though he never cried out, and only held\r\nMrs. Jo's hand so tight that it was red long afterwards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must keep this boy quiet, for a week at least, and not let him put\r\nhis foot to the ground. By that time, I shall know whether he may hop a\r\nlittle with a crutch, or stick to his bed for a while longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr.\r\nFirth, putting up the shining instruments that Dan did not like to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will get well sometime, won't it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking alarmed at the\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9ccrutches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so;\xe2\x80\x9d and with that the doctor departed, leaving Dan much\r\ndepressed; for the loss of a foot is a dreadful calamity to an active\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't be troubled, I am a famous nurse, and we will have you tramping\r\nabout as well as ever in a month,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, taking a hopeful view\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nBut the fear of being lame haunted Dan, and even Teddy's caresses did\r\nnot cheer him; so Mrs. Jo proposed that one or two of the boys should\r\ncome in and pay him a little visit, and asked whom he would like to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNat and Demi; I'd like my hat too, there's something in it I guess\r\nthey'd like to see. I suppose you threw away my bundle of plunder?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDan, looking rather anxious as he put the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I kept it, for I thought they must be treasures of some kind, you\r\ntook such care of them;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo brought him his old straw hat\r\nstuck full of butterflies and beetles, and a handkerchief containing a\r\ncollection of odd things picked up on his way: birds' eggs, carefully\r\ndone up in moss, curious shells and stones, bits of fungus, and several\r\nlittle crabs, in a state of great indignation at their imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I have something to put these fellers in? Mr. Hyde and I found\r\n'em, and they are first-rate ones, so I'd like to keep and watch 'em;\r\ncan I?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, forgetting his foot, and laughing to see the crabs go\r\nsidling and backing over the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you can; Polly's old cage will be just the thing. Don't let\r\nthem nip Teddy's toes while I get it;\xe2\x80\x9d and away went Mrs. Jo, leaving\r\nDan overjoyed to find that his treasures were not considered rubbish,\r\nand thrown away.\r\n\r\nNat, Demi, and the cage arrived together, and the crabs were settled\r\nin their new house, to the great delight of the boys, who, in the\r\nexcitement of the performance, forgot any awkwardness they might\r\notherwise have felt in greeting the runaway. To these admiring listeners\r\nDan related his adventures much more fully than he had done to the\r\nBhaers. Then he displayed his \xe2\x80\x9cplunder,\xe2\x80\x9d and described each article so\r\nwell, that Mrs. Jo, who had retired to the next room to leave them\r\nfree, was surprised and interested, as well as amused, at their boyish\r\nchatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much the lad knows of these things! how absorbed he is in them! and\r\nwhat a mercy it is just now, for he cares so little for books, it would\r\nbe hard to amuse him while he is laid up; but the boys can supply him\r\nwith beetles and stones to any extent, and I am glad to find out this\r\ntaste of his; it is a good one, and may perhaps prove the making of him.\r\nIf he should turn out a great naturalist, and Nat a musician, I should\r\nhave cause to be proud of this year's work;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo sat smiling\r\nover her book as she built castles in the air, just as she used to do\r\nwhen a girl, only then they were for herself, and now they were for\r\nother people, which is the reason perhaps that some of them came to\r\npass in reality for charity is an excellent foundation to build anything\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nNat was most interested in the adventures, but Demi enjoyed the beetles\r\nand butterflies immensely, drinking in the history of their changeful\r\nlittle lives as if it were a new and lovely sort of fairy tale for, even\r\nin his plain way, Dan told it well, and found great satisfaction in the\r\nthought that here at least the small philosopher could learn of him. So\r\ninterested were they in the account of catching a musk rat, whose skin\r\nwas among the treasures, that Mr. Bhaer had to come himself to tell Nat\r\nand Demi it was time for the walk. Dan looked so wistfully after them as\r\nthey ran off that Father Bhaer proposed carrying him to the sofa in the\r\nparlor for a little change of air and scene.\r\n\r\nWhen he was established, and the house quiet, Mrs. Jo, who sat near\r\nby showing Teddy pictures, said, in an interested tone, as she nodded\r\ntowards the treasures still in Dan's hands,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you learn so much about these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always liked 'em, but didn't know much till Mr. Hyde told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he was a man who lived round in the woods studying these things I\r\ndon't know what you call him and wrote about frogs, and fishes, and so\r\non. He stayed at Page's, and used to want me to go and help him, and it\r\nwas great fun, 'cause he told me ever so much, and was uncommon jolly\r\nand wise. Hope I'll see him again sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, for Dan's face had brightened up, and\r\nhe was so interested in the matter that he forgot his usual taciturnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he could make birds come to him, and rabbits and squirrels didn't\r\nmind him any more than if he was a tree. Did you ever tickle a lizard\r\nwith a straw?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I should like to try it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I've done it, and it's so funny to see 'em turn over and stretch\r\nout, they like it so much. Mr. Hyde used to do it; and he'd make snakes\r\nlisten to him while he whistled, and he knew just when certain flowers\r\nwould blow, and bees wouldn't sting him, and he'd tell the wonderfullest\r\nthings about fish and flies, and the Indians and the rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you were so fond of going with Mr. Hyde, you rather neglected\r\nMr. Page,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did; I hated to have to weed and hoe when I might be tramping\r\nround with Mr. Hyde. Page thought such things silly, and called Mr. Hyde\r\ncrazy because he'd lay hours watching a trout or a bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you say lie instead of lay, it is better grammar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nJo, very gently; and then added, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Page is a thorough farmer, and\r\nwould not understand that a naturalist's work was just as interesting,\r\nand perhaps just as important as his own. Now, Dan, if you really love\r\nthese things, as I think you do, and I am glad to see it, you shall have\r\ntime to study them and books to help you; but I want you to do something\r\nbesides, and to do it faithfully, else you will be sorry by and by, and\r\nfind that you have got to begin again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, meekly, and looked a little scared by the\r\nserious tone of the last remarks, for he hated books, yet had evidently\r\nmade up his mind to study anything she proposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next very\r\nunexpected question.\r\n\r\nDan did see two tall old-fashioned ones standing on either side of the\r\npiano; he knew them well, and had often seen nice bits of string, nails,\r\nbrown paper, and such useful matters come out of the various drawers. He\r\nnodded and smiled. Mrs. Jo went on,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don't you think those drawers would be good places to put your\r\neggs, and stones, and shells, and lichens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, splendid, but you wouldn't like my things 'clutterin' round,' as\r\nMr. Page used to say, would you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan, sitting up to survey the\r\nold piece of furniture with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like litter of that sort; and if I didn't, I should give you the\r\ndrawers, because I have a regard for children's little treasures, and\r\nI think they should be treated respectfully. Now, I am going to make a\r\nbargain with you, Dan, and I hope you will keep it honorably. Here are\r\ntwelve good-sized drawers, one for each month of the year, and they\r\nshall be yours as fast as you earn them, by doing the little duties that\r\nbelong to you. I believe in rewards of a certain kind, especially for\r\nyoung folks; they help us along, and though we may begin by being good\r\nfor the sake of the reward, if it is rightly used, we shall soon learn\r\nto love goodness for itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you have 'em?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, looking as if this was new talk for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed! I haven't learnt to get on without them yet. My rewards\r\nare not drawers, or presents, or holidays, but they are things which I\r\nlike as much as you do the others. The good behavior and success of my\r\nboys is one of the rewards I love best, and I work for it as I want you\r\nto work for your cabinet. Do what you dislike, and do it well, and\r\nyou get two rewards, one, the prize you see and hold; the other, the\r\nsatisfaction of a duty cheerfully performed. Do you understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma'am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe all need these little helps; so you shall try to do your lessons and\r\nyour work, play kindly with all the boys, and use your holidays well;\r\nand if you bring me a good report, or if I see and know it without words\r\nfor I'm quick to spy out the good little efforts of my boys you shall\r\nhave a compartment in the drawer for your treasures. See, some are\r\nalready divided into four parts, and I will have the others made in\r\nthe same way, a place for each week; and when the drawer is filled\r\nwith curious and pretty things, I shall be as proud of it as you are;\r\nprouder, I think for in the pebbles, mosses, and gay butterflies, I\r\nshall see good resolutions carried out, conquered faults, and a promise\r\nwell kept. Shall we do this, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys answered with one of the looks which said much, for it showed\r\nthat he felt and understood her wish and words, although he did not know\r\nhow to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness.\r\nShe understood the look, and seeing by the color that flushed up to his\r\nforehead that he was touched, as she wished him to be, she said no more\r\nabout that side of the new plan, but pulled out the upper drawer, dusted\r\nit, and set it on two chairs before the sofa, saying briskly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safe\r\nplace. These compartments will hold a good deal, you see. I'd pin the\r\nbutterflies and bugs round the sides; they will be quite safe there, and\r\nleave room for the heavy things below. I'll give you some cotton wool,\r\nand clean paper and pins, and you can get ready for the week's work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can't go out to find any new things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, looking piteously\r\nat his foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's true; never mind, we'll let these treasures do for this week,\r\nand I dare say the boys will bring you loads of things if you ask them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey don't know the right sort; besides, if I lay, no, lie here all the\r\ntime, I can't work and study, and earn my drawers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there, and several\r\nlittle jobs of work you can do for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked both surprised and pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play.\r\nYou can amuse Teddy for me, wind cotton, read to me when I sew, and do\r\nmany things without hurting your foot, which will make the days pass\r\nquickly, and not be wasted ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand, and a very ugly\r\nlittle toad in the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Dan, I found them, and ran back to give them to you; aren't they\r\nbeautiful ones?\xe2\x80\x9d panted Demi, all out of breath.\r\n\r\nDan laughed at the toad, and said he had no place to put him, but the\r\nbutterfly was a beauty, and if Mrs. Jo would give him a big pin, he\r\nwould stick it right up in the drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin; if it must be\r\nkilled, let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Jo, getting out the bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know how to do it Mr. Hyde always killed 'em that way but I didn't\r\nhave any camphor, so I use a pin,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan gently poured a drop on the\r\ninsect's head, when the pale green wings fluttered an instant, and then\r\ngrew still.\r\n\r\nThis dainty little execution was hardly over when Teddy shouted from the\r\nbedroom, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the little trabs are out, and the big one's eaten 'em\r\nall up.\xe2\x80\x9d Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue, and found Teddy dancing\r\nexcitedly in a chair, while two little crabs were scuttling about the\r\nfloor, having got through the wires of the cage. A third was clinging to\r\nthe top of the cage, evidently in terror of his life, for below appeared\r\na sad yet funny sight. The big crab had wedged himself into the little\r\nrecess where Polly's cup used to stand, and there he sat eating one of\r\nhis relations in the coolest way. All the claws of the poor victim were\r\npulled off, and he was turned upside down, his upper shell held in\r\none claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish, while he\r\nleisurely ate out of it with the other claw, pausing now and then to\r\nturn his queer bulging eyes from side to side, and to put out a slender\r\ntongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with\r\nlaughter. Mrs. Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight, while\r\nDemi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted wash-bowl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll have to let these fellers go, for I can't keep 'em in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Dan, with evident regret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll take care of them for you, if you will tell me how, and they can\r\nlive in my turtle-tank just as well as not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who found them\r\nmore interesting even that his beloved slow turtles. So Dan gave him\r\ndirections about the wants and habits of the crabs, and Demi bore them\r\naway to introduce them to their new home and neighbors. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a good\r\nboy he is!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, carefully settling the first butterfly, and\r\nremembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to be, for a great deal has been done to make him so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's had folks to tell him things, and to help him; I haven't,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDan, with a sigh, thinking of his neglected childhood, a thing he seldom\r\ndid, and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, dear, and for that reason I don't expect as much from you as\r\nfrom Demi, though he is younger; you shall have all the help that we can\r\ngive you now, and I hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best\r\nway. Have you forgotten what Father Bhaer told you when you were here\r\nbefore, about wanting to be good, and asking God to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d very low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you try that way still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d lower still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do it every night to please me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d very soberly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall depend on it, and I think I shall know if you are faithful\r\nto your promise, for these things always show to people who believe in\r\nthem, though not a word is said. Now here is a pleasant story about a\r\nboy who hurt his foot worse than you did yours; read it, and see how\r\nbravely he bore his troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put that charming little book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crofton Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d into his hands,\r\nand left him for an hour, passing in and out from time to time that\r\nhe might not feel lonely. Dan did not love to read, but soon got so\r\ninterested that he was surprised when the boys came home. Daisy brought\r\nhim a nosegay of wild flowers, and Nan insisted on helping bring him his\r\nsupper, as he lay on the sofa with the door open into the dining-room,\r\nso that he could see the lads at table, and they could nod socially to\r\nhim over their bread and butter.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer carried him away to his bed early, and Teddy came in his\r\nnight-gown to say good-night, for he went to his little nest with the\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to say my prayers to Danny; may I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked; and when his\r\nmother said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d the little fellow knelt down by Dan's bed, and\r\nfolding his chubby hands, said softly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPease Dod bess everybody, and hep me to be dood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went away smiling with sleepy sweetness over his mother's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nBut after the evening talk was done, the evening song sung, and the\r\nhouse grew still with beautiful Sunday silence, Dan lay in his pleasant\r\nroom wide awake, thinking new thoughts, feeling new hopes and desires\r\nstirring in his boyish heart, for two good angels had entered in: love\r\nand gratitude began the work which time and effort were to finish; and\r\nwith an earnest wish to keep his first promise, Dan folded his hands\r\ntogether in the Darkness, and softly whispered Teddy's little prayer,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease God bless every one, and help me to be good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. UNCLE TEDDY\r\n\r\nFor a week Dan only moved from bed to sofa; a long week and a hard one,\r\nfor the hurt foot was very painful at times, the quiet days were very\r\nwearisome to the active lad, longing to be out enjoying the summer\r\nweather, and especially difficult was it to be patient. But Dan did\r\nhis best, and every one helped him in their various ways; so the time\r\npassed, and he was rewarded at last by hearing the doctor say, on\r\nSaturday morning,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis foot is doing better than I expected. Give the lad the crutch this\r\nafternoon, and let him stump about the house a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nat, and raced away to tell the other boys the good\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nEverybody was very glad, and after dinner the whole flock assembled to\r\nbehold Dan crutch himself up and down the hall a few times before he\r\nsettled in the porch to hold a sort of levee. He was much pleased at the\r\ninterest and good-will shown him, and brightened up more and more every\r\nminute; for the boys came to pay their respects, the little girls fussed\r\nabout him with stools and cushions, and Teddy watched over him as if he\r\nwas a frail creature unable to do anything for himself. They were still\r\nsitting and standing about the steps, when a carriage stopped at the\r\ngate, a hat was waved from it, and with a shout of \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Teddy! Uncle\r\nTeddy!\xe2\x80\x9d Rob scampered down the avenue as fast as his short legs would\r\ncarry him. All he boys but Dan ran after him to see who should be\r\nfirst to open the gate, and in a moment the carriage drove up with boys\r\nswarming all over it, while Uncle Teddy sat laughing in the midst, with\r\nhis little daughter on his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop the triumphal car and let Jupiter descend,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and jumping\r\nout ran up the steps to meet Mrs. Bhaer, who stood smiling and clapping\r\nher hands like a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow goes it, Teddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Jo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they shook hands, and Mr. Laurie put Bess into her aunt's arms,\r\nsaying, as the child hugged her tight, \xe2\x80\x9cGoldilocks wanted to see you so\r\nmuch that I ran away with her, for I was quite pining for a sight of you\r\nmyself. We want to play with your boys for an hour or so, and to see how\r\n'the old woman who lived in a shoe, and had so many children she did not\r\nknow what to do,' is getting on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm so glad! Play away, and don't get into mischief,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs.\r\nJo, as the lads crowded round the pretty child, admiring her long golden\r\nhair, dainty dress, and lofty ways, for the little \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess,\xe2\x80\x9d as they\r\ncalled her, allowed no one to kiss her, but sat smiling down upon them,\r\nand graciously patting their heads with her little, white hands. They\r\nall adored her, especially Rob, who considered her a sort of doll,\r\nand dared not touch her lest she should break, but worshipped her at a\r\nrespectful distance, made happy by an occasional mark of favor from her\r\nlittle highness. As she immediately demanded to see Daisy's kitchen,\r\nshe was borne off by Mrs. Jo, with a train of small boys following. The\r\nothers, all but Nat and Demi, ran away to the menagerie and gardens\r\nto have all in order; for Mr. Laurie always took a general survey, and\r\nlooked disappointed if things were not flourishing.\r\n\r\nStanding on the steps, he turned to Dan, saying like an old\r\nacquaintance, though he had only seen him once or twice before,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the foot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather tired of the house, aren't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess I am!\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan's eyes roved away to the green hills and woods\r\nwhere he longed to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we take a little turn before the others come back? That big,\r\neasy carriage will be quite safe and comfortable, and a breath of fresh\r\nair will do you good. Get a cushion and a shawl, Demi, and let's carry\r\nDan off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys thought it a capital joke, and Dan looked delighted, but asked,\r\nwith an unexpected burst of virtue,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Mrs. Bhaer like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; we settled all that a minute ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn't say any thing about it, so I don't see how you could,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi, inquisitively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a way of sending messages to one another, without any words. It\r\nis a great improvement on the telegraph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it's eyes; I saw you lift your eyebrows, and nod toward the\r\ncarriage, and Mrs. Bhaer laughed and nodded back again,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, who\r\nwas quite at his ease with kind Mr. Laurie by this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight. Now them, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a minute Dan found himself settled in\r\nthe carriage, his foot on a cushion on the seat opposite, nicely\r\ncovered with a shawl, which fell down from the upper regions in a most\r\nmysterious manner, just when they wanted it. Demi climbed up to the\r\nbox beside Peter, the black coachman. Nat sat next Dan in the place of\r\nhonor, while Uncle Teddy would sit opposite, to take care of the foot,\r\nhe said, but really that he might study the faces before him both so\r\nhappy, yet so different, for Dan's was square, and brown, and strong,\r\nwhile Nat's was long, and fair, and rather weak, but very amiable with\r\nits mild eyes and good forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, I've got a book somewhere here that you may like to see,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the oldest boy of the party, diving under the seat and producing a\r\nbook which make Dan exclaim,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! by George, isn't that a stunner?\xe2\x80\x9d as he turned the leaves, and saw\r\nfine plates of butterflies, and birds, and every sort of interesting\r\ninsect, colored like life. He was so charmed that he forgot his thanks,\r\nbut Mr. Laurie did not mind, and was quite satisfied to see the boy's\r\neager delight, and to hear this exclamations over certain old friends as\r\nhe came to them. Nat leaned on his shoulder to look, and Demi turned his\r\nback to the horses, and let his feet dangle inside the carriage, so that\r\nhe might join in the conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen they got among the beetles, Mr. Laurie took a curious little object\r\nout of his vest-pocket, and laying it in the palm of his hand, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a beetle that is thousands of years old;\xe2\x80\x9d and then, while the\r\nlads examined the queer stone-bug, that looked so old and gray, he told\r\nthem how it came out of the wrappings of a mummy, after lying for ages\r\nin a famous tomb. Finding them interested, he went on to tell about the\r\nEgyptians, and the strange and splendid ruins they have left behind them\r\nthe Nile, and how he sailed up the mighty river, with the handsome dark\r\nmen to work his boat; how he shot alligators, saw wonderful beasts and\r\nbirds; and afterwards crossed the desert on a camel, who pitched him\r\nabout like a ship in a storm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Teddy tells stories 'most as well as Grandpa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi,\r\napprovingly, when the tale was done, and the boys' eyes asked for more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Laurie, quite soberly, for he considered Demi's\r\npraise worth having, for children are good critics in such cases, and to\r\nsuit them is an accomplishment that any one may be proud of.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's another trifle or two that I tucked into my pocket as I was\r\nturning over my traps to see if I had any thing that would amuse Dan,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Uncle Teddy produced a fine arrow-head and a string of wampum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! tell about the Indians,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, who was fond of playing\r\nwigwam.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan knows lots about them,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than I do, I dare say. Tell us something,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Laurie looked\r\nas interested as the other two.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hyde told me; he's been among 'em, and can talk their talk,\r\nand likes 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d began Dan, flattered by their attention, but rather\r\nembarrassed by having a grown-up listener.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is wampum for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked curious Demi, from his perch.\r\n\r\nThe others asked questions likewise, and, before he knew it, Dan was\r\nreeling off all Mr. Hyde had told him, as they sailed down the river\r\na few weeks before. Mr. Laurie listened well, but found the boy more\r\ninteresting than the Indians, for Mrs. Jo had told him about Dan, and\r\nhe rather took a fancy to the wild lad, who ran away as he himself\r\nhad often longed to do, and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have\r\na museum of your own; a place in which to collect all the curious and\r\ninteresting things that you find, and make, and have given you. Mrs. Jo\r\nis too kind to complain, but it is rather hard for her to have the house\r\nlittered up with all sorts of rattletraps, half-a-pint of dor-bugs in\r\none of her best vases, for instance, a couple of dead bats nailed up in\r\nthe back entry, wasps nests tumbling down on people's heads, and stones\r\nlying round everywhere, enough to pave the avenue. There are not many\r\nwomen who would stand that sort of thing, are there, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes, the boys laughed and\r\nnudged one another, for it was evident that some one told tales out of\r\nschool, else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can we put them, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, crossing his legs and leaning\r\ndown to argue the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the old carriage-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it leaks, and there isn't any window, nor any place to put things,\r\nand it's all dust and cobwebs,\xe2\x80\x9d began Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit, and then see how\r\nyou like it. He is to come over on Monday to get it ready; then\r\nnext Saturday I shall come out, and we will fix it up, and make the\r\nbeginning, at least, of a fine little museum. Every one can bring\r\nhis things, and have a place for them; and Dan is to be the head man,\r\nbecause he knows most about such matters, and it will be quiet, pleasant\r\nwork for him now that he can't knock about much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't that be jolly?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, while Dan smiled all over his face and\r\nhad not a word to say, but hugged his book, and looked at Mr. Laurie\r\nas if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever\r\nblessed the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go round again, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Peter, as they came to the gate,\r\nafter two slow turns about the half-mile triangle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we must be prudent, else we can't come again. I must go over the\r\npremises, take a look at the carriage-house, and have a little talk with\r\nMrs. Jo before I go;\xe2\x80\x9d and, having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and\r\nenjoy his book, Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who\r\nwere raging about the place in search of him. Leaving the little girls\r\nto mess up-stairs, Mrs. Bhaer sat down by Dan, and listened to his eager\r\naccount of the drive till the flock returned, dusty, warm, and much\r\nexcited about the new museum, which every one considered the most\r\nbrilliant idea of the age.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always wanted to endow some sort of an institution, and I am going to\r\nbegin with this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Laurie, sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have endowed one already. What do you call this?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo\r\npointed to the happy-faced lads, who had camped upon the floor about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI call it a very promising Bhaer-garden, and I'm proud to be a member\r\nof it. Did you know I was the head boy in this school?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nturning to Dan, and changing the subject skilfully, for he hated to be\r\nthanked for the generous things he did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought Franz was!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, wondering what the man meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear no! I'm the first boy Mrs. Jo ever had to take care of, and I\r\nwas such a bad one that she isn't done with me yet, though she has been\r\nworking at me for years and years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old she must be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, innocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe began early, you see. Poor thing! she was only fifteen when she\r\ntook me, and I led her such a life, it's a wonder she isn't wrinkled and\r\ngray, and quite worn out,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Laurie looked up at her laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't Teddy; I won't have you abuse yourself so;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo stroked\r\nthe curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever, for, in\r\nspite of every thing Teddy was her boy still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it hadn't been for you, there never would have been a Plumfield. It\r\nwas my success with you, sir, that gave me courage to try my pet plan.\r\nSo the boys may thank you for it, and name the new institution 'The\r\nLaurence Museum,' in honor of its founder, won't we, boys?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nlooking very like the lively Jo of old times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will! we will!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the boys, throwing up their hats, for though\r\nthey had taken them off on entering the house, according to rule, they\r\nhad been in too much of a hurry to hang them up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm as hungry as a bear, can't I have a cookie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Laurie, when\r\nthe shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrot out and ask Asia for the gingerbread-box, Demi. It isn't in order\r\nto eat between meals, but, on this joyful occasion, we won't mind, and\r\nhave a cookie all round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo; and when the box came she\r\ndealt them out with a liberal hand, every one munching away in a social\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of a bite, Mr. Laurie cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cBless my heart,\r\nI forgot grandma's bundle!\xe2\x80\x9d and running out to the carriage, returned\r\nwith an interesting white parcel, which, being opened, disclosed a\r\nchoice collection of beasts, birds, and pretty things cut out of crisp\r\nsugary cake, and baked a lovely brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's one for each, and a letter to tell which is whose. Grandma and\r\nHannah made them, and I tremble to think what would have happened to me\r\nif I had forgotten to leave them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, amid much laughing and fun, the cakes were distributed. A fish for\r\nDan, a fiddle for Nat, a book for Demi, a money for Tommy, a flower for\r\nDaisy, a hoop for Nan, who had driven twice round the triangle without\r\nstopping, a star for Emil, who put on airs because he studied astronomy,\r\nand, best of all, an omnibus for Franz, whose great delight was to drive\r\nthe family bus. Stuffy got a fat pig, and the little folks had birds,\r\nand cats, and rabbits, with black currant eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I must go. Where is my Goldilocks? Mamma will come flying out to\r\nget her if I'm not back early,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Teddy, when the last crumb\r\nhad vanished, which it speedily did, you may be sure.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies had gone into the garden, and while they waited till\r\nFranz looked them up, Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow does little Giddy-gaddy come on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, for Nan's pranks amused\r\nhim very much, and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNicely; she is getting quite mannerly, and begins to see the error of\r\nher wild ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't the boys encourage her in them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but I keep talking, and lately she has improved much. You saw how\r\nprettily she shook hands with you, and how gentle she was with Bess.\r\nDaisy's example has its effect upon her, and I'm quite sure that a few\r\nmonths will work wonders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Jo's remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing\r\nround the corner at a break-neck pace, driving a mettlesome team of four\r\nboys, and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow. Hat off,\r\nhair flying, whip cracking, and barrow bumping, up they came in a cloud\r\nof dust, looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, these are the model children, are they? It's lucky I didn't bring\r\nMrs. Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals\r\nand manners; she would never have recovered from the shock of this\r\nspectacle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Laurie, laughing at Mrs. Jo's premature rejoicing\r\nover Nan's improvement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh away; I'll succeed yet. As you used to say at College, quoting\r\nsome professor, 'Though the experiment has failed, the principle remains\r\nthe same,'\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, joining in the merriment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid Nan's example is taking effect upon Daisy, instead of the\r\nother way. Look at my little princess! she has utterly forgotten her\r\ndignity, and is screaming like the rest. Young ladies, what does\r\nthis mean?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending\r\ndestruction, for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting\r\nmadly all about her, as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe're having a race, and I beat,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have run faster, only I was afraid of spilling Bess,\xe2\x80\x9d screamed\r\nDaisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! go long!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the princess, giving such a flourish with her whip\r\nthat the horses ran away, and were seen no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy precious child! come away from this ill-mannered crew before you are\r\nquite spoilt. Good-by, Jo! Next time I come, I shall expect to find the\r\nboys making patchwork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wouldn't hurt them a bit. I don't give in, mind you; for my\r\nexperiments always fail a few times before they succeed. Love to Amy and\r\nmy blessed Marmee,\xe2\x80\x9d called Mrs. Jo, as the carriage drove away; and the\r\nlast Mr. Laurie saw of her, she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a\r\nride in the wheelbarrow, and looking as if she liked it.\r\n\r\nGreat was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the\r\ncarriage-house, which went briskly on in spite of the incessant\r\nquestions, advice, and meddling of the boys. Old Gibbs was nearly driven\r\nwild with it all, but managed to do his work nevertheless; and by\r\nFriday night the place was all in order roof mended, shelves up, walls\r\nwhitewashed, a great window cut at the back, which let in a flood of\r\nsunshine, and gave them a fine view of the brook, the meadows, and the\r\ndistant hills; and over the great door, painted in red letters, was \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nLaurence Museum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished\r\nwith their spoils, and when Mr. Laurie arrived, bringing an aquarium\r\nwhich Mrs. Amy said she was tired of, their rapture was great.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in arranging things, and when the running and\r\nlugging and hammering was over, the ladies were invited to behold the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a pleasant place, airy, clean, and bright. A hop-vine\r\nshook its green bells round the open window, the pretty aquarium stood\r\nin the middle of the room, with some delicate water plants rising above\r\nthe water, and gold-fish showing their brightness as they floated to and\r\nfro below. On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to\r\nreceive the curiosities yet to be found. Dan's tall cabinet stood before\r\nthe great door which was fastened up, while the small door was to be\r\nused. On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol, very ugly, but very\r\ninteresting; old Mr. Laurence sent it, as well as a fine Chinese junk in\r\nfull sail, which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle\r\nof the room. Above, swinging in a loop, and looking as if she was alive,\r\nhung Polly, who died at an advanced age, had been carefully stuffed, and\r\nwas no presented by Mrs. Jo. The walls were decorated with all sorts of\r\nthings. A snake's skin, a big wasp's nest, a birch-bark canoe, a string\r\nof birds' eggs, wreaths of gray moss from the South, and a bunch of\r\ncotton-pods. The dead bats had a place, also a large turtle-shell, and\r\nan ostrich-egg proudly presented by Demi, who volunteered to explain\r\nthese rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked. There were so many\r\nstones that it was impossible to accept them all, so only a few of the\r\nbest were arranged among the shells on the shelves, the rest were piled\r\nup in corners, to be examined by Dan at his leisure.\r\n\r\nEvery one was eager to give something, even Silas, who sent home for\r\na stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth. It was rather moth-eaten and\r\nshabby, but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was\r\nfine, for the yellow glass eyes glared, and the mouth snarled so\r\nnaturally, that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it, when he\r\ncame bringing his most cherished treasure, one cocoon, to lay upon the\r\nshrine of science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't it beautiful? I'd no idea we had so many curious things. I gave\r\nthat; don't it look well? We might make a lot by charging something for\r\nletting folks see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as\r\nthe family viewed the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it I'll paint\r\nout the name over the door,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Laurie, turning so quickly that\r\nJack wished he had held his tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear! hear!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeech! speech!\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't, I'm too bashful. You give them a lecture yourself you are used\r\nto it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Laurie answered, retreating towards the window, meaning to\r\nescape. But she held him fast, and said, laughing as she looked at the\r\ndozen pairs of dirty hands about her,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did lecture, it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of\r\nsoap. Come now, as the founder of the institution, you really ought to\r\ngive us a few moral remarks, and we will applaud tremendously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was no way of escaping, Mr. Laurie looked up at Polly\r\nhanging overhead, seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird,\r\nand sitting down upon the table, said, in his pleasant way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one thing I'd like to suggest, boys, and that is, I want you\r\nto get some good as well as much pleasure out of this. Just putting\r\ncurious or pretty things here won't do it; so suppose you read up about\r\nthem, so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them, and\r\nunderstand the matter. I used to like these things myself, and should\r\nenjoy hearing about them now, for I've forgotten all I once knew. It\r\nwasn't much, was it, Jo? Here's Dan now, full of stories about birds,\r\nand bugs, and so on; let him take care of the museum, and once a week\r\nthe rest of you take turns to read a composition, or tell about some\r\nanimal, mineral, or vegetable. We should all like that, and I think it\r\nwould put considerable useful knowledge into our heads. What do you say,\r\nProfessor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it much, and will give the lads all the help I can. But they\r\nwill need books to read up these new subjects, and we have not many,\r\nI fear,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Bhaer, looking much pleased, planning many fine\r\nlectures on geology, which he liked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should have a library for the\r\nspecial purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a useful sort of book, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Laurie, pointing to the\r\nvolume that lay open by the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! it tells all I want to know about insects. I had it here to\r\nsee how to fix the butterflies right. I covered it, so it is not hurt;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Dan caught it up, fearing the lender might think him careless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it here a minute;\xe2\x80\x9d and, pulling out his pencil, Mr. Laurie wrote\r\nDan's name in it, saying, as he set the book up on one of the corner\r\nshelves, where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail, \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\r\nthat is the beginning of the museum library. I'll hunt up some more\r\nbooks, and Demi shall keep them in order. Where are those jolly little\r\nbooks we used to read, Jo? 'Insect Architecture' or some such name, all\r\nabout ants having battles, and bees having queens, and crickets eating\r\nholes in our clothes and stealing milk, and larks of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garret at home. I'll have them sent out, and we will plunge into\r\nNatural History with a will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, ready for any thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't it be hard to write about such things?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nat, who hated\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt first, perhaps; but you will soon like it. If you think that hard,\r\nhow would you like to have this subject given to you, as it was to a\r\ngirl of thirteen: A conversation between Themistocles, Aristides, and\r\nPericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of\r\nDelos for the ornamentation of Athens?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\nThe boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names, and the gentlemen\r\nlaughed at the absurdity of the lesson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she write it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi, in an awe-stricken tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it, though\r\nshe was rather a bright child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to have seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I can find it for you; I went to school with her,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo\r\nlooked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was.\r\n\r\nHearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled\r\nthe boys to the thought of writing about familiar things. Wednesday\r\nafternoon was appointed for the lectures, as they preferred to call\r\nthem, for some chose to talk instead of write. Mr. Bhaer promised a\r\nportfolio in which the written productions should be kept, and Mrs.\r\nBhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThen the dirty-handed society went off the wash, followed by the\r\nProfessor, trying to calm the anxiety of Rob, who had been told by Tommy\r\nthat all water was full of invisible pollywogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like your plan very much, only don't be too generous, Teddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Bhaer, when they were left alone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know most of the boys have\r\ngot to paddle their own canoes when they leave us, and too much sitting\r\nin the lap of luxury will unfit them for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll be moderate, but do let me amuse myself. I get desperately tired\r\nof business sometimes, and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic\r\nwith your boys. I like that Dan very much, Jo. He isn't demonstrative;\r\nbut he has the eye of a hawk, and when you have tamed him a little he\r\nwill do you credit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm so glad you think so. Thank you very much for your kindness to him,\r\nespecially for this museum affair; it will keep him happy while he is\r\nlame, give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor, rough lad, and\r\nmake him love us. What did inspire you with such a beautiful, helpful\r\nidea, Teddy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bhaer, glancing back at the pleasant room, as\r\nshe turned to leave it.\r\n\r\nLaurie took both her hands in his, and answered, with a look that made\r\nher eyes fill with happy tears,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Jo! I have known what it is to be a motherless boy, and I never\r\ncan forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. HUCKLEBERRIES\r\n\r\nThere was a great clashing of tin pails, much running to and fro, and\r\nfrequent demands for something to eat, one August afternoon, for the\r\nboys were going huckleberrying, and made as much stir about it as if\r\nthey were setting out to find the North West Passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my lads, get off as quietly as you can, for Rob is safely out\r\nof the way, and won't see you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, as she tied Daisy's\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had\r\nenveloped Nan.\r\n\r\nBut the plan did not succeed, for Rob had heard the bustle, decided to\r\ngo, and prepared himself, without a thought of disappointment. The troop\r\nwas just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs\r\nwith his best hat on, a bright tin pail in his hand, and a face beaming\r\nwith satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! now we shall have a scene,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Mrs. Bhaer, who found her\r\neldest son very hard to manage at times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm all ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, and took his place in the ranks with such\r\nperfect unconsciousness of his mistake, that it really was very hard to\r\nundeceive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's too far for you, my love; stay and take care of me, for I shall be\r\nall alone,\xe2\x80\x9d began his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou've got Teddy. I'm a big boy, so I can go; you said I might when I\r\nwas bigger, and I am now,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Rob, with a cloud beginning to dim\r\nthe brightness of his happy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going up to the great pasture, and it's ever so far; we don't\r\nwant you tagging on,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jack, who did not admire the little boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't tag, I'll run and keep up. O Mamma! let me go! I want to fill\r\nmy new pail, and I'll bring 'em all to you. Please, please, I will\r\nbe good!\xe2\x80\x9d prayed Robby, looking up at his mother, so grieved and\r\ndisappointed that her heart began to fail her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my deary, you'll get so tired and hot you won't have a good time.\r\nWait till I go, and then we will stay all day, and pick as many berries\r\nas you want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never do go, you are so busy, and I'm tired of waiting. I'd rather\r\ngo and get the berries for you all myself. I love to pick 'em, and I\r\nwant to fill my new pail dreffly,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Rob.\r\n\r\nThe pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail, and\r\nthreatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries, touched\r\nall the ladies present. His mother patted the weeper on his back; Daisy\r\noffered to stay home with him; and Nan said, in her decided way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him come; I'll take care of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Franz was going I wouldn't mind, for he is very careful; but he is\r\nhaying with the father, and I'm not sure about the rest of you,\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\nMrs. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's so far,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd carry him if I was going wish I was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, dear, but you must take care of your foot. I wish I could\r\ngo. Stop a minute, I think I can manage it after all;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Bhaer\r\nran out to the steps, waving her apron wildly.\r\n\r\nSilas was just driving away in the hay-cart, but turned back, and agreed\r\nat once, when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to\r\nthe pasture, and go for them at five o'clock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will delay your work a little, but never mind; we will pay you in\r\nhuckleberry pies,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, knowing Silas's weak point.\r\n\r\nHis rough, brown face brightened up, and he said, with a cheery \xe2\x80\x9cHaw!\r\nhaw!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWal now, Mis' Bhaer, if you go to bribin' of me, I shall give in\r\nright away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boys, I have arranged it so that you can all go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer,\r\nrunning back again, much relieved, for she loved to make them happy, and\r\nalways felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little\r\nsons; for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures\r\nof children should be tenderly respected by grown-up people, and never\r\nrudely thwarted or ridiculed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I go?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, delighted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought especially of you. Be careful, and never mind the berries,\r\nbut sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all\r\nabout you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Bhaer, who remembered his kind offer to her\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too! me too!\xe2\x80\x9d sung Rob, dancing with joy, and clapping his precious\r\npail and cover like castanets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you. Be at the bars at\r\nfive o'clock, and Silas will come for you all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude, promising\r\nto bring her every berry he picked, and not eat one. Then they were all\r\npacked into the hay-cart, and went rattling away, the brightest face\r\namong the dozen being that of Rob, as he sat between his two temporary\r\nlittle mothers, beaming upon the whole world, and waving his best hat;\r\nfor his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it, since\r\nthis was a gala-day to him.\r\n\r\nSuch a happy afternoon as they had, in spite of the mishaps which\r\nusually occur on such expeditions! Of course Tommy came to grief,\r\ntumbled upon a hornet's nest and got stung; but being used to woe, he\r\nbore the smart manfully, till Dan suggested the application of damp\r\nearth, which much assuaged the pain. Daisy saw a snake, and flying from\r\nit lost half her berries; but Demi helped her to fill up again, and\r\ndiscussed reptiles most learnedly the while. Ned fell out of a tree, and\r\nsplit his jacket down the back, but suffered no other fracture. Emil and\r\nJack established rival claims to a certain thick patch, and while they\r\nwere squabbling about it, Stuffy quickly and quietly stripped the bushes\r\nand fled to the protection of Dan, who was enjoying himself immensely.\r\nThe crutch was no longer necessary, and he was delighted to see how\r\nstrong his foot felt as he roamed about the great pasture, full of\r\ninteresting rocks and stumps, with familiar little creatures in the\r\ngrass, and well-known insects dancing in the air.\r\n\r\nBut of all the adventures that happened on this afternoon that which\r\nbefell Nan and Rob was the most exciting, and it long remained one of\r\nthe favorite histories of the household. Having explored the country\r\npretty generally, torn three rents in her frock, and scratched her face\r\nin a barberry-bush, Nan began to pick the berries that shone like big,\r\nblack beads on the low, green bushes. Her nimble fingers flew, but\r\nstill her basket did not fill up as rapidly as she desired, so she kept\r\nwandering here and there to search for better places, instead of picking\r\ncontentedly and steadily as Daisy did. Rob followed Nan, for her energy\r\nsuited him better than his cousin's patience, and he too was anxious to\r\nhave the biggest and best berries for Marmar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI keep putting 'em in, but it don't fill up, and I'm so tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob, pausing a moment to rest his short legs, and beginning to think\r\nhuckleberrying was not all his fancy painted it; for the sun blazed, Nan\r\nskipped hither and thither like a grasshopper, and the berries fell out\r\nof his pail almost as fast as he put them in, because, in his struggles\r\nwith the bushes, it was often upside-down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast time we came they were ever so much thicker over that wall great\r\nbouncers; and there is a cave there where the boys made a fire. Let's go\r\nand fill our things quick, and then hide in the cave and let the others\r\nfind us,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed Nan, thirsting for adventures.\r\n\r\nRob consented, and away they went, scrambling over the wall and running\r\ndown the sloping fields on the other side, till they were hidden among\r\nthe rocks and underbrush. The berries were thick, and at last the pails\r\nwere actually full. It was shady and cool down there, and a little\r\nspring gave the thirsty children a refreshing drink out of its mossy\r\ncup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we will go and rest in the cave, and eat our lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, well\r\nsatisfied with her success so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the way?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Course I do; I've been once, and I always remember. Didn't I go and\r\nget my box all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat convinced Rob, and he followed blindly as Nan led him over stock\r\nand stone, and brought him, after much meandering, to a small recess in\r\nthe rock, where the blackened stones showed that fires had been made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, isn't it nice?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, as she took out a bit of\r\nbread-and-butter, rather damaged by being mixed up with nails,\r\nfishhooks, stones and other foreign substances, in the young lady's\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; do you think they will find us soon?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, who found the\r\nshadowy glen rather dull, and began to long for more society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't; because if I hear them, I shall hide, and have fun making\r\nthem find me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP'raps they won't come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't care; I can get home myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a great way?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, looking at his little stubby boots,\r\nscratched and wet with his long wandering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's six miles, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d Nan's ideas of distance were vague, and her\r\nfaith in her own powers great.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we better go now,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Rob, presently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan't till I have picked over my berries;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan began what seemed\r\nto Rob an endless task.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! you said you'd take good care of me,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed, as the sun\r\nseemed to drop behind the hill all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I am taking good care of you as hard as I can. Don't be cross,\r\nchild; I'll go in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who considered five-year-old\r\nRobby a mere infant compared to herself.\r\n\r\nSo little Rob sat looking anxiously about him, and waiting patiently,\r\nfor, spite of some misgivings, he felt great confidence in Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it's going to be night pretty soon,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, as if to\r\nhimself, as a mosquito bit him, and the frogs in a neighboring marsh\r\nbegan to pipe up for the evening concert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy goodness me! so it is. Come right away this minute, or they will be\r\ngone,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, looking up from her work, and suddenly perceiving that\r\nthe sun was down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a horn about an hour ago; may be they were blowing for us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Rob, trudging after his guide as she scrambled up the steep hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, stopping short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver that way;\xe2\x80\x9d he pointed with a dirty little finger in an entirely\r\nwrong direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's go that way and meet them;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan wheeled about, and began to\r\ntrot through the bushes, feeling a trifle anxious, for there were so\r\nmany cow-paths all about she could not remember which way they came.\r\n\r\nOn they went over stock and stone again, pausing now and then to listen\r\nfor the horn, which did not blow any more, for it was only the moo of a\r\ncow on her way home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't remember seeing that pile of stones do you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, as she\r\nsat on a wall to rest a moment and take an observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't remember any thing, but I want to go home,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob's voice had\r\na little tremble in it that made Nan put her arms round him and lift him\r\ngently down, saying, in her most capable way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going just as fast as I can, dear. Don't cry, and when we come to\r\nthe road, I'll carry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the road?\xe2\x80\x9d and Robby wiped his eyes to look for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver by that big tree. Don't you know that's the one Ned tumbled out\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is. May be they waited for us; I'd like to ride home wouldn't\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d and Robby brightened up as he plodded along toward the end of the\r\ngreat pasture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I'd rather walk,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nan, feeling quite sure that she would\r\nbe obliged to do so, and preparing her mind for it.\r\n\r\nAnother long trudge through the fast-deepening twilight and another\r\ndisappointment, for when they reached the tree, they found to their\r\ndismay that it was not the one Ned climbed, and no road anywhere\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre we lost?\xe2\x80\x9d quavered Rob, clasping his pail in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much. I don't just see which way to go, and I guess we'd better\r\ncall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they both shouted till they were hoarse, yet nothing answered but the\r\nfrogs in full chorus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another tall tree over there, perhaps that's the one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNan, whose heart sunk within her, though she still spoke bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think I can go any more; my boots are so heavy I can't pull\r\n'em;\xe2\x80\x9d and Robby sat down on a stone quite worn out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we must stay here all night. I don't care much, if snakes don't\r\ncome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm frightened of snakes. I can't stay all night. Oh, dear! I don't\r\nlike to be lost,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob puckered up his face to cry, when suddenly a\r\nthought occurred to him, and he said, in a tone of perfect confidence,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarmar will come and find me she always does; I ain't afraid now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won't know where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe didn't know I was shut up in the ice-house, but she found me.\r\nI know she'll come,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Robby, so trustfully, that Nan felt\r\nrelieved, and sat down by him, saying, with a remorseful sigh,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we hadn't run away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made me; but I don't mind much Marmar will love me just the same,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Rob, clinging to his sheet-anchor when all other hope was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm so hungry. Let's eat our berries,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed Nan, after a pause,\r\nduring which Rob began to nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I, but I can't eat mine, 'cause I told Marmar I'd keep them all\r\nfor her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll have to eat them if no one comes for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who felt\r\nlike contradicting every thing just then. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we stay here a great many\r\ndays, we shall eat up all the berries in the field, and then we shall\r\nstarve,\xe2\x80\x9d she added grimly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall eat sassafras. I know a big tree of it, and Dan told me how\r\nsquirrels dig up the roots and eat them, and I love to dig,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nRob, undaunted by the prospect of starvation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and we can catch frogs, and cook them. My father ate some once,\r\nand he said they were nice,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Nan, beginning to find a spice of\r\nromance even in being lost in a huckleberry pasture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could we cook frogs? we haven't got any fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know; next time I'll have matches in my pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan,\r\nrather depressed by this obstacle to the experiment in frog-cookery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn't we light a fire with a fire-fly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, hopefully, as he\r\nwatched them flitting to and fro like winged sparks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's try;\xe2\x80\x9d and several minutes were pleasantly spent in catching the\r\nflies, and trying to make them kindle a green twig or two. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a lie\r\nto call them fire-flies when there isn't a fire in them,\xe2\x80\x9d Nan said,\r\nthrowing one unhappy insect away with scorn, though it shone its best,\r\nand obligingly walked up and down the twigs to please the innocent\r\nlittle experimenters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarmar's a good while coming,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, after another pause, during\r\nwhich they watched the stars overhead, smelt the sweet fern crushed\r\nunder foot, and listened to the crickets' serenade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't see why God made any night; day is so much pleasanter,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNan, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's to sleep in,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, pettishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my own bed. Oh, I wish I could see Teddy!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, painfully\r\nreminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe your mother will ever find us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, who was\r\nbecoming desperate, for she hated patient waiting of any sort. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's so\r\ndark she won't see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all black in the ice-house, and I was so scared I didn't call\r\nher, but she saw me; and she will see me now, no matter how dark it is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n returned confiding Rob, standing up to peer into the gloom for the help\r\nwhich never failed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see her! I see her!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and ran as fast as his tired legs\r\nwould take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching. Suddenly he\r\nstopped, then turned about, and came stumbling back, screaming in a\r\ngreat panic,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it's a bear, a big black one!\xe2\x80\x9d and hid his face in Nan's skirts.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Nan quailed; ever her courage gave out at the thought of a\r\nreal bear, and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder, when a\r\nmild \xe2\x80\x9cMoo!\xe2\x80\x9d changed her fear to merriment, as she said, laughing,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a cow, Robby! the nice, black cow we saw this afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two\r\nlittle people in her pasture after dark, and the amiable beast paused to\r\ninquire into the case. She let them stroke her, and stood regarding them\r\nwith her soft eyes so mildly, that Nan, who feared no animal but a bear,\r\nwas fired with a desire to milk her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilas taught me how; and berries and milk would be so nice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nemptying the contents of her pail into her hat, and boldly beginning her\r\nnew task, while Rob stood by and repeated, at her command, the poem from\r\nMother Goose:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCushy cow, bonny, let down your milk,\r\n     Let down your milk to me,\r\n     And I will give you a gown of silk,\r\n     A gown of silk and a silver tee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the immortal rhyme had little effect, for the benevolent cow had\r\nalready been milked, and had only half a gill to give the thirsty\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShoo! get away! you are an old cross patch,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, ungratefully,\r\nas she gave up the attempt in despair; and poor Molly walked on with a\r\ngentle gurgle of surprise and reproof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEach can have a sip, and then we must take a walk. We shall go to sleep\r\nif we don't; and lost people mustn't sleep. Don't you know how Hannah\r\nLee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there isn't any snow now, and it's nice and warm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, who\r\nwas not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, we will poke about a little, and call some more; and then,\r\nif nobody comes, we will hide under the bushes, like Hop-'o-my-thumb and\r\nhis brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a very short walk, however, for Rob was so sleepy he could not\r\nget on, and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience, being\r\nhalf distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you tumble down again, I'll shake you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, lifting the poor\r\nlittle man up very kindly as she spoke, for Nan's bark was much worse\r\nthan her bite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don't. It's my boots they keep slipping so;\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob manfully\r\nchecked the sob just ready to break out, adding, with a plaintive\r\npatience that touched Nan's heart, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the skeeters didn't bite me so, I\r\ncould go to sleep till Marmar comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut your head on my lap, and I'll cover you up with my apron; I'm not\r\nafraid of the night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, sitting down and trying to persuade\r\nherself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings\r\nall about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake me up when she comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said rob, and was fast asleep in five\r\nminutes with his head in Nan's lap under the pinafore.\r\n\r\nThe little girl sat for some fifteen minutes, staring about her with\r\nanxious eyes, and feeling as if each second was an hour. Then a pale\r\nlight began to glimmer over the hill-top and she said to herself,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess the night is over and morning is coming. I'd like to see the\r\nsun rise, so I'll watch, and when it comes up we can find our way right\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut before the moon's round face peeped above the hill to destroy her\r\nhope, Nan had fallen asleep, leaning back in a little bower of tall\r\nferns, and was deep in a mid-summer night's dream of fire-flies and blue\r\naprons, mountains of huckleberries, and Robby wiping away the tears of a\r\nblack cow, who sobbed, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to go home! I want to go home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the children were sleeping, peacefully lulled by the drowsy hum of\r\nmany neighborly mosquitoes, the family at home were in a great state of\r\nagitation. The hay-cart came at five, and all but Jack, Emil, Nan, and\r\nRob were at the bars ready for it. Franz drove instead of Silas, and\r\nwhen the boys told him that the others were going home through the wood,\r\nhe said, looking ill-pleased, \xe2\x80\x9cThey ought to have left Rob to ride, he\r\nwill be tired out by the long walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's shorter that way, and they will carry him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy, who was\r\nin a hurry for his supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are sure Nan and Rob went with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they did; I saw them getting over the wall, and sung out that\r\nit was most five, and Jack called back that they were going the other\r\nway,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, pile in then,\xe2\x80\x9d and away rattled the hay-cart with the tired\r\nchildren and the full pails.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo looked sober when she heard of the division of the party, and\r\nsent Franz back with Toby to find and bring the little ones home. Supper\r\nwas over, and the family sitting about in the cool hall as usual, when\r\nFranz came trotting back, hot, dusty, and anxious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they come?\xe2\x80\x9d he called out when half-way up the avenue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo flew out of her chair looking so alarmed that every\r\none jumped up and gathered round Franz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't find them anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he began; but the words were hardly spoken\r\nwhen a loud \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d startled them all, and the next minute Jack and\r\nEmil came round the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are Nan and Rob?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Jo, clutching Emil in a way that\r\ncaused him to think his aunt had suddenly lost her wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know. They came home with the others, didn't they?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nanswered, quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; George and Tommy said they went with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they didn't. Haven't seen them. We took a swim in the pond, and\r\ncame by the wood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack, looking alarmed, as well he might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Mr. Bhaer, get the lanterns, and tell Silas I want him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all Mrs. Jo said, but they knew what she meant, and flew to\r\nobey her orders. In ten minutes, Mr. Bhaer and Silas were off to the\r\nwood, and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great\r\npasture. Mrs. Jo caught up some food from the table, a little bottle of\r\nbrandy from the medicine-closet, took a lantern, and bidding Jack and\r\nEmil come with her, and the rest not stir, she trotted away on Toby,\r\nnever stopping for hat or shawl. She heard some one running after her,\r\nbut said not a word till, as she paused to call and listen, the light of\r\nher lantern shone on Dan's face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou here! I told Jack to come,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, half-inclined to send him\r\nback, much as she needed help.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn't let him; he and Emil hadn't had any supper, and I wanted\r\nto come more than they did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking the lantern from her and\r\nsmiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her\r\nfeel as if, boy though he was, she had some one to depend on.\r\n\r\nOff she jumped, and ordered him on to Toby, in spite of his pleading to\r\nwalk; then they went on again along the dusty, solitary road, stopping\r\nevery now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the great pasture, other lights were already flitting\r\nto and fro like will-o'-the-wisps, and Mr. Bhaer's voice was heard\r\nshouting, \xe2\x80\x9cNan! Rob! Rob! Nan!\xe2\x80\x9d in every part of the field. Silas\r\nwhistled and roared, Dan plunged here and there on Toby, who seemed\r\nto understand the case, and went over the roughest places with unusual\r\ndocility. Often Mrs. Jo hushed them all, saying, with a sob in her\r\nthroat, \xe2\x80\x9cThe noise may frighten them, let me call; Robby will know my\r\nvoice;\xe2\x80\x9d and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone\r\nof tenderness, till the very echoes whispered it softly, and the winds\r\nseemed to waft it willingly; but still no answer came.\r\n\r\nThe sky was overcast now, and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen,\r\nheat-lightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then, and a faint\r\nfar-off rumble as of thunder told that a summer-storm was brewing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my Robby! my Robby!\xe2\x80\x9d mourned poor Mrs. Jo, wandering up and down like\r\na pale ghost, while Dan kept beside her like a faithful fire-fly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshall I say to Nan's father if she comes to harm? Why did I ever trust\r\nmy darling so far away? Fritz, do you hear any thing?\xe2\x80\x9d and when a\r\nmournful, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d came back, she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan\r\nsprung down from Toby's back, tied the bridle to the bars, and said, in\r\nhis decided way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey may have gone down the spring I'm going to look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him;\r\nbut when she reached the spot, he lowered the lantern and showed her\r\nwith joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring.\r\nShe fell down on her knees to examine the tracks, and then sprung up,\r\nsaying eagerly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that is the mark of my Robby's little boots! Come this way, they\r\nmust have gone on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch a weary search! But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead\r\nthe anxious mother, for presently Dan uttered a cry, and caught up a\r\nlittle shining object lying in the path. It was the cover of the new\r\ntin pail, dropped in the first alarm of being lost. Mrs. Jo hugged and\r\nkissed it as if it were a living thing; and when Dan was about to utter\r\na glad shout to bring the others to the spot, she stopped him, saying,\r\nas she hurried on, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, let me find them; I let Rob go, and I want to\r\ngive him back to his father all myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little farther on Nan's hat appeared, and after passing the place\r\nmore than once, they came at last upon the babes in the wood, both sound\r\nasleep. Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his\r\nlantern shone that night. He thought Mrs. Jo would cry out, but she\r\nonly whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d as she softly lifted away the apron, and saw the\r\nlittle ruddy face below. The berry-stained lips were half-open as the\r\nbreath came and went, the yellow hair lay damp on the hot forehead, and\r\nboth the chubby hands held fast the little pail still full.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the childish harvest, treasured through all the troubles of\r\nthat night for her, seemed to touch Mrs. Jo to the heart, for suddenly\r\nshe gathered up her boy, and began to cry over him, so tenderly, yet\r\nso heartily, that he woke up, and at first seemed bewildered. Then he\r\nremembered, and hugged her close, saying with a laugh of triumph,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you'd come! O Marmar! I did want you so!\xe2\x80\x9d For a moment they\r\nkissed and clung to one another, quite forgetting all the world; for no\r\nmatter how lost and soiled and worn-out wandering sons may be, mothers\r\ncan forgive and forget every thing as they fold them in their fostering\r\narms. Happy the son whose faith in his mother remains unchanged, and\r\nwho, through all his wanderings, has kept some filial token to repay her\r\nbrave and tender love.\r\n\r\nDan meantime picked Nan out of her bush, and, with a gentleness none but\r\nTeddy ever saw in him before, he soothed her first alarm at the sudden\r\nwaking, and wiped away her tears; for Nan also began to cry for joy,\r\nit was so good to see a kind face and feel a strong arm round her after\r\nwhat seemed to her ages of loneliness and fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little girl, don't cry! You are all safe now, and no one\r\nshall say a word of blame to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, taking Nan into her\r\ncapacious embrace, and cuddling both children as a hen might gather her\r\nlost chickens under her motherly wings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my fault; but I am sorry. I tried to take care of him, and I\r\ncovered him up and let him sleep, and didn't touch his berries, though I\r\nwas so hungry; and I never will do it again truly, never, never,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed\r\nNan, quite lost in a sea of penitence and thankfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall them now, and let us get home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo; and Dan, getting\r\nupon the wall, sent a joyful word \xe2\x80\x9cFound!\xe2\x80\x9d ringing over the field.\r\n\r\nHow the wandering lights came dancing from all sides, and gathered\r\nround the little group among the sweet fern bushes! Such a hugging,\r\nand kissing, and talking, and crying, as went on must have amazed the\r\nglowworms, and evidently delighted the mosquitoes, for they hummed\r\nfrantically, while the little moths came in flocks to the party, and\r\nthe frogs croaked as if they could not express their satisfaction loudly\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThen they set out for home, a queer party, for Franz rode on to tell\r\nthe news; Dan and Toby led the way; then came Nan in the strong arms of\r\nSilas, who considered her \xe2\x80\x9cthe smartest little baggage he ever saw,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nteased her all the way home about her pranks. Mrs. Bhaer would let no\r\none carry Rob but himself, and the little fellow, refreshed by sleep,\r\nsat up, and chattered gayly, feeling himself a hero, while his mother\r\nwent beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that\r\ncame handy, and never tired of hearing him say, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew Marmar would\r\ncome,\xe2\x80\x9d or seeing him lean down to kiss her, and put a plump berry into\r\nher mouth, \xe2\x80\x9c'Cause he picked 'em all for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon shone out just as they reached the avenue, and all the boys\r\ncame shouting to meet them, so the lost lambs were borne in triumph\r\nand safety, and landed in the dining-room, where the unromantic little\r\nthings demanded supper instead of preferring kisses and caresses. They\r\nwere set down to bread and milk, while the entire household stood round\r\nto gaze upon them. Nan soon recovered her spirits, and recounted her\r\nperils with a relish now that they were all over. Rob seemed absorbed in\r\nhis food, but put down his spoon all of a sudden, and set up a doleful\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy precious, why do you cry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mother, who still hung over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm crying 'cause I was lost,\xe2\x80\x9d bawled Rob, trying to squeeze out a\r\ntear, and failing entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are found now. Nan says you didn't cry out in the field, and I\r\nwas glad you were such a brave boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so busy being frightened I didn't have any time then. But I want\r\nto cry now, 'cause I don't like to be lost,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Rob, struggling\r\nwith sleep, emotion, and a mouthful of bread and milk.\r\n\r\nThe boys set up such a laugh at this funny way of making up for lost\r\ntime, that Rob stopped to look at them, and the merriment was so\r\ninfectious, that after a surprised stare he burst out into a merry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d and beat his spoon upon the table as if he enjoyed the joke\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is ten o'clock; into bed, every man of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, looking\r\nat his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, thank Heaven! there will be no empty ones to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mrs.\r\nBhaer, watching, with full eyes, Robby going up in his father's\r\narms, and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi, who considered her the most\r\ninteresting heroine of their collection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\ngentle Franz, putting his arm round her as she paused at the stair-foot,\r\nlooking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's make an arm-chair,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, my lads; but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe! me!\xe2\x80\x9d and half-a-dozen jostled one another, all eager to be chosen,\r\nfor there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm\r\nhearts under the round jackets.\r\n\r\nSeeing that they considered it an honor, Mrs. Jo gave it to the one who\r\nhad earned it, and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dan's broad\r\nshoulder, saying, with a look that made him color up with pride and\r\npleasure,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe found the children; so I think he must help me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan felt richly rewarded for his evening's work, not only that he was\r\nchosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp, but because\r\nMrs. Jo said heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, my boy! God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d as he left\r\nher at her door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was your boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, who felt as if danger and trouble had\r\nsomehow brought him nearer than ever to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall be my oldest son,\xe2\x80\x9d and she sealed her promise with a kiss\r\nthat made Dan hers entirely.\r\n\r\nLittle Rob was all right next day, but Nan had a headache, and lay on\r\nMother Bhaer's sofa with cold-cream upon her scratched face. Her remorse\r\nwas quite gone, and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine\r\namusement. Mrs. Jo was not pleased with this state of things, and had no\r\ndesire to have her children led from the paths of virtue, or her pupils\r\nlying round loose in huckleberry fields. So she talked soberly to Nan,\r\nand tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and\r\nlicense, telling several tales to enforce her lecture. She had not\r\ndecided how to punish Nan, but one of these stories suggested a way, and\r\nas Mrs. Jo liked odd penalties, she tried it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll children run away,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Nan, as if it was as natural and\r\nnecessary a thing as measles or hooping cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all, and some who do run away don't get found again,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs.\r\nJo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn't you do it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, whose keen little eyes saw some\r\ntraces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo laughed, and owned that she did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about it,\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Nan, feeling that she was getting the upper\r\nhand in the discussion.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo saw that, and sobered down at once, saying, with a remorseful\r\nshake of the head,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it a good many times, and led my poor mother rather a hard life\r\nwith my pranks, till she cured me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan sat up with a face full of interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a new pair of shoes once, and wanted to show them; so, though I\r\nwas told not to leave the garden, I ran away and was wandering about all\r\nday. It was in the city, and why I wasn't killed I don't know. Such a\r\ntime as I had. I frolicked in the park with dogs, sailed boats in the\r\nBack Bay with strange boys, dined with a little Irish beggar-girl on\r\nsalt fish and potatoes, and was found at last fast asleep on a door-step\r\nwith my arms round a great dog. It was late in the evening, and I was a\r\ndirty as a little pig, and the new shoes were worn out I had travelled\r\nso far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow nice!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, looking all ready to go and do it herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not nice next day;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo tried to keep her eyes from\r\nbetraying how much she enjoyed the memory of her early capers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your mother whip you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, curiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never whipped me but once, and then she begged my pardon, or I\r\ndon't think I ever should have forgiven her, it hurt my feelings so\r\nmuch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did she beg your pardon? my father don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, when she had done it, I turned round and said, 'Well, you are\r\nmad yourself, and ought to be whipped as much as me.' She looked at me\r\na minute, then her anger all died out, and she said, as if ashamed, 'You\r\nare right, Jo, I am angry; and why should I punish you for being in a\r\npassion when I set you such a bad example? Forgive me, dear, and let us\r\ntry to help one another in a better way.' I never forgot it, and it did\r\nme more good than a dozen rods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNan sat thoughtfully turning the little cold-cream jar for a minute, and\r\nMrs. Jo said nothing, but let that idea get well into the busy little\r\nmind that was so quick to see and feel what went on about her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, presently, and her face looked less elfish,\r\nwith its sharp eyes, inquisitive nose, and mischievous mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did\r\nyour mother do to you when you ran away that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tied me to the bed-post with a long string, so that I could not\r\ngo out of the room, and there I stayed all day with the little worn-out\r\nshoes hanging up before me to remind me of my fault.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think that would cure anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, who loved her\r\nliberty above all things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did cure me, and I think it will you, so I am going to try it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Jo, suddenly taking a ball of strong twine out of a drawer in her\r\nwork-table.\r\n\r\nNan looked as if she was decidedly getting the worst of the argument\r\nnow, and sat feeling much crestfallen while Mrs. Jo tied one end round\r\nher waist and the other to the arm of the sofa, saying, as she finished,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't like to tie you up like a naughty little dog, but if you don't\r\nremember any better than a dog, I must treat you like one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd just as lief be tied up as not I like to play dog;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan put on\r\na don't-care face, and began to growl and grovel on the floor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo took no notice, but leaving a book or two and a handkerchief to\r\nhem, she went away, and left Miss Nan to her own devices. This was not\r\nagreeable, and after sitting a moment she tried to untie the cord. But\r\nit was fastened in the belt of her apron behind, so she began on the\r\nknot at the other end. It soon came loose, and, gathering it up, Nan was\r\nabout to get out of the window, when she heard Mrs. Jo say to somebody\r\nas she passed through the hall,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't think she will run away now; she is an honorable little\r\ngirl, and knows that I do it to help her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a minute, Nan whisked back, tied herself up, and began to sew\r\nviolently. Rob came in a moment after, and was so charmed with the new\r\npunishment, that he got a jump-rope and tethered himself to the other\r\narm of the sofa in the most social manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got lost too, so I ought to be tied up as much as Nan,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained\r\nto his mother when she saw the new captive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm not sure that you don't deserve a little punishment, for you knew\r\nit was wrong to go far away from the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNan took me,\xe2\x80\x9d began Rob, willing to enjoy the novel penalty, but not\r\nwilling to take the blame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn't have gone. You have got a conscience, though you are a\r\nlittle boy, and you must learn to mind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my conscience didn't prick me a bit when she said 'Let's get over\r\nthe wall,'\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob, quoting one of Demi's expressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you stop to see if it did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you cannot tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it's such a little conscience that it don't prick hard enough\r\nfor me to feel it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Rob, after thinking the matter over for a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must sharpen it up. It's bad to have a dull conscience; so you may\r\nstay here till dinner-time, and talk about it with Nan. I trust you both\r\nnot to untie yourselves till I say the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we won't,\xe2\x80\x9d said both, feeling a certain sense of virtue in helping\r\nto punish themselves.\r\n\r\nFor an hour they were very good, then they grew tired of one room,\r\nand longed to get out. Never had the hall seemed so inviting; even the\r\nlittle bedroom acquired a sudden interest, and they would gladly have\r\ngone in and played tent with the curtains of the best bed. The open\r\nwindows drove them wild because they could not reach them; and the outer\r\nworld seemed so beautiful, they wondered how they ever found the\r\nheart to say it was dull. Nan pined for a race round the lawn, and Rob\r\nremembered with dismay that he had not fed his dog that morning, and\r\nwondered what poor Pollux would do. They watched the clock, and Nan did\r\nsome nice calculations in minutes and seconds, while Rob learned to tell\r\nall the hours between eight and one so well that he never forgot them.\r\nIt was maddening to smell the dinner, to know that there was to be\r\nsuccotash and huckleberry pudding, and to feel that they would not be\r\non the spot to secure good helps of both. When Mary Ann began to set the\r\ntable, they nearly cut themselves in two trying to see what meat there\r\nwas to be; and Nan offered to help her make the beds, if she would only\r\nsee that she had \xe2\x80\x9clots of sauce on her pudding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the boys came bursting out of school, they found the children\r\ntugging at their halters like a pair of restive little colts, and\r\nwere much edified, as well as amused, by the sequel to the exciting\r\nadventures of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntie me now, Marmar; my conscience will prick like a pin next time, I\r\nknow it will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rob, as the bell rang, and Teddy came to look at him\r\nwith sorrowful surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d answered his mother, setting him free. He took a good\r\nrun down the hall, back through the dining-room, and brought up beside\r\nNan, quite beaming with virtuous satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll bring her dinner to her, may I?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pitying his\r\nfellow-captive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's my kind little son! Yes, pull out the table, and get a chair;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Mrs. Jo hurried away to quell the ardor of the others, who were\r\nalways in a raging state of hunger at noon.\r\n\r\nNan ate alone, and spent a long afternoon attached to the sofa. Mrs.\r\nBhaer lengthened her bonds so that she could look out of the window;\r\nand there she stood watching the boys play, and all the little summer\r\ncreatures enjoying their liberty. Daisy had a picnic for the dolls on\r\nthe lawn, so that Nan might see the fun if she could not join in it.\r\nTommy turned his best somersaults to console her; Demi sat on the steps\r\nreading aloud to himself, which amused Nan a good deal; and Dan brought\r\na little tree-toad to show her as the most delicate attention in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBut nothing atoned for the loss of freedom; and a few hours of\r\nconfinement taught Nan how precious it was. A good many thoughts went\r\nthrough the little head that lay on the window-sill during the last\r\nquiet hour when all the children went to the brook to see Emil's new\r\nship launched. She was to have christened it, and had depended on\r\nsmashing a tiny bottle of currant-wine over the prow as it was named\r\nJosephine in honor of Mrs. Bhaer. Now she had lost her chance, and Daisy\r\nwouldn't do it half so well. Tears rose to her eyes as she remembered\r\nthat it was all her own fault; and she said aloud, addressing a fat\r\nbee who was rolling about in the yellow heart of a rose just under the\r\nwindow,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have run away, you'd better go right home, and tell your mother\r\nyou are sorry, and never do so any more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear you give him such good advice, and I think he has\r\ntaken it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, smiling, as the bee spread his dusty wings and\r\nflew away.\r\n\r\nNan brushed off a bright drop or two that shone on the window-sill, and\r\nnestled against her friend as she took her on her knee, adding kindly\r\nfor she had seen the little drops, and knew what they meant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think my mother's cure for running away a good one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma'am,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nan, quite subdued by her quiet day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I shall not have to try it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess not;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan looked up with such an earnest little face that\r\nMrs. Jo felt satisfied, and said no more, for she liked to have her\r\npenalties do their own work, and did not spoil the effect by too much\r\nmoralizing.\r\n\r\nHere Rob appeared, bearing with infinite care what Asia called a \xe2\x80\x9csarcer\r\npie,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning one baked in a saucer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's made out of some of my berries, and I'm going to give you half at\r\nsupper-time,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced with a flourish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you, when I'm so naughty?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, meekly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we got lost together. You ain't going to be naughty again, are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, with great decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, goody! now let's go and get Mary Ann to cut this for us all ready\r\nto eat; it's 'most tea time;\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob beckoned with the delicious little\r\npie.\r\n\r\nNan started to follow, then stopped, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot, I can't go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, who had quietly untied the cord sash\r\nwhile she had been talking.\r\n\r\nNan saw that she was free, and with one tempestuous kiss to Mrs. Jo, she\r\nwas off like a humming-bird, followed by Robby, dribbling huckleberry\r\njuice as he ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. GOLDILOCKS\r\n\r\nAfter the last excitement peace descended upon Plumfield and reigned\r\nunbroken for several weeks, for the elder boys felt that the loss of Nan\r\nand Rob lay at their door, and all became so paternal in their care\r\nthat they were rather wearying; while the little ones listened to Nan's\r\nrecital of her perils so many times, that they regarded being lost as\r\nthe greatest ill humanity was heir to, and hardly dared to put their\r\nlittle noses outside the great gate lest night should suddenly descend\r\nupon them, and ghostly black cows come looming through the dusk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too good to last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo; for years of boy-culture had\r\ntaught her that such lulls were usually followed by outbreaks of some\r\nsort, and when less wise women would have thought that the boys had\r\nbecome confirmed saints, she prepared herself for a sudden eruption of\r\nthe domestic volcano.\r\n\r\nOne cause of this welcome calm was a visit from little Bess, whose\r\nparents lent her for a week while they were away with Grandpa Laurence,\r\nwho was poorly. The boys regarded Goldilocks as a mixture of child,\r\nangel, and fairy, for she was a lovely little creature, and the golden\r\nhair which she inherited from her blonde mamma enveloped her like\r\na shining veil, behind which she smiled upon her worshippers when\r\ngracious, and hid herself when offended. Her father would not have it\r\ncut and it hung below her waist, so soft and fine and bright, that Demi\r\ninsisted that it was silk spun from a cocoon. Every one praised the\r\nlittle Princess, but it did not seem to do her harm, only to teach her\r\nthat her presence brought sunshine, her smiles made answering smiles\r\non other faces, and her baby griefs filled every heart with tenderest\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, she did her young subjects more good than many a real\r\nsovereign, for her rule was very gentle and her power was felt rather\r\nthan seen. Her natural refinement made her dainty in all things, and\r\nhad a good effect upon the careless lads about her. She would let no one\r\ntouch her roughly or with unclean hands, and more soap was used during\r\nher visits than at any other time, because the boys considered it the\r\nhighest honor to be allowed to carry her highness, and the deepest\r\ndisgrace to be repulsed with the disdainful command, \xe2\x80\x9cDo away, dirty\r\nboy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLour voices displeased her and quarrelling frightened her; so gentler\r\ntones came into the boyish voices as they addressed her, and squabbles\r\nwere promptly suppressed in her presence by lookers-on if the principles\r\ncould not restrain themselves. She liked to be waited on, and the\r\nbiggest boys did her little errands without a murmur, while the small\r\nlads were her devoted slaves in all things. They begged to be allowed to\r\ndraw her carriage, bear her berry-basket, or pass her plate at table.\r\nNo service was too humble, and Tommy and Ned came to blows before they\r\ncould decide which should have the honor of blacking her little boots.\r\n\r\nNan was especially benefited by a week in the society of a well-bred\r\nlady, though such a very small one; for Bess would look at her with\r\na mixture of wonder and alarm in her great blue eyes when the hoyden\r\nscreamed and romped; and she shrunk from her as if she thought her a\r\nsort of wild animal. Warm-hearted Nan felt this very much. She said at\r\nfirst, \xe2\x80\x9cPooh! I don't care!\xe2\x80\x9d But she did care, and was so hurt when Bess\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI love my tuzzin best, tause she is twiet,\xe2\x80\x9d that she shook poor\r\nDaisy till her teeth chattered in her head, and then fled to the barn\r\nto cry dismally. In that general refuge for perturbed spirits she found\r\ncomfort and good counsel from some source or other. Perhaps the swallows\r\nfrom their mud-built nests overhead twittered her a little lecture on\r\nthe beauty of gentleness. However that might have been, she came out\r\nquite subdued, and carefully searched the orchard for a certain kind\r\nof early apple that Bess liked because it was sweet and small and rosy.\r\nArmed with this peace-offering, she approached the little Princess, and\r\nhumbly presented it. To her great joy it was graciously accepted, and\r\nwhen Daisy gave Nan a forgiving kiss, Bess did likewise, as if she felt\r\nthat she had been too severe, and desired to apologize. After this they\r\nplayed pleasantly together, and Nan enjoyed the royal favor for days.\r\nTo be sure she felt a little like a wild bird in a pretty cage at first,\r\nand occasionally had to slip out to stretch her wings in a long flight,\r\nor to sing at the top of her voice, where neither would disturb the\r\nplump turtle-dove Daisy, nor the dainty golden canary Bess. But it did\r\nher good; for, seeing how every one loved the little Princess for her\r\nsmall graces and virtues, she began to imitate her, because Nan wanted\r\nmuch love, and tried hard to win it.\r\n\r\nNot a boy in the house but felt the pretty child's influence, and was\r\nimproved by it without exactly knowing how or why, for babies can\r\nwork miracles in the hearts that love them. Poor Billy found infinite\r\nsatisfaction in staring at her, and though she did not like it she\r\npermitted without a frown, after she had been made to understand that he\r\nwas not quite like the others, and on that account must be more kindly\r\ntreated. Dick and Dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles, the only\r\nthing they knew how to make, and she accepted but never used them. Rob\r\nserved her like a little lover, and Teddy followed her like a pet dog.\r\nJack she did not like, because he was afflicted with warts and had a\r\nharsh voice. Stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily, and\r\nGeorge tried hard not to gobble, that he might not disgust the dainty\r\nlittle lady opposite. Ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when\r\nhe was discovered tormenting some unhappy field-mice. Goldilocks could\r\nnever forget the sad spectacle, and retired behind her veil when he\r\napproached, waving him away with an imperious little hand, and crying,\r\nin a tone of mingled grief and anger,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I tarn't love him; he tut the poor mouses' little tails off, and\r\nthey queeked!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy promptly abdicated when Bess came, and took the humble post of\r\nchief cook, while Nan was first maid of honor; Emil was chancellor\r\nof the exchequer, and spent the public monies lavishly in getting up\r\nspectacles that cost whole ninepences. Franz was prime minister, and\r\ndirected her affairs of state, planned royal progresses through the\r\nkingdom, and kept foreign powers in order. Demi was her philosopher, and\r\nfared much better than such gentlemen usually do among crowned heads.\r\nDan was her standing army, and defended her territories gallantly; Tommy\r\nwas court fool, and Nat a tuneful Rizzio to this innocent little Mary.\r\n\r\nUncle Fritz and Aunt Jo enjoyed this peaceful episode, and looked on\r\nat the pretty play in which the young folk unconsciously imitated their\r\nelders, without adding the tragedy that is so apt to spoil the dramas\r\nacted on the larger stage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey teach us quite as much as we teach them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless the dears! they never guess how many hints they give us as to the\r\nbest way of managing them,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you were right about the good effect of having girls among the\r\nboys. Nan has stirred up Daisy, and Bess is teaching the little bears\r\nhow to behave better than we can. If this reformation goes on as it\r\nhas begun, I shall soon feel like Dr. Blimber with his model young\r\ngentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor, laughing, as he saw Tommy not only remove\r\nhis own hat, but knock off Ned's also, as they entered the hall where\r\nthe Princess was taking a ride on the rocking-horse, attended by Rob\r\nand Teddy astride of chairs, and playing gallant knights to the best of\r\ntheir ability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never be a Blimber, Fritz, you couldn't do it if you tried;\r\nand our boys will never submit to the forcing process of that famous\r\nhot-bed. No fear that they will be too elegant: American boys like\r\nliberty too well. But good manners they cannot fail to have, if we give\r\nthem the kindly spirit that shines through the simplest demeanor, making\r\nit courteous and cordial, like yours, my dear old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTut! tut! we will not compliment; for if I begin you will run away, and\r\nI have a wish to enjoy this happy half hour to the end;\xe2\x80\x9d yet Mr. Bhaer\r\nlooked pleased with the compliment, for it was true, and Mrs. Jo felt\r\nthat she had received the best her husband could give her, by saying\r\nthat he found his truest rest and happiness in her society.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo return to the children: I have just had another proof of Goldilocks'\r\ngood influence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, drawing her chair nearer the sofa,\r\nwhere the Professor lay resting after a long day's work in his various\r\ngardens. \xe2\x80\x9cNan hates sewing, but for love of Bess has been toiling half\r\nthe afternoon over a remarkable bag in which to present a dozen of our\r\nlove-apples to her idol when she goes. I praised her for it, and she\r\nsaid, in her quick way, 'I like to sew for other people; it is stupid\r\nsewing for myself.' I took the hint, and shall give her some little\r\nshirts and aprons for Mrs. Carney's children. She is so generous, she\r\nwill sew her fingers sore for them, and I shall not have to make a task\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut needlework is not a fashionable accomplishment, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSorry for it. My girls shall learn all I can teach them about it,\r\neven if they give up the Latin, Algebra, and half-a-dozen ologies it\r\nis considered necessary for girls to muddle their poor brains over\r\nnow-a-days. Amy means to make Bess an accomplished woman, but the dear's\r\nmite of a forefinger has little pricks on it already, and her mother has\r\nseveral specimens of needlework which she values more than the clay bird\r\nwithout a bill, that filled Laurie with such pride when Bess made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI also have proof of the Princess's power,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bhaer, after he\r\nhad watched Mrs. Jo sew on a button with an air of scorn for the whole\r\nsystem of fashionable education. \xe2\x80\x9cJack is so unwilling to be classed\r\nwith Stuffy and Ned, as distasteful to Bess, that he came to me a little\r\nwhile ago, and asked me to touch his warts with caustic. I have often\r\nproposed it, and he never would consent; but now he bore the smart\r\nmanfully, and consoles his present discomfort by hopes of future favor,\r\nwhen he can show her fastidious ladyship a smooth hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer laughed at the story, and just then Stuffy came in to ask if\r\nhe might give Goldilocks some of the bonbons his mother had sent him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not allowed to eat sweeties; but if you like to give her the\r\npretty box with the pink sugar-rose in it, she would like it very much,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Jo, unwilling to spoil this unusual piece of self-denial, for\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cfat boy\xe2\x80\x9d seldom offered to share his sugar-plums.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't she eat it? I shouldn't like to make her sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy,\r\neyeing the delicate sweetmeat lovingly, yet putting it into the box.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, she won't touch it, if I tell her it is to look at, not to eat.\r\nShe will keep it for weeks, and never think of tasting it. Can you do as\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should hope so! I'm ever so much older than she is,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Stuffy,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, suppose we try. Here, put your bonbons in this bag, and see how\r\nlong you can keep them. Let me count two hearts, four red fishes, three\r\nbarley-sugar horses, nine almonds, and a dozen chocolate drops. Do you\r\nagree to that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked sly Mrs. Jo, popping the sweeties into her little\r\nspool-bag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy, with a sigh; and pocketing the forbidden fruit,\r\nhe went away to give Bess the present, that won a smile from her, and\r\npermission to escort her round the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Stuffy's heart has really got the better of his stomach at last,\r\nand his efforts will be much encouraged by the rewards Bess gives him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy is the man who can put temptation in his pocket and learn\r\nself-denial from so sweet a little teacher!\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Bhaer, as\r\nthe children passed the window, Stuffy's fat face full of placid\r\nsatisfaction, and Goldilocks surveying her sugar-rose with polite\r\ninterest, though she would have preferred a real flower with a \xe2\x80\x9cpitty\r\nsmell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen her father came to take her home, a universal wail arose, and the\r\nparting gifts showered upon her increased her luggage to such an extent\r\nthat Mr. Laurie proposed having out the big wagon to take it into town.\r\nEvery one had given her something; and it was found difficult to pack\r\nwhite mice, cake, a parcel of shells, apples, a rabbit kicking violently\r\nin a bag, a large cabbage for his refreshment, a bottle of minnows, and\r\na mammoth bouquet. The farewell scene was moving, for the Princess sat\r\nupon the hall-table, surrounded by her subjects. She kissed her cousins,\r\nand held out her hand to the other boys, who shook it gently with\r\nvarious soft speeches, for they were taught not to be ashamed of showing\r\ntheir emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome again soon, little dear,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Dan, fastening his best\r\ngreen-and-gold beetle in her hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't forget me, Princess, whatever you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engaging Tommy,\r\ntaking a last stroke of the pretty hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming to your house next week, and then I shall see you, Bess,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added Nat, as if he found consolation in the thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo shake hands now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jack, offering a smooth paw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are two nice new ones to remember us by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dick and Dolly,\r\npresenting fresh whistles, quite unconscious that seven old ones had\r\nbeen privately deposited in the kitchen-stove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little precious! I shall work you a book-mark right away, and you\r\nmust keep it always,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, with a warm embrace.\r\n\r\nBut of all the farewells, poor Billy's was the most pathetic, for the\r\nthought that she was really going became so unbearable that he cast\r\nhimself down before her, hugging her little blue boots and blubbering\r\ndespairingly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't go away! oh, don't!\xe2\x80\x9d Goldilocks was so touched by\r\nthis burst of feeling, that she leaned over and lifting the poor lad's\r\nhead, said, in her soft, little voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't cry, poor Billy! I will tiss you and tum adain soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis promise consoled Billy, and he fell back beaming with pride at the\r\nunusual honor conferred upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too! me too!\xe2\x80\x9d clamored Dick and Dolly, feeling that their devotion\r\ndeserved some return. The others looked as if they would like to join\r\nin the cry; and something in the kind, merry faces about her moved the\r\nPrincess to stretch out her arms and say, with reckless condescension,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tiss evvybody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike a swarm of bees about a very sweet flower, the affectionate lads\r\nsurrounded their pretty playmate, and kissed her till she looked like a\r\nlittle rose, not roughly, but so enthusiastically that nothing but the\r\ncrown of her hat was visible for a moment. Then her father rescued her,\r\nand she drove away still smiling and waving her hands, while the boys\r\nsat on the fence screaming like a flock of guinea-fowls, \xe2\x80\x9cCome back!\r\ncome back!\xe2\x80\x9d till she was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThey all missed her, and each dimly felt that he was better for having\r\nknown a creature so lovely, delicate, and sweet; for little Bess\r\nappealed to the chivalrous instinct in them as something to love,\r\nadmire, and protect with a tender sort of reverence. Many a man\r\nremembers some pretty child who has made a place in his heart and kept\r\nher memory alive by the simple magic of her innocence; these little men\r\nwere just learning to feel this power, and to love it for its gentle\r\ninfluence, not ashamed to let the small hand lead them, nor to own their\r\nloyalty to womankind, even in the bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. DAMON AND PYTHIAS\r\n\r\nMrs. Bhaer was right; peace was only a temporary lull, a storm was\r\nbrewing, and two days after Bess left, a moral earthquake shook\r\nPlumfield to its centre.\r\n\r\nTommy's hens were at the bottom of the trouble, for if they had not\r\npersisted in laying so many eggs, he could not have sold them and made\r\nsuch sums. Money is the root of all evil, and yet it is such a useful\r\nroot that we cannot get on without it any more than we can without\r\npotatoes. Tommy certainly could not, for he spent his income so\r\nrecklessly, that Mr. Bhaer was obliged to insist on a savings-bank, and\r\npresented him with a private one an imposing tin edifice, with the name\r\nover the door, and a tall chimney, down which the pennies were to\r\ngo, there to rattle temptingly till leave was given to open a sort of\r\ntrap-door in the floor.\r\n\r\nThe house increased in weight so rapidly, that Tommy soon became\r\nsatisfied with his investment, and planned to buy unheard-of treasures\r\nwith his capital. He kept account of the sums deposited, and was\r\npromised that he might break the bank as soon as he had five dollars,\r\non condition that he spent the money wisely. Only one dollar was needed,\r\nand the day Mrs. Jo paid him for four dozen eggs, he was so delighted,\r\nthat he raced off to the barn to display the bright quarters to Nat, who\r\nwas also laying by money for the long-desired violin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had 'em to put with my three dollars, then I'd soon get enough\r\nto buy my fiddle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking wistfully at the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP'raps I'll lend you some. I haven't decided yet what I'll do with\r\nmine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, tossing up his quarters and catching them as they\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! boys! come down to the brook and see what a jolly great snake Dan's\r\ngot!\xe2\x80\x9d called a voice from behind the barn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy; and, laying his money inside the old winnowing\r\nmachine, away he ran, followed by Nat.\r\n\r\nThe snake was very interesting, and then a long chase after a lame\r\ncrow, and its capture, so absorbed Tommy's mind and time, that he never\r\nthought of his money till he was safely in bed that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, no one but Nat knows where it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the easy-going lad,\r\nand fell asleep untroubled by any anxiety about his property.\r\n\r\nNext morning, just as the boys assembled for school, Tommy rushed into\r\nthe room breathlessly, demanding,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, who has got my dollar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Franz.\r\n\r\nTommy explained, and Nat corroborated his statement.\r\n\r\nEvery one else declared they knew nothing about it, and began to look\r\nsuspiciously at Nat, who got more and more alarmed and confused with\r\neach denial.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody must have taken it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz, as Tommy shook his fist at\r\nthe whole party, and wrathfully declared that,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy thunder turtles! if I get hold of the thief, I'll give him what he\r\nwon't forget in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep cool, Tom; we shall find him out; thieves always come to grief,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Dan, as one who knew something of the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be some tramp slept in the barn and took it,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Silas don't allow that; besides, a tramp wouldn't go looking in\r\nthat old machine for money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, with scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasn't it Silas himself?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I like that! Old Si is as honest as daylight. You wouldn't catch\r\nhim touching a penny of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, handsomely defending his\r\nchief admirer from suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever it was had better tell, and not wait to be found out,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi, looking as if an awful misfortune had befallen the family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you think it's me,\xe2\x80\x9d broke out Nat, red and excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the only one who knew where it was,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't help it I didn't take it. I tell you I didn't I didn't!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nNat, in a desperate sort of way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, gently, my son! What is all this noise about?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer\r\nwalked in among them.\r\n\r\nTommy repeated the story of his loss, and, as he listened, Mr. Bhaer's\r\nface grew graver and graver; for, with all their faults and follies, the\r\nlads till now had been honest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake your seats,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and, when all were in their places, he added\r\nslowly, as his eye went from face to face with a grieved look, that was\r\nharder to bear than a storm of words,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boys, I shall ask each one of you a single question, and I want an\r\nhonest answer. I am not going to try to frighten, bribe, or surprise the\r\ntruth out of you, for every one of you have got a conscience, and know\r\nwhat it is for. Now is the time to undo the wrong done to Tommy, and\r\nset yourselves right before us all. I can forgive the yielding to sudden\r\ntemptation much easier than I can deceit. Don't add a lie to the theft,\r\nbut confess frankly, and we will all try to help you make us forget and\r\nforgive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and one might have heard a pin drop, the room was\r\nso still; then slowly and impressively he put the question to each one,\r\nreceiving the same answer in varying tones from all. Every face was\r\nflushed and excited, so that Mr. Bhaer could not take color as a\r\nwitness, and some of the little boys were so frightened that they\r\nstammered over the two short words as if guilty, though it was evident\r\nthat they could not be. When he came to Nat, his voice softened, for the\r\npoor lad looked so wretched, Mr. Bhaer felt for him. He believed him to\r\nbe the culprit, and hoped to save the boy from another lie, by winning\r\nhim to tell the truth without fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my son, give me an honest answer. Did you take the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat looked up at him imploringly.\r\n\r\nAs the words fell from his trembling lips, somebody hissed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop that!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bhaer, with a sharp rap on his desk, as he looked\r\nsternly toward the corner whence the sound came.\r\n\r\nNed, Jack, and Emil sat there, and the first two looked ashamed of\r\nthemselves, but Emil called out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn't me, uncle! I'd be ashamed to hit a fellow when he is down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, who was in a sad state of affliction at the\r\ntrouble his unlucky dollar had made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d commanded Mr. Bhaer; and when it came, he said soberly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry, Nat, but evidences are against you, and your old fault\r\nmakes us more ready to doubt you than we should be if we could trust you\r\nas we do some of the boys, who never fib. But mind, my child, I do not\r\ncharge you with this theft; I shall not punish you for it till I am\r\nperfectly sure, nor ask any thing more about it. I shall leave it for\r\nyou to settle with your own conscience. If you are guilty, come to me at\r\nany hour of the day or night and confess it, and I will forgive and\r\nhelp you to amend. If you are innocent, the truth will appear sooner or\r\nlater, and the instant it does, I will be the first to beg your pardon\r\nfor doubting you, and will so gladly do my best to clear your character\r\nbefore us all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't! I didn't!\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed Nat, with his head down upon his arms, for\r\nhe could not bear the look of distrust and dislike which he read in the\r\nmany eyes fixed on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bhaer paused a minute, as if to give the culprit,\r\nwhoever he might be, one more chance. Nobody spoke, however, and only\r\nsniffs of sympathy from some of the little fellows broke the silence.\r\nMr. Bhaer shook his head, and added, regretfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to be done, then, and I have but one thing to\r\nsay: I shall not speak of this again, and I wish you all to follow my\r\nexample. I cannot expect you to feel as kindly toward any one whom you\r\nsuspect as before this happened, but I do expect and desire that you\r\nwill not torment the suspected person in any way, he will have a hard\r\nenough time without that. Now go to your lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather Bhaer let Nat off too easy,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Ned to Emil, as they got\r\nout their books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Emil, who felt that this event was a blot\r\nupon the family honor.\r\n\r\nMany of the boys agreed with Ned, but Mr. Bhaer was right, nevertheless;\r\nand Nat would have been wiser to confess on the spot and have the\r\ntrouble over, for even the hardest whipping he ever received from his\r\nfather was far easier to bear than the cold looks, the avoidance, and\r\ngeneral suspicion that met him on all sides. If ever a boy was sent to\r\nCoventry and kept there, it was poor Nat; and he suffered a week of slow\r\ntorture, though not a hand was raised against him, and hardly a word\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThat was the worst of it; if they would only have talked it out, or\r\neven have thrashed him all round, he could have stood it better than\r\nthe silent distrust that made very face so terrible to meet. Even Mrs.\r\nBhaer's showed traces of it, though her manner was nearly as kind as\r\never; but the sorrowful anxious look in Father Bhaer's eyes cut Nat\r\nto the heart, for he loved his teacher dearly, and knew that he had\r\ndisappointed all his hopes by this double sin.\r\n\r\nOnly one person in the house entirely believed in him, and stood up for\r\nhim stoutly against all the rest. This was Daisy. She could not explain\r\nwhy she trusted him against all appearances, she only felt that she\r\ncould not doubt him, and her warm sympathy made her strong to take his\r\npart. She would not hear a word against him from any one, and actually\r\nslapped her beloved Demi when he tried to convince her that it must have\r\nbeen Nat, because no one else knew where the money was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the hens ate it; they are greedy old things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; and when\r\nDemi laughed, she lost her temper, slapped the amazed boy, and then\r\nburst out crying and ran away, still declaring, \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn't! he didn't!\r\nhe didn't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither aunt nor uncle tried to shake the child's faith in her friend,\r\nbut only hoped her innocent instinct might prove sure, and loved her all\r\nthe better for it. Nat often said, after it was over, that he couldn't\r\nhave stood it, if it had not been for Daisy. When the others shunned\r\nhim, she clung to him closer than ever, and turned her back on the rest.\r\nShe did not sit on the stairs now when he solaced himself with the old\r\nfiddle, but went in and sat beside him, listening with a face so full of\r\nconfidence and affection, that Nat forgot disgrace for a time, and\r\nwas happy. She asked him to help her with her lessons, she cooked him\r\nmarvelous messes in her kitchen, which he ate manfully, no matter what\r\nthey were, for gratitude gave a sweet flavor to the most distasteful.\r\nShe proposed impossible games of cricket and ball, when she found that\r\nhe shrank from joining the other boys. She put little nosegays from her\r\ngarden on his desk, and tried in every way to show that she was not a\r\nfair-weather friend, but faithful through evil as well as good repute.\r\nNan soon followed her example, in kindness at least; curbed her sharp\r\ntongue, and kept her scornful little nose from any demonstration of\r\ndoubt or dislike, which was good of Madame Giddy-gaddy, for she firmly\r\nbelieved that Nat took the money.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys let him severely alone, but Dan, though he said he\r\ndespised him for being a coward, watched over him with a grim sort of\r\nprotection, and promptly cuffed any lad who dared to molest his mate or\r\nmake him afraid. His idea of friendship was as high as Daisy's, and, in\r\nhis own rough way, he lived up to it as loyally.\r\n\r\nSitting by the brook one afternoon, absorbed in the study of the\r\ndomestic habits of water-spiders, he overheard a bit of conversation on\r\nthe other side of the wall. Ned, who was intensely inquisitive, had been\r\non tenterhooks to know certainly who was the culprit; for of late one\r\nor two of the boys had begun to think that they were wrong, Nat was so\r\nsteadfast in his denials, and so meek in his endurance of their neglect.\r\nThis doubt had teased Ned past bearing, and he had several times\r\nprivately beset Nat with questions, regardless of Mr. Bhaer's express\r\ncommand. Finding Nat reading alone on the shady side of the wall, Ned\r\ncould not resist stopping for a nibble at the forbidden subject. He had\r\nworried Nat for some ten minutes before Dan arrived, and the first words\r\nthe spider-student heard were these, in Nat's patient, pleading voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't, Ned! oh, don't! I can't tell you because I don't know, and it's\r\nmean of you to keep nagging at me on the sly, when Father Bhaer told you\r\nnot to plague me. You wouldn't dare to if Dan was round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain't afraid of Dan; he's nothing but an old bully. Don't believe but\r\nwhat he took Tom's money, and you know it, and won't tell. Come, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn't, but, if he did, I would stand up for him, he has always been\r\nso good to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, so earnestly that Dan forgot his spiders, and\r\nrose quickly to thank him, but Ned's next words arrested him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know Dan did it, and gave the money to you. Shouldn't wonder if he\r\ngot his living picking pockets before he came here, for nobody knows\r\nany thing about him but you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned, not believing his own words, but\r\nhoping to get the truth out of Nat by making him angry.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in a part of his ungenerous wish, for Nat cried out,\r\nfiercely,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you say that again I'll go and tell Mr. Bhaer all about it. I don't\r\nwant to tell tales, but, by George! I will, if you don't let Dan alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you'll be a sneak, as well as a liar and a thief,\xe2\x80\x9d began Ned, with\r\na jeer, for Nat had borne insult to himself so meekly, the other did not\r\nbelieve he would dare to face the master just to stand up for Dan.\r\n\r\nWhat he might have added I cannot tell, for the words were hardly out\r\nof his mouth when a long arm from behind took him by the collar, and,\r\njerking him over the wall in a most promiscuous way, landed him with a\r\nsplash in the middle of the brook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that again and I'll duck you till you can't see!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan,\r\nlooking like a modern Colossus of Rhodes as he stood, with a foot on\r\neither side of the narrow stream, glaring down at the discomfited youth\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only in fun,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sneak yourself to badger Nat round the corner. Let me catch\r\nyou at it again, and I'll souse you in the river next time. Get up, and\r\nclear out!\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Dan, in a rage.\r\n\r\nNed fled, dripping, and his impromptu sitz-bath evidently did him good,\r\nfor he was very respectful to both the boys after that, and seemed to\r\nhave left his curiosity in the brook. As he vanished Dan jumped over the\r\nwall, and found Nat lying, as if quite worn out and bowed down with his\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't pester you again, I guess. If he does, just tell me, and I'll\r\nsee to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, trying to cool down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't mind what he says about me so much, I've got used to it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Nat sadly; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I hate to have him pitch into you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know he isn't right?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, turning his face away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, about the money?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, looking up with a startled air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don't believe it! You don't care for money; all you want is your\r\nold bugs and things,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat laughed, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a butterfly net as much as you want a fiddle; why shouldn't I\r\nsteal the money for it as much as you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, still turning away,\r\nand busily punching holes in the turf with his stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think you would. You like to fight and knock folks round\r\nsometimes, but you don't lie, and I don't believe you'd steal,\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat\r\nshook his head decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've done both. I used to fib like fury; it's too much trouble now; and\r\nI stole things to eat out of gardens when I ran away from Page, so you\r\nsee I am a bad lot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, speaking in the rough, reckless way which\r\nhe had been learning to drop lately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Dan! don't say it's you! I'd rather have it any of the other boys,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Nat, in such a distressed tone that Dan looked pleased, and showed\r\nthat he did, by turning round with a queer expression in his face,\r\nthough he only answered,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't say any thing about it. But don't you fret, and we'll pull\r\nthrough somehow, see if we don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in his face and manner gave Nat a new idea; and he said,\r\npressing his hands together, in the eagerness of his appeal,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you know who did it. If you do, beg him to tell, Dan. It's so\r\nhard to have 'em all hate me for nothing. I don't think I can bear it\r\nmuch longer. If I had any place to go to, I'd run away, though I love\r\nPlumfield dearly; but I'm not brave and big like you, so I must stay and\r\nwait till some one shows them that I haven't lied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Nat looked so broken and despairing, that Dan could not\r\nbear it, and, muttered huskily,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won't wait long,\xe2\x80\x9d and he walked rapidly away, and was seen no more\r\nfor hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boys of one another several\r\ntimes during the Sunday that followed a week which seemed as if it would\r\nnever end. Dan was often moody, but that day he was so sober and silent\r\nthat no one could get any thing out of him. When they walked he strayed\r\naway from the rest, and came home late. He took no part in the evening\r\nconversation, but sat in the shadow, so busy with his own thoughts that\r\nhe scarcely seemed to hear what was going on. When Mrs. Jo showed him an\r\nunusually good report in the Conscience Book, he looked at it without a\r\nsmile, and said, wistfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think I am getting on, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellently, Dan! and I am so pleased, because I always thought you\r\nonly needed a little help to make you a boy to be proud of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her with a strange expression in his black eyes an\r\nexpression of mingled pride and love and sorrow which she could not\r\nunderstand then but remembered afterward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid you'll be disappointed, but I do try,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, shutting the\r\nbook with no sign of pleasure in the page that he usually liked so much\r\nto read over and talk about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sick, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo, with her hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy foot aches a little; I guess I'll go to bed. Good-night, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added, and held the hand against his cheek a minute, then went away\r\nlooking as if he had said good-bye to something dear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Dan! he takes Nat's disgrace to heart sadly. He is a strange boy;\r\nI wonder if I ever shall understand him thoroughly?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo\r\nto herself, as she thought over Dan's late improvement with real\r\nsatisfaction, yet felt that there was more in the lad than she had at\r\nfirst suspected.\r\n\r\nOne of things which cut Nat most deeply was an act of Tommy's, for after\r\nhis loss Tommy had said to him, kindly, but firmly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't wish to hurt you, Nat, but you see I can't afford to lose my\r\nmoney, so I guess we won't be partners any longer;\xe2\x80\x9d and with that Tommy\r\nrubbed out the sign, \xe2\x80\x9cT. Bangs & Co.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat had been very proud of the \xe2\x80\x9cCo.,\xe2\x80\x9d and had hunted eggs industriously,\r\nkept his accounts all straight, and had added a good sum to his income\r\nfrom the sale of his share of stock in trade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Tom! must you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, feeling that his good name was gone for ever\r\nin the business world if this was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Tommy, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cEmil says that when one man 'bezzles\r\n(believe that's the word it means to take money and cut away with it)\r\nthe property of a firm, the other one sues him, or pitches into him\r\nsomehow, and won't have any thing more to do with him. Now you have\r\n'bezzled my property; I shan't sue you, and I shan't pitch into you, but\r\nI must dissolve the partnership, because I can't trust you, and I don't\r\nwish to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't make you believe me, and you won't take my money, though I'd be\r\nthankful to give all my dollars if you'd only say you don't think I took\r\nyour money. Do let me hunt for you, I won't ask any wages, but do it for\r\nnothing. I know all the places, and I like it,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Nat.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy shook his head, and his jolly round face looked suspicious and\r\nhard as he said, shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cCan't do it; wish you didn't know the places.\r\nMind you don't go hunting on the sly, and speculate in my eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Nat was so hurt that he could not get over it. He felt that he had\r\nlost not only his partner and patron, but that he was bankrupt in honor,\r\nand an outlaw from the business community. No one trusted his word,\r\nwritten or spoken, in spite of his efforts to redeem the past falsehood;\r\nthe sign was down, the firm broken up, and he a ruined man. The barn,\r\nwhich was the boys' Wall Street, knew him no more. Cockletop and\r\nher sisters cackled for him in vain, and really seemed to take his\r\nmisfortune to heart, for eggs were fewer, and some of the biddies\r\nretired in disgust to new nests, which Tommy could not find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey trust me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, when he heard of it; and though the boys\r\nshouted at the idea, Nat found comfort in it, for when one is down in\r\nthe world, the confidence of even a speckled hen is most consoling.\r\n\r\nTommy took no new partner, however, for distrust had entered in, and\r\npoisoned the peace of his once confiding soul. Ned offered to join him,\r\nbut he declined, saying, with a sense of justice that did him honor,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might turn out that Nat didn't take my money, and then we could\r\nbe partners again. I don't think it will happen, but I will give him a\r\nchance, and keep the place open a little longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBilly was the only person whom Bangs felt he could trust in his shop,\r\nand Billy was trained to hunt eggs, and hand them over unbroken, being\r\nquite satisfied with an apple or a sugar-plum for wages. The morning\r\nafter Dan's gloomy Sunday, Billy said to his employer, as he displayed\r\nthe results of a long hunt,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt gets worse and worse; I never saw such provoking old hens,\xe2\x80\x9d growled\r\nTommy, thinking of the days when he often had six to rejoice over.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, put 'em in my hat and give me a new bit of chalk; I must mark 'em\r\nup, any way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBilly mounted a peck-measure, and looked into the top of the machine,\r\nwhere Tommy kept his writing materials.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's lots of money in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Billy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there isn't. Catch me leaving my cash round again,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see 'em one, four, eight, two dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Billy, who had not\r\nyet mastered the figures correctly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a jack you are!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy hopped up to get the chalk for himself,\r\nbut nearly tumbled down again, for there actually were four bright\r\nquarters in a row, with a bit of paper on them directed to \xe2\x80\x9cTom Bangs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n that there might be no mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThunder turtles!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, and seizing them he dashed into the\r\nhouse, bawling wildly, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's all right! Got my money! Where's Nat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was soon found, and his surprise and pleasure were so genuine that\r\nfew doubted his word when he now denied all knowledge of the money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I put it back when I didn't take it? Do believe me now, and\r\nbe good to me again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, so imploringly, that Emil slapped him on\r\nthe back, and declared he would for one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo will I, and I'm jolly glad it's not you. But who the dickens is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tommy, after shaking hands heartily with Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, as long as it's found,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan with his eyes fixed on\r\nNat's happy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I like that! I'm not going to have my things hooked, and then\r\nbrought back like the juggling man's tricks,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, looking at\r\nhis money as if he suspected witchcraft.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll find him out somehow, though he was sly enough to print this so\r\nhis writing wouldn't be known,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz, examining the paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi prints tip-top,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Rob, who had not a very clear idea what\r\nthe fuss was all about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't make me believe it's him, not if you talk till you are blue,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Tommy, and the others hooted at the mere idea; for the little\r\ndeacon, as they called him, was above suspicion.\r\n\r\nNat felt the difference in the way they spoke of Demi and himself, and\r\nwould have given all he had or ever hoped to have to be so trusted;\r\nfor he had learned how easy it is to lose the confidence of others, how\r\nvery, very hard to win it back, and truth became to him a precious thing\r\nsince he had suffered from neglecting it.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer was very glad one step had been taken in the right direction,\r\nand waited hopefully for yet further revelations. They came sooner than\r\nhe expected, and in a way that surprised and grieved him very much. As\r\nthey sat at supper that night, a square parcel was handed to Mrs. Bhaer\r\nfrom Mrs. Bates, a neighbor. A note accompanied the parcel, and, while\r\nMr. Bhaer read it, Demi pulled off the wrapper, exclaiming, as he saw\r\nits contents,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it's the book Uncle Teddy gave Dan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil!\xe2\x80\x9d broke from Dan, for he had not yet quite cured himself of\r\nswearing, though he tried very hard.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer looked up quickly at the sound. Dan tried to meet his eyes,\r\nbut could not; his own fell, and he sat biting his lips, getting redder\r\nand redder till he was the picture of shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bhaer, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have preferred to talk about this in private, but Demi has\r\nspoilt that plan, so I may as well have it out now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer,\r\nlooking a little stern, as he always did when any meanness or deceit\r\ncame up for judgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe note is from Mrs. Bates, and she says that her boy Jimmy told her\r\nhe bought this book of Dan last Saturday. She saw that it was worth much\r\nmore than a dollar, and thinking there was some mistake, has sent it to\r\nme. Did you sell it, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d was the slow answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWanted money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo pay somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom did you owe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTommy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever borrowed a cent of me in his life,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy, looked scared,\r\nfor he guessed what was coming now, and felt that on the whole he would\r\nhave preferred witchcraft, for he admired Dan immensely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he took it,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ned, who owed Dan a grudge for the ducking,\r\nand, being a mortal boy, liked to pay it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Dan!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, clasping his hands, regardless of the bread and\r\nbutter in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a hard thing to do, but I must have this settled, for I cannot\r\nhave you watching each other like detectives, and the whole school\r\ndisturbed in this way, did you put that dollar in the barn this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\nDan looked him straight in the face, and answered steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA murmur went round the table, Tommy dropped his mug with a crash; Daisy\r\ncried out, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it wasn't Nat;\xe2\x80\x9d Nan began to cry, and Mrs. Jo left\r\nthe room, looking so disappointed, sorry, and ashamed that Dan could not\r\nbear it. He hid his face in his hands a moment, then threw up his head,\r\nsquared his shoulders as if settling some load upon them, and said, with\r\nthe dogged look, and half-resolute, half-reckless tone he had used when\r\nhe first came,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it; now you may do what you like to me, but I won't say another\r\nword about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even that you are sorry?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer, troubled by the change\r\nin him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain't sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll forgive him without asking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, feeling that it was\r\nharder somehow to see brave Dan disgraced than timid Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't want to be forgiven,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Dan, gruffly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you will when you have thought about it quietly by yourself, I\r\nwon't tell you now how surprised and disappointed I am, but by and by I\r\nwill come up and talk to you in your room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't make any difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, trying to speak defiantly, but\r\nfailing as he looked at Mr. Bhaer's sorrowful face; and, taking his\r\nwords for a dismissal, Dan left the room as if he found it impossible to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nIt would have done him good if he had stayed; for the boys talked the\r\nmatter over with such sincere regret, and pity, and wonder, it might\r\nhave touched and won him to ask pardon. No one was glad to find that it\r\nwas he, not even Nat; for, spite of all his faults, and they were many,\r\nevery one liked Dan now, because under his rough exterior lay some of\r\nthe manly virtues which we most admire and love. Mrs. Jo had been the\r\nchief prop, as well as cultivator, of Dan; and she took it sadly to\r\nheart that her last and most interesting boy had turned out so ill. The\r\ntheft was bad, but the lying about it, and allowing another to suffer\r\nso much from an unjust suspicion was worse; and most discouraging of all\r\nwas the attempt to restore the money in an underhand way, for it showed\r\nnot only a want of courage, but a power of deceit that boded ill for the\r\nfuture. Still more trying was his steady refusal to talk of the matter,\r\nto ask pardon, or express any remorse. Days passed; and he went about\r\nhis lessons and his work, silent, grim, and unrepentant. As if taking\r\nwarning by their treatment of Nat, he asked no sympathy of any one,\r\nrejected the advances of the boys, and spent his leisure hours roaming\r\nabout the fields and woods, trying to find playmates in the birds and\r\nbeasts, and succeeding better than most boys would have done, because he\r\nknew and loved them so well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this goes on much longer, I'm afraid he will run away again, for he\r\nis too young to stand a life like this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, quite dejected\r\nat the failure of all his efforts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little while ago I should have been quite sure that nothing would\r\ntempt him away, but now I am ready of any thing, he is so changed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered poor Mrs. Jo, who mourned over her boy and could not be\r\ncomforted, because he shunned her more than any one else, and only\r\nlooked at her with the half-fierce, half-imploring eyes of a wild animal\r\ncaught in a trap, when she tried to talk to him alone.\r\n\r\nNat followed him about like a shadow, and Dan did not repulse him as\r\nrudely as he did others, but said, in his blunt way, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are all right;\r\ndon't worry about me. I can stand it better than you did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don't like to have you all alone,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat would say, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like it;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan would tramp away, stifling a sigh sometimes, for he\r\nwas lonely.\r\n\r\nPassing through the birch grove one day, he came up on several of the\r\nboys, who were amusing themselves by climbing up the trees and swinging\r\ndown again, as they slender elastic stems bent till their tops touched\r\nthe ground. Dan paused a minute to watch the fun, without offering\r\nto join in it, and as he stood there Jack took his turn. He had\r\nunfortunately chosen too large a tree; for when he swung off, it only\r\nbent a little way, and left him hanging at a dangerous height.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back; you can't do it!\xe2\x80\x9d called Ned from below.\r\n\r\nJack tried, but the twigs slipped from his hands, and he could not get\r\nhis legs round the trunk. He kicked, and squirmed, and clutched in vain,\r\nthen gave it up, and hung breathless, saying helplessly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me! help me! I must drop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll be killed if you do,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ned, frightened out of his wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Dan; and up the tree he went, crashing his way along\r\ntill he nearly reached Jack, whose face looked up at him, full of fear\r\nand hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll both come down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned, dancing with excitement on the slope\r\nunderneath, while Nat held out his arms, in the wild hope of breaking\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's what I want; stand from under,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, coolly; and, as he\r\nspoke, his added weight bent the tree many feet nearer the earth.\r\n\r\nJack dropped safely; but the birch, lightened of half its load, flew up\r\nagain so suddenly, that Dan, in the act of swinging round to drop feet\r\nforemost, lost his hold and fell heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm not hurt, all right in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sitting up, a little\r\npale and dizzy, as the boys gathered round him, full of admiration and\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou're a trump, Dan, and I'm ever so much obliged to you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Jack,\r\ngratefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn't any thing,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Dan, rising slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say it was, and I'll shake hands with you, though you are,\xe2\x80\x9d Ned\r\nchecked the unlucky word on his tongue, and held out his hand, feeling\r\nthat it was a handsome thing on his part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I won't shake hands with a sneak;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan turned his back with a\r\nlook of scorn, that caused Ned to remember the brook, and retire with\r\nundignified haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome home, old chap; I'll give you a lift;\xe2\x80\x9d and Nat walked away with\r\nhim leaving the others to talk over the feat together, to wonder when\r\nDan would \xe2\x80\x9ccome round,\xe2\x80\x9d and to wish one and all that Tommy's \xe2\x80\x9cconfounded\r\nmoney had been in Jericho before it made such a fuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bhaer came into school next morning, he looked so happy, that\r\nthe boys wondered what had happened to him, and really thought he had\r\nlost his mind when they saw him go straight to Dan, and, taking him by\r\nboth hands, say all in one breath, as he shook them heartily,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about it, and I beg your pardon. It was like you to do it,\r\nand I love you for it, though it's never right to tell lies, even for a\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, for Dan said not a word, only lifted up his\r\nhead, as if a weight of some sort had fallen off his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan did not take Tommy's money;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer quite shouted it, he was\r\nso glad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boys in a chorus.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer pointed to one empty seat, and every eye followed his finger,\r\nyet no one spoke for a minute, they were so surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack went home early this morning, but he left this behind him;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nin the silence Mr. Bhaer read the note which he had found tied to his\r\ndoor-handle when he rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took Tommy's dollar. I was peeking in through a crack and saw him put\r\nit there. I was afraid to tell before, though I wanted to. I didn't care\r\nso much about Nat, but Dan is a trump, and I can't stand it any longer.\r\nI never spent the money; it's under the carpet in my room, right behind\r\nthe washstand. I'm awful sorry. I am going home, and don't think I shall\r\never come back, so Dan may have my things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJACK\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not an elegant confession, being badly written, much blotted,\r\nand very short; but it was a precious paper to Dan; and, when Mr. Bhaer\r\npaused, the boy went to him, saying, in a rather broken voice, but with\r\nclear eyes, and the frank, respectful manner they had tried to teach\r\nhim,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll say I'm sorry now, and ask you to forgive me, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a kind lie, Dan, and I can't help forgiving it; but you see it\r\ndid no good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, with a hand on either shoulder, and a face\r\nfull of relief and affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt kept the boys from plaguing Nat. That's what I did it for. It made\r\nhim right down miserable. I didn't care so much,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Dan, as if\r\nglad to speak out after his hard silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you do it? You are always so kind to me,\xe2\x80\x9d faltered Nat,\r\nfeeling a strong desire to hug his friend and cry. Two girlish\r\nperformances, which would have scandalized Dan to the last degree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all right now, old fellow, so don't be a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nswallowing the lump in his throat, and laughing out as he had not done\r\nfor weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Mrs. Bhaer know?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and she is so happy I don't know what she will do to you,\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\nMr. Bhaer, but got no farther, for here the boys came crowding about Dan\r\nin a tumult of pleasure and curiosity; but before he had answered more\r\nthan a dozen questions, a voice cried out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree cheers for Dan!\xe2\x80\x9d and there was Mrs. Jo in the doorway waving her\r\ndish-towel, and looking as if she wanted to dance a jig for joy, as she\r\nused to do when a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bhaer, and led off a rousing hurrah, which\r\nstartled Asia in the kitchen, and made old Mr. Roberts shake his head as\r\nhe drove by, saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSchools are not what they were when I was young!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan stood it pretty well for a minute, but the sight of Mrs. Jo's\r\ndelight upset him, and he suddenly bolted across the hall into the\r\nparlor, whither she instantly followed, and neither were seen for half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer found it very difficult to calm his excited flock; and, seeing\r\nthat lessons were an impossibility for a time, he caught their attention\r\nby telling them the fine old story of the friends whose fidelity to one\r\nanother has made their names immortal. The lads listened and remembered,\r\nfor just then their hearts were touched by the loyalty of a humbler pair\r\nof friends. The lie was wrong, but the love that prompted it and the\r\ncourage that bore in silence the disgrace which belonged to another,\r\nmade Dan a hero in their eyes. Honesty and honor had a new meaning now;\r\na good name was more precious than gold; for once lost money could not\r\nbuy it back; and faith in one another made life smooth and happy as\r\nnothing else could do.\r\n\r\nTommy proudly restored the name of the firm; Nat was devoted to Dan; and\r\nall the boys tried to atone to both for former suspicion and neglect.\r\nMrs. Jo rejoiced over her flock, and Mr. Bhaer was never tired of\r\ntelling the story of his young Damon and Pythias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. IN THE WILLOW\r\n\r\nThe old tree saw and heard a good many little scenes and confidences\r\nthat summer, because it became the favorite retreat of all the children,\r\nand the willow seemed to enjoy it, for a pleasant welcome always met\r\nthem, and the quiet hours spent in its arms did them all good. It had\r\na great deal of company one Saturday afternoon, and some little bird\r\nreported what went on there.\r\n\r\nFirst came Nan and Daisy with their small tubs and bits of soap, for\r\nnow and then they were seized with a tidy fit, and washed up all their\r\ndolls' clothes in the brook. Asia would not have them \xe2\x80\x9cslopping round\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n in her kitchen, and the bath-room was forbidden since Nan forgot to turn\r\noff the water till it overflowed and came gently dripping down through\r\nthe ceiling. Daisy went systematically to work, washing first the white\r\nand then the colored things, rinsing them nicely, and hanging them to\r\ndry on a cord fastened from one barberry-bush to another, and pinning\r\nthem up with a set of tiny clothes-pins Ned had turned for her. But Nan\r\nput all her little things to soak in the same tub, and then forgot them\r\nwhile she collected thistledown to stuff a pillow for Semiramis, Queen\r\nof Babylon, as one doll was named. This took some time, and when Mrs.\r\nGiddy-gaddy came to take out her clothes, deep green stains appeared on\r\nevery thing, for she had forgotten the green silk lining of a certain\r\ncape, and its color had soaked nicely into the pink and blue gowns, the\r\nlittle chemises, and even the best ruffled petticoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh me! what a mess!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay them on the grass to bleach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, with an air of\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I will, and we can sit up in the nest and watch that they don't blow\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Babylon's wardrobe was spread forth upon the bank, and,\r\nturning up their tubs to dry, the little washerwomen climbed into the\r\nnest, and fell to talking, as ladies are apt to do in the pauses of\r\ndomestic labor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm going to have a feather-bed to go with my new pillow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nGiddy-gaddy, as she transferred the thistledown from her pocket to her\r\nhandkerchief, losing about half in the process.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn't; Aunt Jo says feather-beds aren't healthy. I never let my\r\nchildren sleep on any thing but a mattress,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Shakespeare\r\nSmith, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care; my children are so strong they often sleep on the\r\nfloor, and don't mind it,\xe2\x80\x9d (which was quite true). \xe2\x80\x9cI can't afford nine\r\nmattresses, and I like to make beds myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon't Tommy charge for the feathers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be he will, but I shan't pay him, and he won't care,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs.\r\nG., taking a base advantage of the well-known good nature of T. Bangs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the pink will fade out of that dress sooner than the green mark\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs. S., looking down from her perch, and changing the\r\nsubject, for she and her gossip differed on many points, and Mrs. Smith\r\nwas a discreet lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind; I'm tired of dolls, and I guess I shall put them all away\r\nand attend to my farm; I like it rather better than playing house,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. G., unconsciously expressing the desire of many older ladies, who\r\ncannot dispose of their families so easily however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you mustn't leave them; they will die without their mother,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe tender Mrs. Smith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet 'em die then; I'm tired of fussing over babies, and I'm going\r\nto play with the boys; they need me to see to 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the\r\nstrong-minded lady.\r\n\r\nDaisy knew nothing about women's rights; she quietly took all she\r\nwanted, and no one denied her claim, because she did not undertake what\r\nshe could not carry out, but unconsciously used the all-powerful right\r\nof her own influence to win from others any privilege for which she\r\nhad proved her fitness. Nan attempted all sorts of things, undaunted by\r\ndireful failures, and clamored fiercely to be allowed to do every thing\r\nthat the boys did. They laughed at her, hustled her out of the way, and\r\nprotested against her meddling with their affairs. But she would not be\r\nquenched and she would be heard, for her will was strong, and she had\r\nthe spirit of a rampant reformer. Mrs. Bhaer sympathized with her, but\r\ntired to curb her frantic desire for entire liberty, showing her that\r\nshe must wait a little, learn self-control, and be ready to use her\r\nfreedom before she asked for it. Nan had meek moments when she agreed to\r\nthis, and the influences at work upon her were gradually taking effect.\r\nShe no longer declared that she would be engine-driver or a blacksmith,\r\nbut turned her mind to farming, and found in it a vent for the energy\r\nbottled up in her active little body. It did not quite satisfy her,\r\nhowever; for her sage and sweet marjoram were dumb things, and could not\r\nthank her for her care. She wanted something human to love, work for,\r\nand protect, and was never happier than when the little boys brought\r\ntheir cut fingers, bumped heads, or bruised joints for her to \xe2\x80\x9cmend-up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Seeing this, Mrs. Jo proposed that she should learn how to do it nicely,\r\nand Nursey had an apt pupil in bandaging, plastering, and fomenting. The\r\nboys began to call her \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Giddy-gaddy,\xe2\x80\x9d and she liked it so well that\r\nMrs. Jo one day said to the Professor,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFritz, I see what we can do for that child. She wants something to live\r\nfor even now, and will be one of the sharp, strong, discontented women\r\nif she does not have it. Don't let us snub her restless little nature,\r\nbut do our best to give her the work she likes, and by and by persuade\r\nher father to let her study medicine. She will make a capital doctor,\r\nfor she has courage, strong nerves, a tender heart, and an intense love\r\nand pity for the weak and suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer smiled at first, but agreed to try, and gave Nan an\r\nherb-garden, teaching her the various healing properties of the plants\r\nshe tended, and letting her try their virtues on the children in\r\nthe little illnesses they had from time to time. She learned fast,\r\nremembered well, and showed a sense and interest most encouraging to\r\nher Professor, who did not shut his door in her face because she was a\r\nlittle woman.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of this, as she sat in the willow that day, and when\r\nDaisy said in her gentle way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love to keep house, and mean to have a nice one for Demi when we grow\r\nup and live together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNan replied with decision\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I haven't got any brother, and I don't want any house to fuss\r\nover. I shall have an office, with lots of bottles and drawers and\r\npestle things in it, and I shall drive round in a horse and chaise and\r\ncure sick people. That will be such fun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUgh! how can you bear the bad-smelling stuff and the nasty little\r\npowders and castor-oil and senna and hive syrup?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, with a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shan't have to take any, so I don't care. Besides, they make people\r\nwell, and I like to cure folks. Didn't my sage-tea make Mother Bhaer's\r\nheadache go away, and my hops stop Ned's toothache in five hours? So\r\nnow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall you put leeches on people, and cut off legs and pull out teeth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Daisy, quaking at the thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall do every thing; I don't care if the people are all smashed\r\nup, I shall mend them. My grandpa was a doctor, and I saw him sew a\r\ngreat cut in a man's cheek, and I held the sponge, and wasn't frightened\r\na bit, and Grandpa said I was a brave girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you? I'm sorry for sick people, and I like to nurse them,\r\nbut it makes my legs shake so I have to run away. I'm not a brave girl,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n sighed Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you can be my nurse, and cuddle my patients when I have given\r\nthem the physic and cut off their legs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, whose practice was\r\nevidently to be of the heroic kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShip ahoy! Where are you, Nan?\xe2\x80\x9d called a voice from below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said the voice, and Emil appeared holding one hand in the\r\nother, with his face puckered up as if in pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA confounded splinter in my thumb. Can't get it out. Take a pick at it,\r\nwill you, Nanny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's in very deep, and I haven't any needle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, examining a\r\ntarry thumb with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a pin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, in a hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it's too big and hasn't got a sharp point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Daisy, who had dived into her pocket, presented a neat little\r\nhousewife with four needles in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the Posy who always has what we want,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil; and Nan\r\nresolved to have a needle-book in her own pocket henceforth, for just\r\nsuch cases as this were always occurring in her practice.\r\n\r\nDaisy covered her eyes, but Nan probed and picked with a steady hand,\r\nwhile Emil gave directions not down in any medical work or record.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStarboard now! Steady, boys, steady! Try another tack. Heave ho! there\r\nshe is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuck it,\xe2\x80\x9d ordered the Doctor, surveying the splinter with an\r\nexperienced eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo dirty,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the patient, shaking his bleeding hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait; I'll tie it up if you have got a handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't; take one of those rags down there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious! no, indeed; they are doll's clothes,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy,\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake one of mine; I'd like to have you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan; and swinging himself\r\ndown, Emil caught up the first \xe2\x80\x9crag\xe2\x80\x9d he saw. It happened to be the\r\nfrilled skirt; but Nan tore it up without a murmur; and when the royal\r\npetticoat was turned into a neat little bandage, she dismissed her\r\npatient with the command,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it wet, and let it alone; then it will heal right up, and not be\r\nsore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you charge?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Commodore, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing; I keep a 'spensary; that is a place where poor people are\r\ndoctored free gratis for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Nan, with an air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Doctor Giddy-gaddy. I'll always call you in when I come\r\nto grief;\xe2\x80\x9d and Emil departed, but looked back to say for one good turn\r\ndeserves another \xe2\x80\x9cYour duds are blowing away, Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForgiving the disrespectful word, \xe2\x80\x9cduds,\xe2\x80\x9d the ladies hastily descended,\r\nand, gathering up their wash, retired to the house to fire up the little\r\nstove, and go to ironing.\r\n\r\nA passing breath of air shook the old willow, as if it laughed softly\r\nat the childish chatter which went on in the nest, and it had hardly\r\ncomposed itself when another pair of birds alighted for a confidential\r\ntwitter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I'll tell you the secret,\xe2\x80\x9d began Tommy, who was \xe2\x80\x9cswellin' wisibly\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with the importance of his news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell away,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat, wishing he had brought his fiddle, it was so\r\nshady and quiet here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we fellows were talking over the late interesting case of\r\ncircumstantial evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, quoting at random from a speech\r\nFranz had made at the club, \xe2\x80\x9cand I proposed giving Dan something to\r\nmake up for our suspecting him, to show our respect, and so on, you know\r\nsomething handsome and useful, that he could keep always and be proud\r\nof. What do you think we chose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA butterfly-net; he wants one ever so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, looking a little\r\ndisappointed, for he meant to get it himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; it's to be a microscope, a real swell one, that we see\r\nwhat-do-you-call-'ems in water with, and stars, and ant-eggs, and all\r\nsorts of games, you know. Won't it be a jolly good present?\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy,\r\nrather confusing microscopes and telescopes in his remarks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTip-top! I'm so glad! Won't it cost a heap, though?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, feeling\r\nthat his friend was beginning to be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it will; but we are all going to give something. I headed the\r\npaper with my five dollars; for if it is done at all, it must be done\r\nhandsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! all of it? I never did see such a generous chap as you are;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nNat beamed upon him with sincere admiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I've been so bothered with my property, that I'm tired\r\nof it, and don't mean to save up any more, but give it away as I go\r\nalong, and then nobody will envy me, or want to steal it, and I shan't\r\nbe suspecting folks and worrying about my old cash,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Tommy, on\r\nwhom the cares and anxieties of a millionaire weighed heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill Mr. Bhaer let you do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thought it was a first-rate plan, and said that some of the best men\r\nhe knew preferred to do good with their money instead of laying it up to\r\nbe squabbled over when they died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father is rich; does he do that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm not sure; he gives me all I want; I know that much. I'm going to\r\ntalk to him about it when I go home. Anyhow, I shall set him a good\r\nexample;\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy was so serious, that Nat did not dare to laugh, but\r\nsaid, respectfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be able to do ever so much with your money, won't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Mr. Bhaer said, and he promised to advise me about useful ways of\r\nspending it. I'm going to begin with Dan; and next time I get a dollar\r\nor so, I shall do something for Dick, he's such a good little chap, and\r\nonly has a cent a week for pocket-money. He can't earn much, you know;\r\nso I'm going to kind of see to him;\xe2\x80\x9d and good-hearted Tommy quite longed\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that's a beautiful plan, and I'm not going to try to buy a\r\nfiddle any more; I'm going to get Dan his net all myself, and if there\r\nis any money left, I'll do something to please poor Billy. He's fond\r\nof me, and though he isn't poor, he'd like some little thing from me,\r\nbecause I can make out what he wants better than the rest of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And Nat fell to wondering how much happiness could be got out of his\r\nprecious three dollars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I would. Now come and ask Mr. Bhaer if you can't go in town with me\r\non Monday afternoon, so you can get the net, while I get the microscope.\r\nFranz and Emil are going too, and we'll have a jolly time larking round\r\namong the shops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lads walked away arm-in-arm, discussing the new plans with droll\r\nimportance, yet beginning already to feel the sweet satisfaction which\r\ncomes to those who try, no matter how humbly, to be earthly providences\r\nto the poor and helpless, and gild their mite with the gold of charity\r\nbefore it is laid up where thieves cannot break through and steal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome up and rest while we sort the leaves; it's so cool and pleasant\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, as he and Dan came sauntering home from a long walk in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, who was a boy of few words, and up they went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes birch leaves shake so much more than the others?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\ninquiring Demi, who was always sure of an answer from Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are hung differently. Don't you see the stem where it joins the\r\nleaf is sort of pinched one way, and where it joins the twig, it is\r\npinched another. This makes it waggle with the least bit of wind, but\r\nthe elm leaves hang straight, and keep stiller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow curious! will this do so?\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi held up a sprig of acacia,\r\nwhich he had broken from a little tree on the lawn, because it was so\r\npretty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that belongs to the sort that shuts up when you touch it. Draw your\r\nfinger down the middle of the stem, and see if the leaves don't curl\r\nup,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, who was examining a bit of mica.\r\n\r\nDemi tried it, and presently the little leaves did fold together, till\r\nthe spray showed a single instead of a double line of leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like that; tell me about the others. What do these do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi,\r\ntaking up a new branch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFeed silk-worms; they live on mulberry leaves, till they begin to spin\r\nthemselves up. I was in a silk-factory once, and there were rooms full\r\nof shelves all covered with leaves, and worms eating them so fast that\r\nit made a rustle. Sometimes they eat so much they die. Tell that to\r\nStuffy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan laughed, as he took up another bit of rock with a\r\nlichen on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know one thing about this mullein leaf: the fairies use them for\r\nblankets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who had not quite given up his faith in the\r\nexistence of the little folk in green.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a microscope, I'd show you something prettier than fairies,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Dan, wondering if he should ever own that coveted treasure. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew\r\nan old woman who used mullein leaves for a night-cap because she had\r\nface-ache. She sewed them together, and wore it all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow funny! was she your grandmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever had any. She was a queer old woman, and lived alone in a little\r\ntumble-down house with nineteen cats. Folks called her a witch, but she\r\nwasn't, though she looked like an old rag-bag. She was real kind to me\r\nwhen I lived in that place, and used to let me get warm at her fire when\r\nthe folks at the poorhouse were hard on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you live in a poorhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little while. Never mind that I didn't mean to speak of it;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan\r\nstopped short in his unusual fit of communicativeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about the cats, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, feeling that he had asked an\r\nunpleasant question, and sorry for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to tell; only she had a lot of 'em, and kept 'em in a barrel\r\nnights; and I used to go and tip over the barrel sometimes, and let 'em\r\nout all over the house, and then she'd scold, and chase 'em and put 'em\r\nin again, spitting and yowling like fury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas she good to them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi, with a hearty child's laugh,\r\npleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuess she was. Poor old soul! she took in all the lost and sick cats in\r\nthe town; and when anybody wanted one they went to Marm Webber, and she\r\nlet 'em pick any kind and color they wanted, and only asked ninepence,\r\nshe was glad to have her pussies get a good home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see Marm Webber. Could I, if I went to that place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe's dead. All my folks are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, briefly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sorry;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi sat silent a minute, wondering what subject would\r\nbe safe to try next. He felt delicate about speaking of the departed\r\nlady, but was very curious about the cats, and could not resist asking\r\nsoftly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she cure the sick ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes. One had a broken leg, and she tied it up to a stick, and it\r\ngot well; and another had fits, and she doctored it with yarbs till\r\nit was cured. But some of 'em died, and she buried 'em; and when they\r\ncouldn't get well, she killed 'em easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi, feeling that there was a peculiar charm about this\r\nold woman, and some sort of joke about the cats, because Dan was smiling\r\nto himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kind lady, who was fond of cats, told her how, and gave her some\r\nstuff, and sent all her own pussies to be killed that way. Marm used\r\nto put a sponge wet with ether, in the bottom of an old boot, then poke\r\npuss in head downwards. The ether put her to sleep in a jiffy, and she\r\nwas drowned in warm water before she woke up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the cats didn't feel it. I shall tell Daisy about that. You have\r\nknown a great many interesting things, haven't you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi, and\r\nfell to meditating on the vast experience of a boy who had run away more\r\nthan once, and taken care of himself in a big city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWish I hadn't sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Don't remembering them feel good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's very singular how hard it is to manage your mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi,\r\nclasping his hands round his knees, and looking up at the sky as if for\r\ninformation upon his favorite topic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevilish hard no, I don't mean that;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan bit his lips, for the\r\nforbidden word slipped out in spite of him, and he wanted to be more\r\ncareful with Demi than with any of the other boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll play I didn't hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi; \xe2\x80\x9cand you won't do it again, I'm\r\nsure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I can help it. That's one of the things I don't want to\r\nremember. I keep pegging away, but it don't seem to do much good;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nDan looked discouraged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it does. You don't say half so many bad words as you used to; and\r\nAunt Jo is pleased, because she said it was a hard habit to break up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan cheered up a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must put swearing away in your fault-drawer, and lock it up; that's\r\nthe way I do with my badness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, looking as if he found Demi almost as\r\namusing as a new sort of cockchafer or beetle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it's one of my private plays, and I'll tell you, but I think\r\nyou'll laugh at it,\xe2\x80\x9d began Demi, glad to hold forth on this congenial\r\nsubject. \xe2\x80\x9cI play that my mind is a round room, and my soul is a little\r\nsort of creature with wings that lives in it. The walls are full of\r\nshelves and drawers, and in them I keep my thoughts, and my goodness and\r\nbadness, and all sorts of things. The goods I keep where I can see\r\nthem, and the bads I lock up tight, but they get out, and I have to\r\nkeep putting them in and squeezing them down, they are so strong. The\r\nthoughts I play with when I am alone or in bed, and I make up and do\r\nwhat I like with them. Every Sunday I put my room in order, and talk\r\nwith the little spirit that lives there, and tell him what to do. He is\r\nvery bad sometimes, and won't mind me, and I have to scold him, and take\r\nhim to Grandpa. He always makes him behave, and be sorry for his faults,\r\nbecause Grandpa likes this play, and gives me nice things to put in the\r\ndrawers, and tells me how to shut up the naughties. Hadn't you better\r\ntry that way? It's a very good one;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi looked so earnest and full\r\nof faith, that Dan did not laugh at his quaint fancy, but said, soberly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think there is a lock strong enough to keep my badness shut up.\r\nAny way my room is in such a clutter I don't know how to clear it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou keep your drawers in the cabinet all spandy nice; why can't you do\r\nthe others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain't used to it. Will you show me how?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked as if\r\ninclined to try Demi's childish way of keeping a soul in order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd love to, but I don't know how, except to talk as Grandpa does. I\r\ncan't do it good like him, but I'll try.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't tell any one; only now and then we'll come here and talk things\r\nover, and I'll pay you for it by telling all I know about my sort of\r\nthings. Will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan held out his big, rough hand.\r\n\r\nDemi gave his smooth, little hand readily, and the league was made;\r\nfor in the happy, peaceful world where the younger boy lived, lions\r\nand lambs played together, and little children innocently taught their\r\nelders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, pointing toward the house, as Demi was about to\r\nindulge in another discourse on the best way of getting badness down,\r\nand keeping it down; and peeping from their perch, they saw Mrs. Jo\r\nstrolling slowly along, reading as she went, while Teddy trotted behind\r\nher, dragging a little cart upside down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till they see us,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Demi, and both sat still as the pair\r\ncame nearer, Mrs. Jo so absorbed in her book that she would have walked\r\ninto the brook if Teddy had not stopped her by saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarmar, I wanter fis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo put down the charming book which she had been trying to read for\r\na week, and looked about her for a fishing-pole, being used to making\r\ntoys out of nothing. Before she had broken one from the hedge, a\r\nslender willow bough fell at her feet; and, looking up, she saw the boys\r\nlaughing in the nest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp! up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Teddy, stretching his arms and flapping his skirts as if\r\nabout to fly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll come down and you come up. I must go to Daisy now;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi\r\ndeparted to rehearse the tale of the nineteen cats, with the exciting\r\nboot-and-barrel episodes.\r\n\r\nTeddy was speedily whisked up; and then Dan said, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, too;\r\nthere's plenty of room. I'll lend you a hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo glanced over her shoulder, but no one was in sight; and rather\r\nliking the joke of the thing, she laughed back, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you\r\nwon't mention it, I think I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and with two nimble steps was in the\r\nwillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven't climbed a tree since I was married. I used to be very fond\r\nof it when I was a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking well-pleased with her shady\r\nperch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you read if you want to, and I'll take care of Teddy,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed\r\nDan, beginning to make a fishing-rod for impatient Baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think I care about it now. What were you and Demi at up here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Mrs. Jo, thinking, from the sober look on Dan's face, that he had\r\nsomething on his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! we were talking. I'd been telling him about leaves and things, and\r\nhe was telling me some of his queer plays. Now, then, Major, fish away;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Dan finished off his work by putting a big blue fly on the bent pin\r\nwhich hung at the end of the cord he had tied to the willow-rod.\r\n\r\nTeddy leaned down from the tree, and was soon wrapt up in watching\r\nfor the fish which he felt sure would come. Dan held him by his little\r\npetticoats, lest he should take a \xe2\x80\x9cheader\xe2\x80\x9d into the brook, and Mrs. Jo\r\nsoon won him to talk by doing so herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad you told Demi about 'leaves and things;' it is just what\r\nhe needs; and I wish you would teach him, and take him to walk with\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to, he is so bright; but--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't think you'd trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Demi is so kind of precious, and so good, and I'm such a bad lot,\r\nI thought you'd keep him away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not a 'bad lot,' as you say; and I do trust you, Dan,\r\nentirely, because you honestly try to improve, and do better and better\r\nevery week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked up at her with the cloud of despondency lifting\r\nfrom his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; don't you feel it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped so, but I didn't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been waiting and watching quietly, for I thought I'd give you a\r\ngood trial first; and if you stood it, I would give you the best reward\r\nI had. You have stood it well; and now I'm going to trust not only Demi,\r\nbut my own boy, to you, because you can teach them some things better\r\nthan any of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked amazed at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi has lived among older people so much that he needs just what you\r\nhave knowledge of common things, strength, and courage. He thinks you\r\nare the bravest boy he ever saw, and admires your strong way of doing\r\nthings. Then you know a great deal about natural objects, and can tell\r\nhim more wonderful tales of birds, and bees, and leaves, and animals,\r\nthan his story-books give him; and, being true, these stories will teach\r\nand do him good. Don't you see now how much you can help him, and why I\r\nlike to have him with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I swear sometimes, and might tell him something wrong. I wouldn't\r\nmean to, but it might slip out, just as 'devil' did a few minutes ago,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Dan, anxious to do his duty, and let her know his shortcomings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you try not to say or do any thing to harm the little fellow,\r\nand here is where I think Demi will help you, because he is so innocent\r\nand wise in his small way, and has what I am trying to give you, dear,\r\ngood principles. It is never too early to try and plant them in a child,\r\nand never too late to cultivate them in the most neglected person. You\r\nare only boys yet; you can teach one another. Demi will unconsciously\r\nstrengthen your moral sense, you will strengthen his common sense, and I\r\nshall feel as if I had helped you both.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWords could not express how pleased and touched Dan was by this\r\nconfidence and praise. No one had ever trusted him before, no one had\r\ncared to find out and foster the good in him, and no one had suspected\r\nhow much there was hidden away in the breast of the neglected boy, going\r\nfast to ruin, yet quick to feel and value sympathy and help. No honor\r\nthat he might earn hereafter would ever be half so precious as the right\r\nto teach his few virtues and small store of learning to the child\r\nwhom he most respected; and no more powerful restraint could have been\r\nimposed upon him than the innocent companion confided to his care. He\r\nfound courage now to tell Mrs. Jo of the plan already made with Demi,\r\nand she was glad that the first step had been so naturally taken. Every\r\nthing seemed to be working well for Dan, and she rejoiced over him,\r\nbecause it had seemed a hard task, yet, working on with a firm belief in\r\nthe possibility of reformation in far older and worse subjects than he,\r\nthere had come this quick and hopeful change to encourage her. He felt\r\nthat he had friends now and a place in the world, something to live and\r\nwork for, and, though he said little, all that was best and bravest in a\r\ncharacter made old by a hard experience responded to the love and faith\r\nbestowed on him, and Dan's salvation was assured.\r\n\r\nTheir quiet talk was interrupted by a shout of delight from Teddy, who,\r\nto the surprise of every one, did actually catch a trout where no trout\r\nhad been seen for years. He was so enchanted with his splendid success\r\nthat he insisted on showing his prize to the family before Asia cooked\r\nit for supper; so the three descended and went happily away together,\r\nall satisfied with the work of that half hour.\r\n\r\nNed was the next visitor to the tree, but he only made a short stay,\r\nsitting there at his ease while Dick and Dolly caught a pailful of\r\ngrasshoppers and crickets for him. He wanted to play a joke on Tommy,\r\nand intended to tuck up a few dozen of the lively creatures in his bed,\r\nso that when Bangs got in he would speedily tumble out again, and pass\r\na portion of the night in chasing \xe2\x80\x9chopper-grasses\xe2\x80\x9d round the room. The\r\nhunt was soon over, and having paid the hunters with a few peppermints\r\napiece Ned retired to make Tommy's bed.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the old willow sighed and sung to itself, talked with the\r\nbrook, and watched the lengthening shadows as the sun went down. The\r\nfirst rosy color was touching its graceful branches when a boy came\r\nstealing up the avenue, across the lawn, and, spying Billy by the\r\nbrook-side, went to him, saying, in a mysterious tone,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell Mr. Bhaer I want to see him down here, please. Don't let\r\nany one hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBilly nodded and ran off, while the boy swung himself up into the tree,\r\nand sat there looking anxious, yet evidently feeling the charm of the\r\nplace and hour. In five minutes, Mr. Bhaer appeared, and, stepping up on\r\nthe fence, leaned into the nest, saying, kindly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you, Jack; but why not come in and meet us all at\r\nonce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see you first, please, sir. Uncle made me come back. I know\r\nI don't deserve any thing, but I hope the fellows won't be hard upon\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Jack did not get on very well, but it was evident that he was sorry\r\nand ashamed, and wanted to be received as easily as possible; for his\r\nUncle had thrashed him well and scolded him soundly for following the\r\nexample he himself set. Jack had begged not to be sent back, but the\r\nschool was cheap, and Mr. Ford insisted, so the boy returned as quietly\r\nas possible, and took refuge behind Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, but I can't answer for them, though I will see that they\r\nare not unjust. I think, as Dan and Nat have suffered so much, being\r\ninnocent, you should suffer something, being guilty. Don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMr. Bhaer, pitying Jack, yet feeling he deserved punishment for a fault\r\nwhich had so little excuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so, but I sent Tommy's money back, and I said I was sorry,\r\nisn't that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack, rather sullenly; for the boy who could do\r\nso mean a thing was not brave enough to bear the consequences well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I think you should ask pardon of all three boys, openly and\r\nhonestly. You cannot expect them to respect and trust you for a time,\r\nbut you can live down this disgrace if you try, and I will help you.\r\nStealing and lying are detestable sins, and I hope this will be a lesson\r\nto you. I am glad you are ashamed, it is a good sign; bear it patiently,\r\nand do your best to earn a better reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll have an auction, and sell off all my goods dirt cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack,\r\nshowing his repentance in the most characteristic way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be better to give them away, and begin on a new\r\nfoundation. Take 'Honesty is the best policy' for your motto, and live\r\nup to it in act, and word, and thought, and though you don't make a cent\r\nof money this summer, you will be a rich boy in the autumn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBhaer, earnestly.\r\n\r\nIt was hard, but Jack consented, for he really felt that cheating didn't\r\npay, and wanted to win back the friendship of the boys. His heart clung\r\nto his possessions, and he groaned inwardly at the thought of actually\r\ngiving away certain precious things. Asking pardon publicly was easy\r\ncompared to this; but then he began to discover that certain other\r\nthings, invisible, but most valuable, were better property than knives,\r\nfish-hooks, or even money itself. So he decided to buy up a little\r\nintegrity, even at a high price, and secure the respect of his\r\nplaymates, though it was not a salable article.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a sudden air of resolution, which\r\npleased Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! and I'll stand by you. Now come and begin at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Father Bhaer led the bankrupt boy back into the little world, which\r\nreceived him coldly at first, but slowly warmed to him, when he showed\r\nthat he had profited by the lesson, and was sincerely anxious to go into\r\na better business with a new stock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. TAMING THE COLT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world is that boy doing?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo to herself, as she\r\nwatched Dan running round the half-mile triangle as if for a wager.\r\nHe was all alone, and seemed possessed by some strange desire to run\r\nhimself into a fever, or break his neck; for, after several rounds, he\r\ntried leaping walls, and turning somersaults up the avenue, and finally\r\ndropped down on the grass before the door as if exhausted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you training for a race, Dan?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo, from the window where\r\nshe sat.\r\n\r\nHe looked up quickly, and stopped panting to answer, with a laugh,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I'm only working off my steam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't you find a cooler way of doing it? You will be ill if you tear\r\nabout so in such warm weather,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, laughing also, as she\r\nthrew him out a great palm-leaf fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't help it. I must run somewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, with such an odd\r\nexpression in his restless eyes, that Mrs. Jo was troubled, and asked,\r\nquickly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Plumfield getting too narrow for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn't mind if it was a little bigger. I like it though; only the\r\nfact is the devil gets into me sometimes, and then I do want to bolt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words seemed to come against his will, for he looked sorry the\r\nminute they were spoken, and seemed to think he deserved a reproof for\r\nhis ingratitude. But Mrs. Jo understood the feeling, and though sorry to\r\nsee it, she could not blame the boy for confessing it. She looked at him\r\nanxiously, seeing how tall and strong he had grown, how full of energy\r\nhis face was, with its eager eyes and resolute mouth; and remembering\r\nthe utter freedom he had known for years before, she felt how even the\r\ngentle restraint of this home would weigh upon him at times when the old\r\nlawless spirit stirred in him. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cmy wild hawk\r\nneeds a larger cage; and yet, if I let him go, I am afraid he will be\r\nlost. I must try and find some lure strong enough to keep him safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know all about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not 'the devil,' as you\r\ncall it, but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty. I\r\nused to feel just so, and once, I really did think for a minute that I\r\nwould bolt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn't you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, coming to lean on the low window-ledge, with\r\nan evident desire to continue the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it was foolish, and love for my mother kept me at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven't got any mother,\xe2\x80\x9d began Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, gently stroking the rough hair\r\noff his hot forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are no end good to me, and I can't ever thank you enough, but it\r\njust isn't the same, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked up at her with a wistful,\r\nhungry look that went to her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear, it is not the same, and never can be. I think an own mother\r\nwould have been a great deal to you. But as that cannot be, you must\r\ntry to let me fill her place. I fear I have not done all I ought, or you\r\nwould not want to leave me,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't want to go, and I won't\r\ngo, if I can help it; but every now and then I feel as if I must burst\r\nout somehow. I want to run straight ahead somewhere, to smash something,\r\nor pitch into somebody. Don't know why, but I do, and that's all about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan laughed as he spoke, but he meant what he said, for he knit his\r\nblack brows, and brought down his fist on the ledge with such force,\r\nthat Mrs. Jo's thimble flew off into the grass. He brought it back, and\r\nas she took it she held the big, brown hand a minute, saying, with a\r\nlook that showed the words cost her something,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Dan, run if you must, but don't run very far; and come back to me\r\nsoon, for I want you very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was rather taken aback by this unexpected permission to play truant,\r\nand somehow it seemed to lessen his desire to go. He did not understand\r\nwhy, but Mrs. Jo did, and, knowing the natural perversity of the human\r\nmind, counted on it to help her now. She felt instinctively that the\r\nmore the boy was restrained the more he would fret against it; but leave\r\nhim free, and the mere sense of liberty would content him, joined to the\r\nknowledge that his presence was dear to those whom he loved best. It was\r\na little experiment, but it succeeded, for Dan stood silent a moment,\r\nunconsciously picking the fan to pieces and turning the matter over\r\nin his mind. He felt that she appealed to his heart and his honor,\r\nand owned that he understood it by saying presently, with a mixture of\r\nregret and resolution in his face,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't go yet awhile, and I'll give you fair warning before I bolt.\r\nThat's fair, isn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will let it stand so. Now, I want to see if I can't find some\r\nway for you to work off your steam better than running about the place\r\nlike a mad dog, spoiling my fans, or fighting with the boys. What can we\r\ninvent?\xe2\x80\x9d and while Dan tried to repair the mischief he had done, Mrs.\r\nJo racked her brain for some new device to keep her truant safe until he\r\nhad learned to love his lessons better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow would you like to be my express-man?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as a sudden thought\r\npopped into her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo into town, and do the errands?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan, looking interested at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Franz is tired of it, Silas cannot be spared just now, and Mr.\r\nBhaer has no time. Old Andy is a safe horse, you are a good driver, and\r\nknow your way about the city as well as a postman. Suppose you try it,\r\nand see if it won't do most as well to drive away two or three times a\r\nweek as to run away once a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like it ever so much, only I must go alone and do it all myself. I\r\ndon't want any of the other fellows bothering round,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, taking\r\nto the new idea so kindly that he began to put on business airs already.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Bhaer does not object you shall have it all your own way. I\r\nsuppose Emil will growl, but he cannot be trusted with horses, and you\r\ncan. By the way, to-morrow is market-day, and I must make out my list.\r\nYou had better see that the wagon is in order, and tell Silas to have\r\nthe fruit and vegetables ready for mother. You will have to be up early\r\nand get back in time for school, can you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm always an early bird, so I don't mind,\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan slung on his jacket\r\nwith despatch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe early bird got the worm this time, I'm sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo,\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a jolly good worm it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, as he went laughing away to\r\nput a new lash to the whip, wash the wagon, and order Silas about with\r\nall the importance of a young express-man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore he is tired of this I will find something else and have it ready\r\nwhen the next restless fit comes on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo to herself, as she\r\nwrote her list with a deep sense of gratitude that all her boys were not\r\nDans.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer did not entirely approve of the new plan, but agreed to give\r\nit a trial, which put Dan on his mettle, and caused him to give up\r\ncertain wild plans of his own, in which the new lash and the long\r\nhill were to have borne a part. He was up and away very early the next\r\nmorning, heroically resisting the temptation to race with the milkmen\r\ngoing into town. Once there, he did his errands carefully, to Mr.\r\nBhaer's surprise and Mrs. Jo's great satisfaction. The Commodore did\r\ngrowl at Dan's promotion, but was pacified by a superior padlock to his\r\nnew boat-house, and the thought that seamen were meant for higher honors\r\nthan driving market-wagons and doing family errands. So Dan filled\r\nhis new office well and contentedly for weeks, and said no more about\r\nbolting. But one day Mr. Bhaer found him pummelling Jack, who was\r\nroaring for mercy under his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Dan, I thought you had given up fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he went to\r\nthe rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe ain't fighting, we are only wrestling,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, leaving off\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks very much like it, and feels like it, hey, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nBhaer, as the defeated gentleman got upon his legs with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCatch me wrestling with him again. He's most knocked my head off,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n snarled Jack, holding on to that portion of his frame as if it really\r\nwas loose upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is, we began in fun, but when I got him down I couldn't help\r\npounding him. Sorry I hurt you, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Dan, looking\r\nrather ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. The longing to pitch into somebody was so strong you\r\ncouldn't resist. You are a sort of Berserker, Dan, and something to\r\ntussle with is as necessary to you as music is to Nat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer,\r\nwho knew all about the conversation between the boy and Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't help it. So if you don't want to be pounded you'd better keep out\r\nof the way,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, with a warning look in his black eyes that\r\nmade Jack sheer off in haste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want something to wrestle with, I will give you a tougher\r\nspecimen than Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer; and, leading the way to the\r\nwood-yard, he pointed out certain roots of trees that had been grubbed\r\nup in the spring, and had been lying there waiting to be split.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, when you feel inclined to maltreat the boys, just come and work\r\noff your energies here, and I'll thank you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and, seizing the axe that lay near Dan hauled out a tough\r\nroot, and went at it so vigorously, that the chips flew far and wide,\r\nand Mr. Bhaer fled for his life.\r\n\r\nTo his great amusement, Dan took him at his word, and was often seen\r\nwrestling with the ungainly knots, hat and jacket off, red face, and\r\nwrathful eyes; for he got into royal rages over some of his adversaries,\r\nand swore at them under his breath till he had conquered them, when he\r\nexulted, and marched off to the shed with an armful of gnarled oak-wood\r\nin triumph. He blistered his hands, tired his back, and dulled the axe,\r\nbut it did him good, and he got more comfort out of the ugly roots than\r\nany one dreamed, for with each blow he worked off some of the pent-up\r\npower that would otherwise have been expended in some less harmless way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen this is gone I really don't know what I shall do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo\r\nto herself, for no inspiration came, and she was at the end of her\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nBut Dan found a new occupation for himself, and enjoyed it some time\r\nbefore any one discovered the cause of his contentment. A fine young\r\nhorse of Mr. Laurie's was kept at Plumfield that summer, running loose\r\nin a large pasture across the brook. The boys were all interested in the\r\nhandsome, spirited creature, and for a time were fond of watching him\r\ngallop and frisk with his plumey tail flying, and his handsome head\r\nin the air. But they soon got tired of it, and left Prince Charlie to\r\nhimself. All but Dan, he never tired of looking at the horse, and seldom\r\nfailed to visit him each day with a lump of sugar, a bit of bread, or\r\nan apple to make him welcome. Charlie was grateful, accepted his\r\nfriendship, and the two loved one another as if they felt some tie\r\nbetween them, inexplicable but strong. In whatever part of the wide\r\nfield he might be, Charlie always came at full speed when Dan whistled\r\nat the bars, and the boy was never happier than when the beautiful,\r\nfleet creature put its head on his shoulder, looking up at him with fine\r\neyes full of intelligent affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand one another without any palaver, don't we, old fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Dan would say, proud of the horse's confidence, and, so jealous of his\r\nregard, that he told no one how well the friendship prospered, and never\r\nasked anybody but Teddy to accompany him on these daily visits.\r\n\r\nMr. Laurie came now and then to see how Charlie got on, and spoke of\r\nhaving him broken to harness in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't need much taming, he is such a gentle, fine-tempered brute. I\r\nshall come out and try him with a saddle myself some day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, on\r\none of these visits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lets me put a halter on him, but I don't believe he will bear a\r\nsaddle even if you put it on,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Dan, who never failed to be\r\npresent when Charlie and his master met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall coax him to bear it, and not mind a few tumbles at first. He\r\nhas never been harshly treated, so, though he will be surprised at the\r\nnew performance, I think he won't be frightened, and his antics will do\r\nno harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder what he would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan to himself, as Mr. Laurie went\r\naway with the Professor, and Charlie returned to the bars, from which he\r\nhad retired when the gentlemen came up.\r\n\r\nA daring fancy to try the experiment took possession of the boy as he\r\nsat on the topmost rail with the glossy back temptingly near him.\r\nNever thinking of danger, he obeyed the impulse, and while Charlie\r\nunsuspectingly nibbled at the apple he held, Dan quickly and quietly\r\ntook his seat. He did not keep it long, however, for with an astonished\r\nsnort, Charlie reared straight up, and deposited Dan on the ground. The\r\nfall did not hurt him, for the turf was soft, and he jumped up, saying,\r\nwith a laugh,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did it anyway! Come here, you rascal, and I'll try it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Charlie declined to approach, and Dan left him resolving to succeed\r\nin the end; for a struggle like this suited him exactly. Next time he\r\ntook a halter, and having got it on, he played with the horse for a\r\nwhile, leading him to and fro, and putting him through various antics\r\ntill he was a little tired; then Dan sat on the wall and gave him bread,\r\nbut watched his chance, and getting a good grip of the halter, slipped\r\non to his back. Charlie tried the old trick, but Dan held on, having had\r\npractice with Toby, who occasionally had an obstinate fit, and tried to\r\nshake off his rider. Charlie was both amazed and indignant; and after\r\nprancing for a minute, set off at a gallop, and away went Dan heels over\r\nhead. If he had not belonged to the class of boys who go through all\r\nsorts of dangers unscathed, he would have broken his neck; as it was, he\r\ngot a heavy fall, and lay still collecting his wits, while Charlie tore\r\nround the field tossing his head with every sign of satisfaction at\r\nthe discomfiture of his rider. Presently it seemed to occur to him that\r\nsomething was wrong with Dan, and, being of a magnanimous nature, he\r\nwent to see what the matter was. Dan let him sniff about and perplex\r\nhimself for a few minutes; then he looked up at him, saying, as\r\ndecidedly as if the horse could understand,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think you have beaten, but you are mistaken, old boy; and I'll ride\r\nyou yet see if I don't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried no more that day, but soon after attempted a new method of\r\nintroducing Charlie to a burden. He strapped a folded blanket on his\r\nback, and then let him race, and rear, and roll, and fume as much as\r\nhe liked. After a few fits of rebellion Charlie submitted, and in a few\r\ndays permitted Dan to mount him, often stopped short to look round, as\r\nif he said, half patiently, half reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't understand it,\r\nbut I suppose you mean no harm, so I permit the liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan patted and praised him, and took a short turn every day, getting\r\nfrequent falls, but persisting in spite of them, and longing to try a\r\nsaddle and bridle, but not daring to confess what he had done. He had\r\nhis wish, however, for there had been a witness of his pranks who said a\r\ngood word for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what that chap has ben doin' lately?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Silas of his\r\nmaster, one evening, as he received his orders for the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, with an air of resignation, expecting some\r\nsad revelation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan, he's ben a breaking the colt, sir, and I wish I may die if he\r\nain't done it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Silas, chuckling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, I kinder keep an eye on the little fellers, and most gen'lly know\r\nwhat they're up to; so when Dan kep going off to the paster, and coming\r\nhome black and blue, I mistrusted that suthing was goin' on. I didn't\r\nsay nothin', but I crep up into the barn chamber, and from there I see\r\nhim goin' through all manner of games with Charlie. Blest if he warn't\r\nthrowed time and agin, and knocked round like a bag o' meal. But the\r\npluck of that boy did beat all, and he 'peared to like it, and kep on as\r\nef bound to beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Silas, you should have stopped it the boy might have been killed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Bhaer, wondering what freak his irrepressibles would take into\r\ntheir heads next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cS'pose I oughter; but there warn't no real danger, for Charlie ain't\r\nno tricks, and is as pretty a tempered horse as ever I see. Fact was, I\r\ncouldn't bear to spile sport, for ef there's any thing I do admire it's\r\ngrit, and Dan is chock full on 't. But now I know he's hankerin' after\r\na saddle, and yet won't take even the old one on the sly; so I just\r\nthought I'd up and tell, and may be you'd let him try what he can do.\r\nMr. Laurie won't mind, and Charlie's all the better for 't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see;\xe2\x80\x9d and off went Mr. Bhaer to inquire into the matter.\r\n\r\nDan owned up at once, and proudly proved that Silas was right by showing\r\noff his power over Charlie; for by dint of much coaxing, many carrots,\r\nand infinite perseverance, he really had succeeded in riding the colt\r\nwith a halter and blanket. Mr. Laurie was much amused, and well pleased\r\nwith Dan's courage and skill, and let him have a hand in all future\r\nperformances; for he set about Charlie's education at once, saying\r\nthat he was not going to be outdone by a slip of a boy. Thanks to Dan,\r\nCharlie took kindly to the saddle and bridle when he had once reconciled\r\nhimself to the indignity of the bit; and after Mr. Laurie had trained\r\nhim a little, Dan was permitted to ride him, to the great envy and\r\nadmiration of the other boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't he handsome? and don't he mind me like a lamb?\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan one day\r\nas he dismounted and stood with his arm round Charlie's neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and isn't he a much more useful and agreeable animal than the\r\nwild colt who spent his days racing about the field, jumping fences, and\r\nrunning away now and then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Bhaer from the steps where she\r\nalways appeared when Dan performed with Charlie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he is. See he won't run away now, even if I don't hold him,\r\nand he comes to me the minute I whistle; I have tamed him well, haven't\r\nI?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dan looked both proud and pleased, as well he might, for, in\r\nspite of their struggles together, Charlie loved him better than his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am taming a colt too, and I think I shall succeed as well as you if\r\nI am as patient and persevering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, smiling so significantly\r\nat him, that Dan understood and answered, laughing, yet in earnest,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won't jump over the fence and run away, but stay and let them make a\r\nhandsome, useful span of us, hey, Charlie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. COMPOSITION DAY\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurry up, boys, it's three o'clock, and Uncle Fritz likes us to be\r\npunctual, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz one Wednesday afternoon as a bell rang,\r\nand a stream of literary-looking young gentlemen with books and paper in\r\ntheir hands were seen going toward the museum.\r\n\r\nTommy was in the school-room, bending over his desk, much bedaubed with\r\nink, flushed with the ardor of inspiration, and in a great hurry as\r\nusual, for easy-going Bangs never was ready till the very last minute.\r\nAs Franz passed the door looking up laggards, Tommy gave one last blot\r\nand flourish, and departed out the window, waving his paper to dry as\r\nhe went. Nan followed, looking very important, with a large roll in her\r\nhand, and Demi escorted Daisy, both evidently brimful of some delightful\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nThe museum was all in order, and the sunshine among the hop-vines made\r\npretty shadows on the floor as it peeped through the great window. On\r\none side sat Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer, on the other was a little table\r\non which the compositions were laid as soon as read, and in a large\r\nsemicircle sat the children on camp-stools which occasionally shut up\r\nand let the sitter down, thus preventing any stiffness in the assembly.\r\nAs it took too much time to have all read, they took turns, and on this\r\nWednesday the younger pupils were the chief performers, while the elder\r\nones listened with condescension and criticised freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLadies first; so Nan may begin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, when the settling of\r\nstools and rustling of papers had subsided.\r\n\r\nNan took her place beside the little table, and, with a preliminary\r\ngiggle, read the following interesting essay on,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE SPONGE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sponge, my friends, is a most useful and interesting plant. It\r\ngrows on rocks under the water, and is a kind of sea-weed, I believe.\r\nPeople go and pick it and dry it and wash it, because little fish and\r\ninsects live in the holes of the sponge; I found shells in my new one,\r\nand sand. Some are very fine and soft; babies are washed with them. The\r\nsponge has many uses. I will relate some of them, and I hope my friends\r\nwill remember what I say. One use is to wash the face; I don't like it\r\nmyself, but I do it because I wish to be clean. Some people don't, and\r\nthey are dirty.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the eye of the reader rested sternly upon Dick and\r\nDolly, who quailed under it, and instantly resolved to scrub themselves\r\nvirtuously on all occasions. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother use is to wake people up; I allude\r\nto boys par-tic-u-lar-ly.\xe2\x80\x9d Another pause after the long word to enjoy\r\nthe smothered laugh that went round the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSome boys do not get\r\nup when called, and Mary Ann squeezes the water out of a wet sponge\r\non their faces, and it makes them so mad they wake up.\xe2\x80\x9d Here the laugh\r\nbroke out, and Emil said, as if he had been hit,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems to me you are wandering from the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain't; we are to write about vegetables or animals, and I'm doing\r\nboth: for boys are animals, aren't they?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan; and, undaunted by\r\nthe indignant \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted at her, she calmly proceeded,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more interesting thing is done with sponges, and this is when\r\ndoctors put ether on it, and hold it to people's noses when they have\r\nteeth out. I shall do this when I am bigger, and give ether to the sick,\r\nso they will go to sleep and not feel me cut off their legs and arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know somebody who killed cats with it,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Demi, but was\r\npromptly crushed by Dan, who upset his camp-stool and put a hat over his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be interruckted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, frowning upon the unseemly\r\nscrimmagers. Order was instantly restored, and the young lady closed her\r\nremarks as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy composition has three morals, my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d Somebody groaned, but no\r\nnotice was taken of the insult. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, is keep your faces clean second,\r\nget up early third, when the ether sponge is put over your nose, breathe\r\nhard and don't kick, and your teeth will come out easy. I have no more\r\nto say.\xe2\x80\x9d And Miss Nan sat down amid tumultuous applause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very remarkable composition; its tone is high, and there is\r\na good deal of humor in it. Very well done, Nan. Now, Daisy,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr.\r\nBhaer smiled at one young lady as he beckoned the other.\r\n\r\nDaisy colored prettily as she took her place, and said, in her modest\r\nlittle voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid you won't like mine; it isn't nice and funny like Nan's. But\r\nI couldn't do any better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe always like yours, Posy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Fritz, and a gentle murmur from\r\nthe boys seemed to confirm the remark. Thus encouraged, Daisy read her\r\nlittle paper, which was listened to with respectful attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHE CAT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cat is a sweet animal. I love them very much. They are clean and\r\npretty, and catch rats and mice, and let you pet them, and are fond\r\nof you if you are kind. They are very wise, and can find their way\r\nanywhere. Little cats are called kittens, and are dear things. I have\r\ntwo, named Huz and Buz, and their mother is Topaz, because she has\r\nyellow eyes. Uncle told me a pretty story about a man named Ma-ho-met.\r\nHe had a nice cat, and when she was asleep on his sleeve, and he wanted\r\nto go away, he cut off the sleeve so as not to wake her up. I think he\r\nwas a kind man. Some cats catch fish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Teddy, jumping up eager to tell about his trout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, setting him down again as quickly as possible,\r\nfor orderly Daisy hated to be \xe2\x80\x9cinterruckted,\xe2\x80\x9d as Nan expressed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read about one who used to do it very slyly. I tried to make Topaz,\r\nbut she did not like the water, and scratched me. She does like tea, and\r\nwhen I play in my kitchen she pats the teapot with her paw, till I give\r\nher some. She is a fine cat, she eats apple-pudding and molasses. Most\r\ncats do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's a first-rater,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Nat, and Daisy retired, pleased with\r\nthe praise of her friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDemi looks so impatient we must have him up at once or he won't hold\r\nout,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Fritz, and Demi skipped up with alacrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine is a poem!\xe2\x80\x9d he announced in a tone of triumph, and read his first\r\neffort in a loud and solemn voice:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI write about the butterfly,\r\n       It is a pretty thing;\r\n     And flies about like the birds,\r\n       But it does not sing.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFirst it is a little grub,\r\n       And then it is a nice yellow cocoon,\r\n     And then the butterfly\r\n       Eats its way out soon.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThey live on dew and honey,\r\n       They do not have any hive,\r\n     They do not sting like wasps, and bees, and hornets,\r\n       And to be as good as they are we should strive.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be a beautiful butterfly,\r\n       All yellow, and blue, and green, and red;\r\n     But I should not like\r\n       To have Dan put camphor on my poor little head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis unusual burst of genius brought down the house, and Demi was\r\nobliged to read it again, a somewhat difficult task, as there was no\r\npunctuation whatever, and the little poet's breath gave out before he\r\ngot to the end of some of the long lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be a Shakespeare yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo, laughing as if she would\r\ndie, for this poetic gem reminded her of one of her own, written at the\r\nage of ten, and beginning gloomily,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had a quiet tomb,\r\n       Beside a little rill;\r\n     Where birds, and bees, and butterflies,\r\n       Would sing upon the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Tommy. If there is as much ink inside your paper as there is\r\noutside, it will be a long composition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, when Demi had\r\nbeen induced to tear himself from his poem and sit down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't a composition, it's a letter. You see, I forgot all about its\r\nbeing my turn till after school, and then I didn't know what to have,\r\nand there wasn't time to read up; so I thought you wouldn't mind my\r\ntaking a letter that I wrote to my Grandma. It's got something about\r\nbirds in it, so I thought it would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this long excuse, Tommy plunged into a sea of ink and floundered\r\nthrough, pausing now and then to decipher one of his own flourishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR GRANDMA, I hope you are well. Uncle James sent me a pocket\r\nrifle. It is a beautiful little instrument of killing, shaped like\r\nthis [Here Tommy displayed a remarkable sketch of what looked like\r\nan intricate pump, or the inside of a small steam-engine] 44 are the\r\nsights; 6 is a false stock that fits in at A; 3 is the trigger, and 2\r\nis the cock. It loads at the breech, and fires with great force and\r\nstraightness. I am going out shooting squirrels soon. I shot several\r\nfine birds for the museum. They had speckled breasts, and Dan liked\r\nthem very much. He stuffed them tip-top, and they sit on the tree quite\r\nnatural, only one looks a little tipsy. We had a Frenchman working here\r\nthe other day, and Asia called his name so funnily that I will tell\r\nyou about it. His name was Germain: first she called him Jerry, but we\r\nlaughed at her, and she changed it to Jeremiah; but ridicule was\r\nthe result, so it became Mr. Germany; but ridicule having been again\r\nresumed, it became Garrymon, which it has remained ever since. I do not\r\nwrite often, I am so busy; but I think of you often, and sympathize with\r\nyou, and sincerely hope you get on as well as can be expected without\r\nme. Your affectionate grandson,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTHOMAS BUCKMINSTER BANGS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.? If you come across any postage-stamps, remember me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN.B. Love to all, and a great deal to Aunt Almira. Does she make any\r\nnice plum-cakes now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.? Mrs. Bhaer sends her respects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.? And so would Mr. B, if he knew I was in act to write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN.B. Father is going to give me a watch on my birthday. I am glad as at\r\npresent I have no means of telling time, and am often late at school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S.? I hope to see you soon. Don't you wish to send for me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cT. B. B.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAs each postscript was received with a fresh laugh from the boys, by the\r\ntime he came to the sixth and last, Tommy was so exhausted that he was\r\nglad to sit down and wipe his ruddy face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the dear old lady will live through it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, under\r\ncover of the noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won't take any notice of the broad hint given in that last P.S.\r\nThe letter will be quite as much as she can bear without a visit from\r\nTommy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Jo, remembering that the old lady usually took to\r\nher bed after a visitation from her irrepressible grandson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teddy, who had learned a bit of poetry, and was so eager\r\nto say it that he had been bobbing up and down during the reading, and\r\ncould no longer be restrained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid he will forget it if he waits; and I have had a deal of\r\ntrouble teaching him,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother.\r\n\r\nTeddy trotted to the rostrum, dropped a curtsey and nodded his head at\r\nthe same time, as if anxious to suit every one; then, in his baby voice,\r\nand putting the emphasis on the wrong words, he said his verse all in\r\none breath:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLittle drops of water,\r\n       Little drains of sand,\r\n     Mate a might okum (ocean),\r\n       And a peasant land.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLittle words of kindness,\r\n       Pokin evvy day,\r\n     Make a home a hebbin,\r\n       And hep us on a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClapping his hands at the end, he made another double salutation, and\r\nthen ran to hide his head in his mother's lap, quite overcome by the\r\nsuccess of his \xe2\x80\x9cpiece,\xe2\x80\x9d for the applause was tremendous.\r\n\r\nDick and Dolly did not write, but were encouraged to observe the habits\r\nof animals and insects, and report what they saw. Dick liked this, and\r\nalways had a great deal to say; so, when his name was called, he marched\r\nup, and, looking at the audience with his bright confiding eyes, told\r\nhis little story so earnestly that no one smiled at his crooked body,\r\nbecause the \xe2\x80\x9cstraight soul\xe2\x80\x9d shone through it beautifully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've been watching dragonflies, and I read about them in Dan's book,\r\nand I'll try and tell you what I remember. There's lots of them flying\r\nround on the pond, all blue, with big eyes, and sort of lace wings,\r\nvery pretty. I caught one, and looked at him, and I think he was the\r\nhandsomest insect I ever saw. They catch littler creatures than they\r\nare to eat, and have a queer kind of hook thing that folds up when they\r\nain't hunting. It likes the sunshine, and dances round all day. Let me\r\nsee! what else was there to tell about? Oh, I know! The eggs are laid in\r\nthe water, and go down to the bottom, and are hatched in the mud. Little\r\nugly things come out of 'em; I can't say the name, but they are brown,\r\nand keep having new skins, and getting bigger and bigger. Only think! it\r\ntakes them two years to be a dragonfly! Now this is the curiousest part\r\nof it, so you listen tight, for I don't believe you know it. When it is\r\nready it knows somehow, and the ugly, grubby thing climbs up out of the\r\nwater on a flag or a bulrush, and bursts open its back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I don't believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, who was not an observant boy,\r\nand really thought Dick was \xe2\x80\x9cmaking up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does burst open its back, don't it?\xe2\x80\x9d and Dick appealed to Mr. Bhaer,\r\nwho nodded a very decided affirmative, to the little speaker's great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, out comes the dragonfly, all whole, and he sits in the sun sort\r\nof coming alive, you know; and he gets strong, and then he spreads his\r\npretty wings, and flies away up in the air, and never is a grub any\r\nmore. That's all I know; but I shall watch and try to see him do it, for\r\nI think it's splendid to turn into a beautiful dragonfly, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDick had told his story well, and, when he described the flight of the\r\nnew-born insect, had waved his hands, and looked up as if he saw, and\r\nwanted to follow it. Something in his face suggested to the minds of\r\nthe elder listeners the thought that some day little Dick would have his\r\nwish, and after years of helplessness and pain would climb up into the\r\nsun some happy day, and, leaving his poor little body behind him, find\r\na new lovely shape in a fairer world than this. Mrs. Jo drew him to her\r\nside, and said, with a kiss on his thin cheek,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a sweet little story, dear, and you remembered it wonderfully\r\nwell. I shall write and tell your mother all about it;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dick sat\r\non her knee, contentedly smiling at the praise, and resolving to watch\r\nwell, and catch the dragonfly in the act of leaving its old body for\r\nthe new, and see how he did it. Dolly had a few remarks to make upon\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cDuck,\xe2\x80\x9d and made them in a sing-song tone, for he had learned it by\r\nheart, and thought it a great plague to do it at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWild ducks are hard to kill; men hide and shoot at them, and have tame\r\nducks to quack and make the wild ones come where the men can fire at\r\nthem. They have wooden ducks made too, and they sail round, and the\r\nwild ones come to see them; they are stupid, I think. Our ducks are very\r\ntame. They eat a great deal, and go poking round in the mud and water.\r\nThey don't take good care of their eggs, but them spoil, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMine don't!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, some people's do; Silas said so. Hens take good care of little\r\nducks, only they don't like to have them go in the water, and make a\r\ngreat fuss. But the little ones don't care a bit. I like to eat ducks\r\nwith stuffing in them and lots of apple-sauce.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say about owls,\xe2\x80\x9d began Nat, who had carefully\r\nprepared a paper upon this subject with some help from Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwls have big heads, round eyes, hooked bills, and strong claws. Some\r\nare gray, some white, some black and yellowish. Their feathers are very\r\nsoft, and stick out a great deal. They fly very quietly, and hunt bats,\r\nmice, little birds, and such things. They build nests in barns, hollow\r\ntrees, and some take the nests of other birds. The great horned owl has\r\ntwo eggs bigger than a hen's and reddish brown. The tawny owl has\r\nfive eggs, white and smooth; and this is the kind that hoots at night.\r\nAnother kind sounds like a child crying. They eat mice and bats whole,\r\nand the parts that they cannot digest they make into little balls and\r\nspit out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gracious! how funny!\xe2\x80\x9d Nan was heard to observe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey cannot see by day; and if they get out into the light, they go\r\nflapping round half blind, and the other birds chase and peck at them,\r\nas if they were making fun. The horned owl is very big, 'most as big as\r\nthe eagle. It eats rabbits, rats, snakes, and birds; and lives in rocks\r\nand old tumble-down houses. They have a good many cries, and scream like\r\na person being choked, and say, 'Waugh O! waugh O!' and it scares people\r\nat night in the woods. The white owl lives by the sea, and in cold\r\nplaces, and looks something like a hawk. There is a kind of owl that\r\nmakes holes to live in like moles. It is called the burrowing owl, and\r\nis very small. The barn-owl is the commonest kind; and I have watched\r\none sitting in a hole in a tree, looking like a little gray cat, with\r\none eye shut and the other open. He comes out at dusk, and sits round\r\nwaiting for the bats. I caught one, and here he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Nat suddenly produced from inside his jacket a little downy\r\nbird, who blinked and ruffled his feathers, looking very plump and\r\nsleepy and scared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't touch him! He is going to show off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, displaying his new\r\npet with great pride. First he put a cocked hat on the bird's head,\r\nand the boys laughed at the funny effect; then he added a pair of paper\r\nspectacles, and that gave the owl such a wise look that they shouted\r\nwith merriment. The performance closed with making the bird angry, and\r\nseeing him cling to a handkerchief upside down, pecking and \xe2\x80\x9cclucking,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as Rob called it. He was allowed to fly after that, and settled himself\r\non the bunch of pine-cones over the door, where he sat staring down at\r\nthe company with an air of sleepy dignity that amused them very much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you anything for us, George?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer, when the room was\r\nstill again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I read and learned ever so much about moles, but I declare I've\r\nforgotten every bit of it, except that they dig holes to live in, that\r\nyou catch them by pouring water down, and that they can't possibly live\r\nwithout eating very often;\xe2\x80\x9d and Stuffy sat down, wishing he had not been\r\ntoo lazy to write out his valuable observations, for a general smile\r\nwent round when he mentioned the last of the three facts which lingered\r\nin his memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we are done for to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Bhaer, but Tommy called out in\r\na great hurry,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo we ain't. Don't you know? We must give the thing;\xe2\x80\x9d and he winked\r\nviolently as he made an eye-glass of his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my heart, I forgot! Now is your time, Tom;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer dropped\r\ninto his seat again, while all the boys but Dan looked mightily tickled\r\nat something.\r\n\r\nNat, Tommy, and Demi left the room, and speedily returned with a little\r\nred morocco box set forth in state on Mrs. Jo's best silver salver.\r\nTommy bore it, and, still escorted by Nat and Demi, marched up to\r\nunsuspecting Dan, who stared at them as if he thought they were going to\r\nmake fun of him. Tommy had prepared an elegant and impressive speech for\r\nthe occasion, but when the minute came, it all went out of his head, and\r\nhe just said, straight from his kindly boyish heart,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, old fellow, we all wanted to give you something to kind of pay\r\nfor what happened awhile ago, and to show how much we liked you for\r\nbeing such a trump. Please take it, and have a jolly good time with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan was so surprised he could only get as red as the little box, and\r\nmutter, \xe2\x80\x9cThanky, boys!\xe2\x80\x9d as he fumbled to open it. But when he saw\r\nwhat was inside, his face lighted up, and he seized the long desired\r\ntreasure, saying so enthusiastically that every one was satisfied,\r\nthough is language was anything but polished,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a stunner! I say, you fellows are regular bricks to give me this;\r\nit's just what I wanted. Give us your paw, Tommy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany paws were given, and heartily shaken, for the boys were charmed\r\nwith Dan's pleasure, and crowded round him to shake hands and expatiate\r\non the beauties of their gift. In the midst of this pleasant chatter,\r\nDan's eye went to Mrs. Jo, who stood outside the group enjoying the\r\nscene with all her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I had nothing to do with it. The boys got it up all themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, answering the grateful look that seemed to thank her for\r\nthat happy moment. Dan smiled, and said, in a tone that only she could\r\nunderstand,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's you all the same;\xe2\x80\x9d and making his way through the boys, he held\r\nout his hand first to her and then to the good Professor, who was\r\nbeaming benevolently on his flock.\r\n\r\nHe thanked them both with the silent, hearty squeeze he gave the kind\r\nhands that had held him up, and led him into the safe refuge of a happy\r\nhome. Not a word was spoken, but they felt all he would say, and little\r\nTeddy expressed his pleasure for them as he leaned from his father's arm\r\nto hug the boy, and say, in his baby way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dood Danny! everybody loves him now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, show off your spy-glass, Dan, and let us see some of your\r\nmagnified pollywogs and annymalcumisms as you call 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack, who\r\nfelt so uncomfortable during this scene that he would have slipped away\r\nif Emil had not kept him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I will, take a squint at that and see what you think of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDan, glad to show off his precious microscope.\r\n\r\nHe held it over a beetle that happened to be lying on the table, and\r\nJack bent down to take his squint, but looked up with an amazed face,\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy eye! what nippers the old thing has got! I see now why it hurts so\r\nconfoundedly when you grab a dorbug and he grabs back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe winked at me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, who had poked her head under Jack's elbow\r\nand got the second peep.\r\n\r\nEvery one took a look, and then Dan showed them the lovely plumage on a\r\nmoth's wing, the four feathery corners to a hair, the veins on a leaf,\r\nhardly visible to the naked eye, but like a thick net through the\r\nwonderful little glass; the skin on their own fingers, looking like\r\nqueer hills and valleys; a cobweb like a bit of coarse sewing silk, and\r\nthe sting of a bee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's like the fairy spectacles in my story-book, only more curious,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Demi, enchanted with the wonders he saw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan is a magician now, and he can show you many miracles going on all\r\nround you; for he has two things needful patience and a love of nature.\r\nWe live in a beautiful and wonderful world, Demi, and the more you know\r\nabout it the wiser and the better you will be. This little glass will\r\ngive you a new set of teachers, and you may learn fine lessons from them\r\nif you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, glad to see how interested the boys were\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I see anybody's soul with this microscope if I looked hard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked Demi, who was much impressed with the power of the bit of glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear; it's not powerful enough for that, and never can be made so.\r\nYou must wait a long while before your eyes are clear enough to see the\r\nmost invisible of God's wonders. But looking at the lovely things you\r\ncan see will help you to understand the lovelier things you can not\r\nsee,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Uncle Fritz, with his hand on the boy's head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Daisy and I both think that if there are any angels, their wings\r\nlook like that butterfly's as we see it through the glass, only more\r\nsoft and gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it if you like, and keep your own little wings as bright and\r\nbeautiful, only don't fly away for a long time yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won't,\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi kept his word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my boys; I must go now, but I leave you with our new Professor\r\nof Natural History;\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo went away well pleased with that\r\ncomposition day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. CROPS\r\n\r\nThe gardens did well that summer, and in September the little crops were\r\ngathered in with much rejoicing. Jack and Ned joined their farms and\r\nraised potatoes, those being a good salable article. They got twelve\r\nbushels, counting little ones and all, and sold them to Mr. Bhaer at a\r\nfair price, for potatoes went fast in that house. Emil and Franz devoted\r\nthemselves to corn, and had a jolly little husking in the barn, after\r\nwhich they took their corn to the mill, and came proudly home with meal\r\nenough to supply the family with hasty-pudding and Johnny-cake for a\r\nlone time. They would not take money for their crop; because, as Franz\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWe never can pay Uncle for all he has done for us if we raised\r\ncorn for the rest of our days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat had beans in such abundance that he despaired of ever shelling them,\r\ntill Mrs. Jo proposed a new way, which succeeded admirably. The dry\r\npods were spread upon the barn-floor, Nat fiddled, and the boys danced\r\nquadrilles on them, till they were thrashed out with much merriment and\r\nvery little labor.\r\n\r\nTommy's six weeks' beans were a failure; for a dry spell early in the\r\nseason hurt them, because he gave them no water; and after that he was\r\nso sure that they could take care of themselves, he let the poor\r\nthings struggle with bugs and weeds till they were exhausted and died\r\na lingering death. So Tommy had to dig his farm over again, and plant\r\npeas. But they were late; the birds ate many; the bushes, not being\r\nfirmly planted, blew down, and when the poor peas came at last, no one\r\ncared for them, as their day was over, and spring-lamb had grown\r\ninto mutton. Tommy consoled himself with a charitable effort; for he\r\ntransplanted all the thistles he could find, and tended them carefully\r\nfor Toby, who was fond of the prickly delicacy, and had eaten all he\r\ncould find on the place. The boys had great fun over Tom's thistle\r\nbed; but he insisted that it was better to care for poor Toby than for\r\nhimself, and declared that he would devote his entire farm next year to\r\nthistles, worms, and snails, that Demi's turtles and Nat's pet owl might\r\nhave the food they loved, as well as the donkey. So like shiftless,\r\nkind-hearted, happy-go-lucky Tommy!\r\n\r\nDemi had supplied his grandmother with lettuce all summer, and in the\r\nautumn sent his grandfather a basket of turnips, each one scrubbed up\r\ntill it looked like a great white egg. His Grandma was fond of salad,\r\nand one of his Grandpa's favorite quotations was,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLucullus, whom frugality could charm,\r\n     Ate roasted turnips at the Sabine farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTherefore these vegetable offerings to the dear domestic god and goddess\r\nwere affectionate, appropriate, and classical.\r\n\r\nDaisy had nothing but flowers in her little plot, and it bloomed all\r\nsummer long with a succession of gay or fragrant posies. She was very\r\nfond of her garden, and delved away in it at all hours, watching over\r\nher roses, and pansies, sweet-peas, and mignonette, as faithfully and\r\ntenderly as she did over her dolls or her friends. Little nosegays were\r\nsent into town on all occasions, and certain vases about the house\r\nwere her especial care. She had all sorts of pretty fancies about her\r\nflowers, and loved to tell the children the story of the pansy, and show\r\nthem how the step-mother-leaf sat up in her green chair in purple and\r\ngold; how the two own children in gay yellow had each its little seat,\r\nwhile the step children, in dull colors, both sat on one small stool,\r\nand the poor little father in his red nightcap, was kept out of sight\r\nin the middle of the flower; that a monk's dark face looked out of the\r\nmonk's-hood larkspur; that the flowers of the canary-vine were so like\r\ndainty birds fluttering their yellow wings, that one almost expected\r\nto see them fly away, and the snapdragons that went off like little\r\npistol-shots when you cracked them. Splendid dollies did she make out of\r\nscarlet and white poppies, with ruffled robes tied round the waist with\r\ngrass blade sashes, and astonishing hats of coreopsis on their\r\ngreen heads. Pea-pod boats, with rose-leaf sails, received these\r\nflower-people, and floated them about a placid pool in the most charming\r\nstyle; for finding that there were no elves, Daisy made her own,\r\nand loved the fanciful little friends who played their parts in her\r\nsummer-life.\r\n\r\nNan went in for herbs, and had a fine display of useful plants, which\r\nshe tended with steadily increasing interest and care. Very busy was\r\nshe in September cutting, drying, and tying up her sweet harvest, and\r\nwriting down in a little book how the different herbs are to be used.\r\nShe had tried several experiments, and made several mistakes; so she\r\nwished to be particular lest she should give little Huz another fit by\r\nadministering wormwood instead of catnip.\r\n\r\nDick, Dolly, and Rob each grubbed away on his small farm, and made more\r\nstir about it than all the rest put together. Parsnips and carrots were\r\nthe crops of the two D.'s; and they longed for it to be late enough to\r\npull up the precious vegetables. Dick did privately examine his carrots,\r\nand plant them again, feeling that Silas was right in saying it was too\r\nsoon for them yet.\r\n\r\nRob's crop was four small squashes and one immense pumpkin. It really\r\nwas a \xe2\x80\x9cbouncer,\xe2\x80\x9d as every one said; and I assure you that two small\r\npersons could sit on it side by side. It seemed to have absorbed all the\r\ngoodness of the little garden, and all the sunshine that shone down on\r\nit, and lay there a great round, golden ball, full of rich suggestions\r\nof pumpkin-pies for weeks to come. Robby was so proud of his mammoth\r\nvegetable that he took every one to see it, and, when frosts began to\r\nnip, covered it up each night with an old bedquilt, tucking it round as\r\nif the pumpkin was a well-beloved baby. The day it was gathered he would\r\nlet no one touch it but himself, and nearly broke his back tugging it\r\nto the barn in his little wheelbarrow, with Dick and Dolly harnessed\r\nin front to give a heave up the path. His mother promised him that the\r\nThanksgiving-pies should be made from it, and hinted vaguely that she\r\nhad a plan in her head which would cover the prize pumpkin and its owner\r\nwith glory.\r\n\r\nPoor Billy had planted cucumbers, but unfortunately hoed them up and\r\nleft the pig-weed. This mistake grieved him very much for tem minutes,\r\nthen he forgot all about it, and sowed a handful of bright buttons which\r\nhe had collected, evidently thinking in his feeble mind that they\r\nwere money, and would come up and multiply, so that he might make many\r\nquarters, as Tommy did. No one disturbed him, and he did what he liked\r\nwith his plot, which soon looked as if a series of small earthquakes\r\nhad stirred it up. When the general harvest-day came, he would have\r\nhad nothing but stones and weeds to show, if kind old Asia had not hung\r\nhalf-a-dozen oranges on the dead tree he stuck up in the middle. Billy\r\nwas delighted with his crop; and no one spoiled his pleasure in the\r\nlittle miracle which pity wrought for him, by making withered branches\r\nbear strange fruit.\r\n\r\nStuffy had various trials with his melons; for, being impatient to taste\r\nthem, he had a solitary revel before they were ripe, and made himself so\r\nill, that for a day or two it seemed doubtful if he would ever eat\r\nany more. But he pulled through it, and served up his first cantaloupe\r\nwithout tasting a mouthful himself. They were excellent melons, for he\r\nhad a warm slope for them, and they ripened fast. The last and best were\r\nlingering on the vines, and Stuffy had announced that he should sell\r\nthem to a neighbor. This disappointed the boys, who had hoped to eat\r\nthe melons themselves, and they expressed their displeasure in a new\r\nand striking manner. Going one morning to gaze upon the three fine\r\nwatermelons which he had kept for the market, Stuffy was horrified to\r\nfind the word \xe2\x80\x9cPIG\xe2\x80\x9d cut in white letters on the green rind, staring\r\nat him from every one. He was in a great rage, and flew to Mrs. Jo for\r\nredress. She listened, condoled with him, and then said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to turn the laugh, I'll tell you how, but you must give up\r\nthe melons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will; for I can't thrash all the boys, but I'd like to give\r\nthem something to remember, the mean sneaks,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Stuff, still in a\r\nfume.\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Jo was pretty sure who had done the trick, for she had seen\r\nthree heads suspiciously near to one another in the sofa-corner the\r\nevening before; and when these heads had nodded with chuckles and\r\nwhispers, this experienced woman knew mischief was afoot. A moonlight\r\nnight, a rustling in the old cherry-tree near Emil's window, a cut on\r\nTommy's finger, all helped to confirm her suspicions; and having cooled\r\nStuffy's wrath a little, she bade him bring his maltreated melons to her\r\nroom, and say not a word to any one of what had happened. He did so,\r\nand the three wags were amazed to find their joke so quietly taken. It\r\nspoilt the fun, and the entire disappearance of the melons made them\r\nuneasy. So did Stuffy's good-nature, for he looked more placid and plump\r\nthan ever, and surveyed them with an air of calm pity that perplexed\r\nthem very much.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time they discovered why; for then Stuffy's vengeance fell\r\nupon them, and the laugh was turned against them. When the pudding was\r\neaten, and the fruit was put on, Mary Ann re-appeared in a high state of\r\ngiggle, bearing a large watermelon; Silas followed with another; and\r\nDan brought up the rear with a third. One was placed before each of the\r\nthree guilty lads; and they read on the smooth green skins this addition\r\nto their own work, \xe2\x80\x9cWith the compliments of the PIG.\xe2\x80\x9d Every one else\r\nread it also, and the whole table was in a roar, for the trick had been\r\nwhispered about; so every one understood the sequel. Emil, Ned,\r\nand Tommy did not know where to look, and had not a word to say for\r\nthemselves; so they wisely joined in the laugh, cut up the melons, and\r\nhanded them round, saying, what all the rest agreed to, that Stuffy had\r\ntaken a wise and merry way to return good for evil.\r\n\r\nDan had no garden, for he was away or lame the greater part of the\r\nsummer; so he had helped Silas wherever he could, chopped wood for Asia,\r\nand taken care of the lawn so well, that Mrs. Jo always had smooth paths\r\nand nicely shaven turf before her door.\r\n\r\nWhen the others got in their crops, he looked sorry that he had so\r\nlittle to show; but as autumn went on, he bethought himself of a\r\nwoodland harvest which no one would dispute with him, and which was\r\npeculiarly his own. Every Saturday he was away alone to the forests,\r\nfields, and hills, and always came back loaded with spoils; for he\r\nseemed to know the meadows where the best flag-root grew, the thicket\r\nwhere the sassafras was spiciest, the haunts where the squirrels went\r\nfor nuts, the white oak whose bark was most valuable, and the little\r\ngold-thread vine that Nursey liked to cure the canker with. All sorts of\r\nsplendid red and yellow leaves did Dan bring home for Mrs. Jo to dress\r\nher parlor with, graceful-seeded grasses, clematis tassels, downy, soft,\r\nyellow wax-work berries, and mosses, red-brimmed, white, or emerald\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI need not sigh for the woods now, because Dan brings the woods to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Mrs. Jo used to say, as she glorified the walls with yellow maple boughs\r\nand scarlet woodbine wreaths, or filled her vases with russet ferns,\r\nhemlock sprays full of delicate cones, and hardy autumn flowers; for\r\nDan's crop suited her well.\r\n\r\nThe great garret was full of the children's little stores and for a time\r\nwas one of the sights of the house. Daisy's flower seeds in neat little\r\npaper bags, all labelled, lay in a drawer of a three-legged table.\r\nNan's herbs hung in bunches against the wall, filling the air with their\r\naromatic breath. Tommy had a basket of thistle-down with the tiny seeds\r\nattached, for he meant to plant them next year, if they did not all fly\r\naway before that time. Emil had bunches of pop-corn hanging there to\r\ndry, and Demi laid up acorns and different sorts of grain for the pets.\r\nBut Dan's crop made the best show, for fully one half of the floor was\r\ncovered with the nuts he brought. All kinds were there, for he ranged\r\nthe woods for miles round, climbed the tallest trees, and forced his way\r\ninto the thickest hedges for his plunder. Walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts,\r\nand beechnuts lay in separate compartments, getting brown, and dry, and\r\nsweet, ready for winter revels.\r\n\r\nThere was one butternut-tree on the place, and Rob and Teddy called it\r\ntheirs. It bore well this year, and the great dingy nuts came dropping\r\ndown to hide among the dead leaves, where the busy squirrels found them\r\nbetter than the lazy Bhaers. Their father had told them (the boys, not\r\nthe squirrels) they should have the nuts if they would pick them up, but\r\nno one was to help. It was easy work, and Teddy liked it, only he soon\r\ngot tired, and left his little basket half full for another day. But the\r\nother day was slow to arrive, and, meantime, the sly squirrels were hard\r\nat work, scampering up and down the old elm-trees stowing the nuts away\r\ntill their holes were full, then all about the crotches of the boughs,\r\nto be removed at their leisure. Their funny little ways amused the boys,\r\ntill one day Silas said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHev you sold them nuts to the squirrels?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob, wondering what Silas meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, then, you'd better fly round, or them spry little fellers won't\r\nleave you none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we can beat them when we begin. There are such lots of nuts we\r\nshall have a plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain't many more to come down, and they have cleared the ground\r\npretty well, see if they hain't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobby ran to look, and was alarmed to find how few remained. He called\r\nTeddy, and they worked hard all one afternoon, while the squirrels sat\r\non the fence and scolded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Ted, we must keep watch, and pick up just as fast as they fall, or\r\nwe shan't have more than a bushel, and every one will laugh at us if we\r\ndon't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe naughty quillies tarn't have 'em. I'll pick fast and run and put\r\n'em in the barn twick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teddy, frowning at little Frisky, who\r\nchattered and whisked his tail indignantly.\r\n\r\nThat night a high wind blew down hundreds of nuts, and when Mrs. Jo came\r\nto wake her little sons, she said, briskly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my laddies, the squirrels are hard at it, and you will have to\r\nwork well to-day, or they will have every nut on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they won't,\xe2\x80\x9d and Robby tumbled up in a great hurry, gobbled his\r\nbreakfast, and rushed out to save his property.\r\n\r\nTeddy went too, and worked like a little beaver, trotting to and fro\r\nwith full and empty baskets. Another bushel was soon put away in the\r\ncorn-barn, and they were scrambling among the leaves for more nuts when\r\nthe bell rang for school.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO father! let me stay out and pick. Those horrid squirrels will have\r\nmy nuts if you don't. I'll do my lessons by and by,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, running\r\ninto the school-room, flushed and tousled by the fresh cold wind and his\r\neager work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had been up early and done a little every morning there would be\r\nno hurry now. I told you that, Rob, and you never minded. I cannot have\r\nthe lessons neglected as the work has been. The squirrels will get more\r\nthan their share this year, and they deserve it, for they have worked\r\nbest. You may go an hour earlier, but that is all,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer led\r\nRob to his place where the little man dashed at his books as if bent on\r\nmaking sure of the precious hour promised him.\r\n\r\nIt was almost maddening to sit still and see the wind shaking down the\r\nlast nuts, and the lively thieves flying about, pausing now and then to\r\neat one in his face, and flirt their tails, as if they said, saucily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll have them in spite of you, lazy Rob.\xe2\x80\x9d The only thing that\r\nsustained the poor child in this trying moment was the sight of\r\nTeddy working away all alone. It was really splendid the pluck and\r\nperseverance of the little lad. He picked and picked till his back\r\nached; he trudged to and fro till his small legs were tired; and he\r\ndefied wind, weariness, and wicked \xe2\x80\x9cquillies,\xe2\x80\x9d till his mother left\r\nher work and did the carrying for him, full of admiration for the kind\r\nlittle fellow who tried to help his brother. When Rob was dismissed, he\r\nfound Teddy reposing in the bushel-basket quite used up, but unwilling\r\nto quit the field; for he flapped his hat at the thieves with one grubby\r\nlittle hand, while he refreshed himself with the big apple held in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nRob fell to work and the ground was cleared before two o'clock, the nuts\r\nsafely in the corn-barn loft, and the weary workers exulted in their\r\nsuccess. But Frisky and his wife were not to be vanquished so easily;\r\nand when Rob went up to look at his nuts a few days later he was amazed\r\nto see how many had vanished. None of the boys could have stolen them,\r\nbecause the door had been locked; the doves could not have eaten them,\r\nand there were no rats about. There was great lamentation among the\r\nyoung Bhaers till Dick said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Frisky on the roof of the corn-barn, may be he took them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he did! I'll have a trap, and kill him dead,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob,\r\ndisgusted with Frisky's grasping nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps if you watch, you can find out where he puts them, and I may\r\nbe able to get them back for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, who was much amused by the\r\nfight between the boys and squirrels.\r\n\r\nSo Rob watched and saw Mr. and Mrs. Frisky drop from the drooping elm\r\nboughs on to the roof of the corn-barn, dodge in at one of the little\r\ndoors, much to the disturbance of the doves, and come out with a nut in\r\neach mouth. So laden they could not get back the way they came, but\r\nran down the low roof, along the wall, and leaping off at a corner they\r\nvanished a minute and re-appeared without their plunder. Rob ran to the\r\nplace, and in a hollow under the leaves he found a heap of the stolen\r\nproperty hidden away to be carried off to the holes by and by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you little villains! I'll cheat you now, and not leave one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRob. So he cleared the corner and the corn-barn, and put the contested\r\nnuts in the garret, making sure that no broken window-pane could\r\nanywhere let in the unprincipled squirrels. They seemed to feel that the\r\ncontest was over, and retired to their hole, but now and then could not\r\nresist throwing down nut-shells on Rob's head, and scolding violently\r\nas if they could not forgive him nor forget that he had the best of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nFather and Mother Bhaer's crop was of a different sort, and not so\r\neasily described; but they were satisfied with it, felt that their\r\nsummer work had prospered well, and by and by had a harvest that made\r\nthem very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. JOHN BROOKE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake up, Demi, dear! I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I've just gone to bed; it can't be morning yet;\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi blinked\r\nlike a little owl as he waked from his first sound sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's only ten, but your father is ill, and we must go to him. O my\r\nlittle John! my poor little John!\xe2\x80\x9d and Aunt Jo laid her head down on\r\nthe pillow with a sob that scared sleep from Demi's eyes and filled his\r\nheart with fear and wonder; for he dimly felt why Aunt Jo called him\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn,\xe2\x80\x9d and wept over him as if some loss had come that left him poor.\r\nHe clung to her without a word, and in a minute she was quite steady\r\nagain, and said, with a tender kiss as she saw his troubled face,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to say good-by to him, my darling, and there is no time to\r\nlose; so dress quickly and come to me in my room. I must go to Daisy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and when Aunt Jo was gone, little Demi got up quietly,\r\ndressed as if in a dream, and leaving Tommy fast asleep went away\r\nthrough the silent house, feeling that something new and sorrowful was\r\ngoing to happen something that set him apart from the other boys for\r\na time, and made the world seem as dark and still and strange as those\r\nfamiliar rooms did in the night. A carriage sent by Mr. Laurie stood\r\nbefore the door. Daisy was soon ready, and the brother and sister held\r\neach other by the hand all the way into town, as they drove swiftly and\r\nsilently with aunt and uncle through the shadowy roads to say good-by to\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nNone of the boys but Franz and Emil knew what had happened, and when\r\nthey came down next morning, great was their wonderment and discomfort,\r\nfor the house seemed forlorn without its master and mistress. Breakfast\r\nwas a dismal meal with no cheery Mrs. Jo behind the teapots; and when\r\nschool-time came, Father Bhaer's place was empty. They wandered about in\r\na disconsolate kind of way for an hour, waiting for news and hoping it\r\nwould be all right with Demi's father, for good John Brooke was much\r\nbeloved by the boys. Ten o'clock came, and no one arrived to relieve\r\ntheir anxiety. They did not feel like playing, yet the time dragged\r\nheavily, and they sat about listless and sober. All at once, Franz got\r\nup, and said, in his persuasive way,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, boys! let's go into school and do our lessons just as if\r\nUncle was here. It will make the day go faster, and will please him, I\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who will hear us say them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will; I don't know much more than you do, but I'm the oldest here,\r\nand I'll try to fill Uncle's place till he comes, if you don't mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething in the modest, serious way Franz said this impressed the boys,\r\nfor, though the poor lad's eyes were red with quiet crying for Uncle\r\nJohn in that long sad night, there was a new manliness about him, as if\r\nhe had already begun to feel the cares and troubles of life, and tried\r\nto take them bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, for one,\xe2\x80\x9d and Emil went to his seat, remembering that obedience\r\nto his superior officer is a seaman's first duty.\r\n\r\nThe others followed; Franz took his uncle's seat, and for an hour\r\norder reigned. Lessons were learned and said, and Franz made a patient,\r\npleasant teacher, wisely omitting such lessons as he was not equal to,\r\nand keeping order more by the unconscious dignity that sorrow gave him\r\nthan by any words of his own. The little boys were reading when a step\r\nwas heard in the hall, and every one looked up to read the news in Mr.\r\nBhaer's face as he came in. The kind face told them instantly that Demi\r\nhad no father now, for it was worn and pale, and full of tender grief,\r\nwhich left him no words with which to answer Rob, as he ran to him,\r\nsaying, reproachfully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you go and leave me in the night, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe memory of the other father who had left his children in the night,\r\nnever to return, made Mr. Bhaer hold his own boy close, and, for a\r\nminute, hide his face in Robby's curly hair. Emil laid his head down\r\non his arms, Franz, went to put his hand on his uncle's shoulder, his\r\nboyish face pale with sympathy and sorrow, and the others sat so still\r\nthat the soft rustle of the falling leaves outside was distinctly heard.\r\n\r\nRob did not clearly understand what had happened, but he hated to see\r\npapa unhappy, so he lifted up the bent head, and said, in his chirpy\r\nlittle voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't cry, mein Vater! we were all so good, we did our lessons, without\r\nyou, and Franz was the master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer looked up then, tried to smile, and said in a grateful tone\r\nthat made the lads feel like saints, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you very much, my boys.\r\nIt was a beautiful way to help and comfort me. I shall not forget it, I\r\nassure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFranz proposed it, and was a first-rate master, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat; and the\r\nothers gave a murmur of assent most gratifying to the young dominie.\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer put Rob down, and, standing up, put his arm round his tall\r\nnephew's shoulder, as he said, with a look of genuine pleasure,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis makes my hard day easier, and gives me confidence in you all. I\r\nam needed there in town, and must leave you for some hours. I thought\r\nto give you a holiday, or send some of you home, but if you like to stay\r\nand go on as you have begun, I shall be glad and proud of my good boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll stay;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe'd rather;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFranz can see to us;\xe2\x80\x9d cried several,\r\ndelighted with the confidence shown in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't Marmar coming home?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, wistfully; for home without\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarmar\xe2\x80\x9d was the world without the sun to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall both come to-night; but dear Aunt Meg needs Mother more than\r\nyou do now, and I know you like to lend her for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will; but Teddy's been crying for her, and he slapped Nursey,\r\nand was dreadful naughty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Rob, as if the news might bring\r\nmother home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my little man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bhaer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan took him out, to keep him quiet. He's all right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franz,\r\npointing to the window, through which they could see Dan drawing baby in\r\nhis little wagon, with the dogs frolicking about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't see him, it would only upset him again; but tell Dan I leave\r\nTeddy in his care. You older boys I trust to manage yourselves for a\r\nday. Franz will direct you, and Silas is here to over see matters. So\r\ngood-by till to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust tell me a word about Uncle John,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, detaining Mr. Bhaer,\r\nas he was about hurrying away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was only ill a few hours, and died as he has lived, so cheerfully,\r\nso peacefully, that it seems a sin to mar the beauty of it with any\r\nviolent or selfish grief. We were in time to say good-by: and Daisy and\r\nDemi were in his arms as he fell asleep on Aunt Meg's breast. No more\r\nnow, I cannot bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer went hastily away quite bowed with\r\ngrief, for in John Brooke he had lost both friend and brother, and there\r\nwas no one left to take his place.\r\n\r\nAll that day the house was very still; the small boys played quietly in\r\nthe nursery; the others, feeling as if Sunday had come in the middle\r\nof the week, spent it in walking, sitting in the willow, or among their\r\npets, all talking much of \xe2\x80\x9cUncle John,\xe2\x80\x9d and feeling that something\r\ngentle, just, and strong, had gone out of their little world, leaving a\r\nsense of loss that deepened every hour. At dusk, Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer came\r\nhome alone, for Demi and Daisy were their mother's best comfort now,\r\nand could not leave her. Poor Mrs. Jo seemed quite spent, and evidently\r\nneeded the same sort of comfort, for her first words, as she came up the\r\nstairs, were, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is my baby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered a little voice, as Dan put Teddy into her arms,\r\nadding, as she hugged him close, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Danny tooked tare of me all day,\r\nand I was dood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jo turned to thank the faithful nurse, but Dan was waving off the\r\nboys, who had gathered in the hall to meet her, and was saying, in a low\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep back; she don't want to be bothered with us now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don't keep back. I want you all. Come in and see me, my boys. I've\r\nneglected you all day,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo held out her hands to them as they\r\ngathered round and escorted her into her own room, saying little, but\r\nexpressing much by affectionate looks and clumsy little efforts to show\r\ntheir sorrow and sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so tired, I will lie here and cuddle Teddy, and you shall bring me\r\nin some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, trying to speak cheerfully for their sakes.\r\n\r\nA general stampede into the dining-room followed, and the supper-table\r\nwould have been ravaged if Mr. Bhaer had not interfered. It was agreed\r\nthat one squad should carry in the mother's tea, and another bring it\r\nout. The four nearest and dearest claimed the first honor, so Franz bore\r\nthe teapot, Emil the bread, Rob the milk, and Teddy insisted on carrying\r\nthe sugar basin, which was lighter by several lumps when it arrived than\r\nwhen it started. Some women might have found it annoying at such a time\r\nto have boys creaking in and out, upsetting cups and rattling spoons in\r\nviolent efforts to be quiet and helpful; but it suited Mrs. Jo, because\r\njust then her heart was very tender; and remembering that many of her\r\nboys were fatherless or motherless, she yearned over them, and found\r\ncomfort in their blundering affection. It was the sort of food that did\r\nher more good than the very thick bread-and-butter that they gave her,\r\nand the rough Commodore's broken whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear up, Aunty, it's a hard blow; but we'll weather it somehow;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cheered her more than the sloppy cup he brought her, full of tea as\r\nbitter as if some salt tear of his own had dropped into it on the way.\r\nWhen supper was over, a second deputation removed the tray; and Dan\r\nsaid, holding out his arms for sleepy little Teddy,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me put him to bed, you're so tired, Mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with him, lovey?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Jo of her small lord and\r\nmaster, who lay on her arm among the sofa-pillows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTorse I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and he was proudly carried off by his faithful bearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, with a sigh, as Franz leaned\r\nover the sofa, and softly stroked Aunt Jo's hot forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can, dear. Go and get your violin, and play me the sweet little\r\nairs Uncle Teddy sent you last. Music will comfort me better than any\r\nthing else to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat flew for his fiddle, and, sitting just outside her door, played as\r\nhe had never done before, for now his heart was in it, and seemed\r\nto magnetize his fingers. The other lads sat quietly upon the steps,\r\nkeeping watch that no new-comer should disturb the house; Franz lingered\r\nat his post; and so, soothed, served, and guarded by her boys, poor Mrs.\r\nJo slept at last, and forgot her sorrow for an hour.\r\n\r\nTwo quiet days, and on the third Mr. Bhaer came in just after school,\r\nwith a note in his hand, looking both moved and pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to read you something, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; and as they stood round\r\nhim he read this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR BROTHER FRITZ, I hear that you do not mean to bring your flock\r\ntoday, thinking that I may not like it. Please do. The sight of his\r\nfriends will help Demi through the hard hour, and I want the boys to\r\nhear what father says of my John. It will do them good, I know. If they\r\nwould sing one of the sweet old hymns you have taught them so well,\r\nI should like it better than any other music, and feel that it was\r\nbeautifully suited to the occasion. Please ask them, with my love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMEG.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go?\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer looked at the lads, who were greatly\r\ntouched by Mrs. Brooke's kind words and wishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d they answered, like one boy; and an hour later they went away\r\nwith Franz to bear their part in John Brooke's simple funeral.\r\n\r\nThe little house looked as quiet, sunny, and home-like as when Meg\r\nentered it as a bride, ten years ago, only then it was early summer,\r\nand rose blossomed everywhere; now it was early autumn, and dead leaves\r\nrustled softly down, leaving the branches bare. The bride was a widow\r\nnow; but the same beautiful serenity shone in her face, and the sweet\r\nresignation of a truly pious soul made her presence a consolation to\r\nthose who came to comfort her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Meg! how can you bear it so?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Jo, as she met them at the\r\ndoor with a smile of welcome, and no change in her gentle manner, except\r\nmore gentleness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Jo, the love that has blest me for ten happy years supports me\r\nstill. It could not die, and John is more my own than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nMeg; and in her eyes the tender trust was so beautiful and bright, that\r\nJo believed her, and thanked God for the immortality of love like hers.\r\n\r\nThey were all there father and mother, Uncle Teddy, and Aunt Amy, old\r\nMr. Laurence, white-haired and feeble now, Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer, with\r\ntheir flock, and many friends, come to do honor to the dead. One would\r\nhave said that modest John Brooke, in his busy, quiet, humble life,\r\nhad had little time to make friends; but now they seemed to start\r\nup everywhere, old and young, rich and poor, high and low; for all\r\nunconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt, his virtues\r\nwere remembered, and his hidden charities rose up to bless him. The\r\ngroup about his coffin was a far more eloquent eulogy than any Mr. March\r\ncould utter. There were the rich men whom he had served faithfully for\r\nyears; the poor old women whom he cherished with his little store, in\r\nmemory of his mother; the wife to whom he had given such happiness that\r\ndeath could not mar it utterly; the brothers and sisters in whose hearts\r\nhe had made a place for ever; the little son and daughter, who already\r\nfelt the loss of his strong arm and tender voice; the young children,\r\nsobbing for their kindest playmate, and the tall lads, watching with\r\nsoftened faces a scene which they never could forget. A very simple\r\nservice, and very short; for the fatherly voice that had faltered in the\r\nmarriage-sacrament now failed entirely as Mr. March endeavored to pay\r\nhis tribute of reverence and love to the son whom he most honored.\r\nNothing but the soft coo of Baby Josy's voice up-stairs broke the long\r\nhush that followed the last Amen, till, at a sign from Mr. Bhaer, the\r\nwell-trained boyish voices broke out in a hymn, so full of lofty cheer,\r\nthat one by one all joined in it, singing with full hearts, and finding\r\ntheir troubled spirits lifted into peace on the wings of that brave,\r\nsweet psalm.\r\n\r\nAs Meg listened, she felt that she had done well; for not only did the\r\nmoment comfort her with the assurance that John's last lullaby was sung\r\nby the young voices he loved so well, but in the faces of the boys she\r\nsaw that they had caught a glimpse of the beauty of virtue in its most\r\nimpressive form, and that the memory of the good man lying dead before\r\nthem would live long and helpfully in their remembrance. Daisy's head\r\nlay in her lap, and Demi held her hand, looking often at her, with eyes\r\nso like his father's, and a little gesture that seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't\r\nbe troubled, mother; I am here;\xe2\x80\x9d and all about her were friends to lean\r\nupon and love; so patient, pious Meg put by her heavy grief, feeling\r\nthat her best help would be to live for others, as her John had done.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as the Plumfield boys sat on the steps, as usual, in the\r\nmild September moonlight, they naturally fell to talking of the event of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nEmil began by breaking out, in his impetuous way, \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Fritz is the\r\nwisest, and Uncle Laurie the jolliest, but Uncle John was the best; and\r\nI'd rather be like him than any man I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I. Did you hear what those gentlemen said to Grandpa to-day? I\r\nwould like to have that said of me when I was dead;\xe2\x80\x9d and Franz felt with\r\nregret that he had not appreciated Uncle John enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did they say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jack, who had been much impressed by the\r\nscenes of the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, one of the partners of Mr. Laurence, where Uncle John has been\r\never so long, was saying that he was conscientious almost to a fault as\r\na business man, and above reproach in all things. Another gentleman said\r\nno money could repay the fidelity and honesty with which Uncle John had\r\nserved him, and then Grandpa told them the best of all. Uncle John once\r\nhad a place in the office of a man who cheated, and when this man wanted\r\nuncle to help him do it, uncle wouldn't, though he was offered a big\r\nsalary. The man was angry and said, 'You will never get on in business\r\nwith such strict principles;' and uncle answered back, 'I never will try\r\nto get on without them,' and left the place for a much harder and poorer\r\none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d cried several of the boys warmly, for they were in the mood to\r\nunderstand and value the little story as never before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wasn't rich, was he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never did any thing to make a stir in the world, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was only good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's all;\xe2\x80\x9d and Franz found himself wishing that Uncle John had done\r\nsomething to boast of, for it was evident that Jack was disappointed by\r\nhis replies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly good. That is all and every thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bhaer, who had\r\noverheard the last few words, and guessed what was going on the minds of\r\nthe lads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you a little about John Brooke, and you will see why men\r\nhonor him, and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or\r\nfamous. He simply did his duty in all things, and did it so cheerfully,\r\nso faithfully, that it kept him patient and brave, and happy through\r\npoverty and loneliness and years of hard work. He was a good son, and\r\ngave up his own plans to stay and live with his mother while she needed\r\nhim. He was a good friend, and taught Laurie much beside his Greek and\r\nLatin, did it unconsciously, perhaps, by showing him an example of an\r\nupright man. He was a faithful servant, and made himself so valuable to\r\nthose who employed him that they will find it hard to fill his place.\r\nHe was a good husband and father, so tender, wise, and thoughtful, that\r\nLaurie and I learned much of him, and only knew how well he loved his\r\nfamily, when we discovered all he had done for them, unsuspected and\r\nunassisted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bhaer stopped a minute, and the boys sat like statues in the\r\nmoonlight until he went on again, in a subdued, but earnest voice: \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nhe lay dying, I said to him, 'Have no care for Meg and the little ones;\r\nI will see that they never want.' Then he smiled and pressed my hand,\r\nand answered, in his cheerful way, 'No need of that; I have cared for\r\nthem.' And so he had, for when we looked among his papers, all was in\r\norder, not a debt remained; and safely put away was enough to keep Meg\r\ncomfortable and independent. Then we knew why he had lived so plainly,\r\ndenied himself so many pleasures, except that of charity, and worked\r\nso hard that I fear he shortened his good life. He never asked help for\r\nhimself, though often for others, but bore his own burden and worked\r\nout his own task bravely and quietly. No one can say a word of complaint\r\nagainst him, so just and generous and kind was he; and now, when he is\r\ngone, all find so much to love and praise and honor, that I am proud to\r\nhave been his friend, and would rather leave my children the legacy he\r\nleaves his than the largest fortune ever made. Yes! Simple, generous\r\ngoodness is the best capital to found the business of this life upon. It\r\nlasts when fame and money fail, and is the only riches we can take out\r\nof this world with us. Remember that, my boys; and if you want to earn\r\nrespect and confidence and love follow in the footsteps of John Brooke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Demi returned to school, after some weeks at home, he seemed to\r\nhave recovered from his loss with the blessed elasticity of childhood,\r\nand so he had in a measure; but he did not forget, for his was a nature\r\ninto which things sank deeply, to be pondered over, and absorbed into\r\nthe soil where the small virtues were growing fast. He played and\r\nstudied, worked and sang, just as before, and few suspected any change;\r\nbut there was one and Aunt Jo saw it for she watched over the boy with\r\nher whole heart, trying to fill John's place in her poor way. He seldom\r\nspoke of his loss, but Aunt Jo often heard a stifled sobbing in the\r\nlittle bed at night; and when she went to comfort him, all his cry was,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want my father! oh, I want my father!\xe2\x80\x9d for the tie between the two\r\nhad been a very tender one, and the child's heart bled when it was\r\nbroken. But time was kind to him, and slowly he came to feel that father\r\nwas not lost, only invisible for a while, and sure to be found again,\r\nwell and strong and fond as ever, even though his little son should see\r\nthe purple asters blossom on his grave many, many times before they met.\r\nTo this belief Demi held fast, and in it found both help and comfort,\r\nbecause it led him unconsciously through a tender longing for the father\r\nwhom he had seen to a childlike trust in the Father whom he had not\r\nseen. Both were in heaven, and he prayed to both, trying to be good for\r\nlove of them.\r\n\r\nThe outward change corresponded to the inward, for in those few weeks\r\nDemi seemed to have grown tall, and began to drop his childish plays,\r\nnot as if ashamed of them, as some boys do, but as if he had outgrown\r\nthem, and wanted something manlier. He took to the hated arithmetic,\r\nand held on so steadily that his uncle was charmed, though he could not\r\nunderstand the whim, until Demi said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to be a bookkeeper when I grow up, like papa, and I must\r\nknow about figures and things, else I can't have nice, neat ledgers like\r\nhis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt another time he came to his aunt with a very serious face, and said\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can a small boy do to earn money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask, my deary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father told me to take care of mother and the little girls, and I\r\nwant to, but I don't know how to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not mean now, Demi, but by and by, when you are large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I wish to begin now, if I can, because I think I ought to make some\r\nmoney to buy things for the family. I am ten, and other boys no bigger\r\nthan I earn pennies sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, suppose you rake up all the dead leaves and cover the\r\nstrawberry bed. I'll pay you a dollar for the job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aunt Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't that a great deal? I could do it in one day. You must be fair,\r\nand no pay too much, because I want to truly earn it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little John, I will be fair, and not pay a penny too much. Don't\r\nwork too hard; and when that is done I will have something else for you\r\nto do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, much touched by his desire to help, and his sense\r\nof justice, so like his scrupulous father.\r\n\r\nWhen the leaves were done, many barrowloads of chips were wheeled from\r\nthe wood to the shed, and another dollar earned. Then Demi helped\r\ncover the schoolbooks, working in the evenings under Franz's direction,\r\ntugging patiently away at each book, letting no one help, and receiving\r\nhis wages with such satisfaction that the dingy bills became quite\r\nglorified in his sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have a dollar for each of them, and I should like to take\r\nmy money to mother all myself, so she can see that I have minded my\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Demi made a duteous pilgrimage to his mother, who received his little\r\nearnings as a treasure of great worth, and would have kept it untouched,\r\nif Demi had not begged her to buy some useful thing for herself and the\r\nwomen-children, whom he felt were left to his care.\r\n\r\nThis made him very happy, and, though he often forgot his\r\nresponsibilities for a time, the desire to help was still there,\r\nstrengthening with his years. He always uttered the words \xe2\x80\x9cmy father\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with an air of gentle pride, and often said, as if he claimed a title\r\nfull of honor, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't call me Demi any more. I am John Brooke now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n So, strengthened by a purpose and a hope, the little lad of ten bravely\r\nbegan the world, and entered into his inheritance, the memory of a wise\r\nand tender father, the legacy of an honest name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. ROUND THE FIRE\r\n\r\nWith the October frosts came the cheery fires in the great fireplaces;\r\nand Demi's dry pine-chips helped Dan's oak-knots to blaze royally, and\r\ngo roaring up the chimney with a jolly sound. All were glad to gather\r\nround the hearth, as the evenings grew longer, to play games, read, or\r\nlay plans for the winter. But the favorite amusement was story-telling,\r\nand Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer were expected to have a store of lively tales\r\nalways on hand. Their supply occasionally gave out, and then the boys\r\nwere thrown upon their own resources, which were not always successful.\r\nGhost-parties were the rage at one time; for the fun of the thing\r\nconsisted in putting out the lights, letting the fire die down, and then\r\nsitting in the dark, and telling the most awful tales they could invent.\r\nAs this resulted in scares of all sorts among the boys, Tommy's walking\r\nin his sleep on the shed roof, and a general state of nervousness in\r\nthe little ones, it was forbidden, and they fell back on more harmless\r\namusements.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when the small boys were snugly tucked in bed, and the\r\nolder lads were lounging about the school-room fire, trying to decide\r\nwhat they should do, Demi suggested a new way of settling the question.\r\n\r\nSeizing the hearth-brush, he marched up and down the room, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cRow,\r\nrow, row;\xe2\x80\x9d and when the boys, laughing and pushing, had got into line,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I'll give you two minutes to think of a play.\xe2\x80\x9d Franz was\r\nwriting, and Emil reading the Life of Lord Nelson, and neither joined\r\nthe party, but the others thought hard, and when the time was up were\r\nready to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d and the poker softly rapped him on the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlind-man's Buff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommerce; a good round game, and have cents for the pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle forbids our playing for money. Dan, what do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's have a battle between the Greeks and Romans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuffy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoast apples, pop corn, and crack nuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried several; and when the vote was taken, Stuffy's\r\nproposal carried the day.\r\n\r\nSome went to the cellar for apples, some to the garret for nuts, and\r\nothers looked up the popper and the corn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better ask the girls to come in, hadn't we?\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, in a\r\nsudden fit of politeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaisy pricks chestnuts beautifully,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Nat, who wanted his little\r\nfriend to share the fun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNan pops corn tip-top, we must have her,\xe2\x80\x9d added Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring in your sweethearts then, we don't mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jack, who laughed\r\nat the innocent regard the little people had for one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan't call my sister a sweetheart; it is so silly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Demi, in\r\na way that made Jack laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is Nat's darling, isn't she, old chirper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if Demi don't mind. I can't help being fond of her, she is so good\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Nat, with bashful earnestness, for Jack's rough ways\r\ndisturbed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNan is my sweetheart, and I shall marry her in about a year, so don't\r\nyou get in the way, any of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, stoutly; for he and Nan\r\nhad settled their future, child-fashion, and were to live in the willow,\r\nlower down a basket for food, and do other charmingly impossible things.\r\n\r\nDemi was quenched by the decision of Bangs, who took him by the arm and\r\nwalked him off to get the ladies. Nan and Daisy were sewing with Aunt Jo\r\non certain small garments, for Mrs. Carney's newest baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, ma'am, could you lend us the girls for a little while? We'll\r\nbe very careful of them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy, winking one eye to express apples,\r\nsnapping his fingers to signify pop-corn, and gnashing his teeth to\r\nconvey the idea of nut-cracking.\r\n\r\nThe girls understood this pantomime at once, and began to pull of\r\ntheir thimbles before Mrs. Jo could decide whether Tommy was going\r\ninto convulsions or was brewing some unusual piece of mischief. Demi\r\nexplained with elaboration, permission was readily granted, and the boys\r\ndeparted with their prize.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you speak to Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Tommy, as he and Nan promenaded\r\ndown the hall to get a fork to prick the apples.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe laughs at me, so I don't wish you to have any thing to do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall, if I like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, promptly resenting this premature\r\nassumption of authority on the part of her lord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I won't have you for my sweetheart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nan, I thought you were fond of me!\xe2\x80\x9d and Tommy's voice was full of\r\ntender reproach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mind Jack's laughing I don't care for you one bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you may take back your old ring; I won't wear it any longer;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nTommy plucked off a horsehair pledge of affection which Nan had given\r\nhim in return for one made of a lobster's feeler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall give it to Ned,\xe2\x80\x9d was her cruel reply; for Ned liked Mrs.\r\nGiddy-gaddy, and had turned her clothespins, boxes, and spools enough to\r\nset up housekeeping with.\r\n\r\nTommy said, \xe2\x80\x9cThunder turtles!\xe2\x80\x9d as the only vent equal to the pent-up\r\nanguish of the moment, and, dropping Nan's arm, retired in high dudgeon,\r\nleaving her to follow with the fork, a neglect which naughty Nan\r\npunished by proceeding to prick his heart with jealousy as if it were\r\nanother sort of apple.\r\n\r\nThe hearth was swept, and the rosy Baldwins put down to roast. A shovel\r\nwas heated, and the chestnuts danced merrily upon it, while the corn\r\npopped wildly in its wire prison. Dan cracked his best walnuts, and\r\nevery one chattered and laughed, while the rain beat on the window-pane\r\nand the wind howled round the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is Billy like this nut?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Emil, who was frequently inspired\r\nwith bad conundrums.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is cracked,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's not fair; you mustn't make fun of Billy, because he can't hit\r\nback again. It's mean,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan, smashing a nut wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what family of insects does Blake belong?\xe2\x80\x9d asked peacemaker Franz,\r\nseeing that Emil looked ashamed and Dan lowering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGnats,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is Daisy like a bee?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, who had been wrapt in thought for\r\nseveral minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she is queen of the hive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she is sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBees are not sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she makes sweet things, is always busy, and likes flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Nat, piling up his boyish compliments till Daisy blushed like a\r\nrosy clover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is Nan like a hornet?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Tommy, glowering at her, and\r\nadding, without giving any one time to answer, \xe2\x80\x9cBecause she isn't sweet,\r\nmakes a great buzzing about nothing, and stings like fury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTommy's mad, and I'm glad,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ned, as Nan tossed her head and\r\nanswered quickly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat thing in the china-closet is Tom like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pepper pot,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ned, giving Nan a nut meat with a tantalizing\r\nlaugh that made Tommy feel as if he would like to bounce up like a hot\r\nchestnut and hit somebody.\r\n\r\nSeeing that ill-humor was getting the better of the small supply of wit\r\nin the company, Franz cast himself into the breach again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet's make a law that the first person who comes into the room shall\r\ntell us a story. No matter who it is, he must do it, and it will be fun\r\nto see who comes first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others agreed, and did not have to wait long, for a heavy step soon\r\ncame clumping through the hall, and Silas appeared, bearing an armful\r\nof wood. He was greeted by a general shout, and stood staring about him\r\nwith a bewildered grin on his big red face, till Franz explained the\r\njoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSho! I can't tell a story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting down his load and\r\npreparing to leave the room. But the boys fell upon him, forced him into\r\na seat, and held him there, laughing, and clamoring for their story,\r\ntill the good-natured giant was overpowered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know but jest one story, and that's about a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nmuch flattered by the reception he received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell it! tell it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal,\xe2\x80\x9d began Silas, tipping his chair back against the wall, and\r\nputting his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat, \xe2\x80\x9cI jined a cavalry\r\nregiment durin' the war, and see a consid'able amount of fightin'. My\r\nhorse, Major, was a fust-rate animal, and I was as fond on him as\r\nef he'd ben a human critter. He warn't harnsome, but he was the\r\nbest-tempered, stiddyest, lovenest brute I ever see. I fust battle we\r\nwent into, he gave me a lesson that I didn't forgit in a hurry, and\r\nI'll tell you how it was. It ain't no use tryin' to picter the noise and\r\nhurry, and general horridness of a battle to you young fellers, for I\r\nain't no words to do it in; but I'm free to confess that I got so sort\r\nof confused and upset at the fust on it, that I didn't know what I was\r\nabout. We was ordered to charge, and went ahead like good ones, never\r\nstoppin' to pick up them that went down in the scrimmage. I got a shot\r\nin the arm, and was pitched out of the saddle don't know how, but there\r\nI was left behind with two or three others, dead and wounded, for the\r\nrest went on, as I say. Wal, I picked myself up and looked round for\r\nMajor, feeling as ef I'd had about enough for that spell. I didn't see\r\nhim nowhere, and was kinder walking back to camp, when I heard a whinny\r\nthat sounded nateral. I looked round, and there was Major stopping for\r\nme a long way off, and lookin' as ef he didn't understand why I was\r\nloiterin' behind. I whistled, and he trotted up to me as I'd trained him\r\nto do. I mounted as well as I could with my left arm bleedin' and was\r\nfor going on to camp, for I declare I felt as sick and wimbly as a\r\nwoman; folks often do in their fust battle. But, no sir! Major was the\r\nbravest of the two, and he wouldn't go, not a peg; he jest rared up, and\r\ndanced, and snorted, and acted as ef the smell of powder and the noise\r\nhad drove him half wild. I done my best, but he wouldn't give in, so\r\nI did; and what do you think that plucky brute done? He wheeled slap\r\nround, and galloped back like a hurricane, right into the thickest of\r\nthe scrimmage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood for him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan excitedly, while the other boys forgot apples\r\nand nuts in their interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I may die ef I warn't ashamed of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Silas,\r\nwarming up at the recollection of that day. \xe2\x80\x9cI was mad as a hornet, and\r\nI forgot my waound, and jest pitched in, rampagin' raound like fury till\r\nthere come a shell into the midst of us, and in bustin' knocked a lot\r\nof us flat. I didn't know nothin' for a spell, and when I come-to, the\r\nfight was over just there, and I found myself layin' by a wall of poor\r\nMajor long-side wuss wounded than I was. My leg was broke, and I had a\r\nball in my shoulder, but he, poor old feller! was all tore in the side\r\nwith a piece of that blasted shell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Silas! what did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, pressing close to him with a face\r\nfull of eager sympathy and interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dragged myself nigher, and tried to stop the bleedin' with sech rags\r\nas I could tear off of me with one hand. But it warn't no use, and he\r\nlay moanin' with horrid pain, and lookin' at me with them lovin' eyes of\r\nhis, till I thought I couldn't bear it. I give him all the help I could,\r\nand when the sun got hotter and hotter, and he began to lap out his\r\ntongue, I tried to get to a brook that was a good piece away, but I\r\ncouldn't do it, being stiff and faint, so I give it up and fanned him\r\nwith my hat. Now you listen to this, and when you hear folks comin' down\r\non the rebs, you jest remember what one on 'em did, and give him credit\r\nof it. I poor feller in gray laid not fur off, shot through the lungs\r\nand dyin' fast. I'd offered him my handkerchief to keep the sun off his\r\nface, and he'd thanked me kindly, for in sech times as that men don't\r\nstop to think on which side they belong, but jest buckle-to and help one\r\nanother. When he see me mournin' over Major and tryin' to ease his pain,\r\nhe looked up with his face all damp and white with sufferin', and sez\r\nhe, 'There's water in my canteen; take it, for it can't help me,' and he\r\nflung it to me. I couldn't have took it ef I hadn't had a little brandy\r\nin a pocket flask, and I made him drink it. It done him good, and I felt\r\nas much set up as if I'd drunk it myself. It's surprisin' the good sech\r\nlittle things do folks sometime;\xe2\x80\x9d and Silas paused as if he felt again\r\nthe comfort of that moment when he and his enemy forgot their feud, and\r\nhelped one another like brothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about Major,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boys, impatient for the catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI poured the water over his poor pantin' tongue, and ef ever a dumb\r\ncritter looked grateful, he did then. But it warn't of much use, for\r\nthe dreadful waound kep on tormentin' him, till I couldn't bear it any\r\nlonger. It was hard, but I done it in mercy, and I know he forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Emil, as Silas stopped abruptly with a loud\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chem,\xe2\x80\x9d and a look in his rough face that made Daisy go and stand by him\r\nwith her little hand on his knee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shot him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite a thrill went through the listeners as Silas said that, for\r\nMajor seemed a hero in their eyes, and his tragic end roused all their\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shot him, and put him out of his misery. I patted him fust, and\r\nsaid, 'Good-by;' then I laid his head easy on the grass, give a last\r\nlook into his lovin' eyes, and sent a bullet through his head. He hardly\r\nstirred, I aimed so true, and when I seen him quite still, with no more\r\nmoanin' and pain, I was glad, and yet wal, I don't know as I need by\r\nashamed on't I jest put my arms raound his neck and boo-hooed like a\r\ngreat baby. Sho! I didn't know I was sech a fool;\xe2\x80\x9d and Silas drew his\r\nsleeve across his eyes, as much touched by Daisy's sob, as by the memory\r\nof faithful Major.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for a minute, because the boys were as quick to feel the\r\npathos of the little story as tender-hearted Daisy, though they did not\r\nshow it by crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like a horse like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, half-aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the rebel man die, too?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Nan, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot then. We laid there all day, and at night some of our fellers came\r\nto look after the missing ones. They nat'rally wanted to take me fust,\r\nbut I knew I could wait, and the rebel had but one chance, maybe, so I\r\nmade them carry him off right away. He had jest strength enough to hold\r\nout his hand to me and say, 'Thanky, comrade!' and them was the last\r\nwords he spoke, for he died an hour after he got to the hospital-tent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow glad you must have been that you were kind to him!\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who\r\nwas deeply impressed by this story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, I did take comfort thinkin' of it, as I laid there alone for a\r\nnumber of hours with my head on Major's neck, and see the moon come up.\r\nI'd like to have buried the poor beast decent, but it warn't possible;\r\nso I cut off a bit of his mane, and I've kep it ever sence. Want to see\r\nit, sissy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, please,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Daisy, wiping away her tears to look.\r\n\r\nSilas took out an old \xe2\x80\x9cwallet\xe2\x80\x9d as he called his pocket-book, and\r\nproduced from an inner fold a bit of brown paper, in which was a rough\r\nlock of white horse-hair. The children looked at it silently, as it lay\r\nin the broad palm, and no one found any thing to ridicule in the love\r\nSilas bore his good horse Major.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a sweet story, and I like it, though it did make me cry. Thank\r\nyou very much, Si,\xe2\x80\x9d and Daisy helped him fold and put away his little\r\nrelic; while Nan stuffed a handful of pop-corn into his pocket, and the\r\nboys loudly expressed their flattering opinions of his story, feeling\r\nthat there had been two heroes in it.\r\n\r\nHe departed, quite overcome by his honors, and the little conspirators\r\ntalked the tale over, while they waited for their next victim. It was\r\nMrs. Jo, who came in to measure Nan for some new pinafores she was\r\nmaking for her. They let her get well in, and then pounced upon her,\r\ntelling her the law, and demanding the story. Mrs. Jo was very much\r\namused at the new trap, and consented at once, for the sound of happy\r\nvoices had been coming across the hall so pleasantly that she quite\r\nlonged to join them, and forget her own anxious thoughts of Sister Meg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I the first mouse you have caught, you sly pussies-in-boots?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked, as she was conducted to the big chair, supplied with\r\nrefreshments, and surrounded by a flock of merry-faced listeners.\r\n\r\nThey told her about Silas and his contribution, and she slapped her\r\nforehead in despair, for she was quite at her wits' end, being called\r\nupon so unexpectedly for a bran new tale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I tell about?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys,\xe2\x80\x9d was the general answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a party in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd something good to eat,\xe2\x80\x9d added Stuffy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds me of a story, written years ago, by a dear old lady. I\r\nused to be very fond of it, and I fancy you will like it, for it has\r\nboth boys, and 'something good to eat' in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it called?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The Suspected Boy.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNat looked up from the nuts he was picking, and Mrs. Jo smiled at him,\r\nguessing what was in his mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Crane kept a school for boys in a quiet little town, and a very\r\ngood school it was, of the old-fashioned sort. Six boys lived in her\r\nhouse, and four or five more came in from the town. Among those who\r\nlived with her was one named Lewis White. Lewis was not a bad boy, but\r\nrather timid, and now and then he told a lie. One day a neighbor sent\r\nMiss Crane a basket of gooseberries. There were not enough to go round,\r\nso kind Miss Crane, who liked to please her boys, went to work and made\r\na dozen nice little gooseberry tarts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd like to try gooseberry tarts. I wonder if she made them as I do\r\nmy raspberry ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, whose interest in cooking had lately\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nat, tucking a plump pop-corn into her mouth to silence\r\nher, for he felt a particular interest in this tale, and thought it\r\nopened well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the tarts were done, Miss Crane put them away in the best parlor\r\ncloset, and said not a word about them, for she wanted to surprise the\r\nboys at tea-time. When the minute came and all were seated at table, she\r\nwent to get her tarts, but came back looking much troubled, for what do\r\nyou think had happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody had hooked them!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there they were, but some one had stolen all the fruit out of\r\nthem by lifting up the upper crust and then putting it down after the\r\ngooseberry had been scraped out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mean trick!\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan looked at Tommy, as if to imply that he\r\nwould do the same.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen she told the boys her plan and showed them the poor little\r\npatties all robbed of their sweetness, the boys were much grieved and\r\ndisappointed, and all declared that they knew nothing about the matter.\r\n'Perhaps the rats did it,' said Lewis, who was among the loudest to deny\r\nany knowledge of the tarts. 'No, rats would have nibbled crust and all,\r\nand never lifted it up and scooped out the fruit. Hands did that,' said\r\nMiss Crane, who was more troubled about the lie that some one must have\r\ntold than about her lost patties. Well, they had supper and went to bed,\r\nbut in the night Miss Crane heard some one groaning, and going to\r\nsee who it was she found Lewis in great pain. He had evidently eaten\r\nsomething that disagreed with him, and was so sick that Miss Crane was\r\nalarmed, and was going to send for the doctor, when Lewis moaned out,\r\n'It's the gooseberries; I ate them, and I must tell before I die,' for\r\nthe thought of a doctor frightened him. 'If that is all, I'll give you\r\nan emetic and you will soon get over it,' said Miss Crane. So Lewis had\r\na good dose, and by morning was quite comfortable. 'Oh, don't tell the\r\nboys; they will laugh at me so,' begged the invalid. Kind Miss Crane\r\npromised not to, but Sally, the girl, told the story, and poor Lewis had\r\nno peace for a long time. His mates called him Old Gooseberry, and were\r\nnever tired of asking him the price of tarts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServed him right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBadness always gets found out,\xe2\x80\x9d added Demi, morally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it don't,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Jack, who was tending the apples with great\r\ndevotion, so that he might keep his back to the rest and account for his\r\nred face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, that is only the first part; the second part is more interesting.\r\nSome time after this a peddler came by one day and stopped to show his\r\nthings to the boys, several of whom bought pocket-combs, jew's-harps,\r\nand various trifles of that sort. Among the knives was a little\r\nwhite-handled penknife that Lewis wanted very much, but he had spent all\r\nhis pocket-money, and no one had any to lend him. He held the knife in\r\nhis hand, admiring and longing for it, till the man packed up his goods\r\nto go, then he reluctantly laid it down, and the man went on his way.\r\nThe next day, however, the peddler returned to say that he could not\r\nfind that very knife, and thought he must have left it at Miss Crane's.\r\nIt was a very nice one with a pearl handle, and he could not afford\r\nto lose it. Every one looked, and every one declared they knew nothing\r\nabout it. 'This young gentleman had it last, and seemed to want it very\r\nmuch. Are you quite sure you put it back?' said the man to Lewis, who\r\nwas much troubled at the loss, and vowed over and over again that he did\r\nreturn it. His denials seemed to do no good, however, for every one was\r\nsure he had taken it, and after a stormy scene Miss Crane paid for it,\r\nand the man went grumbling away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Lewis have it?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat, much excited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will see. Now poor Lewis had another trial to bear, for the boys\r\nwere constantly saying, 'Lend me your pearl-handled knife, Gooseberry,'\r\nand things of that sort, till Lewis was so unhappy he begged to be sent\r\nhome. Miss Crane did her best to keep the boys quiet, but it was hard\r\nwork, for they would tease, and she could not be with them all the\r\ntime. That is one of the hardest things to teach boys; they won't 'hit\r\na fellow when he is down,' as they say, but they will torment him in\r\nlittle ways till he would thank them to fight it out all round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I,\xe2\x80\x9d added Nat, softly.\r\n\r\nJack said nothing, but he quite agreed; for he knew that the elder boys\r\ndespised him, and let him alone for that very reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo go on about poor Lewis, Aunt Jo. I don't believe he took the knife,\r\nbut I want to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daisy, in great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, week after week went on and the matter was not cleared up.\r\nThe boys avoided Lewis, and he, poor fellow, was almost sick with the\r\ntrouble he had brought upon himself. He resolved never to tell another\r\nlie, and tried so hard that Miss Crane pitied and helped him, and really\r\ncame at last to believe that he did not take the knife. Two months after\r\nthe peddler's first visit, he came again, and the first thing he said\r\nwas,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Well, ma'am, I found that knife after all. It had slipped behind the\r\nlining of my valise, and fell out the other day when I was putting in a\r\nnew stock of goods. I thought I'd call and let you know, as you paid for\r\nit, and maybe would like it, so here it is.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boys had all gathered round, and at these words they felt much\r\nashamed, and begged Lewis' pardon so heartily that he could not refuse\r\nto give it. Miss Crane presented the knife to him, and he kept it many\r\nyears to remind him of the fault that had brought him so much trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why it is that things you eat on the sly hurt you, and don't\r\nwhen you eat them at table,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Stuffy, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps your conscience affects your stomach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, smiling at\r\nhis speech.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is thinking of the cucumbers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ned, and a gale of merriment\r\nfollowed the words, for Stuffy's last mishap had been a funny one.\r\n\r\nHe ate two large cucumbers in private, felt very ill, and confided\r\nhis anguish to Ned, imploring him to do something. Ned good-naturedly\r\nrecommended a mustard plaster and a hot flat iron to the feet; only in\r\napplying these remedies he reversed the order of things, and put the\r\nplaster on the feet, the flat iron on the stomach, and poor Stuffy was\r\nfound in the barn with blistered soles and a scorched jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you tell another story, that was such an interesting one,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nNat, as the laughter subsided.\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. Jo could refuse these insatiable Oliver Twists, Rob walked\r\ninto the room trailing his little bed-cover after him, and wearing\r\nan expression of great sweetness as he said, steering straight to his\r\nmother as a sure haven of refuge,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a great noise, and I thought sumfin dreffle might have\r\nhappened, so I came to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think I would forget you, naughty boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mother,\r\ntrying to look stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I thought you'd feel better to see me right here,\xe2\x80\x9d responded\r\nthe insinuating little party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had much rather see you in bed, so march straight up again, Robin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody that comes in here has to tell a story, and you can't so\r\nyou'd better cut and run,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can! I tell Teddy lots of ones, all about bears and moons, and\r\nlittle flies that say things when they buzz,\xe2\x80\x9d protested Rob, bound to\r\nstay at any price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell one now, then, right away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, preparing to shoulder and\r\nbear him off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will; let me fink a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob climbed into his mother's\r\nlap, where he was cuddled, with the remark\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a family failing, this getting out of bed at wrong times. Demi\r\nused to do it; and as for me, I was hopping in and out all night long.\r\nMeg used to think the house was on fire, and send me down to see, and I\r\nused to stay and enjoy myself, as you mean to, my bad son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've finked now,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Rob, quite at his ease, and eager to win the\r\nentree into this delightful circle.\r\n\r\nEvery one looked and listened with faces full of suppressed merriment as\r\nRob, perched on his mother's knee and wrapped in the gay coverlet, told\r\nthe following brief but tragic tale with an earnestness that made it\r\nvery funny:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce a lady had a million children, and one nice little boy. She went\r\nup-stairs and said, 'You mustn't go in the yard.' But he wented, and\r\nfell into the pump, and was drowned dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Franz, as Rob paused out of breath with this\r\nstartling beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, there is another piece of it,\xe2\x80\x9d and Rob knit his downy eyebrows in\r\nthe effort to evolve another inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did the lady do when he fell into the pump?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mother, to\r\nhelp him on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she pumped him up, and wrapped him in a newspaper, and put him on a\r\nshelf to dry for seed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA general explosion of laughter greeted this surprising conclusion, and\r\nMrs. Jo patted the curly head, as she said, solemnly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son, you inherit your mother's gift of story-telling. Go where glory\r\nwaits thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I can stay, can't I? Wasn't it a good story?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Rob, in high\r\nfeather at his superb success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can stay till you have eaten these twelve pop-corns,\xe2\x80\x9d said his\r\nmother, expecting to see them vanish at one mouthful.\r\n\r\nBut Rob was a shrewd little man, and got the better of her by eating\r\nthem one by one very slowly, and enjoying every minute with all his\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHadn't you better tell the other story, while you wait for him?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDemi, anxious that no time should be lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really have nothing but a little tale about a wood-box,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nJo, seeing that Rob had still seven corns to eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a boy in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery bit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoody! tell on, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJames Snow and his mother lived in a little house, up in New Hampshire.\r\nThey were poor, and James had to work to help his mother, but he loved\r\nbooks so well he hated work, and just wanted to sit and study all day\r\nlong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could he! I hate books, and like work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, objecting to\r\nJames at the very outset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes all sorts of people to make a world; workers and students both\r\nare needed, and there is room for all. But I think the workers should\r\nstudy some, and the students should know how to work if necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Mrs. Jo, looking from Dan to Demi with a significant\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure I do work,\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi showed three small hard spots in his\r\nlittle palm, with pride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I'm sure I study,\xe2\x80\x9d added Dan, nodding with a groan toward the\r\nblackboard full of neat figures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee what James did. He did not mean to be selfish, but his mother was\r\nproud of him, and let him do as he liked, working by herself that he\r\nmight have books and time to read them. One autumn James wanted to go\r\nto school, and went to the minister to see if he would help him, about\r\ndecent clothes and books. Now the minister had heard the gossip about\r\nJames's idleness, and was not inclined to do much for him, thinking\r\nthat a boy who neglected his mother, and let her slave for him, was\r\nnot likely to do very well even at school. But the good man felt more\r\ninterested when he found how earnest James was, and being rather an odd\r\nman, he made this proposal to the boy, to try now sincere he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I will give you clothes and books on one condition, James.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'What is that, sir?' and the boy brightened up at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You are to keep your mother's wood-box full all winter long, and do\r\nit yourself. If you fail, school stops.' James laughed at the queer\r\ncondition and readily agreed to it, thinking it a very easy one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began school, and for a time got on capitally with the wood-box,\r\nfor it was autumn, and chips and brushwood were plentiful. He ran out\r\nmorning and evening and got a basket full, or chopped up the cat sticks\r\nfor the little cooking stove, and as his mother was careful and saving,\r\nthe task was not hard. But in November the frost came, the days were\r\ndull and cold, and wood went fast. His mother bought a load with her own\r\nearnings, but it seemed to melt away, and was nearly gone, before James\r\nremembered that he was to get the next. Mrs. Snow was feeble and lame\r\nwith rheumatism, and unable to work as she had done, so James had to put\r\ndown the books, and see what he could do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard, for he was going on well, and so interested in his\r\nlessons that he hated to stop except for food and sleep. But he knew the\r\nminister would keep his word, and much against his will James set about\r\nearning money in his spare hours, lest the wood-box should get empty.\r\nHe did all sorts of things, ran errands, took care of a neighbor's cow,\r\nhelped the old sexton dust and warm the church on Sundays, and in these\r\nways got enough to buy fuel in small quantities. But it was hard work;\r\nthe days were short, the winter was bitterly cold, and precious time\r\nwent fast, and the dear books were so fascinating, that it was sad to\r\nleave them, for dull duties that never seemed done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe minister watched him quietly, and seeing that he was in earnest\r\nhelped him without his knowledge. He met him often driving the wood\r\nsleds from the forest, where the men were chopping and as James plodded\r\nbeside the slow oxen, he read or studied, anxious to use every minute.\r\n'The boy is worth helping, this lesson will do him good, and when he\r\nhas learned it, I will give him an easier one,' said the minister\r\nto himself, and on Christmas eve a splendid load of wood was quietly\r\ndropped at the door of the little house, with a new saw and a bit of\r\npaper, saying only,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'The Lord helps those who help themselves.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor James expected nothing, but when he woke on that cold Christmas\r\nmorning, he found a pair of warm mittens, knit by his mother, with her\r\nstiff painful fingers. This gift pleased him very much, but her kiss\r\nand tender look as she called him her 'good son,' was better still. In\r\ntrying to keep her warm, he had warmed his own heart, you see, and\r\nin filling the wood-box he had also filled those months with duties\r\nfaithfully done. He began to see this, to feel that there was something\r\nbetter than books, and to try to learn the lessons God set him, as well\r\nas those his school-master gave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he saw the great pile of oak and pine logs at his door, and read\r\nthe little paper, he knew who sent it, and understood the minister's\r\nplan; thanked him for it, and fell to work with all his might. Other\r\nboys frolicked that day, but James sawed wood, and I think of all\r\nthe lads in the town the happiest was the one in the new mittens, who\r\nwhistled like a blackbird as he filled his mother's wood-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's a first rater!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Dan, who enjoyed a simple matter-of-face\r\nstory better than the finest fairy tale; \xe2\x80\x9cI like that fellow after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could saw wood for you, Aunt Jo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, feeling as if a new\r\nmeans of earning money for his mother was suggested by the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell about a bad boy. I like them best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd better tell about a naughty cross-patch of a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tommy,\r\nwhose evening had been spoilt by Nan's unkindness. It made his apple\r\ntaste bitter, his pop-corn was insipid, his nuts were hard to crack, and\r\nthe sight of Ned and Nan on one bench made him feel his life a burden.\r\n\r\nBut there were no more stories from Mrs. Jo, for on looking down at Rob\r\nhe was discovered to be fast asleep with his last corn firmly clasped in\r\nhis chubby hand. Bundling him up in his coverlet, his mother carried him\r\naway and tucked him up with no fear of his popping out again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let's see who will come next,\xe2\x80\x9d said Emil, setting the door\r\ntemptingly ajar.\r\n\r\nMary Ann passed first, and he called out to her, but Silas had warned\r\nher, and she only laughed and hurried on in spite of their enticements.\r\nPresently a door opened, and a strong voice was heard humming in the\r\nhall,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIch weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten\r\n     Dass ich so traurig bin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's Uncle Fritz; all laugh loud and he will be sure to come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEmil.\r\n\r\nA wild burst of laughter followed, and in came Uncle Fritz, asking,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the joke, my lads?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaught! caught! you can't go out till you've told a story,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nboys, slamming the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! that is the joke then? Well, I have no wish to go, it is so\r\npleasant here, and I pay my forfeit at once,\xe2\x80\x9d which he did by sitting\r\ndown and beginning instantly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA long time ago your Grandfather, Demi, went to lecture in a great\r\ntown, hoping to get some money for a home for little orphans that\r\nsome good people were getting up. His lecture did well, and he put a\r\nconsiderable sum of money in his pocket, feeling very happy about it. As\r\nhe was driving in a chaise to another town, he came to a lonely bit of\r\nroad, late in the afternoon, and was just thinking what a good place it\r\nwas for robbers when he saw a bad-looking man come out of the woods\r\nin front of him and go slowly along as if waiting till he came up. The\r\nthought of the money made Grandfather rather anxious, and at first he\r\nhad a mind to turn round and drive away. But the horse was tired, and\r\nthen he did not like to suspect the man, so he kept on, and when he got\r\nnearer and saw how poor and sick and ragged the stranger looked, his\r\nheart reproached him, and stopping, he said in a kind voice,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'My friend, you look tired; let me give you a lift.' The man seemed\r\nsurprised, hesitated a minute, and then got in. He did not seem inclined\r\nto talk, but Grandfather kept on in his wise, cheerful way, speaking of\r\nwhat a hard year it had been, how much the poor had suffered, and how\r\ndifficult it was to get on sometimes. The man slowly softened a little,\r\nand won by the kind chat, told his story. How he had been sick, could\r\nget no work, had a family of children, and was almost in despair.\r\nGrandfather was so full of pity that he forgot his fear, and, asking the\r\nman his name, said he would try to get him work in the next town, as he\r\nhad friends there. Wishing to get at pencil and paper to write down the\r\naddress, Grandfather took out his plump pocket-book, and the minute he\r\ndid so, the man's eye was on it. Then Grandfather remembered what was in\r\nit and trembled for his money, but said quietly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, I have a little sum here for some poor orphans. I wish it was my\r\nown, I would so gladly give you some of it. I am not rich, but I know\r\nmany of the trials of the poor; this five dollars is mine, and I want to\r\ngive it to you for your children.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hard, hungry look in the man's eyes changed to a grateful one as he\r\ntook the small sum, freely given, and left the orphans' money untouched.\r\nHe rode on with Grandfather till they approached the town, then he asked\r\nto be set down. Grandpa shook hands with him, and was about to drive on,\r\nwhen the man said, as if something made him, 'I was desperate when we\r\nmet, and I meant to rob you, but you were so kind I couldn't do it. God\r\nbless you, sir, for keeping me from it!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Grandpa ever see him again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Daisy, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I believe the man found work, and did not try robbery any\r\nmore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was a curious way to treat him; I'd have knocked him down,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKindness is always better than force. Try it and see,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr.\r\nBhaer, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell another, please,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Daisy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must, Aunt Jo did,\xe2\x80\x9d added Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I certainly won't, but keep my others for next time. Too many\r\ntales are as bad as too many bonbons. I have paid my forfeit and I go,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Mr. Bhaer ran for his life, with the whole flock in full pursuit. He\r\nhad the start, however, and escaped safely into his study, leaving the\r\nboys to go rioting back again.\r\n\r\nThey were so stirred up by the race that they could not settle to their\r\nformer quiet, and a lively game of Blindman's Buff followed, in which\r\nTommy showed that he had taken the moral of the last story to heart,\r\nfor, when he caught Nan, he whispered in her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cI'm sorry I called\r\nyou a cross-patch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNan was not to be outdone in kindness, so, when they played \xe2\x80\x9cButton,\r\nbutton, who's got the button?\xe2\x80\x9d and it was her turn to go round, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cHold fast all I give you,\xe2\x80\x9d with such a friendly smile at Tommy,\r\nthat he was not surprised to find the horse-hair ring in his hand\r\ninstead of the button. He only smiled back at her then, but when they\r\nwere going to bed, he offered Nan the best bite of his last apple; she\r\nsaw the ring on his stumpy little finger, accepted the bite, and peace\r\nwas declared. Both were ashamed of the temporary coldness, neither was\r\nashamed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI was wrong, forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d so the childish friendship\r\nremained unbroken, and the home in the willow lasted long, a pleasant\r\nlittle castle in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. THANKSGIVING\r\n\r\nThis yearly festival was always kept at Plumfield in the good\r\nold-fashioned way, and nothing was allowed to interfere with it. For\r\ndays beforehand, the little girls helped Asia and Mrs. Jo in store-room\r\nand kitchen, making pies and puddings, sorting fruit, dusting dishes,\r\nand being very busy and immensely important. The boys hovered on the\r\noutskirts of the forbidden ground, sniffing the savory odors, peeping\r\nin at the mysterious performances, and occasionally being permitted to\r\ntaste some delicacy in the process of preparation.\r\n\r\nSomething more than usual seemed to be on foot this year, for the girls\r\nwere as busy up-stairs as down, so were the boys in school-room and\r\nbarn, and a general air of bustle pervaded the house. There was a great\r\nhunting up of old ribbons and finery, much cutting and pasting of gold\r\npaper, and the most remarkable quantity of straw, gray cotton, flannel,\r\nand big black beads, used by Franz and Mrs. Jo. Ned hammered at strange\r\nmachines in the workshop, Demi and Tommy went about murmuring to\r\nthemselves as if learning something. A fearful racket was heard in\r\nEmil's room at intervals, and peals of laughter from the nursery when\r\nRob and Teddy were sent for and hidden from sight whole hours at a time.\r\nBut the thing that puzzled Mr. Bhaer the most was what became of Rob's\r\nbig pumpkin. It had been borne in triumph to the kitchen, where a dozen\r\ngolden-tinted pies soon after appeared. It would not have taken more\r\nthan a quarter of the mammoth vegetable to make them, yet where was the\r\nrest? It disappeared, and Rob never seemed to care, only chuckled when\r\nit was mentioned, and told his father, \xe2\x80\x9cTo wait and see,\xe2\x80\x9d for the fun of\r\nthe whole thing was to surprise Father Bhaer at the end, and not let him\r\nknow a bit about what was to happen.\r\n\r\nHe obediently shut eyes, ears, and mouth, and went about trying not\r\nto see what was in plain sight, not to hear the tell-tale sounds that\r\nfilled the air, not to understand any of the perfectly transparent\r\nmysteries going on all about him. Being a German, he loved these simple\r\ndomestic festivals, and encouraged them with all his heart, for they\r\nmade home so pleasant that the boys did not care to go elsewhere for\r\nfun.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the day came, the boys went off for a long walk, that they\r\nmight have good appetites for dinner; as if they ever needed them! The\r\ngirls remained at home to help set the table, and give last touches to\r\nvarious affairs which filled their busy little souls with anxiety. The\r\nschool-room had been shut up since the night before, and Mr. Bhaer was\r\nforbidden to enter it on pain of a beating from Teddy, who guarded the\r\ndoor like a small dragon, though he was dying to tell about it, and\r\nnothing but his father's heroic self-denial in not listening, kept him\r\nfrom betraying a grand secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all done, and it's perfectly splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, coming out at\r\nlast with an air of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe you know goes beautifully, and Silas knows just what to do now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added Daisy, skipping with delight at some unspeakable success.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm blest if it ain't the 'cutest thing I ever see, them critters in\r\nparticular,\xe2\x80\x9d said Silas, who had been let into the secret, went off\r\nlaughing like a great boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming; I hear Emil roaring 'Land lubbers lying down below,'\r\nso we must run and dress,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nan, and up-stairs they scampered in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nThe boys came trooping home with appetites that would have made the big\r\nturkey tremble, if it had not been past all fear. They also retired to\r\ndress; and for half-an-hour there was a washing, brushing, and prinking\r\nthat would have done any tidy woman's heart good to see. When the bell\r\nrang, a troop of fresh-faced lads with shiny hair, clean collars, and\r\nSunday jackets on, filed into the dining-room, where Mrs. Jo, in her\r\none black silk, with a knot of her favorite white chrysanthemums in her\r\nbosom, sat at the head of the table, \xe2\x80\x9clooking splendid,\xe2\x80\x9d as the boys\r\nsaid, whenever she got herself up. Daisy and Nan were as gay as a posy\r\nbed in their new winter dresses, with bright sashes and hair ribbons.\r\nTeddy was gorgeous to behold in a crimson merino blouse, and his best\r\nbutton boots, which absorbed and distracted him as much as Mr. Toot's\r\nwristbands did on one occasion.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. and Mrs. Bhaer glanced at each other down the long table, with\r\nthose rows of happy faces on either side, they had a little thanksgiving\r\nall to themselves, and without a word, for one heart said to the other,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur work has prospered, let us be grateful and go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clatter of knives and forks prevented much conversation for a few\r\nminutes, and Mary Ann with an amazing pink bow in her hair \xe2\x80\x9cflew round\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n briskly, handing plates and ladling out gravy. Nearly every one had\r\ncontributed to the feast, so the dinner was a peculiarly interesting\r\nones to the eaters of it, who beguiled the pauses by remarks on their\r\nown productions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf these are not good potatoes I never saw any,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Jack, as he\r\nreceived his fourth big mealy one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of my herbs are in the stuffing of the turkey, that's why it's so\r\nnice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nan, taking a mouthful with intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ducks are prime any way; Asia said she never cooked such fat ones,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n added Tommy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, our carrots are beautiful, ain't they, and our parsnips will\r\nbe ever so good when we dig them,\xe2\x80\x9d put in Dick, and Dolly murmured his\r\nassent from behind the bone he was picking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI helped make the pies with my pumpkin,\xe2\x80\x9d called out Robby, with a laugh\r\nwhich he stopped by retiring into his mug.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI picked some of the apples that the cider is made of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI raked the cranberries for the sauce,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got the nuts,\xe2\x80\x9d added Dan, and so it went on all round the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho made up Thanksgiving?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, for being lately promoted to\r\njacket and trousers he felt a new and manly interest in the institutions\r\nof his country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee who can answer that question,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Bhaer nodded to one or two\r\nof his best history boys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Pilgrims made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rob, without waiting to learn who the Pilgrims were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forget,\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi subsided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it was because they were starved once, and so when they had a\r\ngood harvest, they said, 'We will thank God for it,' and they had a day\r\nand called it Thanksgiving,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dan, who liked the story of the brave\r\nmen who suffered so nobly for their faith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! I didn't think you would remember any thing but natural history,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and Mr. Bhaer tapped gently on the table as applause for his pupil.\r\n\r\nDan looked pleased; and Mrs. Jo said to her son, \xe2\x80\x9cNow do you understand\r\nabout it, Robby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't. I thought pil-grins were a sort of big bird that lived on\r\nrocks, and I saw pictures of them in Demi's book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe means penguins. Oh, isn't he a little goosey!\xe2\x80\x9d and Demi laid back in\r\nhis chair and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't laugh at him, but tell him all about it if you can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nBhaer, consoling Rob with more cranberry sauce for the general smile\r\nthat went round the table at his mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will;\xe2\x80\x9d and, after a pause to collect his ideas, Demi delivered\r\nthe following sketch of the Pilgrim Fathers, which would have made even\r\nthose grave gentlemen smile if they could have heard it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Rob, some of the people in England didn't like the king, or\r\nsomething, so they got into ships and sailed away to this country. It\r\nwas all full of Indians, and bears, and wild creatures, and they lived\r\nin forts, and had a dreadful time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bears?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Robby, with interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; the Pilgrims, because the Indians troubled them. They hadn't enough\r\nto eat, and they went to church with guns, and ever so many died, and\r\nthey got out of the ships on a rock, and it's called Plymouth Rock, and\r\nAunt Jo saw it and touched it. The Pilgrims killed all the Indians,\r\nand got rich; and hung the witches, and were very good; and some of the\r\ngreatest great-grandpas came in the ships. One was the Mayflower; and\r\nthey made Thanksgiving, and we have it always, and I like it. Some more\r\nturkey, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Demi will be an historian, there is such order and clearness in\r\nhis account of events;\xe2\x80\x9d and Uncle Fritz's eyes laughed at Aunt Jo, as he\r\nhelped the descendant of the Pilgrims to his third bit of turkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you must eat as much as ever you could on Thanksgiving.\r\nBut Franz says you mustn't even then;\xe2\x80\x9d and Stuffy looked as if he had\r\nreceived bad news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFranz is right, so mind your knife and fork, and be moderate, or else\r\nyou won't be able to help in the surprise by and by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll be careful; but everybody does eat lots, and I like it better\r\nthan being moderate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuffy, who leaned to the popular belief that\r\nThanksgiving must be kept by coming as near apoplexy as possible, and\r\nescaping with merely a fit of indigestion or a headache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my 'pilgrims' amuse yourselves quietly till tea-time, for you will\r\nhave enough excitement this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jo, as they rose from\r\nthe table after a protracted sitting, finished by drinking every one's\r\nhealth in cider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will take the whole flock for a drive, it is so pleasant;\r\nthen you can rest, my dear, or you will be worn out this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nMr. Bhaer; and as soon as coats and hats could be put on, the great\r\nomnibus was packed full, and away they went for a long gay drive,\r\nleaving Mrs. Jo to rest and finish sundry small affairs in peace.\r\n\r\nAn early and light tea was followed by more brushing of hair and washing\r\nof hands; then the flock waited impatiently for the company to come.\r\nOnly the family was expected; for these small revels were strictly\r\ndomestic, and such being the case, sorrow was not allowed to sadden the\r\npresent festival. All came; Mr. and Mrs. March, with Aunt Meg, so sweet\r\nand lovely, in spite of her black dress and the little widow's cap that\r\nencircled her tranquil face. Uncle Teddy and Aunt Amy, with the Princess\r\nlooking more fairy-like than ever, in a sky-blue gown, and a great\r\nbouquet of hot-house flowers, which she divided among the boys, sticking\r\none in each button-hole, making them feel peculiarly elegant and\r\nfestive. One strange face appeared, and Uncle Teddy led the unknown\r\ngentleman up to the Bhaers, saying,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Mr. Hyde; he has been inquiring about Dan, and I ventured to\r\nbring him to-night, that he might see how much the boy has improved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Bhaers received him cordially, for Dan's sake, pleased that the lad\r\nhad been remembered. But, after a few minutes' chat, they were glad to\r\nknow Mr. Hyde for his own sake, so genial, simple, and interesting was\r\nhe. It was pleasant to see the boy's face light up when he caught\r\nsight of his friend; pleasanter still to see Mr. Hyde's surprise and\r\nsatisfaction in Dan's improved manners and appearance, and pleasantest\r\nof all to watch the two sit talking in a corner, forgetting the\r\ndifferences of age, culture, and position, in the one subject which\r\ninterested both, as man and boy compared notes, and told the story of\r\ntheir summer life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe performance must begin soon, or the actors will go to sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Jo, when the first greetings were over.\r\n\r\nSo every one went into the school-room, and took seats before a curtain\r\nmade of two bed-covers. The children had already vanished; but stifled\r\nlaughter, and funny little exclamations from behind the curtain,\r\nbetrayed their whereabouts. The entertainment began with a spirited\r\nexhibition of gymnastics, led by Franz. The six elder lads, in blue\r\ntrousers and red shirts, made a fine display of muscle with dumb-bells,\r\nclubs, and weights, keeping time to the music of the piano, played by\r\nMrs. Jo behind the scenes. Dan was so energetic in this exercise, that\r\nthere was some danger of his knocking down his neighbors, like so many\r\nnine-pins, or sending his bean-bags whizzing among the audience; for he\r\nwas excited by Mr. Hyde's presence, and a burning desire to do honor to\r\nhis teachers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fine, strong lad. If I go on my trip to South America, in a year or\r\ntwo, I shall be tempted to ask you to lend him to me, Mr. Bhaer,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMr. Hyde, whose interest in Dan was much increased by the report he had\r\njust heard of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have him, and welcome, though we shall miss our young\r\nHercules very much. It would do him a world of good, and I am sure he\r\nwould serve his friend faithfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDan heard both question and answer, and his heart leaped with joy at the\r\nthought of travelling in a new country with Mr. Hyde, and swelled with\r\ngratitude for the kindly commendation which rewarded his efforts to be\r\nall these friends desired to see him.\r\n\r\nAfter the gymnastics, Demi and Tommy spoke the old school dialogue,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney makes the mare go.\xe2\x80\x9d Demi did very well, but Tommy was capital\r\nas the old farmer; for he imitated Silas in a way that convulsed the\r\naudience, and caused Silas himself to laugh so hard that Asia had\r\nto slap him on the back, as they stood in the hall enjoying the fun\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\nThen Emil, who had got his breath by this time, gave them a sea-song\r\nin costume, with a great deal about \xe2\x80\x9cstormy winds,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clee shores,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\na rousing chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cLuff, boys, luff,\xe2\x80\x9d which made the room ring; after\r\nwhich Ned performed a funny Chinese dance, and hopped about like a large\r\nfrog in a pagoda hat. As this was the only public exhibition ever held\r\nat Plumfield, a few exercises in lightning-arithmetic, spelling,\r\nand reading were given. Jack quite amazed the public by his rapid\r\ncalculations on the blackboard. Tommy won in the spelling match, and\r\nDemi read a little French fable so well that Uncle Teddy was charmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the other children?\xe2\x80\x9d asked every one as the curtain fell, and\r\nnone of the little ones appeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is the surprise. It's so lovely, I pity you because you don't\r\nknow it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Demi, who had gone to get his mother's kiss, and stayed\r\nby her to explain the mystery when it should be revealed.\r\n\r\nGoldilocks had been carried off by Aunt Jo, to the great amazement of\r\nher papa, who quite outdid Mr. Bhaer in acting wonder, suspense, and\r\nwild impatience to know \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last, after much rustling, hammering, and very audible directions\r\nfrom the stage manager, the curtain rose to soft music, and Bess was\r\ndiscovered sitting on a stool beside a brown paper fire-place. A dearer\r\nlittle Cinderella was never seen; for the gray gown was very ragged, the\r\ntiny shoes all worn, the face so pretty under the bright hair, and the\r\nattitude so dejected, it brought tears, as well as smiles, to the fond\r\neyes looking at the baby actress. She sat quite still, till a voice\r\nwhispered, \xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d then she sighed a funny little sigh, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nI wish I tood go to the ball!\xe2\x80\x9d so naturally, that her father clapped\r\nfrantically, and her mother called out, \xe2\x80\x9cLittle darling!\xe2\x80\x9d These highly\r\nimproper expressions of feeling caused Cinderella to forget herself, and\r\nshake her head at them, saying, reprovingly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn't 'peak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence instantly prevailed, and three taps were heard on the wall.\r\nCinderella looked alarmed, but before she could remember to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nis dat?\xe2\x80\x9d the back of the brown paper fire-place opened like a door, and,\r\nwith some difficulty, the fairy godmother got herself and her pointed\r\nhat through. It was Nan, in a red cloak, a cap, and a wand, which she\r\nwaved as she said decidedly,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall go to the ball, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must pull and show my pretty dress,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cinderella,\r\ntugging at her brown gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; you must say, 'How can I go in my rags?'\xe2\x80\x9d said the godmother in\r\nher own voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, so I mus';\xe2\x80\x9d and the Princess said it, quite undisturbed by her\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI change your rags into a splendid dress, because you are good,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe godmother in her stage tones; and deliberately unbuttoning the brown\r\npinafore, she displayed a gorgeous sight.\r\n\r\nThe little Princess really was pretty enough to turn the heads of any\r\nnumber of small princes, for her mamma had dressed her like a tiny court\r\nlady, in a rosy silk train with satin under-skirt, and bits of bouquets\r\nhere and there, quite lovely to behold. The godmother put a crown, with\r\npink and white feathers drooping from it, on her head, and gave her\r\na pair of silver paper slippers, which she put on, and then stood up,\r\nlifting her skirts to show them to the audience, saying, with pride, \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndlass ones, ain't they pitty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so charmed with them, that she was with difficulty recalled to\r\nher part, and made to say,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have no toach, Dodmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBehold it!\xe2\x80\x9d and Nan waved her wand with such a flourish, that she\r\nnearly knocked off the crown of the Princess.\r\n\r\nThen appeared the grand triumph of the piece. First, a rope was seen to\r\nflap on the floor, to tighten with a twitch as Emil's voice was heard\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x9cHeave, ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d and Silas's gruff one to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cStiddy,\r\nnow, stiddy!\xe2\x80\x9d A shout of laughter followed, for four large gray rats\r\nappeared, rather shaky as to their legs, and queer as to their tails,\r\nbut quite fine about the head, where black beads shone in the most\r\nlifelike manner. They drew, or were intended to appear as if they did,\r\na magnificent coach made of half the mammoth pumpkin, mounted on the\r\nwheels of Teddy's wagon, painted yellow to match the gay carriage.\r\nPerched on a seat in front sat a jolly little coachman in a white\r\ncotton-wool wig, cocked hat, scarlet breeches, and laced coat, who\r\ncracked a long whip and jerked the red reins so energetically, that the\r\ngray steeds reared finely. It was Teddy, and he beamed upon the company\r\nso affably that they gave him a round all to himself; and Uncle Laurie\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could find as sober a coachman as that one, I would engage\r\nhim on the spot.\xe2\x80\x9d The coach stopped, the godmother lifted in the\r\nPrincess, and she was trundled away in state, kissing her hand to the\r\npublic, with her glass shoes sticking up in front, and her pink train\r\nsweeping the ground behind, for, elegant as the coach was, I regret to\r\nsay that her Highness was rather a tight fit.\r\n\r\nThe next scene was the ball, and here Nan and Daisy appeared as gay as\r\npeacocks in all sorts of finery. Nan was especially good as the proud\r\nsister, and crushed many imaginary ladies as she swept about the\r\npalace-hall. The Prince, in solitary state upon a somewhat unsteady\r\nthrone, sat gazing about him from under an imposing crown, as he played\r\nwith his sword and admired the rosettes in his shoes. When Cinderella\r\ncame in he jumped up, and exclaimed, with more warmth than elegance,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy gracious! who is that?\xe2\x80\x9d and immediately led the lady out to dance,\r\nwhile the sisters scowled and turned up their noses in the corner.\r\n\r\nThe stately jig executed by the little couple was very pretty, for the\r\nchildish faces were so earnest, the costumes so gay, and the steps so\r\npeculiar, that they looked like the dainty quaint figures painted on\r\na Watteau fan. The Princess's train was very much in her way, and\r\nthe sword of Prince Rob nearly tripped him up several times. But they\r\novercame these obstacles remarkably well, and finished the dance with\r\nmuch grace and spirit, considering that neither knew what the other was\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrop your shoe,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Mrs. Jo's voice as the lady was about to sit\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I fordot!\xe2\x80\x9d and, taking off one of the silvery slippers, Cinderella\r\nplanted it carefully in the middle of the stage, said to Rob, \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\r\nmust try and tatch me,\xe2\x80\x9d and ran away, while the Prince, picking up the\r\nshoe, obediently trotted after her.\r\n\r\nThe third scene, as everybody knows, is where the herald comes to try\r\non the shoe. Teddy, still in coachman's dress, came in blowing a tin\r\nfish-horn melodiously, and the proud sisters each tried to put on the\r\nslipper. Nan insisted on playing cut off her toe with a carving-knife,\r\nand performed that operation so well that the herald was alarmed, and\r\nbegged her to be \xe2\x80\x9cwelly keerful.\xe2\x80\x9d Cinderella then was called, and came\r\nin with the pinafore half on, slipped her foot into the slipper, and\r\nannounced, with satisfaction,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the Pinsiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDaisy wept, and begged pardon; but Nan, who liked tragedy, improved upon\r\nthe story, and fell in a fainting-fit upon the floor, where she remained\r\ncomfortably enjoying the rest of the play. It was not long, for the\r\nPrince ran in, dropped upon his knees, and kissed the hand of Goldilocks\r\nwith great ardor, while the herald blew a blast that nearly deafened the\r\naudience. The curtain had no chance to fall, for the Princess ran off\r\nthe stage to her father, crying, \xe2\x80\x9cDidn't I do well?\xe2\x80\x9d while the Prince\r\nand herald had a fencing-match with the tin horn and wooden sword.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said every one; and, when the raptures had a little\r\nsubsided, Nat came out with his violin in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! hush!\xe2\x80\x9d cried all the children, and silence followed, for\r\nsomething in the boy's bashful manner and appealing eyes make every one\r\nlisten kindly.\r\n\r\nThe Bhaers thought he would play some of the old airs he knew so well,\r\nbut, to their surprise, they heard a new and lovely melody, so softly,\r\nsweetly played, that they could hardly believe it could be Nat. It was\r\none of those songs without words that touch the heart, and sing of all\r\ntender home-like hopes and joys, soothing and cheering those who listen\r\nto its simple music. Aunt Meg leaned her head on Demi's shoulder,\r\nGrandmother wiped her eyes, and Mrs. Jo looked up at Mr. Laurie, saying,\r\nin a choky whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou composed that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted your boy to do you honor, and thank you in his own way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Laurie, leaning down to answer her.\r\n\r\nWhen Nat made his bow and was about to go, he was called back by many\r\nhands, and had to play again. He did so with such a happy face, that\r\nit was good to see him, for he did his best, and gave them the gay old\r\ntunes that set the feet to dancing, and made quietude impossible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear the floor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Emil; and in a minute the chairs were pushed\r\nback, the older people put safely in corners and the children gathered\r\non the stage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow your manners!\xe2\x80\x9d called Emil; and the boys pranced up to the ladies,\r\nold and young; with polite invitations to \xe2\x80\x9ctread the mazy,\xe2\x80\x9d as dear Dick\r\nSwiveller has it. The small lads nearly came to blows for the Princess,\r\nbut she chose Dick, like a kind, little gentlewoman as she was, and let\r\nhim lead her proudly to her place. Mrs. Jo was not allowed to decline;\r\nand Aunt Amy filled Dan with unspeakable delight by refusing Franz and\r\ntaking him. Of course Nan and Tommy, Nat and Daisy paired off, while\r\nUncle Teddy went and got Asia, who was longing to \xe2\x80\x9cjig it,\xe2\x80\x9d and felt\r\nmuch elated by the honor done her. Silas and Mary Ann had a private\r\ndance in the hall; and for half-an-hour Plumfield was at its merriest.\r\n\r\nThe party wound up with a grand promenade of all the young folks, headed\r\nby the pumpkin-coach with the Princess and driver inside, and the rats\r\nin a wildly frisky state.\r\n\r\nWhile the children enjoyed this final frolic, the elders sat in the\r\nparlor looking on as they talked together of the little people with the\r\ninterest of parents and friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, all by yourself, with such a happy face,\r\nsister Jo?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laurie, sitting down beside her on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy summer's work, Teddy, and amusing myself by imagining the future of\r\nmy boys,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, smiling as she made room for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are all to be poets, painters, and statesmen, famous soldiers, or\r\nat least merchant princes, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not as aspiring as I once was, and I shall be satisfied if\r\nthey are honest men. But I will confess that I do expect a little glory\r\nand a career for some of them. Demi is not a common child, and I think\r\nhe will blossom into something good and great in the best sense of the\r\nword. The others will do well, I hope, especially my last two boys, for,\r\nafter hearing Nat play to-night, I really think he has genius.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo soon to say; talent he certainly has, and there is no doubt that\r\nthe boy can soon earn his bread by the work he loves. Build him up for\r\nanother year or so, and then I will take him off your hands, and launch\r\nhim properly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is such a pleasant prospect for poor Nat, who came to me six\r\nmonths ago so friendless and forlorn. Dan's future is already plain\r\nto me. Mr. Hyde will want him soon, and I mean to give him a brave and\r\nfaithful little servant. Dan is one who can serve well if the wages are\r\nlove and confidence, and he has the energy to carve out his own future\r\nin his own way. Yes, I am very happy over our success with these boys\r\none so weak, and one so wild; both so much better now, and so full of\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat magic did you use, Jo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only loved them, and let them see it. Fritz did the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear soul! you look as if 'only loving' had been rather hard work\r\nsometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laurie, stroking her thin cheek with a look of more\r\ntender admiration than he had ever given her as a girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm a faded old woman, but I'm a very happy one; so don't pity me,\r\nTeddy;\xe2\x80\x9d and she glanced about the room with eyes full of a sincere\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your plan seems to work better and better every year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nwith an emphatic nod of approval toward the cheery scene before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can it fail to work well when I have so much help from you all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Mrs. Jo, looking gratefully at her most generous patron.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the best joke of the family, this school of yours and its\r\nsuccess. So unlike the future we planned for you, and yet so suited to\r\nyou after all. It was a regular inspiration, Jo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laurie, dodging\r\nher thanks as usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! but you laughed at it in the beginning, and still make all manner\r\nof fun of me and my inspirations. Didn't you predict that having girls\r\nwith the boys would be a dead failure? Now see how well it works;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe pointed to the happy group of lads and lassies dancing, singing, and\r\nchattering together with every sign of kindly good fellowship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give in, and when my Goldilocks is old enough I'll send her to you.\r\nCan I say more than that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be so proud to have your little treasure trusted to me. But\r\nreally, Teddy, the effect of these girls has been excellent. I know you\r\nwill laugh at me, but I don't mind, I'm used to it; so I'll tell you\r\nthat one of my favorite fancies is to look at my family as a small\r\nworld, to watch the progress of my little men, and, lately, to see how\r\nwell the influence of my little women works upon them. Daisy is the\r\ndomestic element, and they all feel the charm of her quiet, womanly\r\nways. Nan is the restless, energetic, strong-minded one; they admire her\r\ncourage, and give her a fair chance to work out her will, seeing that\r\nshe has sympathy as well as strength, and the power to do much in their\r\nsmall world. Your Bess is the lady, full of natural refinement, grace,\r\nand beauty. She polishes them unconsciously, and fills her place as any\r\nlovely woman may, using her gentle influence to lift and hold them above\r\nthe coarse, rough things of life, and keep them gentlemen in the best\r\nsense of the fine old word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not always the ladies who do that best, Jo. It is sometimes the\r\nstrong brave woman who stirs up the boy and makes a man of him;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nLaurie bowed to her with a significant laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I think the graceful woman, whom the boy you allude to married, has\r\ndone more for him than the wild Nan of his youth; or, better still, the\r\nwise, motherly woman who watched over him, as Daisy watches over Demi,\r\ndid more to make him what he is;\xe2\x80\x9d and Jo turned toward her mother, who\r\nsat a little apart with Meg, looking so full of the sweet dignity and\r\nbeauty of old age, that Laurie gave her a glance of filial respect and\r\nlove as he replied, in serious earnest,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll three did much for him, and I can understand how well these little\r\ngirls will help your lads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot more than the lads help them; it is mutual, I assure you. Nat does\r\nmuch for Daisy with his music; Dan can manage Nan better than any of\r\nus; and Demi teaches your Goldilocks so easily and well that Fritz calls\r\nthem Roger Ascham and Lady Jane Grey. Dear me! if men and women would\r\nonly trust, understand, and help one another as my children do, what a\r\ncapital place the world would be!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Jo's eyes grew absent, as if\r\nshe was looking at a new and charming state of society in which people\r\nlived as happily and innocently as her flock at Plumfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are doing your best to help on the good time, my dear. Continue\r\nto believe in it, to work for it, and to prove its possibility by the\r\nsuccess of her small experiment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. March, pausing as he passed\r\nto say an encouraging word, for the good man never lost his faith in\r\nhumanity, and still hoped to see peace, good-will, and happiness reign\r\nupon the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so ambitious as that, father. I only want to give these\r\nchildren a home in which they can be taught a few simple things which\r\nwill help to make life less hard to them when they go out to fight their\r\nbattles in the world. Honesty, courage, industry, faith in God, their\r\nfellow-creatures, and themselves; that is all I try for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is every thing. Give them these helps, then let them go to work\r\nout their life as men and women; and whatever their success or failure\r\nis, I think they will remember and bless your efforts, my good son and\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Professor had joined them, and as Mr. March spoke he gave a hand\r\nto each, and left them with a look that was a blessing. As Jo and her\r\nhusband stood together for a moment talking quietly, and feeling that\r\ntheir summer work had been well done if father approved, Mr. Laurie\r\nslipped into the hall, said a word to the children, and all of a sudden\r\nthe whole flock pranced into the room, joined hands and danced about\r\nFather and Mother Bhaer, singing blithely,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSummer days are over,\r\n     Summer work is done;\r\n     Harvests have been gathered\r\n     Gayly one by one.\r\n     Now the feast is eaten,\r\n     Finished is the play;\r\n     But one rite remains for\r\n     Our Thanksgiving-day.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBest of all the harvest\r\n     In the dear God's sight,\r\n     Are the happy children\r\n     In the home to-night;\r\n     And we come to offer\r\n     Thanks where thanks are due,\r\n     With grateful hearts and voices,\r\n     Father, mother, unto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the last words the circle narrowed till the good Professor and his\r\nwife were taken prisoner by many arms, and half hidden by the bouquet of\r\nlaughing young faces which surrounded them, proving that one plant had\r\ntaken root and blossomed beautifully in all the little gardens. For love\r\nis a flower that grows in any soil, works its sweet miracles undaunted\r\nby autumn frost or winter snow, blooming fair and fragrant all the year,\r\nand blessing those who give and those who receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Little Men, by Louisa May Alcott\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LITTLE MEN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2788-0.txt or 2788-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/7/8/2788/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
