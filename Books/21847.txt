Jeffrey Wortle, D.D., was a man much esteemed by others,--and by\r\nhimself.  He combined two professions, in both of which he had been\r\nsuccessful,--had been, and continued to be, at the time in which we speak\r\nof him.  I will introduce him to the reader in the present tense as Rector\r\nof Bowick, and proprietor and head-master of the school established in the\r\nvillage of that name.  The seminary at Bowick had for some time enjoyed a\r\nreputation under him;--not that he had ever himself used so new-fangled\r\nand unpalatable a word in speaking of his school.  Bowick School had been\r\nestablished by himself as preparatory to Eton.  Dr. Wortle had been\r\nelected to an assistant-mastership at Eton early in life soon after he had\r\nbecome a Fellow of Exeter.  There he had worked successfully for ten\r\nyears, and had then retired to the living of Bowick.  On going there he\r\nhad determined to occupy his leisure, and if possible to make his fortune,\r\nby taking a few boys into his house.  By dint of charging high prices and\r\ngiving good food,--perhaps in part, also, by the quality of the education\r\nwhich he imparted,--his establishment had become popular and had outgrown\r\nthe capacity of the parsonage.  He had been enabled to purchase a field or\r\ntwo close abutting on the glebe gardens, and had there built convenient\r\npremises.  He now limited his number to thirty boys, for each of which he\r\ncharged \xa3200 a-year.  It was said of him by his friends that if he would\r\nonly raise his price to \xa3250, he might double the number, and really make\r\na fortune.  In answer to this, he told his friends that he knew his own\r\nbusiness best;--he declared that his charge was the only sum that was\r\ncompatible both with regard to himself and honesty to his customers, and\r\nasserted that the labours he endured were already quite heavy enough.  In\r\nfact, he recommended all those who gave him advice to mind their own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIt may be said of him that he knew his own so well as to justify him in\r\nrepudiating counsel from others.  There are very different ideas of what\r\n"a fortune" may be supposed to consist.  It will not be necessary to give\r\nDr. Wortle\'s exact idea.  No doubt it changed with him, increasing as his\r\nmoney increased.  But he was supposed to be a comfortable man.  He paid\r\nready money and high prices.  He liked that people under him should\r\nthrive,--and he liked them to know that they throve by his means.  He\r\nliked to be master, and always was.  He was just, and liked his justice to\r\nbe recognised.  He was generous also, and liked that, too, to be known.\r\nHe kept a carriage for his wife, who had been the daughter of a poor\r\nclergyman at Windsor, and was proud to see her as well dressed as the wife\r\nof any county squire.  But he was a domineering husband.  As his wife\r\nworshipped him, and regarded him as a Jupiter on earth from whose nod\r\nthere could be and should be no appeal, but little harm came from this.\r\nIf a tyrant, he was an affectionate tyrant.  His wife felt him to be so.\r\nHis servants, his parish, and his school all felt him to be so.  They\r\nobeyed him, loved him, and believed in him.\r\n\r\nSo, upon the whole, at the time with which we are dealing, did the\r\ndiocese, the county, and that world of parents by whom the boys were sent\r\nto his school.  But this had not come about without some hard fighting.\r\nHe was over fifty years of age, and had been Rector of Bowick for nearly\r\ntwenty.  During that time there had been a succession of three bishops,\r\nand he had quarrelled more or less with all of them.  It might be juster\r\nto say that they had all of them had more or less of occasion to find\r\nfault with him.  Now Dr. Wortle,--or Mr. Wortle, as he should be called in\r\nreference to that period,--was a man who would bear censure from no human\r\nbeing.  He had left his position at Eton because the Head-master had\r\nrequired from him some slight change of practice.  There had been no\r\nquarrel on that occasion, but Mr. Wortle had gone.  He at once commenced\r\nhis school at Bowick, taking half-a-dozen pupils into his own house.  The\r\nbishop of that day suggested that the cure of the souls of the\r\nparishioners of Bowick was being subordinated to the Latin and Greek of\r\nthe sons of the nobility.  The bishop got a response which gave an\r\nadditional satisfaction to his speedy translation to a more comfortable\r\ndiocese.  Between the next bishop and Mr. Wortle there was, unfortunately,\r\nmisunderstanding, and almost feud for the entire ten years during which\r\nhis lordship reigned in the Palace of Broughton.  This Bishop of Broughton\r\nhad been one of that large batch of Low Church prelates who were brought\r\nforward under Lord Palmerston.  Among them there was none more low, more\r\npious, more sincere, or more given to interference.  To teach Mr. Wortle\r\nhis duty as a parish clergyman was evidently a necessity to such a bishop.\r\nTo repudiate any such teaching was evidently a necessity to Mr. Wortle.\r\nConsequently there were differences, in all of which Mr. Wortle carried\r\nhis own.  What the good bishop suffered no one probably knew except his\r\nwife and his domestic chaplain.  What Mr. Wortle enjoyed,--or Dr. Wortle,\r\nas he came to be called about this time,--was patent to all the county and\r\nall the diocese.  The sufferer died, not, let us hope, by means of the\r\nDoctor; and then came the third bishop.  He, too, had found himself\r\nobliged to say a word.  He was a man of the world,--wise, prudent, not\r\ngiven to interference or fault-finding, friendly by nature, one who\r\naltogether hated a quarrel, a bishop beyond all things determined to be\r\nthe friend of his clergymen;--and yet he thought himself obliged to say a\r\nword.  There were matters in which Dr. Wortle affected a peculiarly\r\nanti-clerical mode of expression, if not of feeling.  He had been foolish\r\nenough to declare openly that he was in search of a curate who should have\r\nnone of the "grace of godliness" about him.  He was wont to ridicule the\r\npiety of young men who devoted themselves entirely to their religious\r\noffices.  In a letter which he wrote he spoke of one youthful divine as "a\r\nconceited ass who had preached for forty minutes."  He not only disliked,\r\nbut openly ridiculed all signs of a special pietistic bearing.  It was\r\nsaid of him that he had been heard to swear.  There can be no doubt that\r\nhe made himself wilfully distasteful to many of his stricter brethren.\r\nThen it came to pass that there was a correspondence between him and the\r\nbishop as to that outspoken desire of his for a curate without the grace\r\nof godliness.  But even here Dr. Wortle was successful.  The management of\r\nhis parish was pre-eminently good.  The parish school was a model.  The\r\nfarmers went to church.  Dissenters there were none.  The people of Bowick\r\nbelieved thoroughly in their parson, and knew the comfort of having an\r\nopen-handed, well-to-do gentleman in the village.  This third episcopal\r\ndifficulty did not endure long.  Dr. Wortle knew his man, and was willing\r\nenough to be on good terms with his bishop so long as he was allowed to be\r\nin all things his own master.\r\n\r\nThere had, too, been some fighting between Dr. Wortle and the world about\r\nhis school.  He was, as I have said, a thoroughly generous man, but he\r\nrequired, himself, to be treated with generosity.  Any question as to the\r\ncharges made by him as schoolmaster was unendurable.  He explained to all\r\nparents that he charged for each boy at the rate of two hundred a-year for\r\nboard, lodging, and tuition, and that anything required for a boy\'s\r\nbenefit or comfort beyond that ordinarily supplied would be charged for as\r\nan extra at such price as Dr. Wortle himself thought to be an equivalent.\r\nNow the popularity of his establishment no doubt depended in a great\r\ndegree on the sufficiency and comfort of the good things of the world\r\nwhich he provided.  The beer was of the best; the boys were not made to\r\neat fat; their taste in the selection of joints was consulted.  The\r\nmorning coffee was excellent.  The cook was a great adept at cakes and\r\npuddings.  The Doctor would not himself have been satisfied unless\r\neverything had been plentiful, and everything of the best.  He would have\r\nhated a butcher who had attempted to seduce him with meat beneath the\r\nusual price.  But when he had supplied that which was sufficient according\r\nto his own liberal ideas, he did not give more without charging for it.\r\nAmong his customers there had been a certain Honourable Mr. Stantiloup,\r\nand,--which had been more important,--an Honourable Mrs. Stantiloup.  Mrs.\r\nStantiloup was a lady who liked all the best things which the world could\r\nsupply, but hardly liked paying the best price.  Dr. Wortle\'s school was\r\nthe best thing the world could supply of that kind, but then the price was\r\ncertainly the very best.  Young Stantiloup was only eleven, and as there\r\nwere boys at Bowick as old as seventeen,--for the school had not\r\naltogether maintained its old character as being merely preparatory,--Mrs.\r\nStantiloup had thought that her boy should be admitted at a lower fee.\r\nThe correspondence which had ensued had been unpleasant.  Then young\r\nStantiloup had had the influenza, and Mrs. Stantiloup had sent her own\r\ndoctor.  Champagne had been ordered, and carriage exercise.  Mr.\r\nStantiloup had been forced by his wife to refuse to pay sums demanded for\r\nthese undoubted extras.  Ten shillings a-day for a drive for a little boy\r\nseemed to her a great deal,--seemed so to Mrs. Stantiloup.  Ought not the\r\nDoctor\'s wife to have been proud to take out her little boy in her own\r\ncarriage?  And then \xa32 10_s_. for champagne for the little boy!  It was\r\nmonstrous.  Mr. Stantiloup remonstrated.  Dr. Wortle said that the little\r\nboy had better be taken away and the bill paid at once.  The little boy\r\nwas taken away and the money was offered, short of \xa35.  The matter was\r\ninstantly put into the hands of the Doctor\'s lawyer, and a suit commenced.\r\nThe Doctor, of course, got his money, and then there followed an\r\nacrimonious correspondence in the "Times" and other newspapers.  Mrs.\r\nStantiloup did her best to ruin the school, and many very eloquent\r\npassages were written not only by her or by her own special scribe, but by\r\nothers who took the matter up, to prove that two hundred a-year was a\r\ngreat deal more than ought to be paid for the charge of a little boy\r\nduring three quarters of the year.  But in the course of the next twelve\r\nmonths Dr. Wortle was obliged to refuse admittance to a dozen eligible\r\npupils because he had not room for them.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he had suffered during these contests,--suffered, that is, in\r\nmind.  There had been moments in which it seemed that the victory would be\r\non the other side, that the forces congregated against him were too many\r\nfor him, and that not being able to bend he would have to be broken; but\r\nin every case he had fought it out, and in every case he had conquered.\r\nHe was now a prosperous man, who had achieved his own way, and had made\r\nall those connected with him feel that it was better to like him and obey\r\nhim, than to dislike him and fight with him.  His curates troubled him as\r\nlittle as possible with the grace of godliness, and threw off as far as\r\nthey could that zeal which is so dear to the youthful mind but which so\r\noften seems to be weak and flabby to their elders.  His ushers or\r\nassistants in the school fell in with his views implicitly, and were\r\ncontent to accept compensation in the shape of personal civilities.  It\r\nwas much better to go shares with the Doctor in a joke than to have to\r\nbear his hard words.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly in reference to one of these ushers that our story has to be\r\ntold.  But before we commence it, we must say a few more words as to the\r\nDoctor and his family.  Of his wife I have already spoken.  She was\r\nprobably as happy a woman as you shall be likely to meet on a summer\'s\r\nday.  She had good health, easy temper, pleasant friends, abundant means,\r\nand no ambition.  She went nowhere without the Doctor, and whenever he\r\nwent she enjoyed her share of the respect which was always shown to him.\r\nShe had little or nothing to do with the school, the Doctor having many\r\nyears ago resolved that though it became him as a man to work for his\r\nbread, his wife should not be a slave.  When the battles had been going\r\non,--those between the Doctor and the bishops, and the Doctor and Mrs.\r\nStantiloup, and the Doctor and the newspapers,--she had for a while been\r\nunhappy.  It had grieved her to have it insinuated that her husband was an\r\natheist, and asserted that her husband was a cormorant; but his courage\r\nhad sustained her, and his continual victories had taught her to believe\r\nat last that he was indomitable.\r\n\r\nThey had one child, a daughter, Mary, of whom it was said in Bowick that\r\nshe alone knew the length of the Doctor\'s foot.  It certainly was so that,\r\nif Mrs. Wortle wished to have anything done which was a trifle beyond her\r\nown influence, she employed Mary.  And if the boys collectively wanted to\r\ncarry a point, they would "collectively" obtain Miss Wortle\'s aid.  But\r\nall this the Doctor probably knew very well; and though he was often\r\npleased to grant favours thus asked, he did so because he liked the\r\ngranting of favours when they had been asked with a proper degree of care\r\nand attention.  She was at the present time of the age in which fathers\r\nare apt to look upon their children as still children, while other men\r\nregard them as being grown-up young ladies.  It was now June, and in the\r\napproaching August she would be eighteen.  It was said of her that of the\r\ngirls all round she was the prettiest; and indeed it would be hard to find\r\na sweeter-favoured girl than Mary Wortle.  Her father had been all his\r\nlife a man noted for the manhood of his face.  He had a broad forehead,\r\nwith bright grey eyes,--eyes that had always a smile passing round them,\r\nthough the smile would sometimes show that touch of irony which a smile\r\nmay contain rather than the good-humour which it is ordinarily supposed to\r\nindicate.  His nose was aquiline, not hooky like a true bird\'s-beak, but\r\nwith that bend which seems to give to the human face the clearest\r\nindication of individual will.  His mouth, for a man, was perhaps a little\r\ntoo small, but was admirably formed, as had been the chin with a deep\r\ndimple on it, which had now by the slow progress of many dinners become\r\ndoubled in its folds.  His hair had been chestnut, but dark in its hue.\r\nIt had now become grey, but still with the shade of the chestnut through\r\nit here and there.  He stood five feet ten in height, with small hands and\r\nfeet.  He was now perhaps somewhat stout, but was still as upright on his\r\nhorse as ever, and as well able to ride to hounds for a few fields when by\r\nchance the hunt came in the way of Bowick.  Such was the Doctor.  Mrs.\r\nWortle was a pretty little woman, now over forty years of age, of whom it\r\nwas said that in her day she had been the beauty of Windsor and those\r\nparts.  Mary Wortle took mostly after her father, being tall and comely,\r\nhaving especially her father\'s eyes; but still they who had known Mrs.\r\nWortle as a girl declared that Mary had inherited also her mother\'s\r\npeculiar softness and complexion.\r\n\r\nFor many years past none of the pupils had been received within the\r\nparsonage,--unless when received there as guests, which was of frequent\r\noccurrence.  All belonging to the school was built outside the glebe land,\r\nas a quite separate establishment, with a door opening from the parsonage\r\ngarden to the school-yard.  Of this door the rule was that the Doctor and\r\nthe gardener should have the only two keys; but the rule may be said to\r\nhave become quite obsolete, as the door was never locked.  Sometimes the\r\nbigger boys would come through unasked,--perhaps in search of a game of\r\nlawn-tennis with Miss Wortle, perhaps to ask some favour of Mrs. Wortle,\r\nwho always was delighted to welcome them, perhaps even to seek the Doctor\r\nhimself, who never on such occasions would ask how it came to pass that\r\nthey were on that side of the wall.  Sometimes Mrs. Wortle would send her\r\nhousekeeper through for some of the little boys.  It would then be a good\r\ntime for the little boys.  But this would generally be during the Doctor\'s\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nHere, on the school side of the wall, there was a separate establishment\r\nof servants, and a separate kitchen.  There was no sending backwards or\r\nforwards of food or of clothes,--unless it might be when some special\r\ndelicacy was sent in if a boy were unwell.  For these no extra charge was\r\never made, as had been done in the case of young Stantiloup.  Then a\r\nstrange doctor had come, and had ordered the wine and the carriage.  There\r\nwas no extra charge for the kindly glasses of wine which used to be\r\nadministered in quite sufficient plenty.\r\n\r\nBehind the school, and running down to the little river Pin, there is a\r\nspacious cricket-ground, and a court marked out for lawn-tennis.  Up close\r\nto the school is a racket-court.  No doubt a good deal was done to make\r\nthe externals of the place alluring to those parents who love to think\r\nthat their boys shall be made happy at school.  Attached to the school,\r\nforming part of the building, is a pleasant, well-built residence, with\r\nsix or eight rooms, intended for the senior or classical assistant-master.\r\nIt had been the Doctor\'s scheme to find a married gentleman to occupy this\r\nhouse, whose wife should receive a separate salary for looking after the\r\nlinen and acting as matron to the school,--doing what his wife did till he\r\nbecame successful,--while the husband should be in orders and take part of\r\nthe church duties as a second curate.  But there had been a difficulty in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW USHER.\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor had found it difficult to carry out the scheme described in the\r\nlast chapter.  They indeed who know anything of such matters will be\r\ninclined to call it Utopian, and to say that one so wise in worldly\r\nmatters as our schoolmaster should not have attempted to combine so many\r\nthings.  He wanted a gentleman, a schoolmaster, a curate, a matron, and a\r\nlady,--we may say all in one.  Curates and ushers are generally unmarried.\r\nAn assistant schoolmaster is not often in orders, and sometimes is not a\r\ngentleman.  A gentleman, when he is married, does not often wish to\r\ndispose of the services of his wife.  A lady, when she has a husband, has\r\ngenerally sufficient duties of her own to employ her, without undertaking\r\nothers.  The scheme, if realised, would no doubt be excellent, but the\r\ndifficulties were too many.  The Stantiloups, who lived about twenty miles\r\noff, made fun of the Doctor and his project; and the Bishop was said to\r\nhave expressed himself as afraid that he would not be able to license as\r\ncurate any one selected as usher to the school.  One attempt was made\r\nafter another in vain;--but at last it was declared through the country\r\nfar and wide that the Doctor had succeeded in this, as in every other\r\nenterprise that he had attempted.  There had come a Rev. Mr. Peacocke and\r\nhis wife.  Six years since, Mr. Peacocke had been well known at Oxford as\r\na Classic, and had become a Fellow of Trinity.  Then he had taken orders,\r\nand had some time afterwards married, giving up his Fellowship as a matter\r\nof course.  Mr. Peacocke, while living at Oxford, had been well known to a\r\nlarge Oxford circle, but he had suddenly disappeared from that world, and\r\nit had reached the ears of only a few of his more intimate friends that he\r\nhad undertaken the duties of vice-president of a classical college at\r\nSaint Louis in the State of Missouri.  Such a disruption as this was for a\r\ntime complete; but after five years Mr. Peacocke appeared again at Oxford,\r\nwith a beautiful American wife, and the necessity of earning an income by\r\nhis erudition.\r\n\r\nIt would at first have seemed very improbable that Dr. Wortle should have\r\ntaken into his school or into his parish a gentleman who had chosen the\r\nUnited States as a field for his classical labours.  The Doctor, whose\r\nmind was by no means logical, was a thoroughgoing Tory of the old school,\r\nand therefore considered himself bound to hate the name of a republic.  He\r\nhated rolling stones, and Mr. Peacocke had certainly been a rolling stone.\r\nHe loved Oxford with all his heart, and some years since had been heard to\r\nsay hard things of Mr. Peacocke, when that gentleman deserted his college\r\nfor the sake of establishing himself across the Atlantic.  But he was one\r\nwho thought that there should be a place of penitence allowed to those who\r\nhad clearly repented of their errors; and, moreover, when he heard that\r\nMr. Peacocke was endeavouring to establish himself in Oxford as a "coach"\r\nfor undergraduates, and also that he was a married man without any\r\nencumbrance in the way of family, there seemed to him to be an additional\r\nreason for pardoning that American escapade.  Circumstances brought the\r\ntwo men together.  There were friends at Oxford who knew how anxious the\r\nDoctor was to carry out that plan of his in reference to an usher, a\r\ncurate, and a matron, and here were the very things combined.  Mr.\r\nPeacocke\'s scholarship and power of teaching were acknowledged; he was\r\nalready in orders; and it was declared that Mrs. Peacocke was undoubtedly\r\na lady.  Many inquiries were made.  Many meetings took place.  Many\r\ndifficulties arose.  But at last Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke came to Bowick, and\r\ntook up their abode in the school.\r\n\r\nAll the Doctor\'s requirements were not at once fulfilled.  Mrs. Peacocke\'s\r\nposition was easily settled.  Mrs. Peacocke, who seemed to be a woman\r\npossessed of sterling sense and great activity, undertook her duties\r\nwithout difficulty.  But Mr. Peacocke would not at first consent to act as\r\ncurate in the parish.  He did, however, after a time perform a portion of\r\nthe Sunday services.  When he first came to Bowick he had declared that he\r\nwould undertake no clerical duty.  Education was his profession, and to\r\nthat he meant to devote himself exclusively.  Nor for the six or eight\r\nmonths of his sojourn did he go back from this; so that the Doctor may be\r\nsaid even still to have failed in carrying out his purpose.  But at last\r\nthe new schoolmaster appeared in the pulpit of the parish church and\r\npreached a sermon.\r\n\r\nAll that had passed in private conference between the Doctor and his\r\nassistant on the subject need not here be related.  Mr. Peacocke\'s\r\naversion to do more than attend regularly at the church services as one of\r\nthe parishioners had been very strong.  The Doctor\'s anxiety to overcome\r\nhis assistant\'s reasoning had also been strong.  There had no doubt been\r\nmuch said between them.  Mr. Peacocke had been true to his principles,\r\nwhatever those principles were, in regard to his appointment as a\r\ncurate,--but it came to pass that he for some months preached regularly\r\nevery Sunday in the parish church, to the full satisfaction of the\r\nparishioners.  For this he had accepted no payment, much to the Doctor\'s\r\ndissatisfaction.  Nevertheless, it was certainly the case that they who\r\nserved the Doctor gratuitously never came by the worse of the bargain.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke was a small wiry man, anything but robust in appearance, but\r\nstill capable of great bodily exertion.  He was a great walker.  Labour in\r\nthe school never seemed to fatigue him.  The addition of a sermon to\r\npreach every week seemed to make no difference to his energies in the\r\nschool.  He was a constant reader, and could pass from one kind of mental\r\nwork to another without fatigue.  The Doctor was a noted scholar, but it\r\nsoon became manifest to the Doctor himself, and to the boys, that Mr.\r\nPeacocke was much deeper in scholarship than the Doctor.  Though he was a\r\npoor man, his own small classical library was supposed to be a repository\r\nof all that was known about Latin and Greek.  In fact, Mr. Peacocke grew\r\nto be a marvel; but of all the marvels about him, the thing most\r\nmarvellous was the entire faith which the Doctor placed in him.  Certain\r\nchanges even were made in the old-established "curriculum" of\r\ntuition,--and were made, as all the boys supposed, by the advice of Mr.\r\nPeacocke.  Mr. Peacocke was treated with a personal respect which almost\r\nseemed to imply that the two men were equal.  This was supposed by the\r\nboys to come from the fact that both the Doctor and the assistant had been\r\nFellows of their colleges at Oxford; but the parsons and other gentry\r\naround could see that there was more in it than that.  Mr. Peacocke had\r\nsome power about him which was potent over the Doctor\'s spirit.\r\n\r\nMrs. Peacocke, in her line, succeeded almost as well.  She was a woman\r\nsomething over thirty years of age when she first came to Bowick, in the\r\nvery pride and bloom of woman\'s beauty.  Her complexion was dark and\r\nbrown,--so much so, that it was impossible to describe her colour\r\ngenerally by any other word.  But no clearer skin was ever given to a\r\nwoman.  Her eyes were brown, and her eye-brows black, and perfectly\r\nregular.  Her hair was dark and very glossy, and always dressed as simply\r\nas the nature of a woman\'s head will allow.  Her features were regular,\r\nbut with a great show of strength.  She was tall for a woman, but without\r\nany of that look of length under which female altitude sometimes suffers.\r\nShe was strong and well made, and apparently equal to any labour to which\r\nher position might subject her.  When she had been at Bowick about three\r\nmonths, a boy\'s leg had been broken, and she had nursed him, not only with\r\nassiduity, but with great capacity.  The boy was the youngest son of the\r\nMarchioness of Altamont; and when Lady Altamont paid a second visit to\r\nBowick, for the sake of taking her boy home as soon as he was fit to be\r\nmoved, her ladyship made a little mistake.  With the sweetest and most\r\ncaressing smile in the world, she offered Mrs. Peacocke a ten-pound note.\r\n"My dear madam," said Mrs. Peacocke, without the slightest reserve or\r\ndifficulty, "it is so natural that you should do this, because you cannot\r\nof course understand my position; but it is altogether out of the\r\nquestion."  The Marchioness blushed, and stammered, and begged a hundred\r\npardons.  Being a good-natured woman, she told the whole story to Mrs.\r\nWortle.  "I would just as soon have offered the money to the Marchioness\r\nherself," said Mrs. Wortle, as she told it to her husband.  "I would have\r\ndone it a deal sooner," said the Doctor.  "I am not in the least afraid of\r\nLady Altamont; but I stand in awful dread of Mrs. Peacocke."  Nevertheless\r\nMrs. Peacocke had done her work by the little lord\'s bed-side, just as\r\nthough she had been a paid nurse.\r\n\r\nAnd so she felt herself to be.  Nor was she in the least ashamed of her\r\nposition in that respect.  If there was aught of shame about her, as some\r\npeople said, it certainly did not come from the fact that she was in the\r\nreceipt of a salary for the performance of certain prescribed duties.\r\nSuch remuneration was, she thought, as honourable as the Doctor\'s income;\r\nbut to her American intelligence, the acceptance of a present of money\r\nfrom a Marchioness would have been a degradation.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was said of her by some persons that there must have been\r\nsomething in her former life of which she was ashamed.  The Honourable\r\nMrs. Stantiloup, to whom all the affairs of Bowick had been of consequence\r\nsince her husband had lost his lawsuit, and who had not only heard much,\r\nbut had inquired far and near about Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke, declared\r\ndiligently among her friends, with many nods and winks, that there was\r\nsomething "rotten in the state of Denmark."  She did at first somewhat\r\nimprudently endeavour to spread a rumour abroad that the Doctor had become\r\nenslaved by the lady\'s beauty.  But even those hostile to Bowick could not\r\naccept this.  The Doctor certainly was not the man to put in jeopardy the\r\nrespect of the world and his own standing for the beauty of any woman;\r\nand, moreover, the Doctor, as we have said before, was over fifty years of\r\nage.  But there soon came up another ground on which calumny could found a\r\nstory.  It was certainly the case that Mrs. Peacocke had never accepted\r\nany hospitality from Mrs. Wortle or other ladies in the neighbourhood.  It\r\nreached the ears of Mrs. Stantiloup, first, that the ladies had called\r\nupon each other, as ladies are wont to do who intend to cultivate a mutual\r\npersonal acquaintance, and then that Mrs. Wortle had asked Mrs. Peacocke\r\nto dinner.  But Mrs. Peacocke had refused not only that invitation, but\r\nsubsequent invitations to the less ceremonious form of tea-drinking.\r\n\r\nAll this had been true, and it had been true also,--though of this Mrs.\r\nStantiloup had not heard the particulars,--that Mrs. Peacocke had\r\nexplained to her neighbour that she did not intend to put herself on a\r\nvisiting footing with any one.  "But why not, my dear?" Mrs. Wortle had\r\nsaid, urged to the argument by precepts from her husband.  "Why should you\r\nmake yourself desolate here, when we shall be so glad to have you?"  "It\r\nis part of my life that it must be so," Mrs. Peacocke had answered.  "I am\r\nquite sure that the duties I have undertaken are becoming a lady; but I do\r\nnot think that they are becoming to one who either gives or accepts\r\nentertainments."\r\n\r\nThere had been something of the same kind between the Doctor and Mr.\r\nPeacocke.  "Why the mischief shouldn\'t you and your wife come and eat a\r\nbit of mutton, and drink a glass of wine, over at the Rectory, like any\r\nother decent people?"  I never believed that accusation against the Doctor\r\nin regard to swearing; but he was no doubt addicted to expletives in\r\nconversation, and might perhaps have indulged in a strong word or two, had\r\nhe not been prevented by the sanctity of his orders.  "Perhaps I ought to\r\nsay," replied Mr. Peacocke, "because we are not like any other decent\r\npeople."  Then he went on to explain his meaning.  Decent people, he\r\nthought, in regard to social intercourse, are those who are able to give\r\nand take with ease among each other.  He had fallen into a position in\r\nwhich neither he nor his wife could give anything, and from which, though\r\nsome might be willing to accept him, he would be accepted only, as it\r\nwere, by special favour.  "Bosh!" ejaculated the Doctor.  Mr. Peacocke\r\nsimply smiled.  He said it might be bosh, but that even were he inclined\r\nto relax his own views, his wife would certainly not relax hers.  So it\r\ncame to pass that although the Doctor and Mr. Peacocke were really\r\nintimate, and that something of absolute friendship sprang up between the\r\ntwo ladies, when Mr. Peacocke had already been more than twelve months in\r\nBowick neither had he nor Mrs. Peacocke broken bread in the Doctor\'s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the friendship had become strong.  An incident had happened early\r\nin the year which had served greatly to strengthen it.  At the school\r\nthere was a little boy, just eleven years old, the only son of a Lady De\r\nLawle, who had in early years been a dear friend to Mrs. Wortle.  Lady De\r\nLawle was the widow of a baronet, and the little boy was the heir to a\r\nlarge fortune.  The mother had been most loath to part with her treasure.\r\nFriends, uncles, and trustees had declared that the old prescribed form of\r\neducation for British aristocrats must be followed,--a t\'other school,\r\nnamely, then Eton, and then Oxford.  No; his mother might not go with him,\r\nfirst to one, and then to the other.  Such going and living with him would\r\ndeprive his education of all the real salt.  Therefore Bowick was chosen\r\nas the t\'other school, because Mrs. Wortle would be more like a mother to\r\nthe poor desolate boy than any other lady.  So it was arranged, and the\r\n"poor desolate boy" became the happiest of the young pickles whom it was\r\nMrs. Wortle\'s special province to spoil whenever she could get hold of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that on one beautiful afternoon towards the end of April,\r\nMrs. Wortle had taken young De Lawle and another little boy with her over\r\nthe foot-bridge which passed from the bottom of the parsonage garden to\r\nthe glebe-meadow which ran on the other side of a little river, and with\r\nthem had gone a great Newfoundland dog, who was on terms equally friendly\r\nwith the inmates of the Rectory and the school.  Where this bridge passed\r\nacross the stream the gardens and the field were on the same level.  But\r\nas the water ran down to the ground on which the school-buildings had been\r\nerected, there arose a steep bank over a bend in the river, or, rather,\r\nsteep cliff; for, indeed, it was almost perpendicular, the force of the\r\ncurrent as it turned at this spot having washed away the bank.  In this\r\nway it had come to pass that there was a precipitous fall of about a dozen\r\nfeet from the top of the little cliff into the water, and that the water\r\nhere, as it eddied round the curve, was black and deep, so that the bigger\r\nboys were wont to swim in it, arrangements for bathing having been made on\r\nthe further or school side.  There had sometimes been a question whether a\r\nrail should not be placed for protection along the top of this cliff, but\r\nnothing of the kind had yet been done.  The boys were not supposed to play\r\nin this field, which was on the other side of the river, and could only be\r\nreached by the bridge through the parsonage garden.\r\n\r\nOn this day young De Lawle and his friend and the dog rushed up the hill\r\nbefore Mrs. Wortle, and there began to romp, as was their custom.  Mary\r\nWortle, who was one of the party, followed them, enjoining the children to\r\nkeep away from the cliff.  For a while they did so, but of course\r\nreturned.  Once or twice they were recalled and scolded, always asserting\r\nthat the fault was altogether with Neptune.  It was Neptune that knocked\r\nthem down and always pushed them towards the river.  Perhaps it was\r\nNeptune; but be that as it might, there came a moment very terrible to\r\nthem all.  The dog in one of his gyrations came violently against the\r\nlittle boy, knocked him off his legs, and pushed him over the edge.  Mrs.\r\nWortle, who had been making her way slowly up the hill, saw the fall,\r\nheard the splash, and fell immediately to the ground.\r\n\r\nOther eyes had also seen the accident.  The Doctor and Mr. Peacocke were\r\nat the moment walking together in the playgrounds at the school side of\r\nthe brook.  When the boy fell they had paused in their walk, and were\r\nstanding, the Doctor with his back to the stream, and the assistant with\r\nhis face turned towards the cliff.  A loud exclamation broke from his lips\r\nas he saw the fall, but in a moment,--almost before the Doctor had\r\nrealised the accident which had occurred,--he was in the water, and two\r\nminutes afterwards young De Lawle, drenched indeed, frightened, and out of\r\nbreath, but in nowise seriously hurt, was out upon the bank; and Mr.\r\nPeacocke, drenched also, but equally safe, was standing over him, while\r\nthe Doctor on his knees was satisfying himself that his little charge had\r\nreceived no fatal injury.  It need hardly be explained that such a\r\ntermination as this to such an accident had greatly increased the good\r\nfeeling with which Mr. Peacocke was regarded by all the inhabitants of the\r\nschool and Rectory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY.\r\n\r\nMR. PEACOCKE himself said that in this matter a great deal of fuss was\r\nmade about nothing.  Perhaps it was so.  He got a ducking, but, being a\r\nstrong swimmer, probably suffered no real danger.  The boy, rolling down\r\nthree or four feet of bank, had then fallen down six or eight feet into\r\ndeep water.  He might, no doubt, have been much hurt.  He might have\r\nstruck against a rock and have been killed,--in which case Mr. Peacocke\'s\r\nprowess would have been of no avail.  But nothing of this kind happened.\r\nLittle Jack De Lawle was put to bed in one of the Rectory bed-rooms, and\r\nwas comforted with sherry-negus and sweet jelly.  For two days he rejoiced\r\nthoroughly in his accident, being freed from school, and subjected only to\r\ncaresses.  After that he rebelled, having become tired of his bed.  But by\r\nthat time his mother had been most unnecessarily summoned.  Unless she was\r\nwanted to examine the forlorn condition of his clothes, there was nothing\r\nthat she could do.  But she came, and, of course, showered blessings on\r\nMr. Peacocke\'s head,--while Mrs. Wortle went through to the school and\r\nshowered blessings on Mrs. Peacocke.  What would they have done had the\r\nPeacockes not been there?\r\n\r\n"You must let them have their way, whether for good or bad," the Doctor\r\nsaid, when his assistant complained rather of the blessings,--pointing out\r\nat any rate their absurdity.  "One man is damned for ever, because, in the\r\nconscientious exercise of his authority, he gives a little boy a rap which\r\nhappens to make a small temporary mark on his skin.  Another becomes a\r\nhero because, when in the equally conscientious performance of a duty, he\r\ngives himself a ducking.  I won\'t think you a hero; but, of course, I\r\nconsider myself very fortunate to have had beside me a man younger than\r\nmyself, and quick and ready at such an emergence.  Of course I feel\r\ngrateful, but I shan\'t bother you by telling you so."\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end of it.  Lady De Lawle declared that she could not\r\nbe happy unless Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke would bring Jack home for the\r\nholidays to De Lawle Park.  Of course she carried her blessings up into\r\nMrs. Peacocke\'s little drawing-room, and became quite convinced, as was\r\nMrs. Wortle, that Mrs. Peacocke was in all respects a lady.  She heard of\r\nMr. Peacocke\'s antecedents at Oxford, and expressed her opinion that they\r\nwere charming people.  She could not be happy unless they would promise to\r\ncome to De Lawle Park for the holidays.  Then Mrs. Peacocke had to explain\r\nthat in her present circumstances she did not intend to visit anywhere.\r\nShe was very much flattered, and delighted to think that the dear little\r\nboy was none the worse for his accident; but there must be an end of it.\r\nThere was something in her manner, as she said this, which almost overawed\r\nLady De Lawle.  She made herself, at any rate, understood, and no further\r\nattempt was made for the next six weeks to induce her or Mr. Peacocke to\r\nenter the Rectory dining-room.  But a good deal was said about Mr.\r\nPeacocke,--generally in his favour.\r\n\r\nGenerally in his favour,--because he was a fine scholar, and could swim\r\nwell.  His preaching perhaps did something for him, but the swimming did\r\nmore.  But though there was so much said of good, there was something also\r\nof evil.  A man would not altogether refuse society for himself and his\r\nwife unless there were some cause for him to do so.  He and she must have\r\nknown themselves to be unfit to associate with such persons as they would\r\nhave met at De Lawle Park.  There was a mystery, and the mystery, when\r\nunravelled, would no doubt prove to be very deleterious to the character\r\nof the persons concerned.  Mrs. Stantiloup was quite sure that such must\r\nbe the case.  "It might be very well," said Mrs. Stantiloup, "for Dr.\r\nWortle to obtain the services of a well-educated usher for his school, but\r\nit became quite another thing when he put a man up to preach in the\r\nchurch, of whose life, for five years, no one knew anything."  Somebody\r\nhad told her something as to the necessity of a bishop\'s authority for the\r\nappointment of a curate; but no one had strictly defined to her what a\r\ncurate is.  She was, however, quite ready to declare that Mr. Peacocke had\r\nno business to preach in that pulpit, and that something very disagreeable\r\nwould come of it.\r\n\r\nNor was this feeling altogether confined to Mrs. Stantiloup, though it had\r\nperhaps originated with what she had said among her own friends.  "Don\'t\r\nyou think it well you should know something of his life during these five\r\nyears?"  This had been said to the Rector by the Bishop himself,--who\r\nprobably would have said nothing of the kind had not these reports reached\r\nhis ears.  But reports, when they reach a certain magnitude, and attain a\r\ncertain importance, require to be noticed.\r\n\r\nSo much in this world depends upon character that attention has to be paid\r\nto bad character even when it is not deserved.  In dealing with men and\r\nwomen, we have to consider what they believe, as well as what we believe\r\nourselves.  The utility of a sermon depends much on the idea that the\r\naudience has of the piety of the man who preaches it.  Though the words of\r\nGod should never have come with greater power from the mouth of man, they\r\nwill come in vain if they be uttered by one who is known as a breaker of\r\nthe Commandments;--they will come in vain from the mouth of one who is\r\neven suspected to be so.  To all this, when it was said to him by the\r\nBishop in the kindest manner, Dr. Wortle replied that such suspicions were\r\nmonstrous, unreasonable, and uncharitable.  He declared that they\r\noriginated with that abominable virago, Mrs. Stantiloup.  "Look round the\r\ndiocese," said the Bishop in reply to this, "and see if you can find a\r\nsingle clergyman acting in it, of the details of whose life for the last\r\nfive years you know absolutely nothing."  Thereupon the Doctor said that he\r\nwould make inquiry of Mr. Peacocke himself.  It might well be, he thought,\r\nthat Mr. Peacocke would not like such inquiry, but the Doctor was quite\r\nsure that any story told to him would be true.  On returning home he found\r\nit necessary, or at any rate expedient, to postpone his questions for a\r\nfew days.  It is not easy to ask a man what he has been doing with five\r\nyears of his life, when the question implies a belief that these five\r\nyears have been passed badly.  And it was understood that the questioning\r\nmust in some sort apply to the man\'s wife.  The Doctor had once said to\r\nMrs. Wortle that he stood in awe of Mrs. Peacocke.  There had certainly\r\ncome upon him an idea that she was a lady with whom it would not be easy\r\nto meddle.  She was obedient, diligent, and minutely attentive to any wish\r\nthat was expressed to her in regard to her duties; but it had become\r\nmanifest to the Doctor that in all matters beyond the school she was\r\nindependent, and was by no means subject to external influences.  She was\r\nnot, for instance, very constant in her own attendance at church, and\r\nnever seemed to feel it necessary to apologise for her absence.  The\r\nDoctor, in his many and familiar conversations with Mr. Peacocke, had not\r\nfound himself able to allude to this; and he had observed that the husband\r\ndid not often speak of his own wife unless it were on matters having\r\nreference to the school.  So it came to pass that he dreaded the\r\nconversation which he proposed to himself, and postponed it from day to\r\nday with a cowardice which was quite unusual to him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, O kind-hearted reader, I feel myself constrained, in the telling\r\nof this little story, to depart altogether from those principles of\r\nstory-telling to which you probably have become accustomed, and to put the\r\nhorse of my romance before the cart.  There is a mystery respecting Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Peacocke which, according to all laws recognised in such matters,\r\nought not to be elucidated till, let us say, the last chapter but two, so\r\nthat your interest should be maintained almost to the end,--so near the\r\nend that there should be left only space for those little arrangements\r\nwhich are necessary for the well-being, or perhaps for the evil-being, of\r\nour personages.  It is my purpose to disclose the mystery at once, and to\r\nask you to look for your interest,--should you choose to go on with my\r\nchronicle,--simply in the conduct of my persons, during this disclosure,\r\nto others.  You are to know it all before the Doctor or the\r\nBishop,--before Mrs. Wortle or the Hon. Mrs. Stantiloup, or Lady De Lawle.\r\nYou are to know it all before the Peacockes become aware that it must\r\nnecessarily be disclosed to any one.  It may be that when I shall have\r\nonce told the mystery there will no longer be any room for interest in the\r\ntale to you.  That there are many such readers of novels I know.  I doubt\r\nwhether the greater number be not such.  I am far from saying that the\r\nkind of interest of which I am speaking,--and of which I intend to deprive\r\nmyself,--is not the most natural and the most efficacious.  What would the\r\n\'Black Dwarf\' be if every one knew from the beginning that he was a rich\r\nman and a baronet?--or \'The Pirate,\' if all the truth about Norna of the\r\nFitful-head had been told in the first chapter?  Therefore, put the book\r\ndown if the revelation of some future secret be necessary for your\r\nenjoyment.  Our mystery is going to be revealed in the next paragraph,--in\r\nthe next half-dozen words.  Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke were not man and wife.\r\n\r\nThe story how it came to be so need not be very long;--nor will it, as I\r\nthink, entail any great degree of odious criminality either upon the man\r\nor upon the woman.  At St. Louis Mrs. Peacocke had become acquainted with\r\ntwo brothers named Lefroy, who had come up from Louisiana, and had\r\nachieved for themselves characters which were by no means desirable.  They\r\nwere sons of a planter who had been rich in extent of acres and number of\r\nslaves before the war of the Secession.  General Lefroy had been in those\r\ndays a great man in his State, had held command during the war, and had\r\nbeen utterly ruined.  When the war was over the two boys,--then seventeen\r\nand sixteen years of age,--were old enough to remember and to regret all\r\nthat they had lost, to hate the idea of Abolition, and to feel that the\r\nworld had nothing left for them but what was to be got by opposition to\r\nthe laws of the Union, which was now hateful to them.  They were both\r\nhandsome, and, in spite of the sufferings of their State, an attempt had\r\nbeen made to educate them like gentlemen.  But no career of honour had\r\nbeen open to them, and they had fallen by degrees into dishonour,\r\ndishonesty, and brigandage.\r\n\r\nThe elder of these, when he was still little more than a stripling, had\r\nmarried Ella Beaufort, the daughter of another ruined planter in his\r\nState.  She had been only sixteen when her father died, and not seventeen\r\nwhen she married Ferdinand Lefroy.  It was she who afterwards came to\r\nEngland under the name of Mrs. Peacocke.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke was Vice-President of the College at Missouri when he first\r\nsaw her, and when he first became acquainted with the two brothers, each\r\nof whom was called Colonel Lefroy.  Then there arose a great scandal in\r\nthe city as to the treatment which the wife received from her husband.  He\r\nwas about to go away South, into Mexico, with the view of pushing his\r\nfortune there with certain desperadoes, who were maintaining a perpetual\r\nwar against the authorities of the United States on the borders of Texas,\r\nand he demanded that his wife should accompany him.  This she refused to\r\ndo, and violence was used to force her.  Then it came to pass that certain\r\npersons in St. Louis interfered on her behalf, and among these was the\r\nReverend Mr. Peacocke, the Vice-President of the College, upon whose\r\nfeelings the singular beauty and dignified demeanour of the woman, no\r\ndoubt, had had much effect.  The man failed to be powerful over his wife,\r\nand then the two brothers went away together.  The woman was left to\r\nprovide for herself, and Mr. Peacocke was generous in the aid he gave to\r\nher in doing so.\r\n\r\nIt may be understood that in this way an intimacy was created, but it must\r\nnot be understood that the intimacy was of such a nature as to be\r\ninjurious to the fair fame of the lady.  Things went on in this way for\r\ntwo years, during which Mrs. Lefroy\'s conduct drew down upon her\r\nreproaches from no one.  Then there came tidings that Colonel Lefroy had\r\nperished in making one of those raids in which the two brothers were\r\ncontinually concerned.  But which Colonel Lefroy had perished?  If it were\r\nthe younger brother, that would be nothing to Mr. Peacocke.  If it were\r\nthe elder, it would be everything.  If Ferdinand Lefroy were dead, he\r\nwould not scruple at once to ask the woman to be his wife.  That which the\r\nman had done, and that which he had not done, had been of such a nature as\r\nto solve all bonds of affection.  She had already allowed herself to speak\r\nof the man as one whose life was a blight upon her own; and though there\r\nhad been no word of out-spoken love from her lips to his ears, he thought\r\nthat he might succeed if it could be made certain that Ferdinand Lefroy\r\nwas no longer among the living.\r\n\r\n"I shall never know," she said in her misery.  "What I do hear I shall\r\nnever believe.  How can one know anything as to what happens in a country\r\nsuch as that?"\r\n\r\nThen he took up his hat and staff, and, vice-president, professor, and\r\nclergyman as he was, started off for the Mexican border.  He did tell her\r\nthat he was going, but barely told her.  "It\'s a thing that ought to be\r\nfound out," he said, "and I want a turn of travelling.  I shall be away\r\nthree months."  She merely bade God bless him, but said not a word to\r\nhinder or to encourage his going.\r\n\r\nHe was gone just the three months which he had himself named, and then\r\nreturned elate with his news.  He had seen the younger brother, Robert\r\nLefroy, and had learnt from him that the elder Ferdinand had certainly\r\nbeen killed.  Robert had been most ungracious to him, having even on one\r\noccasion threatened his life; but there had been no doubt that he, Robert,\r\nwas alive, and that Ferdinand had been killed by a party of United States\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThen the clergyman had his reward, and was accepted by the widow with a\r\nfull and happy heart.  Not only had her release been complete, but so was\r\nher present joy; and nothing seemed wanting to their happiness during the\r\nsix first months after their union.  Then one day, all of a sudden,\r\nFerdinand Lefroy was standing within her little drawing-room at the\r\nCollege of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nDead?  Certainly he was not dead!  He did not believe that any one had\r\nsaid that he was dead!  She might be lying or not,--he did not care; he,\r\nPeacocke, certainly had lied;--so said the Colonel.  He did not believe\r\nthat Peacocke had ever seen his brother Robert.  Robert was dead,--must\r\nhave been dead, indeed, before the date given for that interview.  The\r\nwoman was a bigamist,--that is, if any second marriage had ever been\r\nperpetrated.  Probably both had wilfully agreed to the falsehood.  For\r\nhimself he should resolve at once what steps he meant to take.  Then he\r\ndeparted, it being at that moment after nine in the evening.  In the\r\nmorning he was gone again, and from that moment they had never either\r\nheard of him or seen him.\r\n\r\nHow was it to be with them?  They could have almost brought themselves to\r\nthink it a dream, were it not that others besides themselves had seen the\r\nman, and known that Colonel Ferdinand Lefroy had been in St. Louis.  Then\r\nthere came to him an idea that even she might disbelieve the words which\r\nhe had spoken;--that even she might think his story to have been false.\r\nBut to this she soon put an end.  "Dearest," she said, "I never knew a\r\nword that was true to come from his mouth, or a word that was false from\r\nyours."\r\n\r\nShould they part?  There is no one who reads this but will say that they\r\nshould have parted.  Every day passed together as man and wife must be a\r\nfalsehood and a sin.  There would be absolute misery for both in\r\nparting;--but there is no law from God or man entitling a man to escape\r\nfrom misery at the expense of falsehood and sin.  Though their hearts\r\nmight have burst in the doing of it, they should have parted.  Though she\r\nwould have been friendless, alone, and utterly despicable in the eyes of\r\nthe world, abandoning the name which she cherished, as not her own, and\r\ngoing back to that which she utterly abhorred, still she should have done\r\nit.  And he, resolving, as no doubt he would have done under any\r\ncircumstances, that he must quit the city of his adoption,--he should have\r\nleft her with such material sustenance as her spirit would have enabled\r\nher to accept, should have gone his widowed way, and endured as best he\r\nmight the idea that he had left the woman whom he loved behind, in the\r\ndesert, all alone!  That he had not done so the reader is aware.  That he\r\nhad lived a life of sin,--that he and she had continued in one great\r\nfalsehood,--is manifest enough.  Mrs. Stantiloup, when she hears it all,\r\nwill have her triumph.  Lady De Lawle\'s soft heart will rejoice because\r\nthat invitation was not accepted.  The Bishop will be unutterably shocked;\r\nbut, perhaps, to the good man there will be some solace in the feeling\r\nthat he had been right in his surmises.  How the Doctor bore it this story\r\nis intended to tell,--and how also Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke bore it, when the\r\nsin and the falsehood were made known to all the world around them.  The\r\nmystery has at any rate been told, and they who feel that on this account\r\nall hope of interest is at an end had better put down the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR ASKS HIS QUESTION.\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor, instigated by the Bishop, had determined to ask some questions\r\nof Mr. Peacocke as to his American life.  The promise had been given at\r\nthe Palace, and the Doctor, as he returned home, repented himself in that\r\nhe had made it.  His lordship was a gossip, as bad as an old woman, as bad\r\nas Mrs. Stantiloup, and wanted to know things in which a man should feel\r\nno interest.  So said the Doctor to himself.  What was it to him, the\r\nBishop, or to him, the Doctor, what Mr. Peacocke had been doing in\r\nAmerica?  The man\'s scholarship was patent, his morals were unexceptional,\r\nhis capacity for preaching undoubted, his peculiar fitness for his place\r\nat Bowick unquestionable.  Who had a right to know more?  That the man had\r\nbeen properly educated at Oxford, and properly ordained on entering his\r\nFellowship, was doubted by no man.  Even if there had been some temporary\r\nbackslidings in America,--which might be possible, for which of us have\r\nnot backslided at some time of our life?--why should they be raked up?\r\nThere was an uncharitableness in such a proceeding altogether opposed to\r\nthe Doctor\'s view of life.  He hated severity.  It may almost be said that\r\nhe hated that state of perfection which would require no pardon.  He was\r\nthoroughly human, quite content with his own present position,\r\nanticipating no millennium for the future of the world, and probably, in\r\nhis heart, looking forward to heaven as simply the better alternative when\r\nthe happiness of this world should be at an end.  He himself was in no\r\nrespect a wicked man, and yet a little wickedness was not distasteful to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd he was angry with himself in that he had made such a promise.  It had\r\nbeen a rule of life with him never to take advice.  The Bishop had his\r\npowers, within which he, as Rector of Bowick, would certainly obey the\r\nBishop; but it had been his theory to oppose his Bishop, almost more\r\nreadily than any one else, should the Bishop attempt to exceed his power.\r\nThe Bishop had done so in giving this advice, and yet he had promised.  He\r\nwas angry with himself, but did not on that account think that the promise\r\nshould be evaded.  Oh no!  Having said that he would do it, he would do\r\nit.  And having said that he would do it, the sooner that he did it the\r\nbetter.  When three or four days had passed by, he despised himself\r\nbecause he had not yet made for himself a fit occasion.  "It is such a\r\nmean, sneaking thing to do," he said to himself.  But still it had to be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Saturday afternoon that he said this to himself, as he\r\nreturned back to the parsonage garden from the cricket-ground, where he\r\nhad left Mr. Peacocke and the three other ushers playing cricket with ten\r\nor twelve of the bigger boys of the school.  There was a French master, a\r\nGerman master, a master for arithmetic and mathematics with the adjacent\r\nsciences, besides Mr. Peacocke, as assistant classical master.  Among them\r\nMr. Peacocke was _facile princeps_ in rank and supposed ability; but they\r\nwere all admitted to the delights of the playground.  Mr. Peacocke, in\r\nspite of those years of his spent in America where cricket could not have\r\nbeen familiar to him, remembered well his old pastime, and was quite an\r\nadept at the game.  It was ten thousand pities that a man should be\r\ndisturbed by unnecessary questionings who could not only teach and preach,\r\nbut play cricket also.  But nevertheless it must be done.  When,\r\ntherefore, the Doctor entered his own house, he went into his study and\r\nwrote a short note to his assistant;--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR PEACOCKE,--Could you come over and see me in my study this\r\nevening for half an hour?  I have a question or two which I wish to ask\r\nyou.  Any hour you may name will suit me after eight.--Yours most\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to this there came a note to say that at half-past eight Mr.\r\nPeacocke would be with the Doctor.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight Mr. Peacocke came.  He had fancied, on reading the\r\nDoctor\'s note, that some further question would be raised as to money.\r\nThe Doctor had declared that he could no longer accept gratuitous clerical\r\nservice in the parish, and had said that he must look out for some one\r\nelse if Mr. Peacocke could not oblige him by allowing his name to be\r\nreferred in the usual way to the Bishop.  He had now determined to say, in\r\nanswer to this, that the school gave him enough to do, and that he would\r\nmuch prefer to give up the church;--although he would always be happy to\r\ntake a part occasionally if he should be wanted.  The Doctor had been\r\nsitting alone for the last quarter of an hour when his assistant entered\r\nthe room, and had spent the time in endeavouring to arrange the\r\nconversation that should follow.  He had come at last to a conclusion.  He\r\nwould let Mr. Peacocke know exactly what had passed between himself and\r\nthe Bishop, and would then leave it to his usher either to tell his own\r\nstory as to his past life, or to abstain from telling it.  He had promised\r\nto ask the question, and he would ask it; but he would let the man judge\r\nfor himself whether any answer ought to be given.\r\n\r\n"The Bishop has been bothering me about you, Peacocke," he said, standing\r\nup with his back to the fireplace, as soon as the other man had shut the\r\ndoor behind him.  The Doctor\'s face was always expressive of his inward\r\nfeelings, and at this moment showed very plainly that his sympathies were\r\nnot with the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry that his lordship should have troubled himself," said the\r\nother, "as I certainly do not intend to take any part in his diocese."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll sink that for the present," said the Doctor.  "I won\'t let that be\r\nmixed up with what I have got to say just now.  You have taken a certain\r\npart in the diocese already, very much to my satisfaction.  I hope it may\r\nbe continued; but I won\'t bother about that now.  As far as I can see, you\r\nare just the man that would suit me as a colleague in the parish."  Mr.\r\nPeacocke bowed, but remained silent.  "The fact is," continued the Doctor,\r\n"that certain old women have got hold of the Bishop, and made him feel\r\nthat he ought to answer their objections.  That Mrs. Stantiloup has a\r\ntongue as loud as the town-crier\'s bell."\r\n\r\n"But what has Mrs. Stantiloup to say about me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, except in so far as she can hit me through you."\r\n\r\n"And what does the Bishop say?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks that I ought to know something of your life during those five\r\nyears you were in America."\r\n\r\n"I think so also," said Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to know anything for myself.  As far as I am concerned, I am\r\nquite satisfied.  I know where you were educated, how you were ordained,\r\nand I can feel sure, from your present efficiency, that you cannot have\r\nwasted your time.  If you tell me that you do not wish to say anything, I\r\nshall be contented, and I shall tell the Bishop that, as far as I am\r\nconcerned, there must be an end of it."\r\n\r\n"And what will he do?" asked Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"Well; as far as the curacy is concerned, of course he can refuse his\r\nlicence."\r\n\r\n"I have not the slightest intention of applying to his lordship for a\r\nlicence."\r\n\r\nThis the usher said with a tone of self-assertion which grated a little on\r\nthe Doctor\'s ear, in spite of his good-humour towards the speaker.  "I\r\ndon\'t want to go into that," he said.  "A man never can say what his\r\nintentions may be six months hence."\r\n\r\n"But if I were to refuse to speak of my life in America," said Mr.\r\nPeacocke, "and thus to decline to comply with what I must confess would be\r\nno more than a rational requirement on your part, how then would it be\r\nwith myself and my wife in regard to the school?"\r\n\r\n"It would make no difference whatever," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"There is a story to tell," said Mr. Peacocke, very slowly.\r\n\r\n"I am sure that it cannot be to your disgrace."\r\n\r\n"I do not say that it is,--nor do I say that it is not.  There may be\r\ncircumstances in which a man may hardly know whether he has done right or\r\nwrong.  But this I do know,--that, had I done otherwise, I should have\r\ndespised myself.  I could not have done otherwise and have lived."\r\n\r\n"There is no man in the world," said the Doctor, earnestly, "less anxious\r\nto pry into the secrets of others than I am.  I take things as I find\r\nthem.  If the cook sends me up a good dish I don\'t care to know how she\r\nmade it.  If I read a good book, I am not the less gratified because there\r\nmay have been something amiss with the author."\r\n\r\n"You would doubt his teaching," said Mr. Peacocke, "who had gone astray\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Then I must doubt all human teaching, for all men have gone astray.  You\r\nhad better hold your tongue about the past, and let me tell those who ask\r\nunnecessary questions to mind their own business."\r\n\r\n"It is very odd, Doctor," said Mr. Peacocke, "that all this should have\r\ncome from you just now."\r\n\r\n"Why odd just now?"\r\n\r\n"Because I had been turning it in my mind for the last fortnight whether I\r\nought not to ask you as a favour to listen to the story of my life.  That\r\nI must do so before I could formally accept the curacy I had determined.\r\nBut that only brought me to the resolution of refusing the office.  I\r\nthink,--I think that, irrespective of the curacy, it ought to be told.\r\nBut I have not quite made up my mind."\r\n\r\n"Do not suppose that I am pressing you."\r\n\r\n"Oh no; nor would your pressing me influence me.  Much as I owe to your\r\nundeserved kindness and forbearance, I am bound to say that.  Nothing can\r\ninfluence me in the least in such a matter but the well-being of my wife,\r\nand my own sense of duty.  And it is a matter in which I can unfortunately\r\ntake counsel from no one.  She, and she alone, besides myself, knows the\r\ncircumstances, and she is so forgetful of herself that I can hardly ask\r\nher for an opinion."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor by this time had no doubt become curious.  There was a\r\nsomething mysterious with which he would like to become acquainted.  He\r\nwas by no means a philosopher, superior to the ordinary curiosity of\r\nmankind.  But he was manly, and even at this moment remembered his former\r\nassurances.  "Of course," said he, "I cannot in the least guess what all\r\nthis is about.  For myself I hate secrets.  I haven\'t a secret in the\r\nworld.  I know nothing of myself which you mightn\'t know too for all that\r\nI cared.  But that is my good fortune rather than my merit.  It might well\r\nhave been with me as it is with you; but, as a rule, I think that where\r\nthere is a secret it had better be kept.  No one, at any rate, should\r\nallow it to be wormed out of him by the impertinent assiduity of others.\r\nIf there be anything affecting your wife which you do not wish all the\r\nworld on this side of the water to know, do not tell it to any one on this\r\nside of the water."\r\n\r\n"There is something affecting my wife that I do not wish all the world to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Then tell it to no one," said Dr. Wortle, authoritatively.\r\n\r\n"I will tell you what I will do," said Mr. Peacocke; "I will take a week\r\nto think of it, and then I will let you know whether I will tell it or\r\nwhether I will not; and if I tell it I will let you know also how far I\r\nshall expect you to keep my secret, and how far to reveal it.  I think the\r\nBishop will be entitled to know nothing about me unless I ask to be\r\nrecognised as one of the clergy of his diocese."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not; certainly not," said the Doctor.  And then the interview\r\nwas at an end.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke, when he went away from the Rectory, did not at once return\r\nto his own house, but went off for a walk alone.  It was now nearly\r\nmidsummer, and there was broad daylight till ten o\'clock.  It was after\r\nnine when he left the Doctor\'s, but still there was time for a walk which\r\nhe knew well through the fields, which would take him round by Bowick\r\nWood, and home by a path across the squire\'s park and by the church.  An\r\nhour would do it, and he wanted an hour to collect his thoughts before he\r\nshould see his wife, and discuss with her, as he would be bound to do, all\r\nthat had passed between him and the Doctor.  He had said that he could not\r\nask her advice.  In this there had been much of truth.  But he knew also\r\nthat he would do nothing as to which he had not received at any rate her\r\nassent.  She, for his sake, would have annihilated herself, had that been\r\npossible.  Again and again, since that horrible apparition had showed\r\nitself in her room at St. Louis, she had begged that she might leave\r\nhim,--not on her own behalf, not from any dread of the crime that she was\r\ncommitting, not from shame in regard to herself should her secret be found\r\nout, but because she felt herself to be an impediment to his career in the\r\nworld.  As to herself, she had no pricks of conscience.  She had been true\r\nto the man,--brutal, abominable as he had been to her,--until she had in\r\ntruth been made to believe that he was dead; and even when he had\r\ncertainly been alive,--for she had seen him,--he had only again seen her,\r\nagain to desert her.  Duty to him she could owe never.  There was no sting\r\nof conscience with her in that direction.  But to the other man she owed,\r\nas she thought, everything that could be due from a woman to a man.  He\r\nhad come within her ken, and had loved her without speaking of his love.\r\nHe had seen her condition, and had sympathised with her fully.  He had\r\ngone out, with his life in his hand,--he, a clergyman, a quiet man of\r\nletters,--to ascertain whether she was free; and finding her, as he\r\nbelieved, to be free, he had returned to take her to his heart, and to\r\ngive her all that happiness which other women enjoy, but which she had\r\nhitherto only seen from a distance.  Then the blow had come.  It was\r\nnecessary, it was natural, that she should be ruined by such a blow.\r\nCircumstances had ruined her.  That fate had betaken her which so often\r\nfalls upon a woman who trusts herself and her life to a man.  But why\r\nshould he fall also with her fall?  There was still a career before him.\r\nHe might be useful; he might be successful; he might be admired.\r\nEverything might still be open to him,--except the love of another woman.\r\nAs to that, she did not doubt his truth.  Why should he be doomed to drag\r\nher with him as a log tied to his foot, seeing that a woman with a\r\nmisfortune is condemned by the general voice of the world, whereas for a\r\nman to have stumbled is considered hardly more than a matter of course?\r\nShe would consent to take from him the means of buying her bread; but it\r\nwould be better,--she had said,--that she should eat it on her side of the\r\nwater, while he might earn it on the other.\r\n\r\nWe know what had come of these arguments.  He had hitherto never left her\r\nfor a moment since that man had again appeared before their eyes.  He had\r\nbeen strong in his resolution.  If it were a crime, then he would be a\r\ncriminal.  If it were a falsehood, then would he be a liar.  As to the\r\nsin, there had no doubt been some divergence of opinion between him and\r\nher.  The teaching that he had undergone in his youth had been that with\r\nwhich we, here, are all more or less acquainted, and that had been\r\nstrengthened in him by the fact of his having become a clergyman.  She had\r\nfelt herself more at liberty to proclaim to herself a gospel of her own\r\nfor the guidance of her own soul.  To herself she had never seemed to be\r\nvicious or impure, but she understood well that he was not equally free\r\nfrom the bonds which religion had imposed upon him.  For his sake,--for\r\nhis sake, it would be better that she should be away from him.\r\n\r\nAll this was known to him accurately, and all this had to be considered by\r\nhim as he walked across the squire\'s park in the gloaming of the evening.\r\nNo doubt,--he now said to himself,--the Doctor should have been made\r\nacquainted with his condition before he or she had taken their place at\r\nthe school.  Reticence under such circumstances had been a lie.  Against\r\nhis conscience there had been many pricks.  Living in his present\r\ncondition he certainly should not have gone up into that pulpit to preach\r\nthe Word of God.  Though he had been silent, he had known that the evil\r\nand the deceit would work round upon him.  But now what should he do?\r\nThere was only one thing on which he was altogether decided;--nothing\r\nshould separate them.  As he had said so often before, he said again\r\nnow,--"If there be sin, let it be sin."  But this was clear to him,--were\r\nhe to give Dr. Wortle a true history of what had happened to him in\r\nAmerica, then must he certainly leave Bowick.  And this was equally\r\ncertain, that before telling his tale, he must make known his purpose to\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nBut as he entered his own house he had determined that he would tell the\r\nDoctor everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n"THEN WE MUST GO."\r\n\r\n"I THOUGHT you were never going to have done with that old Jupiter," said\r\nMrs. Peacocke, as she began at that late hour of the evening to make tea\r\nfor herself and her husband.\r\n\r\n"Why have you waited for me?"\r\n\r\n"Because I like company.  Did you ever know me go to tea without you when\r\nthere was a chance of your coming?  What has Jupiter been talking about\r\nall this time?"\r\n\r\n"Jupiter has not been talking all this time.  Jupiter talked only for half\r\nan hour.  Jupiter is a very good fellow."\r\n\r\n"I always thought so.  Otherwise I should never have consented to have\r\nbeen one of his satellites, or have been contented to see you doing chief\r\nmoon.  But you have been with him an hour and a half."\r\n\r\n"Since I left him I have walked all round by Bowick Lodge.  I had\r\nsomething to think of before I could talk to you,--something to decide\r\nupon, indeed, before I could return to the house."\r\n\r\n"What have you decided?" she asked.  Her voice was altogether changed.\r\nThough she was seated in her chair and had hardly moved, her appearance\r\nand her carriage of herself were changed.  She still held the cup in her\r\nhand which she had been about to fill, but her face was turned towards\r\nhis, and her large brown speaking eyes were fixed upon him.\r\n\r\n"Let me have my tea," he said, "and then I will tell you."  While he\r\ndrank his tea she remained quite quiet, not touching her own, but waiting\r\npatiently till it should suit him to speak.  "Ella," he said, "I must tell\r\nit all to Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"Why, dearest?"  As he did not answer at once, she went on with her\r\nquestion.  "Why now more than before?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, it is not now more than before.  As we have let the before go by, we\r\ncan only do it now."\r\n\r\n"But why at all, dear?  Has the argument, which was strong when we came,\r\nlost any of its force?"\r\n\r\n"It should have had no force.  We should not have taken the man\'s good\r\nthings, and have subjected him to the injury which may come to him by our\r\nbad name."\r\n\r\n"Have we not given him good things in return?"\r\n\r\n"Not the good things which he had a right to expect,--not that\r\nrespectability which is all the world to such an establishment as this."\r\n\r\n"Let me go," she said, rising from her chair and almost shrieking.\r\n\r\n"Nay, Ella, nay; if you and I cannot talk as though we were one flesh,\r\nalmost with one soul between us, as though that which is done by one is\r\ndone by both, whether for weal or woe,--if you and I cannot feel ourselves\r\nto be in a boat together either for swimming or for sinking, then I think\r\nthat no two persons on this earth ever can be bound together after that\r\nfashion.  \'Whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will\r\nlodge.  The Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee\r\nand me."\' Then she rose from her chair, and flinging herself on her knees\r\nat his feet, buried her face in his lap.  "Ella," he said, "the only\r\ninjury you can do me is to speak of leaving me.  And it is an injury which\r\nis surely unnecessary because you cannot carry it beyond words.  Now, if\r\nyou will sit up and listen to me, I will tell you what passed between me\r\nand the Doctor."  Then she raised herself from the ground and took her seat\r\nat the tea-table, and listened patiently as he began his tale.  "They have\r\nbeen talking about us here in the county."\r\n\r\n"Who has found it necessary to talk about one so obscure as I?"\r\n\r\n"What does it matter who they might be?  The Doctor in his kindly\r\nwrath,--for he is very wroth,--mentions this name and the other.  What\r\ndoes it matter?  Obscurity itself becomes mystery, and mystery of course\r\nproduces curiosity.  It was bound to be so.  It is not they who are in\r\nfault, but we.  If you are different from others, of course you will be\r\ninquired into."\r\n\r\n"Am I so different?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--different in not eating the Doctor\'s dinners when they are offered\r\nto you; different in not accepting Lady De Lawle\'s hospitality; different\r\nin contenting yourself simply with your duties and your husband.  Of\r\ncourse we are different.  How could we not be different?  And as we are\r\ndifferent, so of course there will be questions and wonderings, and that\r\nsifting and searching which always at last finds out the facts.  The\r\nBishop says that he knows nothing of my American life."\r\n\r\n"Why should he want to know anything?"\r\n\r\n"Because I have been preaching in one of his churches.  It is\r\nnatural;--natural that the mothers of the boys should want to know\r\nsomething.  The Doctor says that he hates secrets.  So do I."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dearest!"\r\n\r\n"A secret is always accompanied by more or less of fear, and produces more\r\nor less of cowardice.  But it can no more be avoided than a sore on the\r\nflesh or a broken bone.  Who would not go about, with all his affairs such\r\nas the world might know, if it were possible?  But there come gangrenes in\r\nthe heart, or perhaps in the pocket.  Wounds come, undeserved wounds, as\r\nthose did to you, my darling; but wounds which may not be laid bare to all\r\neyes.  Who has a secret because he chooses it?"\r\n\r\n"But the Bishop?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--yes, the Bishop.  The Bishop has told the Doctor to examine me,\r\nand the Doctor has done it.  I give him the credit of saying that the task\r\nhas been most distasteful to him.  I do him the justice of acknowledging\r\nthat he has backed out of the work he had undertaken.  He has asked the\r\nquestion, but has said in the same breath that I need not answer it unless\r\nI like."\r\n\r\n"And you?  You have not answered it yet?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have answered nothing as yet.  But I have, I think, made up my mind\r\nthat the question must be answered."\r\n\r\n"That everything should be told?"\r\n\r\n"Everything,--to him.  My idea is to tell everything to him, and to leave\r\nit to him to decide what should be done.  Should he refuse to repeat the\r\nstory any further, and then bid us go away from Bowick, I should think\r\nthat his conduct had been altogether straightforward and not\r\nuncharitable."\r\n\r\n"And you,--what would you do then?"\r\n\r\n"I should go.  What else?"\r\n\r\n"But whither?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! on that we must decide.  He would be friendly with me.  Though he\r\nmight think it necessary that I should leave Bowick, he would not turn\r\nagainst me violently."\r\n\r\n"He could do nothing."\r\n\r\n"I think he would assist me rather.  He would help me, perhaps, to find\r\nsome place where I might still earn my bread by such skill as I\r\npossess;--where I could do so without dragging in aught of my domestic\r\nlife, as I have been forced to do here."\r\n\r\n"I have been a curse to you," exclaimed the unhappy wife.\r\n\r\n"My dearest blessing," he said.  "That which you call a curse has come\r\nfrom circumstances which are common to both of us.  There need be no more\r\nsaid about it.  That man has been a source of terrible trouble to us.  The\r\ntrouble must be discussed from time to time, but the necessity of enduring\r\nit may be taken for granted."\r\n\r\n"I cannot be a philosopher such as you are," she said.\r\n\r\n"There is no escape from it.  The philosophy is forced upon us.  When an\r\nevil thing is necessary, there remains only the consideration how it may\r\nbe best borne."\r\n\r\n"You must tell him, then?"\r\n\r\n"I think so.  I have a week to consider of it; but I think so.  Though he\r\nis very kind at this moment in giving me the option, and means what he\r\nsays in declaring that I shall remain even though I tell him nothing, yet\r\nhis mind would become uneasy, and he would gradually become discontented.\r\nThink how great is his stake in the school!  How would he feel towards me,\r\nwere its success to be gradually diminished because he kept a master here\r\nof whom people believed some unknown evil?"\r\n\r\n"There has been no sign of any such falling off?"\r\n\r\n"There has been no time for it.  It is only now that people are beginning\r\nto talk.  Had nothing of the kind been said, had this Bishop asked no\r\nquestions, had we been regarded as people simply obscure, to whom no\r\nmystery attached itself, the thing might have gone on; but as it is, I am\r\nbound to tell him the truth."\r\n\r\n"Then we must go?"\r\n\r\n"Probably."\r\n\r\n"At once?"\r\n\r\n"When it has been so decided, the sooner the better.  How could we endure\r\nto remain here when our going shall be desired?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!"\r\n\r\n"We must flit, and again seek some other home.  Though he should keep our\r\nsecret,--and I believe he will if he be asked,--it will be known that\r\nthere is a secret, and a secret of such a nature that its circumstances\r\nhave driven us hence.  If I could get literary work in London, perhaps we\r\nmight live there."\r\n\r\n"But how,--how would you set about it?  The truth is, dearest, that for\r\nwork such as yours you should either have no wife at all, or else a wife\r\nof whom you need not be ashamed to speak the whole truth before the\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"What is the use of it?" he said, rising from his chair as in anger.  "Why\r\ngo back to all that which should be settled between us, as fixed by fate?\r\nEach of us has given to the other all that each has to give, and the\r\npartnership is complete.  As far as that is concerned, I at any rate am\r\ncontented."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my darling!" she exclaimed, throwing her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n"Let there be an end to distinctions and differences, which, between you\r\nand me, can have no effect but to increase our troubles.  You are a woman,\r\nand I am a man; and therefore, no doubt, your name, when brought in\r\nquestion, is more subject to remark than mine,--as is my name, being that\r\nof a clergyman, more subject to remark than that of one not belonging to a\r\nsacred profession.  But not on that account do I wish to unfrock myself;\r\nnor certainly on that account do I wish to be deprived of my wife.  For\r\ngood or bad, it has to be endured together; and expressions of regret as\r\nto that which is unavoidable, only aggravate our trouble."  After that, he\r\nseated himself, and took up a book as though he were able at once to carry\r\noff his mind to other matters.  She probably knew that he could not do so,\r\nbut she sat silent by him for a while, till he bade her take herself to\r\nbed, promising that he would follow without delay.\r\n\r\nFor three days nothing further was said between them on the subject, nor\r\nwas any allusion made to it between the Doctor and his assistant.  The\r\nschool went on the same as ever, and the intercourse between the two men\r\nwas unaltered as to its general mutual courtesy.  But there did\r\nundoubtedly grow in the Doctor\'s mind a certain feverish feeling of\r\ninsecurity.  At any rate, he knew this, that there was a mystery, that\r\nthere was something about the Peacockes,--something referring especially\r\nto Mrs. Peacocke,--which, if generally known, would be held to be\r\ndeleterious to their character.  So much he could not help deducing from\r\nwhat the man had already told him.  No doubt he had undertaken, in his\r\ngenerosity, that although the man should decline to tell his secret, no\r\nalteration should be made as to the school arrangements; but he became\r\nconscious that in so promising he had in some degree jeopardised the\r\nwell-being of the school.  He began to whisper to himself that persons in\r\nsuch a position as that filled by this Mr. Peacocke and his wife should\r\nnot be subject to peculiar remarks from ill-natured tongues.  A weapon was\r\nafforded by such a mystery to the Stantiloups of the world, which the\r\nStantiloups would be sure to use with all their virulence.  To such an\r\nestablishment as his school, respectability was everything.  Credit, he\r\nsaid to himself, is a matter so subtle in its essence, that, as it may be\r\nobtained almost without reason, so, without reason, may it be made to melt\r\naway.  Much as he liked Mr. Peacocke, much as he approved of him, much as\r\nthere was in the man of manliness and worth which was absolutely dear to\r\nhim,--still he was not willing to put the character of his school in peril\r\nfor the sake of Mr. Peacocke.  Were he to do so, he would be neglecting a\r\nduty much more sacred than any he could owe to Mr. Peacocke.  It was thus\r\nthat, during these three days, he conversed with himself on the subject,\r\nalthough he was able to maintain outwardly the same manner and the same\r\ncountenance as though all things were going well between them.  When they\r\nparted after the interview in the study, the Doctor, no doubt, had so\r\nexpressed himself as rather to dissuade his usher from telling his secret\r\nthan to encourage him to do so.  He had been free in declaring that the\r\ntelling of the secret should make no difference in his assistant\'s\r\nposition at Bowick.  But in all that, he had acted from his habitual\r\nimpulse.  He had since told himself that the mystery ought to be\r\ndisclosed.  It was not right that his boys should be left to the charge of\r\none who, however competent, dared not speak of his own antecedents.  It\r\nwas thus he thought of the matter, after consideration.  He must wait, of\r\ncourse, till the week should be over before he made up his mind to\r\nanything further.\r\n\r\n"So Peacocke isn\'t going to take the curacy?"\r\n\r\nThis was said to the Doctor by Mr. Pearson, the squire, in the course of\r\nthose two or three days of which we are speaking.  Mr. Pearson was an old\r\ngentleman, who did not live often at Bowick, being compelled, as he always\r\nsaid, by his health, to spend the winter and spring of every year in\r\nItaly, and the summer months by his family in London.  In truth, he did\r\nnot much care for Bowick, but had always been on good terms with the\r\nDoctor, and had never opposed the school.  Mr. Pearson had been good also\r\nas to Church matters,--as far as goodness can be shown by generosity,--and\r\nhad interested himself about the curates.  So it had come to pass that the\r\nDoctor did not wish to snub his neighbour when the question was asked.  "I\r\nrather think not," said the Doctor.  "I fear I shall have to look out for\r\nsome one else."  He did not prolong the conversation; for, though he wished\r\nto be civil, he did not wish to be communicative.  Mr. Pearson had shown\r\nhis parochial solicitude, and did not trouble himself with further\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n"So Mr. Peacocke isn\'t going to take the curacy?"  This, the very same\r\nquestion in the very same words, was put to the Doctor on the next morning\r\nby the vicar of the next parish.  The Rev. Mr. Puddicombe, a clergyman\r\nwithout a flaw who did his duty excellently in every station of life, was\r\none who would preach a sermon or take a whole service for a brother parson\r\nin distress, and never think of reckoning up that return sermons or return\r\nservices were due to him,--one who gave dinners, too, and had pretty\r\ndaughters;--but still our Doctor did not quite like him.  He was a little\r\ntoo pious, and perhaps given to ask questions.  "So Mr. Peacocke isn\'t\r\ngoing to take the curacy?"\r\n\r\nThere was a certain animation about the asking of this question by Mr.\r\nPuddicombe very different from Mr. Pearson\'s listless manner.  It was\r\nclear to the Doctor that Mr. Puddicombe wanted to know.  It seemed to the\r\nDoctor that something of condemnation was implied in the tone of the\r\nquestion, not only against Mr. Peacocke, but against himself also, for\r\nhaving employed Mr. Peacocke.  "Upon my word I can\'t tell you," he said,\r\nrather crossly.\r\n\r\n"I thought that it had been all settled.  I heard that it was decided."\r\n\r\n"Then you have heard more than I have."\r\n\r\n"It was the Bishop told me."\r\n\r\nNow it certainly was the case that in that fatal conversation which had\r\ninduced the Doctor to interrogate Mr. Peacocke about his past life, the\r\nDoctor himself had said that he intended to look out for another curate.\r\nHe probably did not remember that at the moment.  "I wish the Bishop would\r\nconfine himself to asserting things that he knows," said the Doctor,\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n"I am sure the Bishop intends to do so," said Mr. Puddicombe, very\r\ngravely.  "But I apologise.  I had not intended to touch a subject on\r\nwhich there may perhaps be some reserve.  I was only going to tell you of\r\nan excellent young man of whom I have heard.  But, good morning."  Then Mr.\r\nPuddicombe withdrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nLORD CARSTAIRS.\r\n\r\nDURING the last six months Mr. Peacocke\'s most intimate friend at Bowick,\r\nexcepting of course his wife, had been one of the pupils at the school.\r\nThe lad was one of the pupils, but could not be said to be one of the\r\nboys.  He was the young Lord Carstairs, eldest son of Earl Bracy.  He had\r\nbeen sent to Bowick now six years ago, with the usual purpose of\r\nprogressing from Bowick to Eton.  And from Bowick to Eton he had gone in\r\ndue course.  But there, things had not gone well with the young lord.\r\nSome school disturbance had taken place when he had been there about a\r\nyear and a half, in which he was, or was supposed to have been, a\r\nringleader.  It was thought necessary, for the preservation of the\r\ndiscipline of the school, that a victim should be made;--and it was\r\nperhaps thought well, in order that the impartiality of the school might\r\nbe made manifest, that the victim should be a lord.  Earl Bracy was\r\ntherefore asked to withdraw his son; and young Lord Carstairs, at the age\r\nof seventeen, was left to seek his education where he could.  It had been,\r\nand still was, the Earl\'s purpose to send his son to Oxford, but there was\r\nnow an interval of two years before that could be accomplished.  During\r\none year he was sent abroad to travel with a tutor, and was then reported\r\nto have been all that a well-conducted lad ought to be.  He was declared\r\nto be quite worthy of all that Oxford would do for him.  It was even\r\nsuggested that Eton had done badly for herself in throwing off from her\r\nsuch a young nobleman.  But though Lord Carstairs had done well with his\r\nFrench and German on the Continent, it would certainly be necessary that\r\nhe should rub up his Greek and Latin before he went to Christ Church.\r\nThen a request was made to the Doctor to take him in at Bowick in some\r\nsort as a private pupil.  After some demurring the Doctor consented.  It\r\nwas not his wont to run counter to earls who treated him with respect and\r\ndeference.  Earl Bracy had in a special manner been his friend, and Lord\r\nCarstairs himself had been a great favourite at Bowick.  When that\r\nexpulsion from Eton had come about, the Doctor had interested himself, and\r\nhad declared that a very scant measure of justice had been shown to the\r\nyoung lord.  He was thus in a measure compelled to accede to the request\r\nmade to him, and Lord Carstairs was received back at Bowick, not without\r\nhesitation, but with a full measure of affectionate welcome.  His bed-room\r\nwas in the parsonage-house, and his dinner he took with the Doctor\'s\r\nfamily.  In other respects he lived among the boys.\r\n\r\n"Will it not be bad for Mary?" Mrs. Wortle had said anxiously to her\r\nhusband when the matter was first discussed.\r\n\r\n"Why should it be bad for Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know;--but young people together, you know?  Mightn\'t it be\r\ndangerous?"\r\n\r\n"He is a boy, and she is a mere child.  They are both children.  It will\r\nbe a trouble, but I do not think it will be at all dangerous in that way."\r\nAnd so it was decided.  Mrs. Wortle did not at all agree as to their both\r\nbeing children.  She thought that her girl was far from being a child.\r\nBut she had argued the matter quite as much as she ever argued anything\r\nwith the Doctor.  So the matter was arranged, and young Lord Carstairs\r\ncame back to Bowick.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Doctor could see, nothing could be nicer than his young\r\npupil\'s manners.  He was not at all above playing with the other boys.  He\r\ntook very kindly to his old studies and his old haunts, and of an evening,\r\nafter dinner, went away from the drawing-room to the study in pursuit of\r\nhis Latin and his Greek, without any precocious attempt at making\r\nconversation with Miss Wortle.  No doubt there was a good deal of\r\nlawn-tennis of an afternoon, and the lawn-tennis was generally played in\r\nthe rectory garden.  But then this had ever been the case, and the\r\nlawn-tennis was always played with two on a side; there were no\r\n_t\xeate-\xe0-t\xeate_ games between his lordship and Mary, and whenever the game\r\nwas going on, Mrs. Wortle was always there to see fair-play.  Among other\r\namusements the young lord took to walking far afield with Mr. Peacocke.\r\nAnd then, no doubt, many things were said about that life in America.\r\nWhen a man has been much abroad, and has passed his time there under\r\nunusual circumstances, his doings will necessarily become subjects of\r\nconversation to his companions.  To have travelled in France, Germany, or\r\nin Italy, is not uncommon; nor is it uncommon to have lived a year or\r\nyears in Florence or in Rome.  It is not uncommon now to have travelled\r\nall through the United States.  The Rocky Mountains or Peru are hardly\r\nuncommon, so much has the taste for travelling increased.  But for an\r\nOxford Fellow of a college, and a clergyman of the Church of England, to\r\nhave established himself as a professor in Missouri, is uncommon, and it\r\ncould hardly be but that Lord Carstairs should ask questions respecting\r\nthat far-away life.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke had no objection to such questions.  He told his young friend\r\nmuch about the manners of the people of St. Louis,--told him how far the\r\npeople had progressed in classical literature, in what they fell behind,\r\nand in what they excelled youths of their own age in England, and how far\r\nthe college was a success.  Then he described his own life,--both before\r\nand after his marriage.  He had liked the people of St. Louis well\r\nenough,--but not quite well enough to wish to live among them.  No doubt\r\ntheir habits were very different from those of Englishmen.  He could,\r\nhowever, have been happy enough there,--only that circumstances arose.\r\n\r\n"Did Mrs. Peacocke like the place?" the young lord asked one day.\r\n\r\n"She is an American, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I have heard.  But did she come from St. Louis?"\r\n\r\n"No; her father was a planter in Louisiana, not far from New Orleans,\r\nbefore the abolition of slavery."\r\n\r\n"Did she like St. Louis?"\r\n\r\n"Well enough, I think, when we were first married.  She had been married\r\nbefore, you know.  She was a widow."\r\n\r\n"Did she like coming to England among strangers?"\r\n\r\n"She was glad to leave St. Louis.  Things happened there which made her\r\nlife unhappy.  It was on that account I came here, and gave up a position\r\nhigher and more lucrative than I shall ever now get in England."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought you might have had a school of your own," said the\r\nlad.  "You know so much, and get on so well with boys.  I should have\r\nthought you might have been tutor at a college."\r\n\r\n"To have a school of my own would take money," said he, "which I have not\r\ngot.  To be tutor at a college would take---- But never mind.  I am very\r\nwell where I am, and have nothing to complain of."  He had been going to\r\nsay that to be tutor of a college he would want high standing.  And then\r\nhe would have been forced to explain that he had lost at his own college\r\nthat standing which he had once possessed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said on another occasion, "she is unhappy; but do not ask her\r\nany questions about it."\r\n\r\n"Who,--I?  Oh dear, no!  I should not think of taking such a liberty."\r\n\r\n"It would be as a kindness, not as a liberty.  But still, do not speak to\r\nher about it.  There are sorrows which must be hidden, which it is better\r\nto endeavour to bury by never speaking of them, by not thinking of them,\r\nif that were possible."\r\n\r\n"Is it as bad as that?" the lad asked.\r\n\r\n"It is bad enough sometimes.  But never mind.  You remember that Roman\r\nwisdom,--\'Dabit Deus his quoque finem.\' And I think that all things are\r\nbearable if a man will only make up his mind to bear them.  Do not tell\r\nany one that I have complained."\r\n\r\n"Who,--I?  Oh, never!"\r\n\r\n"Not that I have said anything which all the world might not know; but\r\nthat it is unmanly to complain.  Indeed I do not complain, only I wish\r\nthat things were lighter to her."  Then he went off to other matters; but\r\nhis heart was yearning to tell everything to this young lad.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the week had arrived, there came a letter to him which\r\nhe had not at all expected, and a letter also to the Doctor,--both from\r\nLord Bracy.  The letter to Mr. Peacocke was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR SIR,--I have been much gratified by what I have heard both from\r\nDr. Wortle and my son as to his progress.  He will have to come home in\r\nJuly, when the Doctor\'s school is broken up, and, as you are probably\r\naware, will go up to Oxford in October.  I think it would be very\r\nexpedient that he should not altogether lose the holidays, and I am aware\r\nhow much more he would do with adequate assistance than without it.  The\r\nmeaning of all this is, that I and Lady Bracy will feel very much obliged\r\nif you and Mrs. Peacocke will come and spend your holidays with us at\r\nCarstairs.  I have written to Dr. Wortle on the subject, partly to tell\r\nhim of my proposal, because he has been so kind to my son, and partly to\r\nask him to fix the amount of remuneration, should you be so kind as to\r\naccede to my request.\r\n\r\n"His mother has heard on more than one occasion from her son how very\r\ngood-natured you have been to him.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n"BRACY."\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, quite out of the question.  Mr. Peacocke, as soon as he\r\nhad read the letter, felt that it was so.  Had things been smooth and easy\r\nwith him, nothing would have delighted him more.  His liking for the lad\r\nwas most sincere, and it would have been a real pleasure to him to have\r\nworked with him during the holidays.  But it was quite out of the\r\nquestion.  He must tell Lord Carstairs that it was so, and must at the\r\nmoment give such explanation as might occur to him.  He almost felt that\r\nin giving that explanation he would be tempted to tell his whole story.\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor met him before he had an opportunity of speaking to Lord\r\nCarstairs.  The Doctor met him, and at once produced the Earl\'s letter.\r\n"I have heard from Lord Bracy, and you, I suppose, have had a letter too,"\r\nsaid the Doctor.  His manner was easy and kind, as though no disagreeable\r\ncommunication was due to be made on the following day.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mr. Peacocke.  "I have had a letter."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"His lordship has asked me to go to Carstairs for the holidays; but it is\r\nout of the question."\r\n\r\n"It would do Carstairs all the good in the world," said the Doctor; "and I\r\ndo not see why you should not have a pleasant visit and earn twenty-five\r\npounds at the same time."\r\n\r\n"It is quite out of the question."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you would not like to leave Mrs. Peacocke," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Either to leave her or to take her!  To go myself under any circumstances\r\nwould be altogether out of the question.  I shall come to you to-morrow,\r\nDoctor, as I said I would last Saturday.  What hour will suit you?"  Then\r\nthe Doctor named an hour in the afternoon, and knew that the revelation\r\nwas to be made to him.  He felt, too, that that revelation would lead to\r\nthe final departure of Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke from Bowick, and he was\r\nunhappy in his heart.  Though he was anxious for his school, he was\r\nanxious also for his friend.  There was a gratification in the feeling\r\nthat Lord Bracy thought so much of his assistant,--or would have been but\r\nfor this wretched mystery!\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Peacocke to the lad.  "I regret to say that I cannot go.  I\r\nwill tell you why, perhaps, another time, but not now.  I have written to\r\nyour father by this post, because it is right that he should be told at\r\nonce.  I have been obliged to say that it is impossible."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry!  I should so much have liked it.  My father would have\r\ndone everything to make you comfortable, and so would mamma."  In answer\r\nto all this Mr. Peacocke could only say that it was impossible.  This\r\nhappened on Friday afternoon, Friday being a day on which the school was\r\nalways very busy.  There was no time for the doing of anything special, as\r\nthere would be on the following day, which was a half-holiday.  At night,\r\nwhen the work was altogether over, he showed the letter to his wife, and\r\ntold her what he had decided.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you have gone without me?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"How can I do that," he said, "when before this time to-morrow I shall\r\nhave told everything to Dr. Wortle?  After that, he would not let me go.\r\nHe would do no more than his duty in telling me that if I proposed to go\r\nhe must make it all known to Lord Bracy.  But this is a trifle.  I am at\r\nthe present moment altogether in the dark as to what I shall do with\r\nmyself when to-morrow evening comes.  I cannot guess, because it is so\r\nhard to know what are the feelings in the breast of another man.  It may\r\nso well be that he should refuse me permission to go to my desk in the\r\nschool again."\r\n\r\n"Will he be hard like that?"\r\n\r\n"I can hardly tell myself whether it would be hard.  I hardly know what I\r\nshould feel it my duty to do in such a position myself.  I have deceived\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have deceived him.  Coming to him as I did, I gave him to\r\nunderstand that there was nothing wrong;--nothing to which special\r\nobjection could be made in my position."\r\n\r\n"Then we are deceiving all the world in calling ourselves man and wife."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we are; but to that we had made up our mind!  We are not\r\ninjuring all the world.  No doubt it is a lie,--but there are\r\ncircumstances in which a lie can hardly be a sin.  I would have been the\r\nlast to say so before all this had come upon me, but I feel it to be so\r\nnow.  It is a lie to say that you are my wife."\r\n\r\n"Is it?  Is it?"\r\n\r\n"Is it not?  And yet I would rather cut my tongue out than say otherwise.\r\nTo give you my name is a lie,--but what should I think of myself were I to\r\nallow you to use any other?  What would you have thought if I had asked\r\nyou to go away and leave me when that bad hour came upon us?"\r\n\r\n"I would have borne it."\r\n\r\n"I could not have borne it.  There are worse things than a lie.  I have\r\nfound, since this came upon us, that it may be well to choose one sin in\r\norder that another may be shunned.  To cherish you, to comfort you, to\r\nmake the storm less sharp to you,--that has already been my duty as well\r\nas my pleasure.  To do the same to me is your duty."\r\n\r\n"And my pleasure; and my pleasure,--my only pleasure."\r\n\r\n"We must cling to each other, let the world call us what names it may.\r\nBut there may come a time in which one is called on to do a special act of\r\njustice to others.  It has come now to me.  From the world at large I am\r\nprepared, if possible, to keep my secret, even though I do it by\r\nlying;--but to this one man I am driven to tell it, because I may not\r\nreturn his friendship by doing him an evil."\r\n\r\nMorning school at this time of the year at Bowick began at half-past\r\nseven.  There was an hour of school before breakfast, at which the Doctor\r\ndid not himself put in an appearance.  He was wont to tell the boys that\r\nhe had done all that when he was young, and that now in his old age it\r\nsuited him best to have his breakfast before he began the work of the day.\r\nMr. Peacocke, of course, attended the morning school.  Indeed, as the\r\nmatutinal performances were altogether classical, it was impossible that\r\nmuch should be done without him.  On this Saturday morning, however, he\r\nwas not present; and a few minutes after the proper time, the mathematical\r\nmaster took his place.  "I saw him coming across out of his own door,"\r\nlittle Jack Talbot said to the younger of the two Clifford boys, "and\r\nthere was a man coming up from the gate who met him."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man?" asked Clifford.\r\n\r\n"He was a rummy-looking fellow, with a great beard, and a queer kind of\r\ncoat.  I never saw any one like him before."\r\n\r\n"And where did they go?"\r\n\r\n"They stood talking for a minute or two just before the front door, and\r\nthen Mr. Peacocke took him into the house.  I heard him tell Carstairs to\r\ngo through and send word up to the Doctor that he wouldn\'t be in school\r\nthis morning."\r\n\r\nIt had all happened just as young Talbot had said.  A very "rummy-looking\r\nfellow" had at that early hour been driven over from Broughton to Bowick,\r\nand had caught Mr. Peacocke just as he was going into the school.  He was\r\na man with a beard, loose, flowing on both sides, as though he were winged\r\nlike a bird,--a beard that had been black, but was now streaked through\r\nand through with grey hairs.  The man had a coat with frogged buttons that\r\nmust have been intended to have a military air when it was new, but which\r\nwas now much the worse for wear.  The coat was so odd as to have caught\r\nyoung Talbot\'s attention at once.  And the man\'s hat was old and seedy.\r\nBut there was a look about him as though he were by no means ashamed\r\neither of himself or of his present purpose.  "He came in a gig," said\r\nTalbot to his friend; "for I saw the horse standing at the gate, and the\r\nman sitting in the gig."\r\n\r\n"You remember me, no doubt," the stranger said, when he encountered Mr.\r\nPeacocke.\r\n\r\n"I do not remember you in the least," the schoolmaster answered.\r\n\r\n"Come, come; that won\'t do.  You know me well enough.  I\'m Robert Lefroy."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Peacocke, looking at him again, knew that the man was the brother\r\nof his wife\'s husband.  He had not seen him often, but he recognised him\r\nas Robert Lefroy, and having recognised him he took him into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nROBERT LEFROY.\r\n\r\nFERDINAND LEFROY, the man who had in truth been the woman\'s husband, had,\r\nduring that one interview which had taken place between him and the man\r\nwho had married his wife, on his return to St. Louis, declared that his\r\nbrother Robert was dead.  But so had Robert, when Peacocke encountered him\r\ndown at Texas, declared that Ferdinand was dead.  Peacocke knew that no\r\nword of truth could be expected from the mouths of either of them.  But\r\nseeing is believing.  He had seen Ferdinand alive at St. Louis after his\r\nmarriage, and by seeing him, had been driven away from his home back to\r\nhis old country.  Now he also saw this other man, and was aware that his\r\nsecret was no longer in his own keeping.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know you now.  Why, when I saw you last, did you tell me that your\r\nbrother was dead?  Why did you bring so great an injury on your\r\nsister-in-law?"\r\n\r\n"I never told you anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"As God is above us you told me so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about that, my friend.  Maybe I was cut.  I used to\r\nbe drinking a good deal them days.  Maybe I didn\'t say anything of the\r\nkind,--only it suited you to go back and tell her so.  Anyways I\r\ndisremember it altogether.  Anyways he wasn\'t dead.  And I ain\'t dead\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"I can see that."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t drunk now.  But I am not quite so well off as a fellow would\r\nwish to be.  Can you get me breakfast?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can get you breakfast," he said, after pausing for a while.  Then\r\nhe rang the bell and told the girl to bring some breakfast for the\r\ngentleman as soon as possible into the room in which they were sitting.\r\nThis was in a little library in which he was in the habit of studying and\r\ngoing through lessons with the boys.  He had brought the man here so that\r\nhis wife might not come across him.  As soon as the order was given, he\r\nran up-stairs to her room, to save her from coming down.\r\n\r\n"A man;--what man?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Robert Lefroy.  I must go to him at once.  Bear yourself well and boldly,\r\nmy darling.  It is he, certainly.  I know nothing yet of what he may have\r\nto say, but it will be well that you should avoid him if possible.  When I\r\nhave heard anything I will tell you all."  Then he hurried down and found\r\nthe man examining the book-shelves.\r\n\r\n"You have got yourself up pretty tidy again, Peacocke," said Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well."\r\n\r\n"The old game, I suppose.  Teaching the young idea.  Is this what you call\r\na college, now, in your country?"\r\n\r\n"It is a school."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re one of the masters."\r\n\r\n"I am the second master."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t as good, I reckon, as the Missouri College."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not so large, certainly."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the screw?" he said.\r\n\r\n"The payment, you mean.  It can hardly serve us now to go into matters\r\nsuch as that.  What is it that has brought you here, Lefroy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, a big ship, an uncommonly bad sort of railway car, and the\r\nricketiest little buggy that ever a man trusted his life to.  Them\'s\r\nwhat\'s brought me here."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have something to say, or you would not have come," said\r\nPeacocke.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve a good deal to say of one kind or another.  But here\'s the\r\nbreakfast, and I\'m well-nigh starved.  What, cold meat!  I\'m darned if I\r\ncan eat cold meat.  Haven\'t you got anything hot, my dear?"  Then it was\r\nexplained to him that hot meat was not to be had, unless he would choose\r\nto wait, to have some lengthened cooking accomplished.  To this, however,\r\nhe objected, and then the girl left the room.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a good many things to say of one kind or another," he continued.\r\n"It\'s difficult to say, Peacocke, how you and I stand with each other."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that we stand with each other at all, as you call it."\r\n\r\n"I mean as to relationship.  Are you my brother-in-law, or are you not?"\r\nThis was a question which in very truth the schoolmaster found it hard to\r\nanswer.  He did not answer it at all, but remained silent.  "Are you my\r\nbrother-in-law, or are you not?  You call her Mrs. Peacocke, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I call her Mrs. Peacocke."\r\n\r\n"And she is here living with you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is here."\r\n\r\n"Had she not better come down and see me?  She is my sister-in-law,\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Peacocke; "I think, on the whole, that she had better not\r\ncome down and see you."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say she isn\'t my sister-in-law?  She\'s that, whatever\r\nelse she is.  She\'s that, whatever name she goes by.  If Ferdinand had\r\nbeen ever so much dead, and that marriage at St. Louis had been ever so\r\ngood, still she\'d been my sister-in-law."\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt about it," said Mr. Peacocke.  "But still, under all the\r\ncircumstances, she had better not see you."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a queer beginning, anyway.  But perhaps you\'ll come round\r\nby-and-by.  She goes by Mrs. Peacocke?"\r\n\r\n"She is regarded as my wife," said the husband, feeling himself to become\r\nmore and more indignant at every word, but knowing at the same time how\r\nnecessary it was that he should keep his indignation hidden.\r\n\r\n"Whether true or false?" asked the brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I will answer no such question as that."\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t very well disposed to answer any question, as far as I can see.\r\nBut I shall have to make you answer one or two before I\'ve done with you.\r\nThere\'s a Doctor here, isn\'t there, as this school belongs to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is.  It belongs to Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"It\'s him these boys are sent to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is the master; I am only his assistant."\r\n\r\n"It\'s him they comes to for education, and morals, and religion?"\r\n\r\n"Quite so."\r\n\r\n"And he knows, no doubt, all about you and my sister-in-law;--how you came\r\nand married her when she was another man\'s wife, and took her away when\r\nyou knew as that other man was alive and kicking?"  Mr. Peacocke, when\r\nthese questions were put to him, remained silent, because literally he did\r\nnot know how to answer them.  He was quite prepared to take his position\r\nas he found it.  He had told himself before this dreadful man had\r\nappeared, that the truth must be made known at Bowick, and that he and his\r\nwife must pack up and flit.  It was not that the man could bring upon him\r\nany greater evil than he had anticipated.  But the questions which were\r\nasked him were in themselves so bitter!  The man, no doubt, was his wife\'s\r\nbrother-in-law.  He could not turn him out of the house as he would a\r\nstranger, had a stranger come there asking such questions without any\r\nclaim of family.  Abominable as the man was to him, still he was there\r\nwith a certain amount of right upon his side.\r\n\r\n"I think," said he, "that questions such as those you\'ve asked can be of\r\nno service to you.  To me they are intended only to be injurious."\r\n\r\n"They\'re as a preface to what is to come," said Robert Lefroy, with an\r\nimpudent leer upon his face.  "The questions, no doubt, are disagreeable\r\nenough.  She ain\'t your wife no more than she\'s mine.  You\'ve no business\r\nwith her; and that you knew when you took her away from St. Louis.  You\r\nmay, or you mayn\'t, have been fooled by some one down in Texas when you\r\nwent back and married her in all that hurry.  But you knew what you were\r\ndoing well enough when you took her away.  You won\'t dare to tell me that\r\nyou hadn\'t seen Ferdinand when you two mizzled off from the College?"\r\nThen he paused, waiting again for a reply.\r\n\r\n"As I told you before," he said, "no further conversation on the subject\r\ncan be of avail.  It does not suit me to be cross-examined as to what I\r\nknew or what I did not know.  If you have anything for me to hear, you can\r\nsay it.  If you have anything to tell to others, go and tell it to them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"Then go and tell it."\r\n\r\n"You\'re in a terrible hurry, Mister Peacocke.  I don\'t want to drop in and\r\nspoil your little game.  You\'re making money of your little game.  I can\r\nhelp you as to carrying on your little game, better than you do at\r\npresent.  I don\'t want to blow upon you.  But as you\'re making money out\r\nof it, I\'d like to make a little too.  I am precious hard up,--I am."\r\n\r\n"You will make no money of me," said the other.\r\n\r\n"A little will go a long way with me; and remember, I have got tidings now\r\nwhich are worth paying for."\r\n\r\n"What tidings?"\r\n\r\n"If they\'re worth paying for, it\'s not likely that you are going to get\r\nthem for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Colonel Lefroy; whatever you may have to say about me will\r\ncertainly not be prevented by my paying you money.  Though you might be\r\nable to ruin me to-morrow I would not give you a dollar to save myself."\r\n\r\n"But her," said Lefroy, pointing as it were up-stairs, with his thumb over\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Nor her," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t care very much about her, then?"\r\n\r\n"How much I may care I shall not trouble myself to explain to you.  I\r\ncertainly shall not endeavour to serve her after that fashion.  I begin to\r\nunderstand why you have come, and can only beg you to believe that you\r\nhave come in vain."\r\n\r\nLefroy turned to his food, which he had not yet finished, while his\r\ncompanion sat silent at the window, trying to arrange in his mind the\r\ncircumstances of the moment as best he might.  He declared to himself that\r\nhad the man come but one day later, his coming would have been matter of\r\nno moment.  The story, the entire story, would then have been told to the\r\nDoctor, and the brother-in-law, with all his malice, could have added\r\nnothing to the truth.  But now it seemed as though there would be a race\r\nwhich should tell the story first.  Now the Doctor would, no doubt, be led\r\nto feel that the narration was made because it could no longer be kept\r\nback.  Should this man be with the Doctor first, and should the story be\r\ntold as he would tell it, then it would be impossible for Mr. Peacocke, in\r\nacknowledging the truth of it all, to bring his friend\'s mind back to the\r\ncondition in which it would have been had this intruder not been in the\r\nway.  And yet he could not make a race of it with the man.  He could not\r\nrush across, and, all but out of breath with his energy, begin his\r\nnarration while Lefroy was there knocking at the door.  There would be an\r\nabsence of dignity in such a mode of proceeding which alone was sufficient\r\nto deter him.  He had fixed an hour already with the Doctor.  He had said\r\nthat he would be there in the house at a certain time.  Let the man do\r\nwhat he would he would keep exactly to his purpose, unless the Doctor\r\nshould seek an earlier interview.  He would, in no tittle, be turned from\r\nhis purpose by the unfortunate coming of this wretched man.  "Well!" said\r\nLefroy, as soon as he had eaten his last mouthful.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to say to you," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"Nothing to say?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s queer.  I should have thought there\'d have been a many\r\nwords.  I\'ve got a lot to say to somebody, and mean to say it;--precious\r\nsoon too.  Is there any hotel here, where I can put this horse up?  I\r\nsuppose you haven\'t got stables of your own?  I wonder if the Doctor would\r\ngive me accommodation?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t got a stable, and the Doctor certainly will not give you\r\naccommodation.  There is a public-house less than a quarter of a mile\r\nfurther on, which no doubt your driver knows very well.  You had better go\r\nthere yourself, because after what has taken place, I am bound to tell you\r\nthat you will not be admitted here."\r\n\r\n"Not admitted?"\r\n\r\n"No.  You must leave this house, and will not be admitted into it again as\r\nlong as I live in it."\r\n\r\n"The Doctor will admit me."\r\n\r\n"Very likely.  I, at any rate, shall do nothing to dissuade him.  If you\r\ngo down to the road you\'ll see the gate leading up to his house.  I think\r\nyou\'ll find that he is down-stairs by this time."\r\n\r\n"You take it very cool, Peacocke."\r\n\r\n"I only tell you the truth.  With you I will have nothing more to do.  You\r\nhave a story which you wish to tell to Dr. Wortle.  Go and tell it to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I can tell it to all the world," said Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"Go and tell it to all the world."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t to see my sister?"\r\n\r\n"No; you will not see your sister-in-law here.  Why should she wish to see\r\none who has only injured her?"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t injured her;--at any rate not as yet.  I ain\'t done nothing;--not\r\nas yet.  I\'ve been as dark as the grave;--as yet.  Let her come down, and\r\nyou go away for a moment, and let us see if we can\'t settle it."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing for you to settle.  Nothing that you can do, nothing\r\nthat you can say, will influence either her or me.  If you have anything\r\nto tell, go and tell it."\r\n\r\n"Why should you smash up everything in that way, Peacocke?  You\'re\r\ncomfortable here; why not remain so?  I don\'t want to hurt you.  I want to\r\nhelp you;--and I can.  Three hundred dollars wouldn\'t be much to you.  You\r\nwere always a fellow as had a little money by you."\r\n\r\n"If this box were full of gold," said the schoolmaster, laying his hand\r\nupon a black desk which stood on the table, "I would not give you one cent\r\nto induce you to hold your tongue for ever.  I would not condescend even\r\nto ask it of you as a favour.  You think that you can disturb our\r\nhappiness by telling what you know of us to Dr. Wortle.  Go and try."\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke\'s manner was so firm that the other man began to doubt\r\nwhether in truth he had a secret to tell.  Could it be possible that Dr.\r\nWortle knew it all, and that the neighbours knew it all, and that, in\r\nspite of what had happened, the position of the man and of the woman was\r\naccepted among them?  They certainly were not man and wife, and yet they\r\nwere living together as such.  Could such a one as this Dr. Wortle know\r\nthat it was so?  He, when he had spoken of the purposes for which the boys\r\nwere sent there, asking whether they were not sent for education, for\r\nmorals and religion, had understood much of the Doctor\'s position.  He had\r\nknown the peculiar value of his secret.  He had been aware that a\r\nschoolmaster with a wife to whom he was not in truth married must be out\r\nof place in an English seminary such as this.  But yet he now began to\r\ndoubt.  "I am to be turned out, then?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, Colonel Lefroy.  The sooner you go the better."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pretty sort of welcome to your wife\'s brother-in-law, who has\r\njust come over all the way from Mexico to see her."\r\n\r\n"To get what he can out of her by his unwelcome presence," said Peacocke.\r\n"Here you can get nothing.  Go and do your worst.  If you remain much\r\nlonger I shall send for the policeman to remove you."\r\n\r\n"You will?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall.  My time is not my own, and I cannot go over to my work\r\nleaving you in my house.  You have nothing to get by my friendship.  Go\r\nand see what you can do as my enemy."\r\n\r\n"I will," said the Colonel, getting up from his chair; "I will.  If I\'m to\r\nbe treated in this way it shall not be for nothing.  I have offered you\r\nthe right hand of an affectionate brother-in-law."\r\n\r\n"Bosh," said Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"And you tell me that I am an enemy.  Very well; I will be an enemy.  I\r\ncould have put you altogether on your legs, but I\'ll leave you without an\r\ninch of ground to stand upon.  You see if I don\'t."  Then he put his hat\r\non his head, and stalked out of the house, down the road towards the gate.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke, when he was left alone, remained in the room collecting his\r\nthoughts, and then went up-stairs to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Has he gone?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has gone."\r\n\r\n"And what has he said?"\r\n\r\n"He has asked for money,--to hold his tongue."\r\n\r\n"Have you given him any?"\r\n\r\n"Not a cent.  I have given him nothing but hard words.  I have bade him go\r\nand do his worst.  To be at the mercy of such a man as that would be worse\r\nfor you and for me than anything that fortune has sent us even yet."\r\n\r\n"Did he want to see me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I refused.  Was it not better?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; certainly, if you think so.  What could I have said to him?\r\nCertainly it was better.  His presence would have half killed me.  But\r\nwhat will he do, Henry?"\r\n\r\n"He will tell it all to everybody that he sees."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling!"\r\n\r\n"What matter though he tells it at the town-cross?  It would have been\r\ntold to-day by myself."\r\n\r\n"But only to one."\r\n\r\n"It would have been the same.  For any purpose of concealment it would\r\nhave been the same.  I have got to hate the concealment.  What have we\r\ndone but clung together as a man and woman should who have loved each\r\nother, and have had a right to love?  What have we done of which we should\r\nbe ashamed?  Let it be told.  Let it all be known.  Have you not been good\r\nand pure?  Have not I been true to you?  Bear up your courage, and let the\r\nman do his worst.  Not to save even you would I cringe before such a man\r\nas that.  And were I to do so, I should save you from nothing."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY IS TOLD.\r\n\r\nDURING the whole of that morning the Doctor did not come into the school.\r\nThe school hours lasted from half-past nine to twelve, during a portion of\r\nwhich time it was his practice to be there.  But sometimes, on a Saturday,\r\nhe would be absent, when it was understood generally that he was preparing\r\nhis sermon for the Sunday.  Such, no doubt, might be the case now; but\r\nthere was a feeling among the boys that he was kept away by some other\r\nreason.  It was known that during the hour of morning school Mr. Peacocke\r\nhad been occupied with that uncouth stranger, and some of the boys might\r\nhave observed that the uncouth stranger had not taken himself altogether\r\naway from the premises.  There was at any rate a general feeling that the\r\nuncouth stranger had something to do with the Doctor\'s absence.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke did his best to go on with the work as though nothing had\r\noccurred to disturb the usual tenor of his way, and as far as the boys\r\nwere aware he succeeded.  He was just as clear about his Greek verbs, just\r\nas incisive about that passage of C\xe6sar, as he would have been had Colonel\r\nLefroy remained on the other side of the water.  But during the whole time\r\nhe was exercising his mind in that painful process of thinking of two\r\nthings at once.  He was determined that C\xe6sar should be uppermost; but it\r\nmay be doubted whether he succeeded.  At that very moment Colonel Lefroy\r\nmight be telling the Doctor that his Ella was in truth the wife of another\r\nman.  At that moment the Doctor might be deciding in his anger that the\r\nsinful and deceitful man should no longer be "officer of his."  The\r\nhour was too important to him to leave his mind at his own disposal.\r\nNevertheless he did his best.  "Clifford, junior," he said, "I shall never\r\nmake you understand what C\xe6sar says here or elsewhere if you do not give\r\nyour entire mind to C\xe6sar."\r\n\r\n"I do give my entire mind to C\xe6sar," said Clifford, junior.\r\n\r\n"Very well; now go on and try again.  But remember that C\xe6sar wants all\r\nyour mind."  As he said this he was revolving in his own mind how he would\r\nface the Doctor when the Doctor should look at him in his wrath.  If the\r\nDoctor were in any degree harsh with him, he would hold his own against\r\nthe Doctor as far as the personal contest might go.  At twelve the boys\r\nwent out for an hour before their dinner, and Lord Carstairs asked him to\r\nplay a game of rackets.\r\n\r\n"Not to-day, my Lord," he said.\r\n\r\n"Is anything wrong with you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, something is very wrong."  They had strolled out of the building,\r\nand were walking up and down the gravel terrace in front when this was\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I knew something was wrong, because you called me my Lord."\r\n\r\n"Yes, something is so wrong as to alter for me all the ordinary ways of my\r\nlife.  But I wasn\'t thinking of it.  It came by accident,--just because I\r\nam so troubled."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"There has been a man here,--a man whom I knew in America."\r\n\r\n"An enemy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--an enemy.  One who is anxious to do me all the injury he can."\r\n\r\n"Are you in his power, Mr. Peacocke?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank God; not that.  I am in no man\'s power.  He cannot do me any\r\nmaterial harm.  Anything which may happen would have happened whether he\r\nhad come or not.  But I am unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I wish I knew."\r\n\r\n"So do I,--with all my heart.  I wish you knew; I wish you knew.  I would\r\nthat all the world knew.  But we shall live through it, no doubt.  And if\r\nwe do not, what matter.  \'Nil conscire sibi,--nulla pallescere culpa.\'\r\nThat is all that is necessary to a man.  I have done nothing of which I\r\nrepent;--nothing that I would not do again; nothing of which I am ashamed\r\nto speak as far as the judgment of other men is concerned.  Go, now.  They\r\nare making up sides for cricket.  Perhaps I can tell you more before the\r\nevening is over."\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke were accustomed to dine with the boys at one,\r\nwhen Carstairs, being a private pupil, only had his lunch.  But on this\r\noccasion she did not come into the dining-room.  "I don\'t think I can\r\nto-day," she said, when he bade her to take courage, and not be altered\r\nmore than she could help, in her outward carriage, by the misery of her\r\npresent circumstances.  "I could not eat if I were there, and then they\r\nwould look at me."\r\n\r\n"If it be so, do not attempt it.  There is no necessity.  What I mean is,\r\nthat the less one shrinks the less will be the suffering.  It is the man\r\nwho shivers on the brink that is cold, and not he who plunges into the\r\nwater.  If it were over,--if the first brunt of it were over, I could find\r\nmeans to comfort you."\r\n\r\nHe went through the dinner, as he had done the C\xe6sar, eating the roast\r\nmutton and the baked potatoes, and the great plateful of currant-pie that\r\nwas brought to him.  He was fed and nourished, no doubt, but it may be\r\ndoubtful whether he knew much of the flavour of what he ate.  But before\r\nthe dinner was quite ended, before he had said the grace which it was\r\nalways his duty to pronounce, there came a message to him from the\r\nrectory.  "The Doctor would be glad to see him as soon as dinner was\r\ndone."  He waited very calmly till the proper moment should come for the\r\ngrace, and then, very calmly, he took his way over to the house.  He was\r\ncertain now that Lefroy had been with the Doctor, because he was sent for\r\nconsiderably before the time fixed for the interview.\r\n\r\nIt was his chief resolve to hold his own before the Doctor.  The Doctor,\r\nwho could read a character well, had so read that of Mr. Peacocke\'s as to\r\nhave been aware from the first that no censure, no fault-finding, would be\r\npossible if the connection were to be maintained.  Other ushers, other\r\ncurates, he had occasionally scolded.  He had been very careful never even\r\nto seem to scold Mr. Peacocke.  Mr. Peacocke had been aware of it\r\ntoo,--aware that he could not endure it, and aware also that the Doctor\r\navoided any attempt at it.  He had known that, as a consequence of this,\r\nhe was bound to be more than ordinarily prompt in the performance of all\r\nhis duties.  The man who will not endure censure has to take care that he\r\ndoes not deserve it.  Such had been this man\'s struggle, and it had been\r\naltogether successful.  Each of the two understood the other, and each\r\nrespected the other.  Now their position must be changed.  It was hardly\r\npossible, Mr. Peacocke thought, as he entered the house, that he should\r\nnot be rebuked with grave severity, and quite out of the question that he\r\nshould bear any rebuke at all.\r\n\r\nThe library at the rectory was a spacious and handsome room, in the centre\r\nof which stood a large writing-table, at which the Doctor was accustomed\r\nto sit when he was at work,--facing the door, with a bow-window at his\r\nright hand.  But he rarely remained there when any one was summoned into\r\nthe room, unless some one were summoned with whom he meant to deal in a\r\nspirit of severity.  Mr. Peacocke would be there perhaps three or four\r\ntimes a-week, and the Doctor would always get up from his chair and stand,\r\nor seat himself elsewhere in the room, and would probably move about with\r\nvivacity, being a fidgety man of quick motions, who sometimes seemed as\r\nthough he could not hold his own body still for a moment.  But now when\r\nMr. Peacocke entered the room he did not leave his place at the table.\r\n"Would you take a chair?" he said; "there is something that we must talk\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Colonel Lefroy has been with you, I take it."\r\n\r\n"A man calling himself by that name has been here.  Will you not take a\r\nchair?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that it will be necessary.  What he has told you,--what I\r\nsuppose he has told you,--is true."\r\n\r\n"You had better at any rate take a chair.  I do not believe that what he\r\nhas told me is true."\r\n\r\n"But it is."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe that what he has told me is true.  Some of it cannot, I\r\nthink, be true.  Much of it is not so,--unless I am more deceived in you\r\nthan I ever was in any man.  At any rate sit down."  Then the schoolmaster\r\ndid sit down.  "He has made you out to be a perjured, wilful, cruel\r\nbigamist."\r\n\r\n"I have not been such," said Peacocke, rising from his chair.\r\n\r\n"One who has been willing to sacrifice a woman to his passion."\r\n\r\n"No; no."\r\n\r\n"Who deceived her by false witnesses."\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"And who has now refused to allow her to see her own husband\'s brother,\r\nlest she should learn the truth."\r\n\r\n"She is there,--at any rate for you to see."\r\n\r\n"Therefore the man is a liar.  A long story has to be told, as to which at\r\npresent I can only guess what may be the nature.  I presume the story will\r\nbe the same as that you would have told had the man never come here."\r\n\r\n"Exactly the same, Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"Therefore you will own that I am right in asking you to sit down.  The\r\nstory may be very long,--that is, if you mean to tell it."\r\n\r\n"I do,--and did.  I was wrong from the first in supposing that the nature\r\nof my marriage need be of no concern to others, but to herself and to me."\r\n\r\n"Yes,--Mr. Peacocke; yes.  We are, all of us, joined together too closely\r\nto admit of isolation such as that."  There was something in this which\r\ngrated against the schoolmaster\'s pride, though nothing had been said as\r\nto which he did not know that much harder things must meet his ears before\r\nthe matter could be brought to an end between him and the Doctor.  The\r\n"Mister" had been prefixed to his name, which had been omitted for the\r\nlast three or four months in the friendly intercourse which had taken\r\nplace between them; and then, though it had been done in the form of\r\nagreeing with what he himself had said, the Doctor had made his first\r\ncomplaint by declaring that no man had a right to regard his own moral\r\nlife as isolated from the lives of others around him.  It was as much as\r\nto declare at once that he had been wrong in bringing this woman to\r\nBowick, and calling her Mrs. Peacocke.  He had said as much himself, but\r\nthat did not make the censure lighter when it came to him from the mouth\r\nof the Doctor.  "But come," said the Doctor, getting up from his seat at\r\nthe table, and throwing himself into an easy-chair, so as to mitigate the\r\nausterity of the position; "let us hear the true story.  So big a liar as\r\nthat American gentleman probably never put his foot in this room before."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Peacocke told the story, beginning with all those incidents of\r\nthe woman\'s life which had seemed to be so cruel both to him and to others\r\nat St. Louis before he had been in any degree intimate with her.  Then\r\ncame the departure of the two men, and the necessity for pecuniary\r\nassistance, which Mr. Peacocke now passed over lightly, saying nothing\r\nspecially of the assistance which he himself had rendered.  "And she was\r\nleft quite alone?" asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Quite alone."\r\n\r\n"And for how long?"\r\n\r\n"Eighteen months had passed before we heard any tidings.  Then there came\r\nnews that Colonel Lefroy was dead."\r\n\r\n"The husband?"\r\n\r\n"We did not know which.  They were both Colonels."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you that I went down into Mexico?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind what he told me.  All that he told me were lies.  What you\r\ntell me I shall believe.  But tell me everything."\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of complete authority in the Doctor\'s voice, but mixed\r\nwith this there was a kindliness which made the schoolmaster determined\r\nthat he would tell everything as far as he knew how.  "When I heard that\r\none of them was dead, I went away down to the borders of Texas, in order\r\nthat I might learn the truth."\r\n\r\n"Did she know that you were going?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--I told her the day I started."\r\n\r\n"And you told her why?"\r\n\r\n"That I might find out whether her husband were still alive."\r\n\r\n"But----"  The Doctor hesitated as he asked the next question.  He knew,\r\nhowever, that it had to be asked, and went on with it.  "Did she know that\r\nyou loved her?"  To this the other made no immediate answer.  The Doctor\r\nwas a man who, in such a matter, was intelligent enough, and he therefore\r\nput his question in another shape.  "Had you told her that you loved her?"\r\n\r\n"Never,--while I thought that other man was living."\r\n\r\n"She must have guessed it," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"She might guess what she pleased.  I told her that I was going, and I\r\nwent."\r\n\r\n"And how was it, then?"\r\n\r\n"I went, and after a time I came across the very man who is here now, this\r\nRobert Lefroy.  I met him and questioned him, and he told me that his\r\nbrother had been killed while fighting.  It was a lie."\r\n\r\n"Altogether a lie?" asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"How altogether?"\r\n\r\n"He might have been wounded and given over for dead.  The brother might\r\nhave thought him to be dead."\r\n\r\n"I do not think so.  I believe it to have been a plot in order that the\r\nman might get rid of his wife.  But I believed it.  Then I went back to\r\nSt. Louis,--and we were married."\r\n\r\n"You thought there was no obstacle but what you might become man and wife\r\nlegally?"\r\n\r\n"I thought she was a widow."\r\n\r\n"There was no further delay?"\r\n\r\n"Very little.  Why should there have been delay?"\r\n\r\n"I only ask."\r\n\r\n"She had suffered enough, and I had waited long enough."\r\n\r\n"She owed you a great deal," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"It was not a case of owing," said Mr. Peacocke.  "At least I think not.\r\nI think she had learnt to love me as I had learnt to love her."\r\n\r\n"And how did it go with you then?"\r\n\r\n"Very well,--for some months.  There was nothing to mar our\r\nhappiness,--till one day he came and made his way into our presence."\r\n\r\n"The husband?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the husband, Ferdinand Lefroy, the elder brother;--he of whom I had\r\nbeen told that he was dead; he was there standing before us, talking to\r\nus,--half drunk, but still well knowing what he was doing."\r\n\r\n"Why had he come?"\r\n\r\n"In want of money, I suppose,--as this other one has come here."\r\n\r\n"Did he ask for money?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think he did then, though he spoke of his poor condition.  But\r\non the next day he went away.  We heard that he had taken the steamer down\r\nthe river for New Orleans.  We have never heard more of him from that day\r\nto this."\r\n\r\n"Can you imagine what caused conduct such as that?"\r\n\r\n"I think money was given to him that night to go; but if so, I do not know\r\nby whom.  I gave him none.  During the next day or two I found that many\r\nin St. Louis knew that he had been there."\r\n\r\n"They knew then that you----"\r\n\r\n"They knew that my wife was not my wife.  That is what you mean to ask?"\r\nThe Doctor nodded his head.  "Yes, they knew that."\r\n\r\n"And what then?"\r\n\r\n"Word was brought to me that she and I must part if I chose to keep my\r\nplace at the College."\r\n\r\n"That you must disown her?"\r\n\r\n"The President told me that it would be better that she should go\r\nelsewhere.  How could I send her from me?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed;--but as to the facts?"\r\n\r\n"You know them all pretty well now.  I could not send her from me.  Nor\r\ncould I go and leave her.  Had we been separated then, because of the law\r\nor because of religion, the burden, the misery, the desolation, would all\r\nhave been upon her."\r\n\r\n"I would have clung to her, let the law say what it might," said the\r\nDoctor, rising from his chair.\r\n\r\n"You would?"\r\n\r\n"I would;--and I think that I could have reconciled it to my God.  But I\r\nmight have been wrong," he added; "I might have been wrong.  I only say\r\nwhat I should have done."\r\n\r\n"It was what I did."\r\n\r\n"Exactly; exactly.  We are both sinners.  Both might have been wrong.\r\nThen you brought her over here, and I suppose I know the rest?"\r\n\r\n"You know everything now," said Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"And believe every word I have heard.  Let me say that, if that may be any\r\nconsolation to you.  Of my friendship you may remain assured.  Whether you\r\ncan remain here is another question."\r\n\r\n"We are prepared to go."\r\n\r\n"You cannot expect that I should have thought it all out during the\r\nhearing of the story.  There is much to be considered;--very much.  I can\r\nonly say this, as between man and man, that no man ever sympathized with\r\nanother more warmly than I do with you.  You had better let me have till\r\nMonday to think about it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMRS. WORTLE AND MR. PUDDICOMBE.\r\n\r\nIN this way nothing was said at the first telling of the story to decide\r\nthe fate of the schoolmaster and of the lady whom we shall still call his\r\nwife.  There certainly had been no horror displayed by the Doctor.\r\n"Whether you can remain here is another question."  The Doctor, during\r\nthe whole interview, had said nothing harder than that.  Mr. Peacocke,\r\nas he left the rectory, did feel that the Doctor had been very good to\r\nhim. There had not only been no horror, but an expression of the kindest\r\nsympathy.  And as to the going, that was left in doubt.  He himself felt\r\nthat he ought to go;--but it would have been so very sad to have to go\r\nwithout a friend left with whom he could consult as to his future\r\ncondition!\r\n\r\n"He has been very kind, then?" said Mrs. Peacocke to her husband when he\r\nrelated to her the particulars of the interview.\r\n\r\n"Very kind."\r\n\r\n"And he did not reproach you."\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Nor me?"\r\n\r\n"He declared that had it been he who was in question he would have clung\r\nto you for ever and ever."\r\n\r\n"Did he?  Then will he leave us here?"\r\n\r\n"That does not follow.  I should think not.  He will know that others must\r\nknow it.  Your brother-in-law will not tell him only.  Lefroy, when he\r\nfinds that he can get no money here, from sheer revenge will tell the\r\nstory everywhere.  When he left the rectory, he was probably as angry with\r\nthe Doctor as he is with me.  He will do all the harm that he can to all\r\nof us."\r\n\r\n"We must go, then?"\r\n\r\n"I should think so.  Your position here would be insupportable even if it\r\ncould be permitted.  You may be sure of this;--everybody will know it."\r\n\r\n"What do I care for everybody?" she said.  "It is not that I am ashamed of\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"No, dearest; nor am I,--ashamed of myself or of you.  But there will be\r\nbitter words, and bitter words will produce bitter looks and scant\r\nrespect.  How would it be with you if the boys looked at you as though\r\nthey thought ill of you?"\r\n\r\n"They would not;--oh, they would not!"\r\n\r\n"Or the servants,--if they reviled you?"\r\n\r\n"Could it come to that?"\r\n\r\n"It must not come to that.  But it is as the Doctor said himself just\r\nnow;--a man cannot isolate the morals, the manners, the ways of his life\r\nfrom the morals of others.  Men, if they live together, must live together\r\nby certain laws."\r\n\r\n"Then there can be no hope for us."\r\n\r\n"None that I can see, as far as Bowick is concerned.  We are too closely\r\njoined in our work with other people.  There is not a boy here with whose\r\nfather and mother and sisters we are not more or less connected.  When I\r\nwas preaching in the church, there was not one in the parish with whom I\r\nwas not connected.  Would it do, do you think, for a priest to preach\r\nagainst drunkenness, whilst he himself was a noted drunkard?"\r\n\r\n"Are we like that?"\r\n\r\n"It is not what the drunken priest might think of himself, but what others\r\nmight think of him.  It would not be with us the position which we know\r\nthat we hold together, but that which others would think it to be.  If I\r\nwere in Dr. Wortle\'s case, and another were to me as I am to him, I should\r\nbid him go."\r\n\r\n"You would turn him away from you; him and his--wife?"\r\n\r\n"I should.  My first duty would be to my parish and to my school.  If I\r\ncould befriend him otherwise I would do so;--and that is what I expect\r\nfrom Dr. Wortle.  We shall have to go, and I shall be forced to approve of\r\nour dismissal."\r\n\r\nIn this way Mr. Peacocke came definitely and clearly to a conclusion in\r\nhis own mind.  But it was very different with Dr. Wortle.  The story so\r\ndisturbed him, that during the whole of that afternoon he did not attempt\r\nto turn his mind to any other subject.  He even went so far as to send\r\nover to Mr. Puddicombe and asked for some assistance for the afternoon\r\nservice on the following day.  He was too unwell, he said, to preach\r\nhimself, and the one curate would have the two entire services unless Mr.\r\nPuddicombe could help him.  Could Mr. Puddicombe come himself and see him\r\non the Sunday afternoon?  This note he sent away by a messenger, who came\r\nback with a reply, saying that Mr. Puddicombe would himself preach in the\r\nafternoon, and would afterwards call in at the rectory.\r\n\r\nFor an hour or two before his dinner, the Doctor went out on horseback,\r\nand roamed about among the lanes, endeavouring to make up his mind.  He\r\nwas hitherto altogether at a loss as to what he should do in this present\r\nuncomfortable emergency.  He could not bring his conscience and his\r\ninclination to come square together.  And even when he counselled himself\r\nto yield to his conscience, his very conscience,--a second conscience, as\r\nit were,--revolted against the first.  His first conscience told him that\r\nhe owed a primary duty to his parish, a second duty to his school, and a\r\nthird to his wife and daughter.  In the performance of all these duties he\r\nwould be bound to rid himself of Mr. Peacocke.  But then there came that\r\nother conscience, telling him that the man had been more "sinned against\r\nthan sinning,"--that common humanity required him to stand by a man who\r\nhad suffered so much, and had suffered so unworthily.  Then this second\r\nconscience went on to remind him that the man was pre-eminently fit for\r\nthe duties which he had undertaken,--that the man was a God-fearing,\r\nmoral, and especially intellectual assistant in his school,--that were he\r\nto lose him he could not hope to find any one that would be his equal, or\r\nat all approaching to him in capacity.  This second conscience went\r\nfurther, and assured him that the man\'s excellence as a schoolmaster was\r\neven increased by the peculiarity of his position.  Do we not all know\r\nthat if a man be under a cloud the very cloud will make him more attentive\r\nto his duties than another?  If a man, for the wages which he receives,\r\ncan give to his employer high character as well as work, he will think\r\nthat he may lighten his work because of his character.  And as to this\r\nman, who was the very ph[oe]nix of school assistants, there would really be\r\nnothing amiss with his character if only this piteous incident as to his\r\nwife were unknown.  In this way his second conscience almost got the\r\nbetter of the first.\r\n\r\nBut then it would be known.  It would be impossible that it should not be\r\nknown.  He had already made up his mind to tell Mr. Puddicombe, absolutely\r\nnot daring to decide in such an emergency without consulting some friend.\r\nMr. Puddicombe would hold his peace if he were to promise to do so.\r\nCertainly he might be trusted to do that.  But others would know it; the\r\nBishop would know it; Mrs. Stantiloup would know it.  That man, of course,\r\nwould take care that all Broughton, with its close full of cathedral\r\nclergymen, would know it.  When Mrs. Stantiloup should know it there would\r\nnot be a boy\'s parent through all the school who would not know it.  If he\r\nkept the man he must keep him resolving that all the world should know\r\nthat he kept him, that all the world should know of what nature was the\r\nmarried life of the assistant in whom he trusted.  And he must be prepared\r\nto face all the world, confiding in the uprightness and the humanity of\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\nIn such case he must say something of this kind to all the world; "I know\r\nthat they are not married.  I know that their condition of life is opposed\r\nto the law of God and man.  I know that she bears a name that is not, in\r\ntruth, her own; but I think that the circumstances in this case are so\r\nstrange, so peculiar, that they excuse a disregard even of the law of God\r\nand man."  Had he courage enough for this?  And if the courage were there,\r\nwas he high enough and powerful enough to carry out such a purpose?  Could\r\nhe beat down the Mrs. Stantiloups?  And, indeed, could he beat down the\r\nBishop and the Bishop\'s phalanx;--for he knew that the Bishop and the\r\nBishop\'s phalanx would be against him?  They could not touch him in his\r\nliving, because Mr. Peacocke would not be concerned in the services of the\r\nchurch; but would not his school melt away to nothing in his hands, if he\r\nwere to attempt to carry it on after this fashion?  And then would he not\r\nhave destroyed himself without advantage to the man whom he was anxious to\r\nassist?\r\n\r\nTo only one point did he make up his mind certainly during that ride.\r\nBefore he slept that night he would tell the whole story to his wife.  He\r\nhad at first thought that he would conceal it from her.  It was his rule\r\nof life to act so entirely on his own will, that he rarely consulted her\r\non matters of any importance.  As it was, he could not endure the\r\nresponsibility of acting by himself.  People would say of him that he had\r\nsubjected his wife to contamination, and had done so without giving her\r\nany choice in the matter.  So he resolved that he would tell his wife.\r\n\r\n"Not married," said Mrs. Wortle, when she heard the story.\r\n\r\n"Married; yes.  They were married.  It was not their fault that the\r\nmarriage was nothing.  What was he to do when he heard that they had been\r\ndeceived in this way?"\r\n\r\n"Not married properly!  Poor woman!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed.  What should I have done if such had happened to me when we\r\nhad been six months married?"\r\n\r\n"It couldn\'t have been."\r\n\r\n"Why not to you as well as to another?"\r\n\r\n"I was only a young girl."\r\n\r\n"But if you had been a widow?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, my dear; don\'t!  It wouldn\'t have been possible."\r\n\r\n"But you pity her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"And you see that a great misfortune has fallen upon her, which she could\r\nnot help?"\r\n\r\n"Not till she knew it," said the wife who had been married quite properly.\r\n\r\n"And what then?  What should she have done then?"\r\n\r\n"Gone," said the wife, who had no doubt as to the comfort, the beauty, the\r\nperfect security of her own position.\r\n\r\n"Gone?"\r\n\r\n"Gone away at once."\r\n\r\n"Whither should she go?  Who would have taken her by the hand?  Who would\r\nhave supported her?  Would you have had her lay herself down in the first\r\ngutter and die?"\r\n\r\n"Better that than what she did do," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Then, by all the faith I have in Christ, I think you are hard upon her.\r\nDo you think what it is to have to go out and live alone;--to have to look\r\nfor your bread in desolation?"\r\n\r\n"I have never been tried, my dear," said she, clinging close to him.  "I\r\nhave never had anything but what was good."\r\n\r\n"Ought we not to be kind to one to whom Fortune has been so unkind?"\r\n\r\n"If we can do so without sin."\r\n\r\n"Sin!  I despise the fear of sin which makes us think that its contact\r\nwill soil us.  Her sin, if it be sin, is so near akin to virtue, that I\r\ndoubt whether we should not learn of her rather than avoid her."\r\n\r\n"A woman should not live with a man unless she be his wife."  Mrs.\r\nWortle said this with more of obstinacy than he had expected.\r\n\r\n"She was his wife, as far as she knew."\r\n\r\n"But when she knew that it was not so any longer,--then she should have\r\nleft him."\r\n\r\n"And have starved?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose she might have taken bread from him."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, that she should go away from here?"\r\n\r\n"Do not you think so?  What will Mrs. Stantiloup say?"\r\n\r\n"And I am to turn them out into the cold because of a virago such as she\r\nis?  You would have no more charity than that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jeffrey! what would the Bishop say?"\r\n\r\n"Cannot you get beyond Mrs. Stantiloup and beyond the Bishop, and think\r\nwhat Justice demands?"\r\n\r\n"The boys would all be taken away.  If you had a son, would you send him\r\nwhere there was a schoolmaster living,--living----.  Oh, you wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\nIt is very clear to the Doctor that his wife\'s mind was made up on the\r\nsubject; and yet there was no softer-hearted woman than Mrs. Wortle\r\nanywhere in the diocese, or one less likely to be severe upon a neighbour.\r\nNot only was she a kindly, gentle woman, but she was one who always had\r\nbeen willing to take her husband\'s opinion on all questions of right and\r\nwrong.  She, however, was decided that they must go.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning, after service, which the schoolmaster did not attend,\r\nthe Doctor saw Mr. Peacocke, and declared his intention of telling the\r\nstory to Mr. Puddicombe.  "If you bid me hold my tongue," he said, "I will\r\ndo so.  But it will be better that I should consult another clergyman.  He\r\nis a man who can keep a secret."  Then Mr. Peacocke gave him full authority\r\nto tell everything to Mr. Puddicombe.  He declared that the Doctor might\r\ntell the story to whom he would.  Everybody might know it now.  He had, he\r\nsaid, quite made up his mind about that.  What was the good of affecting\r\nsecrecy when this man Lefroy was in the country?\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, after service, Mr. Puddicombe came up to the house, and\r\nheard it all.  He was a dry, thin, apparently unsympathetic man, but just\r\nwithal, and by no means given to harshness.  He could pardon whenever he\r\ncould bring himself to believe that pardon would have good results; but he\r\nwould not be driven by impulses and softness of heart to save the faulty\r\none from the effect of his fault, merely because that effect would be\r\npainful.  He was a man of no great mental calibre,--not sharp, and quick,\r\nand capable of repartee as was the Doctor, but rational in all things, and\r\nalways guided by his conscience.  "He has behaved very badly to you," he\r\nsaid, when he heard the story.\r\n\r\n"I do not think so; I have no such feeling myself."\r\n\r\n"He behaved very badly in bringing her here without telling you all the\r\nfacts.  Considering the position that she was to occupy, he must have\r\nknown that he was deceiving you."\r\n\r\n"I can forgive all that," said the Doctor, vehemently.  "As far as I\r\nmyself am concerned, I forgive everything."\r\n\r\n"You are not entitled to do so."\r\n\r\n"How--not entitled?"\r\n\r\n"You must pardon me if I seem to take a liberty in expressing myself too\r\nboldly in this matter.  Of course I should not do so unless you asked me."\r\n\r\n"I want you to speak freely,--all that you think."\r\n\r\n"In considering his conduct, we have to consider it all.  First of all\r\nthere came a great and terrible misfortune which cannot but excite our\r\npity.  According to his own story, he seems, up to that time, to have been\r\naffectionate and generous."\r\n\r\n"I believe every word of it," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Allowing for a man\'s natural bias on his own side, so do I.  He had\r\nallowed himself to become attached to another man\'s wife; but we need not,\r\nperhaps, insist upon that."  The Doctor moved himself uneasily in his\r\nchair, but said nothing.  "We will grant that he put himself right by his\r\nmarriage, though in that, no doubt, there should have been more of\r\ncaution.  Then came his great misfortune.  He knew that his marriage had\r\nbeen no marriage.  He saw the man and had no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Quite so; quite so," said the Doctor, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"He should, of course, have separated himself from her.  There can be no\r\ndoubt about it.  There is no room for any quibble."\r\n\r\n"Quibble!" said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"I mean that no reference in our own minds to the pity of the thing, to\r\nthe softness of the moment,--should make us doubt about it.  Feelings such\r\nas these should induce us to pardon sinners, even to receive them back\r\ninto our friendship and respect,--when they have seen the error of their\r\nways and have repented."\r\n\r\n"You are very hard."\r\n\r\n"I hope not.  At any rate I can only say as I think.  But, in truth, in\r\nthe present emergency you have nothing to do with all that.  If he asked\r\nyou for counsel you might give it to him, but that is not his present\r\nposition.  He has told you his story, not in a spirit of repentance, but\r\nbecause such telling had become necessary."\r\n\r\n"He would have told it all the same though this man had never come."\r\n\r\n"Let us grant that it is so, there still remains his relation to you.  He\r\ncame here under false pretences, and has done you a serious injury."\r\n\r\n"I think not," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Would you have taken him into your establishment had you known it all\r\nbefore?  Certainly not.  Therefore I say that he has deceived you.  I do\r\nnot advise you to speak to him with severity; but he should, I think, be\r\nmade to know that you appreciate what he has done."\r\n\r\n"And you would turn him off;--send him away at once, out about his\r\nbusiness?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I would send him away."\r\n\r\n"You think him such a reprobate that he should not be allowed to earn his\r\nbread anywhere?"\r\n\r\n"I have not said so.  I know nothing of his means of earning his bread.\r\nMen living in sin earn their bread constantly.  But he certainly should\r\nnot be allowed to earn his here."\r\n\r\n"Not though that man who was her husband should now be dead, and he should\r\nagain marry,--legally marry,--this woman to whom he has been so true and\r\nloyal?"\r\n\r\n"As regards you and your school," said Mr. Puddicombe, "I do not think it\r\nwould alter his position."\r\n\r\nWith this the conference ended, and Mr. Puddicombe took his leave.  As he\r\nleft the house the Doctor declared to himself that the man was a\r\nstrait-laced, fanatical, hard-hearted bigot.  But though he said so to\r\nhimself, he hardly thought so; and was aware that the man\'s words had had\r\neffect upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMR. PEACOCKE GOES.\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor had been all but savage with his wife, and, for the moment, had\r\nhated Mr. Puddicombe, but still what they said had affected him.  They\r\nwere both of them quite clear that Mr. Peacocke should be made to go at\r\nonce.  And he, though he hated Mr. Puddicombe for his cold logic, could\r\nnot but acknowledge that all the man had said was true.  According to the\r\nstrict law of right and wrong the two unfortunates should have parted when\r\nthey found that they were not in truth married.  And, again, according to\r\nthe strict law of right and wrong, Mr. Peacocke should not have brought\r\nthe woman there, into his school, as his wife.  There had been deceit.\r\nBut then would not he, Dr. Wortle himself, have been guilty of similar\r\ndeceit had it fallen upon him to have to defend a woman who had been true\r\nand affectionate to him?  Mr. Puddicombe would have left the woman to\r\nbreak her heart and have gone away and done his duty like a Christian,\r\nfeeling no tugging at his heart-strings.  It was so that our Doctor spoke\r\nto himself of his counsellor, sitting there alone in his library.\r\n\r\nDuring his conference with Lefroy something had been said which had\r\nimpressed him suddenly with an idea.  A word had fallen from the Colonel,\r\nan unintended word, by which the Doctor was made to believe that the other\r\nColonel was dead, at any rate now.  He had cunningly tried to lead up to\r\nthe subject, but Robert Lefroy had been on his guard as soon as he had\r\nperceived the Doctor\'s object, and had drawn back, denying the truth of\r\nthe word he had before spoken.  The Doctor at last asked him the question\r\ndirect.  Lefroy then declared that his brother had been alive and well\r\nwhen he left Texas, but he did this in such a manner as to strengthen in\r\nthe Doctor\'s mind the impression that he was dead.  If it were so, then\r\nmight not all these crooked things be made straight?\r\n\r\nHe had thought it better to raise no false hopes.  He had said nothing of\r\nthis to Peacocke on discussing the story.  He had not even hinted it to\r\nhis wife, from whom it might probably make its way to Mrs. Peacocke.  He\r\nhad suggested it to Mr. Puddicombe,--asking whether there might not be a\r\nway out of all their difficulties.  Mr. Puddicombe had declared that there\r\ncould be no such way as far as the school was concerned.  Let them marry,\r\nand repent their sins, and go away from the spot they had contaminated,\r\nand earn their bread in some place in which there need be no longer\r\nadditional sin in concealing the story of their past life.  That seemed to\r\nhave been Mr. Puddicombe\'s final judgment.  But it was altogether opposed\r\nto Dr. Wortle\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Puddicombe came down from the church to the rectory, Lord\r\nCarstairs was walking home after the afternoon service with Miss Wortle.\r\nIt was his custom to go to church with the family, whereas the school went\r\nthere under the charge of one of the ushers and sat apart in a portion of\r\nthe church appropriated to themselves.  Mrs. Wortle, when she found that\r\nthe Doctor was not going to the afternoon service, declined to go herself.\r\nShe was thoroughly disturbed by all these bad tidings, and was, indeed,\r\nvery little able to say her prayers in a fit state of mind.  She could\r\nhardly keep herself still for a moment, and was as one who thinks that the\r\ncrack of doom is coming;--so terrible to her was her vicinity and\r\nconnection with this man, and with the woman who was not his wife.  Then,\r\nagain, she became flurried when she found that Lord Carstairs and Mary\r\nwould have to walk alone together; and she made little abortive attempts\r\nto keep first the one and then the other from going to church.  Mary\r\nprobably saw no reason for staying away, while Lord Carstairs possibly\r\nfound an additional reason for going.  Poor Mrs. Wortle had for some weeks\r\npast wished that the charming young nobleman had been at home with his\r\nfather and mother, or anywhere but in her house.  It had been arranged,\r\nhowever, that he should go in July and not return after the summer\r\nholidays.  Under these circumstances, having full confidence in her girl,\r\nshe had refrained from again expressing her fears to the Doctor.  But\r\nthere were fears.  It was evident to her, though the Doctor seemed to see\r\nnothing of it, that the young lord was falling in love.  It might be that\r\nhis youth and natural bashfulness would come to her aid, and that nothing\r\nshould be said before that day in July which would separate them.  But\r\nwhen it suddenly occurred to her that they two would walk to and fro from\r\nchurch together, there was cause for additional uneasiness.\r\n\r\nIf she had heard their conversation as they came back she would have been\r\nin no way disturbed by its tone on the score of the young man\'s tenderness\r\ntowards her daughter, but she might perhaps have been surprised by his\r\nvehemence in another respect.  She would have been surprised also at\r\nfinding how much had been said during the last twenty-four hours by others\r\nbesides herself and her husband about the affairs of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPeacocke.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what he came about?" asked Mary.  The "he" had of course been\r\nRobert Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"Not in the least; but he came up there looking so queer, as though he\r\ncertainly had come about something unpleasant."\r\n\r\n"And then he was with papa afterwards," said Mary.  "I am sure papa and\r\nmamma not coming to church has something to do with it.  And Mr. Peacocke\r\nhasn\'t been to church all day."\r\n\r\n"Something has happened to make him very unhappy," said the boy.  "He told\r\nme so even before this man came here.  I don\'t know any one whom I like so\r\nmuch as Mr. Peacocke."\r\n\r\n"I think it is about his wife," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"How about his wife?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but I think it is.  She is so very quiet."\r\n\r\n"How quiet, Miss Wortle?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"She never will come in to see us.  Mamma has asked her to dinner and to\r\ndrink tea ever so often, but she never comes.  She calls perhaps once in\r\ntwo or three months in a formal way, and that is all we see of her."\r\n\r\n"Do you like her?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"How can I say, when I so seldom see her."\r\n\r\n"I do.  I like her very much.  I go and see her often; and I\'m sure of\r\nthis;--she is quite a lady.  Mamma asked her to go to Carstairs for the\r\nholidays because of what I said."\r\n\r\n"She is not going?"\r\n\r\n"No; neither of them will come.  I wish they would; and oh, Miss Wortle, I\r\ndo so wish you were going to be there too."  This is all that was said of\r\npeculiar tenderness between them on that walk home.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening,--so late that the boys had already gone to bed,--the\r\nDoctor sent again for Mr. Peacocke.  "I should not have troubled you\r\nto-night," he said, "only that I have heard something from Pritchett."\r\nPritchett was the rectory gardener who had charge also of the school\r\nbuildings, and was a person of great authority in the establishment.  He,\r\nas well the Doctor, held Mr. Peacocke in great respect, and would have\r\nbeen almost as unwilling as the Doctor himself to tell stories to the\r\nschoolmaster\'s discredit.  "They are saying down at the Lamb"--the Lamb\r\nwas the Bowick public-house--"that Lefroy told them all yesterday----" the\r\nDoctor hesitated before he could tell it.\r\n\r\n"That my wife is not my wife?"\r\n\r\n"Just so."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am prepared for it.  I knew that it would be so; did not\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I expected it."\r\n\r\n"I was sure of it.  It may be taken for granted at once that there is no\r\nlonger a secret to keep.  I would wish you to act just as though all the\r\nfacts were known to the entire diocese."  After this there was a pause,\r\nduring which neither of them spoke for a few moments.  The Doctor had not\r\nintended to declare any purpose of his own on that occasion, but it seemed\r\nto him now as though he were almost driven to do so.  Then Mr. Peacocke\r\nseeing the difficulty at once relieved him from it.  "I am quite prepared\r\nto leave Bowick," he said, "at once.  I know that it must be so.  I have\r\nthought about it, and have perceived that there is no possible\r\nalternative.  I should like to consult with you as to whither I had better\r\ngo.  Where shall I first take her?"\r\n\r\n"Leave her here," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Here!  Where?"\r\n\r\n"Where she is in the school-house.  No one will come to fill your place\r\nfor a while."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought," said Mr. Peacocke very slowly, "that her\r\npresence--would have been worse almost,--than my own."\r\n\r\n"To me,"--said the Doctor,--"to me she is as pure as the most unsullied\r\nmatron in the country."  Upon this Mr. Peacocke, jumping from his chair,\r\nseized the Doctor\'s hand, but could not speak for his tears; then he\r\nseated himself again, turning his face away towards the wall.  "To no one\r\ncould the presence of either of you be an evil.  The evil is, if I may say\r\nso, that the two of you should be here together.  You should be\r\napart,--till some better day has come upon you."\r\n\r\n"What better day can ever come?" said the poor man through his tears.\r\n\r\nThen the Doctor declared his scheme.  He told what he thought as to\r\nFerdinand Lefroy, and his reason for believing that the man was dead.  "I\r\nfelt sure from his manner that his brother is now dead in truth.  Go to\r\nhim and ask him boldly," he said.\r\n\r\n"But his word would not suffice for another marriage ceremony."\r\n\r\nTo this the Doctor agreed.  It was not his intention, he said, that they\r\nshould proceed on evidence as slight as that.  No; a step must be taken\r\nmuch more serious in its importance, and occupying a considerable time.\r\nHe, Peacocke, must go again to Missouri and find out all the truth.  The\r\nDoctor was of opinion that if this were resolved upon, and that if the\r\nwhole truth were at once proclaimed, then Mr. Peacocke need not hesitate\r\nto pay Robert Lefroy for any information which might assist him in his\r\nsearch.  "While you are gone," continued the Doctor almost wildly, "let\r\nbishops and Stantiloups and Puddicombes say what they may, she shall\r\nremain here.  To say that she will be happy is of course vain.  There can\r\nbe no happiness for her till this has been put right.  But she will be\r\nsafe; and here, at my hand, she will, I think, be free from insult.  What\r\nbetter is there to be done?"\r\n\r\n"There can be nothing better," said Peacocke drawing his breath,--as\r\nthough a gleam of light had shone in upon him.\r\n\r\n"I had not meant to have spoken to you of this till to-morrow.  I should\r\nnot have done so, but that Pritchett had been with me.  But the more I\r\nthought of it, the more sure I became that you could not both\r\nremain,--till something had been done; till something had been done."\r\n\r\n"I was sure of it, Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Puddicombe saw that it was so.  Mr. Puddicombe is not all the world\r\nto me by any means, but he is a man of common sense.  I will be frank with\r\nyou.  My wife said that it could not be so."\r\n\r\n"She shall not stay.  Mrs. Wortle shall not be annoyed."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t see it yet," said the Doctor.  "But you do.  I know you do.\r\nAnd she shall stay.  The house shall be hers, as her residence, for the\r\nnext six months.  As for money----"\r\n\r\n"I have got what will do for that, I think."\r\n\r\n"If she wants money she shall have what she wants.  There is nothing I\r\nwill not do for you in your trouble,--except that you may not both be here\r\ntogether till I shall have shaken hands with her as Mrs. Peacocke in very\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\nIt was settled that Mr. Peacocke should not go again into the school, or\r\nMrs. Peacocke among the boys, till he should have gone to America and have\r\ncome back.  It was explained in the school by the Doctor early,--for the\r\nDoctor must now take the morning school himself,--that circumstances of\r\nvery grave import made it necessary that Mr. Peacocke should start at once\r\nfor America.  That the tidings which had been published at the Lamb would\r\nreach the boys, was more than probable.  Nay; was it not certain?  It\r\nwould of course reach all the boys\' parents.  There was no use, no\r\nservice, in any secrecy.  But in speaking to the school not a word was\r\nsaid of Mrs. Peacocke.  The Doctor explained that he himself would take\r\nthe morning school, and that Mr. Rose, the mathematical master, would take\r\ncharge of the school meals.  Mrs. Cane, the house-keeper, would look to\r\nthe linen and the bed-rooms.  It was made plain that Mrs. Peacocke\'s\r\nservices were not to be required; but her name was not mentioned,--except\r\nthat the Doctor, in order to let it be understood that she was not to be\r\nbanished from the house, begged the boys as a favour that they would not\r\ninterrupt Mrs. Peacocke\'s tranquillity during Mr. Peacocke\'s absence.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday morning Mr. Peacocke started, remaining, however, a couple\r\nof days at Broughton, during which the Doctor saw him.  Lefroy declared\r\nthat he knew nothing about his brother,--whether he were alive or dead.\r\nHe might be dead, because he was always in trouble, and generally drunk.\r\nRobert, on the whole, thought it probable that he was dead, but could not\r\nbe got to say so.  For a thousand dollars he would go over to Missouri,\r\nand, if necessary to Texas, so as to find the truth.  He would then come\r\nback and give undeniable evidence.  While making this benevolent offer, he\r\ndeclared, with tears in his eyes, that he had come over intending to be a\r\ntrue brother to his sister-in-law, and had simply been deterred from\r\nprosecuting his good intentions by Peacocke\'s austerity.  Then he swore a\r\nmost solemn oath that if he knew anything about his brother Ferdinand he\r\nwould reveal it.  The Doctor and Peacocke agreed together that the man\'s\r\nword was worth nothing; but that the man\'s services might be useful in\r\nenabling them to track out the truth.  They were both convinced, by words\r\nwhich fell from him, that Ferdinand Lefroy was dead; but this would be of\r\nno avail unless they could obtain absolute evidence.\r\n\r\nDuring these two days there were various conversations at Broughton\r\nbetween the Doctor, Mr. Peacocke, and Lefroy, in which a plan of action\r\nwas at length arranged.  Lefroy and the schoolmaster were to proceed to\r\nAmerica together, and there obtain what evidence they could as to the life\r\nor death of the elder brother.  When absolute evidence had been obtained\r\nof either, a thousand dollars was to be handed to Robert Lefroy.  But when\r\nthis agreement was made the man was given to understand that his own\r\nuncorroborated word would go for nothing.\r\n\r\n"Who is to say what is evidence, and what not?" asked the man, not\r\nunnaturally.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Peacocke must be the judge," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t going to agree to that," said the other.  "Though he were to see\r\nhim dead, he might swear he hadn\'t, and not give me a red cent.  Why ain\'t\r\nI to be judge as well as he?"\r\n\r\n"Because you can trust him, and he cannot in the least trust you," said\r\nthe Doctor.  "You know well enough that if he were to see your brother\r\nalive, or to see him dead, you would get the money.  At any rate, you\r\nhave no other way of getting it but what we propose."  To all this Robert\r\nLefroy at last assented.\r\n\r\nThe prospect before Mr. Peacocke for the next three months was certainly\r\nvery sad.  He was to travel from Broughton to St. Louis, and possibly from\r\nthence down into the wilds of Texas, in company with this man, whom he\r\nthoroughly despised.  Nothing could be more abominable to him than such an\r\nassociation; but there was no other way in which the proposed plan could\r\nbe carried out.  He was to pay Lefroy\'s expenses back to his own country,\r\nand could only hope to keep the man true to his purpose by doing so from\r\nday to day.  Were he to give the man money, the man would at once\r\ndisappear.  Here in England, and in their passage across the ocean, the\r\nman might, in some degree, be amenable and obedient.  But there was no\r\nknowing to what he might have recourse when he should find himself nearer\r\nto his country, and should feel that his companion was distant from his\r\nown.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to keep a close watch upon him," whispered the Doctor to his\r\nfriend.  "I should not advise all this if I did not think you were a man\r\nof strong nerve."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid," said the other; "but I doubt whether he may not be too\r\nmany for me.  At any rate, I will try it.  You will hear from me as I go\r\non."\r\n\r\nAnd so they parted as dear friends part.  The Doctor had, in truth, taken\r\nthe man altogether to his heart since all the circumstances of the story\r\nhad come home to him.  And it need hardly be said that the other was aware\r\nhow deep a debt of gratitude he owed to the protector of his wife.  Indeed\r\nthe very money that was to be paid to Robert Lefroy, if he earned it, was\r\nadvanced out of the Doctor\'s pocket.  Mr. Peacocke\'s means were sufficient\r\nfor the expenses of the journey, but fell short when these thousand\r\ndollars had to be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP.\r\n\r\nMR. PEACOCKE had been quite right in saying that the secret would at once\r\nbe known through the whole diocese.  It certainly was so before he had\r\nbeen gone a week, and it certainly was the case also that the diocese\r\ngenerally did not approve of the Doctor\'s conduct.  The woman ought not to\r\nhave been left there.  So said the diocese.  It was of course the case,\r\nthat though the diocese knew much, it did not know all.  It is impossible\r\nto keep such a story concealed, but it is quite as impossible to make\r\nknown all its details.  In the eyes of the diocese the woman was of course\r\nthe chief sinner, and the chief sinner was allowed to remain at the\r\nschool!  When this assertion was made to him the Doctor became very angry,\r\nsaying that Mrs. Peacocke did not remain at the school; that, according to\r\nthe arrangement as at present made, Mrs. Peacocke had nothing to do with\r\nthe school; that the house was his own, and that he might lend it to whom\r\nhe pleased.  Was he to turn the woman out houseless, when her husband had\r\ngone, on such an errand, on his advice?  Of course the house was his own,\r\nbut as clergyman of the parish he had not a right to do what he liked with\r\nit.  He had no right to encourage evil.  And the man was not the woman\'s\r\nhusband.  That was just the point made by the diocese.  And she was at the\r\nschool,--living under the same roof with the boys!  The diocese was\r\nclearly of opinion that all the boys would be taken away.\r\n\r\nThe diocese spoke by the voice of its bishop, as a diocese should do.\r\nShortly after Mr. Peacocke\'s departure, the Doctor had an interview with\r\nhis lordship, and told the whole story.  The doing this went much against\r\nthe grain with him, but he hardly dared not to do it.  He felt that he was\r\nbound to do it on the part of Mrs. Peacocke if not on his own.  And then\r\nthe man, who had now gone, though he had never been absolutely a curate,\r\nhad preached frequently in the diocese.  He felt that it would not be wise\r\nto abstain from telling the bishop.\r\n\r\nThe bishop was a goodly man, comely in his person, and possessed of\r\nmanners which had made him popular in the world.  He was one of those who\r\nhad done the best he could with his talent, not wrapping it up in a\r\nnapkin, but getting from it the best interest which the world\'s market\r\ncould afford.  But not on that account was he other than a good man.  To\r\ndo the best he could for himself and his family,--and also to do his\r\nduty,--was the line of conduct which he pursued.  There are some who\r\nreverse this order, but he was not one of them.  He had become a scholar\r\nin his youth, not from love of scholarship, but as a means to success.\r\nThe Church had become his profession, and he had worked hard at his\r\ncalling.  He had taught himself to be courteous and urbane, because he had\r\nbeen clever enough to see that courtesy and urbanity are agreeable to men\r\nin high places.  As a bishop he never spared himself the work which a\r\nbishop ought to do.  He answered letters, he studied the characters of the\r\nclergymen under him, he was just with his patronage, he endeavoured to be\r\nefficacious with his charges, he confirmed children in cold weather as\r\nwell as in warm, he occasionally preached sermons, and he was beautiful\r\nand decorous in his gait of manner, as it behoves a clergyman of the\r\nChurch of England to be.  He liked to be master; but even to be master he\r\nwould not encounter the abominable nuisance of a quarrel.  When first\r\ncoming to the diocese he had had some little difficulty with our Doctor;\r\nbut the Bishop had abstained from violent assertion, and they had, on the\r\nwhole, been friends.  There was, however, on the Bishop\'s part, something\r\nof a feeling that the Doctor was the bigger man; and it was probable that,\r\nwithout active malignity, he would take advantage of any chance which\r\nmight lower the Doctor a little, and bring him more within episcopal\r\npower.  In some degree he begrudged the Doctor his manliness.\r\n\r\nHe listened with many smiles and with perfect courtesy to the story as it\r\nwas told to him, and was much less severe on the unfortunates than Mr.\r\nPuddicombe had been.  It was not the wickedness of the two people in\r\nliving together, or their wickedness in keeping their secret, which\r\noffended him so much, as the evil which they were likely to do,--and to\r\nhave done.  "No doubt," he said, "an ill-living man may preach a good\r\nsermon, perhaps a better one than a pious God-fearing clergyman, whose\r\nintellect may be inferior though his morals are much better;--but coming\r\nfrom tainted lips, the better sermon will not carry a blessing with it."\r\nAt this the Doctor shook his head.  "Bringing a blessing" was a phrase\r\nwhich the Doctor hated.  He shook his head not too civilly, saying that he\r\nhad not intended to trouble his lordship on so difficult a point in\r\necclesiastical morals.  "But we cannot but remember," said the Bishop,\r\n"that he has been preaching in your parish church, and the people will\r\nknow that he has acted among them as a clergyman."\r\n\r\n"I hope the people, my lord, may never have the Gospel preached to them by\r\na worse man."\r\n\r\n"I will not judge him; but I do think that it has been a misfortune.  You,\r\nof course, were in ignorance."\r\n\r\n"Had I known all about it, I should have been very much inclined to do the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nThis was, in fact, not true, and was said simply in a spirit of\r\ncontradiction.  The Bishop shook his head and smiled.  "My school is a\r\nmatter of more importance," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Hardly, hardly, Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"Of more importance in this way, that my school may probably be injured,\r\nwhereas neither the morals nor the faith of the parishioners will have\r\nbeen hurt."\r\n\r\n"But he has gone."\r\n\r\n"He has gone;--but she remains."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"He has gone, but she remains."  He repeated the words very distinctly,\r\nwith a frown on his brow, as though to show that on that branch of the\r\nsubject he intended to put up with no opposition,--hardly even with an\r\nadverse opinion.\r\n\r\n"She had a certain charge, as I understand,--as to the school."\r\n\r\n"She had, my lord; and very well she did her work.  I shall have a great\r\nloss in her,--for the present."\r\n\r\n"But you said she remained."\r\n\r\n"I have lent her the use of the house till her husband shall come back."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Peacocke, you mean," said the Bishop, who was unable not to put in a\r\ncontradiction against the untruth of the word which had been used.\r\n\r\n"I shall always regard them as married."\r\n\r\n"But they are not."\r\n\r\n"I have lent her the house, at any rate, during his absence.  I could not\r\nturn her into the street."\r\n\r\n"Would not a lodging here in the city have suited her better?"\r\n\r\n"I thought not.  People here would have refused to take her,--because of\r\nher story.  The wife of some religious grocer, who sands his sugar\r\nregularly, would have thought her house contaminated by such an inmate."\r\n\r\n"So it would have been, Doctor, to some extent."  At hearing this the\r\nDoctor made very evident signs of discontent.  "You cannot alter the ways\r\nof the world suddenly, though by example and precept you may help to\r\nimprove them slowly.  In our present imperfect condition of moral culture,\r\nit is perhaps well that the company of the guilty should be shunned."\r\n\r\n"Guilty!"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that I must say so.  The knowledge that such a feeling exists\r\nno doubt deters others from guilt.  The fact that wrong-doing in women is\r\nscorned helps to maintain the innocence of women.  Is it not so?"\r\n\r\n"I must hesitate before I trouble your lordship by arguing such difficult\r\nquestions.  I thought it right to tell you the facts after what had\r\noccurred.  He has gone, she is there,--and there she will remain for the\r\npresent.  I could not turn her out.  Thinking her, as I do, worthy of my\r\nfriendship, I could not do other than befriend her."\r\n\r\n"Of course you must be the judge yourself."\r\n\r\n"I had to be the judge, my lord."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid that the parents of the boys will not understand it."\r\n\r\n"I also am afraid.  It will be very hard to make them understand it.\r\nThere will be some who will work hard to make them misunderstand it."\r\n\r\n"I hope not that."\r\n\r\n"There will.  I must stand the brunt of it.  I have had battles before\r\nthis, and had hoped that now, when I am getting old, they might have been\r\nat an end.  But there is something left of me, and I can fight still.  At\r\nany rate, I have made up my mind about this.  There she shall remain till\r\nhe comes back to fetch her."  And so the interview was over, the Bishop\r\nfeeling that he had in some slight degree had the best of it,--and the\r\nDoctor feeling that he, in some slight degree, had had the worst.  If\r\npossible, he would not talk to the Bishop on the subject again.\r\n\r\nHe told Mr. Puddicombe also.  "With your generosity and kindness of heart\r\nI quite sympathise," said Mr. Puddicombe, endeavouring to be pleasant in\r\nhis manner.\r\n\r\n"But not with my prudence."\r\n\r\n"Not with your prudence," said Mr. Puddicombe, endeavouring to be true at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor\'s greatest difficulty was with his wife, whose conduct it\r\nwas necessary that he should guide, and whose feelings and conscience he\r\nwas most anxious to influence.  When she first heard his decision she\r\nalmost wrung her hands in despair.  If the woman could have gone to\r\nAmerica, and the man have remained, she would have been satisfied.\r\nAnything wrong about a man was but of little moment,--comparatively so,\r\neven though he were a clergyman; but anything wrong about a woman,--and\r\nshe so near to herself!  O dear!  And the poor dear boys,--under the same\r\nroof with her!  And the boys\' mammas!  How would she be able to endure the\r\nsight of that horrid Mrs. Stantiloup;--or Mrs. Stantiloup\'s words, which\r\nwould certainly be conveyed to her?  But there was something much worse\r\nfor her even than all this.  The Doctor insisted that she should go and\r\ncall upon the woman!  "And take Mary?" asked Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"What would be the good of taking Mary?  Who is talking of a child like\r\nthat?  It is for the sake of charity,--for the dear love of Christ, that I\r\nask you to do it.  Do you ever think of Mary Magdalene?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"This is no Magdalene.  This is a woman led into no faults by vicious\r\npropensities.  Here is one who has been altogether unfortunate,--who has\r\nbeen treated more cruelly than any of whom you have ever read."\r\n\r\n"Why did she not leave him?"\r\n\r\n"Because she was a woman, with a heart in her bosom."\r\n\r\n"I am to go to her?"\r\n\r\n"I do not order it.  I only ask it."  Such asking from her husband was,\r\nshe knew, very near alike to ordering.\r\n\r\n"What shall I say to her?"\r\n\r\n"Bid her keep up her courage till he shall return.  If you were all alone,\r\nas she is, would not you wish that some other woman should come to comfort\r\nyou?  Think of her desolation."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wortle did think of it, and after a day or two made up her mind to\r\nobey her husband\'s--request.  She made her call, but very little came of\r\nit, except that she promised to come again.  "Mrs. Wortle," said the poor\r\nwoman, "pray do not let me be a trouble to you.  If you stay away I shall\r\nquite understand that there is sufficient reason.  I know how good your\r\nhusband has been to us."  Mrs. Wortle said, however, as she took her\r\nleave, that she would come again in a day or two.\r\n\r\nBut there were other troubles in store for Mrs. Wortle.  Before she had\r\nrepeated her visit to Mrs. Peacocke, a lady, who lived about ten miles\r\noff, the wife of the Rector of Buttercup, called upon her.  This was the\r\nLady Margaret Momson, a daughter of the Earl of Brigstock, who had, thirty\r\nyears ago, married a young clergyman.  Nevertheless, up to the present\r\nday, she was quite as much the Earl\'s daughter as the parson\'s wife.  She\r\nwas first cousin to that Mrs. Stantiloup between whom and the Doctor\r\ninternecine war was always being waged; and she was also aunt to a boy at\r\nthe school, who, however, was in no way related to Mrs. Stantiloup, young\r\nMomson being the son of the parson\'s eldest brother.  Lady Margaret had\r\nnever absolutely and openly taken the part of Mrs. Stantiloup.  Had she\r\ndone so, a visit even of ceremony would have been impossible.  But she was\r\nsupposed to have Stantiloup proclivities, and was not, therefore, much\r\nliked at Bowick.  There had been a question indeed whether young Momson\r\nshould be received at the school,--because of the _quasi_ connection with\r\nthe arch-enemy; but Squire Momson of Buttercup, the boy\'s father, had set\r\nthat at rest by bursting out, in the Doctor\'s hearing, into violent abuse\r\nagainst "the close-fisted, vulgar old faggot."  The son of a man imbued\r\nwith such proper feelings was, of course, accepted.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Margaret was proud,--especially at the present time.  "What a\r\nromance this is, Mrs. Wortle," she said, "that has gone all through the\r\ndiocese!"  The reader will remember that Lady Margaret was also the wife\r\nof a clergyman.\r\n\r\n"You mean--the Peacockes?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do."\r\n\r\n"He has gone away."\r\n\r\n"We all know that, of course;--to look for his wife\'s husband.  Good\r\ngracious me!  What a story!"\r\n\r\n"They think that he is--dead now."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they thought so before," said Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Of course they did."\r\n\r\n"Though it does seem that no inquiry was made at all.  Perhaps they don\'t\r\ncare about those things over there as we do here.  He couldn\'t have cared\r\nvery much,--nor she."\r\n\r\n"The Doctor thinks that they are very much to be pitied."\r\n\r\n"The Doctor always was a little Quixotic--eh?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that at all, Lady Margaret."\r\n\r\n"I mean in the way of being so very good-natured and kind.  Her brother\r\ncame;--didn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Her first husband\'s brother," said Mrs. Wortle, blushing.\r\n\r\n"Her first husband!"\r\n\r\n"Well;--you know what I mean, Lady Margaret."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know what you mean.  It is so very shocking; isn\'t it?  And so the\r\ntwo men have gone off together to look for the third.  Goodness me;--what\r\na party they will be if they meet!  Do you think they\'ll quarrel?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Lady Margaret."\r\n\r\n"And that he should be a clergyman of the Church of England!  Isn\'t it\r\ndreadful?  What does the Bishop say?  Has he heard all about it?"\r\n\r\n"The Bishop has nothing to do with it.  Mr. Peacocke never held a curacy\r\nin the diocese."\r\n\r\n"But he has preached here very often,--and has taken her to church with\r\nhim!  I suppose the Bishop has been told?"\r\n\r\n"You may be sure that he knows it as well as you."\r\n\r\n"We are so anxious, you know, about dear little Gus."  Dear little Gus\r\nwas Augustus Momson, the lady\'s nephew, who was supposed to be the\r\nworst-behaved, and certainly the stupidest boy in the school.\r\n\r\n"Augustus will not be hurt, I should say."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not directly.  But my sister has, I know, very strong opinions on\r\nsuch subjects.  Now, I want to ask you one thing.  Is it true\r\nthat--she--remains here?"\r\n\r\n"She is still living in the school-house."\r\n\r\n"Is that prudent, Mrs. Wortle?"\r\n\r\n"If you want to have an opinion on that subject, Lady Margaret, I would\r\nrecommend you to ask the Doctor."  By which she meant to assert that Lady\r\nMargaret would not, for the life of her, dare to ask the Doctor such a\r\nquestion.  "He has done what he has thought best."\r\n\r\n"Most good-natured, you mean, Mrs. Wortle."\r\n\r\n"I mean what I say, Lady Margaret.  He has done what he has thought best,\r\nlooking at all the circumstances.  He thinks that they are very worthy\r\npeople, and that they have been most cruelly ill-used.  He has taken that\r\ninto consideration.  You call it good-nature.  Others perhaps may call\r\nit--charity."  The wife, though she at her heart deplored her husband\'s\r\naction in the matter, was not going to own to another lady that he had\r\nbeen imprudent.\r\n\r\n"I am sure I hope they will," said Lady Margaret.  Then as she was taking\r\nher leave, she made a suggestion.  "Some of the boys will be taken away, I\r\nsuppose.  The Doctor probably expects that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he expects," said Mrs. Wortle.  "Some are always going,\r\nand when they go, others come in their places.  As for me, I wish he would\r\ngive the school up altogether."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he means it," said Lady Margaret; "otherwise, perhaps he wouldn\'t\r\nhave been so good-natured."  Then she took her departure.\r\n\r\nWhen her visitor was gone Mrs. Wortle was very unhappy.  She had been\r\nbetrayed by her wrath into expressing that wish as to the giving up of the\r\nschool.  She knew well that the Doctor had no such intention.  She herself\r\nhad more than once suggested it in her timid way, but the Doctor had\r\ntreated her suggestions as being worth nothing.  He had his ideas about\r\nMary, who was undoubtedly a very pretty girl.  Mary might marry well, and\r\n\xa320,000 would probably assist her in doing so.\r\n\r\nWhen he was told of Lady Margaret\'s hints, he said in his wrath that he\r\nwould send young Momson away instantly if a word was said to him by the\r\nboy\'s mamma.  "Of course," said he, "if the lad turns out a scapegrace, as\r\nis like enough, it will be because Mrs. Peacocke had two husbands.  It is\r\noften a question to me whether the religion of the world is not more\r\nodious than its want of religion."  To this terrible suggestion poor Mrs.\r\nWortle did not dare to make any answer whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE STANTILOUP CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nWE will now pass for a moment out of Bowick parish, and go over to\r\nButtercup.  There, at Buttercup Hall, the squire\'s house, in the\r\ndrawing-room, were assembled Mrs. Momson, the squire\'s wife; Lady Margaret\r\nMomson, the Rector\'s wife; Mrs. Rolland, the wife of the Bishop; and the\r\nHon. Mrs. Stantiloup.  A party was staying in the house, collected for the\r\npurpose of entertaining the Bishop; and it would perhaps not have been\r\npossible to have got together in the diocese, four ladies more likely to\r\nbe hard upon our Doctor.  For though Squire Momson was not very fond of\r\nMrs. Stantiloup, and had used strong language respecting her when he was\r\nanxious to send his boy to the Doctor\'s school, Mrs. Momson had always\r\nbeen of the other party, and had in fact adhered to Mrs. Stantiloup from\r\nthe beginning of the quarrel.  "I do trust," said Mrs. Stantiloup, "that\r\nthere will be an end to all this kind of thing now."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean an end to the school?" asked Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"I do indeed.  I always thought it matter of great regret that Augustus\r\nshould have been sent there, after the scandalous treatment that Bob\r\nreceived."  Bob was the little boy who had drank the champagne and\r\nrequired the carriage exercise.\r\n\r\n"But I always heard that the school was quite popular," said Mrs. Rolland.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'ll find," continued Mrs. Stantiloup, "that there won\'t be\r\nmuch left of its popularity now.  Keeping that abominable woman under the\r\nsame roof with the boys!  No master of a school that wasn\'t absolutely\r\nblown up with pride, would have taken such people as those Peacockes\r\nwithout making proper inquiry.  And then to let him preach in the church!\r\nI suppose Mr. Momson will allow you to send for Augustus at once?"  This\r\nshe said turning to Mrs. Momson.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Momson thinks so much of the Doctor\'s scholarship," said the mother,\r\napologetically.  "And we are so anxious that Gus should do well when he\r\ngoes to Eton."\r\n\r\n"What is Latin and Greek as compared to his soul?" asked Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Mrs. Rolland.  She had found herself compelled, as wife\r\nof the Bishop, to assent to the self-evident proposition which had been\r\nmade.  She was a quiet, silent little woman, whom the Bishop had married\r\nin the days of his earliest preferment, and who, though she was delighted\r\nto find herself promoted to the society of the big people in the diocese,\r\nhad never quite lifted herself up into their sphere.  Though she had her\r\nideas as to what it was to be a Bishop\'s wife, she had never yet been\r\nquite able to act up to them.\r\n\r\n"I know that young Talbot is to leave," said Mrs. Stantiloup.  "I wrote to\r\nMrs. Talbot immediately when all this occurred, and I\'ve heard from her\r\ncousin Lady Grogram that the boy is not to go back after the holidays."\r\nThis happened to be altogether untrue.  What she probably meant was, that\r\nthe boy should not go back if she could prevent his doing so.\r\n\r\n"I feel quite sure," said Lady Margaret, "that Lady Anne will not allow\r\nher boys to remain when she finds out what sort of inmates the Doctor\r\nchooses to entertain."  The Lady Anne spoken of was Lady Anne Clifford,\r\nthe widowed mother of two boys who were intrusted to the Doctor\'s care.\r\n\r\n"I do hope you\'ll be firm about Gus," said Mrs. Stantiloup to Mrs. Momson.\r\n"If we\'re not to put down this kind of thing, what is the good of having\r\nany morals in the country at all?  We might just as well live like pagans,\r\nand do without any marriage services, as they do in so many parts of the\r\nUnited States."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what the Bishop does think about it?" asked Mrs. Momson of the\r\nBishop\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"It makes him very unhappy; I know that," said Mrs. Rolland.  "Of course\r\nhe cannot interfere about the school.  As for licensing the gentleman as a\r\ncurate, that was of course quite out of the question."\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Momson, the clergyman, and the Bishop came into the\r\nroom, and were offered, as is usual on such occasions, cold tea and the\r\nremains of the buttered toast.  The squire was not there.  Had he been\r\nwith the other gentlemen, Mrs. Stantiloup, violent as she was, would\r\nprobably have held her tongue; but as he was absent, the opportunity was\r\nnot bad for attacking the Bishop on the subject under discussion.  "We\r\nwere talking, my lord, about the Bowick school."\r\n\r\nNow the Bishop was a man who could be very confidential with one lady, but\r\nwas apt to be guarded when men are concerned.  To any one of those present\r\nhe might have said what he thought, had no one else been there to hear.\r\nThat would have been the expression of a private opinion; but to speak\r\nbefore the four would have been tantamount to a public declaration.\r\n\r\n"About the Bowick school?" said he; "I hope there is nothing going wrong\r\nwith the Bowick school."\r\n\r\n"You must have heard about Mr. Peacocke," said Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have certainly heard of Mr. Peacocke.  He, I believe, has left Dr.\r\nWortle\'s seminary."\r\n\r\n"But she remains!" said Mrs. Stantiloup, with tragic energy.\r\n\r\n"So I understand;--in the house; but not as part of the establishment."\r\n\r\n"Does that make so much difference?" asked Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"It does make a very great difference," said Lady Margaret\'s husband, the\r\nparson, wishing to help the Bishop in his difficulty.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see it at all," said Mrs. Stantiloup.  "The main spirit in the\r\nmatter is just as manifest whether the lady is or is not allowed to look\r\nafter the boys\' linen.  In fact, I despise him for making the pretence.\r\nHer doing menial work about the house would injure no one.  It is her\r\npresence there,--the presence of a woman who has falsely pretended to be\r\nmarried, when she knew very well that she had no husband."\r\n\r\n"When she knew that she had two," said Lady Margaret.\r\n\r\n"And fancy, Lady Margaret,--Lady Bracy absolutely asked her to go to\r\nCarstairs!  That woman was always infatuated about Dr. Wortle.  What would\r\nshe have done if they had gone, and this other man had followed his\r\nsister-in-law there.  But Lord and Lady Bracy would ask any one to\r\nCarstairs,--just any one that they could get hold of!"\r\n\r\nMr. Momson was one whose obstinacy was wont to give way when sufficiently\r\nattacked.  Even he, after having been for two days subjected to the\r\neloquence of Mrs. Stantiloup, acknowledged that the Doctor took a great\r\ndeal too much upon himself.  "He does it," said Mrs. Stantiloup, "just to\r\nshow that there is nothing that he can\'t bring parents to assent to.\r\nFancy,--a woman living there as house-keeper with a man as usher,\r\npretending to be husband and wife, when they knew all along that they were\r\nnot married!"\r\n\r\nMr. Momson, who didn\'t care a straw about the morals of the man whose duty\r\nit was to teach his little boy his Latin grammar, or the morals of the\r\nwoman who looked after his little boy\'s waistcoats and trousers, gave a\r\nhalf-assenting grunt.  "And you are to pay," continued Mrs. Stantiloup,\r\nwith considerable emphasis,--"you are to pay two hundred and fifty pounds\r\na-year for such conduct as that!"\r\n\r\n"Two hundred," suggested the squire, who cared as little for the money as\r\nhe did for the morals.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred and fifty,--every shilling of it, when you consider the\r\nextras."\r\n\r\n"There are no extras, as far as I can see.  But then my boy is strong and\r\nhealthy, thank God," said the squire, taking his opportunity of having one\r\nfling at the lady.  But while all this was going on, he did give a\r\nhalf-assent that Gus should be taken away at midsummer, being partly moved\r\nthereto by a letter from the Doctor, in which he was told that his boy was\r\nnot doing any good at the school.\r\n\r\nIt was a week after that that Mrs. Stantiloup wrote the following letter\r\nto her friend Lady Grogram, after she had returned home from Buttercup\r\nHall.  Lady Grogram was a great friend of hers, and was first cousin to\r\nthat Mrs. Talbot who had a son at the school.  Lady Grogram was an old\r\nwoman of strong mind but small means, who was supposed to be potential\r\nover those connected with her.  Mrs. Stantiloup feared that she could not\r\nbe efficacious herself, either with Mr. or Mrs. Talbot; but she hoped that\r\nshe might carry her purpose through Lady Grogram.  It may be remembered\r\nthat she had declared at Buttercup Hall that young Talbot was not to go\r\nback to Bowick.  But this had been a figure of speech, as has been already\r\nexplained:--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR LADY GROGRAM,--Since I got your last letter I have been staying\r\nwith the Momsons at Buttercup.  It was awfully dull.  He and she are, I\r\nthink, the stupidest people that ever I met.  None of those Momsons have\r\nan idea among them.  They are just as heavy and inharmonious as their\r\nname.  Lady Margaret was one of the party.  She would have been better,\r\nonly that our excellent Bishop was there too, and Lady Margaret thought it\r\nwell to show off all her graces before the Bishop and the Bishop\'s wife.\r\nI never saw such a dowdy in all my life as Mrs. Rolland.  He is all very\r\nwell, and looks at any rate like a gentleman.  It was, I take it, that\r\nwhich got him his diocese.  They say the Queen saw him once, and was taken\r\nby his manners.\r\n\r\n"But I did one good thing at Buttercup.  I got Mr. Momson to promise that\r\nthat boy of his should not go back to Bowick.  Dr. Wortle has become quite\r\nintolerable.  I think he is determined to show that whatever he does,\r\npeople shall put up with it.  It is not only the most expensive\r\nestablishment of the kind in all England, but also the worst conducted.\r\nYou know, of course, how all this matter about that woman stands now.  She\r\nis remaining there at Bowick, absolutely living in the house, calling\r\nherself Mrs. Peacocke, while the man she was living with has gone off with\r\nher brother-in-law to look for her husband!  Did you ever hear of such a\r\nmess as that?\r\n\r\n"And the Doctor expects that fathers and mothers will still send their\r\nboys to such a place as that?  I am very much mistaken if he will not find\r\nit altogether deserted before Christmas.  Lord Carstairs is already gone."\r\n[This was at any rate disingenuous, as she had been very severe when at\r\nButtercup on all the Carstairs family because of their declared and\r\nperverse friendship for the Doctor.] "Mr. Momson, though he is quite\r\nincapable of seeing the meaning of anything, has determined to take his\r\nboy away.  She may thank me at any rate for that.  I have heard that Lady\r\nAnne Clifford\'s two boys will both leave."  [In one sense she had heard it,\r\nbecause the suggestion had been made by herself at Buttercup.] "I do hope\r\nthat Mr. Talbot\'s dear little boy will not be allowed to return to such\r\ncontamination as that!  Fancy,--the man and the woman living there in that\r\nway together; and the Doctor keeping the woman on after he knew it all!\r\nIt is really so horrible that one doesn\'t know how to talk about it.  When\r\nthe Bishop was at Buttercup I really felt almost obliged to be silent.\r\n\r\n"I know very well that Mrs. Talbot is always ready to take your advice.\r\nAs for him, men very often do not think so much about these things as they\r\nought.  But he will not like his boy to be nearly the only one left at the\r\nschool.  I have not heard of one who is to remain for certain.  How can it\r\nbe possible that any boy who has a mother should be allowed to remain\r\nthere?\r\n\r\n"Do think of this, and do your best.  I need not tell you that nothing\r\nought to be so dear to us as a high tone of morals.--Most sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n"JULIANA STANTILOUP."\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need not pursue this letter further than to say that when it reached\r\nMr. Talbot\'s hands, which it did through his wife, he spoke of Mrs.\r\nStantiloup in language which shocked his wife considerably, though she was\r\nnot altogether unaccustomed to strong language on his part.  Mr. Talbot\r\nand the Doctor had been at school together, and at Oxford, and were\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI will give now a letter that was written by the Doctor to Mr. Momson in\r\nanswer to one in which that gentleman signified his intention of taking\r\nlittle Gus away from the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR MR. MOMSON,--After what you have said, of course I shall not\r\nexpect your boy back after the holidays.  Tell his mamma, with my\r\ncompliments, that he shall take all his things home with him.  As a rule I\r\ndo charge for a quarter in advance when a boy is taken away suddenly,\r\nwithout notice, and apparently without cause.  But I shall not do so at\r\nthe present moment either to you or to any parent who may withdraw his\r\nson.  A circumstance has happened which, though it cannot impair the\r\nutility of my school, and ought not to injure its character, may still be\r\nheld as giving offence to certain persons.  I will not be driven to alter\r\nmy conduct by what I believe to be foolish misconception on their part.\r\nBut they have a right to their own opinions, and I will not mulct them\r\nbecause of their conscientious convictions.--Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n"If you come across any friend who has a boy here, you are perfectly at\r\nliberty to show him or her this letter."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defection of the Momsons wounded the Doctor, no doubt.  He was aware\r\nthat Mrs. Stantiloup had been at Buttercup, and that the Bishop also had\r\nbeen there--and he could put two and two together; but it hurt him to\r\nthink that one so "staunch" though so "stupid" as Mrs. Momson, should be\r\nturned from her purpose by such a woman as Mrs. Stantiloup.  And he got\r\nother letters on the subject.  Here is one from Lady Anne Clifford.\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAR DOCTOR,--You know how safe I think my dear boys are with you, and\r\nhow much obliged I am both to you and your wife for all your kindness.\r\nBut people are saying things to me about one of the masters at your school\r\nand his wife.  Is there any reason why I should be afraid?  You will see\r\nhow thoroughly I trust you when I ask you the question.--Yours very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n"ANNE CLIFFORD."\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Lady Anne Clifford was a sweet, confiding, affectionate, but not very\r\nwise woman.  In a letter, written not many days before to Mary Wortle, who\r\nhad on one occasion been staying with her, she said that she was at that\r\ntime in the same house with the Bishop and Mrs. Rolland.  Of course the\r\nDoctor knew again how to put two and two together.\r\n\r\nThen there came a letter from Mr. Talbot--\r\n\r\n\r\n"DEAR WORTLE,--So you are boiling for yourself another pot of hot water.\r\nI never saw such a fellow as you are for troubles!  Old Mother Shipton has\r\nbeen writing such a letter to our old woman, and explaining that no boy\'s\r\nsoul would any longer be worth looking after if he be left in your hands.\r\nDon\'t you go and get me into a scrape more than you can help; but you may\r\nbe quite sure of this that if I had as many sons as Priam I should send\r\nthem all to you;--only I think that the cheques would be very long in\r\ncoming.--Yours always,\r\n\r\n"JOHN TALBOT."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctor answered this at greater length than he had done in writing to\r\nMr. Momson, who was not specially his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR TALBOT,--You may be quite sure that I shall not repeat to any one\r\nwhat you have told me of Mother Shipton.  I knew, however, pretty well\r\nwhat she was doing and what I had to expect from her.  It is astonishing\r\nto me that such a woman should still have the power of persuading any\r\none,--astonishing also that any human being should continue to hate as she\r\nhates me.  She has often tried to do me an injury, but she has never\r\nsucceeded yet.  At any rate she will not bend me.  Though my school should\r\nbe broken up to-morrow, which I do not think probable, I should still have\r\nenough to live upon,--which is more, by all accounts, than her unfortunate\r\nhusband can say for himself.\r\n\r\n"The facts are these.  More than twelve months ago I got an assistant\r\nnamed Peacocke, a clergyman, an Oxford man, and formerly a Fellow of\r\nTrinity;--a man quite superior to anything I have a right to expect in my\r\nschool.  He had gone as a Classical Professor to a college in the United\r\nStates;--a rash thing to do, no doubt;--and had there married a widow,\r\nwhich was rasher still.  The lady came here with him and undertook the\r\ncharge of the school-house,--with a separate salary; and an admirable\r\nperson in the place she was.  Then it turned out, as no doubt you have\r\nheard, that her former husband was alive when they were married.  They\r\nought probably to have separated, but they didn\'t.  They came here\r\ninstead, and here they were followed by the brother of the husband,--who I\r\ntake it is now dead, though of that we know nothing certain.\r\n\r\n"That he should have told me his position is more than any man has a right\r\nto expect from another.  Fortune had been most unkind to him, and for her\r\nsake he was bound to do the best that he could with himself.  I cannot\r\nbring myself to be angry with him, though I cannot defend him by strict\r\nlaws of right and wrong.  I have advised him to go back to America and\r\nfind out if the man be in truth dead.  If so, let him come back and marry\r\nthe woman again before all the world.  I shall be ready to marry them and\r\nto ask him and her to my house afterwards.\r\n\r\n"In the mean time what was to become of her?  \'Let her go into lodgings,\'\r\nsaid the Bishop.  Go to lodgings at Broughton!  You know what sort of\r\nlodgings she would get there among psalm-singing greengrocers who would\r\ntell her of her misfortune every day of her life!  I would not subject her\r\nto the misery of going and seeking for a home.  I told him, when I\r\npersuaded him to go, that she should have the rooms they were then\r\noccupying while he was away.  In settling this, of course I had to make\r\narrangements for doing in our own establishment the work which had lately\r\nfallen to her share.  I mention this for the sake of explaining that she\r\nhas got nothing to do with the school.  No doubt the boys are under the\r\nsame roof with her.  Will your boy\'s morals be the worse?  It seems that\r\nGustavus Momson\'s will.  You know the father; do you not?  I wonder\r\nwhether anything will ever affect his morals?\r\n\r\n"Now, I have told you everything.  Not that I have doubted you; but, as\r\nyou have been told so much, I have thought it well that you should have\r\nthe whole story from myself.  What effect it may have upon the school I do\r\nnot know.  The only boy of whose secession I have yet heard is young\r\nMomson.  But probably there will be others.  Four new boys were to have\r\ncome, but I have already heard from the father of one that he has changed\r\nhis mind.  I think I can trace an acquaintance between him and Mother\r\nShipton.  If the body of the school should leave me I will let you know at\r\nonce as you might not like to leave your boy under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n"You may be sure of this, that here the lady remains until her husband\r\nreturns.  I am not going to be turned from my purpose at this time of day\r\nby anything that Mother Shipton may say or do.--Yours always,\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

PUDDICOMBE\'S BOOT.\r\n\r\nIT was not to be expected that the matter should be kept out of the county\r\nnewspaper, or even from those in the metropolis.  There was too much of\r\nromance in the story, too good a tale to be told, for any such hope.  The\r\nman\'s former life and the woman\'s, the disappearance of her husband and\r\nhis reappearance after his reported death, the departure of the couple\r\nfrom St. Louis and the coming of Lefroy to Bowick, formed together a most\r\nattractive subject.  But it could not be told without reference to Dr.\r\nWortle\'s school, to Dr. Wortle\'s position as clergyman of the parish,--and\r\nalso to the fact which was considered by his enemies to be of all the\r\nfacts the most damning, that Mr. Peacocke had for a time been allowed to\r\npreach in the parish church.  The \'Broughton Gazette,\' a newspaper which\r\nwas supposed to be altogether devoted to the interest of the diocese, was\r\nvery eloquent on this subject.  "We do not desire," said the \'Broughton\r\nGazette,\' "to make any remarks as to the management of Dr. Wortle\'s\r\nschool.  We leave all that between him and the parents of the boys who are\r\neducated there.  We are perfectly aware that Dr. Wortle himself is a\r\nscholar, and that his school has been deservedly successful.  It is\r\nadvisable, no doubt, that in such an establishment none should be employed\r\nwhose lives are openly immoral;--but as we have said before, it is not our\r\npurpose to insist upon this.  Parents, if they feel themselves to be\r\naggrieved, can remedy the evil by withdrawing their sons.  But when we\r\nconsider the great power which is placed in the hands of an incumbent of a\r\nparish, that he is endowed as it were with the freehold of his pulpit,\r\nthat he may put up whom he will to preach the Gospel to his parishioners,\r\neven in a certain degree in opposition to his bishop, we think that we do\r\nno more than our duty in calling attention to such a case as this."  Then\r\nthe whole story was told at great length, so as to give the "we" of the\r\n\'Broughton Gazette\' a happy opportunity of making its leading article not\r\nonly much longer, but much more amusing, than usual.  "We must say,"\r\ncontinued the writer, as he concluded his narrative, "that this man should\r\nnot have been allowed to preach in the Bowick pulpit.  He is no doubt a\r\nclergyman of the Church of England, and Dr. Wortle was within his rights\r\nin asking for his assistance; but the incumbent of a parish is responsible\r\nfor those he employs, and that responsibility now rests on Dr. Wortle."\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal in this that made the Doctor very angry,--so angry\r\nthat he did not know how to restrain himself.  The matter had been argued\r\nas though he had employed the clergyman in his church after he had known\r\nthe history.  "For aught I know," he said to Mrs. Wortle, "any curate\r\ncoming to me might have three wives, all alive."\r\n\r\n"That would be most improbable," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"So was all this improbable,--just as improbable.  Nothing could be more\r\nimprobable.  Do we not all feel overcome with pity for the poor woman\r\nbecause she encountered trouble that was so improbable?  How much more\r\nimprobable was it that I should come across a clergyman who had\r\nencountered such improbabilities."  In answer to this Mrs. Wortle could\r\nonly shake her head, not at all understanding the purport of her husband\'s\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nBut what was said about his school hurt him more than what was said about\r\nhis church.  In regard to his church he was impregnable.  Not even the\r\nBishop could touch him,--or even annoy him much.  But this\r\n"penny-a-liner," as the Doctor indignantly called him, had attacked him in\r\nhis tenderest point.  After declaring that he did not intend to meddle\r\nwith the school, he had gone on to point out that an immoral person had\r\nbeen employed there, and had then invited all parents to take away their\r\nsons.  "He doesn\'t know what moral and immoral means," said the Doctor,\r\nagain pleading his own case to his own wife.  "As far as I know, it would\r\nbe hard to find a man of a higher moral feeling than Mr. Peacocke, or a\r\nwoman than his wife."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they ought to have separated when it was found out," said Mrs.\r\nWortle.\r\n\r\n"No, no," he shouted; "I hold that they were right.  He was right to cling\r\nto her, and she was bound to obey him.  Such a fellow as that,"--and he\r\ncrushed the paper up in his hand in his wrath, as though he were crushing\r\nthe editor himself,--"such a fellow as that knows nothing of morality,\r\nnothing of honour, nothing of tenderness.  What he did I would have done,\r\nand I\'ll stick to him through it all in spite of the Bishop, in spite of\r\nthe newspapers, and in spite of all the rancour of all my enemies."  Then\r\nhe got up and walked about the room in such a fury that his wife did not\r\ndare to speak to him.  Should he or should he not answer the newspaper?\r\nThat was a question which for the first two days after he had read the\r\narticle greatly perplexed him.  He would have been very ready to advise\r\nany other man what to do in such a case.  "Never notice what may be\r\nwritten about you in a newspaper," he would have said.  Such is the advice\r\nwhich a man always gives to his friend.  But when the case comes to\r\nhimself he finds it sometimes almost impossible to follow it.  "What\'s the\r\nuse?  Who cares what the \'Broughton Gazette\' says? let it pass, and it\r\nwill be forgotten in three days.  If you stir the mud yourself, it will\r\nhang about you for months.  It is just what they want you to do.  They\r\ncannot go on by themselves, and so the subject dies away from them; but if\r\nyou write rejoinders they have a contributor working for them for nothing,\r\nand one whose writing will be much more acceptable to their readers than\r\nany that comes from their own anonymous scribes.  It is very disagreeable\r\nto be worried like a rat by a dog; but why should you go into the kennel\r\nand unnecessarily put yourself in the way of it?"  The Doctor had said\r\nthis more than once to clerical friends who were burning with indignation\r\nat something that had been written about them.  But now he was burning\r\nhimself, and could hardly keep his fingers from pen and ink.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency he went to Mr. Puddicombe, not, as he said to himself,\r\nfor advice, but in order that he might hear what Mr. Puddicombe would have\r\nto say about it.  He did not like Mr. Puddicombe, but he believed in\r\nhim,--which was more than he quite did with the Bishop.  Mr. Puddicombe\r\nwould tell him his true thoughts.  Mr. Puddicombe would be unpleasant very\r\nlikely; but he would be sincere and friendly.  So he went to Mr.\r\nPuddicombe.  "It seems to me," he said, "almost necessary that I should\r\nanswer such allegations as these for the sake of truth."\r\n\r\n"You are not responsible for the truth of the \'Broughton Gazette,"\' said\r\nMr. Puddicombe.\r\n\r\n"But I am responsible to a certain degree that false reports shall not be\r\nspread abroad as to what is done in my church."\r\n\r\n"You can contradict nothing that the newspaper has said."\r\n\r\n"It is implied," said the Doctor, "that I allowed Mr. Peacocke to preach\r\nin my church after I knew his marriage was informal."\r\n\r\n"There is no such statement in the paragraph," said Mr. Puddicombe, after\r\nattentive reperusal of the article.  "The writer has written in a hurry,\r\nas such writers generally do, but has made no statement such as you\r\npresume.  Were you to answer him, you could only do so by an elaborate\r\nstatement of the exact facts of the case.  It can hardly be worth your\r\nwhile, in defending yourself against the \'Broughton Gazette,\' to tell the\r\nwhole story in public of Mr. Peacocke\'s life and fortunes."\r\n\r\n"You would pass it over altogether?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I would."\r\n\r\n"And so acknowledge the truth of all that the newspaper says."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that the paper says anything untrue," said Mr. Puddicombe,\r\nnot looking the Doctor in the face, with his eyes turned to the ground,\r\nbut evidently with the determination to say what he thought, however\r\nunpleasant it might be.  "The fact is that you have fallen into\r\na--misfortune."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t acknowledge it at all," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"All your friends at any rate will think so, let the story be told as it\r\nmay.  It was a misfortune that this lady whom you had taken into your\r\nestablishment should have proved not to be the gentleman\'s wife.  When I\r\nam taking a walk through the fields and get one of my feet deeper than\r\nusual into the mud, I always endeavour to bear it as well as I may before\r\nthe eyes of those who meet me rather than make futile efforts to get rid\r\nof the dirt and look as though nothing had happened.  The dirt, when it is\r\nrubbed and smudged and scraped is more palpably dirt than the honest mud."\r\n\r\n"I will not admit that I am dirty at all," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Nor do I, in the case which I describe.  I admit nothing; but I let those\r\nwho see me form their own opinion.  If any one asks me about my boot I\r\ntell him that it is a matter of no consequence.  I advise you to do the\r\nsame.  You will only make the smudges more palpable if you write to the\r\n\'Broughton Gazette."\'\r\n\r\n"Would you say nothing to the boys\' parents?" asked the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"There, perhaps, I am not a judge, as I never kept a school;--but I think\r\nnot.  If any father writes to you, then tell him the truth."\r\n\r\nIf the matter had gone no farther than this, the Doctor might probably\r\nhave left Mr. Puddicombe\'s house with a sense of thankfulness for the\r\nkindness rendered to him; but he did go farther, and endeavoured to\r\nextract from his friend some sense of the injustice shown by the Bishop,\r\nthe Stantiloups, the newspaper, and his enemies in general through the\r\ndiocese.  But here he failed signally.  "I really think, Dr. Wortle, that\r\nyou could not have expected it otherwise."\r\n\r\n"Expect that people should lie?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about lies.  If people have told lies I have not seen them\r\nor heard them.  I don\'t think the Bishop has lied."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean the Bishop; though I do think that he has shown a great want\r\nof what I may call liberality towards a clergyman in his diocese."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he thinks you have been wrong.  By liberality you mean sympathy.\r\nWhy should you expect him to sympathise with your wrong-doing?"\r\n\r\n"What have I done wrong?"\r\n\r\n"You have countenanced immorality and deceit in a brother clergyman."\r\n\r\n"I deny it," said the Doctor, rising up impetuously from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Then I do not understand the position, Dr. Wortle.  That is all I can\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"To my thinking, Mr. Puddicombe, I never came across a better man than Mr.\r\nPeacocke in my life."\r\n\r\n"I cannot make comparisons.  As to the best man I ever met in my life I\r\nmight have to acknowledge that even he had done wrong in certain\r\ncircumstances.  As the matter is forced upon me, I have to express my\r\nopinion that a great sin was committed both by the man and by the woman.\r\nYou not only condone the sin, but declare both by your words and deeds\r\nthat you sympathise with the sin as well as with the sinners.  You have no\r\nright to expect that the Bishop will sympathise with you in that;--nor can\r\nit be but that in such a country as this the voices of many will be loud\r\nagainst you."\r\n\r\n"And yours as loud as any," said the Doctor, angrily.\r\n\r\n"That is unkind and unjust," said Mr. Puddicombe.  "What I have said, I\r\nhave said to yourself, and not to others; and what I have said, I have\r\nsaid in answer to questions asked by yourself."  Then the Doctor apologised\r\nwith what grace he could.  But when he left the house his heart was still\r\nbitter against Mr. Puddicombe.\r\n\r\nHe was almost ashamed of himself as he rode back to Bowick,--first,\r\nbecause he had condescended to ask advice, and then because, after having\r\nasked it, he had been so thoroughly scolded.  There was no one whom Mr.\r\nPuddicombe would admit to have been wrong in the matter except the Doctor\r\nhimself.  And yet though he had been so counselled and so scolded, he had\r\nfound himself obliged to apologize before he left the house!  And, too, he\r\nhad been made to understand that he had better not rush into print.\r\nThough the \'Broughton Gazette\' should come to the attack again and again,\r\nhe must hold his peace.  That reference to Mr. Puddicombe\'s dirty boot had\r\nconvinced him.  He could see the thoroughly squalid look of the boot that\r\nhad been scraped in vain, and appreciate the wholesomeness of the\r\nunadulterated mud.  There was more in the man than he had ever\r\nacknowledged before.  There was a consistency in him, and a courage, and\r\nan honesty of purpose.  But there was no softness of heart.  Had there\r\nbeen a grain of tenderness there, he could not have spoken so often as he\r\nhad done of Mrs. Peacocke without expressing some grief at the unmerited\r\nsorrows to which that poor lady had been subjected.\r\n\r\nHis own heart melted with ruth as he thought, while riding home, of the\r\ncruelty to which she had been and was subjected.  She was all alone there,\r\nwaiting, waiting, waiting, till the dreary days should have gone by.  And\r\nif no good news should come, if Mr. Peacocke should return with tidings\r\nthat her husband was alive and well, what should she do then?  What would\r\nthe world then have in store for her?  "If it were me," said the Doctor to\r\nhimself, "I\'d take her to some other home and treat her as my wife in\r\nspite of all the Puddicombes in creation;--in spite of all the bishops."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, though he was a self-asserting and somewhat violent man, was\r\nthoroughly soft-hearted.  It is to be hoped that the reader has already\r\nlearned as much as that;--a man with a kind, tender, affectionate nature.\r\nIt would perhaps be unfair to raise a question whether he would have done\r\nas much, been so willing to sacrifice himself, for a plain woman.  Had Mr.\r\nStantiloup, or Sir Samuel Griffin if he had suddenly come again to life,\r\nbeen found to have prior wives also living, would the Doctor have found\r\nshelter for them in their ignominy and trouble?  Mrs. Wortle, who knew her\r\nhusband thoroughly, was sure that he would not have done so.  Mrs.\r\nPeacocke was a very beautiful woman, and the Doctor was a man who\r\nthoroughly admired beauty.  To say that Mrs. Wortle was jealous would be\r\nquite untrue.  She liked to see her husband talking to a pretty woman,\r\nbecause he would be sure to be in a good humour and sure to make the best\r\nof himself.  She loved to see him shine.  But she almost wished that Mrs.\r\nPeacocke had been ugly, because there would not then have been so much\r\ndanger about the school.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just going up to see her," said the Doctor, as soon as he got\r\nhome,--"just to ask her what she wants."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she wants anything," said Mrs. Wortle, weakly.\r\n\r\n"Does she not?  She must be a very odd woman if she can live there all day\r\nalone, and not want to see a human creature."\r\n\r\n"I was with her yesterday."\r\n\r\n"And therefore I will call to-day," said the Doctor, leaving the room with\r\nhis hat on.\r\n\r\nWhen he was shown up into the sitting-room he found Mrs. Peacocke with a\r\nnewspaper in her hand.  He could see at a glance that it was a copy of the\r\n\'Broughton Gazette,\' and could see also the length and outward show of the\r\nvery article which he had been discussing with Mr. Puddicombe.  "Dr.\r\nWortle," she said, "if you don\'t mind, I will go away from this."\r\n\r\n"But I do mind.  Why should you go away?"\r\n\r\n"They have been writing about me in the newspapers."\r\n\r\n"That was to be expected."\r\n\r\n"But they have been writing about you."\r\n\r\n"That was to have been expected also.  You don\'t suppose they can hurt\r\nme?"  This was a false boast, but in such conversations he was almost\r\nbound to boast.\r\n\r\n"It is I, then, am hurting you?"\r\n\r\n"You;--oh dear, no; not in the least."\r\n\r\n"But I do.  They talk of boys going away from the school."\r\n\r\n"Boys will go and boys will come, but we run on for ever," said the\r\nDoctor, playfully.\r\n\r\n"I can well understand that it should be so," said Mrs. Peacocke, passing\r\nover the Doctor\'s parody as though unnoticed; "and I perceive that I ought\r\nnot to be here."\r\n\r\n"Where ought you to be, then?" said he, intending simply to carry on his\r\njoke.\r\n\r\n"Where indeed!  There is no where.  But wherever I may do least injury to\r\ninnocent people,--to people who have not been driven by storms out of the\r\ncommon path of life.  For this place I am peculiarly unfit."\r\n\r\n"Will you find any place where you will be made more welcome?"\r\n\r\n"I think not."\r\n\r\n"Then let me manage the rest.  You have been reading that dastardly\r\narticle in the paper.  It will have no effect upon me.  Look here, Mrs.\r\nPeacocke;"--then he got up and held her hand as though he were going, but\r\nhe remained some moments while he was still speaking to her,--still\r\nholding her hand;--"it was settled between your husband and me, when he\r\nwent away, that you should remain here under my charge till his return.  I\r\nam bound to him to find a home for you.  I think you are as much bound to\r\nobey him,--which you can only do by remaining here."\r\n\r\n"I would wish to obey him, certainly."\r\n\r\n"You ought to do so,--from the peculiar circumstances more especially.\r\nDon\'t trouble your mind about the school, but do as he desired.  There is\r\nno question but that you must do so.  Good-bye.  Mrs. Wortle or I will\r\ncome and see you to-morrow."  Then, and not till then, he dropped her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Mrs. Wortle did call, though these visits were to her an\r\nintolerable nuisance.  But it was certainly better that she should\r\nalternate the visits with the Doctor than that he should go every day.\r\nThe Doctor had declared that charity required that one of them should see\r\nthe poor woman daily.  He was quite willing that they should perform the\r\ntask day and day about,--but should his wife omit the duty he must go in\r\nhis wife\'s place.  What would all the world of Bowick say if the Doctor\r\nwere to visit a lady, a young and a beautiful lady, every day, whereas his\r\nwife visited the lady not at all?  Therefore they took it turn about,\r\nexcept that sometimes the Doctor accompanied his wife.  The Doctor had\r\nonce suggested that his wife should take the poor lady out in her\r\ncarriage.  But against this even Mrs. Wortle had rebelled.  "Under such\r\ncircumstances as hers she ought not to be seen driving about," said Mrs.\r\nWortle.  The Doctor had submitted to this, but still thought that the\r\nworld of Bowick was very cruel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wortle, though she made no complaint, thought that she was used\r\ncruelly in the matter.  There had been an intention of going into Brittany\r\nduring these summer holidays.  The little tour had been almost promised.\r\nBut the affairs of Mrs. Peacocke were of such a nature as not to allow the\r\nDoctor to be absent.  "You and Mary can go, and Henry will go with you."\r\nHenry was a bachelor brother of Mrs. Wortle, who was always very much at\r\nthe Doctor\'s disposal, and at hers.  But certainly she was not going to\r\nquit England, not going to quit home at all, while her husband remained\r\nthere, and while Mrs. Peacocke was an inmate of the school.  It was not\r\nthat she was jealous.  The idea was absurd.  But she knew very well what\r\nMrs. Stantiloup would say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\'EVERYBODY\'S BUSINESS.\'\r\n\r\nBUT there arose a trouble greater than that occasioned by the \'Broughton\r\nGazette.\' There came out an article in a London weekly newspaper, called\r\n\'Everybody\'s Business,\' which nearly drove the Doctor mad.  This was on\r\nthe last Saturday of the holidays.  The holidays had been commenced in the\r\nmiddle of July, and went on till the end of August.  Things had not gone\r\nwell at Bowick during these weeks.  The parents of all the four\r\nnewly-expected boys had--changed their minds.  One father had discovered\r\nthat he could not afford it.  Another declared that the mother could not\r\nbe got to part with her darling quite so soon as he had expected.  A third\r\nhad found that a private tutor at home would best suit his purposes.\r\nWhile the fourth boldly said that he did not like to send his boy because\r\nof the "fuss" which had been made about Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke.  Had this\r\nlast come alone, the Doctor would probably have resented such a\r\ncommunication; but following the others as it did, he preferred the fourth\r\nman to any of the other three.  "Miserable cowards," he said to himself,\r\nas he docketed the letters and put them away.  But the greatest blow of\r\nall,--of all blows of this sort,--came to him from poor Lady Anne\r\nClifford.  She wrote a piteous letter to him, in which she implored him to\r\nallow her to take her two boys away.\r\n\r\n"My dear Doctor Wortle," she said, "so many people have been telling so\r\nmany dreadful things about this horrible affair, that I do not dare to\r\nsend my darling boys back to Bowick again.  Uncle Clifford and Lord Robert\r\nboth say that I should be very wrong.  The Marchioness has said so much\r\nabout it that I dare not go against her.  You know what my own feelings\r\nare about you and dear Mrs. Wortle; but I am not my own mistress.  They\r\nall tell me that it is my first duty to think about the dear boys\'\r\nwelfare; and of course that is true.  I hope you won\'t be very angry with\r\nme, and will write one line to say that you forgive me.--Yours most\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\n"ANNE CLIFFORD."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn answer to this the Doctor did write as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR LADY ANNE,--Of course your duty is very plain,--to do what you\r\nthink best for the boys; and it is natural enough that you should follow\r\nthe advice of your relatives and theirs.--Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n\r\nHe could not bring himself to write in a more friendly tone, or to tell\r\nher that he forgave her.  His sympathies were not with her.  His\r\nsympathies at the present moment were only with Mrs. Peacocke.  But then\r\nLady Anne Clifford was not a beautiful woman, as was Mrs. Peacocke.\r\n\r\nThis was a great blow.  Two other boys had also been summoned away, making\r\nfive in all, whose premature departure was owing altogether to the\r\nvirulent tongue of that wretched old Mother Shipton.  And there had been\r\nfour who were to come in the place of four others, who, in the course of\r\nnature, were going to carry on their more advanced studies elsewhere.\r\nVacancies such as these had always been pre-occupied long beforehand by\r\nambitious parents.  These very four places had been pre-occupied, but now\r\nthey were all vacant.  There would be nine empty beds in the school when\r\nit met again after the holidays; and the Doctor well understood that nine\r\nbeds remaining empty would soon cause others to be emptied.  It is success\r\nthat creates success, and decay that produces decay.  Gradual decay he\r\nknew that he could not endure.  He must shut up his school,--give up his\r\nemployment,--and retire altogether from the activity of life.  He felt\r\nthat if it came to this with him he must in very truth turn his face to\r\nthe wall and die.  Would it,--would it really come to that, that Mrs.\r\nStantiloup should have altogether conquered him in the combat that had\r\nsprung up between them?\r\n\r\nBut yet he would not give up Mrs. Peacocke.  Indeed, circumstanced as he\r\nwas, he could not give her up.  He had promised not only her, but her\r\nabsent husband, that until his return there should be a home for her in\r\nthe school-house.  There would be a cowardice in going back from his word\r\nwhich was altogether foreign to his nature.  He could not bring himself to\r\nretire from the fight, even though by doing so he might save himself from\r\nthe actual final slaughter which seemed to be imminent.  He thought only\r\nof making fresh attacks upon his enemy, instead of meditating flight from\r\nthose which were made upon him.  As a dog, when another dog has got him\r\nwell by the ear, thinks not at all of his own wound, but only how he may\r\ncatch his enemy by the lip, so was the Doctor in regard to Mrs.\r\nStantiloup.  When the two Clifford boys were taken away, he took some joy\r\nto himself in remembering that Mr. Stantiloup could not pay his butcher\'s\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nThen, just at the end of the holidays, some good-natured friend sent to\r\nhim a copy of \'Everybody\'s Business.\' There is no duty which a man owes to\r\nhimself more clearly than that of throwing into the waste-paper basket,\r\nunsearched and even unopened, all newspapers sent to him without a\r\npreviously-declared purpose.  The sender has either written something\r\nhimself which he wishes to force you to read, or else he has been desirous\r\nof wounding you by some ill-natured criticism upon yourself.  \'Everybody\'s\r\nBusiness\' was a paper which, in the natural course of things, did not find\r\nits way into the Bowick Rectory; and the Doctor, though he was no doubt\r\nacquainted with the title, had never even looked at its columns.  It was\r\nthe purpose of the periodical to amuse its readers, as its name declared,\r\nwith the private affairs of their neighbours.  It went boldly about its\r\nwork, excusing itself by the assertion that Jones was just as well\r\ninclined to be talked about as Smith was to hear whatever could be said\r\nabout Jones.  As both parties were served, what could be the objection?\r\nIt was in the main good-natured, and probably did most frequently gratify\r\nthe Joneses, while it afforded considerable amusement to the listless and\r\nnumerous Smiths of the world.  If you can\'t read and understand Jones\'s\r\nspeech in Parliament, you may at any rate have mind enough to interest\r\nyourself with the fact that he never composed a word of it in his own room\r\nwithout a ring on his finger and a flower in his button-hole.  It may also\r\nbe agreeable to know that Walker the poet always takes a mutton-chop and\r\ntwo glasses of sherry at half-past one.  \'Everybody\'s Business\' did this\r\nfor everybody to whom such excitement was agreeable.  But in managing\r\neverybody\'s business in that fashion, let a writer be as good-natured as\r\nhe may and let the principle be ever so well-founded that nobody is to be\r\nhurt, still there are dangers.  It is not always easy to know what will\r\nhurt and what will not.  And then sometimes there will come a temptation\r\nto be, not spiteful, but specially amusing.  There must be danger, and a\r\nwriter will sometimes be indiscreet.  Personalities will lead to libels\r\neven when the libeller has been most innocent.  It may be that after all\r\nthe poor poet never drank a glass of sherry before dinner in his life,--it\r\nmay be that a little toast-and-water, even with his dinner, gives him all\r\nthe refreshment that he wants, and that two glasses of alcoholic mixture\r\nin the middle of the day shall seem, when imputed to him, to convey a\r\ncharge of downright inebriety.  But the writer has perhaps learned to\r\nregard two glasses of meridian wine as but a moderate amount of\r\nsustentation.  This man is much flattered if it be given to be understood\r\nof him that he falls in love with every pretty woman that he\r\nsees;--whereas another will think that he has been made subject to a foul\r\ncalumny by such insinuation.\r\n\r\n\'Everybody\'s Business\' fell into some such mistake as this, in that very\r\namusing article which was written for the delectation of its readers in\r\nreference to Dr. Wortle and Mrs. Peacocke.  The \'Broughton Gazette\' no\r\ndoubt confined itself to the clerical and highly moral views of the case,\r\nand, having dealt with the subject chiefly on behalf of the Close and the\r\nadmirers of the Close, had made no allusion to the fact that Mrs. Peacocke\r\nwas a very pretty woman.  One or two other local papers had been more\r\nscurrilous, and had, with ambiguous and timid words, alluded to the\r\nDoctor\'s personal admiration for the lady.  These, or the rumours created\r\nby them, had reached one of the funniest and lightest-handed of the\r\ncontributors to \'Everybody\'s Business,\' and he had concocted an amusing\r\narticle,--which he had not intended to be at all libellous, which he had\r\nthought to be only funny.  He had not appreciated, probably, the tragedy\r\nof the lady\'s position, or the sanctity of that of the gentleman.  There\r\nwas comedy in the idea of the Doctor having sent one husband away to\r\nAmerica to look after the other while he consoled the wife in England.\r\n"It must be admitted," said the writer, "that the Doctor has the best of\r\nit.  While one gentleman is gouging the other,--as cannot but be\r\nexpected,--the Doctor will be at any rate in security, enjoying the smiles\r\nof beauty under his own fig-tree at Bowick.  After a hot morning with\r\n\'_tupto_\' in the school, there will be \'amo\' in the cool of the evening."\r\nAnd this was absolutely sent to him by some good-natured friend!\r\n\r\nThe funny writer obtained a popularity wider probably than he had\r\nexpected.  His words reached Mrs. Stantiloup, as well as the Doctor, and\r\nwere read even in the Bishop\'s palace.  They were quoted even in the\r\n\'Broughton Gazette,\' not with approbation, but in a high tone of moral\r\nseverity.  "See the nature of the language to which Dr. Wortle\'s conduct\r\nhas subjected the whole of the diocese!"  That was the tone of the\r\ncriticism made by the \'Broughton Gazette\' on the article in \'Everybody\'s\r\nBusiness.\' "What else has he a right to expect?" said Mrs. Stantiloup to\r\nMrs. Rolland, having made quite a journey into Broughton for the sake of\r\ndiscussing it at the palace.  There she explained it all to Mrs. Rolland,\r\nhaving herself studied the passage so as fully to appreciate the virus\r\ncontained in it.  "He passes all the morning in the school whipping the\r\nboys himself because he has sent Mr. Peacocke away, and then amuses\r\nhimself in the evening by making love to Mr. Peacocke\'s wife, as he calls\r\nher."  Dr. Wortle, when he read and re-read the article, and when the jokes\r\nwhich were made upon it reached his ears, as they were sure to do, was\r\nnearly maddened by what he called the heartless iniquity of the world; but\r\nhis state became still worse when he received an affectionate but solemn\r\nletter from the Bishop warning him of his danger.  An affectionate letter\r\nfrom a bishop must surely be the most disagreeable missive which a parish\r\nclergyman can receive.  Affection from one man to another is not natural\r\nin letters.  A bishop never writes affectionately unless he means to\r\nreprove severely.  When he calls a clergyman his "dear brother in Christ,"\r\nhe is sure to go on to show that the man so called is altogether unworthy\r\nof the name.  So it was with a letter now received at Bowick, in which the\r\nBishop expressed his opinion that Dr. Wortle ought not to pay any further\r\nvisits to Mrs. Peacocke till she should have settled herself down with one\r\nlegitimate husband, let that legitimate husband be who it might.  The\r\nBishop did not indeed, at first, make reference by name to \'Everybody\'s\r\nBusiness,\' but he stated that the "metropolitan press" had taken up the\r\nmatter, and that scandal would take place in the diocese if further cause\r\nwere given.  "It is not enough to be innocent," said the Bishop, "but men\r\nmust know that we are so."\r\n\r\nThen there came a sharp and pressing correspondence between the Bishop and\r\nthe Doctor, which lasted four or five days.  The Doctor, without referring\r\nto any other portion of the Bishop\'s letter, demanded to know to what\r\n"metropolitan newspaper" the Bishop had alluded, as, if any such paper had\r\nspread scandalous imputations as to him, the Doctor, respecting the lady\r\nin question, it would be his, the Doctor\'s, duty to proceed against that\r\nnewspaper for libel.  In answer to this the Bishop, in a note much shorter\r\nand much less affectionate than his former letter, said that he did not\r\nwish to name any metropolitan newspaper.  But the Doctor would not, of\r\ncourse, put up with such an answer as this.  He wrote very solemnly now,\r\nif not affectionately.  "His lordship had spoken of \'scandal in the\r\ndiocese.\' The words," said the Doctor, "contained a most grave charge.  He\r\ndid not mean to say that any such accusation had been made by the Bishop\r\nhimself; but such accusation must have been made by some one at least of\r\nthe London newspapers or the Bishop would not have been justified in what\r\nhe has written.  Under such circumstances he, Dr. Wortle, thought himself\r\nentitled to demand from the Bishop the name of the newspaper in question,\r\nand the date on which the article had appeared."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this there came no written reply, but a copy of the\r\n\'Everybody\'s Business\' which the Doctor had already seen.  He had, no\r\ndoubt, known from the first that it was the funny paragraph about\r\n\'_tupto_\' and "amo" to which the Bishop had referred.  But in the serious\r\nsteps which he now intended to take, he was determined to have positive\r\nproof from the hands of the Bishop himself.  The Bishop had not directed\r\nthe pernicious newspaper with his own hands, but if called upon, could not\r\ndeny that it had been sent from the palace by his orders.  Having received\r\nit, the Doctor wrote back at once as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n"RIGHT REVEREND AND DEAR LORD,--Any word coming from your lordship to me\r\nis of grave importance, as should, I think, be all words coming from a\r\nbishop to his clergy; and they are of special importance when containing a\r\nreproof, whether deserved or undeserved.  The scurrilous and vulgar attack\r\nmade upon me in the newspaper which your lordship has sent to me would not\r\nhave been worthy of my serious notice had it not been made worthy by your\r\nlordship as being the ground on which such a letter was written to me as\r\nthat of your lordship\'s of the 12th instant.  Now it has been invested\r\nwith so much solemnity by your lordship\'s notice of it that I feel myself\r\nobliged to defend myself against it by public action.\r\n\r\n"If I have given just cause of scandal to the diocese I will retire both\r\nfrom my living and from my school.  But before doing so I will endeavour\r\nto prove that I have done neither.  This I can only do by publishing in a\r\ncourt of law all the circumstances in reference to my connection with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Peacocke.  As regards myself, this, though necessary, will be\r\nvery painful.  As regards them, I am inclined to think that the more the\r\ntruth is known, the more general and the more generous will be the\r\nsympathy felt for their position.\r\n\r\n"As the newspaper sent to me, no doubt by your lordship\'s orders, from the\r\npalace, has been accompanied by no letter, it may be necessary that your\r\nlordship should be troubled by a subp[oe]na, so as to prove that the\r\nnewspaper alluded to by your lordship is the one against which my\r\nproceedings will be taken.  It will be necessary, of course, that I should\r\nshow that the libel in question has been deemed important enough to bring\r\ndown upon me ecclesiastical rebuke of such a nature as to make my\r\nremaining in the diocese unbearable,--unless it is shown that that rebuke\r\nwas undeserved."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was consternation in the palace when this was received.  So\r\nstiffnecked a man, so obstinate, so unclerical,--so determined to make\r\nmuch of little!  The Bishop had felt himself bound to warn a clergyman\r\nthat, for the sake of the Church, he could not do altogether as other men\r\nmight.  No doubt certain ladies had got around him,--especially Lady\r\nMargaret Momson,--filling his ears with the horrors of the Doctor\'s\r\nproceedings.  The gentleman who had written the article about the Greek\r\nand the Latin words had seen the truth of the thing at once,--so said Lady\r\nMargaret.  The Doctor had condoned the offence committed by the Peacockes\r\nbecause the woman had been beautiful, and was repaying himself for his\r\nmercy by basking in her loveliness.  There was no saying that there was\r\nnot some truth in this?  Mrs. Wortle herself entertained a feeling of the\r\nsame kind.  It was palpable, on the face of it, to all except Dr. Wortle\r\nhimself,--and to Mrs. Peacocke.  Mrs. Stantiloup, who had made her way\r\ninto the palace, was quite convincing on this point.  Everybody knew, she\r\nsaid, that the Doctor went across, and saw the lady all alone, every day.\r\nEverybody did not know that.  If everybody had been accurate, everybody\r\nwould have asserted that he did this thing every other day.  But the\r\nmatter, as it was represented to the Bishop by the ladies, with the\r\nassistance of one or two clergymen in the Close, certainly seemed to\r\njustify his lordship\'s interference.\r\n\r\nBut this that was threatened was very terrible.  There was a determination\r\nabout the Doctor which made it clear to the Bishop that he would be as bad\r\nas he said.  When he, the Bishop, had spoken of scandal, of course he had\r\nnot intended to say that the Doctor\'s conduct was scandalous; nor had he\r\nsaid anything of the kind.  He had used the word in its proper sense,--and\r\nhad declared that offence would be created in the minds of people unless\r\nan injurious report were stopped.  "It is not enough to be innocent," he\r\nhad said, "but men must know that we are so."  He had declared in that his\r\nbelief in Dr. Wortle\'s innocence.  But yet there might, no doubt, be an\r\naction for libel against the newspaper.  And when damages came to be\r\nconsidered, much weight would be placed naturally on the attention which\r\nthe Bishop had paid to the article.  The result of this was that the\r\nBishop invited the Doctor to come and spend a night with him in the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor went, reaching the palace only just before dinner.  During\r\ndinner and in the drawing-room Dr. Wortle made himself very pleasant.  He\r\nwas a man who could always be soft and gentle in a drawing-room.  To see\r\nhim talking with Mrs. Rolland and the Bishop\'s daughters, you would not\r\nhave thought that there was anything wrong with him.  The discussion with\r\nthe Bishop came after that, and lasted till midnight.  "It will be for the\r\ndisadvantage of the diocese that this matter should be dragged into\r\nCourt,--and for the disadvantage of the Church in general that a clergyman\r\nshould seem to seek such redress against his bishop."  So said the Bishop.\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor was obdurate.  "I seek no redress," he said, "against my\r\nbishop.  I seek redress against a newspaper which has calumniated me.  It\r\nis your good opinion, my lord,--your good opinion or your ill opinion\r\nwhich is the breath of my nostrils.  I have to refer to you in order that\r\nI may show that this paper, which I should otherwise have despised, has\r\nbeen strong enough to influence that opinion."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n"\'AMO\' IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING."\r\n\r\nTHE Doctor went up to London, and was told by his lawyers that an action\r\nfor damages probably would lie.  "\'Amo\' in the cool of the evening,"\r\ncertainly meant making love.  There could be no doubt that allusion was\r\nmade to Mrs. Peacocke.  To accuse a clergyman of a parish, and a\r\nschoolmaster, of making love to a lady so circumstanced as Mrs. Peacocke,\r\nno doubt was libellous.  Presuming that the libel could not be justified,\r\nhe would probably succeed.  "Justified!" said the Doctor, almost\r\nshrieking, to his lawyers; "I never said a word to the lady in my life\r\nexcept in pure kindness and charity.  Every word might have been heard by\r\nall the world."  Nevertheless, had all the world been present, he would\r\nnot have held her hand so tenderly or so long as he had done on a certain\r\noccasion which has been mentioned.\r\n\r\n"They will probably apologise," said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"Shall I be bound to accept their apology?"\r\n\r\n"No; not bound; but you would have to show, if you went on with the\r\naction, that the damage complained of was of so grievous a nature that the\r\napology would not salve it."\r\n\r\n"The damage has been already done," said the Doctor, eagerly.  "I have\r\nreceived the Bishop\'s rebuke,--a rebuke in which he has said that I have\r\nbrought scandal upon the diocese."\r\n\r\n"Rebukes break no bones," said the lawyer.  "Can you show that it will\r\nserve to prevent boys from coming to your school?"\r\n\r\n"It may not improbably force me to give up the living.  I certainly will\r\nnot remain there subject to the censure of the Bishop.  I do not in truth\r\nwant any damages.  I would not accept money.  I only want to set myself\r\nright before the world."  It was then agreed that the necessary\r\ncommunication should be made by the lawyer to the newspaper proprietors,\r\nso as to put the matter in a proper train for the action.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Doctor returned home, just in time to open his school with\r\nhis diminished forces.  At the last moment there was another defaulter, so\r\nthat there were now no more than twenty pupils.  The school had not been\r\nso low as this for the last fifteen years.  There had never been less than\r\neight-and-twenty before, since Mrs. Stantiloup had first begun her\r\ncampaign.  It was heartbreaking to him.  He felt as though he were almost\r\nashamed to go into his own school.  In directing his housekeeper to send\r\nthe diminished orders to the tradesmen he was thoroughly ashamed of\r\nhimself; in giving his directions to the usher as to the re-divided\r\nclasses he was thoroughly ashamed of himself.  He wished that there was no\r\nschool, and would have been contented now to give it all up, and to\r\nconfine Mary\'s fortune to \xa310,000 instead of \xa320,000, had it not been that\r\nhe could not bear to confess that he was beaten.  The boys themselves\r\nseemed almost to carry their tails between their legs, as though even they\r\nwere ashamed of their own school.  If, as was too probable, another\r\nhalf-dozen should go at Christmas, then the thing must be abandoned.  And\r\nhow could he go on as rector of the parish with the abominable empty\r\nbuilding staring him in the face every moment of his life.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are not really going to law," said his wife to him.\r\n\r\n"I must, my dear.  I have no other way of defending my honour."\r\n\r\n"Go to law with the Bishop?"\r\n\r\n"No, not with the Bishop."\r\n\r\n"But the Bishop would be brought into it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he will certainly be brought into it."\r\n\r\n"And as an enemy.  What I mean is, that he will be brought in very much\r\nagainst his own will."\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt about it," said the Doctor.  "But he will have brought it\r\naltogether upon himself.  How he can have condescended to send that\r\nscurrilous newspaper is more than I can understand.  That one gentleman\r\nshould have so treated another is to me incomprehensible.  But that a\r\nbishop should have done so to a clergyman of his own diocese shakes all my\r\nold convictions.  There is a vulgarity about it, a meanness of thinking,\r\nan aptitude to suspect all manner of evil, which I cannot fathom.  What!\r\ndid he really think that I was making love to the woman; did he doubt that\r\nI was treating her and her husband with kindness, as one human being is\r\nbound to treat another in affliction; did he believe, in his heart, that I\r\nsent the man away in order that I might have an opportunity for a wicked\r\npurpose of my own?  It is impossible.  When I think of myself and of him,\r\nI cannot believe it.  That woman who has succeeded at last in stirring up\r\nall this evil against me,--even she could not believe it.  Her malice is\r\nsufficient to make her conduct intelligible;--but there is no malice in\r\nthe Bishop\'s mind against me.  He would infinitely sooner live with me on\r\npleasant terms if he could justify his doing so to his conscience.  He has\r\nbeen stirred to do this in the execution of some presumed duty.  I do not\r\naccuse him of malice.  But I do accuse him of a meanness of intellect\r\nlower than what I could have presumed to have been possible in a man so\r\nplaced.  I never thought him clever; I never thought him great; I never\r\nthought him even to be a gentleman, in the fullest sense of the word; but\r\nI did think he was a man.  This is the performance of a creature not\r\nworthy to be called so."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jeffrey, he did not believe all that."\r\n\r\n"What did he believe?  When he read that article, did he see in it a true\r\nrebuke against a hypocrite, or did he see in it a scurrilous attack upon a\r\nbrother clergyman, a neighbour, and a friend?  If the latter, he certainly\r\nwould not have been instigated by it to write to me such a letter as he\r\ndid.  He certainly would not have sent the paper to me had he felt it to\r\ncontain a foul-mouthed calumny."\r\n\r\n"He wanted you to know what people of that sort were saying."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he wanted me to know that, and he wanted me to know also that the\r\nknowledge had come to me from my bishop.  I should have thought evil of\r\nany one who had sent me the vile ribaldry.  But coming from him, it fills\r\nme with despair."\r\n\r\n"Despair!" she said, repeating his word.\r\n\r\n"Yes; despair as to the condition of the Church when I see a man capable\r\nof such meanness holding so high place.  \'"Amo" in the cool of the\r\nevening!\' That words such as those should have been sent to me by the\r\nBishop, as showing what the \'metropolitan press\' of the day was saying\r\nabout my conduct!  Of course, my action will be against him,--against the\r\nBishop.  I shall be bound to expose his conduct.  What else can I do?\r\nThere are things which a man cannot bear and live.  Were I to put up with\r\nthis I must leave the school, leave the parish;--nay, leave the country.\r\nThere is a stain upon me which I must wash out, or I cannot remain here."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said his wife, embracing him.\r\n\r\n"\'"Amo" in the cool of the evening!\' And that when, as God is my judge\r\nabove me, I have done my best to relieve what has seemed to me the\r\nunmerited sorrows of two poor sufferers!  Had it come from Mrs.\r\nStantiloup, it would, of course, have been nothing.  I could have\r\nunderstood that her malice should have condescended to anything, however\r\nlow.  But from the Bishop!"\r\n\r\n"How will you be the worse?  Who will know?"\r\n\r\n"I know it," said he, striking his breast.  "I know it.  The wound is\r\nhere.  Do you think that when a coarse libel is welcomed in the Bishop\'s\r\npalace, and treated there as true, that it will not be spread abroad among\r\nother houses?  When the Bishop has thought it necessary to send it me,\r\nwhat will other people do,--others who are not bound to be just and\r\nrighteous in their dealings with me as he is?  \'"Amo" in the cool of the\r\nevening!\'"  Then he seized his hat and rushed out into the garden.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had written the paragraph certainly had had no idea that\r\nhis words would have been thus effectual.  The little joke had seemed to\r\nhim to be good enough to fill a paragraph, and it had gone from him\r\nwithout further thought.  Of the Doctor or of the lady he had conceived no\r\nidea whatsoever.  Somebody else had said somewhere that a clergyman had\r\nsent a lady\'s reputed husband away to look for another husband, while he\r\nand the lady remained together.  The joke had not been much of a joke, but\r\nit had been enough.  It had gone forth, and had now brought the whole\r\npalace of Broughton into grief, and had nearly driven our excellent Doctor\r\nmad!  "\'Amo\' in the cool of the evening!"  The words stuck to him like the\r\nshirt of Nessus, lacerating his very spirit.  That words such as those\r\nshould have been sent to him in a solemn sober spirit by the bishop of his\r\ndiocese!  It never occurred to him that he had, in truth, been imprudent\r\nwhen paying his visits alone to Mrs. Peacocke.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the evening, and he wandered away up through the green\r\nrides of a wood the borders of which came down to the glebe fields.  He\r\nhad been boiling over with indignation while talking to his wife.  But as\r\nsoon as he was alone he endeavoured,--purposely endeavoured to rid himself\r\nfor a while of his wrath.  This matter was so important to him that he\r\nknew well that it behoved him to look at it all round in a spirit other\r\nthan that of anger.  He had talked of giving up his school, and giving up\r\nhis parish, and had really for a time almost persuaded himself that he\r\nmust do so unless he could induce the Bishop publicly to withdraw the\r\ncensure which he felt to have been expressed against him.\r\n\r\nAnd then what would his life be afterwards?  His parish and his school had\r\nnot been only sources of income to him.  The duty also had been dear, and\r\nhad been performed on the whole with conscientious energy.  Was everything\r\nto be thrown up, and his whole life hereafter be made a blank to him,\r\nbecause the Bishop had been unjust and injudicious?  He could see that it\r\nwell might be so, if he were to carry this contest on.  He knew his own\r\ntemper well enough to be sure that, as he fought, he would grow hotter in\r\nthe fight, and that when he was once in the midst of it nothing would be\r\npossible to him but absolute triumph or absolute annihilation.  If once he\r\nshould succeed in getting the Bishop into court as a witness, either the\r\nBishop must be crushed or he himself.  The Bishop must be got to say why\r\nhe had sent that low ribaldry to a clergyman in his parish.  He must be\r\nasked whether he had himself believed it, or whether he had not believed\r\nit.  He must be made to say that there existed no slightest reason for\r\nbelieving the insinuation contained; and then, having confessed so much,\r\nhe must be asked why he had sent that letter to Bowick parsonage.  If it\r\nwere false as well as ribald, slanderous as well as vulgar, malicious as\r\nwell as mean, was the sending of it a mode of communication between a\r\nbishop and a clergyman of which he as a bishop could approve?  Questions\r\nsuch as these must be asked him; and the Doctor, as he walked alone,\r\narranging these questions within his own bosom, putting them into the\r\nstrongest language which he could find, almost assured himself that the\r\nBishop would be crushed in answering them.  The Bishop had made a great\r\nmistake.  So the Doctor assured himself.  He had been entrapped by bad\r\nadvisers, and had fallen into a pit.  He had gone wrong, and had lost\r\nhimself.  When cross-questioned, as the Doctor suggested to himself that\r\nhe should be cross-questioned, the Bishop would have to own all this;--and\r\nthen he would be crushed.\r\n\r\nBut did he really want to crush the Bishop?  Had this man been so bitter\r\nan enemy to him that, having him on the hip, he wanted to strike him down\r\naltogether?  In describing the man\'s character to his wife, as he had done\r\nin the fury of his indignation, he had acquitted the man of malice.  He\r\nwas sure now, in his calmer moments, that the man had not intended to do\r\nhim harm.  If it were left in the Bishop\'s bosom, his parish, his school,\r\nand his character would all be made safe to him.  He was sure of that.\r\nThere was none of the spirit of Mrs. Stantiloup in the feeling that had\r\nprevailed at the palace.  The Bishop, who had never yet been able to be\r\nmasterful over him, had desired in a mild way to become masterful.  He had\r\nliked the opportunity of writing that affectionate letter.  That reference\r\nto the "metropolitan press" had slipt from him unawares; and then, when\r\nbadgered for his authority, when driven to give an instance from the\r\nLondon newspapers, he had sent the objectionable periodical.  He had, in\r\npoint of fact, made a mistake;--a stupid, foolish mistake, into which a\r\nreally well-bred man would hardly have fallen.  "Ought I to take advantage\r\nof it?" said the Doctor to himself when he had wandered for an hour or\r\nmore alone through the wood.  He certainly did not wish to be crushed\r\nhimself.  Ought he to be anxious to crush the Bishop because of this\r\nerror?\r\n\r\n"As for the paper," he said to himself, walking quicker as his mind turned\r\nto this side of the subject,--"as for the paper itself, it is beneath my\r\nnotice.  What is it to me what such a publication, or even the readers of\r\nit, may think of me?  As for damages, I would rather starve than soil my\r\nhands with their money.  Though it should succeed in ruining me, I could\r\nnot accept redress in that shape."  And thus having thought the matter\r\nfully over, he returned home, still wrathful, but with mitigated wrath.\r\n\r\nA Saturday was fixed on which he should again go up to London to see the\r\nlawyer.  He was obliged now to be particular about his days, as, in the\r\nabsence of Mr. Peacocke, the school required his time.  Saturday was a\r\nhalf-holiday, and on that day he could be absent on condition of remitting\r\nthe classical lessons in the morning.  As he thought of it all he began to\r\nbe almost tired of Mr. Peacocke.  Nevertheless, on the Saturday morning,\r\nbefore he started, he called on Mrs. Peacocke,--in company with his\r\nwife,--and treated her with all his usual cordial kindness.  "Mrs.\r\nWortle," he said, "is going up to town with me; but we shall be home\r\nto-night, and we will see you on Monday if not to-morrow."  Mrs. Wortle was\r\ngoing with him, not with the view of being present at his interview with\r\nthe lawyer, which she knew would not be allowed, but on the pretext of\r\nshopping.  Her real reason for making the request to be taken up to town\r\nwas, that she might use the last moment possible in mitigating her\r\nhusband\'s wrath against the Bishop.\r\n\r\n"I have seen one of the proprietors and the editor," said the lawyer, "and\r\nthey are quite willing to apologise.  I really do believe they are very\r\nsorry.  The words had been allowed to pass without being weighed.  Nothing\r\nbeyond an innocent joke was intended."\r\n\r\n"I dare say.  It seems innocent enough to them.  If soot be thrown at a\r\nchimney-sweeper the joke is innocent, but very offensive when it is thrown\r\nat you."\r\n\r\n"They are quite aware that you have ground to complain.  Of course you can\r\ngo on if you like.  The fact that they have offered to apologise will no\r\ndoubt be a point in their favour.  Nevertheless you would probably get a\r\nverdict."\r\n\r\n"We could bring the Bishop into court?"\r\n\r\n"I think so.  You have got his letter speaking of the \'metropolitan\r\npress\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes."\r\n\r\n"It is for you to think, Dr. Wortle, whether there would not be a feeling\r\nagainst you among clergymen."\r\n\r\n"Of course there will.  Men in authority always have public sympathy with\r\nthem in this country.  No man more rejoices that it should be so than I\r\ndo.  But not the less is it necessary that now and again a man shall make\r\na stand in his own defence.  He should never have sent me that paper."\r\n\r\n"Here," said the lawyer, "is the apology they propose to insert if you\r\napprove of it.  They will also pay my bill,--which, however, will not, I\r\nam sorry to say, be very heavy."  Then the lawyer handed to the Doctor a\r\nslip of paper, on which the following words were written;--\r\n\r\n"Our attention has been called to a notice which was made in our\r\nimpression of the -- ultimo on the conduct of a clergyman in the diocese\r\nof Broughton.  A joke was perpetrated which, we are sorry to find, has\r\ngiven offence where certainly no offence was intended.  We have since\r\nheard all the details of the case to which reference was made, and are\r\nable to say that the conduct of the clergyman in question has deserved\r\nneither censure nor ridicule.  Actuated by the purest charity he has\r\nproved himself a sincere friend to persons in great trouble."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll put in your name if you wish it," said the lawyer, "or alter it\r\nin any way you like, so that they be not made to eat too much dirt."\r\n\r\n"I do not want them to alter it," said the Doctor, sitting thoughtfully.\r\n"Their eating dirt will do no good to me.  They are nothing to me.  It is\r\nthe Bishop."  Then, as though he were not thinking of what he did, he tore\r\nthe paper and threw the fragments down on the floor.  "They are nothing to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You will not accept their apology?" said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes;--or rather, it is unnecessary.  You may tell them that I have\r\nchanged my mind, and that I will ask for no apology.  As far as the paper\r\nis concerned, it will be better to let the thing die a natural death.  I\r\nshould never have troubled myself about the newspaper if the Bishop had\r\nnot sent it to me.  Indeed I had seen it before the Bishop sent it, and\r\nthought little or nothing of it.  Animals will after their kind.  The wasp\r\nstings, and the polecat stinks, and the lion tears its prey asunder.  Such\r\na paper as that of course follows its own bent.  One would have thought\r\nthat a bishop would have done the same."\r\n\r\n"I may tell them that the action is withdrawn."\r\n\r\n"Certainly; certainly.  Tell them also that they will oblige me by putting\r\nin no apology.  And as for your bill, I would prefer to pay it myself.  I\r\nwill exercise no anger against them.  It is not they who in truth have\r\ninjured me."  As he returned home he was not altogether happy, feeling that\r\nthe Bishop would escape him; but he made his wife happy by telling her the\r\ndecision to which he had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n"IT IS IMPOSSIBLE."\r\n\r\nTHE absence of Dr. and Mrs. Wortle was peculiarly unfortunate on that\r\nafternoon, as a visitor rode over from a distance to make a call,--a\r\nvisitor whom they both would have been very glad to welcome, but of whose\r\ncoming Mrs. Wortle was not so delighted to hear when she was told by Mary\r\nthat he had spent two or three hours at the Rectory.  Mrs. Wortle began to\r\nthink whether the visitor could have known of her intended absence and the\r\nDoctor\'s.  That Mary had not known that the visitor was coming she was\r\nquite certain.  Indeed she did not really suspect the visitor, who was one\r\ntoo ingenuous in his nature to preconcert so subtle and so wicked a\r\nscheme.  The visitor, of course, had been Lord Carstairs.\r\n\r\n"Was he here long?" asked Mrs. Wortle anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Two or three hours, mamma.  He rode over from Buttercup where he is\r\nstaying, for a cricket match, and of course I got him some lunch."\r\n\r\n"I should hope so," said the Doctor.  "But I didn\'t think that Carstairs\r\nwas so fond of the Momson lot as all that."\r\n\r\nMrs. Wortle at once doubted the declared purpose of this visit to\r\nButtercup.  Buttercup was more than half-way between Carstairs and Bowick.\r\n\r\n"And then we had a game of lawn-tennis.  Talbot and Monk came through to\r\nmake up sides."  So much Mary told at once, but she did not tell more\r\ntill she was alone with her mother.\r\n\r\nYoung Carstairs had certainly not come over on the sly, as we may call it,\r\nbut nevertheless there had been a project in his mind, and fortune had\r\nfavoured him.  He was now about nineteen, and had been treated for the\r\nlast twelve months almost as though he had been a man.  It had seemed to\r\nhim that there was no possible reason why he should not fall in love as\r\nwell as another.  Nothing more sweet, nothing more lovely, nothing more\r\nlovable than Mary Wortle had he ever seen.  He had almost made up his mind\r\nto speak on two or three occasions before he left Bowick; but either his\r\ncourage or the occasion had failed him.  Once, as he was walking home with\r\nher from church, he had said one word;--but it had amounted to nothing.\r\nShe had escaped from him before she was bound to understand what he meant.\r\nHe did not for a moment suppose that she had understood anything.  He was\r\nonly too much afraid that she regarded him as a mere boy.  But when he had\r\nbeen away from Bowick two months he resolved that he would not be regarded\r\nas a mere boy any longer.  Therefore he took an opportunity of going to\r\nButtercup, which he certainly would not have done for the sake of the\r\nMomsons or for the sake of the cricket.\r\n\r\nHe ate his lunch before he said a word, and then, with but poor grace,\r\nsubmitted to the lawn-tennis with Talbot and Monk.  Even to his youthful\r\nmind it seemed that Talbot and Monk were brought in on purpose.  They were\r\nboth of them boys he had liked, but he hated them now.  However, he played\r\nhis game, and when that was over, managed to get rid of them, sending them\r\nback through the gate to the school-ground.\r\n\r\n"I think I must say good-bye now," said Mary, "because there are ever so\r\nmany things in the house which I have got to do."\r\n\r\n"I am going almost immediately," said the young lord.\r\n\r\n"Papa will be so sorry not to have seen you."  This had been said once or\r\ntwice before.\r\n\r\n"I came over," he said, "on purpose to see you."\r\n\r\nThey were now standing on the middle of the lawn, and Mary had assumed a\r\nlook which intended to signify that she expected him to go.  He knew the\r\nplace well enough to get his own horse, or to order the groom to get it\r\nfor him.  But instead of that, he stood his ground, and now declared his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"To see me, Lord Carstairs!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Wortle.  And if the Doctor had been here, or your mother, I\r\nshould have told them."\r\n\r\n"Have told them what?" she asked.  She knew; she felt sure that she knew;\r\nand yet she could not refrain from the question.\r\n\r\n"I have come here to ask if you can love me."\r\n\r\nIt was a most decided way of declaring his purpose, and one which made\r\nMary feel that a great difficulty was at once thrown upon her.  She really\r\ndid not know whether she could love him or not.  Why shouldn\'t she have\r\nbeen able to love him?  Was it not natural enough that she should be able?\r\nBut she knew that she ought not to love him, whether able or not.  There\r\nwere various reasons which were apparent enough to her though it might be\r\nvery difficult to make him see them.  He was little more than a boy, and\r\nhad not yet finished his education.  His father and mother would not\r\nexpect him to fall in love, at any rate till he had taken his degree.  And\r\nthey certainly would not expect him to fall in love with the daughter of\r\nhis tutor.  She had an idea that, circumstanced as she was, she was bound\r\nby loyalty both to her own father and to the lad\'s father not to be able\r\nto love him.  She thought that she would find it easy enough to say that\r\nshe did not love him; but that was not the question.  As for being able to\r\nlove him,--she could not answer that at all.\r\n\r\n"Lord Carstairs," she said, severely, "you ought not to have come here\r\nwhen papa and mamma are away."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know they were away.  I expected to find them here."\r\n\r\n"But they ain\'t.  And you ought to go away."\r\n\r\n"Is that all you can say to me?"\r\n\r\n"I think it is.  You know you oughtn\'t to talk to me like that.  Your own\r\npapa and mamma would be angry if they knew it."\r\n\r\n"Why should they be angry?  Do you think that I shall not tell them?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure they would disapprove it altogether," said Mary.  "In fact it\r\nis all nonsense, and you really must go away."\r\n\r\nThen she made a decided attempt to enter the house by the drawing-room\r\nwindow, which opened out on a gravel terrace.\r\n\r\nBut he stopped her, standing boldly by the window.  "I think you ought to\r\ngive me an answer, Mary," he said.\r\n\r\n"I have; and I cannot say anything more.  You must let me go in."\r\n\r\n"If they say that it\'s all right at Carstairs, then will you love me?"\r\n\r\n"They won\'t say that it\'s all right; and papa won\'t think that it\'s right.\r\nIt\'s very wrong.  You haven\'t been to Oxford yet, and you\'ll have to\r\nremain there for three years.  I think it\'s very ill-natured of you to\r\ncome and talk to me like this.  Of course it means nothing.  You are only\r\na boy, but yet you ought to know better."\r\n\r\n"It does mean something.  It means a great deal.  As for being a boy, I am\r\nolder than you are, and have quite as much right to know my own mind."\r\n\r\nHereupon she took advantage of some little movement in his position, and,\r\ntripping by him hastily, made good her escape into the house.  Young\r\nCarstairs, perceiving that his occasion for the present was over, went\r\ninto the yard and got upon his horse.  He was by no means contented with\r\nwhat he had done, but still he thought that he must have made her\r\nunderstand his purpose.\r\n\r\nMary, when she found herself safe within her own room, could not refrain\r\nfrom asking herself the question which her lover had asked her.  "Could\r\nshe love him?"  She didn\'t see any reason why she couldn\'t love him.  It\r\nwould be very nice, she thought, to love him.  He was sweet-tempered,\r\nhandsome, bright, and thoroughly good-humoured; and then his position in\r\nthe world was very high.  Not for a moment did she tell herself that she\r\nwould love him.  She did not understand all the differences in the world\'s\r\nranks quite as well as did her father, but still she felt that because of\r\nhis rank,--because of his rank and his youth combined,--she ought not to\r\nallow herself to love him.  There was no reason why the son of a peer\r\nshould not marry the daughter of a clergyman.  The peer and the clergyman\r\nmight be equally gentlemen.  But young Carstairs had been there in trust.\r\nLord Bracy had sent him there to be taught Latin and Greek, and had a\r\nright to expect that he should not be encouraged to fall in love with his\r\ntutor\'s daughter.  It was not that she did not think herself good enough\r\nto be loved by any young lord, but that she was too good to bring trouble\r\non the people who had trusted her father.  Her father would despise her\r\nwere he to hear that she had encouraged the lad, or as some might say, had\r\nentangled him.  She did not know whether she should not have spoken to\r\nLord Carstairs more decidedly.  But she could, at any rate, comfort\r\nherself with the assurance that she had given him no encouragement.  Of\r\ncourse she must tell it all to her mother, but in doing so could declare\r\npositively that she had given the young man no encouragement.\r\n\r\n"It was very unfortunate that Lord Carstairs should have come just when I\r\nwas away," said Mrs. Wortle to her daughter as soon as they were alone\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma; it was."\r\n\r\n"And so odd.  I haven\'t been away from home any day all the summer\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"He expected to find you."\r\n\r\n"Of course he did.  Had he anything particular to say!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"He had?  What was it, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"I was very much surprised, mamma, but I couldn\'t help it.  He asked\r\nme----"\r\n\r\n"Asked you what, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!"  Here she knelt down and hid her face in her mother\'s lap.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, this is very bad;--very bad indeed."\r\n\r\n"It needn\'t be bad for you, mamma; or for papa."\r\n\r\n"Is it bad for you, my child?"\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; except of course that I am sorry that it should be so."\r\n\r\n"What did you say to him?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I told him that it was impossible.  He is only a boy, and I\r\ntold him so."\r\n\r\n"You made him no promise."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; no!  A promise!  Oh dear no!  Of course it is impossible.  I\r\nknew that.  I never dreamed of anything of the kind; but he said it all\r\nthere out on the lawn."\r\n\r\n"Had he come on purpose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--so he said.  I think he had.  But he will go to Oxford, and will of\r\ncourse forget it."\r\n\r\n"He is such a nice boy," said Mrs. Wortle, who, in all her anxiety, could\r\nnot but like the lad the better for having fallen in love with her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma; he is.  I always liked him.  But this is quite out of the\r\nquestion.  What would his papa and mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"It would be very dreadful to have a quarrel, wouldn\'t it,--and just at\r\npresent, when there are so many things to trouble your papa."  Though Mrs.\r\nWortle was quite honest and true in the feeling she had expressed as to\r\nthe young lord\'s visit, yet she was alive to the glory of having a young\r\nlord for her son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is out of the question, mamma.  It has never occurred to me\r\nfor a moment as otherwise.  He has got to go to Oxford and take his degree\r\nbefore he thinks of such a thing.  I shall be quite an old woman by that\r\ntime, and he will have forgotten me.  You may be sure, mamma, that\r\nwhatever I did say to him was quite plain.  I wish you could have been\r\nhere and heard it all, and seen it all."\r\n\r\n"My darling," said the mother, embracing her, "I could not believe you\r\nmore thoroughly even though I saw it all, and heard it all."\r\n\r\nThat night Mrs. Wortle felt herself constrained to tell the whole story to\r\nher husband.  It was indeed impossible for her to keep any secret from her\r\nhusband.  When Mary, in her younger years, had torn her frock or cut her\r\nfinger, that was always told to the Doctor.  If a gardener was seen idling\r\nhis time, or a housemaid flirting with the groom, that certainly would be\r\ntold to the Doctor.  What comfort does a woman get out of her husband\r\nunless she may be allowed to talk to him about everything?  When it had\r\nbeen first proposed that Lord Carstairs should come into the house as a\r\nprivate pupil she had expressed her fear to the Doctor,--because of Mary.\r\nThe Doctor had ridiculed her fears, and this had been the result.  Of\r\ncourse she must tell the Doctor.  "Oh, dear," she said, "what do you think\r\nhas happened while we were up in London?"\r\n\r\n"Carstairs was here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; he was here.  He came on purpose to make a regular declaration\r\nof love to Mary."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense."\r\n\r\n"But he did, Jeffrey."\r\n\r\n"How do you know he came on purpose."\r\n\r\n"He told her so."\r\n\r\n"I did not think the boy had so much spirit in him," said the Doctor.\r\nThis was a way of looking at it which Mrs. Wortle had not expected.  Her\r\nhusband seemed rather to approve than otherwise of what had been done.  At\r\nany rate, he had expressed none of that loud horror which she had\r\nexpected.  "Nevertheless," continued the Doctor, "he\'s a stupid fool for\r\nhis pains."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that he is a fool," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is.  He is not yet twenty, and he has all Oxford before him.  How\r\ndid Mary behave?"\r\n\r\n"Like an angel," said Mary\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"That\'s of course.  You and I are bound to believe so.  But what did she\r\ndo, and what did she say?"\r\n\r\n"She told him that it was simply impossible."\r\n\r\n"So it is,--I\'m afraid.  She at any rate was bound to give him no\r\nencouragement."\r\n\r\n"She gave him none.  She feels quite strongly that it is altogether\r\nimpossible.  What would Lord Bracy say?"\r\n\r\n"If Carstairs were but three or four years older," said the Doctor,\r\nproudly, "Lord Bracy would have much to be thankful for in the attachment\r\non the part of his son, if it were met by a return of affection on the\r\npart of my daughter.  What better could he want?"\r\n\r\n"But he is only a boy," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s where it is.  And Mary was quite right to tell him that it is\r\nimpossible.  It is impossible.  And I trust, for her sake, that his words\r\nhave not touched her young heart."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Had it been otherwise how could we have been angry with the child?"\r\n\r\nNow this did seem to the mother to be very much in contradiction to that\r\nwhich the Doctor had himself said when she had whispered to him that Lord\r\nCarstairs\'s coming might be dangerous.  "I was afraid of it, as you know,"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n"His character has altered during the last twelve months."\r\n\r\n"I suppose when boys grow into men it is so with them."\r\n\r\n"Not so quickly," said the Doctor.  "A boy when he leaves Eton is not\r\ngenerally thinking of these things."\r\n\r\n"A boy at Eton is not thrown into such society," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"I suppose his being here and seeing Mary every day has done it.  Poor\r\nMary!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she is poor at all," said Mary\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid she must not dream of her young lover."\r\n\r\n"Of course she will not dream of him.  She has never entertained any idea\r\nof the kind.  There never was a girl with less nonsense of that kind than\r\nMary.  When Lord Carstairs spoke to her to-day I do not suppose she had\r\nthought about him more than any other boy that has been here."\r\n\r\n"But she will think now."\r\n\r\n"No;--not in the least.  She knows it is impossible."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless she will think about it.  And so will you."\r\n\r\n"I!"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--why not?  Why should you be different from other mothers?  Why\r\nshould I not think about it as other fathers might do?  It is impossible.\r\nI wish it were not.  For Mary\'s sake, I wish he were three or four years\r\nolder.  But he is as he is, and we know that it is impossible.\r\nNevertheless, it is natural that she should think about him.  I only hope\r\nthat she will not think about him too much."  So saying he closed the\r\nconversation for that night.\r\n\r\nMary did not think very much about "it" in such a way as to create\r\ndisappointment.  She at once realised the impossibilities, so far as to\r\nperceive that the young lord was the top brick of the chimney as far as\r\nshe was concerned.  The top brick of the chimney may be very desirable,\r\nbut one doesn\'t cry for it, because it is unattainable.  Therefore Mary\r\ndid not in truth think of loving her young lover.  He had been to her a\r\nvery nice boy; and so he was still; that;--that, and nothing more.  Then\r\nhad come this little episode in her life which seemed to lend it a gentle\r\ntinge of romance.  But had she inquired of her bosom she would have\r\ndeclared that she had not been in love.  With her mother there was perhaps\r\nsomething of regret.  But it was exactly the regret which may be felt in\r\nreference to the top brick.  It would have been so sweet had it been\r\npossible; but then it was so evidently impossible.\r\n\r\nWith the Doctor the feeling was somewhat different.  It was not quite so\r\nmanifest to him that this special brick was altogether unattainable, nor\r\neven that it was quite at the top of the chimney.  There was no reason why\r\nhis daughter should not marry an earl\'s son and heir.  No doubt the lad\r\nhad been confided to him in trust.  No doubt it would have been his duty\r\nto have prevented anything of the kind, had anything of the kind seemed to\r\nhim to be probable.  Had there been any moment in which the duty had\r\nseemed to him to be a duty, he would have done it, even though it had been\r\nnecessary to caution the Earl to take his son away from Bowick.  But there\r\nhad been nothing of the kind.  He had acted in the simplicity of his\r\nheart, and this had been the result.  Of course it was impossible.  He\r\nacknowledged to himself that it was so, because of the necessity of those\r\nOxford studies and those long years which would be required for the taking\r\nof the degree.  But to his thinking there was no other ground for saying\r\nthat it was impossible.  The thing must stand as it was.  If this youth\r\nshould show himself to be more constant than other youths,--which was not\r\nprobable,--and if, at the end of three or four years, Mary should not have\r\ngiven her heart to any other lover,--which was also improbable,--why,\r\nthen, it might come to pass that he should some day find himself\r\nfather-in-law to the future Earl Bracy.  Though Mary did not think of it,\r\nnor Mrs. Wortle, he thought of it,--so as to give an additional interest\r\nto these disturbed days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PALACE.\r\n\r\nTHE possible glory of Mary\'s future career did not deter the Doctor from\r\nthinking of his troubles,--and especially that trouble with the Bishop\r\nwhich was at present heavy on his hand.  He had determined not to go on\r\nwith his action, and had so resolved because he had felt, in his more\r\nsober moments, that in bringing the Bishop to disgrace, he would be as a\r\nbird soiling its own nest.  It was that conviction, and not any idea as to\r\nthe sufficiency or insufficiency, as to the truth or falsehood, of the\r\neditor\'s apology, which had actuated him.  As he had said to his lawyer,\r\nhe did not in the least care for the newspaper people.  He could not\r\ncondescend to be angry with them.  The abominable joke as to the two verbs\r\nwas altogether in their line.  As coming from them, they were no more to\r\nhim than the ribald words of boys which he might hear in the street.  The\r\noffence to him had come from the Bishop,--and he resolved to spare the\r\nBishop because of the Church.  But yet something must be done.  He could\r\nnot leave the man to triumph over him.  If nothing further were done in\r\nthe matter, the Bishop would have triumphed over him.  As he could not\r\nbring himself to expose the Bishop, he must see whether he could not reach\r\nthe man by means of his own power of words;--so he wrote as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR LORD,--I have to own that this letter is written with feelings\r\nwhich have been very much lacerated by what your lordship has done.  I\r\nmust tell you, in the first place, that I have abandoned my intention of\r\nbringing an action against the proprietors of the scurrilous newspaper\r\nwhich your lordship sent me, because I am unwilling to bring to public\r\nnotice the fact of a quarrel between a clergyman of the Church of England\r\nand his Bishop.  I think that, whatever may be the difficulty between us,\r\nit should be arranged without bringing down upon either of us adverse\r\ncriticism from the public press.  I trust your lordship will appreciate my\r\nfeeling in this matter.  Nothing less strong could have induced me to\r\nabandon what seems to be the most certain means by which I could obtain\r\nredress.\r\n\r\n"I had seen the paper which your lordship sent to me before it came to me\r\nfrom the palace.  The scurrilous, unsavoury, and vulgar words which it\r\ncontained did not matter to me much.  I have lived long enough to know\r\nthat, let a man\'s own garments be as clean as they may be, he cannot hope\r\nto walk through the world without rubbing against those who are dirty.  It\r\nwas only when those words came to me from your lordship,--when I found\r\nthat the expressions which I found in that paper were those to which your\r\nlordship had before alluded as being criticisms on my conduct in the\r\nmetropolitan press,--criticisms so grave as to make your lordship think it\r\nnecessary to admonish me respecting them,--it was only then, I say, that I\r\nconsidered them to be worthy of my notice.  When your lordship, in\r\nadmonishing me, found it necessary to refer me to the metropolitan press,\r\nand to caution me to look to my conduct because the metropolitan press had\r\nexpressed its dissatisfaction, it was, I submit to you, natural for me to\r\nask you where I should find that criticism which had so strongly affected\r\nyour lordship\'s judgment.  There are perhaps half a score of newspapers\r\npublished in London whose animadversions I, as a clergyman, might have\r\nreason to respect,--even if I did not fear them.  Was I not justified in\r\nthinking that at least some two or three of these had dealt with my\r\nconduct, when your lordship held the metropolitan press _in terrorem_ over\r\nmy head?  I applied to your lordship for the names of these newspapers,\r\nand your lordship, when pressed for a reply, sent to me--that copy of\r\n\'Everybody\'s Business.\'\r\n\r\n"I ask your lordship to ask yourself whether, so far, I have overstated\r\nanything.  Did not that paper come to me as the only sample you were able\r\nto send me of criticism made on my conduct in the metropolitan press?  No\r\ndoubt my conduct was handled there in very severe terms.  No doubt the\r\ninsinuations, if true,--or if of such kind as to be worthy of credit with\r\nyour lordship, whether true or false,--were severe, plain-spoken, and\r\ndamning.  The language was so abominable, so vulgar, so nauseous, that I\r\nwill not trust myself to repeat it.  Your lordship, probably, when sending\r\nme one copy, kept another.  Now, I must ask your lordship,--and I must beg\r\nof your lordship for a reply,--whether the periodical itself has such a\r\ncharacter as to justify your lordship in founding a complaint against a\r\nclergyman on its unproved statements, and also whether the facts of the\r\ncase, as they were known to you, were not such as to make your lordship\r\nwell aware that the insinuations were false.  Before these ribald words\r\nwere printed, your lordship had heard all the facts of the case from my\r\nown lips.  Your lordship had known me and my character for, I think, a\r\ndozen years.  You know the character that I bear among others as a\r\nclergyman, a schoolmaster, and a gentleman.  You have been aware how great\r\nis the friendship I have felt for the unfortunate gentleman whose career\r\nis in question, and for the lady who bears his name.  When you read those\r\nabominable words did they induce your lordship to believe that I had been\r\nguilty of the inexpressible treachery of making love to the poor lady\r\nwhose misfortunes I was endeavouring to relieve, and of doing so almost in\r\nmy wife\'s presence?\r\n\r\n"I defy you to have believed them.  Men are various, and their minds work\r\nin different ways,--but the same causes will produce the same effects.\r\nYou have known too much of me to have thought it possible that I should\r\nhave done as I was accused.  I should hold a man to be no less than mad\r\nwho could so have believed, knowing as much as your lordship knew.  Then\r\nhow am I to reconcile to my idea of your lordship\'s character the fact\r\nthat you should have sent me that paper?  What am I to think of the\r\nprocess going on in your lordship\'s mind when your lordship could have\r\nbrought yourself to use a narrative which you must have known to be false,\r\nmade in a newspaper which you knew to be scurrilous, as the ground for a\r\nsolemn admonition to a clergyman of my age and standing?  You wrote to me,\r\nas is evident from the tone and context of your lordship\'s letter, because\r\nyou found that the metropolitan press had denounced my conduct.  And this\r\nwas the proof you sent to me that such had been the case!\r\n\r\n"It occurred to me at once that, as the paper in question had vilely\r\nslandered me, I could redress myself by an action of law, and that I could\r\nprove the magnitude of the evil done me by showing the grave importance\r\nwhich your lordship had attached to the words.  In this way I could have\r\nforced an answer from your lordship to the questions which I now put to\r\nyou.  Your lordship would have been required to state on oath whether you\r\nbelieved those insinuations or not; and, if so, why you believed them.  On\r\ngrounds which I have already explained I have thought it improper to do\r\nso.  Having abandoned that course, I am unable to force any answer from\r\nyour lordship.  But I appeal to your sense of honour and justice whether\r\nyou should not answer my questions;--and I also ask from your lordship an\r\nample apology, if, on consideration, you shall feel that you have done me\r\nan undeserved injury.--I have the honour to be, my lord, your lordship\'s\r\nmost obedient, very humble servant,\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was rather proud of this letter as he read it to himself, and yet a\r\nlittle afraid of it, feeling that he had addressed his Bishop in very\r\nstrong language.  It might be that the Bishop should send him no answer at\r\nall, or some curt note from his chaplain in which it would be explained\r\nthat the tone of the letter precluded the Bishop from answering it.  What\r\nshould he do then?  It was not, he thought, improbable, that the curt note\r\nfrom the chaplain would be all that he might receive.  He let the letter\r\nlie by him for four-and-twenty hours after he had composed it, and then\r\ndetermined that not to send it would be cowardly.  He sent it, and then\r\noccupied himself for an hour or two in meditating the sort of letter he\r\nwould write to the Bishop when that curt reply had come from the chaplain.\r\n\r\nThat further letter must be one which must make all amicable intercourse\r\nbetween him and the Bishop impossible.  And it must be so written as to be\r\nfit to meet the public eye if he should be ever driven by the Bishop\'s\r\nconduct to put it in print.  A great wrong had been done him;--a great\r\nwrong!  The Bishop had been induced by influences which should have had no\r\npower over him to use his episcopal rod and to smite him,--him Dr. Wortle!\r\nHe would certainly show the Bishop that he should have considered\r\nbeforehand whom he was about to smite.  "\'Amo\' in the cool of the\r\nevening!"  And that given as an expression of opinion from the metropolitan\r\npress in general!  He had spared the Bishop as far as that action was\r\nconcerned, but he would not spare him should he be driven to further\r\nmeasures by further injustice.  In this way he lashed himself again into a\r\nrage.  Whenever those odious words occurred to him he was almost mad with\r\nanger against the Bishop.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter had been two days sent, so that he might have had a reply\r\nhad a reply come to him by return of post, he put a copy of it into his\r\npocket and rode off to call on Mr. Puddicombe.  He had thought of showing\r\nit to Mr. Puddicombe before he sent it, but his mind had revolted from\r\nsuch submission to the judgment of another.  Mr. Puddicombe would no doubt\r\nhave advised him not to send it, and then he would have been almost\r\ncompelled to submit to such advice.  But the letter was gone now.  The\r\nBishop had read it, and no doubt re-read it two or three times.  But he\r\nwas anxious that some other clergyman should see it,--that some other\r\nclergyman should tell him that, even if inexpedient, it had still been\r\njustified.  Mr. Puddicombe had been made acquainted with the former\r\ncircumstances of the affair; and now, with his mind full of his own\r\ninjuries, he went again to Mr. Puddicombe.\r\n\r\n"It is just the sort of letter that you would write, as a matter of\r\ncourse," said Mr. Puddicombe.\r\n\r\n"Then I hope that you think it is a good letter?"\r\n\r\n"Good as being expressive, and good also as being true, I do think it."\r\n\r\n"But not good as being wise?"\r\n\r\n"Had I been in your case I should have thought it unnecessary.  But you\r\nare self-demonstrative, and cannot control your feelings."\r\n\r\n"I do not quite understand you."\r\n\r\n"What did it all matter?  The Bishop did a foolish thing in talking of the\r\nmetropolitan press.  But he had only meant to put you on your guard."\r\n\r\n"I do not choose to be put on my guard in that way," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"No; exactly.  And he should have known you better than to suppose you\r\nwould bear it.  Then you pressed him, and he found himself compelled to\r\nsend you that stupid newspaper.  Of course he had made a mistake.  But\r\ndon\'t you think that the world goes easier when mistakes are forgiven?"\r\n\r\n"I did forgive it, as far as foregoing the action."\r\n\r\n"That, I think, was a matter of course.  If you had succeeded in putting\r\nthe poor Bishop into a witness-box you would have had every sensible\r\nclergyman in England against you.  You felt that yourself."\r\n\r\n"Not quite that," said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Something very near it; and therefore you withdrew.  But you cannot get\r\nthe sense of the injury out of your mind, and, therefore, you have\r\npersecuted the Bishop with that letter."\r\n\r\n"Persecuted?"\r\n\r\n"He will think so.  And so should I, had it been addressed to me.  As I\r\nsaid before, all your arguments are true,--only I think you have made so\r\nmuch more of the matter than was necessary!  He ought not to have sent you\r\nthat newspaper, nor ought he to have talked about the metropolitan press.\r\nBut he did you no harm; nor had he wished to do you harm;--and perhaps it\r\nmight have been as well to pass it over."\r\n\r\n"Could you have done so?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine myself in such a position.  I could not, at any rate,\r\nhave written such a letter as that, even if I would; and should have been\r\nafraid to write it if I could.  I value peace and quiet too greatly to\r\nquarrel with my bishop,--unless, indeed, he should attempt to impose upon\r\nmy conscience.  There was nothing of that kind here.  I think I should\r\nhave seen that he had made a mistake, and have passed it over."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, as he rode home, was, on the whole, better pleased with his\r\nvisit than he had expected to be.  He had been told that his letter was\r\nargumentative and true, and that in itself had been much.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week he received a reply from the Bishop, and found that\r\nit was not, at any rate, written by the chaplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR DR. WORTLE," said the reply; "your letter has pained me\r\nexceedingly, because I find that I have caused you a degree of annoyance\r\nwhich I am certainly very sorry I have inflicted.  When I wrote to you in\r\nmy letter,--which I certainly did not intend as an admonition,--about the\r\nmetropolitan press, I only meant to tell you, for your own information,\r\nthat the newspapers were making reference to your affair with Mr.\r\nPeacocke.  I doubt whether I knew anything of the nature of \'Everybody\'s\r\nBusiness.\' I am not sure even whether I had ever actually read the words\r\nto which you object so strongly.  At any rate, they had had no weight with\r\nme.  If I had read them,--which I probably did very cursorily,--they did\r\nnot rest on my mind at all when I wrote to you.  My object was to caution\r\nyou, not at all as to your own conduct, but as to others who were speaking\r\nevil of you.\r\n\r\n"As to the action of which you spoke so strongly when I had the pleasure\r\nof seeing you here, I am very glad that you abandoned it, for your own\r\nsake and for mine, and the sake of all us generally to whom the peace of\r\nthe Church is dear.\r\n\r\n"As to the nature of the language in which you have found yourself\r\ncompelled to write to me, I must remind you that it is unusual as coming\r\nfrom a clergyman to a bishop.  I am, however, ready to admit that the\r\ncircumstances of the case were unusual, and I can understand that you\r\nshould have felt the matter severely.  Under these circumstances, I trust\r\nthat the affair may now be allowed to rest without any breach of those\r\nkind feelings which have hitherto existed between us.--Yours very\r\nfaithfully,\r\n\r\n"C. BROUGHTON."\r\n\r\n\r\n"It is a beastly letter," the Doctor said to himself, when he had read it,\r\n"a beastly letter;" and then he put it away without saying any more about\r\nit to himself or to any one else.  It had appeared to him to be a "beastly\r\nletter," because it had exactly the effect which the Bishop had intended.\r\nIt did not eat "humble pie;" it did not give him the full satisfaction of\r\na complete apology; and yet it left no room for a further rejoinder.  It\r\nhad declared that no censure had been intended, and expressed sorrow that\r\nannoyance had been caused.  But yet to the Doctor\'s thinking it was an\r\nunmanly letter.  "Not intended as an admonition!"  Then why had the Bishop\r\nwritten in that severely affectionate and episcopal style?  He had\r\nintended it as an admonition, and the excuse was false.  So thought the\r\nDoctor, and comprised all his criticism in the one epithet given above.\r\nAfter that he put the letter away, and determined to think no more about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Will you come in and see Mrs. Peacocke after lunch?" the Doctor said to\r\nhis wife the next morning.  They paid their visit together; and after\r\nthat, when the Doctor called on the lady, he was generally accompanied by\r\nMrs. Wortle.  So much had been effected by \'Everybody\'s Business,\' and its\r\nabominations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nWE will now follow Mr. Peacocke for a while upon his journey.  He began\r\nhis close connection with Robert Lefroy by paying the man\'s bill at the\r\ninn before he left Broughton, and after that found himself called upon to\r\ndefray every trifle of expense incurred as they went along.  Lefroy was\r\nvery anxious to stay for a week in town.  It would, no doubt, have been\r\ntwo weeks or a month had his companion given way;--but on this matter a\r\nline of conduct had been fixed by Mr. Peacocke in conjunction with the\r\nDoctor from which he never departed.  "If you will not be guided by me, I\r\nwill go without you," Mr. Peacocke had said, "and leave you to follow your\r\nown devices on your own resources."\r\n\r\n"And what can you do by yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Most probably I shall be able to learn all that I want to learn.  It may\r\nbe that I shall fail to learn anything either with you or without you.  I\r\nam willing to make the attempt with you if you will come along at\r\nonce;--but I will not be delayed for a single day.  I shall go whether you\r\ngo or stay."  Then Lefroy had yielded, and had agreed to be put on board a\r\nGerman steamer starting from Southampton to New York.\r\n\r\nBut an hour or two before the steamer started he made a revelation.  "This\r\nis all gammon, Peacocke," he said, when on board.\r\n\r\n"What is all gammon?"\r\n\r\n"My taking you across to the States."\r\n\r\n"Why is it gammon?"\r\n\r\n"Because Ferdinand died more than a year since;--almost immediately after\r\nyou took her off."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not tell me that at Bowick?"\r\n\r\n"Because you were so uncommon uncivil.  Was it likely I should have told\r\nyou that when you cut up so uncommon rough?"\r\n\r\n"An honest man would have told me the very moment that he saw me."\r\n\r\n"When one\'s poor brother has died, one does not blurt it like that all at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Your poor brother!"\r\n\r\n"Why not my poor brother as well as anybody else\'s?  And her husband too!\r\nHow was I to let it out in that sort of way?  At any rate he is dead as\r\nJulius C\xe6sar.  I saw him buried,--right away at \'Frisco."\r\n\r\n"Did he go to San Francisco?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--we both went there right away from St. Louis.  When we got up to\r\nSt. Louis we were on our way with them other fellows.  Nobody meant to\r\ndisturb you; but Ferdy got drunk, and would go and have a spree, as he\r\ncalled it."\r\n\r\n"A spree, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"But we were off by train to Kansas at five o\'clock the next morning.  The\r\ndevil wouldn\'t keep him sober, and he died of D.T. the day after we got\r\nhim to \'Frisco.  So there\'s the truth of it, and you needn\'t go to New\r\nYork at all.  Hand me the dollars.  I\'ll be off to the States; and you can\r\ngo back and marry the widow,--or leave her alone, just as you please."\r\n\r\nThey were down below when this story was told, sitting on their\r\nportmanteaus in the little cabin in which they were to sleep.  The\r\nprospect of the journey certainly had no attraction for Mr. Peacocke.  His\r\ncompanion was most distasteful to him; the ship was abominable; the\r\nexpense was most severe.  How glad would he avoid it all if it were\r\npossible!  "You know it all as well as if you were there," said Robert,\r\n"and were standing on his grave."  He did believe it.  The man in all\r\nprobability had at the last moment told the true story.  Why not go back\r\nand be married again?  The Doctor could be got to believe it.\r\n\r\nBut then if it were not true?  It was only for a moment that he doubted.\r\n"I must go to \'Frisco all the same," he said.\r\n\r\n"Why so?"\r\n\r\n"Because I must in truth stand upon his grave.  I must have proof that he\r\nhas been buried there."\r\n\r\n"Then you may go by yourself," said Robert Lefroy.  He had said this more\r\nthan once or twice already, and had been made to change his tone.  He\r\ncould go or stay as he pleased, but no money would be paid to him until\r\nPeacocke had in his possession positive proof of Ferdinand Lefroy\'s death.\r\nSo the two made their unpleasant journey to New York together.  There was\r\ncomplaining on the way, even as to the amount of liquor that should be\r\nallowed.  Peacocke would pay for nothing that he did not himself order.\r\nLefroy had some small funds of his own, and was frequently drunk while on\r\nboard.  There were many troubles; but still they did at last reach New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nThen there was a great question whether they would go on direct from\r\nthence to San Francisco, or delay themselves three or four days by going\r\nround by St. Louis.  Lefroy was anxious to go to St. Louis,--and on that\r\naccount Peacocke was almost resolved to take tickets direct through for\r\nSan Francisco.  Why should Lefroy wish to go to St. Louis?  But then, if\r\nthe story were altogether false, some truth might be learned at St. Louis;\r\nand it was at last decided that thither they would go.  As they went on\r\nfrom town to town, changing carriages first at one place and then at\r\nanother, Lefroy\'s manner became worse and worse, and his language more and\r\nmore threatening.  Peacocke was asked whether he thought a man was to be\r\nbrought all that distance without being paid for his time.  "You will be\r\npaid when you have performed your part of the bargain," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see some part of the money at St. Louis," said Lefroy, "or I\'ll know\r\nthe reason why.  A thousand dollars!  What are a thousand dollars?  Hand\r\nout the money."  This was said as they were sitting together in a corner or\r\nseparated portion of the smoking-room of a little hotel at which they were\r\nwaiting for a steamer which was to take them down the Mississippi to St.\r\nLouis.  Peacocke looked round and saw that they were alone.\r\n\r\n"I shall hand out nothing till I see your brother\'s grave," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Not a dollar!  What is the good of your going on like that?  You ought to\r\nknow me well enough by this time."\r\n\r\n"But you do not know me well enough.  You must have taken me for a very\r\ntame sort o\' critter."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I have."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you\'ll change your mind."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall.  It is quite possible that you should murder me.  But\r\nyou will not get any money by that."\r\n\r\n"Murder you.  You ain\'t worth murdering."  Then they sat in silence,\r\nwaiting another hour and a half till the steamboat came.  The reader will\r\nunderstand that it must have been a bad time for Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\nThey were on the steamer together for about twenty-four hours, during\r\nwhich Lefroy hardly spoke a word.  As far as his companion could\r\nunderstand he was out of funds, because he remained sober during the\r\ngreater part of the day, taking only what amount of liquor was provided\r\nfor him.  Before, however, they reached St. Louis, which they did late at\r\nnight, he had made acquaintance with certain fellow-travellers, and was\r\ndrunk and noisy when they got out upon the quay.  Mr. Peacocke bore his\r\nposition as well as he could, and accompanied him up to the hotel.  It was\r\narranged that they should remain two days at St. Louis, and then start for\r\nSan Francisco by the railway which runs across the State of Kansas.\r\nBefore he went to bed Lefroy insisted on going into the large hall in\r\nwhich, as is usual in American hotels, men sit and loafe and smoke and\r\nread the newspapers.  Here, though it was twelve o\'clock, there was still\r\na crowd; and Lefroy, after he had seated himself and lit his cigar, got up\r\nfrom his seat and addressed all the men around him.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a fellow," said he, "has come out from England to find out what\'s\r\nbecome of Ferdinand Lefroy."\r\n\r\n"I knew Ferdinand Lefroy," said one man, "and I know you too, Master\r\nRobert."\r\n\r\n"What has become of Ferdinand Lefroy?" asked Mr. Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone where all the good fellows go," said another.\r\n\r\n"You mean that he is dead?" asked Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"Of course he\'s dead," said Robert.  "I\'ve been telling him so ever since\r\nwe left England; but he is such a d---- unbelieving infidel that he\r\nwouldn\'t credit the man\'s own brother.  He won\'t learn much here about\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Ferdinand Lefroy," said the first man, "died on the way as he was going\r\nout West.  I was over the road the day after."\r\n\r\n"You know nothing about it," said Robert.  "He died at \'Frisco two days\r\nafter we\'d got him there."\r\n\r\n"He died at Ogden Junction, where you turn down to Utah City."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t see him dead," said the other.\r\n\r\n"If I remember right," continued the first man, "they\'d taken him away to\r\nbury him somewhere just there in the neighbourhood.  I didn\'t care much\r\nabout him, and I didn\'t ask any particular questions.  He was a drunken\r\nbeast,--better dead than alive."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been drunk as often as him, I guess," said Robert.\r\n\r\n"I never gave nobody the trouble to bury me at any rate," said the other.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say positively of your own knowledge," asked Peacocke,\r\n"that Ferdinand Lefroy died at that station?"\r\n\r\n"Ask him; he\'s his brother, and he ought to know best."\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said Robert, earnestly, "that we carried him on to \'Frisco,\r\nand there he died.  If you think you know best, you can go to Utah City\r\nand wait there till you hear all about it.  I guess they\'ll make you one\r\nof their elders if you wait long enough."  Then they all went to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear to Mr. Peacocke that the man as to whose life or death he\r\nwas so anxious had really died.  The combined evidence of these men, which\r\nhad come out without any preconcerted arrangement, was proof to his mind.\r\nBut there was no evidence which he could take back with him to England and\r\nuse there as proof in a court of law, or even before the Bishop and Dr.\r\nWortle.  On the next morning, before Robert Lefroy was up, he got hold of\r\nthe man who had been so positive that death had overtaken the poor wretch\r\nat the railway station which is distant from San Francisco two days\'\r\njourney.  Had the man died there, and been buried there, nothing would be\r\nknown of him in San Francisco.  The journey to San Francisco would be\r\nentirely thrown away, and he would be as badly off as ever.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t like to say for certain," said the man when he was\r\ninterrogated.  "I only tell you what they told me.  As I was passing along\r\nsomebody said as Ferdy Lefroy had been taken dead out of the cars on to\r\nthe platform.  Now you know as much about it as I do."\r\n\r\nHe was thus assured that at any rate the journey to San Francisco had not\r\nbeen altogether a fiction.  The man had gone "West," as had been said, and\r\nnothing more would be known of him at St. Louis.  He must still go on upon\r\nhis journey and make such inquiry as might be possible at the Ogden\r\nJunction.\r\n\r\nOn the day but one following they started again, taking their tickets as\r\nfar as Leavenworth.  They were told by the officials that they would find\r\na train at Leavenworth waiting to take them on across country into the\r\nregular San Francisco line.  But, as is not unusual with railway officials\r\nin that part of the world, they were deceived.  At Leavenworth they were\r\nforced to remain for four-and-twenty hours, and there they put themselves\r\nup at a miserable hotel in which they were obliged to occupy the same\r\nroom.  It was a rough, uncouth place, in which, as it seemed to Mr.\r\nPeacocke, the men were more uncourteous to him, and the things around more\r\nunlike to what he had met elsewhere, than in any other town of the Union.\r\nRobert Lefroy, since the first night at St. Louis, had become sullen\r\nrather than disobedient.  He had not refused to go on when the moment came\r\nfor starting, but had left it in doubt till the last moment whether he did\r\nor did not intend to prosecute his journey.  When the ticket was taken for\r\nhim he pretended to be altogether indifferent about it, and would himself\r\ngive no help whatever in any of the usual troubles of travelling.  But as\r\nfar as this little town of Leavenworth he had been carried, and Peacocke\r\nnow began to think it probable that he might succeed in taking him to San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nOn that night he endeavoured to induce him to go first to bed, but in this\r\nhe failed.  Lefroy insisted on remaining down at the bar, where he had\r\nordered for himself some liquor for which Mr. Peacocke, in spite of all\r\nhis efforts to the contrary, would have to pay.  If the man would get\r\ndrunk and lie there, he could not help himself.  On this he was\r\ndetermined, that whether with or without the man, he would go on by the\r\nfirst train;--and so he took himself to his bed.\r\n\r\nHe had been there perhaps half-an-hour when his companion came into the\r\nroom,--certainly not drunk.  He seated himself on his bed, and then,\r\npulling to him a large travelling-bag which he used, he unpacked it\r\naltogether, laying all the things which it contained out upon the bed.\r\n"What are you doing that for?" said Mr. Peacocke; "we have to start from\r\nhere to-morrow morning at five."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to start to-morrow at five, nor yet to-morrow at all, nor\r\nyet next day."\r\n\r\n"You are not?"\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it.  I have had enough of this game.  I am not going\r\nfurther West for any one.  Hand out the money.  You have been told\r\neverything about my brother, true and honest, as far as I know it.  Hand\r\nout the money."\r\n\r\n"Not a dollar," said Peacocke.  "All that I have heard as yet will be of\r\nno service to me.  As far as I can see, you will earn it; but you will\r\nhave to come on a little further yet."\r\n\r\n"Not a foot; I ain\'t a-going out of this room to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Then I must go without you;--that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"You may go and be ----.  But you\'ll have to shell out the money first, old\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"Not a dollar."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly I will not.  How often have I told you so."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall take it."\r\n\r\n"That you will find very difficult.  In the first place, if you were to\r\ncut my throat----"\r\n\r\n"Which is just what I intend to do."\r\n\r\n"If you were to cut my throat,--which in itself will be difficult,--you\r\nwould only find the trifle of gold which I have got for our journey as far\r\nas \'Frisco.  That won\'t do you much good.  The rest is in circular notes,\r\nwhich to you would be of no service whatever."\r\n\r\n"My God," said the man suddenly, "I am not going to be done in this way."\r\nAnd with that he drew out a bowie-knife which he had concealed among the\r\nthings which he had extracted from the bag.  "You don\'t know the sort of\r\ncountry you\'re in now.  They don\'t think much here of the life of such a\r\nskunk as you.  If you mean to live till to-morrow morning you must come to\r\nterms."\r\n\r\nThe room was a narrow chamber in which two beds ran along the wall, each\r\nwith its foot to the other, having a narrow space between them and the\r\nother wall.  Peacocke occupied the one nearest to the door.  Lefroy now\r\ngot up from the bed in the further corner, and with the bowie-knife in his\r\nhand rushed against the door as though to prevent his companion\'s escape.\r\nPeacocke, who was in bed undressed, sat up at once; but as he did so he\r\nbrought a revolver out from under his pillow.  "So you have been and armed\r\nyourself, have you?" said Robert Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Peacocke;--"if you come nearer me with that knife I shall\r\nshoot you.  Put it down."\r\n\r\n"Likely I shall put it down at your bidding."\r\n\r\nWith the pistol still held at the other man\'s head, Peacocke slowly\r\nextracted himself from his bed.  "Now," said he, "if you don\'t come away\r\nfrom the door I shall fire one barrel just to let them know in the house\r\nwhat sort of affair is going on.  Put the knife down.  You know that I\r\nshall not hurt you then."\r\n\r\nAfter hesitating for a moment or two, Lefroy did put the knife down.  "I\r\ndidn\'t mean anything, old fellow," said he.  "I only wanted to frighten\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Well; you have frightened me.  Now, what\'s to come next?"\r\n\r\n"No, I ain\'t;--not frightened you a bit.  A pistol\'s always better than a\r\nknife any day.  Well now, I\'ll tell ye how it all is."  Saying this, he\r\nseated himself on his own bed, and began a long narration.  He would not\r\ngo further West than Leavenworth.  Whether he got his money or whether he\r\nlost it, he would not travel a foot further.  There were reasons which\r\nwould make it disagreeable for him to go into California.  But he made a\r\nproposition.  If Peacocke would only give him money enough to support\r\nhimself for the necessary time, he would remain at Leavenworth till his\r\ncompanion should return there, or would make his way to Chicago, and stay\r\nthere till Peacocke should come to him.  Then he proceeded to explain how\r\nabsolute evidence might be obtained at San Francisco as to his brother\'s\r\ndeath.  "That fellow was lying altogether," he said, "about my brother\r\ndying at the Ogden station.  He was very bad there, no doubt, and we\r\nthought it was going to be all up with him.  He had the horrors there,\r\nworse than I ever saw before, and I hope never to see the like again.  But\r\nwe did get him on to San Francisco; and when he was able to walk into the\r\ncity on his own legs, I thought that, might be, he would rally and come\r\nround.  However, in two days he died;--and we buried him in the big\r\ncemetery just out of the town."\r\n\r\n"Did you put a stone over him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; there is a stone as large as life.  You\'ll find the name on\r\nit,--Ferdinand Lefroy of Kilbrack, Louisiana.  Kilbrack was the name of\r\nour plantation, where we should be living now as gentlemen ought, with\r\nthree hundred niggers of our own, but for these accursed Northern\r\nhypocrites."\r\n\r\n"How can I find the stone?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a chap there who knows, I guess, where all them graves are to be\r\nfound.  But it\'s on the right hand, a long way down, near the far wall at\r\nthe bottom, just where the ground takes a little dip to the north.  It\r\nain\'t so long ago but what the letters on the stone will be as fresh as if\r\nthey were cut yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Does no one in San Francisco know of his death?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s a chap named Burke at Johnson\'s, the cigar-shop in Montgomery\r\nStreet.  He was brother to one of our party, and he went out to the\r\nfuneral.  Maybe you\'ll find him, or, any way, some traces of him."\r\n\r\nThe two men sat up discussing the matter nearly the whole of the night,\r\nand Peacocke, before he started, had brought himself to accede to Lefroy\'s\r\nlast proposition.  He did give the man money enough to support him for two\r\nor three weeks and also to take him to Chicago, promising at the same time\r\nthat he would hand to him the thousand dollars at Chicago should he find\r\nhim there at the appointed time, and should he also have found Ferdinand\r\nLefroy\'s grave at San Francisco in the manner described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n"NOBODY HAS CONDEMNED YOU HERE."\r\n\r\nMRS. WORTLE, when she perceived that her husband no longer called on Mrs.\r\nPeacocke alone, became herself more assiduous in her visits, till at last\r\nshe too entertained a great liking for the woman.  When Mr. Peacocke had\r\nbeen gone for nearly a month she had fallen into a habit of going across\r\nevery day after the performance of her own domestic morning duties, and\r\nremaining in the school-house for an hour.  On one morning she found that\r\nMrs. Peacocke had just received a letter from New York, in which her\r\nhusband had narrated his adventures so far.  He had written from\r\nSouthampton, but not after the revelation which had been made to him there\r\nas to the death of Ferdinand.  He might have so done, but the information\r\ngiven to him had, at the spur of the moment, seemed to be so doubtful that\r\nhe had refrained.  Then he had been able to think of it all during the\r\nvoyage, and from New York he had written at great length, detailing\r\neverything.  Mrs. Peacocke did not actually read out loud the letter,\r\nwhich was full of such terms of affection as are common between man and\r\nwife, knowing that her title to be called a wife was not admitted by Mrs.\r\nWortle; but she read much of it, and told all the circumstances as they\r\nwere related.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Mrs. Wortle, "he certainly is--no more."  There came a\r\ncertain accession of sadness to her voice, as she reflected that,\r\nafter all, she was talking to this woman of the death of her undoubted\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is dead--at last."  Mrs. Wortle uttered a deep sigh.  It was\r\ndreadful to her to think that a woman should speak in that way of the\r\ndeath of her husband.  "I know all that is going on in your mind," said\r\nMrs. Peacocke, looking up into her face.\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"Every thought.  You are telling yourself how terrible it is that a woman\r\nshould speak of the death of her husband without a tear in her eye,\r\nwithout a sob,--without one word of sorrow."\r\n\r\n"It is very sad."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is sad.  Has it not all been sad?  But what would you have\r\nme do?  It is not because he was always bad to me,--because he marred all\r\nmy early life, making it so foul a blotch that I hardly dare to look back\r\nupon it from the quietness and comparative purity of these latter days.\r\nIt is not because he has so treated me as to make me feel that it has been\r\na misfortune to me to be born, that I now receive these tidings with joy.\r\nIt is because of him who has always been good to me as the other was bad,\r\nwho has made me wonder at the noble instincts of a man, as the other has\r\nmade me shudder at his possible meanness."\r\n\r\n"It has been very hard upon you," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"And hard upon him, who is dearer to me than my own soul.  Think of his\r\nconduct to me!  How he went away to ascertain the truth when he first\r\nheard tidings which made him believe that I was free to become his!  How\r\nhe must have loved me then, when, after all my troubles, he took me to\r\nhimself at the first moment that was possible!  Think, too, what he has\r\ndone for me since,----and I for him!  How I have marred his life, while he\r\nhas striven to repair mine!  Do I not owe him everything?"\r\n\r\n"Everything," said Mrs. Wortle,--"except to do what is wrong."\r\n\r\n"I did do what was wrong.  Would not you have done so under such\r\ncircumstances?  Would not you have obeyed the man who had been to you so\r\ntrue a husband while he believed himself entitled to the name?  Wrong!  I\r\ndoubt whether it was wrong.  It is hard to know sometimes what is right\r\nand what is wrong.  What he told me to do, that to me was right.  Had he\r\ntold me to go away and leave him, I should have gone,--and have died.  I\r\nsuppose that would have been right."  She paused as though she expected an\r\nanswer.  But the subject was so difficult that Mrs. Wortle was unable to\r\nmake one.  "I have sometimes wished that he had done so.  But as I think\r\nof it when I am alone, I feel how impossible that would have been to him.\r\nHe could not have sent me away.  That which you call right would have been\r\nimpossible to him whom I regard as the most perfect of human beings.  As\r\nfar as I know him, he is faultless;--and yet, according to your judgment,\r\nhe has committed a sin so deep that he must stand disgraced before the\r\neyes of all men."\r\n\r\n"I have not said so."\r\n\r\n"It comes to that.  I know how good you are; how much I owe to you.  I\r\nknow that Dr. Wortle and yourself have been so kind to us, that were I not\r\ngrateful beyond expression I should be the meanest human creature.  Do not\r\nsuppose that I am angry or vexed with you because you condemn me.  It is\r\nnecessary that you should do so.  But how can I condemn myself;--or how\r\ncan I condemn him?"\r\n\r\n"If you are both free now, it may be made right."\r\n\r\n"But how about repentance?  Will it be all right though I shall not have\r\nrepented?  I will never repent.  There are laws in accordance with which I\r\nwill admit that I have done wrong; but had I not broken those laws when he\r\nbade me, I should have hated myself through all my life afterwards."\r\n\r\n"It was very different."\r\n\r\n"If you could know, Mrs. Wortle, how difficult it would have been to go\r\naway and leave him!  It was not till he came to me and told me that he was\r\ngoing down to Texas, to see how it had been with my husband, that I ever\r\nknew what it was to love a man.  He had never said a word.  He tried not\r\nto look it.  But I knew that I had his heart and that he had mine.  From\r\nthat moment I have thought of him day and night.  When I gave him my hand\r\nthen as he parted from me, I gave it him as his own.  It has been his to\r\ndo what he liked with it ever since, let who might live or who might die.\r\nOught I not to rejoice that he is dead?"  Mrs. Wortle could not answer the\r\nquestion.  She could only shudder.  "It was not by any will of my own,"\r\ncontinued the eager woman, "that I married Ferdinand Lefroy.  Everything\r\nin our country was then destroyed.  All that we loved and all that we\r\nvalued had been taken away from us.  War had destroyed everything.  When I\r\nwas just springing out of childhood, we were ruined.  We had to go, all of\r\nus; women as well as men, girls as well as boys;--and be something else\r\nthan we had been.  I was told to marry him."\r\n\r\n"That was wrong."\r\n\r\n"When everything is in ruin about you, what room is there for ordinary\r\nwell-doing?  It seemed then that he would have some remnant of property.\r\nOur fathers had known each other long.  The wretched man whom drink\r\nafterwards made so vile might have been as good a gentleman as another, if\r\nthings had gone well with him.  He could not have been a hero like him\r\nwhom I will always call my husband; but it is not given to every man to be\r\na hero."\r\n\r\n"Was he bad always from the first?"\r\n\r\n"He always drank,--from his wedding-day; and then Robert was with him, who\r\nwas worse than he.  Between them they were very bad.  My life was a burden\r\nto me.  It was terrible.  It was a comfort to me even to be deserted and\r\nto be left.  Then came this Englishman in my way; and it seemed to me, on\r\na sudden, that the very nature of mankind was altered.  He did not lie\r\nwhen he spoke.  He was never debased by drink.  He had other care than for\r\nhimself.  For himself, I think, he never cared.  Since he has been here,\r\nin the school, have you found any cause of fault in him?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! nor ever will;--unless it be a fault to love a woman as he\r\nloves me.  See what he is doing now,--where he has gone,--what he has to\r\nsuffer, coupled as he is with that wretch!  And all for my sake!"\r\n\r\n"For both your sakes."\r\n\r\n"He would have been none the worse had he chosen to part with me.  He was\r\nin no trouble.  I was not his wife; and he need only--bid me go.  There\r\nwould have been no sin with him then,--no wrong.  Had he followed out your\r\nright and your wrong, and told me that, as we could not be man and wife,\r\nwe must just part, he would have been in no trouble;--would he?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it would have been then," said Mrs. Wortle, who was by\r\nthis time sobbing aloud in tears.\r\n\r\n"No; nor I, nor I.  I should have been dead;--but he?  He is a sinner now,\r\nso that he may not preach in your churches, or teach in your schools; so\r\nthat your dear husband has to be ruined almost because he has been kind to\r\nhim.  He then might have preached in any church,--have taught in any\r\nschool.  What am I to think that God will think of it?  Will God condemn\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"We must leave that to Him," sobbed Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but in thinking of our souls we must reflect a little as to what we\r\nbelieve to be probable.  He, you say, has sinned,--is sinning still in\r\ncalling me his wife.  Am I not to believe that if he were called to his\r\nlong account he would stand there pure and bright, in glorious\r\ngarments,--one fit for heaven, because he has loved others better than he\r\nhas loved himself, because he has done to others as he might have wished\r\nthat they should do to him?  I do believe it!  Believe!  I know it.  And\r\nif so, what am I to think of his sin, or of my own?  Not to obey him, not\r\nto love him, not to do in everything as he counsels me,--that, to me,\r\nwould be sin.  To the best of my conscience he is my husband and my\r\nmaster.  I will not go into the rooms of such as you, Mrs. Wortle, good\r\nand kind as you are; but it is not because I do not think myself fit.  It\r\nis because I will not injure you in the estimation of those who do not\r\nknow what is fit and what is unfit.  I am not ashamed of myself.  I owe it\r\nto him to blush for nothing that he has caused me to do.  I have but two\r\njudges,--the Lord in heaven, and he, my husband, upon earth."\r\n\r\n"Nobody has condemned you here."\r\n\r\n"Yes;--they have condemned me.  But I am not angry at that.  You do not\r\nthink, Mrs. Wortle, that I can be angry with you,--so kind as you have\r\nbeen, so generous, so forgiving;--the more kind because you think that we\r\nare determined, headstrong sinners?  Oh no!  It is natural that you should\r\nthink so,--but I think differently.  Circumstances have so placed me that\r\nthey have made me unfit for your society.  If I had no decent gown to\r\nwear, or shoes to my feet, I should be unfit also;--but not on that\r\naccount disgraced in my own estimation.  I comfort myself by thinking that\r\nI cannot be altogether bad when a man such as he has loved me and does\r\nlove me."\r\n\r\nThe two women, when they parted on that morning, kissed each other, which\r\nthey had not done before; and Mrs. Wortle had been made to doubt whether,\r\nafter all, the sin had been so very sinful.  She did endeavour to ask\r\nherself whether she would not have done the same in the same\r\ncircumstances.  The woman, she thought, must have been right to have\r\nmarried the man whom she loved, when she heard that that first horrid\r\nhusband was dead.  There could, at any rate, have been no sin in that.\r\nAnd then, what ought she to have done when the dead man,--dead as he was\r\nsupposed to have been,--burst into her room?  Mrs. Wortle,--who found it\r\nindeed extremely difficult to imagine herself to be in such a\r\nposition,--did at last acknowledge that, in such circumstances, she\r\ncertainly would have done whatever Dr. Wortle had told her.  She could not\r\nbring it nearer to herself than that.  She could not suggest to herself\r\ntwo men as her own husbands.  She could not imagine that the Doctor had\r\nbeen either the bad husband, who had unexpectedly come to life,--or the\r\ngood husband, who would not, in truth, be her husband at all; but she did\r\ndetermine, in her own mind, that, however all that might have been, she\r\nwould clearly have done whatever the Doctor told her.  She would have\r\nsworn to obey him, even though, when swearing, she should not have really\r\nmarried him.  It was terrible to think of,--so terrible that she could not\r\nquite think of it; but in struggling to think of it her heart was softened\r\ntowards this other woman.  After that day she never spoke further of the\r\nwoman\'s sin.\r\n\r\nOf course she told it all to the Doctor,--not indeed explaining the\r\nworking of her own mind as to that suggestion that he should have been, in\r\nhis first condition, a very bad man, and have been reported dead, and have\r\ncome again, in a second shape, as a good man.  She kept that to herself.\r\nBut she did endeavour to describe the effect upon herself of the\r\ndescription the woman had given her of her own conduct.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite know how she could have done otherwise," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Nor I either; I have always said so."\r\n\r\n"It would have been so very hard to go away, when he told her not."\r\n\r\n"It would have been very hard to go away," said the Doctor, "if he had\r\ntold her to do so.  Where was she to go?  What was she to do?  They had\r\nbeen brought together by circumstances, in such a manner that it was, so\r\nto say, impossible that they should part.  It is not often that one comes\r\nacross events like these, so altogether out of the ordinary course that\r\nthe common rules of life seem to be insufficient for guidance.  To most of\r\nus it never happens; and it is better for us that it should not happen.\r\nBut when it does, one is forced to go beyond the common rules.  It is that\r\nfeeling which has made me give them my protection.  It has been a great\r\nmisfortune; but, placed as I was, I could not help myself.  I could not\r\nturn them out.  It was clearly his duty to go, and almost as clearly mine\r\nto give her shelter till he should come back."\r\n\r\n"A great misfortune, Jeffrey?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so.  Look at this."  Then he handed to her a letter from a\r\nnobleman living at a great distance,--at a distance so great that Mrs.\r\nStantiloup would hardly have reached him there,--expressing his intention\r\nto withdraw his two boys from the school at Christmas.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t give this as a reason."\r\n\r\n"No; we are not acquainted with each other personally, and he could hardly\r\nhave alluded to my conduct in this matter.  It was easier for him to give\r\na mere notice such as this.  But not the less do I understand it.  The\r\nintention was that the elder Mowbray should remain for another year, and\r\nthe younger for two years.  Of course he is at liberty to change his mind;\r\nnor do I feel myself entitled to complain.  A school such as mine must\r\ndepend on the credit of the establishment.  He has heard, no doubt,\r\nsomething of the story which has injured our credit, and it is natural\r\nthat he should take the boys away."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that the school will be put an end to?"\r\n\r\n"It looks very like it."\r\n\r\n"Altogether?"\r\n\r\n"I shall not care to drag it on as a failure.  I am too old now to begin\r\nagain with a new attempt if this collapses.  I have no offers to fill up\r\nthe vacancies.  The parents of those who remain, of course, will know how\r\nit is going with the school.  I shall not be disposed to let it die of\r\nitself.  My idea at present is to carry it on without saying anything till\r\nthe Christmas holidays, and then to give notice to the parents that the\r\nestablishment will be closed at Midsummer."\r\n\r\n"Will it make you very unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"No doubt it will.  A man does not like to fail.  I am not sure but what I\r\nam less able to bear such failure than most men."\r\n\r\n"But you have sometimes thought of giving it up."\r\n\r\n"Have I?  I have not known it.  Why should I give it up?  Why should any\r\nman give up a profession while he has health and strength to carry it on?"\r\n\r\n"You have another."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it is not the one to which my energies have been chiefly\r\napplied.  The work of a parish such as this can be done by one person.  I\r\nhave always had a curate.  It is, moreover, nonsense to say that a man\r\ndoes not care most for that by which he makes his money.  I am to give up\r\nover \xa32000 a-year, which I have had not a trouble but a delight in making!\r\nIt is like coming to the end of one\'s life."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jeffrey!"\r\n\r\n"It has to be looked in the face, you know."\r\n\r\n"I wish,--I wish they had never come."\r\n\r\n"What is the good of wishing?  They came, and according to my way of\r\nthinking I did my duty by them.  Much as I am grieved by this, I protest\r\nthat I would do the same again were it again to be done.  Do you think\r\nthat I would be deterred from what I thought to be right by the\r\nmachinations of a she-dragon such as that?"\r\n\r\n"Has she done it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I think so," said the Doctor, after some little hesitation.  "I\r\nthink it has been, in truth, her doing.  There has been a grand\r\nopportunity for slander, and she has used it with uncommon skill.  It was\r\na wonderful chance in her favour.  She has been enabled without actual\r\nlies,--lies which could be proved to be lies,--to spread abroad reports\r\nwhich have been absolutely damning.  And she has succeeded in getting hold\r\nof the very people through whom she could injure me.  Of course all this\r\ncorrespondence with the Bishop has helped.  The Bishop hasn\'t kept it as a\r\nsecret.  Why should he?"\r\n\r\n"The Bishop has had nothing to do with the school," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"No; but the things have been mixed up together.  Do you think it would\r\nhave no effect with such a woman as Lady Anne Clifford, to be told that\r\nthe Bishop had censured my conduct severely?  If it had not been for Mrs.\r\nStantiloup, the Bishop would have heard nothing about it.  It is her\r\ndoing.  And it pains me to feel that I have to give her credit for her\r\nskill and her energy."\r\n\r\n"Her wickedness, you mean."\r\n\r\n"What does it signify whether she has been wicked or not in this matter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jeffrey!"\r\n\r\n"Her wickedness is a matter of course.  We all knew that beforehand.  If a\r\nperson has to be wicked, it is a great thing for him to be successful in\r\nhis wickedness.  He would have to pay the final penalty even if he failed.\r\nTo be wicked and to do nothing is to be mean all round.  I am afraid that\r\nMrs. Stantiloup will have succeeded in her wickedness."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLORD BRACY\'S LETTER.\r\n\r\nTHE school and the parish went on through August and September, and up to\r\nthe middle of October, very quietly.  The quarrel between the Bishop and\r\nthe Doctor had altogether subsided.  People in the diocese had ceased to\r\ntalk continually of Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke.  There was still alive a\r\ncertain interest as to what might be the ultimate fate of the poor lady;\r\nbut other matters had come up, and she no longer formed the one topic of\r\nconversation at all meetings.  The twenty boys at the school felt that, as\r\ntheir numbers had been diminished, so also had their reputation.  They\r\nwere less loud, and, as other boys would have said of them, less "cocky"\r\nthan of yore.  But they ate and drank and played, and, let us hope, learnt\r\ntheir lessons as usual.  Mrs. Peacocke had from time to time received\r\nletters from her husband, the last up to the time of which we speak having\r\nbeen written at the Ogden Junction, at which Mr. Peacocke had stopped for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours with the object of making inquiry as to the\r\nstatement made to him at St. Louis.  Here he learned enough to convince\r\nhim that Robert Lefroy had told him the truth in regard to what had there\r\noccurred.  The people about the station still remembered the condition of\r\nthe man who had been taken out of the car when suffering from delirium\r\ntremens; and remembered also that the man had not died there, but had been\r\ncarried on by the next train to San Francisco.  One of the porters also\r\ndeclared that he had heard a few days afterwards that the sufferer had\r\ndied almost immediately on his arrival at San Francisco.  Information as\r\nfar as this Mr. Peacocke had sent home to his wife, and had added his firm\r\nbelief that he should find the man\'s grave in the cemetery, and be able to\r\nbring home with him testimony to which no authority in England, whether\r\nsocial, episcopal, or judicial, would refuse to give credit.\r\n\r\n"Of course he will be married again," said Mrs. Wortle to her husband.\r\n\r\n"They shall be married here, and I will perform the ceremony.  I don\'t\r\nthink the Bishop himself would object to that; and I shouldn\'t care a\r\nstraw if he did."\r\n\r\n"Will he go on with the school?" whispered Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"Will the school go on?  If the school goes on, he will go on, I suppose.\r\nAbout that you had better ask Mrs. Stantiloup."\r\n\r\n"I will ask nobody but you," said the wife, putting up her face to kiss\r\nhim.  As this was going on, everything was said to comfort Mrs. Peacocke,\r\nand to give her hopes of new life.  Mrs. Wortle told her how the Doctor\r\nhad promised that he himself would marry them as soon as the forms of the\r\nChurch and the legal requisitions would allow.  Mrs. Peacocke accepted all\r\nthat was said to her quietly and thankfully, but did not again allow\r\nherself to be roused to such excitement as she had shown on the one\r\noccasion recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the Doctor received a letter which greatly\r\naffected his mode of thought at the time.  He had certainly become hipped\r\nand low-spirited, if not despondent, and clearly showed to his wife, even\r\nthough he was silent, that his mind was still intent on the injury which\r\nthat wretched woman had done him by her virulence.  But the letter of\r\nwhich we speak for a time removed this feeling, and gave him, as it were,\r\na new life.  The letter, which was from Lord Bracy, was as follows;--\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR DOCTOR WORTLE.--Carstairs left us for Oxford yesterday, and\r\nbefore he went, startled his mother and me considerably by a piece of\r\ninformation.  He tells us that he is over head and ears in love with your\r\ndaughter.  The communication was indeed made three days ago, but I told\r\nhim that I should take a day or two to think of it before I wrote to you.\r\nHe was very anxious, when he told me, to go off at once to Bowick, and to\r\nsee you and your wife, and of course the young lady;--but this I stopped\r\nby the exercise of somewhat peremptory parental authority.  Then he\r\ninformed me that he had been to Bowick, and had found his lady-love at\r\nhome, you and Mrs. Wortle having by chance been absent at the time.  It\r\nseems that he declared himself to the young lady, who, in the exercise of\r\na wise discretion, ran away from him and left him planted on the terrace.\r\nThat is his account of what passed, and I do not in the least doubt its\r\nabsolute truth.  It is at any rate quite clear, from his own showing, that\r\nthe young lady gave him no encouragement.\r\n\r\n"Such having been the case, I do not think that I should have found it\r\nnecessary to write to you at all had not Carstairs persevered with me till\r\nI promised to do so.  He was willing, he said, not to go to Bowick on\r\ncondition that I would write to you on the subject.  The meaning of this\r\nis, that had he not been very much in earnest, I should have considered it\r\nbest to let the matter pass on as such matters do, and be forgotten.  But\r\nhe is very much in earnest.  However foolish it is,--or perhaps I had\r\nbetter say unusual,--that a lad should be in love before he is twenty, it\r\nis, I suppose, possible.  At any rate it seems to be the case with him,\r\nand he has convinced his mother that it would be cruel to ignore the fact.\r\n\r\n"I may at once say that, as far as you and your girl are concerned, I\r\nshould be quite satisfied that he should choose for himself such a\r\nmarriage.  I value rank, at any rate, as much as it is worth; but that he\r\nwill have of his own, and does not need to strengthen it by intermarriage\r\nwith another house of peculiarly old lineage.  As far as that is\r\nconcerned, I should be contented.  As for money, I should not wish him to\r\nthink of it in marrying.  If it comes, _tant mieux_.  If not, he will have\r\nenough of his own.  I write to you, therefore, exactly as I should do if\r\nyou had happened to be a brother peer instead of a clergyman.\r\n\r\n"But I think that long engagements are very dangerous; and you probably\r\nwill agree with me that they are likely to be more prejudicial to the girl\r\nthan to the man.  It may be that, as difficulties arise in the course of\r\nyears, he can forget the affair, and that she cannot.  He has many things\r\nof which to think; whereas she, perhaps, has only that one.  She may have\r\nmade that thing so vital to her that it cannot be got under and conquered;\r\nwhereas, without any fault or heartlessness on his part, occupation has\r\nconquered it for him.  In this case I fear that the engagement, if made,\r\ncould not but be long.  I should be sorry that he should not take his\r\ndegree.  And I do not think it wise to send a lad up to the University\r\nhampered with the serious feeling that he has already betrothed himself.\r\n\r\n"I tell you all just as it is, and I leave it to your wisdom to suggest\r\nwhat had better be done.  He wished me to promise that I would undertake\r\nto induce you to tell Miss Wortle of his conversation with me.  He said\r\nthat he had a right to demand so much as that, and that, though he would\r\nnot for the present go to Bowick, he should write to you.  The young\r\ngentleman seems to have a will of his own,--which I cannot say that I\r\nregret.  What you will do as to the young lady,--whether you will or will\r\nnot tell her what I have written,--I must leave to yourself.  If you do, I\r\nam to send word to her from Lady Bracy to say that she shall be delighted\r\nto see her here.  She had better, however, come when that inflammatory\r\nyoung gentleman shall be at Oxford.  Yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\n"BRACY."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter certainly did a great deal to invigorate the Doctor, and to\r\nconsole him in his troubles.  Even though the debated marriage might prove\r\nto be impossible, as it had been declared by the voices of all the Wortles\r\none after another, still there was something in the tone in which it was\r\ndiscussed by the young man\'s father which was in itself a relief.  There\r\nwas, at any rate, no contempt in the letter.  "I may at once say that, as\r\nfar as you and your girl are concerned, I shall be very well pleased."\r\nThat, at any rate, was satisfactory.  And the more he looked at it the\r\nless he thought that it need be altogether impossible.  If Lord Bracy\r\nliked it, and Lady Bracy liked it,--and young Carstairs, as to whose\r\nliking there seemed to be no reason for any doubt,--he did not see why it\r\nshould be impossible.  As to Mary,--he could not conceive that she should\r\nmake objection if all the others were agreed.  How could she possibly fail\r\nto love the young man if encouraged to do so?  Suitors who are\r\ngood-looking, rich, of high rank, sweet-tempered, and at the same time\r\nthoroughly devoted, are not wont to be discarded.  All the difficulty lay\r\nin the lad\'s youth.  After all, how many noblemen have done well in the\r\nworld without taking a degree?  Degrees, too, have been taken by married\r\nmen.  And, again, young men have been persistent before now, even to the\r\nextent of waiting three years.  Long engagements are bad,--no doubt.\r\nEverybody has always said so.  But a long engagement may be better than\r\nnone at all.\r\n\r\nHe at last made up his mind that he would speak to Mary; but he determined\r\nthat he would consult his wife first.  Consulting Mrs. Wortle, on his\r\npart, generally amounted to no more than instructing her.  He found it\r\nsometimes necessary to talk her over, as he had done in that matter of\r\nvisiting Mrs. Peacocke; but when he set himself to work he rarely failed.\r\nShe had nowhere else to go for a certain foundation and support.\r\nTherefore he hardly doubted much when he began his operation about this\r\nsuggested engagement.\r\n\r\n"I have got that letter this morning from Lord Bracy," he said, handing\r\nher the document.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear!  Has he heard about Carstairs?"\r\n\r\n"You had better read it."\r\n\r\n"He has told it all," she exclaimed, when she had finished the first\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n"He has told it all, certainly.  But you had better read the letter\r\nthrough."\r\n\r\nThen she seated herself and read it, almost trembling, however, as she\r\nwent on with it.  "Oh dear;--that is very nice what he says about you and\r\nMary."\r\n\r\n"It is all very nice as far as that goes.  There is no reason why it\r\nshould not be nice."\r\n\r\n"It might have made him so angry!"\r\n\r\n"Then he would have been very unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"He acknowledges that Mary did not encourage him."\r\n\r\n"Of course she did not encourage him.  He would have been very unlike a\r\ngentleman had he thought so.  But in truth, my dear, it is a very good\r\nletter.  Of course there are difficulties."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--it is impossible!"\r\n\r\n"I do not see that at all.  It must rest very much with him, no\r\ndoubt;--with Carstairs; and I do not like to think that our girl\'s\r\nhappiness should depend on any young man\'s constancy.  But such dangers\r\nhave to be encountered.  You and I were engaged for three years before we\r\nwere married, and we did not find it so very bad."\r\n\r\n"It was very good.  Oh, I was so happy at the time."\r\n\r\n"Happier than you\'ve been since?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know.  It was very nice to know that you were my lover."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t Mary think it very nice to have a lover?"\r\n\r\n"But I knew that you would be true."\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t Carstairs be true?"\r\n\r\n"Remember he is so young.  You were in orders."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I was at all more likely to be true on that account.  A\r\nclergyman can jilt a girl just as well as another.  It depends on the\r\nnature of the man."\r\n\r\n"And you were so good."\r\n\r\n"I never came across a better youth than Carstairs.  You see what his\r\nfather says about his having a will of his own.  When a young man shows a\r\npurpose of that kind he generally sticks to it."\r\n\r\nThe upshot of it all was, that Mary was to be told, and that her father\r\nwas to tell her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa, he did come," she said.  "I told mamma all about me."\r\n\r\n"And she told me, of course.  You did what was quite right, and I should\r\nnot have thought it necessary to speak to you had not Lord Bracy written\r\nto me."\r\n\r\n"Lord Bracy has written!" said Mary.  It seemed to her, as it had done to\r\nher mother, that Lord Bracy must have written angrily; but though she\r\nthought so, she plucked up her spirit gallantly, telling herself that\r\nthough Lord Bracy might be angry with his own son, he could have no cause\r\nto be displeased with her.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have a letter, which you shall read.  The young man seems to have\r\nbeen very much in earnest."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Mary, with some little exultation at her heart.\r\n\r\n"It seems but the other day that he was a boy, and now he has become\r\nsuddenly a man."  To this Mary said nothing; but she also had come to the\r\nconclusion that, in this respect, Lord Carstairs had lately changed,--very\r\nmuch for the better.  "Do you like him, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Like him, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my darling; how am I to put it?  He is so much in earnest that he\r\nhas got his father to write to me.  He was coming over himself again\r\nbefore he went to Oxford; but he told his father what he was going to do,\r\nand the Earl stopped him.  There\'s the letter, and you may read it."\r\n\r\nMary read the letter, taking herself apart to a corner of the room, and\r\nseemed to her father to take a long time in reading it.  But there was\r\nvery much on which she was called upon to make up her mind during those\r\nfew minutes.  Up to the present time,--up to the moment in which her\r\nfather had now summoned her into his study, she had resolved that it was\r\n"impossible."  She had become so clear on the subject that she would not\r\nask herself the question whether she could love the young man.  Would it\r\nnot be wrong to love the young man?  Would it not be a longing for the top\r\nbrick of the chimney, which she ought to know was out of her reach?  So\r\nshe had decided it, and had therefore already taught herself to regard the\r\ndeclaration made to her as the ebullition of a young man\'s folly.  But not\r\nthe less had she known how great had been the thing suggested to her,--how\r\nexcellent was this top brick of the chimney; and as to the young man\r\nhimself, she could not but feel that, had matters been different, she\r\nmight have loved him.  Now there had come a sudden change; but she did not\r\nat all know how far she might go to meet the change, nor what the change\r\naltogether meant.  She had been made sure by her father\'s question that he\r\nhad taught himself to hope.  He would not have asked her whether she liked\r\nhim,--would not, at any rate, have asked that question in that voice,--had\r\nhe not been prepared to be good to her had she answered in the\r\naffirmative.  But then this matter did not depend upon her father\'s\r\nwishes,--or even on her father\'s judgment.  It was necessary that, before\r\nshe said another word, she should find out what Lord Bracy said about it.\r\nThere she had Lord Bracy\'s letter in her hand, but her mind was so\r\ndisturbed that she hardly knew how to read it aright at the spur of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"You understand what he says, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, papa."\r\n\r\n"It is a very kind letter."\r\n\r\n"Very kind indeed.  I should have thought that he would not have liked it\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"He makes no objection of that kind.  To tell the truth, Mary, I should\r\nhave thought it unreasonable had he done so.  A gentleman can do no better\r\nthan marry a lady.  And though it is much to be a nobleman, it is more to\r\nbe a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Some people think so much of it.  And then his having been here as a\r\npupil!  I was very sorry when he spoke to me."\r\n\r\n"All that is past and gone.  The danger is that such an engagement would\r\nbe long."\r\n\r\n"Very long."\r\n\r\n"You would be afraid of that, Mary?"  Mary felt that this was hard upon\r\nher, and unfair.  Were she to say that the danger of a long engagement did\r\nnot seem to her to be very terrible, she would at once be giving up\r\neverything.  She would have declared then that she did love the young man;\r\nor, at any rate, that she intended to do so.  She would have succumbed at\r\nthe first hint that such succumbing was possible to her.  And yet she had\r\nnot known that she was very much afraid of a long engagement.  She would,\r\nshe thought, have been much more afraid had a speedy marriage been\r\nproposed to her.  Upon the whole, she did not know whether it would not be\r\nnice to go on knowing that the young man loved her, and to rest secure on\r\nher faith in him.  She was sure of this,--that the reading of Lord Bracy\'s\r\nletter had in some way made her happy, though she was unwilling at once to\r\nexpress her happiness to her father.  She was quite sure that she could\r\nmake no immediate reply to that question, whether she was afraid of a long\r\nengagement.  "I must answer Lord Bracy\'s letter, you know," said the\r\nDoctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And what shall I say to him?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, papa."\r\n\r\n"And yet you must tell me what to say, my darling."\r\n\r\n"Must I, papa?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly!  Who else can tell me?  But I will not answer it to-day.  I\r\nwill put it off till Monday."  It was Saturday morning on which the letter\r\nwas being discussed,--a day of which a considerable portion was generally\r\nappropriated to the preparation of a sermon.  "In the mean time you had\r\nbetter talk to mamma; and on Monday we will settle what is to be said to\r\nLord Bracy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\nMR. PEACOCKE went on alone to San Francisco from the Ogden Junction, and\r\nthere obtained full information on the matter which had brought him upon\r\nthis long and disagreeable journey.  He had no difficulty in obtaining the\r\nevidence which he required.  He had not been twenty-four hours in the\r\nplace before he was, in truth, standing on the stone which had been placed\r\nover the body of Ferdinand Lefroy, as he had declared to Robert Lefroy\r\nthat he would stand before he would be satisfied.  On the stone was cut\r\nsimply the names, Ferdinand Lefroy of Kilbrack, Louisiana; and to these\r\nwere added the dates of the days on which the man had been born and on\r\nwhich he died.  Of this stone he had a photograph made, of which he took\r\ncopies with him; and he obtained also from the minister who had buried the\r\nbody and from the custodian who had charge of the cemetery certificates of\r\nthe interment.  Armed with these he could no longer doubt himself, or\r\nsuppose that others would doubt, that Ferdinand Lefroy was dead.\r\n\r\nHaving thus perfected his object, and feeling but little interest in a\r\ntown to which he had been brought by such painful circumstances, he turned\r\nround, and on the second day after his arrival, again started for Chicago.\r\nHad it been possible, he would fain have avoided any further meeting with\r\nRobert Lefroy.  Short as had been his stay at San Francisco he had learnt\r\nthat Robert, after his brother\'s death, had been concerned in buying\r\nmining shares and paying for them with forged notes.  It was not supposed\r\nthat he himself had been engaged in the forgery, but that he had come into\r\nthe city with men who had been employed for years on this operation, and\r\nhad bought shares and endeavoured to sell them on the following day.  He\r\nhad, however, managed to leave the place before the police had got hold of\r\nhim, and had escaped, so that no one had been able to say at what station\r\nhe had got upon the railway.  Nor did any one in San Francisco know where\r\nRobert Lefroy was now to be found.  His companions had been taken, tried,\r\nand convicted, and were now in the State prison,--where also would Robert\r\nLefroy soon be if any of the officers of the State could get hold of him.\r\nLuckily Mr. Peacocke had said little or nothing of the man in making his\r\nown inquiries.  Much as he had hated and dreaded the man; much as he had\r\nsuffered from his companionship,--good reason as he had to dislike the\r\nwhole family,--he felt himself bound by their late companionship not to\r\nbetray him.  The man had assisted Mr. Peacocke simply for money; but still\r\nhe had assisted him.  Mr. Peacocke therefore held his peace and said\r\nnothing.  But he would have been thankful to have been able to send the\r\nmoney that was now due to him without having again to see him.  That,\r\nhowever, was impossible.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Chicago he went to an hotel far removed from that which Lefroy\r\nhad designated.  Lefroy had explained to him something of the geography of\r\nthe town, and had explained that for himself he preferred a "modest, quiet\r\nhotel."  The modest, quiet hotel was called Mrs. Jones\'s boarding-house,\r\nand was in one of the suburbs far from the main street.  "You needn\'t say\r\nas you\'re coming to me," Lefroy had said to him; "nor need you let on as\r\nyou know anything of Mrs. Jones at all.  People are so curious; and it may\r\nbe that a gentleman sometimes likes to lie _perdu_."  Mr. Peacocke,\r\nalthough he had but small sympathy for the taste of a gentleman who likes\r\nto lie _perdu_, nevertheless did as he was bid, and found his way to Mrs.\r\nJones\'s boarding-house without telling any one whither he was going.\r\n\r\nBefore he started he prepared himself with a thousand dollars in\r\nbank-notes, feeling that this wretched man had earned them in accordance\r\nwith their compact.  His only desire now was to hand over the money as\r\nquickly as possible, and to hurry away out of Chicago.  He felt as though\r\nhe himself were almost guilty of some crime in having to deal with this\r\nman, in having to give him money secretly, and in carrying out to the end\r\nan arrangement of which no one else was to know the details.  How would it\r\nbe with him if the police of Chicago should come upon him as a friend, and\r\nprobably an accomplice, of one who was "wanted" on account of forgery at\r\nSan Francisco?  But he had no help for himself, and at Mrs. Jones\'s he\r\nfound his wife\'s brother-in-law seated in the bar of the\r\npublic-house,--that everlasting resort for American loungers,--with a\r\ncigar as usual stuck in his mouth, loafing away his time as only American\r\nfrequenters of such establishments know how to do.  In England such a man\r\nwould probably be found in such a place with a glass of some alcoholic\r\nmixture beside him, but such is never the case with an American.  If he\r\nwants a drink he goes to the bar and takes it standing,--will perhaps take\r\ntwo or three, one after another; but when he has settled himself down to\r\nloafe, he satisfies himself with chewing a cigar, and covering a circle\r\naround him with the results.  With this amusement he will remain contented\r\nhour after hour;--nay, throughout the entire day if no harder work be\r\ndemanded of him.  So was Robert Lefroy found now.  When Peacocke entered\r\nthe hall or room the man did not rise from his chair, but accosted him as\r\nthough they had parted only an hour since.  "So, old fellow, you\'ve got\r\nback all alive."\r\n\r\n"I have reached this place at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Well; that\'s getting back, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I have come back from San Francisco."\r\n\r\n"H\'sh!" exclaimed Lefroy, looking round the room, in which, however, there\r\nwas no one but themselves.  "You needn\'t tell everybody where you\'ve\r\nbeen."\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to conceal."\r\n\r\n"That is more than anybody knows of himself.  It\'s a good maxim to keep\r\nyour own affairs quiet till they\'re wanted.  In this country everybody is\r\nspry enough to learn all about everything.  I never see any good in\r\nletting them know without a reason.  Well;--what did you do when you got\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"It was all as you told me."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I say so?  What was the good of bringing me all this way, when, if\r\nyou\'d only believed me, you might have saved me the trouble.  Ain\'t I to\r\nbe paid for that?"\r\n\r\n"You are to be paid.  I have come here to pay you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you owe for the knowledge.  But for coming?  Ain\'t I to be\r\npaid extra for the journey?"\r\n\r\n"You are to have a thousand dollars."\r\n\r\n"H\'sh!--you speak of money as though every one has a business to know that\r\nyou have got your pockets full.  What\'s a thousand dollars, seeing all\r\nthat I have done for you!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all that you\'re going to get.  It\'s all, indeed, that I have got to\r\ngive you."\r\n\r\n"Gammon."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all, at any rate, that you\'re going to get.  Will you have it now?"\r\n\r\n"You found the tomb, did you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I found the tomb.  Here is a photograph of it.  You can keep a copy\r\nif you like it."\r\n\r\n"What do I want of a copy," said the man, taking the photograph in his\r\nhand.  "He was always more trouble than he was worth,--was Ferdy.  It\'s a\r\npity she didn\'t marry me.  I\'d \'ve made a woman of her."  Peacocke\r\nshuddered as he heard this, but he said nothing.  "You may as well give us\r\nthe picter;--it\'ll do to hang up somewhere if ever I have a room of my\r\nown.  How plain it is.  Ferdinand Lefroy,--of Kilbrack!  Kilbrack indeed!\r\nIt\'s little either of us was the better for Kilbrack.  Some of them\r\npsalm-singing rogues from New England has it now;--or perhaps a right-down\r\nnigger.  I shouldn\'t wonder.  One of our own lot, maybe!  Oh; that\'s the\r\nmoney, is it?--A thousand dollars; all that I\'m to have for coming to\r\nEngland and telling you, and bringing you back, and showing you where you\r\ncould get this pretty picter made."  Then he took the money, a thick roll\r\nof notes, and crammed them into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better count them."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t worth the while with such a trifle as that."\r\n\r\n"Let me count them then."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll never have that plunder in your fists again, my fine fellow."\r\n\r\n"I do not want it."\r\n\r\n"And now about my expenses out to England, on purpose to tell you all\r\nthis.  You can go and make her your wife now,--or can leave her, just as\r\nyou please.  You couldn\'t have done neither if I hadn\'t gone out to you."\r\n\r\n"You have got what was promised."\r\n\r\n"But my expenses,--going out?"\r\n\r\n"I have promised you nothing for your expenses going out,--and will pay\r\nyou nothing."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Not a dollar more."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not.  I do not suppose that you expect it for a moment,\r\nalthough you are so persistent in asking for it."\r\n\r\n"And you think you\'ve got the better of me, do you?  You think you\'ve\r\ncarried me along with you, just to do your bidding and take whatever you\r\nplease to give me?  That\'s your idea of me?"\r\n\r\n"There was a clear bargain between us.  I have not got the better of you\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"I rather think not, Peacocke.  I rather think not.  You\'ll have to get up\r\nearlier before you get the better of Robert Lefroy.  You don\'t expect to\r\nget this money back again,--do you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not,--any more than I should expect a pound of meat out of a\r\ndog\'s jaw."  Mr. Peacocke, as he said this, was waxing angry.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you do;--but you expected that I was to earn it by doing\r\nyour bidding;--didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"And you have."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have; but how?  You never heard of my cousin, did you;--Ferdinand\r\nLefroy of Kilbrack, Louisiana?"\r\n\r\n"Heard of whom?"\r\n\r\n"My cousin; Ferdinand Lefroy.  He was very well known in his own State,\r\nand in California too, till he died.  He was a good fellow, but given to\r\ndrink.  We used to tell him that if he would marry it would be better for\r\nhim;--but he never would;--he never did."  Robert Lefroy as he said this\r\nput his left hand into his trousers-pocket over the notes which he had\r\nplaced there, and drew a small revolver out of his pocket with the other\r\nhand.  "I am better prepared now," he said, "than when you had your\r\nsix-shooter under your pillow at Leavenworth."\r\n\r\n"I do not believe a word of it.  It\'s a lie," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  You\'re a chap that\'s fond of travelling, and have got plenty\r\nof money.  You\'d better go down to Louisiana and make your way straight\r\nfrom New Orleans to Kilbrack.  It ain\'t above forty miles to the\r\nsouth-west, and there\'s a rail goes within fifteen miles of it.  You\'ll\r\nlearn there all about Ferdinand Lefroy as was our cousin,--him as never\r\ngot married up to the day he died of drink and was buried at San\r\nFrancisco.  They\'ll be very glad, I shouldn\'t wonder, to see that pretty\r\nlittle picter of yours, because they was always uncommon fond of cousin\r\nFerdy at Kilbrack.  And I\'ll tell you what; you\'ll be sure to come across\r\nmy brother Ferdy in them parts, and can tell him how you\'ve seen me.  You\r\ncan give him all the latest news, too, about his own wife.  He\'ll be glad\r\nto hear about her, poor woman."  Mr. Peacocke listened to this without\r\nsaying a word since that last exclamation of his.  It might be true.  Why\r\nshould it not be true?  If in truth there had been these two cousins of\r\nthe same name, what could be more likely than that his money should be\r\nlured out of him by such a fraud as this?  But yet,--yet, as he came to\r\nthink of it all, it could not be true.  The chance of carrying such a\r\nscheme to a successful issue would have been too small to induce the man\r\nto act upon it from the day of his first appearance at Bowick.  Nor was it\r\nprobable that there should have been another Ferdinand Lefroy unknown to\r\nhis wife; and the existence of such a one, if known to his wife, would\r\ncertainly have been made known to him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a lie," said he, "from beginning to end."\r\n\r\n"Very well; very well.  I\'ll take care to make the truth known by letter\r\nto Dr. Wortle and the Bishop and all them pious swells over there.  To\r\nthink that such a chap as you, a minister of the gospel, living with\r\nanother man\'s wife and looking as though butter wouldn\'t melt in your\r\nmouth!  I tell you what; I\'ve got a little money in my pocket now, and I\r\ndon\'t mind going over to England again and explaining the whole truth to\r\nthe Bishop myself.  I could make him understand how that photograph ain\'t\r\nworth nothing, and how I explained to you myself as the lady\'s righteous\r\nhusband is all alive, keeping house on his own property down in Louisiana.\r\nDo you think we Lefroys hadn\'t any place beside Kilbrack among us?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly you are a liar," said Peacocke.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  Prove it."\r\n\r\n"Did you not tell me that your brother was buried at San Francisco?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for that, that don\'t matter.  It don\'t count for much whether I\r\ntold a crammer or not.  That picter counts for nothing.  It ain\'t my word\r\nyou were going on as evidence.  You is able to prove that Ferdy Lefroy was\r\nburied at \'Frisco.  True enough.  I buried him.  I can prove that.  And I\r\nwould never have treated you this way, and not have said a word as to how\r\nthe dead man was only a cousin, if you\'d treated me civil over there in\r\nEngland.  But you didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I am going to treat you worse now," said Peacocke, looking him in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do now?  It\'s I that have the revolver this time."\r\nAs he said this he turned the weapon round in his hand.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to shoot you,--nor yet to frighten you, as I did in the\r\nbed-room at Leavenworth.  Not but what I have a pistol too."  And he slowly\r\ndrew his out of his pocket.  At this moment two men sauntered in and took\r\ntheir places in the further corner of the room.  "I don\'t think there is\r\nto be any shooting between us."\r\n\r\n"There may," said Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"The police would have you."\r\n\r\n"So they would--for a time.  What does that matter to me?  Isn\'t a fellow\r\nto protect himself when a fellow like you comes to him armed?"\r\n\r\n"But they would soon know that you are the swindler who escaped from San\r\nFrancisco eighteen months ago.  Do you think it wouldn\'t be found out that\r\nit was you who paid for the shares in forged notes?"\r\n\r\n"I never did.  That\'s one of your lies."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  Now you know what I know; and you had better tell me over\r\nagain who it is that lies buried under the stone that\'s been photographed\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"What are you men doing with them pistols?" said one of the strangers,\r\nwalking across the room, and standing over the backs of their chairs.\r\n\r\n"We are alooking at \'em," said Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"If you\'re agoing to do anything of that kind you\'d better go and do it\r\nelsewhere," said the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Lefroy.  "That\'s what I was thinking myself."\r\n\r\n"But we are not going to do anything," said Mr. Peacocke.  "I have not the\r\nslightest idea of shooting the gentleman; and he has just as little of\r\nshooting me."\r\n\r\n"Then what do you sit with \'em out in your hands in that fashion for?"\r\nsaid the stranger.  "It\'s a decent widow woman as keeps this house, and I\r\nwon\'t see her set upon.  Put \'em up."  Whereupon Lefroy did return his\r\npistol to his pocket,--upon which Mr. Peacocke did the same.  Then the\r\nstranger slowly walked back to his seat at the other side of the room.\r\n\r\n"So they told you that lie; did they,--at \'Frisco?" asked Lefroy.\r\n\r\n"That was what I heard over there when I was inquiring about your\r\nbrother\'s death."\r\n\r\n"You\'d believe anything if you\'d believe that."\r\n\r\n"I\'d believe anything if I\'d believe in your cousin."  Upon this Lefroy\r\nlaughed, but made no further allusion to the romance which he had craftily\r\ninvented on the spur of the moment.  After that the two men sat without a\r\nword between them for a quarter of an hour, when the Englishman got up to\r\ntake his leave.  "Our business is over now," he said, "and I will bid you\r\ngood-bye."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what I\'m athinking," said Lefroy.  Mr. Peacocke stood with\r\nhis hand ready for a final adieu, but he said nothing.  "I\'ve half a mind\r\nto go back with you to England.  There ain\'t nothing to keep me here."\r\n\r\n"What could you do there?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d be evidence for you, as to Ferdy\'s death, you know."\r\n\r\n"I have evidence.  I do not want you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go, nevertheless."\r\n\r\n"And spend all your money on the journey."\r\n\r\n"You\'d help;--wouldn\'t you now?"\r\n\r\n"Not a dollar," said Peacocke, turning away and leaving the room.  As he\r\ndid so he heard the wretch laughing loud at the excellence of his own\r\njoke.\r\n\r\nBefore he made his journey back again to England he only once more saw\r\nRobert Lefroy.  As he was seating himself in the railway car that was to\r\ntake him to Buffalo the man came up to him with an affected look of\r\nsolicitude.  "Peacocke," he said, "there was only nine hundred dollars in\r\nthat roll."\r\n\r\n"There were a thousand.  I counted them half-an-hour before I handed them\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"There was only nine hundred when I got \'em."\r\n\r\n"There were all that you will get.  What kind of notes were they you had\r\nwhen you paid for the shares at \'Frisco?"  This question he asked out loud,\r\nbefore all the passengers.  Then Robert Lefroy left the car, and Mr.\r\nPeacocke never saw him or heard from him again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR\'S ANSWER.\r\n\r\nWHEN the Monday came there was much to be done and to be thought of at\r\nBowick.  Mrs. Peacocke on that day received a letter from San Francisco,\r\ngiving her all the details of the evidence that her husband had obtained,\r\nand enclosing a copy of the photograph.  There was now no reason why she\r\nshould not become the true and honest wife of the man whom she had all\r\nalong regarded as her husband in the sight of God.  The writer declared\r\nthat he would so quickly follow his letter that he might be expected home\r\nwithin a week, or, at the longest, ten days, from the date at which she\r\nwould receive it.  Immediately on his arrival at Liverpool, he would, of\r\ncourse, give her notice by telegraph.\r\n\r\nWhen this letter reached her, she at once sent a message across to Mrs.\r\nWortle.  Would Mrs. Wortle kindly come and see her?  Mrs. Wortle was, of\r\ncourse, bound to do as she was asked, and started at once.  But she was,\r\nin truth, but little able to give counsel on any subject outside the one\r\nwhich was at the moment nearest to her heart.  At one o\'clock, when the\r\nboys went to their dinner, Mary was to instruct her father as to the\r\npurport of the letter which was to be sent to Lord Bracy,--and Mary had\r\nnot as yet come to any decision.  She could not go to her father for\r\naid;--she could not, at any rate, go to him until the appointed hour\r\nshould come; and she was, therefore, entirely thrown upon her mother.  Had\r\nshe been old enough to understand the effect and the power of character,\r\nshe would have known that, at the last moment, her father would certainly\r\ndecide for her,--and had her experience of the world been greater, she\r\nmight have been quite sure that her father would decide in her favour.\r\nBut as it was, she was quivering and shaking in the dark, leaning on her\r\nmother\'s very inefficient aid, nearly overcome with the feeling that by\r\none o\'clock she must be ready to say something quite decided.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of this her mother was taken away from her, just at ten\r\no\'clock.  There was not, in truth, much that the two ladies could say to\r\neach other.  Mrs. Peacocke felt it to be necessary to let the Doctor know\r\nthat Mr. Peacocke would be back almost at once, and took this means of\r\ndoing so.  "In a week!" said Mrs. Wortle, as though painfully surprised by\r\nthe suddenness of the coming arrival.\r\n\r\n"In a week or ten days.  He was to follow his letter as quickly as\r\npossible from San Francisco."\r\n\r\n"And he has found it all out?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he has learned everything, I think.  Look at this!"  And Mrs.\r\nPeacocke handed to her friend the photograph of the tombstone.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Mrs. Wortle.  "Ferdinand Lefroy!  And this was his grave?"\r\n\r\n"That is his grave," said Mrs. Peacocke, turning her face away.\r\n\r\n"It is very sad; very sad indeed;--but you had to learn it, you know."\r\n\r\n"It will not be sad for him, I hope," said Mrs. Peacocke.  "In all this, I\r\nendeavour to think of him rather than of myself.  When I am forced to\r\nthink of myself, it seems to me that my life has been so blighted and\r\ndestroyed that it must be indifferent what happens to me now.  What has\r\nhappened to me has been so bad that I can hardly be injured further.  But\r\nif there can be a good time coming for him,--something at least of relief,\r\nsomething perhaps of comfort,--then I shall be satisfied."\r\n\r\n"Why should there not be comfort for you both?"\r\n\r\n"I am almost as dead to hope as I am to shame.  Some year or two ago I\r\nshould have thought it impossible to bear the eyes of people looking at\r\nme, as though my life had been sinful and impure.  I seem now to care\r\nnothing for all that.  I can look them back again with bold eyes and a\r\nbrazen face, and tell them that their hardness is at any rate as bad as my\r\nimpurity."\r\n\r\n"We have not looked at you like that," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"No; and therefore I send to you in my trouble, and tell you all this.\r\nThe strangest thing of all to me is that I should have come across one man\r\nso generous as your husband, and one woman so soft-hearted as yourself."\r\nThere was nothing further to be said then.  Mrs. Wortle was instructed to\r\ntell her husband that Mr. Peacocke was to be expected in a week or ten\r\ndays, and then hurried back to give what assistance she could in the much\r\nmore important difficulties of her own daughter.\r\n\r\nOf course they were much more important to her.  Was her girl to become\r\nthe wife of a young lord,--to be a future countess?  Was she destined to\r\nbe the mother-in-law of an earl?  Of course this was much more important\r\nto her.  And then through it all,--being as she was a dear, good,\r\nChristian, motherly woman,--she was well aware that there was something,\r\nin truth, much more important even than that.  Though she thought much of\r\nthe earl-ship, and the countess-ship, and the great revenue, and the big\r\nhouse at Carstairs, and the fine park with its magnificent avenues, and\r\nthe carriage in which her daughter would be rolled about to London\r\nparties, and the diamonds which she would wear when she should be\r\npresented to the Queen as the bride of the young Lord Carstairs, yet she\r\nknew very well that she ought not in such an emergency as the present to\r\nthink of these things as being of primary importance.  What would tend\r\nmost to her girl\'s happiness,--and welfare in this world and the next?  It\r\nwas of that she ought to think,--of that only.  If some answer were now\r\nreturned to Lord Bracy, giving his lordship to understand that they, the\r\nWortles, were anxious to encourage the idea, then in fact her girl would\r\nbe tied to an engagement whether the young lord should hold himself to be\r\nso tied or no!  And how would it be with her girl if the engagement should\r\nbe allowed to run on in a doubtful way for years, and then be dropped by\r\nreason of the young man\'s indifference?  How would it be with her if,\r\nafter perhaps three or four years, a letter should come saying that the\r\nyoung lord had changed his mind, and had engaged himself to some nobler\r\nbride?  Was it not her duty, as a mother, to save her child from the too\r\nprobable occurrence of some crushing grief such as this?  All of it was\r\nclear to her mind;--but then it was clear also that, if this opportunity\r\nof greatness were thrown away, no such chance in all probability would\r\never come again.  Thus she was so tossed to and fro between a prospect of\r\nglorious prosperity for her child on one side, and the fear of terrible\r\nmisfortune for her child on the other, that she was altogether unable to\r\ngive any salutary advice.  She, at any rate, ought to have known that her\r\nadvice would at last be of no importance.  Her experience ought to have\r\ntold her that the Doctor would certainly settle the matter himself.  Had\r\nit been her own happiness that was in question, her own conduct, her own\r\ngreatness, she would not have dreamed of having an opinion of her own.\r\nShe would have consulted the Doctor, and simply have done as he directed.\r\nBut all this was for her child, and in a vague, vacillating way she felt\r\nthat for her child she ought to be ready with counsel of her own.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Mary, when her mother came back from Mrs. Peacocke, "what am\r\nI to say when he sends for me?"\r\n\r\n"If you think that you can love him, my dear----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, you shouldn\'t ask me!"\r\n\r\n"My dear!"\r\n\r\n"I do like him,--very much."\r\n\r\n"If so----"\r\n\r\n"But I never thought of it before;--and then, if he,--if he----"\r\n\r\n"If he what, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"If he were to change his mind?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes;--there it is.  It isn\'t as though you could be married in three\r\nmonths\' time."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!  I shouldn\'t like that at all."\r\n\r\n"Or even in six."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is very young."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"And when a young man is so very young, I suppose he doesn\'t quite know\r\nhis own mind."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma.  But----"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear."\r\n\r\n"His father says that he has got--such a strong will of his own," said\r\npoor Mary, who was anxious, unconsciously anxious, to put in a good word\r\non her own side of the question, without making her own desire too\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\n"He always had that.  When there was any game to be played, he always\r\nliked to have his own way.  But then men like that are just as likely to\r\nchange as others."\r\n\r\n"Are they, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"But I do think that he is a lad of very high principle."\r\n\r\n"Papa has always said that of him."\r\n\r\n"And of fine generous feeling.  He would not change like a weather-cock."\r\n\r\n"If you think he would change at all, I would\r\nrather,--rather,--rather----.  Oh, mamma, why did you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"My darling, my child, my angel!  What am I to tell you?  I do think of\r\nall the young men I ever knew he is the nicest, and the sweetest, and the\r\nmost thoroughly good and affectionate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, do you?" said Mary, rushing at her mother and kissing her and\r\nembracing her.\r\n\r\n"But if there were to be no regular engagement, and you were to let him\r\nhave your heart,--and then things were to go wrong!"\r\n\r\nMary left the embracings, gave up the kissings, and seated herself on the\r\nsofa alone.  In this way the morning was passed;--and when Mary was\r\nsummoned to her father\'s study, the mother and daughter had not arrived\r\nbetween them at any decision.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said the Doctor, smiling, "what am I to say to the Earl?"\r\n\r\n"Must you write to-day, papa?"\r\n\r\n"I think so.  His letter is one that should not be left longer unanswered.\r\nWere we to do so, he would only think that we didn\'t know what to say for\r\nourselves."\r\n\r\n"Would he, papa?"\r\n\r\n"He would fancy that we are half-ashamed to accept what has been offered\r\nto us, and yet anxious to take it."\r\n\r\n"I am not ashamed of anything."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; you have no reason."\r\n\r\n"Nor have you, papa."\r\n\r\n"Nor have I.  That is quite true.  I have never been wont to be ashamed of\r\nmyself;--nor do I think that you ever will have cause to be ashamed of\r\nyourself.  Therefore, why should we hesitate?  Shall I help you, my\r\ndarling, in coming to a decision on the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"If I can understand your heart on this matter, it has never as yet been\r\ngiven to this young man."\r\n\r\n"No, papa."  This Mary said not altogether with that complete power of\r\nasseveration which the negative is sometimes made to bear.\r\n\r\n"But there must be a beginning to such things.  A man throws himself into\r\nit headlong,--as my Lord Carstairs seems to have done.  At least all the\r\nbest young men do."  Mary at this point felt a great longing to get up and\r\nkiss her father; but she restrained herself.  "A young woman, on the other\r\nhand, if she is such as I think you are, waits till she is asked.  Then it\r\nhas to begin."  The Doctor, as he said this, smiled his sweetest smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And when it has begun, she does not like to blurt it out at once, even to\r\nher loving old father."\r\n\r\n"Papa!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, isn\'t it?  Haven\'t I hit it off?"  He paused, as though\r\nfor a reply, but she was not as yet able to make him any.  "Come here, my\r\ndear."  She came and stood by him, so that he could put his arm round her\r\nwaist.  "If it be as I suppose, you are better disposed to this young man\r\nthan you are likely to be to any other, just at present."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"To all others you are quite indifferent?"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--indeed, papa."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you are.  But not quite indifferent to this one?  Give me a\r\nkiss, my darling, and I will take that for your speech."  Then she kissed\r\nhim,--giving him her very best kiss.  "And now, my child, what shall I say\r\nto the Earl?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, papa."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I, quite.  I never do know what to say till I\'ve got the pen in my\r\nhand.  But you\'ll commission me to write as I may think best?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"And I may presume that I know your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, papa."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  Then you had better leave me, so that I can go to work with\r\nthe paper straight before me, and my pen fixed in my fingers.  I can never\r\nbegin to think till I find myself in that position."  Then she left him,\r\nand went back to her mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"He is going to write to Lord Bracy."\r\n\r\n"But what does he mean to say?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know at all, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Not know!"\r\n\r\n"I think he means to tell Lord Bracy that he has got no objection."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Wortle was sure that the Doctor meant to face all the dangers,\r\nand that therefore it would behove her to face them also.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, when he was left alone, sat a while thinking of the matter\r\nbefore he put himself into the position fitted for composition which he\r\nhad described to his daughter.  He acknowledged to himself that there was\r\na difficulty in making a fit reply to the letter which he had to answer.\r\nWhen his mind was set on sending an indignant epistle to the Bishop, the\r\nwords flew from him like lightning out of the thunder-clouds.  But now he\r\nhad to think much of it before he could make any light to come which\r\nshould not bear a different colour from that which he intended.  "Of\r\ncourse such a marriage would suit my child, and would suit me," he wished\r\nto say;--"not only, or not chiefly, because your son is a nobleman, and\r\nwill be an earl and a man of great property.  That goes a long way with\r\nus.  We are too true to deny it.  We hate humbug, and want you to know\r\nsimply the truth about us.  The title and the money go far,--but not half\r\nso far as the opinion which we entertain of the young man\'s own good\r\ngifts.  I would not give my girl to the greatest and richest nobleman\r\nunder the British Crown, if I did not think that he would love her and be\r\ngood to her, and treat her as a husband should treat his wife.  But\r\nbelieving this young man to have good gifts such as these, and a fine\r\ndisposition, I am willing, on my girl\'s behalf,--and she also is\r\nwilling,--to encounter the acknowledged danger of a long engagement in the\r\nhope of realising all the good things which would, if things went\r\nfortunately, thus come within her reach."  This was what he wanted to say\r\nto the Earl, but he found it very difficult to say it in language that\r\nshould be natural.\r\n\r\n\r\n"MY DEAR LORD BRACY,--When I learned, through Mary\'s mother, that\r\nCarstairs had been here in our absence and made a declaration of love to\r\nour girl, I was, I must confess, annoyed.  I felt, in the first place,\r\nthat he was too young to have taken in hand such a business as that; and,\r\nin the next, that you might not unnaturally have been angry that your son,\r\nwho had come here simply for tuition, should have fallen into a matter of\r\nlove.  I imagine that you will understand exactly what were my feelings.\r\nThere was, however, nothing to be said about it.  The evil, so far as it\r\nwas an evil, had been done, and Carstairs was going away to Oxford, where,\r\npossibly, he might forget the whole affair.  I did not, at any rate, think\r\nit necessary to make a complaint to you of his coming.\r\n\r\n"To all this your letter has given altogether a different aspect.  I think\r\nthat I am as little likely as another to spend my time or thoughts in\r\nlooking for external advantages, but I am as much alive as another to the\r\ngreat honour to myself and advantage to my child of the marriage which is\r\nsuggested to her.  I do not know how any more secure prospect of happiness\r\ncould be opened to her than that which such a marriage offers.  I have\r\nthought myself bound to give her your letter to read because her heart and\r\nher imagination have naturally been affected by what your son said to her.\r\nI think I may say of my girl that none sweeter, none more innocent, none\r\nless likely to be over-anxious for such a prospect could exist.  But her\r\nheart has been touched; and though she had not dreamt of him but as an\r\nacquaintance till he came here and told his own tale, and though she then\r\naltogether declined to entertain his proposal when it was made, now that\r\nshe has learnt so much more through you, she is no longer indifferent.\r\nThis, I think, you will find to be natural.\r\n\r\n"I and her mother also are of course alive to the dangers of a long\r\nengagement, and the more so because your son has still before him a\r\nconsiderable portion of his education.  Had he asked advice either of you\r\nor of me he would of course have been counselled not to think of marriage\r\nas yet.  But the very passion which has prompted him to take this action\r\nupon himself shows,--as you yourself say of him,--that he has a stronger\r\nwill than is usual to be found at his years.  As it is so, it is probable\r\nthat he may remain constant to this as to a fixed idea.\r\n\r\n"I think you will now understand my mind and Mary\'s and her mother\'s."\r\nLord Bracy as he read this declared to himself that though the Doctor\'s\r\nmind was very clear, Mrs. Wortle, as far as he knew, had no mind in the\r\nmatter at all.  "I would suggest that the affair should remain as it is,\r\nand that each of the young people should be made to understand that any\r\nfuture engagement must depend, not simply on the persistency of one of\r\nthem, but on the joint persistency of the two.\r\n\r\n"If, after this, Lady Bracy should be pleased to receive Mary at\r\nCarstairs, I need not say that Mary will be delighted to make the\r\nvisit.--Believe me, my dear Lord Bracy, yours most faithfully.\r\n\r\n"JEFFREY WORTLE."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earl, when he read this, though there was not a word in it to which he\r\ncould take exception, was not altogether pleased.  "Of course it will be\r\nan engagement," he said to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Of course it will," said the Countess.  "But then Carstairs is so very\r\nmuch in earnest.  He would have done it for himself if you hadn\'t done it\r\nfor him."\r\n\r\n"At any rate the Doctor is a gentleman," the Earl said, comforting\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMR. PEACOCKE\'S RETURN.\r\n\r\nTHE Earl\'s rejoinder to the Doctor was very short: "So let it be."  There\r\nwas not another word in the body of the letter; but there was appended to\r\nit a postscript almost equally short; "Lady Bracy will write to Mary and\r\nsettle with her some period for her visit."  And so it came to be\r\nunderstood by the Doctor, by Mrs. Wortle, and by Mary herself, that Mary\r\nwas engaged to Lord Carstairs.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, having so far arranged the matter, said little or nothing more\r\non the subject, but turned his mind at once to that other affair of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Peacocke.  It was evident to his wife, who probably alone\r\nunderstood the buoyancy of his spirit and its corresponding susceptibility\r\nto depression, that he at once went about Mr. Peacocke\'s affairs with\r\nrenewed courage.  Mr. Peacocke should resume his duties as soon as he was\r\nremarried, and let them see what Mrs. Stantiloup or the Bishop would dare\r\nto say then!  It was impossible, he thought, that parents would be such\r\nasses as to suppose that their boys\' morals could be affected to evil by\r\nconnection with a man so true, so gallant, and so manly as this.  He did\r\nnot at this time say anything further as to abandoning the school, but\r\nseemed to imagine that the vacancies would get themselves filled up as in\r\nthe course of nature.  He ate his dinner again as though he liked it, and\r\nabused the Liberals, and was anxious about the grapes and peaches, as was\r\nalways the case with him when things were going well.  All this, as Mrs.\r\nWortle understood, had come to him from the brilliancy of Mary\'s\r\nprospects.\r\n\r\nBut though he held his tongue on the subject, Mrs. Wortle did not.  She\r\nfound it absolutely impossible not to talk of it when she was alone with\r\nMary, or alone with the Doctor.  As he counselled her not to make Mary\r\nthink too much about it, she was obliged to hold her peace when both were\r\nwith her; but with either of them alone she was always full of it.  To the\r\nDoctor she communicated all her fears and all her doubts, showing only too\r\nplainly that she would be altogether broken-hearted if anything should\r\ninterfere with the grandeur and prosperity which seemed to be partly\r\nwithin reach, but not altogether within reach of her darling child.  If\r\nhe, Carstairs, should prove to be a recreant young lord!  If Aristotle and\r\nSocrates should put love out of his heart!  If those other wicked young\r\nlords at Christ-Church were to teach him that it was a foolish thing for a\r\nyoung lord to become engaged to his tutor\'s daughter before he had taken\r\nhis degree!  If some better born young lady were to come in his way and\r\ndrive Mary out of his heart!  No more lovely or better girl could be found\r\nto do so;--of that she was sure.  To the latter assertion the Doctor\r\nagreed, telling her that, as it was so, she ought to have a stronger trust\r\nin her daughter\'s charms,--telling her also, with somewhat sterner voice,\r\nthat she should not allow herself to be so disturbed by the glories of the\r\nBracy coronet.  In this there was, I think, some hypocrisy.  Had the\r\nDoctor been as simple as his wife in showing her own heart, it would\r\nprobably have been found that he was as much set upon the coronet as she.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Wortle would carry the Doctor\'s wisdom to her daughter.  "Papa\r\nsays, my dear, that you shouldn\'t think of it too much."\r\n\r\n"I do think of him, mamma.  I do love him now, and of course I think of\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do, my dear;--of course you do.  How should you not think\r\nof him when he is all in all to you?  But papa means that it can hardly be\r\ncalled an engagement yet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it should be called; but of course I love him.  He can\r\nchange it if he likes."\r\n\r\n"But you shouldn\'t think of it, knowing his rank and wealth."\r\n\r\n"I never did, mamma; but he is what he is, and I must think of him."\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Wortle did not know what special advice to give when this\r\ndeclaration was made.  To have held her tongue would have been the wisest,\r\nbut that was impossible to her.  Out of the full heart the mouth speaks,\r\nand her heart was very full of Lord Carstairs and of Carstairs House, and\r\nof the diamonds which her daughter would certainly be called upon to wear\r\nbefore the Queen,--if only that young man would do his duty.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary herself probably had the worst of it.  No provision was made\r\neither for her to see her lover or to write to him.  The only interview\r\nwhich had ever taken place between them as lovers was that on which she\r\nhad run by him into the house, leaving him, as the Earl had said, planted\r\non the terrace.  She had never been able to whisper one single soft word\r\ninto his ear, to give him even one touch of her fingers in token of her\r\naffection.  She did not in the least know when she might be allowed to see\r\nhim,--whether it had not been settled among the elders that they were not\r\nto see each other as real lovers till he should have taken his\r\ndegree,--which would be almost in a future world, so distant seemed the\r\ntime.  It had been already settled that she was to go to Carstairs in the\r\nmiddle of November and stay till the middle of December; but it was\r\naltogether settled that her lover was not to be at Carstairs during the\r\ntime.  He was to be at Oxford then, and would be thinking only of his\r\nGreek and Latin,--or perhaps amusing himself, in utter forgetfulness that\r\nhe had a heart belonging to him at Bowick Parsonage.  In this way Mary,\r\nthough no doubt she thought the most of it all, had less opportunity of\r\ntalking of it than either her father or her mother.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mr. Peacocke was coming home.  The Doctor, as soon as he\r\nheard that the day was fixed, or nearly fixed, being then, as has been\r\nexplained, in full good humour with all the world except Mrs. Stantiloup\r\nand the Bishop, bethought himself as to what steps might best be taken in\r\nthe very delicate matter in which he was called upon to give advice.  He\r\nhad declared at first that they should be married at his own parish\r\nchurch; but he felt that there would be difficulties in this.  "She must\r\ngo up to London and meet him there," he said to Mrs. Wortle.  "And he must\r\nnot show himself here till he brings her down as his actual wife."  Then\r\nthere was very much to be done in arranging all this.  And something to be\r\ndone also in making those who had been his friends, and perhaps more in\r\nmaking those who had been his enemies, understand exactly how the matter\r\nstood.  Had no injury been inflicted upon him, as though he had done evil\r\nto the world in general in befriending Mr. Peacocke, he would have been\r\nquite willing to pass the matter over in silence among his friends; but as\r\nit was he could not afford to hide his own light under a bushel.  He was\r\nbeing punished almost to the extent of ruin by the cruel injustice which\r\nhad been done him by the evil tongue of Mrs. Stantiloup, and, as he\r\nthought, by the folly of the Bishop.  He must now let those who had\r\nconcerned themselves know as accurately as he could what he had done in\r\nthe matter, and what had been the effect of his doing.  He wrote a letter,\r\ntherefore, which was not, however, to be posted till after the Peacocke\r\nmarriage had been celebrated, copies of which he prepared with his own\r\nhand in order that he might send them to the Bishop and to Lady Anne\r\nClifford, and to Mr. Talbot and,--not, indeed, to Mrs. Stantiloup, but to\r\nMrs. Stantiloup\'s husband.  There was a copy also made for Mr. Momson,\r\nthough in his heart he despised Mr. Momson thoroughly.  In this letter he\r\ndeclared the great respect which he had entertained, since he had first\r\nknown them, both for Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke, and the distress which he had\r\nfelt when Mr. Peacocke had found himself obliged to explain to him the\r\nfacts,--the facts which need not be repeated, because the reader is so\r\nwell acquainted with them.  "Mr. Peacocke," he went on to say, "has since\r\nbeen to America, and has found that the man whom he believed to be dead\r\nwhen he married his wife, has died since his calamitous reappearance.  Mr.\r\nPeacocke has seen the man\'s grave, with the stone on it bearing his name,\r\nand has brought back with him certificates and evidence as to his burial.\r\n\r\n"Under these circumstances, I have no hesitation in re-employing both him\r\nand his wife; and I think that you will agree that I could not do less.  I\r\nthink you will agree, also, that in the whole transaction I have done\r\nnothing of which the parent of any boy intrusted to me has a right to\r\ncomplain."\r\n\r\nHaving done this, he went up to London, and made arrangements for having\r\nthe marriage celebrated there as soon as possible after the arrival of Mr.\r\nPeacocke.  And on his return to Bowick, he went off to Mr. Puddicombe with\r\na copy of his letter in his pocket.  He had not addressed a copy to his\r\nfriend, nor had he intended that one should be sent to him.  Mr.\r\nPuddicombe had not interfered in regard to the boys, and had, on the\r\nwhole, shown himself to be a true friend.  There was no need for him to\r\nadvocate his cause to Mr. Puddicombe.  But it was right, he thought, that\r\nthat gentleman should know what he did; and it might be that he hoped that\r\nhe would at length obtain some praise from Mr. Puddicombe.  But Mr.\r\nPuddicombe did not like the letter.  "It does not tell the truth," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"Not the truth!"\r\n\r\n"Not the whole truth."\r\n\r\n"As how!  Where have I concealed anything?"\r\n\r\n"If I understand the question rightly, they who have thought proper to\r\ntake their children away from your school because of Mr. Peacocke, have\r\ndone so because that gentleman continued to live with that lady when they\r\nboth knew that they were not man and wife."\r\n\r\n"That wasn\'t my doing."\r\n\r\n"You condoned it.  I am not condemning you.  You condoned it, and now you\r\ndefend yourself in this letter.  But in your defence you do not really\r\ntouch the offence as to which you are, according to your own showing,\r\naccused.  In telling the whole story, you should say; \'They did live\r\ntogether though they were not married;--and, under all the circumstances,\r\nI did not think that they were on that account unfit to be left in charge\r\nof my boys."\'\r\n\r\n"But I sent him away immediately,--to America."\r\n\r\n"You allowed the lady to remain."\r\n\r\n"Then what would you have me say?" demanded the Doctor.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," said Mr. Puddicombe;--"not a word.  Live it down in silence.\r\nThere will be those, like myself, who, though they could not dare to say\r\nthat in morals you were strictly correct, will love you the better for\r\nwhat you did."  The Doctor turned his face towards the dry, hard-looking\r\nman and showed that there was a tear in each of his eyes.  "There are few\r\nof us not so infirm as sometimes to love best that which is not best.  But\r\nwhen a man is asked a downright question, he is bound to answer the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"You would say nothing in your own defence."\r\n\r\n"Not a word.  You know the French proverb: \'Who excuses himself is his own\r\naccuser.\' The truth generally makes its way.  As far as I can see, a\r\nslander never lives long."\r\n\r\n"Ten of my boys are gone!" said the Doctor, who had not hitherto spoken a\r\nword of this to any one out of his own family;--"ten out of twenty."\r\n\r\n"That will only be a temporary loss."\r\n\r\n"That is nothing,--nothing.  It is the idea that the school should be\r\nfailing."\r\n\r\n"They will come again.  I do not believe that that letter would bring a\r\nboy.  I am almost inclined to say, Dr. Wortle, that a man should never\r\ndefend himself."\r\n\r\n"He should never have to defend himself."\r\n\r\n"It is much the same thing.  But I\'ll tell you what I\'ll do, Dr.\r\nWortle,--if it will suit your plans.  I will go up with you and will\r\nassist at the marriage.  I do not for a moment think that you will require\r\nany countenance, or that if you did, that I could give it you."\r\n\r\n"No man that I know so efficiently."\r\n\r\n"But it may be that Mr. Peacocke will like to find that the clergymen from\r\nhis neighbourhood are standing with him."  And so it was settled, that when\r\nthe day should come on which the Doctor would take Mrs. Peacocke up with\r\nhim to London, Mr. Puddicombe was to accompany them.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor when he left Mr. Puddicombe\'s parsonage had by no means pledged\r\nhimself not to send the letters.  When a man has written a letter, and has\r\ntaken some trouble with it, and more specially when he has copied it\r\nseveral times himself so as to have made many letters of it,--when he has\r\nargued his point successfully to himself, and has triumphed in his own\r\nmind, as was likely to be the case with Dr. Wortle in all that he did, he\r\ndoes not like to make waste paper of his letters.  As he rode home he\r\ntried to persuade himself that he might yet use them.  He could not quite\r\nadmit his friend\'s point.  Mr. Peacocke, no doubt, had known his own\r\ncondition, and him a strict moralist might condemn.  But he,--he,--Dr.\r\nWortle,--had known nothing.  All that he had done was not to condemn the\r\nother man when he did know!\r\n\r\nNevertheless as he rode into his own yard, he made up his mind that he\r\nwould burn the letters.  He had shown them to no one else.  He had not\r\neven mentioned them to his wife.  He could burn them without condemning\r\nhimself in the opinion of any one.  And he burned them.  When Mr.\r\nPuddicombe found him at the station at Broughton as they were about to\r\nproceed to London with Mrs. Peacocke, he simply whispered the fate of the\r\nletters.  "After what you said I destroyed what I had written."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it was as well," said Mr. Puddicombe.\r\n\r\nWhen the telegram came to say that Mr. Peacocke was at Liverpool, Mrs.\r\nPeacocke was anxious immediately to rush up to London.  But she was\r\nrestrained by the Doctor,--or rather by Mrs. Wortle under the Doctor\'s\r\norders.  "No, my dear; no.  You must not go till all will be ready for you\r\nto meet him in the church.  The Doctor says so."\r\n\r\n"Am I not to see him till he comes up to the altar?"\r\n\r\nOn this there was another consultation between Mrs. Wortle and the Doctor,\r\nat which she explained how impossible it would be for the woman to go\r\nthrough the ceremony with due serenity and propriety of manner unless she\r\nshould be first allowed to throw herself into his arms, and to welcome him\r\nback to her.  "Yes," she said, "he can come and see you at the hotel on\r\nthe evening before, and again in the morning,--so that if there be a word\r\nto say you can say it.  Then when it is over he will bring you down here.\r\nThe Doctor and Mr. Puddicombe will come down by a later train.  Of course\r\nit is painful," said Mrs. Wortle, "but you must bear up."  To her it seemed\r\nto be so painful that she was quite sure that she could not have borne it.\r\nTo be married for the third time, and for the second time to the same\r\nhusband!  To Mrs. Peacocke, as she thought of it, the pain did not so much\r\nrest in that, as in the condition of life which these things had forced\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\n"I must go up to town to-morrow, and must be away for two days," said the\r\nDoctor out loud in the school, speaking immediately to one of the ushers,\r\nbut so that all the boys present might hear him.  "I trust that we shall\r\nhave Mr. Peacocke with us the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"We shall be very glad of that," said the usher.\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Peacocke will come and eat her dinner again like before?" asked\r\na little boy.\r\n\r\n"I hope so, Charley."\r\n\r\n"We shall like that, because she has to eat it all by herself now."\r\n\r\nAll the school, down even to Charley, the smallest boy in it, knew all\r\nabout it.  Mr. Peacocke had gone to America, and Mrs. Peacocke was going\r\nup to London to be married once more to her own husband,--and the Doctor\r\nand Mr. Puddicombe were both going to marry them.  The usher of course\r\nknew the details more clearly than that,--as did probably the bigger boys.\r\nThere had even been a rumour of the photograph which had been seen by one\r\nof the maid-servants,--who had, it is to be feared, given the information\r\nto the French teacher.  So much, however, the Doctor had felt it wise to\r\nexplain, not thinking it well that Mr. Peacocke should make his\r\nreappearance among them without notice.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the next day but one, Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke were\r\ndriven up to the school in one of the Broughton flys.  She went quickly up\r\ninto her own house, when Mr. Peacocke walked into the school.  The boys\r\nclustered round him, and the three assistants, and every word said to him\r\nwas kind and friendly;--but in the whole course of his troubles there had\r\nnever been a moment to him more difficult than this,--in which he found it\r\nso nearly impossible to say anything or to say nothing.  "Yes, I have been\r\nover very many miles since I saw you last."  This was an answer to young\r\nTalbot, who asked him whether he had not been a great traveller whilst he\r\nwas away.\r\n\r\n"In America," suggested the French usher, who had heard of the photograph,\r\nand knew very well where it had been taken.\r\n\r\n"Yes, in America."\r\n\r\n"All the way to San Francisco," suggested Charley.\r\n\r\n"All the way to San Francisco, Charley,--and back again."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know you\'re come back again," said Charley, "because I see you\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"There are only twenty boys this half," said one of the twenty.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall have more time to attend to you now."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said the lad, not seeming to find any special consolation\r\nin that view of the matter.\r\n\r\nPainful as this first re-introduction had been, there was not much more in\r\nit than that.  No questions were asked, and no explanations expected.  It\r\nmay be that Mrs. Stantiloup was affected with fresh moral horrors when she\r\nheard of the return, and that the Bishop said that the Doctor was foolish\r\nand headstrong as ever.  It may be that there was a good deal of talk\r\nabout it in the Close at Broughton.  But at the school there was very\r\nlittle more said about it than what has been stated above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMARY\'S SUCCESS.\r\n\r\nIN this last chapter of our short story I will venture to run rapidly over\r\na few months so as to explain how the affairs of Bowick arranged\r\nthemselves up to the end of the current year.  I cannot pretend that the\r\nreader shall know, as he ought to be made to know, the future fate and\r\nfortunes of our personages.  They must be left still struggling.  But then\r\nis not such always in truth the case, even when the happy marriage has\r\nbeen celebrated?--even when, in the course of two rapid years, two normal\r\nchildren make their appearance to gladden the hearts of their parents?\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Peacocke fell into their accustomed duties in the diminished\r\nschool, apparently without difficulty.  As the Doctor had not sent those\r\nill-judged letters he of course received no replies, and was neither\r\ntroubled by further criticism nor consoled by praise as to his conduct.\r\nIndeed, it almost seemed to him as though the thing, now that it was done,\r\nexcited less observation than it deserved.  He heard no more of the\r\nmetropolitan press, and was surprised to find that the \'Broughton Gazette\'\r\ninserted only a very short paragraph, in which it stated that "they had\r\nbeen given to understand that Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke had resumed their\r\nusual duties at the Bowick School, after the performance of an interesting\r\nceremony in London, at which Dr. Wortle and Mr. Puddicombe had assisted."\r\nThe press, as far as the Doctor was aware, said nothing more on the\r\nsubject.  And if remarks injurious to his conduct were made by the\r\nStantiloups and the Momsons, they did not reach his ears.  Very soon after\r\nthe return of the Peacockes there was a grand dinner-party at the palace,\r\nto which the Doctor and his wife were invited.  It was not a clerical\r\ndinner-party, and so the honour was the greater.  The aristocracy of the\r\nneighbourhood were there, including Lady Anne Clifford, who was devoted,\r\nwith almost repentant affection, to her old friend.  And Lady Margaret\r\nMomson was there, the only clergyman\'s wife besides his own, who declared\r\nto him with unblushing audacity that she had never regretted anything so\r\nmuch in her life as that Augustus should have been taken away from the\r\nschool.  It was evident that there had been an intention at the palace to\r\nmake what amends the palace could for the injuries it had done.\r\n\r\n"Did Lady Anne say anything about the boys?" asked Mrs. Wortle, as they\r\nwere going home.\r\n\r\n"She was going to, but I would not let her.  I managed to show her that I\r\ndid not wish it, and she was clever enough to stop."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if she sent them back," said Mrs. Wortle.\r\n\r\n"She won\'t do that.  Indeed, I doubt whether I should take them.  But if\r\nit should come to pass that she should wish to send them back, you may be\r\nsure that others will come.  In such a matter she is very good as a\r\nweathercock, showing how the wind blows."  In this way the dinner-party at\r\nthe palace was in a degree comforting and consolatory.\r\n\r\nBut an incident which of all was most comforting and most consolatory to\r\none of the inhabitants of the parsonage took place two or three days after\r\nthe dinner-party.  On going out of his own hall-door one Saturday\r\nafternoon, immediately after lunch, whom should the Doctor see driving\r\nhimself into the yard in a hired gig from Broughton--but young Lord\r\nCarstairs.  There had been no promise, or absolute compact made, but it\r\ncertainly had seemed to be understood by all of them that Carstairs was\r\nnot to show himself at Bowick till at some long distant period, when he\r\nshould have finished all the trouble of his education.  It was understood\r\neven that he was not to be at Carstairs during Mary\'s visit,--so\r\nimperative was it that the young people should not meet.  And now here he\r\nwas getting out of a gig in the Rectory yard!  "Halloa!  Carstairs, is\r\nthat you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dr. Wortle,--here I am."\r\n\r\n"We hardly expected to see you, my boy."\r\n\r\n"No,--I suppose not.  But when I heard that Mr. Peacocke had come back,\r\nand all about his marriage, you know, I could not but come over to see\r\nhim.  He and I have always been such great friends."\r\n\r\n"Oh,--to see Mr. Peacocke?"\r\n\r\n"I thought he\'d think it unkind if I didn\'t look him up.  He has made it\r\nall right; hasn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--he has made it all right, I think.  A finer fellow never lived.\r\nBut he\'ll tell you all about it.  He travelled with a pistol in his\r\npocket, and seemed to want it too.  I suppose you must come in and see the\r\nladies after we have been to Peacocke?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I can just see them," said the young lord, as though moved by\r\nequal anxiety as to the mother and as to the daughter.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave word that you are here, and then we\'ll go into the school."\r\nSo the Doctor found a servant, and sent what message he thought fit\r\ninto the house.\r\n\r\n"Lord Carstairs here?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, Miss!  He\'s with your papa, going across to the school.  He\r\ntold me to take word in to Missus that he supposes his lordship will stay\r\nto dinner."  The maid who carried the tidings, and who had received no\r\ncommission to convey them to Miss Mary, was, no doubt, too much interested\r\nin an affair of love, not to take them first to the one that would be most\r\nconcerned with them.\r\n\r\nThat very morning Mary had been bemoaning herself as to her hard\r\ncondition.  Of what use was it to her to have a lover, if she was never to\r\nsee him, never to hear from him,--only to be told about him,--that she was\r\nnot to think of him more than she could help?  She was already beginning\r\nto think that a long engagement carried on after this fashion would have\r\nmore of suffering in it than she had anticipated.  It seemed to her that\r\nwhile she was, and always would be, thinking of him, he never, never would\r\ncontinue to think of her.  If it could be only a word once a month it\r\nwould be something,--just one or two written words under an\r\nenvelope,--even that would have sufficed to keep her hope alive!  But\r\nnever to see him;--never to hear from him!  Her mother had told her that\r\nvery morning that there was to be no meeting,--probably for three years,\r\ntill he should have done with Oxford.  And here he was in the house,--and\r\nher papa had sent in word to say that he was to eat his dinner there!  It\r\nso astonished her that she felt that she would be afraid to meet him.\r\nBefore she had had a minute to think of it all, her mother was with her.\r\n"Carstairs, love, is here!"\r\n\r\n"Oh mamma, what has brought him?"\r\n\r\n"He has gone into the school with your papa to see Mr. Peacocke.  He\r\nalways was very fond of Mr. Peacocke."  For a moment something of a feeling\r\nof jealousy crossed her heart,--but only for a moment.  He would not\r\nsurely have come to Bowick if he had begun to be indifferent to her\r\nalready!  "Papa says that he will probably stay to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Then I am to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes;--of course you must see him."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you wish to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, mamma.  If he were to come and go, and we were not to meet at\r\nall, I should think it was all over then.  Only,--I don\'t know what to say\r\nto him."\r\n\r\n"You must take that as it comes, my dear."\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards they were walking, the two of them alone together,\r\nout in the Bowick woods.  When once the law,--which had been rather\r\nunderstood than spoken,--had been infringed and set at naught, there was\r\nno longer any use in endeavouring to maintain a semblance of its\r\nrestriction.  The two young people had met in the presence both of the\r\nfather and mother, and the lover had had her in his arms before either of\r\nthem could interfere.  There had been a little scream from Mary, but it\r\nmay probably be said of her that she was at the moment the happiest young\r\nlady in the diocese.\r\n\r\n"Does your father know you are here?" said the Doctor, as he led the young\r\nlord back from the school into the house.\r\n\r\n"He knows I\'m coming, for I wrote and told my mother.  I always tell\r\neverything; but it\'s sometimes best to make up your mind before you get an\r\nanswer."  Then the Doctor made up his mind that Lord Carstairs would have\r\nhis own way in anything that he wished to accomplish.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t the Earl be angry?" Mrs. Wortle asked.\r\n\r\n"No;--not angry.  He knows the world too well not to be quite sure that\r\nsomething of the kind would happen.  And he is too fond of his son not to\r\nthink well of anything that he does.  It wasn\'t to be supposed that they\r\nshould never meet.  After all that has passed I am bound to make him\r\nwelcome if he chooses to come here, and as Mary\'s lover to give him the\r\nbest welcome that I can.  He won\'t stay, I suppose, because he has got no\r\nclothes."\r\n\r\n"But he has;--John brought in a portmanteau and a dressing-bag out of the\r\ngig."  So that was settled.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Lord Carstairs had taken Mary out for a walk into the\r\nwood, and she, as she walked beside him, hardly knew whether she was going\r\non her head or her heels.  This, indeed, it was to have a lover.  In the\r\nmorning she was thinking that when three years were past he would hardly\r\ncare to see her ever again.  And now they were together among the falling\r\nleaves, and sitting about under the branches as though there was nothing\r\nin the world to separate them.  Up to that day there had never been a word\r\nbetween them but such as is common to mere acquaintances, and now he was\r\ncalling her every instant by her Christian name, and telling her all his\r\nsecrets.\r\n\r\n"We have such jolly woods at Carstairs," he said; "but we shan\'t be able\r\nto sit down when we\'re there, because it will be winter.  We shall be\r\nhunting, and you must come out and see us."\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t be there when I am," she said, timidly.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t I?  That\'s all you know about it.  I can manage better than that."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be at Oxford."\r\n\r\n"You must stay over Christmas, Mary; that\'s what you must do.  You musn\'t\r\nthink of going till January."\r\n\r\n"But Lady Bracy won\'t want me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she will.  We must make her want you.  At any rate they\'ll\r\nunderstand this; if you don\'t stay for me, I shall come home even if it\'s\r\nin the middle of term.  I\'ll arrange that.  You don\'t suppose I\'m not\r\ngoing to be there when you make your first visit to the old place."\r\n\r\nAll this was being in Paradise.  She felt when she walked home with him,\r\nand when she was alone afterwards in her own room, that, in truth, she had\r\nonly liked him before.  Now she loved him.  Now she was beginning to know\r\nhim, and to feel that she would really,--really die of a broken heart if\r\nanything were to rob her of him.  But she could let him go now, without a\r\nfeeling of discomfort, if she thought that she was to see him again when\r\nshe was at Carstairs.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the last walk in the woods, even on this occasion.  He\r\nremained two days at Bowick, so necessary was it for him to renew his\r\nintimacy with Mr. Peacocke.  He explained that he had got two days\' leave\r\nfrom the tutor of his College, and that two days, in College parlance,\r\nalways meant three.  He would be back on the third day, in time for\r\n"gates"; and that was all which the strictest college discipline would\r\nrequire of him.  It need hardly be said of him that the most of his time\r\nhe spent with Mary; but he did manage to devote an hour or two to his old\r\nfriend, the school-assistant.\r\n\r\nMr. Peacocke told his whole story, and Carstairs, whose morals were\r\nperhaps not quite so strict as those of Mr. Puddicombe, gave him all his\r\nsympathy.  "To think that a man can be such a brute as that," he said,\r\nwhen he heard that Ferdinand Lefroy had shown himself to his wife at St.\r\nLouis,--"only on a spree."\r\n\r\n"There is no knowing to what depth utter ruin may reduce a man who has\r\nbeen born to better things.  He falls into idleness, and then comforts\r\nhimself with drink.  So it seems to have been with him."\r\n\r\n"And that other fellow;--do you think he meant to shoot you?"\r\n\r\n"Never.  But he meant to frighten me.  And when he brought out his knife\r\nin the bedroom at Leavenworth he did.  My pistol was not loaded."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because little as I wish to be murdered, I should prefer that to\r\nmurdering any one else.  But he didn\'t mean it.  His only object was to\r\nget as much out of me as he could.  As for me, I couldn\'t give him more\r\nbecause I hadn\'t got it."  After that they made a league of friendship, and\r\nMr. Peacocke promised that he would, on some distant occasion, take his\r\nwife with him on a visit to Carstairs.\r\n\r\nIt was about a month after this that Mary was packed up and sent on her\r\njourney to Carstairs.  When that took place, the Doctor was in supreme\r\ngood-humour.  There had come a letter from the father of the two Mowbrays,\r\nsaying that he had again changed his mind.  He had, he said, heard a story\r\ntold two ways.  He trusted Dr. Wortle would understand him and forgive\r\nhim, when he declared that he had believed both the stories.  If after\r\nthis the Doctor chose to refuse to take his boys back again, he would\r\nhave, he acknowledged, no ground for offence.  But if the Doctor would\r\ntake them, he would intrust them to the Doctor\'s care with the greatest\r\nsatisfaction in the world,--as he had done before.\r\n\r\nFor a while the Doctor had hesitated; but here, perhaps for the first time\r\nin her life, his wife was allowed to persuade him.  "They are such leading\r\npeople," she said.\r\n\r\n"Who cares for that?  I have never gone in for that."  This, however, was\r\nhardly true.  "When I have been sure that a man is a gentleman, I have\r\ntaken his son without inquiring much farther.  It was mean of him to\r\nwithdraw after I had acceded to his request."\r\n\r\n"But he withdraws his withdrawal in such a flattering way!"  Then the\r\nDoctor assented, and the two boys were allowed to come.  Lady Anne\r\nClifford hearing this, learning that the Doctor was so far willing to\r\nrelent, became very piteous and implored forgiveness.  The noble relatives\r\nwere all willing now.  It had not been her fault.  As far as she was\r\nconcerned herself she had always been anxious that her boys should remain\r\nat Bowick.  And so the two Cliffords came back to their old beds in the\r\nold room.\r\n\r\nMary, when she first arrived at Carstairs, hardly knew how to carry\r\nherself.  Lady Bracy was very cordial and the Earl friendly, but for the\r\nfirst two days nothing was said about Carstairs.  There was no open\r\nacknowledgment of her position.  But then she had expected none; and\r\nthough her tongue was burning to talk, of course she did not say a word.\r\nBut before a week was over Lady Bracy had begun, and by the end of the\r\nfortnight Lord Bracy had given her a beautiful brooch.  "That means," said\r\nLady Bracy in the confidence of her own little sitting-room up-stairs,\r\n"that he looks upon you as his daughter."\r\n\r\n"Does it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, yes."  Then they fell to kissing each other, and did nothing\r\nbut talk about Carstairs and all his perfections, and his unalterable\r\nlove, and how these three years could be made to wear themselves away,\r\ntill the conversation,--simmering over as such conversation is wont to\r\ndo,--gave the whole household to understand that Miss Wortle was staying\r\nthere as Lord Carstairs\'s future bride.\r\n\r\nOf course she stayed over the Christmas, or went back to Bowick for a\r\nweek, and then returned to Carstairs, so that she might tell her mother\r\neverything, and hear of the six new boys who were to come after the\r\nholidays.  "Papa couldn\'t take both the Buncombes," said Mrs. Wortle in\r\nher triumph, "and one must remain till midsummer.  Sir George did say that\r\nit must be two or none, but he had to give way.  I wanted papa to have\r\nanother bed in the east room, but he wouldn\'t hear of it."\r\n\r\nMary went back for the Christmas and Carstairs came; and the house was\r\nfull, and everybody knew of the engagement.  She walked with him, and rode\r\nwith him, and danced with him, and talked secrets with him,--as though\r\nthere were no Oxford, no degree before him.  No doubt it was very\r\nimprudent, but the Earl and the Countess knew all about it.  What might\r\nbe, or would be, or was the end of such folly, it is not my purpose here\r\nto tell.  I fear that there was trouble before them.  It may, however, be\r\npossible that the degree should be given up on the score of love, and Lord\r\nCarstairs should marry his bride,--at any rate when he came of age.\r\n\r\nAs to the school, it certainly suffered nothing by the Doctor\'s\r\ngenerosity, and when last I heard of Mr. Peacocke, the Bishop had offered\r\nto grant him a licence for the curacy.  Whether he accepted it I have not\r\nyet heard, but I am inclined to think that in this matter he will adhere\r\nto his old determination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTextual emendations and noteworthy items\r\n\r\n1  Alterations\r\n\r\n1 1   Word changes\r\n\r\n1 1 1    Additions\r\n\r\n1 1 1 1  Added "l" to "crue"\r\nVol. I--Page 146, line 8\r\ndid sit down.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
