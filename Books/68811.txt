J. began\r\nmanufacturing and advertising a preparation for the immediate and\r\nunfailing straightening of the most stubborn Negro hair. This\r\npreparation was called Kink-No-More, a name not wholly accurate since\r\nusers of it were forced to renew the treatment every fortnight.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervening years many chemists, professional and amateur,\r\nhave been seeking the means of making the downtrodden Aframerican\r\nresemble as closely as possible his white fellow citizen. The\r\ntemporarily effective preparations placed on the market have so far\r\nproved exceedingly profitable to manufacturers, advertising agencies,\r\nNegro newspapers and beauty culturists, while millions of users have\r\nregistered great satisfaction at the opportunity to rid themselves of\r\nkinky hair and grow several shades lighter in color, if only for a\r\nbrief time. With America\'s constant reiteration of the superiority of\r\nwhiteness, the avid search on the part of the black masses for some key\r\nto chromatic perfection is easily understood. Now it would seem that\r\nscience is on the verge of satisfying them.\r\n\r\nDr. Yusaburo Noguchi, head of the Noguchi Hospital at Beppu, Japan,\r\ntold American newspaper reporters in October 1929, that as a result of\r\nfifteen years of painstaking research and experiment he was able to\r\nchange a Negro into a white man. While he admitted that this racial\r\nmetamorphosis could not be effected overnight, he maintained that\r\n"Given time, I could change the Japanese into a race of tall blue-eyed\r\nblonds." The racial transformation, he asserted, could be brought about\r\nby glandular control and electrical nutrition.\r\n\r\nEven more positive is the statement of Mr. Bela Gati, an electrical\r\nengineer residing in New York City, who, in a letter dated August 18,\r\n1930 and addressed to the National Association for the Advancement of\r\nColored People said, in part:\r\n\r\n    "Once I myself was very strongly tanned by the sun and a\r\n    European rural population thought that I was a Negro, too. I did\r\n    not suffer much but the situation was disagreeable. Since that\r\n    time I have studied the problem and I am convinced that the surplus\r\n    of the pigment could be removed. In case you are interested and\r\n    believe that with the aid of your physicians we could carry\r\n    out the necessary experiments, I am willing to send you the\r\n    patent specification ... and my general terms relating to this\r\n    invention.... The expenses are so to say negligible."\r\n\r\nI wish to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr. V. F.\r\nCalverton for his keen interest and friendly encouragement and to my\r\nwife, Josephine Schuyler, whose co\xc3\xb6peration and criticism were of great\r\nhelp in completing _Black No More_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     GEORGE S. SCHUYLER\r\n\r\n                                                         NEW YORK CITY,\r\n                                                    _September 1, 1930_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BLACK NO MORE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\n\r\nMax Disher stood outside the Honky Tonk Club puffing a panatela and\r\nwatching the crowds of white and black folk entering the cabaret. Max\r\nwas tall, dapper and smooth coffee-brown. His negroid features had\r\na slightly satanic cast and there was an insolent nonchalance about\r\nhis carriage. He wore his hat rakishly and faultless evening clothes\r\nunderneath his raccoon coat. He was young, he wasn\'t broke, but he was\r\ndamnably blue. It was New Year\'s Eve, 1933, but there was no spirit\r\nof gaiety and gladness in his heart. How could he share the hilarity\r\nof the crowd when he had no girl? He and Minnie, his high "yallah"\r\nflapper, had quarreled that day and everything was over between them.\r\n\r\n"Women are mighty funny," he mused to himself, "especially yallah\r\nwomen. You could give them the moon and they wouldn\'t appreciate it."\r\nThat was probably the trouble; he\'d given Minnie too much. It didn\'t\r\npay to spend too much on them. As soon as he\'d bought her a new outfit\r\nand paid the rent on a three-room apartment, she\'d grown uppity. Stuck\r\non her color, that\'s what was the matter with her! He took the cigar\r\nout of his mouth and spat disgustedly.\r\n\r\nA short, plump, cherubic black fellow, resplendent in a narrow-brimmed\r\nbrown fedora, camel\'s hair coat and spats, strolled up and clapped him\r\non the shoulder: "Hello, Max!" greeted the newcomer, extending a hand\r\nin a fawn-colored glove, "What\'s on your mind?"\r\n\r\n"Everything, Bunny," answered the debonair Max. "That damn yallah gal\r\no\' mine\'s got all upstage and quit."\r\n\r\n"Say not so!" exclaimed the short black fellow. "Why I thought you and\r\nher were all forty."\r\n\r\n"Were, is right, kid. And after spending my dough, too! It sure makes\r\nme hot. Here I go and buy two covers at the Honky Tonk for tonight,\r\nthinkin\' surely she\'d come and she starts a row and quits!"\r\n\r\n"Shucks!" exploded Bunny, "I wouldn\'t let that worry me none. I\'d take\r\nanother skirt. I wouldn\'t let no dame queer my New Year\'s."\r\n\r\n"So would I, Wise Guy, but all the dames I know are dated up. So here I\r\nam all dressed up and no place to go."\r\n\r\n"You got two reservations, aint you? Well, let\'s you and me go in,"\r\nBunny suggested. "We may be able to break in on some party."\r\n\r\nMax visibly brightened. "That\'s a good idea," he said. "You never can\r\ntell, we might run in on something good."\r\n\r\nSwinging their canes, the two joined the throng at the entrance of the\r\nHonky Tonk Club and descended to its smoky depths. They wended their\r\nway through the maze of tables in the wake of a dancing waiter and sat\r\ndown close to the dance floor. After ordering ginger ale and plenty of\r\nice, they reared back and looked over the crowd.\r\n\r\nMax Disher and Bunny Brown had been pals ever since the war when they\r\nsoldiered together in the old 15th regiment in France. Max was one of\r\nthe Aframerican Fire Insurance Company\'s crack agents, Bunny was a\r\nteller in the Douglass Bank and both bore the reputation of gay blades\r\nin black Harlem. The two had in common a weakness rather prevalent\r\namong Aframerican bucks: they preferred yellow women. Both swore there\r\nwere three things essential to the happiness of a colored gentleman:\r\nyellow money, yellow women and yellow taxis. They had little difficulty\r\nin getting the first and none at all in getting the third but the\r\nyellow women they found flighty and fickle. It was so hard to hold\r\nthem. They were so sought after that one almost required a million\r\ndollars to keep them out of the clutches of one\'s rivals.\r\n\r\n"No more yallah gals for me!" Max announced with finality, sipping his\r\ndrink. "I\'ll grab a black gal first."\r\n\r\n"Say not so!" exclaimed Bunny, strengthening his drink from his huge\r\nsilver flask. "You aint thinkin\' o\' dealin\' in coal, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Well," argued his partner, "it might change my luck. You can trust a\r\nblack gal; she\'ll stick to you."\r\n\r\n"How do you know? You ain\'t never had one. Ever\' gal I ever seen you\r\nwith looked like an ofay."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" grunted Max. "My next one may be an ofay, too! They\'re less\r\ntrouble and don\'t ask you to give \'em the moon."\r\n\r\n"I\'m right with you, pardner," Bunny agreed, "but I gotta have one\r\nwith class. None o\' these Woolworth dames for me! Get you in a peck o\'\r\ntrouble.... Fact is, Big Boy, ain\'t none o\' these women no good. They\r\nall get old on the job."\r\n\r\nThey drank in silence and eyed the motley crowd around them. There\r\nwere blacks, browns, yellows, and whites chatting, flirting, drinking;\r\nrubbing shoulders in the democracy of night life. A fog of tobacco\r\nsmoke wreathed their heads and the din from the industrious jazz band\r\nmade all but the loudest shrieks inaudible. In and out among the tables\r\ndanced the waiters, trays balanced aloft, while the patrons, arrayed in\r\ncolored paper caps, beat time with the orchestra, threw streamers or\r\ngrew maudlin on each other\'s shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Looky here! Lawdy Lawd!" exclaimed Bunny, pointing to the doorway. A\r\nparty of white people had entered. They were all in evening dress and\r\nin their midst was a tall, slim, titian-haired girl who had seemingly\r\nstepped from heaven or the front cover of a magazine.\r\n\r\n"My, my, my!" said Max, sitting up alertly.\r\n\r\nThe party consisted of two men and four women. They were escorted to\r\na table next to the one occupied by the two colored dandies. Max and\r\nBunny eyed them covertly. The tall girl was certainly a dream.\r\n\r\n"Now that\'s my speed," whispered Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Be yourself," said Max. "You couldn\'t touch her with a forty-foot\r\npole."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know, Big Boy," Bunny beamed self-confidently, "You never\r\ncan tell! You never can tell!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I can tell," remarked Disher, "\'cause she\'s a cracker."\r\n\r\n"How you know that?"\r\n\r\n"Man, I can tell a cracker a block away. I wasn\'t born and raised in\r\nAtlanta, Georgia, for nothin\', you know. Just listen to her voice."\r\n\r\nBunny listened. "I believe she is," he agreed.\r\n\r\nThey kept eyeing the party to the exclusion of everything else. Max was\r\nespecially fascinated. The girl was the prettiest creature he\'d ever\r\nseen and he felt irresistibly drawn to her. Unconsciously he adjusted\r\nhis necktie and passed his well-manicured hand over his rigidly\r\nstraightened hair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the white men rose and came over to their table. They\r\nwatched him suspiciously. Was he going to start something? Had he\r\nnoticed that they were staring at the girl? They both stiffened at his\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n"Say," he greeted them, leaning over the table, "do you boys know where\r\nwe can get some decent liquor around here? We\'ve run out of stuff and\r\nthe waiter says he can\'t get any for us."\r\n\r\n"You can get some pretty good stuff right down the street," Max\r\ninformed him, somewhat relieved.\r\n\r\n"They won\'t sell none to him," said Bunny. "They might think he was a\r\nProhibition officer."\r\n\r\n"Could one of you fellows get me some?" asked the man.\r\n\r\n"Sure," said Max, heartily. What luck! Here was the very chance he\'d\r\nbeen waiting for. These people might invite them over to their table.\r\nThe man handed him a ten dollar bill and Max went out bareheaded to get\r\nthe liquor. In ten minutes he was back. He handed the man the quart and\r\nthe change. The man gave back the change and thanked him. There was no\r\ninvitation to join the party. Max returned to his table and eyed the\r\ngroup wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Did he invite you in?" asked Bunny.\r\n\r\n"I\'m back here, aint I?" answered Max, somewhat resentfully.\r\n\r\nThe floor show came on. A black-faced comedian, a corpulent shouter\r\nof mammy songs with a gin-roughened voice, three chocolate soft-shoe\r\ndancers and an octette of wriggling, practically nude, mulatto chorines.\r\n\r\nThen midnight and pandemonium as the New Year swept in. When the din\r\nhad subsided, the lights went low and the orchestra moaned the weary\r\nblues. The floor filled with couples. The two men and two of the women\r\nat the next table rose to dance. The beautiful girl and another were\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going over and ask her to dance," Max suddenly announced to the\r\nsurprised Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Say not so!" exclaimed that worthy. "You\'re fixin\' to get in dutch,\r\nBig Boy."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m gonna take a chance, anyhow," Max persisted, rising.\r\n\r\nThis fair beauty had hypnotized him. He felt that he would give\r\nanything for just one dance with her. Once around the floor with her\r\nslim waist in his arm would be like an eternity in heaven. Yes, one\r\ncould afford to risk repulse for that.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do it, Max!" pleaded Bunny. "Them fellows are liable to start\r\nsomethin\'."\r\n\r\nBut Max was not to be restrained. There was no holding him back when he\r\nwanted to do a thing, especially where a comely damsel was concerned.\r\n\r\nHe sauntered over to the table in his most sheikish manner and stood\r\nlooking down at the shimmering strawberry blond. She was indeed\r\nravishing and her exotic perfume titilated his nostrils despite the\r\nclouds of cigarette smoke.\r\n\r\n"Would you care to dance?" he asked, after a moment\'s hesitation.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him haughtily with cool green eyes, somewhat\r\nastonished at his insolence and yet perhaps secretly intrigued, but her\r\nreply lacked nothing in definiteness.\r\n\r\n"No," she said icily, "I never dance with niggers!" Then turning to her\r\nfriend, she remarked: "Can you beat the nerve of these darkies?" She\r\nmade a little disdainful grimace with her mouth, shrugged daintily and\r\ndismissed the unpleasant incident.\r\n\r\nCrushed and angry, Max returned to his place without a word. Bunny\r\nlaughed aloud in high glee.\r\n\r\n"You said she was a cracker," he gurgled, "an\' now I guess you know it."\r\n\r\n"Aw, go to hell," Max grumbled.\r\n\r\nJust then Billy Fletcher, the headwaiter passed by. Max stopped him.\r\n"Ever see that dame in here before?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Been in here most every night since before Christmas," Billy replied.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who she is?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I heard she was some rich broad from Atlanta up here for the\r\nholidays. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothin\'; I was just wondering."\r\n\r\nFrom Atlanta! His home town. No wonder she had turned him down.\r\nUp here trying to get a thrill in the Black Belt but a thrill from\r\nobservation instead of contact. Gee, but white folks were funny. They\r\ndidn\'t want black folks\' game and yet they were always frequenting\r\nNegro resorts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt three o\'clock Max and Bunny paid their check and ascended to the\r\nstreet. Bunny wanted to go to the breakfast dance at the Dahomey Casino\r\nbut Max was in no mood for it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going home," he announced laconically, hailing a taxi. "Good\r\nnight!"\r\n\r\nAs the cab whirled up Seventh Avenue, he settled back and thought of\r\nthe girl from Atlanta. He couldn\'t get her out of his mind and didn\'t\r\nwant to. At his rooming house, he paid the driver, unlocked the door,\r\nascended to his room and undressed, mechanically. His mind was a\r\nkaleidoscope: Atlanta, sea-green eyes, slender figure, titian hair,\r\nfrigid manner. "I never dance with niggers." Then he fell asleep about\r\nfive o\'clock and promptly dreamed of her. Dreamed of dancing with her,\r\ndining with her, motoring with her, sitting beside her on a golden\r\nthrone while millions of manacled white slaves prostrated themselves\r\nbefore him. Then there was a nightmare of grim, gray men with shotguns,\r\nbaying hounds, a heap of gasoline-soaked faggots and a screeching,\r\nfanatical mob.\r\n\r\nHe awoke covered with perspiration. His telephone was ringing and the\r\nlate morning sunshine was streaming into his room. He leaped from bed\r\nand lifted the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Say," shouted Bunny, "did you see this morning\'s _Times_?"\r\n\r\n"Hell no," growled Max, "I just woke up. Why, what\'s in it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, do you remember Dr. Junius Crookman, that colored fellow that\r\nwent to Germany to study about three years ago? He\'s just come back and\r\nthe _Times_ claims he\'s announced a sure way to turn darkies white.\r\nThought you might be interested after the way you fell for that ofay\r\nbroad last night. They say Crookman\'s going to open a sanitarium in\r\nHarlem right away. There\'s your chance, Big Boy, and it\'s your only\r\nchance." Bunny chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ring off," growled Max. "That\'s a lot of hooey."\r\n\r\nBut he was impressed and a little excited. Suppose there was something\r\nto it? He dressed hurriedly, after a cold shower, and went out to the\r\nnewsstand. He bought a _Times_ and scanned its columns. Yes, there it\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n                 NEGRO ANNOUNCES REMARKABLE DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n               Can Change Black to White in Three Days.\r\n\r\nMax went into Jimmy Johnson\'s restaurant and greedily read the account\r\nwhile awaiting his breakfast. Yes, it must be true. To think of old\r\nCrookman being able to do that! Only a few years ago he\'d been just a\r\nhungry medical student around Harlem. Max put down the paper and stared\r\nvacantly out of the window. Gee, Crookman would be a millionaire in no\r\ntime. He\'d even be a multi-millionaire. It looked as though science\r\nwas to succeed where the Civil War had failed. But how could it be\r\npossible? He looked at his hands and felt at the back of his head where\r\nthe straightening lotion had failed to conquer some of the knots. He\r\ntoyed with his ham and eggs as he envisioned the possibilities of the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden resolution seized him. He looked at the newspaper account\r\nagain. Yes, Crookman was staying at the Phyllis Wheatley Hotel. Why not\r\ngo and see what there was to this? Why not be the first Negro to try\r\nit out? Sure, it was taking a chance, but think of getting white in\r\nthree days! No more jim crow. No more insults. As a white man he could\r\ngo anywhere, be anything he wanted to be, do most anything he wanted\r\nto do, be a free man at last ... and probably be able to meet the girl\r\nfrom Atlanta. What a vision!\r\n\r\nHe rose hurriedly, paid for his breakfast, rushed out of the door,\r\nalmost ran into an aged white man carrying a sign advertising a Negro\r\nfraternity dance, and strode, almost ran, to the Phyllis Wheatley\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nHe tore up the steps two at a time and into the sitting room. It was\r\ncrowded with white reporters from the daily newspapers and black\r\nreporters from the Negro weeklies. In their midst he recognized Dr.\r\nJunius Crookman, tall, wiry, ebony black, with a studious and polished\r\nmanner. Flanking him on either side were Henry ("Hank") Johnson, the\r\n"Numbers" banker and Charlie ("Chuck") Foster, the realtor, looking\r\nvery grave, important and possessive in the midst of all the hullabaloo.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Dr. Crookman was telling the reporters while they eagerly took\r\ndown his statements, "during my first year at college I noticed a black\r\ngirl on the street one day who had several irregular white patches on\r\nher face and hands. That intrigued me. I began to study up on skin\r\ndiseases and found out that the girl was evidently suffering from a\r\nnervous disease known as vitiligo. It is a very rare disease. Both\r\nNegroes and Caucasians occasionally have it, but it is naturally more\r\nconspicuous on blacks than whites. It absolutely removes skin pigment\r\nand sometimes it turns a Negro completely white but only after a period\r\nof thirty or forty years. It occurred to me that if one could discover\r\nsome means of artificially inducing and stimulating this nervous\r\ndisease at will, one might possibly solve the American race problem.\r\nMy sociology teacher had once said that there were but three ways for\r\nthe Negro to solve his problem in America," he gestured with his long\r\nslender fingers, "\'To either get out, get white or get along.\' Since he\r\nwouldn\'t and couldn\'t get out and was getting along only indifferently,\r\nit seemed to me that the only thing for him was to get white." For a\r\nmoment his teeth gleamed beneath his smartly waxed mustache, then he\r\nsobered and went on:\r\n\r\n"I began to give a great deal of study to the problem during my spare\r\ntime. Unfortunately there was very little information on the subject in\r\nthis country. I decided to go to Germany but I didn\'t have the money.\r\nJust when I despaired of getting the funds to carry out my experiments\r\nand studies abroad, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Foster," he indicated the two\r\nmen with a graceful wave of his hand, "came to my rescue. I naturally\r\nattribute a great deal of my success to them."\r\n\r\n"But how is it done?" asked a reporter.\r\n\r\n"Well," smiled Crookman, "I naturally cannot divulge the secret any\r\nmore than to say that it is accomplished by electrical nutrition and\r\nglandular control. Certain gland secretions are greatly stimulated\r\nwhile others are considerably diminished. It is a powerful and\r\ndangerous treatment but harmless when properly done."\r\n\r\n"How about the hair and features?" asked a Negro reporter.\r\n\r\n"They are also changed in the process," answered the biologist. "In\r\nthree days the Negro becomes to all appearances a Caucasian."\r\n\r\n"But is the transformation transferred to the offspring?" persisted the\r\nNegro newspaperman.\r\n\r\n"As yet," replied Crookman, "I have discovered no way to accomplish\r\nanything so revolutionary but I am able to transform a black infant to\r\na white one in twenty-four hours."\r\n\r\n"Have you tried it on any Negroes yet?" queried a sceptical white\r\njournalist.\r\n\r\n"Why of course I have," said the Doctor, slightly nettled. "I would not\r\nhave made my announcement if I had not done so. Come here, Sandol," he\r\ncalled, turning to a pale white youth standing on the outskirts of the\r\ncrowd, who was the most Nordic looking person in the room. "This man is\r\na Senegalese, a former aviator in the French Army. He is living proof\r\nthat what I claim is true."\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman then displayed a photograph of a very black man, somewhat\r\nresembling Sandol but with bushy Negro hair, flat nose and full lips.\r\n"This," he announced proudly, "is Sandol as he looked before taking my\r\ntreatment. What I have done to him I can do to any Negro. He is in good\r\nphysical and mental condition as you all can see."\r\n\r\nThe assemblage was properly awed. After taking a few more notes and a\r\nnumber of photographs of Dr. Crookman, his associates and of Sandol,\r\nthe newspapermen retired. Only the dapper Max Disher remained.\r\n\r\n"Hello, Doc!" he said, coming forward and extending his hand. "Don\'t\r\nyou remember me? I\'m Max Disher."\r\n\r\n"Why certainly I remember you, Max," replied the biologist rising\r\ncordially. "Been a long time since we\'ve seen each other but you\'re\r\nlooking as sharp as ever. How\'s things?"\r\n\r\nThe two men shook hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pretty good. Say, Doc, how\'s chances to get you to try that thing\r\non me? You must be looking for volunteers."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am, but not just yet. I\'ve got to get my equipment set up\r\nfirst. I think now I\'ll be ready for business in a couple of weeks."\r\n\r\nHenry Johnson, the beefy, sleek-jowled, mulatto "Numbers" banker,\r\nchuckled and nudged Dr. Crookman. "Old Max ain\'t losin\' no time, Doc.\r\nWhen that niggah gits white Ah bet he\'ll make up fo\' los\' time with\r\nthese ofay girls."\r\n\r\nCharlie Foster, small, slender, grave, amber-colored, and laconic,\r\nfinally spoke up: "Seems all right, Junius, but there\'ll be hell to\r\npay when you whiten up a lot o\' these darkies and them mulatto babies\r\nstart appearing here and there. Watcha gonna do then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, quit singin\' th\' blues, Chuck," boomed Johnson. "Don\'t cross\r\nbridges \'til yuh come tuh \'em. Doc\'ll fix that okeh. Besides, we\'ll\r\nhave mo\' money\'n Henry Ford by that time."\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be no difficulties whatever," assured Crookman rather\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s hope not."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext day the newspapers carried a long account of the interview with\r\nDr. Junius Crookman interspersed with photographs of him, his backers\r\nand of the Senegalese who had been turned white. It was the talk of the\r\ntown and was soon the talk of the country. Long editorials were written\r\nabout the discovery, learned societies besieged the Negro biologist\r\nwith offers of lecture engagements, magazines begged him for articles,\r\nbut he turned down all offers and refused to explain his treatment.\r\nThis attitude was decried as unbecoming a scientist and it was\r\ninsinuated and even openly stated that nothing more could be expected\r\nfrom a Negro.\r\n\r\nBut Crookman ignored the clamor of the public, and with the financial\r\nhelp of his associates planned the great and lucrative experiment of\r\nturning Negroes into Caucasians.\r\n\r\nThe impatient Max Disher saw him as often as possible and kept track\r\nof developments. He yearned to be the first treated and didn\'t want\r\nto be caught napping. Two objects were uppermost in his mind: To get\r\nwhite and to Atlanta. The statuesque and haughty blonde was ever in\r\nhis thoughts. He was head over heels in love with her and realized\r\nthere was no hope for him to ever win her as long as he was brown. Each\r\nday he would walk past the tall building that was to be the Crookman\r\nSanitarium, watching the workmen and delivery trucks; wondering how\r\nmuch longer he would have to wait before entering upon the great\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nAt last the sanitarium was ready for business. Huge advertisements\r\nappeared in the local Negro weeklies. Black Harlem was on its toes.\r\nCurious throngs of Negroes and whites stood in front of the austere\r\nsix-story building gazing up at its windows.\r\n\r\nInside, Crookman, Johnson and Foster stood nervously about while\r\nhustling attendants got everything in readiness. Outside they could\r\nhear the murmur of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"That means money, Chuck," boomed Johnson, rubbing his beefsteak hands\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Yeh," replied the realtor, "but there\'s one more thing I wanna get\r\nstraight: How about that darky dialect? You can\'t change that."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t necessary, my dear Foster," explained the physician,\r\npatiently. "There is no such thing as Negro dialect, except in\r\nliterature and drama. It is a well-known fact among informed persons\r\nthat a Negro from a given section speaks the same dialect as his white\r\nneighbors. In the South you can\'t tell over the telephone whether you\r\nare talking to a white man or a Negro. The same is true in New York\r\nwhen a Northern Negro speaks into the receiver. I have noticed the same\r\nthing in the hills of West Virginia and Tennessee. The educated Haitian\r\nspeaks the purest French and the Jamaican Negro sounds exactly like\r\nan Englishman. There are no racial or color dialects; only sectional\r\ndialects."\r\n\r\n"Guess you\'re right," agreed Foster, grudgingly.\r\n\r\n"I know I\'m right. Moreover, even if my treatment did not change the\r\nso-called Negro lips, even that would prove to be no obstacle."\r\n\r\n"How come, Doc," asked Johnson.\r\n\r\n"Well, there are plenty of Caucasians who have lips quite as thick and\r\nnoses quite as broad as any of us. As a matter of fact there has been\r\nconsiderable exaggeration about the contrast between Caucasian and\r\nNegro features. The cartoonists and minstrel men have been responsible\r\nfor it very largely. Some Negroes like the Somalis, Filanis, Egyptians,\r\nHausas and Abyssinians have very thin lips and nostrils. So also\r\nhave the Malagasys of Madagascar. Only in certain small sections of\r\nAfrica do the Negroes possess extremely pendulous lips and very broad\r\nnostrils. On the other hand, many so-called Caucasians, particularly\r\nthe Latins, Jews and South Irish, and frequently the most Nordic of\r\npeoples like the Swedes, show almost Negroid lips and noses. Black up\r\nsome white folks and they could deceive a resident of Benin. Then when\r\nyou consider that less than twenty per cent of our Negroes are without\r\nCaucasian ancestry and that close to thirty per cent have American\r\nIndian ancestry, it is readily seen that there cannot be the wide\r\ndifference in Caucasian and Afro-American facial characteristics that\r\nmost people imagine."\r\n\r\n"Doc, you sho\' knows yo\' onions," said Johnson, admiringly. "Doan pay\r\nno \'tenshun to that ole Doubtin\' Thomas. He\'d holler starvation in a\r\npie shop."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a commotion outside and an angry voice was heard above the\r\nhum of low conversation. Then Max Disher burst in the door with a guard\r\nhanging onto his coat tail.\r\n\r\n"Let loose o\' me, Boy," he quarreled. "I got an engagement here. Doc,\r\ntell this man something, will you."\r\n\r\nCrookman nodded to the guard to release the insurance man. "Well, I see\r\nyou\'re right on time, Max."\r\n\r\n"I told you I\'d be Johnny-on-the-spot, didn\'t I?" said Disher,\r\ninspecting his clothes to see if they had been wrinkled.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'re all ready, go into the receiving room there, sign the\r\nregister and get into one of those bathrobes. You\'re first on the list."\r\n\r\nThe three partners looked at each other and grinned as Max disappeared\r\ninto a small room at the end of the corridor. Dr. Crookman went into\r\nhis office to don his white trousers, shoes and smock; Johnson and\r\nFoster entered the business office to supervise the clerical staff,\r\nwhile white-coated figures darted back and forth through the corridors.\r\nOutside, the murmuring of the vast throng grew more audible.\r\n\r\nJohnson showed all of his many gold teeth in a wide grin as he glanced\r\nout the window and saw the queue of Negroes already extending around\r\nthe corner. "Man, man, man!" he chuckled to Foster, "at fifty dollars a\r\nth\'ow this thing\'s gonna have th\' numbah business beat all hollow."\r\n\r\n"Hope so," said Foster, gravely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMax Disher, arrayed only in a hospital bathrobe and a pair of slippers,\r\nwas escorted to the elevator by two white-coated attendants. They got\r\noff on the sixth floor and walked to the end of the corridor. Max was\r\ntrembling with excitement and anxiety. Suppose something should go\r\nwrong? Suppose Doc should make a mistake? He thought of the Elks\'\r\nexcursion every summer to Bear Mountain, the high yellow Minnie and\r\nher colorful apartment, the pleasant evenings at the Dahomey Casino\r\ndoing the latest dances with the brown belles of Harlem, the prancing\r\nchoruses at the Lafayette Theater, the hours he had whiled away at\r\nBoogie\'s and the Honky Tonk Club, and he hesitated. Then he envisioned\r\nhis future as a white man, probably as the husband of the tall blonde\r\nfrom Atlanta, and with firm resolve, he entered the door of the\r\nmysterious chamber.\r\n\r\nHe quailed as he saw the formidable apparatus of sparkling nickel. It\r\nresembled a cross between a dentist\'s chair and an electric chair.\r\nWires and straps, bars and levers protruded from it and a great nickel\r\nheadpiece, like the helmet of a knight, hung over it. The room had only\r\na skylight and no sound entered it from the outside. Around the walls\r\nwere cases of instruments and shelves of bottles filled with strangely\r\ncolored fluids. He gasped with fright and would have made for the door\r\nbut the two husky attendants held him firmly, stripped off his robe\r\nand bound him in the chair. There was no retreat. It was either the\r\nbeginning or the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, haltingly, Max Disher dragged his way down the hall to the\r\nelevator, supported on either side by an attendant. He felt terribly\r\nweak, emptied and nauseated; his skin twitched and was dry and\r\nfeverish; his insides felt very hot and sore. As the trio walked slowly\r\nalong the corridor, a blue-green light would ever and anon blaze\r\nthrough one of the doorways as a patient was taken in. There was a low\r\nhum and throb of machinery and an acrid odor filled the air. Uniformed\r\nnurses and attendants hurried back and forth at their tasks. Everything\r\nwas quiet, swift, efficient, sinister.\r\n\r\nHe felt so thankful that he had survived the ordeal of that horrible\r\nmachine so akin to the electric chair. A shudder passed over him at\r\nthe memory of the hours he had passed in its grip, fed at intervals\r\nwith revolting concoctions. But when they reached the elevator and he\r\nsaw himself in the mirror, he was startled, overjoyed. White at last!\r\nGone was the smooth brown complexion. Gone were the slightly full lips\r\nand Ethiopian nose. Gone was the nappy hair that he had straightened\r\nso meticulously ever since the kink-no-more lotions first wrenched\r\nAframericans from the tyranny and torture of the comb. There would be\r\nno more expenditures for skin whiteners; no more discrimination; no\r\nmore obstacles in his path. He was free! The world was his oyster and\r\nhe had the open sesame of a pork-colored skin!\r\n\r\nThe reflection in the mirror gave him new life and strength. He now\r\nstood erect, without support and grinned at the two tall, black\r\nattendants. "Well, Boys," he crowed, "I\'m all set now. That machine of\r\nDoc\'s worked like a charm. Soon\'s I get a feed under my belt I\'ll be\r\nokeh."\r\n\r\nSix hours later, bathed, fed, clean-shaven, spry, blonde and jubilant,\r\nhe emerged from the out-patient ward and tripped gaily down the\r\ncorridor to the main entrance. He was through with coons, he resolved,\r\nfrom now on. He glanced in a superior manner at the long line of\r\nblack and brown folk on one side of the corridor, patiently awaiting\r\ntreatment. He saw many persons whom he knew but none of them recognized\r\nhim. It thrilled him to feel that he was now indistinguishable from\r\nnine-tenths of the people of the United States; one of the great\r\nmajority. Ah, it was good not to be a Negro any longer!\r\n\r\nAs he sought to open the front door, the strong arm of a guard\r\nrestrained him. "Wait a minute," the man said, "and we\'ll help you get\r\nthrough the mob."\r\n\r\nA moment or two later Max found himself the center of a flying wedge\r\nof five or six husky special policemen, cleaving through a milling\r\ncrowd of colored folk. From the top step of the Sanitarium he had\r\nnoticed the crowd spread over the sidewalk, into the street and around\r\nthe corners. Fifty traffic policemen strained and sweated to keep\r\nprospective patients in line and out from under the wheels of taxicabs\r\nand trucks.\r\n\r\nFinally he reached the curb, exhausted from the jostling and squeezing,\r\nonly to be set upon by a mob of newspaper photographers and reporters.\r\nAs the first person to take the treatment, he was naturally the center\r\nof attraction for about fifteen of these journalistic gnats. They asked\r\na thousand questions seemingly all at once. What was his name? How did\r\nhe feel? What was he going to do? Would he marry a white woman? Did he\r\nintend to continue living in Harlem?\r\n\r\nMax would say nothing. In the first place, he thought to himself, if\r\nthey\'re so anxious to know all this stuff, they ought to be willing to\r\npay for it. He needed money if he was going to be able to thoroughly\r\nenjoy being white; why not get some by selling his story? The\r\nreporters, male and female, begged him almost with tears in their eyes\r\nfor a statement but he was adamant.\r\n\r\nWhile they were wrangling, an empty taxicab drove up. Pushing the\r\ninquisitive reporters to one side, Max leaped into it and yelled\r\n"Central Park!" It was the only place he could think of at the moment.\r\nHe wanted to have time to compose his mind, to plan the future in this\r\ngreat world of whiteness. As the cab lurched forward, he turned and was\r\nastonished to find another occupant, a pretty girl.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be scared," she smiled. "I knew you would want to get away\r\nfrom that mob so I went around the corner and got a cab for you. Come\r\nalong with me and I\'ll get everything fixed up for you. I\'m a reporter\r\nfrom _The Scimitar_. We\'ll give you a lot of money for your story."\r\nShe talked rapidly. Max\'s first impulse had been to jump out of the\r\ncab, even at the risk of having to face again the mob of reporters and\r\nphotographers he had sought to escape, but he changed his mind when he\r\nheard mention of money.\r\n\r\n"How much?" he asked, eyeing her. She was very comely and he noted that\r\nher ankles were well turned.\r\n\r\n"Oh, probably a thousand dollars," she replied.\r\n\r\n"Well, that sounds good." A thousand dollars! What a time he could have\r\nwith that! Broadway for him as soon as he got paid off.\r\n\r\nAs they sped down Seventh Avenue, the newsboys were yelling the latest\r\neditions. "Ex--try! Ex--try! Blacks turning white! Blacks turning\r\nwhite!... Read all about the gr-r-reat discovery! Paper, Mister!\r\nPaper!... Read all about Dr. Crookman."\r\n\r\nHe settled back while they drove through the park and glanced\r\nfrequently at the girl by his side. She looked mighty good; wonder\r\ncould he talk business with her? Might go to dinner and a cabaret. That\r\nwould be the best way to start.\r\n\r\n"What did you say your name was?" he began.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say," she stalled.\r\n\r\n"Well, you have a name, haven\'t you?" he persisted.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I have?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re not scared to tell it, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to know my name?"\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s nothing wrong about wanting to know a pretty girl\'s\r\nname, is there?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my name\'s Smith, Sybil Smith. Now are you satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet. I want to know something more. How would you like to go to\r\ndinner with me tonight?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know and I won\'t know until I\'ve had the experience." She\r\nsmiled coquettishly. Going out with him, she figured, would make the\r\nbasis of a rattling good story for tomorrow\'s paper. "Negro\'s first\r\nnight as a Caucasian!" Fine!\r\n\r\n"Say, you\'re a regular fellow," he said, beaming upon her. "I\'ll get a\r\ngreat kick out of going to dinner with you because you\'ll be the only\r\none in the place that\'ll know I\'m a Negro."\r\n\r\nDown at the office of _The Scimitar_, it didn\'t take Max long to come\r\nto an agreement, tell his story to a stenographer and get a sheaf of\r\ncrisp, new bills. As he left the building a couple of hours later with\r\nMiss Smith on his arm, the newsboys were already crying the extra\r\nedition carrying the first installment of his strange tale. A huge\r\nphotograph of him occupied the entire front page of the tabloid. Lucky\r\nfor him that he\'d given his name as William Small, he thought.\r\n\r\nHe was annoyed and a little angered. What did they want to put his\r\npicture all over the front of the paper for? Now everybody would know\r\nwho he was. He had undergone the tortures of Doc Crookman\'s devilish\r\nmachine in order to escape the conspicuousness of a dark skin and now\r\nhe was being made conspicuous because he had once had a dark skin!\r\nCould one never escape the plagued race problem?\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about that," comforted Miss Smith. "Nobody\'ll recognize\r\nyou. There are thousands of white people, yes millions, that look\r\nlike you do." She took his arm and snuggled up closer. She wanted to\r\nmake him feel at home. It wasn\'t often a poor, struggling newspaper\r\nwoman got a chap with a big bankroll to take her out for the evening.\r\nMoreover, the description she would write of the experience might win\r\nher a promotion.\r\n\r\nThey walked down Broadway in the blaze of white lights to a\r\ndinner-dance place. To Max it was like being in heaven. He had strolled\r\nthrough the Times Square district before but never with such a feeling\r\nof absolute freedom and sureness. No one now looked at him curiously\r\nbecause he was with a white girl, as they had when he came down there\r\nwith Minnie, his former octoroon lady friend. Gee, it was great!\r\n\r\nThey dined and they danced. Then they went to a cabaret, where, amid\r\nsmoke, noise and body smells, they drank what was purported to be\r\nwhiskey and watched a semi-nude chorus do its stuff. Despite his\r\nhappiness Max found it pretty dull. There was something lacking in\r\nthese ofay places of amusement or else there was something present\r\nthat one didn\'t find in the black-and-tan resorts in Harlem. The\r\njoy and abandon here was obviously forced. Patrons went to extremes\r\nto show each other they were having a wonderful time. It was all so\r\nstrained and quite unlike anything to which he had been accustomed.\r\nThe Negroes, it seemed to him, were much gayer, enjoyed themselves\r\nmore deeply and yet they were more restrained, actually more refined.\r\nEven their dancing was different. They followed the rhythm accurately,\r\neffortlessly and with easy grace; these lumbering couples, out of\r\nstep half the time and working as strenuously as stevedores emptying\r\nthe bowels of a freighter, were noisy, awkward, inelegant. At their\r\nbest they were gymnastic where the Negroes were sensuous. He felt a\r\nmomentary pang of mingled disgust, disillusionment and nostalgia. But\r\nit was only momentary. He looked across at the comely Sybil and then\r\naround at the other white women, many of whom were very pretty and\r\nexpensively gowned, and the sight temporarily drove from his mind the\r\nthoughts that had been occupying him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey parted at three o\'clock, after she had given him her telephone\r\nnumber. She pecked him lightly on the cheek in payment, doubtless, for\r\na pleasant evening\'s entertainment. Somewhat disappointed because she\r\nhad failed to show any interest in his expressed curiosity about the\r\ninterior of her apartment, he directed the chauffeur to drive him to\r\nHarlem. After all, he argued to himself in defense of his action, he\r\nhad to get his things.\r\n\r\nAs the cab turned out of Central Park at 110th Street he felt,\r\ncuriously enough, a feeling of peace. There were all the old familiar\r\nsights: the all-night speakeasies, the frankfurter stands, the\r\nloiterers, the late pedestrians, the chop suey joints, the careening\r\ntaxicabs, the bawdy laughter.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t resist the temptation to get out at 133rd Street and go\r\ndown to Boogie\'s place, the hangout of his gang. He tapped, an eye\r\npeered through a hole, appraised him critically, then disappeared and\r\nthe hole was closed. There was silence.\r\n\r\nMax frowned. What was the matter with old Bob? Why didn\'t he open\r\nthat door? The cold January breeze swept down into the little court\r\nwhere he stood and made him shiver. He knocked a little louder, more\r\ninsistently. The eye appeared again.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s \'at?" growled the doorkeeper.\r\n\r\n"It\'s me, Max Disher," replied the ex-Negro.\r\n\r\n"Go \'way f\'m here, white man. Dis heah place is closed."\r\n\r\n"Is Bunny Brown in there?" asked Max in desperation.\r\n\r\n"Yeh, he\'s heah. Does yuh know him? Well, Ah\'ll call \'im out heah and\r\nsee if he knows you."\r\n\r\nMax waited in the cold for about two or three minutes and then the door\r\nsuddenly opened and Bunny Brown, a little unsteady, came out. He peered\r\nat Max in the light from the electric bulb over the door.\r\n\r\n"Hello Bunny," Max greeted him. "Don\'t know me do you? It\'s me, Max\r\nDisher. You recognize my voice, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\nBunny looked again, rubbed his eyes and shook his head. Yes, the voice\r\nwas Max Disher\'s, but this man was white. Still, when he smiled his\r\neyes revealed the same sardonic twinkle--so characteristic of his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"Max," he blurted out, "is that you, sure enough? Well, for cryin\' out\r\nloud! Damned \'f you ain\'t been up there to Crookman\'s and got fixed\r\nup. Well, hush my mouth! Bob, open that door. This is old Max Disher.\r\nDone gone up there to Crookman\'s and got all white on my hands. He\'s\r\njust too tight, with his blond hair, \'n everything."\r\n\r\nBob opened the door, the two friends entered, sat down at one of the\r\nsmall round tables in the narrow, smoke-filled cellar and were soon\r\nsurrounded with cronies. They gazed raptly at his colorless skin,\r\ncommented on the veins showing blue through the epidermis, stroked his\r\nash-blond hair and listened with mouths open to his remarkable story.\r\n\r\n"Whatcha gonna do now, Max?" asked Boogie, the rangy, black,\r\nbullet-headed proprietor.\r\n\r\n"I know just what that joker\'s gonna do," said Bunny. "He\'s goin\' back\r\nto Atlanta. Am I right, Big Boy?"\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t wrong," Max agreed. "I\'m goin\' right on down there, brother,\r\nand make up for lost time."\r\n\r\n"Whadayah mean?" asked Boogie.\r\n\r\n"Boy, it would take me until tomorrow night to tell you and then you\r\nwouldn\'t understand."\r\n\r\nThe two friends strolled up the avenue. Both were rather mum. They had\r\nbeen inseparable pals since the stirring days in France. Now they were\r\nabout to be parted. It wasn\'t as if Max was going across the ocean to\r\nsome foreign country; there would be a wider gulf separating them: the\r\ngreat sea of color. They both thought about it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be pretty lonesome without you, Bunny."\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t you, Big Boy."\r\n\r\n"Well, why don\'t you go ahead and get white and then we could stay\r\ntogether. I\'ll give you the money."\r\n\r\n"Say not so! Where\'d you get so much jack all of a sudden?" asked Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Sold my story to _The Scimitar_ for a grand."\r\n\r\n"Paid in full?"\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t paid in part!"\r\n\r\n"All right, then, I\'ll take you up, Heavy Sugar." Bunny held out his\r\nplump hand and Max handed him a hundred-dollar bill.\r\n\r\nThey were near the Crookman Sanitarium. Although it was five o\'clock\r\non a Sunday morning, the building was brightly lighted from cellar to\r\nroof and the hum of electric motors could be heard, low and powerful.\r\nA large electric sign hung from the roof to the second floor. It\r\nrepresented a huge arrow outlined in green with the words BLACK-NO-MORE\r\nrunning its full length vertically. A black face was depicted at the\r\nlower end of the arrow while at the top shone a white face to which the\r\narrow was pointed. First would appear the outline of the arrow; then,\r\nBLACK-NO-MORE would flash on and off. Following that the black face\r\nwould appear at the bottom and beginning at the lower end the long\r\narrow with its lettering would appear progressively until its tip was\r\nreached, when the white face at the top would blazon forth. After that\r\nthe sign would flash off and on and the process would be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn front of the sanitarium milled a half-frozen crowd of close to four\r\nthousand Negroes. A riot squad armed with rifles, machine guns and tear\r\ngas bombs maintained some semblance of order. A steel cable stretched\r\nfrom lamp post to lamp post the entire length of the block kept the\r\nstruggling mass of humanity on the sidewalk and out of the path of the\r\ntraffic. It seemed as if all Harlem were there. As the two friends\r\nreached the outskirts of the mob, an ambulance from the Harlem Hospital\r\ndrove up and carried away two women who had been trampled upon.\r\n\r\nLined up from the door to the curb was a gang of tough special guards\r\ndredged out of the slums. Grim Irish from Hell\'s Kitchen, rough Negroes\r\nfrom around 133rd Street and 5th Avenue (New York\'s "Beale Street") and\r\ntough Italians from the lower West Side. They managed with difficulty\r\nto keep an aisle cleared for incoming and outgoing patients. Near the\r\ncurb were stationed the reporters and photographers.\r\n\r\nThe noise rose and fell. First there would be a low hum of voices.\r\nSteadily it would rise and rise in increasing volume as the speakers\r\nbecame more animated and reach its climax in a great animal-like roar\r\nas the big front door would open and a whitened Negro would emerge.\r\nThen the mass would surge forward to peer at and question the ersatz\r\nNordic. Sometimes the ex-Ethiopian would quail before the mob and jump\r\nback into the building. Then the hardboiled guards would form a flying\r\nsquad and hustle him to a waiting taxicab. Other erstwhile Aframericans\r\nissuing from the building would grin broadly, shake hands with friends\r\nand relatives and start to graphically describe their experience while\r\nthe Negroes around them enviously admired their clear white skins.\r\n\r\nIn between these appearances the hot dog and peanut vendors did a\r\nbrisk trade, along with the numerous pickpockets of the district. One\r\nslender, anemic, ratty-looking mulatto Negro was almost beaten to death\r\nby a gigantic black laundress whose purse he had snatched. A Negro\r\nselling hot roasted sweet potatoes did a land-office business while the\r\nneighboring saloons, that had increased so rapidly in number since the\r\nenactment of the Volstead Law that many of their Italian proprietors\r\npaid substantial income taxes, sold scores of gallons of incredibly\r\natrocious hootch.\r\n\r\n"Well, bye, bye, Max," said Bunny, extending his hand. "I\'m goin\' in\r\nan\' try my luck."\r\n\r\n"So long, Bunny. See you in Atlanta. Write me general delivery."\r\n\r\n"Why, ain\'t you gonna wait for me, Max?"\r\n\r\n"Naw! I\'m fed up on this town."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you ain\'t kiddin\' me, Big Boy. I know you want to look up that\r\nbroad you saw in the Honky Tonk New Year\'s Eve," Bunny beamed.\r\n\r\nMax grinned and blushed slightly. They shook hands and parted. Bunny\r\nran up the aisle from the curb, opened the sanitarium door and without\r\nturning around, disappeared within.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or so, Max stood irresolutely in the midst of the\r\ngibbering crowd of people. Unaccountably he felt at home here\r\namong these black folk. Their jests, scraps of conversation and\r\nlusty laughter all seemed like heavenly music. Momentarily he felt\r\na disposition to stay among them, to share again their troubles\r\nwhich they seemed always to bear with a lightness that was yet not\r\nindifference. But then, he suddenly realized with just a tiny trace of\r\nremorse that the past was forever gone. He must seek other pastures,\r\nother pursuits, other playmates, other loves. He was white now. Even\r\nif he wished to stay among his folk, they would be either jealous\r\nor suspicious of him, as they were of most octoroons and nearly all\r\nwhites. There was no other alternative than to seek his future among\r\nthe Caucasians with whom he now rightfully belonged.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, he thought, it was a glorious new adventure. His eyes\r\ntwinkled and his pulse quickened as he thought of it. Now he could\r\ngo anywhere, associate with anybody, be anything he wanted to be. He\r\nsuddenly thought of the comely miss he had seen in the Honky Tonk on\r\nNew Year\'s Eve and the greatly enlarged field from which he could\r\nselect his loves. Yes, indeed there were advantages in being white. He\r\nbrightened and viewed the tightly-packed black folk around him with a\r\nsuperior air. Then, thinking again of his clothes at Mrs. Blandish\'s,\r\nthe money in his pocket and the prospect for the first time of riding\r\ninto Atlanta in a Pullman car and not as a Pullman porter, he turned\r\nand pushed his way through the throng.\r\n\r\nHe strolled up West 139th Street to his rooming place, stepping lightly\r\nand sniffing the early morning air. How good it was to be free, white\r\nand to possess a bankroll! He fumbled in his pocket for his little\r\nmirror and looked at himself again and again from several angles. He\r\nstroked his pale blond hair and secretly congratulated himself that he\r\nwould no longer need to straighten it nor be afraid to wet it. He gazed\r\nraptly at his smooth, white hands with the blue veins showing through.\r\nWhat a miracle Dr. Crookman had wrought!\r\n\r\nAs he entered the hallway, the mountainous form of his landlady loomed\r\nup. She jumped back as she saw his face.\r\n\r\n"What you doing in here?" she almost shouted. "Where\'d you get a key to\r\nthis house?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s me, Max Disher," he assured her with a grin at her astonishment.\r\n"Don\'t know me, do you?"\r\n\r\nShe gazed incredulously into his face. "Is that you sure enough, Max?\r\nHow in the devil did you get so white?"\r\n\r\nHe explained and showed her a copy of _The Scimitar_ containing his\r\nstory. She switched on the hall light and read it. Contrasting emotions\r\nplayed over her face, for Mrs. Blandish was known in the business world\r\nas Mme. Sisseretta Blandish, the beauty specialist, who owned the\r\nswellest hair-straightening parlor in Harlem. Business, she thought to\r\nherself, was bad enough, what with all of the competition, without this\r\nDr. Crookman coming along and killing it altogether.\r\n\r\n"Well," she sighed, "I suppose you\'re going down town to live, now. I\r\nalways said niggers didn\'t really have any race pride."\r\n\r\nUneasy, Max made no reply. The fat, brown woman turned with a\r\ndisdainful sniff and disappeared into a room at the end of the hall. He\r\nran lightly upstairs to pack his things.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, as the taxicab bearing him and his luggage bowled\r\nthrough Central Park, he was in high spirits. He would go down to the\r\nPennsylvania Station and get a Pullman straight into Atlanta. He would\r\nstop there at the best hotel. He wouldn\'t hunt up any of his folks. No,\r\nthat would be too dangerous. He would just play around, enjoy life and\r\nlaugh at the white folks up his sleeve. God! What an adventure! What\r\na treat it would be to mingle with white people in places where as a\r\nyouth he had never dared to enter. At last he felt like an American\r\ncitizen. He flecked the ash of his panatela out of the open window of\r\nthe cab and sank back in the seat feeling at peace with the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Junius Crookman, looking tired and worn, poured himself another\r\ncup of coffee from the percolator near by and turning to Hank Johnson,\r\nasked "What about that new electrical apparatus?"\r\n\r\n"On th\' way, Doc. On th\' way," replied the former Numbers baron. "Just\r\ntalkin\' to th\' man this mornin\'. He says we\'ll get it tomorrow, maybe."\r\n\r\n"Well, we certainly need it," said Chuck Foster, who sat beside him on\r\nthe large leather divan. "We can\'t handle all of the business as it is."\r\n\r\n"How about those new places you\'re buying?" asked the physician.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve bought the big private house on Edgecombe Avenue for\r\nfifteen thousand and the workmen are getting it in shape now. It ought\r\nto be ready in about a week if nothing happens," Foster informed him.\r\n\r\n"If nuthin\' happens?" echoed Johnson. "Whut\'s gonna happen? We\'re\r\nsettin\' on th\' world, ain\'t we? Our racket\'s within th\' law, ain\'t it?\r\nWe\'re makin\' money faster\'n we can take it in, ain\'t we? Whut could\r\nhappen? This here is the best and safest graft I\'ve ever been in."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you never can tell," cautioned the quondom realtor. "These white\r\nnewspapers, especially in the South, are beginning to write some pretty\r\nstrong editorials against us and we\'ve only been running two weeks. You\r\nknow how easy it is to stir up the fanatical element. Before we know it\r\nthey\'re liable to get a law passed against us."\r\n\r\n"Not if I c\'n git to th\' legislature first," interrupted Johnson. "Yuh\r\nknow, Ah knows how tuh handle these white folks. If yuh \'Say it with\r\nBucks\' you c\'n git anything yuh want."\r\n\r\n"There is something in what Foster says, though," Dr. Crookman said.\r\n"Just look at this bunch of clippings we got in this morning. Listen\r\nto these: \'The Viper in Our Midst,\' from the Richmond _Blade_; \'The\r\nMenace of Science\' from the Memphis _Bugle_; \'A Challenge to Every\r\nWhite Man\' from the Dallas _Sun_; \'Police Battle Black Mob Seeking\r\nWhite Skins,\' from the Atlanta _Topic_; \'Negro Doctor Admits Being\r\nTaught by Germans,\' from the St. Louis _North American_. Here\'s a\r\nline or two from an editorial in the Oklahoma City _Hatchet_: \'There\r\nare times when the welfare of our race must take precedence over law.\r\nOpposed as we always have been to mob violence as the worst enemy of\r\ndemocratic government, we cannot help but feel that the intelligent\r\nwhite men and women of New York City who are interested in the purity\r\nand preservation of their race should not permit the challenge of\r\nCrookmanism to go unanswered, even though these black scoundrels may be\r\nwithin the law. There are too many criminals in this country already\r\nhiding behind the skirts of the law.\'\r\n\r\n"And lastly, one from the Tallahassee _Announcer_ says: \'While it is\r\nthe right of every citizen to do what he wants to do with his money,\r\nthe white people of the United States cannot remain indifferent to\r\nthis discovery and its horrible potentialities. Hundreds of Negroes\r\nwith newly-acquired white skins have already entered white society and\r\nthousands will follow them. The black race from one end of the country\r\nto the other has in two short weeks gone completely crazy over the\r\nprospect of getting white. Day by day we see the color line which we\r\nhave so laboriously established being rapidly destroyed. There would\r\nnot be so much cause for alarm in this, were it not for the fact that\r\nthis vitiligo is not hereditary. In other words, THE OFFSPRING OF THESE\r\nWHITENED NEGROES WILL BE NEGROES! This means that your daughter, having\r\nmarried a supposed white man, may find herself with a black baby! Will\r\nthe proud white men of the Southland so far forget their traditions as\r\nto remain idle while this devilish work is going on?\'"\r\n\r\n"No use singin\' th\' blues," counseled Johnson. "We ain\' gonna be\r\nboth\'ed heah, even if them crackahs down South do raise a little hell.\r\nJus\' lissen to th\' sweet music of that mob out theah! Eve\'y scream\r\nmeans fifty bucks. On\'y reason we ain\'t makin\' mo\' money is \'cause we\r\nain\'t got no mo\' room."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Dr. Crookman agreed. "We\'ve turned out one hundred a\r\nday for fourteen days." He leaned back and lit a cigarette.\r\n\r\n"At fifty bucks a th\'ow," interrupted Johnson, "that means we\'ve took\r\nin seventy thousand dollahs. Great Day in th\' mornin\'! Didn\'t know tha\r\nwas so much jack in Harlem."\r\n\r\n"Yes," continued Crookman, "we\'re taking in thirty-five thousand\r\ndollars a week. As soon as you and Foster get that other place fixed up\r\nwe\'ll be making twice that much."\r\n\r\nFrom the hallway came the voice of the switchboard operator\r\nmonotonously droning out her instructions: "No, Dr. Crookman cannot\r\nsee anyone.... Dr. Crookman has nothing to say.... Dr. Crookman will\r\nissue a statement shortly.... Fifty Dollars.... No, Dr. Crookman isn\'t\r\na mulatto.... I\'m very sorry but I cannot answer that question."\r\n\r\nThe three friends sat in silence amid the hum of activity around them.\r\nHank Johnson smiled down at the end of his cigar as he thought back\r\nover his rather colorful and hectic career. To think that today he was\r\none of the leading Negroes of the world, one who was taking an active\r\nand important part in solving the most vexatious problem in American\r\nlife, and yet only ten years before he had been working on a Carolina\r\nchain gang. Two years he had toiled on the roads under the hard eye and\r\nready rifle of a cruel white guard; two years of being beaten, kicked\r\nand cursed, of poor food and vermin-infested habitations; two years for\r\nparticipating in a little crap game. Then he had drifted to Charleston,\r\ngot a job in a pool room, had a stroke of luck with the dice, come\r\nto New York and landed right in the midst of the Numbers racket.\r\nBecoming a collector or "runner," he had managed his affairs well\r\nenough to be able to start out soon as a "banker." Money had poured\r\nin from Negroes eager to chance one cent in the hope of winning six\r\ndollars. Some won but most lost and he had prospered. He had purchased\r\nan apartment house, paid off the police, dabbled in the bail bond\r\ngame, given a couple of thousand dollars to advance Negro Art and been\r\nelected Grand Permanent Shogun of the Ancient and Honorable Order of\r\nCrocodiles, Harlem\'s largest and most prosperous secret society. Then\r\nyoung Crookman had come to him with his proposition. At first he had\r\nhesitated about helping him but later was persuaded to do so when the\r\nyoung man bitterly complained that the dicty Negroes would not help to\r\npay for the studies abroad. What a stroke of luck, getting in on the\r\nground floor like this! They\'d all be richer than Rockefeller inside\r\nof a year. Twelve million Negroes at fifty dollars apiece! Great Day\r\nin the morning! Hank spat regally into the brass cuspidor across the\r\noffice and reared back contentedly on the soft cushion of the divan.\r\n\r\nChuck Foster was also seeing his career in retrospect. His life had\r\nnot been as colorful as that of Hank Johnson. The son of a Birmingham\r\nbarber, he had enjoyed such educational advantages as that community\r\nafforded the darker brethren; had become a schoolteacher, an insurance\r\nagent and a social worker in turn. Then, along with the tide of\r\nmigration, he had drifted first to Cincinnati, then to Pittsburgh\r\nand finally to New York. There the real estate field, unusually\r\nlucrative because of the paucity of apartments for the increasing Negro\r\npopulation, had claimed him. Cautious, careful, thrifty and devoid of\r\nsentimentality, he had prospered, but not without some ugly rumors\r\nbeing broadcast about his sharp business methods. As he slowly worked\r\nhis way up to the top of Harlem society, he had sought to live down\r\nthis reputation for double-dealing and shifty practices, all too true\r\nof the bulk of his fellow realtors in the district, by giving large\r\nsums to the Young Men\'s and Young Women\'s Christian Associations, by\r\noffering scholarships to young Negroes, by staging elaborate parties\r\nto which the dicty Negroes of the community were invited. He had been\r\nglad of the opportunity to help subsidize young Crookman\'s studies\r\nabroad when Hank Johnson pointed out the possibilities of the venture.\r\nNow, although the results so far exceeded his wildest dreams, his\r\nnatural conservatism and timidity made him somewhat pessimistic about\r\nthe future. He supposed a hundred dire results of their activities and\r\nonly the day before he had increased the amount of his life insurance.\r\nHis mind was filled with doubts. He didn\'t like so much publicity. He\r\nwanted a sort of genteel popularity but no notoriety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite the coffee and cigarettes, Dr. Junius Crookman was sleepy.\r\nThe responsibility, the necessity of overseeing the work of his\r\nphysicians and nurses, the insistence of the newspapers and the medical\r\nprofession that he reveal the secrets of his treatment and a thousand\r\nother vexatious details had kept him from getting proper rest. He had,\r\nindeed, spent most of his time in the sanitarium.\r\n\r\nThis hectic activity was new to him. Up until a month ago his\r\nthirty-five years had been peaceful and, in the main, studious ones.\r\nThe son of an Episcopal clergyman, he had been born and raised in a\r\ncity in central New York, his associates carefully selected in order\r\nto protect him as much as possible from the defeatist psychology so\r\nprevalent among American Negroes and given every opportunity and\r\ninducement to learn his profession and become a thoroughly cultivated\r\nand civilized man. His parents, though poor, were proud and boasted\r\nthat they belonged to the Negro aristocracy. He had had to work his\r\nway through college because of the failure of his father\'s health\r\nbut he had come very little in contact with the crudity, coarseness\r\nand cruelty of life. He had been monotonously successful but he was\r\nsensible enough to believe that a large part of it was due, like most\r\nsuccess, to chance. He saw in his great discovery the solution to\r\nthe most annoying problem in American life. Obviously, he reasoned,\r\nif there were no Negroes, there could be no Negro problem. Without a\r\nNegro problem, Americans could concentrate their attention on something\r\nconstructive. Through his efforts and the activities of Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated, it would be possible to do what agitation, education\r\nand legislation had failed to do. He was na\xc3\xafvely surprised that there\r\nshould be opposition to his work. Like most men with a vision, a plan,\r\na program or a remedy, he fondly imagined people to be intelligent\r\nenough to accept a good thing when it was offered to them, which was\r\nconclusive evidence that he knew little about the human race.\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman prided himself above all on being a great lover of\r\nhis race. He had studied its history, read of its struggles and\r\nkept up with its achievements. He subscribed to six or seven Negro\r\nweekly newspapers and two of the magazines. He was so interested in\r\nthe continued progress of the American Negroes that he wanted to\r\nremove all obstacles in their path by depriving them of their racial\r\ncharacteristics. His home and office were filled with African masks\r\nand paintings of Negroes by Negroes. He was what was known in Negro\r\nsociety as a Race Man. He was wedded to everything black except the\r\nblack woman--his wife was a white girl with remote Negro ancestry,\r\nof the type that Negroes were wont to describe as being "able to\r\npass for white." While abroad he had spent his spare time ransacking\r\nthe libraries for facts about the achievements of Negroes and having\r\nliaisons with comely and available fraus and frauleins.\r\n\r\n"Well, Doc," said Hank Johnson, suddenly, "you\'d bettah go on home \'n\r\ngit some sleep. Ain\' no use killin\' you\'sef. Eve\'thing\'s gonna be all\r\nright heah. You ain\' gotta thing tuh worry \'bout."\r\n\r\n"How\'s he gonna get out of here with that mob in front?" Chuck\r\ninquired. "A man almost needs a tank to get through that crowd of\r\ndarkies."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ah\'ve got all that fixed, Calamity Jane," Johnson remarked\r\ncasually. "All he\'s gotta do is tuh go on down staihs tuh the basem\'nt,\r\ngo out th\' back way an\' step into th\' alley. My car\'ll be theah waitin\'\r\nfo\' \'im."\r\n\r\n"That\'s awfully nice of you, Johnson," said the physician. "I am dead\r\ntired. I think I\'ll be a new man if I can get a few hours of sleep."\r\n\r\nA black man in white uniform opened the door and announced:\r\n"Mrs. Crookman!" He held the door open for the Doctor\'s petite,\r\nstylishly-dressed wife to enter. The three men sprang to their feet.\r\nJohnson and Foster eyed the beautiful little octoroon appreciatively as\r\nthey bowed, thinking how easily she could "pass for white," which would\r\nhave been something akin to a piece of anthracite coal passing for\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n"Darling!" she exclaimed, turning to her husband. "Why don\'t you come\r\nhome and get some rest? You\'ll be ill if you keep on in this way."\r\n\r\n"Jus\' whut Ah bin tellin\' him, Mrs. Crookman," Johnson hastened to say.\r\n"We got eve\'ything fixed tuh send \'im off."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, Junius, we\'d better be going," she said decisively.\r\n\r\nPutting on a long overcoat over his white uniform, Dr. Crookman,\r\nwearily and meekly followed his spouse out of the door.\r\n\r\n"Mighty nice looking girl, Mrs. Crookman," Foster observed.\r\n\r\n"Nice lookin\'!" echoed Johnson, with mock amazement. "Why, nigguh, that\r\nooman would make uh rabbit hug uh houn\'. Doc sez she\'s cullud, an\' she\r\nsez so, but she looks mighty white tuh me."\r\n\r\n"Everything that looks white ain\'t white in this man\'s country," Foster\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeantime there was feverish activity in Harlem\'s financial\r\ninstitutions. At the Douglass Bank the tellers were busier than\r\nbootleggers on Christmas Eve. Moreover, they were short-handed because\r\nof the mysterious absence of Bunny Brown. A long queue of Negroes\r\nextended down one side of the bank, out of the front door and around\r\nthe corner, while bank attendants struggled to keep them in line.\r\nEverybody was drawing out money; no one was depositing. In vain the\r\nbank officials pleaded with them not to withdraw their funds. The\r\nNegroes were adamant: they wanted their money and wanted it quick. Day\r\nafter day this had gone on ever since Black-No-More, Incorporated, had\r\nstarted turning Negroes white. At first, efforts were made to bulldoze\r\nand intimidate the depositors but that didn\'t succeed. These people\r\nwere in no mood to be trifled with. A lifetime of being Negroes in the\r\nUnited States had convinced them that there was great advantage in\r\nbeing white.\r\n\r\n"Mon, whutcha tahlk ab\'t?" scoffed a big, black British West Indian\r\nwoman with whom an official was remonstrating not to draw out her\r\nmoney. "Dis heah\'s mah mahney, ain\'t it? Yuh use mah mahney alla time,\r\naintcha? Whutcha mean, Ah shouldn\'t draw\'t out?... You gimme mah\r\nmahney or Ah broke up dis place!"\r\n\r\n"Are you closing your account, Mr. Robinson?" a soft-voiced mulatto\r\nteller inquired of a big, rusty stevedore.\r\n\r\n"Ah ain\'t openin\' it," was the rejoinder. "Ah wants th\' whole thing,\r\nan\' Ah don\'t mean maybe."\r\n\r\nSimilar scenes were being enacted at the Wheatley Trust Company and at\r\nthe local Post Office station.\r\n\r\nAn observer passing up and down the streets would have noted a general\r\nexodus from the locality. Moving vans were backed up to apartment\r\nhouses on nearly every block.\r\n\r\nThe "For Rent" signs were appearing in larger number in Harlem than\r\nat any time in twenty-five years. Landlords looked on helplessly as\r\napartment after apartment emptied and was not filled. Even the refusal\r\nto return deposits did not prevent the tenants from moving out. What,\r\nindeed, was fifty, sixty or seventy dollars when one was leaving\r\nbehind insult, ostracism, segregation and discrimination? Moreover,\r\nthe whitened Negroes were saving a great deal of money by being able\r\nto change localities. The mechanics of race prejudice had forced them\r\ninto the congested Harlem area where, at the mercy of white and black\r\nreal estate sharks, they had been compelled to pay exorbitant rentals\r\nbecause the demand for housing far exceeded the supply. As a general\r\nrule the Negroes were paying one hundred per cent more than white\r\ntenants in other parts of the city for a smaller number of rooms and\r\nworse service.\r\n\r\nThe installment furniture and clothing houses in the area were also\r\nbeginning to feel the results of the activities of Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated. Collectors were reporting their inability to locate\r\ncertain families or the articles they had purchased on time. Many of\r\nthe colored folk, it was said, had sold their furniture to second-hand\r\nstores and vanished with the proceeds into the great mass of white\r\ncitizenry.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there seemed to be more white people on the streets of\r\nHarlem than at any time in the past twenty years. Many of them appeared\r\nto be on the most intimate terms with the Negroes, laughing, talking,\r\ndining and dancing in a most un-Caucasian way. This sort of association\r\nhad always gone on at night but seldom in the daylight.\r\n\r\nStrange Negroes from the West and South who had heard the good news\r\nwere to be seen on the streets and in public places, patiently awaiting\r\ntheir turn at the Crookman Institute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMadame Sisseretta Blandish sat disconsolately in an armchair near the\r\nfront door of her ornate hair-straightening shop, looking blankly at\r\nthe pedestrians and traffic passing to and fro. These two weeks had\r\nbeen hard ones for her. Everything was going out and nothing coming\r\nin. She had been doing very well at her vocation for years and was\r\nacclaimed in the community as one of its business leaders. Because of\r\nher prominence as the proprietor of a successful enterprise engaged\r\nin making Negroes appear as much like white folks as possible, she\r\nhad recently been elected for the fourth time a Vice-President of the\r\nAmerican Race Pride League. She was also head of the Woman\'s Committee\r\nof the New York Branch of the Social Equality League and held an\r\nimportant place in local Republican politics. But all of these honors\r\nbrought little or no money with them. They didn\'t help to pay her rent\r\nor purchase the voluminous dresses she required to drape her Amazonian\r\nform. Only that day her landlord had brought her the sad news that he\r\neither wanted his money or the premises.\r\n\r\nWhere, she wondered, would she get the money. Like most New Yorkers\r\nshe put up a big front with very little cash behind it, always looking\r\nhopefully forward to the morrow for a lucky break. She had two-thirds\r\nof the rent money already, by dint of much borrowing, and if she\r\ncould "do" a few nappy heads she would be in the clear; but hardly a\r\ncustomer had crossed her threshold in a fortnight, except two or three\r\nJewish girls from downtown who came up regularly to have their hair\r\nstraightened because it wouldn\'t stand inspection in the Nordic world.\r\nThe Negro women had seemingly deserted her. Day after day she saw her\r\nold customers pass by hurriedly without even looking in her direction.\r\nVerily a revolution was taking place in Negro society.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Simpson!" cried the hair-straightener after a passing young\r\nlady. "Ain\'t you going to say hello?"\r\n\r\nThe young woman halted reluctantly and approached the doorway. Her\r\nbrown face looked strained. Two weeks before she would have been a rare\r\nsight in the Black Belt because her kinky hair was not straightened; it\r\nwas merely combed, brushed and neatly pinned up. Miss Simpson had vowed\r\nthat she wasn\'t going to spend any dollar a week having her hair "done"\r\nwhen she only lacked fifteen dollars of having money enough to quit the\r\nNegro race forever.\r\n\r\n"Sorry, Mrs. Blandish," she apologized, "but I swear I didn\'t see\r\nyou. I\'ve been just that busy that I haven\'t had eyes for anything or\r\nanybody except my job and back home again. You know I\'m all alone now.\r\nYes, Charlie went over two weeks ago and I haven\'t heard a word from\r\nhim. Just think of that! After all I\'ve done for that nigger. Oh well!\r\nI\'ll soon be over there myself. Another week\'s work will fix me all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" snorted Mme. Blandish. "That\'s all you niggers are thinking\r\nabout nowadays. Why don\'t you come down here and give me some\r\nbusiness? If I don\'t hurry up and make some more money I\'ll have to\r\nclose up this place and go to work myself."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m sorry, Mrs. Blandish," the girl mumbled indifferently,\r\nmoving off toward the corner to catch the approaching street car, "but\r\nI guess I can hold out with this here bad hair until Saturday night.\r\nYou know I\'ve taken too much punishment being dark these twenty-two\r\nyears to miss this opportunity.... Well," she flung over her shoulder,\r\n"Goodbye! See you later."\r\n\r\nMadame Blandish settled her 250 pounds back into her armchair and\r\nsighed heavily. Like all American Negroes she had desired to be white\r\nwhen she was young and before she entered business for herself and\r\nbecame a person of consequence in the community. Now she had lived\r\nlong enough to have no illusions about the magic of a white skin. She\r\nliked her business and she liked her social position in Harlem. As a\r\nwhite woman she would have to start all over again, and she wasn\'t so\r\nsure of herself. Here at least she was somebody. In the great Caucasian\r\nworld she would be just another white woman, and they were becoming a\r\ndrug on the market, what with the simultaneous decline of chivalry,\r\nthe marriage rate and professional prostitution. She had seen too many\r\nelderly, white-haired Caucasian females scrubbing floors and toiling\r\nin sculleries not to know what being just another white woman meant.\r\nYet she admitted to herself that it would be nice to get over being the\r\nbutt for jokes and petty prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe Madame was in a quandary and so also were hundreds of others in the\r\nupper stratum of Harlem life. With the Negro masses moving out from\r\nunder them, what other alternative did they have except to follow.\r\nTrue, only a few hundred Negroes had so far vanished from their wonted\r\nhaunts, but it was known that thousands, tens of thousands, yes,\r\nmillions would follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Fisher, alias Max Disher, joined the Easter Sunday crowds,\r\ntwirling his malacca stick and ogling the pretty flappers who passed\r\ngiggling in their Spring finery. For nearly three months he had idled\r\naround the Georgia capital hoping to catch a glimpse of the beautiful\r\ngirl who on New Year\'s Eve had told him "I never dance with niggers."\r\nHe had searched diligently in almost every stratum of Atlanta society,\r\nbut he had failed to find her. There were hundreds of tall, beautiful,\r\nblonde maidens in the city; to seek a particular one whose name one did\r\nnot know was somewhat akin to hunting for a Russian Jew in the Bronx or\r\na particular Italian gunman in Chicago.\r\n\r\nFor three months he had dreamed of this girl, carefully perused the\r\nsociety columns of the local newspapers on the chance that her picture\r\nmight appear in them. He was like most men who have been repulsed by a\r\npretty girl, his desire for her grew stronger and stronger.\r\n\r\nHe was not finding life as a white man the rosy existence he had\r\nanticipated. He was forced to conclude that it was pretty dull and that\r\nhe was bored. As a boy he had been taught to look up to white folks as\r\njust a little less than gods; now he found them little different from\r\nthe Negroes, except that they were uniformly less courteous and less\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nOften when the desire for the happy-go-lucky, jovial good-fellowship of\r\nthe Negroes came upon him strongly, he would go down to Auburn Avenue\r\nand stroll around the vicinity, looking at the dark folk and listening\r\nto their conversation and banter. But no one down there wanted him\r\naround. He was a white man and thus suspect. Only the black women who\r\nran the "Call Houses" on the hill wanted his company. There was nothing\r\nleft for him except the hard, materialistic, grasping, ill-bred society\r\nof the whites. Sometimes a slight feeling of regret that he had left\r\nhis people forever would cross his mind, but it fled before the painful\r\nmemories of past experiences in this, his home town.\r\n\r\nThe unreasoning and illogical color prejudice of most of the people\r\nwith whom he was forced to associate, infuriated him. He often laughed\r\ncynically when some coarse, ignorant white man voiced his opinion\r\nconcerning the inferior mentality and morality of the Negroes. He was\r\nmoving in white society now and he could compare it with the society\r\nhe had known as a Negro in Atlanta and Harlem. What a let-down it was\r\nfrom the good breeding, sophistication, refinement and gentle cynicism\r\nto which he had become accustomed as a popular young man about town in\r\nNew York\'s Black Belt. He was not able to articulate this feeling but\r\nhe was conscious of the reaction nevertheless.\r\n\r\nFor a week, now, he had been thinking seriously of going to work. His\r\nthousand dollars had dwindled to less than a hundred. He would have to\r\nfind some source of income and yet the young white men with whom he\r\ntalked about work all complained that it was very scarce. Being white,\r\nhe finally concluded, was no Open Sesame to employment for he sought\r\nwork in banks and insurance offices without success.\r\n\r\nDuring his period of idleness and soft living, he had followed the news\r\nand opinion in the local daily press and confessed himself surprised\r\nat the antagonistic attitude of the newspapers toward Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated. From the vantage point of having formerly been a Negro,\r\nhe was able to see how the newspapers were fanning the color prejudice\r\nof the white people. Business men, he found, were also bitterly opposed\r\nto Dr. Crookman and his efforts to bring about chromatic democracy in\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of these people puzzled him. Was not Black-No-More\r\ngetting rid of the Negroes upon whom all of the blame was placed for\r\nthe backwardness of the South? Then he recalled what a Negro street\r\nspeaker had said one night on the corner of 138th Street and Seventh\r\nAvenue in New York: that unorganized labor meant cheap labor; that\r\nthe guarantee of cheap labor was an effective means of luring new\r\nindustries into the South; that so long as the ignorant white masses\r\ncould be kept thinking of the menace of the Negro to Caucasian race\r\npurity and political control, they would give little thought to\r\nlabor organization. It suddenly dawned upon Matthew Fisher that this\r\nBlack-No-More treatment was more of a menace to white business than to\r\nwhite labor. And not long afterward he became aware of the money-making\r\npossibilities involved in the present situation.\r\n\r\nHow could he work it? He was not known and he belonged to no\r\norganization. Here was a veritable gold mine but how could he reach\r\nthe ore? He scratched his head over the problem but could think of no\r\nsolution. Who would be interested in it that he could trust?\r\n\r\nHe was pondering this question the Monday after Easter while\r\nbreakfasting in an armchair restaurant when he noticed an advertisement\r\nin a newspaper lying in the next chair. He read it and then re-read it:\r\n\r\n                        THE KNIGHTS OF NORDICA\r\n\r\n              Want 10,000 Atlanta White Men and Women to\r\n              Join in the Fight for White Race Integrity.\r\n\r\n                      Imperial Klonklave Tonight\r\n\r\n          The racial integrity of the Caucasian Race is being\r\n             threatened by the activities of a scientific\r\n                      black Beelzebub in New York\r\n\r\n                     Let us Unite Now Before It Is\r\n\r\n                               TOO LATE!\r\n\r\n                     Come to Nordica Hall Tonight\r\n                            Admission Free.\r\n\r\n                          Rev. Henry Givens,\r\n                         Imperial Grand Wizard\r\n\r\nHere, Matthew figured, was just what he had been looking for. Probably\r\nhe could get in with this fellow Givens. He finished his cup of coffee,\r\nlit a cigar and paying his check, strolled out into the sunshine of\r\nPeachtree Street.\r\n\r\nHe took the trolley out to Nordica Hall. It was a big, unpainted\r\nbarn-like edifice, with a suite of offices in front and a huge\r\nauditorium in the rear. A new oil cloth sign reading "THE KNIGHTS OF\r\nNORDICA" was stretched across the front of the building.\r\n\r\nMatthew paused for a moment and sized up the edifice. Givens must have\r\nsome money, he thought, to keep up such a large place. Might not be a\r\nbad idea to get a little dope on him before going inside.\r\n\r\n"This fellow Givens is a pretty big guy around here, ain\'t he?" he\r\nasked the young man at the soda fountain across the street.\r\n\r\n"Yessah, he\'s one o\' th\' bigges\' men in this heah town. Used to be a\r\nbig somethin\' or other in th\' old Ku Klux Klan \'fore it died. Now he\'s\r\nstahtin\' this heah Knights o\' Nordica."\r\n\r\n"He must have pretty good jack," suggested Matthew.\r\n\r\n"He oughtta have," answered the soda jerker. "My paw tells me he was\r\nclose to th\' money when he was in th\' Klan."\r\n\r\nHere, thought Matthew, was just the place for him. He paid for his soda\r\nand walked across the street to the door marked "Office." He felt a\r\nslight tremor of uneasiness as he turned the knob and entered. Despite\r\nhis white skin he still possessed the fear of the Klan and kindred\r\norganizations possessed by most Negroes.\r\n\r\nA rather pretty young stenographer asked him his business as he walked\r\ninto the ante room. Better be bold, he thought. This was probably the\r\nbest chance he would have to keep from working, and his funds were\r\ngetting lower and lower.\r\n\r\n"Please tell Rev. Givens, the Imperial Grand Wizard, that Mr. Matthew\r\nFisher of the New York Anthropological Society is very anxious to have\r\nabout a half-hour\'s conversation with him relative to his new venture."\r\nMatthew spoke in an impressive, businesslike manner, rocked back on his\r\nheels and looked profound.\r\n\r\n"Yassah," almost whispered the awed young lady, "I\'ll tell him." She\r\nwithdrew into an inner office and Matthew chuckled softly to himself.\r\nHe wondered if he could impress this old fakir as easily as he had the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nRev. Henry Givens, Imperial Grand Wizard of the Knights of Nordica, was\r\na short, wizened, almost-bald, bull-voiced, ignorant ex-evangelist, who\r\nhad come originally from the hilly country north of Atlanta. He had\r\nhelped in the organization of the Ku Klux Klan following the Great War\r\nand had worked with a zeal only equalled by his thankfulness to God for\r\nescaping from the precarious existence of an itinerant saver of souls.\r\n\r\nNot only had the Rev. Givens toiled diligently to increase the\r\nprestige, power and membership of the defunct Ku Klux Klan, but he had\r\nalso been a very hard worker in withdrawing as much money from its\r\ntreasury as possible. He convinced himself, as did the other officers,\r\nthat this stealing was not stealing at all but merely appropriation of\r\nrightful reward for his valuable services. When the morons finally\r\ntired of supporting the show and the stream of ten-dollar memberships\r\ndeclined to a trickle, Givens had been able to retire gracefully and\r\nlive on the interest of his money.\r\n\r\nThen, when the newspapers began to recount the activities of\r\nBlack-No-More, Incorporated, he saw a vision of work to be done, and\r\nfounded the Knights of Nordica. So far there were only a hundred\r\nmembers but he had high hopes for the future. Tonight, he felt would\r\ntell the story. The prospect of a full treasury to dip into again made\r\nhis little gray eyes twinkle and the palms of his skinny hands itch.\r\n\r\nThe stenographer interrupted him to announce the newcomer.\r\n\r\n"Hum-n!" said Givens, half to himself. "New York Anthropological\r\nSociety, eh? This feller must know somethin\'. Might be able to use him\r\nin this business.... All right, show him in!"\r\n\r\nThe two men shook hands and swiftly appraised each other. Givens waved\r\nMatthew to a chair.\r\n\r\n"How can I serve you, Mr. Fisher?" he began in sepulchral tone dripping\r\nwith unction.\r\n\r\n"It is rather," countered Matthew in his best salesman\'s croon, "how\r\nI can serve you and your valuable organization. As an anthropologist,\r\nI have, of course, been long interested in the work with which you\r\nhave been identified. It has always seemed to me that there was no\r\nquestion in American life more important than that of preserving the\r\nintegrity of the white race. We all know what has been the fate of\r\nthose nations that have permitted their blood to be polluted with that\r\nof inferior breeds." (He had read some argument like that in a Sunday\r\nsupplement not long before, which was the extent of his knowledge\r\nof anthropology.) "This latest menace of Black-No-More is the most\r\nformidable the white people of America have had to face since the\r\nfounding of the Republic. As a resident of New York City, I am aware,\r\nof course, of the extent of the activities of this Negro Crookman and\r\nhis two associates. Already thousands of blacks have passed over into\r\nthe white race. Not satisfied with operating in New York City, they\r\nhave opened their sanitariums in twenty other cities from Coast to\r\nCoast. They open a new one almost every day. In their literature and\r\nadvertisements in the darky newspapers they boast that they are now\r\nturning four thousand Negroes white every day." He knitted his blond\r\neyebrows. "You see how great the menace is? At this rate there will not\r\nbe a Negro in the country in ten years, for you must remember that the\r\nrate is increasing every day as new sanitariums are opened. Don\'t you\r\nsee that something must be done about this immediately? Don\'t you see\r\nthat Congress must be aroused; that these places must be closed?" The\r\nyoung man glared with belligerent indignation.\r\n\r\nRev. Givens saw. He nodded his head as Matthew, now glorying in his\r\nnewly-discovered eloquence made point after point, and concluded that\r\nthis pale, dapper young fellow, with his ready tongue, his sincerity,\r\nhis scientific training and knowledge of the situation ought to prove a\r\nvaluable asset to the Knights of Nordica.\r\n\r\n"I tried to interest some agencies in New York," Matthew continued,\r\n"but they are all blind to this menace and to their duty. Then someone\r\ntold me of you and your valuable work, and I decided to come down here\r\nand have a talk with you. I had intended to suggest the organization\r\nof some such militant secret order as you have started, but since\r\nyou\'ve already seen the necessity for it, I want to hasten to offer my\r\nservices as a scientific man and one familiar with the facts and able\r\nto present them to your members."\r\n\r\n"I should be very glad," boomed Givens, "very happy, indeed, Brother\r\nFisher, to have you join us. We need you. I believe you can help us a\r\ngreat deal. Would you, er--ah, be interested in coming out to the mass\r\nmeeting this evening? It would help us tremendously to get members if\r\nyou would be willing to get up and tell the audience what you have just\r\nrelated about the progress of this iniquitous nigger corporation in New\r\nYork."\r\n\r\nMatthew pretended to think over the matter for a moment or two and then\r\nagreed. If he made a hit at the initial meeting, he would be sure to\r\nget on the staff. Once there he could go after the larger game. Unlike\r\nGivens, he had no belief in the racial integrity nonsense nor any\r\nconfidence in the white masses whom he thought were destined to flock\r\nto the Knights of Nordica. On the contrary he despised and hated them.\r\nHe had the average Negro\'s justifiable fear of the poor whites and only\r\nplanned to use them as a stepladder to the real money.\r\n\r\nWhen Matthew left, Givens congratulated himself upon the fact that he\r\nhad been able to attract such talent to the organization in its very\r\ninfancy. His ideas must be sound, he concluded, if scientists from New\r\nYork were impressed by them. He reached over, pulled the dictionary\r\nstand toward him and opened the big book at A.\r\n\r\n"Lemme see, now," he muttered aloud. "Anthropology. Better git that\r\nword straight \'fore I go talkin\' too much about it.... Humn! Humn!...\r\nThat boy must know a hull lot." He read over the definition of the\r\nword twice without understanding it, closed the dictionary, pushed it\r\naway from him, and then cutting off a large chew of tobacco from his\r\nplug, he leaned back in his swivel chair to rest after the unaccustomed\r\nmental exertion.\r\n\r\nMatthew went gaily back to his hotel. "Man alive!" he chortled to\r\nhimself. "What a lucky break! Can\'t keep old Max down long.... Will I\r\nspeak to \'em? Well, I won\'t stay quiet!" He felt so delighted over the\r\nprospect of getting close to some real money that he treated himself to\r\nan expensive dinner and a twenty-five-cent cigar. Afterward he inquired\r\nfurther about old man Givens from the house detective, a native\r\nAtlantan.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s well heeled--the old crook!" remarked the detective. "Damnify\r\ncould ever understand how such ignorant people get a-hold of th\' money;\r\nbut there y\'are. Owns as pretty a home as you can find around these\r\nparts an\' damn \'f he ain\'t stahtin\' a new racket."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he\'ll make anything out of it?" inquired Matthew,\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n"Say, Brother, you mus\' be a stranger in these parts. These damn,\r\nignorant crackers will fall fer anything fer a while. They ain\'t\r\nhad no Klan here fer goin\' on three years. Leastwise it ain\'t been\r\nfunctionin\'." The old fellow chuckled and spat a stream of tobacco\r\njuice into a nearby cuspidor. Matthew sauntered away. Yes, the pickings\r\nought to be good.\r\n\r\nEqually enthusiastic was the Imperial Grand Wizard when he came home\r\nto dinner that night. He entered the house humming one of his favorite\r\nhymns and his wife looked up from the evening paper with surprise\r\non her face. The Rev. Givens was usually something of a grouch but\r\ntonight he was as happy as a pickpocket at a country fair.\r\n\r\n"What\'s th\' mattah with you?" she inquired, sniffing suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Honey," he gurgled, "I think this here Knights of Nordica is going\r\nover big; going over big! My fame is spreading. Only today I had a\r\nlong talk with a famous anthropologist from New York and he\'s going to\r\naddress our mass meeting tonight."\r\n\r\n"Whut\'s an anthropologist?" asked Mrs. Givens, wrinkling her seamy brow.\r\n\r\n"Oh-er, well, he\'s one of these here scientists what knows all about\r\nthis here business what\'s going on up there in New York where them\r\nniggers is turning each other white," explained Rev. Givens hastily but\r\nfirmly. "He\'s a mighty smaht feller and I want you and Helen to come\r\nout and hear him."\r\n\r\n"B\'lieve Ah will," declared Mrs. Givens, "if this heah rheumatism\'ll\r\nle\' me foh a while. Doan know \'bout Helen, though. Evah since that gal\r\nwent away tuh school she ain\'t bin int\'rested in nuthin\' upliftin\'!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Givens spoke in a grieved tone and heaved her narrow chest in a\r\ndeep sigh. She didn\'t like all this newfangled foolishness of these\r\nyoung folks. They were getting away from God, that\'s what they were,\r\nand she didn\'t like it. Mrs. Givens was a Christian. There was no doubt\r\nabout it because she freely admitted it to everybody, with or without\r\nprovocation. Of course she often took the name of the Creator in vain\r\nwhen she got to quarreling with Henry; she had the reputation among her\r\nfriends of not always stating the exact truth; she hated Negroes; her\r\nspouse had made bitter and profane comment concerning her virginity\r\non their wedding night; and as head of the ladies\' auxiliary of the\r\ndefunct Klan she had copied her husband\'s financial methods; but that\r\nshe was a devout Christian no one doubted. She believed the Bible from\r\ncover to cover, except what it said about people with money, and she\r\nread it every evening aloud, greatly to the annoyance of the Imperial\r\nGrand Wizard and his modern and comely daughter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Givens had probably once been beautiful but the wear and tear of a\r\nlong life as the better half of an itinerant evangelist was apparent.\r\nHer once flaming red hair was turning gray and roan-like, her hatchet\r\nface was a criss-cross of wrinkles and lines, she was round-shouldered,\r\nhollow-chested, walked with a stoop and her long, bony, white hands\r\nlooked like claws. She alternately dipped snuff and smoked an\r\nevil-smelling clay pipe, except when there was company at the house. At\r\nsuch times Helen would insist her mother "act like civilized people."\r\n\r\nHelen was twenty and quite confident that she herself was civilized.\r\nWhether she was or not, she was certainly beautiful. Indeed, she was\r\nsuch a beauty that many of the friends of the family insisted that she\r\nmust have been adopted. Taller than either of her parents, she was\r\nstately, erect, well proportioned, slender, vivid and knew how to wear\r\nher clothes. In only one way did she resemble her parents and that was\r\nin things intellectual. Any form of mental effort, she complained, made\r\nher head ache, and so her parents had always let her have her way about\r\nstudying.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eleven she had been taken from the third grade in public\r\nschool and sent to an exclusive seminary for the double purpose\r\nof gaining social prestige and concealing her mental incapacity.\r\nAt sixteen when her instructors had about despaired of her, they\r\nwere overjoyed by the decision of her father to send the girl to a\r\n"finishing school" in the North. The "finishing school" about finished\r\nwhat intelligence Helen possessed; but she came forth, four years\r\nlater, more beautiful, with a better knowledge of how to dress and\r\nhow to act in exclusive society, enough superficialities to enable\r\nher to get by in the "best" circles and a great deal of that shallow\r\nfacetiousness that passes for sophistication in American upper-class\r\nlife. A winter in Manhattan had rounded out her education. Now she was\r\nback home, thoroughly ashamed of her grotesque parents, and, like the\r\nother girls of her set, anxious to get a husband who at the same time\r\nwas handsome, intelligent, educated, refined and rolling in wealth.\r\nAs she was ignorant of the fact that no such man existed, she looked\r\nconfidently forward into the future.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care to go down there among all those gross people," she\r\ninformed her father at the dinner table when he broached the subject\r\nof the meeting. "They\'re so crude and elemental, don\'t you know," she\r\nexplained, arching her narrow eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"The common people are the salt of the earth," boomed Rev. Givens. "If\r\nit hadn\'t been for the common people we wouldn\'t have been able to get\r\nthis home and send you off to school. You make me sick with all your\r\nmodern ideas. You\'d do a lot better if you\'d try to be more like your\r\nMa."\r\n\r\nBoth Mrs. Givens and Helen looked quickly at him to see if he was\r\nsmiling. He wasn\'t.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'tcha go, Helen?" pleaded Mrs. Givens. "Yo fathah sez this\r\nheah man f\'m N\'Yawk is uh--uh scientist or somethin\' an\' knows a whole\r\nlot about things. Yuh might l\'arn somethin\'. Ah\'d go mys\'f if \'twasn\'t\r\nfo mah rheumatism." She sighed in self-pity and finished gnawing a\r\ndrumstick.\r\n\r\nHelen\'s curiosity was aroused and although she didn\'t like the idea of\r\nsitting among a lot of mill hands, she was anxious to see and hear this\r\nreputedly brilliant young man from the great metropolis where not long\r\nbefore she had lost both her provincialism and chastity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right," she assented with mock reluctance. "I\'ll go."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Nordica\'s flag-draped auditorium slowly filled. It was\r\na bare, cavernous structure, with sawdust on the floor, a big platform\r\nat one end, row after row of folding wooden chairs and illuminated by\r\nlarge, white lights hanging from the rafters. On the platform was a row\r\nof five chairs, the center one being high-backed and gilded. On the\r\nlectern downstage was a bulky bible. A huge American flag was stretched\r\nacross the rear wall.\r\n\r\nThe audience was composed of the lower stratum of white working people:\r\nhard-faced, lantern-jawed, dull-eyed adult children, seeking like all\r\nhumanity for something permanent in the eternal flux of life. The\r\nyoung girls in their cheap finery with circus makeup on their faces;\r\nthe young men, aged before their time by child labor and a violent\r\nenvironment; the middle-aged folk with their shiny, shabby garb and\r\nbeaten countenances; all ready and eager to be organized for any\r\npurpose except improvement of their intellects and standard of living.\r\n\r\nRev. Givens opened the meeting with a prayer "for the success, O God,\r\nof this thy work, to protect the sisters and wives and daughters of\r\nthese, thy people, from the filthy pollution of an alien race."\r\n\r\nA choir of assorted types of individuals sang "Onward Christian\r\nSoldiers" earnestly, vociferously and badly.\r\n\r\nThey were about to file off the platform when the song leader, a big,\r\nbeefy, jovial mountain of a man, leaped upon the stage and restrained\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute, folks, wait a minute," he commanded. Then turning to\r\nthe assemblage: "Now people let\'s put some pep into this. We wanna all\r\nbe happy and get in th\' right spirit for this heah meetin\'. Ah\'m gonna\r\nask the choir to sing th\' first and last verses ovah ag\'in, and when\r\nthey come to th\' chorus, Ah wantcha to all join in. Doan be \'fraid.\r\nJesus wouldn\'t be \'fraid to sing \'Onward Christian Soldiers,\' now would\r\nhe? Come on, then. All right, choir, you staht; an\' when Ah wave mah\r\nhan\' you\'all join in on that theah chorus."\r\n\r\nThey obediently followed his directions while he marched up and down\r\nthe platform, red-faced and roaring and waving his arms in time. When\r\nthe last note had died away, he dismissed the choir and stepping to the\r\nedge of the stage he leaned far out over the audience and barked at\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\n"Come on, now, folks! Yuh caint slow up on Jesus now. He won\'t be\r\nsatisfied with jus\' one ole measly song. Yuh gotta let \'im know that\r\nyuh love \'im; that y\'re happy an\' contented; that yuh ain\'t got no\r\ntroubles an\' ain\'t gonna have any. Come on, now. Le\'s sing that ole\r\nfavorite what yo\'all like so well: \'Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old\r\nKit Bag and Smile, Smile, Smile.\'" He bellowed and they followed him.\r\nAgain the vast hall shook with sound. He made them rise and grasp each\r\nother by the hand until the song ended.\r\n\r\nMatthew, who sat on the platform alongside old man Givens viewed the\r\nspectacle with amusement mingled with amazement. He was amused because\r\nof the similarity of this meeting to the religious orgies of the more\r\nignorant Negroes and amazed that earlier in the evening he should\r\nhave felt any qualms about lecturing to these folks on anthropology,\r\na subject with which neither he nor his hearers were acquainted. He\r\nquickly saw that these people would believe anything that was shouted\r\nat them loudly and convincingly enough. He knew what would fetch their\r\napplause and bring in their memberships and he intended to repeat it\r\nover and over.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Grand Wizard spent a half-hour introducing the speaker of\r\nthe evening, dwelt upon his supposed scholastic attainments, but took\r\npains to inform them that, despite Matthew\'s vast knowledge, he still\r\nbelieved in the Word of God, the sanctity of womanhood and the purity\r\nof the white race.\r\n\r\nFor an hour Matthew told them at the top of his voice what they\r\nbelieved: i.e., that a white skin was a sure indication of the\r\npossession of superior intellectual and moral qualities; that all\r\nNegroes were inferior to them; that God had intended for the United\r\nStates to be a white man\'s country and that with His help they could\r\nkeep it so; that their sons and brothers might inadvertently marry\r\nNegresses or, worse, their sisters and daughters might marry Negroes,\r\nif Black-No-More, Incorporated, was permitted to continue its dangerous\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nFor an hour he spoke, interrupted at intervals by enthusiastic gales\r\nof applause, and as he spoke his eye wandered over the females in the\r\naudience, noting the comeliest ones. As he wound up with a spirited\r\nappeal for eager soldiers to join the Knights of Nordica at five\r\ndollars per head and the half-dozen "planted" emissaries led the march\r\nof suckers to the platform, he noted for the first time a girl who sat\r\nin the front row and gazed up at him raptly.\r\n\r\nShe was a titian blonde, well-dressed, beautiful and strangely\r\nfamiliar. As he retired amid thunderous applause to make way for Rev.\r\nGivens and the money collectors, he wondered where he had seen her\r\nbefore. He studied her from his seat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he knew. It was she! The girl who had spurned him; the girl\r\nhe had sought so long; the girl he wanted more than anything in the\r\nworld! Strange that she should be here. He had always thought of her as\r\na refined, educated and wealthy lady, far above associating with such\r\npeople as these. He was in a fever to meet her, some way, before she\r\ngot out of his sight again, and yet he felt just a little disappointed\r\nto find her here.\r\n\r\nHe could hardly wait until Givens seated himself again before\r\nquestioning him as to the girl\'s identity. As the beefy song leader led\r\nthe roaring of the popular closing hymn, he leaned toward the Imperial\r\nGrand Wizard and shouted: "Who is that tall golden-haired girl sitting\r\nin the front row? Do you know her?"\r\n\r\nRev. Givens looked out over the audience, craning his skinny neck and\r\nblinking his eyes. Then he saw the girl, sitting within twenty feet of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"You mean that girl sitting right in front, there?" he asked, pointing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that one," said Matthew, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Heh! Heh! Heh!" chuckled the Wizard, rubbing his stubbly chin. "Why\r\nthat there\'s my daughter, Helen. Like to meet her?"\r\n\r\nMatthew could hardly believe his ears. Givens\'s daughter! Incredible!\r\nWhat a coincidence! What luck! Would he like to meet her? He leaned\r\nover and shouted "Yes."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nA huge silver monoplane glided gracefully to the surface of Mines Field\r\nin Los Angeles and came to a pretty stop after a short run. A liveried\r\nfootman stepped out of the forward compartment armed with a stool which\r\nhe placed under the rear door. Simultaneously a high-powered foreign\r\ncar swept up close to the airplane and waited. The rear door of the\r\nairplane opened, and to the apparent surprise of the nearby mechanics\r\na tall, black, distinguished-looking Negro stepped out and down to\r\nthe ground, assisted by the hand of the footman. Behind him came a\r\npale young man and woman, evidently secretaries. The three entered the\r\nlimousine which rapidly drove off.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that coon?" asked one of the mechanics, round-eyed and\r\nrespectful, like all Americans, in the presence of great wealth.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know who that is?" inquired another, pityingly. "Why that\'s\r\nthat Dr. Crookman. You know, the fellow what\'s turnin\' niggers white.\r\nSee that B N M on the side of his plane? That stands for Black-No-More.\r\nGee, but I wish I had just half the jack he\'s made in the last six\r\nmonths!"\r\n\r\n"Why I thought from readin\' th\' papers," protested the first speaker,\r\n"that th\' law had closed up his places and put \'im outta business."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s a lotta hockey," said the other fellow. "Why just yesterday\r\nth\' newspapers said that Black-No-More was openin\' a place on Central\r\nAvenue. They already got one in Oakland, so a coon told me yesterday."\r\n\r\n"\'Sfunny," ventured a third mechanic, as they wheeled the big plane\r\ninto a nearby hangar, "how he don\'t have nuthin\' but white folks around\r\nhim. He must not like nigger help. His chauffeur\'s white, his footman\'s\r\nwhite an\' that young gal and feller what was with him are white."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" challenged the first speaker. "They may be darkies\r\nthat he\'s turned into white folks."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," the other replied. "It\'s gittin\' so yuh can\'t tell\r\nwho\'s who. I think that there Knights of Nordica ought to do something\r\nabout it. I joined up with \'em two months ago but they ain\'t done\r\nnuthin\' but sell me an ole uniform an\' hold a coupla meetin\'s."\r\n\r\nThey lapsed into silence. Sandol, the erstwhile Senegalese, stepped\r\nfrom the cockpit grinning. "Ah, zese Americains," he muttered to\r\nhimself as he went over the engine, examining everything minutely.\r\n\r\n"Where\'d yuh come from, buddy?" asked one of the mechanics.\r\n\r\n"Den-vair," Sandol replied.\r\n\r\n"Whatcha doin\', makin\' a trip around th\' country?" queried another.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we air, what you callem, on ze tour inspectione," the aviator\r\ncontinued. They could think of no more to say and soon strolled off.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAround an oval table on the seventh floor of a building on Central\r\nAvenue, sat Dr. Junius Crookman, Hank Johnson, Chuck Foster, Ranford\r\nthe Doctor\'s secretary and four other men. At the lower end of the\r\ntable Miss Bennett, Ranford\'s stenographer, was taking notes. A\r\nsoft-treading waiter whose Negro nature was only revealed by his\r\nmocking obsequiousness, served each with champagne.\r\n\r\n"To our continued success!" cried the physician, lifting his glass high.\r\n\r\n"To our continued success!" echoed the others.\r\n\r\nThey drained their glasses, and returned them to the polished surface\r\nof the table.\r\n\r\n"Dog bite it, Doc!" blurted Johnson. "Us sho is doin\' fine. Ain\'t had a\r\nbad break since we stahted, an\' heah \'tis th\' fust o\' September."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t holler too soon," cautioned Foster. "The opposition is growing\r\nkeener every day. I had to pay seventy-five thousand dollars more for\r\nthis building than it\'s worth."\r\n\r\n"Well, yuh got it, didn\'t yuh?" asked Johnson. "Just like Ah allus\r\nsay: when yuh got money yuh kin git anything in this man\'s country.\r\nWhenever things look tight jes pull out th\' ole check book an\'\r\neve\'ything\'s all right."\r\n\r\n"Optimist!" grunted Foster.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t no pess\'mist," Johnson accused.\r\n\r\n"Now gentlemen," Dr. Crookman interrupted, clearing his throat, "let\'s\r\nget down to business. We have met here, as you know, not only for the\r\npurpose of celebrating the opening of this, our fiftieth sanitarium,\r\nbut also to take stock of our situation. I have before me here a\r\ndetailed report of our business affairs for the entire period of seven\r\nmonths and a half that we\'ve been in operation.\r\n\r\n"During that time we have put into service fifty sanitariums from\r\nCoast to Coast, or an average of one every four and one-half days,\r\nthe average capacity of each sanitarium being one hundred and five\r\npatients. Each place has a staff of six physicians and twenty-four\r\nnurses, a janitor, four orderlies, two electricians, bookkeeper,\r\ncashier, stenographer and record clerk, not counting four guards.\r\n\r\n"For the past four months we have had an equipment factory in\r\nPittsburgh in full operation and a chemical plant in Philadelphia.\r\nIn addition to this we have purchased four airplanes and a radio\r\nbroadcasting station. Our expenditures for real estate, salaries\r\nand chemicals have totaled six million, two hundred and fifty-five\r\nthousand, eighty-five dollars and ten cents."\r\n\r\n"He! He!" chuckled Johnson. "Dat ten cents mus\' be fo\' one o\' them bad\r\nceegars that Fostah smokes."\r\n\r\n"Our total income," continued Dr. Crookman, frowning slightly at the\r\ninterruption, "has been eighteen million, five hundred thousand, three\r\nhundred dollars, or three hundred and seventy thousand and six patients\r\nat fifty dollars apiece. I think that vindicates my contention at the\r\nbeginning that the fee should be but fifty dollars--within the reach of\r\nthe rank and file of Negroes." He laid aside his report and added:\r\n\r\n"In the next four months we\'ll double our output and by the end of the\r\nyear we should cut the fee to twenty-five dollars," he lightly twirled\r\nhis waxed mustache between his long sensitive fingers and smiled with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Foster, "the sooner we get this business over with the\r\nbetter. We\'re going to run into a whole lot more opposition from now on\r\nthan we have so far encountered."\r\n\r\n"Why man!" growled Johnson, "we ain\'t even stahted on dese darkies yet.\r\nAnd when we git thu wi\' dese heah, we kin work on them in th\' West\r\nIndies. Believe me, Ah doan _nevah_ want dis graft tuh end."\r\n\r\n"Now," continued Dr. Crookman, "I want to say that Mr. Foster deserves\r\ngreat praise for the industry and ingenuity he has shown in purchasing\r\nour real estate and Mr. Johnson deserves equally great praise for\r\nthe efficient manner in which he has kept down the opposition of the\r\nvarious city officials. As you know, he has spent nearly a million\r\ndollars in such endeavors and almost as much again in molding\r\nlegislative sentiment in Washington and the various state capitals.\r\nThat accounts for the fact that every bill introduced in a legislature\r\nor municipal council to put us out of business has died in committee.\r\nMoreover, through his corps of secret operatives, who are mostly young\r\nwomen, he has placed numbers of officials and legislators in a position\r\nwhere they cannot openly oppose our efforts."\r\n\r\nA smile of appreciation went around the circle.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have a whole lot to do from now on," commented Foster.\r\n\r\n"Yeh, Big Boy," replied the ex-gambler, "an\' whut it takes tuh do it Ah\r\nain\'t got nuthin\' else but!"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the physician, "our friend Hank has not been\r\noverburdened with scruples."\r\n\r\n"Ah doan know whut dat is, Chief," grinned Johnson, "but Ah knows whut\r\na check book\'ll do. Even these crackers tone down when Ah talks bucks."\r\n\r\n"This afternoon," continued Crookman, "we also have with us our three\r\nregional directors, Doctors Henry Dogan, Charles Hinckle and Fred\r\nSelden, as well as our chief chemist, Wallace Butts. I thought it\r\nwould be a good idea to bring you all together for this occasion so we\r\ncould get better acquainted. We\'ll just have a word from each of them.\r\nThey\'re all good Race men, you know, even if they have, like the rest\r\nof our staff, taken the treatment."\r\n\r\nFor the next three-quarters of an hour the three directors and the\r\nchief chemist reported on the progress of their work. At intervals the\r\nwaiter brought in cold drinks, cigars and cigarettes. Overhead whirred\r\nthe electric fans. Out of the wide open windows could be seen the\r\npanorama of bungalows, pavements, palm trees, trundling street cars and\r\nscooting automobiles.\r\n\r\n"Lawd! Lawd! Lawd!" Johnson exclaimed at the conclusion of the meeting,\r\ngoing to the window and gazing out over the city. "Jes gimme a coupla\r\nyeahs o\' dis graft an\' Ah\'ll make Henry Foahd look like a tramp."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Negro society was in turmoil and chaos. The colored folk\r\nin straining every nerve to get the Black-No-More treatment, had\r\nforgotten all loyalties, affiliations and responsibilities. No longer\r\ndid they flock to the churches on Sundays or pay dues in their numerous\r\nfraternal organizations. They had stopped giving anything to the\r\nAnti-Lynching campaign. Santop Licorice, head of the once-flourishing\r\nBack-To-Africa Society, was daily raising his stentorian voice in\r\ndenunciation of the race for deserting his organization.\r\n\r\nNegro business was being no less hard hit. Few people were bothering\r\nabout getting their hair straightened or skin whitened temporarily when\r\nfor a couple of weeks\' pay they could get both jobs done permanently.\r\nThe immediate result of this change of mind on the part of the Negro\r\npublic was to almost bankrupt the firms that made the whitening and\r\nstraightening chemicals. They were largely controlled by canny Hebrews,\r\nbut at least a half-dozen were owned by Negroes. The rapid decline\r\nin this business greatly decreased the revenue of the Negro weekly\r\nnewspapers who depended upon such advertising for their sustenance. The\r\nactual business of hair straightening that had furnished employment to\r\nthousands of colored women who would otherwise have had to go back to\r\nwashing and ironing, declined to such an extent that "To Rent" signs\r\nhung in front of nine-tenths of the shops.\r\n\r\nThe Negro politicians in the various Black Belts, grown fat and sleek\r\n"protecting" vice with the aid of Negro votes which they were able to\r\ncontrol by virtue of housing segregation, lectured in vain about black\r\nsolidarity, race pride and political emancipation; but nothing stopped\r\nthe exodus to the white race. Gloomily the politicians sat in their\r\noffices, wondering whether to throw up the sponge and hunt the nearest\r\nBlack-No-More sanitarium or hold on a little longer in the hope that\r\nthe whites might put a stop to the activities of Dr. Crookman and his\r\nassociates. The latter, indeed, was their only hope because the bulk\r\nof Negroes, saving their dimes and dollars for chromatic emancipation,\r\nhad stopped gambling, patronizing houses of prostitution or staging\r\nSaturday-night brawls. Thus the usual sources of graft vanished. The\r\nblack politicians appealed to their white masters for succor, of\r\ncourse, but they found to their dismay that most of the latter had been\r\nsafely bribed by the astute Hank Johnson.\r\n\r\nGone was the almost European atmosphere of every Negro ghetto: the\r\nmusic, laughter, gaiety, jesting and abandon. Instead, one noted the\r\nsame excited bustle, wild looks and strained faces to be seen in a war\r\ntime soldier camp, around a new oil district or before a gold rush.\r\nThe happy-go-lucky Negro of song and story was gone forever and in his\r\nstead was a nervous, money-grubbing black, stuffing away coin in socks,\r\nimpatiently awaiting a sufficient sum to pay Dr. Crookman\'s fee.\r\n\r\nUp from the South they came in increasing droves, besieging the\r\nBlack-No-More sanitariums for treatment. There were none of these\r\nhavens in the South because of the hostility of the bulk of white\r\npeople but there were many all along the border between the two\r\nsections, at such places as Washington, D. C., Baltimore, Cincinnati,\r\nLouisville, Evansville, Cairo, St. Louis and Denver. The various\r\nSouthern communities attempted to stem this, the greatest migration\r\nof Negroes in the history of the country, but without avail. By\r\ntrain, boat, wagon, bicycle, automobile and foot they trekked to the\r\npromised land; a hopeful procession, filtering through the outposts of\r\npolice and Knights of Nordica volunteer bands. Where there was great\r\nopposition to the Negroes\' going, there would suddenly appear large\r\nquantities of free bootleg liquor and crisp new currency which would\r\nmake the most vigilant white opponent of Black-No-More turn his head\r\nthe other way. Hank Johnson seemed to be able to cope with almost every\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe national office of the militant Negro organization, the National\r\nSocial Equality League, was agog. Telephone bells were ringing, mulatto\r\nclerks were hustling excitedly back and forth, messenger boys rushed in\r\nand out. Located in the Times Square district of Manhattan, it had for\r\nforty years carried on the fight for full social equality for the Negro\r\ncitizens and the immediate abolition of lynching as a national sport.\r\nWhile this organization had to depend to a large extent upon the\r\ncharity of white folk for its existence, since the blacks had always\r\nbeen more or less skeptical about the program for liberty and freedom,\r\nthe efforts of the society were not entirely unprofitable. Vistas of\r\nimmaculate offices spread in every direction from the elevator and\r\nfootfalls were muffled in thick imitation-Persian rugs. While the large\r\nstaff of officials was eager to end all oppression and persecution of\r\nthe Negro, they were never so happy and excited as when a Negro was\r\nbarred from a theater or fried to a crisp. Then they would leap for\r\ntelephones, grab telegraph pads and yell for stenographers; smiling\r\nthrough their simulated indignation at the spectacle of another reason\r\nfor their continued existence and appeals for funds.\r\n\r\nEver since the first sanitarium of Black-No-More, Incorporated,\r\nstarted turning Negroes into Caucasians, the National Social Equality\r\nLeague\'s income had been decreasing. No dues had been collected in\r\nmonths and subscriptions to the national mouthpiece, _The Dilemma_, had\r\ndwindled to almost nothing. Officials, long since ensconced in palatial\r\napartments, began to grow panic-stricken as pay days got farther apart.\r\nThey began to envision the time when they would no longer be able for\r\nthe sake of the Negro race to suffer the hardships of lunching on\r\ncanvasback duck at the Urban Club surrounded by the white dilettante,\r\nendure the perils of first-class Transatlantic passage to stage\r\nSave-Dear-Africa Conferences or undergo the excruciating torture of\r\nrolling back and forth across the United States in drawing-rooms to\r\nhear each other lecture on the Negro problem. On meager salaries of\r\nfive thousand dollars a year they had fought strenuously and tirelessly\r\nto obtain for the Negroes the constitutional rights which only a few\r\nthousand rich white folk possessed. And now they saw the work of a\r\nlifetime being rapidly destroyed.\r\n\r\nSingle-handed they felt incapable of organizing an effective opposition\r\nto Black-No-More, Incorporated, so they had called a conference of\r\nall of the outstanding Negro leaders of the country to assemble at\r\nthe League\'s headquarters on December 1, 1933. Getting the Negro\r\nleaders together for any purpose except boasting of each other\'s\r\naccomplishments had previously been impossible. As a usual thing they\r\nfought each other with a vigor only surpassed by that of their pleas\r\nfor racial solidarity and unity of action. This situation, however, was\r\nunprecedented, so almost all of the representative gentlemen of color\r\nto whom invitations had been sent agreed with alacrity to come. To a\r\nman they felt that it was time to bury the hatchet before they became\r\ntoo hungry to do any digging.\r\n\r\nIn a very private inner office of the N. S. E. L. suite, Dr.\r\nShakespeare Agamemnon Beard, founder of the League and a graduate of\r\nHarvard, Yale and Copenhagen (whose haughty bearing never failed to\r\nimpress both Caucasians and Negroes) sat before a glass-topped desk,\r\nrubbing now his curly gray head, and now his full spade beard. For a\r\nmere six thousand dollars a year, the learned doctor wrote scholarly\r\nand biting editorials in _The Dilemma_ denouncing the Caucasians\r\nwhom he secretly admired and lauding the greatness of the Negroes\r\nwhom he alternately pitied and despised. In limpid prose he told of\r\nthe sufferings and privations of the downtrodden black workers with\r\nwhose lives he was totally and thankfully unfamiliar. Like most Negro\r\nleaders, he deified the black woman but abstained from employing aught\r\nsave octoroons. He talked at white banquets about "we of the black\r\nrace" and admitted in books that he was part-French, part-Russian,\r\npart-Indian and part-Negro. He bitterly denounced the Nordics for\r\ndebauching Negro women while taking care to hire comely yellow\r\nstenographers with weak resistance. In a real way, he loved his people.\r\nIn time of peace he was a Pink Socialist but when the clouds of war\r\ngathered he bivouacked at the feet of Mars.\r\n\r\nBefore the champion of the darker races lay a neatly typed resolution\r\ndrawn up by him and his staff the day before and addressed to the\r\nAttorney General of the United States. The staff had taken this\r\nprecaution because no member of it believed that the other Negro\r\nleaders possessed sufficient education to word the document effectively\r\nand grammatically. Dr. Beard re-read the resolution and then placing it\r\nin the drawer of the desk, pressed one of a row of buttons. "Tell them\r\nto come in," he directed. The mulattress turned and switched out of the\r\nroom, followed by the appraising and approving eye of the aged scholar.\r\nHe heaved a regretful sigh as the door closed and his thoughts dwelt on\r\nthe vigor of his youth.\r\n\r\nIn three or four minutes the door opened again and several well-dressed\r\nblacks, mulattoes and white men entered the large office and took\r\nseats around the wall. They greeted each other and the President of\r\nthe League with usual cordiality but for the first time in their lives\r\nthey were sincere about it. If anyone could save the day it was Beard.\r\nThey all admitted that, as did the Doctor himself. They pulled out fat\r\ncigars, long slender cigarettes and London briar pipes, lit them and\r\nawaited the opening of the conference.\r\n\r\nThe venerable lover of his race tapped with his knuckle for order, laid\r\naside his six-inch cigarette and rising, said:\r\n\r\n"It were quite unseemly for me who lives such a cloistered life and\r\nam spared the bane or benefit of many intimate contacts with those\r\nof our struggling race who by sheer courage, tenacity and merit have\r\nlifted their heads above the mired mass, to deign to take from a more\r\ncapable individual the unpleasant task of reviewing the combination of\r\nunfortunate circumstances that has brought us together, man to man,\r\nwithin the four walls of the office." He shot a foxy glance around the\r\nassembly and then went on suavely. "And so, my friends, I beg your\r\naugust permission to confer upon my able and cultured secretary and\r\nconfidant, Dr. Napoleon Wellington Jackson, the office of chairman of\r\nthis temporary body. I need not introduce Dr. Jackson to you. You know\r\nof his scholarship, his high sense of duty and his deep love of the\r\nsuffering black race. You have doubtless had the pleasure of singing\r\nsome of the many sorrow songs he has written and popularized in the\r\npast twenty years, and you must know of his fame as a translator of\r\nLatin poets and his authoritative work on the Greek language.\r\n\r\n"Before I gratefully yield the floor to Dr. Jackson, however, I want\r\nto tell you that our destiny lies in the stars. Ethiopia\'s fate is in\r\nthe balance. The Goddess of the Nile weeps bitter tears at the feet of\r\nthe Great Sphinx. The lowering clouds gather over the Congo and the\r\nlightning flashes o\'er Togoland. To your tents, O Israel! The hour is\r\nat hand."\r\n\r\nThe president of the N. S. E. L. sat down and the erudite Dr. Jackson,\r\nhis tall, lanky secretary got up. There was no fear of Dr. Jackson ever\r\nwinning a beauty contest. He was a sooty black, very broad shouldered,\r\nwith long, ape-like arms, a diminutive egg-shaped head that sat on his\r\ncollar like a hen\'s egg on a demitasse cup and eyes that protruded so\r\nfar from his head that they seemed about to fall out. He wore pince-nez\r\nthat were continually slipping from his very flat and oily nose. His\r\nchief business in the organization was to write long and indignant\r\nletters to public officials and legislators whenever a Negro was\r\nmistreated, demanding justice, fair play and other legal guarantees\r\nvouchsafed no whites except bloated plutocrats fallen miraculously\r\nafoul of the law, and to speak to audiences of sex-starved matrons\r\nwho yearned to help the Negro stand erect. During his leisure time,\r\nwhich was naturally considerable, he wrote long and learned articles,\r\nbristling with references, for the more intellectual magazines, in\r\nwhich he sought to prove conclusively that the plantation shouts of\r\nSouthern Negro peons were superior to any of Beethoven\'s symphonies and\r\nthat the city of Benin was the original site of the Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\n"Hhmm! Hu-umn! Now er--ah, gentlemen," began Dr. Jackson, rocking back\r\non his heels, taking off his eye glasses and beginning to polish them\r\nwith a silk kerchief, "as you know, the Negro race is face to face\r\nwith a grave crisis. I--ah--presume it is er--ah unnecessary for me to\r\ngo into any details concerning the-ah activities of Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated. Suffice er--ah umph! ummmmh! to say-ah that it has thrown\r\nour society into rather a-ah bally turmoil. Our people are forgetting\r\nshamelessly their-ah duty to the-ah organizations that have fought\r\nvaliantly for them these-ah many years and are now busily engaged\r\nchasing a bally-ah will-o-the wisp. Ahem!\r\n\r\n"You-ah probably all fully realize that-ah a continuation of\r\nthe aforementioned activities will prove disastrous to our-ah\r\norganizations. You-ah, like us, must feel-uh that something drastic\r\nmust be done to preserve the integrity of Negro society. Think,\r\ngentlemen, what the future will mean to-uh all those who-uh have\r\ntoiled so hard for Negro society. What-ah, may I ask, will we do\r\nwhen there are no longer any-ah groups to support us? Of course, Dr.\r\nCrookman and-ah his associates have a-uh perfect right to-ah engage\r\nin any legitimate business, but-ah their present activities cannot-ah\r\nbe classed under that head, considering the effect on our endeavors.\r\nBefore we go any further, however, I-ah would like to introduce our\r\nresearch expert Mr. Walter Williams, who will-ah describe the situation\r\nin the South."\r\n\r\nMr. Walter Williams, a tall, heavy-set white man with pale blue eyes,\r\nwavy auburn hair and a militant, lantern jaw, rose and bowed to the\r\nassemblage and proceeded to paint a heartrending picture of the loss of\r\npride and race solidarity among Negroes North and South. There was,\r\nhe said, not a single local of the N. S. E. L. functioning, dues had\r\ndwindled to nothing, he had not been able to hold a meeting anywhere,\r\nwhile many of the stanchest supporters had gone over into the white\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n"Personally," he concluded, "I am very proud to be a Negro and always\r\nhave been (his great-grandfather, it seemed, had been a mulatto), and\r\nI\'m willing to sacrifice for the uplift of my race. I cannot understand\r\nwhat has come over our people that they have so quickly forgotten the\r\nancient glories of Ethiopia, Songhay and Dahomey, and their marvelous\r\nrecord of achievement since emancipation." Mr. Williams was known to be\r\na Negro among his friends and acquaintances, but no one else would have\r\nsuspected it.\r\n\r\nAnother white man of remote Negro ancestry, Rev. Herbert Gronne of\r\nDunbar University, followed the research expert with a long discourse\r\nin which he expressed fear for the future of his institution whose\r\nstudent body had been reduced to sixty-five persons and deplored the\r\ncatastrophe "that has befallen us black people."\r\n\r\nThey all listened with respect to Dr. Gronne. He had been in turn a\r\ncollege professor, a social worker and a minister, had received the\r\napproval of the white folks and was thus doubly acceptable to the\r\nNegroes. Much of his popularity was due to the fact that he very\r\ncleverly knew how to make statements that sounded radical to Negroes\r\nbut sufficiently conservative to satisfy the white trustees of his\r\nschool. In addition he possessed the asset of looking perpetually\r\nearnest and sincere.\r\n\r\nFollowing him came Colonel Mortimer Roberts, principal of the Dusky\r\nRiver Agricultural Institute, Supreme General of the Knights and\r\nDaughters of Kingdom Come and president of the Uncle Tom Memorial\r\nAssociation. Colonel Roberts was the acknowledged leader of the\r\nconservative Negroes (most of whom had nothing to conserve) who felt at\r\nall times that the white folks were in the lead and that Negroes should\r\nbe careful to guide themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\nHe was a great mountain of blackness with a head shaped like an\r\nupturned bucket, pierced by two pig-like eyes and a cavernous mouth\r\nequipped with large tombstone teeth which he almost continually\r\ndisplayed. His speech was a cross between the woofing of a bloodhound\r\nand the explosion of an inner tube. It conveyed to most white people\r\nan impression of rugged simplicity and sincerity, which was very\r\nfortunate since Colonel Roberts maintained his school through their\r\ncontributions. He spoke as usual about the cordial relations existing\r\nbetween the two races in his native Georgia, the effrontery of Negroes\r\nwho dared whiten themselves and thus disturb the minds of white people\r\nand insinuated alliance with certain militant organizations in the\r\nSouth to stop this whitening business before it went too far. Having\r\nspoken his mind and received scant applause, the Colonel (some white\r\nman had once called him Colonel and the title stuck) puffing and\r\nblowing, sat down.\r\n\r\nMr. Claude Spelling, a scared-looking little brown man with big ears,\r\nwho held the exalted office of president of the Society of Negro\r\nMerchants, added his volume of blues to the discussion. The refrain\r\nwas that Negro business--always anemic--was about to pass out entirely\r\nthrough lack of patronage. Mr. Spelling had for many years been the\r\nleading advocate of the strange doctrine that an underpaid Negro worker\r\nshould go out of his way to patronize a little dingy Negro store\r\ninstead of going to a cheaper and cleaner chain store, all for the\r\ndubious satisfaction of helping Negro merchants grow wealthy.\r\n\r\nThe next speaker, Dr. Joseph Bonds, a little rat-faced Negro with\r\nprotruding teeth stained by countless plugs of chewing tobacco and\r\nwearing horn-rimmed spectacles, who headed the Negro Data League,\r\nalmost cried (which would have been terrible to observe) when he told\r\nof the difficulty his workers had encountered in their efforts to\r\npersuade retired white capitalists, whose guilty consciences persuaded\r\nthem to indulge in philanthropy, to give their customary donations to\r\nthe work. The philanthropists seemed to think, said Dr. Bonds, that\r\nsince the Negroes were busily solving their difficulties, there was no\r\nneed for social work among them or any collection of data. He almost\r\nsobbed aloud when he described how his collections had fallen from\r\n$50,000 a month to less than $1000.\r\n\r\nHis feeling in the matter could easily be appreciated. He was engaged\r\nin a most vital and necessary work: i.e., collecting bales of data to\r\nprove satisfactorily to all that more money was needed to collect more\r\ndata. Most of the data were highly informative, revealing the amazing\r\nfact that poor people went to jail oftener than rich ones; that most of\r\nthe people were not getting enough money for their work; that strangely\r\nenough there was some connection between poverty, disease and crime. By\r\nestablishing these facts with mathematical certitude and illustrating\r\nthem with elaborate graphs, Dr. Bonds garnered many fat checks. For\r\nhis people, he said, he wanted work, not charity; but for himself he\r\nwas always glad to get the charity with as little work as possible.\r\nFor many years he had succeeded in doing so without any ascertainable\r\nbenefit accruing to the Negro group.\r\n\r\nDr. Bonds\' show of emotion almost brought the others to tears and many\r\nof them muttered "Yes, Brother" while he was talking. The conferees\r\nwere getting stirred up but it took the next speaker to really get them\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nWhen he rose an expectant hush fell over the assemblage. They all\r\nknew and respected the Right Reverend Bishop Ezekiel Whooper of the\r\nEthiopian True Faith Wash Foot Methodist Church for three reasons:\r\nviz., his church was rich (though the parishioners were poor), he had\r\na very loud voice and the white people praised him. He was sixty,\r\ncorpulent and an expert at the art of making cuckolds.\r\n\r\n"Our loyal and devoted clergy," he boomed, "are being forced into\r\nmanual labor and the Negro church is rapidly dying." And then he\r\nlaunched into a violent tirade against Black-No-More and favored any\r\nmeans to put the corporation out of business. In his excitement he\r\nblew saliva, waved his long arms, stamped his feet, pummeled the desk,\r\nrolled his eyes, knocked down his chair, almost sat on the rug and\r\ngenerally reverted to the antics of Negro bush preachers.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition proved contagious. Rev. Herbert Gronne, face flushed\r\nand shouting amens, marched from one end of the room to the other;\r\nColonel Roberts, looking like an inebriated black-faced comedian,\r\nrocked back and forth clapping his hands; the others began to groan and\r\nmoan. Dr. Napoleon Wellington Jackson, sensing his opportunity, began\r\nto sing a spiritual in his rich soprano voice. The others immediately\r\njoined him. The very air seemed charged with emotion.\r\n\r\nBishop Whooper was about to start up again, when Dr. Beard, who had\r\nsat cold and disdainful through this outbreak of revivalism, toying\r\nwith his gold-rimmed fountain pen and gazing at the exhibition through\r\nhalf-closed eyelids, interrupted in sharp metallic tones.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s get down to earth now," he commanded. "We\'ve had enough of this\r\nnonsense. We have a resolution here addressed to the Attorney General\r\nof the United States demanding that Dr. Crookman and his associates\r\nbe arrested and their activities stopped at once for the good of both\r\nraces. All those in favor of this resolution say aye. Contrary?... Very\r\nwell, the ayes have it.... Miss Hilton please send off this telegram at\r\nonce!"\r\n\r\nThey looked at Dr. Beard and each other in amazement. Several started\r\nto meekly protest.\r\n\r\n"You gentlemen are all twenty-one, aren\'t you?" sneered Beard. "Well,\r\nthen be men enough to stand by your decision."\r\n\r\n"But Doctor Beard," objected Rev. Gronne, "isn\'t this a rather unusual\r\nprocedure?"\r\n\r\n"Rev. Gronne," the great man replied, "it\'s not near as unusual as\r\nBlack-No-More. I have probably ruffled your dignity but that\'s nothing\r\nto what Dr. Crookman will do."\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'re right, Beard," the college president agreed.\r\n\r\n"I know it," snapped the other.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Walter Brybe, who had won his exalted position as\r\nAttorney General of the United States because of his long and faithful\r\nservice helping large corporations to circumvent the federal laws, sat\r\nat his desk in Washington, D. C. Before him lay the wired resolution\r\nfrom the conference of Negro leaders. He pursed his lips and reached\r\nfor his private telephone.\r\n\r\n"Gorman?" he inquired softly into the receiver. "Is that you?"\r\n\r\n"Nossuh," came the reply, "this heah is Mistah Gay\'s valet."\r\n\r\n"Well, call Mister Gay to the telephone at once."\r\n\r\n"Yassuh."\r\n\r\n"That you, Gorman," asked the chief legal officer of the nation\r\naddressing the National Chairman of his party.\r\n\r\n"Yeh, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"You heard \'bout this resolution from them niggers in New York, aint\r\nyou? It\'s been in all of the papers."\r\n\r\n"Yes I read it."\r\n\r\n"Well, whaddya think we oughtta do about it?"\r\n\r\n"Take it easy, Walter. Give \'em the old run around. You know. They\r\nain\'t got a thin dime; it\'s this other crowd that\'s holding the heavy\r\njack. And \'course you know we gotta clean up our deficit. Just lemme\r\nwork with that Black-No-More crowd. I can talk business with that\r\nJohnson fellow."\r\n\r\n"All right, Gorman, I think you\'re right, but you don\'t want to forget\r\nthat there\'s a whole lot of white sentiment against them coons."\r\n\r\n"Needn\'t worry \'bout that," scoffed Gorman. "There\'s no money behind\r\nit much and besides it\'s in states we can\'t carry anyhow. Go ahead;\r\nstall them New York niggers off. You\'re a lawyer, you can always find a\r\nreason."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the compliment, Gorman," said the Attorney General, hanging\r\nup the receiver.\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button on his desk and a young girl, armed with pencil and\r\npad, came in.\r\n\r\n"Take this letter," he ordered: "To Doctor Shakespeare Agamemnon\r\nBeard (what a hell of a name!), Chairman of the Committee for the\r\nPreservation of Negro Racial Integrity, 1400 Broadway, New York City.\r\n\r\n    "My dear Dr. Beard:\r\n\r\n    The Attorney General has received the resolution signed by yourself\r\n    and others and given it careful consideration.\r\n\r\n    Regardless of personal views in the matter (I don\'t give a damn\r\n    whether they turn white or not, myself) it is not possible for\r\n    the Department of Justice to interfere with a legitimate business\r\n    enterprise so long as its methods are within the law. The\r\n    corporation in question has violated no federal statute and hence\r\n    there is not the slightest ground for interfering with its\r\n    activities.\r\n\r\n                                                      Very truly yours,\r\n                                                          WALTER BRYBE.\r\n\r\n"Get that off at once. Give out copies to the press. That\'s all."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSantop Licorice, founder and leader of the Back-to-Africa Society,\r\nread the reply of the Attorney General to the Negro leaders with much\r\nmalicious satisfaction. He laid aside his morning paper, pulled a fat\r\ncigar from a box near by, lit it and blew clouds of smoke above his\r\nwoolly head. He was always delighted when Dr. Beard met with any sort\r\nof rebuff or embarrassment. He was doubly pleased in this instance\r\nbecause he had been overlooked in the sending out of invitations to\r\nNegro leaders to join the Committee for the Preservation of Negro\r\nRacial Integrity. It was outrageous, after all the talking he had done\r\nin favor of Negro racial integrity.\r\n\r\nMr. Licorice for some fifteen years had been very profitably advocating\r\nthe emigration of all the American Negroes to Africa. He had not, of\r\ncourse, gone there himself and had not the slightest intention of\r\ngoing so far from the fleshpots, but he told the other Negroes to\r\ngo. Naturally the first step in their going was to join his society\r\nby paying five dollars a year for membership, ten dollars for a gold,\r\ngreen and purple robe and silver-colored helmet that together cost two\r\ndollars and a half, contributing five dollars to the Santop Licorice\r\nDefense Fund (there was a perpetual defense fund because Licorice was\r\nperpetually in the courts for fraud of some kind), and buying shares at\r\nfive dollars each in the Royal Black Steamship Company, for obviously\r\none could not get to Africa without a ship and Negroes ought to travel\r\non Negro-owned and operated ships. The ships were Santop\'s especial\r\npride. True, they had never been to Africa, had never had but one cargo\r\nand that, being gin, was half consumed by the unpaid and thirsty crew\r\nbefore the vessel was saved by the Coast Guard, but they had cost more\r\nthan anything else the Back-To-Africa Society had purchased even though\r\nthey were worthless except as scrap iron. Mr. Licorice, who was known\r\nby his followers as Provisional President of Africa, Admiral of the\r\nAfrican Navy, Field Marshal of the African Army and Knight Commander of\r\nthe Nile, had a genius for being stuck with junk by crafty salesmen.\r\nWhite men only needed to tell him that he was shrewder than white men\r\nand he would immediately reach for a check book.\r\n\r\nBut there was little reaching for check books in his office nowadays.\r\nHe had been as hard hit as the other Negroes. Why should anybody in\r\nthe Negro race want to go back to Africa at a cost of five hundred\r\ndollars for passage when they could stay in America and get white for\r\nfifty dollars? Mr. Licorice saw the point but instead of scuttling back\r\nto Demerara from whence he had come to save his race from oppression,\r\nhe had hung on in the hope that the activities of Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated, would be stopped. In the meantime, he had continued to\r\nattempt to save the Negroes by vigorously attacking all of the other\r\nNegro organizations and at the same time preaching racial solidarity\r\nand co\xc3\xb6peration in his weekly newspaper, "_The African Abroad_," which\r\nwas printed by white folks and had until a year ago been full of\r\nskin-whitening and hair-straightening advertisements.\r\n\r\n"How is our treasury?" he yelled back through the dingy suite of\r\noffices to his bookkeeper, a pretty mulatto.\r\n\r\n"What treasury?" she asked in mock surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought we had seventy-five dollars," he blurted.\r\n\r\n"We did, but the Sheriff got most of it yesterday or we wouldn\'t be in\r\nhere today."\r\n\r\n"Huumn! Well, that\'s bad. And tomorrow\'s pay day, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Why bring that up?" she sneered. "I\'d forgotten all about it."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t we got enough for me to get to Atlanta?" Licorice inquired,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"There is if you\'re gonna hitch-hike."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, I couldn\'t do that," he smiled deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"I should say not," she retorted surveying his 250-pound,\r\nfive-feet-six-inches of black blubber.\r\n\r\n"Call Western Union," he commanded.\r\n\r\n"What with?"\r\n\r\n"Over the telephone, of course, Miss Hall," he explained.\r\n\r\n"If you can get anything over that telephone you\'re a better man than I\r\nam, Gunga Din."\r\n\r\n"Has the service been discontinued, young lady?"\r\n\r\n"Try and get a number," she chirped. He gazed ruefully at the telephone.\r\n\r\n"Is there anything we can sell?" asked the bewildered Licorice.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, if you can get the Sheriff to take off his attachments."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, I had forgotten."\r\n\r\n"You would."\r\n\r\n"Please be more respectful, Miss Hall," he snapped. "Somebody might\r\noverhear you and tell my wife."\r\n\r\n"Which one?" she mocked.\r\n\r\n"Shut up," he blurted, touched in a tender spot, "and try to figure out\r\nsome way for us to get hold of some money."\r\n\r\n"You must think I\'m Einstein," she said, coming up and perching herself\r\non the edge of his desk.\r\n\r\n"Well, if we don\'t get some operating expenses I won\'t be able to\r\nobtain money to pay your salary," he warned.\r\n\r\n"The old songs are the best songs," she wisecracked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come now, Violet," he remonstrated, pawing her buttock, "let\'s be\r\nserious."\r\n\r\n"After all these years!" she declared, switching away.\r\n\r\nIn desperation, he eased his bulk out of the creaking swivel chair,\r\nreached for his hat and overcoat and shuffled out of the office. He\r\nwalked to the curb to hail a taxicab but reconsidered when he recalled\r\nthat a worn half-dollar was the extent of his funds. Sighing heavily,\r\nhe trudged the two blocks to the telegraph office and sent a long\r\nday letter to Henry Givens, Imperial Grand Wizard of the Knights of\r\nNordica--collect.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you figured it out?" asked Violet when he barged into his\r\noffice again.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I just sent a wire to Givens," he replied.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s a nigger-hater, isn\'t he?" was her surprised comment.\r\n\r\n"You want your salary, don\'t you?" he inquired archly.\r\n\r\n"I have for the past month."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, don\'t ask foolish questions," he snapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo important events took place on Easter Sunday, 1934. The first was\r\na huge mass meeting in the brand new reinforced concrete auditorium\r\nof the Knights of Nordica for the double purpose of celebrating the\r\nfirst anniversary of the militant secret society and the winning of the\r\nmillionth member. The second event was the wedding of Helen Givens and\r\nMatthew Fisher, Grand Exalted Giraw of the Knights of Nordica.\r\n\r\nRev. Givens, the Imperial Grand Wizard of the order, had never\r\nregretted that he had taken Fisher into the order and made him his\r\nright-hand man. The membership had grown by leaps and bounds, the\r\ntreasury was bursting with money in spite of the Wizard\'s constant\r\nmisappropriation of funds, the regalia factory was running night and\r\nday and the influence of the order was becoming so great that Rev.\r\nGivens was beginning to dream of a berth in the White House or near by.\r\n\r\nFor over six months the order had been publishing _The Warning_, an\r\neight-page newspaper carrying lurid red headlines and poorly-drawn\r\nquarter-page cartoons, and edited by Matthew. The noble Southern\r\nworking people purchased it eagerly, devouring and believing every\r\nword in it. Matthew, in 14-point, one-syllable word editorials painted\r\nterrifying pictures of the menace confronting white supremacy and\r\nthe utter necessity of crushing it. Very cleverly he linked up the\r\nPope, the Yellow Peril, the Alien Invasion and Foreign Entanglements\r\nwith Black-No-More as devices of the Devil. He wrote with such blunt\r\nsincerity that sometimes he almost persuaded himself that it was all\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nAs the money flowed in, Matthew\'s fame as a great organizer spread\r\nthroughout the Southland, and he suddenly became the most desirable\r\ncatch in the section. Beautiful women literally threw themselves at his\r\nfeet, and, as a former Negro and thus well versed in the technique of\r\namour, he availed himself of all offerings that caught his fancy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he was a frequent visitor to the Givens home,\r\nespecially when Mrs. Givens, whom he heartily detested, was away. From\r\nthe very first Helen had been impressed by Matthew. She had always\r\nlonged for the companionship of an educated man, a scientist, a man of\r\nliterary ability. Matthew to her mind embodied all of these. She only\r\nhesitated to accept his first offer of marriage two days after they\r\nmet because she saw no indication that he had much, if any, money. She\r\nsoftened toward him as the Knights of Nordica treasury grew; and when\r\nhe was able to boast of a million-dollar bank account, she agreed to\r\nmarriage and accepted his ardent embraces in the meantime.\r\n\r\nAnd so, before the yelling multitude of night-gowned Knights, they\r\nwere united in holy wedlock on the stage of the new auditorium. Both,\r\nbeing newlyweds, were happy. Helen had secured the kind of husband\r\nshe wanted, except that she regretted his association with what she\r\ncalled low-brows; while Matthew had won the girl of his dreams and was\r\nthoroughly satisfied, except for a slight regret that her grotesque\r\nmother wasn\'t dead and some disappointment that his spouse was so much\r\nmore ignorant than she was beautiful.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Matthew had helped to get the Knights of Nordica well under\r\nway with enough money flowing in to satisfy the avaricious Rev. Givens,\r\nhe had begun to study ways and means of making some money on the side.\r\nHe had power, influence and prestige and he intended to make good use\r\nof them. So he had obtained audiences individually with several of the\r\nleading business men of the Georgia capital.\r\n\r\nHe always prefaced his proposition by pointing out that the working\r\npeople were never so contented, profits never so high and the erection\r\nof new factories in the city never so intensive; that the continued\r\nprosperity of Atlanta and of the entire South depended upon keeping\r\nlabor free from Bolshevism, Socialism, Communism, Anarchism, trade\r\nunionism and other subversive movements. Such un-American philosophies,\r\nhe insisted had ruined European countries and from their outposts\r\nin New York and other Northern cities were sending emissaries to\r\nseek a foothold in the South and plant the germ of discontent. When\r\nthis happened, he warned gloomily, then farewell to high profits and\r\ncontented labor. He showed copies of books and pamphlets which he had\r\nordered from radical book stores in New York but which he asserted were\r\nbeing distributed to the prospect\'s employees.\r\n\r\nHe then explained the difference between the defunct Ku Klux Klan\r\nand the Knights of Nordica. While both were interested in public\r\nmorals, racial integrity and the threatened invasion of America by\r\nthe Pope, his organization glimpsed its larger duty, the perpetuation\r\nof Southern prosperity by the stabilization of industrial relations.\r\nThe Knights of Nordica, favored by increasing membership, was in a\r\nposition to keep down all radicalism, he said, and then boldly asserted\r\nthat Black-No-More was subsidized by the Russian Bolsheviks. Would\r\nthe gentlemen help the work of the Nordicists along with a small\r\ncontribution? They would and did. Whenever there was a slump in the\r\nflow of cash from this source, Matthew merely had his print shop\r\nrun off a bale of Communistic tracts which his secret operatives\r\ndistributed around in the mills and factories. Contributions would\r\nimmediately increase.\r\n\r\nMatthew had started this lucrative side enterprise none too soon.\r\nThere was much unemployment in the city, wages were being cut and\r\nwork speeded up. There was dissatisfaction and grumbling among the\r\nworkers and a small percentage of them was in a mood to give ear to the\r\nhalf-dozen timid organizers of the conservative unions who were being\r\npaid to unionize the city but had as yet made no headway. A union might\r\nnot be so bad after all.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of white workers, however, was afraid to organize and\r\nfight for more pay because of a deepset fear that the Negroes would\r\ntake their jobs. They had heard of black labor taking the work of white\r\nlabor under the guns of white militia, and they were afraid to risk it.\r\nThey had first read of the activities of Black-No-More, Incorporated,\r\nwith a secret feeling akin to relief but after the orators of the\r\nKnights of Nordica and the editorials of _The Warning_ began to portray\r\nthe menace confronting them, they forgot about their economic ills and\r\nbegan to yell for the blood of Dr. Crookman and his associates. Why,\r\nthey began to argue, one couldn\'t tell who was who! Herein lay the\r\nfundamental cause of all their ills. Times were hard, they reasoned,\r\nbecause there were so many white Negroes in their midst taking their\r\njobs and undermining their American standard of living. None of them\r\nhad ever attained an American standard of living to be sure, but that\r\nfact never occurred to any of them. So they flocked to the meetings of\r\nthe Knights of Nordica and night after night sat spellbound while Rev.\r\nGivens, who had finished the eighth grade in a one-room country school,\r\nexplained the laws of heredity and spoke eloquently of the growing\r\ndanger of black babies.\r\n\r\nDespite his increasing wealth (the money came in so fast he could\r\nscarcely keep track of it), Matthew maintained close contact with the\r\nmerchants and manufacturers. He sent out private letters periodically\r\nto prominent men in the Southern business world in which he told of\r\nthe marked psychological change that had come over the working classes\r\nof the South since the birth of the K. of N. He told how they had been\r\ndiscontented and on the brink of revolution when his organization\r\nrushed in and saved the South. Unionism and such destructive nostrums\r\nhad been forgotten, he averred, when _The Warning_ had revealed the\r\nlatest danger to the white race. Of course, he always added, such work\r\nrequired large sums of money and contributions from conservative,\r\nsubstantial and public-spirited citizens were ever acceptable. At the\r\nend of each letter there appeared a suggestive paragraph pointing out\r\nthe extent to which the prosperity of the New South was due to its\r\n"peculiar institutions" that made the worker race conscious instead\r\nof class conscious, and that with the passing of these "peculiar\r\ninstitutions" would also pass prosperity. This reasoning proved very\r\neffective, financially speaking.\r\n\r\nMatthew\'s great success as an organizer and his increasing popularity\r\nwas not viewed by Rev. Givens with equanimity. The former evangelist\r\nknew that everybody of intelligence in the upper circles of the order\r\nrealized that the growth and prosperity of the Knights of Nordica was\r\nlargely due to the industry, efficiency and intelligence of Matthew.\r\nHe had been told that many people were saying that Fisher ought to be\r\nImperial Grand Wizard instead of Grand Exalted Giraw.\r\n\r\nGivens had the ignorant man\'s fear and suspicion of anybody who was\r\nsupposedly more learned than he. His position, he felt, was threatened,\r\nand he was decidedly uneasy. He neither said nor did anything about\r\nit, but he fretted a great deal to his wife, much to her annoyance. He\r\nwas consequently overjoyed when Matthew asked him for Helen\'s hand,\r\nand gave his consent with alacrity. When the marriage was consummated,\r\nhe saw his cup filled to overflowing and no clouds on the horizon. The\r\nKnights of Nordica was safe in the family.\r\n\r\nOne morning a week or two after his wedding, Matthew was sitting in\r\nhis private office, when his secretary announced a caller, one B.\r\nBrown. After the usual delay staged for the purpose of impressing\r\nall visitors, Matthew ordered him in. A short, plump, well-dressed,\r\nsoft-spoken man entered and greeted him respectfully. The Grand Exalted\r\nGiraw waved to a chair and the stranger sat down. Suddenly, leaning\r\nover close to Matthew, he whispered, "Don\'t recognize me, do you Max?"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Giraw paled and started. "Who are you?" he whispered\r\nhoarsely. How in the devil did this man know him? He peered at him\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer grinned. "Why it\'s me, Bunny Brown, you big sap!"\r\n\r\n"Well, cut my throat!" Matthew exclaimed in amazement. "Boy, is it\r\nreally you?" Bunny\'s black face had miraculously bleached. He seemed\r\nnow more chubby and cherubic than ever.\r\n\r\n"It aint my brother," said Bunny with his familiar beam.\r\n\r\n"Bunny, where\'ve you been all this time? Why didn\'t you come on down\r\nhere when I wrote you? You must\'ve been in jail."\r\n\r\n"Mind reader! That\'s just where I\'ve been," declared the former bank\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n"What for? Gambling?"\r\n\r\n"No: Rambling."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean: Rambling?" asked the puzzled Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Just what I said, Big Boy. Got to rambling around with a married\r\nwoman. Old story: husband came in unexpectedly and I had to crown him.\r\nThe fire escape was slippery and I slipped. Couldn\'t run after I hit\r\nthe ground and the flatfoot nabbed me. Got a lucky break in court or I\r\nwouldn\'t be here."\r\n\r\n"Was it a white woman?" asked the Grand Exalted Giraw.\r\n\r\n"She wasn\'t black," said Bunny.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good thing you weren\'t black, too!"\r\n\r\n"Our minds always ran in the same channels," Bunny commented.\r\n\r\n"Got any jack?" asked Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Is it likely?"\r\n\r\n"Do you want a job?"\r\n\r\n"No, I prefer a position."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think I can fix you up here for about five grand to begin\r\nwith," said Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Santa Claus! What do I have to do: assassinate the President?"\r\n\r\n"No, kidder; just be my right-hand man. You know, follow me through\r\nthick and thin."\r\n\r\n"All right, Max; but when things get too thick, I\'m gonna thin out."\r\n\r\n"For Christ\'s sake don\'t call me Max," cautioned Matthew.\r\n\r\n"That\'s your name, aint it?"\r\n\r\n"No, simp. Them days has gone forever. It\'s Matthew Fisher now. You go\r\npulling that Max stuff and I\'ll have to answer more questions than a\r\ntraffic officer."\r\n\r\n"Just think," mused Bunny. "I been reading about you right along in the\r\npapers but until I recognized your picture in last Sunday\'s paper I\r\ndidn\'t know who you were. Just how long have you been in on this graft?"\r\n\r\n"Ever since it started."\r\n\r\n"Say not so! You must have a wad of cash salted away by this time."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not appealing for charity," Matthew smiled sardonically.\r\n\r\n"How many squaws you got now?"\r\n\r\n"Only one, Bunny--regular."\r\n\r\n"What\'s matter, did you get too old?" chided his friend.\r\n\r\n"No, I got married."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s the same thing. Who\'s the unfortunate woman?"\r\n\r\n"Old man Givens\' girl."\r\n\r\n"Judas Priest! You got in on the ground floor didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t miss. Bunny, old scout, she\'s the same girl that turned me\r\ndown that night in the Honky Tonk," Matthew told him with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Well, hush my mouth! This sounds like a novel," Bunny chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Believe it or not, papa, it\'s what God loves," Matthew grinned.\r\n\r\n"Well, you lucky hound! Getting white didn\'t hurt you none."\r\n\r\n"Now listen, Bunny," said Matthew, dropping to a more serious tone,\r\n"from now on you\'re private secretary to the Grand Exalted Giraw;\r\nthat\'s me."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a Giraw?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you; I don\'t know myself. Ask Givens sometime. He\r\ninvented it but if he can explain it I\'ll give you a grand."\r\n\r\n"When do I start to work? Or rather, when do I start drawing money?"\r\n\r\n"Right now, Old Timer. Here\'s a century to get you fixed up. You eat\r\ndinner with me tonight and report to me in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Fathers above!" said Bunny. "Dixie must be heaven."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be hell for you if these babies find you out; so keep your nose\r\nclean."\r\n\r\n"Watch me, Mr. Giraw."\r\n\r\n"Now listen, Bunny. You know Santop Licorice, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Who doesn\'t know that hippo?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve had him on our payroll since December. He\'s fighting\r\nBeard, Whooper, Spelling and that crowd. He was on the bricks and we\r\nhelped him out. Got his paper to appearing regularly, and all that sort\r\nof thing."\r\n\r\n"So the old crook sold out the race, did he?" cried the amazed Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Hold that race stuff, you\'re not a shine anymore. Are you surprised\r\nthat he sold out? You\'re actually becoming innocent," said Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Well, what about the African admiral?" Bunny asked.\r\n\r\n"This: In a couple of days I want you to run up to New York and look\r\naround and see if his retention on the payroll is justified. I got a\r\nhunch that nobody is bothering about his paper or what he says, and\r\nif that\'s true we might as well can him; I can use the jack to better\r\nadvantage."\r\n\r\n"Listen here, Boy, this thing is running me nuts. Here you are fighting\r\nthis Black-No-More, and so is Beard, Whooper, Gronne, Spelling and the\r\nrest of the Negro leaders, yet you have Licorice on the payroll to\r\nfight the same people that are fighting your enemy. This thing is more\r\ncomplicated than a flapper\'s past."\r\n\r\n"Simple, Bunny, simple. Reason why you can\'t understand it is because\r\nyou don\'t know anything about high strategy."\r\n\r\n"High what?" asked Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, look it up at your leisure. Now you can savvy the fact\r\nthat the sooner these spades are whitened the sooner this graft will\r\nfall through, can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Righto," said his friend.\r\n\r\n"Well, the longer we can make the process, the longer we continue to\r\ndrag down the jack. Is that clear?"\r\n\r\n"As a Spring day."\r\n\r\n"You\'re getting brighter by the minute, old man," jeered Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Coming from you, that\'s no compliment."\r\n\r\n"As I was saying, the longer it takes, the longer we last. It\'s my\r\nbusiness to see that it lasts a long time but neither do I want it to\r\nstop because that also would be disastrous."\r\n\r\nBunny nodded: "You\'re a wise egg!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, that makes it unanimous. Well, I don\'t want my side to get\r\nsuch an upper hand that it will put the other side out of business, or\r\nvice versa. What we want is a status quo."\r\n\r\n"Gee, you\'ve got educated since you\'ve been down here with these\r\ncrackers."\r\n\r\n"You flatter them, Bunny; run along now. I\'ll have my car come by your\r\nhotel to bring you to dinner."\r\n\r\n"Thanks for the compliment, old man, but I\'m staying at the Y. M. C. A.\r\nIt\'s cheaper," laughed Bunny.\r\n\r\n"But is it safer?" kidded Matthew, as his friend withdrew.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Bunny Brown left for New York on a secret mission. Not\r\nonly was he to spy on Santop Licorice and see how effective his work\r\nwas, but he was also to approach Dr. Shakespeare Agamemnon Beard,\r\nDr. Napoleon Wellington Jackson, Rev. Herbert Gronne, Col. Mortimer\r\nRoberts, Prof. Charles Spelling, and the other Negro leaders with a\r\nview to getting them to speak to white audiences for the benefit of the\r\nKnights of Nordica. Matthew already knew that they were in a precarious\r\neconomic situation since they now had no means of income, both the\r\nblack masses and the philanthropic whites having deserted them. Their\r\nwhite friends, mostly Northern plutocrats, felt that the race problem\r\nwas being satisfactorily solved by Black-No-More, Incorporated, and so\r\ndid the Negroes. Bunny\'s job was to convince them that it was better\r\nto lecture for the K. of N. and grow fat than to fail to get chances\r\nto lecture to Negroes who weren\'t interested in what they said anyhow.\r\nThe Grand Exalted Giraw had a personal interest in these Negro leaders.\r\nHe realized that they were too old or too incompetent to make a living\r\nexcept by preaching and writing about the race problem, and since they\r\nhad lost their influence with the black masses, they might be a novelty\r\nto introduce to the K. of N. audiences. He felt that their racial\r\nintegrity talks would click with the crackers. They knew more about it\r\ntoo than any of his regular speakers, he realized.\r\n\r\nAs the train bearing Bunny pulled into the station in Charlotte, he\r\nbought an evening paper. The headline almost knocked him down:\r\n\r\n                   WEALTHY WHITE GIRL HAS NEGRO BABY\r\n\r\nHe whistled softly and muttered to himself, "Business picks up from now\r\non." He thought of Matthew\'s marriage and whistled again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom that time on there were frequent reports in the daily press of\r\nwhite women giving birth to black babies. In some cases, of course, the\r\nwhite women had recently become white but the blame for the tar-brushed\r\noffspring in the public mind always rested on the shoulders of the\r\nfather, or rather, of the husband. The number of cases continued to\r\nincrease. All walks of life were represented. For the first time the\r\nprevalence of sexual promiscuity was brought home to the thinking\r\npeople of America. Hospital authorities and physicians had known about\r\nit in a general way but it had been unknown to the public.\r\n\r\nThe entire nation became alarmed. Hundreds of thousands of people,\r\nNorth and South, flocked into the Knights of Nordica. The real white\r\npeople were panic-stricken, especially in Dixie. There was no way,\r\napparently, of telling a real Caucasian from an imitation one. Every\r\nstranger was viewed with suspicion, which had a very salutory effect on\r\nthe standard of sex morality in the United States. For the first time\r\nsince 1905, chastity became a virtue. The number of petting parties,\r\ngreatly augmented by the development of aviation, fell off amazingly.\r\nOne must play safe, the girls argued.\r\n\r\nThe holidays of traveling salesmen, business men and fraternal\r\ndelegates were made less pleasant than of yore. The old orgiastic\r\ndays in the big cities seemed past for all time. It also suddenly\r\nbegan to dawn upon some men that the pretty young thing they had met\r\nat the seashore and wanted to rush to the altar might possibly be a\r\nwhitened Negress; and young women were almost as suspicious. Rapid-fire\r\ncourtships and gin marriages declined. Matrimony at last began to be\r\napproached with caution. Nothing like this situation had been known\r\nsince the administration of Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\nBlack-No-More, Incorporated, was not slow to seize upon this\r\nopportunity to drum up more business. With 100 sanitariums going full\r\nblast from Coast to Coast, it now announced in full page advertisements\r\nin the daily press that it was establishing lying-in hospitals in the\r\nprincipal cities where all prospective mothers could come to have their\r\nbabies, and that whenever a baby was born black or mulatto, it would\r\nimmediately be given the 24-hour treatment that permanently turned\r\nblack infants white. The country breathed easier, particularly the four\r\nmillion Negroes who had become free because white.\r\n\r\nIn a fortnight Bunny Brown returned. Over a quart of passable rye, the\r\ntwo friends discussed his mission.\r\n\r\n"What about Licorice?" asked Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Useless. You ought to give him the gate. He\'s taking your jack but he\r\nisn\'t doing a thing but getting your checks and eating regularly. His\r\nfollowers are scarcer than Jews in the Vatican."\r\n\r\n"Well, were you able to talk business with any of the Negro leaders?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t find any of them. Their offices are all closed and they\'ve\r\nmoved away from the places where they used to live. Broke, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Did you inquire for them around Harlem?"\r\n\r\n"What was the use? All of the Negroes around Harlem nowadays are folks\r\nthat have just come there to get white; the rest of them left the race\r\na long time ago. Why, Boy, darkies are as hard to find on Lenox Avenue\r\nnow as they used to be in Tudor City."\r\n\r\n"What about the Negro newspapers? Are any of them running still?"\r\n\r\n"Nope, they\'re a thing of the past. Shines are too busy getting white\r\nto bother reading about lynching, crime and peonage," said Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Matthew, "it looks as if old Santop Licorice is the only\r\none of the old gang left."\r\n\r\n"Yeah, and he won\'t be black long, now that you\'re cutting him off the\r\npayroll."\r\n\r\n"I think he could make more money staying black."\r\n\r\n"How do you figure that out?" asked Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Well, the dime museums haven\'t closed down, you know," said Matthew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne June morning in 1934, Grand Exalted Giraw Fisher received a report\r\nfrom one of his secret operatives in the town of Paradise, South\r\nCarolina, saying:\r\n\r\n    "The working people here are talking about going on strike next\r\n    week unless Blickdoff and Hortzenboff, the owners of the Paradise\r\n    Mill increase pay and shorten hours. The average wage is around\r\n    fifteen dollars a week, the work day eleven hours. In the past\r\n    week the company has speeded up the work so much that the help\r\n    say they cannot stand the pace.\r\n\r\n    "The owners are two Germans who came to this country after the war.\r\n    They employ 1000 hands, own all of the houses in Paradise and\r\n    operate all of the stores. Most of the hands belong to the Knights\r\n    of Nordica and they want the organization to help them unionize.\r\n    Am awaiting instructions."\r\n\r\nMatthew turned to Bunny and grinned. "Here\'s more money," he boasted,\r\nshaking the letter in his assistant\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What can you do about it?" that worthy inquired.\r\n\r\n"What can I do? Well, Brother, you just watch my smoke. Tell Ruggles to\r\nget the plane ready," he ordered. "We\'ll fly over there at once."\r\n\r\nTwo hours later Matthew\'s plane sat down on the broad, close-clipped\r\nlawn in front of the Blickdoff-Hortzenboff cotton mill. Bunny and the\r\nGrand Giraw entered the building and walked to the office.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you wish to see?" asked a clerk.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Blickdoff, Mr. Hortzenboff or both; preferably both," Matthew\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"And who\'s calling?"\r\n\r\n"The Grand Exalted Giraw of the Ancient and Honorable Order of the\r\nKnights of Nordica and his secretary," boomed that gentleman. The awed\r\nyoung lady retired into an inner sanctum.\r\n\r\n"That sure is some title," commented Bunny in an undertone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Givens knows his stuff when it comes to that. The longer and\r\nsillier a title, the better the yaps like it."\r\n\r\nThe young lady returned and announced that the two owners would be glad\r\nto receive the eminent Atlantan. Bunny and Matthew entered the office\r\nmarked "Private."\r\n\r\nHands were shaken, greetings exchanged and then Matthew got right down\r\nto business. He had received contributions from these two mill owners\r\nso to a certain extent they understood one another.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," he queried, "is it true that your employees are planning\r\nto strike next week?"\r\n\r\n"So ve haff heardt," puffed the corpulent, under-sized Blickdoff.\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you going to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"De uszual t\'ing, uff coarse," replied Hortzenboff, who resembled a\r\nbeer barrel on stilts.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t do the usual thing," warned Matthew. "Most of these people\r\nare members of the Knights of Nordica. They are looking to us for\r\nprotection and we mean to give it to them."\r\n\r\n"Vy ve t\'ought you vas favorable," exclaimed Blickdoff.\r\n\r\n"Und villing to be reasonable," added Hortzenboff.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," Matthew agreed, "but you\'re squeezing these people too\r\nhard."\r\n\r\n"But ve can\'t pay dem any more," protested the squat partner. "Vot ve\r\ngonna do?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you fellows can\'t kid me, I know you\'re coining the jack; but if\r\nyou think its worth ten grand to you, I think I can adjust matters,"\r\nthe Grand Giraw stated.\r\n\r\n"Ten t\'ousand dollars?" the two mill men gasped.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got good ears," Matthew assured them. "And if you don\'t come\r\nacross I\'ll put the whole power of my organization behind your hands.\r\nThen it\'ll cost you a hundred grand to get back to normal."\r\n\r\nThe Germans looked at each other incredulously.\r\n\r\n"Are you t\'reatening us, Meester Fisher?" whined Blickdoff.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got a good head at figuring out things, Blickdoff," Matthew\r\nretorted, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"Suppose ve refuse?" queried the heavier Teuton.\r\n\r\n"Yeah, suppose you do. Can\'t you imagine what\'ll happen when I pull\r\nthese people off the job?"\r\n\r\n"Ve\'ll call oudt de militia," warned Blickdoff.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make me laugh," Matthew commented. "Half the militiamen are\r\nmembers of my outfit."\r\n\r\nThe Germans shrugged their shoulders hopelessly while Matthew and Bunny\r\nenjoyed their confusion.\r\n\r\n"How mutch you say you wandt?" asked Hortzenboff.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen grand," replied the Grand Giraw, winking at Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Budt you joost said ten t\'ousand a minute ago," screamed Blickdoff,\r\ngesticulating.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s fifteen now," said Matthew, "and it\'ll be twenty grand if\r\nyou babies don\'t hurry up and make up your mind."\r\n\r\nHortzenboff reached hastily for the big check book and commenced\r\nwriting. In a moment he handed Matthew the check.\r\n\r\n"Take this back to Atlanta in the plane," ordered Matthew, handing the\r\ncheck to Bunny, "and deposit it. Safety first." Bunny went out.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t act like you trust us," Blickdoff accused.\r\n\r\n"Why should I?" the ex-Negro retorted. "I\'ll just stick around for a\r\nwhile and keep you two company. You fellows might change your mind and\r\nstop payment on that check."\r\n\r\n"Ve are honest men, Meester Fisher," cried Hortzenboff.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'ll tell one," sneered the Grand Giraw, seating himself and\r\ntaking a handful of cigars out of a box on the desk.\r\n\r\nThe following evening the drab, skinny, hollow-eyed mill folk trudged\r\nto the mass meeting called by Matthew in the only building in Paradise\r\nnot owned by the company--the Knights of Nordica Hall. They poured into\r\nthe ramshackle building, seated themselves on the wooden benches and\r\nwaited for the speaking to begin.\r\n\r\nThey were a sorry lot, under-nourished, bony, vacant-looking, and\r\nyet they had seen a dim light. Without suggestion or agitation from\r\nthe outside world, from which they were almost as completely cut off\r\nas if they had been in Siberia, they had talked among themselves and\r\nconcluded that there was no hope for them except in organization. What\r\nthey all felt they needed was wise leadership, and they looked to the\r\nKnights of Nordica for it, since they were all members of it and there\r\nwas no other agency at hand. They waited now expectantly for the words\r\nof wisdom and encouragement which they expected to hear fall from the\r\nlips of their beloved Matthew Fisher, who now looked down upon them\r\nfrom the platform with cynical humor mingled with disgust.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait. A tall, gaunt, mountaineer, who acted as\r\nchairman, after beseeching the mill hands to stand together like men\r\nand women, introduced the Grand Exalted Giraw.\r\n\r\nMatthew spoke forcefully and to the point. He reminded them that they\r\nwere men and women; that they were free, white and twenty-one; that\r\nthey were citizens of the United States; that America was their country\r\nas well as Rockefeller\'s; that they must stand firm in the defense\r\nof their rights as working people; that the worker was worthy of his\r\nhire; that nothing should be dearer to them than the maintenance of\r\nwhite supremacy. He insinuated that even in their midst there probably\r\nwere some Negroes who had been turned white by Black-No-More. Such\r\nindividuals, he insisted made poor union material because they always\r\nshowed their Negro characteristics and ran away in a crisis. Ending\r\nwith a fervent plea for liberty, justice and a square deal, he sat down\r\namid tumultuous applause. Eager to take advantage of their enthusiasm,\r\nthe chairman began to call for members. Happily the people crowded\r\naround the little table in front of the platform to give their names\r\nand pay dues.\r\n\r\nSwanson, the chairman and acknowledged leader of the militant element,\r\nwas tickled with the results of the meeting. He slapped his thighs\r\nmountaineer fashion, shifted his chew of tobacco from the right cheek\r\nto the left, his pale blue eyes twinkling, and "allowed" to Matthew\r\nthat the union would soon bring the Paradise Mill owners to terms. The\r\nGrand Exalted Giraw agreed.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, back in Atlanta, Matthew held a conference with a\r\nhalf-dozen of his secret operatives in his office. "Go to Paradise and\r\ndo your stuff," he commanded, "and do it right."\r\n\r\nThe next day the six men stepped from the train in the little South\r\nCarolina town, engaged rooms at the local hotel and got busy. They let\r\nit be known that they were officials of the Knights of Nordica sent\r\nfrom Atlanta by the Grand Exalted Giraw to see that the mill workers\r\ngot a square deal. They busied themselves visiting the three-room\r\ncottages of the workers, all of which looked alike, and talking very\r\nconfidentially.\r\n\r\nIn a day or so it began to be noised about that Swanson, leader of\r\nthe radical element, was really a former Negro from Columbia. It\r\nhappened that a couple of years previously he had lived in that\r\ncity. Consequently he readily admitted that he had lived there when\r\nasked innocently by one of the strangers in the presence of a group\r\nof workers. When Swanson wasn\'t looking, the questioner glanced\r\nsignificantly at those in the group.\r\n\r\nThat was enough. To the simple-minded workers Swanson\'s admission was\r\nconclusive evidence that the charge of being a Negro was true. When he\r\ncalled another strike meeting, no one came except a few of Fisher\'s\r\nmen. The big fellow was almost ready to cry because of the unexplained\r\nfalling away of his followers. When one of the secret operatives told\r\nhim the trouble he was furious.\r\n\r\n"Ah haint no damn nigger a-tall," he shouted. "Ah\'m a white man an\' kin\r\nprove hit!"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately he could not prove to the satisfaction of his fellow\r\nworkers that he was not a Negro. They were adamant. On the streets\r\nthey passed him without speaking and they complained to the foremen\r\nat the mill that they didn\'t want to work with a nigger. Broken and\r\ndisheartened after a week of vain effort, Swanson was glad to accept\r\ncarfare out of the vicinity from one of Matthew\'s men who pretended to\r\nbe sympathetic.\r\n\r\nWith the departure of Swanson, the cause of the mill workers was dealt\r\na heavy blow, but the three remaining ringleaders sought to carry on.\r\nThe secret operatives of the Grand Exalted Giraw got busy again. One\r\nof the agitators was asked if it was true that his grandfather was a\r\nnigger. He strenuously denied the charge but being ignorant of the\r\nidentity of his father he could not very well be certain about his\r\ngrandfather. He was doomed. Within a week the other two were similarly\r\ndiscredited. Rumor was wafted abroad that the whole idea of a strike\r\nwas a trick of smart niggers in the North who were in the pay of the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nThe erstwhile class conscious workers became terror-stricken by the\r\nspecter of black blood. You couldn\'t, they said, be sure of anybody any\r\nmore, and it was better to leave things as they were than to take a\r\nchance of being led by some nigger. If the colored gentry couldn\'t sit\r\nin the movies and ride in the trains with white folks, it wasn\'t right\r\nfor them to be organizing and leading white folks.\r\n\r\nThe radicals and laborites in New York City had been closely watching\r\ndevelopments in Paradise ever since the news of the big mass meeting\r\naddressed by Matthew was broadcast by the Knights of Nordica news\r\nservice. When it seemed that the mill workers were, for some mysterious\r\nreason, going to abandon the idea of striking, liberal and radical\r\nlabor organizers were sent down to the town to see what could be done\r\ntoward whipping up the spirit of revolt.\r\n\r\nThe representative of the liberal labor organization arrived first and\r\nimmediately announced a meeting in the Knights of Nordica Hall, the\r\nonly obtainable place. Nobody came. The man couldn\'t understand it. He\r\nwalked out into the town square, approached a little knot of men and\r\nasked what was the trouble.\r\n\r\n"Y\'re from that there Harlem in N\'Yawk, haint ye?" asked one of the\r\nvillagers.\r\n\r\n"Why yes, I live in Harlem. What about it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we haint a gonna have no damn nigger leadin\' us, an\' if ye know\r\nwhut\'s healthy fer yuh yo\'ll git on away f\'um here," stated the speaker.\r\n\r\n"Where do you get that nigger stuff?" inquired the amazed and insulted\r\norganizer. "I\'m a white man."\r\n\r\n"Yo ain\'t th\' first white nigger whut\'s bin aroun\' these parts," was\r\nthe reply.\r\n\r\nThe organizer, puzzled but helpless, stayed around town for a week and\r\nthen departed. Somebody had told the simple folk that Harlem was the\r\nNegro district in New York, after ascertaining that the organizer lived\r\nin that district. To them Harlem and Negro became synonymous and the\r\nlaborite was doomed.\r\n\r\nThe radical labor organizer, refused permission to use the Knights of\r\nNordica Hall because he was a Jew, was prevented from holding a street\r\nmeeting when someone started a rumor that he believed in dividing up\r\nproperty, nationalizing women, and was in addition an atheist. He\r\nfreely admitted the first, laughed at the second and proudly proclaimed\r\nthe third. That was sufficient to inflame the mill hands, although God\r\nhad been strangely deaf to their prayers, they owned no property to\r\ndivide and most of their women were so ugly that they need have had no\r\nfears that any outsiders would want to nationalize them. The disciple\r\nof Lenin and Trotsky vanished down the road with a crowd of emaciated\r\nworkers at his heels.\r\n\r\nSoon all was quiet and orderly again in Paradise, S. C. On the advice\r\nof a conciliator from the United States Labor Department, Blickdoff\r\nand Hortzenboff took immediate steps to make their workers more\r\nsatisfied with their pay, their jobs and their little home town. They\r\nbuilt a swimming pool, a tennis court, shower baths and a playground\r\nfor their employees but neglected to shorten their work time so these\r\nimprovements could be enjoyed. They announced that they would give each\r\nworker a bonus of a whole day\'s pay at Christmas time, hereafter, and a\r\nweek\'s vacation each year to every employee who had been with them more\r\nthan ten years. There were no such employees, of course, but the mill\r\nhands were overjoyed with their victory.\r\n\r\nThe local Baptist preacher, who was very thoughtfully paid by the\r\ncompany with the understanding that he would take a practical view of\r\nconditions in the community, told his flock their employers were to be\r\ncommended for adopting a real Christian and American way of settling\r\nthe difficulties between them and their workers. He suggested it was\r\nquite likely that Jesus, placed in the same position, would have done\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\n"Be thankful for the little things," he mooed. "God works in mysterious\r\nways his wonders to perform. Ye shall know the truth and the truth\r\nshall set ye free. The basis of all things is truth. Let us not be led\r\nastray by the poison from vipers\' tongues. This is America and not\r\nRussia. Patrick Henry said \'Give me liberty or give me death\' and the\r\ntrue, red-blooded, 100 per cent American citizen says the same thing\r\ntoday. But there are right ways and wrong ways to get liberty. Your\r\nemployers have gone about it the right way. For what, after all is\r\nliberty except the enjoyment of life; and have they not placed within\r\nyour reach those things that bring happiness and recreation?\r\n\r\n"Your employers are interested, just as all true Americans are\r\ninterested, in the welfare of their fellow citizens, their fellow\r\ntownsmen. Their hearts beat for you. They are always thinking of you.\r\nThey are always planning ways to make conditions better for you.\r\nThey are sincerely doing all in their power. They have very heavy\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n"So you must be patient. Rome wasn\'t built in a day. All things turn\r\nout well in time. Christ knows what he is doing and he will not permit\r\nhis children to suffer.\r\n\r\n"O, ye of little faith! Let not your hearts store up jealousy, hatred\r\nand animosity. Let not your minds be wooed by misunderstanding. Let us\r\ntry to act and think as God would wish us to, and above all, let us,\r\nlike those two kindly men yonder, practice Christian tolerance."\r\n\r\nDespite this inspiring message, it was apparent to everyone that\r\nParadise would never be the same again. Rumors continued to fill the\r\nair. People were always asking each other embarrassing questions about\r\nbirth and blood. Fights became more frequent. Large numbers of the\r\nworkers, being of Southern birth, were unable to disprove charges of\r\npossessing Negro ancestry, and so were forced to leave the vicinity.\r\nThe mill hands kept so busy talking about Negro blood that no one\r\nthought of discussing wages and hours of labor.\r\n\r\nIn August, Messrs. Blickdoff and Hortzenboff, being in Atlanta on\r\nbusiness, stopped by Matthew\'s office.\r\n\r\n"Well, how\'s the strike?" asked the Grand Giraw.\r\n\r\n"Dot strike!" echoed Blickdoff. "Ach Gott! Dot strike neffer come off.\r\nVat you do, you razscal?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s my secret," replied Matthew, a little proudly. "Every man to\r\nhis trade, you know."\r\n\r\nIt had indeed become Matthew\'s trade and he was quite adept at it. What\r\nhad happened at Paradise had also happened elsewhere. There were no\r\nmore rumors of strikes. The working people were far more interested in\r\nwhat they considered, or were told was, the larger issue of race. It\r\ndid not matter that they had to send their children into the mills to\r\naugment the family wage; that they were always sickly and that their\r\ndeath rate was high. What mattered such little things when the very\r\nfoundation of civilization, white supremacy, was threatened?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor over two years now had Black-No-More, Incorporated, been carrying\r\non its self-appointed task of turning Negroes into Caucasians. The\r\njob was almost complete, except for the black folk in prisons, orphan\r\nasylums, insane asylums, homes for the aged, houses of correction\r\nand similar institutions. Those who had always maintained that it\r\nwas impossible to get Negroes together for anything but a revival,\r\na funeral or a frolic, now had to admit that they had co\xc3\xb6perated\r\nwell in getting white. The poor had been helped by the well-to-do,\r\nbrothers had helped sisters, children had assisted parents. There had\r\nbeen revived some of the same spirit of adventure prevalent in the\r\ndays of the Underground Railroad. As a result, even in Mississippi,\r\nNegroes were quite rare. In the North the only Negroes to be seen\r\nwere mulatto babies whose mothers, charmed by the beautiful color of\r\ntheir offspring, had defied convention and not turned them white. As\r\nthere had never been more than two million Negroes in the North, the\r\nwhitening process had been viewed indifferently by the masses because\r\nthose who controlled the channels of opinion felt that the country was\r\ngetting rid of a very vexatious problem at absolutely no cost; but not\r\nso in the South.\r\n\r\nWhen one-third of the population of the erstwhile Confederacy had\r\nconsisted of the much-maligned Sons of Ham, the blacks had really been\r\nof economic, social and psychological value to the section. Not only\r\nhad they done the dirty work and laid the foundation of its wealth, but\r\nthey had served as a convenient red herring for the upper classes when\r\nthe white proletariat grew restive under exploitation. The presence of\r\nthe Negro as an under class had also made of Dixie a unique part of the\r\nUnited States. There, despite the trend to industrialization, life was\r\na little different, a little pleasanter, a little softer. There was\r\ncontrast and variety, which was rare in a nation where standardization\r\nhad progressed to such an extent that a traveler didn\'t know what\r\ntown he was in until someone informed him. The South had always been\r\nidentified with the Negro, and vice versa, and its most pleasant\r\nmemories treasured in song and story, were built around this pariah\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe deep concern of the Southern Caucasians with chivalry, the\r\nprotection of white womanhood, the exaggerated development of race\r\npride and the studied arrogance of even the poorest half-starved white\r\npeon, were all due to the presence of the black man. Booted and starved\r\nby their industrial and agricultural feudal lords, the white masses\r\nderived their only consolation and happiness from the fact that they\r\nwere the same color as their oppressors and consequently better than\r\nthe mudsill blacks.\r\n\r\nThe economic loss to the South by the ethnic migration was\r\nconsiderable. Hundreds of wooden railroad coaches, long since condemned\r\nas death traps in all other parts of the country, had to be scrapped\r\nby the railroads when there were no longer any Negroes to jim crow.\r\nThousands of railroad waiting rooms remained unused because, having\r\nbeen set aside for the use of Negroes, they were generally too\r\ndingy and unattractive for white folk or were no longer necessary.\r\nThousands of miles of streets located in the former Black Belts, and\r\nthus without sewers or pavement, were having to be improved at the\r\ninsistent behest of the rapidly increased white population, real and\r\nimitation. Real estate owners who had never dreamed of making repairs\r\non their tumble-down property when it was occupied by the docile\r\nNegroes, were having to tear down, rebuild and alter to suit white\r\ntenants. Shacks and drygoods boxes that had once sufficed as schools\r\nfor Negro children, had now to be condemned and abandoned as unsuitable\r\nfor occupation by white youth. Whereas thousands of school teachers\r\nhad received thirty and forty dollars a month because of their Negro\r\nancestry, the various cities and counties of the Southland were now\r\nforced to pay the standard salaries prevailing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNaturally taxes increased. Chambers of Commerce were now unable to send\r\nout attractive advertising to Northern business firms offering no or\r\nvery low taxation as an inducement to them to move South nor were they\r\nable to offer as many cheap building sites. Only through the efforts\r\nof the Grand Exalted Giraw of the Knights of Nordica were they still\r\nable to point to their large reserves of docile, contented, Anglo-Saxon\r\nlabor, and who knew how long that condition would last?\r\n\r\nConsequently, the upper classes faced the future with some misgivings.\r\nAs if being deprived of the pleasure of black mistresses were not\r\nenough, there was a feeling that there would shortly be widespread\r\nrevolt against the existing medieval industrial conditions and\r\nresultant reduction of profits and dividends. The mill barons viewed\r\nwith distaste the prospect of having to do away with child labor.\r\nRearing back in their padded swivel chairs, they leaned fat jowls on\r\nwell-manicured hands and mourned the passing of the halcyon days of\r\nyore.\r\n\r\nIf the South had lost its Negroes, however, it had certainly not lost\r\nits vote, and the political oligarchy that ruled the section was losing\r\nits old assurance and complacency. The Republicans had made inroads\r\nhere and there in the 1934 Congressional elections. The situation\r\npolitically was changing and if drastic steps were not immediately\r\ntaken, the Republicans might carry the erstwhile Solid South, thus\r\npractically destroying the Democratic Party. Another Presidential\r\nelection was less than two years off. There would have to be fast work\r\nto ward off disaster. Far-sighted people, North and South, even foresaw\r\nthe laboring people soon forsaking both of the old parties and going\r\nSocialist. Politicians and business men shuddered at the thought of\r\nsuch a tragedy and saw horrible visions of old-age pensions, eight-hour\r\nlaws, unemployment insurance, workingmen\'s compensation, minimum-wage\r\nlegislation, abolition of child labor, dissemination of birth-control\r\ninformation, monthly vacations for female workers, two-month vacations\r\nfor prospective mothers, both with pay, and the probable killing of\r\nindividual initiative and incentive by taking the ownership of national\r\ncapital out of the hands of two million people and putting it into the\r\nhands of one hundred and twenty million.\r\n\r\nWhich explains why Senator Rufus Kretin of Georgia, one of the old\r\nDemocratic war horses, an incomparable Negro-baiter, a faithful\r\nservitor of the dominant economic interests of his state and the lusty\r\nfather of several black families since whitened, walked into the office\r\nof Imperial Grand Wizard Givens one day in March, 1935.\r\n\r\n"Boys," he began, as closeted with Rev. Givens, Matthew and Bunny in\r\nthe new modernistic Knights of Nordica palace, they quaffed cool and\r\nillegal beverages, "we gotta do sumpin and do it quick. These heah damn\r\nYankees ah makin\' inroads on ouah preserves, suh. Th\' Republican vote\r\nis a-growin\'. No tellin\' what\'s li\'ble tuh happen in this heah nex\'\r\n\'lection."\r\n\r\n"What can we do, Senator?" asked the Imperial Grand Wizard. "How can we\r\nserve the cause?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. That\'s just it, suh; jus\' what Ah came heah fo\',"\r\nreplied the Senator. "Naow sum o\' us was thinkin\' that maybe yo\'all\r\nmight be able to he\'p us keep these damn hicks in line. Yo\'all are\r\nintelligent gent\'men; you know what Ah\'m gettin\' at?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a pretty big order, Colonel," said Givens.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Matthew added. "It\'ll be a hard proposition. Conditions are no\r\nlonger what they used to be."\r\n\r\n"An\'," said Givens, "we can\'t do much with that nigger business, like\r\nwe used to do when th\' old Klan was runnin\'."\r\n\r\n"What about one o\' them theah Red scares," asked the Senator, hopefully.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" the clergyman snorted. "Better leave that there Red business\r\nalone. Times ain\'t like they was, you know. Anyhow, them damn Reds\'ll\r\nbe down here soon enough \'thout us encouragin\' \'em none."\r\n\r\n"Guess that\'s right, Gen\'ral," mused the statesman. Then brightening:\r\n"Lookaheah, Givens. This fellah Fisher\'s gotta good head. Why not let\r\nhim work out sumpin?"\r\n\r\n"Yeah, he sure has," agreed the Wizard, glad to escape any work except\r\nminding the treasury of his order. "If he can\'t do it, ain\'t nobody\r\ncan. Him and Bunny here is as shrewd as some o\' them old time darkies.\r\nHe! He! He!" He beamed patronizingly upon his brilliant son-in-law and\r\nhis plump secretary.\r\n\r\n"Well, theah\'s money in it. We got plenty o\' cash; what we want now\r\nis votes," the Senator explained. "C\'ose yuh caint preach that white\r\nsupremacy stuff ve\'y effectively when they haint no niggahs."\r\n\r\n"Leave it to me. I\'ll work out something," said Matthew. Here was a\r\nchance to get more power, more money. Busy as he was, it would not do\r\nto let the opportunity slip by.\r\n\r\n"Yuh caint lose no time," warned the Senator.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t," crowed Givens.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later they took a final drink together, shook hands and\r\nthe Senator, bobbing his white head to the young ladies in the outer\r\noffice, departed.\r\n\r\nMatthew and Bunny retired to the private office of the Grand Exalted\r\nGiraw.\r\n\r\n"What you thinkin\' about pullin\'?" asked Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Plenty. We\'ll try the old sure fire Negro problem stuff."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s ancient history, Brother," protested Bunny. "These ducks\r\nwon\'t fall for that any more."\r\n\r\n"Bunny, I\'ve learned something on this job, and that is that hatred\r\nand prejudice always go over big. These people have been raised on the\r\nNegro problem, they\'re used to it, they\'re trained to react to it. Why\r\nshould I rack my brain to hunt up something else when I can use a dodge\r\nthat\'s always delivered the goods?"\r\n\r\n"It may go over at that."\r\n\r\n"I know it will. Just leave it to me," said Matthew confidently.\r\n"That\'s not worrying me at all. What\'s got my goat is my wife being in\r\nthe family way." Matthew stopped bantering a moment, a sincere look of\r\npain erasing his usual ironic expression.\r\n\r\n"Congratulations!" burbled Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t rub it in," Matthew replied. "You know how the kid will look."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," agreed his pal. "You know, sometimes I forget who we\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t. I know I\'m a darky and I\'m always on the alert."\r\n\r\n"What do you intend to do?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Big Boy, I don\'t know. I would ordinarily send her to\r\none of those Lying-in Hospitals but she\'d be suspicious. Yet, if the\r\nkid is born it\'ll sure be black."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be white," Bunny agreed. "Why not tell her the whole thing\r\nand since she\'s so crazy about you, I don\'t think she\'d hesitate to go."\r\n\r\n"Man, you must be losing your mind, or else you\'ve lost it!" Matthew\r\nexploded. "She\'s a worse nigger-hater than her father. She\'d holler for\r\na divorce before you could say Jack Robinson."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got too much money for that."\r\n\r\n"You\'re assuming that she has plenty of intelligence."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s not discuss a painful subject," pleaded Matthew. "Suggest a\r\nremedy."\r\n\r\n"She don\'t have to know that she\'s going to one of Crookman\'s places,\r\ndoes she?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I can\'t get her to leave home to have the baby."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a lot of damn sentiment about having her baby in the old home, and\r\nher damned old mother supports her. So what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Then, the dear old homestead is the only thing that\'s holding up the\r\nplay?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a smart boy, Bunny."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t stress the obvious. Seriously, though, I think everything can be\r\nfixed okeh."\r\n\r\n"How?" cried Matthew, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Is it worth five grand?" countered Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Money\'s no object, you know, but explain your proposition."\r\n\r\n"I will not. You get me fifty century notes and I\'ll explain later."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a deal, old friend."\r\n\r\nBunny Brown was a man of action. That evening he entered the popular\r\nNiggerhead Caf\xc3\xa9, rendezvous of the questionable classes, and sat down\r\nat a table. The place was crowded with drinkers downing their "white\r\nmule" and contorting to the strains issuing from a radio loud-speaker.\r\nA current popular dance piece, "The Black Man Blues," was filling\r\nthe room. The songwriters had been making a fortune recently writing\r\nsentimental songs about the passing of the Negro. The plaintive voice\r\nof a blues singer rushed out of the loud-speaker:\r\n\r\n    "I wonder where my big, black man has gone;\r\n    Oh, I wonder where my big, black man has gone.\r\n    Has he done got faded an\' left me all alone?"\r\n\r\nWhen the music ceased and the dancers returned to their tables, Bunny\r\nbegan to look around. In a far corner he saw a waiter whose face\r\nseemed familiar. He waited until the fellow came close when he hailed\r\nhim. As the waiter bent over to get his order, he studied him closely.\r\nHe had seen this fellow somewhere before. Who could he be? Suddenly\r\nwith a start he remembered. It was Dr. Joseph Bonds, former head of the\r\nNegro Data League in New York. What had brought him here and to this\r\ncondition? The last time he had seen Bonds, the fellow was a power in\r\nthe Negro world, with a country place in Westchester County and a swell\r\napartment in town. It saddened Bunny to think that catastrophe had\r\novertaken such a man. Even getting white, it seemed, hadn\'t helped him\r\nmuch. He recalled that Bonds in his heyday had collected from the white\r\nphilanthropists with the slogan: "Work, Not Charity," and he smiled as\r\nhe thought that Bonds would be mighty glad now to get a little charity\r\nand not so much work.\r\n\r\n"Would a century note look good to you right now?" he asked the former\r\nNegro leader when he returned with his drink.\r\n\r\n"Just show it to me, Mister," said the waiter, licking his lips. "What\r\nyou want me to do?"\r\n\r\n"What will you do for a hundred berries?" pursued Bunny.\r\n\r\n"I\'d hate to tell you," replied Bonds, grinning and revealing his\r\nfamiliar tobacco-stained teeth.\r\n\r\n"Have you got a friend you can trust?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, a fellow named Licorice that washes pots in back."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean Santop Licorice, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Ssh! They don\'t know who he is here. He\'s white now, you know."\r\n\r\n"Do they know who you are?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" gasped the surprised waiter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I won\'t say anything but I know you\'re Bonds of New York."\r\n\r\n"Who told you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a little fairy."\r\n\r\n"How could that be? I never associate with them."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t that kind of a fairy," Bunny reassured him, laughing. "Well,\r\nyou get Licorice and come to my hotel when this place closes up."\r\n\r\n"Where is that?" asked Bonds. Bunny wrote his name and room number down\r\non a piece of paper and handed it to him.\r\n\r\nThree hours later Bunny was awakened by a knocking at his door. He\r\nadmitted Bonds and Licorice, the latter smelling strongly of steam and\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Bunny, holding up a hundred dollar bill, "is a century\r\nnote. If you boys can lay aside your scruples for a few hours you can\r\nhave five of them apiece."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bonds, "neither Santop nor I have been overburdened with\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I thought," Bunny murmured. He proceeded to outline the\r\nwork he wanted them to do.\r\n\r\n"But that would be a criminal offense," objected Licorice.\r\n\r\n"You too, Brutus?" sneered Bonds.\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t afford to take chances unless we\'re protected," the\r\nformer President of Africa argued rather weakly. He was money-hungry\r\nand was longing for a stake to get back to Demerara where, since there\r\nwas a large Negro population, a white man, by virtue of his complexion,\r\namounted to something. Yet, he had had enough experience behind the\r\nbars to make him wary.\r\n\r\n"We run this town and this state, too," Bunny assured him. "We could\r\nget a couple of our men to pull this stunt but it wouldn\'t be good\r\npolicy."\r\n\r\n"How about a thousand bucks apiece?" asked Bonds, his eyes glittering\r\nas he viewed the crisp banknotes in Bunny\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Here," said Bunny. "Take this century note between you, get your\r\nmaterial and pull the job. When you\'ve finished I\'ll give you nineteen\r\nmore like it between you."\r\n\r\nThe two cronies looked at each other and nodded.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a go," said Bonds.\r\n\r\nThey departed and Bunny went back to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next night about eleven-thirty the bells began to toll and the\r\nmournful sirens of the fire engines awakened the entire neighborhood in\r\nthe vicinity of Rev. Givens\'s home. That stately edifice, built by Ku\r\nKlux Klan dollars was in flames. Firemen played a score of streams onto\r\nthe blaze but the house appeared to be doomed.\r\n\r\nOn a lawn across the street, in the midst of a consoling crowd, stood\r\nRev. and Mrs. Givens, Helen and Matthew. The old couple were taking\r\nthe catastrophe fatalistically, Matthew was puzzled and suspicious,\r\nbut Helen was in hysterics. She presented a bedraggled and woebegone\r\nappearance with a blanket around her night dress. She wept afresh every\r\ntime she looked across at the blazing building where she had spent her\r\nhappy childhood.\r\n\r\n"Matthew," she sobbed, "will you build me another one just like it?"\r\n\r\n"Why certainly, Honey," he agreed, "but it will take quite a while."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know; I know, but I want it."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll get it, darling," he soothed, "but I think it would be a\r\ngood idea for you to go away for a while to rest your nerves. We\'ve got\r\nto think of the little one that\'s coming, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wanna go nowhere," she screamed.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got to go somewhere," he reasoned. "Don\'t you think so,\r\nMother?" Old Mrs. Givens agreed it would be a good idea but suggested\r\nthat she go along. To this Rev. Givens would not listen at first but\r\nhe finally yielded.\r\n\r\n"Guess it\'s a good idea after all," he remarked. "Women folks is always\r\nin th\' way when buildin\'s goin\' on."\r\n\r\nMatthew was tickled at the turn of affairs. On the way down to the\r\nhotel, he sat beside Helen, alternately comforting her and wondering as\r\nto the origin of the fire.\r\n\r\nNext morning, bright and early, Bunny, grinning broadly walked into the\r\noffice, threw his hat on a hook and sat down before his desk after the\r\ncustomary salutation.\r\n\r\n"Bunny," called Matthew, looking at him hard. "Get me told!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Bunny innocently.\r\n\r\n"Just as I thought," chuckled Matthew. "You\'re a nervy guy."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t get you," said Bunny, continuing the pose.\r\n\r\n"Come clean, Big Boy. How much did that fire cost?"\r\n\r\n"You gave me five grand, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Just like a nigger: a person can never get a direct answer from you."\r\n\r\n"Are you satisfied?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not crying my eyes out."\r\n\r\n"Is Helen going North for her confinement?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing different."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, why do you want to know the why and wherefore of that\r\nblaze?"\r\n\r\n"Just curiosity, Nero, old chap," grinned Matthew.\r\n\r\n"Remember," warned Bunny, mischievously, "curiosity killed the cat."\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the telephone bell interrupted their conversation.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" yelled Matthew into the mouthpiece. "The hell you say!\r\nAll right, I\'ll be right up." He hung up the receiver, jumped up\r\nexcitedly and grabbed his hat.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" shouted Bunny. "Somebody dead?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered the agitated Matthew, "Helen\'s had a miscarriage," and\r\nhe dashed out of the room.\r\n\r\n"Somebody dead right on," murmured Bunny, half aloud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoseph Bonds and Santop Licorice, clean shaven and immaculate, followed\r\nthe Irish red cap into their drawing room on the New York Express.\r\n\r\n"It sure feels good to get out of the barrel once more," sighed Bonds,\r\ndropping down on the soft cushion and pulling out a huge cigar.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t it the truth?" agreed the former Admiral of the Royal African\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\n\r\n"Bunny, I\'ve got it all worked out," announced Matthew, several\r\nmornings later, as he breezed into the office.\r\n\r\n"Got what worked out?"\r\n\r\n"The political proposition."\r\n\r\n"Spill it."\r\n\r\n"Well, here it is: First, we get Givens on the radio; national hookup,\r\nyou know, once a week for about two months."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll he talk about? Are you going to write it for him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he knows how to charm the yokels. He\'ll appeal to the American\r\npeople to call upon the Republican administration to close up the\r\nsanitariums of Dr. Crookman and deport everybody connected with\r\nBlack-No-More."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t deport citizens, silly," Bunny remonstrated.\r\n\r\n"That don\'t stop you from advocating it. This is politics, Big Boy."\r\n\r\n"Well, what else is on the program?"\r\n\r\n"Next: We start a campaign of denunciation against the Republicans\r\nin _The Warning_, connecting them with the Pope, Black-No-More and\r\nanything else we can think of."\r\n\r\n"But they were practically anti-Catholic in 1928, weren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Seven years ago, Bunny, seven years ago. How often must I tell\r\nyou that the people never remember anything? Next we pull the old\r\nWrite-to-your-Congressman-Write-to-your-Senator stuff. We carry the\r\nform letter in _The Warning_, the readers do the rest."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t win a campaign on that stuff, alone," said Bunny\r\ndisdainfully. "Bring me something better than that, Brother."\r\n\r\n"Well, the other step is a surprise, old chap. I\'m going to keep it\r\nunder my hat until later on. But when I spring it, old timer, it\'ll\r\nknock everybody for a row of toadstools." Matthew smiled mysteriously\r\nand smoothed back his pale blond hair.\r\n\r\n"When do we start this radio racket?" yawned Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Wait\'ll I talk it over with the Chief," said Matthew, rising, "and see\r\nhow he\'s dated up."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Thursday evening at 8:15 p.m. millions of people sat\r\nbefore their loud speakers, expectantly awaiting the heralded address\r\nto the nation by the Imperial Grand Wizard of the Knights of Nordica.\r\nThe program started promptly:\r\n\r\n"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience. This is\r\nStation W H A T, Atlanta, Ga., Mortimer K. Shanker announcing. This\r\nevening we are offering a program of tremendous interest to every\r\nAmerican citizen. The countrywide hookup over the chain of the Moronia\r\nBroadcasting Company is enabling one hundred million citizens to hear\r\none of the most significant messages ever delivered to the American\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n"Before introducing the distinguished speaker of the evening, however,\r\nI have a little treat in store for you. Mr. Jack Albert, the well-known\r\nBroadway singer and comedian, has kindly consented to render his\r\nfavorite among the popular songs of the day, \'Vanishing Mammy.\' Mr.\r\nAlbert will be accompanied by that incomparable aggregation of musical\r\ntalent, Sammy Snort\'s Bogalusa Babies.... Come on, Al, say a word or\r\ntwo to the ladies and gentlemen of the radio audience before you begin."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello folks. Awfully glad to see so many of you out there tonight.\r\nWell, that is to say, I suppose there are many of you out there. You\r\nknow I like to flatter myself, besides I haven\'t my glasses so I can\'t\r\nsee very well. However, that\'s not the pint, as the bootleggers say.\r\nI\'m terribly pleased to have the opportunity of starting off a program\r\nlike this with one of the songs I have come to love best. You know, I\r\nthink a whole lot of this song. I like it because it has feeling and\r\nsentiment. It means something. It carries you back to the good old\r\ndays that are dead and gone forever. It was written by Johnny Gulp with\r\nmusic by the eminent Japanese-American composer, Forkrise Sake. And, as\r\nMr. Shanker told you, I am being accompanied by Sammy Snort\'s Bogalusa\r\nBabies through the courtesy of the Artillery Caf\xc3\xa9, Chicago, Illinois.\r\nAll right, Sammy, smack it!"\r\n\r\nIn two seconds the blare of the jazz orchestra smote the ears of the\r\nunseen audience with the weird medley and clash of sound that had\r\npassed for music since the days of the Panama-Pacific Exposition.\r\nThen the sound died to a whisper and the plaintive voice of America\'s\r\npremier black-faced troubadour came over the air:\r\n\r\n    Vanishing Mammy, Mammy! Mammy! of Mine,\r\n    You\'ve been away, dear, such an awfully long time.\r\n    You went away, Sweet Mammy! Mammy! one summer night\r\n    I can\'t help thinkin\', Mammy, that you went white.\r\n    Of course I can\'t blame you, Mammy! Mammy! dear\r\n    Because you had so many troubles, Mammy, to bear.\r\n    But the old homestead hasn\'t been the same\r\n    Since I last heard you, Mammy, call my name.\r\n    And so I wait, loving Mammy, it seems in vain,\r\n    For you to come waddling back home again\r\n    Vanishing Mammy! Mammy! Mammy!\r\n    I\'m waiting for you to come back home again.\r\n\r\n"Now, radio audience, this is Mr. Mortimer Shanker speaking again. I\r\nknow you all loved Mr. Albert\'s soulful rendition of \'Vanishing Mammy.\'\r\nWe\'re going to try to get him back again in the very near future.\r\n\r\n"It now gives me great pleasure to introduce to you a man who hardly\r\nneeds any introduction. A man who is known throughout the civilized\r\nworld. A man of great scholarship, executive ability and organizing\r\ngenius. A man who has, practically unassisted, brought five million\r\nAmericans under the banner of one of the greatest societies in this\r\ncountry. It affords me great pleasure, ladies and gentlemen of the\r\nradio audience, to introduce Rev. Henry Givens, Imperial Grand Wizard\r\nof the Knights of Nordica, who will address you on the very timely\r\ntopic of \'The Menace of Negro Blood\'."\r\n\r\nRev. Givens, fortified with a slug of corn, advanced nervously to the\r\nmicrophone, fingering his prepared address. He cleared his throat and\r\ntalked for upwards of an hour during which time he successfully avoided\r\nsaying anything that was true, the result being that thousands of\r\ntelegrams and long distance telephone calls of congratulation came in\r\nto the studio. In his long address he discussed the foundations of\r\nthe Republic, anthropology, psychology, miscegenation, co\xc3\xb6peration\r\nwith Christ, getting right with God, curbing Bolshevism, the bane of\r\nbirth control, the menace of the Modernists, science versus religion,\r\nand many other subjects of which he was totally ignorant. The greater\r\npart of his time was taken up in a denunciation of Black-No-More,\r\nIncorporated, and calling upon the Republican administration of\r\nPresident Harold Goosie to deport the vicious Negroes at the head of it\r\nor imprison them in the federal penitentiary. When he had concluded "In\r\nthe name of our Saviour and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, Amen," he retired\r\nhastily to the washroom to finish his half-pint of corn.\r\n\r\nThe announcer took Rev. Givens\'s place at the microphone:\r\n\r\n"Now friends, this is Mortimer K. Shanker again, announcing from\r\nStation W H A T, Atlanta, Ga., with a nationwide hookup over the chain\r\nof the Moronia Broadcasting Company. You have just heard a scholarly\r\nand inspiring address by Rev. Henry Givens, Imperial Grand Wizard of\r\nthe Knights of Nordica on \'The Menace of Negro Blood.\' Rev. Givens will\r\ndeliver another address at this station a week from tonight.... Now,\r\nto end our program for the evening, friends, we are going to have a\r\npopular song by the well-known Goyter Sisters, lately of the State\r\nStreet Follies, entitled \'Why Did the Old Salt Shaker\'...."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe agitation of the Knights of Nordica soon brought action from the\r\nadministration at Washington. About ten days after Rev. Givens had\r\nceased his talks over the radio, President Harold Goosie announced\r\nto the assembled newspaper men that he was giving a great deal of\r\nstudy to the questions raised by the Imperial Grand Wizard concerning\r\nBlack-No-More, Incorporated; that several truckloads of letters\r\ncondemning the corporation had been received at the White House and\r\nwere now being answered by a special corps of clerks; that several\r\nSenators had talked over the matter with him, and that the country\r\ncould expect him to take some action within the next fortnight.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fortnight, the President announced that he had decided\r\nto appoint a commission of leading citizens to study the whole question\r\nthoroughly and to make recommendations. He asked Congress for an\r\nappropriation of $100,000 to cover the expenses of the commission.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives approved a resolution to that effect a\r\nweek later. The Senate, which was then engaged in a spirited debate on\r\nthe World Court and the League of Nations, postponed consideration of\r\nthe resolution for three weeks. When it came to vote before that august\r\nbody, it was passed, after long argument, with amendments and returned\r\nto the House.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after President Goosie had made his request of Congress, the\r\nresolution was passed in its final form. He then announced that inside\r\nof a week he would name the members of the commission.\r\n\r\nThe President kept his word. He named the commission, consisting of\r\nseven members, five Republicans and two Democrats. They were mostly\r\npoliticians temporarily out of a job.\r\n\r\nIn a private car the commission toured the entire country, visiting all\r\nof the Black-No-More sanitariums, the Crookman Lying-in Hospitals and\r\nthe former Black Belts. They took hundreds of depositions, examined\r\nhundreds of witnesses and drank large quantities of liquor.\r\n\r\nTwo months later they issued a preliminary report in which they\r\npointed out that the Black-No-More sanitariums and Lying-in Hospitals\r\nwere being operated within the law; that only one million Negroes\r\nremained in the country; that it was illegal in most of the states for\r\npure whites and persons of Negro ancestry to intermarry but that it\r\nwas difficult to detect fraud because of collusion. As a remedy the\r\nCommission recommended stricter observance of the law, minor changes\r\nin the marriage laws, the organization of special matrimonial courts\r\nwith trained genealogists attached to each, better equipped judges,\r\nmore competent district attorneys, the strengthening of the Mann Act,\r\nthe abolition of the road house, the closer supervision of dance halls,\r\na stricter censorship on books and moving pictures and government\r\ncontrol of cabarets. The commission promised to publish the complete\r\nreport of its activities in about six weeks.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, when practically everyone had forgotten that there\r\nhad ever been such an investigation, the complete report of the\r\ncommission, comprising 1789 pages in fine print came off the press.\r\nCopies were sent broadcast to prominent citizens and organizations.\r\nExactly nine people in the United States read it: the warden of a\r\ncounty jail, the proofreader at the Government Printing Office, the\r\njanitor of the City Hall in Ashtabula, Ohio, the city editor of the\r\nHelena (Ark.) _Bugle_, a stenographer in the Department of Health of\r\nSpokane, Wash., a dishwasher in a Bowery restaurant, a flunky in the\r\noffice of the Research Director of Black-No-More, Incorporated, a life\r\ntermer in Clinton Prison at Dannemora, N. Y., and a gag writer on the\r\nstaff of a humorous weekly in Chicago.\r\n\r\nMatthew received fulsome praise from the members of his organization\r\nand the higher-ups in the Southern Democracy. He had, they said,\r\nforced the government to take action, and they began to talk of him for\r\npublic office.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Exalted Giraw was jubilant. Everything, he told Bunny, had\r\ngone as he had planned. Now he was ready to turn the next trick.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asked his assistant, looking up from the morning comic\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n"Ever hear of the Anglo-Saxon Association of America?" Matthew queried.\r\n\r\n"No, what\'s their graft?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a graft, you crook. The Anglo-Saxon Association of America is\r\nan organization located in Virginia. The headquarters are in Richmond.\r\nIt\'s a group of rich highbrows who can trace their ancestry back almost\r\ntwo hundred years. You see they believe in white supremacy the same\r\nas our outfit but they claim that the Anglo-Saxons are the cream of\r\nthe white race and should maintain the leadership in American social,\r\neconomic and political life."\r\n\r\n"You sound like a college professor," sneered Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t insult me, you tripe. Listen now: This crowd thinks they\'re too\r\nhighbrow to come in with the Knights of Nordica. They say our bunch are\r\nmorons."\r\n\r\n"That about makes it unanimous," commented Bunny, biting off the end of\r\na cigar.\r\n\r\n"Well, what I\'m trying to do now is to bring these two organizations\r\ntogether. We\'ve got numbers but not enough money to win an election;\r\nthey have the jack. If I can get them to see the light we\'ll win the\r\nnext Presidential election hands down."\r\n\r\n"What\'ll I be: Secretary of the Treasury?" laughed Bunny.\r\n\r\n"Over my dead body!" Matthew replied, reaching for his flask. "But\r\nseriously, Old Top, if I can succeed in putting this deal over we\'ll\r\nhave the White House in a bag. No fooling!"\r\n\r\n"When do we get busy?"\r\n\r\n"Next week this Anglo-Saxon Association has its annual meeting in\r\nRichmond. You and I\'ll go up there and give them a spiel. We may take\r\nGivens along to add weight."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean intellectual weight, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Will you never stop kidding?"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Snobbcraft, President of the Anglo-Saxon Association, an\r\nF. F. V. and a man suspiciously swarthy for an Anglo-Saxon, had devoted\r\nhis entire life to fighting for two things: white racial integrity and\r\nAnglo-Saxon supremacy. It had been very largely a losing fight. The\r\nfarther he got from his goal, the more desperate he became. He had been\r\nthe genius that thought up the numerous racial integrity laws adopted\r\nin Virginia and many of the other Southern states. He was strong for\r\nsterilization of the unfit: meaning Negroes, aliens, Jews and other\r\nriff raff, and he had an abiding hatred of democracy.\r\n\r\nSnobbcraft\'s pet scheme now was to get a genealogical law passed\r\ndisfranchising all people of Negro or unknown ancestry. He argued that\r\ngood citizens could not be made out of such material. His organization\r\nhad money but it needed popularity--numbers.\r\n\r\nHis joy then knew no bounds when he received Matthew\'s communication.\r\nWhile he had no love for the Knights of Nordica which, he held,\r\ncontained just the sort of people he wanted to legislate into\r\nimpotency, social, economic and physical, he believed he could use them\r\nto gain his point. He wired Matthew at once, saying the Association\r\nwould be delighted to have him address them, as well as the Imperial\r\nGrand Wizard.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Exalted Giraw had long known of Snobbcraft\'s obsession, the\r\ngenealogical law. He also knew that there was no chance of ever getting\r\nsuch a law adopted but in order to even try to pass such a law it would\r\nbe necessary to win the whole country in a national election. Together,\r\nhis organization and Snobbcraft\'s could turn the trick; singly neither\r\none could do it.\r\n\r\nIn an old pre-Civil War mansion on a broad, tree-shaded boulevard, the\r\ndirectors of the Anglo-Saxon Association gathered in their annual\r\nmeeting. They listened first to Rev. Givens and next to Matthew. The\r\nmatter was referred to a committee which in an hour or two reported\r\nfavorably. Most of these men had dreamed from youth of holding high\r\npolitical office at the national capital as had so many eminent\r\nVirginians but none of them was Republican, of course, and the\r\nDemocrats never won anything nationally. By swallowing their pride for\r\na season and joining with the riff raff of the Knights of Nordica, they\r\nsaw an opportunity, for the first time in years to get into power; and\r\nthey took it. They would furnish plenty of money, they said, if the\r\nother group would furnish the numbers.\r\n\r\nGivens and Matthew returned to Atlanta in high spirits.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Brother Fisher," croaked Givens, "our star is ascending. I\r\ncan see no way for us to fail, with God\'s help. We\'ll surely defeat our\r\nenemy. Victory is in the air."\r\n\r\n"It sure looks that way," the Grand Giraw agreed. "With their money and\r\nours, we can certainly get together a larger campaign fund than the\r\nRepublicans."\r\n\r\nBack in Richmond Mr. Snobbcraft and his friends were in conference with\r\nthe statistician of a great New York insurance company. This man, Dr.\r\nSamuel Buggerie, was highly respected among members of his profession\r\nand well known by the reading public. He was the author of several\r\nbooks and wrote frequently for the heavier periodicals. His well-known\r\nwork, _The Fluctuation of the Sizes of Left Feet among the Assyrians\r\nduring the Ninth Century before Christ_ had been favorably commented\r\nupon by several reviewers, one of whom had actually read it. An even\r\nmore learned work of his was entitled _Putting Wasted Energy to Work_,\r\nin which he called attention, by elaborate charts and graphs, to the\r\npossibilities of harnessing the power generated by the leaves of trees\r\nrubbing together on windy days. In several brilliant monographs he\r\nhad proved that rich people have smaller families than the poor; that\r\nimprisonment does not stop crime; that laborers usually migrate in the\r\nwake of high wages. His most recent article in a very intellectual\r\nmagazine read largely by those who loafed for a living, he had proved\r\nstatistically that unemployment and poverty are principally a state\r\nof mind. This contribution was enthusiastically hailed by scholars\r\nand especially by business men as an outstanding contribution to\r\ncontemporary thought.\r\n\r\nDr. Buggerie was a ponderous, nervous, entirely bald, specimen of\r\nhumanity, with thick moist hands, a receding double chin and very\r\nprominent eyes that were constantly shifting about and bearing an\r\nexpression of seemingly perpetual wonderment behind their big\r\nhorn-rimmed spectacles. He seemed about to burst out of his clothes and\r\nhis pockets were always bulging with papers and notes.\r\n\r\nDr. Buggerie, like Mr. Snobbcraft, was a professional Anglo-Saxon as\r\nwell as a descendant of one of the First Families of Virginia. He held\r\nthat the only way to tell the pure whites from the imitation whites,\r\nwas to study their family trees. He claimed that such a nationwide\r\ninvestigation would disclose the various non-Nordic strains in the\r\npopulation. Laws, said he, should then be passed forbidding these\r\nstrains from mixing or marrying with the pure strains that had produced\r\nsuch fine specimens of mankind as Mr. Snobbcraft and himself.\r\n\r\nIn high falsetto voice he eagerly related to the directors of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Association the results of some of his preliminary\r\nresearches. These tended to show, he claimed, that there must be as\r\nmany as twenty million people in the United States who possessed some\r\nslight non-Nordic strain and were thus unfit for both citizenship\r\nand procreation. If the organization would put up the money for the\r\nresearch on a national scale, he declared that he could produce\r\nstatistics before election that would be so shocking that the\r\nRepublicans would lose the country unless they adopted the Democratic\r\nplank on genealogical examinations. After a long and eloquent talk by\r\nMr. Snobbcraft in support of Dr. Buggerie\'s proposition, the directors\r\nvoted to appropriate the money, on condition that the work be kept as\r\nsecret as possible. The statistician agreed although it hurt him to the\r\nheart to forego any publicity. The very next morning he began quietly\r\nto assemble his staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\n\r\nHank Johnson, Chuck Foster, Dr. Crookman and Gorman Gay, National\r\nChairman of the Republican National Committee, sat in the physician\'s\r\nhotel suite conversing in low tones.\r\n\r\n"We\'re having a tough time getting ready for the Fall campaign,"\r\nsaid Gay. "Unfortunately our friends are not contributing with their\r\naccustomed liberality."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t complain about us, can you?" asked Foster.\r\n\r\n"No, no," the politician denied quickly. "You have been most liberal in\r\nthe past two years, but then we have done many favors for you, too."\r\n\r\n"Yuh sho right, Gay," Hank remarked. "Dem crackahs mighta put us outa\r\nbusiness efen it hadn\' bin fo\' th\' admin\'strations suppo\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure we deeply appreciate the many favors we\'ve received\r\nfrom the present administration," added Dr. Crookman.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t need it much longer, though," said Chuck Foster.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that?" asked Gay, opening his half-closed eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve done about all the business we can do in this country.\r\nPractically all of the Negroes are white except a couple of thousand\r\ndiehards and those in institutions," Chuck informed him.\r\n\r\n"Dat\'s right," said Hank. "An\' it sho makes dis heah country lonesome.\r\nAh ain\'t seen a brown-skin ooman in so long Ah doan know whut Ah\'d do\r\nif Ah seen one."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Gay," added Dr. Crookman. "We\'ve about cleaned up the\r\nNegro problem in this country. Next week we\'re closing all except five\r\nof our sanitariums."\r\n\r\n"Well, what about your Lying-In hospitals?" asked Gay.\r\n\r\n"Of course we\'ll have to continue operating them," Crookman replied.\r\n"The women would be in an awful fix if we didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Now look here," proposed Gay, drawing closer to them and lowering his\r\nvoice. "This coming campaign is going to be one of the bitterest in the\r\nhistory of this country. I fear there will be rioting, shooting and\r\nkilling. Those hospitals cannot be closed without tremendous mental\r\nsuffering to the womanhood of the country. We want to avoid that and\r\nyou want to avoid it, too. Yet, these hospitals will constantly be in\r\ndanger. It ought to be worth something to you to have them especially\r\nprotected by the forces of the government."\r\n\r\n"You would do that anyway, wouldn\'t you Gay?" asked Crookman.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s going to cost us millions of votes to do it, and the\r\nmembers of the National Executive Committee seem to feel that you ought\r\nto make a very liberal donation to the campaign fund to make up for the\r\nvotes we\'ll lose."\r\n\r\n"What would you call a liberal donation?" Crookman inquired.\r\n\r\n"A successful campaign cannot be fought this year," Gay replied, "under\r\ntwenty millions."\r\n\r\n"Man," shouted Hank, "yuh ain\'t talkin\' \'bout dollahs, is yuh?"\r\n\r\n"You got it right, Hank," answered the National Chairman. "It\'ll cost\r\nthat much and maybe more."\r\n\r\n"Where do you expect to get all of that money?" queried Foster.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what\'s worrying us," Gay replied, "and that\'s why I\'m\r\nhere. You fellows are rolling in wealth and we need your help. In the\r\npast two years you\'ve collected around ninety million dollars from\r\nthe Negro public. Why not give us a good break? You won\'t miss five\r\nmillion, and it ought to be worth it to you fellows to defeat the\r\nDemocrats."\r\n\r\n"Five millions! Great Day," Hank exploded. "Man, is you los\' yo\' min\'?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," Gay denied. "Might as well own up that if we don\'t get\r\na contribution of about that size from you we\'re liable to lose this\r\nelection.... Come on, fellows, don\'t be so tight. Of course, you\'re\r\nsetting pretty and all you\'ve got to do is change your residence to\r\nEurope or some other place if things don\'t run smoothly in America, but\r\nyou want to think of those poor women with their black babies. What\r\nwill they do if you fellows leave the country or if the Democrats win\r\nand you have to close all of your places?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, Chief," Foster observed. "You can\'t let the women down."\r\n\r\n"Yeah," said Johnson. "Give \'im th\' jack."\r\n\r\n"Well, suppose we do?" concluded Crookman, smiling.\r\n\r\nThe National Chairman was delighted. "When can we collect?" he asked,\r\n"and how?"\r\n\r\n"Tomorrow, if yuh really wants it then," Johnson observed.\r\n\r\n"Now remember," warned Gay. "We cannot afford to let it be known that\r\nwe are getting such a large sum from any one person or corporation."\r\n\r\n"That\'s your lookout," said the physician, indifferently. "You know\r\n_we_ won\'t say anything."\r\n\r\nMr. Gay, shortly afterward, departed to carry the happy news to the\r\nNational Executive Committee, then in session right there in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Republicans certainly needed plenty of money to re-elect President\r\nGoosie. The frequent radio addresses of Rev. Givens, the growing\r\nnumbers of the Knights of Nordica, the inexplicable affluence of the\r\nDemocratic Party and the vitriolic articles in _The Warning_, had not\r\nfailed to rouse much Democratic sentiment. People were not exactly for\r\nthe Democrats but they were against the Republicans. As early as May it\r\ndid not seem possible for the Republicans to carry a single Southern\r\nstate and many of the Northern and Eastern strongholds were in doubt.\r\nThe Democrats seemed to have everything their way. Indeed, they were so\r\nconfident of success that they were already counting the spoils.\r\n\r\nWhen the Democratic Convention met in Jackson, Mississippi, on July 1,\r\n1936, political wise-acres claimed that for the first time in history\r\nthe whole program was cut and dried and would be run off smoothly\r\nand swiftly. Such, however, was not the case. The unusually hot sun,\r\ncoupled with the enormous quantities of liquor vended, besides the many\r\nconflicting interests present, soon brought dissension.\r\n\r\nShortly after the keynote speech had been delivered by Senator\r\nKretin, the Anglo-Saxon crowd let it be known that they wanted some\r\ndistinguished Southerner like Arthur Snobbcraft nominated for the\r\nPresidency. The Knights of Nordica were intent on nominating Imperial\r\nGrand Wizard Givens. The Northern faction of the party, now reduced to\r\na small minority in party councils, was holding out for former Governor\r\nGrogan of Massachusetts who as head of the League of Catholic Voters\r\nhad a great following.\r\n\r\nThrough twenty ballots the voting proceeded, and it remained\r\ndeadlocked. No faction would yield. Leaders saw that there had to be a\r\ncompromise. They retired to a suite on the top floor of the Judge Lynch\r\nHotel. There, in their shirt sleeves, with collars open, mint juleps on\r\nthe table and electric fans stirring up the hot air, they got down to\r\nbusiness. Twelve hours later they were still there.\r\n\r\nMatthew, wilted, worn but determined, fought for his chief. Simeon Dump\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon Association swore he would not withdraw the name\r\nof Arthur Snobbcraft. Rev. John Whiffle, a power in the party, gulped\r\ndrink after drink, kept dabbing a damp handkerchief at the shining\r\nsurface of his skull, and held out for one Bishop Belch. Moses Lejewski\r\nof New York argued obstinately for the nomination of Governor Grogan.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the delegates, having left the oven-like convention\r\nhall, either lay panting and drinking in their rooms, sat in the hotel\r\nlobbies discussing the deadlock or cruised the streets in automobiles\r\nconfidently seeking the dens of iniquity which they had been told were\r\neager to lure them into sin.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck three, Matthew rose and suggested that since the\r\nKnights of Nordica and the Anglo-Saxon Association were the two most\r\npowerful organizations in the party, Givens should get the presidential\r\nnomination, Snobbcraft the vice-presidential and the other candidates\r\nbe assured of cabinet positions. This suggested compromise appealed to\r\nno one except Matthew.\r\n\r\n"You people forget," said Simeon Dump, "that the Anglo-Saxon\r\nAssociation is putting up half the money to finance this campaign."\r\n\r\n"And you forget," declared Moses Lejewski, "that we\'re supporting your\r\ncrazy scheme to disfranchise anybody possessing Negro ancestry when\r\nwe get into office. That\'s going to cost us millions of votes in the\r\nNorth. You fellows can\'t expect to hog everything."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" challenged Dump. "How could you win without money?"\r\n\r\n"And how," added Matthew, "can you get anywhere without the Knights of\r\nNordica behind you?"\r\n\r\n"And how," Rev. Whiffle chimed in, "can you get anywhere without the\r\nFundamentalists and the Drys?"\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock they had got no farther than they had been at three.\r\nThey tried to pick some one not before mentioned, and went over and\r\nover the list of eligibles. None was satisfactory. One was too radical,\r\nanother was too conservative, a third was an atheist, a fourth had once\r\nrifled a city treasury, the fifth was of immigrant extraction once\r\nremoved, a sixth had married a Jewess, a seventh was an intellectual,\r\nan eighth had spent too long at Hot Springs trying to cure the\r\nsyphilis, a ninth was rumored to be part Mexican and a tenth had at one\r\ntime in his early youth been a Socialist.\r\n\r\nAt five o\'clock they were desperate, drunk and disgusted. The stuffy\r\nroom was a litter of discarded collars, cigarette and cigar butts,\r\nmatch stems, heaped ash trays and empty bottles. Matthew drank little\r\nand kept insisting on the selection of Rev. Givens. To the sodden and\r\nnodding men he painted marvelous pictures of the spoils of office and\r\ntheir excellent chance of getting there, and then suddenly declared\r\nthat the Knights of Nordica would withdraw unless Givens was nominated.\r\nThe threat aroused them. They cursed and called it a holdup, but\r\nMatthew was adamant. As a last stroke, he rose and pretended to be\r\nready to bolt the caucus. They remonstrated with him and finally gave\r\nin to him.\r\n\r\nOrders went out to the delegates. They assembled in the convention\r\nhall. The shepherds of the various state flocks cracked the whip and\r\nthe delegates voted accordingly. Late that afternoon the news went out\r\nto a waiting world that the Democrats had nominated Henry Givens for\r\nPresident and Arthur Snobbcraft for Vice-President. Mr. Snobbcraft\r\ndidn\'t like that at all, but it was better than nothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days later the Republican convention opened in Chicago. Better\r\ndisciplined, as usual, than the Democrats, its business proceeded like\r\nclockwork. President Goosie was nominated for re\xc3\xablection on the first\r\nballot and Vice-President Gump was again selected as his running mate.\r\nA platform was adopted whose chief characteristic was vagueness. As\r\nwas customary, it stressed the party\'s record in office, except that\r\nwhich was criminal; it denounced fanaticism without being specific,\r\nand it emphasized the rights of the individual and the trusts in the\r\nsame paragraph. As the Democratic slogan was White Supremacy and its\r\nplatform dwelt largely on the necessity of genealogical investigation,\r\nthe Republicans adopted the slogan: Personal Liberty and Ancestral\r\nSanctity.\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman and his associates, listening in on the radio in his suite\r\nin the Robin Hood Hotel in New York City, laughed softly as they heard\r\nthe President deliver his speech of acceptance which ended in the\r\nfollowing original manner:\r\n\r\n"And finally, my friends, I can only say that we shall continue in\r\nthe path of rugged individualism, free from the influence of sinister\r\ninterests, upholding the finest ideals of honesty, independence and\r\nintegrity, so that, to quote Abraham Lincoln, \'This nation of the\r\npeople, for the people and by the people shall not perish from the\r\nearth.\'"\r\n\r\n"That," said Foster, as the President ceased barking, "sounds almost\r\nlike the speech of acceptance of Brother Givens that we heard the other\r\nday."\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman smiled and brushed the ashes off his cigar. "It may even\r\nbe the same speech," he suggested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the hot days of July and August the campaign slowly got under\r\nway. Innumerable photographs appeared in the newspapers depicting\r\nthe rival candidates among the simple folk of some village, helping\r\nyoungsters to pick cherries, assisting an old woman up a stairway,\r\nbathing in the old swimming hole, eating at a barbecue and posing on\r\nthe rear platforms of special trains.\r\n\r\nLong articles appeared in the Sunday newspapers extolling the simple\r\nvirtues of the two great men. Both, it seemed, had come from poor\r\nbut honest families; both were hailed as tried and true friends of\r\nthe great, common people; both were declared to be ready to give\r\ntheir strength and intellect to America for the next four years. One\r\nwriter suggested that Givens resembled Lincoln, while another declared\r\nthat President Goosie\'s character was not unlike that of Roosevelt,\r\nbelieving he was paying the former a compliment.\r\n\r\nRev. Givens told the reporters: "It is my intention, if elected,\r\nto carry out the traditional tariff policy of the Democratic Party"\r\n(neither he or anyone else knew what that was).\r\n\r\nPresident Goosie averred again and again, "I intend to make my second\r\nterm as honest and efficient as my first." Though a dire threat, this\r\nstatement was supposed to be a fine promise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Samuel Buggerie and his operatives were making great\r\nheadway examining birth and marriage records throughout the United\r\nStates. Around the middle of September the Board of Directors held a\r\nconference at which the learned man presented a partial report.\r\n\r\n"I am now prepared to prove," gloated the obese statistician, "that\r\nfully one-quarter of the people of one Virginia county possess\r\nnon-white ancestry, Indian or Negro; and we can further prove that\r\nall of the Indians on the Atlantic Coast are part Negro. In several\r\ncounties in widely separated parts of the country, we have found\r\nthat the ancestry of a considerable percentage of the people is in\r\ndoubt. There is reason to believe that there are countless numbers of\r\npeople who ought not to be classed with whites and should not mix with\r\nAnglo-Saxons."\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the statistician should get his data in simple form\r\nthat anyone could read and understand, and have it ready to release\r\njust a few days before election. When the people saw how great was\r\nthe danger from black blood, it was reasoned, they would flock to the\r\nDemocratic standard and it would be too late for the Republicans to\r\nhalt the stampede.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo political campaign in the history of the country had ever been\r\nso bitter. On one side were those who were fanatically positive of\r\ntheir pure Caucasian ancestry; on the other side were those who knew\r\nthemselves to be "impure" white or had reason to suspect it. The\r\nformer were principally Democratic, the latter Republican. There was\r\nanother group which was Republican because it felt that a victory\r\nfor the Democrats might cause another Civil War. The campaign roused\r\nacrimonious dispute even within families. Often behind these family\r\nrifts lurked the knowledge or suspicion of a dark past.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign grew more bitter, denunciations of Dr. Crookman and\r\nhis activities grew more violent. A move was started to close all of\r\nhis hospitals. Some wanted them to be closed for all time; others\r\nadvised their closing for the duration of the campaign. The majority\r\nof thinking people (which wasn\'t so many) strenuously objected to the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n"No good purpose will be served by closing these hospitals," declared\r\nthe New York _Morning Earth_. "On the contrary such a step might have\r\ntragic results. The Negroes have disappeared into the body of our\r\ncitizenry, large numbers have intermarried with the whites and the\r\noffspring of these marriages are appearing in increasing numbers.\r\nWithout these hospitals, think how many couples would be estranged; how\r\nmany homes wrecked! Instead of taking precipitate action, we should be\r\npatient and move slowly."\r\n\r\nOther Northern newspapers assumed an even more friendly attitude, but\r\nthe press generally followed the crowd, or led it, and in slightly\r\nveiled language urged the opponents of Black-No-More to take the law\r\ninto their hands.\r\n\r\nFinally, emboldened and inflamed by fiery editorials, radio addresses,\r\npamphlets, posters and platform speeches, a mob seeking to protect\r\nwhite womanhood in Cincinnati attacked a Crookman hospital, drove\r\nseveral women into the streets and set fire to the building. A dozen\r\nbabies were burned to death and others, hastily removed by their\r\nmothers, were recognized as mulattoes. The newspapers published names\r\nand addresses. Many of the women were very prominent socially either in\r\ntheir own right or because of their husbands.\r\n\r\nThe nation was shocked as never before. Republican sentiment began to\r\ndwindle. The Republican Executive Committee met and discussed ways\r\nand means of combating the trend. Gorman Gay was at his wits\' end.\r\nNothing, he thought, could save them except a miracle.\r\n\r\nTwo flights below in a spacious office sat two of the Republican\r\ncampaigners, Walter Williams and Joseph Bonds, busily engaged in\r\nleading the other workers (who knew better) to believe that they\r\nwere earning the ten dollars a day they were receiving. The former\r\nhad passed for a Negro for years on the strength of a part-Negro\r\ngrandparent and then gone back to the white race when the National\r\nSocial Equality League was forced to cease operations at the insistence\r\nof both the sheriff and the landlord. Joseph Bonds, former head of the\r\nNegro Data League who had once been a Negro but thanks to Dr. Crookman\r\nwas now Caucasian and proud of it, had but recently returned to the\r\nNorth from Atlanta, accompanied by Santop Licorice. Both Mr. Williams\r\nand Mr. Bonds had been unable to stomach the Democratic crowd and so\r\nhad fallen in with the Republicans, who were as different from them as\r\none billiard ball from another. The two gentlemen were in low tones\r\ndiscussing the dilemma of the Republicans, while rustling papers to\r\nappear busy.\r\n\r\n"Jo, if we could figure out something to turn the tables on these\r\nDemocrats, we wouldn\'t have to work for the rest of our lives,"\r\nWilliams observed, blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke out of the other\r\ncorner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s right, Walt, but there ain\'t a chance in the world. Old\r\nGay is almost crazy, you know. Came in here slamming doors and snapping\r\nat everybody this morning," Bonds remarked.\r\n\r\nWilliams leaned closer to him, lowered his flame-thatched head and then\r\nlooking to the right and left whispered, "Listen here, do you know\r\nwhere Beard is?"\r\n\r\n"No," answered Bonds, starting and looking around to see if anyone was\r\nlistening. "Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I got a letter from him the other day. He\'s down there in\r\nRichmond doing research work for the Anglo-Saxon Association under that\r\nDr. Buggerie."\r\n\r\n"Do they know who he is?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they don\'t. He\'s been white quite a while now, you know, and\r\nof course they\'d never connect him with the Dr. Shakespeare A. Beard\r\nwho used to be one of their most outspoken enemies."\r\n\r\n"Well, what about it?" persisted Bonds, eagerly. "Do you think he might\r\nknow something on the Democrats that might help?"\r\n\r\n"He might. We could try him out anyway. If he knows anything he\'ll\r\nspill it because he hates that crowd."\r\n\r\n"How will you get in touch with him quickly? Write to him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," growled Williams. "I\'ll get expenses from Gay for the\r\ntrip. He\'ll fall for anything now."\r\n\r\nHe rose and made for the elevator. Five minutes later he was standing\r\nbefore his boss, the National Chairman, a worried, gray little man with\r\nan aldermanic paunch and a convict\'s mouth.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Williams?" snapped the Chairman.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to get expenses to Richmond," said Williams. "I have a friend\r\ndown there in Snobbcraft\'s office and he might have some dope we can\r\nuse to our advantage."\r\n\r\n"Scandal?" asked Mr. Gay, brightening.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know right now, of course, but this fellow is a very\r\nshrewd observer and in six months\' time he ought to have grabbed\r\nsomething that\'ll help us out of this jam."\r\n\r\n"Is he a Republican or a Democrat?"\r\n\r\n"Neither. He\'s a highly trained and competent social student. You\r\ncouldn\'t expect him to be either," Williams observed. "But I happen to\r\nknow that he hasn\'t got any money to speak of, so for a consideration\r\nI\'m sure he\'ll spill everything he knows, if anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, its a gamble," said Gay, doubtfully, "but any port in a storm."\r\n\r\nWilliams left Washington immediately for Richmond. That night he sat in\r\na cramped little room of the former champion of the darker races.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing down there, Beard?" asked Williams, referring to\r\nthe headquarters of the Anglo-Saxon Association.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m getting, or helping to get, that data of Buggerie\'s into\r\nshape."\r\n\r\n"What data? You told me you were doing research work. Now you say\r\nyou\'re arranging data. Have they finished collecting it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, we finished that job some time ago. Now we\'re trying to get the\r\nmaterial in shape for easy digestion."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean: easy digestion?" queried Williams. "What are you\r\nfellows trying to find out and why must it be so easily digested. You\r\nfellows usually try to make your stuff unintelligible to the herd."\r\n\r\n"This is different," said Beard, lowering his voice to almost a\r\nwhisper. "We\'re under a pledge of secrecy. We have been investigating\r\nthe family trees of the nation and so far, believe me, we certainly\r\nhave uncovered astounding facts. When I\'m finally discharged, which\r\nwill probably be after election, I\'m going to peddle some of that\r\ninformation. Snobbcraft and even Buggerie are not aware of the\r\ninflammatory character of the facts we\'ve assembled." He narrowed his\r\nfoxy eyes greedily.\r\n\r\n"Is it because they\'ve been planning to release some of it that they\r\nwant it in easily digestible form, as you say?" pressed Williams.\r\n\r\n"That\'s it exactly," declared Beard, stroking his now clean-shaven\r\nface. "I overheard Buggerie and Snobbcraft chuckling about it only a\r\nday or two ago."\r\n\r\n"Well, there must be a whole lot of it," insinuated Williams, "if\r\nthey\'ve had all of you fellows working for six months. Where all did\r\nyou work?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, all over. North as well as South. We\'ve got a whole basement vault\r\nfull of index cards."\r\n\r\n"I guess they\'re keeping close watch over it, aren\'t they?" asked\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\n"Sure. It would take an army to get in that vault."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess they don\'t want anything to happen to the stuff before\r\nthey spring it," observed the man from Republican headquarters.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward Williams left Dr. Beard, took a stroll around the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Association\'s stately headquarters building, noted the\r\nhalf-dozen tough looking guards about it and then caught the last train\r\nfor the capital city. The next morning he had a long talk with Gorman\r\nGay.\r\n\r\n"It\'s okeh, Jo," he whispered to Bonds, later, as he passed his desk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with you, Matt?" asked Bunny one morning about a\r\nmonth before election. "Ain\'t everything going okeh? You look as if\r\nwe\'d lost the election and failed to elect that brilliant intellectual,\r\nHenry Givens, President of the United States."\r\n\r\n"Well, we might just as well lose it as far as I\'m concerned," said\r\nMatthew, "if I don\'t find a way out of this jam I\'m in."\r\n\r\n"What jam?"\r\n\r\n"Well, Helen got in the family way last winter again. I sent her to\r\nPalm Beach and the other resorts, thinking the travel and exercise\r\nmight bring on another miscarriage."\r\n\r\n"Did it?"\r\n\r\n"Not a chance in the world. Then, to make matters worse, she\r\nmiscalculates. At first she thought she would be confined in December;\r\nnow she tells me she\'s only got about three weeks to go."\r\n\r\n"Say not so!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m preaching gospel."\r\n\r\n"Well, hush my mouth! Waddya gonna do? You can\'t send her to one o\'\r\nCrookman\'s hospitals, it would be too dangerous right now."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. You see, I figured she wouldn\'t be ready until about a\r\nmonth after election when everything had calmed down, and I could send\r\nher then."\r\n\r\n"Would she have gone?"\r\n\r\n"She couldn\'t afford not to with her old man the President of the\r\nUnited States."\r\n\r\n"Well, whaddya gonna do, Big Boy? Think fast! Think fast! Them three\r\nweeks will get away from here in no time."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I know it?"\r\n\r\n"What about an abortion?" suggested Bunny, hopefully.\r\n\r\n"Nothing doing. First place, she\'s too frail, and second place she\'s\r\ngot some fool idea about that being a sin."\r\n\r\n"About the only thing for you to do, then," said Bunny, "is to get\r\nready to pull out when that kid is born."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bunny, I\'d hate to leave Helen. She\'s really the only woman I ever\r\nloved, you know. Course she\'s got her prejudices and queer notions\r\nlike everybody else but she\'s really a little queen. She\'s been an\r\ninspiration to me, too, Bunny. Every time I talk about pulling out of\r\nthis game when things don\'t go just right, she makes me stick it out.\r\nI guess I\'d have been gone after I cleaned up that first million if it\r\nhadn\'t been for her."\r\n\r\n"You\'d have been better off if you had," Bunny commented.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. She\'s hot for me to become Secretary of State or\r\nAmbassador to England or something like that; and the way things are\r\ngoing it looks like I will be. That is, if I can get out of this fix."\r\n\r\n"If you can get out o\' this jam, Matt, I\'ll sure take my hat off to\r\nyou. An\' I know how you feel about scuttling out and leaving her. I had\r\na broad like that once in Harlem. \'Twas through her I got that job in\r\nth\' bank. She was crazy about me, Boy, until she caught me two-timin\'.\r\nThen she tried to shoot me.\r\n\r\n"Squaws are funny that way," Bunny continued, philosophically. "Since\r\nI\'ve been white I\'ve found out they\'re all the same, white or black.\r\nKipling was right. They\'ll fight to get you, fight to keep you and\r\nfight you when they catch you playin\' around. But th\' kinda woman that\r\nwon\'t fight for a man ain\'t worth havin\'."\r\n\r\n"So you think I ought to pull out, eh Bunny?" asked the worried\r\nMatthew, returning to the subject.\r\n\r\n"Well, what I\'d suggest is this:" his plump friend advised, "about time\r\nyou think Helen\'s gonna be confined, get together as much cash as you\r\ncan and keep your plane ready. Then, when the baby\'s born, go to her,\r\ntell her everything an\' offer to take her away with you. If she won\'t\r\ngo, you beat it; if she will, why everything\'s hotsy totsy." Bunny\r\nextended his soft pink hands expressively.\r\n\r\n"Well, that sounds pretty good, Bunny."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your best bet, Big Boy," said his friend and secretary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo days before election the situation was unchanged. There was joy in\r\nthe Democratic camp, gloom among the Republicans. For the first time\r\nin American history it seemed that money was not going to decide an\r\nelection. The propagandists and publicity men of the Democrats had so\r\nplayed upon the fears and prejudices of the public that even the bulk\r\nof Jews and Catholics were wavering and many had been won over to the\r\nsupport of a candidate who had denounced them but a few months before.\r\nIn this they were but running true to form, however, as they had\r\nusually been on the side of white supremacy in the old days when there\r\nwas a Negro population observable to the eye. The Republicans sought to\r\ndig up some scandal against Givens and Snobbcraft but were dissuaded\r\nby their Committee on Strategy which feared to set so dangerous a\r\nprecedent. There were also politicians in their ranks who were guilty\r\nof adulteries, drunkenness and grafting.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans, Goosie and Gump, and the Democrats, Givens and\r\nSnobbcraft, had ended their swings around the country and were resting\r\nfrom their labors. There were parades in every city and country town.\r\nMinor orators beat the lectern from the Atlantic to the Pacific\r\nextolling the imaginary virtues of the candidates of the party that\r\nhired them. Dr. Crookman was burned a hundred times in effigy. Several\r\nLying-In hospitals were attacked. Two hundred citizens who knew nothing\r\nabout either candidate were arrested for fighting over which was the\r\nbetter man.\r\n\r\nThe air was electric with expectancy. People stood around in knots.\r\nSmall boys scattered leaflets on ten million doorsteps. Police were on\r\nthe alert to suppress disorder, except what they created.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArthur Snobbcraft, jovial and confident that he would soon assume a\r\nposition befitting a member of one of the First Families of Virginia,\r\nwas holding a brilliant pre-election party in his palatial residence.\r\nStrolling in and out amongst his guests, the master of the house\r\naccepted their premature congratulations in good humor. It was fine to\r\nhear oneself already addressed as Mr. Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe tall English butler hastily edged his way through the throng\r\nsurrounding the President of the Anglo-Saxon Association and whispered,\r\n"Dr. Buggerie is in the study upstairs. He says he must see you at\r\nonce; that it is very, very important."\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Snobbcraft went up to find out what in the world could be the\r\ntrouble. As he entered, the massive statistician was striding back and\r\nforth, mopping his brow, his eyes starting from his head, a sheaf of\r\ntypewritten sheets trembling in his hand.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, Buggerie?" asked Snobbcraft, perturbed.\r\n\r\n"Everything! Everything!" shrilled the statistician.\r\n\r\n"Be specific, please."\r\n\r\n"Well," shaking the sheaf of papers in Snobbcraft\'s face, "we can\'t\r\nrelease any of this stuff! It\'s too damaging! It\'s too inclusive! We\'ll\r\nhave to suppress it, Snobbcraft. You hear me? We musn\'t let anyone get\r\nhold of it." The big man\'s flabby jowls worked excitedly.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" snarled the F. F. V. "Do you mean to tell me that\r\nall of that money and work is wasted?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what I mean," squeaked Buggerie. "It would be suicidal\r\nto publish it."\r\n\r\n"Why? Get down to brass tacks, man, for God\'s sake. You get my goat."\r\n\r\n"Now listen here, Snobbcraft," replied the statistician soberly,\r\ndropping heavily into a chair. "Sit down and listen to me. I started\r\nthis investigation on the theory that the data gathered would prove\r\nthat around twenty million people, mostly of the lower classes were of\r\nNegro ancestry, recent and remote, while about half that number would\r\nbe of uncertain or unknown ancestry."\r\n\r\n"Well, what have you found?" insisted Snobbcraft, impatiently.\r\n\r\n"I have found," continued Buggerie, "that over half the population has\r\nno record of its ancestry beyond five generations!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s fine!" chortled Snobbcraft. "I\'ve always maintained that there\r\nwere only a few people of good blood in this country."\r\n\r\n"But those figures include all classes," protested the larger man.\r\n"Your class as well as the lower classes."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t insult me, Buggerie!" shouted the head of the Anglo-Saxons, half\r\nrising from his seat on the sofa.\r\n\r\n"Be calm! Be calm!" cried Buggerie excitedly, "You haven\'t heard\r\nanything yet."\r\n\r\n"What else, in the name of God, could be a worse libel on the\r\naristocracy of this state?" Snobbcraft mopped his dark and haughty\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"Well, these statistics we\'ve gathered prove that most of our social\r\nleaders, especially of Anglo-Saxon lineage, are descendants of colonial\r\nstock that came here in bondage. They associated with slaves, in many\r\ncases worked and slept with them. They intermixed with the blacks and\r\nthe women were sexually exploited by their masters. Then, even more\r\nthan today, the illegitimate birth rate was very high in America."\r\n\r\nSnobbcraft\'s face was working with suppressed rage. He started to rise\r\nbut reconsidered. "Go on," he commanded.\r\n\r\n"There was so much of this mixing between whites and blacks of the\r\nvarious classes that very early the colonies took steps to put a halt\r\nto it. They managed to prevent intermarriage but they couldn\'t stop\r\nintermixture. You know the old records don\'t lie. They\'re right there\r\nfor everybody to see....\r\n\r\n"A certain percentage of these Negroes," continued Buggerie, quite at\r\nease now and seemingly enjoying his dissertation, "in time lightened\r\nsufficiently to be able to pass for white. They then merged with the\r\ngeneral population. Assuming that there were one thousand such cases\r\nfifteen generations ago--and we have proof that there were more--their\r\ndescendants now number close to fifty million souls. Now I maintain\r\nthat we dare not risk publishing this information. Too many of our very\r\nfirst families are touched right here in Richmond!"\r\n\r\n"Buggerie!" gasped the F. F. V., "Are you mad?"\r\n\r\n"Quite sane, sir," squeaked the ponderous man, somewhat proudly, "and I\r\nknow what I know." He winked a watery eye.\r\n\r\n"Well, go on. Is there any more?"\r\n\r\n"Plenty," proceeded the statistician, amiably. "Take your own family,\r\nfor instance. (Now don\'t get mad, Snobbcraft). Take your own family. It\r\nis true that your people descended from King Alfred, but he has scores,\r\nperhaps hundreds of thousands of descendants. Some are, of course,\r\nhonored and respected citizens, cultured aristocrats who are a credit\r\nto the country; but most of them, my dear, dear Snobbcraft, are in what\r\nyou call the lower orders: that is to say, laboring people, convicts,\r\nprostitutes, and that sort. One of your maternal ancestors in the late\r\nseventeenth century was the offspring of an English serving maid and a\r\nblack slave. This woman in turn had a daughter by the plantation owner.\r\nThis daughter was married to a former indentured slave. Their children\r\nwere all white and you are one of their direct descendants!" Buggerie\r\nbeamed.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" shouted Snobbcraft, the veins standing out on his narrow\r\nforehead and his voice trembling with rage. "You can\'t sit there and\r\ninsult my family that way, suh."\r\n\r\n"Now that outburst just goes to prove my earlier assertion," the large\r\nman continued, blandly. "If you get so excited about the truth, what do\r\nyou think will be the reaction of other people? There\'s no use getting\r\nangry at me. I\'m not responsible for your ancestry! Nor, for that\r\nmatter, are you. You\'re no worse off than I am, Snobbcraft. My great,\r\ngreat grandfather had his ears cropped for non-payment of debts and\r\nwas later jailed for thievery. His illegitimate daughter married a free\r\nNegro who fought in the Revolutionary War." Buggerie wagged his head\r\nalmost gleefully.\r\n\r\n"How can you admit it?" asked the scandalized Snobbcraft.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" demanded Buggerie. "I have plenty of company. There\'s\r\nGivens, who is quite a fanatic on the race question and white\r\nsupremacy, and yet he\'s only four generations removed from a mulatto\r\nancestor."\r\n\r\n"Givens too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and also the proud Senator Kretin. He boasts, you know, of being\r\ndescended from Pocahontas and Captain John Smith, but so are thousands\r\nof Negroes. Incidentally, there hasn\'t been an Indian unmixed with\r\nNegro on the Atlantic coastal plain for over a century and a half."\r\n\r\n"What about Matthew Fisher?"\r\n\r\n"We can find no record whatever of Fisher, which is true of about\r\ntwenty million others, and so," he lowered his voice dramatically, "I\r\nhave reason to suspect that he is one of those Negroes who have been\r\nwhitened."\r\n\r\n"And to think that I entertained him in my home!" Snobbcraft muttered\r\nto himself. And then aloud: "Well, what are we to do about it?"\r\n\r\n"We must destroy the whole shooting match," the big man announced as\r\nemphatically as possible for one with a soprano voice, "and we\'d\r\nbetter do it at once. The sooner we get through with it the better."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t leave my guests," protested Snobbcraft. Then turning\r\nangrily upon his friend, he growled, "Why in the devil didn\'t you find\r\nall of this out before?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Buggerie, meekly, "I found out as soon as I could. We had\r\nto arrange and correlate the data, you know."\r\n\r\n"How do you imagine we\'re going to get rid of that mountain of paper at\r\nthis hour?" asked Snobbcraft, as they started down stairs.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get the guards to help us," said Buggerie, hopefully. "And we\'ll\r\nhave the cards burned in the furnace."\r\n\r\n"All right, then," snapped the F. F. V., "let\'s go and get it over\r\nwith."\r\n\r\nIn five minutes they were speeding down the broad avenue to the\r\nheadquarters of the Anglo-Saxon Association of America. They parked the\r\ncar in front of the gate and walked up the cinder road to the front\r\ndoor. It was a balmy, moonlight night, almost as bright as day. They\r\nlooked around but saw no one.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any of the guards around," Snobbcraft remarked, craning\r\nhis neck. "I wonder where they are?"\r\n\r\n"Probably they\'re inside," Buggerie suggested, "although I remember\r\ntelling them to patrol the outside of the building."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll go in, anyhow," remarked Snobbcraft. "Maybe they\'re down\r\nstairs."\r\n\r\nHe unlocked the door, swung it open and they entered. The hall was\r\npitch dark. Both men felt along the wall for the button for the light.\r\nSuddenly there was a thud and Snobbcraft cursed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" wailed the frightened Buggerie, frantically\r\nfeeling for a match.\r\n\r\n"Turn on that God damned light!" roared Snobbcraft. "I just stumbled\r\nover a man.... Hurry up, will you?"\r\n\r\nDr. Buggerie finally found a match, struck it, located the wall button\r\nand pressed it. The hall was flooded with light. There arranged in a\r\nrow on the floor and neatly trussed up and gagged were the six special\r\nguards.\r\n\r\n"What the hell does this mean?" yelled Snobbcraft at the mute men prone\r\nbefore them. Buggerie quickly removed the gags.\r\n\r\nThey had been suddenly set upon, the head watchman explained, about an\r\nhour before, just after Dr. Buggerie left, by a crowd of gunmen who\r\nhad blackjacked them into unconsciousness and carried them into the\r\nbuilding. The watchman displayed the lumps on their heads as evidence\r\nand looked quite aggrieved. Not one of them could remember what\r\ntranspired after the sleep-producing buffet.\r\n\r\n"The vault!" shrilled Buggerie. "Let\'s have a look at the vault."\r\n\r\nDown the stairs they rushed, Buggerie wheezing in the lead, Snobbcraft\r\nfollowing and the six tousled watchmen bringing up the rear. The lights\r\nin the basement were still burning brightly. The doors of the vault\r\nwere open, sagging on their hinges. There was a litter of trash in\r\nfront of the vault. They all clustered around the opening and peered\r\ninside. The vault was absolutely empty.\r\n\r\n"My God!" exclaimed Snobbcraft and Buggerie in unison, turning two\r\nshades paler.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two they just gazed at each other. Then suddenly\r\nBuggerie smiled.\r\n\r\n"That stuff won\'t do them any good," he remarked triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" demanded Snobbcraft, in his tone a mixture of eagerness,\r\nhope and doubt.\r\n\r\n"Well, it will take them as long to get anything out of that mass\r\nof cards as it took our staff, and by that time you and Givens\r\nwill be elected and no one will dare publish anything like that,"\r\nthe statistician explained. "I have in my possession the only\r\nsummary--those papers I showed you at your house. As long as I\'ve got\r\nthat document and they haven\'t, we\'re all right!" he grinned in obese\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n"That sounds good," sighed Snobbcraft, contentedly. "By the way, where\r\nis that summary?"\r\n\r\nBuggerie jumped as if stuck by a pin and looked first into his empty\r\nhands, then into his coat pockets and finally his trousers pockets.\r\nHe turned and dashed out to the car, followed by the grim-looking\r\nSnobbcraft and the six uniformed watchmen with their tousled hair and\r\nsore bumps. They searched the car in vain, Snobbcraft loudly cursing\r\nBuggerie\'s stupidity.\r\n\r\n"I--I must have left it in your study," wept Buggerie, meekly and\r\nhopefully. "In fact I think I remember leaving it right there on the\r\ntable."\r\n\r\nThe enraged Snobbcraft ordered him into the car and they drove off\r\nleaving the six uniformed watchmen gaping at the entrance to the\r\ngrounds, the moonbeams playing through their tousled hair.\r\n\r\nThe two men hit the ground almost as soon as the car crunched to\r\na stop, dashed up the steps, into the house, through the crowd of\r\nbewildered guests, up the winding colonial stairs, down the hallway and\r\ninto the study.\r\n\r\nBuggerie switched on the light and looked wildly, hopefully around.\r\nSimultaneously the two men made a grab for a sheaf of white paper lying\r\non the sofa. The statistician reached it first and gazed hungrily,\r\ngratefully at it. Then his eyes started from his head and his hand\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n"Look!" he shrieked dolefully, thrusting the sheaf of paper under\r\nSnobbcraft\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nAll of the sheets were blank except the one on top. On that was\r\nscribbled:\r\n\r\n    Thanks very much for leaving that report where I could get hold of\r\n    it. Am leaving this paper so you\'ll have something on which to\r\n    write another summary.\r\n\r\n                                              Happy dreams, Little One.\r\n                                                               G. O. P.\r\n\r\n"Great God!" gasped Snobbcraft, sinking into a chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon before election Matthew and Bunny sat in the latter\'s\r\nhotel suite sipping cocktails, smoking and awaiting the inevitable.\r\nThey had been waiting ever since the day before. Matthew, tall and\r\ntense; Bunny, rotund and apprehensive, trying ever so often to cheer\r\nup his chief with poor attempts at jocosity. Every time they heard\r\na bell ring both jumped for the telephone, thinking it might be an\r\nannouncement from Helen\'s bedside that an heir, and a dark one, had\r\nbeen born. When they could no longer stay around the office, they had\r\ncome down to the hotel. In just a few moments they were planning to go\r\nback to the office again.\r\n\r\nThe hard campaign and the worry over the outcome of Helen\'s confinement\r\nhad left traces on Matthew\'s face. The satanic lines were accentuated,\r\nthe eyes seemed sunken farther back in the head, his well-manicured\r\nhand trembled a little as he reached for his glass again and again.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how it would all come out. He hated to leave. He had\r\nhad such a good time since he\'d been white: plenty of money, almost\r\nunlimited power, a beautiful wife, good liquor and the pick of damsels\r\nwithin reach. Must he leave all that? Must he cut and run just at the\r\ntime when he was about to score his greatest victory? Just think: from\r\nan underpaid insurance agent to a millionaire commanding millions of\r\npeople--and then oblivion. He shuddered slightly and reached again for\r\nhis glass.\r\n\r\n"I got everything fixed," Bunny remarked, shifting around in the\r\noverstuffed chair. "The plane\'s all ready with tanks full and I\'ve got\r\nRuggles right there in the hangar. The money\'s in that little steel\r\nbox: all in thousand dollar bills."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going with me, aren\'t you, Bunny?" asked Matthew in almost\r\npleading tones.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not stayin\' here!" his secretary replied.\r\n\r\n"Gee, Bunny, you\'re a brick!" said Matthew leaning over and placing his\r\nhand on his plump little friend\'s knee. "You sure have been a good pal."\r\n\r\n"Aw, cut th\' comedy," exclaimed Bunny, reddening and turning his head\r\nswiftly away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the telephone rang, loud, clear, staccato. Both men sprang for\r\nit, eagerly, open-eyed, apprehensive. Matthew was first.\r\n\r\n"Hello!" he shouted. "What\'s that! Yes, I\'ll be right up."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s happened," he announced resignedly, hanging up the\r\nreceiver. And then, brightening a bit, he boasted, "It\'s a boy!"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her pain Helen was jubilant. What a present to give her\r\nMatthew on the eve of his greatest triumph! How good the Lord was to\r\nher; to doubly bless her in this way. The nurse wiped the tears of joy\r\naway from the young mother\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"You must stay quiet, Ma\'am," she warned.\r\n\r\nOutside in the hall, squirming uneasily on the window seat, was\r\nMatthew, his fists clenched, his teeth biting into his thin lower lip.\r\nAt another window stood Bunny looking vacantly out into the street,\r\nfeeling useless and out of place in such a situation, and yet convinced\r\nthat it was his duty to stay here by his best friend during this great\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\nMatthew felt like a young soldier about to leave his trench to face a\r\nbaptism of machine gun fire or a gambler risking his last dollar on a\r\nroll of the dice. It seemed to him that he would go mad if something\r\ndidn\'t happen quickly. He rose and paced the hall, hands in pockets,\r\nhis tall shadow following him on the opposite wall. Why didn\'t the\r\ndoctor come out and tell him something? What was the cause of the\r\ndelay? What would Helen say? What would the baby look like? Maybe it\r\nmight be miraculously light! Stranger things had happened in this\r\nworld. But no, nothing like that could happen. Well, he\'d had his lucky\r\nbreak; now the vacation was over.\r\n\r\nA nurse, immaculate in white uniform, came out of Helen\'s bedroom,\r\npassed them hurriedly, smiling, and entered the bathroom. She returned\r\nwith a basin of warm water in her hands, smiled again reassuringly\r\nand re\xc3\xabntered the natal chamber. Bunny and Matthew, in unison, sighed\r\nheavily.\r\n\r\n"Boy!" exclaimed Bunny, wiping the perspiration from his brow. "If\r\nsomethin\' don\'t happen pretty soon, here, I\'m gonna do a Brodie out o\'\r\nthat window."\r\n\r\n"The both of us," said Matthew. "I never knew it took these doctors so\r\ndamn long to get through."\r\n\r\nHelen\'s door opened and the physician came out looking quite grave and\r\nconcerned. Matthew pounced upon him. The man held his finger to his\r\nlips and motioned to the room across the hall. Matthew entered.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Matthew, guiltily, "what\'s the news?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry to have to tell you, Mr. Fisher, that something\r\nterrible has happened. Your son is very, very dark. Either you or Mrs.\r\nFisher must possess some Negro blood. It might be called reversion to\r\ntype if any such thing had ever been proved. Now I want to know what\r\nyou want done. If you say so I can get rid of this child and it will\r\nsave everybody concerned a lot of trouble and disgrace. Nobody except\r\nthe nurse knows anything about this and she\'ll keep her mouth shut for\r\na consideration. Of course, it\'s all in the day\'s work for me, you\r\nknow. I\'ve had plenty of cases like this in Atlanta, even before the\r\ndisappearance of the Negroes. Come now, what shall I do?" he wailed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," thought Matthew to himself, "what should he do?" The doctor\r\nhad suggested an excellent way out of the dilemma. They could just\r\nsay that the child had died. But what of the future? Must he go on\r\nforever in this way? Helen was young and fecund. Surely one couldn\'t\r\ngo on murdering one\'s children, especially when one loved and wanted\r\nchildren. Wouldn\'t it be better to settle the matter once and for all?\r\nOr should he let the doctor murder the boy and then hope for a better\r\nsituation the next time? An angel of frankness beckoned him to be done\r\nwith this life of pretense; to take his wife and son and flee far away\r\nfrom everything, but a devil of ambition whispered seductively about\r\nwealth, power and prestige.\r\n\r\nIn almost as many seconds the pageant of the past three years passed in\r\nreview on the screen of his tortured memory: the New Year\'s Eve at the\r\nHonky Tonk Club, the first glimpse of the marvelously beautiful Helen,\r\nthe ordeal of getting white, the first, sweet days of freedom from the\r\npetty insults and cheap discriminations to which as a black man he had\r\nalways been subjected, then the search for Helen around Atlanta, the\r\norganization of the Knights of Nordica, the stream of successes, the\r\ncoming of Bunny, the campaign planned and executed by him: and now, the\r\nend. Must it be the end?\r\n\r\n"Well?" came the insistent voice of the physician.\r\n\r\nMatthew opened his mouth to reply when the butler burst into the room\r\nwaving a newspaper.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, sir," he blurted, excitedly, "but Mister Brown said to\r\nbring this right to you."\r\n\r\nThe lurid headlines seemed to leap from the paper and strike Matthew\r\nbetween the eyes:\r\n\r\n                     DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PROVED OF\r\n                             NEGRO DESCENT\r\n\r\n            Givens, Snobbcraft, Buggerie, Kretin and Others\r\n                  of Negro Ancestry, According to Old\r\n                      Records Unearthed by Them.\r\n\r\nMatthew and the physician, standing side by side, read the long account\r\nin awed silence. Bunny entered the door.\r\n\r\n"Can I speak to you a minute, Matt?" he asked casually. Almost\r\nreluctant to move, Matthew followed him into the hall.\r\n\r\n"Keep your shirt on, Big Boy," Bunny advised, almost jovially. "They\r\nain\'t got nothin\' on you yet. That changing your name threw them off.\r\nYou\'re not even mentioned."\r\n\r\nMatthew braced up, threw back his shoulders and drew a long, deep\r\nbreath. It seemed as if a mountain had been taken off his shoulders.\r\nHe actually grinned as his confidence returned. He reached for Bunny\'s\r\nhand and they shook, silently jubilant.\r\n\r\n"Well, doctor," said Matthew, arching his left eyebrow in his familiar\r\nMephistophelian manner, "it sort of looks as if there is something to\r\nthat reversion to type business. I used to think it was all boloney\r\nmyself. Well, it\'s as I always say: you never can tell."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it seems as if this is a very authentic case," agreed the\r\nphysician, glancing sharply at the bland and blond countenance of\r\nMatthew. "Well, what now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have to see Givens," said Matthew as they turned to leave the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Here he comes now," Bunny announced.\r\n\r\nSure enough, the little gray-faced, bald-headed man, came leaping up\r\nthe stairs like a goat, his face haggard, his eyes bulging in mingled\r\nrage and terror, his necktie askew. He was waving a newspaper in his\r\nhand and opened his mouth without speaking as he shot past them and\r\ndashed into Helen\'s room. The old fellow was evidently out of his head.\r\n\r\nThey followed him into the room in time to see him with his face buried\r\nin the covers of Helen\'s bed and she, horrified, glancing at the\r\nsix-inch-tall headline. Matthew rushed to her side as she slumped back\r\non the pillow in a dead faint. The physician and nurse dashed to revive\r\nher. The old man on his knees sobbed hoarsely. Mrs. Givens looking\r\nfifteen years older appeared in the doorway. Bunny glanced at Matthew\r\nwho slightly lowered his left eyelid and with difficulty suppressed a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got to get out o\' this!" shouted the Imperial Grand Wizard.\r\n"We\'ve got to get out o\' this. Oh, it\'s terrible.... I never knew it\r\nmyself, for sure.... Oh, Matthew, get us out of this, I tell you. They\r\nalmost mobbed me at the office.... Came in just as I went out the back\r\nway.... Almost ten thousand of them.... We can\'t lose a minute. Quick,\r\nI tell you! They\'ll murder us all."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll look out for everything," Matthew soothed condescendingly. "I\'ll\r\nstick by you." Then turning swiftly to his partner he commanded, "Bunny\r\norder both cars out at once. We\'ll beat it for the airport.... Doctor\r\nBrocker, will you go with us to look out for Helen and the baby? We\'ve\r\ngot to get out right now. I\'ll pay you your price."\r\n\r\n"Sure I\'ll go, Mr. Fisher," said the physician, quietly. "I wouldn\'t\r\nleave Mrs. Fisher now."\r\n\r\nThe nurse had succeeded in bringing Helen to consciousness. She was\r\nweeping bitterly, denouncing fate and her father. With that logicality\r\nthat frequently causes people to accept as truth circumstantial\r\nevidence that is not necessarily conclusive, she was assuming that\r\nthe suspiciously brown color of her new-born son was due to some\r\nhidden Negro drop of blood in her veins. She looked up at her husband\r\nbeseechingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Matthew, darling," she cried, her long red-gold hair framing\r\nher face, "I\'m so sorry about all this. If I\'d only known, I\'d never\r\nhave let you in for it. I would have spared you this disgrace and\r\nhumiliation. Oh, Matthew, Honey, please forgive me. I love you, my\r\nhusband. Please don\'t leave me, please don\'t leave me!" She reached out\r\nand grasped the tail of his coat as if he were going to leave that very\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n"Now, now, little girl," said Matthew soothingly, touched by her words,\r\n"You haven\'t disgraced me; you\'ve honored me by presenting me with a\r\nbeautiful son."\r\n\r\nHe looked down worshipfully at the chubby, ball of brownness in the\r\nnurse\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t worry about me, Helen. I\'ll stick by you as long as you\'ll\r\nhave me and without you life wouldn\'t be worth a dime. You\'re not\r\nresponsible for the color of our baby, my dear. I\'m the guilty one."\r\n\r\nDr. Brocker smiled knowingly, Givens rose up indignantly, Bunny opened\r\nhis mouth in surprise, Mrs. Givens folded her arms and her mouth\r\nchanged to a slit and the nurse said "Oh!"\r\n\r\n"You?" cried Helen in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, me," Matthew repeated, a great load lifting from his soul. Then\r\nfor a few minutes he poured out his secret to the astonished little\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nHelen felt a wave of relief go over her. There was no feeling of\r\nrevulsion at the thought that her husband was a Negro. There once\r\nwould have been but that was seemingly centuries ago when she had been\r\nunaware of her remoter Negro ancestry. She felt proud of her Matthew.\r\nShe loved him more than ever. They had money and a beautiful, brown\r\nbaby. What more did they need? To hell with the world! To hell with\r\nsociety! Compared to what she possessed, thought Helen, all talk\r\nof race and color was damned foolishness. She would probably have\r\nbeen surprised to learn that countless Americans at that moment were\r\nthinking the same thing.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bunny, grinning, "it sure is good to be able to admit that\r\nyou\'re a jigwalk once more."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Bunny," said old man Givens, "I guess we\'re all niggers now."\r\n\r\n"Negroes, Mr. Givens, Negroes," corrected Dr. Brocker, entering\r\nthe room. "I\'m in the same boat with the rest of you, only my dark\r\nancestors are not so far back. I sure hope the Republicans win."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, Doc," said Bunny. "They\'ll win all right. And how! Gee\r\nwhiz! I bet Sherlock Holmes, Nick Carter and all the Pinkertons\r\ncouldn\'t find old Senator Kretin and Arthur Snobbcraft now."\r\n\r\n"Come on," shouted the apprehensive Givens, "let\'s get out o\' here\r\nbefore that mob comes."\r\n\r\n"Whut mob, Daddy?" asked Mrs. Givens.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find out damn quick if you don\'t shake it up," replied her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the crisp, autumn night air sped Fisher\'s big tri-motored\r\nplane, headed southwest to the safety of Mexico. Reclining in a large,\r\ncomfortable deck chair was Helen Fisher, calm and at peace with the\r\nworld. In a hammock near her was her little brown son, Matthew, Junior.\r\nBeside her, holding her hand, was Matthew. Up front near the pilot,\r\nBunny and Givens were playing Conquian. Behind them sat the nurse and\r\nDr. Brocker, silently gazing out of the window at the twinkling lights\r\nof the Gulf Coast. Old lady Givens snored in the rear of the ship.\r\n\r\n"Damn!" muttered Givens, as Bunny threw down his last spread and won\r\nthe third consecutive game. "I sure wish I\'d had time to grab some\r\njack before we pulled out o\' Atlanta. Ain\'t got but five dollars and\r\nfifty-three cents to my name."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry about that, Old Timer," Bunny laughed. "I don\'t think we\r\nleft over a thousand bucks in the treasury. See that steel box over\r\nthere? Well, that ain\'t got nothin\' in it but bucks and more bucks.\r\nNot a bill smaller than a grand."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m a son-of-a-gun," blurted the Imperial Grand Wizard. "That\r\nboy thinks o\' everything."\r\n\r\nBut Givens was greatly depressed, much more so than the others. He had\r\nreally believed all that he had preached about white supremacy, race\r\npurity and the menace of the alien, the Catholic, the Modernist and the\r\nJew. He had always been sincere in his prejudices.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the Valbuena Air Field outside Mexico City, a\r\nmessenger brought Bunny a telegram.\r\n\r\n"You better thank your stars you got away from there, Matt," he\r\ngrinned, handing his friend the telegram. "See what my gal says?"\r\n\r\nMatthew glanced over the message and handed it to Givens without\r\ncomment. It read:\r\n\r\n    _Hope you arrive safely Senator Kretin lynched in Union Station\r\n    Stop Snobbcraft and Buggerie reported in flight Stop Goosie and\r\n    Gump almost unanimously re\xc3\xablected Stop Government has declared\r\n    martial law until disturbances stop Stop When can I come?_\r\n\r\n                                                     MADELINE SCRANTON.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s this Scranton broad?" queried Matthew in a whisper, cutting a\r\nprecautionary glance at his wife.\r\n\r\n"A sweet Georgia brown," exclaimed Bunny enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"No!" gasped Matthew, incredulous.\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t no Caucasian!" Bunny replied.\r\n\r\n"She must be the last black gal in the country," Matthew remarked,\r\nglancing enviously at his friend. "How come she didn\'t get white, too?"\r\n\r\n"Well," Bunny replied, a slight hint of pride in his voice. "She\'s a\r\nrace patriot. She\'s funny that way."\r\n\r\n"Well, for cryin\' out loud!" exclaimed Matthew, scratching his head and\r\nsort of half grinning in a bewildered way. "_What_ kind o\' _sheba_ is\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nOld man Givens came over to where they were standing, the telegram in\r\nhis hand and an expression of serenity now on his face.\r\n\r\n"Boys," he announced, "it looks like it\'s healthier down here right now\r\nthan it is back there in Georgia."\r\n\r\n"_Looks_ like it\'s healthier?" mocked Bunny. "Brother, you know damn\r\n_well_ it\'s healthier!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nToward eleven o\'clock on the evening before election day, a long, low\r\nroadster swept up to the door of a stately country home near Richmond,\r\nVa., crunched to a stop, the lights were extinguished and two men, one\r\ntall and angular, the other huge and stout, catapulted from the car.\r\nWithout wasting words, they raced around the house and down a small\r\ndriveway to a rambling shed in a level field about three hundred yards\r\nto the rear. Breathless, they halted before the door and beat upon it\r\nexcitedly.\r\n\r\n"Open up there, Frazier!" ordered Snobbcraft, for it was he. "Open that\r\ndoor." There was no answer. The only reply was the chirping of crickets\r\nand the rustle of branches.\r\n\r\n"He must not be here," said Dr. Buggerie, glancing fearfully over his\r\nshoulder and wiping a perspiring brow with a damp handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"The damned rascal had better be here," thundered the Democratic\r\ncandidate for Vice-President, beating again on the door. "I telephoned\r\nhim two hours ago to be ready."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke someone unlocked the door and rolled it aside an inch or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n"Is that you, Mr. Snobbcraft?" asked a sleepy voice from the darkness\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n"Open that damned door, you fool," barked Snobbcraft. "Didn\'t I tell\r\nyou to have that plane ready when we got here? Why don\'t you do\r\nas you\'re told?" He and Dr. Buggerie helped slide the great doors\r\nback. The man Frazier snapped on the lights, revealing within a big,\r\nthree-motored plane with an automobile nestling under each of its wings.\r\n\r\n"I-I kinda fell asleep waitin\' for you, Mr. Snobbcraft," Frazier\r\napologized, "but everything\'s ready."\r\n\r\n"All right, man," shouted the president of the Anglo-Saxon Association,\r\n"let\'s get away from here then. This is a matter of life and death. You\r\nought to have had the plane outside and all warmed up to go."\r\n\r\n"Yes sir," the man mumbled meekly, busying himself.\r\n\r\n"These damned, stupid, poor white trash!" growled Snobbcraft, glaring\r\nbalefully at the departing aviator.\r\n\r\n"D-D-Don\'t antagonize him," muttered Buggerie. "He\'s our only chance to\r\nget away."\r\n\r\n"Shut up, fool! If it hadn\'t been for you and your damned fool\r\nstatistics we wouldn\'t be in this fix."\r\n\r\n"You wanted them, didn\'t you?" whined the statistician in defense.\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t tell you to leave that damned summary where anybody\r\ncould get hold of it." Snobbcraft replied, reproachfully. "That was the\r\nmost stupid thing I ever heard of."\r\n\r\nBuggerie opened his mouth to reply but said nothing. He just glared at\r\nSnobbcraft who glared back at him. The two men presented a disheveled\r\nappearance. The Vice-Presidential candidate was haggard, hatless,\r\ncollarless and still wore his smoking jacket. The eminent statistician\r\nand author of _The Incidence of Psittacosis among the Hiphopa Indians\r\nof the Amazon Valley and Its Relation to Life Insurance Rates in the\r\nUnited States_, looked far from dignified with no necktie, canvas\r\nbreeches, no socks and wearing a shooting jacket he had snatched from\r\na closet on his way out of the house. He had forgotten his thick\r\nspectacles and his bulging eyes were red and watery. They paced\r\nimpatiently back and forth, glancing first at the swiftly working\r\nFrazier and then down the long driveway toward the glowing city.\r\n\r\nTen minutes they waited while Frazier went over the plane to see that\r\nall was well. Then they helped him roll the huge metal bird out of the\r\nhangar and on to the field. Gratefully they climbed inside and fell\r\nexhausted on the soft-cushioned seats.\r\n\r\n"Well, that sure is a relief," gasped the ponderous Buggerie, mopping\r\nhis brow.\r\n\r\n"Wait until we get in the air," growled Snobbcraft. "Anything\'s liable\r\nto happen after that mob tonight. I was never so humiliated in my life.\r\nThe idea of that gang of poor white trash crowding up my steps and\r\nyelling nigger. It was disgraceful."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was terrible," agreed Buggerie. "It\'s a good thing they didn\'t\r\ngo in the rear where your car was. We wouldn\'t have been able to get\r\naway."\r\n\r\n"I thought there would be a demonstration," said Snobbcraft, some\r\nof his old sureness returning, "that\'s why I \'phoned Frazier to get\r\nready.... Oh, it\'s a damned shame to be run out of your own home in\r\nthis way!"\r\n\r\nHe glared balefully at the statistician who averted his gaze.\r\n\r\n"All ready, sir," announced Frazier, "where are we headed?"\r\n\r\n"To my ranch in Chihuahua, and hurry up," snapped Snobbcraft.\r\n\r\n"But--But we ain\'t got enough gas to go that far," said Frazier.\r\n"I-I-You didn\'t say you wanted to go to Mexico, Boss."\r\n\r\nSnobbcraft stared incredulously at the man. His rage was so great\r\nthat he could not speak for a moment or two. Then he launched into a\r\nstream of curses that would have delighted a pirate captain, while the\r\nunfortunate aviator gaped indecisively.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this diatribe, the sound of automobile horns and\r\nklaxons rent the air, punctuated by shouts and pistol shots. The three\r\nmen in the plane saw coming down the road from the city a bobbing\r\nstream of headlights. Already the cavalcade was almost to the gate of\r\nthe Snobbcraft country estate.\r\n\r\n"Come on, get out of here," gasped Snobbcraft. "We\'ll get some gas\r\nfarther down the line. Hurry up!"\r\n\r\nDr. Buggerie, speechless and purple with fear, pushed the aviator out\r\nof the plane. The fellow gave the propeller a whirl, jumped back into\r\nthe cabin, took the controls and the great machine rolled out across\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nThey had started none too soon. The automobile cavalcade was already\r\ncoming up the driveway. The drone of the motor drowned out the sound of\r\nthe approaching mob but the two fearful men saw several flashes that\r\nbetokened pistol shots. Several of the automobiles took out across the\r\nfield in the wake of the plane. They seemed to gain on it. Snobbcraft\r\nand Buggerie gazed nervously ahead. They were almost at the end of\r\nthe field and the plane had not yet taken to the air. The pursuing\r\nautomobiles drew closer. There were several more flashes from firearms.\r\nA bullet tore through the side of the cabin. Simultaneously Snobbcraft\r\nand Buggerie fell to the floor.\r\n\r\nAt last the ship rose, cleared the trees at the end of the field and\r\nbegan to attain altitude. The two men took deep breaths of relief, rose\r\nand flung themselves on the richly upholstered seats.\r\n\r\nA terrible stench suddenly became noticeable to the two passengers\r\nand the aviator. The latter looked inquiringly over his shoulder;\r\nSnobbcraft and Buggerie, their noses wrinkled and their foreheads\r\ncorrugated, glanced suspiciously at each other. Both moved uneasily\r\nin their seats and looks of guilt succeeded those of accusation.\r\nSnobbcraft retreated precipitously to the rear cabin while the\r\nstatistician flung open several windows and then followed the\r\nVice-Presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later two bundles were tossed out of the window of the\r\nrear cabin and the two passengers, looking sheepish but much relieved,\r\nresumed their seats. Snobbcraft was wearing a suit of brown dungarees\r\nbelonging to Frazier while his scientific friend had wedged himself\r\ninto a pair of white trousers usually worn by Snobbcraft\'s valet.\r\nFrazier turned, saw them, and grinned.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the plane winged its way through the night. Going a\r\nhundred miles an hour it passed town after town. About dawn, as they\r\nwere passing over Meridian, Mississippi, the motor began to miss.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter there?" Snobbcraft inquired nervously into the\r\npilot\'s ear.\r\n\r\n"The gas is runnin\' low," Frazier replied grimly. "We\'ll have to land\r\npretty soon."\r\n\r\n"No, no, not in Mississippi!" gasped Buggerie, growing purple with\r\napprehension. "They\'ll lynch us if they find out who we are."\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t stay up here much longer," the pilot warned.\r\n\r\nSnobbcraft bit his lip and thought furiously. It was true they would\r\nbe taking a chance by landing anywhere in the South, let alone in\r\nMississippi, but what could they do? The motor was missing more\r\nfrequently and Frazier had cut down their speed to save gasoline. They\r\nwere just idling along. The pilot looked back at Snobbcraft inquiringly.\r\n\r\n"By God, we\'re in a fix now," said the president of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nAssociation. Then he brightened with a sudden idea. "We could hide in\r\nthe rear cabin while Frazier gets gasoline," he suggested.\r\n\r\n"Suppose somebody looks in the rear cabin?" queried Buggerie,\r\ndolefully, thrusting his hands into the pockets of his white trousers.\r\n"There\'s bound to be a lot of curious people about when a big plane\r\nlike this lands in a farming district."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke his left hand encountered something hard in the pocket. It\r\nfelt like a box of salve. He withdrew it curiously. It was a box of\r\nshoe polish which the valet doubtless used on Snobbcraft\'s footgear.\r\nHe looked at it aimlessly and was about to thrust it back into the\r\npocket when he had a brilliant idea.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Snobbcraft," he cried excitedly, his rheumy eyes popping\r\nout of his head farther than usual. "This is just the thing."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked his friend, eyeing the little tin box.\r\n\r\n"Well," explained the scientist, "you know real niggers are scarce\r\nnow and nobody would think of bothering a couple of them, even in\r\nMississippi. They\'d probably be a curiosity."\r\n\r\n"What are you getting at, man?"\r\n\r\n"This: we can put this blacking on our head, face, neck and hands,\r\nand no one will take us for Snobbcraft and Buggerie. Frazier can tell\r\nanybody that inquires that we\'re two darkies he\'s taking out of the\r\ncountry, or something like that. Then, after we get our gas and start\r\noff again, we can wash the stuff off with gasoline. It\'s our only\r\nchance, Arthur. If we go down like we are, they\'ll kill us sure."\r\n\r\nSnobbcraft pursed his lips and pondered the proposition for a moment.\r\nIt was indeed, he saw, their only chance to effectively escape\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\n"All right," he agreed, "let\'s hurry up. This ship Won\'t stay up much\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\nIndustriously they daubed each other\'s head, neck, face, chest, hands\r\nand arms with the shoe polish. In five minutes they closely resembled\r\na brace of mammy singers. Snobbcraft hurriedly instructed Frazier.\r\n\r\nThe plane slowly circled to the ground. The region was slightly rolling\r\nand there was no good landing place. There could be no delay, however,\r\nso Frazier did his best. The big ship bumped over logs and through\r\nweeds, heading straight for a clump of trees. Quickly the pilot steered\r\nit to the left only to send it head first into a ditch. The plane\r\nturned completely over, one wing was entirely smashed and Frazier,\r\ncaught in the wreckage under the engine, cried feebly for help for a\r\nfew moments and then lay still.\r\n\r\nShaken up and bruised, the two passengers, managed to crawl out of\r\nthe cabin window to safety. Dolefully they stood in the Mississippi\r\nsunlight, surveying the wreckage and looking questioningly at each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Well," whined Dr. Buggerie, rubbing one large sore buttock, "what now?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up," growled Snobbcraft. "If it hadn\'t been for you, we wouldn\'t\r\nbe here."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHappy Hill, Mississippi, was all aflutter. For some days it had been\r\npreparing for the great, open-air revival of the True Faith Christ\r\nLovers\' Church. The faithful for miles around were expected to attend\r\nthe services scheduled for the afternoon of Election Day and which all\r\nhoped would last well into the night.\r\n\r\nThis section of the state had been untouched by the troubles through\r\nwhich the rest of the South had gone as a result of the activities of\r\nBlack-No-More, Incorporated. The people for miles around were with\r\nvery few exceptions old residents and thence known to be genuine\r\nblue-blooded Caucasians for as far back as any resident could remember\r\nwhich was at least fifty years. The people were proud of this fact.\r\nThey were more proud, however, of the fact that Happy Hill was the\r\nhome and birthplace of the True Faith Christ Lovers\' Church, which\r\nmade the prodigious boast of being the most truly Fundamentalist of\r\nall the Christian sects in the United States. Other things of which\r\nthe community might have boasted were its inordinately high illiteracy\r\nrate and its lynching record--but these things were seldom mentioned,\r\nalthough no one was ashamed of them. Certain things are taken for\r\ngranted everywhere.\r\n\r\nLong before the United States had rid themselves of their Negroes\r\nthrough the good but unsolicited offices of Dr. Junius Crookman, Happy\r\nHill had not only rid itself of what few Negroes had resided in its\r\nvicinity but of all itinerant blackamoors who lucklessly came through\r\nthe place. Ever since the Civil War when the proud and courageous\r\nforefathers of the Caucasian inhabitants had vigorously resisted all\r\nefforts to draft them into the Confederate Army, there had been a sign\r\nnailed over the general store and post office reading, "NIGER REDE &\r\nRUN. IF U CAN\'T REDE, RUN ENEYHOWE." The literate denizens of Happy\r\nHill would sometimes stand off and spell out the words with the pride\r\nthat usually accompanies erudition.\r\n\r\nThe method by which Happy Hill discouraged blackamoors who sought the\r\nhospitality of the place, was simple: the offending Ethiopian was\r\neither hung or shot and then broiled. Across from the general store\r\nand post office was a large iron post about five feet high. On it all\r\nblacks were burned. Down one side of it was a long line of nicks made\r\nwith hammer and chisel. Each nick stood for a Negro dispatched. This\r\npost was one of the landmarks of the community and was pointed out\r\nto visitors with pardonable civic pride by local boosters. Sage old\r\nfellows frequently remarked between expectorations of tobacco juice\r\nthat the only Negro problem in Happy Hill was the difficulty of getting\r\nhold of a sufficient number of the Sons or Daughters of Ham to lighten\r\nthe dullness of the place.\r\n\r\nQuite naturally the news that all Negroes had disappeared, not only\r\nfrom their state but from the entire country, had been received with\r\nsincere regret by the inhabitants of Happy Hill. They envisioned the\r\npassing of an old, established custom. Now there was nothing left to\r\nstimulate them but the old time religion and the clandestine sex orgies\r\nthat invariably and immediately followed the great revival meetings.\r\n\r\nSo the simple country folk had turned to religion with renewed ardor.\r\nThere were several churches in the county, Methodist, Baptist,\r\nCampbellite and, of course, Holy Roller. The latter, indeed, had the\r\nlargest membership. But the people, eager for something new, found all\r\nof the old churches too tame. They wanted a faith with more punch to\r\nit; a faith that would fittingly accompany the fierce corn liquor which\r\nall consumed, albeit they were all confirmed Prohibitionists.\r\n\r\nWhenever and wherever there is a social need, some agency arises to\r\nsupply it. The needs of Happy Hill were no exception. One day, several\r\nweeks previously, there had come to the community one Rev. Alex McPhule\r\nwho claimed to be the founder of a new faith, a true faith, that would\r\nsave all from the machinations of the Evil One. The other churches,\r\nhe averred, had failed. The other churches had grown soft and were\r\nflirting with atheism and Modernism which, according to Rev. McPhule,\r\nwere the same thing. An angel of God had visited him one summer evening\r\nin Meridian, he told them, when he was down sick in bed as the result\r\nof his sinning ways, and had told him to reform and go forth into the\r\nworld and preach the true faith of Christ\'s love. He had promised to\r\ndo so, of course, and then the angel had placed the palm of his right\r\nhand on Rev. McPhule\'s forehead and all of the sickness and misery had\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nThe residents of Happy Hill and vicinity listened with rapt attention\r\nand respect. The man was sincere, eloquent and obviously a Nordic.\r\nHe was tall, thin, slightly knock-kneed, with a shock of unkempt red\r\nhair, wild blue eyes, hollow cheeks, lantern jaw and long ape-like\r\narms that looked very impressive when he waved them up and down during\r\na harangue. His story sounded logical to the country people and they\r\nflocked in droves to his first revival held in a picturesque natural\r\namphitheater about a mile from town.\r\n\r\nNo one had any difficulty in understanding the new faith. No music\r\nwas allowed besides singing and thumping the bottom of a wooden tub.\r\nThere were no chairs. Everybody sat on the ground in a circle with Rev.\r\nMcPhule in the center. The holy man would begin an extemporaneous song\r\nand would soon have the faithful singing it after him and swinging from\r\nside to side in unison. Then he would break off abruptly and launch\r\ninto an old fashion hellfire-and-damnation sermon in which demons,\r\nbrimstone, adultery, rum, and other evils prominently figured. At the\r\nheight of his remarks, he would roll his eyes heavenward, froth at\r\nthe mouth, run around on all fours and embrace in turn each member\r\nof the congregation, especially the buxom ladies. This would be the\r\nsignal for others to follow his example. The sisters and brothers\r\nosculated, embraced and rolled, shouting meanwhile: "Christ is Love!...\r\nLove Christ!... Oh, be happy in the arms of Jesus!... Oh, Jesus, my\r\nSweetheart!... Heavenly Father!" Frequently these revivals took place\r\non the darkest nights with the place of worship dimly illuminated by\r\npine torches. As these torches always seemed to conveniently burn out\r\nabout the time the embracing and rolling started, the new faith rapidly\r\nbecame popular.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time nothing in Happy Hill was too good for Rev. Alex\r\nMcPhule. Every latch-string hung out for him. As usual with gentlemen\r\nof the cloth, he was especially popular with the ladies. When the men\r\nwere at work in the fields, the Man of God would visit house after\r\nhouse and comfort the womenfolk with his Christian message. Being a\r\nbachelor, he made these professional calls with great frequency.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alex McPhule also held private audiences with the sick,\r\nsinful and neurotic in his little cabin. There he had erected an altar\r\ncovered with the white marble top from an old bureau. Around this altar\r\nwere painted some grotesque figures, evidently the handiwork of the\r\nevangelist, while on the wall in back of the altar hung a large square\r\nof white oilcloth upon which was painted a huge eye. The sinner seeking\r\nsurcease was commanded to gaze upon the eye while making confessions\r\nand requests. On the altar reposed a crudely-bound manuscript about\r\nthree inches thick. This was the "Bible" of the Christ Lovers which the\r\nRev. McPhule declared he had written at the command of Jesus Christ\r\nHimself. The majority of his visitors were middle-aged wives and\r\nadenoidal and neurotic young girls. None departed unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nWith all the good fortune that had come to the Rev. McPhule as a result\r\nof engaging in the Lord\'s work, he was still dissatisfied. He never\r\npassed a Baptist, Methodist or Holy Roller church without jealousy and\r\nambition surging up within him. He wanted everybody in the county in\r\nhis flock. He wanted to do God\'s work so effectually that the other\r\nchurches would be put out of business. He could only do this, he knew,\r\nwith the aid of a message straight from Heaven. That alone would\r\nimpress them.\r\n\r\nHe began to talk in his meetings about a sign coming down from Heaven\r\nto convince all doubters and infidels like Methodists and Baptists. His\r\nflock was soon on the nervous edge of expectancy but the Lord failed,\r\nfor some reason, to answer the prayer of his right-hand man.\r\n\r\nRev. McPhule began to wonder what he had done to offend the Almighty.\r\nHe prayed long and fervently in the quiet of his bedchamber, except\r\nwhen he didn\'t have company, but no sign appeared. Possibly, thought\r\nthe evangelist, some big demonstration might attract the attention of\r\nJesus; something bigger than the revivals he had been staging. Then\r\none day somebody brought him a copy of _The Warning_ and upon reading\r\nit he got an idea. If the Lord would only send him a nigger for his\r\ncongregation to lynch! That would, indeed, be marked evidence of the\r\npower of Rev. Alex McPhule.\r\n\r\nHe prayed with increased fervency but no African put in an appearance.\r\nTwo nights later as he sat before his altar, his "Bible" clutched in\r\nhis hands, a bat flew in the window. It rapidly circled the room and\r\nflew out again. Rev. McPhule could feel the wind from its wings. He\r\nstood erect with a wild look in his watery blue eyes and screamed, "A\r\nsign! A sign! Oh, Glory be! The Lord has answered my prayer! Oh, thank\r\nyou, God! A sign! A sign!" Then he grew dizzy, his eyes dimmed and he\r\nfell twitching across the altar, unconscious.\r\n\r\nNext day he went around Happy Hill telling of his experience of the\r\nnight before. An angel of the Lord, he told the gaping villagers, had\r\nflown through the window, alighted on his "Bible" and, kissing him on\r\nhis forehead, had declared that the Lord would answer his prayer and\r\nsend a sign. As proof of his tale, Rev. McPhule exhibited a red spot\r\non his forehead which he had received when his head struck the marble\r\naltar top but which he claimed marked the place where the messenger of\r\nthe Lord had kissed him.\r\n\r\nThe simple folk of Happy Hill were, with few exceptions, convinced that\r\nthe Rev. McPhule stood in well with the celestial authorities. Nervous\r\nand expectant they talked of nothing but The Sign. They were on edge\r\nfor the great revival scheduled for Election Day at which time they\r\nfervently hoped the Lord would make good.\r\n\r\nAt last the great day had arrived. From far and near came the good\r\npeople of the countryside on horseback, in farm wagons and battered\r\nmud-caked flivvers. Many paused to cast their ballots for Givens\r\nand Snobbcraft, not having heard of the developments of the past\r\ntwenty-four hours, but the bulk of the folk repaired immediately to the\r\nsacred grove where the preaching would take place.\r\n\r\nRev. Alex McPhule gloated inwardly at the many concentric circles of\r\nupturned faces. They were eager, he saw, to drink in his words of\r\nwisdom and be elevated. He noted with satisfaction that there were\r\nmany strange people in the congregation. It showed that his power was\r\ngrowing. He glanced up apprehensively at the blue heavens. Would The\r\nSign come? Would the Lord answer his prayers? He muttered another\r\nprayer and then proceeded to business.\r\n\r\nHe was an impressive figure today. He had draped himself in a long,\r\nwhite robe with a great red cross on the left breast and he looked not\r\nunlike one of the Prophets of old. He walked back and forth in the\r\nlittle circle surrounded by close-packed humanity, bending backward and\r\nforward, swinging his arms, shaking his head and rolling his eyes while\r\nhe retold for the fiftieth time the story of the angel\'s visit. The man\r\nwas a natural actor and his voice had that sepulchral tone universally\r\nassociated with Men of God, court criers and Independence Day orators.\r\nIn the first row squatted the Happy Hill True Faith Choir of eight\r\nyoung women with grizzled old man Yawbrew, the tub-thumper, among them.\r\nThey groaned, amened and Yes-Lorded at irregular intervals.\r\n\r\nThen, having concluded his story, the evangelist launched into song in\r\na harsh, nasal voice:\r\n\r\n    _I done come to Happy Hill to save you from Sin,\r\n    Salvation\'s door is open and you\'d better come in,\r\n    Oh, Glory Hallelujah! you\'d better come in.\r\n    Jesus Christ has called me to save this white race,\r\n    And with His Help I\'ll save you from awful disgrace.\r\n    Oh, Glory Hallelujah! We must save this race._\r\n\r\nOld man Yawbrew beat on his tub while the sisters swayed and\r\naccompanied their pastor. The congregation joined in.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Rev. McPhule stopped, glared at the rows of strained, upturned\r\nfaces and extending his long arms to the sun, he shouted:\r\n\r\n"It\'ll come I tell yuh. Yes Lord, the sign will come--ugh. I know\r\nthat my Lord liveth and the sign will come--ugh. If--ugh--you just\r\nhave faith--ugh. Oh, Jesus--ugh. Brothers and Sisters--ugh. Just\r\nhave faith--ugh--and the Lord--ugh--will answer your prayers....\r\nOh, Christ--ugh. Oh, Little Jesus--ugh.... Oh, God--ugh--answer our\r\nprayers.... Save us--ugh. Send us the Sign...."\r\n\r\nThe congregation shouted after him "Send us the Sign!" Then he again\r\nlaunched into a hymn composed on the spot:\r\n\r\n    "_He will send the Sign,\r\n    Oh, He will send the Sign\r\n    Loving Little Jesus Christ\r\n    He will send the Sign._"\r\n\r\nOver and over he sang the verse. The people joined him until the volume\r\nof sound was tremendous. Then with a piercing scream, Rev. McPhule fell\r\non all fours and running among the people hugged one after the other,\r\ncrying "Christ is Love!... He\'ll send the Sign!... Oh, Jesus! send us\r\nThe Sign!" The cries of the others mingled with his and there was a\r\ngeneral kissing, embracing and rolling there in the green-walled grove\r\nunder the midday sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the sun approached its zenith, Mr. Arthur Snobbcraft and Dr. Samuel\r\nBuggerie, grotesque in their nondescript clothing and their blackened\r\nskins, trudged along the dusty road in what they hoped was the\r\ndirection of a town. For three hours, now, they had been on the way,\r\nskirting isolated farmhouses and cabins, hoping to get to a place where\r\nthey could catch a train. They had fiddled aimlessly around the wrecked\r\nplane for two or three hours before getting up courage enough to take\r\nto the highroad. Suddenly they both thrilled with pleasure somewhat\r\ndampened by apprehension as they espied from a rise in the road, a\r\nconsiderable collection of houses.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a town," exclaimed Snobbcraft. "Now let\'s get this damned\r\nstuff off our faces. There\'s probably a telegraph office there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be crazy," Buggerie pleaded. "If we take off this blacking\r\nwe\'re lost. The whole country has heard the news about us by this time,\r\neven in Mississippi. Let\'s go right in as we are, pretending we\'re\r\nniggers, and I\'ll bet we\'ll be treated all right. We won\'t have to stay\r\nlong. With our pictures all over the country, it would be suicidal to\r\nturn up here in one of these hotbeds of bigotry and ignorance."\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe you\'re right," Snobbcraft grudgingly admitted. He was\r\neager to get the shoe polish off his skin. Both men had perspired\r\nfreely during their hike and the sweat had mixed with the blacking much\r\nto their discomfort.\r\n\r\nAs they started toward the little settlement, they heard shouts and\r\nsinging on their left.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" cried Dr. Buggerie, stopping to listen.\r\n\r\n"Sounds like a camp meeting," Snobbcraft replied. "Hope it is. We can\r\nbe sure those folks will treat us right. One thing about these people\r\ndown here they are real, sincere Christians."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it will be wise to go where there\'s any crowds," warned\r\nthe statistician. "You never can tell what a crowd will do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up, and come on!" Snobbcraft snapped. "I\'ve listened to you\r\nlong enough. If it hadn\'t been for you we would never have had all of\r\nthis trouble. Statistics! Bah!"\r\n\r\nThey struck off over the fields toward the sound of the singing. Soon\r\nthey reached the edge of the ravine and looked down on the assemblage.\r\nAt about the same time, some of the people facing in that direction\r\nsaw them and started yelling "The Sign! Look! Niggers! Praise God! The\r\nSign! Lynch \'em!" Others joined in the cry. Rev. McPhule turned loose\r\na buxom sister and stood wide-eyed and erect. His prayers had come\r\ntrue! "Lynch \'em!" he roared.\r\n\r\n"We\'d better get out of here," said Buggerie, quaking.\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Snobbcraft, as the assemblage started to move toward them.\r\n\r\nOver fences, through bushes, across ditches sped the two men, puffing\r\nand wheezing at the unaccustomed exertion, while in hot pursuit came\r\nRev. McPhule followed by his enthusiastic flock.\r\n\r\nSlowly the mob gained on the two Virginia aristocrats. Dr. Buggerie\r\nstumbled and sprawled on the ground. A dozen men and women fell upon\r\nhim while he yelled to the speeding Snobbcraft for help. The angular\r\nSnobbcraft kept on but Rev. McPhule and several others soon overtook\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe two men were marched protesting to Happy Hill. The enthused\r\nvillagers pinched them, pulled them, playfully punched and kicked them\r\nduring their triumphant march. No one paid the slightest attention to\r\ntheir pleas. Too long had Happy Hill waited for a Negro to lynch. Could\r\nthe good people hesitate now that the Lord had answered their prayers?\r\n\r\nBuggerie wept and Snobbcraft offered large sums of money for their\r\nfreedom. The money was taken and distributed but the two men were not\r\nliberated. They insisted that they were not Negroes but they were only\r\ncudgeled for their pains.\r\n\r\nAt last the gay procession arrived at the long-unused iron post in\r\nfront of the general store and post office in Happy Hill. As soon as\r\nMr. Snobbcraft saw the post he guessed its significance. Something must\r\nbe done quickly.\r\n\r\n"We\'re not niggers," he yelled to the mob. "Take off our clothes and\r\nlook at us. See for yourself. My God! don\'t lynch white men. We\'re\r\nwhite the same as you are."\r\n\r\n"Yes, gentlemen," bleated Dr. Buggerie, "we\'re really white men.\r\nWe just came from a masquerade ball over at Meridian and our plane\r\nwrecked. You can\'t do a thing like this. We\'re white men, I tell you."\r\n\r\nThe crowd paused. Even Rev. McPhule seemed convinced. Eager hands tore\r\noff the men\'s garments and revealed their pale white skins underneath.\r\nImmediately apology took the place of hatred. The two men were taken\r\nover to the general store and permitted to wash off the shoe polish\r\nwhile the crowd, a little disappointed, stood around wondering what to\r\ndo. They felt cheated. Somebody must be to blame for depriving them of\r\ntheir fun. They began to eye Rev. McPhule. He glanced around nervously.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of this growing tenseness, an ancient Ford drove\r\nup to the outskirts of the crowd and a young man jumped out waving a\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n"Looky here!" he yelled. "They\'ve found out th\' damned Demmycratic\r\ncandidates is niggers. See here: Givens and Snobbcraft. Them\'s their\r\npictures. They pulled out in airplanes last night or th\' mobs wouldda\r\nlynched \'em." Men, women and children crowded around the newcomer while\r\nhe read the account of the flight of the Democratic standard bearers.\r\nThey gazed at each other bewildered and hurled imprecations upon the\r\nheads of the vanished candidates.\r\n\r\nWashed and refreshed, Mr. Arthur Snobbcraft and Dr. Samuel Buggerie,\r\neach puffing a five-cent cigar (the most expensive sold in the store)\r\nappeared again on the porch of the general store. They felt greatly\r\nrelieved after their narrow escape.\r\n\r\n"I told you they wouldn\'t know who we were," said Snobbcraft\r\ndisdainfully but softly.\r\n\r\n"Who are you folks, anyway?" asked Rev. McPhule, suddenly at their\r\nelbow. He was holding the newspaper in his hand. The crowd was watching\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Why-why-y I\'m-a-er-a that is ..." spluttered Snobbcraft.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t that your pichure?" thundered the evangelist, pointing to the\r\nlikeness on the front page of the newspaper.\r\n\r\n"Why no," Snobbcraft lied, "but--but it looks like me, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re mighty right it does!" said Rev. McPhule, sternly, "and it _is_\r\nyou, too!"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no, that\'s not me," cried the president of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n"Yes it is," roared McPhule, as the crowd closed in on the two hapless\r\nmen. "It\'s you and you\'re a nigger, accordin\' to this here paper, an\' a\r\nnewspaper wouldn\'t lie." Turning to his followers he commanded, "Take\r\n\'em. They\'re niggers just as I thought. The Lord\'s will be done. Idea\r\nof niggers runnin\' on th\' Demmycratic ticket!"\r\n\r\nThe crowd came closer. Buggerie protested that he was really white but\r\nit was of no avail. The crowd had sufficient excuse for doing what they\r\nhad wanted to do at first. They shook their fists in the two men\'s\r\nfaces, kicked them, tore off their nondescript garments, searched their\r\npockets and found cards and papers proving their identity, and but for\r\nthe calmness and presence of mind of the Rev. McPhule, the True Faith\r\nChrist Lovers would have torn the unfortunate men limb from limb. The\r\nevangelist restrained the more hot-headed individuals and insisted that\r\nthe ceremonies proceed according to time-honored custom.\r\n\r\nSo the impetuous yielded to wiser counsel. The two men, vociferously\r\nprotesting, were stripped naked, held down by husky and willing farm\r\nhands and their ears and genitals cut off with jack knives amid the\r\nfiendish cries of men and women. When this crude surgery was completed,\r\nsome wag sewed their ears to their backs and they were released and\r\ntold to run. Eagerly, in spite of their pain, both men tried to\r\navail themselves of the opportunity. Anything was better than this.\r\nStaggering forward through an opening made in the crowd, they attempted\r\nto run down the dusty road, blood streaming down their bodies. They had\r\nonly gone a few feet when, at a signal from the militant evangelist,\r\na half-dozen revolvers cracked and the two Virginians pitched forward\r\ninto the dust amid the uproarious laughter of the congregation.\r\n\r\nThe preliminaries ended, the two victims, not yet dead, were picked up,\r\ndragged to the stake and bound to it, back to back. Little boys and\r\ngirls gaily gathered excelsior, scrap paper, twigs and small branches\r\nwhile their proud parents fetched logs, boxes, kerosene and the staves\r\nfrom a cider barrel. The fuel was piled up around the groaning men\r\nuntil only their heads were visible.\r\n\r\nWhen all was in readiness, the people fell back and the Rev. McPhule,\r\nas master of ceremonies, ignited the pyre. As the flames shot upward,\r\nthe dazed men, roused by the flames, strained vainly at the chains that\r\nheld them. Buggerie found his voice and let out yelp after yelp as the\r\nflames licked at his fat flesh. The crowd whooped with glee and Rev.\r\nMcPhule beamed with satisfaction. The flames rose higher and completely\r\nhid the victims from view. The fire crackled merrily and the intense\r\nheat drove the spectators back. The odor of cooking meat permeated\r\nthe clear, country air and many a nostril was guiltily distended. The\r\nflames subsided to reveal a red-hot stake supporting two charred hulks.\r\n\r\nThere were in the assemblage two or three whitened Negroes, who,\r\nremembering what their race had suffered in the past, would fain\r\nhave gone to the assistance of the two men but fear for their own\r\nlives restrained them. Even so they were looked at rather sharply by\r\nsome of the Christ Lovers because they did not appear to be enjoying\r\nthe spectacle as thoroughly as the rest. Noticing these questioning\r\nglances, the whitened Negroes began to yell and prod the burning\r\nbodies with sticks and cast stones at them. This exhibition restored\r\nthem to favor and banished any suspicion that they might not be\r\none-hundred-per-cent Americans.\r\n\r\nWhen the roasting was over and the embers had cooled, the more\r\nadventurous members of Rev. McPhule\'s flock rushed to the stake and\r\ngroped in the two bodies for skeletal souvenirs such as forefingers,\r\ntoes and teeth. Proudly their pastor looked on. This was the crowning\r\nof a life\'s ambition. Tomorrow his name would be in every newspaper\r\nin the United States. God had indeed answered his prayers. He breathed\r\nagain his thanks as he thrust his hand into his pocket and felt the\r\nsoothing touch of the hundred-dollar bill he had extracted from\r\nSnobbcraft\'s pocket. He was supremely happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AND SO ON AND SO ON\r\n\r\nIn the last days of the Goosie administration, the Surgeon-General of\r\nthe United States, Dr. Junius Crookman, published a monograph on the\r\ndifferences in skin pigmentation of the real whites and those he had\r\nmade white by the Black-No-More process. In it he declared, to the\r\nconsternation of many Americans, that in practically every instance\r\nthe new Caucasians were from two to three shades lighter than the old\r\nCaucasians, and that approximately one-sixth of the population were in\r\nthe first group. The old Caucasians had never been really white but\r\nrather were a pale pink shading down to a sand color and a red. Even\r\nwhen an old Caucasian contracted vitiligo, he pointed out, the skin\r\nbecame much lighter.\r\n\r\nTo a society that had been taught to venerate whiteness for over three\r\nhundred years, this announcement was rather staggering. What was the\r\nworld coming to, if the blacks were whiter than the whites? Many\r\npeople in the upper class began to look askance at their very pale\r\ncomplexions. If it were true that extreme whiteness was evidence of\r\nthe possession of Negro blood, of having once been a member of a pariah\r\nclass, then surely it were well not to be so white!\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman\'s amazing brochure started the entire country to examining\r\nshades of skin color again. Sunday magazine supplements carried long\r\narticles on the subject from the pens of hack writers who knew nothing\r\nwhatever of pigmentation. Pale people who did not have blue eyes began\r\nto be whispered about. The comic weeklies devoted special numbers to\r\nthe question that was on everyone\'s lips. Senator Bosh of Mississippi,\r\nabout to run again for office, referred several times to it in the\r\nCongressional Record, his remarks interspersed with "Applauses." A\r\npopular song, "Whiter Than White" was being whistled by the entire\r\nnation. Among the working classes, in the next few months, there grew\r\nup a certain prejudice against all fellow workers who were exceedingly\r\npale.\r\n\r\nThe new Caucasians began to grow self-conscious and resent the\r\ncurious gazes bestowed upon their lily-white countenances in all\r\npublic places. They wrote indignant letters to the newspapers about\r\nthe insults and discriminations to which they were increasingly\r\nbecoming subjected. They protested vehemently against the effort\r\non the part of employers to pay them less and on the part of the\r\nmanagement of public institutions to segregate them. A delegation\r\nthat waited upon President Goosie firmly denounced the social\r\ntrend and called upon the government to do something about it. The\r\nDown-With-White-Prejudice-League was founded by one Karl von Beerde,\r\nwhom some accused of being the same Doctor Beard who had, as a\r\nNegro, once headed the National Social Equality League. Offices were\r\nestablished in the Times Square district of New York and the mails\r\nwere soon laden with releases attempting to prove that those of\r\nexceedingly pale skin were just as good as anybody else and should\r\nnot, therefore, be oppressed. A Dr. Cutten Prodd wrote a book proving\r\nthat all enduring gifts to society came from those races whose skin\r\ncolor was not exceedingly pale, pointing out that the Norwegians and\r\nother Nordic peoples had been in savagery when Egypt and Crete were\r\nat the height of their development. Prof. Handen Moutthe, the eminent\r\nanthropologist (who was well known for his popular work on _The Sex\r\nLife of Left-Handed Morons among the Ainus_) announced that as a result\r\nof his long research among the palest citizens, he was convinced they\r\nwere mentally inferior and that their children should be segregated\r\nfrom the others in school. Professor Moutthe\'s findings were considered\r\nauthoritative because he had spent three entire weeks of hard work\r\nassembling his data. Four state legislatures immediately began to\r\nconsider bills calling for separate schools for pale children.\r\n\r\nThose of the upper class began to look around for ways to get darker.\r\nIt became the fashion for them to spend hours at the seashore basking\r\nnaked in the sunshine and then to dash back, heavily bronzed, to their\r\nhomes, and, preening themselves in their dusky skins, lord it over\r\ntheir paler, and thus less fortunate, associates. Beauty shops began\r\nto sell face powders named _Poudre N\xc3\xa8gre_, _Poudre le Egyptienne_ and\r\n_L\'Afrique_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sari Blandine (formerly Mme. Sisseretta Blandish of Harlem),\r\nwho had been working on a steam table in a Broadway Automat, saw her\r\nopportunity and began to study skin stains. She stayed away from work\r\none week to read up on the subject at the Public Library and came back\r\nto find a recent arrival from Czecho-Slovakia holding down her job.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blandine, however, was not downhearted. She had the information\r\nand in three or four weeks time she had a skin stain that would impart\r\na long-wearing light-brown tinge to the pigment. It worked successfully\r\non her young daughter; so successfully, in fact, that the damsel\r\nreceived a proposal of marriage from a young millionaire within a month\r\nafter applying it.\r\n\r\nFree applications were given to all of the young women of the\r\nneighborhood. Mrs. Blandine\'s stain became most popular and her fame\r\ngrew in her locality. She opened a shop in her front room and soon had\r\nit crowded from morning till night. The concoction was patented as\r\nBlandine\'s Egyptienne Stain.\r\n\r\nBy the time President-Elect Hornbill was inaugurated, her Egyptienne\r\nStain Shoppes dotted the country and she had won three suits for\r\ninfringement of patent. Everybody that was anybody had a stained skin.\r\nA girl without one was avoided by the young men; a young man without\r\none was at a decided disadvantage, economically and socially. A white\r\nface became startlingly rare. America was definitely, enthusiastically\r\nmulatto-minded.\r\n\r\nImitations of Mrs. Blandine\'s invention sprang up like weeds in a\r\ncemetery. In two years there were fifteen companies manufacturing\r\ndifferent kinds of stains and artificial tans. At last, even the Zulu\r\nTan became the vogue among the smart set and it was a common thing to\r\nsee a sweet young miss stop before a show window and dab her face with\r\ncharcoal. Enterprising resort keepers in Florida and California, intent\r\non attracting the _haute monde_, hired naturally black bathing girls\r\nfrom Africa until the white women protested against the practice on the\r\nground that it was a menace to family life.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday morning Surgeon-General Crookman, in looking over the\r\nrotogravure section of his favorite newspaper, saw a photograph of a\r\nhappy crowd of Americans arrayed in the latest abbreviated bathing\r\nsuits on the sands at Cannes. In the group he recognized Hank Johnson,\r\nChuck Foster, Bunny Brown and his real Negro wife, former Imperial\r\nGrand Wizard and Mrs. Givens and Matthew and Helen Fisher. All of them,\r\nhe noticed, were quite as dusky as little Matthew Crookman Fisher who\r\nplayed in a sandpile at their feet.\r\n\r\nDr. Crookman smiled wearily and passed the section to his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BLACK NO MORE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
