He was a character whom, with his wife, I have\r\nemployed in some six or eight other stories, and whom I made as much the\r\nhero and heroine of \'Their Wedding Journey\' as the slight fable would\r\nbear. In venturing out of my adoptive New England, where I had found\r\nmyself at home with many imaginary friends, I found it natural to ask the\r\ncompany of these familiar acquaintances, but their company was not to be\r\nhad at once for the asking. When I began speaking of them as Basil and\r\nIsabel, in the fashion of \'Their Wedding Journey,\' they would not respond\r\nwith the effect of early middle age which I desired in them. They\r\nremained wilfully, not to say woodenly, the young bridal pair of that\r\nromance, without the promise of novel functioning. It was not till I\r\ntried addressing them as March and Mrs. March that they stirred under my\r\nhand with fresh impulse, and set about the work assigned them as people\r\nin something more than their second youth.\r\n\r\nThe scene into which I had invited them to figure filled the largest\r\ncanvas I had yet allowed myself; and, though \'A Hazard of New Fortunes\r\nwas not the first story I had written with the printer at my heels, it\r\nwas the first which took its own time to prescribe its own dimensions. I\r\nhad the general design well in mind when I began to write it, but as it\r\nadvanced it compelled into its course incidents, interests,\r\nindividualities, which I had not known lay near, and it specialized and\r\namplified at points which I had not always meant to touch, though I\r\nshould not like to intimate anything mystical in the fact. It became, to\r\nmy thinking, the most vital of my fictions, through my quickened interest\r\nin the life about me, at a moment of great psychological import. We had\r\npassed through a period of strong emotioning in the direction of the\r\nhumaner economics, if I may phrase it so; the rich seemed not so much to\r\ndespise the poor, the poor did not so hopelessly repine. The solution of\r\nthe riddle of the painful earth through the dreams of Henry George,\r\nthrough the dreams of Edward Bellamy, through the dreams of all the\r\ngenerous visionaries of the past, seemed not impossibly far off. That\r\nshedding of blood which is for the remission of sins had been symbolized\r\nby the bombs and scaffolds of Chicago, and the hearts of those who felt\r\nthe wrongs bound up with our rights, the slavery implicated in our\r\nliberty, were thrilling with griefs and hopes hitherto strange to the\r\naverage American breast. Opportunely for me there was a great street-car\r\nstrike in New York, and the story began to find its way to issues nobler\r\nand larger than those of the love-affairs common to fiction. I was in my\r\nfifty-second year when I took it up, and in the prime, such as it was, of\r\nmy powers. The scene which I had chosen appealed prodigiously to me, and\r\nthe action passed as nearly without my conscious agency as I ever allow\r\nmyself to think such things happen.\r\n\r\nThe opening chapters were written in a fine, old fashioned apartment\r\nhouse which had once been a family house, and in an uppermost room of\r\nwhich I could look from my work across the trees of the little park in\r\nStuyvesant Square to the towers of St. George\'s Church. Then later in the\r\nspring of 1889 the unfinished novel was carried to a country house on the\r\nBelmont border of Cambridge. There I must have written very rapidly to\r\nhave pressed it to conclusion before the summer ended. It came, indeed,\r\nso easily from the pen that I had the misgiving which I always have of\r\nthings which do not cost me great trouble.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the book with which I amused myself more than the\r\nhouse-hunting of the Marches when they were placing themselves in New\r\nYork; and if the contemporary reader should turn for instruction to the\r\npages in which their experience is detailed I assure him that he may\r\ntrust their fidelity and accuracy in the article of New York housing as\r\nit was early in the last decade of the last century: I mean, the housing\r\nof people of such moderate means as the Marches. In my zeal for truth I\r\ndid not distinguish between reality and actuality in this or other\r\nmatters--that is, one was as precious to me as the other. But the types\r\nhere portrayed are as true as ever they were, though the world in which\r\nthey were finding their habitat is wonderfully, almost incredibly\r\ndifferent. Yet it is not wholly different, for a young literary pair now\r\nadventuring in New York might easily parallel the experience of the\r\nMarches with their own, if not for so little money; many phases of New\r\nYork housing are better, but all are dearer. Other aspects of the\r\nmaterial city have undergone a transformation much more wonderful. I find\r\nthat in my book its population is once modestly spoken of as two\r\nmillions, but now in twenty years it is twice as great, and the grandeur\r\nas well as grandiosity of its forms is doubly apparent. The transitional\r\npublic that then moped about in mildly tinkling horse-cars is now hurried\r\nback and forth in clanging trolleys, in honking and whirring motors; the\r\nElevated road which was the last word of speed is undermined by the\r\nSubway, shooting its swift shuttles through the subterranean woof of the\r\ncity\'s haste. From these feet let the witness infer our whole massive\r\nHercules, a bulk that sprawls and stretches beyond the rivers through the\r\ntunnels piercing their beds and that towers into the skies with\r\ninnumerable tops--a Hercules blent of Briareus and Cerberus, but not so\r\nbad a monster as it seemed then to threaten becoming.\r\n\r\nCertain hopes of truer and better conditions on which my heart was fixed\r\ntwenty years ago are not less dear, and they are by no means touched with\r\ndespair, though they have not yet found the fulfilment which I would then\r\nhave prophesied for them. Events have not wholly played them false;\r\nevents have not halted, though they have marched with a slowness that\r\nmight affect a younger observer as marking time. They who were then\r\nmindful of the poor have not forgotten them, and what is better the poor\r\nhave not often forgotten themselves in violences such as offered me the\r\nmaterial of tragedy and pathos in my story. In my quality of artist I\r\ncould not regret these, and I gratefully realize that they offered me the\r\nopportunity of a more strenuous action, a more impressive catastrophe\r\nthan I could have achieved without them. They tended to give the whole\r\nfable dignity and doubtless made for its success as a book. As a serial\r\nit had crept a sluggish course before a public apparently so unmindful of\r\nit that no rumor of its acceptance or rejection reached the writer during\r\nthe half year of its publication; but it rose in book form from that\r\nfailure and stood upon its feet and went its way to greater favor than\r\nany book of his had yet enjoyed. I hope that my recognition of the fact\r\nwill not seem like boasting, but that the reader will regard it as a\r\nspecial confidence from the author and will let it go no farther.\r\n\r\nKITTERY POINT, MAINE, July, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n"Now, you think this thing over, March, and let me know the last of next\r\nweek," said Fulkerson. He got up from the chair which he had been sitting\r\nastride, with his face to its back, and tilting toward March on its\r\nhind-legs, and came and rapped upon his table with his thin bamboo stick.\r\n"What you want to do is to get out of the insurance business, anyway. You\r\nacknowledge that yourself. You never liked it, and now it makes you sick;\r\nin other words, it\'s killing you. You ain\'t an insurance man by nature.\r\nYou\'re a natural-born literary man, and you\'ve been going against the\r\ngrain. Now, I offer you a chance to go with the grain. I don\'t say you\'re\r\ngoing to make your everlasting fortune, but I\'ll give you a living\r\nsalary, and if the thing succeeds you\'ll share in its success. We\'ll all\r\nshare in its success. That\'s the beauty of it. I tell you, March, this is\r\nthe greatest idea that has been struck since"--Fulkerson stopped and\r\nsearched his mind for a fit image--"since the creation of man."\r\n\r\nHe put his leg up over the corner of March\'s table and gave himself a\r\nsharp cut on the thigh, and leaned forward to get the full effect of his\r\nwords upon his listener.\r\n\r\nMarch had his hands clasped together behind his head, and he took one of\r\nthem down long enough to put his inkstand and mucilage-bottle out of\r\nFulkerson\'s way. After many years\' experiment of a mustache and whiskers,\r\nhe now wore his grizzled beard full, but cropped close; it gave him a\r\ncertain grimness, corrected by the gentleness of his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Some people don\'t think much of the creation of man nowadays. Why stop\r\nat that? Why not say since the morning stars sang together?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; no, sir! I don\'t want to claim too much, and I draw the line at\r\nthe creation of man. I\'m satisfied with that. But if you want to ring the\r\nmorning stars into the prospectus all right; I won\'t go back on you."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t understand why you\'ve set your mind on me," March said. "I\r\nhaven\'t had any magazine experience, you know that; and I haven\'t\r\nseriously attempted to do anything in literature since I was married. I\r\ngave up smoking and the Muse together. I suppose I could still manage a\r\ncigar, but I don\'t believe I could--"\r\n\r\n"Muse worth a cent." Fulkerson took the thought out of his mouth and put\r\nit into his own words. "I know. Well, I don\'t want you to. I don\'t care\r\nif you never write a line for the thing, though you needn\'t reject\r\nanything of yours, if it happens to be good, on that account. And I don\'t\r\nwant much experience in my editor; rather not have it. You told me,\r\ndidn\'t you, that you used to do some newspaper work before you settled\r\ndown?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I thought my lines were permanently cast in those places once. It\r\nwas more an accident than anything else that I got into the insurance\r\nbusiness. I suppose I secretly hoped that if I made my living by\r\nsomething utterly different, I could come more freshly to literature\r\nproper in my leisure."\r\n\r\n"I see; and you found the insurance business too many, for you. Well,\r\nanyway, you\'ve always had a hankering for the inkpots; and the fact that\r\nyou first gave me the idea of this thing shows that you\'ve done more or\r\nless thinking about magazines."\r\n\r\n"Yes--less."\r\n\r\n"Well, all right. Now don\'t you be troubled. I know what I want,\r\ngenerally, speaking, and in this particular instance I want you. I might\r\nget a man of more experience, but I should probably get a man of more\r\nprejudice and self-conceit along with him, and a man with a following of\r\nthe literary hangers-on that are sure to get round an editor sooner or\r\nlater. I want to start fair, and I\'ve found out in the syndicate business\r\nall the men that are worth having. But they know me, and they don\'t know\r\nyou, and that\'s where we shall have the pull on them. They won\'t be able\r\nto work the thing. Don\'t you be anxious about the experience. I\'ve got\r\nexperience enough of my own to run a dozen editors. What I want is an\r\neditor who has taste, and you\'ve got it; and conscience, and you\'ve got\r\nit; and horse sense, and you\'ve got that. And I like you because you\'re a\r\nWestern man, and I\'m another. I do cotton to a Western man when I find\r\nhim off East here, holding his own with the best of \'em, and showing \'em\r\nthat he\'s just as much civilized as they are. We both know what it is to\r\nhave our bright home in the setting sun; heigh?"\r\n\r\n"I think we Western men who\'ve come East are apt to take ourselves a\r\nlittle too objectively and to feel ourselves rather more representative\r\nthan we need," March remarked.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was delighted. "You\'ve hit it! We do! We are!"\r\n\r\n"And as for holding my own, I\'m not very proud of what I\'ve done in that\r\nway; it\'s been very little to hold. But I know what you mean, Fulkerson,\r\nand I\'ve felt the same thing myself; it warmed me toward you when we\r\nfirst met. I can\'t help suffusing a little to any man when I hear that he\r\nwas born on the other side of the Alleghanies. It\'s perfectly stupid. I\r\ndespise the same thing when I see it in Boston people."\r\n\r\nFulkerson pulled first one of his blond whiskers and then the other, and\r\ntwisted the end of each into a point, which he left to untwine itself. He\r\nfixed March with his little eyes, which had a curious innocence in their\r\ncunning, and tapped the desk immediately in front of him. "What I like\r\nabout you is that you\'re broad in your sympathies. The first time I saw\r\nyou, that night on the Quebec boat, I said to myself: \'There\'s a man I\r\nwant to know. There\'s a human being.\' I was a little afraid of Mrs. March\r\nand the children, but I felt at home with you--thoroughly\r\ndomesticated--before I passed a word with you; and when you spoke first,\r\nand opened up with a joke over that fellow\'s tableful of light literature\r\nand Indian moccasins and birch-bark toy canoes and stereoscopic views, I\r\nknew that we were brothers--spiritual twins. I recognized the Western\r\nstyle of fun, and I thought, when you said you were from Boston, that it\r\nwas some of the same. But I see now that its being a cold fact, as far as\r\nthe last fifteen or twenty years count, is just so much gain. You know\r\nboth sections, and you can make this thing go, from ocean to ocean."\r\n\r\n"We might ring that into the prospectus, too," March suggested, with a\r\nsmile. "You might call the thing \'From Sea to Sea.\' By-the-way, what are\r\nyou going to call it?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t decided yet; that\'s one of the things I wanted to talk with\r\nyou about. I had thought of \'The Syndicate\'; but it sounds kind of dry,\r\nand doesn\'t seem to cover the ground exactly. I should like something\r\nthat would express the co-operative character of the thing, but I don\'t\r\nknow as I can get it."\r\n\r\n"Might call it \'The Mutual\'."\r\n\r\n"They\'d think it was an insurance paper. No, that won\'t do. But Mutual\r\ncomes pretty near the idea. If we could get something like that, it would\r\npique curiosity; and then if we could get paragraphs afloat explaining\r\nthat the contributors were to be paid according to the sales, it would be\r\na first-rate ad."\r\n\r\nHe bent a wide, anxious, inquiring smile upon March, who suggested,\r\nlazily: "You might call it \'The Round-Robin\'. That would express the\r\ncentral idea of irresponsibility. As I understand, everybody is to share\r\nthe profits and be exempt from the losses. Or, if I\'m wrong, and the\r\nreverse is true, you might call it \'The Army of Martyrs\'. Come, that\r\nsounds attractive, Fulkerson! Or what do you think of \'The Fifth Wheel\'?\r\nThat would forestall the criticism that there are too many literary\r\nperiodicals already. Or, if you want to put forward the idea of complete\r\nindependence, you could call it \'The Free Lance\'; or--"\r\n\r\n"Or \'The Hog on Ice\'--either stand up or fall down, you know," Fulkerson\r\nbroke in coarsely. "But we\'ll leave the name of the magazine till we get\r\nthe editor. I see the poison\'s beginning to work in you, March; and if I\r\nhad time I\'d leave the result to time. But I haven\'t. I\'ve got to know\r\ninside of the next week. To come down to business with you, March, I\r\nsha\'n\'t start this thing unless I can get you to take hold of it."\r\n\r\nHe seemed to expect some acknowledgment, and March said, "Well, that\'s\r\nvery nice of you, Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; no, sir! I\'ve always liked you and wanted you ever since we met\r\nthat first night. I had this thing inchoately in my mind then, when I was\r\ntelling you about the newspaper syndicate business--beautiful vision of a\r\nlot of literary fellows breaking loose from the bondage of publishers and\r\nplaying it alone--"\r\n\r\n"You might call it \'The Lone Hand\'; that would be attractive," March\r\ninterrupted. "The whole West would know what you meant."\r\n\r\nFulkerson was talking seriously, and March was listening seriously; but\r\nthey both broke off and laughed. Fulkerson got down off the table and\r\nmade some turns about the room. It was growing late; the October sun had\r\nleft the top of the tall windows; it was still clear day, but it would\r\nsoon be twilight; they had been talking a long time. Fulkerson came and\r\nstood with his little feet wide apart, and bent his little lean, square\r\nface on March. "See here! How much do you get out of this thing here,\r\nanyway?"\r\n\r\n"The insurance business?" March hesitated a moment and then said, with a\r\ncertain effort of reserve, "At present about three thousand." He looked\r\nup at Fulkerson with a glance, as if he had a mind to enlarge upon the\r\nfact, and then dropped his eyes without saying more.\r\n\r\nWhether Fulkerson had not thought it so much or not, he said: "Well, I\'ll\r\ngive you thirty-five hundred. Come! And your chances in the success."\r\n\r\n"We won\'t count the chances in the success. And I don\'t believe\r\nthirty-five hundred would go any further in New York than three thousand\r\nin Boston."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t live on three thousand here?"\r\n\r\n"No; my wife has a little property."\r\n\r\n"Well, she won\'t lose the income if you go to New York. I suppose you pay\r\nten or twelve hundred a year for your house here. You can get plenty of\r\nflats in New York for the same money; and I understand you can get all\r\nsorts of provisions for less than you pay now--three or four cents on the\r\npound. Come!"\r\n\r\nThis was by no means the first talk they had had about the matter; every\r\nthree or four months during the past two years the syndicate man had\r\ndropped in upon March to air the scheme and to get his impressions of it.\r\nThis had happened so often that it had come to be a sort of joke between\r\nthem. But now Fulkerson clearly meant business, and March had a struggle\r\nto maintain himself in a firm poise of refusal.\r\n\r\n"I dare say it wouldn\'t--or it needn\'t--cost so very much more, but I\r\ndon\'t want to go to New York; or my wife doesn\'t. It\'s the same thing."\r\n\r\n"A good deal samer," Fulkerson admitted.\r\n\r\nMarch did not quite like his candor, and he went on with dignity. "It\'s\r\nvery natural she shouldn\'t. She has always lived in Boston; she\'s\r\nattached to the place. Now, if you were going to start \'The Fifth Wheel\'\r\nin Boston--"\r\n\r\nFulkerson slowly and sadly shook his head, but decidedly. "Wouldn\'t do.\r\nYou might as well say St. Louis or Cincinnati. There\'s only one city that\r\nbelongs to the whole country, and that\'s New York."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," sighed March; "and Boston belongs to the Bostonians, but\r\nthey like you to make yourself at home while you\'re visiting."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll agree to make phrases like that, right along, and get them\r\ninto \'The Round-Robin\' somehow, I\'ll say four thousand," said Fulkerson.\r\n"You think it over now, March. You talk it over with Mrs. March; I know\r\nyou will, anyway; and I might as well make a virtue of advising you to do\r\nit. Tell her I advised you to do it, and you let me know before next\r\nSaturday what you\'ve decided."\r\n\r\nMarch shut down the rolling top of his desk in the corner of the room,\r\nand walked Fulkerson out before him. It was so late that the last of the\r\nchore-women who washed down the marble halls and stairs of the great\r\nbuilding had wrung out her floor-cloth and departed, leaving spotless\r\nstone and a clean, damp smell in the darkening corridors behind her.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t offer you such swell quarters in New York, March," Fulkerson\r\nsaid, as he went tack-tacking down the steps with his small boot-heels.\r\n"But I\'ve got my eye on a little house round in West Eleventh Street that\r\nI\'m going to fit up for my bachelor\'s hall in the third story, and adapt\r\nfor \'The Lone Hand\' in the first and second, if this thing goes through;\r\nand I guess we\'ll be pretty comfortable. It\'s right on the Sand Strip--no\r\nmalaria of any kind."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I\'m going to share its salubrity with you yet," March\r\nsighed, in an obvious travail which gave Fulkerson hopes.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you are," he coaxed. "Now, you talk it over with your wife. You\r\ngive her a fair, unprejudiced chance at the thing on its merits, and I\'m\r\nvery much mistaken in Mrs. March if she doesn\'t tell you to go in and\r\nwin. We\'re bound to win!"\r\n\r\nThey stood on the outside steps of the vast edifice beetling like a\r\ngranite crag above them, with the stone groups of an allegory of\r\nlife-insurance foreshortened in the bas-relief overhead. March absently\r\nlifted his eyes to it. It was suddenly strange after so many years\'\r\nfamiliarity, and so was the well-known street in its Saturday-evening\r\nsolitude. He asked himself, with prophetic homesickness, if it were an\r\nomen of what was to be. But he only said, musingly: "A fortnightly. You\r\nknow that didn\'t work in England. The fortnightly is published once a\r\nmonth now."\r\n\r\n"It works in France," Fulkerson retorted. "The \'Revue des Deux Mondes\' is\r\nstill published twice a month. I guess we can make it work in\r\nAmerica--with illustrations."\r\n\r\n"Going to have illustrations?"\r\n\r\n"My dear boy! What are you giving me? Do I look like the sort of lunatic\r\nwho would start a thing in the twilight of the nineteenth century without\r\nillustrations? Come off!"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that complicates it! I don\'t know anything about art." March\'s look\r\nof discouragement confessed the hold the scheme had taken upon him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to!" Fulkerson retorted. "Don\'t you suppose I shall\r\nhave an art man?"\r\n\r\n"And will they--the artists--work at a reduced rate, too, like the\r\nwriters, with the hopes of a share in the success?"\r\n\r\n"Of course they will! And if I want any particular man, for a card, I\'ll\r\npay him big money besides. But I can get plenty of first-rate sketches on\r\nmy own terms. You\'ll see! They\'ll pour in!"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Fulkerson," said March, "you\'d better call this fortnightly\r\nof yours \'The Madness of the Half-Moon\'; or \'Bedlam Broke Loose\'\r\nwouldn\'t be bad! Why do you throw away all your hard earnings on such a\r\ncrazy venture? Don\'t do it!" The kindness which March had always felt, in\r\nspite of his wife\'s first misgivings and reservations, for the merry,\r\nhopeful, slangy, energetic little creature trembled in his voice. They\r\nhad both formed a friendship for Fulkerson during the week they were\r\ntogether in Quebec. When he was not working the newspapers there, he went\r\nabout with them over the familiar ground they were showing their\r\nchildren, and was simply grateful for the chance, as well as very\r\nentertaining about it all. The children liked him, too; when they got the\r\nclew to his intention, and found that he was not quite serious in many of\r\nthe things he said, they thought he was great fun. They were always glad\r\nwhen their father brought him home on the occasion of Fulkerson\'s visits\r\nto Boston; and Mrs. March, though of a charier hospitality, welcomed\r\nFulkerson with a grateful sense of his admiration for her husband. He had\r\na way of treating March with deference, as an older and abler man, and of\r\nqualifying the freedom he used toward every one with an implication that\r\nMarch tolerated it voluntarily, which she thought very sweet and even\r\nrefined.\r\n\r\n"Ah, now you\'re talking like a man and a brother," said Fulkerson. "Why,\r\nMarch, old man, do you suppose I\'d come on here and try to talk you into\r\nthis thing if I wasn\'t morally, if I wasn\'t perfectly, sure of success?\r\nThere isn\'t any if or and about it. I know my ground, every inch; and I\r\ndon\'t stand alone on it," he added, with a significance which did not\r\nescape March. "When you\'ve made up your mind I can give you the proof;\r\nbut I\'m not at liberty now to say anything more. I tell you it\'s going to\r\nbe a triumphal march from the word go, with coffee and lemonade for the\r\nprocession along the whole line. All you\'ve got to do is to fall in." He\r\nstretched out his hand to March. "You let me know as soon as you can."\r\n\r\nMarch deferred taking his hand till he could ask, "Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Parker House. Take the eleven for New York to-night."\r\n\r\n"I thought I might walk your way." March looked at his watch. "But I\r\nshouldn\'t have time. Goodbye!"\r\n\r\nHe now let Fulkerson have his hand, and they exchanged a cordial\r\npressure. Fulkerson started away at a quick, light pace. Half a block off\r\nhe stopped, turned round, and, seeing March still standing where he had\r\nleft him, he called back, joyously, "I\'ve got the name!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Every Other Week."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t bad."\r\n\r\n"Ta-ta!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAll the way up to the South End March mentally prolonged his talk with\r\nFulkerson, and at his door in Nankeen Square he closed the parley with a\r\nplump refusal to go to New York on any terms. His daughter Bella was\r\nlying in wait for him in the hall, and she threw her arms round his neck\r\nwith the exuberance of her fourteen years and with something of the\r\nhistrionic intention of her sex. He pressed on, with her clinging about\r\nhim, to the library, and, in the glow of his decision against Fulkerson,\r\nkissed his wife, where she sat by the study lamp reading the Transcript\r\nthrough her first pair of eye-glasses: it was agreed in the family that\r\nshe looked distinguished in them, or, at any rate, cultivated. She took\r\nthem off to give him a glance of question, and their son Tom looked up\r\nfrom his book for a moment; he was in his last year at the high school,\r\nand was preparing for Harvard.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t get away from the office till half-past five," March explained\r\nto his wife\'s glance, "and then I walked. I suppose dinner\'s waiting. I\'m\r\nsorry, but I won\'t do it any more."\r\n\r\nAt table he tried to be gay with Bella, who babbled at him with a voluble\r\npertness which her brother had often advised her parents to check in her,\r\nunless they wanted her to be universally despised.\r\n\r\n"Papa!" she shouted at last, "you\'re not listening!" As soon as possible\r\nhis wife told the children they might be excused. Then she asked, "What\r\nis it, Basil?"\r\n\r\n"What is what?" he retorted, with a specious brightness that did not\r\navail.\r\n\r\n"What is on your mind?"\r\n\r\n"How do you know there\'s anything?"\r\n\r\n"Your kissing me so when you came in, for one thing."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I always kiss you when I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Not now. I suppose it isn\'t necessary any more. \'Cela va sans baiser.\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I guess it\'s so; we get along without the symbolism now." He\r\nstopped, but she knew that he had not finished.\r\n\r\n"Is it about your business? Have they done anything more?"\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m still in the dark. I don\'t know whether they mean to supplant\r\nme, or whether they ever did. But I wasn\'t thinking about that. Fulkerson\r\nhas been to see me again."\r\n\r\n"Fulkerson?" She brightened at the name, and March smiled, too. "Why\r\ndidn\'t you bring him to dinner?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to talk with you. Then you do like him?"\r\n\r\n"What has that got to do with it, Basil?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing! nothing! That is, he was boring away about that scheme of his\r\nagain. He\'s got it into definite shape at last."\r\n\r\n"What shape?"\r\n\r\nMarch outlined it for her, and his wife seized its main features with the\r\nintuitive sense of affairs which makes women such good business-men when\r\nthey will let it.\r\n\r\n"It sounds perfectly crazy," she said, finally. "But it mayn\'t be. The\r\nonly thing I didn\'t like about Mr. Fulkerson was his always wanting to\r\nchance things. But what have you got to do with it?"\r\n\r\n"What have I got to do with it?" March toyed with the delay the question\r\ngave him; then he said, with a sort of deprecatory laugh: "It seems that\r\nFulkerson has had his eye on me ever since we met that night on the\r\nQuebec boat. I opened up pretty freely to him, as you do to a man you\r\nnever expect to see again, and when I found he was in that newspaper\r\nsyndicate business I told him about my early literary ambitions--"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t say that I ever discouraged them, Basil," his wife put in. "I\r\nshould have been willing, any time, to give up everything for them."\r\n\r\n"Well, he says that I first suggested this brilliant idea to him. Perhaps\r\nI did; I don\'t remember. When he told me about his supplying literature\r\nto newspapers for simultaneous publication, he says I asked: \'Why not\r\napply the principle of co-operation to a magazine, and run it in the\r\ninterest of the contributors?\' and that set him to thinking, and he\r\nthought out his plan of a periodical which should pay authors and artists\r\na low price outright for their work and give them a chance of the profits\r\nin the way of a percentage. After all, it isn\'t so very different from\r\nthe chances an author takes when he publishes a book. And Fulkerson\r\nthinks that the novelty of the thing would pique public curiosity, if it\r\ndidn\'t arouse public sympathy. And the long and short of it is, Isabel,\r\nthat he wants me to help edit it."\r\n\r\n"To edit it?" His wife caught her breath, and she took a little time to\r\nrealize the fact, while she stared hard at her husband to make sure he\r\nwas not joking.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He says he owes it all to me; that I invented the idea--the\r\ngerm--the microbe."\r\n\r\nHis wife had now realized the fact, at least in a degree that excluded\r\ntrifling with it. "That is very honorable of Mr. Fulkerson; and if he\r\nowes it to you, it was the least he could do." Having recognized her\r\nhusband\'s claim to the honor done him, she began to kindle with a sense\r\nof the honor itself and the value of the opportunity. "It\'s a very high\r\ncompliment to you, Basil--a very high compliment. And you could give up\r\nthis wretched insurance business that you\'ve always hated so, and that\'s\r\nmaking you so unhappy now that you think they\'re going to take it from\r\nyou. Give it up and take Mr. Fulkerson\'s offer! It\'s a perfect\r\ninterposition, coming just at this time! Why, do it! Mercy!" she suddenly\r\narrested herself, "he wouldn\'t expect you to get along on the possible\r\nprofits?" Her face expressed the awfulness of the notion.\r\n\r\nMarch smiled reassuringly, and waited to give himself the pleasure of the\r\nsensation he meant to give her. "If I\'ll make striking phrases for it and\r\nedit it, too, he\'ll give me four thousand dollars."\r\n\r\nHe leaned back in his chair, and stuck his hands deep into his pockets,\r\nand watched his wife\'s face, luminous with the emotions that flashed\r\nthrough her mind--doubt, joy, anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Basil! You don\'t mean it! Why, take it! Take it instantly! Oh, what a\r\nthing to happen! Oh, what luck! But you deserve it, if you first\r\nsuggested it. What an escape, what a triumph over all those hateful\r\ninsurance people! Oh, Basil, I\'m afraid he\'ll change his mind! You ought\r\nto have accepted on the spot. You might have known I would approve, and\r\nyou could so easily have taken it back if I didn\'t. Telegraph him now!\r\nRun right out with the despatch--Or we can send Tom!"\r\n\r\nIn these imperatives of Mrs. March\'s there was always much of the\r\nconditional. She meant that he should do what she said, if it were\r\nentirely right; and she never meant to be considered as having urged him.\r\n\r\n"And suppose his enterprise went wrong?" her husband suggested.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t go wrong. Hasn\'t he made a success of his syndicate?"\r\n\r\n"He says so--yes."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, it stands to reason that he\'ll succeed in this, too. He\r\nwouldn\'t undertake it if he didn\'t know it would succeed; he must have\r\ncapital."\r\n\r\n"It will take a great deal to get such a thing going; and even if he\'s\r\ngot an Angel behind him--"\r\n\r\nShe caught at the word--"An Angel?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s what the theatrical people call a financial backer. He dropped a\r\nhint of something of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Of course, he\'s got an Angel," said his wife, promptly adopting the\r\nword. "And even if he hadn\'t, still, Basil, I should be willing to have\r\nyou risk it. The risk isn\'t so great, is it? We shouldn\'t be ruined if it\r\nfailed altogether. With our stocks we have two thousand a year, anyway,\r\nand we could pinch through on that till you got into some other business\r\nafterward, especially if we\'d saved something out of your salary while it\r\nlasted. Basil, I want you to try it! I know it will give you a new lease\r\nof life to have a congenial occupation." March laughed, but his wife\r\npersisted. "I\'m all for your trying it, Basil; indeed I am. If it\'s an\r\nexperiment, you can give it up."\r\n\r\n"It can give me up, too."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense! I guess there\'s not much fear of that. Now, I want you to\r\ntelegraph Mr. Fulkerson, so that he\'ll find the despatch waiting for him\r\nwhen he gets to New York. I\'ll take the whole responsibility, Basil, and\r\nI\'ll risk all the consequences."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMarch\'s face had sobered more and more as she followed one hopeful burst\r\nwith another, and now it expressed a positive pain. But he forced a smile\r\nand said: "There\'s a little condition attached. Where did you suppose it\r\nwas to be published?"\r\n\r\n"Why, in Boston, of course. Where else should it be published?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him for the intention of his question so searchingly that\r\nhe quite gave up the attempt to be gay about it. "No," he said, gravely,\r\n"it\'s to be published in New York."\r\n\r\nShe fell back in her chair. "In New York?" She leaned forward over the\r\ntable toward him, as if to make sure that she heard aright, and said,\r\nwith all the keen reproach that he could have expected: "In New York,\r\nBasil! Oh, how could you have let me go on?"\r\n\r\nHe had a sufficiently rueful face in owning: "I oughtn\'t to have done it,\r\nbut I got started wrong. I couldn\'t help putting the best foot, forward\r\nat first--or as long as the whole thing was in the air. I didn\'t know\r\nthat you would take so much to the general enterprise, or else I should\r\nhave mentioned the New York condition at once; but, of course, that puts\r\nan end to it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," she assented, sadly. "We COULDN\'T go to New York."\r\n\r\n"No, I know that," he said; and with this a perverse desire to tempt her\r\nto the impossibility awoke in him, though he was really quite cold about\r\nthe affair himself now. "Fulkerson thought we could get a nice flat in\r\nNew York for about what the interest and taxes came to here, and\r\nprovisions are cheaper. But I should rather not experiment at my time of\r\nlife. If I could have been caught younger, I might have been inured to\r\nNew York, but I don\'t believe I could stand it now."\r\n\r\n"How I hate to have you talk that way, Basil! You are young enough to try\r\nanything--anywhere; but you know I don\'t like New York. I don\'t approve\r\nof it. It\'s so big, and so hideous! Of course I shouldn\'t mind that; but\r\nI\'ve always lived in Boston, and the children were born and have all\r\ntheir friendships and associations here." She added, with the\r\nhelplessness that discredited her good sense and did her injustice, "I\r\nhave just got them both into the Friday afternoon class at Papanti\'s, and\r\nyou know how difficult that is."\r\n\r\nMarch could not fail to take advantage of an occasion like this. "Well,\r\nthat alone ought to settle it. Under the circumstances, it would be\r\nflying in the face of Providence to leave Boston. The mere fact of a\r\nbrilliant opening like that offered me on \'The Microbe,\' and the halcyon\r\nfuture which Fulkerson promises if we\'ll come to New York, is as dust in\r\nthe balance against the advantages of the Friday afternoon class."\r\n\r\n"Basil," she appealed, solemnly, "have I ever interfered with your\r\ncareer?"\r\n\r\n"I never had any for you to interfere with, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Basil! Haven\'t I always had faith in you? And don\'t you suppose that if\r\nI thought it would really be for your advancement I would go to New York\r\nor anywhere with you?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, I don\'t," he teased. "If it would be for my salvation, yes,\r\nperhaps; but not short of that; and I should have to prove by a cloud of\r\nwitnesses that it would. I don\'t blame you. I wasn\'t born in Boston, but\r\nI understand how you feel. And really, my dear," he added, without irony,\r\n"I never seriously thought of asking you to go to New York. I was dazzled\r\nby Fulkerson\'s offer, I\'ll own that; but his choice of me as editor\r\nsapped my confidence in him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to hear you say that, Basil," she entreated.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course there were mitigating circumstances. I could see that\r\nFulkerson meant to keep the whip-hand himself, and that was reassuring.\r\nAnd, besides, if the Reciprocity Life should happen not to want my\r\nservices any longer, it wouldn\'t be quite like giving up a certainty;\r\nthough, as a matter of business, I let Fulkerson get that impression; I\r\nfelt rather sneaking to do it. But if the worst comes to the worst, I can\r\nlook about for something to do in Boston; and, anyhow, people don\'t\r\nstarve on two thousand a year, though it\'s convenient to have five. The\r\nfact is, I\'m too old to change so radically. If you don\'t like my saying\r\nthat, then you are, Isabel, and so are the children. I\'ve no right to\r\ntake them from the home we\'ve made, and to change the whole course of\r\ntheir lives, unless I can assure them of something, and I can\'t assure\r\nthem of anything. Boston is big enough for us, and it\'s certainly\r\nprettier than New York. I always feel a little proud of hailing from\r\nBoston; my pleasure in the place mounts the farther I get away from it.\r\nBut I do appreciate it, my dear; I\'ve no more desire to leave it than you\r\nhave. You may be sure that if you don\'t want to take the children out of\r\nthe Friday afternoon class, I don\'t want to leave my library here, and\r\nall the ways I\'ve got set in. We\'ll keep on. Very likely the company\r\nwon\'t supplant me, and if it does, and Watkins gets the place, he\'ll give\r\nme a subordinate position of some sort. Cheer up, Isabel! I have put\r\nSatan and his angel, Fulkerson, behind me, and it\'s all right. Let\'s go\r\nin to the children."\r\n\r\nHe came round the table to Isabel, where she sat in a growing\r\ndistraction, and lifted her by the waist from her chair.\r\n\r\nShe sighed deeply. "Shall we tell the children about it?"\r\n\r\n"No. What\'s the use, now?"\r\n\r\n"There wouldn\'t be any," she assented. When they entered the family room,\r\nwhere the boy and girl sat on either side of the lamp working out the\r\nlessons for Monday which they had left over from the day before, she\r\nasked, "Children, how would you like to live in New York?"\r\n\r\nBella made haste to get in her word first. "And give up the Friday\r\nafternoon class?" she wailed.\r\n\r\nTom growled from his book, without lifting his eyes: "I shouldn\'t want to\r\ngo to Columbia. They haven\'t got any dormitories, and you have to board\r\nround anywhere. Are you going to New York?" He now deigned to look up at\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n"No, Tom. You and Bella have decided me against it. Your perspective\r\nshows the affair in its true proportions. I had an offer to go to New\r\nYork, but I\'ve refused it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMarch\'s irony fell harmless from the children\'s preoccupation with their\r\nown affairs, but he knew that his wife felt it, and this added to the\r\nbitterness which prompted it. He blamed her for letting her provincial\r\nnarrowness prevent his accepting Fulkerson\'s offer quite as much as if he\r\nhad otherwise entirely wished to accept it. His world, like most worlds,\r\nhad been superficially a disappointment. He was no richer than at the\r\nbeginning, though in marrying he had given up some tastes, some\r\npreferences, some aspirations, in the hope of indulging them later, with\r\nlarger means and larger leisure. His wife had not urged him to do it; in\r\nfact, her pride, as she said, was in his fitness for the life he had\r\nrenounced; but she had acquiesced, and they had been very happy together.\r\nThat is to say, they made up their quarrels or ignored them.\r\n\r\nThey often accused each other of being selfish and indifferent, but she\r\nknew that he would always sacrifice himself for her and the children; and\r\nhe, on his part, with many gibes and mockeries, wholly trusted in her.\r\nThey had grown practically tolerant of each other\'s disagreeable traits;\r\nand the danger that really threatened them was that they should grow too\r\nwell satisfied with themselves, if not with each other. They were not\r\nsentimental, they were rather matter-of-fact in their motives; but they\r\nhad both a sort of humorous fondness for sentimentality. They liked to\r\nplay with the romantic, from the safe vantage-ground of their real\r\npracticality, and to divine the poetry of the commonplace. Their peculiar\r\npoint of view separated them from most other people, with whom their\r\nmeans of self-comparison were not so good since their marriage as before.\r\nThen they had travelled and seen much of the world, and they had formed\r\ntastes which they had not always been able to indulge, but of which they\r\nfelt that the possession reflected distinction on them. It enabled them\r\nto look down upon those who were without such tastes; but they were not\r\nill-natured, and so they did not look down so much with contempt as with\r\namusement. In their unfashionable neighborhood they had the fame of being\r\nnot exclusive precisely, but very much wrapped up in themselves and their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMrs. March was reputed to be very cultivated, and Mr. March even more so,\r\namong the simpler folk around them. Their house had some good pictures,\r\nwhich her aunt had brought home from Europe in more affluent days, and it\r\nabounded in books on which he spent more than he ought. They had\r\nbeautified it in every way, and had unconsciously taken credit to themselves\r\nfor it. They felt, with a glow almost of virtue, how perfectly it\r\nfitted their lives and their children\'s, and they believed that somehow\r\nit expressed their characters--that it was like them. They went out very\r\nlittle; she remained shut up in its refinement, working the good of her\r\nown; and he went to his business, and hurried back to forget it, and\r\ndream his dream of intellectual achievement in the flattering atmosphere\r\nof her sympathy. He could not conceal from himself that his divided life\r\nwas somewhat like Charles Lamb\'s, and there were times when, as he had\r\nexpressed to Fulkerson, he believed that its division was favorable to\r\nthe freshness of his interest in literature. It certainly kept it a high\r\nprivilege, a sacred refuge. Now and then he wrote something, and got it\r\nprinted after long delays, and when they met on the St. Lawrence\r\nFulkerson had some of March\'s verses in his pocket-book, which he had cut\r\nout of a stray newspaper and carried about for years, because they pleased\r\nhis fancy so much; they formed an immediate bond of union between the men\r\nwhen their authorship was traced and owned, and this gave a pretty color\r\nof romance to their acquaintance. But, for the most part, March was\r\nsatisfied to read. He was proud of reading critically, and he kept in the\r\ncurrent of literary interests and controversies. It all seemed to him,\r\nand to his wife at second-hand, very meritorious; he could not help\r\ncontrasting his life and its inner elegance with that of other men who\r\nhad no such resources. He thought that he was not arrogant about it,\r\nbecause he did full justice to the good qualities of those other people;\r\nhe congratulated himself upon the democratic instincts which enabled him\r\nto do this; and neither he nor his wife supposed that they were selfish\r\npersons. On the contrary, they were very sympathetic; there was no good\r\ncause that they did not wish well; they had a generous scorn of all kinds\r\nof narrow-heartedness; if it had ever come into their way to sacrifice\r\nthemselves for others, they thought they would have done so, but they\r\nnever asked why it had not come in their way. They were very gentle and\r\nkind, even when most elusive; and they taught their children to loathe\r\nall manner of social cruelty. March was of so watchful a conscience in\r\nsome respects that he denied himself the pensive pleasure of lapsing into\r\nthe melancholy of unfulfilled aspirations; but he did not see that, if he\r\nhad abandoned them, it had been for what he held dearer; generally he\r\nfelt as if he had turned from them with a high, altruistic aim. The\r\npractical expression of his life was that it was enough to provide well\r\nfor his family; to have cultivated tastes, and to gratify them to the\r\nextent of his means; to be rather distinguished, even in the\r\nsimplification of his desires. He believed, and his wife believed, that\r\nif the time ever came when he really wished to make a sacrifice to the\r\nfulfilment of the aspirations so long postponed, she would be ready to\r\njoin with heart and hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to her room from his library, where she left him the whole\r\nevening with the children, he found her before the glass thoughtfully\r\nremoving the first dismantling pin from her back hair.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help feeling," she grieved into the mirror, "that it\'s I who\r\nkeep you from accepting that offer. I know it is! I could go West with\r\nyou, or into a new country--anywhere; but New York terrifies me. I don\'t\r\nlike New York, I never did; it disheartens and distracts me; I can\'t find\r\nmyself in it; I shouldn\'t know how to shop. I know I\'m foolish and narrow\r\nand provincial," she went on, "but I could never have any inner quiet in\r\nNew York; I couldn\'t live in the spirit there. I suppose people do. It\r\ncan\'t be that all these millions--\'\r\n\r\n"Oh, not so bad as that!" March interposed, laughing. "There aren\'t quite\r\ntwo."\r\n\r\n"I thought there were four or five. Well, no matter. You see what I am,\r\nBasil. I\'m terribly limited. I couldn\'t make my sympathies go round two\r\nmillion people; I should be wretched. I suppose I\'m standing in the way\r\nof your highest interest, but I can\'t help it. We took each other for\r\nbetter or worse, and you must try to bear with me--" She broke off and\r\nbegan to cry.\r\n\r\n"Stop it!" shouted March. "I tell you I never cared anything for\r\nFulkerson\'s scheme or entertained it seriously, and I shouldn\'t if he\'d\r\nproposed to carry it out in Boston." This was not quite true, but in the\r\nretrospect it seemed sufficiently so for the purposes of argument. "Don\'t\r\nsay another word about it. The thing\'s over now, and I don\'t want to\r\nthink of it any more. We couldn\'t change its nature if we talked all\r\nnight. But I want you to understand that it isn\'t your limitations that\r\nare in the way. It\'s mine. I shouldn\'t have the courage to take such a\r\nplace; I don\'t think I\'m fit for it, and that\'s the long and short of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you don\'t know how it hurts me to have you say that, Basil."\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as they sat together at breakfast, without the\r\nchildren, whom they let lie late on Sunday, Mrs. March said to her\r\nhusband, silent over his fish-balls and baked beans: "We will go to New\r\nYork. I\'ve decided it."\r\n\r\n"Well, it takes two to decide that," March retorted. "We are not going to\r\nNew York."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we are. I\'ve thought it out. Now, listen."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m willing to listen," he consented, airily.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve always wanted to get out of the insurance business, and now with\r\nthat fear of being turned out which you have you mustn\'t neglect this\r\noffer. I suppose it has its risks, but it\'s a risk keeping on as we are;\r\nand perhaps you will make a great success of it. I do want you to try,\r\nBasil. If I could once feel that you had fairly seen what you could do in\r\nliterature, I should die happy."\r\n\r\n"Not immediately after, I hope," he suggested, taking the second cup of\r\ncoffee she had been pouring out for him. "And Boston?"\r\n\r\n"We needn\'t make a complete break. We can keep this place for the\r\npresent, anyway; we could let it for the winter, and come back in the\r\nsummer next year. It would be change enough from New York."\r\n\r\n"Fulkerson and I hadn\'t got as far as to talk of a vacation."\r\n\r\n"No matter. The children and I could come. And if you didn\'t like New\r\nYork, or the enterprise failed, you could get into something in Boston\r\nagain; and we have enough to live on till you did. Yes, Basil, I\'m\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"I can see by the way your chin trembles that nothing could stop you. You\r\nmay go to New York if you wish, Isabel, but I shall stay here."\r\n\r\n"Be serious, Basil. I\'m in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Serious? If I were any more serious I should shed tears. Come, my dear,\r\nI know what you mean, and if I had my heart set on this thing--Fulkerson\r\nalways calls it \'this thing\' I would cheerfully accept any sacrifice you\r\ncould make to it. But I\'d rather not offer you up on a shrine I don\'t\r\nfeel any particular faith in. I\'m very comfortable where I am; that is, I\r\nknow just where the pinch comes, and if it comes harder, why, I\'ve got\r\nused to bearing that kind of pinch. I\'m too old to change pinches."\r\n\r\n"Now, that does decide me."\r\n\r\n"It decides me, too."\r\n\r\n"I will take all the responsibility, Basil," she pleaded.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; but you\'ll hand it back to me as soon as you\'ve carried your\r\npoint with it. There\'s nothing mean about you, Isabel, where\r\nresponsibility is concerned. No; if I do this thing--Fulkerson again? I\r\ncan\'t get away from \'this thing\'; it\'s ominous--I must do it because I\r\nwant to do it, and not because you wish that you wanted me to do it. I\r\nunderstand your position, Isabel, and that you\'re really acting from a\r\ngenerous impulse, but there\'s nothing so precarious at our time of life\r\nas a generous impulse. When we were younger we could stand it; we could\r\ngive way to it and take the consequences. But now we can\'t bear it. We\r\nmust act from cold reason even in the ardor of self-sacrifice."\r\n\r\n"Oh, as if you did that!" his wife retorted.\r\n\r\n"Is that any cause why you shouldn\'t?" She could not say that it was, and\r\nhe went on triumphantly:\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t take you away from the only safe place on the planet and\r\nplunge you into the most perilous, and then have you say in your\r\nrevulsion of feeling that you were all against it from the first, and you\r\ngave way because you saw I had my heart set on it." He supposed he was\r\ntreating the matter humorously, but in this sort of banter between\r\nhusband and wife there is always much more than the joking. March had\r\nseen some pretty feminine inconsistencies and trepidations which once\r\ncharmed him in his wife hardening into traits of middle-age which were\r\nvery like those of less interesting older women. The sight moved him with\r\na kind of pathos, but he felt the result hindering and vexatious.\r\n\r\nShe now retorted that if he did not choose to take her at her word he\r\nneed not, but that whatever he did she should have nothing to reproach\r\nherself with; and, at least, he could not say that she had trapped him\r\ninto anything.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by trapping?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call it," she answered; "but when you get me to\r\ncommit myself to a thing by leaving out the most essential point, I call\r\nit trapping."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you stop at trapping, if you think I got you to favor\r\nFulkerson\'s scheme and then sprung New York on you. I don\'t suppose you\r\ndo, though. But I guess we won\'t talk about it any more."\r\n\r\nHe went out for a long walk, and she went to her room. They lunched\r\nsilently together in the presence of their children, who knew that they\r\nhad been quarrelling, but were easily indifferent to the fact, as\r\nchildren get to be in such cases; nature defends their youth, and the\r\nunhappiness which they behold does not infect them. In the evening, after\r\nthe boy and girl had gone to bed, the father and mother resumed their\r\ntalk. He would have liked to take it up at the point from which it\r\nwandered into hostilities, for he felt it lamentable that a matter which\r\nso seriously concerned them should be confused in the fumes of senseless\r\nanger; and he was willing to make a tacit acknowledgment of his own error\r\nby recurring to the question, but she would not be content with this, and\r\nhe had to concede explicitly to her weakness that she really meant it\r\nwhen she had asked him to accept Fulkerson\'s offer. He said he knew that;\r\nand he began soberly to talk over their prospects in the event of their\r\ngoing to New York.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see you are going!" she twitted.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to stay," he answered, "and let them turn me out of my agency\r\nhere," and in this bitterness their talk ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nHis wife made no attempt to renew their talk before March went to his\r\nbusiness in the morning, and they parted in dry offence. Their experience\r\nwas that these things always came right of themselves at last, and they\r\nusually let them. He knew that she had really tried to consent to a thing\r\nthat was repugnant to her, and in his heart he gave her more credit for\r\nthe effort than he had allowed her openly. She knew that she had made it\r\nwith the reservation he accused her of, and that he had a right to feel\r\nsore at what she could not help. But he left her to brood over his\r\ningratitude, and she suffered him to go heavy and unfriended to meet the\r\nchances of the day. He said to himself that if she had assented cordially\r\nto the conditions of Fulkerson\'s offer, he would have had the courage to\r\ntake all the other risks himself, and would have had the satisfaction of\r\nresigning his place. As it was, he must wait till he was removed; and he\r\nfigured with bitter pleasure the pain she would feel when he came home\r\nsome day and told her he had been supplanted, after it was too late to\r\nclose with Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nHe found a letter on his desk from the secretary, "Dictated," in\r\ntypewriting, which briefly informed him that Mr. Hubbell, the Inspector\r\nof Agencies, would be in Boston on Wednesday, and would call at his\r\noffice during the forenoon. The letter was not different in tone from\r\nmany that he had formerly received; but the visit announced was out of\r\nthe usual order, and March believed he read his fate in it. During the\r\neighteen years of his connection with it--first as a subordinate in the\r\nBoston office, and finally as its general agent there--he had seen a good\r\nmany changes in the Reciprocity; presidents, vice-presidents, actuaries,\r\nand general agents had come and gone, but there had always seemed to be a\r\nrecognition of his efficiency, or at least sufficiency, and there had\r\nnever been any manner of trouble, no question of accounts, no apparent\r\ndissatisfaction with his management, until latterly, when there had begun\r\nto come from headquarters some suggestions of enterprise in certain ways,\r\nwhich gave him his first suspicions of his clerk Watkins\'s willingness to\r\nsucceed him; they embodied some of Watkins\'s ideas. The things proposed\r\nseemed to March undignified, and even vulgar; he had never thought\r\nhimself wanting in energy, though probably he had left the business to\r\ntake its own course in the old lines more than he realized. Things had\r\nalways gone so smoothly that he had sometimes fancied a peculiar regard\r\nfor him in the management, which he had the weakness to attribute to an\r\nappreciation of what he occasionally did in literature, though in saner\r\nmoments he felt how impossible this was. Beyond a reference from Mr.\r\nHubbell to some piece of March\'s which had happened to meet his eye, no\r\none in the management ever gave a sign of consciousness that their\r\nservice was adorned by an obscure literary man; and Mr. Hubbell himself\r\nhad the effect of regarding the excursions of March\'s pen as a sort of\r\njoke, and of winking at them; as he might have winked if once in a way he\r\nhad found him a little the gayer for dining.\r\n\r\nMarch wore through the day gloomily, but he had it on his conscience not\r\nto show any resentment toward Watkins, whom he suspected of wishing to\r\nsupplant him, and even of working to do so. Through this self-denial he\r\nreached a better mind concerning his wife. He determined not to make her\r\nsuffer needlessly, if the worst came to the worst; she would suffer\r\nenough, at the best, and till the worst came he would spare her, and not\r\nsay anything about the letter he had got.\r\n\r\nBut when they met, her first glance divined that something had happened,\r\nand her first question frustrated his generous intention. He had to tell\r\nher about the letter. She would not allow that it had any significance,\r\nbut she wished him to make an end of his anxieties and forestall whatever\r\nit might portend by resigning his place at once. She said she was quite\r\nready to go to New York; she had been thinking it all over, and now she\r\nreally wanted to go. He answered, soberly, that he had thought it over,\r\ntoo; and he did not wish to leave Boston, where he had lived so long, or\r\ntry a new way of life if he could help it. He insisted that he was quite\r\nselfish in this; in their concessions their quarrel vanished; they agreed\r\nthat whatever happened would be for the best; and the next day he went to\r\nhis office fortified for any event.\r\n\r\nHis destiny, if tragical, presented itself with an aspect which he might\r\nhave found comic if it had been another\'s destiny. Mr. Hubbell brought\r\nMarch\'s removal, softened in the guise of a promotion. The management at\r\nNew York, it appeared, had acted upon a suggestion of Mr. Hubbell\'s, and\r\nnow authorized him to offer March the editorship of the monthly paper\r\npublished in the interest of the company; his office would include the\r\nauthorship of circulars and leaflets in behalf of life-insurance, and\r\nwould give play to the literary talent which Mr. Hubbell had brought to\r\nthe attention of the management; his salary would be nearly as much as at\r\npresent, but the work would not take his whole time, and in a place like\r\nNew York he could get a great deal of outside writing, which they would\r\nnot object to his doing.\r\n\r\nMr. Hubbell seemed so sure of his acceptance of a place in every way\r\ncongenial to a man of literary tastes that March was afterward sorry he\r\ndismissed the proposition with obvious irony, and had needlessly hurt\r\nHubbell\'s feelings; but Mrs. March had no such regrets. She was only\r\nafraid that he had not made his rejection contemptuous enough. "And now,"\r\nshe said, "telegraph Mr. Fulkerson, and we will go at once."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I could still get Watkins\'s former place," March suggested.\r\n\r\n"Never!" she retorted. "Telegraph instantly!"\r\n\r\nThey were only afraid now that Fulkerson might have changed his mind, and\r\nthey had a wretched day in which they heard nothing from him. It ended\r\nwith his answering March\'s telegram in person. They were so glad of his\r\ncoming, and so touched by his satisfaction with his bargain, that they\r\nlaid all the facts of the case before him. He entered fully into March\'s\r\nsense of the joke latent in Mr. Hubbell\'s proposition, and he tried to\r\nmake Mrs. March believe that he shared her resentment of the indignity\r\noffered her husband.\r\n\r\nMarch made a show of willingness to release him in view of the changed\r\nsituation, saying that he held him to nothing. Fulkerson laughed, and\r\nasked him how soon he thought he could come on to New York. He refused to\r\nreopen the question of March\'s fitness with him; he said they had gone\r\ninto that thoroughly, but he recurred to it with Mrs. March, and\r\nconfirmed her belief in his good sense on all points. She had been from\r\nthe first moment defiantly confident of her husband\'s ability, but till\r\nshe had talked the matter over with Fulkerson she was secretly not sure\r\nof it; or, at least, she was not sure that March was not right in\r\ndistrusting himself. When she clearly understood, now, what Fulkerson\r\nintended, she had no longer a doubt. He explained how the enterprise\r\ndiffered from others, and how he needed for its direction a man who\r\ncombined general business experience and business ideas with a love for\r\nthe thing and a natural aptness for it. He did not want a young man, and\r\nyet he wanted youth--its freshness, its zest--such as March would feel in\r\na thing he could put his whole heart into. He would not run in ruts, like\r\nan old fellow who had got hackneyed; he would not have any hobbies; he\r\nwould not have any friends or any enemies. Besides, he would have to meet\r\npeople, and March was a man that people took to; she knew that herself;\r\nhe had a kind of charm. The editorial management was going to be kept in\r\nthe background, as far as the public was concerned; the public was to\r\nsuppose that the thing ran itself. Fulkerson did not care for a great\r\nliterary reputation in his editor--he implied that March had a very\r\npretty little one. At the same time the relations between the\r\ncontributors and the management were to be much more, intimate than\r\nusual. Fulkerson felt his personal disqualification for working the thing\r\nsocially, and he counted upon Mr. March for that; that was to say, he\r\ncounted upon Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nShe protested he must not count upon her; but it by no means disabled\r\nFulkerson\'s judgment in her view that March really seemed more than\r\nanything else a fancy of his. He had been a fancy of hers; and the sort\r\nof affectionate respect with which Fulkerson spoke of him laid forever\r\nsome doubt she had of the fineness of Fulkerson\'s manners and reconciled\r\nher to the graphic slanginess of his speech.\r\n\r\nThe affair was now irretrievable, but she gave her approval to it as\r\nsuperbly as if it were submitted in its inception. Only, Mr. Fulkerson\r\nmust not suppose she should ever like New York. She would not deceive him\r\non that point. She never should like it. She did not conceal, either,\r\nthat she did not like taking the children out of the Friday afternoon\r\nclass; and she did not believe that Tom would ever be reconciled to going\r\nto Columbia. She took courage from Fulkerson\'s suggestion that it was\r\npossible for Tom to come to Harvard even from New York; and she heaped\r\nhim with questions concerning the domiciliation of the family in that\r\ncity. He tried to know something about the matter, and he succeeded in\r\nseeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIn the uprooting and transplanting of their home that followed, Mrs.\r\nMarch often trembled before distant problems and possible contingencies,\r\nbut she was never troubled by present difficulties. She kept up with\r\ntireless energy; and in the moments of dejection and misgiving which\r\nharassed her husband she remained dauntless, and put heart into him when\r\nhe had lost it altogether.\r\n\r\nShe arranged to leave the children in the house with the servants, while\r\nshe went on with March to look up a dwelling of some sort in New York. It\r\nmade him sick to think of it; and, when it came to the point, he would\r\nrather have given up the whole enterprise. She had to nerve him to it, to\r\nrepresent more than once that now they had no choice but to make this\r\nexperiment. Every detail of parting was anguish to him. He got\r\nconsolation out of the notion of letting the house furnished for the\r\nwinter; that implied their return to it, but it cost him pangs of the\r\nkeenest misery to advertise it; and, when a tenant was actually found, it\r\nwas all he could do to give him the lease. He tried his wife\'s love and\r\npatience as a man must to whom the future is easy in the mass but\r\nterrible as it translates itself piecemeal into the present. He\r\nexperienced remorse in the presence of inanimate things he was going to\r\nleave as if they had sensibly reproached him, and an anticipative\r\nhomesickness that seemed to stop his heart. Again and again his wife had\r\nto make him reflect that his depression was not prophetic. She convinced\r\nhim of what he already knew, and persuaded him against his knowledge that\r\nhe could be keeping an eye out for something to take hold of in Boston if\r\nthey could not stand New York. She ended by telling him that it was too\r\nbad to make her comfort him in a trial that was really so much more a\r\ntrial to her. She had to support him in a last access of despair on their\r\nway to the Albany depot the morning they started to New York; but when\r\nthe final details had been dealt with, the tickets bought, the trunks\r\nchecked, and the handbags hung up in their car, and the future had massed\r\nitself again at a safe distance and was seven hours and two hundred miles\r\naway, his spirits began to rise and hers to sink. He would have been\r\nwilling to celebrate the taste, the domestic refinement, of the ladies\'\r\nwaiting-room in the depot, where they had spent a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore the train started. He said he did not believe there was another\r\nstation in the world where mahogany rocking-chairs were provided; that\r\nthe dull-red warmth of the walls was as cozy as an evening lamp, and that\r\nhe always hoped to see a fire kindled on that vast hearth and under that\r\naesthetic mantel, but he supposed now he never should. He said it was all\r\nvery different from that tunnel, the old Albany depot, where they had\r\nwaited the morning they went to New York when they were starting on their\r\nwedding journey.\r\n\r\n"The morning, Basil!" cried his wife. "We went at night; and we were\r\ngoing to take the boat, but it stormed so!" She gave him a glance of such\r\nreproach that he could not answer anything, and now she asked him whether\r\nhe supposed their cook and second girl would be contented with one of\r\nthose dark holes where they put girls to sleep in New York flats, and\r\nwhat she should do if Margaret, especially, left her. He ventured to\r\nsuggest that Margaret would probably like the city; but, if she left,\r\nthere were plenty of other girls to be had in New York. She replied that\r\nthere were none she could trust, and that she knew Margaret would not\r\nstay. He asked her why she took her, then--why she did not give her up at\r\nonce; and she answered that it would be inhuman to give her up just in\r\nthe edge of the winter. She had promised to keep her; and Margaret was\r\npleased with the notion of going to New York, where she had a cousin.\r\n\r\n"Then perhaps she\'ll be pleased with the notion of staying," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, much you know about it!" she retorted; and, in view of the\r\nhypothetical difficulty and his want of sympathy, she fell into a gloom,\r\nfrom which she roused herself at last by declaring that, if there was\r\nnothing else in the flat they took, there should be a light kitchen and a\r\nbright, sunny bedroom for Margaret. He expressed the belief that they\r\ncould easily find such a flat as that, and she denounced his fatal\r\noptimism, which buoyed him up in the absence of an undertaking and let\r\nhim drop into the depths of despair in its presence.\r\n\r\nHe owned this defect of temperament, but he said that it compensated the\r\nopposite in her character. "I suppose that\'s one of the chief uses of\r\nmarriage; people supplement one another, and form a pretty fair sort of\r\nhuman being together. The only drawback to the theory is that unmarried\r\npeople seem each as complete and whole as a married pair."\r\n\r\nShe refused to be amused; she turned her face to the window and put her\r\nhandkerchief up under her veil.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the dining-car was attached to their train that they were\r\nboth able to escape for an hour into the care-free mood of their earlier\r\ntravels, when they were so easily taken out of themselves. The time had\r\nbeen when they could have found enough in the conjectural fortunes and\r\ncharacters of their fellow-passengers to occupy them. This phase of their\r\nyouth had lasted long, and the world was still full of novelty and\r\ninterest for them; but it required all the charm of the dining-car now to\r\nlay the anxieties that beset them. It was so potent for the moment,\r\nhowever, that they could take an objective view at their sitting cozily\r\ndown there together, as if they had only themselves in the world. They\r\nwondered what the children were doing, the children who possessed them so\r\nintensely when present, and now, by a fantastic operation of absence,\r\nseemed almost non-existents. They tried to be homesick for them, but\r\nfailed; they recognized with comfortable self-abhorrence that this was\r\nterrible, but owned a fascination in being alone; at the same time, they\r\ncould not imagine how people felt who never had any children. They\r\ncontrasted the luxury of dining that way, with every advantage except a\r\nband of music, and the old way of rushing out to snatch a fearful joy at\r\nthe lunch-counters of the Worcester and Springfield and New Haven\r\nstations. They had not gone often to New York since their wedding\r\njourney, but they had gone often enough to have noted the change from the\r\nlunch-counter to the lunch-basket brought in the train, from which you\r\ncould subsist with more ease and dignity, but seemed destined to a\r\nsuperabundance of pickles, whatever you ordered.\r\n\r\nThey thought well of themselves now that they could be both critical and\r\ntolerant of flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another in\r\ntheir dinner, and they lingered over their coffee and watched the autumn\r\nlandscape through the windows.\r\n\r\n"Not quite so loud a pattern of calico this year," he said, with\r\npatronizing forbearance toward the painted woodlands whirling by. "Do you\r\nsee how the foreground next the train rushes from us and the background\r\nkeeps ahead of us, while the middle distance seems stationary? I don\'t\r\nthink I ever noticed that effect before. There ought to be something\r\nliterary in it: retreating past and advancing future and deceitfully\r\npermanent present--something like that?"\r\n\r\nHis wife brushed some crumbs from her lap before rising. "Yes. You\r\nmustn\'t waste any of these ideas now."\r\n\r\n"Oh no; it would be money out of Fulkerson\'s pocket."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThey went to a quiet hotel far down-town, and took a small apartment\r\nwhich they thought they could easily afford for the day or two they need\r\nspend in looking up a furnished flat. They were used to staying at this\r\nhotel when they came on for a little outing in New York, after some rigid\r\nwinter in Boston, at the time of the spring exhibitions. They were\r\nremembered there from year to year; the colored call-boys, who never\r\nseemed to get any older, smiled upon them, and the clerk called March by\r\nname even before he registered. He asked if Mrs. March were with him, and\r\nsaid then he supposed they would want their usual quarters; and in a\r\nmoment they were domesticated in a far interior that seemed to have been\r\nwaiting for them in a clean, quiet, patient disoccupation ever since they\r\nleft it two years before. The little parlor, with its gilt paper and\r\nebonized furniture, was the lightest of the rooms, but it was not very\r\nlight at noonday without the gas, which the bell-boy now flared up for\r\nthem. The uproar of the city came to it in a soothing murmur, and they\r\ntook possession of its peace and comfort with open celebration. After\r\nall, they agreed, there was no place in the world so delightful as a\r\nhotel apartment like that; the boasted charms of home were nothing to it;\r\nand then the magic of its being always there, ready for any one, every\r\none, just as if it were for some one alone: it was like the experience of\r\nan Arabian Nights hero come true for all the race.\r\n\r\n"Oh, why can\'t we always stay here, just we two!" Mrs. March sighed to\r\nher husband, as he came out of his room rubbing his face red with the\r\ntowel, while she studied a new arrangement of her bonnet and handbag on\r\nthe mantel.\r\n\r\n"And ignore the past? I\'m willing. I\'ve no doubt that the children could\r\nget on perfectly well without us, and could find some lot in the scheme\r\nof Providence that would really be just as well for them."\r\n\r\n"Yes; or could contrive somehow never to have existed. I should insist\r\nupon that. If they are, don\'t you see that we couldn\'t wish them not to\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I see your point; it\'s simply incontrovertible."\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said: "Well, at any rate, if we can\'t find a flat to suit\r\nus we can all crowd into these three rooms somehow, for the winter, and\r\nthen browse about for meals. By the week we could get them much cheaper;\r\nand we could save on the eating, as they do in Europe. Or on something\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Something else, probably," said March. "But we won\'t take this apartment\r\ntill the ideal furnished flat winks out altogether. We shall not have any\r\ntrouble. We can easily find some one who is going South for the winter\r\nand will be glad to give up their flat \'to the right party\' at a nominal\r\nrent. That\'s my notion. That\'s what the Evanses did one winter when they\r\ncame on here in February. All but the nominality of the rent."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and we could pay a very good rent and still save something on\r\nletting our house. You can settle yourselves in a hundred different ways\r\nin New York, that is one merit of the place. But if everything else\r\nfails, we can come back to this. I want you to take the refusal of it,\r\nBasil. And we\'ll commence looking this very evening as soon as we\'ve had\r\ndinner. I cut a lot of things out of the Herald as we came on. See here!"\r\n\r\nShe took a long strip of paper out of her hand-bag with minute\r\nadvertisements pinned transversely upon it, and forming the effect of\r\nsome glittering nondescript vertebrate.\r\n\r\n"Looks something like the sea-serpent," said March, drying his hands on\r\nthe towel, while he glanced up and down the list. "But we sha\'n\'t have\r\nany trouble. I\'ve no doubt there are half a dozen things there that will\r\ndo. You haven\'t gone up-town? Because we must be near the \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' office."\r\n\r\n"No; but I wish Mr. Fulkerson hadn\'t called it that! It always makes one\r\nthink of \'jam yesterday and jam tomorrow, but never jam to-day,\' in\r\n\'Through the Looking-Glass.\' They\'re all in this region."\r\n\r\nThey were still at their table, beside a low window, where some sort of\r\nnever-blooming shrub symmetrically balanced itself in a large pot, with a\r\nleaf to the right and a leaf to the left and a spear up the middle, when\r\nFulkerson came stepping square-footedly over the thick dining-room\r\ncarpet. He wagged in the air a gay hand of salutation at sight of them,\r\nand of repression when they offered to rise to meet him; then, with an\r\napparent simultaneity of action he gave a hand to each, pulled up a chair\r\nfrom the next table, put his hat and stick on the floor beside it, and\r\nseated himself.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve burned your ships behind you, sure enough," he said,\r\nbeaming his satisfaction upon them from eyes and teeth.\r\n\r\n"The ships are burned," said March, "though I\'m not sure we alone did it.\r\nBut here we are, looking for shelter, and a little anxious about the\r\ndisposition of the natives."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'re an awful peaceable lot," said Fulkerson. "I\'ve been round\r\namong the caciques a little, and I think I\'ve got two or three places\r\nthat will just suit you, Mrs. March. How did you leave the children?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, how kind of you! Very well, and very proud to be left in charge of\r\nthe smoking wrecks."\r\n\r\nFulkerson naturally paid no attention to what she said, being but\r\nsecondarily interested in the children at the best. "Here are some things\r\nright in this neighborhood, within gunshot of the office, and if you want\r\nyou can go and look at them to-night; the agents gave me houses where the\r\npeople would be in."\r\n\r\n"We will go and look at them instantly," said Mrs. March. "Or, as soon as\r\nyou\'ve had coffee with us."\r\n\r\n"Never do," Fulkerson replied. He gathered up his hat and stick. "Just\r\nrushed in to say Hello, and got to run right away again. I tell you,\r\nMarch, things are humming. I\'m after those fellows with a sharp stick all\r\nthe while to keep them from loafing on my house, and at the same time I\'m\r\njust bubbling over with ideas about \'The Lone Hand\'--wish we could call it\r\nthat!--that I want to talk up with you."\r\n\r\n"Well, come to breakfast," said Mrs. March, cordially.\r\n\r\n"No; the ideas will keep till you\'ve secured your lodge in this vast\r\nwilderness. Good-bye."\r\n\r\n"You\'re as nice as you can be, Mr. Fulkerson," she said, "to keep us in\r\nmind when you have so much to occupy you."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have anything to occupy me if I hadn\'t kept you in mind, Mrs.\r\nMarch," said Fulkerson, going off upon as good a speech as he could\r\napparently hope to make.\r\n\r\n"Why, Basil," said Mrs. March, when he was gone, "he\'s charming! But now\r\nwe mustn\'t lose an instant. Let\'s see where the places are." She ran over\r\nthe half-dozen agents\' permits. "Capital--first-rate--the very thing--every\r\none. Well, I consider ourselves settled! We can go back to the children\r\nto-morrow if we like, though I rather think I should like to stay over\r\nanother day and get a little rested for the final pulling up that\'s got\r\nto come. But this simplifies everything enormously, and Mr. Fulkerson is\r\nas thoughtful and as sweet as he can be. I know you will get on well with\r\nhim. He has such a good heart. And his attitude toward you, Basil, is\r\nbeautiful always--so respectful; or not that so much as appreciative.\r\nYes, appreciative--that\'s the word; I must always keep that in mind."\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite important to do so," said March.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she assented, seriously, "and we must not forget just what kind of\r\nflat we are going to look for. The \'sine qua nons\' are an elevator and\r\nsteam heat, not above the third floor, to begin with. Then we must each\r\nhave a room, and you must have your study and I must have my parlor; and\r\nthe two girls must each have a room. With the kitchen and dining room,\r\nhow many does that make?"\r\n\r\n"Ten."\r\n\r\n"I thought eight. Well, no matter. You can work in the parlor, and run\r\ninto your bedroom when anybody comes; and I can sit in mine, and the\r\ngirls must put up with one, if it\'s large and sunny, though I\'ve always\r\ngiven them two at home. And the kitchen must be sunny, so they can sit in\r\nit. And the rooms must all have outside light. And the rent must not be\r\nover eight hundred for the winter. We only get a thousand for our whole\r\nhouse, and we must save something out of that, so as to cover the\r\nexpenses of moving. Now, do you think you can remember all that?"\r\n\r\n"Not the half of it," said March. "But you can; or if you forget a third\r\nof it, I can come in with my partial half and more than make it up."\r\n\r\nShe had brought her bonnet and sacque down-stairs with her, and was\r\ntransferring them from the hatrack to her person while she talked. The\r\nfriendly door-boy let them into the street, and the clear October evening\r\nair brightened her so that as she tucked her hand under her husband\'s arm\r\nand began to pull him along she said, "If we find something right\r\naway--and we\'re just as likely to get the right flat soon as late; it\'s\r\nall a lottery--we\'ll go to the theatre somewhere."\r\n\r\nShe had a moment\'s panic about having left the agents\' permits on the\r\ntable, and after remembering that she had put them into her little\r\nshopping-bag, where she kept her money (each note crushed into a round\r\nwad), and had left it on the hat-rack, where it would certainly be\r\nstolen, she found it on her wrist. She did not think that very funny; but\r\nafter a first impulse to inculpate her husband, she let him laugh, while\r\nthey stopped under a lamp and she held the permits half a yard away to\r\nread the numbers on them.\r\n\r\n"Where are your glasses, Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"On the mantel in our room, of course."\r\n\r\n"Then you ought to have brought a pair of tongs."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t get off second-hand jokes, Basil," she said; and "Why, here!"\r\nshe cried, whirling round to the door before which they had halted, "this\r\nis the very number. Well, I do believe it\'s a sign!"\r\n\r\nOne of those colored men who soften the trade of janitor in many of the\r\nsmaller apartment-houses in New York by the sweetness of their race let\r\nthe Marches in, or, rather, welcomed them to the possession of the\r\npremises by the bow with which he acknowledged their permit. It was a\r\nlarge, old mansion cut up into five or six dwellings, but it had kept\r\nsome traits of its former dignity, which pleased people of their\r\nsympathetic tastes. The dark-mahogany trim, of sufficiently ugly design,\r\ngave a rich gloom to the hallway, which was wide and paved with marble;\r\nthe carpeted stairs curved aloft through a generous space.\r\n\r\n"There is no elevator?" Mrs. March asked of the janitor.\r\n\r\nHe answered, "No, ma\'am; only two flights up," so winningly that she\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n"Oh!" in courteous apology, and whispered to her husband, as she followed\r\nlightly up, "We\'ll take it, Basil, if it\'s like the rest."\r\n\r\n"If it\'s like him, you mean."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder they wanted to own them," she hurriedly philosophized.\r\n"If I had such a creature, nothing but death should part us, and I should\r\nno more think of giving him his freedom!"\r\n\r\n"No; we couldn\'t afford it," returned her husband.\r\n\r\nThe apartment which the janitor unlocked for them, and lit up from those\r\nchandeliers and brackets of gilt brass in the form of vine bunches,\r\nleaves, and tendrils in which the early gas-fitter realized most of his\r\nconceptions of beauty, had rather more of the ugliness than the dignity\r\nof the hall. But the rooms were large, and they grouped themselves in a\r\nreminiscence of the time when they were part of a dwelling that had its\r\ncharm, its pathos, its impressiveness. Where they were cut up into\r\nsmaller spaces, it had been done with the frankness with which a proud\r\nold family of fallen fortunes practises its economies. The rough\r\npine-floors showed a black border of tack-heads where carpets had been\r\nlifted and put down for generations; the white paint was yellow with age;\r\nthe apartment had light at the front and at the back, and two or three\r\nrooms had glimpses of the day through small windows let into their\r\ncorners; another one seemed lifting an appealing eye to heaven through a\r\nglass circle in its ceiling; the rest must darkle in perpetual twilight.\r\nYet something pleased in it all, and Mrs. March had gone far to adapt the\r\ndifferent rooms to the members of her family, when she suddenly thought\r\n(and for her to think was to say), "Why, but there\'s no steam heat!"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am," the janitor admitted; "but dere\'s grates in most o\' de\r\nrooms, and dere\'s furnace heat in de halls."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," she admitted, and, having placed her family in the\r\napartments, it was hard to get them out again. "Could we manage?" she\r\nreferred to her husband.\r\n\r\n"Why, I shouldn\'t care for the steam heat if--What is the rent?" he broke\r\noff to ask the janitor.\r\n\r\n"Nine hundred, sir."\r\n\r\nMarch concluded to his wife, "If it were furnished."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course! What could I have been thinking of? We\'re looking for a\r\nfurnished flat," she explained to the janitor, "and this was so pleasant\r\nand homelike that I never thought whether it was furnished or not."\r\n\r\nShe smiled upon the janitor, and he entered into the joke and chuckled so\r\namiably at her flattering oversight on the way down-stairs that she said,\r\nas she pinched her husband\'s arm, "Now, if you don\'t give him a quarter\r\nI\'ll never speak to you again, Basil!"\r\n\r\n"I would have given half a dollar willingly to get you beyond his\r\nglamour," said March, when they were safely on the pavement outside.\r\n"If it hadn\'t been for my strength of character, you\'d have taken an\r\nunfurnished flat without heat and with no elevator, at nine hundred a\r\nyear, when you had just sworn me to steam heat, an elevator, furniture,\r\nand eight hundred."\r\n\r\n"Yes! How could I have lost my head so completely?" she said, with a\r\nlenient amusement in her aberration which she was not always able to feel\r\nin her husband\'s.\r\n\r\n"The next time a colored janitor opens the door to us, I\'ll tell him the\r\napartment doesn\'t suit at the threshold. It\'s the only way to manage you,\r\nIsabel."\r\n\r\n"It\'s true. I am in love with the whole race. I never saw one of them\r\nthat didn\'t have perfectly angelic manners. I think we shall all be black\r\nin heaven--that is, black-souled."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t the usual theory," said March.\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps not," she assented. "Where are we going now? Oh yes, to\r\nthe Xenophon!"\r\n\r\nShe pulled him gayly along again, and after they had walked a block down\r\nand half a block over they stood before the apartment-house of that name,\r\nwhich was cut on the gas-lamps on either side of the heavily spiked,\r\naesthetic-hinged black door. The titter of an electric-bell brought a\r\nlarge, fat Buttons, with a stage effect of being dressed to look small,\r\nwho said he would call the janitor, and they waited in the dimly\r\nsplendid, copper-colored interior, admiring the whorls and waves into\r\nwhich the wallpaint was combed, till the janitor came in his gold-banded\r\ncap, like a Continental porker. When they said they would like to see\r\nMrs. Grosvenor Green\'s apartment, he owned his inability to cope with the\r\naffair, and said he must send for the superintendent; he was either in\r\nthe Herodotus or the Thucydides, and would be there in a minute. The\r\nButtons brought him--a Yankee of browbeating presence in plain\r\nclothes--almost before they had time to exchange a frightened whisper in\r\nrecognition of the fact that there could be no doubt of the steam heat\r\nand elevator in this case. Half stifled in the one, they mounted in the\r\nother eight stories, while they tried to keep their self-respect under\r\nthe gaze of the superintendent, which they felt was classing and\r\nassessing them with unfriendly accuracy. They could not, and they\r\nfaltered abashed at the threshold of Mrs. Grosvenor Green\'s apartment,\r\nwhile the superintendent lit the gas in the gangway that he called a\r\nprivate hall, and in the drawing-room and the succession of chambers\r\nstretching rearward to the kitchen. Everything had been done by the\r\narchitect to save space, and everything, to waste it by Mrs. Grosvenor\r\nGreen. She had conformed to a law for the necessity of turning round in\r\neach room, and had folding-beds in the chambers, but there her\r\nsubordination had ended, and wherever you might have turned round she had\r\nput a gimcrack so that you would knock it over if you did turn. The place\r\nwas rather pretty and even imposing at first glance, and it took several\r\njoint ballots for March and his wife to make sure that with the kitchen\r\nthere were only six rooms. At every door hung a portiere from large rings\r\non a brass rod; every shelf and dressing-case and mantel was littered\r\nwith gimcracks, and the corners of the tiny rooms were curtained off, and\r\nbehind these portieres swarmed more gimcracks. The front of the upright\r\npiano had what March called a short-skirted portiere on it, and the top\r\nwas covered with vases, with dragon candlesticks and with Jap fans, which\r\nalso expanded themselves bat wise on the walls between the etchings and\r\nthe water colors. The floors were covered with filling, and then rugs and\r\nthen skins; the easy-chairs all had tidies, Armenian and Turkish and\r\nPersian; the lounges and sofas had embroidered cushions hidden under\r\ntidies.\r\n\r\nThe radiator was concealed by a Jap screen, and over the top of this some\r\nArab scarfs were flung. There was a superabundance of clocks. China pugs\r\nguarded the hearth; a brass sunflower smiled from the top of either\r\nandiron, and a brass peacock spread its tail before them inside a high\r\nfiligree fender; on one side was a coalhod in \'repousse\' brass, and on\r\nthe other a wrought iron wood-basket. Some red Japanese bird-kites were\r\nstuck about in the necks of spelter vases, a crimson Jap umbrella hung\r\nopened beneath the chandelier, and each globe had a shade of yellow silk.\r\n\r\nMarch, when he had recovered his self-command a little in the presence of\r\nthe agglomeration, comforted himself by calling the bric-a-brac\r\nJamescracks, as if this was their full name.\r\n\r\nThe disrespect he was able to show the whole apartment by means of this\r\njoke strengthened him to say boldly to the superintendent that it was\r\naltogether too small; then he asked carelessly what the rent was.\r\n\r\n"Two hundred and fifty."\r\n\r\nThe Marches gave a start, and looked at each other.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think we could make it do?" she asked him, and he could see\r\nthat she had mentally saved five hundred dollars as the difference\r\nbetween the rent of their house and that of this flat. "It has some very\r\npretty features, and we could manage to squeeze in, couldn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t find another furnished flat like it for no two-fifty a month\r\nin the whole city," the superintendent put in.\r\n\r\nThey exchanged glances again, and March said, carelessly, "It\'s too\r\nsmall."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a vacant flat in the Herodotus for eighteen hundred a year, and\r\none in the Thucydides for fifteen," the superintendent suggested,\r\nclicking his keys together as they sank down in the elevator; "seven\r\nrooms and bath."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said March; "we\'re looking for a furnished flat."\r\n\r\nThey felt that the superintendent parted from them with repressed\r\nsarcasm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Basil, do you think we really made him think it was the smallness\r\nand not the dearness?"\r\n\r\n"No, but we saved our self-respect in the attempt; and that\'s a great\r\ndeal."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I wouldn\'t have taken it, anyway, with only six rooms, and so\r\nhigh up. But what prices! Now, we must be very circumspect about the next\r\nplace."\r\n\r\nIt was a janitress, large, fat, with her arms wound up in her apron, who\r\nreceived them there. Mrs. March gave her a succinct but perfect statement\r\nof their needs. She failed to grasp the nature of them, or feigned to do\r\nso. She shook her head, and said that her son would show them the flat.\r\nThere was a radiator visible in the narrow hall, and Isabel tacitly\r\ncompromised on steam heat without an elevator, as the flat was only one\r\nflight up. When the son appeared from below with a small kerosene\r\nhand-lamp, it appeared that the flat was unfurnished, but there was no\r\nstopping him till he had shown it in all its impossibility. When they got\r\nsafely away from it and into the street March said: "Well, have you had\r\nenough for to-night, Isabel? Shall we go to the theatre now?"\r\n\r\n"Not on any account. I want to see the whole list of flats that Mr.\r\nFulkerson thought would be the very thing for us." She laughed, but with\r\na certain bitterness.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be calling him my Mr. Fulkerson next, Isabel."\r\n\r\n"Oh no!"\r\n\r\nThe fourth address was a furnished flat without a kitchen, in a house\r\nwith a general restaurant. The fifth was a furnished house. At the sixth\r\na pathetic widow and her pretty daughter wanted to take a family to\r\nboard, and would give them a private table at a rate which the Marches\r\nwould have thought low in Boston.\r\n\r\nMrs. March came away tingling with compassion for their evident anxiety,\r\nand this pity naturally soured into a sense of injury. "Well, I must say\r\nI have completely lost confidence in Mr. Fulkerson\'s judgment. Anything\r\nmore utterly different from what I told him we wanted I couldn\'t imagine.\r\nIf he doesn\'t manage any better about his business than he has done about\r\nthis, it will be a perfect failure."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, let\'s hope he\'ll be more circumspect about that," her\r\nhusband returned, with ironical propitiation. "But I don\'t think it\'s\r\nFulkerson\'s fault altogether. Perhaps it\'s the house-agents\'. They\'re a\r\nvery illusory generation. There seems to be something in the human\r\nhabitation that corrupts the natures of those who deal in it, to buy or\r\nsell it, to hire or let it. You go to an agent and tell him what kind of\r\na house you want. He has no such house, and he sends you to look at\r\nsomething altogether different, upon the well-ascertained principle that\r\nif you can\'t get what you want you will take what you can get. You don\'t\r\nsuppose the \'party\' that took our house in Boston was looking for any\r\nsuch house? He was looking for a totally different kind of house in\r\nanother part of the town."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that!" his wife broke in.\r\n\r\n"Well, no matter. But see what a scandalous rent you asked for it."\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t get much more than half; and, besides, the agent told me to\r\nask fourteen hundred."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not blaming you, Isabel. I\'m only analyzing the house-agent and\r\nexonerating Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t believe he told them just what we wanted; and, at any\r\nrate, I\'m done with agents. Tomorrow I\'m going entirely by\r\nadvertisements."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. March took the vertebrate with her to the Vienna Coffee-House, where\r\nthey went to breakfast next morning. She made March buy her the Herald\r\nand the World, and she added to its spiny convolutions from them. She\r\nread the new advertisements aloud with ardor and with faith to believe\r\nthat the apartments described in them were every one truthfully\r\nrepresented, and that any one of them was richly responsive to their\r\nneeds. "Elegant, light, large, single and outside flats" were offered\r\nwith "all improvements--bath, ice-box, etc."--for twenty-five to thirty\r\ndollars a month. The cheapness was amazing. The Wagram, the Esmeralda,\r\nthe Jacinth, advertised them for forty dollars and sixty dollars, "with\r\nsteam heat and elevator," rent free till November. Others, attractive\r\nfrom their air of conscientious scruple, announced "first-class flats;\r\ngood order; reasonable rents." The Helena asked the reader if she had\r\nseen the "cabinet finish, hard-wood floors, and frescoed ceilings" of its\r\nfifty-dollar flats; the Asteroid affirmed that such apartments, with "six\r\nlight rooms and bath, porcelain wash-tubs, electric bells, and hall-boy,"\r\nas it offered for seventy-five dollars were unapproached by competition.\r\nThere was a sameness in the jargon which tended to confusion. Mrs. March\r\ngot several flats on her list which promised neither steam heat nor\r\nelevators; she forgot herself so far as to include two or three as remote\r\nfrom the down-town region of her choice as Harlem. But after she had\r\nrejected these the nondescript vertebrate was still voluminous enough to\r\nsustain her buoyant hopes.\r\n\r\nThe waiter, who remembered them from year to year, had put them at a\r\nwindow giving a pretty good section of Broadway, and before they set out\r\non their search they had a moment of reminiscence. They recalled the\r\nBroadway of five, of ten, of twenty years ago, swelling and roaring with\r\na tide of gayly painted omnibuses and of picturesque traffic that the\r\nhorsecars have now banished from it. The grind of their wheels and the\r\nclash of their harsh bells imperfectly fill the silence that the\r\nomnibuses have left, and the eye misses the tumultuous perspective of\r\nformer times.\r\n\r\nThey went out and stood for a moment before Grace Church, and looked down\r\nthe stately thoroughfare, and found it no longer impressive, no longer\r\ncharacteristic. It is still Broadway in name, but now it is like any\r\nother street. You do not now take your life in your hand when you attempt\r\nto cross it; the Broadway policeman who supported the elbow of timorous\r\nbeauty in the hollow of his cotton-gloved palm and guided its little\r\nfearful boots over the crossing, while he arrested the billowy omnibuses\r\non either side with an imperious glance, is gone, and all that certain\r\nprocessional, barbaric gayety of the place is gone.\r\n\r\n"Palmyra, Baalbec, Timour of the Desert," said March, voicing their\r\ncommon feeling of the change.\r\n\r\nThey turned and went into the beautiful church, and found themselves in\r\ntime for the matin service. Rapt far from New York, if not from earth, in\r\nthe dim richness of the painted light, the hallowed music took them with\r\nsolemn ecstasy; the aerial, aspiring Gothic forms seemed to lift them\r\nheavenward. They came out, reluctant, into the dazzle and bustle of the\r\nstreet, with a feeling that they were too good for it, which they\r\nconfessed to each other with whimsical consciousness.\r\n\r\n"But no matter how consecrated we feel now," he said, "we mustn\'t forget\r\nthat we went into the church for precisely the same reason that we went\r\nto the Vienna Cafe for breakfast--to gratify an aesthetic sense, to renew\r\nthe faded pleasure of travel for a moment, to get back into the Europe of\r\nour youth. It was a purely Pagan impulse, Isabel, and we\'d better own\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she returned. "I think we reduce ourselves to the bare\r\nbones too much. I wish we didn\'t always recognize the facts as we do.\r\nSometimes I should like to blink them. I should like to think I was\r\ndevouter than I am, and younger and prettier."\r\n\r\n"Better not; you couldn\'t keep it up. Honesty is the best policy even in\r\nsuch things."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t like it, Basil. I should rather wait till the last day for\r\nsome of my motives to come to the top. I know they\'re always mixed, but\r\ndo let me give them the benefit of a doubt sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, have it your own way, my dear. But I prefer not to lay up so\r\nmany disagreeable surprises for myself at that time."\r\n\r\nShe would not consent. "I know I am a good deal younger than I was. I\r\nfeel quite in the mood of that morning when we walked down Broadway on\r\nour wedding journey. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. But I know I\'m not younger; I\'m only prettier."\r\n\r\nShe laughed for pleasure in his joke, and also for unconscious joy in the\r\ngay New York weather, in which there was no \'arriere pensee\' of the east\r\nwind. They had crossed Broadway, and were walking over to Washington\r\nSquare, in the region of which they now hoped to place themselves. The\r\n\'primo tenore\' statue of Garibaldi had already taken possession of the\r\nplace in the name of Latin progress, and they met Italian faces, French\r\nfaces, Spanish faces, as they strolled over the asphalt walks, under the\r\nthinning shadows of the autumn-stricken sycamores. They met the familiar\r\npicturesque raggedness of Southern Europe with the old kindly illusion\r\nthat somehow it existed for their appreciation, and that it found\r\nadequate compensation for poverty in this. March thought he sufficiently\r\nexpressed his tacit sympathy in sitting down on one of the iron benches\r\nwith his wife and letting a little Neapolitan put a superfluous shine on\r\nhis boots, while their desultory comment wandered with equal esteem to\r\nthe old-fashioned American respectability which keeps the north side of\r\nthe square in vast mansions of red brick, and the international\r\nshabbiness which has invaded the southern border, and broken it up into\r\nlodging-houses, shops, beer-gardens, and studios.\r\n\r\nThey noticed the sign of an apartment to let on the north side, and as\r\nsoon as the little bootblack could be bought off they went over to look\r\nat it. The janitor met them at the door and examined them. Then he said,\r\nas if still in doubt, "It has ten rooms, and the rent is twenty-eight\r\nhundred dollars."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do, then," March replied, and left him to divide the\r\nresponsibility between the paucity of the rooms and the enormity of the\r\nrent as he best might. But their self-love had received a wound, and they\r\nquestioned each other what it was in their appearance made him doubt\r\ntheir ability to pay so much.\r\n\r\n"Of course, we don\'t look like New-Yorkers," sighed Mrs. March, "and\r\nwe\'ve walked through the Square. That might be as if we had walked along\r\nthe Park Street mall in the Common before we came out on Beacon. Do you\r\nsuppose he could have seen you getting your boots blacked in that way?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s useless to ask," said March. "But I never can recover from this\r\nblow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw! You know you hate such things as badly as I do. It was very\r\nimpertinent of him."\r\n\r\n"Let us go back and \'ecraser l\'infame\' by paying him a year\'s rent in\r\nadvance and taking immediate possession. Nothing else can soothe my\r\nwounded feelings. You were not having your boots blacked: why shouldn\'t\r\nhe have supposed you were a New-Yorker, and I a country cousin?"\r\n\r\n"They always know. Don\'t you remember Mrs. Williams\'s going to a Fifth\r\nAvenue milliner in a Worth dress, and the woman\'s asking her instantly\r\nwhat hotel she should send her hat to?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; these things drive one to despair. I don\'t wonder the bodies of so\r\nmany genteel strangers are found in the waters around New York. Shall we\r\ntry the south side, my dear? or had we better go back to our rooms and\r\nrest awhile?"\r\n\r\nMrs. March had out the vertebrate, and was consulting one of its\r\nglittering ribs and glancing up from it at a house before which they\r\nstood. "Yes, it\'s the number; but do they call this being ready October\r\nfirst?" The little area in front of the basement was heaped with a\r\nmixture of mortar, bricks, laths, and shavings from the interior; the\r\nbrownstone steps to the front door were similarly bestrewn; the doorway\r\nshowed the half-open, rough pine carpenter\'s sketch of an unfinished\r\nhouse; the sashless windows of every story showed the activity of workmen\r\nwithin; the clatter of hammers and the hiss of saws came out to them from\r\nevery opening.\r\n\r\n"They may call it October first," said March, "because it\'s too late to\r\ncontradict them. But they\'d better not call it December first in my\r\npresence; I\'ll let them say January first, at a pinch."\r\n\r\n"We will go in and look at it, anyway," said his wife; and he admired\r\nhow, when she was once within, she began provisionally to settle the\r\nfamily in each of the several floors with the female instinct for\r\ndomiciliation which never failed her. She had the help of the landlord,\r\nwho was present to urge forward the workmen apparently; he lent a hopeful\r\nfancy to the solution of all her questions. To get her from under his\r\ninfluence March had to represent that the place was damp from undried\r\nplastering, and that if she stayed she would probably be down with that\r\nNew York pneumonia which visiting Bostonians are always dying of. Once\r\nsafely on the pavement outside, she realized that the apartment was not\r\nonly unfinished, but unfurnished, and had neither steam heat nor\r\nelevator. "But I thought we had better look at everything," she\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but not take everything. If I hadn\'t pulled you away from there by\r\nmain force you\'d have not only died of New York pneumonia on the spot,\r\nbut you\'d have had us all settled there before we knew what we were\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s what I can\'t help, Basil. It\'s the only way I can realize\r\nwhether it will do for us. I have to dramatize the whole thing."\r\n\r\nShe got a deal of pleasure as well as excitement out of this, and he had\r\nto own that the process of setting up housekeeping in so many different\r\nplaces was not only entertaining, but tended, through association with\r\ntheir first beginnings in housekeeping, to restore the image of their\r\nearly married days and to make them young again.\r\n\r\nIt went on all day, and continued far into the night, until it was too\r\nlate to go to the theatre, too late to do anything but tumble into bed\r\nand simultaneously fall asleep. They groaned over their reiterated\r\ndisappointments, but they could not deny that the interest was unfailing,\r\nand that they got a great deal of fun out of it all. Nothing could abate\r\nMrs. March\'s faith in her advertisements. One of them sent her to a flat\r\nof ten rooms which promised to be the solution of all their difficulties;\r\nit proved to be over a livery-stable, a liquor store, and a milliner\'s\r\nshop, none of the first fashion. Another led them far into old Greenwich\r\nVillage to an apartment-house, which she refused to enter behind a small\r\ngirl with a loaf of bread under one arm and a quart can of milk under the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn their search they were obliged, as March complained, to the\r\nacquisition of useless information in a degree unequalled in their\r\nexperience. They came to excel in the sad knowledge of the line at which\r\nrespectability distinguishes itself from shabbiness. Flattering\r\nadvertisements took them to numbers of huge apartment-houses chiefly\r\ndistinguishable from tenement-houses by the absence of fire-escapes on\r\ntheir facades, till Mrs. March refused to stop at any door where there\r\nwere more than six bell-ratchets and speaking-tubes on either hand.\r\nBefore the middle of the afternoon she decided against ratchets\r\naltogether, and confined herself to knobs, neatly set in the door-trim.\r\nHer husband was still sunk in the superstition that you can live anywhere\r\nyou like in New York, and he would have paused at some places where her\r\nquicker eye caught the fatal sign of "Modes" in the ground-floor windows.\r\nShe found that there was an east and west line beyond which they could\r\nnot go if they wished to keep their self-respect, and that within the\r\nregion to which they had restricted themselves there was a choice of\r\nstreets. At first all the New York streets looked to them ill-paved,\r\ndirty, and repulsive; the general infamy imparted itself in their casual\r\nimpression to streets in no wise guilty. But they began to notice that\r\nsome streets were quiet and clean, and, though never so quiet and clean\r\nas Boston streets, that they wore an air of encouraging reform, and\r\nsuggested a future of greater and greater domesticity. Whole blocks of\r\nthese downtown cross-streets seemed to have been redeemed from decay, and\r\neven in the midst of squalor a dwelling here and there had been seized,\r\npainted a dull red as to its brick-work, and a glossy black as to its\r\nwood-work, and with a bright brass bell-pull and door-knob and a large\r\nbrass plate for its key-hole escutcheon, had been endowed with an effect\r\nof purity and pride which removed its shabby neighborhood far from it.\r\nSome of these houses were quite small, and imaginably within their means;\r\nbut, as March said, some body seemed always to be living there himself,\r\nand the fact that none of them was to rent kept Mrs. March true to her\r\nideal of a flat. Nothing prevented its realization so much as its\r\ndifference from the New York ideal of a flat, which was inflexibly seven\r\nrooms and a bath. One or two rooms might be at the front, the rest\r\ncrooked and cornered backward through increasing and then decreasing\r\ndarkness till they reached a light bedroom or kitchen at the rear. It\r\nmight be the one or the other, but it was always the seventh room with\r\nthe bath; or if, as sometimes happened, it was the eighth, it was so\r\nafter having counted the bath as one; in this case the janitor said you\r\nalways counted the bath as one. If the flats were advertised as having\r\n"all light rooms," he explained that any room with a window giving into\r\nthe open air of a court or shaft was counted a light room.\r\n\r\nThe Marches tried to make out why it was that these flats were so much\r\nmore repulsive than the apartments which everyone lived in abroad; but\r\nthey could only do so upon the supposition that in their European days\r\nthey were too young, too happy, too full of the future, to notice whether\r\nrooms were inside or outside, light or dark, big or little, high or low.\r\n"Now we\'re imprisoned in the present," he said, "and we have to make the\r\nworst of it."\r\n\r\nIn their despair he had an inspiration, which she declared worthy of him:\r\nit was to take two small flats, of four or five rooms and a bath, and\r\nlive in both. They tried this in a great many places, but they never\r\ncould get two flats of the kind on the same floor where there was steam\r\nheat and an elevator. At one place they almost did it. They had resigned\r\nthemselves to the humility of the neighborhood, to the prevalence of\r\nmodistes and livery-stablemen (they seem to consort much in New York), to\r\nthe garbage in the gutters and the litter of paper in the streets, to the\r\nfaltering slats in the surrounding window-shutters and the crumbled\r\nbrownstone steps and sills, when it turned out that one of the apartments\r\nhad been taken between two visits they made. Then the only combination\r\nleft open to them was of a ground-floor flat to the right and a\r\nthird-floor flat to the left.\r\n\r\nStill they kept this inspiration in reserve for use at the first\r\nopportunity. In the mean time there were several flats which they thought\r\nthey could almost make do: notably one where they could get an extra\r\nservant\'s room in the basement four flights down, and another where they\r\ncould get it in the roof five flights up. At the first the janitor was\r\nrespectful and enthusiastic; at the second he had an effect of ironical\r\npessimism. When they trembled on the verge of taking his apartment, he\r\npointed out a spot in the kalsomining of the parlor ceiling, and\r\ngratuitously said, Now such a thing as that he should not agree to put in\r\nshape unless they took the apartment for a term of years. The apartment\r\nwas unfurnished, and they recurred to the fact that they wanted a\r\nfurnished apartment, and made their escape. This saved them in several\r\nother extremities; but short of extremity they could not keep their\r\ndifferent requirements in mind, and were always about to decide without\r\nregard to some one of them.\r\n\r\nThey went to several places twice without intending: once to that\r\nold-fashioned house with the pleasant colored janitor, and wandered all\r\nover the apartment again with a haunting sense of familiarity, and then\r\nrecognized the janitor and laughed; and to that house with the pathetic\r\nwidow and the pretty daughter who wished to take them to board. They\r\nstayed to excuse their blunder, and easily came by the fact that the\r\nmother had taken the house that the girl might have a home while she was\r\nin New York studying art, and they hoped to pay their way by taking\r\nboarders. Her daughter was at her class now, the mother concluded; and\r\nthey encouraged her to believe that it could only be a few days till the\r\nrest of her scheme was realized.\r\n\r\n"I dare say we could be perfectly comfortable there," March suggested\r\nwhen they had got away. "Now if we were truly humane we would modify our\r\ndesires to meet their needs and end this sickening search, wouldn\'t we?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but we\'re not truly humane," his wife answered, "or at least not in\r\nthat sense. You know you hate boarding; and if we went there I should\r\nhave them on my sympathies the whole time."\r\n\r\n"I see. And then you would take it out of me."\r\n\r\n"Then I should take it out of you. And if you are going to be so weak,\r\nBasil, and let every little thing work upon you in that way, you\'d better\r\nnot come to New York. You\'ll see enough misery here."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t take that superior tone with me, as if I were a child that\r\nhad its mind set on an undesirable toy, Isabel."\r\n\r\n"Ah, don\'t you suppose it\'s because you are such a child in some respects\r\nthat I like you, dear?" she demanded, without relenting.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t find so much misery in New York. I don\'t suppose there\'s any\r\nmore suffering here to the population than there is in the country. And\r\nthey\'re so gay about it all. I think the outward aspect of the place and\r\nthe hilarity of the sky and air must get into the people\'s blood. The\r\nweather is simply unapproachable; and I don\'t care if it is the ugliest\r\nplace in the world, as you say. I suppose it is. It shrieks and yells\r\nwith ugliness here and there but it never loses its spirits. That widow\r\nis from the country. When she\'s been a year in New York she\'ll be as\r\ngay--as gay as an L road." He celebrated a satisfaction they both had in\r\nthe L roads. "They kill the streets and avenues, but at least they\r\npartially hide them, and that is some comfort; and they do triumph over\r\ntheir prostrate forms with a savage exultation that is intoxicating.\r\nThose bends in the L that you get in the corner of Washington Square, or\r\njust below the Cooper Institute--they\'re the gayest things in the world.\r\nPerfectly atrocious, of course, but incomparably picturesque! And the\r\nwhole city is so," said March, "or else the L would never have got built\r\nhere. New York may be splendidly gay or squalidly gay; but, prince or\r\npauper, it\'s gay always."\r\n\r\n"Yes, gay is the word," she admitted, with a sigh. "But frantic. I can\'t\r\nget used to it. They forget death, Basil; they forget death in New York."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that I\'ve ever found much advantage in remembering\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say such a thing, dearest."\r\n\r\nHe could see that she had got to the end of her nervous strength for the\r\npresent, and he proposed that they should take the Elevated road as far\r\nas it would carry them into the country, and shake off their nightmare of\r\nflat-hunting for an hour or two; but her conscience would not let her.\r\nShe convicted him of levity equal to that of the New-Yorkers in proposing\r\nsuch a thing; and they dragged through the day. She was too tired to care\r\nfor dinner, and in the night she had a dream from which she woke herself\r\nwith a cry that roused him, too. It was something about the children at\r\nfirst, whom they had talked of wistfully before falling asleep, and then\r\nit was of a hideous thing with two square eyes and a series of sections\r\ngrowing darker and then lighter, till the tail of the monstrous\r\narticulate was quite luminous again. She shuddered at the vague\r\ndescription she was able to give; but he asked, "Did it offer to bite\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No. That was the most frightful thing about it; it had no mouth."\r\n\r\nMarch laughed. "Why, my dear, it was nothing but a harmless New York\r\nflat--seven rooms and a bath."\r\n\r\n"I really believe it was," she consented, recognizing an architectural\r\nresemblance, and she fell asleep again, and woke renewed for the work\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nTheir house-hunting no longer had novelty, but it still had interest; and\r\nthey varied their day by taking a coupe, by renouncing advertisements,\r\nand by reverting to agents. Some of these induced them to consider the\r\nidea of furnished houses; and Mrs. March learned tolerance for Fulkerson\r\nby accepting permits to visit flats and houses which had none of the\r\nqualifications she desired in either, and were as far beyond her means as\r\nthey were out of the region to which she had geographically restricted\r\nherself. They looked at three-thousand and four-thousand dollar\r\napartments, and rejected them for one reason or another which had nothing\r\nto do with the rent; the higher the rent was, the more critical they were\r\nof the slippery inlaid floors and the arrangement of the richly decorated\r\nrooms. They never knew whether they had deceived the janitor or not; as\r\nthey came in a coupe, they hoped they had.\r\n\r\nThey drove accidentally through one street that seemed gayer in the\r\nperspective than an L road. The fire-escapes, with their light iron\r\nbalconies and ladders of iron, decorated the lofty house fronts; the\r\nroadway and sidewalks and door-steps swarmed with children; women\'s heads\r\nseemed to show at every window. In the basements, over which flights of\r\nhigh stone steps led to the tenements, were green-grocers\' shops\r\nabounding in cabbages, and provision stores running chiefly to bacon and\r\nsausages, and cobblers\' and tinners\' shops, and the like, in proportion\r\nto the small needs of a poor neighborhood. Ash barrels lined the\r\nsidewalks, and garbage heaps filled the gutters; teams of all trades\r\nstood idly about; a peddler of cheap fruit urged his cart through the\r\nstreet, and mixed his cry with the joyous screams and shouts of the\r\nchildren and the scolding and gossiping voices of the women; the burly\r\nblue bulk of a policeman defined itself at the corner; a drunkard\r\nzigzagged down the sidewalk toward him. It was not the abode of the\r\nextremest poverty, but of a poverty as hopeless as any in the world,\r\ntransmitting itself from generation to generation, and establishing\r\nconditions of permanency to which human life adjusts itself as it does to\r\nthose of some incurable disease, like leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe time had been when the Marches would have taken a purely aesthetic\r\nview of the facts as they glimpsed them in this street of\r\ntenement-houses; when they would have contented themselves with saying\r\nthat it was as picturesque as a street in Naples or Florence, and with\r\nwondering why nobody came to paint it; they would have thought they were\r\nsufficiently serious about it in blaming the artists for their failure to\r\nappreciate it, and going abroad for the picturesque when they had it here\r\nunder their noses. It was to the nose that the street made one of its\r\nstrongest appeals, and Mrs. March pulled up her window of the coupe. "Why\r\ndoes he take us through such a disgusting street?" she demanded, with an\r\nexasperation of which her husband divined the origin.\r\n\r\n"This driver may be a philanthropist in disguise," he answered, with\r\ndreamy irony, "and may want us to think about the people who are not\r\nmerely carried through this street in a coupe, but have to spend their\r\nwhole lives in it, winter and summer, with no hopes of driving out of it,\r\nexcept in a hearse. I must say they don\'t seem to mind it. I haven\'t seen\r\na jollier crowd anywhere in New York. They seem to have forgotten death a\r\nlittle more completely than any of their fellow-citizens, Isabel. And I\r\nwonder what they think of us, making this gorgeous progress through their\r\nmidst. I suppose they think we\'re rich, and hate us--if they hate rich\r\npeople; they don\'t look as if they hated anybody. Should we be as patient\r\nas they are with their discomfort? I don\'t believe there\'s steam heat or\r\nan elevator in the whole block. Seven rooms and a bath would be more than\r\nthe largest and genteelest family would know what to do with. They\r\nwouldn\'t know what to do with the bath, anyway."\r\n\r\nHis monologue seemed to interest his wife apart from the satirical point\r\nit had for themselves. "You ought to get Mr. Fulkerson to let you work\r\nsome of these New York sights up for Every Other Week, Basil; you could\r\ndo them very nicely."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ve thought of that. But don\'t let\'s leave the personal ground.\r\nDoesn\'t it make you feel rather small and otherwise unworthy when you see\r\nthe kind of street these fellow-beings of yours live in, and then think\r\nhow particular you are about locality and the number of bellpulls? I\r\ndon\'t see even ratchets and speaking-tubes at these doors." He craned his\r\nneck out of the window for a better look, and the children of discomfort\r\ncheered him, out of sheer good feeling and high spirits. "I didn\'t know I\r\nwas so popular. Perhaps it\'s a recognition of my humane sentiments."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s very easy to have humane sentiments, and to satirize ourselves\r\nfor wanting eight rooms and a bath in a good neighborhood, when we see\r\nhow these wretched creatures live," said his wife. "But if we shared all\r\nwe have with them, and then settled down among them, what good would it\r\ndo?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least in the world. It might help us for the moment, but it\r\nwouldn\'t keep the wolf from their doors for a week; and then they would\r\ngo on just as before, only they wouldn\'t be on such good terms with the\r\nwolf. The only way for them is to keep up an unbroken intimacy with the\r\nwolf; then they can manage him somehow. I don\'t know how, and I\'m afraid\r\nI don\'t want to. Wouldn\'t you like to have this fellow drive us round\r\namong the halls of pride somewhere for a little while? Fifth Avenue or\r\nMadison, up-town?"\r\n\r\n"No; we\'ve no time to waste. I\'ve got a place near Third Avenue, on a\r\nnice cross street, and I want him to take us there." It proved that she\r\nhad several addresses near together, and it seemed best to dismiss their\r\ncoupe and do the rest of their afternoon\'s work on foot. It came to\r\nnothing; she was not humbled in the least by what she had seen in the\r\ntenement-house street; she yielded no point in her ideal of a flat, and\r\nthe flats persistently refused to lend themselves to it. She lost all\r\npatience with them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t say the flats are in the right of it," said her husband,\r\nwhen she denounced their stupid inadequacy to the purposes of a Christian\r\nhome. "But I\'m not so sure that we are, either. I\'ve been thinking about\r\nthat home business ever since my sensibilities were dragged--in a\r\ncoupe--through that tenement-house street. Of course, no child born and\r\nbrought up in such a place as that could have any conception of home. But\r\nthat\'s because those poor people can\'t give character to their\r\nhabitations. They have to take what they can get. But people like\r\nus--that is, of our means--do give character to the average flat. It\'s\r\nmade to meet their tastes, or their supposed tastes; and so it\'s made for\r\nsocial show, not for family life at all. Think of a baby in a flat! It\'s\r\na contradiction in terms; the flat is the negation of motherhood. The\r\nflat means society life; that is, the pretence of social life. It\'s made\r\nto give artificial people a society basis on a little money--too much\r\nmoney, of course, for what they get. So the cost of the building is put\r\ninto marble halls and idiotic decoration of all kinds. I don\'t object to\r\nthe conveniences, but none of these flats has a living-room. They have\r\ndrawing-rooms to foster social pretence, and they have dining-rooms and\r\nbedrooms; but they have no room where the family can all come together\r\nand feel the sweetness of being a family. The bedrooms are black-holes\r\nmostly, with a sinful waste of space in each. If it were not for the\r\nmarble halls, and the decorations, and the foolishly expensive finish,\r\nthe houses could be built round a court, and the flats could be shaped\r\nsomething like a Pompeiian house, with small sleeping-closets--only lit\r\nfrom the outside--and the rest of the floor thrown into two or three\r\nlarge cheerful halls, where all the family life could go on, and society\r\ncould be transacted unpretentiously. Why, those tenements are better and\r\nhumaner than those flats! There the whole family lives in the kitchen,\r\nand has its consciousness of being; but the flat abolishes the family\r\nconsciousness. It\'s confinement without coziness; it\'s cluttered without\r\nbeing snug. You couldn\'t keep a self-respecting cat in a flat; you\r\ncouldn\'t go down cellar to get cider. No! the Anglo-Saxon home, as we\r\nknow it in the Anglo-Saxon house, is simply impossible in the\r\nFranco-American flat, not because it\'s humble, but because it\'s false."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Mrs. March, "let\'s look at houses."\r\n\r\nHe had been denouncing the flat in the abstract, and he had not expected\r\nthis concrete result. But he said, "We will look at houses, then."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nNothing mystifies a man more than a woman\'s aberrations from some point\r\nat which he supposes her fixed as a star. In these unfurnished houses,\r\nwithout steam or elevator, March followed his wife about with patient\r\nwonder. She rather liked the worst of them best: but she made him go down\r\ninto the cellars and look at the furnaces; she exacted from him a rigid\r\ninquest of the plumbing. She followed him into one of the cellars by the\r\nfitful glare of successively lighted matches, and they enjoyed a moment\r\nin which the anomaly of their presence there on that errand, so remote\r\nfrom all the facts of their long-established life in Boston, realized\r\nitself for them.\r\n\r\n"Think how easily we might have been murdered and nobody been any the\r\nwiser!" she said when they were comfortably outdoors again.\r\n\r\n"Yes, or made way with ourselves in an access of emotional insanity,\r\nsupposed to have been induced by unavailing flat-hunting," he suggested.\r\nShe fell in with the notion. "I\'m beginning to feel crazy. But I don\'t\r\nwant you to lose your head, Basil. And I don\'t want you to sentimentalize\r\nany of the things you see in New York. I think you were disposed to do it\r\nin that street we drove through. I don\'t believe there\'s any real\r\nsuffering--not real suffering--among those people; that is, it would be\r\nsuffering from our point of view, but they\'ve been used to it all their\r\nlives, and they don\'t feel their discomfort so much."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I understand that, and I don\'t propose to sentimentalize\r\nthem. I think when people get used to a bad state of things they had\r\nbetter stick to it; in fact, they don\'t usually like a better state so\r\nwell, and I shall keep that firmly in mind."\r\n\r\nShe laughed with him, and they walked along the L bestridden avenue,\r\nexhilarated by their escape from murder and suicide in that cellar,\r\ntoward the nearest cross town track, which they meant to take home to\r\ntheir hotel. "Now to-night we will go to the theatre," she said, "and get\r\nthis whole house business out of our minds, and be perfectly fresh for a\r\nnew start in the morning." Suddenly she clutched his arm. "Why, did you\r\nsee that man?" and she signed with her head toward a decently dressed\r\nperson who walked beside them, next the gutter, stooping over as if to\r\nexamine it, and half halting at times.\r\n\r\n"No. What?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I saw him pick up a dirty bit of cracker from the pavement and cram\r\nit into his mouth and eat it down as if he were famished. And look! he\'s\r\nactually hunting for more in those garbage heaps!"\r\n\r\nThis was what the decent-looking man with the hard hands and broken nails\r\nof a workman was doing-like a hungry dog. They kept up with him, in the\r\nfascination of the sight, to the next corner, where he turned down the\r\nside street still searching the gutter.\r\n\r\nThey walked on a few paces. Then March said, "I must go after him," and\r\nleft his wife standing.\r\n\r\n"Are you in want--hungry?" he asked the man.\r\n\r\nThe man said he could not speak English, Monsieur.\r\n\r\nMarch asked his question in French.\r\n\r\nThe man shrugged a pitiful, desperate shrug, "Mais, Monsieur--"\r\n\r\nMarch put a coin in his hand, and then suddenly the man\'s face twisted\r\nup; he caught the hand of this alms-giver in both of his and clung to it.\r\n"Monsieur! Monsieur!" he gasped, and the tears rained down his face.\r\n\r\nHis benefactor pulled himself away, shocked and ashamed, as one is by\r\nsuch a chance, and got back to his wife, and the man lapsed back into the\r\nmystery of misery out of which he had emerged.\r\n\r\nMarch felt it laid upon him to console his wife for what had happened.\r\n"Of course, we might live here for years and not see another case like\r\nthat; and, of course, there are twenty places where he could have gone\r\nfor help if he had known where to find them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but it\'s the possibility of his needing the help so badly as that,"\r\nshe answered. "That\'s what I can\'t bear, and I shall not come to a place\r\nwhere such things are possible, and we may as well stop our house-hunting\r\nhere at once."\r\n\r\n"Yes? And what part of Christendom will you live in? Such things are\r\npossible everywhere in our conditions."\r\n\r\n"Then we must change the conditions--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; we must go to the theatre and forget them. We can stop at\r\nBrentano\'s for our tickets as we pass through Union Square."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to the theatre, Basil. I am going home to Boston\r\nto-night. You can stay and find a flat."\r\n\r\nHe convinced her of the absurdity of her position, and even of its\r\nselfishness; but she said that her mind was quite made up irrespective of\r\nwhat had happened, that she had been away from the children long enough;\r\nthat she ought to be at home to finish up the work of leaving it. The\r\nword brought a sigh. "Ah, I don\'t know why we should see nothing but sad\r\nand ugly things now. When we were young--"\r\n\r\n"Younger," he put in. "We\'re still young."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we pretend, but we know better. But I was thinking how\r\npretty and pleasant things used to be turning up all the time on our\r\ntravels in the old days. Why, when we were in New York here on our\r\nwedding journey the place didn\'t seem half so dirty as it does now, and\r\nnone of these dismal things happened."\r\n\r\n"It was a good deal dirtier," he answered; "and I fancy worse in every\r\nway--hungrier, raggeder, more wretchedly housed. But that wasn\'t the\r\nperiod of life for us to notice it. Don\'t you remember, when we started\r\nto Niagara the last time, how everybody seemed middle-aged and\r\ncommonplace; and when we got there there were no evident brides; nothing\r\nbut elderly married people?"\r\n\r\n"At least they weren\'t starving," she rebelled.\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t starve in parlor-cars and first-class hotels; but if you\r\nstep out of them you run your chance of seeing those who do, if you\'re\r\ngetting on pretty well in the forties. If it\'s the unhappy who see\r\nunhappiness, think what misery must be revealed to people who pass their\r\nlives in the really squalid tenement-house streets--I don\'t mean\r\npicturesque avenues like that we passed through."\r\n\r\n"But we are not unhappy," she protested, bringing the talk back to the\r\npersonal base again, as women must to get any good out of talk. "We\'re\r\nreally no unhappier than we were when we were young."\r\n\r\n"We\'re more serious."\r\n\r\n"Well, I hate it; and I wish you wouldn\'t be so serious, if that\'s what\r\nit brings us to."\r\n\r\n"I will be trivial from this on," said March. "Shall we go to the Hole in\r\nthe Ground to-night?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to Boston."\r\n\r\n"It\'s much the same thing. How do you like that for triviality? It\'s a\r\nlittle blasphemous, I\'ll allow."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very silly," she said.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel they found a letter from the agent who had sent them the\r\npermit to see Mrs. Grosvenor Green\'s apartment. He wrote that she had\r\nheard they were pleased with her apartment, and that she thought she\r\ncould make the terms to suit. She had taken her passage for Europe, and\r\nwas very anxious to let the flat before she sailed. She would call that\r\nevening at seven.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Grosvenor Green!" said Mrs. March. "Which of the ten thousand flats\r\nis it, Basil?"\r\n\r\n"The gimcrackery," he answered. "In the Xenophon, you know."\r\n\r\n"Well, she may save herself the trouble. I shall not see her. Or yes--I\r\nmust. I couldn\'t go away without seeing what sort of creature could have\r\nplanned that fly-away flat. She must be a perfect--"\r\n\r\n"Parachute," March suggested.\r\n\r\n"No! anybody so light as that couldn\'t come down."\r\n\r\n"Well, toy balloon."\r\n\r\n"Toy balloon will do for the present," Mrs. March admitted. "But I feel\r\nthat naught but herself can be her parallel for volatility."\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Grosvenor-Green\'s card came up they both descended to the hotel\r\nparlor, which March said looked like the saloon of a Moorish day-boat;\r\nnot that he knew of any such craft, but the decorations were so Saracenic\r\nand the architecture so Hudson Riverish. They found there on the grand\r\ncentral divan a large lady whose vast smoothness, placidity, and\r\nplumpness set at defiance all their preconceptions of Mrs. Grosvenor\r\nGreen, so that Mrs. March distinctly paused with her card in her hand\r\nbefore venturing even tentatively to address her. Then she was astonished\r\nat the low, calm voice in which Mrs. Green acknowledged herself, and\r\nslowly proceeded to apologize for calling. It was not quite true that she\r\nhad taken her passage for Europe, but she hoped soon to do so, and she\r\nconfessed that in the mean time she was anxious to let her flat. She was\r\na little worn out with the care of housekeeping--Mrs. March breathed, "Oh\r\nyes!" in the sigh with which ladies recognize one another\'s\r\nmartyrdom--and Mrs. Green had business abroad, and she was going to\r\npursue her art studies in Paris; she drew in Mr. Ilcomb\'s class now, but\r\nthe instruction was so much better in Paris; and as the superintendent\r\nseemed to think the price was the only objection, she had ventured to\r\ncall.\r\n\r\n"Then we didn\'t deceive him in the least," thought Mrs. March, while she\r\nanswered, sweetly: "No; we were only afraid that it would be too small\r\nfor our family. We require a good many rooms." She could not forego the\r\nopportunity of saying, "My husband is coming to New York to take charge\r\nof a literary periodical, and he will have to have a room to write in,"\r\nwhich made Mrs. Green bow to March, and made March look sheepish. "But we\r\ndid think the apartment very charming", (It was architecturally charming,\r\nshe protested to her conscience), "and we should have been so glad if we\r\ncould have got into it." She followed this with some account of their\r\nhouse-hunting, amid soft murmurs of sympathy from Mrs. Green, who said\r\nthat she had been through all that, and that if she could have shown her\r\napartment to them she felt sure that she could have explained it so that\r\nthey would have seen its capabilities better, Mrs. March assented to\r\nthis, and Mrs. Green added that if they found nothing exactly suitable\r\nshe would be glad to have them look at it again; and then Mrs. March said\r\nthat she was going back to Boston herself, but she was leaving Mr. March\r\nto continue the search; and she had no doubt he would be only too glad to\r\nsee the apartment by daylight. "But if you take it, Basil," she warned\r\nhim, when they were alone, "I shall simply renounce you. I wouldn\'t live\r\nin that junk-shop if you gave it to me. But who would have thought she\r\nwas that kind of looking person? Though of course I might have known if I\r\nhad stopped to think once. It\'s because the place doesn\'t express her at\r\nall that it\'s so unlike her. It couldn\'t be like anybody, or anything\r\nthat flies in the air, or creeps upon the earth, or swims in the waters\r\nunder the earth. I wonder where in the world she\'s from; she\'s no\r\nNew-Yorker; even we can see that; and she\'s not quite a country person,\r\neither; she seems like a person from some large town, where she\'s been an\r\naesthetic authority. And she can\'t find good enough art instruction in\r\nNew York, and has to go to Paris for it! Well, it\'s pathetic, after all,\r\nBasil. I can\'t help feeling sorry for a person who mistakes herself to\r\nthat extent."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help feeling sorry for the husband of a person who mistakes\r\nherself to that extent. What is Mr. Grosvenor Green going to do in Paris\r\nwhile she\'s working her way into the Salon?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you keep away from her apartment, Basil; that\'s all I\'ve got to\r\nsay to you. And yet I do like some things about her."\r\n\r\n"I like everything about her but her apartment," said March.\r\n\r\n"I like her going to be out of the country," said his wife. "We shouldn\'t\r\nbe overlooked. And the place was prettily shaped, you can\'t deny it. And\r\nthere was an elevator and steam heat. And the location is very\r\nconvenient. And there was a hall-boy to bring up cards. The halls and\r\nstairs were kept very clean and nice. But it wouldn\'t do. I could put you\r\na folding bed in the room where you wrote, and we could even have one in\r\nthe parlor."\r\n\r\n"Behind a portiere? I couldn\'t stand any more portieres!"\r\n\r\n"And we could squeeze the two girls into one room, or perhaps only bring\r\nMargaret, and put out the whole of the wash. Basil!" she almost shrieked,\r\n"it isn\'t to be thought of!"\r\n\r\nHe retorted, "I\'m not thinking of it, my dear."\r\n\r\nFulkerson came in just before they started for Mrs. March\'s train, to\r\nfind out what had become of them, he said, and to see whether they had\r\ngot anything to live in yet.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing," she said. "And I\'m just going back to Boston, and leaving\r\nMr. March here to do anything he pleases about it. He has \'carte\r\nblanche.\'"\r\n\r\n"But freedom brings responsibility, you know, Fulkerson, and it\'s the\r\nsame as if I\'d no choice. I\'m staying behind because I\'m left, not\r\nbecause I expect to do anything."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" asked Fulkerson. "Well, we must see what can be done. I\r\nsupposed you would be all settled by this time, or I should have humped\r\nmyself to find you something. None of those places I gave you amounts to\r\nanything?"\r\n\r\n"As much as forty thousand others we\'ve looked at," said Mrs. March.\r\n"Yes, one of them does amount to something. It comes so near being what\r\nwe want that I\'ve given Mr. March particular instructions not to go near\r\nit."\r\n\r\nShe told him about Mrs. Grosvenor Green and her flats, and at the end he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Well, well, we must look out for that. I\'ll keep an eye on him, Mrs.\r\nMarch, and see that he doesn\'t do anything rash, and I won\'t leave him\r\ntill he\'s found just the right thing. It exists, of course; it must in a\r\ncity of eighteen hundred thousand people, and the only question is where\r\nto find it. You leave him to me, Mrs. March; I\'ll watch out for him."\r\n\r\nFulkerson showed some signs of going to the station when he found they\r\nwere not driving, but she bade him a peremptory good-bye at the hotel\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"He\'s very nice, Basil, and his way with you is perfectly charming. It\'s\r\nvery sweet to see how really fond of you he is. But I didn\'t want him\r\nstringing along with us up to Forty-second Street and spoiling our last\r\nmoments together."\r\n\r\nAt Third Avenue they took the Elevated for which she confessed an\r\ninfatuation. She declared it the most ideal way of getting about in the\r\nworld, and was not ashamed when he reminded her of how she used to say\r\nthat nothing under the sun could induce her to travel on it. She now said\r\nthat the night transit was even more interesting than the day, and that\r\nthe fleeing intimacy you formed with people in second and third floor\r\ninteriors, while all the usual street life went on underneath, had a\r\ndomestic intensity mixed with a perfect repose that was the last effect\r\nof good society with all its security and exclusiveness. He said it was\r\nbetter than the theatre, of which it reminded him, to see those people\r\nthrough their windows: a family party of work-folk at a late tea, some of\r\nthe men in their shirt-sleeves; a woman sewing by a lamp; a mother laying\r\nher child in its cradle; a man with his head fallen on his hands upon a\r\ntable; a girl and her lover leaning over the window-sill together. What\r\nsuggestion! what drama? what infinite interest! At the Forty-second\r\nStreet station they stopped a minute on the bridge that crosses the track\r\nto the branch road for the Central Depot, and looked up and down the long\r\nstretch of the Elevated to north and south. The track that found and lost\r\nitself a thousand times in the flare and tremor of the innumerable\r\nlights; the moony sheen of the electrics mixing with the reddish points\r\nand blots of gas far and near; the architectural shapes of houses and\r\nchurches and towers, rescued by the obscurity from all that was ignoble\r\nin them, and the coming and going of the trains marking the stations with\r\nvivider or fainter plumes of flame-shot steam-formed an incomparable\r\nperspective. They often talked afterward of the superb spectacle, which\r\nin a city full of painters nightly works its unrecorded miracles; and\r\nthey were just to the Arachne roof spun in iron over the cross street on\r\nwhich they ran to the depot; but for the present they were mostly\r\ninarticulate before it. They had another moment of rich silence when they\r\npaused in the gallery that leads from the Elevated station to the\r\nwaiting-rooms in the Central Depot and looked down upon the great night\r\ntrains lying on the tracks dim under the rain of gas-lights that starred\r\nwithout dispersing the vast darkness of the place. What forces, what\r\nfates, slept in these bulks which would soon be hurling themselves north\r\nand south and west through the night! Now they waited there like fabled\r\nmonsters of Arab story ready for the magician\'s touch, tractable,\r\nreckless, will-less--organized lifelessness full of a strange semblance\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe Marches admired the impressive sight with a thrill of patriotic pride\r\nin the fact that the whole world perhaps could not afford just the like.\r\nThen they hurried down to the ticket-offices, and he got her a lower\r\nberth in the Boston sleeper, and went with her to the car. They made the\r\nmost of the fact that her berth was in the very middle of the car; and\r\nshe promised to write as soon as she reached home. She promised also\r\nthat, having seen the limitations of New York in respect to flats, she\r\nwould not be hard on him if he took something not quite ideal. Only he\r\nmust remember that it was not to be above Twentieth Street nor below\r\nWashington Square; it must not be higher than the third floor; it must\r\nhave an elevator, steam heat, hail-boys, and a pleasant janitor. These\r\nwere essentials; if he could not get them, then they must do without. But\r\nhe must get them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nMrs. March was one of those wives who exact a more rigid adherence to\r\ntheir ideals from their husbands than from themselves. Early in their\r\nmarried life she had taken charge of him in all matters which she\r\nconsidered practical. She did not include the business of bread-winning\r\nin these; that was an affair that might safely be left to his\r\nabsent-minded, dreamy inefficiency, and she did not interfere with him\r\nthere. But in such things as rehanging the pictures, deciding on a summer\r\nboarding-place, taking a seaside cottage, repapering rooms, choosing\r\nseats at the theatre, seeing what the children ate when she was not at\r\ntable, shutting the cat out at night, keeping run of calls and\r\ninvitations, and seeing if the furnace was dampered, he had failed her so\r\noften that she felt she could not leave him the slightest discretion in\r\nregard to a flat. Her total distrust of his judgment in the matters cited\r\nand others like them consisted with the greatest admiration of his mind\r\nand respect for his character. She often said that if he would only bring\r\nthese to bear in such exigencies he would be simply perfect; but she had\r\nlong given up his ever doing so. She subjected him, therefore, to an iron\r\ncode, but after proclaiming it she was apt to abandon him to the native\r\nlawlessness of his temperament. She expected him in this event to do as\r\nhe pleased, and she resigned herself to it with considerable comfort in\r\nholding him accountable. He learned to expect this, and after suffering\r\nkeenly from her disappointment with whatever he did he waited patiently\r\ntill she forgot her grievance and began to extract what consolation lurks\r\nin the irreparable. She would almost admit at moments that what he had\r\ndone was a very good thing, but she reserved the right to return in full\r\nforce to her original condemnation of it; and she accumulated each act of\r\nindependent volition in witness and warning against him. Their mass\r\noppressed but never deterred him. He expected to do the wrong thing when\r\nleft to his own devices, and he did it without any apparent recollection\r\nof his former misdeeds and their consequences. There was a good deal of\r\ncomedy in it all, and some tragedy.\r\n\r\nHe now experienced a certain expansion, such as husbands of his kind will\r\nimagine, on going back to his hotel alone. It was, perhaps, a revulsion\r\nfrom the pain of parting; and he toyed with the idea of Mrs. Grosvenor\r\nGreen\'s apartment, which, in its preposterous unsuitability, had a\r\nstrange attraction. He felt that he could take it with less risk than\r\nanything else they had seen, but he said he would look at all the other\r\nplaces in town first. He really spent the greater part of the next day in\r\nhunting up the owner of an apartment that had neither steam heat nor an\r\nelevator, but was otherwise perfect, and trying to get him to take less\r\nthan the agent asked. By a curious psychical operation he was able, in\r\nthe transaction, to work himself into quite a passionate desire for the\r\napartment, while he held the Grosvenor Green apartment in the background\r\nof his mind as something that he could return to as altogether more\r\nsuitable. He conducted some simultaneous negotiation for a furnished\r\nhouse, which enhanced still more the desirability of the Grosvenor Green\r\napartment. Toward evening he went off at a tangent far up-town, so as to\r\nbe able to tell his wife how utterly preposterous the best there would be\r\nas compared even with this ridiculous Grosvenor Green gimcrackery. It is\r\nhard to report the processes of his sophistication; perhaps this, again,\r\nmay best be left to the marital imagination.\r\n\r\nHe rang at the last of these up-town apartments as it was falling dusk,\r\nand it was long before the janitor appeared. Then the man was very surly,\r\nand said if he looked at the flat now he would say it was too dark, like\r\nall the rest. His reluctance irritated March in proportion to his\r\ninsincerity in proposing to look at it at all. He knew he did not mean to\r\ntake it under any circumstances; that he was going to use his inspection\r\nof it in dishonest justification of his disobedience to his wife; but he\r\nput on an air of offended dignity. "If you don\'t wish to show the\r\napartment," he said, "I don\'t care to see it."\r\n\r\nThe man groaned, for he was heavy, and no doubt dreaded the stairs. He\r\nscratched a match on his thigh, and led the way up. March was sorry for\r\nhim, and he put his fingers on a quarter in his waistcoat-pocket to give\r\nhim at parting. At the same time, he had to trump up an objection to the\r\nflat. This was easy, for it was advertised as containing ten rooms, and\r\nhe found the number eked out with the bath-room and two large closets.\r\n"It\'s light enough," said March, "but I don\'t see how you make out ten\r\nrooms."\r\n\r\n"There\'s ten rooms," said the man, deigning no proof.\r\n\r\nMarch took his fingers off the quarter, and went down-stairs and out of\r\nthe door without another word. It would be wrong, it would be impossible,\r\nto give the man anything after such insolence. He reflected, with shame,\r\nthat it was also cheaper to punish than forgive him.\r\n\r\nHe returned to his hotel prepared for any desperate measure, and\r\nconvinced now that the Grosvenor Green apartment was not merely the only\r\nthing left for him, but was, on its own merits, the best thing in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was waiting for him in the reading-room, and it gave March the\r\ncurious thrill with which a man closes with temptation when he said:\r\n"Look here! Why don\'t you take that woman\'s flat in the Xenophon? She\'s\r\nbeen at the agents again, and they\'ve been at me. She likes your look--or\r\nMrs. March\'s--and I guess you can have it at a pretty heavy discount from\r\nthe original price. I\'m authorized to say you can have it for one\r\nseventy-five a month, and I don\'t believe it would be safe for you to\r\noffer one fifty."\r\n\r\nMarch shook his head, and dropped a mask of virtuous rejection over his\r\ncorrupt acquiescence. "It\'s too small for us--we couldn\'t squeeze into\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why, look here!" Fulkerson persisted. "How many rooms do you people\r\nwant?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to have a place to work--"\r\n\r\n"Of course! And you\'ve got to have it at the Fifth Wheel office."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of that," March began. "I suppose I could do my work at\r\nthe office, as there\'s not much writing--"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course you can\'t do your work at home. You just come round with\r\nme now, and look at that again."\r\n\r\n"No; I can\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"I--I\'ve got to dine."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Fulkerson. "Dine with me. I want to take you round to a\r\nlittle Italian place that I know."\r\n\r\nOne may trace the successive steps of March\'s descent in this simple\r\nmatter with the same edification that would attend the study of the\r\nself-delusions and obfuscations of a man tempted to crime. The process is\r\nprobably not at all different, and to the philosophical mind the kind of\r\nresult is unimportant; the process is everything.\r\n\r\nFulkerson led him down one block and half across another to the steps of\r\na small dwelling-house, transformed, like many others, into a restaurant\r\nof the Latin ideal, with little or no structural change from the pattern\r\nof the lower middle-class New York home. There were the corroded\r\nbrownstone steps, the mean little front door, and the cramped entry with\r\nits narrow stairs by which ladies could go up to a dining-room appointed\r\nfor them on the second floor; the parlors on the first were set about\r\nwith tables, where men smoked cigarettes between the courses, and a\r\nsingle waiter ran swiftly to and fro with plates and dishes, and,\r\nexchanged unintelligible outcries with a cook beyond a slide in the back\r\nparlor. He rushed at the new-comers, brushed the soiled table-cloth\r\nbefore them with a towel on his arm, covered its worst stains with a\r\nnapkin, and brought them, in their order, the vermicelli soup, the fried\r\nfish, the cheese-strewn spaghetti, the veal cutlets, the tepid roast fowl\r\nand salad, and the wizened pear and coffee which form the dinner at such\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n"Ah, this is nice!" said Fulkerson, after the laying of the charitable\r\nnapkin, and he began to recognize acquaintances, some of whom he\r\ndescribed to March as young literary men and artists with whom they\r\nshould probably have to do; others were simply frequenters of the place,\r\nand were of all nationalities and religions apparently--at least, several\r\nwere Hebrews and Cubans. "You get a pretty good slice of New York here,"\r\nhe said, "all except the frosting on top. That you won\'t find much at\r\nMaroni\'s, though you will occasionally. I don\'t mean the ladies ever, of\r\ncourse." The ladies present seemed harmless and reputable-looking people\r\nenough, but certainly they were not of the first fashion, and, except in\r\na few instances, not Americans. "It\'s like cutting straight down through\r\na fruitcake," Fulkerson went on, "or a mince-pie, when you don\'t know who\r\nmade the pie; you get a little of everything." He ordered a small flask\r\nof Chianti with the dinner, and it came in its pretty wicker jacket.\r\nMarch smiled upon it with tender reminiscence, and Fulkerson laughed.\r\n"Lights you up a little. I brought old Dryfoos here one day, and he\r\nthought it was sweet-oil; that\'s the kind of bottle they used to have it\r\nin at the country drug-stores."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I remember now; but I\'d totally forgotten it," said March. "How far\r\nback that goes! Who\'s Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"Dryfoos?" Fulkerson, still smiling, tore off a piece of the half-yard of\r\nFrench loaf which had been supplied them, with two pale, thin disks of\r\nbutter, and fed it into himself. "Old Dryfoos? Well, of course! I call\r\nhim old, but he ain\'t so very. About fifty, or along there."\r\n\r\n"No," said March, "that isn\'t very old--or not so old as it used to be."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose you\'ve got to know about him, anyway," said Fulkerson,\r\nthoughtfully. "And I\'ve been wondering just how I should tell you. Can\'t\r\nalways make out exactly how much of a Bostonian you really are! Ever been\r\nout in the natural-gas country?"\r\n\r\n"No," said March. "I\'ve had a good deal of curiosity about it, but I\'ve\r\nnever been able to get away except in summer, and then we always\r\npreferred to go over the old ground, out to Niagara and back through\r\nCanada, the route we took on our wedding journey. The children like it as\r\nmuch as we do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Fulkerson. "Well, the natural-gas country is worth\r\nseeing. I don\'t mean the Pittsburg gas-fields, but out in Northern Ohio\r\nand Indiana around Moffitt--that\'s the place in the heart of the gas\r\nregion that they\'ve been booming so. Yes, you ought to see that country.\r\nIf you haven\'t been West for a good many years, you haven\'t got any idea\r\nhow old the country looks. You remember how the fields used to be all\r\nfull of stumps?"\r\n\r\n"I should think so."\r\n\r\n"Well, you won\'t see any stumps now. All that country out around Moffitt\r\nis just as smooth as a checker-board, and looks as old as England. You\r\nknow how we used to burn the stumps out; and then somebody invented a\r\nstump-extractor, and we pulled them out with a yoke of oxen. Now they\r\njust touch \'em off with a little dynamite, and they\'ve got a cellar dug\r\nand filled up with kindling ready for housekeeping whenever you want it.\r\nOnly they haven\'t got any use for kindling in that country--all gas. I\r\nrode along on the cars through those level black fields at corn-planting\r\ntime, and every once in a while I\'d come to a place with a piece of\r\nragged old stove-pipe stickin\' up out of the ground, and blazing away\r\nlike forty, and a fellow ploughing all round it and not minding it any\r\nmore than if it was spring violets. Horses didn\'t notice it, either.\r\nWell, they\'ve always known about the gas out there; they say there are\r\nplaces in the woods where it\'s been burning ever since the country was\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n"But when you come in sight of Moffitt--my, oh, my! Well, you come in\r\nsmell of it about as soon. That gas out there ain\'t odorless, like the\r\nPittsburg gas, and so it\'s perfectly safe; but the smell isn\'t bad--about\r\nas bad as the finest kind of benzine. Well, the first thing that strikes\r\nyou when you come to Moffitt is the notion that there has been a good\r\nwarm, growing rain, and the town\'s come up overnight. That\'s in the\r\nsuburbs, the annexes, and additions. But it ain\'t shabby--no shanty-farm\r\nbusiness; nice brick and frame houses, some of \'em Queen Anne style, and\r\nall of \'em looking as if they had come to stay. And when you drive up\r\nfrom the depot you think everybody\'s moving. Everything seems to be piled\r\ninto the street; old houses made over, and new ones going up everywhere.\r\nYou know the kind of street Main Street always used to be in our\r\nsection--half plank-road and turnpike, and the rest mud-hole, and a lot\r\nof stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher\r\nthan the back, and here and there a decent building with the gable end to\r\nthe public; and a court-house and jail and two taverns and three or four\r\nchurches. Well, they\'re all there in Moffitt yet, but architecture has\r\nstruck it hard, and they\'ve got a lot of new buildings that needn\'t be\r\nashamed of themselves anywhere; the new court-house is as big as St.\r\nPeter\'s, and the Grand Opera-house is in the highest style of the art.\r\nYou can\'t buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot\r\nin New York--or you couldn\'t when the boom was on; I saw the place just\r\nwhen the boom was in its prime. I went out there to work the newspapers\r\nin the syndicate business, and I got one of their men to write me a real\r\nbright, snappy account of the gas; and they just took me in their arms\r\nand showed me everything. Well, it was wonderful, and it was beautiful,\r\ntoo! To see a whole community stirred up like that was--just like a big\r\nboy, all hope and high spirits, and no discount on the remotest future;\r\nnothing but perpetual boom to the end of time--I tell you it warmed your\r\nblood. Why, there were some things about it that made you think what a\r\nnice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together,\r\ninstead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook, and devil take\r\nthe hindmost. They made up their minds at Moffitt that if they wanted\r\ntheir town to grow they\'d got to keep their gas public property. So they\r\nextended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole\r\ngas region round there; and then the city took possession of every well\r\nthat was put down, and held it for the common good. Anybody that\'s a mind\r\nto come to Moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas\r\nhe wants free; and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas\r\nyou want to heat and light your private house. The people hold on to it\r\nfor themselves, and, as I say, it\'s a grand sight to see a whole\r\ncommunity hanging together and working for the good of all, instead of\r\nsplitting up into as many different cut-throats as there are able-bodied\r\ncitizens. See that fellow?" Fulkerson broke off, and indicated with a\r\ntwirl of his head a short, dark, foreign-looking man going out of the\r\ndoor. "They say that fellow\'s a Socialist. I think it\'s a shame they\'re\r\nallowed to come here. If they don\'t like the way we manage our affairs\r\nlet \'em stay at home," Fulkerson continued. "They do a lot of mischief,\r\nshooting off their mouths round here. I believe in free speech and all\r\nthat; but I\'d like to see these fellows shut up in jail and left to jaw\r\none another to death. We don\'t want any of their poison."\r\n\r\nMarch did not notice the vanishing Socialist. He was watching, with a\r\nteasing sense of familiarity, a tall, shabbily dressed, elderly man, who\r\nhad just come in. He had the aquiline profile uncommon among Germans, and\r\nyet March recognized him at once as German. His long, soft beard and\r\nmustache had once been fair, and they kept some tone of their yellow in\r\nthe gray to which they had turned. His eyes were full, and his lips and\r\nchin shaped the beard to the noble outline which shows in the beards the\r\nItalian masters liked to paint for their Last Suppers. His carriage was\r\nerect and soldierly, and March presently saw that he had lost his left\r\nhand. He took his place at a table where the overworked waiter found time\r\nto cut up his meat and put everything in easy reach of his right hand.\r\n\r\n"Well," Fulkerson resumed, "they took me round everywhere in Moffitt, and\r\nshowed me their big wells--lit \'em up for a private view, and let me hear\r\nthem purr with the soft accents of a mass-meeting of locomotives. Why,\r\nwhen they let one of these wells loose in a meadow that they\'d piped it\r\ninto temporarily, it drove the flame away forty feet from the mouth of\r\nthe pipe and blew it over half an acre of ground. They say when they let\r\none of their big wells burn away all winter before they had learned how\r\nto control it, that well kept up a little summer all around it; the grass\r\nstayed green, and the flowers bloomed all through the winter. I don\'t\r\nknow whether it\'s so or not. But I can believe anything of natural gas.\r\nMy! but it was beautiful when they turned on the full force of that well\r\nand shot a roman candle into the gas--that\'s the way they light it--and a\r\nplume of fire about twenty feet wide and seventy-five feet high, all red\r\nand yellow and violet, jumped into the sky, and that big roar shook the\r\nground under your feet! You felt like saying:\r\n\r\n"\'Don\'t trouble yourself; I\'m perfectly convinced. I believe in Moffitt.\'\r\nWe-e-e-ll!" drawled Fulkerson, with a long breath, "that\'s where I met\r\nold Dryfoos."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!--Dryfoos," said March. He observed that the waiter had brought\r\nthe old one-handed German a towering glass of beer.\r\n\r\n"Yes," Fulkerson laughed. "We\'ve got round to Dryfoos again. I thought I\r\ncould cut a long story short, but I seem to be cutting a short story\r\nlong. If you\'re not in a hurry, though--"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. Go on as long as you like."\r\n\r\n"I met him there in the office of a real-estate man--speculator, of\r\ncourse; everybody was, in Moffitt; but a first-rate fellow, and\r\npublic-spirited as all get-out; and when Dryfoos left he told me about\r\nhim. Dryfoos was an old Pennsylvania Dutch farmer, about three or four\r\nmiles out of Moffitt, and he\'d lived there pretty much all his life;\r\nfather was one of the first settlers. Everybody knew he had the right\r\nstuff in him, but he was slower than molasses in January, like those\r\nPennsylvania Dutch. He\'d got together the largest and handsomest farm\r\nanywhere around there; and he was making money on it, just like he was in\r\nsome business somewhere; he was a very intelligent man; he took the\r\npapers and kept himself posted; but he was awfully old-fashioned in his\r\nideas. He hung on to the doctrines as well as the dollars of the dads; it\r\nwas a real thing with him. Well, when the boom began to come he hated it\r\nawfully, and he fought it. He used to write communications to the weekly\r\nnewspaper in Moffitt--they\'ve got three dailies there now--and throw cold\r\nwater on the boom. He couldn\'t catch on no way. It made him sick to hear\r\nthe clack that went on about the gas the whole while, and that stirred up\r\nthe neighborhood and got into his family. Whenever he\'d hear of a man\r\nthat had been offered a big price for his land and was going to sell out\r\nand move into town, he\'d go and labor with him and try to talk him out of\r\nit, and tell him how long his fifteen or twenty thousand would last him\r\nto live on, and shake the Standard Oil Company before him, and try to\r\nmake him believe it wouldn\'t be five years before the Standard owned the\r\nwhole region.\r\n\r\n"Of course, he couldn\'t do anything with them. When a man\'s offered a big\r\nprice for his farm, he don\'t care whether it\'s by a secret emissary from\r\nthe Standard Oil or not; he\'s going to sell and get the better of the\r\nother fellow if he can. Dryfoos couldn\'t keep the boom out of his own\r\nfamily even. His wife was with him. She thought whatever he said and did\r\nwas just as right as if it had been thundered down from Sinai. But the\r\nyoung folks were sceptical, especially the girls that had been away to\r\nschool. The boy that had been kept at home because he couldn\'t be spared\r\nfrom helping his father manage the farm was more like him, but they\r\ncontrived to stir the boy up--with the hot end of the boom, too. So when\r\na fellow came along one day and offered old Dryfoos a cool hundred\r\nthousand for his farm, it was all up with Dryfoos. He\'d \'a\' liked to \'a\'\r\nkept the offer to himself and not done anything about it, but his vanity\r\nwouldn\'t let him do that; and when he let it out in his family the girls\r\noutvoted him. They just made him sell.\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t sell all. He kept about eighty acres that was off in some\r\npiece by itself, but the three hundred that had the old brick house on\r\nit, and the big barn--that went, and Dryfoos bought him a place in\r\nMoffitt and moved into town to live on the interest of his money. Just\r\nwhat he had scolded and ridiculed everybody else for doing. Well, they\r\nsay that at first he seemed like he would go crazy. He hadn\'t anything to\r\ndo. He took a fancy to that land-agent, and he used to go and set in his\r\noffice and ask him what he should do. \'I hain\'t got any horses, I hain\'t\r\ngot any cows, I hain\'t got any pigs, I hain\'t got any chickens. I hain\'t\r\ngot anything to do from sun-up to sun-down.\' The fellow said the tears\r\nused to run down the old fellow\'s cheeks, and if he hadn\'t been so busy\r\nhimself he believed he should \'a\' cried, too. But most o\' people thought\r\nold Dryfoos was down in the mouth because he hadn\'t asked more for his\r\nfarm, when he wanted to buy it back and found they held it at a hundred\r\nand fifty thousand. People couldn\'t believe he was just homesick and\r\nheartsick for the old place. Well, perhaps he was sorry he hadn\'t asked\r\nmore; that\'s human nature, too.\r\n\r\n"After a while something happened. That land-agent used to tell Dryfoos\r\nto get out to Europe with his money and see life a little, or go and live\r\nin Washington, where he could be somebody; but Dryfoos wouldn\'t, and he\r\nkept listening to the talk there, and all of a sudden he caught on. He\r\ncame into that fellow\'s one day with a plan for cutting up the eighty\r\nacres he\'d kept into town lots; and he\'d got it all plotted out so-well,\r\nand had so many practical ideas about it, that the fellow was astonished.\r\nHe went right in with him, as far as Dryfoos would let him, and glad of\r\nthe chance; and they were working the thing for all it was worth when I\r\nstruck Moffitt. Old Dryfoos wanted me to go out and see the Dryfoos &\r\nHendry Addition--guess he thought maybe I\'d write it up; and he drove me\r\nout there himself. Well, it was funny to see a town made: streets driven\r\nthrough; two rows of shadetrees, hard and soft, planted; cellars dug and\r\nhouses put up--regular Queen Anne style, too, with stained glass--all at\r\nonce. Dryfoos apologized for the streets because they were hand-made;\r\nsaid they expected their street-making machine Tuesday, and then they\r\nintended to push things."\r\n\r\nFulkerson enjoyed the effect of his picture on March for a moment, and\r\nthen went on: "He was mighty intelligent, too, and he questioned me up\r\nabout my business as sharp as I ever was questioned; seemed to kind of\r\nstrike his fancy; I guess he wanted to find out if there was any money in\r\nit. He was making money, hand over hand, then; and he never stopped\r\nspeculating and improving till he\'d scraped together three or four\r\nhundred thousand dollars, they said a million, but they like round\r\nnumbers at Moffitt, and I guess half a million would lay over it\r\ncomfortably and leave a few thousands to spare, probably. Then he came on\r\nto New York."\r\n\r\nFulkerson struck a match against the ribbed side of the porcelain cup\r\nthat held the matches in the centre of the table, and lit a cigarette,\r\nwhich he began to smoke, throwing his head back with a leisurely effect,\r\nas if he had got to the end of at least as much of his story as he meant\r\nto tell without prompting.\r\n\r\nMarch asked him the desired question. "What in the world for?"\r\n\r\nFulkerson took out his cigarette and said, with a smile: "To spend his\r\nmoney, and get his daughters into the old Knickerbocker society. Maybe he\r\nthought they were all the same kind of Dutch."\r\n\r\n"And has he succeeded?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'re not social leaders yet. But it\'s only a question of\r\ntime--generation or two--especially if time\'s money, and if \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' is the success it\'s bound to be."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say, Fulkerson," said March, with a half-doubting,\r\nhalf-daunted laugh, "that he\'s your Angel?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I mean to say," returned Fulkerson. "I ran onto him in\r\nBroadway one day last summer. If you ever saw anybody in your life;\r\nyou\'re sure to meet him in Broadway again, sooner or later. That\'s the\r\nphilosophy of the bunco business; country people from the same\r\nneighborhood are sure to run up against each other the first time they\r\ncome to New York. I put out my hand, and I said, \'Isn\'t this Mr. Dryfoos\r\nfrom Moffitt?\' He didn\'t seem to have any use for my hand; he let me keep\r\nit, and he squared those old lips of his till his imperial stuck straight\r\nout. Ever see Bernhardt in \'L\'Etrangere\'? Well, the American husband is\r\nold Dryfoos all over; no mustache; and hay-colored chin-whiskers cut\r\nslanting froze the corners of his mouth. He cocked his little gray eyes\r\nat me, and says he: \'Yes, young man; my name is Dryfoos, and I\'m from\r\nMoffitt. But I don\'t want no present of Longfellow\'s Works, illustrated;\r\nand I don\'t want to taste no fine teas; but I know a policeman that does;\r\nand if you\'re the son of my old friend Squire Strohfeldt, you\'d better\r\nget out.\' \'Well, then,\' said I, \'how would you like to go into the\r\nnewspaper syndicate business?\' He gave another look at me, and then he\r\nburst out laughing, and he grabbed my hand, and he just froze to it. I\r\nnever saw anybody so glad.\r\n\r\n"Well, the long and the short of it was that I asked him round here to\r\nMaroni\'s to dinner; and before we broke up for the night we had settled\r\nthe financial side of the plan that\'s brought you to New York."\r\n\r\n"I can see," said Fulkerson, who had kept his eyes fast on March\'s face,\r\n"that you don\'t more than half like the idea of Dryfoos. It ought to give\r\nyou more confidence in the thing than you ever had. You needn\'t be\r\nafraid," he added, with some feeling, "that I talked Dryfoos into the\r\nthing for my own advantage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear Fulkerson!" March protested, all the more fervently because\r\nhe was really a little guilty.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course not! I didn\'t mean you were. But I just happened to tell\r\nhim what I wanted to go into when I could see my way to it, and he caught\r\non of his own accord. The fact is," said Fulkerson, "I guess I\'d better\r\nmake a clean breast of it, now I\'m at it, Dryfoos wanted to get something\r\nfor that boy of his to do. He\'s in railroads himself, and he\'s in mines\r\nand other things, and he keeps busy, and he can\'t bear to have his boy\r\nhanging round the house doing nothing, like as if he was a girl. I told\r\nhim that the great object of a rich man was to get his son into just that\r\nfix, but he couldn\'t seem to see it, and the boy hated it himself. He\'s\r\ngot a good head, and he wanted to study for the ministry when they were\r\nall living together out on the farm; but his father had the old-fashioned\r\nideas about that. You know they used to think that any sort of stuff was\r\ngood enough to make a preacher out of; but they wanted the good timber\r\nfor business; and so the old man wouldn\'t let him. You\'ll see the fellow;\r\nyou\'ll like him; he\'s no fool, I can tell you; and he\'s going to be our\r\npublisher, nominally at first and actually when I\'ve taught him the ropes\r\na little."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nFulkerson stopped and looked at March, whom he saw lapsing into a serious\r\nsilence. Doubtless he divined his uneasiness with the facts that had been\r\ngiven him to digest. He pulled out his watch and glanced at it. "See\r\nhere, how would you like to go up to Forty-sixth street with me, and drop\r\nin on old Dryfoos? Now\'s your chance. He\'s going West tomorrow, and won\'t\r\nbe back for a month or so. They\'ll all be glad to see you, and you\'ll\r\nunderstand things better when you\'ve seen him and his family. I can\'t\r\nexplain."\r\n\r\nMarch reflected a moment. Then he said, with a wisdom that surprised him,\r\nfor he would have liked to yield to the impulse of his curiosity:\r\n"Perhaps we\'d better wait till Mrs. March comes down, and let things take\r\nthe usual course. The Dryfoos ladies will want to call on her as the\r\nlast-comer, and if I treated myself \'en garcon\' now, and paid the first\r\nvisit, it might complicate matters."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps you\'re right," said Fulkerson. "I don\'t know much about\r\nthese things, and I don\'t believe Ma Dryfoos does, either." He was on his\r\nlegs lighting another cigarette. "I suppose the girls are getting\r\nthemselves up in etiquette, though. Well, then, let\'s have a look at the\r\n\'Every Other Week\' building, and then, if you like your quarters there,\r\nyou can go round and close for Mrs. Green\'s flat."\r\n\r\nMarch\'s dormant allegiance to his wife\'s wishes had been roused by his\r\ndecision in favor of good social usage. "I don\'t think I shall take the\r\nflat," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t reject it without giving it another look, anyway. Come on!"\r\n\r\nHe helped March on with his light overcoat, and the little stir they made\r\nfor their departure caught the notice of the old German; he looked up\r\nfrom his beer at them. March was more than ever impressed with something\r\nfamiliar in his face. In compensation for his prudence in regard to the\r\nDryfooses he now indulged an impulse. He stepped across to where the old\r\nman sat, with his bald head shining like ivory under the gas-jet, and his\r\nfine patriarchal length of bearded mask taking picturesque lights and\r\nshadows, and put out his hand to him.\r\n\r\n"Lindau! Isn\'t this Mr. Lindau?"\r\n\r\nThe old man lifted himself slowly to his feet with mechanical politeness,\r\nand cautiously took March\'s hand. "Yes, my name is Lindau," he said,\r\nslowly, while he scanned March\'s face. Then he broke into a long cry.\r\n"Ah-h-h-h-h, my dear poy! my gong friendt! my-my--Idt is Passil Marge,\r\nnot zo? Ah, ha, ha, ha! How gladt I am to zee you! Why, I am gladt! And\r\nyou rememberdt me? You remember Schiller, and Goethe, and Uhland? And\r\nIndianapolis? You still lif in Indianapolis? It sheers my hardt to zee\r\nyou. But you are lidtle oldt, too? Tventy-five years makes a difference.\r\nAh, I am gladt! Dell me, idt is Passil Marge, not zo?"\r\n\r\nHe looked anxiously into March\'s face, with a gentle smile of mixed hope\r\nand doubt, and March said: "As sure as it\'s Berthold Lindau, and I guess\r\nit\'s you. And you remember the old times? You were as much of a boy as I\r\nwas, Lindau. Are you living in New York? Do you recollect how you tried\r\nto teach me to fence? I don\'t know how to this day, Lindau. How good you\r\nwere, and how patient! Do you remember how we used to sit up in the\r\nlittle parlor back of your printing-office, and read Die Rauber and Die\r\nTheilung der Erde and Die Glocke? And Mrs. Lindau? Is she with--"\r\n\r\n"Deadt--deadt long ago. Right after I got home from the war--tventy years\r\nago. But tell me, you are married? Children? Yes! Goodt! And how oldt are\r\nyou now?"\r\n\r\n"It makes me seventeen to see you, Lindau, but I\'ve got a son nearly as\r\nold."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ha, ha! Goodt! And where do you lif?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m just coming to live in New York," March said, looking over at\r\nFulkerson, who had been watching his interview with the perfunctory smile\r\nof sympathy that people put on at the meeting of old friends. "I want to\r\nintroduce you to my friend Mr. Fulkerson. He and I are going into a\r\nliterary enterprise here."\r\n\r\n"Ah! zo?" said the old man, with polite interest. He took Fulkerson\'s\r\nproffered hand, and they all stood talking a few moments together.\r\n\r\nThen Fulkerson said, with another look at his watch, "Well, March, we\'re\r\nkeeping Mr. Lindau from his dinner."\r\n\r\n"Dinner!" cried the old man. "Idt\'s better than breadt and meadt to see\r\nMr. Marge!"\r\n\r\n"I must be going, anyway," said March. "But I must see you again soon,\r\nLindau. Where do you live? I want a long talk."\r\n\r\n"And I. You will find me here at dinner-time." said the old man. "It is\r\nthe best place"; and March fancied him reluctant to give another address.\r\n\r\nTo cover his consciousness he answered, gayly: "Then, it\'s \'auf\r\nwiedersehen\' with us. Well!"\r\n\r\n"Also!" The old man took his hand, and made a mechanical movement with\r\nhis mutilated arm, as if he would have taken it in a double clasp. He\r\nlaughed at himself. "I wanted to gif you the other handt, too, but I gafe\r\nit to your gountry a goodt while ago."\r\n\r\n"To my country?" asked March, with a sense of pain, and yet lightly, as\r\nif it were a joke of the old man\'s. "Your country, too, Lindau?"\r\n\r\nThe old man turned very grave, and said, almost coldly, "What gountry\r\nhass a poor man got, Mr. Marge?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you ought to have a share in the one you helped to save for us\r\nrich men, Lindau," March returned, still humoring the joke.\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled sadly, but made no answer as he sat down again.\r\n\r\n"Seems to be a little soured," said Fulkerson, as they went down the\r\nsteps. He was one of those Americans whose habitual conception of life is\r\nunalloyed prosperity. When any experience or observation of his went\r\ncounter to it he suffered--something like physical pain. He eagerly\r\nshrugged away the impression left upon his buoyancy by Lindau, and added\r\nto March\'s continued silence, "What did I tell you about meeting every\r\nman in New York that you ever knew before?"\r\n\r\n"I never expected to meat Lindau in the world again," said March, more to\r\nhimself than to Fulkerson. "I had an impression that he had been killed\r\nin the war. I almost wish he had been."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello, now!" cried Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nMarch laughed, but went on soberly: "He was a man predestined to\r\nadversity, though. When I first knew him out in Indianapolis he was\r\nstarving along with a sick wife and a sick newspaper. It was before the\r\nGermans had come over to the Republicans generally, but Lindau was\r\nfighting the anti-slavery battle just as naturally at Indianapolis in\r\n1858 as he fought behind the barricades at Berlin in 1848. And yet he was\r\nalways such a gentle soul! And so generous! He taught me German for the\r\nlove of it; he wouldn\'t spoil his pleasure by taking a cent from me; he\r\nseemed to get enough out of my being young and enthusiastic, and out of\r\nprophesying great things for me. I wonder what the poor old fellow is\r\ndoing here, with that one hand of his?"\r\n\r\n"Not amassing a very \'handsome pittance,\' I guess, as Artemus Ward would\r\nsay," said Fulkerson, getting back some of his lightness. "There are lots\r\nof two-handed fellows in New York that are not doing much better, I\r\nguess. Maybe he gets some writing on the German papers."\r\n\r\n"I hope so. He\'s one of the most accomplished men! He used to be a\r\nsplendid musician--pianist--and knows eight or ten languages."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s astonishing," said Fulkerson, "how much lumber those Germans\r\ncan carry around in their heads all their lives, and never work it up\r\ninto anything. It\'s a pity they couldn\'t do the acquiring, and let out\r\nthe use of their learning to a few bright Americans. We could make things\r\nhum, if we could arrange \'em that way."\r\n\r\nHe talked on, unheeded by March, who went along half-consciously\r\ntormented by his lightness in the pensive memories the meeting with\r\nLindau had called up. Was this all that sweet, unselfish nature could\r\ncome to? What a homeless old age at that meagre Italian table d\'hote,\r\nwith that tall glass of beer for a half-hour\'s oblivion! That shabby\r\ndress, that pathetic mutilation! He must have a pension, twelve dollars a\r\nmonth, or eighteen, from a grateful country. But what else did he eke out\r\nwith?\r\n\r\n"Well, here we are," said Fulkerson, cheerily. He ran up the steps before\r\nMarch, and opened the carpenter\'s temporary valve in the door frame, and\r\nled the way into a darkness smelling sweetly of unpainted wood-work and\r\nnewly dried plaster; their feet slipped on shavings and grated on sand.\r\nHe scratched a match, and found a candle, and then walked about up and\r\ndown stairs, and lectured on the advantages of the place. He had fitted\r\nup bachelor apartments for himself in the house, and said that he was\r\ngoing to have a flat to let on the top floor. "I didn\'t offer it to you\r\nbecause I supposed you\'d be too proud to live over your shop; and it\'s\r\ntoo small, anyway; only five rooms."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s too small," said March, shirking the other point.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, here\'s the room I intend for your office," said Fulkerson,\r\nshowing him into a large back parlor one flight up. "You\'ll have it quiet\r\nfrom the street noises here, and you can be at home or not, as you\r\nplease. There\'ll be a boy on the stairs to find out. Now, you see, this\r\nmakes the Grosvenor Green flat practicable, if you want it."\r\n\r\nMarch felt the forces of fate closing about him and pushing him to a\r\ndecision. He feebly fought them off till he could have another look at\r\nthe flat. Then, baked and subdued still more by the unexpected presence\r\nof Mrs. Grosvenor Green herself, who was occupying it so as to be able to\r\nshow it effectively, he took it. He was aware more than ever of its\r\nabsurdities; he knew that his wife would never cease to hate it; but he\r\nhad suffered one of those eclipses of the imagination to which men of his\r\ntemperament are subject, and into which he could see no future for his\r\ndesires. He felt a comfort in irretrievably committing himself, and\r\nexchanging the burden of indecision for the burden of responsibility.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Fulkerson, as they walked back to his hotel\r\ntogether, "but you might fix it up with that lone widow and her pretty\r\ndaughter to take part of their house here." He seemed to be reminded of\r\nit by the fact of passing the house, and March looked up at its dark\r\nfront. He could not have told exactly why he felt a pang of remorse at\r\nthe sight, and doubtless it was more regret for having taken the\r\nGrosvenor Green flat than for not having taken the widow\'s rooms. Still,\r\nhe could not forget her wistfulness when his wife and he were looking at\r\nthem, and her disappointment when they decided against them. He had\r\ntoyed, in his after-talk to Mrs. March, with a sort of hypothetical\r\nobligation they had to modify their plans so as to meet the widow\'s want\r\nof just such a family as theirs; they had both said what a blessing it\r\nwould be to her, and what a pity they could not do it; but they had\r\ndecided very distinctly that they could not. Now it seemed to him that\r\nthey might; and he asked himself whether he had not actually departed as\r\nmuch from their ideal as if he had taken board with the widow. Suddenly\r\nit seemed to him that his wife asked him this, too.\r\n\r\n"I reckon," said Fulkerson, "that she could have arranged to give you\r\nyour meals in your rooms, and it would have come to about the same thing\r\nas housekeeping."\r\n\r\n"No sort of boarding can be the same as house-keeping," said March. "I\r\nwant my little girl to have the run of a kitchen, and I want the whole\r\nfamily to have the moral effect of housekeeping. It\'s demoralizing to\r\nboard, in every way; it isn\'t a home, if anybody else takes the care of\r\nit off your hands."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose so," Fulkerson assented; but March\'s words had a hollow\r\nring to himself, and in his own mind he began to retaliate his\r\ndissatisfaction upon Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nHe parted from him on the usual terms outwardly, but he felt obscurely\r\nabused by Fulkerson in regard to the Dryfooses, father and son. He did\r\nnot know but Fulkerson had taken an advantage of him in allowing him to\r\ncommit himself to their enterprise without fully and frankly telling him\r\nwho and what his backer was; he perceived that with young Dryfoos as the\r\npublisher and Fulkerson as the general director of the paper there might\r\nbe very little play for his own ideas of its conduct. Perhaps it was the\r\nhurt to his vanity involved by the recognition of this fact that made him\r\nforget how little choice he really had in the matter, and how, since he\r\nhad not accepted the offer to edit the insurance paper, nothing remained\r\nfor him but to close with Fulkerson. In this moment of suspicion and\r\nresentment he accused Fulkerson of hastening his decision in regard to\r\nthe Grosvenor Green apartment; he now refused to consider it a decision,\r\nand said to himself that if he felt disposed to do so he would send Mrs.\r\nGreen a note reversing it in the morning. But he put it all off till\r\nmorning with his clothes, when he went to bed, he put off even thinking\r\nwhat his wife would say; he cast Fulkerson and his constructive treachery\r\nout of his mind, too, and invited into it some pensive reveries of the\r\npast, when he still stood at the parting of the ways, and could take this\r\npath or that. In his middle life this was not possible; he must follow\r\nthe path chosen long ago, wherever, it led. He was not master of\r\nhimself, as he once seemed, but the servant of those he loved; if he\r\ncould do what he liked, perhaps he might renounce this whole New York\r\nenterprise, and go off somewhere out of the reach of care; but he could\r\nnot do what he liked, that was very clear. In the pathos of this\r\nconviction he dwelt compassionately upon the thought of poor old Lindau;\r\nhe resolved to make him accept a handsome sum of money--more than he\r\ncould spare, something that he would feel the loss of--in payment of the\r\nlessons in German and fencing given so long ago. At the usual rate for\r\nsuch lessons, his debt, with interest for twenty-odd years, would run\r\nvery far into the hundreds. Too far, he perceived, for his wife\'s joyous\r\napproval; he determined not to add the interest; or he believed that\r\nLindau would refuse the interest; he put a fine speech in his mouth,\r\nmaking him do so; and after that he got Lindau employment on \'Every Other\r\nWeek,\' and took care of him till he died.\r\n\r\nThrough all his melancholy and munificence he was aware of sordid\r\nanxieties for having taken the Grosvenor Green apartment. These began to\r\nassume visible, tangible shapes as he drowsed, and to became personal\r\nentities, from which he woke, with little starts, to a realization of\r\ntheir true nature, and then suddenly fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the accomplishment of the events which his reverie played with, there\r\nwas much that retroactively stamped it with prophecy, but much also that\r\nwas better than he forboded. He found that with regard to the Grosvenor\r\nGreen apartment he had not allowed for his wife\'s willingness to get any\r\nsort of roof over her head again after the removal from their old home,\r\nor for the alleviations that grow up through mere custom. The practical\r\nworkings of the apartment were not so bad; it had its good points, and\r\nafter the first sensation of oppression in it they began to feel the\r\nconvenience of its arrangement. They were at that time of life when\r\npeople first turn to their children\'s opinion with deference, and, in the\r\nloss of keenness in their own likes and dislikes, consult the young\r\npreferences which are still so sensitive. It went far to reconcile Mrs.\r\nMarch to the apartment that her children were pleased with its novelty;\r\nwhen this wore off for them, she had herself begun to find it much more\r\neasily manageable than a house. After she had put away several barrels of\r\ngimcracks, and folded up screens and rugs and skins, and carried them all\r\noff to the little dark store-room which the flat developed, she perceived\r\nat once a roominess and coziness in it unsuspected before. Then, when\r\npeople began to call, she had a pleasure, a superiority, in saying that\r\nit was a furnished apartment, and in disclaiming all responsibility for\r\nthe upholstery and decoration. If March was by, she always explained that\r\nit was Mr. March\'s fancy, and amiably laughed it off with her callers as\r\na mannish eccentricity. Nobody really seemed to think it otherwise than\r\npretty; and this again was a triumph for Mrs. March, because it showed\r\nhow inferior the New York taste was to the Boston taste in such matters.\r\n\r\nMarch submitted silently to his punishment, and laughed with her before\r\ncompany at his own eccentricity. She had been so preoccupied with the\r\nadjustment of the family to its new quarters and circumstances that the\r\ntime passed for laying his misgivings, if they were misgivings, about\r\nFulkerson before her, and when an occasion came for expressing them they\r\nhad themselves passed in the anxieties of getting forward the first\r\nnumber of \'Every Other Week.\' He kept these from her, too, and the\r\nbusiness that brought them to New York had apparently dropped into\r\nabeyance before the questions of domestic economy that presented and\r\nabsented themselves. March knew his wife to be a woman of good mind and\r\nin perfect sympathy with him, but he understood the limitations of her\r\nperspective; and if he was not too wise, he was too experienced to\r\nintrude upon it any affairs of his till her own were reduced to the right\r\norder and proportion. It would have been folly to talk to her of\r\nFulkerson\'s conjecturable uncandor while she was in doubt whether her\r\ncook would like the kitchen, or her two servants would consent to room\r\ntogether; and till it was decided what school Tom should go to, and\r\nwhether Bella should have lessons at home or not, the relation which\r\nMarch was to bear to the Dryfooses, as owner and publisher, was not to be\r\ndiscussed with his wife. He might drag it in, but he was aware that with\r\nher mind distracted by more immediate interests he could not get from her\r\nthat judgment, that reasoned divination, which he relied upon so much.\r\nShe would try, she would do her best, but the result would be a view\r\nclouded and discolored by the effort she must make.\r\n\r\nHe put the whole matter by, and gave himself to the details of the work\r\nbefore him. In this he found not only escape, but reassurance, for it\r\nbecame more and more apparent that whatever was nominally the structure\r\nof the business, a man of his qualifications and his instincts could not\r\nhave an insignificant place in it. He had also the consolation of liking\r\nhis work, and of getting an instant grasp of it that grew constantly\r\nfirmer and closer. The joy of knowing that he had not made a mistake was\r\ngreat. In giving rein to ambitions long forborne he seemed to get back to\r\nthe youth when he had indulged them first; and after half a lifetime\r\npassed in pursuits alien to his nature, he was feeling the serene\r\nhappiness of being mated through his work to his early love. From the\r\noutside the spectacle might have had its pathos, and it is not easy to\r\njustify such an experiment as he had made at his time of life, except\r\nupon the ground where he rested from its consideration--the ground of\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nHis work was more in his thoughts than himself, however; and as the time\r\nfor the publication of the first number of his periodical came nearer,\r\nhis cares all centred upon it. Without fixing any date, Fulkerson had\r\nannounced it, and pushed his announcements with the shameless vigor of a\r\nborn advertiser. He worked his interest with the press to the utmost, and\r\nparagraphs of a variety that did credit to his ingenuity were afloat\r\neverywhere. Some of them were speciously unfavorable in tone; they\r\ncriticised and even ridiculed the principles on which the new departure\r\nin literary journalism was based. Others defended it; others yet denied\r\nthat this rumored principle was really the principle. All contributed to\r\nmake talk. All proceeded from the same fertile invention.\r\n\r\nMarch observed with a degree of mortification that the talk was very\r\nlittle of it in the New York press; there the references to the novel\r\nenterprise were slight and cold. But Fulkerson said: "Don\'t mind that,\r\nold man. It\'s the whole country that makes or breaks a thing like this;\r\nNew York has very little to do with it. Now if it were a play, it would\r\nbe different. New York does make or break a play; but it doesn\'t make or\r\nbreak a book; it doesn\'t make or break a magazine. The great mass of the\r\nreaders are outside of New York, and the rural districts are what we have\r\ngot to go for. They don\'t read much in New York; they write, and talk\r\nabout what they\'ve written. Don\'t you worry."\r\n\r\nThe rumor of Fulkerson\'s connection with the enterprise accompanied many\r\nof the paragraphs, and he was able to stay March\'s thirst for employment\r\nby turning over to him from day to day heaps of the manuscripts which\r\nbegan to pour in from his old syndicate writers, as well as from\r\nadventurous volunteers all over the country. With these in hand March\r\nbegan practically to plan the first number, and to concrete a general\r\nscheme from the material and the experience they furnished. They had\r\nintended to issue the first number with the new year, and if it had been\r\nan affair of literature alone, it would have been very easy; but it was\r\nthe art leg they limped on, as Fulkerson phrased it. They had not merely\r\nto deal with the question of specific illustrations for this article or\r\nthat, but to decide the whole character of their illustrations, and first\r\nof all to get a design for a cover which should both ensnare the heedless\r\nand captivate the fastidious. These things did not come properly within\r\nMarch\'s province--that had been clearly understood--and for a while\r\nFulkerson tried to run the art leg himself. The phrase was again his, but\r\nit was simpler to make the phrase than to run the leg. The difficult\r\ngeneration, at once stiff-backed and slippery, with which he had to do in\r\nthis endeavor, reduced even so buoyant an optimist to despair, and after\r\nwasting some valuable weeks in trying to work the artists himself, he\r\ndetermined to get an artist to work them. But what artist? It could not\r\nbe a man with fixed reputation and a following: he would be too costly,\r\nand would have too many enemies among his brethren, even if he would\r\nconsent to undertake the job. Fulkerson had a man in mind, an artist,\r\ntoo, who would have been the very thing if he had been the thing at all.\r\nHe had talent enough, and his sort of talent would reach round the whole\r\nsituation, but, as Fulkerson said, he was as many kinds of an ass as he\r\nwas kinds of an artist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPG EDITOR\'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Anticipative homesickness\r\n    Any sort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of\r\n    Appearance made him doubt their ability to pay so much\r\n    As much of his story as he meant to tell without prompting\r\n    Considerable comfort in holding him accountable\r\n    Extract what consolation lurks in the irreparable\r\n    Flavors not very sharply distinguished from one another\r\n    Handsome pittance\r\n    He expected to do the wrong thing when left to his own devices\r\n    Hypothetical difficulty\r\n    Never-blooming shrub\r\n    Poverty as hopeless as any in the world\r\n    Seeming interested in points necessarily indifferent to him\r\n    Servant of those he loved\r\n    Sigh with which ladies recognize one another\'s martyrdom\r\n    Sorry he hadn\'t asked more; that\'s human nature\r\n    That isn\'t very old--or not so old as it used to be\r\n    Tried to be homesick for them, but failed\r\n    Turn to their children\'s opinion with deference\r\n    Wish we didn\'t always recognize the facts as we do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe evening when March closed with Mrs. Green\'s reduced offer, and\r\ndecided to take her apartment, the widow whose lodgings he had rejected\r\nsat with her daughter in an upper room at the back of her house. In the\r\nshaded glow of the drop-light she was sewing, and the girl was drawing at\r\nthe same table. From time to time, as they talked, the girl lifted her\r\nhead and tilted it a little on one side so as to get some desired effect\r\nof her work.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a mercy the cold weather holds off," said the mother. "We should\r\nhave to light the furnace, unless we wanted to scare everybody away with\r\na cold house; and I don\'t know who would take care of it, or what would\r\nbecome of us, every way."\r\n\r\n"They seem to have been scared away from a house that wasn\'t cold," said\r\nthe girl. "Perhaps they might like a cold one. But it\'s too early for\r\ncold yet. It\'s only just in the beginning of November."\r\n\r\n"The Messenger says they\'ve had a sprinkling of snow."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, at St. Barnaby! I don\'t know when they don\'t have sprinklings of\r\nsnow there. I\'m awfully glad we haven\'t got that winter before us."\r\n\r\nThe widow sighed as mothers do who feel the contrast their experience\r\nopposes to the hopeful recklessness of such talk as this. "We may have a\r\nworse winter here," she said, darkly.\r\n\r\n"Then I couldn\'t stand it," said the girl, "and I should go in for\r\nlighting out to Florida double-quick."\r\n\r\n"And how would you get to Florida?" demanded her mother, severely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, by the usual conveyance Pullman vestibuled train, I suppose. What\r\nmakes you so blue, mamma?" The girl was all the time sketching away,\r\nrubbing out, lifting her head for the effect, and then bending it over\r\nher work again without looking at her mother.\r\n\r\n"I am not blue, Alma. But I cannot endure this--this hopefulness of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Why? What harm does it do?"\r\n\r\n"Harm?" echoed the mother.\r\n\r\nPending the effort she must make in saying, the girl cut in: "Yes, harm.\r\nYou\'ve kept your despair dusted off and ready for use at an instant\'s\r\nnotice ever since we came, and what good has it done? I\'m going to keep\r\non hoping to the bitter end. That\'s what papa did."\r\n\r\nIt was what the Rev. Archibald Leighton had done with all the\r\nconsumptive\'s buoyancy. The morning he died he told them that now he had\r\nturned the point and was really going to get well. The cheerfulness was\r\nnot only in his disease, but in his temperament. Its excess was always a\r\nlittle against him in his church work, and Mrs. Leighton was right enough\r\nin feeling that if it had not been for the ballast of her instinctive\r\ndespondency he would have made shipwreck of such small chances of\r\nprosperity as befell him in life. It was not from him that his daughter\r\ngot her talent, though he had left her his temperament intact of his\r\nwidow\'s legal thirds. He was one of those men of whom the country people\r\nsay when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him. Mrs.\r\nLeighton had long eked out their income by taking a summer boarder or\r\ntwo, as a great favor, into her family; and when the greater need came,\r\nshe frankly gave up her house to the summer-folks (as they call them in\r\nthe country), and managed it for their comfort from the small quarter of\r\nit in which she shut herself up with her daughter.\r\n\r\nThe notion of shutting up is an exigency of the rounded period. The fact\r\nis, of course, that Alma Leighton was not shut up in any sense whatever.\r\nShe was the pervading light, if not force, of the house. She was a good\r\ncook, and she managed the kitchen with the help of an Irish girl, while\r\nher mother looked after the rest of the housekeeping. But she was not\r\nsystematic; she had inspiration but not discipline, and her mother\r\nmourned more over the days when Alma left the whole dinner to the Irish\r\ngirl than she rejoiced in those when one of Alma\'s great thoughts took\r\nform in a chicken-pie of incomparable savor or in a matchless pudding.\r\nThe off-days came when her artistic nature was expressing itself in\r\ncharcoal, for she drew to the admiration of all among the lady boarders\r\nwho could not draw. The others had their reserves; they readily conceded\r\nthat Alma had genius, but they were sure she needed instruction. On the\r\nother hand, they were not so radical as to agree with the old painter who\r\ncame every summer to paint the elms of the St. Barnaby meadows. He\r\ncontended that she needed to be a man in order to amount to anything; but\r\nin this theory he was opposed by an authority, of his own sex, whom the\r\nlady sketchers believed to speak with more impartiality in a matter\r\nconcerning them as much as Alma Leighton. He said that instruction would\r\ndo, and he was not only younger and handsomer, but he was fresher from\r\nthe schools than old Harrington, who, even the lady sketchers could see,\r\npainted in an obsolescent manner. His name was Beaton--Angus Beaton; but\r\nhe was not Scotch, or not more Scotch than Mary Queen of Scots was. His\r\nfather was a Scotchman, but Beaton was born in Syracuse, New York, and it\r\nhad taken only three years in Paris to obliterate many traces of native\r\nand ancestral manner in him. He wore his black beard cut shorter than his\r\nmustache, and a little pointed; he stood with his shoulders well thrown\r\nback and with a lateral curve of his person when he talked about art,\r\nwhich would alone have carried conviction even if he had not had a thick,\r\ndark bang coming almost to the brows of his mobile gray eyes, and had not\r\nspoken English with quick, staccato impulses, so as to give it the effect\r\nof epigrammatic and sententious French. One of the ladies said that you\r\nalways thought of him as having spoken French after it was over, and\r\naccused herself of wrong in not being able to feel afraid of him. None of\r\nthe ladies was afraid of him, though they could not believe that he was\r\nreally so deferential to their work as he seemed; and they knew, when he\r\nwould not criticise Mr. Harrington\'s work, that he was just acting from\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThey may or may not have known the deference with which he treated Alma\'s\r\nwork; but the girl herself felt that his abrupt, impersonal comment\r\nrecognized her as a real sister in art. He told her she ought to come to\r\nNew York, and draw in the League, or get into some painter\'s private\r\nclass; and it was the sense of duty thus appealed to which finally\r\nresulted in the hazardous experiment she and her mother were now making.\r\nThere were no logical breaks in the chain of their reasoning from past\r\nsuccess with boarders in St. Barnaby to future success with boarders in\r\nNew York. Of course the outlay was much greater. The rent of the\r\nfurnished house they had taken was such that if they failed their\r\nexperiment would be little less than ruinous.\r\n\r\nBut they were not going to fail; that was what Alma contended, with a\r\nhardy courage that her mother sometimes felt almost invited failure, if\r\nit did not deserve it. She was one of those people who believe that if\r\nyou dread harm enough it is less likely to happen. She acted on this\r\nsuperstition as if it were a religion.\r\n\r\n"If it had not been for my despair, as you call it, Alma," she answered,\r\n"I don\'t know where we should have been now."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we should have been in St. Barnaby," said the girl. "And if\r\nit\'s worse to be in New York, you see what your despair\'s done, mamma.\r\nBut what\'s the use? You meant well, and I don\'t blame you. You can\'t\r\nexpect even despair to come out always just the way you want it. Perhaps\r\nyou\'ve used too much of it." The girl laughed, and Mrs. Leighton laughed,\r\ntoo. Like every one else, she was not merely a prevailing mood, as people\r\nare apt to be in books, but was an irregularly spheroidal character, with\r\nsurfaces that caught the different lights of circumstance and reflected\r\nthem. Alma got up and took a pose before the mirror, which she then\r\ntransferred to her sketch. The room was pinned about with other sketches,\r\nwhich showed with fantastic indistinctness in the shaded gaslight. Alma\r\nheld up the drawing. "How do you like it?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton bent forward over her sewing to look at it. "You\'ve got the\r\nman\'s face rather weak."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s so. Either I see all the hidden weakness that\'s in men\'s\r\nnatures, and bring it to the surface in their figures, or else I put my\r\nown weakness into them. Either way, it\'s a drawback to their presenting a\r\ntruly manly appearance. As long as I have one of the miserable objects\r\nbefore me, I can draw him; but as soon as his back\'s turned I get to\r\nputting ladies into men\'s clothes. I should think you\'d be scandalized,\r\nmamma, if you were a really feminine person. It must be your despair that\r\nhelps you to bear up. But what\'s the matter with the young lady in young\r\nlady\'s clothes? Any dust on her?"\r\n\r\n"What expressions!" said Mrs. Leighton. "Really, Alma, for a refined girl\r\nyou are the most unrefined!"\r\n\r\n"Go on--about the girl in the picture!" said Alma, slightly knocking her\r\nmother on the shoulder, as she stood over her.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything to her. What\'s she doing?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, just being made love to, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"She\'s perfectly insipid!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re awfully articulate, mamma! Now, if Mr. Wetmore were to criticise\r\nthat picture he\'d draw a circle round it in the air, and look at it\r\nthrough that, and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other,\r\nand then look at you, as if you were a figure in it, and then collapse\r\nawhile, and moan a little and gasp, \'Isn\'t your young lady a little\r\ntoo-too--\' and then he\'d try to get the word out of you, and groan and\r\nsuffer some more; and you\'d say, \'She is, rather,\' and that would give\r\nhim courage, and he\'d say, \'I don\'t mean that she\'s so very--\' \'Of course\r\nnot.\' \'You understand?\' \'Perfectly. I see it myself, now.\' \'Well,\r\nthen\'---and he\'d take your pencil and begin to draw--\'I should give her a\r\nlittle more--Ah?\' \'Yes, I see the difference.\'--\'You see the difference?\'\r\nAnd he\'d go off to some one else, and you\'d know that you\'d been doing\r\nthe wishy-washiest thing in the world, though he hadn\'t spoken a word of\r\ncriticism, and couldn\'t. But he wouldn\'t have noticed the expression at\r\nall; he\'d have shown you where your drawing was bad. He doesn\'t care for\r\nwhat he calls the literature of a thing; he says that will take care of\r\nitself if the drawing\'s good. He doesn\'t like my doing these chic things;\r\nbut I\'m going to keep it up, for I think it\'s the nearest way to\r\nillustrating."\r\n\r\nShe took her sketch and pinned it up on the door.\r\n\r\n"And has Mr. Beaton been about, yet?" asked her mother.\r\n\r\n"No," said the girl, with her back still turned; and she added, "I\r\nbelieve he\'s in New York; Mr. Wetmore\'s seen him."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a little strange he doesn\'t call."\r\n\r\n"It would be if he were not an artist. But artists never do anything like\r\nother people. He was on his good behavior while he was with us, and he\'s\r\na great deal more conventional than most of them; but even he can\'t keep\r\nit up. That\'s what makes me really think that women can never amount to\r\nanything in art. They keep all their appointments, and fulfil all their\r\nduties just as if they didn\'t know anything about art. Well, most of them\r\ndon\'t. We\'ve got that new model to-day."\r\n\r\n"What new model?"\r\n\r\n"The one Mr. Wetmore was telling us about--the old German; he\'s splendid.\r\nHe\'s got the most beautiful head; just like the old masters\' things. He\r\nused to be Humphrey Williams\'s model for his Biblical-pieces; but since\r\nhe\'s dead, the old man hardly gets anything to do. Mr. Wetmore says there\r\nisn\'t anybody in the Bible that Williams didn\'t paint him as. He\'s the\r\nLaw and the Prophets in all his Old Testament pictures, and he\'s Joseph,\r\nPeter, Judas Iscariot, and the Scribes and Pharisees in the New."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good thing people don\'t know how artists work, or some of the\r\nmost sacred pictures would have no influence," said Mrs. Leighton.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not!" cried the girl. "And the influence is the last\r\nthing a painter thinks of--or supposes he thinks of. What he knows he\'s\r\nanxious about is the drawing and the color. But people will never\r\nunderstand how simple artists are. When I reflect what a complex and\r\nsophisticated being I am, I\'m afraid I can never come to anything in art.\r\nOr I should be if I hadn\'t genius."\r\n\r\n"Do you think Mr. Beaton is very simple?" asked Mrs. Leighton.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Wetmore doesn\'t think he\'s very much of an artist. He thinks he\r\ntalks too well. They believe that if a man can express himself clearly he\r\ncan\'t paint."\r\n\r\n"And what do you believe?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can express myself, too."\r\n\r\nThe mother seemed to be satisfied with this evasion. After a while she\r\nsaid, "I presume he will call when he gets settled."\r\n\r\nThe girl made no answer to this. "One of the girls says that old model is\r\nan educated man. He was in the war, and lost a hand. Doesn\'t it seem a\r\npity for such a man to have to sit to a class of affected geese like us\r\nas a model? I declare it makes me sick. And we shall keep him a week, and\r\npay him six or seven dollars for the use of his grand old head, and then\r\nwhat will he do? The last time he was regularly employed was when Mr.\r\nMace was working at his Damascus Massacre. Then he wanted so many Arab\r\nsheiks and Christian elders that he kept old Mr. Lindau steadily employed\r\nfor six months. Now he has to pick up odd jobs where he can."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he has his pension," said Mrs. Leighton.\r\n\r\n"No; one of the girls"--that was the way Alma always described her\r\nfellow-students--"says he has no pension. He didn\'t apply for it for a\r\nlong time, and then there was a hitch about it, and it was\r\nsomethinged--vetoed, I believe she said."\r\n\r\n"Who vetoed it?" asked Mrs. Leighton, with some curiosity about the\r\nprocess, which she held in reserve.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--whoever vetoes things. I wonder what Mr. Wetmore does think\r\nof us--his class. We must seem perfectly crazy. There isn\'t one of us\r\nreally knows what she\'s doing it for, or what she expects to happen when\r\nshe\'s done it. I suppose every one thinks she has genius. I know the\r\nNebraska widow does, for she says that unless you have genius it isn\'t\r\nthe least use. Everybody\'s puzzled to know what she does with her baby\r\nwhen she\'s at work--whether she gives it soothing syrup. I wonder how Mr.\r\nWetmore can keep from laughing in our faces. I know he does behind our\r\nbacks."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton\'s mind wandered back to another point. "Then if he says Mr.\r\nBeaton can\'t paint, I presume he doesn\'t respect him very much."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he never said he couldn\'t paint. But I know he thinks so. He says\r\nhe\'s an excellent critic."\r\n\r\n"Alma," her mother said, with the effect of breaking off, "what do you\r\nsuppose is the reason he hasn\'t been near us?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know, mamma, except that it would have been natural for\r\nanother person to come, and he\'s an artist at least, artist enough for\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"That doesn\'t account for it altogether. He was very nice at St. Barnaby,\r\nand seemed so interested in you--your work."\r\n\r\n"Plenty of people were nice at St. Barnaby. That rich Mrs. Horn couldn\'t\r\ncontain her joy when she heard we were coming to New York, but she hasn\'t\r\npoured in upon us a great deal since we got here."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s different. She\'s very fashionable, and she\'s taken up with\r\nher own set. But Mr. Beaton\'s one of our kind."\r\n\r\n"Thank you. Papa wasn\'t quite a tombstone-cutter, mamma."\r\n\r\n"That makes it all the harder to bear. He can\'t be ashamed of us. Perhaps\r\nhe doesn\'t know where we are."\r\n\r\n"Do you wish to send him your card, mamma?" The girl flushed and towered\r\nin scorn of the idea.\r\n\r\n"Why, no, Alma," returned her mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Alma.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Leighton was not so easily quelled. She had got her mind on Mr.\r\nBeaton, and she could not detach it at once. Besides, she was one of\r\nthose women (they are commoner than the same sort of men) whom it does\r\nnot pain to take out their most intimate thoughts and examine them in the\r\nlight of other people\'s opinions. "But I don\'t see how he can behave so.\r\nHe must know that--"\r\n\r\n"That what, mamma?" demanded the girl.\r\n\r\n"That he influenced us a great deal in coming--"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t. If he dared to presume to think such a thing--"\r\n\r\n"Now, Alma," said her mother, with the clinging persistence of such\r\nnatures, "you know he did. And it\'s no use for you to pretend that we\r\ndidn\'t count upon him in--in every way. You may not have noticed his\r\nattentions, and I don\'t say you did, but others certainly did; and I must\r\nsay that I didn\'t expect he would drop us so."\r\n\r\n"Drop us!" cried Alma, in a fury. "Oh!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, drop us, Alma. He must know where we are. Of course, Mr. Wetmore\'s\r\nspoken to him about you, and it\'s a shame that he hasn\'t been near us. I\r\nshould have thought common gratitude, common decency, would have brought\r\nhim after--after all we did for him."\r\n\r\n"We did nothing for him--nothing! He paid his board, and that ended it."\r\n\r\n"No, it didn\'t, Alma. You know what he used to say--about its being like\r\nhome, and all that; and I must say that after his attentions to you, and\r\nall the things you told me he said, I expected something very dif--"\r\n\r\nA sharp peal of the door-bell thrilled through the house, and as if the\r\npull of the bell-wire had twitched her to her feet, Mrs. Leighton sprang\r\nup and grappled with her daughter in their common terror.\r\n\r\nThey both glared at the clock and made sure that it was five minutes\r\nafter nine. Then they abandoned themselves some moments to the\r\nunrestricted play of their apprehensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n"Why, Alma," whispered the mother, "who in the world can it be at this\r\ntime of night? You don\'t suppose he--"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not going to the door, anyhow, mother, I don\'t care who it is;\r\nand, of course, he wouldn\'t be such a goose as to come at this hour." She\r\nput on a look of miserable trepidation, and shrank back from the door,\r\nwhile the hum of the bell died away, in the hall.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do?" asked Mrs. Leighton, helplessly.\r\n\r\n"Let him go away--whoever they are," said Alma.\r\n\r\nAnother and more peremptory ring forbade them refuge in this simple\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! what shall we do? Perhaps it\'s a despatch."\r\n\r\nThe conjecture moved Alma to no more than a rigid stare. "I shall not\r\ngo," she said. A third ring more insistent than the others followed, and\r\nshe said: "You go ahead, mamma, and I\'ll come behind to scream if it\'s\r\nanybody. We can look through the side-lights at the door first."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton fearfully led the way from the back chamber where they had\r\nbeen sitting, and slowly descended the stairs. Alma came behind and\r\nturned up the hall gas-jet with a sudden flash that made them both jump a\r\nlittle. The gas inside rendered it more difficult to tell who was on the\r\nthreshold, but Mrs. Leighton decided from a timorous peep through the\r\nscrims that it was a lady and gentleman. Something in this distribution\r\nof sex emboldened her; she took her life in her hand, and opened the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe lady spoke. "Does Mrs. Leighton live heah?" she said, in a rich,\r\nthroaty voice; and she feigned a reference to the agent\'s permit she held\r\nin her hand.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. Leighton; she mechanically occupied the doorway, while\r\nAlma already quivered behind her with impatience of her impoliteness.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the lady, who began to appear more and more a young lady, "Ah\r\ndidn\'t know but Ah had mistaken the hoase. Ah suppose it\'s rather late to\r\nsee the apawtments, and Ah most ask you to pawdon us." She put this\r\ntentatively, with a delicately growing recognition of Mrs. Leighton as\r\nthe lady of the house, and a humorous intelligence of the situation in\r\nthe glance she threw Alma over her mother\'s shoulder. "Ah\'m afraid we\r\nmost have frightened you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all," said Alma; and at the same time her mother said, "Will\r\nyou walk in, please?"\r\n\r\nThe gentleman promptly removed his hat and made the Leightons an\r\ninclusive bow. "You awe very kind, madam, and I am sorry for the trouble\r\nwe awe giving you." He was tall and severe-looking, with a gray,\r\ntrooperish mustache and iron-gray hair, and, as Alma decided, iron-gray\r\neyes. His daughter was short, plump, and fresh-colored, with an effect of\r\nliveliness that did not all express itself in her broad-vowelled, rather\r\nformal speech, with its odd valuations of some of the auxiliary verbs,\r\nand its total elision of the canine letter.\r\n\r\n"We awe from the Soath," she said, "and we arrived this mawning, but we\r\ngot this cyahd from the brokah just befo\' dinnah, and so we awe rathah\r\nlate."\r\n\r\n"Not at all; it\'s only nine o\'clock," said Mrs. Leighton. She looked up\r\nfrom the card the young lady had given her, and explained, "We haven\'t\r\ngot in our servants yet, and we had to answer the bell ourselves, and--"\r\n\r\n"You were frightened, of coase," said the young lady, caressingly.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman said they ought not to have come so late, and he offered\r\nsome formal apologies.\r\n\r\n"We should have been just as much scared any time after five o\'clock,"\r\nAlma said to the sympathetic intelligence in the girl\'s face.\r\n\r\nShe laughed out. "Of coase! Ah would have my hawt in my moath all day\r\nlong, too, if Ah was living in a big hoase alone."\r\n\r\nA moment of stiffness followed; Mrs. Leighton would have liked to\r\nwithdraw from the intimacy of the situation, but she did not know how. It\r\nwas very well for these people to assume to be what they pretended; but,\r\nshe reflected too late, she had no proof of it except the agent\'s permit.\r\nThey were all standing in the hall together, and she prolonged the\r\nawkward pause while she examined the permit. "You are Mr. Woodburn?" she\r\nasked, in a way that Alma felt implied he might not be.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam; from Charlottesboag, Virginia," he answered, with the slight\r\numbrage a man shows when the strange cashier turns his check over and\r\nquestions him before cashing it.\r\n\r\nAlma writhed internally, but outwardly remained subordinate; she examined\r\nthe other girl\'s dress, and decided in a superficial consciousness that\r\nshe had made her own bonnet.\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad to show you my rooms," said Mrs. Leighton, with an\r\nirrelevant sigh. "You must excuse their being not just as I should wish\r\nthem. We\'re hardly settled yet."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak of it, madam," said the gentleman, "if you can overlook the\r\ntrouble we awe giving you at such an unseasonable houah."\r\n\r\n"Ah\'m a hoasekeepah mahself," Miss Woodburn joined in, "and Ah know ho\'\r\nto accyoant fo\' everything."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton led the way up-stairs, and the young lady decided upon the\r\nlarge front room and small side room on the third story. She said she\r\ncould take the small one, and the other was so large that her father\r\ncould both sleep and work in it. She seemed not ashamed to ask if Mrs.\r\nLeighton\'s price was inflexible, but gave way laughing when her father\r\nrefused to have any bargaining, with a haughty self-respect which he\r\nsoftened to deference for Mrs. Leighton. His impulsiveness opened the way\r\nfor some confidence from her, and before the affair was arranged she was\r\nenjoying in her quality of clerical widow the balm of the Virginians\'\r\nreverent sympathy. They said they were church people themselves.\r\n\r\n"Ah don\'t know what yo\' mothah means by yo\' hoase not being in oddah,"\r\nthe young lady said to Alma as they went down-stairs together. "Ah\'m a\r\ngreat hoasekeepah mahself, and Ah mean what Ah say."\r\n\r\nThey had all turned mechanically into the room where the Leightons were\r\nsitting when the Woodburns rang: Mr. Woodburn consented to sit down, and\r\nhe remained listening to Mrs. Leighton while his daughter bustled up to\r\nthe sketches pinned round the room and questioned Alma about them.\r\n\r\n"Ah suppose you awe going to be a great awtust?" she said, in friendly\r\nbanter, when Alma owned to having done the things. "Ah\'ve a great notion\r\nto take a few lessons mahself. Who\'s yo\' teachah?"\r\n\r\nAlma said she was drawing in Mr. Wetmore\'s class, and Miss Woodburn said:\r\n"Well, it\'s just beautiful, Miss Leighton; it\'s grand. Ah suppose it\'s\r\nraght expensive, now? Mah goodness! we have to cyoant the coast so much\r\nnowadays; it seems to me we do nothing but cyoant it. Ah\'d like to hah\r\nsomething once without askin\' the price."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you didn\'t ask it," said Alma, "I don\'t believe Mr. Wetmore\r\nwould ever know what the price of his lessons was. He has to think, when\r\nyou ask him."\r\n\r\n"Why, he most be chomming," said Miss Woodburn. "Perhaps Ah maght get the\r\nlessons for nothing from him. Well, Ah believe in my soul Ah\'ll trah. Now\r\nho\' did you begin? and ho\' do you expect to get anything oat of it?" She\r\nturned on Alma eyes brimming with a shrewd mixture of fun and earnest,\r\nand Alma made note of the fact that she had an early nineteenth-century\r\nface, round, arch, a little coquettish, but extremely sensible and\r\nunspoiled-looking, such as used to be painted a good deal in miniature at\r\nthat period; a tendency of her brown hair to twine and twist at the\r\ntemples helped the effect; a high comb would have completed it, Alma\r\nfelt, if she had her bonnet off. It was almost a Yankee country-girl\r\ntype; but perhaps it appeared so to Alma because it was, like that, pure\r\nAnglo-Saxon. Alma herself, with her dull, dark skin, slender in figure,\r\nslow in speech, with aristocratic forms in her long hands, and the oval\r\nof her fine face pointed to a long chin, felt herself much more Southern\r\nin style than this blooming, bubbling, bustling Virginian.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," she answered, slowly.\r\n\r\n"Going to take po\'traits," suggested Miss Woodburn, "or just paint the\r\nahdeal?" A demure burlesque lurked in her tone.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I don\'t expect to paint at all," said Alma. "I\'m going to\r\nillustrate books--if anybody will let me."\r\n\r\n"Ah should think they\'d just joamp at you," said Miss Woodburn. "Ah\'ll\r\ntell you what let\'s do, Miss Leighton: you make some pictures, and Ah\'ll\r\nwrahte a book fo\' them. Ah\'ve got to do something. Ali maght as well\r\nwrahte a book. You know we Southerners have all had to go to woak. But Ah\r\ndon\'t mand it. I tell papa I shouldn\'t ca\' fo\' the disgrace of bein\' poo\'\r\nif it wasn\'t fo\' the inconvenience."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s inconvenient," said Alma; "but you forget it when you\'re at\r\nwork, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"Mah, yes! Perhaps that\'s one reason why poo\' people have to woak so\r\nhawd--to keep their mands off their poverty."\r\n\r\nThe girls both tittered, and turned from talking in a low tone with their\r\nbacks toward their elders, and faced them.\r\n\r\n"Well, Madison," said Mr. Woodburn, "it is time we should go. I bid you\r\ngood-night, madam," he bowed to Mrs. Leighton. "Good-night," he bowed\r\nagain to Alma.\r\n\r\nHis daughter took leave of them in formal phrase, but with a jolly\r\ncordiality of manner that deformalized it. "We shall be roand raght soon\r\nin the mawning, then," she threatened at the door.\r\n\r\n"We shall be all ready for you," Alma called after her down the steps.\r\n\r\n"Well, Alma?" her mother asked, when the door closed upon them.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t know any more about art," said Alma, "than--nothing at all.\r\nBut she\'s jolly and good-hearted. She praised everything that was bad in\r\nmy sketches, and said she was going to take lessons herself. When a\r\nperson talks about taking lessons, as if they could learn it, you know\r\nwhere they belong artistically."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton shook her head with a sigh. "I wish I knew where they\r\nbelonged financially. We shall have to get in two girls at once. I shall\r\nhave to go out the first thing in the morning, and then our troubles will\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\n"Well, didn\'t you want them to begin? I will stay home and help you get\r\nready. Our prosperity couldn\'t begin without the troubles, if you mean\r\nboarders, and boarders mean servants. I shall be very glad to be\r\nafflicted with a cook for a while myself."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but we don\'t know anything about these people, or whether they will\r\nbe able to pay us. Did she talk as if they were well off?"\r\n\r\n"She talked as if they were poor; poo\' she called it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, how queerly she pronounced," said Mrs. Leighton. "Well, I ought to\r\nhave told them that I required the first week in advance."\r\n\r\n"Mamma! If that\'s the way you\'re going to act!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, I couldn\'t, after he wouldn\'t let her bargain for the\r\nrooms. I didn\'t like that."\r\n\r\n"I did. And you can see that they were perfect ladies; or at least one of\r\nthem." Alma laughed at herself, but her mother did not notice.\r\n\r\n"Their being ladies won\'t help if they\'ve got no money. It\'ll make it\r\nall the worse."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then; we have no money, either. We\'re a match for them any\r\nday there. We can show them that two can play at that game."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nArnus Beaton\'s studio looked at first glance like many other painters\'\r\nstudios. A gray wall quadrangularly vaulted to a large north light; casts\r\nof feet, hands, faces hung to nails about; prints, sketches in oil and\r\nwater-color stuck here and there lower down; a rickety table, with paint\r\nand palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossed comfortlessly on\r\nit; an easel, with a strip of some faded mediaeval silk trailing from it;\r\na lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness, with its head on one\r\nside, and a stocking on one leg, and a Japanese dress dropped before it;\r\ndusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnished floor; canvases faced to\r\nthe mop-board; an open trunk overflowing with costumes: these features\r\none might notice anywhere. But, besides, there was a bookcase with an\r\nunusual number of books in it, and there was an open colonial\r\nwriting-desk, claw-footed, brass-handled, and scutcheoned, with foreign\r\nperiodicals--French and English--littering its leaf, and some pages of\r\nmanuscript scattered among them. Above all, there was a sculptor\'s\r\nrevolving stand, supporting a bust which Beaton was modelling, with an\r\neye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clay and on the head of\r\nthe old man who sat on the platform beside it.\r\n\r\nFew men have been able to get through the world with several gifts to\r\nadvantage in all; and most men seem handicapped for the race if they have\r\nmore than one. But they are apparently immensely interested as well as\r\ndistracted by them. When Beaton was writing, he would have agreed, up to\r\na certain point, with any one who said literature was his proper\r\nexpression; but, then, when he was painting, up to a certain point, he\r\nwould have maintained against the world that he was a colorist, and\r\nsupremely a colorist. At the certain point in either art he was apt to\r\nbreak away in a frenzy of disgust and wreak himself upon some other. In\r\nthese moods he sometimes designed elevations of buildings, very striking,\r\nvery original, very chic, very everything but habitable. It was in this\r\nway that he had tried his hand on sculpture, which he had at first\r\napproached rather slightingly as a mere decorative accessory of\r\narchitecture. But it had grown in his respect till he maintained that the\r\naccessory business ought to be all the other way: that temples should be\r\nraised to enshrine statues, not statues made to ornament temples; that\r\nwas putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance. This was when he\r\nhad carried a plastic study so far that the sculptors who saw it said\r\nthat Beaton might have been an architect, but would certainly never be a\r\nsculptor. At the same time he did some hurried, nervous things that had a\r\npopular charm, and that sold in plaster reproductions, to the profit of\r\nanother. Beaton justly despised the popular charm in these, as well as in\r\nthe paintings he sold from time to time; he said it was flat burglary to\r\nhave taken money for them, and he would have been living almost wholly\r\nupon the bounty of the old tombstone-cutter in Syracuse if it had not\r\nbeen for the syndicate letters which he supplied to Fulkerson for ten\r\ndollars a week.\r\n\r\nThey were very well done, but he hated doing them after the first two or\r\nthree, and had to be punched up for them by Fulkerson, who did not cease\r\nto prize them, and who never failed to punch him up. Beaton being what he\r\nwas, Fulkerson was his creditor as well as patron; and Fulkerson being\r\nwhat he was, had an enthusiastic patience with the elusive, facile,\r\nadaptable, unpractical nature of Beaton. He was very proud of his\r\nart-letters, as he called them; but then Fulkerson was proud of\r\neverything he secured for his syndicate. The fact that he had secured it\r\ngave it value; he felt as if he had written it himself.\r\n\r\nOne art trod upon another\'s heels with Beaton. The day before he had\r\nrushed upon canvas the conception of a picture which he said to himself\r\nwas glorious, and to others (at the table d\'hote of Maroni) was not bad.\r\nHe had worked at it in a fury till the light failed him, and he execrated\r\nthe dying day. But he lit his lamp and transferred the process of his\r\nthinking from the canvas to the opening of the syndicate letter which he\r\nknew Fulkerson would be coming for in the morning. He remained talking so\r\nlong after dinner in the same strain as he had painted and written in\r\nthat he could not finish his letter that night. The next morning, while\r\nhe was making his tea for breakfast, the postman brought him a letter\r\nfrom his father enclosing a little check, and begging him with tender,\r\nalmost deferential, urgence to come as lightly upon him as possible, for\r\njust now his expenses were very heavy. It brought tears of shame into\r\nBeaton\'s eyes--the fine, smouldering, floating eyes that many ladies\r\nadmired, under the thick bang--and he said to himself that if he were\r\nhalf a man he would go home and go to work cutting gravestones in his\r\nfather\'s shop. But he would wait, at least, to finish his picture; and as\r\na sop to his conscience, to stay its immediate ravening, he resolved to\r\nfinish that syndicate letter first, and borrow enough money from\r\nFulkerson to be able to send his father\'s check back; or, if not that,\r\nthen to return the sum of it partly in Fulkerson\'s check. While he still\r\nteemed with both of these good intentions the old man from whom he was\r\nmodelling his head of Judas came, and Beaton saw that he must get through\r\nwith him before he finished either the picture or the letter; he would\r\nhave to pay him for the time, anyway. He utilized the remorse with which\r\nhe was tingling to give his Judas an expression which he found novel in\r\nthe treatment of that character--a look of such touching, appealing\r\nself-abhorrence that Beaton\'s artistic joy in it amounted to rapture;\r\nbetween the breathless moments when he worked in dead silence for an\r\neffect that was trying to escape him, he sang and whistled fragments of\r\ncomic opera.\r\n\r\nIn one of the hushes there came a blow on the outside of the door that\r\nmade Beaton jump, and swear with a modified profanity that merged itself\r\nin apostrophic prayer. He knew it must be Fulkerson, and after roaring\r\n"Come in!" he said to the model, "That\'ll do this morning, Lindau."\r\n\r\nFulkerson squared his feet in front of the bust and compared it by\r\nfleeting glances with the old man as he got stiffly up and suffered\r\nBeaton to help him on with his thin, shabby overcoat.\r\n\r\n"Can you come to-morrow, Lindau?"\r\n\r\n"No, not to-morrow, Mr. Peaton. I haf to zit for the young ladties."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Beaton. "Wetmore\'s class? Is Miss Leighton doing you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know their namess," Lindau began, when Fulkerson said:\r\n\r\n"Hope you haven\'t forgotten mine, Mr. Lindau? I met you with Mr. March at\r\nMaroni\'s one night." Fulkerson offered him a universally shakable hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes! I am gladt to zee you again, Mr. Vulkerson. And Mr. Marge--he\r\ndon\'t zeem to gome any more?"\r\n\r\n"Up to his eyes in work. Been moving on from Boston and getting settled,\r\nand starting in on our enterprise. Beaton here hasn\'t got a very\r\nflattering likeness of you, hey? Well, good-morning," he said, for Lindau\r\nappeared not to have heard him and was escaping with a bow through the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBeaton lit a cigarette which he pinched nervously between his lips before\r\nhe spoke. "You\'ve come for that letter, I suppose, Fulkerson? It isn\'t\r\ndone."\r\n\r\nFulkerson turned from staring at the bust to which he had mounted. "What\r\nyou fretting about that letter for? I don\'t want your letter."\r\n\r\nBeaton stopped biting his cigarette and looked at him. "Don\'t want my\r\nletter? Oh, very good!" he bristled up. He took his cigarette from his\r\nlips, and blew the smoke through his nostrils, and then looked at\r\nFulkerson.\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t want your letter; I want you."\r\n\r\nBeacon disdained to ask an explanation, but he internally lowered his\r\ncrest, while he continued to look at Fulkerson without changing his\r\ndefiant countenance. This suited Fulkerson well enough, and he went on\r\nwith relish, "I\'m going out of the syndicate business, old man, and I\'m\r\non a new thing." He put his leg over the back of a chair and rested his\r\nfoot on its seat, and, with one hand in his pocket, he laid the scheme of\r\n\'Every Other Week\' before Beaton with the help of the other. The artist\r\nwent about the room, meanwhile, with an effect of indifference which by\r\nno means offended Fulkerson. He took some water into his mouth from a\r\ntumbler, which he blew in a fine mist over the head of Judas before\r\nswathing it in a dirty cotton cloth; he washed his brushes and set his\r\npalette; he put up on his easel the picture he had blocked on the day\r\nbefore, and stared at it with a gloomy face; then he gathered the sheets\r\nof his unfinished letter together and slid them into a drawer of his\r\nwriting-desk. By the time he had finished and turned again to Fulkerson,\r\nFulkerson was saying: "I did think we could have the first number out by\r\nNew-Year\'s; but it will take longer than that--a month longer; but I\'m\r\nnot sorry, for the holidays kill everything; and by February, or the\r\nmiddle of February, people will get their breath again and begin to look\r\nround and ask what\'s new. Then we\'ll reply in the language of Shakespeare\r\nand Milton, \'Every Other Week; and don\'t you forget it.\'" He took down\r\nhis leg and asked, "Got a pipe of \'baccy anywhere?"\r\n\r\nBeaton nodded at a clay stem sticking out of a Japanese vase of bronze on\r\nhis mantel. "There\'s yours," he said; and Fulkerson said, "Thanks," and\r\nfilled the pipe and sat down and began to smoke tranquilly.\r\n\r\nBeaton saw that he would have to speak now. "And what do you want with\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"You? Oh yes," Fulkerson humorously dramatized a return to himself from a\r\npensive absence. "Want you for the art department."\r\n\r\nBeaton shook his head. "I\'m not your man, Fulkerson," he said,\r\ncompassionately. "You want a more practical hand, one that\'s in touch\r\nwith what\'s going. I\'m getting further and further away from this century\r\nand its claptrap. I don\'t believe in your enterprise; I don\'t respect it,\r\nand I won\'t have anything to do with it. It would--choke me, that kind of\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Fulkerson. He esteemed a man who was not going\r\nto let himself go cheap. "Or if it isn\'t, we can make it. You and March\r\nwill pull together first-rate. I don\'t care how much ideal you put into\r\nthe thing; the more the better. I can look after the other end of the\r\nschooner myself."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand me," said Beaton. "I\'m not trying to get a rise out\r\nof you. I\'m in earnest. What you want is some man who can have patience\r\nwith mediocrity putting on the style of genius, and with genius turning\r\nmediocrity on his hands. I haven\'t any luck with men; I don\'t get on with\r\nthem; I\'m not popular." Beaton recognized the fact with the satisfaction\r\nwhich it somehow always brings to human pride.\r\n\r\n"So much the better!" Fulkerson was ready for him at this point. "I don\'t\r\nwant you to work the old-established racket the reputations. When I want\r\nthem I\'ll go to them with a pocketful of rocks--knock-down argument. But\r\nmy idea is to deal with the volunteer material. Look at the way the\r\nperiodicals are carried on now! Names! names! names! In a country that\'s\r\njust boiling over with literary and artistic ability of every kind the\r\nnew fellows have no chance. The editors all engage their material. I\r\ndon\'t believe there are fifty volunteer contributions printed in a year\r\nin all the New York magazines. It\'s all wrong; it\'s suicidal. \'Every\r\nOther Week\' is going back to the good old anonymous system, the only fair\r\nsystem. It\'s worked well in literature, and it will work well in art."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t work well in art," said Beaton. "There you have a totally\r\ndifferent set of conditions. What you\'ll get by inviting volunteer\r\nillustrations will be a lot of amateur trash. And how are you going to\r\nsubmit your literature for illustration? It can\'t be done. At any rate, I\r\nwon\'t undertake to do it."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get up a School of Illustration," said Fulkerson, with cynical\r\nsecurity. "You can read the things and explain \'em, and your pupils can\r\nmake their sketches under your eye. They wouldn\'t be much further out\r\nthan most illustrations are if they never knew what they were\r\nillustrating. You might select from what comes in and make up a sort of\r\npictorial variations to the literature without any particular reference\r\nto it. Well, I understand you to accept?"\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"That is, to consent to help us with your advice and criticism. That\'s\r\nall I want. It won\'t commit you to anything; and you can be as anonymous\r\nas anybody." At the door Fulkerson added: "By-the-way, the new man--the\r\nfellow that\'s taken my old syndicate business--will want you to keep on;\r\nbut I guess he\'s going to try to beat you down on the price of the\r\nletters. He\'s going in for retrenchment. I brought along a check for this\r\none; I\'m to pay for that." He offered Beaton an envelope.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t take it, Fulkerson. The letter\'s paid for already." Fulkerson\r\nstepped forward and laid the envelope on the table among the tubes of\r\npaint.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the letter merely. I thought you wouldn\'t object to a little\r\nadvance on your \'Every Other Week\' work till you kind of got started."\r\n\r\nBeaton remained inflexible. "It can\'t be done, Fulkerson. Don\'t I tell\r\nyou I can\'t sell myself out to a thing I don\'t believe in? Can\'t you\r\nunderstand that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; I can understand that first-rate. I don\'t want to buy you; I\r\nwant to borrow you. It\'s all right. See? Come round when you can; I\'d\r\nlike to introduce you to old March. That\'s going to be our address." He\r\nput a card on the table beside the envelope, and Beaton allowed him to go\r\nwithout making him take the check back. He had remembered his father\'s\r\nplea; that unnerved him, and he promised himself again to return his\r\nfather\'s poor little check and to work on that picture and give it to\r\nFulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts. He resolved\r\nto go to work on the picture at once; he had set his palette for it; but\r\nfirst he looked at Fulkerson\'s check. It was for only fifty dollars, and\r\nthe canny Scotch blood in Beaton rebelled; he could not let this picture\r\ngo for any such money; he felt a little like a man whose generosity has\r\nbeen trifled with. The conflict of emotions broke him up, and he could\r\nnot work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe day wasted away in Beaton\'s hands; at half-past four o\'clock he went\r\nout to tea at the house of a lady who was At Home that afternoon from\r\nfour till seven. By this time Beaton was in possession of one of those\r\nother selves of which we each have several about us, and was again the\r\nlaconic, staccato, rather worldlified young artist whose moments of a\r\ncontrolled utterance and a certain distinction of manner had commended\r\nhim to Mrs. Horn\'s fancy in the summer at St. Barnaby.\r\n\r\nMrs. Horn\'s rooms were large, and they never seemed very full, though\r\nthis perhaps was because people were always so quiet. The ladies, who\r\noutnumbered the men ten to one, as they always do at a New York tea, were\r\ndressed in sympathy with the low tone every one spoke in, and with the\r\nsubdued light which gave a crepuscular uncertainty to the few objects,\r\nthe dim pictures, the unexcited upholstery, of the rooms. One breathed\r\nfree of bric-a-brac there, and the new-comer breathed softly as one does\r\non going into church after service has begun. This might be a suggestion\r\nfrom the voiceless behavior of the man-servant who let you in, but it was\r\nalso because Mrs. Horn\'s At Home was a ceremony, a decorum, and not\r\nfestival. At far greater houses there was more gayety, at richer houses\r\nthere was more freedom; the suppression at Mrs. Horn\'s was a personal,\r\nnot a social, effect; it was an efflux of her character, demure,\r\nsilentious, vague, but very correct.\r\n\r\nBeaton easily found his way to her around the grouped skirts and among\r\nthe detached figures, and received a pressure of welcome from the hand\r\nwhich she momentarily relaxed from the tea-pot. She sat behind a table\r\nput crosswise of a remote corner, and offered tea to people whom a niece\r\nof hers received provisionally or sped finally in the outer room. They\r\ndid not usually take tea, and when they did they did not usually drink\r\nit; but Beaton was feverishly glad of his cup; he took rum and lemon in\r\nit, and stood talking at Mrs. Horn\'s side till the next arrival should\r\ndisplace him: he talked in his French manner.\r\n\r\n"I have been hoping to see you," she said. "I wanted to ask you about the\r\nLeightons. Did they really come?"\r\n\r\n"I believe so. They are in town--yes. I haven\'t seen them."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t know how they\'re getting on--that pretty creature, with\r\nher cleverness, and poor Mrs. Leighton? I was afraid they were venturing\r\non a rash experiment. Do you know where they are?"\r\n\r\n"In West Eleventh Street somewhere. Miss Leighton is in Mr. Wetmore\'s\r\nclass."\r\n\r\n"I must look them up. Do you know their number?"\r\n\r\n"Not at the moment. I can find out."\r\n\r\n"Do," said Mrs. Horn. "What courage they must have, to plunge into New\r\nYork as they\'ve done! I really didn\'t think they would. I wonder if\r\nthey\'ve succeeded in getting anybody into their house yet?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"I discouraged their coming all I could," she sighed, "and I suppose you\r\ndid, too. But it\'s quite useless trying to make people in a place like\r\nSt. Barnaby understand how it is in town."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beaton. He stirred his tea, while inwardly he tried to\r\nbelieve that he had really discouraged the Leightons from coming to New\r\nYork. Perhaps the vexation of his failure made him call Mrs. Horn in his\r\nheart a fraud.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she went on, "it is very, very hard. And when they won\'t\r\nunderstand, and rush on their doom, you feel that they are going to hold\r\nyou respons--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Horn\'s eyes wandered from Beaton; her voice faltered in the faded\r\ninterest of her remark, and then rose with renewed vigor in greeting a\r\nlady who came up and stretched her glove across the tea-cups.\r\n\r\nBeaton got himself away and out of the house with a much briefer adieu to\r\nthe niece than he had meant to make. The patronizing compassion of Mrs.\r\nHorn for the Leightons filled him with indignation toward her, toward\r\nhimself. There was no reason why he should not have ignored them as he\r\nhad done; but there was a feeling. It was his nature to be careless, and\r\nhe had been spoiled into recklessness; he neglected everybody, and only\r\nremembered them when it suited his whim or his convenience; but he\r\nfiercely resented the inattentions of others toward himself. He had no\r\nscruple about breaking an engagement or failing to keep an appointment;\r\nhe made promises without thinking of their fulfilment, and not because he\r\nwas a faithless person, but because he was imaginative, and expected at\r\nthe time to do what he said, but was fickle, and so did not. As most of\r\nhis shortcomings were of a society sort, no great harm was done to\r\nanybody else. He had contracted somewhat the circle of his acquaintance\r\nby what some people called his rudeness, but most people treated it as\r\nhis oddity, and were patient with it. One lady said she valued his coming\r\nwhen he said he would come because it had the charm of the unexpected.\r\n"Only it shows that it isn\'t always the unexpected that happens," she\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to him that his behavior was immoral; he did not realize\r\nthat it was creating a reputation if not a character for him. While we\r\nare still young we do not realize that our actions have this effect. It\r\nseems to us that people will judge us from what we think and feel. Later\r\nwe find out that this is impossible; perhaps we find it out too late;\r\nsome of us never find it out at all.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his shame about the Leightons, Beaton had no present\r\nintention of looking them up or sending Mrs. Horn their address. As a\r\nmatter of fact, he never did send it; but he happened to meet Mr. Wetmore\r\nand his wife at the restaurant where he dined, and he got it of the\r\npainter for himself. He did not ask him how Miss Leighton was getting on;\r\nbut Wetmore launched out, with Alma for a tacit text, on the futility of\r\nwomen generally going in for art. "Even when they have talent they\'ve got\r\ntoo much against them. Where a girl doesn\'t seem very strong, like Miss\r\nLeighton, no amount of chic is going to help."\r\n\r\nHis wife disputed him on behalf of her sex, as women always do.\r\n\r\n"No, Dolly," he persisted; "she\'d better be home milking the cows and\r\nleading the horse to water."\r\n\r\n"Do you think she\'d better be up till two in the morning at balls and\r\ngoing all day to receptions and luncheons?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, guess it isn\'t a question of that, even if she weren\'t drawing. You\r\nknew them at home," he said to Beaton.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I remember. Her mother said you suggested me. Well, the girl has some\r\nnotion of it; there\'s no doubt about that. But--she\'s a woman. The\r\ntrouble with these talented girls is that they\'re all woman. If they\r\nweren\'t, there wouldn\'t be much chance for the men, Beaton. But we\'ve got\r\nProvidence on our own side from the start. I\'m able to watch all their\r\ninspirations with perfect composure. I know just how soon it\'s going to\r\nend in nervous breakdown. Somebody ought to marry them all and put them\r\nout of their misery."\r\n\r\n"And what will you do with your students who are married already?" his\r\nwife said. She felt that she had let him go on long enough.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they ought to get divorced."\r\n\r\n"You ought to be ashamed to take their money if that\'s what you think of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"My dear, I have a wife to support."\r\n\r\nBeaton intervened with a question. "Do you mean that Miss Leighton isn\'t\r\nstanding it very well?"\r\n\r\n"How do I know? She isn\'t the kind that bends; she\'s the kind that\r\nbreaks."\r\n\r\nAfter a little silence Mrs. Wetmore asked, "Won\'t you come home with us,\r\nMr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\n"Thank you; no. I have an engagement."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why that should prevent you," said Wetmore. "But you always\r\nwere a punctilious cuss. Well!"\r\n\r\nBeaton lingered over his cigar; but no one else whom he knew came in, and\r\nhe yielded to the threefold impulse of conscience, of curiosity, of\r\ninclination, in going to call at the Leightons\'. He asked for the ladies,\r\nand the maid showed him into the parlor, where he found Mrs. Leighton and\r\nMiss Woodburn.\r\n\r\nThe widow met him with a welcome neatly marked by resentment; she meant\r\nhim to feel that his not coming sooner had been noticed. Miss Woodburn\r\nbubbled and gurgled on, and did what she could to mitigate his\r\npunishment, but she did not feel authorized to stay it, till Mrs.\r\nLeighton, by studied avoidance of her daughter\'s name, obliged Beaton to\r\nask for her. Then Miss Woodburn caught up her work, and said, "Ah\'ll go\r\nand tell her, Mrs. Leighton." At the top of the stairs she found Alma,\r\nand Alma tried to make it seem as if she had not been standing there.\r\n"Mah goodness, chald! there\'s the handsomest young man asking for you\r\ndown there you evah saw. Alh told you\' mothah Ah would come up fo\' you."\r\n\r\n"What--who is it?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know? But ho\' could you? He\'s got the most beautiful eyes,\r\nand he wea\'s his hai\' in a bang, and he talks English like it was\r\nsomething else, and his name\'s Mr. Beaton."\r\n\r\n"Did he--ask for me?" said Alma, with a dreamy tone. She put her hand on\r\nthe stairs rail, and a little shiver ran over her.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you? Of coase he did! And you ought to go raght down if\r\nyou want to save the poo\' fellah\'s lahfe; you\' mothah\'s just freezin\' him\r\nto death."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n"She is?" cried Alma. "Tchk!" She flew downstairs, and flitted swiftly\r\ninto the room, and fluttered up to Beaton, and gave him a crushing\r\nhand-shake.\r\n\r\n"How very kind of you to come and see us, Mr. Beaton! When did you come\r\nto New York? Don\'t you find it warm here? We\'ve only just lighted the\r\nfurnace, but with this mild weather it seems too early. Mamma does keep\r\nit so hot!" She rushed about opening doors and shutting registers, and\r\nthen came back and sat facing him from the sofa with a mask of radiant\r\ncordiality. "How have you been since we saw you?"\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Beaton. "I hope you\'re well, Miss Leighton?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, perfectly! I think New York agrees with us both wonderfully. I never\r\nknew such air. And to think of our not having snow yet! I should think\r\neverybody would want to come here! Why don\'t you come, Mr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\nBeaton lifted his eyes and looked at her. "I--I live in New York," he\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n"In New York City!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Surely, Alma," said her mother, "you remember Mr. Beaton\'s telling us he\r\nlived in New York."\r\n\r\n"But I thought you came from Rochester; or was it Syracuse? I always get\r\nthose places mixed up."\r\n\r\n"Probably I told you my father lived at Syracuse. I\'ve been in New York\r\never since I came home from Paris," said Beaton, with the confusion of a\r\nman who feels himself played upon by a woman.\r\n\r\n"From Paris!" Alma echoed, leaning forward, with her smiling mask tight\r\non. "Wasn\'t it Munich where you studied?"\r\n\r\n"I was at Munich, too. I met Wetmore there."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you know Mr. Wetmore?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Alma," her mother interposed again, "it was Mr. Beaton who told you\r\nof Mr. Wetmore."\r\n\r\n"Was it? Why, yes, to be sure. It was Mrs. Horn who suggested Mr. Ilcomb.\r\nI remember now. I can\'t thank you enough for having sent me to Mr.\r\nWetmore, Mr. Beaton. Isn\'t he delightful? Oh yes, I\'m a perfect\r\nWetmorian, I can assure you. The whole class is the same way."\r\n\r\n"I just met him and Mrs. Wetmore at dinner," said Beaton, attempting the\r\nrecovery of something that he had lost through the girl\'s shining ease\r\nand steely sprightliness. She seemed to him so smooth and hard, with a\r\nrepellent elasticity from which he was flung off. "I hope you\'re not\r\nworking too hard, Miss Leighton?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! I enjoy every minute of it, and grow stronger on it. Do I look\r\nvery much wasted away?" She looked him full in the face, brilliantly\r\nsmiling, and intentionally beautiful.\r\n\r\n"No," he said, with a slow sadness; "I never saw you looking better."\r\n\r\n"Poor Mr. Beaton!" she said, in recognition of his doleful tune. "It\r\nseems to be quite a blow."\r\n\r\n"Oh no--"\r\n\r\n"I remember all the good advice you used to give me about not working too\r\nhard, and probably it\'s that that\'s saved my life--that and the\r\nhouse-hunting. Has mamma told you of our adventures in getting settled?\r\n\r\n"Some time we must. It was such fun! And didn\'t you think we were\r\nfortunate to get such a pretty house? You must see both our parlors." She\r\njumped up, and her mother followed her with a bewildered look as she ran\r\ninto the back parlor and flashed up the gas.\r\n\r\n"Come in here, Mr. Beaton. I want to show you the great feature of the\r\nhouse." She opened the low windows that gave upon a glazed veranda\r\nstretching across the end of the room. "Just think of this in New York!\r\nYou can\'t see it very well at night, but when the southern sun pours in\r\nhere all the afternoon--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can imagine it," he said. He glanced up at the bird-cage hanging\r\nfrom the roof. "I suppose Gypsy enjoys it."\r\n\r\n"You remember Gypsy?" she said; and she made a cooing, kissing little\r\nnoise up at the bird, who responded drowsily. "Poor old Gypsum! Well, he\r\nsha\'n\'t be disturbed. Yes, it\'s Gyp\'s delight, and Colonel Woodburn likes\r\nto write here in the morning. Think of us having a real live author in\r\nthe house! And Miss Woodburn: I\'m so glad you\'ve seen her! They\'re\r\nSouthern people."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that was obvious in her case."\r\n\r\n"From her accent? Isn\'t it fascinating? I didn\'t believe I could ever\r\nendure Southerners, but we\'re like one family with the Woodburns. I\r\nshould think you\'d want to paint Miss Woodburn. Don\'t you think her\r\ncoloring is delicious? And such a quaint kind of eighteenth-century type\r\nof beauty! But she\'s perfectly lovely every way, and everything she says\r\nis so funny. The Southerners seem to be such great talkers; better than\r\nwe are, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Beaton, in pensive discouragement. He was sensible\r\nof being manipulated, operated, but he was helpless to escape from the\r\nperformer or to fathom her motives. His pensiveness passed into gloom,\r\nand was degenerating into sulky resentment when he went away, after\r\nseveral failures to get back to the old ground he had held in relation to\r\nAlma. He retrieved something of it with Mrs. Leighton; but Alma glittered\r\nupon him to the last with a keen impenetrable candor, a child-like\r\nsingleness of glance, covering unfathomable reserve.\r\n\r\n"Well, Alma," said her mother, when the door had closed upon him.\r\n\r\n"Well, mother." Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: "Did you\r\nthink I was going to let him suppose we were piqued at his not coming?\r\nDid you suppose I was going to let him patronize us, or think that we\r\nwere in the least dependent on his favor or friendship?"\r\n\r\nHer mother did not attempt to answer her. She merely said, "I shouldn\'t\r\nthink he would come any more."\r\n\r\n"Well, we have got on so far without him; perhaps we can live through the\r\nrest of the winter."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help feeling sorry for him. He was quite stupefied. I could\r\nsee that he didn\'t know what to make of you."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not required to make anything of me," said Alma.\r\n\r\n"Do you think he really believed you had forgotten all those things?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible to say, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think it was quite right, Alma."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll leave him to you the next time. Miss Woodburn said you were\r\nfreezing him to death when I came down."\r\n\r\n"That was quite different. But, there won\'t be any next time, I\'m\r\nafraid," sighed Mrs. Leighton.\r\n\r\nBeaton went home feeling sure there would not. He tried to read when he\r\ngot to his room; but Alma\'s looks, tones, gestures, whirred through and\r\nthrough the woof of the story like shuttles; he could not keep them out,\r\nand he fell asleep at last, not because he forgot them, but because he\r\nforgave them. He was able to say to himself that he had been justly cut\r\noff from kindness which he knew how to value in losing it. He did not\r\nexpect ever to right himself in Alma\'s esteem, but he hoped some day to\r\nlet her know that he had understood. It seemed to him that it would be a\r\ngood thing if she should find it out after his death. He imagined her\r\nbeing touched by it under those circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it seemed to Beaton that he had done himself injustice.\r\nWhen he uncovered his Judas and looked at it, he could not believe that\r\nthe man who was capable of such work deserved the punishment Miss\r\nLeighton had inflicted upon him. He still forgave her, but in the\r\npresence of a thing like that he could not help respecting himself; he\r\nbelieved that if she could see it she would be sorry that she had cut\r\nherself off from his acquaintance. He carried this strain of conviction\r\nall through his syndicate letter, which he now took out of his desk and\r\nfinished, with an increasing security of his opinions and a mounting\r\nseverity in his judgments. He retaliated upon the general condition of\r\nart among us the pangs of wounded vanity, which Alma had made him feel,\r\nand he folded up his manuscript and put it in his pocket, almost healed\r\nof his humiliation. He had been able to escape from its sting so entirely\r\nwhile he was writing that the notion of making his life more and more\r\nliterary commended itself to him. As it was now evident that the future\r\nwas to be one of renunciation, of self-forgetting, an oblivion tinged\r\nwith bitterness, he formlessly reasoned in favor of reconsidering his\r\nresolution against Fulkerson\'s offer. One must call it reasoning, but it\r\nwas rather that swift internal dramatization which constantly goes on in\r\npersons of excitable sensibilities, and which now seemed to sweep Beaton\r\nphysically along toward the \'Every Other Week\' office, and carried his\r\nmind with lightning celerity on to a time when he should have given that\r\njournal such quality and authority in matters of art as had never been\r\nenjoyed by any in America before. With the prosperity which he made\r\nattend his work he changed the character of the enterprise, and with\r\nFulkerson\'s enthusiastic support he gave the public an art journal of as\r\nhigh grade as \'Les Lettres et les Arts\', and very much that sort of\r\nthing. All this involved now the unavailing regret of Alma Leighton, and\r\nnow his reconciliation with her: they were married in Grace Church,\r\nbecause Beaton had once seen a marriage there, and had intended to paint\r\na picture of it some time.\r\n\r\nNothing in these fervid fantasies prevented his responding with due\r\ndryness to Fulkerson\'s cheery "Hello, old man!" when he found himself in\r\nthe building fitted up for the \'Every Other Week\' office. Fulkerson\'s\r\nroom was back of the smaller one occupied by the bookkeeper; they had\r\nbeen respectively the reception-room and dining-room of the little place\r\nin its dwelling-house days, and they had been simply and tastefully\r\ntreated in their transformation into business purposes. The narrow old\r\ntrim of the doors and windows had been kept, and the quaintly ugly marble\r\nmantels. The architect had said, Better let them stay they expressed\r\nepoch, if not character.\r\n\r\n"Well, have you come round to go to work? Just hang up your coat on the\r\nfloor anywhere," Fulkerson went on.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to bring you that letter," said Beaton, all the more haughtily\r\nbecause he found that Fulkerson was not alone when he welcomed him in\r\nthese free and easy terms. There was a quiet-looking man, rather stout,\r\nand a little above the middle height, with a full, close-cropped\r\niron-gray beard, seated beyond the table where Fulkerson tilted himself\r\nback, with his knees set against it; and leaning against the mantel there\r\nwas a young man with a singularly gentle face, in which the look of\r\ngoodness qualified and transfigured a certain simplicity. His large blue\r\neyes were somewhat prominent; and his rather narrow face was drawn\r\nforward in a nose a little too long perhaps, if it had not been for the\r\nfull chin deeply cut below the lip, and jutting firmly forward.\r\n\r\n"Introduce you to Mr. March, our editor, Mr. Beaton," Fulkerson said,\r\nrolling his head in the direction of the elder man; and then nodding it\r\ntoward the younger, he said, "Mr. Dryfoos, Mr. Beaton." Beaton shook\r\nhands with March, and then with Mr. Dryfoos, and Fulkerson went on,\r\ngayly: "We were just talking of you, Beaton--well, you know the old\r\nsaying. Mr. March, as I told you, is our editor, and Mr. Dryfoos has\r\ncharge of the publishing department--he\'s the counting-room incarnate,\r\nthe source of power, the fountain of corruption, the element that\r\nprevents journalism being the high and holy thing that it would be if\r\nthere were no money in it." Mr. Dryfoos turned his large, mild eyes upon\r\nBeaton, and laughed with the uneasy concession which people make to a\r\ncharacter when they do not quite approve of the character\'s language.\r\n"What Mr. March and I are trying to do is to carry on this thing so that\r\nthere won\'t be any money in it--or very little; and we\'re planning to\r\ngive the public a better article for the price than it\'s ever had before.\r\nNow here\'s a dummy we\'ve had made up for \'Every Other Week\', and as we\'ve\r\ndecided to adopt it, we would naturally like your opinion of it, so\'s to\r\nknow what opinion to have of you." He reached forward and pushed toward\r\nBeaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinary duodecimo book;\r\nits ivory-white pebbled paper cover was prettily illustrated with a\r\nwater-colored design irregularly washed over the greater part of its\r\nsurface: quite across the page at top, and narrowing from right to left\r\nas it descended. In the triangular space left blank the title of the\r\nperiodical and the publisher\'s imprint were tastefully lettered so as to\r\nbe partly covered by the background of color.\r\n\r\n"It\'s like some of those Tartarin books of Daudet\'s," said Beacon,\r\nlooking at it with more interest than he suffered to be seen. "But it\'s a\r\nbook, not a magazine." He opened its pages of thick, mellow white paper,\r\nwith uncut leaves, the first few pages experimentally printed in the type\r\nintended to be used, and illustrated with some sketches drawn into and\r\nover the text, for the sake of the effect.\r\n\r\n"A Daniel--a Daniel come to judgment! Sit down, Dan\'el, and take it\r\neasy." Fulkerson pushed a chair toward Beaton, who dropped into it.\r\n"You\'re right, Dan\'el; it\'s a book, to all practical intents and\r\npurposes. And what we propose to do with the American public is to give\r\nit twenty-four books like this a year--a complete library--for the absurd\r\nsum of six dollars. We don\'t intend to sell \'em--it\'s no name for the\r\ntransaction--but to give \'em. And what we want to get out of you--beg,\r\nborrow, buy, or steal from you is an opinion whether we shall make the\r\nAmerican public this princely present in paper covers like this, or in\r\nsome sort of flexible boards, so they can set them on the shelf and say\r\nno more about it. Now, Dan\'el, come to judgment, as our respected friend\r\nShylock remarked."\r\n\r\nBeacon had got done looking at the dummy, and he dropped it on the table\r\nbefore Fulkerson, who pushed it away, apparently to free himself from\r\npartiality. "I don\'t know anything about the business side, and I can\'t\r\ntell about the effect of either style on the sales; but you\'ll spoil the\r\nwhole character of the cover if you use anything thicker than that\r\nthickish paper."\r\n\r\n"All right; very good; first-rate. The ayes have it. Paper it is. I don\'t\r\nmind telling you that we had decided for that paper before you came in.\r\nMr. March wanted it, because he felt in his bones just the way you do\r\nabout it, and Mr. Dryfoos wanted it, because he\'s the counting-room\r\nincarnate, and it\'s cheaper; and I wanted it, because I always like to\r\ngo with the majority. Now what do you think of that little design\r\nitself?"\r\n\r\n"The sketch?" Beaton pulled the book toward him again and looked at it\r\nagain. "Rather decorative. Drawing\'s not remarkable. Graceful; rather\r\nnice." He pushed the book away again, and Fulkerson pulled it to his aide\r\nof the table.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s a piece of that amateur trash you despise so much. I went\r\nto a painter I know-by-the-way, he was guilty of suggesting you for this\r\nthing, but I told him I was ahead of him--and I got him to submit my idea\r\nto one of his class, and that\'s the result. Well, now, there ain\'t\r\nanything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover, and we\'re\r\ngoing to have a pretty cover for \'Every Other Week\' every time. We\'ve cut\r\nloose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size, and we\'ve\r\ncut loose from the old two-column big page magazine size; we\'re going to\r\nhave a duodecimo page, clear black print, and paper that\'ll make your\r\nmouth water; and we\'re going to have a fresh illustration for the cover\r\nof each number, and we ain\'t agoing to give the public any rest at all.\r\nSometimes we\'re going to have a delicate little landscape like this, and\r\nsometimes we\'re going to have an indelicate little figure, or as much so\r\nas the law will allow."\r\n\r\nThe young man leaning against the mantelpiece blushed a sort of protest.\r\n\r\nMarch smiled and said, dryly, "Those are the numbers that Mr. Fulkerson\r\nis going to edit himself."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. And Mr. Beaton, here, is going to supply the floating females,\r\ngracefully airing themselves against a sunset or something of that kind."\r\nBeaton frowned in embarrassment, while Fulkerson went on philosophically;\r\n"It\'s astonishing how you fellows can keep it up at this stage of the\r\nproceedings; you can paint things that your harshest critic would be\r\nashamed to describe accurately; you\'re as free as the theatre. But that\'s\r\nneither here nor there. What I\'m after is the fact that we\'re going to\r\nhave variety in our title-pages, and we are going to have novelty in the\r\nillustrations of the body of the book. March, here, if he had his own\r\nway, wouldn\'t have any illustrations at all."\r\n\r\n"Not because I don\'t like them, Mr. Beacon," March interposed, "but\r\nbecause I like them too much. I find that I look at the pictures in an\r\nillustrated article, but I don\'t read the article very much, and I fancy\r\nthat\'s the case with most other people. You\'ve got to doing them so\r\nprettily that you take our eyes off the literature, if you don\'t take our\r\nminds off."\r\n\r\n"Like the society beauties on the stage: people go in for the beauty so\r\nmuch that they don\'t know what the play is. But the box-office gets there\r\nall the same, and that\'s what Mr. Dryfoos wants." Fulkerson looked up\r\ngayly at Mr. Dryfoos, who smiled deprecatingly.\r\n\r\n"It was different," March went on, "when the illustrations used to be\r\nbad. Then the text had some chance."\r\n\r\n"Old legitimate drama days, when ugliness and genius combined to storm\r\nthe galleries," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"We can still make them bad enough," said Beaton, ignoring Fulkerson in\r\nhis remark to March.\r\n\r\nFulkerson took the reply upon himself. "Well, you needn\'t make \'em so bad\r\nas the old-style cuts; but you can make them unobtrusive, modestly\r\nretiring. We\'ve got hold of a process something like that those French\r\nfellows gave Daudet thirty-five thousand dollars to write a novel to use\r\nwith; kind of thing that begins at one side; or one corner, and spreads\r\nin a sort of dim religious style over the print till you can\'t tell which\r\nis which. Then we\'ve got a notion that where the pictures don\'t behave\r\nquite so sociably, they can be dropped into the text, like a little\r\ncasual remark, don\'t you know, or a comment that has some connection, or\r\nmaybe none at all, with what\'s going on in the story. Something like\r\nthis." Fulkerson took away one knee from the table long enough to open\r\nthe drawer, and pull from it a book that he shoved toward Beacon. "That\'s\r\na Spanish book I happened to see at Brentano\'s, and I froze to it on\r\naccount of the pictures. I guess they\'re pretty good."\r\n\r\n"Do you expect to get such drawings in this country?" asked Beaton, after\r\na glance at the book. "Such character--such drama? You won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not so sure," said Fulkerson, "come to get our amateurs warmed\r\nup to the work. But what I want is to get the physical effect, so to\r\nspeak--get that sized picture into our page, and set the fashion of it. I\r\nshouldn\'t care if the illustration was sometimes confined to an initial\r\nletter and a tail-piece."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t be done here. We haven\'t the touch. We\'re good in some things,\r\nbut this isn\'t in our way," said Beaton, stubbornly. "I can\'t think of a\r\nman who could do it; that is, among those that would."\r\n\r\n"Well, think of some woman, then," said Fulkerson, easily. "I\'ve got a\r\nnotion that the women could help us out on this thing, come to get \'em\r\ninterested. There ain\'t anything so popular as female fiction; why not\r\ntry female art?"\r\n\r\n"The females themselves have been supposed to have been trying it for a\r\ngood while," March suggested; and Mr. Dryfoos laughed nervously; Beaton\r\nremained solemnly silent.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," Fulkerson assented. "But I don\'t mean that kind exactly.\r\nWhat we want to do is to work the \'ewig Weibliche\' in this concern. We\r\nwant to make a magazine that will go for the women\'s fancy every time. I\r\ndon\'t mean with recipes for cooking and fashions and personal gossip\r\nabout authors and society, but real high-tone literature that will show\r\nwomen triumphing in all the stories, or else suffering tremendously.\r\nWe\'ve got to recognize that women form three-fourths of the reading\r\npublic in this country, and go for their tastes and their sensibilities\r\nand their sex-piety along the whole line. They do like to think that\r\nwomen can do things better than men; and if we can let it leak out and\r\nget around in the papers that the managers of \'Every Other Week\' couldn\'t\r\nstir a peg in the line of the illustrations they wanted till they got a\r\nlot of God-gifted girls to help them, it \'ll make the fortune of the\r\nthing. See?"\r\n\r\nHe looked sunnily round at the other men, and March said: "You ought to\r\nbe in charge of a Siamese white elephant, Fulkerson. It\'s a disgrace to\r\nbe connected with you."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Beaton, "that you\'d better get a God-gifted girl\r\nfor your art editor."\r\n\r\nFulkerson leaned alertly forward, and touched him on the shoulder, with a\r\ncompassionate smile. "My dear boy, they haven\'t got the genius of\r\norganization. It takes a very masculine man for that--a man who combines\r\nthe most subtle and refined sympathies with the most forceful purposes\r\nand the most ferruginous will-power. Which his name is Angus Beaton, and\r\nhere he sets!"\r\n\r\nThe others laughed with Fulkerson at his gross burlesque of flattery, and\r\nBeaton frowned sheepishly. "I suppose you understand this man\'s style,"\r\nhe growled toward March.\r\n\r\n"He does, my son," said Fulkerson. "He knows that I cannot tell a lie."\r\nHe pulled out his watch, and then got suddenly upon his feet.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quarter of twelve, and I\'ve got an appointment." Beaton rose too,\r\nand Fulkerson put the two books in his lax hands. "Take these along,\r\nMichelangelo Da Vinci, my friend, and put your multitudinous mind on them\r\nfor about an hour, and let us hear from you to-morrow. We hang upon your\r\ndecision."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no deciding to be done," said Beaton. "You can\'t combine the two\r\nstyles. They\'d kill each other."\r\n\r\n"A Dan\'el, a Dan\'el come to judgment! I knew you could help us out! Take\r\n\'em along, and tell us which will go the furthest with the \'ewig\r\nWeibliche.\' Dryfoos, I want a word with you." He led the way into the\r\nfront room, flirting an airy farewell to Beaton with his hand as he went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMarch and Beaton remained alone together for a moment, and March said: "I\r\nhope you will think it worth while to take hold with us, Mr. Beaton. Mr.\r\nFulkerson puts it in his own way, of course; but we really want to make a\r\nnice thing of the magazine." He had that timidity of the elder in the\r\npresence of the younger man which the younger, preoccupied with his own\r\ntimidity in the presence of the elder, cannot imagine. Besides, March was\r\naware of the gulf that divided him as a literary man from Beaton as an\r\nartist, and he only ventured to feel his way toward sympathy with him.\r\n"We want to make it good; we want to make it high. Fulkerson is right\r\nabout aiming to please the women, but of course he caricatures the way of\r\ngoing about it."\r\n\r\nFor answer, Beaton flung out, "I can\'t go in for a thing I don\'t\r\nunderstand the plan of."\r\n\r\nMarch took it for granted that he had wounded some exposed sensibility\r\nof Beaton\'s. He continued still more deferentially: "Mr. Fulkerson\'s\r\nnotion--I must say the notion is his, evolved from his syndicate\r\nexperience--is that we shall do best in fiction to confine ourselves to\r\nshort stories, and make each number complete in itself. He found that the\r\nmost successful things he could furnish his newspapers were short\r\nstories; we Americans are supposed to excel in writing them; and most\r\npeople begin with them in fiction; and it\'s Mr. Fulkerson\'s idea to work\r\nunknown talent, as he says, and so he thinks he can not only get them\r\neasily, but can gradually form a school of short-story writers. I can\'t\r\nsay I follow him altogether, but I respect his experience. We shall not\r\ndespise translations of short stories, but otherwise the matter will all\r\nbe original, and, of course, it won\'t all be short stories. We shall use\r\nsketches of travel, and essays, and little dramatic studies, and bits of\r\nbiography and history; but all very light, and always short enough to be\r\ncompleted in a single number. Mr. Fulkerson believes in pictures, and\r\nmost of the things would be capable of illustration."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know but this is the whole affair," said March, beginning to\r\nstiffen a little at the young man\'s reticence.\r\n\r\n"I understand. Thank you for taking the trouble to explain.\r\nGood-morning." Beaton bowed himself off, without offering to shake hands.\r\n\r\nFulkerson came in after a while from the outer office, and Mr. Dryfoos\r\nfollowed him. "Well, what do you think of our art editor?"\r\n\r\n"Is he our art editor?" asked March. "I wasn\'t quite certain when he\r\nleft."\r\n\r\n"Did he take the books?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he took the books."\r\n\r\n"I guess he\'s all right, then." Fulkerson added, in concession to the\r\numbrage he detected in March.\r\n\r\n"Beaton has his times of being the greatest ass in the solar system, but\r\nhe usually takes it out in personal conduct. When it comes to work, he\'s\r\na regular horse."\r\n\r\n"He appears to have compromised for the present by being a perfect mule,"\r\nsaid March.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s in a transition state," Fulkerson allowed. "He\'s the man for\r\nus. He really understands what we want. You\'ll see; he\'ll catch on. That\r\nlurid glare of his will wear off in the course of time. He\'s really a\r\ngood fellow when you take him off his guard; and he\'s full of ideas. He\'s\r\nspread out over a good deal of ground at present, and so he\'s pretty\r\nthin; but come to gather him up into a lump, there\'s a good deal of\r\nsubstance to him. Yes, there is. He\'s a first-rate critic, and he\'s a\r\nnice fellow with the other artists. They laugh at his universality, but\r\nthey all like him. He\'s the best kind of a teacher when he condescends to\r\nit; and he\'s just the man to deal with our volunteer work. Yes, sir, he\'s\r\na prize. Well, I must go now."\r\n\r\nFulkerson went out of the street door, and then came quickly back.\r\n"By-the-bye, March, I saw that old dynamiter of yours round at Beaton\'s\r\nroom yesterday."\r\n\r\n"What old dynamiter of mine?"\r\n\r\n"That old one-handed Dutchman--friend of your youth--the one we saw at\r\nMaroni\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Oh-Lindau!" said March, with a vague pang of self reproach for having\r\nthought of Lindau so little after the first flood of his tender feeling\r\ntoward him was past.\r\n\r\n"Yes, our versatile friend was modelling him as Judas Iscariot. Lindau\r\nmakes a first-rate Judas, and Beaton has got a big thing in that head if\r\nhe works the religious people right. But what I was thinking of was\r\nthis--it struck me just as I was going out of the door: Didn\'t you tell\r\nme Lindau knew forty or fifty, different languages?"\r\n\r\n"Four or five, yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, we won\'t quarrel about the number. The question is, Why not work\r\nhim in the field of foreign literature? You can\'t go over all their\r\nreviews and magazines, and he could do the smelling for you, if you could\r\ntrust his nose. Would he know a good thing?"\r\n\r\n"I think he would," said March, on whom the scope of Fulkerson\'s\r\nsuggestion gradually opened. "He used to have good taste, and he must\r\nknow the ground. Why, it\'s a capital idea, Fulkerson! Lindau wrote very\r\nfair English, and he could translate, with a little revision."\r\n\r\n"And he would probably work cheap. Well, hadn\'t you better see him about\r\nit? I guess it \'ll be quite a windfall for him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it will. I\'ll look him up. Thank you for the suggestion,\r\nFulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t mention it! I don\'t mind doing \'Every Other Week\' a good turn\r\nnow and then when it comes in my way." Fulkerson went out again, and this\r\ntime March was finally left with Mr. Dryfoos.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. March was very sorry not to be at home when your sisters called the\r\nother day. She wished me to ask if they had any afternoon in particular.\r\nThere was none on your mother\'s card."\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said the young man, with a flush of embarrassment that seemed\r\nhabitual with him. "She has no day. She\'s at home almost every day. She\r\nhardly ever goes out."\r\n\r\n"Might we come some evening?" March asked. "We should be very glad to do\r\nthat, if she would excuse the informality. Then I could come with Mrs.\r\nMarch."\r\n\r\n"Mother isn\'t very formal," said the young man. "She would be very glad\r\nto see you."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll come some night this week, if you will let us. When do you\r\nexpect your father back?"\r\n\r\n"Not much before Christmas. He\'s trying to settle up some things at\r\nMoffitt."\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of our art editor?" asked March, with a smile, for\r\nthe change of subject.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know much about such things," said the young man, with\r\nanother of his embarrassed flushes. "Mr. Fulkerson seems to feel sure\r\nthat he is the one for us."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson seemed to think that I was the one for you, too," said\r\nMarch; and he laughed. "That\'s what makes me doubt his infallibility. But\r\nhe couldn\'t do worse with Mr. Beaton."\r\n\r\nMr. Dryfoos reddened and looked down, as if unable or unwilling to cope\r\nwith the difficulty of making a polite protest against March\'s\r\nself-depreciation. He said, after a moment: "It\'s new business to all of\r\nus except Mr. Fulkerson. But I think it will succeed. I think we can do\r\nsome good in it."\r\n\r\nMarch asked rather absently, "Some good?" Then he added: "Oh yes; I think\r\nwe can. What do you mean by good? Improve the public taste? Elevate the\r\nstandard of literature? Give young authors and artists a chance?"\r\n\r\nThis was the only good that had ever been in March\'s mind, except the\r\ngood that was to come in a material way from his success, to himself and\r\nto his family.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said the young man; and he looked down in a shamefaced\r\nfashion. He lifted his head and looked into March\'s face. "I suppose I\r\nwas thinking that some time we might help along. If we were to have those\r\nsketches of yours about life in every part of New York--"\r\n\r\nMarch\'s authorial vanity was tickled. "Fulkerson has been talking to you\r\nabout them? He seemed to think they would be a card. He believes that\r\nthere\'s no subject so fascinating to the general average of people\r\nthroughout the country as life in New York City; and he liked my notion\r\nof doing these things." March hoped that Dryfoos would answer that\r\nFulkerson was perfectly enthusiastic about his notion; but he did not\r\nneed this stimulus, and, at any rate, he went on without it. "The fact\r\nis, it\'s something that struck my fancy the moment I came here; I found\r\nmyself intensely interested in the place, and I began to make notes,\r\nconsciously and unconsciously, at once. Yes, I believe I can get\r\nsomething quite attractive out of it. I don\'t in the least know what it\r\nwill be yet, except that it will be very desultory; and I couldn\'t at all\r\nsay when I can get at it. If we postpone the first number till February I\r\nmight get a little paper into that. Yes, I think it might be a good thing\r\nfor us," March said, with modest self-appreciation.\r\n\r\n"If you can make the comfortable people understand how the uncomfortable\r\npeople live, it will be a very good thing, Mr. March. Sometimes it seems\r\nto me that the only trouble is that we don\'t know one another well\r\nenough; and that the first thing is to do this." The young fellow spoke\r\nwith the seriousness in which the beauty of his face resided. Whenever he\r\nlaughed his face looked weak, even silly. It seemed to be a sense of this\r\nthat made him hang his head or turn it away at such times.\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," said March, from the surface only. "And then, those phases\r\nof low life are immensely picturesque. Of course, we must try to get the\r\ncontrasts of luxury for the sake of the full effect. That won\'t be so\r\neasy. You can\'t penetrate to the dinner-party of a millionaire under the\r\nwing of a detective as you could to a carouse in Mulberry Street, or to\r\nhis children\'s nursery with a philanthropist as you can to a street-boy\'s\r\nlodging-house." March laughed, and again the young man turned his head\r\naway. "Still, something can be done in that way by tact and patience."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThat evening March went with his wife to return the call of the Dryfoos\r\nladies. On their way up-town in the Elevated he told her of his talk with\r\nyoung Dryfoos. "I confess I was a little ashamed before him afterward for\r\nhaving looked at the matter so entirely from the aesthetic point of view.\r\nBut of course, you know, if I went to work at those things with an\r\nethical intention explicitly in mind, I should spoil them."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said his wife. She had always heard him say something of\r\nthis kind about such things.\r\n\r\nHe went on: "But I suppose that\'s just the point that such a nature as\r\nyoung Dryfoos\'s can\'t get hold of, or keep hold of. We\'re a queer lot,\r\ndown there, Isabel--perfect menagerie. If it hadn\'t been that Fulkerson\r\ngot us together, and really seems to know what he did it for, I should\r\nsay he was the oddest stick among us. But when I think of myself and my\r\nown crankiness for the literary department; and young Dryfoos, who ought\r\nreally to be in the pulpit, or a monastery, or something, for publisher;\r\nand that young Beaton, who probably hasn\'t a moral fibre in his\r\ncomposition, for the art man, I don\'t know but we could give Fulkerson\r\nodds and still beat him in oddity."\r\n\r\nHis wife heaved a deep sigh of apprehension, of renunciation, of\r\nmonition. "Well, I\'m glad you can feel so light about it, Basil."\r\n\r\n"Light? I feel gay! With Fulkerson at the helm, I tell you the rocks and\r\nthe lee shore had better keep out of the way." He laughed with pleasure\r\nin his metaphor. "Just when you think Fulkerson has taken leave of his\r\nsenses he says or does something that shows he is on the most intimate\r\nand inalienable terms with them all the time. You know how I\'ve been\r\nworrying over those foreign periodicals, and trying to get some\r\ntranslations from them for the first number? Well, Fulkerson has brought\r\nhis centipedal mind to bear on the subject, and he\'s suggested that old\r\nGerman friend of mine I was telling you of--the one I met in the\r\nrestaurant--the friend of my youth."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he could do it?" asked Mrs. March, sceptically.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a perfect Babel of strange tongues; and he\'s the very man for the\r\nwork, and I was ashamed I hadn\'t thought of him myself, for I suspect he\r\nneeds the work."\r\n\r\n"Well, be careful how you get mixed up with him, then, Basil," said his\r\nwife, who had the natural misgiving concerning the friends of her\r\nhusband\'s youth that all wives have. "You know the Germans are so\r\nunscrupulously dependent. You don\'t know anything about him now."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of Lindau," said March. "He was the best and kindest man\r\nI ever saw, the most high-minded, the most generous. He lost a hand in\r\nthe war that helped to save us and keep us possible, and that stump of\r\nhis is character enough for me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you don\'t think I could have meant anything against him!" said Mrs.\r\nMarch, with the tender fervor that every woman who lived in the time of\r\nthe war must feel for those who suffered in it. "All that I meant was\r\nthat I hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much. You\'re so apt\r\nto be carried away by your impulses."\r\n\r\n"They didn\'t carry me very far away in the direction of poor old Lindau,\r\nI\'m ashamed to think," said March. "I meant all sorts of fine things by\r\nhim after I met him; and then I forgot him, and I had to be reminded of\r\nhim by Fulkerson."\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him, and he fell into a remorseful reverie, in which\r\nhe rehabilitated Lindau anew, and provided handsomely for his old age. He\r\ngot him buried with military honors, and had a shaft raised over him,\r\nwith a medallion likeness by Beaton and an epitaph by himself, by the\r\ntime they reached Forty-second Street; there was no time to write\r\nLindau\'s life, however briefly, before the train stopped.\r\n\r\nThey had to walk up four blocks and then half a block across before they\r\ncame to the indistinctive brownstone house where the Dryfooses lived. It\r\nwas larger than some in the same block, but the next neighborhood of a\r\nhuge apartment-house dwarfed it again. March thought he recognized the\r\nvery flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor, but he did not\r\ntell his wife; he made her notice the transition character of the street,\r\nwhich had been mostly built up in apartment-houses, with here and there a\r\nsingle dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them, to that\r\njag-toothed effect on the sky-line so often observable in such New York\r\nstreets. "I don\'t know exactly what the old gentleman bought here for,"\r\nhe said, as they waited on the steps after ringing, "unless he expects to\r\nturn it into flats by-and-by. Otherwise, I don\'t believe he\'ll get his\r\nmoney back."\r\n\r\nAn Irish serving-man, with a certain surprise that delayed him, said the\r\nladies were at home, and let the Marches in, and then carried their cards\r\nup-stairs. The drawing-room, where he said they could sit down while he\r\nwent on this errand, was delicately decorated in white and gold, and\r\nfurnished with a sort of extravagant good taste; there was nothing to\r\nobject to in the satin furniture, the pale, soft, rich carpet, the\r\npictures, and the bronze and china bric-a-brac, except that their\r\ncostliness was too evident; everything in the room meant money too\r\nplainly, and too much of it. The Marches recognized this in the hoarse\r\nwhispers which people cannot get their voices above when they try to talk\r\naway the interval of waiting in such circumstances; they conjectured from\r\nwhat they had heard of the Dryfooses that this tasteful luxury in no wise\r\nexpressed their civilization. "Though when you come to that," said March,\r\n"I don\'t know that Mrs. Green\'s gimcrackery expresses ours."\r\n\r\n"Well, Basil, I didn\'t take the gimcrackery. That was your--"\r\n\r\nThe rustle of skirts on the stairs without arrested Mrs. March in the\r\nwell-merited punishment which she never failed to inflict upon her\r\nhusband when the question of the gimcrackery--they always called it\r\nthat--came up. She rose at the entrance of a bright-looking,\r\npretty-looking, mature, youngish lady, in black silk of a neutral\r\nimplication, who put out her hand to her, and said, with a very cheery,\r\nvery ladylike accent, "Mrs. March?" and then added to both of them, while\r\nshe shook hands with March, and before they could get the name out of\r\ntheir months: "No, not Miss Dryfoos! Neither of them; nor Mrs. Dryfoos.\r\nMrs. Mandel. The ladies will be down in a moment. Won\'t you throw off\r\nyour sacque, Mrs. March? I\'m afraid it\'s rather warm here, coming from\r\nthe outside."\r\n\r\n"I will throw it back, if you\'ll allow me," said Mrs. March, with a sort\r\nof provisionality, as if, pending some uncertainty as to Mrs. Mandel\'s\r\nquality and authority, she did not feel herself justified in going\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nBut if she did not know about Mrs. Mandel, Mrs. Mandel seemed to know\r\nabout her. "Oh, well, do!" she said, with a sort of recognition of the\r\npropriety of her caution. "I hope you are feeling a little at home in New\r\nYork. We heard so much of your trouble in getting a flat, from Mr.\r\nFulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, a true Bostonian doesn\'t give up quite so soon," said Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"But I will say New York doesn\'t seem so far away, now we\'re here."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'ll like it. Every one does." Mrs. Mandel added to March,\r\n"It\'s very sharp out, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Rather sharp. But after our Boston winters I don\'t know but I ought to\r\nrepudiate the word."\r\n\r\n"Ah, wait till you have been here through March!" said Mrs. Mandel. She\r\nbegan with him, but skillfully transferred the close of her remark, and\r\nthe little smile of menace that went with it, to his wife.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. March, "or April, either: Talk about our east winds!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sure they can\'t be worse than our winds," Mrs. Mandel returned,\r\ncaressingly.\r\n\r\n"If we escape New York pneumonia," March laughed, "it will only be to\r\nfall a prey to New York malaria as soon as the frost is out of the\r\nground."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you know," said Mrs. Mandel, "I think our malaria has really\r\nbeen slandered a little. It\'s more a matter of drainage--of plumbing. I\r\ndon\'t believe it would be possible for malaria to get into this house,\r\nwe\'ve had it gone over so thoroughly."\r\n\r\nMrs. March said, while she tried to divine Mrs. Mandel\'s position from\r\nthis statement, "It\'s certainly the first duty."\r\n\r\n"If Mrs. March could have had her way, we should have had the drainage of\r\nour whole ward put in order," said her husband, "before we ventured to\r\ntake a furnished apartment for the winter."\r\n\r\nMrs. Mandel looked discreetly at Mrs. March for permission to laugh at\r\nthis, but at the same moment both ladies became preoccupied with a second\r\nrustling on the stairs.\r\n\r\nTwo tall, well-dressed young girls came in, and Mrs. Mandel introduced,\r\n"Miss Dryfoos, Mrs. March; and Miss Mela Dryfoos, Mr. March," she added,\r\nand the girls shook hands in their several ways with the Marches.\r\n\r\nMiss Dryfoos had keen black eyes, and her hair was intensely black. Her\r\nface, but for the slight inward curve of the nose, was regular, and the\r\nsmallness of her nose and of her mouth did not weaken her face, but gave\r\nit a curious effect of fierceness, of challenge. She had a large black\r\nfan in her hand, which she waved in talking, with a slow, watchful\r\nnervousness. Her sister was blonde, and had a profile like her brother\'s;\r\nbut her chin was not so salient, and the weak look of the mouth was not\r\ncorrected by the spirituality or the fervor of his eyes, though hers were\r\nof the same mottled blue. She dropped into the low seat beside Mrs.\r\nMandel, and intertwined her fingers with those of the hand which Mrs.\r\nMandel let her have. She smiled upon the Marches, while Miss Dryfoos\r\nwatched them intensely, with her eyes first on one and then on the other,\r\nas if she did not mean to let any expression of theirs escape her.\r\n\r\n"My mother will be down in a minute," she said to Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"I hope we\'re not disturbing her. It is so good of you to let us come in\r\nthe evening," Mrs. March replied.\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all," said the girl. "We receive in the evening."\r\n\r\n"When we do receive," Miss Mela put in. "We don\'t always get the chance\r\nto." She began a laugh, which she checked at a smile from Mrs. Mandel,\r\nwhich no one could have seen to be reproving.\r\n\r\nMiss Dryfoos looked down at her fan, and looked up defiantly at Mrs.\r\nMarch. "I suppose you have hardly got settled. We were afraid we would\r\ndisturb you when we called."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! We were very sorry to miss your visit. We are quite settled in\r\nour new quarters. Of course, it\'s all very different from Boston."\r\n\r\n"I hope it\'s more of a sociable place there," Miss Mela broke in again.\r\n"I never saw such an unsociable place as New York. We\'ve been in this\r\nhouse three months, and I don\'t believe that if we stayed three years any\r\nof the neighbors would call."\r\n\r\n"I fancy proximity doesn\'t count for much in New York," March suggested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mandel said: "That\'s what I tell Miss Mela. But she is a very social\r\nnature, and can\'t reconcile herself to the fact."\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t," the girl pouted. "I think it was twice as much fun in\r\nMoffitt. I wish I was there now."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said March, "I think there\'s a great deal more enjoyment in those\r\nsmaller places. There\'s not so much going on in the way of public\r\namusements, and so people make more of one another. There are not so many\r\nconcerts, theatres, operas--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ve got a splendid opera-house in Moffitt. It\'s just grand,"\r\nsaid Miss Mela.\r\n\r\n"Have you been to the opera here, this winter?" Mrs. March asked of the\r\nelder girl.\r\n\r\nShe was glaring with a frown at her sister, and detached her eyes from\r\nher with an effort. "What did you say?" she demanded, with an absent\r\nbluntness. "Oh yes. Yes! We went once. Father took a box at the\r\nMetropolitan."\r\n\r\n"Then you got a good dose of Wagner, I suppose?" said March.\r\n\r\n"What?" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Miss Dryfoos is very fond of Wagner\'s music," Mrs. Mandel\r\nsaid. "I believe you are all great Wagnerites in Boston?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a very bad Bostonian, Mrs. Mandel. I suspect myself of preferring\r\nVerdi," March answered.\r\n\r\nMiss Dryfoos looked down at her fan again, and said, "I like \'Trovatore\'\r\nthe best."\r\n\r\n"It\'s an opera I never get tired of," said March, and Mrs. March and Mrs.\r\nMandel exchanged a smile of compassion for his simplicity. He detected\r\nit, and added: "But I dare say I shall come down with the Wagner fever in\r\ntime. I\'ve been exposed to some malignant cases of it."\r\n\r\n"That night we were there," said Miss Mela, "they had to turn the gas\r\ndown all through one part of it, and the papers said the ladies were\r\nawful mad because they couldn\'t show their diamonds. I don\'t wonder, if\r\nthey all had to pay as much for their boxes as we did. We had to pay\r\nsixty dollars." She looked at the Marches for their sensation at this\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nMarch said: "Well, I think I shall take my box by the month, then. It\r\nmust come cheaper, wholesale."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it don\'t," said the girl, glad to inform him. "The people that\r\nown their boxes, and that had to give fifteen or twenty thousand dollars\r\napiece for them, have to pay sixty dollars a night whenever there\'s a\r\nperformance, whether they go or not."\r\n\r\n"Then I should go every night," March said.\r\n\r\n"Most of the ladies were low neck--"\r\n\r\nMarch interposed, "Well, I shouldn\'t go low-neck."\r\n\r\nThe girl broke into a fondly approving laugh at his drolling. "Oh, I\r\nguess you love to train! Us girls wanted to go low neck, too; but father\r\nsaid we shouldn\'t, and mother said if we did she wouldn\'t come to the\r\nfront of the box once. Well, she didn\'t, anyway. We might just as well\r\n\'a\' gone low neck. She stayed back the whole time, and when they had that\r\ndance--the ballet, you know--she just shut her eyes. Well, Conrad didn\'t\r\nlike that part much, either; but us girls and Mrs. Mandel, we brazened it\r\nout right in the front of the box. We were about the only ones there that\r\nwent high neck. Conrad had to wear a swallow-tail; but father hadn\'t any,\r\nand he had to patch out with a white cravat. You couldn\'t see what he had\r\non in the back o\' the box, anyway."\r\n\r\nMrs. March looked at Miss Dryfoos, who was waving her fan more and more\r\nslowly up and down, and who, when she felt herself looked at, returned\r\nMrs. March\'s smile, which she meant to be ingratiating and perhaps\r\nsympathetic, with a flash that made her start, and then ran her fierce\r\neyes over March\'s face. "Here comes mother," she said, with a sort of\r\nbreathlessness, as if speaking her thought aloud, and through the open\r\ndoor the Marches could see the old lady on the stairs.\r\n\r\nShe paused half-way down, and turning, called up: "Coonrod! Coonrod! You\r\nbring my shawl down with you."\r\n\r\nHer daughter Mela called out to her, "Now, mother, Christine \'ll give it\r\nto you for not sending Mike."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know where he is, Mely, child," the mother answered back.\r\n"He ain\'t never around when he\'s wanted, and when he ain\'t, it seems like\r\na body couldn\'t git shet of him, nohow."\r\n\r\n"Well, you ought to ring for him!" cried Miss Mela, enjoying the joke.\r\n\r\nHer mother came in with a slow step; her head shook slightly as she\r\nlooked about the room, perhaps from nervousness, perhaps from a touch of\r\npalsy. In either case the fact had a pathos which Mrs. March confessed in\r\nthe affection with which she took her hard, dry, large, old hand when she\r\nwas introduced to her, and in the sincerity which she put into the hope\r\nthat she was well.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just middlin\'," Mrs. Dryfoos replied. "I ain\'t never so well,\r\nnowadays. I tell fawther I don\'t believe it agrees with me very well\r\nhere, but he says I\'ll git used to it. He\'s away now, out at Moffitt,"\r\nshe said to March, and wavered on foot a moment before she sank into a\r\nchair. She was a tall woman, who had been a beautiful girl, and her gray\r\nhair had a memory of blondeness in it like Lindau\'s, March noticed. She\r\nwore a simple silk gown, of a Quakerly gray, and she held a handkerchief\r\nfolded square, as it had come from the laundress. Something like the\r\nSabbath quiet of a little wooden meeting-house in thick Western woods\r\nexpressed itself to him from her presence.\r\n\r\n"Laws, mother!" said Miss Mela; "what you got that old thing on for? If\r\nI\'d \'a\' known you\'d \'a\' come down in that!"\r\n\r\n"Coonrod said it was all right, Mely," said her mother.\r\n\r\nMiss Mela explained to the Marches: "Mother was raised among the\r\nDunkards, and she thinks it\'s wicked to wear anything but a gray silk\r\neven for dress-up."\r\n\r\n"You hain\'t never heared o\' the Dunkards, I reckon," the old woman said\r\nto Mrs. March. "Some folks calls \'em the Beardy Men, because they don\'t\r\nnever shave; and they wash feet like they do in the Testament. My uncle\r\nwas one. He raised me."\r\n\r\n"I guess pretty much everybody\'s a Beardy Man nowadays, if he ain\'t a\r\nDunkard!"\r\n\r\nMiss Mela looked round for applause of her sally, but March was saying to\r\nhis wife: "It\'s a Pennsylvania German sect, I believe--something like the\r\nQuakers. I used to see them when I was a boy."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t they something like the Mennists?" asked Mrs. Mandel.\r\n\r\n"They\'re good people," said the old woman, "and the world \'d be a heap\r\nbetter off if there was more like \'em."\r\n\r\nHer son came in and laid a soft shawl over her shoulders before he shook\r\nhands with the visitors. "I am glad you found your way here," he said to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nChristine, who had been bending forward over her fan, now lifted herself\r\nup with a sigh and leaned back in her chair.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry my father isn\'t here," said the young man to Mrs. March. "He\'s\r\nnever met you yet?"\r\n\r\n"No; and I should like to see him. We hear a great deal about your\r\nfather, you know, from Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope you don\'t believe everything Mr. Fulkerson says about\r\npeople," Mela cried. "He\'s the greatest person for carrying on when he\r\ngets going I ever saw. It makes Christine just as mad when him and mother\r\ngets to talking about religion; she says she knows he don\'t care anything\r\nmore about it than the man in the moon. I reckon he don\'t try it on much\r\nwith father."\r\n\r\n"Your fawther ain\'t ever been a perfessor," her mother interposed; "but\r\nhe\'s always been a good church-goin\' man."\r\n\r\n"Not since we come to New York," retorted the girl.\r\n\r\n"He\'s been all broke up since he come to New York," said the old woman,\r\nwith an aggrieved look.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mandel attempted a diversion. "Have you heard any of our great New\r\nYork preachers yet, Mrs. March?"\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t," Mrs. March admitted; and she tried to imply by her\r\ncandid tone that she intended to begin hearing them the very next Sunday.\r\n\r\n"There are a great many things here," said Conrad, "to take your thoughts\r\noff the preaching that you hear in most of the churches. I think the city\r\nitself is preaching the best sermon all the time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that I understand you," said March.\r\n\r\nMela answered for him. "Oh, Conrad has got a lot of notions that nobody\r\ncan understand. You ought to see the church he goes to when he does go.\r\nI\'d about as lief go to a Catholic church myself; I don\'t see a bit o\'\r\ndifference. He\'s the greatest crony with one of their preachers; he\r\ndresses just like a priest, and he says he is a priest." She laughed for\r\nenjoyment of the fact, and her brother cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. March, in her turn, tried to take from it the personal tone which\r\nthe talk was always assuming. "Have you been to the fall exhibition?" she\r\nasked Christine; and the girl drew herself up out of the abstraction she\r\nseemed sunk in.\r\n\r\n"The exhibition?" She looked at Mrs. Mandel.\r\n\r\n"The pictures of the Academy, you know," Mrs. Mandel explained. "Where I\r\nwanted you to go the day you had your dress tried on."\r\n\r\n"No; we haven\'t been yet. Is it good?" She had turned to Mrs. March\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"I believe the fall exhibitions are never so good as the spring ones. But\r\nthere are some good pictures."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe I care much about pictures," said Christine. "I don\'t\r\nunderstand them."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s no excuse for not caring about them," said March, lightly.\r\n"The painters themselves don\'t, half the time."\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him with that glance at once defiant and appealing,\r\ninsolent and anxious, which he had noticed before, especially when she\r\nstole it toward himself and his wife during her sister\'s babble. In the\r\nlight of Fulkerson\'s history of the family, its origin and its ambition,\r\nhe interpreted it to mean a sense of her sister\'s folly and an ignorant\r\nwill to override his opinion of anything incongruous in themselves and\r\ntheir surroundings. He said to himself that she was deathly proud--too\r\nproud to try to palliate anything, but capable of anything that would put\r\nothers under her feet. Her eyes seemed hopelessly to question his wife\'s\r\nsocial quality, and he fancied, with not unkindly interest, the\r\ninexperienced girl\'s doubt whether to treat them with much or little\r\nrespect. He lost himself in fancies about her and her ideals, necessarily\r\nsordid, of her possibilities of suffering, of the triumphs and\r\ndisappointments before her. Her sister would accept both with a lightness\r\nthat would keep no trace of either; but in her they would sink lastingly\r\ndeep. He came out of his reverie to find Mrs. Dryfoos saying to him, in\r\nher hoarse voice:\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s a shame, some of the pictur\'s a body sees in the winders.\r\nThey say there\'s a law ag\'inst them things; and if there is, I don\'t\r\nunderstand why the police don\'t take up them that paints \'em. I hear\r\ntell, since I been here, that there\'s women that goes to have pictur\'s\r\ntook from them that way by men painters." The point seemed aimed at\r\nMarch, as if he were personally responsible for the scandal, and it fell\r\nwith a silencing effect for the moment. Nobody seemed willing to take it\r\nup, and Mrs. Dryfoos went on, with an old woman\'s severity: "I say they\r\nought to be all tarred and feathered and rode on a rail. They\'d be\r\ndrummed out of town in Moffitt."\r\n\r\nMiss Mela said, with a crowing laugh: "I should think they would! And\r\nthey wouldn\'t anybody go low neck to the opera-house there, either--not\r\nlow neck the way they do here, anyway."\r\n\r\n"And that pack of worthless hussies," her mother resumed, "that come out\r\non the stage, and begun to kick."\r\n\r\n"Laws, mother!" the girl shouted, "I thought you said you had your eyes\r\nshut!"\r\n\r\nAll but these two simpler creatures were abashed at the indecorum of\r\nsuggesting in words the commonplaces of the theatre and of art.\r\n\r\n"Well, I did, Mely, as soon as I could believe my eyes. I don\'t know what\r\nthey\'re doin\' in all their churches, to let such things go on," said the\r\nold woman. "It\'s a sin and a shame, I think. Don\'t you, Coonrod?"\r\n\r\nA ring at the door cut short whatever answer he was about to deliver.\r\n\r\n"If it\'s going to be company, Coonrod," said his mother, making an effort\r\nto rise, "I reckon I better go up-stairs."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mr. Fulkerson, I guess," said Conrad. "He thought he might come";\r\nand at the mention of this light spirit Mrs. Dryfoos sank contentedly\r\nback in her chair, and a relaxation of their painful tension seemed to\r\npass through the whole company. Conrad went to the door himself (the\r\nserving-man tentatively, appeared some minutes later) and let in\r\nFulkerson\'s cheerful voice before his cheerful person.\r\n\r\n"Ah, how dye do, Conrad? Brought our friend, Mr. Beaton, with me," those\r\nwithin heard him say; and then, after a sound of putting off overcoats,\r\nthey saw him fill the doorway, with his feet set square and his arms\r\nakimbo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n"Ah! hello! hello!" Fulkerson said, in recognition of the Marches.\r\n"Regular gathering of the clans. How are you, Mrs. Dryfoos? How do you\r\ndo, Mrs. Mandel, Miss Christine, Mela, Aunt Hitty, and all the folks? How\r\nyou wuz?" He shook hands gayly all round, and took a chair next the old\r\nlady, whose hand he kept in his own, and left Conrad to introduce Beaton.\r\nBut he would not let the shadow of Beaton\'s solemnity fall upon the\r\ncompany. He began to joke with Mrs. Dryfoos, and to match rheumatisms\r\nwith her, and he included all the ladies in the range of appropriate\r\npleasantries. "I\'ve brought Mr. Beaton along to-night, and I want you to\r\nmake him feel at home, like you do me, Mrs. Dryfoos. He hasn\'t got any\r\nrheumatism to speak of; but his parents live in Syracuse, and he\'s a kind\r\nof an orphan, and we\'ve just adopted him down at the office. When you\r\ngoing to bring the young ladies down there, Mrs. Mandel, for a champagne\r\nlunch? I will have some hydro-Mela, and Christine it, heigh? How\'s that\r\nfor a little starter? We dropped in at your place a moment, Mrs. March,\r\nand gave the young folks a few pointers about their studies. My goodness!\r\nit does me good to see a boy like that of yours; business, from the word\r\ngo; and your girl just scoops my youthful affections. She\'s a beauty, and\r\nI guess she\'s good, too. Well, well, what a world it is! Miss Christine,\r\nwon\'t you show Mr. Beaton that seal ring of yours? He knows about such\r\nthings, and I brought him here to see it as much as anything. It\'s an\r\nintaglio I brought from the other side," he explained to Mrs. March, "and\r\nI guess you\'ll like to look at it. Tried to give it to the Dryfoos\r\nfamily, and when I couldn\'t, I sold it to \'em. Bound to see it on Miss\r\nChristine\'s hand somehow! Hold on! Let him see it where it belongs,\r\nfirst!"\r\n\r\nHe arrested the girl in the motion she made to take off the ring, and let\r\nher have the pleasure of showing her hand to the company with the ring on\r\nit. Then he left her to hear the painter\'s words about it, which he\r\ncontinued to deliver dissyllabically as he stood with her under a\r\ngas-jet, twisting his elastic figure and bending his head over the ring.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mely, child," Fulkerson went on, with an open travesty of her\r\nmother\'s habitual address, "and how are you getting along? Mrs. Mandel\r\nhold you up to the proprieties pretty strictly? Well, that\'s right. You\r\nknow you\'d be roaming all over the pasture if she didn\'t."\r\n\r\nThe girl gurgled out her pleasure in his funning, and everybody took him\r\non his own ground of privileged character. He brought them all together\r\nin their friendliness for himself, and before the evening was over he had\r\ninspired Mrs. Mandel to have them served with coffee, and had made both\r\nthe girls feel that they had figured brilliantly in society, and that two\r\nyoung men had been devoted to them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think he\'s just as lovely as he can live!" said Mela, as she stood\r\na moment with her sister on the scene of her triumph, where the others\r\nhad left them after the departure of their guests.\r\n\r\n"Who?" asked Christine, deeply. As she glanced down at her ring, her eyes\r\nburned with a softened fire.\r\n\r\nShe had allowed Beaton to change it himself from the finger where she had\r\nworn it to the finger on which he said she ought to wear it. She did not\r\nknow whether it was right to let him, but she was glad she had done it.\r\n\r\n"Who? Mr. Fulkerson, goosie-poosie! Not that old stuckup Mr. Beaton of\r\nyours!"\r\n\r\n"He is proud," assented Christine, with a throb of exultation.\r\n\r\nBeaton and Fulkerson went to the Elevated station with the Marches; but\r\nthe painter said he was going to walk home, and Fulkerson let him go\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"One way is enough for me," he explained. "When I walk up, I don\'t walk\r\ndown. Bye-bye, my son!" He began talking about Beaton to the Marches as\r\nthey climbed the station stairs together. "That fellow puzzles me. I\r\ndon\'t know anybody that I have such a desire to kick, and at the same\r\ntime that I want to flatter up so much. Affect you that way?" he asked of\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n"Well, as far as the kicking goes, yes."\r\n\r\n"And how is it with you, Mrs. March?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want to flatter him up."\r\n\r\n"No; really? Why? Hold on! I\'ve got the change."\r\n\r\nFulkerson pushed March away from the ticket-office window; and made them\r\nhis guests, with the inexorable American hospitality, for the ride\r\ndown-town. "Three!" he said to the ticket-seller; and, when he had walked\r\nthem before him out on the platform and dropped his tickets into the urn,\r\nhe persisted in his inquiry, "Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why, because you always want to flatter conceited people, don\'t you?"\r\nMrs. March answered, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Do you? Yes, I guess you do. You think Beaton is conceited?"\r\n\r\n"Well, slightly, Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'re partly right," said Fulkerson, with a sigh, so\r\nunaccountable in its connection that they all laughed.\r\n\r\n"An ideal \'busted\'?" March suggested.\r\n\r\n"No, not that, exactly," said Fulkerson. "But I had a notion maybe Beaton\r\nwasn\'t conceited all the time."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" Mrs. March exulted, "nobody could be so conceited all the time as\r\nMr. Beaton is most of the time. He must have moments of the direst\r\nmodesty, when he\'d be quite flattery-proof."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s what I mean. I guess that\'s what makes me want to kick him.\r\nHe\'s left compliments on my hands that no decent man would."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s tragical," said March.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson," Mrs. March began, with change of subject in her voice,\r\n"who is Mrs. Mandel?"\r\n\r\n"Who? What do you think of her?" he rejoined. "I\'ll tell you about her\r\nwhen we get in the cars. Look at that thing! Ain\'t it beautiful?"\r\n\r\nThey leaned over the track and looked up at the next station, where the\r\ntrain, just starting, throbbed out the flame-shot steam into the white\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n"The most beautiful thing in New York--the one always and certainly\r\nbeautiful thing here," said March; and his wife sighed, "Yes, yes." She\r\nclung to him, and remained rapt by the sight till the train drew near,\r\nand then pulled him back in a panic.\r\n\r\n"Well, there ain\'t really much to tell about her," Fulkerson resumed when\r\nthey were seated in the car. "She\'s an invention of mine."\r\n\r\n"Of yours?" cried Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"Of course!" exclaimed her husband.\r\n\r\n"Yes--at least in her present capacity. She sent me a story for the\r\nsyndicate, back in July some time, along about the time I first met old\r\nDryfoos here. It was a little too long for my purpose, and I thought I\r\ncould explain better how I wanted it cut in a call than I could in a\r\nletter. She gave a Brooklyn address, and I went to see her. I found her,"\r\nsaid Fulkerson, with a vague defiance, "a perfect lady. She was living\r\nwith an aunt over there; and she had seen better days, when she was a\r\ngirl, and worse ones afterward. I don\'t mean to say her husband was a bad\r\nfellow; I guess he was pretty good; he was her music-teacher; she met him\r\nin Germany, and they got married there, and got through her property\r\nbefore they came over here. Well, she didn\'t strike me like a person that\r\ncould make much headway in literature. Her story was well enough, but it\r\nhadn\'t much sand in it; kind of-well, academic, you know. I told her so,\r\nand she understood, and cried a little; but she did the best she could\r\nwith the thing, and I took it and syndicated it. She kind of stuck in my\r\nmind, and the first time I went to see the Dryfooses they were stopping\r\nat a sort of family hotel then till they could find a house--" Fulkerson\r\nbroke off altogether, and said, "I don\'t know as I know just how the\r\nDryfooses struck you, Mrs. March?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you imagine?" she answered, with a kindly, smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I don\'t believe I could guess how they would have struck you\r\nlast summer when I first saw them. My! oh my! there was the native earth\r\nfor you. Mely is a pretty wild colt now, but you ought to have seen her\r\nbefore she was broken to harness.\r\n\r\n"And Christine? Ever see that black leopard they got up there in the\r\nCentral Park? That was Christine. Well, I saw what they wanted. They all\r\nsaw it--nobody is a fool in all directions, and the Dryfooses are in\r\ntheir right senses a good deal of the time. Well, to cut a long story\r\nshort, I got Mrs. Mandel to take \'em in hand--the old lady as well as the\r\ngirls. She was a born lady, and always lived like one till she saw\r\nMandel; and that something academic that killed her for a writer was just\r\nthe very thing for them. She knows the world well enough to know just how\r\nmuch polish they can take on, and she don\'t try to put on a bit more.\r\nSee?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can see," said Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"Well, she took hold at once, as ready as a hospital-trained nurse; and\r\nthere ain\'t anything readier on this planet. She runs the whole concern,\r\nsocially and economically, takes all the care of housekeeping off the old\r\nlady\'s hands, and goes round with the girls. By-the-bye, I\'m going to\r\ntake my meals at your widow\'s, March, and Conrad\'s going to have his\r\nlunch there. I\'m sick of browsing about."\r\n\r\n"Mr. March\'s widow?" said his wife, looking at him with provisional\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\n"I have no widow, Isabel," he said, "and never expect to have, till I\r\nleave you in the enjoyment of my life-insurance. I suppose Fulkerson\r\nmeans the lady with the daughter who wanted to take us to board."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. How are they getting on, I do wonder?" Mrs. March asked of\r\nFulkerson.\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'ve got one family to board; but it\'s a small one. I guess\r\nthey\'ll pull through. They didn\'t want to take any day boarders at first,\r\nthe widow said; I guess they have had to come to it."\r\n\r\n"Poor things!" sighed Mrs. March. "I hope they\'ll go back to the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. When you\'ve once tasted New York--You wouldn\'t go\r\nback to Boston, would you?"\r\n\r\n"Instantly."\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed out a tolerant incredulity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nBeaton lit his pipe when he found himself in his room, and sat down\r\nbefore the dull fire in his grate to think. It struck him there was a\r\ndull fire in his heart a great deal like it; and he worked out a fanciful\r\nanalogy with the coals, still alive, and the ashes creeping over them,\r\nand the dead clay and cinders. He felt sick of himself, sick of his life\r\nand of all his works. He was angry with Fulkerson for having got him into\r\nthat art department of his, for having bought him up; and he was bitter\r\nat fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some pressing\r\ndebts, and had not been able to return the check his father had sent him.\r\nHe pitied his poor old father; he ached with compassion for him; and he\r\nset his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own\r\nbaseness. This was the kind of world it was; but he washed his hands of\r\nit. The fault was in human nature, and he reflected with pride that he\r\nhad at least not invented human nature; he had not sunk so low as that\r\nyet. The notion amused him; he thought he might get a Satanic epigram out\r\nof it some way. But in the mean time that girl, that wild animal, she\r\nkept visibly, tangibly before him; if he put out his hand he might touch\r\nhers, he might pass his arm round her waist. In Paris, in a set he knew\r\nthere, what an effect she would be with that look of hers, and that\r\nbeauty, all out of drawing! They would recognize the flame quality in\r\nher. He imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit, or nymph, naiad,\r\nwhatever, from one of her native gas-wells. He began to sketch on a bit\r\nof paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed\r\na level, dismal landscape, and a vast flame against an empty sky, and a\r\nshape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from\r\nit. The sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it.\r\nBeaton laughed out. Pretty good to let Fulkerson have that for the cover\r\nof his first number! In black and red it would be effective; it would\r\ncatch the eye from the news-stands. He made a motion to throw it on the\r\nfire, but held it back and slid it into the table-drawer, and smoked on.\r\nHe saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had\r\nbrought away from Fulkerson\'s in the morning and slipped in there, and he\r\ntook it out and looked at it. He made some criticisms in line with his\r\npencil on it, correcting the drawing here and there, and then he\r\nrespected it a little more, though he still smiled at the feminine\r\nquality--a young lady quality.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his experience the night he called upon the Leightons, Beaton\r\ncould not believe that Alma no longer cared for him. She played at having\r\nforgotten him admirably, but he knew that a few months before she had\r\nbeen very mindful of him. He knew he had neglected them since they came\r\nto New York, where he had led them to expect interest, if not attention;\r\nbut he was used to neglecting people, and he was somewhat less used to\r\nbeing punished for it--punished and forgiven. He felt that Alma had\r\npunished him so thoroughly that she ought to have been satisfied with her\r\nwork and to have forgiven him in her heart afterward. He bore no\r\nresentment after the first tingling moments were past; he rather admired\r\nher for it; and he would have been ready to go back half an hour later\r\nand accept pardon and be on the footing of last summer again. Even now he\r\ndebated with himself whether it was too late to call; but, decidedly, a\r\nquarter to ten seemed late. The next day he determined never to call upon\r\nthe Leightons again; but he had no reason for this; it merely came into a\r\ntransitory scheme of conduct, of retirement from the society of women\r\naltogether; and after dinner he went round to see them.\r\n\r\nHe asked for the ladies, and they all three received him, Alma not\r\nwithout a surprise that intimated itself to him, and her mother with no\r\nappreciable relenting; Miss Woodburn, with the needlework which she found\r\neasier to be voluble over than a book, expressed in her welcome a\r\nneutrality both cordial to Beaton and loyal to Alma.\r\n\r\n"Is it snowing outdo\'s?" she asked, briskly, after the greetings were\r\ntransacted. "Mah goodness!" she said, in answer to his apparent surprise\r\nat the question. "Ah mahght as well have stayed in the Soath, for all the\r\nwinter Ah have seen in New York yet."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t often have snow much before New-Year\'s," said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"Miss Woodburn is wild for a real Northern winter," Mrs. Leighton\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n"The othah naght Ah woke up and looked oat of the window and saw all the\r\nroofs covered with snow, and it turned oat to be nothing but moonlaght.\r\nAh was never so disappointed in mah lahfe," said Miss Woodburn.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll come to St. Barnaby next summer, you shall have all the winter\r\nyou want," said Alma.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you slander St. Barnaby in that way," said Beaton, with the\r\nair of wishing to be understood as meaning more than he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes?" returned Alma, coolly. "I didn\'t know you were so fond of the\r\nclimate."\r\n\r\n"I never think of it as a climate. It\'s a landscape. It doesn\'t matter\r\nwhether it\'s hot or cold."\r\n\r\n"With the thermometer twenty below, you\'d find that it mattered," Alma\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\n"Is that the way you feel about St. Barnaby, too, Mrs. Leighton?" Beaton\r\nasked, with affected desolation.\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad enough to go back in the summer," Mrs. Leighton\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\n"And I should be glad to go now," said Beaton, looking at Alma. He had\r\nthe dummy of \'Every Other Week\' in his hand, and he saw Alma\'s eyes\r\nwandering toward it whenever he glanced at her. "I should be glad to go\r\nanywhere to get out of a job I\'ve undertaken," he continued, to Mrs.\r\nLeighton. "They\'re going to start some sort of a new illustrated\r\nmagazine, and they\'ve got me in for their art department. I\'m not fit for\r\nit; I\'d like to run away. Don\'t you want to advise me a little, Mrs.\r\nLeighton? You know how much I value your taste, and I\'d like to have you\r\nlook at the design for the cover of the first number: they\'re going to\r\nhave a different one for every number. I don\'t know whether you\'ll agree\r\nwith me, but I think this is rather nice."\r\n\r\nHe faced the dummy round, and then laid it on the table before Mrs.\r\nLeighton, pushing some of her work aside to make room for it and standing\r\nover her while she bent forward to look at it.\r\n\r\nAlma kept her place, away from the table.\r\n\r\n"Mah goodness! Ho\' exciting!" said Miss Woodburn. "May anybody look?"\r\n\r\n"Everybody," said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"Well, isn\'t it perfectly choming!" Miss Woodburn exclaimed. "Come and\r\nlook at this, Miss Leighton," she called to Alma, who reluctantly\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n"What lines are these?" Mrs. Leighton asked, pointing to Beaton\'s pencil\r\nscratches.\r\n\r\n"They\'re suggestions of modifications," he replied.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they improve it much. What do you think, Alma?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said the girl, constraining her voice to an effect of\r\nindifference and glancing carelessly down at the sketch. "The design\r\nmight be improved; but I don\'t think those suggestions would do it."\r\n\r\n"They\'re mine," said Beaton, fixing his eyes upon her with a beautiful\r\nsad dreaminess that he knew he could put into them; he spoke with a\r\ndreamy remoteness of tone--his wind-harp stop, Wetmore called it.\r\n\r\n"I supposed so," said Alma, calmly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mah goodness!" cried Miss Woodburn. "Is that the way you awtusts\r\ntalk to each othah? Well, Ah\'m glad Ah\'m not an awtust--unless I could do\r\nall the talking."\r\n\r\n"Artists cannot tell a fib," Alma said, "or even act one," and she\r\nlaughed in Beaton\'s upturned face.\r\n\r\nHe did not unbend his dreamy gaze. "You\'re quite right. The suggestions\r\nare stupid."\r\n\r\nAlma turned to Miss Woodburn: "You hear? Even when we speak of our own\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Ah nevah hoad anything lahke it!"\r\n\r\n"And the design itself?" Beaton persisted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m not an art editor," Alma answered, with a laugh of exultant\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\nA tall, dark, grave-looking man of fifty, with a swarthy face and\r\niron-gray mustache and imperial and goatee, entered the room. Beaton knew\r\nthe type; he had been through Virginia sketching for one of the\r\nillustrated papers, and he had seen such men in Richmond. Miss Woodburn\r\nhardly needed to say, "May Ah introduce you to mah fathaw, Co\'nel\r\nWoodburn, Mr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\nThe men shook hands, and Colonel Woodburn said, in that soft, gentle,\r\nslow Southern voice without our Northern contractions: "I am very glad to\r\nmeet you, sir; happy to make yo\' acquaintance. Do not move, madam," he\r\nsaid to Mrs. Leighton, who made a deprecatory motion to let him pass to\r\nthe chair beyond her; "I can find my way." He bowed a bulk that did not\r\nlend itself readily to the devotion, and picked up the ball of yarn she\r\nhad let drop out of her lap in half rising. "Yo\' worsteds, madam."\r\n\r\n"Yarn, yarn, Colonel Woodburn!" Alma shouted. "You\'re quite incorrigible.\r\nA spade is a spade!"\r\n\r\n"But sometimes it is a trump, my dear young lady," said the Colonel, with\r\nunabated gallantry; "and when yo\' mothah uses yarn, it is worsteds. But I\r\nrespect worsteds even under the name of yarn: our ladies--my own mothah\r\nand sistahs--had to knit the socks we wore--all we could get in the woe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and aftah the woe," his daughter put in. "The knitting has not\r\nstopped yet in some places. Have you been much in the Soath, Mr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\nBeaton explained just how much.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said the Colonel, "then you have seen a country making\r\ngigantic struggles to retrieve its losses, sir. The South is advancing\r\nwith enormous strides, sir."\r\n\r\n"Too fast for some of us to keep up," said Miss Woodburn, in an audible\r\naside. "The pace in Charlottesboag is pofectly killing, and we had to\r\ndrop oat into a slow place like New York."\r\n\r\n"The progress in the South is material now," said the Colonel; "and those\r\nof us whose interests are in another direction find ourselves--isolated\r\n--isolated, sir. The intellectual centres are still in the No\'th, sir;\r\nthe great cities draw the mental activity of the country to them, sir.\r\nNecessarily New York is the metropolis."\r\n\r\n"Oh, everything comes here," said Beaton, impatient of the elder\'s\r\nponderosity. Another sort of man would have sympathized with the\r\nSoutherner\'s willingness to talk of himself, and led him on to speak of\r\nhis plans and ideals. But the sort of man that Beaton was could not do\r\nthis; he put up the dummy into the wrapper he had let drop on the floor\r\nbeside him, and tied it round with string while Colonel Woodburn was\r\ntalking. He got to his feet with the words he spoke and offered Mrs.\r\nLeighton his hand.\r\n\r\n"Must you go?" she asked, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"I am on my way to a reception," he said. She had noticed that he was in\r\nevening dress; and now she felt the vague hurt that people invited\r\nnowhere feel in the presence of those who are going somewhere. She did\r\nnot feel it for herself, but for her daughter; and she knew Alma would\r\nnot have let her feel it if she could have prevented it. But Alma had\r\nleft the room for a moment, and she tacitly indulged this sense of injury\r\nin her behalf.\r\n\r\n"Please say good-night to Miss Leighton for me," Beaton continued. He\r\nbowed to Miss Woodburn, "Goodnight, Miss Woodburn," and to her father,\r\nbluntly, "Goodnight."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, sir," said the Colonel, with a sort of severe suavity.\r\n\r\n"Oh, isn\'t he choming!" Miss Woodburn whispered to Mrs. Leighton when\r\nBeaton left the room.\r\n\r\nAlma spoke to him in the hall without. "You knew that was my design, Mr.\r\nBeaton. Why did you bring it?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" He looked at her in gloomy hesitation.\r\n\r\nThen he said: "You know why. I wished to talk it over with you, to serve\r\nyou, please you, get back your good opinion. But I\'ve done neither the\r\none nor the other; I\'ve made a mess of the whole thing."\r\n\r\nAlma interrupted him. "Has it been accepted?"\r\n\r\n"It will be accepted, if you will let it."\r\n\r\n"Let it?" she laughed. "I shall be delighted." She saw him swayed a\r\nlittle toward her. "It\'s a matter of business, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Purely. Good-night."\r\n\r\nWhen Alma returned to the room, Colonel Woodburn was saying to Mrs.\r\nLeighton: "I do not contend that it is impossible, madam, but it is very\r\ndifficult in a thoroughly commercialized society, like yours, to have the\r\nfeelings of a gentleman. How can a business man, whose prosperity, whose\r\nearthly salvation, necessarily lies in the adversity of some one else, be\r\ndelicate and chivalrous, or even honest? If we could have had time to\r\nperfect our system at the South, to eliminate what was evil and develop\r\nwhat was good in it, we should have had a perfect system. But the virus\r\nof commercialism was in us, too; it forbade us to make the best of a\r\ndivine institution, and tempted us to make the worst. Now the curse is on\r\nthe whole country; the dollar is the measure of every value, the stamp of\r\nevery success. What does not sell is a failure; and what sells succeeds."\r\n\r\n"The hobby is oat, mah deah," said Miss Woodburn, in an audible aside to\r\nAlma.\r\n\r\n"Were you speaking of me, Colonel Woodburn?" Alma asked.\r\n\r\n"Surely not, my dear young lady."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s been saying that awtusts are just as greedy aboat money as\r\nanybody," said his daughter.\r\n\r\n"The law of commercialism is on everything in a commercial society," the\r\nColonel explained, softening the tone in which his convictions were\r\npresented. "The final reward of art is money, and not the pleasure of\r\ncreating."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they would be willing to take it all oat in that if othah people\r\nwould let them pay their bills in the pleasure of creating," his daughter\r\nteased.\r\n\r\n"They are helpless, like all the rest," said her father, with the same\r\ndeference to her as to other women. "I do not blame them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mah goodness! Didn\'t you say, sir, that Mr. Beaton had bad manners?"\r\n\r\nAlma relieved a confusion which he seemed to feel in reference to her.\r\n"Bad manners? He has no manners! That is, when he\'s himself. He has\r\npretty good ones when he\'s somebody else."\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn began, "Oh, mah--" and then stopped herself. Alma\'s mother\r\nlooked at her with distressed question, but the girl seemed perfectly\r\ncool and contented; and she gave her mind provisionally to a point\r\nsuggested by Colonel Woodburn\'s talk.\r\n\r\n"Still, I can\'t believe it was right to hold people in slavery, to whip\r\nthem and sell them. It never did seem right to me," she added, in apology\r\nfor her extreme sentiments to the gentleness of her adversary.\r\n\r\n"I quite agree with you, madam," said the Colonel. "Those were the abuses\r\nof the institution. But if we had not been vitiated on the one hand and\r\nthreatened on the other by the spirit of commercialism from the\r\nNorth--and from Europe, too--those abuses could have been eliminated, and\r\nthe institution developed in the direction of the mild patriarchalism of\r\nthe divine intention." The Colonel hitched his chair, which figured a\r\nhobby careering upon its hind legs, a little toward Mrs. Leighton and the\r\ngirls approached their heads and began to whisper; they fell\r\ndeferentially silent when the Colonel paused in his argument, and went on\r\nagain when he went on.\r\n\r\nAt last they heard Mrs. Leighton saying, "And have you heard from the\r\npublishers about your book yet?"\r\n\r\nThen Miss Woodburn cut in, before her father could answer: "The coase of\r\ncommercialism is on that, too. They are trahing to fahnd oat whethah it\r\nwill pay."\r\n\r\n"And they are right--quite right," said the Colonel. "There is no longer\r\nany other criterion; and even a work that attacks the system must be\r\nsubmitted to the tests of the system."\r\n\r\n"The system won\'t accept destruction on any othah tomes," said Miss\r\nWoodburn, demurely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nAt the reception, where two men in livery stood aside to let him pass up\r\nthe outside steps of the house, and two more helped him off with his\r\novercoat indoors, and a fifth miscalled his name into the drawing-room,\r\nthe Syracuse stone-cutter\'s son met the niece of Mrs. Horn, and began at\r\nonce to tell her about his evening at the Dryfooses\'. He was in very good\r\nspirits, for so far as he could have been elated or depressed by his\r\nparting with Alma Leighton he had been elated; she had not treated his\r\nimpudence with the contempt that he felt it deserved; she must still be\r\nfond of him; and the warm sense of this, by operation of an obscure but\r\nwell-recognized law of the masculine being, disposed him to be rather\r\nfond of Miss Vance. She was a slender girl, whose semi-aesthetic dress\r\nflowed about her with an accentuation of her long forms, and redeemed\r\nthem from censure by the very frankness with which it confessed them;\r\nnobody could have said that Margaret Vance was too tall. Her pretty\r\nlittle head, which she had an effect of choosing to have little in the\r\nsame spirit of judicious defiance, had a good deal of reading in it; she\r\nwas proud to know literary and artistic fashions as well as society\r\nfashions. She liked being singled out by an exterior distinction so\r\nobvious as Beaton\'s, and she listened with sympathetic interest to his\r\naccount of those people. He gave their natural history reality by drawing\r\nupon his own; he reconstructed their plebeian past from the experiences\r\nof his childhood and his youth of the pre-Parisian period; and he had a\r\npang of suicidal joy in insulting their ignorance of the world.\r\n\r\n"What different kinds of people you meet!" said the girl at last, with an\r\nenvious sigh. Her reading had enlarged the bounds of her imagination, if\r\nnot her knowledge; the novels nowadays dealt so much with very common\r\npeople, and made them seem so very much more worth while than the people\r\none met.\r\n\r\nShe said something like this to Beaton. He answered: "You can meet the\r\npeople I\'m talking of very easily, if you want to take the trouble. It\'s\r\nwhat they came to New York for. I fancy it\'s the great ambition of their\r\nlives to be met."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Miss Vance, fashionably, and looked down; then she looked\r\nup and said, intellectually: "Don\'t you think it\'s a great pity? How much\r\nbetter for them to have stayed where they were and what they were!"\r\n\r\n"Then you could never have had any chance of meeting them," said Beaton.\r\n"I don\'t suppose you intend to go out to the gas country?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Miss Vance, amused. "Not that I shouldn\'t like to go."\r\n\r\n"What a daring spirit! You ought to be on the staff of \'Every Other\r\nWeek,\'" said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"The staff--\'Every Other Week\'? What is it?"\r\n\r\n"The missing link; the long-felt want of a tie between the Arts and the\r\nDollars." Beaton gave her a very picturesque, a very dramatic sketch of\r\nthe theory, the purpose, and the personnel of the new enterprise.\r\n\r\nMiss Vance understood too little about business of any kind to know how\r\nit differed from other enterprises of its sort. She thought it was\r\ndelightful; she thought Beaton must be glad to be part of it, though he\r\nhad represented himself so bored, so injured, by Fulkerson\'s insisting\r\nupon having him. "And is it a secret? Is it a thing not to be spoken of?"\r\n\r\n"\'Tutt\' altro\'! Fulkerson will be enraptured to have it spoken of in\r\nsociety. He would pay any reasonable bill for the advertisement."\r\n\r\n"What a delightful creature! Tell him it shall all be spent in charity."\r\n\r\n"He would like that. He would get two paragraphs out of the fact, and\r\nyour name would go into the \'Literary Notes\' of all the newspapers."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I shouldn\'t want my name used!" cried the girl, half horrified\r\ninto fancying the situation real.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'d better not say anything about \'Every Other Week\'. Fulkerson\r\nis preternaturally unscrupulous."\r\n\r\nMarch began to think so too, at times. He was perpetually suggesting\r\nchanges in the make-up of the first number, with a view to its greater\r\nvividness of effect. One day he came and said: "This thing isn\'t going to\r\nhave any sort of get up and howl about it, unless you have a paper in the\r\nfirst number going for Bevans\'s novels. Better get Maxwell to do it."\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought you liked Bevans\'s novels?"\r\n\r\n"So I did; but where the good of \'Every Other Week\' is concerned I am a\r\nRoman father. The popular gag is to abuse Bevans, and Maxwell is the man\r\nto do it. There hasn\'t been a new magazine started for the last three\r\nyears that hasn\'t had an article from Maxwell in its first number cutting\r\nBevans all to pieces. If people don\'t see it, they\'ll think \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' is some old thing."\r\n\r\nMarch did not know whether Fulkerson was joking or not. He suggested,\r\n"Perhaps they\'ll think it\'s an old thing if they do see it."\r\n\r\n"Well, get somebody else, then; or else get Maxwell to write under an\r\nassumed name. Or--I forgot! He\'ll be anonymous under our system, anyway.\r\nNow there ain\'t a more popular racket for us to work in that first number\r\nthan a good, swinging attack on Bevans. People read his books and quarrel\r\nover \'em, and the critics are all against him, and a regular flaying,\r\nwith salt and vinegar rubbed in afterward, will tell more with people who\r\nlike good old-fashioned fiction than anything else. I like Bevans\'s\r\nthings, but, dad burn it! when it comes to that first number, I\'d offer\r\nup anybody."\r\n\r\n"What an immoral little wretch you are, Fulkerson!" said March, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\nFulkerson appeared not to be very strenuous about the attack on the\r\nnovelist. "Say!" he called out, gayly, "what should you think of a paper\r\ndefending the late lamented system of slavery\'?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Fulkerson?" asked March, with a puzzled smile.\r\n\r\nFulkerson braced his knees against his desk, and pushed himself back, but\r\nkept his balance to the eye by canting his hat sharply forward. "There\'s\r\nan old cock over there at the widow\'s that\'s written a book to prove that\r\nslavery was and is the only solution of the labor problem. He\'s a\r\nSoutherner."\r\n\r\n"I should imagine," March assented.\r\n\r\n"He\'s got it on the brain that if the South could have been let alone by\r\nthe commercial spirit and the pseudophilanthropy of the North, it would\r\nhave worked out slavery into a perfectly ideal condition for the laborer,\r\nin which he would have been insured against want, and protected in all\r\nhis personal rights by the state. He read the introduction to me last\r\nnight. I didn\'t catch on to all the points--his daughter\'s an awfully\r\npretty girl, and I was carrying that fact in my mind all the time, too,\r\nyou know--but that\'s about the gist of it."\r\n\r\n"Seems to regard it as a lost opportunity?" said March.\r\n\r\n"Exactly! What a mighty catchy title, Neigh? Look well on the\r\ntitle-page."\r\n\r\n"Well written?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon so; I don\'t know. The Colonel read it mighty eloquently."\r\n\r\n"It mightn\'t be such bad business," said March, in a muse. "Could you get\r\nme a sight of it without committing yourself?"\r\n\r\n"If the Colonel hasn\'t sent it off to another publisher this morning. He\r\njust got it back with thanks yesterday. He likes to keep it travelling."\r\n\r\n"Well, try it. I\'ve a notion it might be a curious thing."\r\n\r\n"Look here, March," said Fulkerson, with the effect of taking a fresh\r\nhold; "I wish you could let me have one of those New York things of yours\r\nfor the first number. After all, that\'s going to be the great card."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t, Fulkerson; I couldn\'t, really. I want to philosophize the\r\nmaterial, and I\'m too new to it all yet. I don\'t want to do merely\r\nsuperficial sketches."\r\n\r\n"Of course! Of course! I understand that. Well, I don\'t want to hurry\r\nyou. Seen that old fellow of yours yet? I think we ought to have that\r\ntranslation in the first number; don\'t you? We want to give \'em a notion\r\nof what we\'re going to do in that line."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said March; "and I was going out to look up Lindau this morning.\r\nI\'ve inquired at Maroni\'s, and he hasn\'t been there for several days.\r\nI\'ve some idea perhaps he\'s sick. But they gave me his address, and I\'m\r\ngoing to see."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s right. We want the first number to be the keynote in every\r\nway."\r\n\r\nMarch shook his head. "You can\'t make it so. The first number is bound to\r\nbe a failure always, as far as the representative character goes. It\'s\r\ninvariably the case. Look at the first numbers of all the things you\'ve\r\nseen started. They\'re experimental, almost amateurish, and necessarily\r\nso, not only because the men that are making them up are comparatively\r\ninexperienced like ourselves, but because the material sent them to deal\r\nwith is more or less consciously tentative. People send their adventurous\r\nthings to a new periodical because the whole thing is an adventure. I\'ve\r\nnoticed that quality in all the volunteer contributions; it\'s in the\r\narticles that have been done to order even. No; I\'ve about made up my\r\nmind that if we can get one good striking paper into the first number\r\nthat will take people\'s minds off the others, we shall be doing all we\r\ncan possibly hope for. I should like," March added, less seriously, "to\r\nmake up three numbers ahead, and publish the third one first."\r\n\r\nFulkerson dropped forward and struck his fist on the desk. "It\'s a\r\nfirst-rate idea. Why not do it?"\r\n\r\nMarch laughed. "Fulkerson, I don\'t believe there\'s any quackish thing you\r\nwouldn\'t do in this cause. From time to time I\'m thoroughly ashamed of\r\nbeing connected with such a charlatan."\r\n\r\nFulkerson struck his hat sharply backward. "Ah, dad burn it! To give that\r\nthing the right kind of start I\'d walk up and down Broadway between two\r\nboards, with the title-page of \'Every Other Week\' facsimiled on one and my\r\nname and address on the--"\r\n\r\nHe jumped to his feet and shouted, "March, I\'ll do it!"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll hire a lot of fellows to make mud-turtles of themselves, and I\'ll\r\nhave a lot of big facsimiles of the title-page, and I\'ll paint the town\r\nred!"\r\n\r\nMarch looked aghast at him. "Oh, come, now, Fulkerson!"\r\n\r\n"I mean it. I was in London when a new man had taken hold of the old\r\nCornhill, and they were trying to boom it, and they had a procession of\r\nthese mudturtles that reached from Charing Cross to Temple Bar. \'Cornhill\r\nMagazine\'. Sixpence. Not a dull page in it.\' I said to myself then that it\r\nwas the livest thing I ever saw. I respected the man that did that thing\r\nfrom the bottom of my heart. I wonder I ever forgot it. But it shows what\r\na shaky thing the human mind is at its best."\r\n\r\n"You infamous mountebank!", said March, with great amusement at\r\nFulkerson\'s access; "you call that congeries of advertising instinct of\r\nyours the human mind at its best? Come, don\'t be so diffident, Fulkerson.\r\nWell, I\'m off to find Lindau, and when I come back I hope Mr. Dryfoos\r\nwill have you under control. I don\'t suppose you\'ll be quite sane again\r\ntill after the first number is out. Perhaps public opinion will sober you\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"Confound it, March! How do you think they will take it? I swear I\'m\r\ngetting so nervous I don\'t know half the time which end of me is up. I\r\nbelieve if we don\'t get that thing out by the first of February it \'ll be\r\nthe death of me."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t wait till Washington\'s Birthday? I was thinking it would give\r\nthe day a kind of distinction, and strike the public imagination, if--"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll be dogged if I could!" Fulkerson lapsed more and more into the\r\nparlance of his early life in this season of strong excitement. "I\r\nbelieve if Beaton lags any on the art leg I\'ll kill him."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shouldn\'t mind your killing Beaton," said March, tranquilly, as\r\nhe went out.\r\n\r\nHe went over to Third Avenue and took the Elevated down to Chatham\r\nSquare. He found the variety of people in the car as unfailingly\r\nentertaining as ever. He rather preferred the East Side to the West Side\r\nlines, because they offered more nationalities, conditions, and\r\ncharacters to his inspection. They draw not only from the up-town\r\nAmerican region, but from all the vast hive of populations swarming\r\nbetween them and the East River. He had found that, according to the\r\nhour, American husbands going to and from business, and American wives\r\ngoing to and from shopping, prevailed on the Sixth Avenue road, and that\r\nthe most picturesque admixture to these familiar aspects of human nature\r\nwere the brilliant eyes and complexions of the American Hebrews, who\r\notherwise contributed to the effect of well-clad comfort and\r\ncitizen-self-satisfaction of the crowd. Now and then he had found himself\r\nin a car mostly filled with Neapolitans from the constructions far up the\r\nline, where he had read how they are worked and fed and housed like\r\nbeasts; and listening to the jargon of their unintelligible dialect, he\r\nhad occasion for pensive question within himself as to what notion these\r\npoor animals formed of a free republic from their experience of life\r\nunder its conditions; and whether they found them practically very\r\ndifferent from those of the immemorial brigandage and enforced complicity\r\nwith rapine under which they had been born. But, after all, this was an\r\ninfrequent effect, however massive, of travel on the West Side, whereas\r\nthe East offered him continual entertainment in like sort. The sort was\r\nnever quite so squalid. For short distances the lowest poverty, the\r\nhardest pressed labor, must walk; but March never entered a car without\r\nencountering some interesting shape of shabby adversity, which was almost\r\nalways adversity of foreign birth. New York is still popularly supposed\r\nto be in the control of the Irish, but March noticed in these East Side\r\ntravels of his what must strike every observer returning to the city\r\nafter a prolonged absence: the numerical subordination of the dominant\r\nrace. If they do not outvote them, the people of Germanic, of Slavonic,\r\nof Pelasgic, of Mongolian stock outnumber the prepotent Celts; and March\r\nseldom found his speculation centred upon one of these. The small eyes,\r\nthe high cheeks, the broad noses, the puff lips, the bare, cue-filleted\r\nskulls, of Russians, Poles, Czechs, Chinese; the furtive glitter of\r\nItalians; the blonde dulness of Germans; the cold quiet of\r\nScandinavians--fire under ice--were aspects that he identified, and that\r\ngave him abundant suggestion for the personal histories he constructed,\r\nand for the more public-spirited reveries in which he dealt with the\r\nfuture economy of our heterogeneous commonwealth. It must be owned that\r\nhe did not take much trouble about this; what these poor people were\r\nthinking, hoping, fearing, enjoying, suffering; just where and how they\r\nlived; who and what they individually were--these were the matters of his\r\nwaking dreams as he stared hard at them, while the train raced farther\r\ninto the gay ugliness--the shapeless, graceful, reckless picturesqueness\r\nof the Bowery.\r\n\r\nThere were certain signs, certain facades, certain audacities of the\r\nprevailing hideousness that always amused him in that uproar to the eye\r\nwhich the strident forms and colors made. He was interested in the\r\ninsolence with which the railway had drawn its erasing line across the\r\nCorinthian front of an old theatre, almost grazing its fluted pillars,\r\nand flouting its dishonored pediment. The colossal effigies of the fat\r\nwomen and the tuft-headed Circassian girls of cheap museums; the vistas\r\nof shabby cross streets; the survival of an old hip-roofed house here and\r\nthere at their angles; the Swiss chalet, histrionic decorativeness of the\r\nstations in prospect or retrospect; the vagaries of the lines that\r\nnarrowed together or stretched apart according to the width of the\r\navenue, but always in wanton disregard of the life that dwelt, and bought\r\nand sold, and rejoiced or sorrowed, and clattered or crawled, around,\r\nbelow, above--were features of the frantic panorama that perpetually\r\ntouched his sense of humor and moved his sympathy. Accident and then\r\nexigency seemed the forces at work to this extraordinary effect; the play\r\nof energies as free and planless as those that force the forest from the\r\nsoil to the sky; and then the fierce struggle for survival, with the\r\nstronger life persisting over the deformity, the mutilation, the\r\ndestruction, the decay of the weaker. The whole at moments seemed to him\r\nlawless, godless; the absence of intelligent, comprehensive purpose in\r\nthe huge disorder, and the violent struggle to subordinate the result to\r\nthe greater good, penetrated with its dumb appeal the consciousness of a\r\nman who had always been too self-enwrapped to perceive the chaos to which\r\nthe individual selfishness must always lead.\r\n\r\nBut there was still nothing definite, nothing better than a vague\r\ndiscomfort, however poignant, in his half recognition of such facts; and\r\nhe descended the station stairs at Chatham Square with a sense of the\r\nneglected opportunities of painters in that locality. He said to himself\r\nthat if one of those fellows were to see in Naples that turmoil of cars,\r\ntrucks, and teams of every sort, intershot with foot-passengers going and\r\ncoming to and from the crowded pavements, under the web of the railroad\r\ntracks overhead, and amid the spectacular approach of the streets that\r\nopen into the square, he would have it down in his sketch-book at once.\r\nHe decided simultaneously that his own local studies must be illustrated,\r\nand that he must come with the artist and show him just which bits to do,\r\nnot knowing that the two arts can never approach the same material from\r\nthe same point. He thought he would particularly like his illustrator to\r\nrender the Dickensy, cockneyish quality of the shabby-genteel\r\nballad-seller of whom he stopped to ask his way to the street where\r\nLindau lived, and whom he instantly perceived to be, with his stock in\r\ntrade, the sufficient object of an entire study by himself. He had his\r\nballads strung singly upon a cord against the house wall, and held down\r\nin piles on the pavement with stones and blocks of wood. Their control in\r\nthis way intimated a volatility which was not perceptible in their\r\nsentiment. They were mostly tragical or doleful: some of them dealt with\r\nthe wrongs of the working-man; others appealed to a gay experience of the\r\nhigh seas; but vastly the greater part to memories and associations of an\r\nIrish origin; some still uttered the poetry of plantation life in the\r\nartless accents of the end--man. Where they trusted themselves, with\r\nsyntax that yielded promptly to any exigency of rhythmic art, to the\r\nordinary American speech, it was to strike directly for the affections,\r\nto celebrate the domestic ties, and, above all, to embalm the memories of\r\nangel and martyr mothers whose dissipated sons deplored their sufferings\r\ntoo late. March thought this not at all a bad thing in them; he smiled in\r\npatronage of their simple pathos; he paid the tribute of a laugh when the\r\npoet turned, as he sometimes did, from his conception of angel and martyr\r\nmotherhood, and portrayed the mother in her more familiar phases of\r\nvirtue and duty, with the retributive shingle or slipper in her hand. He\r\nbought a pocketful of this literature, popular in a sense which the most\r\nsuccessful book can never be, and enlisted the ballad vendor so deeply in\r\nthe effort to direct him to Lindau\'s dwelling by the best way that he\r\nneglected another customer, till a sarcasm on his absent-mindedness stung\r\nhint to retort, "I\'m a-trying to answer a gentleman a civil question;\r\nthat\'s where the absent-minded comes in."\r\n\r\nIt seemed for some reason to be a day of leisure with the Chinese\r\ndwellers in Mott Street, which March had been advised to take first. They\r\nstood about the tops of basement stairs, and walked two and two along the\r\ndirty pavement, with their little hands tucked into their sleeves across\r\ntheir breasts, aloof in immaculate cleanliness from the filth around\r\nthem, and scrutinizing the scene with that cynical sneer of faint\r\nsurprise to which all aspects of our civilization seem to move their\r\nsuperiority. Their numbers gave character to the street, and rendered not\r\nthem, but what was foreign to them, strange there; so that March had a\r\nsense of missionary quality in the old Catholic church, built long before\r\ntheir incursion was dreamed of. It seemed to have come to them there, and\r\nhe fancied in the statued saint that looked down from its facade\r\nsomething not so much tolerant as tolerated, something propitiatory,\r\nalmost deprecatory. It was a fancy, of course; the street was\r\nsufficiently peopled with Christian children, at any rate, swarming and\r\nshrieking at their games; and presently a Christian mother appeared,\r\npushed along by two policemen on a handcart, with a gelatinous tremor\r\nover the paving and a gelatinous jouncing at the curbstones. She lay with\r\nher face to the sky, sending up an inarticulate lamentation; but the\r\nindifference of the officers forbade the notion of tragedy in her case.\r\nShe was perhaps a local celebrity; the children left off their games, and\r\nran gayly trooping after her; even the young fellow and young girl\r\nexchanging playful blows in a robust flirtation at the corner of a liquor\r\nstore suspended their scuffle with a pleased interest as she passed.\r\nMarch understood the unwillingness of the poor to leave the worst\r\nconditions in the city for comfort and plenty in the country when he\r\nreflected upon this dramatic incident, one of many no doubt which daily\r\noccur to entertain them in such streets. A small town could rarely offer\r\nanything comparable to it, and the country never. He said that if life\r\nappeared so hopeless to him as it must to the dwellers in that\r\nneighborhood he should not himself be willing to quit its distractions,\r\nits alleviations, for the vague promise of unknown good in the distance\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\nBut what charm could such a man as Lindau find in such a place? It could\r\nnot be that he lived there because he was too poor to live elsewhere:\r\nwith a shutting of the heart, March refused to believe this as he looked\r\nround on the abounding evidences of misery, and guiltily remembered his\r\nneglect of his old friend. Lindau could probably find as cheap a lodging\r\nin some decenter part of the town; and, in fact, there was some\r\namelioration of the prevailing squalor in the quieter street which he\r\nturned into from Mott.\r\n\r\nA woman with a tied-up face of toothache opened the door for him when he\r\npulled, with a shiver of foreboding, the bell-knob, from which a yard of\r\nrusty crape dangled. But it was not Lindau who was dead, for the woman\r\nsaid he was at home, and sent March stumbling up the four or five dark\r\nflights of stairs that led to his tenement. It was quite at the top of\r\nthe house, and when March obeyed the German-English "Komm!" that followed\r\nhis knock, he found himself in a kitchen where a meagre breakfast was\r\nscattered in stale fragments on the table before the stove. The place was\r\nbare and cold; a half-empty beer bottle scarcely gave it a convivial air.\r\nOn the left from this kitchen was a room with a bed in it, which seemed\r\nalso to be a cobbler\'s shop: on the right, through a door that stood\r\najar, came the German-English voice again, saying this time, "Hier!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nMarch pushed the door open into a room like that on the left, but with a\r\nwriting-desk instead of a cobbler\'s bench, and a bed, where Lindau sat\r\npropped up; with a coat over his shoulders and a skull-cap on his head,\r\nreading a book, from which he lifted his eyes to stare blankly over his\r\nspectacles at March. His hairy old breast showed through the night-shirt,\r\nwhich gaped apart; the stump of his left arm lay upon the book to keep it\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my tear yo\'ng friendt! Passil! Marge! Iss it you?" he called out,\r\njoyously, the next moment.\r\n\r\n"Why, are you sick, Lindau?" March anxiously scanned his face in taking\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nLindau laughed. "No; I\'m all righdt. Only a lidtle lazy, and a lidtle\r\neggonomigal. Idt\'s jeaper to stay in pedt sometimes as to geep a fire\r\na-goin\' all the time. Don\'t wandt to gome too hardt on the \'brafer Mann\',\r\nyou know:\r\n\r\n     "Braver Mann, er schafft mir zu essen."\r\n\r\nYou remember? Heine? You readt Heine still? Who is your favorite boet\r\nnow, Passil? You write some boetry yourself yet? No? Well, I am gladt to\r\nzee you. Brush those baperss off of that jair. Well, idt is goodt for\r\nzore eyess. How didt you findt where I lif?\r\n\r\n"They told me at Maroni\'s," said March. He tried to keep his eyes on\r\nLindau\'s face, and not see the discomfort of the room, but he was aware\r\nof the shabby and frowsy bedding, the odor of stale smoke, and the pipes\r\nand tobacco shreds mixed with the books and manuscripts strewn over the\r\nleaf of the writing-desk. He laid down on the mass the pile of foreign\r\nmagazines he had brought under his arm. "They gave me another address\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I have chust gome here," said Lindau. "Idt is not very coy, Neigh?"\r\n\r\n"It might be gayer," March admitted, with a smile. "Still," he added,\r\nsoberly, "a good many people seem to live in this part of the town.\r\nApparently they die here, too, Lindau. There is crape on your outside\r\ndoor. I didn\'t know but it was for you."\r\n\r\n"Nodt this time," said Lindau, in the same humor. "Berhaps some other\r\ntime. We geep the ondertakers bratty puzy down here."\r\n\r\n"Well," said March, "undertakers must live, even if the rest of us have\r\nto die to let them." Lindau laughed, and March went on: "But I\'m glad it\r\nisn\'t your funeral, Lindau. And you say you\'re not sick, and so I don\'t\r\nsee why we shouldn\'t come to business."\r\n\r\n"Pusiness?" Lindau lifted his eyebrows. "You gome on pusiness?"\r\n\r\n"And pleasure combined," said March, and he went on to explain the\r\nservice he desired at Lindau\'s hands.\r\n\r\nThe old man listened with serious attention, and with assenting nods that\r\nculminated in a spoken expression of his willingness to undertake the\r\ntranslations. March waited with a sort of mechanical expectation of his\r\ngratitude for the work put in his way, but nothing of the kind came from\r\nLindau, and March was left to say, "Well, everything is understood, then;\r\nand I don\'t know that I need add that if you ever want any little advance\r\non the work--"\r\n\r\n"I will ask you," said Lindau, quietly, "and I thank you for that. But I\r\ncan wait; I ton\'t needt any money just at bresent." As if he saw some\r\nappeal for greater frankness in March\'s eye, he went on: "I tidn\'t gome\r\nhere begause I was too boor to lif anywhere else, and I ton\'t stay in\r\npedt begause I couldn\'t haf a fire to geep warm if I wanted it. I\'m nodt\r\nzo padt off as Marmontel when he went to Paris. I\'m a lidtle loaxurious,\r\nthat is all. If I stay in pedt it\'s zo I can fling money away on\r\nsomethings else. Heigh?"\r\n\r\n"But what are you living here for, Lindau?" March smiled at the irony\r\nlurking in Lindau\'s words.\r\n\r\n"Well, you zee, I foundt I was begoming a lidtle too moch of an\r\naristograt. I hadt a room oap in Creenvidge Willage, among dose pig pugs\r\nover on the West Side, and I foundt"--Liudau\'s voice lost its jesting\r\nquality, and his face darkened--"that I was beginning to forget the\r\nboor!"\r\n\r\n"I should have thought," said March, with impartial interest, "that you\r\nmight have seen poverty enough, now and then, in Greenwich Village to\r\nremind you of its existence."\r\n\r\n"Nodt like here," said Lindau. "Andt you must zee it all the dtime--zee\r\nit, hear it, smell it, dtaste it--or you forget it. That is what I gome\r\nhere for. I was begoming a ploated aristograt. I thought I was nodt like\r\nthese beople down here, when I gome down once to look aroundt; I thought\r\nI must be somethings else, and zo I zaid I better take myself in time,\r\nand I gome here among my brothers--the becears and the thiefs!" A noise\r\nmade itself heard in the next room, as if the door were furtively opened,\r\nand a faint sound of tiptoeing and of hands clawing on a table.\r\n\r\n"Thiefs!" Lindau repeated, with a shout. "Lidtle thiefs, that gabture\r\nyour breakfast. Ah! ha! ha!" A wild scurrying of feet, joyous cries and\r\ntittering, and a slamming door followed upon his explosion, and he\r\nresumed in the silence: "Idt is the children cot pack from school. They\r\ngome and steal what I leaf there on my daple. Idt\'s one of our lidtle\r\nchokes; we onderstand one another; that\'s all righdt. Once the gobbler in\r\nthe other room there he used to chase \'em; he couldn\'t onderstand their\r\nlidtle tricks. Now dot goppler\'s teadt, and he ton\'t chase \'em any more.\r\nHe was a Bohemian. Gindt of grazy, I cuess."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a sociable existence," March suggested. "But perhaps if you\r\nlet them have the things without stealing--"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, no! Most nodt mage them too gonceitedt. They mostn\'t go and feel\r\nthemselfs petter than those boor millionairss that hadt to steal their\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\nMarch smiled indulgently at his old friend\'s violence. "Oh, there are\r\nfagots and fagots, you know, Lindau; perhaps not all the millionaires are\r\nso guilty."\r\n\r\n"Let us speak German!" cried Lindau, in his own tongue, pushing his book\r\naside, and thrusting his skullcap back from his forehead. "How much money\r\ncan a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing some other man?"\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ll let me answer in English," said March, "I should say\r\nabout five thousand dollars a year. I name that figure because it\'s my\r\nexperience that I never could earn more; but the experience of other men\r\nmay be different, and if they tell me they can earn ten, or twenty, or\r\nfifty thousand a year, I\'m not prepared to say they can\'t do it."\r\n\r\nLindau hardly waited for his answer. "Not the most gifted man that ever\r\nlived, in the practice of any art or science, and paid at the highest\r\nrate that exceptional genius could justly demand from those who have\r\nworked for their money, could ever earn a million dollars. It is the\r\nlandlords and the merchant princes, the railroad kings and the coal\r\nbarons (the oppressors to whom you instinctively give the titles of\r\ntyrants)--it is these that make the millions, but no man earns them. What\r\nartist, what physician, what scientist, what poet was ever a\r\nmillionaire?"\r\n\r\n"I can only think of the poet Rogers," said March, amused by Lindau\'s\r\ntirade. "But he was as exceptional as the other Rogers, the martyr, who\r\ndied with warm feet." Lindau had apparently not understood his joke, and\r\nhe went on, with the American ease of mind about everything: "But you\r\nmust allow, Lindau, that some of those fellows don\'t do so badly with\r\ntheir guilty gains. Some of them give work to armies of poor people--"\r\n\r\nLindau furiously interrupted: "Yes, when they have gathered their\r\nmillions together from the hunger and cold and nakedness and ruin and\r\ndespair of hundreds of thousands of other men, they \'give work\' to the\r\npoor! They give work! They allow their helpless brothers to earn enough\r\nto keep life in them! They give work! Who is it gives toil, and where\r\nwill your rich men be when once the poor shall refuse to give toil? Why,\r\nyou have come to give me work!"\r\n\r\nMarch laughed outright. "Well, I\'m not a millionaire, anyway, Lindau, and\r\nI hope you won\'t make an example of me by refusing to give toil. I dare\r\nsay the millionaires deserve it, but I\'d rather they wouldn\'t suffer in\r\nmy person."\r\n\r\n"No," returned the old man, mildly relaxing the fierce glare he had bent\r\nupon March. "No man deserves to suffer at the hands of another. I lose\r\nmyself when I think of the injustice in the world. But I must not forget\r\nthat I am like the worst of them."\r\n\r\n"You might go up Fifth Avenue and live among the rich awhile, when you\'re\r\nin danger of that," suggested March. "At any rate," he added, by an\r\nimpulse which he knew he could not justify to his wife, "I wish you\'d\r\ncome some day and lunch with their emissary. I\'ve been telling Mrs. March\r\nabout you, and I want her and the children to see you. Come over with\r\nthese things and report." He put his hand on the magazines as he rose.\r\n\r\n"I will come," said Lindau, gently.\r\n\r\n"Shall I give you your book?" asked March.\r\n\r\n"No; I gidt oap bretty soon."\r\n\r\n"And--and--can you dress yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I vhistle, and one of those lidtle fellowss comess. We haf to dake gare\r\nof one another in a blace like this. Idt iss nodt like the worldt," said\r\nLindau, gloomily.\r\n\r\nMarch thought he ought to cheer him up. "Oh, it isn\'t such a bad world,\r\nLindau! After all, the average of millionaires is small in it." He added,\r\n"And I don\'t believe there\'s an American living that could look at that\r\narm of yours and not wish to lend you a hand for the one you gave us\r\nall." March felt this to be a fine turn, and his voice trembled slightly\r\nin saying it.\r\n\r\nLindau smiled grimly. "You think zo? I wouldn\'t moch like to drost \'em.\r\nI\'ve driedt idt too often." He began to speak German again fiercely:\r\n"Besides, they owe me nothing. Do you think I knowingly gave my hand to\r\nsave this oligarchy of traders and tricksters, this aristocracy of\r\nrailroad wreckers and stock gamblers and mine-slave drivers and mill-serf\r\nowners? No; I gave it to the slave; the slave--ha! ha! ha!--whom I helped\r\nto unshackle to the common liberty of hunger and cold. And you think I\r\nwould be the beneficiary of such a state of things?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear you talk so, Lindau," said March; "very sorry." He\r\nstopped with a look of pain, and rose to go. Lindau suddenly broke into a\r\nlaugh and into English.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, it is only dalk, Passil, and it toes me goodt. My parg is\r\nworse than my pidte, I cuess. I pring these things roundt bretty soon.\r\nGood-bye, Passil, my tear poy. Auf wiedersehen!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nMarch went away thinking of what Lindau had said, but not for the\r\nimpersonal significance of his words so much as for the light they cast\r\nupon Lindau himself. He thought the words violent enough, but in\r\nconnection with what he remembered of the cheery, poetic, hopeful\r\nidealist, they were even more curious than lamentable. In his own life of\r\ncomfortable reverie he had never heard any one talk so before, but he had\r\nread something of the kind now and then in blatant labor newspapers which\r\nhe had accidentally fallen in with, and once at a strikers\' meeting he\r\nhad heard rich people denounced with the same frenzy. He had made his own\r\nreflections upon the tastelessness of the rhetoric, and the obvious\r\nbuncombe of the motive, and he had not taken the matter seriously.\r\n\r\nHe could not doubt Lindau\'s sincerity, and he wondered how he came to\r\nthat way of thinking. From his experience of himself he accounted for a\r\nprevailing literary quality in it; he decided it to be from Lindau\'s\r\nreading and feeling rather than his reflection. That was the notion he\r\nformed of some things he had met with in Ruskin to much the same effect;\r\nhe regarded them with amusement as the chimeras of a rhetorician run away\r\nwith by his phrases.\r\n\r\nBut as to Lindau, the chief thing in his mind was a conception of the\r\ndroll irony of a situation in which so fervid a hater of millionaires\r\nshould be working, indirectly at least, for the prosperity of a man like\r\nDryfoos, who, as March understood, had got his money together out of\r\nevery gambler\'s chance in speculation, and all a schemer\'s thrift from\r\nthe error and need of others. The situation was not more incongruous,\r\nhowever, than all the rest of the \'Every Other Week\' affair. It seemed to\r\nhim that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to its\r\nexistence, and as time went on, and the day drew near for the issue of\r\nthe first number, the sense of this intensified till the whole lost at\r\nmoments the quality of a waking fact, and came to be rather a fantastic\r\nfiction of sleep.\r\n\r\nYet the heterogeneous forces did co-operate to a reality which March\r\ncould not deny, at least in their presence, and the first number was\r\nrepresentative of all their nebulous intentions in a tangible form. As a\r\nresult, it was so respectable that March began to respect these\r\nintentions, began to respect himself for combining and embodying them in\r\nthe volume which appealed to him with a novel fascination, when the first\r\nadvance copy was laid upon his desk. Every detail of it was tiresomely\r\nfamiliar already, but the whole had a fresh interest now. He now saw how\r\nextremely fit and effective Miss Leighton\'s decorative design for the\r\ncover was, printed in black and brick-red on the delicate gray tone of\r\nthe paper. It was at once attractive and refined, and he credited Beaton\r\nwith quite all he merited in working it over to the actual shape. The\r\ntouch and the taste of the art editor were present throughout the number.\r\nAs Fulkerson said, Beaton had caught on with the delicacy of a\r\nhumming-bird and the tenacity of a bulldog to the virtues of their\r\nillustrative process, and had worked it for all it was worth. There were\r\nseven papers in the number, and a poem on the last page of the cover, and\r\nhe had found some graphic comment for each. It was a larger proportion\r\nthan would afterward be allowed, but for once in a way it was allowed.\r\nFulkerson said they could not expect to get their money back on that\r\nfirst number, anyway. Seven of the illustrations were Beaton\'s; two or\r\nthree he got from practised hands; the rest were the work of unknown\r\npeople which he had suggested, and then related and adapted with\r\nunfailing ingenuity to the different papers. He handled the illustrations\r\nwith such sympathy as not to destroy their individual quality, and that\r\nindefinable charm which comes from good amateur work in whatever art. He\r\nrescued them from their weaknesses and errors, while he left in them the\r\nevidence of the pleasure with which a clever young man, or a sensitive\r\ngirl, or a refined woman had done them. Inevitably from his manipulation,\r\nhowever, the art of the number acquired homogeneity, and there was\r\nnothing casual in its appearance. The result, March eagerly owned, was\r\nbetter than the literary result, and he foresaw that the number would be\r\nsold and praised chiefly for its pictures. Yet he was not ashamed of the\r\nliterature, and he indulged his admiration of it the more freely because\r\nhe had not only not written it, but in a way had not edited it. To be\r\nsure, he had chosen all the material, but he had not voluntarily put it\r\nall together for that number; it had largely put itself together, as\r\nevery number of every magazine does, and as it seems more and more to do,\r\nin the experience of every editor. There had to be, of course, a story,\r\nand then a sketch of travel. There was a literary essay and a social\r\nessay; there was a dramatic trifle, very gay, very light; there was a\r\ndashing criticism on the new pictures, the new plays, the new books, the\r\nnew fashions; and then there was the translation of a bit of vivid\r\nRussian realism, which the editor owed to Lindau\'s exploration of the\r\nforeign periodicals left with him; Lindau was himself a romanticist of\r\nthe Victor Hugo sort, but he said this fragment of Dostoyevski was good\r\nof its kind. The poem was a bit of society verse, with a backward look\r\ninto simpler and wholesomer experiences.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was extremely proud of the number; but he said it was too\r\ngood--too good from every point of view. The cover was too good, and the\r\npaper was too good, and that device of rough edges, which got over the\r\nobjection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect, was a\r\nthing that he trembled for, though he rejoiced in it as a stroke of the\r\nhighest genius. It had come from Beaton at the last moment, as a\r\ncompromise, when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves and\r\nthe unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide.\r\nFulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees, as he\r\nsaid, in abject gratitude at Beaton\'s feet, though he had his qualms, his\r\nquestions; and he declared that Beaton was the most inspired ass since\r\nBalaam\'s. "We\'re all asses, of course," he admitted, in semi-apology to\r\nMarch; "but we\'re no such asses as Beaton." He said that if the tasteful\r\ndecorativeness of the thing did not kill it with the public outright, its\r\nliterary excellence would give it the finishing stroke. Perhaps that\r\nmight be overlooked in the impression of novelty which a first number\r\nwould give, but it must never happen again. He implored March to promise\r\nthat it should never happen again; he said their only hope was in the\r\nimmediate cheapening of the whole affair. It was bad enough to give the\r\npublic too much quantity for their money, but to throw in such quality as\r\nthat was simply ruinous; it must be stopped. These were the expressions\r\nof his intimate moods; every front that he presented to the public wore a\r\nglow of lofty, of devout exultation. His pride in the number gushed out\r\nin fresh bursts of rhetoric to every one whom he could get to talk with\r\nhim about it. He worked the personal kindliness of the press to the\r\nutmost. He did not mind making himself ridiculous or becoming a joke in\r\nthe good cause, as he called it. He joined in the applause when a\r\nhumorist at the club feigned to drop dead from his chair at Fulkerson\'s\r\nintroduction of the topic, and he went on talking that first number into\r\nthe surviving spectators. He stood treat upon all occasions, and he\r\nlunched attaches of the press at all hours. He especially befriended the\r\ncorrespondents of the newspapers of other cities, for, as he explained to\r\nMarch, those fellows could give him any amount of advertising simply as\r\nliterary gossip. Many of the fellows were ladies who could not be so\r\nsummarily asked out to lunch, but Fulkerson\'s ingenuity was equal to\r\nevery exigency, and he contrived somehow to make each of these feel that\r\nshe had been possessed of exclusive information. There was a moment when\r\nMarch conjectured a willingness in Fulkerson to work Mrs. March into the\r\nadvertising department, by means of a tea to these ladies and their\r\nfriends which she should administer in his apartment, but he did not\r\nencourage Fulkerson to be explicit, and the moment passed. Afterward,\r\nwhen he told his wife about it, he was astonished to find that she would\r\nnot have minded doing it for Fulkerson, and he experienced another proof\r\nof the bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions, and of the\r\npersonal favor which Fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex. This\r\nalone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondents\r\nto write about the first number, but March accused him of sending it to\r\ntheir addresses with boxes of Jacqueminot roses and Huyler candy.\r\n\r\nFulkerson let him enjoy his joke. He said that he would do that or\r\nanything else for the good cause, short of marrying the whole circle of\r\nfemale correspondents.\r\n\r\nMarch was inclined to hope that if the first number had been made too\r\ngood for the country at large, the more enlightened taste of metropolitan\r\njournalism would invite a compensating favor for it in New York. But\r\nfirst Fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong. In spite of the\r\nquality of the magazine, and in spite of the kindness which so many\r\nnewspaper men felt for Fulkerson, the notices in the New York papers\r\nseemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor. A merit in\r\nthe work was acknowledged, and certain defects in it for which March had\r\ntrembled were ignored; but the critics astonished him by selecting for\r\ncensure points which he was either proud of or had never noticed; which\r\nbeing now brought to his notice he still could not feel were faults. He\r\nowned to Fulkerson that if they had said so and so against it, he could\r\nhave agreed with them, but that to say thus and so was preposterous; and\r\nthat if the advertising had not been adjusted with such generous\r\nrecognition of the claims of the different papers, he should have known\r\nthe counting-room was at the bottom of it. As it was, he could only\r\nattribute it to perversity or stupidity. It was certainly stupid to\r\ncondemn a magazine novelty like \'Every Other Week\' for being novel; and\r\nto augur that if it failed, it would fail through its departure from the\r\nlines on which all the other prosperous magazines had been built, was in\r\nthe last degree perverse, and it looked malicious. The fact that it was\r\nneither exactly a book nor a magazine ought to be for it and not against\r\nit, since it would invade no other field; it would prosper on no ground\r\nbut its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nThe more March thought of the injustice of the New York press (which had\r\nnot, however, attacked the literary quality of the number) the more\r\nbitterly he resented it; and his wife\'s indignation superheated his own.\r\n\'Every Other Week\' had become a very personal affair with the whole\r\nfamily; the children shared their parents\' disgust; Belle was outspoken\r\nin, her denunciations of a venal press. Mrs. March saw nothing but ruin\r\nahead, and began tacitly to plan a retreat to Boston, and an\r\nestablishment retrenched to the basis of two thousand a year. She shed\r\nsome secret tears in anticipation of the privations which this must\r\ninvolve; but when Fulkerson came to see March rather late the night of\r\nthe publication day, she nobly told him that if the worst came to the\r\nworst she could only have the kindliest feeling toward him, and should\r\nnot regard him as in the slightest degree responsible.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hold on, hold on!" he protested. "You don\'t think we\'ve made a\r\nfailure, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course," she faltered, while March remained gloomily silent.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess we\'ll wait for the official count, first. Even New York\r\nhasn\'t gone against us, and I guess there\'s a majority coming down to\r\nHarlem River that could sweep everything before it, anyway."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Fulkerson?" March demanded, sternly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing! Only, the \'News Company\' has ordered ten thousand now; and\r\nyou know we had to give them the first twenty on commission."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" March repeated; his wife held her breath.\r\n\r\n"I mean that the first number is a booming success already, and that it\'s\r\ngoing to a hundred thousand before it stops. That unanimity and variety\r\nof censure in the morning papers, combined with the attractiveness of the\r\nthing itself, has cleared every stand in the city, and now if the favor\r\nof the country press doesn\'t turn the tide against us, our fortune\'s\r\nmade." The Marches remained dumb. "Why, look here! Didn\'t I tell you\r\nthose criticisms would be the making of us, when they first began to turn\r\nyou blue this morning, March?"\r\n\r\n"He came home to lunch perfectly sick," said Mrs. March; "and I wouldn\'t\r\nlet him go back again."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you so?" Fulkerson persisted.\r\n\r\nMarch could not remember that he had, or that he had been anything but\r\nincoherently and hysterically jocose over the papers, but he said, "Yes,\r\nyes--I think so."\r\n\r\n"I knew it from the start," said Fulkerson. "The only other person who\r\ntook those criticisms in the right spirit was Mother Dryfoos--I\'ve just\r\nbeen bolstering up the Dryfoos family. She had them read to her by Mrs.\r\nMandel, and she understood them to be all the most flattering prophecies\r\nof success. Well, I didn\'t read between the lines to that extent, quite;\r\nbut I saw that they were going to help us, if there was anything in us,\r\nmore than anything that could have been done. And there was something in\r\nus! I tell you, March, that seven-shooting self-cocking donkey of a\r\nBeaton has given us the greatest start! He\'s caught on like a mouse. He\'s\r\nmade the thing awfully chic; it\'s jimmy; there\'s lots of dog about it.\r\nHe\'s managed that process so that the illustrations look as expensive as\r\nfirst-class wood-cuts, and they\'re cheaper than chromos. He\'s put style\r\ninto the whole thing."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said March, with eager meekness, "it\'s Beaton that\'s done it."\r\n\r\nFulkerson read jealousy of Beaton in Mrs. March\'s face. "Beaton has given\r\nus the start because his work appeals to the eye. There\'s no denying that\r\nthe pictures have sold this first number; but I expect the literature of\r\nthis first number to sell the pictures of the second. I\'ve been reading\r\nit all over, nearly, since I found how the cat was jumping; I was anxious\r\nabout it, and I tell you, old man, it\'s good. Yes, sir! I was afraid\r\nmaybe you had got it too good, with that Boston refinement of yours; but\r\nI reckon you haven\'t. I\'ll risk it. I don\'t see how you got so much\r\nvariety into so few things, and all of them palpitant, all of \'em on the\r\nkeen jump with actuality."\r\n\r\nThe mixture of American slang with the jargon of European criticism in\r\nFulkerson\'s talk made March smile, but his wife did not seem to notice it\r\nin her exultation. "That is just what I say," she broke in. "It\'s\r\nperfectly wonderful. I never was anxious about it a moment, except, as\r\nyou say, Mr. Fulkerson, I was afraid it might be too good."\r\n\r\nThey went on in an antiphony of praise till March said: "Really, I don\'t\r\nsee what\'s left me but to strike for higher wages. I perceive that I\'m\r\nindispensable."\r\n\r\n"Why, old man, you\'re coming in on the divvy, you know," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and when Fulkerson was gone, Mrs. March asked her\r\nhusband what a divvy was.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a chicken before it\'s hatched."\r\n\r\n"No! Truly?"\r\n\r\nHe explained, and she began to spend the divvy.\r\n\r\nAt Mrs. Leighton\'s Fulkerson gave Alma all the honor of the success; he\r\ntold her mother that the girl\'s design for the cover had sold every\r\nnumber, and Mrs. Leighton believed him.\r\n\r\n"Well, Ah think Ah maght have some of the glory," Miss Woodburn pouted.\r\n"Where am Ah comin\' in?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re coming in on the cover of the next number," said Fulkerson.\r\n"We\'re going to have your face there; Miss Leighton\'s going to sketch it\r\nin." He said this reckless of the fact that he had already shown them the\r\ndesign of the second number, which was Beaton\'s weird bit of gas-country\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n"Ah don\'t see why you don\'t wrahte the fiction for your magazine, Mr.\r\nFulkerson," said the girl.\r\n\r\nThis served to remind Fulkerson of something. He turned to her father.\r\n"I\'ll tell you what, Colonel Woodburn, I want Mr. March to see some\r\nchapters of that book of yours. I\'ve been talking to him about it."\r\n\r\n"I do not think it would add to the popularity of your periodical, sir,"\r\nsaid the Colonel, with a stately pleasure in being asked. "My views of a\r\ncivilization based upon responsible slavery would hardly be acceptable to\r\nyour commercialized society."\r\n\r\n"Well, not as a practical thing, of course," Fulkerson admitted. "But as\r\nsomething retrospective, speculative, I believe it would make a hit.\r\nThere\'s so much going on now about social questions; I guess people would\r\nlike to read it."\r\n\r\n"I do not know that my work is intended to amuse people," said the\r\nColonel, with some state.\r\n\r\n"Mah goodness! Ah only wish it WAS, then," said his daughter; and she\r\nadded: "Yes, Mr. Fulkerson, the Colonel will be very glad to submit\r\npo\'tions of his woak to yo\' edito\'. We want to have some of the honaw.\r\nPerhaps we can say we helped to stop yo\' magazine, if we didn\'t help to\r\nstawt it."\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at her boldness, and Fulkerson said: "It\'ll take a good\r\ndeal more than that to stop \'Every Other Week\'. The Colonel\'s whole book\r\ncouldn\'t do it." Then he looked unhappy, for Colonel Woodburn did not\r\nseem to enjoy his reassuring words; but Miss Woodburn came to his rescue.\r\n"You maght illustrate it with the po\'trait of the awthoris daughtaw, if\r\nit\'s too late for the covah."\r\n\r\n"Going to have that in every number, Miss Woodburn!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mah goodness!" she said, with mock humility.\r\n\r\nAlma sat looking at her piquant head, black, unconsciously outlined\r\nagainst the lamp, as she sat working by the table. "Just keep still a\r\nmoment!"\r\n\r\nShe got her sketch-block and pencils, and began to draw; Fulkerson tilted\r\nhimself forward and looked over her shoulder; he smiled outwardly;\r\ninwardly he was divided between admiration of Miss Woodburn\'s arch beauty\r\nand appreciation of the skill which reproduced it; at the same time he\r\nwas trying to remember whether March had authorized him to go so far as\r\nto ask for a sight of Colonel Woodburn\'s manuscript. He felt that he had\r\ntrenched upon March\'s province, and he framed one apology to the editor\r\nfor bringing him the manuscript, and another to the author for bringing\r\nit back.\r\n\r\n"Most Ah hold raght still like it was a photograph?" asked Miss Woodburn.\r\n"Can Ah toak?"\r\n\r\n"Talk all you want," said Alma, squinting her eyes. "And you needn\'t be\r\neither adamantine, nor yet--wooden."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ho\' very good of you! Well, if Ah can toak--go on, Mr. Fulkerson!"\r\n\r\n"Me talk? I can\'t breathe till this thing is done!" sighed Fulkerson; at\r\nthat point of his mental drama the Colonel was behaving rustily about the\r\nreturn of his manuscript, and he felt that he was looking his last on\r\nMiss Woodburn\'s profile.\r\n\r\n"Is she getting it raght?" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which is which," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ah hope Ah shall! Ah don\'t want to go round feelin\' like a sheet of\r\npapah half the time."\r\n\r\n"You could rattle on, just the same," suggested Alma.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now! Jost listen to that, Mr. Fulkerson. Do you call that any way to\r\ntoak to people?"\r\n\r\n"You might know which you were by the color," Fulkerson began, and then\r\nhe broke off from the personal consideration with a business inspiration,\r\nand smacked himself on the knee, "We could print it in color!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton gathered up her sewing and held it with both hands in her\r\nlap, while she came round, and looked critically at the sketch and the\r\nmodel over her glasses. "It\'s very good, Alma," she said.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn remained restively on his side of the table. "Of course,\r\nMr. Fulkerson, you were jesting, sir, when you spoke of printing a sketch\r\nof my daughter."\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know--If you object--?\r\n\r\n"I do, sir--decidedly," said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n"Then that settles it, of course,--I only meant--"\r\n\r\n"Indeed it doesn\'t!" cried the girl. "Who\'s to know who it\'s from? Ah\'m\r\njost set on havin\' it printed! Ah\'m going to appear as the head of\r\nSlavery--in opposition to the head of Liberty."\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be a revolution inside of forty-eight hours, and we\'ll have the\r\nColonel\'s system going wherever a copy of \'Every Other Week\' circulates,"\r\nsaid Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"This sketch belongs to me," Alma interposed. "I\'m not going to let it be\r\nprinted."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mah goodness!" said Miss Woodburn, laughing good-humoredly. "That\'s\r\nbecose you were brought up to hate slavery."\r\n\r\n"I should like Mr. Beaton to see it," said Mrs. Leighton, in a sort of\r\nabsent tone. She added, to Fulkerson: "I rather expected he might be in\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he comes we\'ll leave it to Beaton," Fulkerson said, with relief\r\nin the solution, and an anxious glance at the Colonel, across the table,\r\nto see how he took that form of the joke. Miss Woodburn intercepted his\r\nglance and laughed, and Fulkerson laughed, too, but rather forlornly.\r\n\r\nAlma set her lips primly and turned her head first on one side and then\r\non the other to look at the sketch. "I don\'t think we\'ll leave it to Mr.\r\nBeaton, even if he comes."\r\n\r\n"We left the other design for the cover to Beaton," Fulkerson insinuated.\r\n"I guess you needn\'t be afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"Is it a question of my being afraid?" Alma asked; she seemed coolly\r\nintent on her drawing.\r\n\r\n"Miss Leighton thinks he ought to be afraid of her," Miss Woodburn\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a question of his courage, then?" said Alma.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think there are many young ladies that Beaton\'s afraid\r\nof," said Fulkerson, giving himself the respite of this purely random\r\nremark, while he interrogated the faces of Mrs. Leighton and Colonel\r\nWoodburn for some light upon the tendency of their daughters\' words.\r\n\r\nHe was not helped by Mrs. Leighton\'s saying, with a certain anxiety, "I\r\ndon\'t know what you mean, Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re as much in the dark as I am myself, then," said Fulkerson.\r\n"I suppose I meant that Beaton is rather--a--favorite, you know. The\r\nwomen like him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton sighed, and Colonel Woodburn rose and left the room.\r\n\r\nIn the silence that followed, Fulkerson looked from one lady to the other\r\nwith dismay. "I seem to have put my foot in it, somehow," he suggested,\r\nand Miss Woodburn gave a cry of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Poo\' Mr. Fulkerson! Poo\' Mr. Fulkerson! Papa thoat you wanted him to\r\ngo."\r\n\r\n"Wanted him to go?" repeated Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"We always mention Mr. Beaton when we want to get rid of papa."\r\n\r\n"Well, it seems to me that I have noticed that he didn\'t take much\r\ninterest in Beaton, as a general topic. But I don\'t know that I ever saw\r\nit drive him out of the room before!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he isn\'t always so bad," said Miss Woodburn. "But it was a case of\r\nhate at first sight, and it seems to be growin\' on papa."\r\n\r\n"Well, I can understand that," said Fulkerson. "The impulse to destroy\r\nBeaton is something that everybody has to struggle against at the start."\r\n\r\n"I must say, Mr. Fulkerson," said Mrs. Leighton, in the tremor through\r\nwhich she nerved herself to differ openly with any one she liked, "I\r\nnever had to struggle with anything of the kind, in regard to Mr. Beaton.\r\nHe has always been most respectful and--and--considerate, with me,\r\nwhatever he has been with others."\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, Mrs. Leighton!" Fulkerson came back in a soothing tone.\r\n"But you see you\'re the rule that proves the exception. I was speaking of\r\nthe way men felt about Beaton. It\'s different with ladies; I just said\r\nso."\r\n\r\n"Is it always different?" Alma asked, lifting her head and her hand from\r\nher drawing, and staring at it absently.\r\n\r\nFulkerson pushed both his hands through his whiskers. "Look here! Look\r\nhere!" he said. "Won\'t somebody start some other subject? We haven\'t had\r\nthe weather up yet, have we? Or the opera? What is the matter with a few\r\nremarks about politics?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Ah thoat you lahked to toak about the staff of yo\' magazine," said\r\nMiss Woodburn.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do!" said Fulkerson. "But not always about the same member of it.\r\nHe gets monotonous, when he doesn\'t get complicated. I\'ve just come round\r\nfrom the Marches\'," he added, to Mrs. Leighton.\r\n\r\n"I suppose they\'ve got thoroughly settled in their apartment by this\r\ntime." Mrs. Leighton said something like this whenever the Marches were\r\nmentioned. At the bottom of her heart she had not forgiven them for not\r\ntaking her rooms; she had liked their looks so much; and she was always\r\nhoping that they were uncomfortable or dissatisfied; she could not help\r\nwanting them punished a little.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; as much as they ever will be," Fulkerson answered. "The\r\nBoston style is pretty different, you know; and the Marches are\r\nold-fashioned folks, and I reckon they never went in much for bric-a-brac.\r\nThey\'ve put away nine or ten barrels of dragon candlesticks, but they\r\nkeep finding new ones."\r\n\r\n"Their landlady has just joined our class," said Alma. "Isn\'t her name\r\nGreen? She happened to see my copy of \'Every Other Week\', and said she\r\nknew the editor; and told me."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a little world," said Fulkerson. "You seem to be touching\r\nelbows with everybody. Just think of your having had our head translator\r\nfor a model."\r\n\r\n"Ah think that your whole publication revolves aroand the Leighton\r\nfamily," said Miss Woodburn.\r\n\r\n"That\'s pretty much so," Fulkerson admitted. "Anyhow, the publisher seems\r\ndisposed to do so."\r\n\r\n"Are you the publisher? I thought it was Mr. Dryfoos," said Alma.\r\n\r\n"It is."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\nThe tone and the word gave Fulkerson a discomfort which he promptly\r\nconfessed. "Missed again."\r\n\r\nThe girls laughed, and he regained something of his lost spirits, and\r\nsmiled upon their gayety, which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn asked, "And is Mr. Dryfoos senio\' anything like ouah Mr.\r\nDryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s jost as exemplary?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; in his way."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ah wish Ah could see all those pinks of puffection togethah,\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Why, look here! I\'ve been thinking I\'d celebrate a little, when the old\r\ngentleman gets back. Have a little supper--something of that kind. How\r\nwould you like to let me have your parlors for it, Mrs. Leighton? You\r\nladies could stand on the stairs, and have a peep at us, in the bunch."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mah! What a privilege! And will Miss Alma be there, with the othah\r\ncontributors? Ah shall jost expah of envy!"\r\n\r\n"She won\'t be there in person," said Fulkerson, "but she\'ll be\r\nrepresented by the head of the art department."\r\n\r\n"Mah goodness! And who\'ll the head of the publishing department\r\nrepresent?"\r\n\r\n"He can represent you," said Alma.\r\n\r\n"Well, Ah want to be represented, someho\'."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have the banquet the night before you appear on the cover of our\r\nfourth number," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"Ah thoat that was doubly fo\'bidden," said Miss Woodburn. "By the stern\r\nparent and the envious awtust."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get Beaton to get round them, somehow. I guess we can trust him to\r\nmanage that."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton sighed her resentment of the implication.\r\n\r\n"I always feel that Mr. Beaton doesn\'t do himself justice," she began.\r\n\r\nFulkerson could not forego the chance of a joke. "Well, maybe he would\r\nrather temper justice with mercy in a case like his." This made both the\r\nyounger ladies laugh. "I judge this is my chance to get off with my\r\nlife," he added, and he rose as he spoke. "Mrs. Leighton, I am about the\r\nonly man of my sex who doesn\'t thirst for Beaton\'s blood most of the\r\ntime. But I know him and I don\'t. He\'s more kinds of a good fellow than\r\npeople generally understand. He doesn\'t wear his heart upon his\r\nsleeve--not his ulster sleeve, anyway. You can always count me on your\r\nside when it\'s a question of finding Beaton not guilty if he\'ll leave the\r\nState."\r\n\r\nAlma set her drawing against the wall, in rising to say goodnight to\r\nFulkerson. He bent over on his stick to look at it. "Well, it\'s\r\nbeautiful," he sighed, with unconscious sincerity.\r\n\r\nAlma made him a courtesy of mock modesty. "Thanks to Miss Woodburn!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! All she had to do was simply to stay put."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think Ah might have improved it if Ah had looked better?" the\r\ngirl asked, gravely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you couldn\'t!" said Fulkerson, and he went off triumphant in their\r\napplause and their cries of "Which? which?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton sank deep into an accusing gloom when at last she found\r\nherself alone with her daughter. "I don\'t know what you are thinking\r\nabout, Alma Leighton. If you don\'t like Mr. Beaton--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t? You know better than that. You know that, you did care for\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s a very different thing. That\'s a thing that can be got over."\r\n\r\n"Got over!" repeated Mrs. Leighton, aghast.\r\n\r\n"Of course, it can! Don\'t be romantic, mamma. People get over dozens of\r\nsuch fancies. They even marry for love two or three times."\r\n\r\n"Never!" cried her mother, doing her best to feel shocked; and at last\r\nlooking it.\r\n\r\nHer looking it had no effect upon Alma. "You can easily get over caring\r\nfor people; but you can\'t get over liking them--if you like them because\r\nthey are sweet and good. That\'s what lasts. I was a simple goose, and he\r\nimposed upon me because he was a sophisticated goose. Now the case is\r\nreversed."\r\n\r\n"He does care for you, now. You can see it. Why do you encourage him to\r\ncome here?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said Alma. "I will tell him to keep away if you like. But\r\nwhether he comes or goes, it will be the same."\r\n\r\n"Not to him, Alma! He is in love with you!"\r\n\r\n"He has never said so."\r\n\r\n"And you would really let him say so, when you intend to refuse him?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t very well refuse him till he does say so."\r\n\r\nThis was undeniable. Mrs. Leighton could only demand, in an awful tone,\r\n"May I ask why--if you cared for him; and I know you care for him still\r\nyou will refuse him?"\r\n\r\nAlma laughed. "Because--because I\'m wedded to my Art, and I\'m not going\r\nto commit bigamy, whatever I do."\r\n\r\n"Alma!"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, because I don\'t like him--that is, I don\'t believe in him,\r\nand don\'t trust him. He\'s fascinating, but he\'s false and he\'s fickle. He\r\ncan\'t help it, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"And you are perfectly hard. Is it possible that you were actually\r\npleased to have Mr. Fulkerson tease you about Mr. Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, good-night, now, mamma! This is becoming personal."\r\n\r\n\r\nPG EDITOR\'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Artists never do anything like other people\r\n    Ballast of her instinctive despondency\r\n    Clinging persistence of such natures\r\n    Dividend: It\'s a chicken before it\'s hatched\r\n    Gayety, which lasted beyond any apparent reason for it\r\n    Hopeful recklessness\r\n    How much can a man honestly earn without wronging or oppressing\r\n    I cannot endure this--this hopefulness of yours\r\n    If you dread harm enough it is less likely to happen\r\n    It must be your despair that helps you to bear up\r\n    Marry for love two or three times\r\n    No man deserves to suffer at the hands of another\r\n    Patience with mediocrity putting on the style of genius\r\n    Person talks about taking lessons, as if they could learn it\r\n    Say when he is gone that the woman gets along better without him\r\n    Shouldn\'t ca\' fo\' the disgrace of bein\' poo\'--its inconvenience\r\n    Timidity of the elder in the presence of the younger man\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of a banquet to celebrate the initial success of \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' expanded in Fulkerson\'s fancy into a series. Instead of the\r\npublishing and editorial force, with certain of the more representative\r\nartists and authors sitting down to a modest supper in Mrs. Leighton\'s\r\nparlors, he conceived of a dinner at Delmonico\'s, with the principal\r\nliterary and artistic, people throughout the country as guests, and an\r\ninexhaustible hospitality to reporters and correspondents, from whom\r\nparagraphs, prophetic and historic, would flow weeks before and after the\r\nfirst of the series. He said the thing was a new departure in magazines;\r\nit amounted to something in literature as radical as the American\r\nRevolution in politics: it was the idea of self government in the arts;\r\nand it was this idea that had never yet been fully developed in regard to\r\nit. That was what must be done in the speeches at the dinner, and the\r\nspeeches must be reported. Then it would go like wildfire. He asked March\r\nwhether he thought Mr. Depew could be got to come; Mark Twain, he was\r\nsure, would come; he was a literary man. They ought to invite Mr. Evarts,\r\nand the Cardinal and the leading Protestant divines. His ambition stopped\r\nat nothing, nothing but the question of expense; there he had to wait the\r\nreturn of the elder Dryfoos from the West, and Dryfoos was still delayed\r\nat Moffitt, and Fulkerson openly confessed that he was afraid he would\r\nstay there till his own enthusiasm escaped in other activities, other\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was as little likely as possible to fall under a superstitious\r\nsubjection to another man; but March could not help seeing that in this\r\npossible measure Dryfoos was Fulkerson\'s fetish. He did not revere him,\r\nMarch decided, because it was not in Fulkerson\'s nature to revere\r\nanything; he could like and dislike, but he could not respect.\r\nApparently, however, Dryfoos daunted him somehow; and besides the homage\r\nwhich those who have not pay to those who have, Fulkerson rendered\r\nDryfoos the tribute of a feeling which March could only define as a sort\r\nof bewilderment. As well as March could make out, this feeling was evoked\r\nby the spectacle of Dryfoos\'s unfailing luck, which Fulkerson was fond of\r\ndazzling himself with. It perfectly consisted with a keen sense of\r\nwhatever was sordid and selfish in a man on whom his career must have had\r\nits inevitable effect. He liked to philosophize the case with March, to\r\nrecall Dryfoos as he was when he first met him still somewhat in the sap,\r\nat Moffitt, and to study the processes by which he imagined him to have\r\ndried into the hardened speculator, without even the pretence to any\r\nadvantage but his own in his ventures. He was aware of painting the\r\ncharacter too vividly, and he warned March not to accept it exactly in\r\nthose tints, but to subdue them and shade it for himself. He said that\r\nwhere his advantage was not concerned, there was ever so much good in\r\nDryfoos, and that if in some things he had grown inflexible, he had\r\nexpanded in others to the full measure of the vast scale on which he did\r\nbusiness. It had seemed a little odd to March that a man should put money\r\ninto such an enterprise as \'Every Other Week\' and go off about other\r\naffairs, not only without any sign of anxiety, but without any sort of\r\ninterest. But Fulkerson said that was the splendid side of Dryfoos. He\r\nhad a courage, a magnanimity, that was equal to the strain of any such\r\nuncertainty. He had faced the music once for all, when he asked Fulkerson\r\nwhat the thing would cost in the different degrees of potential failure;\r\nand then he had gone off, leaving everything to Fulkerson and the younger\r\nDryfoos, with the instruction simply to go ahead and not bother him about\r\nit. Fulkerson called that pretty tall for an old fellow who used to\r\nbewail the want of pigs and chickens to occupy his mind. He alleged it as\r\nanother proof of the versatility of the American mind, and of the\r\ngrandeur of institutions and opportunities that let every man grow to his\r\nfull size, so that any man in America could run the concern if necessary.\r\nHe believed that old Dryfoos could step into Bismarck\'s shoes and run the\r\nGerman Empire at ten days\' notice, or about as long as it would take him\r\nto go from New York to Berlin. But Bismarck would not know anything about\r\nDryfoos\'s plans till Dryfoos got ready to show his hand. Fulkerson\r\nhimself did not pretend to say what the old man had been up to since he\r\nwent West. He was at Moffitt first, and then he was at Chicago, and then\r\nhe had gone out to Denver to look after some mines he had out there, and\r\na railroad or two; and now he was at Moffitt again. He was supposed to be\r\nclosing up his affairs there, but nobody could say.\r\n\r\nFulkerson told March the morning after Dryfoos returned that he had not\r\nonly not pulled out at Moffitt, but had gone in deeper, ten times deeper\r\nthan ever. He was in a royal good-humor, Fulkerson reported, and was\r\ngoing to drop into the office on his way up from the Street (March\r\nunderstood Wall Street) that afternoon. He was tickled to death with\r\n\'Every Other Week\' so far as it had gone, and was anxious to pay his\r\nrespects to the editor.\r\n\r\nMarch accounted for some rhetoric in this, but let it flatter him, and\r\nprepared himself for a meeting about which he could see that Fulkerson\r\nwas only less nervous than he had shown himself about the public\r\nreception of the first number. It gave March a disagreeable feeling of\r\nbeing owned and of being about to be inspected by his proprietor; but he\r\nfell back upon such independence as he could find in the thought of those\r\ntwo thousand dollars of income beyond the caprice of his owner, and\r\nmaintained an outward serenity.\r\n\r\nHe was a little ashamed afterward of the resolution it had cost him to do\r\nso. It was not a question of Dryfoos\'s physical presence: that was rather\r\neffective than otherwise, and carried a suggestion of moneyed\r\nindifference to convention in the gray business suit of provincial cut,\r\nand the low, wide-brimmed hat of flexible black felt. He had a stick with\r\nan old-fashioned top of buckhorn worn smooth and bright by the palm of\r\nhis hand, which had not lost its character in fat, and which had a\r\nhistory of former work in its enlarged knuckles, though it was now as\r\nsoft as March\'s, and must once have been small even for a man of Mr.\r\nDryfoos\'s stature; he was below the average size. But what struck March\r\nwas the fact that Dryfoos seemed furtively conscious of being a country\r\nperson, and of being aware that in their meeting he was to be tried by\r\nother tests than those which would have availed him as a shrewd\r\nspeculator. He evidently had some curiosity about March, as the first of\r\nhis kind whom he had encountered; some such curiosity as the country\r\nschool trustee feels and tries to hide in the presence of the new\r\nschoolmaster. But the whole affair was, of course, on a higher plane; on\r\none side Dryfoos was much more a man of the world than March was, and he\r\nprobably divined this at once, and rested himself upon the fact in a\r\nmeasure. It seemed to be his preference that his son should introduce\r\nthem, for he came upstairs with Conrad, and they had fairly made\r\nacquaintance before Fulkerson joined them.\r\n\r\nConrad offered to leave them at once, but his father made him stay. "I\r\nreckon Mr. March and I haven\'t got anything so private to talk about that\r\nwe want to keep it from the other partners. Well, Mr. March, are you\r\ngetting used to New York yet? It takes a little time."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. But not so much time as most places. Everybody belongs more or\r\nless in New York; nobody has to belong here altogether."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so. You can try it, and go away if you don\'t like it a good\r\ndeal easier than you could from a smaller place. Wouldn\'t make so much\r\ntalk, would it?" He glanced at March with a jocose light in his shrewd\r\neyes. "That is the way I feel about it all the time: just visiting. Now,\r\nit wouldn\'t be that way in Boston, I reckon?"\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t keep on visiting there your whole life," said March.\r\n\r\nDryfoos laughed, showing his lower teeth in a way that was at once simple\r\nand fierce. "Mr. Fulkerson didn\'t hardly know as he could get you to\r\nleave. I suppose you got used to it there. I never been in your city."\r\n\r\n"I had got used to it; but it was hardly my city, except by marriage. My\r\nwife\'s a Bostonian."\r\n\r\n"She\'s been a little homesick here, then," said Dryfoos, with a smile of\r\nthe same quality as his laugh.\r\n\r\n"Less than I expected," said March. "Of course, she was very much\r\nattached to our old home."\r\n\r\n"I guess my wife won\'t ever get used to New York," said Dryfoos, and he\r\ndrew in his lower lip with a sharp sigh. "But my girls like it; they\'re\r\nyoung. You never been out our way yet, Mr. March? Out West?"\r\n\r\n"Well, only for the purpose of being born, and brought up. I used to live\r\nin Crawfordsville, and then Indianapolis."\r\n\r\n"Indianapolis is bound to be a great place," said Dryfoos. "I remember\r\nnow, Mr. Fulkerson told me you was from our State." He went on to brag of\r\nthe West, as if March were an Easterner and had to be convinced. "You\r\nought to see all that country. It\'s a great country."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said March, "I understand that." He expected the praise of the\r\ngreat West to lead up to some comment on \'Every Other Week\'; and there\r\nwas abundant suggestion of that topic in the manuscripts, proofs of\r\nletter-press and illustrations, with advance copies of the latest number\r\nstrewn over his table.\r\n\r\nBut Dryfoos apparently kept himself from looking at these things. He\r\nrolled his head about on his shoulders to take in the character of the\r\nroom, and said to his son, "You didn\'t change the woodwork, after all."\r\n\r\n"No; the architect thought we had better let it be, unless we meant to\r\nchange the whole place. He liked its being old-fashioned."\r\n\r\n"I hope you feel comfortable here, Mr. March," the old man said, bringing\r\nhis eyes to bear upon him again after their tour of inspection.\r\n\r\n"Too comfortable for a working-man," said March, and he thought that this\r\nremark must bring them to some talk about his work, but the proprietor\r\nonly smiled again.\r\n\r\n"I guess I sha\'n\'t lose much on this house," he returned, as if musing\r\naloud. "This down-town property is coming up. Business is getting in on\r\nall these side streets. I thought I paid a pretty good price for it,\r\ntoo." He went on to talk of real estate, and March began to feel a\r\ncertain resentment at his continued avoidance of the only topic in which\r\nthey could really have a common interest. "You live down this way\r\nsomewhere, don\'t you?" the old man concluded.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I wished to be near my work." March was vexed with himself for\r\nhaving recurred to it; but afterward he was not sure but Dryfoos shared\r\nhis own diffidence in the matter, and was waiting for him to bring it\r\nopenly into the talk. At times he seemed wary and masterful, and then\r\nMarch felt that he was being examined and tested; at others so simple\r\nthat March might well have fancied that he needed encouragement, and\r\ndesired it. He talked of his wife and daughters in a way that invited\r\nMarch to say friendly things of his family, which appeared to give the\r\nold man first an undue pleasure and then a final distrust. At moments he\r\nturned, with an effect of finding relief in it, to his son and spoke to\r\nhim across March of matters which he was unacquainted with; he did not\r\nseem aware that this was rude, but the young man must have felt it so; he\r\nalways brought the conversation back, and once at some cost to himself\r\nwhen his father made it personal.\r\n\r\n"I want to make a regular New York business man out of that fellow," he\r\nsaid to March, pointing at Conrad with his stick. "You s\'pose I\'m ever\r\ngoing to do it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said March, trying to fall in with the joke. "Do\r\nyou mean nothing but a business man?"\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed at whatever latent meaning he fancied in this, and\r\nsaid: "You think he would be a little too much for me there? Well, I\'ve\r\nseen enough of \'em to know it don\'t always take a large pattern of a man\r\nto do a large business. But I want him to get the business training, and\r\nthen if he wants to go into something else he knows what the world is,\r\nanyway. Heigh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" March assented, with some compassion for the young man\r\nreddening patiently under his father\'s comment.\r\n\r\nDryfoos went on as if his son were not in hearing. "Now that boy wanted\r\nto be a preacher. What does a preacher know about the world he preaches\r\nagainst when he\'s been brought up a preacher? He don\'t know so much as a\r\nbad little boy in his Sunday-school; he knows about as much as a girl. I\r\nalways told him, You be a man first, and then you be a preacher, if you\r\nwant to. Heigh?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely." March began to feel some compassion for himself in being\r\nwitness of the young fellow\'s discomfort under his father\'s homily.\r\n\r\n"When we first come to New York, I told him, Now here\'s your chance to\r\nsee the world on a big scale. You know already what work and saving and\r\nsteady habits and sense will bring a man, to; you don\'t want to go round\r\namong the rich; you want to go among the poor, and see what laziness and\r\ndrink and dishonesty and foolishness will bring men to. And I guess he\r\nknows, about as well as anybody; and if he ever goes to preaching he\'ll\r\nknow what he\'s preaching about." The old man smiled his fierce, simple\r\nsmile, and in his sharp eyes March fancied contempt of the ambition he\r\nhad balked in his son. The present scene must have been one of many\r\nbetween them, ending in meek submission on the part of the young man,\r\nwhom his father, perhaps without realizing his cruelty, treated as a\r\nchild. March took it hard that he should be made to suffer in the\r\npresence of a co-ordinate power like himself, and began to dislike the\r\nold man out of proportion to his offence, which might have been mere want\r\nof taste, or an effect of mere embarrassment before him. But evidently,\r\nwhatever rebellion his daughters had carried through against him, he had\r\nkept his dominion over this gentle spirit unbroken. March did not choose\r\nto make any response, but to let him continue, if he would, entirely upon\r\nhis own impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA silence followed, of rather painful length. It was broken by the cheery\r\nvoice of Fulkerson, sent before him to herald Fulkerson\'s cheery person.\r\n"Well, I suppose you\'ve got the glorious success of \'Every Other Week\'\r\ndown pretty cold in your talk by this time. I should have been up sooner\r\nto join you, but I was nipping a man for the last page of the cover. I\r\nguess we\'ll have to let the Muse have that for an advertisement instead\r\nof a poem the next time, March. Well, the old gentleman given you boys\r\nyour scolding?" The person of Fulkerson had got into the room long before\r\nhe reached this question, and had planted itself astride a chair.\r\nFulkerson looked over the chairback, now at March, and now at the elder\r\nDryfoos as he spoke.\r\n\r\nMarch answered him. "I guess we must have been waiting for you,\r\nFulkerson. At any rate, we hadn\'t got to the scolding yet."\r\n\r\n"Why, I didn\'t suppose Mr. Dryfoos could \'a\' held in so long. I\r\nunderstood he was awful mad at the way the thing started off, and wanted\r\nto give you a piece of his mind, when he got at you. I inferred as much\r\nfrom a remark that he made." March and Dryfoos looked foolish, as men do\r\nwhen made the subject of this sort of merry misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n"I reckon my scolding will keep awhile yet," said the old man, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I guess it\'s a good chance to give Mr. Dryfoos an idea of\r\nwhat we\'ve really done--just while we\'re resting, as Artemus Ward says.\r\nHeigh, March?"\r\n\r\n"I will let you blow the trumpet, Fulkerson. I think it belongs strictly\r\nto the advertising department," said March. He now distinctly resented\r\nthe old man\'s failure to say anything to him of the magazine; he made his\r\ninference that it was from a suspicion of his readiness to presume upon a\r\nrecognition of his share in the success, and he was determined to second\r\nno sort of appeal for it.\r\n\r\n"The advertising department is the heart and soul of every business,"\r\nsaid Fulkerson, hardily, "and I like to keep my hand in with a little\r\npractise on the trumpet in private. I don\'t believe Mr. Dryfoos has got\r\nany idea of the extent of this thing. He\'s been out among those\r\nRackensackens, where we were all born, and he\'s read the notices in their\r\nseven by nine dailies, and he\'s seen the thing selling on the cars, and\r\nhe thinks he appreciates what\'s been done. But I should just like to take\r\nhim round in this little old metropolis awhile, and show him \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' on the centre tables of the millionaires--the Vanderbilts and the\r\nAstors--and in the homes of culture and refinement everywhere, and let\r\nhim judge for himself. It\'s the talk of the clubs and the dinner-tables;\r\nchildren cry for it; it\'s the Castoria of literature and the Pearline of\r\nart, the \'Won\'t-be-happy-till-he-gets-it of every enlightened man,\r\nwoman, and child in this vast city. I knew we could capture the country;\r\nbut, my goodness! I didn\'t expect to have New York fall into our hands at\r\na blow. But that\'s just exactly what New York has done. \'Every Other Week\'\r\nsupplies the long-felt want that\'s been grinding round in New York and\r\nkeeping it awake nights ever since the war. It\'s the culmination of all\r\nthe high and ennobling ideals of the past."\r\n\r\n"How much," asked Dryfoos, "do you expect to get out of it the first\r\nyear, if it keeps the start it\'s got?"\r\n\r\n"Comes right down to business, every time!" said Fulkerson, referring the\r\ncharacteristic to March with a delighted glance. "Well, sir, if\r\neverything works right, and we get rain enough to fill up the springs,\r\nand it isn\'t a grasshopper year, I expect to clear above all expenses\r\nsomething in the neighborhood of twenty-five thousand dollars."\r\n\r\n"Humph! And you are all going to work a year--editor, manager, publisher,\r\nartists, writers, printers, and the rest of \'em--to clear twenty-five\r\nthousand dollars?--I made that much in half a day in Moffitt once. I see\r\nit made in half a minute in Wall Street, sometimes." The old man\r\npresented this aspect of the case with a good-natured contempt, which\r\nincluded Fulkerson and his enthusiasm in an obvious liking.\r\n\r\nHis son suggested, "But when we make that money here, no one loses it."\r\n\r\n"Can you prove that?" His father turned sharply upon him. "Whatever is\r\nwon is lost. It\'s all a game; it don\'t make any difference what you bet\r\non. Business is business, and a business man takes his risks with his\r\neyes open."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but the glory!" Fulkerson insinuated with impudent persiflage. "I\r\nhadn\'t got to the glory yet, because it\'s hard to estimate it; but put\r\nthe glory at the lowest figure, Mr. Dryfoos, and add it to the\r\ntwenty-five thousand, and you\'ve got an annual income from \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' of dollars enough to construct a silver railroad, double-track,\r\nfrom this office to the moon. I don\'t mention any of the sister planets\r\nbecause I like to keep within bounds."\r\n\r\nDryfoos showed his lower teeth for pleasure in Fulkerson\'s fooling, and\r\nsaid, "That\'s what I like about you, Mr. Fulkerson--you always keep\r\nwithin bounds."\r\n\r\n"Well, I ain\'t a shrinking Boston violet, like March, here. More\r\nsunflower in my style of diffidence; but I am modest, I don\'t deny it,"\r\nsaid Fulkerson. "And I do hate to have a thing overstated."\r\n\r\n"And the glory--you do really think there\'s something in the glory that\r\npays?"\r\n\r\n"Not a doubt of it! I shouldn\'t care for the paltry return in money,"\r\nsaid Fulkerson, with a burlesque of generous disdain, "if it wasn\'t for\r\nthe glory along with it."\r\n\r\n"And how should you feel about the glory, if there was no money along\r\nwith it?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I\'m happy to say we haven\'t come to that yet."\r\n\r\n"Now, Conrad, here," said the old man, with a sort of pathetic rancor,\r\n"would rather have the glory alone. I believe he don\'t even care much for\r\nyour kind of glory, either, Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\nFulkerson ran his little eyes curiously over Conrad\'s face and then\r\nMarch\'s, as if searching for a trace there of something gone before which\r\nwould enable him to reach Dryfoos\'s whole meaning. He apparently resolved\r\nto launch himself upon conjecture. "Oh, well, we know how Conrad feels\r\nabout the things of this world, anyway. I should like to take \'em on the\r\nplane of another sphere, too, sometimes; but I noticed a good while ago\r\nthat this was the world I was born into, and so I made up my mind that I\r\nwould do pretty much what I saw the rest of the folks doing here below.\r\nAnd I can\'t see but what Conrad runs the thing on business principles in\r\nhis department, and I guess you\'ll find it so if you look into it. I\r\nconsider that we\'re a whole team and big dog under the wagon with you to\r\ndraw on for supplies, and March, here, at the head of the literary\r\nbusiness, and Conrad in the counting-room, and me to do the heavy lying\r\nin the advertising part. Oh, and Beaton, of course, in the art. I \'most\r\nforgot Beaton--Hamlet with Hamlet left out."\r\n\r\nDryfoos looked across at his son. "Wasn\'t that the fellow\'s name that was\r\nthere last night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Conrad.\r\n\r\nThe old man rose. "Well, I reckon I got to be going. You ready to go\r\nup-town, Conrad?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not quite yet, father."\r\n\r\nThe old man shook hands with March, and went downstairs, followed by his\r\nson.\r\n\r\nFulkerson remained.\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t jump at the chance you gave him to compliment us all round,\r\nFulkerson," said March, with a smile not wholly of pleasure.\r\n\r\nFulkerson asked, with as little joy in the grin he had on, "Didn\'t he say\r\nanything to you before I came in?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Dogged if I know what to make of it," sighed Fulkerson, "but I guess\r\nhe\'s been having a talk with Conrad that\'s soured on him. I reckon maybe\r\nhe came back expecting to find that boy reconciled to the glory of this\r\nworld, and Conrad\'s showed himself just as set against it as ever."\r\n\r\n"It might have been that," March admitted, pensively. "I fancied\r\nsomething of the kind myself from words the old man let drop."\r\n\r\nFulkerson made him explain, and then he said:\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, then; and it\'s all right. Conrad \'ll come round in time; and\r\nall we\'ve got to do is to have patience with the old man till he does. I\r\nknow he likes you." Fulkerson affirmed this only interrogatively, and\r\nlooked so anxiously to March for corroboration that March laughed.\r\n\r\n"He dissembled his love," he said; but afterward, in describing to his\r\nwife his interview with Mr. Dryfoos, he was less amused with this fact.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that he was a little cast down by it, she began to encourage\r\nhim. "He\'s just a common, ignorant man, and probably didn\'t know how to\r\nexpress himself. You may be perfectly sure that he\'s delighted with the\r\nsuccess of the magazine, and that he understands as well as you do that\r\nhe owes it all to you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m not so sure. I don\'t believe a man\'s any better for having made\r\nmoney so easily and rapidly as Dryfoos has done, and I doubt if he\'s any\r\nwiser. I don\'t know just the point he\'s reached in his evolution from\r\ngrub to beetle, but I do know that so far as it\'s gone the process must\r\nhave involved a bewildering change of ideals and criterions. I guess he\'s\r\ncome to despise a great many things that he once respected, and that\r\nintellectual ability is among them--what we call intellectual ability. He\r\nmust have undergone a moral deterioration, an atrophy of the generous\r\ninstincts, and I don\'t see why it shouldn\'t have reached his mental\r\nmake-up. He has sharpened, but he has narrowed; his sagacity has turned\r\ninto suspicion, his caution to meanness, his courage to ferocity. That\'s\r\nthe way I philosophize a man of Dryfoos\'s experience, and I am not very\r\nproud when I realize that such a man and his experience are the ideal and\r\nambition of most Americans. I rather think they came pretty near being\r\nmine, once."\r\n\r\n"No, dear, they never did," his wife protested.\r\n\r\n"Well, they\'re not likely to be in the future. The Dryfoos feature of\r\n\'Every Other Week\' is thoroughly distasteful to me."\r\n\r\n"Why, but he hasn\'t really got anything to do with it, has he, beyond\r\nfurnishing the money?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the impression that Fulkerson has allowed us to get. But the man\r\nthat holds the purse holds the reins. He may let us guide the horse, but\r\nwhen he likes he can drive. If we don\'t like his driving, then we can get\r\ndown."\r\n\r\nMrs. March was less interested in this figure of speech than in the\r\npersonal aspects involved. "Then you think Mr. Fulkerson has deceived\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" said her husband, laughing. "But I think he has deceived\r\nhimself, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"How?" she pursued.\r\n\r\n"He may have thought he was using Dryfoos, when Dryfoos was using him,\r\nand he may have supposed he was not afraid of him when he was very much\r\nso. His courage hadn\'t been put to the test, and courage is a matter of\r\nproof, like proficiency on the fiddle, you know: you can\'t tell whether\r\nyou\'ve got it till you try."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! Do you mean that he would ever sacrifice you to Mr. Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"I hope he may not be tempted. But I\'d rather be taking the chances with\r\nFulkerson alone than with Fulkerson and Dryfoos to back him. Dryfoos\r\nseems, somehow, to take the poetry and the pleasure out of the thing."\r\n\r\nMrs. March was a long time silent. Then she began, "Well, my dear, I\r\nnever wanted to come to New York--"\r\n\r\n"Neither did I," March promptly put in.\r\n\r\n"But now that we\'re here," she went on, "I\'m not going to have you\r\nletting every little thing discourage you. I don\'t see what there was in\r\nMr. Dryfoos\'s manner to give you any anxiety. He\'s just a common, stupid,\r\ninarticulate country person, and he didn\'t know how to express himself,\r\nas I said in the beginning, and that\'s the reason he didn\'t say\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t deny you\'re right about it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s dreadful," his wife continued, "to be mixed up with such a man and\r\nhis family, but I don\'t believe he\'ll ever meddle with your management,\r\nand, till he does, all you need do is to have as little to do with him as\r\npossible, and go quietly on your own way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall go on quietly enough," said March. "I hope I sha\'n\'t begin\r\ngoing stealthily."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Mrs. March, "just let me know when you\'re tempted\r\nto do that. If ever you sacrifice the smallest grain of your honesty or\r\nyour self-respect to Mr. Dryfoos, or anybody else, I will simply renounce\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"In view of that I\'m rather glad the management of \'Every Other Week\'\r\ninvolves tastes and not convictions," said March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThat night Dryfoos was wakened from his after-dinner nap by the sound of\r\ngay talk and nervous giggling in the drawing-room. The talk, which was\r\nChristine\'s, and the giggling, which was Mela\'s, were intershot with the\r\nheavier tones of a man\'s voice; and Dryfoos lay awhile on the leathern\r\nlounge in his library, trying to make out whether he knew the voice. His\r\nwife sat in a deep chair before the fire, with her eyes on his face,\r\nwaiting for him to wake.\r\n\r\n"Who is that out there?" he asked, without opening his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed, I don\'t know, Jacob," his wife answered. "I reckon it\'s\r\njust some visitor of the girls\'."\r\n\r\n"Was I snoring?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit. You was sleeping as quiet! I did hate to have \'em wake you,\r\nand I was just goin\' out to shoo them. They\'ve been playin\' something,\r\nand that made them laugh."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know but I had snored," said the old man, sitting up.\r\n\r\n"No," said his wife. Then she asked, wistfully, "Was you out at the old\r\nplace, Jacob?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did it look natural?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; mostly. They\'re sinking the wells down in the woods pasture."\r\n\r\n"And--the children\'s graves?"\r\n\r\n"They haven\'t touched that part. But I reckon we got to have \'em moved to\r\nthe cemetery. I bought a lot."\r\n\r\nThe old woman began softly to weep. "It does seem too hard that they\r\ncan\'t be let to rest in peace, pore little things. I wanted you and me to\r\nlay there, too, when our time come, Jacob. Just there, back o\' the\r\nbeehives and under them shoomakes--my, I can see the very place! And I\r\ndon\'t believe I\'ll ever feel at home anywheres else. I woon\'t know where\r\nI am when the trumpet sounds. I have to think before I can tell where the\r\neast is in New York; and what if I should git faced the wrong way when I\r\nraise? Jacob, I wonder you could sell it!" Her head shook, and the\r\nfirelight shone on her tears as she searched the folds of her dress for\r\nher pocket.\r\n\r\nA peal of laughter came from the drawing-room, and then the sound of\r\nchords struck on the piano.\r\n\r\n"Hush! Don\'t you cry, \'Liz\'beth!" said Dryfoos. "Here; take my\r\nhandkerchief. I\'ve got a nice lot in the cemetery, and I\'m goin\' to have\r\na monument, with two lambs on it--like the one you always liked so much.\r\nIt ain\'t the fashion, any more, to have family buryin\' grounds; they\'re\r\ncollectin\' \'em into the cemeteries, all round."\r\n\r\n"I reckon I got to bear it," said his wife, muffling her face in his\r\nhandkerchief. "And I suppose the Lord kin find me, wherever I am. But I\r\nalways did want to lay just there. You mind how we used to go out and set\r\nthere, after milkin\', and watch the sun go down, and talk about where\r\ntheir angels was, and try to figger it out?"\r\n\r\n"I remember, \'Liz\'beth."\r\n\r\nThe man\'s voice in the drawing-room sang a snatch of French song,\r\ninsolent, mocking, salient; and then Christine\'s attempted the same\r\nstrain, and another cry of laughter from Mela followed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I always did expect to lay there. But I reckon it\'s all right. It\r\nwon\'t be a great while, now, anyway. Jacob, I don\'t believe I\'m a-goin\'\r\nto live very long. I know it don\'t agree with me here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess it does, \'Liz\'beth. You\'re just a little pulled down with\r\nthe weather. It\'s coming spring, and you feel it; but the doctor says\r\nyou\'re all right. I stopped in, on the way up, and he says so."\r\n\r\n"I reckon he don\'t know everything," the old woman persisted: "I\'ve been\r\nrunnin\' down ever since we left Moffitt, and I didn\'t feel any too well\r\nthere, even. It\'s a very strange thing, Jacob, that the richer you git,\r\nthe less you ain\'t able to stay where you want to, dead or alive."\r\n\r\n"It\'s for the children we do it," said Dryfoos. "We got to give them\r\ntheir chance in the world."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the world! They ought to bear the yoke in their youth, like we done.\r\nI know it\'s what Coonrod would like to do."\r\n\r\nDryfoos got upon his feet. "If Coonrod \'ll mind his own business, and do\r\nwhat I want him to, he\'ll have yoke enough to bear." He moved from his\r\nwife, without further effort to comfort her, and pottered heavily out\r\ninto the dining-room. Beyond its obscurity stretched the glitter of the\r\ndeep drawing-room. His feet, in their broad, flat slippers, made no sound\r\non the dense carpet, and he came unseen upon the little group there near\r\nthe piano. Mela perched upon the stool with her back to the keys, and\r\nBeaton bent over Christine, who sat with a banjo in her lap, letting him\r\ntake her hands and put them in the right place on the instrument. Her\r\nface was radiant with happiness, and Mela was watching her with foolish,\r\nunselfish pleasure in her bliss.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing wrong in the affair to a man of Dryfoos\'s traditions\r\nand perceptions, and if it had been at home in the farm sitting-room, or\r\neven in his parlor at Moffitt, he would not have minded a young man\'s\r\nplacing his daughter\'s hands on a banjo, or even holding them there; it\r\nwould have seemed a proper, attention from him if he was courting her.\r\nBut here, in such a house as this, with the daughter of a man who had\r\nmade as much money as he had, he did not know but it was a liberty. He\r\nfelt the angry doubt of it which beset him in regard to so many\r\nexperiences of his changed life; he wanted to show his sense of it, if it\r\nwas a liberty, but he did not know how, and he did not know that it was\r\nso. Besides, he could not help a touch of the pleasure in Christine\'s\r\nhappiness which Mela showed; and he would have gone back to the library,\r\nif he could, without being discovered.\r\n\r\nBut Beaton had seen him, and Dryfoos, with a nonchalant nod to the young\r\nman, came forward. "What you got there, Christine?"\r\n\r\n"A banjo," said the girl, blushing in her father\'s presence.\r\n\r\nMela gurgled. "Mr. Beaton is learnun\' her the first position."\r\n\r\nBeaton was not embarrassed. He was in evening dress, and his face,\r\npointed with its brown beard, showed extremely handsome above the expanse\r\nof his broad, white shirt-front. He gave back as nonchalant a nod as he\r\nhad got, and, without further greeting to Dryfoos, he said to Christine:\r\n"No, no. You must keep your hand and arm so." He held them in position.\r\n"There! Now strike with your right hand. See?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe I can ever learn," said the girl, with a fond upward\r\nlook at him.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, you can," said Beaton.\r\n\r\nThey both ignored Dryfoos in the little play of protests which followed,\r\nand he said, half jocosely, half suspiciously, "And is the banjo the\r\nfashion, now?" He remembered it as the emblem of low-down show business,\r\nand associated it with end-men and blackened faces and grotesque\r\nshirt-collars.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all the rage," Mela shouted, in answer for all. "Everybody plays\r\nit. Mr. Beaton borrowed this from a lady friend of his."\r\n\r\n"Humph! Pity I got you a piano, then," said Dryfoos. "A banjo would have\r\nbeen cheaper."\r\n\r\nBeaton so far admitted him to the conversation as to seem reminded of the\r\npiano by his mentioning it. He said to Mela, "Oh, won\'t you just strike\r\nthose chords?" and as Mela wheeled about and beat the keys he took the\r\nbanjo from Christine and sat down with it. "This way!" He strummed it,\r\nand murmured the tune Dryfoos had heard him singing from the library,\r\nwhile he kept his beautiful eyes floating on Christine\'s. "You try that,\r\nnow; it\'s very simple."\r\n\r\n"Where is Mrs. Mandel?" Dryfoos demanded, trying to assert himself.\r\n\r\nNeither of the girls seemed to have heard him at first in the chatter\r\nthey broke into over what Beaton proposed. Then Mela said, absently, "Oh,\r\nshe had to go out to see one of her friends that\'s sick," and she struck\r\nthe piano keys. "Come; try it, Chris!"\r\n\r\nDryfoos turned about unheeded and went back to the library. He would have\r\nliked to put Beaton out of his house, and in his heart he burned against\r\nhim as a contumacious hand; he would have liked to discharge him from the\r\nart department of \'Every Other Week\' at once. But he was aware of not\r\nhaving treated Beaton with much ceremony, and if the young man had\r\nreturned his behavior in kind, with an electrical response to his own\r\nfeeling, had he any right to complain? After all, there was no harm in\r\nhis teaching Christine the banjo.\r\n\r\nHis wife still sat looking into the fire. "I can\'t see," she said, "as\r\nwe\'ve got a bit more comfort of our lives, Jacob, because we\'ve got such\r\npiles and piles of money. I wisht to gracious we was back on the farm\r\nthis minute. I wisht you had held out ag\'inst the childern about sellin\'\r\nit; \'twould \'a\' bin the best thing fur \'em, I say. I believe in my soul\r\nthey\'ll git spoiled here in New York. I kin see a change in \'em\r\na\'ready--in the girls."\r\n\r\nDryfoos stretched himself on the lounge again. "I can\'t see as Coonrod is\r\nmuch comfort, either. Why ain\'t he here with his sisters? What does all\r\nthat work of his on the East Side amount to? It seems as if he done it to\r\ncross me, as much as anything." Dryfoos complained to his wife on the\r\nbasis of mere affectional habit, which in married life often survives the\r\nsense of intellectual equality. He did not expect her to reason with him,\r\nbut there was help in her listening, and though she could only soothe his\r\nfretfulness with soft answers which were often wide of the purpose, he\r\nstill went to her for solace. "Here, I\'ve gone into this newspaper\r\nbusiness, or whatever it is, on his account, and he don\'t seem any more\r\nsatisfied than ever. I can see he hain\'t got his heart in it."\r\n\r\n"The pore boy tries; I know he does, Jacob; and he wants to please you.\r\nBut he give up a good deal when he give up bein\' a preacher; I s\'pose we\r\nought to remember that."\r\n\r\n"A preacher!" sneered Dryfoos. "I reckon bein\' a preacher wouldn\'t\r\nsatisfy him now. He had the impudence to tell me this afternoon that he\r\nwould like to be a priest; and he threw it up to me that he never could\r\nbe because I\'d kept him from studyin\'."\r\n\r\n"He don\'t mean a Catholic priest--not a Roman one, Jacob," the old woman\r\nexplained, wistfully. "He\'s told me all about it. They ain\'t the kind o\'\r\nCatholics we been used to; some sort of \'Piscopalians; and they do a heap\r\no\' good amongst the poor folks over there. He says we ain\'t got any idea\r\nhow folks lives in them tenement houses, hundreds of \'em in one house,\r\nand whole families in a room; and it burns in his heart to help \'em like\r\nthem Fathers, as he calls \'em, that gives their lives to it. He can\'t be\r\na Father, he says, because he can\'t git the eddication now; but he can be\r\na Brother; and I can\'t find a word to say ag\'inst it, when it gits to\r\ntalkin\', Jacob."\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t saying anything against his priests, \'Liz\'beth," said Dryfoos.\r\n"They\'re all well enough in their way; they\'ve given up their lives to\r\nit, and it\'s a matter of business with them, like any other. But what I\'m\r\ntalking about now is Coonrod. I don\'t object to his doin\' all the charity\r\nhe wants to, and the Lord knows I\'ve never been stingy with him about it.\r\nHe might have all the money he wants, to give round any way he pleases."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I told him once, but he says money ain\'t the thing--or not\r\nthe only thing you got to give to them poor folks. You got to give your\r\ntime and your knowledge and your love--I don\'t know what all you got to\r\ngive yourself, if you expect to help \'em. That\'s what Coonrod says."\r\n\r\n"Well, I can tell him that charity begins at home," said Dryfoos, sitting\r\nup in his impatience. "And he\'d better give himself to us a little--to\r\nhis old father and mother. And his sisters. What\'s he doin\' goin\' off\r\nthere to his meetings, and I don\'t know what all, an\' leavin\' them here\r\nalone?"\r\n\r\n"Why, ain\'t Mr. Beaton with \'em?" asked the old woman. "I thought I\r\nheared his voice."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Beaton! Of course he is! And who\'s Mr. Beaton, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"Why, ain\'t he one of the men in Coonrod\'s office? I thought I heared--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is! But who is he? What\'s he doing round here? Is he makin\' up\r\nto Christine?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon he is. From Mely\'s talk, she\'s about crazy over the fellow.\r\nDon\'t you like him, Jacob?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know him, or what he is. He hasn\'t got any manners. Who brought\r\nhim here? How\'d he come to come, in the first place?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson brung him, I believe," said the old woman, patiently.\r\n\r\n"Fulkerson!" Dryfoos snorted. "Where\'s Mrs. Mandel, I should like to\r\nknow? He brought her, too. Does she go traipsin\' off this way every\r\nevening?"\r\n\r\n"No, she seems to be here pretty regular most o\' the time. I don\'t know\r\nhow we could ever git along without her, Jacob; she seems to know just\r\nwhat to do, and the girls would be ten times as outbreakin\' without her.\r\nI hope you ain\'t thinkin\' o\' turnin\' her off, Jacob?"\r\n\r\nDryfoos did not think it necessary to answer such a question. "It\'s all\r\nFulkerson, Fulkerson, Fulkerson. It seems to me that Fulkerson about runs\r\nthis family. He brought Mrs. Mandel, and he brought that Beaton, and he\r\nbrought that Boston fellow! I guess I give him a dose, though; and I\'ll\r\nlearn Fulkerson that he can\'t have everything his own way. I don\'t want\r\nanybody to help me spend my money. I made it, and I can manage it. I\r\nguess Mr. Fulkerson can bear a little watching now. He\'s been travelling\r\npretty free, and he\'s got the notion he\'s driving, maybe. I\'m a-going to\r\nlook after that book a little myself."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll kill yourself, Jacob," said his wife, "tryin\' to do so many\r\nthings. And what is it all fur? I don\'t see as we\'re better off, any, for\r\nall the money. It\'s just as much care as it used to be when we was all\r\nthere on the farm together. I wisht we could go back, Ja--"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t go back!" shouted the old man, fiercely. "There\'s no farm any\r\nmore to go back to. The fields is full of gas-wells and oil-wells and\r\nhell-holes generally; the house is tore down, and the barn\'s goin\'--"\r\n\r\n"The barn!" gasped the old woman. "Oh, my!"\r\n\r\n"If I was to give all I\'m worth this minute, we couldn\'t go back to the\r\nfarm, any more than them girls in there could go back and be little\r\nchildren. I don\'t say we\'re any better off, for the money. I\'ve got more\r\nof it now than I ever had; and there\'s no end to the luck; it pours in.\r\nBut I feel like I was tied hand and foot. I don\'t know which way to move;\r\nI don\'t know what\'s best to do about anything. The money don\'t seem to\r\nbuy anything but more and more care and trouble. We got a big house that\r\nwe ain\'t at home in; and we got a lot of hired girls round under our feet\r\nthat hinder and don\'t help. Our children don\'t mind us, and we got no\r\nfriends or neighbors. But it had to be. I couldn\'t help but sell the\r\nfarm, and we can\'t go back to it, for it ain\'t there. So don\'t you say\r\nanything more about it, \'Liz\'beth."\r\n\r\n"Pore Jacob!" said his wife. "Well, I woon\'t, dear."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt was clear to Beaton that Dryfoos distrusted him; and the fact\r\nheightened his pleasure in Christine\'s liking for him. He was as sure of\r\nthis as he was of the other, though he was not so sure of any reason for\r\nhis pleasure in it. She had her charm; the charm of wildness to which a\r\ncertain wildness in himself responded; and there were times when his\r\nfancy contrived a common future for them, which would have a prosperity\r\nforced from the old fellow\'s love of the girl. Beaton liked the idea of\r\nthis compulsion better than he liked the idea of the money; there was\r\nsomething a little repulsive in that; he imagined himself rejecting it;\r\nhe almost wished he was enough in love with the girl to marry her without\r\nit; that would be fine. He was taken with her in a certain measure, in a\r\ncertain way; the question was in what measure, in what way.\r\n\r\nIt was partly to escape from this question that he hurried down-town, and\r\ndecided to spend with the Leightons the hour remaining on his hands\r\nbefore it was time to go to the reception for which he was dressed. It\r\nseemed to him important that he should see Alma Leighton. After all, it\r\nwas her charm that was most abiding with him; perhaps it was to be final.\r\nHe found himself very happy in his present relations with her. She had\r\ndropped that barrier of pretences and ironical surprise. It seemed to him\r\nthat they had gone back to the old ground of common artistic interest\r\nwhich he had found so pleasant the summer before. Apparently she and her\r\nmother had both forgiven his neglect of them in the first months of their\r\nstay in New York; he was sure that Mrs. Leighton liked him as well as\r\never, and, if there was still something a little provisional in Alma\'s\r\nmanner at times, it was something that piqued more than it discouraged;\r\nit made him curious, not anxious.\r\n\r\nHe found the young ladies with Fulkerson when he rang. He seemed to be\r\namusing them both, and they were both amused beyond the merit of so small\r\na pleasantry, Beaton thought, when Fulkerson said: "Introduce myself, Mr.\r\nBeaton: Mr. Fulkerson of \'Every Other Week.\' Think I\'ve met you at our\r\nplace." The girls laughed, and Alma explained that her mother was not\r\nvery well, and would be sorry not to see him. Then she turned, as he\r\nfelt, perversely, and went on talking with Fulkerson and left him to Miss\r\nWoodburn.\r\n\r\nShe finally recognized his disappointment: "Ah don\'t often get a chance\r\nat you, Mr. Beaton, and Ah\'m just goin\' to toak yo\' to death. Yo\' have\r\nbeen Soath yo\'self, and yo\' know ho\' we do toak."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve survived to say yes," Beaton admitted.\r\n\r\n"Oh, now, do you think we toak so much mo\' than you do in the No\'th?" the\r\nyoung lady deprecated.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I only know you can\'t talk too much for me. I should like\r\nto hear you say Soath and house and about for the rest of my life."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what Ah call raght personal, Mr. Beaton. Now Ah\'m goin\' to be\r\npersonal, too." Miss Woodburn flung out over her lap the square of cloth\r\nshe was embroidering, and asked him: "Don\'t you think that\'s beautiful?\r\nNow, as an awtust--a great awtust?"\r\n\r\n"As a great awtust, yes," said Beaton, mimicking her accent. "If I were\r\nless than great I might have something to say about the arrangement of\r\ncolors. You\'re as bold and original as Nature."\r\n\r\n"Really? Oh, now, do tell me yo\' favo\'ite colo\', Mr. Beaton."\r\n\r\n"My favorite color? Bless my soul, why should I prefer any? Is blue good,\r\nor red wicked? Do people have favorite colors?" Beaton found himself\r\nsuddenly interested.\r\n\r\n"Of co\'se they do," answered the girl. "Don\'t awtusts?"\r\n\r\n"I never heard of one that had--consciously."\r\n\r\n"Is it possible? I supposed they all had. Now mah favo\'ite colo\' is\r\ngawnet. Don\'t you think it\'s a pretty colo\'?"\r\n\r\n"It depends upon how it\'s used. Do you mean in neckties?" Beaton stole a\r\nglance at the one Fulkerson was wearing.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn laughed with her face bowed upon her wrist. "Ah do think\r\nyou gentlemen in the No\'th awe ten tahms as lahvely as the ladies."\r\n\r\n"Strange," said Beaton. "In the South--Soath, excuse me! I made the\r\nobservation that the ladies were ten times as lively as the gentlemen.\r\nWhat is that you\'re working?"\r\n\r\n"This?" Miss Woodburn gave it another flirt, and looked at it with a\r\nglance of dawning recognition. "Oh, this is a table-covah. Wouldn\'t you\r\nlahke to see where it\'s to go?"\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'ll be raght good I\'ll let yo\' give me some professional\r\nadvass about putting something in the co\'ners or not, when you have seen\r\nit on the table."\r\n\r\nShe rose and led the way into the other room. Beaton knew she wanted to\r\ntalk with him about something else; but he waited patiently to let her\r\nplay her comedy out. She spread the cover on the table, and he advised\r\nher, as he saw she wished, against putting anything in the corners; just\r\nrun a line of her stitch around the edge, he said.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson and Ah, why, we\'ve been having a regular faght aboat it,"\r\nshe commented. "But we both agreed, fahnally, to leave it to you; Mr.\r\nFulkerson said you\'d be sure to be raght. Ah\'m so glad you took mah\r\nsahde. But he\'s a great admahrer of yours, Mr. Beaton," she concluded,\r\ndemurely, suggestively.\r\n\r\n"Is he? Well, I\'m a great admirer of Fulkerson," said Beaton, with a\r\ncapricious willingness to humor her wish to talk about Fulkerson. "He\'s a\r\ncapital fellow; generous, magnanimous, with quite an ideal of friendship\r\nand an eye single to the main chance all the time. He would advertise\r\n\'Every Other Week\' on his family vault."\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn laughed, and said she should tell him what Beaton had said.\r\n\r\n"Do. But he\'s used to defamation from me, and he\'ll think you\'re joking."\r\n\r\n"Ah suppose," said Miss Woodburn, "that he\'s quahte the tahpe of a New\r\nYork business man." She added, as if it followed logically, "He\'s so\r\ndifferent from what I thought a New York business man would be."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your Virginia tradition to despise business," said Beaton, rudely.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn laughed again. "Despahse it? Mah goodness! we want to get\r\ninto it and woak it fo\' all it\'s wo\'th,\' as Mr. Fulkerson says. That\r\ntradition is all past. You don\'t know what the Soath is now. Ah suppose\r\nmah fathaw despahses business, but he\'s a tradition himself, as Ah tell\r\nhim." Beaton would have enjoyed joining the young lady in anything she\r\nmight be going to say in derogation of her father, but he restrained\r\nhimself, and she went on more and more as if she wished to account for\r\nher father\'s habitual hauteur with Beaton, if not to excuse it. "Ah tell\r\nhim he don\'t understand the rising generation. He was brought up in the\r\nold school, and he thinks we\'re all just lahke he was when he was young,\r\nwith all those ahdeals of chivalry and family; but, mah goodness! it\'s\r\nmoney that cyoants no\'adays in the Soath, just lahke it does everywhere\r\nelse. Ah suppose, if we could have slavery back in the fawm mah fathaw\r\nthinks it could have been brought up to, when the commercial spirit\r\nwouldn\'t let it alone, it would be the best thing; but we can\'t have it\r\nback, and Ah tell him we had better have the commercial spirit as the\r\nnext best thing."\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn went on, with sufficient loyalty and piety, to expose the\r\ndifference of her own and her father\'s ideals, but with what Beaton\r\nthought less reference to his own unsympathetic attention than to a\r\nknowledge finally of the personnel and materiel of \'Every Other Week.\'\r\nand Mr. Fulkerson\'s relation to the enterprise. "You most excuse my\r\nasking so many questions, Mr. Beaton. You know it\'s all mah doing that we\r\nawe heah in New York. Ah just told mah fathaw that if he was evah goin\'\r\nto do anything with his wrahtings, he had got to come No\'th, and Ah made\r\nhim come. Ah believe he\'d have stayed in the Soath all his lahfe. And now\r\nMr. Fulkerson wants him to let his editor see some of his wrahtings, and\r\nAh wanted to know something aboat the magazine. We awe a great deal\r\nexcited aboat it in this hoase, you know, Mr. Beaton," she concluded,\r\nwith a look that now transferred the interest from Fulkerson to Alma. She\r\nled the way back to the room where they were sitting, and went up to\r\ntriumph over Fulkerson with Beaton\'s decision about the table-cover.\r\n\r\nAlma was left with Beaton near the piano, and he began to talk about the\r\nDryfooses as he sat down on the piano-stool. He said he had been giving\r\nMiss Dryfoos a lesson on the banjo; he had borrowed the banjo of Miss\r\nVance. Then he struck the chord he had been trying to teach Christine,\r\nand played over the air he had sung.\r\n\r\n"How do you like that?" he asked, whirling round.\r\n\r\n"It seems rather a disrespectful little tune, somehow," said Alma,\r\nplacidly.\r\n\r\nBeaton rested his elbow on the corner of the piano and gazed dreamily at\r\nher. "Your perceptions are wonderful. It is disrespectful. I played it,\r\nup there, because I felt disrespectful to them."\r\n\r\n"Do you claim that as a merit?"\r\n\r\n"No, I state it as a fact. How can you respect such people?"\r\n\r\n"You might respect yourself, then," said the girl. "Or perhaps that\r\nwouldn\'t be so easy, either."\r\n\r\n"No, it wouldn\'t. I like to have you say these things to me," said\r\nBeaton, impartially.\r\n\r\n"Well, I like to say them," Alma returned.\r\n\r\n"They do me good."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know that that was my motive."\r\n\r\n"There is no one like you--no one," said Beaton, as if apostrophizing her\r\nin her absence. "To come from that house, with its assertions of\r\nmoney--you can hear it chink; you can smell the foul old banknotes; it\r\nstifles you--into an atmosphere like this, is like coming into another\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Alma. "I\'m glad there isn\'t that unpleasant odor here;\r\nbut I wish there was a little more of the chinking."\r\n\r\n"No, no! Don\'t say that!" he implored. "I like to think that there is one\r\nsoul uncontaminated by the sense of money in this big, brutal, sordid\r\ncity."\r\n\r\n"You mean two," said Alma, with modesty. "But if you stifle at the\r\nDryfooses\', why do you go there?"\r\n\r\n"Why do I go?" he mused. "Don\'t you believe in knowing all the natures,\r\nthe types, you can? Those girls are a strange study: the young one is a\r\nsimple, earthly creature, as common as an oat-field and the other a sort\r\nof sylvan life: fierce, flashing, feline--"\r\n\r\nAlma burst out into a laugh. "What apt alliteration! And do they like\r\nbeing studied? I should think the sylvan life might--scratch."\r\n\r\n"No," said Beaton, with melancholy absence, "it only-purrs."\r\n\r\nThe girl felt a rising indignation. "Well, then, Mr. Beaton, I should\r\nhope it would scratch, and bite, too. I think you\'ve no business to go\r\nabout studying people, as you do. It\'s abominable."\r\n\r\n"Go on," said the young man. "That Puritan conscience of yours! It\r\nappeals to the old Covenanter strain in me--like a voice of\r\npre-existence. Go on--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I went on I should merely say it was not only abominable, but\r\ncontemptible."\r\n\r\n"You could be my guardian angel, Alma," said the young man, making his\r\neyes more and more slumbrous and dreamy.\r\n\r\n"Stuff! I hope I have a soul above buttons!"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, as she rose, and followed her across the room. "Good-night;\r\nMr. Beaton," she said.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn and Fulkerson came in from the other room. "What! You\'re\r\nnot going, Beaton?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'m going to a reception. I stopped in on my way."\r\n\r\n"To kill time," Alma explained.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fulkerson, gallantly, "this is the last place I should like\r\nto do it. But I guess I\'d better be going, too. It has sometimes occurred\r\nto me that there is such a thing as staying too late. But with Brother\r\nBeaton, here, just starting in for an evening\'s amusement, it does seem a\r\nlittle early yet. Can\'t you urge me to stay, somebody?"\r\n\r\nThe two girls laughed, and Miss Woodburn said:\r\n\r\n"Mr. Beaton is such a butterfly of fashion! Ah wish Ah was on mah way to\r\na pawty. Ah feel quahte envious."\r\n\r\n"But he didn\'t say it to make you," Alma explained, with meek softness.\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t all be swells. Where is your party, anyway, Beaton?"\r\nasked Fulkerson. "How do you manage to get your invitations to those\r\nthings? I suppose a fellow has to keep hinting round pretty lively,\r\nNeigh?"\r\n\r\nBeaton took these mockeries serenely, and shook hands with Miss Woodburn,\r\nwith the effect of having already shaken hands with Alma. She stood with\r\nhers clasped behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nBeaton went away with the smile on his face which he had kept in\r\nlistening to Fulkerson, and carried it with him to the reception. He\r\nbelieved that Alma was vexed with him for more personal reasons than she\r\nhad implied; it flattered him that she should have resented what he told\r\nher of the Dryfooses. She had scolded him in their behalf apparently; but\r\nreally because he had made her jealous by his interest, of whatever kind,\r\nin some one else. What followed, had followed naturally. Unless she had\r\nbeen quite a simpleton she could not have met his provisional love-making\r\non any other terms; and the reason why Beaton chiefly liked Alma Leighton\r\nwas that she was not a simpleton. Even up in the country, when she was\r\noverawed by his acquaintance, at first, she was not very deeply overawed,\r\nand at times she was not overawed at all. At such times she astonished\r\nhim by taking his most solemn histrionics with flippant incredulity, and\r\neven burlesquing them. But he could see, all the same, that he had caught\r\nher fancy, and he admired the skill with which she punished his neglect\r\nwhen they met in New York. He had really come very near forgetting the\r\nLeightons; the intangible obligations of mutual kindness which hold some\r\nmen so fast, hung loosely upon him; it would not have hurt him to break\r\nfrom them altogether; but when he recognized them at last, he found that\r\nit strengthened them indefinitely to have Alma ignore them so completely.\r\nIf she had been sentimental, or softly reproachful, that would have been\r\nthe end; he could not have stood it; he would have had to drop her. But\r\nwhen she met him on his own ground, and obliged him to be sentimental,\r\nthe game was in her hands. Beaton laughed, now, when he thought of that,\r\nand he said to himself that the girl had grown immensely since she had\r\ncome to New York; nothing seemed to have been lost upon her; she must\r\nhave kept her eyes uncommonly wide open. He noticed that especially in\r\ntheir talks over her work; she had profited by everything she had seen\r\nand heard; she had all of Wetmore\'s ideas pat; it amused Beaton to see\r\nhow she seized every useful word that he dropped, too, and turned him to\r\ntechnical account whenever she could. He liked that; she had a great deal\r\nof talent; there was no question of that; if she were a man there could\r\nbe no question of her future. He began to construct a future for her; it\r\nincluded provision for himself, too; it was a common future, in which\r\ntheir lives and work were united.\r\n\r\nHe was full of the glow of its prosperity when he met Margaret Vance at\r\nthe reception.\r\n\r\nThe house was one where people might chat a long time together without\r\npublicly committing themselves to an interest in each other except such as\r\ngrew out of each other\'s ideas. Miss Vance was there because she united\r\nin her catholic sympathies or ambitions the objects of the fashionable\r\npeople and of the aesthetic people who met there on common ground. It was\r\nalmost the only house in New York where this happened often, and it did\r\nnot happen very often there. It was a literary house, primarily, with\r\nartistic qualifications, and the frequenters of it were mostly authors\r\nand artists; Wetmore, who was always trying to fit everything with a\r\nphrase, said it was the unfrequenters who were fashionable. There was\r\ngreat ease there, and simplicity; and if there was not distinction, it\r\nwas not for want of distinguished people, but because there seems to be\r\nsome solvent in New York life that reduces all men to a common level,\r\nthat touches everybody with its potent magic and brings to the surface\r\nthe deeply underlying nobody. The effect for some temperaments, for\r\nconsciousness, for egotism, is admirable; for curiosity, for hero\r\nworship, it is rather baffling. It is the spirit of the street\r\ntransferred to the drawing-room; indiscriminating, levelling, but\r\ndoubtless finally wholesome, and witnessing the immensity of the place,\r\nif not consenting to the grandeur of reputations or presences.\r\n\r\nBeaton now denied that this house represented a salon at all, in the old\r\nsense; and he held that the salon was impossible, even undesirable, with\r\nus, when Miss Vance sighed for it. At any rate, he said that this turmoil\r\nof coming and going, this bubble and babble, this cackling and hissing of\r\nconversation was not the expression of any such civilization as had\r\ncreated the salon. Here, he owned, were the elements of intellectual\r\ndelightfulness, but he said their assemblage in such quantity alone\r\ndenied the salon; there was too much of a good thing. The French word\r\nimplied a long evening of general talk among the guests, crowned with a\r\nlittle chicken at supper, ending at cock-crow. Here was tea, with milk or\r\nwith lemon--baths of it and claret-cup for the hardier spirits throughout\r\nthe evening. It was very nice, very pleasant, but it was not the little\r\nchicken--not the salon. In fact, he affirmed, the salon descended from\r\nabove, out of the great world, and included the aesthetic world in it.\r\nBut our great world--the rich people, were stupid, with no wish to be\r\notherwise; they were not even curious about authors and artists. Beaton\r\nfancied himself speaking impartially, and so he allowed himself to speak\r\nbitterly; he said that in no other city in the world, except Vienna,\r\nperhaps, were such people so little a part of society.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t altogether the rich people\'s fault," said Margaret; and she\r\nspoke impartially, too. "I don\'t believe that the literary men and the\r\nartists would like a salon that descended to them. Madame Geoffrin, you\r\nknow, was very plebeian; her husband was a business man of some sort."\r\n\r\n"He would have been a howling swell in New York," said Beaton, still\r\nimpartially.\r\n\r\nWetmore came up to their corner, with a scroll of bread and butter in one\r\nhand and a cup of tea in the other. Large and fat, and clean-shaven, he\r\nlooked like a monk in evening dress.\r\n\r\n"We were talking about salons," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you open a salon yourself?" asked Wetmore, breathing thickly\r\nfrom the anxiety of getting through the crowd without spilling his tea.\r\n\r\n"Like poor Lady Barberina Lemon?" said the girl, with a laugh. "What a\r\ngood story! That idea of a woman who couldn\'t be interested in any of the\r\narts because she was socially and traditionally the material of them! We\r\ncan, never reach that height of nonchalance in this country."\r\n\r\n"Not if we tried seriously?" suggested the painter. "I\'ve an idea that if\r\nthe Americans ever gave their minds to that sort of thing, they could\r\ntake the palm--or the cake, as Beaton here would say--just as they do in\r\neverything else. When we do have an aristocracy, it will be an\r\naristocracy that will go ahead of anything the world has ever seen. Why\r\ndon\'t somebody make a beginning, and go in openly for an ancestry, and a\r\nlower middle class, and an hereditary legislature, and all the rest?\r\nWe\'ve got liveries, and crests, and palaces, and caste feeling. We\'re all\r\nright as far as we\'ve gone, and we\'ve got the money to go any length."\r\n\r\n"Like your natural-gas man, Mr. Beaton," said the girl, with a smiling\r\nglance round at him.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Wetmore, stirring his tea, "has Beaton got a natural-gas man?"\r\n\r\n"My natural-gas man," said Beaton, ignoring Wetmore\'s question, "doesn\'t\r\nknow how to live in his palace yet, and I doubt if he has any caste\r\nfeeling. I fancy his family believe themselves victims of it. They\r\nsay--one of the young ladies does--that she never saw such an unsociable\r\nplace as New York; nobody calls."\r\n\r\n"That\'s good!" said Wetmore. "I suppose they\'re all ready for company,\r\ntoo: good cook, furniture, servants, carriages?"\r\n\r\n"Galore," said Beaton.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s too bad. There\'s a chance for you, Miss Vance. Doesn\'t your\r\nphilanthropy embrace the socially destitute as well as the financially?\r\nJust think of a family like that, without a friend, in a great city! I\r\nshould think common charity had a duty there--not to mention the\r\nuncommon."\r\n\r\nHe distinguished that kind as Margaret\'s by a glance of ironical\r\ndeference. She had a repute for good works which was out of proportion to\r\nthe works, as it always is, but she was really active in that way, under\r\nthe vague obligation, which we now all feel, to be helpful. She was of\r\nthe church which seems to have found a reversion to the imposing ritual\r\nof the past the way back to the early ideals of Christian brotherhood.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they seem to have Mr. Beaton," Margaret answered, and Beaton felt\r\nobscurely flattered by her reference to his patronage of the Dryfooses.\r\n\r\nHe explained to Wetmore: "They have me because they partly own me.\r\nDryfoos is Fulkerson\'s financial backer in \'Every Other Week\'."\r\n\r\n"Is that so? Well, that\'s interesting, too. Aren\'t you rather astonished,\r\nMiss Vance, to see what a petty thing Beaton is making of that magazine\r\nof his?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Margaret, "it\'s so very nice, every way; it makes you feel as\r\nif you did have a country, after all. It\'s as chic--that detestable\r\nlittle word!--as those new French books."\r\n\r\n"Beaton modelled it on them. But you mustn\'t suppose he does everything\r\nabout \'Every Other Week\'; he\'d like you to. Beaton, you haven\'t come up\r\nto that cover of your first number, since. That was the design of one of\r\nmy pupils, Miss Vance--a little girl that Beaton discovered down in New\r\nHampshire last summer."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes. And have you great hopes of her, Mr. Wetmore?"\r\n\r\n"She seems to have more love of it and knack for it than any one of her\r\nsex I\'ve seen yet. It really looks like a case of art for art\'s sake, at\r\ntimes. But you can\'t tell. They\'re liable to get married at any moment,\r\nyou know. Look here, Beaton, when your natural-gas man gets to the\r\npicture-buying stage in his development, just remember your old friends,\r\nwill you? You know, Miss Vance, those new fellows have their regular\r\nstages. They never know what to do with their money, but they find out\r\nthat people buy pictures, at one point. They shut your things up in their\r\nhouses where nobody comes, and after a while they overeat\r\nthemselves--they don\'t know what else to do--and die of apoplexy, and\r\nleave your pictures to a gallery, and then they see the light. It\'s slow,\r\nbut it\'s pretty sure. Well, I see Beaton isn\'t going to move on, as he\r\nought to do; and so I must. He always was an unconventional creature."\r\n\r\nWetmore went away, but Beaton remained, and he outstayed several other\r\npeople who came up to speak to Miss Vance. She was interested in\r\neverybody, and she liked the talk of these clever literary, artistic,\r\nclerical, even theatrical people, and she liked the sort of court with\r\nwhich they recognized her fashion as well as her cleverness; it was very\r\npleasant to be treated intellectually as if she were one of themselves,\r\nand socially as if she was not habitually the same, but a sort of guest\r\nin Bohemia, a distinguished stranger. If it was Arcadia rather than\r\nBohemia, still she felt her quality of distinguished stranger. The\r\nflattery of it touched her fancy, and not her vanity; she had very little\r\nvanity. Beaton\'s devotion made the same sort of appeal; it was not so\r\nmuch that she liked him as she liked being the object of his admiration.\r\nShe was a girl of genuine sympathies, intellectual rather than\r\nsentimental. In fact, she was an intellectual person, whom qualities of\r\nthe heart saved from being disagreeable, as they saved her on the other\r\nhand from being worldly or cruel in her fashionableness. She had read a\r\ngreat many books, and had ideas about them, quite courageous and original\r\nideas; she knew about pictures--she had been in Wetmore\'s class; she was\r\nfond of music; she was willing to understand even politics; in Boston she\r\nmight have been agnostic, but in New York she was sincerely religious;\r\nshe was very accomplished; and perhaps it was her goodness that prevented\r\nher feeling what was not best in Beaton.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," she said, after the retreat of one of the comers and\r\ngoers left her alone with him again, "that those young ladies would like\r\nme to call on them?"\r\n\r\n"Those young ladies?" Beaton echoed. "Miss Leighton and--"\r\n\r\n"No; I have been there with my aunt\'s cards already."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Beaton, as if he had known of it; he admired the pluck and\r\npride with which Alma had refrained from ever mentioning the fact to him,\r\nand had kept her mother from mentioning it, which must have been\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n"I mean the Miss Dryfooses. It seems really barbarous, if nobody goes\r\nnear them. We do all kinds of things, and help all kinds of people in\r\nsome ways, but we let strangers remain strangers unless they know how to\r\nmake their way among us."\r\n\r\n"The Dryfooses certainly wouldn\'t know how to make their way among you,"\r\nsaid Beaton, with a sort of dreamy absence in his tone.\r\n\r\nMiss Vance went on, speaking out the process of reasoning in her mind,\r\nrather than any conclusions she had reached. "We defend ourselves by\r\ntrying to believe that they must have friends of their own, or that they\r\nwould think us patronizing, and wouldn\'t like being made the objects of\r\nsocial charity; but they needn\'t really suppose anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t imagine they would," said Beaton. "I think they\'d be only too\r\nhappy to have you come. But you wouldn\'t know what to do with each other,\r\nindeed, Miss Vance."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we shall like each other," said the girl, bravely, "and then we\r\nshall know. What Church are they of?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe they\'re of any," said Beaton. "The mother was brought up\r\na Dunkard."\r\n\r\n"A Dunkard?"\r\n\r\nBeaton told what he knew of the primitive sect, with its early Christian\r\npolity, its literal interpretation of Christ\'s ethics, and its quaint\r\nceremonial of foot-washing; he made something picturesque of that. "The\r\nfather is a Mammon-worshipper, pure and simple. I suppose the young\r\nladies go to church, but I don\'t know where. They haven\'t tried to\r\nconvert me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell them not to despair--after I\'ve converted them," said Miss\r\nVance. "Will you let me use you as a \'point d\'appui\', Mr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\n"Any way you like. If you\'re really going to see them, perhaps I\'d better\r\nmake a confession. I left your banjo with them, after I got it put in\r\norder."\r\n\r\n"How very nice! Then we have a common interest already."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean the banjo, or--"\r\n\r\n"The banjo, decidedly. Which of them plays?"\r\n\r\n"Neither. But the eldest heard that the banjo was \'all the rage,\' as the\r\nyoungest says. Perhaps you can persuade them that good works are the\r\nrage, too."\r\n\r\nBeaton had no very lively belief that Margaret would go to see the\r\nDryfooses; he did so few of the things he proposed that he went upon the\r\ntheory that others must be as faithless. Still, he had a cruel amusement\r\nin figuring the possible encounter between Margaret Vance, with her\r\nintellectual elegance, her eager sympathies and generous ideals, and\r\nthose girls with their rude past, their false and distorted perspective,\r\ntheir sordid and hungry selfishness, and their faith in the omnipotence\r\nof their father\'s wealth wounded by their experience of its present\r\nsocial impotence. At the bottom of his heart he sympathized with them\r\nrather than with her; he was more like them.\r\n\r\nPeople had ceased coming, and some of them were going. Miss Vance said\r\nshe must go, too, and she was about to rise, when the host came up with\r\nMarch; Beaton turned away.\r\n\r\n"Miss Vance, I want to introduce Mr. March, the editor of \'Every Other\r\nWeek.\' You oughtn\'t to be restricted to the art department. We literary\r\nfellows think that arm of the service gets too much of the glory\r\nnowadays." His banter was for Beaton, but he was already beyond ear-shot,\r\nand the host went on:\r\n\r\n"Mr. March can talk with you about your favorite Boston. He\'s just turned\r\nhis back on it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not!" said Miss Vance. "I can\'t imagine anybody voluntarily\r\nleaving Boston."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say he\'s so bad as that," said the host, committing March to\r\nher. "He came to New York because he couldn\'t help it--like the rest of\r\nus. I never know whether that\'s a compliment to New York or not."\r\n\r\nThey talked Boston a little while, without finding that they had common\r\nacquaintance there; Miss Vance must have concluded that society was much\r\nlarger in Boston than she had supposed from her visits there, or else\r\nthat March did not know many people in it. But she was not a girl to care\r\nmuch for the inferences that might be drawn from such conclusions; she\r\nrather prided herself upon despising them; and she gave herself to the\r\npleasure of being talked to as if she were of March\'s own age. In the\r\nglow of her sympathetic beauty and elegance he talked his best, and tried\r\nto amuse her with his jokes, which he had the art of tingeing with a\r\nlittle seriousness on one side. He made her laugh; and he flattered her\r\nby making her think; in her turn she charmed him so much by enjoying what\r\nhe said that he began to brag of his wife, as a good husband always does\r\nwhen another woman charms him; and she asked, Oh was Mrs. March there;\r\nand would he introduce her?\r\n\r\nShe asked Mrs. March for her address, and whether she had a day; and she\r\nsaid she would come to see her, if she would let her. Mrs. March could\r\nnot be so enthusiastic about her as March was, but as they walked home\r\ntogether they talked the girl over, and agreed about her beauty and her\r\namiability. Mrs. March said she seemed very unspoiled for a person who\r\nmust have been so much spoiled. They tried to analyze her charm, and they\r\nsucceeded in formulating it as a combination of intellectual\r\nfashionableness and worldly innocence. "I think," said Mrs. March, "that\r\ncity girls, brought up as she must have been, are often the most innocent\r\nof all. They never imagine the wickedness of the world, and if they marry\r\nhappily they go through life as innocent as children. Everything combines\r\nto keep them so; the very hollowness of society shields them. They are\r\nthe loveliest of the human race. But perhaps the rest have to pay too\r\nmuch for them."\r\n\r\n"For such an exquisite creature as Miss Vance," said March, "we couldn\'t\r\npay too much."\r\n\r\nA wild laughing cry suddenly broke upon the air at the street-crossing in\r\nfront of them. A girl\'s voice called out: "Run, run, Jen! The copper is\r\nafter you." A woman\'s figure rushed stumbling across the way and into the\r\nshadow of the houses, pursued by a burly policeman.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but if that\'s part of the price?"\r\n\r\nThey went along fallen from the gay spirit of their talk into a silence\r\nwhich he broke with a sigh. "Can that poor wretch and the radiant girl we\r\nleft yonder really belong to the same system of things? How impossible\r\neach makes the other seem!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Horn believed in the world and in society and its unwritten\r\nconstitution devoutly, and she tolerated her niece\'s benevolent\r\nactivities as she tolerated her aesthetic sympathies because these\r\nthings, however oddly, were tolerated--even encouraged--by society; and\r\nthey gave Margaret a charm. They made her originality interesting. Mrs.\r\nHorn did not intend that they should ever go so far as to make her\r\ntroublesome; and it was with a sense of this abeyant authority of her\r\naunt\'s that the girl asked her approval of her proposed call upon the\r\nDryfooses. She explained as well as she could the social destitution of\r\nthese opulent people, and she had of course to name Beaton as the source\r\nof her knowledge concerning them.\r\n\r\n"Did Mr. Beaton suggest your calling on them?"\r\n\r\n"No; he rather discouraged it."\r\n\r\n"And why do you think you ought to go in this particular instance? New\r\nYork is full of people who don\'t know anybody."\r\n\r\nMargaret laughed. "I suppose it\'s like any other charity: you reach the\r\ncases you know of. The others you say you can\'t help, and you try to\r\nignore them."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very romantic," said Mrs. Horn. "I hope you\'ve counted the cost;\r\nall the possible consequences."\r\n\r\nMargaret knew that her aunt had in mind their common experience with the\r\nLeightons, whom, to give their common conscience peace, she had called\r\nupon with her aunt\'s cards and excuses, and an invitation for her\r\nThursdays, somewhat too late to make the visit seem a welcome to New\r\nYork. She was so coldly received, not so much for herself as in her\r\nquality of envoy, that her aunt experienced all the comfort which\r\nvicarious penance brings. She did not perhaps consider sufficiently her\r\nniece\'s guiltlessness in the expiation. Margaret was not with her at St.\r\nBarnaby in the fatal fortnight she passed there, and never saw the\r\nLeightons till she went to call upon them. She never complained: the\r\nstrain of asceticism, which mysteriously exists in us all, and makes us\r\nput peas, boiled or unboiled, in our shoes, gave her patience with the\r\nsnub which the Leightons presented her for her aunt. But now she said,\r\nwith this in mind: "Nothing seems simpler than to get rid of people if\r\nyou don\'t want them. You merely have to let them alone."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t so pleasant, letting them alone," said Mrs. Horn.\r\n\r\n"Or having them let you alone," said Margaret; for neither Mrs. Leighton\r\nnor Alma had ever come to enjoy the belated hospitality of Mrs. Horn\'s\r\nThursdays.\r\n\r\n"Yes, or having them let you alone," Mrs. Horn courageously consented.\r\n"And all that I ask you, Margaret, is to be sure that you really want to\r\nknow these people."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t," said the girl, seriously, "in the usual way."\r\n\r\n"Then the question is whether you do in the unusual way. They will build\r\na great deal upon you," said Mrs. Horn, realizing how much the Leightons\r\nmust have built upon her, and how much out of proportion to her desert\r\nthey must now dislike her; for she seemed to have had them on her mind\r\nfrom the time they came, and had always meant to recognize any reasonable\r\nclaim they had upon her.\r\n\r\n"It seems very odd, very sad," Margaret returned, "that you never could\r\nact unselfishly in society affairs. If I wished to go and see those girls\r\njust to do them a pleasure, and perhaps because if they\'re strange and\r\nlonely, I might do them good, even--it would be impossible."\r\n\r\n"Quite," said her aunt. "Such a thing would be quixotic. Society doesn\'t\r\nrest upon any such basis. It can\'t; it would go to pieces, if people\r\nacted from unselfish motives."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s a painted savage!" said the girl. "All its favors are really\r\nbargains. It\'s gifts are for gifts back again."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is true," said Mrs. Horn, with no more sense of wrong in the\r\nfact than the political economist has in the fact that wages are the\r\nmeasure of necessity and not of merit. "You get what you pay for. It\'s a\r\nmatter of business." She satisfied herself with this formula, which she\r\ndid not invent, as fully as if it were a reason; but she did not dislike\r\nher niece\'s revolt against it. That was part of Margaret\'s originality,\r\nwhich pleased her aunt in proportion to her own conventionality; she was\r\nreally a timid person, and she liked the show of courage which Margaret\'s\r\nmagnanimity often reflected upon her. She had through her a repute, with\r\npeople who did not know her well, for intellectual and moral qualities;\r\nshe was supposed to be literary and charitable; she almost had opinions\r\nand ideals, but really fell short of their possession. She thought that\r\nshe set bounds to the girl\'s originality because she recognized them.\r\nMargaret understood this better than her aunt, and knew that she had\r\nconsulted her about going to see the Dryfooses out of deference, and with\r\nno expectation of luminous instruction. She was used to being a law to\r\nherself, but she knew what she might and might not do, so that she was\r\nrather a by-law. She was the kind of girl that might have fancies for\r\nartists and poets, but might end by marrying a prosperous broker, and\r\nleavening a vast lump of moneyed and fashionable life with her culture,\r\ngenerosity, and good-will. The intellectual interests were first with\r\nher, but she might be equal to sacrificing them; she had the best heart,\r\nbut she might know how to harden it; if she was eccentric, her social\r\norbit was defined; comets themselves traverse space on fixed lines. She\r\nwas like every one else, a congeries of contradictions and\r\ninconsistencies, but obedient to the general expectation of what a girl\r\nof her position must and must not finally be. Provisionally, she was very\r\nmuch what she liked to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nMargaret Vance tried to give herself some reason for going to call upon\r\nthe Dryfooses, but she could find none better than the wish to do a kind\r\nthing. This seemed queerer and less and less sufficient as she examined\r\nit, and she even admitted a little curiosity as a harmless element in her\r\nmotive, without being very well satisfied with it. She tried to add a\r\nslight sense of social duty, and then she decided to have no motive at\r\nall, but simply to pay her visit as she would to any other eligible\r\nstrangers she saw fit to call upon. She perceived that she must be very\r\ncareful not to let them see that any other impulse had governed her; she\r\ndetermined, if possible, to let them patronize her; to be very modest and\r\nsincere and diffident, and, above all, not to play a part. This was easy,\r\ncompared with the choice of a manner that should convey to them the fact\r\nthat she was not playing a part. When the hesitating Irish serving-man\r\nhad acknowledged that the ladies were at home, and had taken her card to\r\nthem, she sat waiting for them in the drawing-room. Her study of its\r\nappointments, with their impersonal costliness, gave her no suggestion\r\nhow to proceed; the two sisters were upon her before she had really\r\ndecided, and she rose to meet them with the conviction that she was going\r\nto play a part for want of some chosen means of not doing so. She found\r\nherself, before she knew it, making her banjo a property in the little\r\ncomedy, and professing so much pleasure in the fact that Miss Dryfoos was\r\ntaking it up; she had herself been so much interested by it. Anything,\r\nshe said, was a relief from the piano; and then, between the guitar and\r\nthe banjo, one must really choose the banjo, unless one wanted to devote\r\none\'s whole natural life to the violin. Of course, there was the\r\nmandolin; but Margaret asked if they did not feel that the bit of shell\r\nyou struck it with interposed a distance between you and the real soul of\r\nthe instrument; and then it did have such a faint, mosquitoy little tone!\r\nShe made much of the question, which they left her to debate alone while\r\nthey gazed solemnly at her till she characterized the tone of the\r\nmandolin, when Mela broke into a large, coarse laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s just what it does sound like," she explained defiantly to\r\nher sister. "I always feel like it was going to settle somewhere, and I\r\nwant to hit myself a slap before it begins to bite. I don\'t see what ever\r\nbrought such a thing into fashion."\r\n\r\nMargaret had not expected to be so powerfully seconded, and she asked,\r\nafter gathering herself together, "And you are both learning the banjo?"\r\n"My, no!" said Mela, "I\'ve gone through enough with the piano. Christine\r\nis learnun\' it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad you are making my banjo useful at the outset, Miss Dryfoos."\r\nBoth girls stared at her, but found it hard to cope with the fact that\r\nthis was the lady friend whose banjo Beaton had lent them. "Mr. Beaton\r\nmentioned that he had left it here. I hope you\'ll keep it as long as you\r\nfind it useful."\r\n\r\nAt this amiable speech even Christine could not help thanking her. "Of\r\ncourse," she said, "I expect to get another, right off. Mr. Beaton is\r\ngoing to choose it for me."\r\n\r\n"You are very fortunate. If you haven\'t a teacher yet I should so like to\r\nrecommend mine."\r\n\r\nMela broke out in her laugh again. "Oh, I guess Christine\'s pretty well\r\nsuited with the one she\'s got," she said, with insinuation. Her sister\r\ngave her a frowning glance, and Margaret did not tempt her to explain.\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s much better," she said. "I have a kind of superstition in\r\nsuch matters; I don\'t like to make a second choice. In a shop I like to\r\ntake the first thing of the kind I\'m looking for, and even if I choose\r\nfurther I come back to the original."\r\n\r\n"How funny!" said Mela. "Well, now, I\'m just the other way. I always take\r\nthe last thing, after I\'ve picked over all the rest. My luck always seems\r\nto be at the bottom of the heap. Now, Christine, she\'s more like you. I\r\nbelieve she could walk right up blindfolded and put her hand on the thing\r\nshe wants every time."\r\n\r\n"I\'m like father," said Christine, softened a little by the celebration\r\nof her peculiarity. "He says the reason so many people don\'t get what\r\nthey want is that they don\'t want it bad enough. Now, when I want a\r\nthing, it seems to me that I want it all through."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s just like father, too," said Mela. "That\'s the way he done\r\nwhen he got that eighty-acre piece next to Moffitt that he kept when he\r\nsold the farm, and that\'s got some of the best gas-wells on it now that\r\nthere is anywhere." She addressed the explanation to her sister, to the\r\nexclusion of Margaret, who, nevertheless, listened with a smiling face\r\nand a resolutely polite air of being a party to the conversation. Mela\r\nrewarded her amiability by saying to her, finally, "You\'ve never been in\r\nthe natural-gas country, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no! And I should so much like to see it!" said Margaret, with a\r\nfervor that was partly voluntary.\r\n\r\n"Would you? Well, we\'re kind of sick of it, but I suppose it would strike\r\na stranger."\r\n\r\n"I never got tired of looking at the big wells when they lit them up,"\r\nsaid Christine. "It seems as if the world was on fire."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and when you see the surface-gas burnun\' down in the woods, like it\r\nused to by our spring-house--so still, and never spreadun\' any, just like\r\na bed of some kind of wild flowers when you ketch sight of it a piece\r\noff."\r\n\r\nThey began to tell of the wonders of their strange land in an antiphony\r\nof reminiscences and descriptions; they unconsciously imputed a merit to\r\nthemselves from the number and violence of the wells on their father\'s\r\nproperty; they bragged of the high civilization of Moffitt, which they\r\ncompared to its advantage with that of New York. They became excited by\r\nMargaret\'s interest in natural gas, and forgot to be suspicious and\r\nenvious.\r\n\r\nShe said, as she rose, "Oh, how much I should like to see it all!" Then\r\nshe made a little pause, and added:\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry my aunt\'s Thursdays are over; she never has them after\r\nLent, but we\'re to have some people Tuesday evening at a little concert\r\nwhich a musical friend is going to give with some other artists. There\r\nwon\'t be any banjos, I\'m afraid, but there\'ll be some very good singing,\r\nand my aunt would be so glad if you could come with your mother."\r\n\r\nShe put down her aunt\'s card on the table near her, while Mela gurgled,\r\nas if it were the best joke: "Oh, my! Mother never goes anywhere; you\r\ncouldn\'t get her out for love or money." But she was herself overwhelmed\r\nwith a simple joy at Margaret\'s politeness, and showed it in a sensuous\r\nway, like a child, as if she had been tickled. She came closer to\r\nMargaret and seemed about to fawn physically upon her.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t she just as lovely as she can live?" she demanded of her sister\r\nwhen Margaret was gone.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Christine. "I guess she wanted to know who Mr.\r\nBeaton had been lending her banjo to."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! Do you suppose she\'s in love with him?" asked Mela, and then she\r\nbroke into her hoarse laugh at the look her sister gave her. "Well, don\'t\r\neat me, Christine! I wonder who she is, anyway? I\'m goun\' to git it out\r\nof Mr. Beaton the next time he calls. I guess she\'s somebody. Mrs. Mandel\r\ncan tell. I wish that old friend of hers would hurry up and git well--or\r\nsomething. But I guess we appeared about as well as she did. I could see\r\nshe was afraid of you, Christine. I reckon it\'s gittun\' around a little\r\nabout father; and when it does I don\'t believe we shall want for callers.\r\nSay, are you goun\'? To that concert of theirs?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Not till I know who they are first."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ve got to hump ourselves if we\'re goun\' to find out before\r\nTuesday."\r\n\r\nAs she went home Margaret felt wrought in her that most incredible of the\r\nmiracles, which, nevertheless, any one may make his experience. She felt\r\nkindly to these girls because she had tried to make them happy, and she\r\nhoped that in the interest she had shown there had been none of the\r\npoison of flattery. She was aware that this was a risk she ran in such an\r\nattempt to do good. If she had escaped this effect she was willing to\r\nleave the rest with Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe notion that a girl of Margaret Vance\'s traditions would naturally\r\nform of girls like Christine and Mela Dryfoos would be that they were\r\nabashed in the presence of the new conditions of their lives, and that\r\nthey must receive the advance she had made them with a certain grateful\r\nhumility. However they received it, she had made it upon principle, from\r\na romantic conception of duty; but this was the way she imagined they\r\nwould receive it, because she thought that she would have done so if she\r\nhad been as ignorant and unbred as they. Her error was in arguing their\r\nattitude from her own temperament, and endowing them, for the purposes of\r\nargument, with her perspective. They had not the means, intellectual or\r\nmoral, of feeling as she fancied. If they had remained at home on the\r\nfarm where they were born, Christine would have grown up that embodiment\r\nof impassioned suspicion which we find oftenest in the narrowest spheres,\r\nand Mela would always have been a good-natured simpleton; but they would\r\nnever have doubted their equality with the wisest and the finest. As it\r\nwas, they had not learned enough at school to doubt it, and the splendor\r\nof their father\'s success in making money had blinded them forever to any\r\npossible difference against them. They had no question of themselves in\r\nthe social abeyance to which they had been left in New York. They had\r\nbeen surprised, mystified; it was not what they had expected; there must\r\nbe some mistake.\r\n\r\nThey were the victims of an accident, which would be repaired as soon as\r\nthe fact of their father\'s wealth had got around. They had been steadfast\r\nin their faith, through all their disappointment, that they were not only\r\nbetter than most people by virtue of his money, but as good as any; and\r\nthey took Margaret\'s visit, so far as they investigated its motive, for\r\na sign that at last it was beginning to get around; of course, a thing\r\ncould not get around in New York so quick as it could in a small place.\r\nThey were confirmed in their belief by the sensation of Mrs. Mandel when\r\nshe returned to duty that afternoon, and they consulted her about going\r\nto Mrs. Horn\'s musicale. If she had felt any doubt at the name for there\r\nwere Horns and Horns--the address on the card put the matter beyond\r\nquestion; and she tried to make her charges understand what a precious\r\nchance had befallen them. She did not succeed; they had not the premises,\r\nthe experience, for a sufficient impression; and she undid her work in\r\npart by the effort to explain that Mrs. Horn\'s standing was independent\r\nof money; that though she was positively rich, she was comparatively\r\npoor. Christine inferred that Miss Vance had called because she wished to\r\nbe the first to get in with them since it had begun to get around. This\r\nview commended itself to Mela, too, but without warping her from her\r\nopinion that Miss Vance was all the same too sweet for anything. She had\r\nnot so vivid a consciousness of her father\'s money as Christine had; but\r\nshe reposed perhaps all the more confidently upon its power. She was far\r\nfrom thinking meanly of any one who thought highly of her for it; that\r\nseemed so natural a result as to be amiable, even admirable; she was\r\nwilling that any such person should get all the good there was in such an\r\nattitude toward her.\r\n\r\nThey discussed the matter that night at dinner before their father and\r\nmother, who mostly sat silent at their meals; the father frowning\r\nabsently over his plate, with his head close to it, and making play into\r\nhis mouth with the back of his knife (he had got so far toward the use of\r\nhis fork as to despise those who still ate from the edge of their\r\nknives), and the mother partly missing hers at times in the nervous\r\ntremor that shook her face from side to side.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the subject of Mela\'s hoarse babble and of Christine\'s\r\nhigh-pitched, thin, sharp forays of assertion and denial in the field\r\nwhich her sister\'s voice seemed to cover, made its way into the old man\'s\r\nconsciousness, and he perceived that they were talking with Mrs. Mandel\r\nabout it, and that his wife was from time to time offering an irrelevant\r\nand mistaken comment. He agreed with Christine, and silently took her\r\nview of the affair some time before he made any sign of having listened.\r\nThere had been a time in his life when other things besides his money\r\nseemed admirable to him. He had once respected himself for the\r\nhard-headed, practical common sense which first gave him standing among\r\nhis country neighbors; which made him supervisor, school trustee, justice\r\nof the peace, county commissioner, secretary of the Moffitt County\r\nAgricultural Society. In those days he had served the public with\r\ndisinterested zeal and proud ability; he used to write to the Lake Shore\r\nFarmer on agricultural topics; he took part in opposing, through the\r\nMoffitt papers, the legislative waste of the people\'s money; on the\r\nquestion of selling a local canal to the railroad company, which killed\r\nthat fine old State work, and let the dry ditch grow up to grass; he\r\nmight have gone to the Legislature, but he contented himself with\r\ndefeating the Moffitt member who had voted for the job. If he opposed\r\nsome measures for the general good, like high schools and school\r\nlibraries, it was because he lacked perspective, in his intense\r\nindividualism, and suspected all expense of being spendthrift. He\r\nbelieved in good district schools, and he had a fondness, crude but\r\ngenuine, for some kinds of reading--history, and forensics of an\r\nelementary sort.\r\n\r\nWith his good head for figures he doubted doctors and despised preachers;\r\nhe thought lawyers were all rascals, but he respected them for their\r\nability; he was not himself litigious, but he enjoyed the intellectual\r\nencounters of a difficult lawsuit, and he often attended a sitting of the\r\nfall term of court, when he went to town, for the pleasure of hearing the\r\nspeeches. He was a good citizen, and a good husband. As a good father, he\r\nwas rather severe with his children, and used to whip them, especially\r\nthe gentle Conrad, who somehow crossed him most, till the twins died.\r\nAfter that he never struck any of them; and from the sight of a blow\r\ndealt a horse he turned as if sick. It was a long time before he lifted\r\nhimself up from his sorrow, and then the will of the man seemed to have\r\nbeen breached through his affections. He let the girls do as they\r\npleased--the twins had been girls; he let them go away to school, and got\r\nthem a piano. It was they who made him sell the farm. If Conrad had only\r\nhad their spirit he could have made him keep it, he felt; and he resented\r\nthe want of support he might have found in a less yielding spirit than\r\nhis son\'s.\r\n\r\nHis moral decay began with his perception of the opportunity of making\r\nmoney quickly and abundantly, which offered itself to him after he sold\r\nhis farm. He awoke to it slowly, from a desolation in which he tasted the\r\nlast bitter of homesickness, the utter misery of idleness and\r\nlistlessness. When he broke down and cried for the hard-working,\r\nwholesome life he had lost, he was near the end of this season of\r\ndespair, but he was also near the end of what was best in himself. He\r\ndevolved upon a meaner ideal than that of conservative good citizenship,\r\nwhich had been his chief moral experience: the money he had already made\r\nwithout effort and without merit bred its unholy self-love in him; he\r\nbegan to honor money, especially money that had been won suddenly and in\r\nlarge sums; for money that had been earned painfully, slowly, and in\r\nlittle amounts, he had only pity and contempt. The poison of that\r\nambition to go somewhere and be somebody which the local speculators had\r\ninstilled into him began to work in the vanity which had succeeded his\r\nsomewhat scornful self-respect; he rejected Europe as the proper field\r\nfor his expansion; he rejected Washington; he preferred New York, whither\r\nthe men who have made money and do not yet know that money has made them,\r\nall instinctively turn. He came where he could watch his money breed more\r\nmoney, and bring greater increase of its kind in an hour of luck than the\r\ntoil of hundreds of men could earn in a year. He called it speculation,\r\nstocks, the Street; and his pride, his faith in himself, mounted with his\r\nluck. He expected, when he had sated his greed, to begin to spend, and he\r\nhad formulated an intention to build a great house, to add another to the\r\npalaces of the country-bred millionaires who have come to adorn the great\r\ncity. In the mean time he made little account of the things that occupied\r\nhis children, except to fret at the ungrateful indifference of his son to\r\nthe interests that could alone make a man of him. He did not know whether\r\nhis daughters were in society or not; with people coming and going in the\r\nhouse he would have supposed they must be so, no matter who the people\r\nwere; in some vague way he felt that he had hired society in Mrs. Mandel,\r\nat so much a year. He never met a superior himself except now and then a\r\nman of twenty or thirty millions to his one or two, and then he felt his\r\nsoul creep within him, without a sense of social inferiority; it was a\r\nquestion of financial inferiority; and though Dryfoos\'s soul bowed itself\r\nand crawled, it was with a gambler\'s admiration of wonderful luck. Other\r\nmen said these many-millioned millionaires were smart, and got their\r\nmoney by sharp practices to which lesser men could not attain; but\r\nDryfoos believed that he could compass the same ends, by the same means,\r\nwith the same chances; he respected their money, not them.\r\n\r\nWhen he now heard Mrs. Mandel and his daughters talking of that person,\r\nwhoever she was, that Mrs. Mandel seemed to think had honored his girls\r\nby coming to see them, his curiosity was pricked as much as his pride was\r\ngalled.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway," said Mela, "I don\'t care whether Christine\'s goon\' or\r\nnot; I am. And you got to go with me, Mrs. Mandel."\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s a little difficulty," said Mrs. Mandel, with her unfailing\r\ndignity and politeness. "I haven\'t been asked, you know."\r\n\r\n"Then what are we goun\' to do?" demanded Mela, almost crossly. She was\r\nphysically too amiable, she felt too well corporeally, ever to be quite\r\ncross. "She might \'a\' knowed--well known--we couldn\'t \'a\' come alone, in\r\nNew York. I don\'t see why we couldn\'t. I don\'t call it much of an\r\ninvitation."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she thought you could come with your mother," Mrs. Mandel\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n"She didn\'t say anything about mother: Did she, Christine? Or, yes, she\r\ndid, too. And I told her she couldn\'t git mother out. Don\'t you\r\nremember?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t pay much attention," said Christine. "I wasn\'t certain we\r\nwanted to go."\r\n\r\n"I reckon you wasn\'t goun\' to let her see that we cared much," said Mela,\r\nhalf reproachful, half proud of this attitude of Christine. "Well, I\r\ndon\'t see but what we got to stay at home." She laughed at this lame\r\nconclusion of the matter.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Mr. Conrad--you could very properly take him without an express\r\ninvitation--" Mrs. Mandel began.\r\n\r\nConrad looked up in alarm and protest. "I--I don\'t think I could go that\r\nevening--"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the reason?" his father broke in, harshly. "You\'re not such a\r\nsheep that you\'re afraid to go into company with your sisters? Or are you\r\ntoo good to go with them?"\r\n\r\n"If it\'s to be anything like that night when them hussies come out and\r\ndanced that way," said Mrs. Dryfoos, "I don\'t blame Coonrod for not\r\nwantun\' to go. I never saw the beat of it."\r\n\r\nMela sent a yelling laugh across the table to her mother. "Well, I wish\r\nMiss Vance could \'a\' heard that! Why, mother, did you think it like the\r\nballet?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t know, Mely, child," said the old woman. "I didn\'t know\r\nwhat it was like. I hain\'t never been to one, and you can\'t be too\r\nkeerful where you go, in a place like New York."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the reason you can\'t go?" Dryfoos ignored the passage between his\r\nwife and daughter in making this demand of his son, with a sour face.\r\n\r\n"I have an engagement that night--it\'s one of our meetings."\r\n\r\n"I reckon you can let your meeting go for one night," said Dryfoos. "It\r\ncan\'t be so important as all that, that you must disappoint your\r\nsisters."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like to disappoint those poor creatures. They depend so much\r\nupon the meetings--"\r\n\r\n"I reckon they can stand it for one night," said the old man. He added,\r\n"The poor ye have with you always."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, Coonrod," said his mother. "It\'s the Saviour\'s own words."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother. But they\'re not meant just as father used them."\r\n\r\n"How do you know how they were meant? Or how I used them?" cried the\r\nfather. "Now you just make your plans to go with the girls, Tuesday\r\nnight. They can\'t go alone, and Mrs. Mandel can\'t go with them."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said Mela. "We don\'t want to take Conrad away from his meetun\',\r\ndo we, Chris?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Christine, in her high, fine voice. "They could get\r\nalong without him for one night, as father says."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not a-goun\' to take him," said Mela. "Now, Mrs. Mandel, just\r\nthink out some other way. Say! What\'s the reason we couldn\'t get somebody\r\nelse to take us just as well? Ain\'t that rulable?"\r\n\r\n"It would be allowable--"\r\n\r\n"Allowable, I mean," Mela corrected herself.\r\n\r\n"But it might look a little significant, unless it was some old family\r\nfriend."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s get Mr. Fulkerson to take us. He\'s the oldest family friend\r\nwe got."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go with Mr. Fulkerson," said Christine, serenely.\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'m sure, Christine," her mother pleaded, "Mr. Fulkerson is a very\r\ngood young man, and very nice appearun\'."\r\n\r\nMela shouted, "He\'s ten times as pleasant as that old Mr. Beaton of\r\nChristine\'s!"\r\n\r\nChristine made no effort to break the constraint that fell upon the table\r\nat this sally, but her father said: "Christine is right, Mela. It\r\nwouldn\'t do for you to go with any other young man. Conrad will go with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not certain I want to go, yet," said Christine.\r\n\r\n"Well, settle that among yourselves. But if you want to go, your brother\r\nwill go with you."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Coonrod \'ll go, if his sisters wants him to," the old woman\r\npleaded. "I reckon it ain\'t agoun\' to be anything very bad; and if it is,\r\nCoonrod, why you can just git right up and come out."\r\n\r\n"It will be all right, mother. And I will go, of course."\r\n\r\n"There, now, I knowed you would, Coonrod. Now, fawther!" This appeal was\r\nto make the old man say something in recognition of Conrad\'s sacrifice.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll always find," he said, "that it\'s those of your own household\r\nthat have the first claim on you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, Coonrod," urged his mother. "It\'s Bible truth. Your fawther\r\nain\'t a perfesser, but he always did read his Bible. Search the\r\nScriptures. That\'s what it means."\r\n\r\n"Laws!" cried Mely, "a body can see, easy enough from mother, where\r\nConrad\'s wantun\' to be a preacher comes from. I should \'a\' thought she\'d\r\n\'a\' wanted to been one herself."\r\n\r\n"Let your women keep silence in the churches," said the old woman,\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\n"There you go again, mother! I guess if you was to say that to some of\r\nthe lady ministers nowadays, you\'d git yourself into trouble." Mela\r\nlooked round for approval, and gurgled out a hoarse laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe Dryfooses went late to Mrs. Horn\'s musicale, in spite of Mrs.\r\nMandel\'s advice. Christine made the delay, both because she wished to\r\nshow Miss Vance that she was (not) anxious, and because she had some\r\nvague notion of the distinction of arriving late at any sort of\r\nentertainment. Mrs. Mandel insisted upon the difference between this\r\nmusicale and an ordinary reception; but Christine rather fancied\r\ndisturbing a company that had got seated, and perhaps making people rise\r\nand stand, while she found her way to her place, as she had seen them do\r\nfor a tardy comer at the theatre.\r\n\r\nMela, whom she did not admit to her reasons or feelings always, followed\r\nher with the servile admiration she had for all that Christine did; and\r\nshe took on trust as somehow successful the result of Christine\'s\r\nobstinacy, when they were allowed to stand against the wall at the back\r\nof the room through the whole of the long piece begun just before they\r\ncame in. There had been no one to receive them; a few people, in the rear\r\nrows of chairs near them, turned their heads to glance at them, and then\r\nlooked away again. Mela had her misgivings; but at the end of the piece\r\nMiss Vance came up to them at once, and then Mela knew that she had her\r\neyes on them all the time, and that Christine must have been right.\r\nChristine said nothing about their coming late, and so Mela did not make\r\nany excuse, and Miss Vance seemed to expect none. She glanced with a sort\r\nof surprise at Conrad, when Christine introduced him; Mela did not know\r\nwhether she liked their bringing him, till she shook hands with him, and\r\nsaid: "Oh, I am very glad indeed! Mr. Dryfoos and I have met before."\r\nWithout explaining where or when, she led them to her aunt and presented\r\nthem, and then said, "I\'m going to put you with some friends of yours,"\r\nand quickly seated them next the Marches. Mela liked that well enough;\r\nshe thought she might have some joking with Mr. March, for all his wife\r\nwas so stiff; but the look which Christine wore seemed to forbid,\r\nprovisionally at least, any such recreation. On her part, Christine was\r\ncool with the Marches. It went through her mind that they must have told\r\nMiss Vance they knew her; and perhaps they had boasted of her intimacy.\r\nShe relaxed a little toward them when she saw Beaton leaning against the\r\nwall at the end of the row next Mrs. March. Then she conjectured that he\r\nmight have told Miss Vance of her acquaintance with the Marches, and she\r\nbent forward and nodded to Mrs. March across Conrad, Mela, and Mr. March.\r\nShe conceived of him as a sort of hand of her father\'s, but she was\r\nwilling to take them at their apparent social valuation for the time. She\r\nleaned back in her chair, and did not look up at Beaton after the first\r\nfurtive glance, though she felt his eyes on her.\r\n\r\nThe music began again almost at once, before Mela had time to make Conrad\r\ntell her where Miss Vance had met him before. She would not have minded\r\ninterrupting the music; but every one else seemed so attentive, even\r\nChristine, that she had not the courage. The concert went onto an end\r\nwithout realizing for her the ideal of pleasure which one ought to find.\r\nin society. She was not exacting, but it seemed to her there were very\r\nfew young men, and when the music was over, and their opportunity came to\r\nbe sociable, they were not very sociable. They were not introduced, for\r\none thing; but it appeared to Mela that they might have got introduced,\r\nif they had any sense; she saw them looking at her, and she was glad she\r\nhad dressed so much; she was dressed more than any other lady there, and\r\neither because she was the most dressed of any person there, or because\r\nit had got around who her father was, she felt that she had made an\r\nimpression on the young men. In her satisfaction with this, and from her\r\ngood nature, she was contented to be served with her refreshments after\r\nthe concert by Mr. March, and to remain joking with him. She was at her\r\nease; she let her hoarse voice out in her largest laugh; she accused him,\r\nto the admiration of those near, of getting her into a perfect gale. It\r\nappeared to her, in her own pleasure, her mission to illustrate to the\r\nrather subdued people about her what a good time really was, so that they\r\ncould have it if they wanted it. Her joy was crowned when March modestly\r\nprofessed himself unworthy to monopolize her, and explained how selfish\r\nhe felt in talking to a young lady when there were so many young men\r\ndying to do so.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pshaw, dyun\', yes!" cried Mela, tasting the irony. "I guess I see\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\nHe asked if he might really introduce a friend of his to her, and she\r\nsaid, Well, yes, if he thought he could live to get to her; and March\r\nbrought up a man whom he thought very young and Mela thought very old. He\r\nwas a contributor to \'Every Other Week,\' and so March knew him; he\r\nbelieved himself a student of human nature in behalf of literature, and\r\nhe now set about studying Mela. He tempted her to express her opinion on\r\nall points, and he laughed so amiably at the boldness and humorous vigor\r\nof her ideas that she was delighted with him. She asked him if he was a\r\nNew-Yorker by birth; and she told him she pitied him, when he said he had\r\nnever been West. She professed herself perfectly sick of New York, and\r\nurged him to go to Moffitt if he wanted to see a real live town. He\r\nwondered if it would do to put her into literature just as she was, with\r\nall her slang and brag, but he decided that he would have to subdue her a\r\ngreat deal: he did not see how he could reconcile the facts of her\r\nconversation with the facts of her appearance: her beauty, her splendor\r\nof dress, her apparent right to be where she was. These things perplexed\r\nhim; he was afraid the great American novel, if true, must be incredible.\r\nMela said he ought to hear her sister go on about New York when they\r\nfirst came; but she reckoned that Christine was getting so she could put\r\nup with it a little better, now. She looked significantly across the room\r\nto the place where Christine was now talking with Beaton; and the student\r\nof human nature asked, Was she here? and, Would she introduce him? Mela\r\nsaid she would, the first chance she got; and she added, They would be\r\nmuch pleased to have him call. She felt herself to be having a beautiful\r\ntime, and she got directly upon such intimate terms with the student of\r\nhuman nature that she laughed with him about some peculiarities of his,\r\nsuch as his going so far about to ask things he wanted to know from her;\r\nshe said she never did believe in beating about the bush much. She had\r\nnoticed the same thing in Miss Vance when she came to call that day; and\r\nwhen the young man owned that he came rather a good deal to Mrs. Horn\'s\r\nhouse, she asked him, Well, what sort of a girl was Miss Vance, anyway,\r\nand where did he suppose she had met her brother? The student of human\r\nnature could not say as to this, and as to Miss Vance he judged it safest\r\nto treat of the non-society side of her character, her activity in\r\ncharity, her special devotion to the work among the poor on the East\r\nSide, which she personally engaged in.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s where Conrad goes, too!" Mela interrupted. "I\'ll bet anything\r\nthat\'s where she met him. I wisht I could tell Christine! But I suppose\r\nshe would want to kill me, if I was to speak to her now."\r\n\r\nThe student of human nature said, politely, "Oh, shall I take you to\r\nher?"\r\n\r\nMela answered, "I guess you better not!" with a laugh so significant that\r\nhe could not help his inferences concerning both Christine\'s absorption\r\nin the person she was talking with and the habitual violence of her\r\ntemper. He made note of how Mela helplessly spoke of all her family by\r\ntheir names, as if he were already intimate with them; he fancied that if\r\nhe could get that in skillfully, it would be a valuable color in his\r\nstudy; the English lord whom she should astonish with it began to form\r\nhimself out of the dramatic nebulosity in his mind, and to whirl on a\r\ndefinite orbit in American society. But he was puzzled to decide whether\r\nMela\'s willingness to take him into her confidence on short notice was\r\ntypical or personal: the trait of a daughter of the natural-gas\r\nmillionaire, or a foible of her own.\r\n\r\nBeaton talked with Christine the greater part of the evening that was\r\nleft after the concert. He was very grave, and took the tone of a\r\nfatherly friend; he spoke guardedly of the people present, and moderated\r\nthe severity of some of Christine\'s judgments of their looks and\r\ncostumes. He did this out of a sort of unreasoned allegiance to Margaret,\r\nwhom he was in the mood of wishing to please by being very kind and good,\r\nas she always was. He had the sense also of atoning by this behavior for\r\nsome reckless things he had said before that to Christine; he put on a\r\nsad, reproving air with her, and gave her the feeling of being held in\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nShe chafed at it, and said, glancing at Margaret in talk with her\r\nbrother, "I don\'t think Miss Vance is so very pretty, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I never think whether she\'s pretty or not," said Beaton, with dreamy,\r\naffectation. "She is merely perfect. Does she know your brother?"\r\n\r\n"So she says. I didn\'t suppose Conrad ever went anywhere, except to\r\ntenement-houses."\r\n\r\n"It might have been there," Beaton suggested. "She goes among friendless\r\npeople everywhere."\r\n\r\n"Maybe that\'s the reason she came to see us!" said Christine.\r\n\r\nBeaton looked at her with his smouldering eyes, and felt the wish to say,\r\n"Yes, it was exactly that," but he only allowed himself to deny the\r\npossibility of any such motive in that case. He added: "I am so glad you\r\nknow her, Miss Dryfoos. I never met Miss Vance without feeling myself\r\nbetter and truer, somehow; or the wish to be so."\r\n\r\n"And you think we might be improved, too?" Christine retorted. "Well, I\r\nmust say you\'re not very flattering, Mr. Beaton, anyway."\r\n\r\nBeaton would have liked to answer her according to her cattishness, with\r\na good clawing sarcasm that would leave its smart in her pride; but he\r\nwas being good, and he could not change all at once. Besides, the girl\'s\r\nattitude under the social honor done her interested him. He was sure she\r\nhad never been in such good company before, but he could see that she was\r\nnot in the least affected by the experience. He had told her who this\r\nperson and that was; and he saw she had understood that the names were of\r\nconsequence; but she seemed to feel her equality with them all. Her\r\nserenity was not obviously akin to the savage stoicism in which Beaton\r\nhid his own consciousness of social inferiority; but having won his way\r\nin the world so far by his talent, his personal quality, he did not\r\nconceive the simple fact in her case. Christine was self-possessed\r\nbecause she felt that a knowledge of her father\'s fortune had got around,\r\nand she had the peace which money gives to ignorance; but Beaton\r\nattributed her poise to indifference to social values. This, while he\r\ninwardly sneered at it, avenged him upon his own too keen sense of them,\r\nand, together with his temporary allegiance to Margaret\'s goodness, kept\r\nhim from retaliating Christine\'s vulgarity. He said, "I don\'t see how\r\nthat could be," and left the question of flattery to settle itself.\r\n\r\nThe people began to go away, following each other up to take leave of\r\nMrs. Horn. Christine watched them with unconcern, and either because she\r\nwould not be governed by the general movement, or because she liked being\r\nwith Beaton, gave no sign of going. Mela was still talking to the student\r\nof human nature, sending out her laugh in deep gurgles amid the\r\nunimaginable confidences she was making him about herself, her family,\r\nthe staff of \'Every Other Week,\' Mrs. Mandel, and the kind of life they\r\nhad all led before she came to them. He was not a blind devotee of art\r\nfor art\'s sake, and though he felt that if one could portray Mela just as\r\nshe was she would be the richest possible material, he was rather ashamed\r\nto know some of the things she told him; and he kept looking anxiously\r\nabout for a chance of escape. The company had reduced itself to the\r\nDryfoos groups and some friends of Mrs. Horn\'s who had the right to\r\nlinger, when Margaret crossed the room with Conrad to Christine and\r\nBeaton.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad, Miss Dryfoos, to find that I was not quite a stranger to\r\nyou all when I ventured to call, the other day. Your brother and I are\r\nrather old acquaintances, though I never knew who he was before. I don\'t\r\nknow just how to say we met where he is valued so much. I suppose I\r\nmustn\'t try to say how much," she added, with a look of deep regard at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nConrad blushed and stood folding his arms tight over his breast, while\r\nhis sister received Margaret\'s confession with the suspicion which was\r\nher first feeling in regard to any new thing. What she concluded was that\r\nthis girl was trying to get in with them, for reasons of her own. She\r\nsaid: "Yes; it\'s the first I ever heard of his knowing you. He\'s so much\r\ntaken up with his meetings, he didn\'t want to come to-night."\r\n\r\nMargaret drew in her lip before she answered, without apparent resentment\r\nof the awkwardness or ungraciousness, whichever she found it: "I don\'t\r\nwonder! You become so absorbed in such work that you think nothing else\r\nis worth while. But I\'m glad Mr. Dryfoos could come with you; I\'m so glad\r\nyou could all come; I knew you would enjoy the music. Do sit down--"\r\n\r\n"No," said Christine, bluntly; "we must be going. Mela!" she called out,\r\n"come!"\r\n\r\nThe last group about Mrs. Horn looked round, but Christine advanced upon\r\nthem undismayed, and took the hand Mrs. Horn promptly gave her. "Well, I\r\nmust bid you good-night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, good-night," murmured the elder lady. "So very kind of you to come."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had the best kind of a time," said Mela, cordially. "I hain\'t\r\nlaughed so much, I don\'t know when."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m glad you enjoyed it," said Mrs. Horn, in the same polite murmur\r\nshe had used with Christine; but she said nothing to either sister about\r\nany future meeting.\r\n\r\nThey were apparently not troubled. Mela said over her shoulder to the\r\nstudent of human nature, "The next time I see you I\'ll give it to you for\r\nwhat you said about Moffitt."\r\n\r\nMargaret made some entreating paces after them, but she did not succeed\r\nin covering the retreat of the sisters against critical conjecture. She\r\ncould only say to Conrad, as if recurring to the subject, "I hope we can\r\nget our friends to play for us some night. I know it isn\'t any real help,\r\nbut such things take the poor creatures out of themselves for the time\r\nbeing, don\'t you think?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," he answered. "They\'re good in that way." He turned back\r\nhesitatingly to Mrs. Horn, and said, with a blush, "I thank you for a\r\nhappy evening."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very glad," she replied, in her murmur.\r\n\r\nOne of the old friends of the house arched her eyebrows in saying\r\ngood-night, and offered the two young men remaining seats home in her\r\ncarriage. Beaton gloomily refused, and she kept herself from asking the\r\nstudent of human nature, till she had got him into her carriage, "What is\r\nMoffitt, and what did you say about it?"\r\n\r\n"Now you see, Margaret," said Mrs. Horn, with bated triumph, when the\r\npeople were all gone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," the girl consented. "From one point of view, of course it\'s\r\nbeen a failure. I don\'t think we\'ve given Miss Dryfoos a pleasure, but\r\nperhaps nobody could. And at least we\'ve given her the opportunity of\r\nenjoying herself."\r\n\r\n"Such people," said Mrs. Horn, philosophically, "people with their money,\r\nmust of course be received sooner or later. You can\'t keep them out.\r\nOnly, I believe I would rather let some one else begin with them. The\r\nLeightons didn\'t come?"\r\n\r\n"I sent them cards. I couldn\'t call again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Horn sighed a little. "I suppose Mr. Dryfoos is one of your\r\nfellow-philanthropists?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s one of the workers," said Margaret. "I met him several times at the\r\nHall, but I only knew his first name. I think he\'s a great friend of\r\nFather Benedict; he seems devoted to the work. Don\'t you think he looks\r\ngood?"\r\n\r\n"Very," said Mrs. Horn, with a color of censure in her assent. "The\r\nyounger girl seemed more amiable than her sister. But what manners!"\r\n\r\n"Dreadful!" said Margaret, with knit brows, and a pursed mouth of\r\nhumorous suffering. "But she appeared to feel very much at home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, as to that, neither of them was much abashed. Do you suppose Mr.\r\nBeaton gave the other one some hints for that quaint dress of hers? I\r\ndon\'t imagine that black and lace is her own invention. She seems to have\r\nsome sort of strange fascination for him."\r\n\r\n"She\'s very picturesque," Margaret explained. "And artists see points in\r\npeople that the rest of us don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Could it be her money?" Mrs. Horn insinuated. "He must be very poor."\r\n\r\n"But he isn\'t base," retorted the girl, with a generous indignation that\r\nmade her aunt smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh no; but if he fancies her so picturesque, it doesn\'t follow that he\r\nwould object to her being rich."\r\n\r\n"It would with a man like Mr. Beaton!"\r\n\r\n"You are an idealist, Margaret. I suppose your Mr. March has some\r\ndisinterested motive in paying court to Miss Mela--Pamela, I suppose, is\r\nher name. He talked to her longer than her literature would have lasted."\r\n\r\n"He seems a very kind person," said Margaret.\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Dryfoos pays his salary?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about that. But that wouldn\'t make any difference\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Horn laughed out at this security; but she was not displeased by the\r\nnobleness which it came from. She liked Margaret to be high-minded, and\r\nwas really not distressed by any good that was in her.\r\n\r\nThe Marches walked home, both because it was not far, and because they\r\nmust spare in carriage hire at any rate. As soon as they were out of the\r\nhouse, she applied a point of conscience to him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how you could talk to that girl so long, Basil, and make her\r\nlaugh so."\r\n\r\n"Why, there seemed no one else to do it, till I thought of Kendricks."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I kept thinking, Now he\'s pleasant to her because he thinks\r\nit\'s to his interest. If she had no relation to \'Every Other Week,\' he\r\nwouldn\'t waste his time on her."\r\n\r\n"Isabel," March complained, "I wish you wouldn\'t think of me in he, him,\r\nand his; I never personalize you in my thoughts: you remain always a\r\nvague unindividualized essence, not quite without form and void, but\r\nnounless and pronounless. I call that a much more beautiful mental\r\nattitude toward the object of one\'s affections. But if you must he and\r\nhim and his me in your thoughts, I wish you\'d have more kindly thoughts\r\nof me."\r\n\r\n"Do you deny that it\'s true, Basil?"\r\n\r\n"Do you believe that it\'s true, Isabel?"\r\n\r\n"No matter. But could you excuse it if it were?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, I see you\'d have been capable of it in my place, and you\'re\r\nashamed."\r\n\r\n"Yes," sighed the wife, "I\'m afraid that I should. But tell me that you\r\nwouldn\'t, Basil!"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you that I wasn\'t. But I suppose that in a real exigency, I\r\ncould truckle to the proprietary Dryfooses as well as you."\r\n\r\n"Oh no; you mustn\'t, dear! I\'m a woman, and I\'m dreadfully afraid. But\r\nyou must always be a man, especially with that horrid old Mr. Dryfoos.\r\nPromise me that you\'ll never yield the least point to him in a matter of\r\nright and wrong!"\r\n\r\n"Not if he\'s right and I\'m wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trifle, dear! You know what I mean. Will you promise?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll promise to submit the point to you, and let you do the yielding. As\r\nfor me, I shall be adamant. Nothing I like better."\r\n\r\n"They\'re dreadful, even that poor, good young fellow, who\'s so different\r\nfrom all the rest; he\'s awful, too, because you feel that he\'s a martyr\r\nto them."\r\n\r\n"And I never did like martyrs a great deal," March interposed.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how they came to be there," Mrs. March pursued, unmindful of\r\nhis joke.\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what seemed to be puzzling Miss Mela about us. She\r\nasked, and I explained as well as I could; and then she told me that Miss\r\nVance had come to call on them and invited them; and first they didn\'t\r\nknow how they could come till they thought of making Conrad bring them.\r\nBut she didn\'t say why Miss Vance called on them. Mr. Dryfoos doesn\'t\r\nemploy her on \'Every Other Week.\' But I suppose she has her own vile\r\nlittle motive."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be their money; it can\'t be!" sighed Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. We all respect money."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but Miss Vance\'s position is so secure. She needn\'t pay court to\r\nthose stupid, vulgar people."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s console ourselves with the belief that she would, if she\r\nneeded. Such people as the Dryfooses are the raw material of good\r\nsociety. It isn\'t made up of refined or meritorious people--professors\r\nand litterateurs, ministers and musicians, and their families. All the\r\nfashionable people there to-night were like the Dryfooses a generation or\r\ntwo ago. I dare say the material works up faster now, and in a season or\r\ntwo you won\'t know the Dryfooses from the other plutocrats. THEY will--a\r\nlittle better than they do now; they\'ll see a difference, but nothing\r\nradical, nothing painful. People who get up in the world by service to\r\nothers--through letters, or art, or science--may have their modest little\r\nmisgivings as to their social value, but people that rise by\r\nmoney--especially if their gains are sudden--never have. And that\'s the\r\nkind of people that form our nobility; there\'s no use pretending that we\r\nhaven\'t a nobility; we might as well pretend we haven\'t first-class cars\r\nin the presence of a vestibuled Pullman. Those girls had no more doubt of\r\ntheir right to be there than if they had been duchesses: we thought it\r\nwas very nice of Miss Vance to come and ask us, but they didn\'t; they\r\nweren\'t afraid, or the least embarrassed; they were perfectly\r\nnatural--like born aristocrats. And you may be sure that if the\r\nplutocracy that now owns the country ever sees fit to take on the outward\r\nsigns of an aristocracy--titles, and arms, and ancestors--it won\'t falter\r\nfrom any inherent question of its worth. Money prizes and honors itself,\r\nand if there is anything it hasn\'t got, it believes it can buy it."\r\n\r\n"Well, Basil," said his wife, "I hope you won\'t get infected with Lindau\'s\r\nideas of rich people. Some of them are very good and kind."\r\n\r\n"Who denies that? Not even Lindau himself. It\'s all right. And the great\r\nthing is that the evening\'s enjoyment is over. I\'ve got my society smile\r\noff, and I\'m radiantly happy. Go on with your little pessimistic\r\ndiatribes, Isabel; you can\'t spoil my pleasure."\r\n\r\n"I could see," said Mela, as she and Christine drove home together, "that\r\nshe was as jealous as she could be, all the time you was talkun\' to Mr.\r\nBeaton. She pretended to be talkun\' to Conrad, but she kep\' her eye on\r\nyou pretty close, I can tell you. I bet she just got us there to see how\r\nhim and you would act together. And I reckon she was satisfied. He\'s dead\r\ngone on you, Chris."\r\n\r\nChristine listened with a dreamy pleasure to the flatteries with which\r\nMela plied her in the hope of some return in kind, and not at all because\r\nshe felt spitefully toward Miss Vance, or in anywise wished her ill. "Who\r\nwas that fellow with you so long?" asked Christine. "I suppose you turned\r\nyourself inside out to him, like you always do."\r\n\r\nMela was transported by the cruel ingratitude. "It\'s a lie! I didn\'t tell\r\nhim a single thing."\r\n\r\nConrad walked home, choosing to do so because he did not wish to hear his\r\nsisters\' talk of the evening, and because there was a tumult in his\r\nspirit which he wished to let have its way. In his life with its single\r\npurpose, defeated by stronger wills than his own, and now struggling\r\npartially to fulfil itself in acts of devotion to others, the thought of\r\nwomen had entered scarcely more than in that of a child. His ideals were\r\nof a virginal vagueness; faces, voices, gestures had filled his fancy at\r\ntimes, but almost passionately; and the sensation that he now indulged\r\nwas a kind of worship, ardent, but reverent and exalted. The brutal\r\nexperiences of the world make us forget that there are such natures in\r\nit, and that they seem to come up out of the lowly earth as well as down\r\nfrom the high heaven. In the heart of this man well on toward thirty\r\nthere had never been left the stain of a base thought; not that\r\nsuggestion and conjecture had not visited him, but that he had not\r\nentertained them, or in any-wise made them his. In a Catholic age and\r\ncountry, he would have been one of those monks who are sainted after\r\ndeath for the angelic purity of their lives, and whose names are invoked\r\nby believers in moments of trial, like San Luigi Gonzaga. As he now\r\nwalked along thinking, with a lover\'s beatified smile on his face, of how\r\nMargaret Vance had spoken and looked, he dramatized scenes in which he\r\napproved himself to her by acts of goodness and unselfishness, and died\r\nto please her for the sake of others. He made her praise him for them, to\r\nhis face, when he disclaimed their merit, and after his death, when he\r\ncould not. All the time he was poignantly sensible of her grace, her\r\nelegance, her style; they seemed to intoxicate him; some tones of her\r\nvoice thrilled through his nerves, and some looks turned his brain with a\r\ndelicious, swooning sense of her beauty; her refinement bewildered him.\r\nBut all this did not admit the idea of possession, even of aspiration. At\r\nthe most his worship only set her beyond the love of other men as far as\r\nbeyond his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nPG EDITOR\'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Affectional habit\r\n    Brag of his wife, as a good husband always does\r\n    But when we make that money here, no one loses it\r\n    Courage hadn\'t been put to the test\r\n    Family buryin\' grounds\r\n    Homage which those who have not pay to those who have\r\n    Hurry up and git well--or something\r\n    Made money and do not yet know that money has made them\r\n    Society: All its favors are really bargains\r\n    Wages are the measure of necessity and not of merit\r\n    Without realizing his cruelty, treated as a child\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nNot long after Lent, Fulkerson set before Dryfoos one day his scheme for\r\na dinner in celebration of the success of \'Every Other Week.\' Dryfoos had\r\nnever meddled in any manner with the conduct of the periodical; but\r\nFulkerson easily saw that he was proud of his relation to it, and he\r\nproceeded upon the theory that he would be willing to have this relation\r\nknown: On the days when he had been lucky in stocks, he was apt to drop\r\nin at the office on Eleventh Street, on his way up-town, and listen to\r\nFulkerson\'s talk. He was on good enough terms with March, who revised his\r\nfirst impressions of the man, but they had not much to say to each other,\r\nand it seemed to March that Dryfoos was even a little afraid of him, as\r\nof a piece of mechanism he had acquired, but did not quite understand; he\r\nleft the working of it to Fulkerson, who no doubt bragged of it\r\nsufficiently. The old man seemed to have as little to say to his son; he\r\nshut himself up with Fulkerson, where the others could hear the manager\r\nbegin and go on with an unstinted flow of talk about \'Every Other Week;\'\r\nfor Fulkerson never talked of anything else if he could help it, and was\r\nalways bringing the conversation back to it if it strayed:\r\n\r\nThe day he spoke of the dinner he rose and called from his door: "March,\r\nI say, come down here a minute, will you? Conrad, I want you, too."\r\n\r\nThe editor and the publisher found the manager and the proprietor seated\r\non opposite sides of the table. "It\'s about those funeral baked meats,\r\nyou know," Fulkerson explained, "and I was trying to give Mr. Dryfoos\r\nsome idea of what we wanted to do. That is, what I wanted to do," he\r\ncontinued, turning from March to Dryfoos. "March, here, is opposed to it,\r\nof course. He\'d like to publish \'Every Other Week\' on the sly; keep it\r\nout of the papers, and off the newsstands; he\'s a modest Boston petunia,\r\nand he shrinks from publicity; but I am not that kind of herb myself, and\r\nI want all the publicity we can get--beg, borrow, or steal--for this\r\nthing. I say that you can\'t work the sacred rites of hospitality in a\r\nbetter cause, and what I propose is a little dinner for the purpose of\r\nrecognizing the hit we\'ve made with this thing. My idea was to strike you\r\nfor the necessary funds, and do the thing on a handsome scale. The term\r\nlittle dinner is a mere figure of speech. A little dinner wouldn\'t make a\r\nbig talk, and what we want is the big talk, at present, if we don\'t lay\r\nup a cent. My notion was that pretty soon after Lent, now, when everybody\r\nis feeling just right, we should begin to send out our paragraphs,\r\naffirmative, negative, and explanatory, and along about the first of May\r\nwe should sit down about a hundred strong, the most distinguished people\r\nin the country, and solemnize our triumph. There it is in a nutshell. I\r\nmight expand and I might expound, but that\'s the sum and substance of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nFulkerson stopped, and ran his eyes eagerly over the faces of his three\r\nlisteners, one after the other. March was a little surprised when Dryfoos\r\nturned to him, but that reference of the question seemed to give\r\nFulkerson particular pleasure: "What do you think, Mr. March?"\r\n\r\nThe editor leaned back in his chair. "I don\'t pretend to have Mr.\r\nFulkerson\'s genius for advertising; but it seems to me a little early\r\nyet. We might celebrate later when we\'ve got more to celebrate. At\r\npresent we\'re a pleasing novelty, rather than a fixed fact."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you don\'t get the idea!" said Fulkerson. "What we want to do with\r\nthis dinner is to fix the fact."\r\n\r\n"Am I going to come in anywhere?" the old man interrupted.\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to come in at the head of the procession! We are going to\r\nstrike everything that is imaginative and romantic in the newspaper soul\r\nwith you and your history and your fancy for going in for this thing. I\r\ncan start you in a paragraph that will travel through all the newspapers,\r\nfrom Maine to Texas and from Alaska to Florida. We have had all sorts of\r\nrich men backing up literary enterprises, but the natural-gas man in\r\nliterature is a new thing, and the combination of your picturesque past\r\nand your aesthetic present is something that will knock out the\r\nsympathies of the American public the first round. I feel," said\r\nFulkerson, with a tremor of pathos in his voice, "that \'Every Other Week\'\r\nis at a disadvantage before the public as long as it\'s supposed to be my\r\nenterprise, my idea. As far as I\'m known at all, I\'m known simply as a\r\nsyndicate man, and nobody in the press believes that I\'ve got the money\r\nto run the thing on a grand scale; a suspicion of insolvency must attach\r\nto it sooner or later, and the fellows on the press will work up that\r\nimpression, sooner or later, if we don\'t give them something else to work\r\nup. Now, as soon as I begin to give it away to the correspondents that\r\nyou\'re in it, with your untold millions--that, in fact, it was your idea\r\nfrom the start, that you originated it to give full play to the\r\nhumanitarian tendencies of Conrad here, who\'s always had these theories\r\nof co-operation, and longed to realize them for the benefit of our\r\nstruggling young writers and artists--"\r\n\r\nMarch had listened with growing amusement to the mingled burlesque and\r\nearnest of Fulkerson\'s self-sacrificing impudence, and with wonder as to\r\nhow far Dryfoos was consenting to his preposterous proposition, when\r\nConrad broke out: "Mr. Fulkerson, I could not allow you to do that. It\r\nwould not be true; I did not wish to be here; and--and what I think--what\r\nI wish to do--that is something I will not let any one put me in a false\r\nposition about. No!" The blood rushed into the young man\'s gentle face,\r\nand he met his father\'s glance with defiance.\r\n\r\nDryfoos turned from him to Fulkerson without speaking, and Fulkerson\r\nsaid, caressingly: "Why, of course, Coonrod! I know how you feel, and I\r\nshouldn\'t let anything of that sort go out uncontradicted afterward. But\r\nthere isn\'t anything in these times that would give us better standing\r\nwith the public than some hint of the way you feel about such things. The\r\npublic expects to be interested, and nothing would interest it more than\r\nto be told that the success of \'Every Other Week\' sprang from the first\r\napplication of the principle of Live and let Live to a literary\r\nenterprise. It would look particularly well, coming from you and your\r\nfather, but if you object, we can leave that part out; though if you\r\napprove of the principle I don\'t see why you need object. The main thing\r\nis to let the public know that it owes this thing to the liberal and\r\nenlightened spirit of one of the foremost capitalists of the country; and\r\nthat his purposes are not likely to be betrayed in the hands of his son,\r\nI should get a little cut made from a photograph of your father, and\r\nsupply it gratis with the paragraphs."\r\n\r\n"I guess," said the old man, "we will get along without the cut."\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed. "Well, well! Have it your own way, But the sight of\r\nyour face in the patent outsides of the country press would be worth half\r\na dozen subscribers in every school district throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of this fair land."\r\n\r\n"There was a fellow," Dryfoos explained, in an aside to March, "that was\r\ngetting up a history of Moffitt, and he asked me to let him put a steel\r\nengraving of me in. He said a good many prominent citizens were going to\r\nhave theirs in, and his price was a hundred and fifty dollars. I told him\r\nI couldn\'t let mine go for less than two hundred, and when he said he\r\ncould give me a splendid plate for that money, I said I should want it\r\ncash. You never saw a fellow more astonished when he got it through him\r\nthat I expected him to pay the two hundred."\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed in keen appreciation of the joke. "Well, sir, I guess\r\n\'Every Other Week\' will pay you that much. But if you won\'t sell at any\r\nprice, all right; we must try to worry along without the light of your\r\ncountenance on the posters, but we got to have it for the banquet."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t seem to feel very hungry, yet," said they old man, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'l\'appetit vient en mangeant\', as our French friends say. You\'ll be\r\nhungry enough when you see the preliminary Little Neck clam. It\'s too\r\nlate for oysters."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t that fact seem to point to a postponement till they get back,\r\nsometime in October," March suggested.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said Fulkerson, "you don\'t catch on to the business end of this\r\nthing, my friends. You\'re proceeding on something like the old exploded\r\nidea that the demand creates the supply, when everybody knows, if he\'s\r\nwatched the course of modern events, that it\'s just as apt to be the\r\nother way. I contend that we\'ve got a real substantial success to\r\ncelebrate now; but even if we hadn\'t, the celebration would do more than\r\nanything else to create the success, if we got it properly before the\r\npublic. People will say: Those fellows are not fools; they wouldn\'t go\r\nand rejoice over their magazine unless they had got a big thing in it.\r\nAnd the state of feeling we should produce in the public mind would make\r\na boom of perfectly unprecedented grandeur for E. O. W. Heigh?"\r\n\r\nHe looked sunnily from one to the other in succession. The elder Dryfoos\r\nsaid, with his chin on the top of his stick, "I reckon those Little Neck\r\nclams will keep."\r\n\r\n"Well, just as you say," Fulkerson cheerfully assented. "I understand you\r\nto agree to the general principle of a little dinner?"\r\n\r\n"The smaller the better," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"Well, I say a little dinner because the idea of that seems to cover the\r\ncase, even if we vary the plan a little. I had thought of a reception,\r\nmaybe, that would include the lady contributors and artists, and the\r\nwives and daughters of the other contributors. That would give us the\r\nchance to ring in a lot of society correspondents and get the thing\r\nwritten up in first-class shape. By-the-way!" cried Fulkerson, slapping\r\nhimself on the leg, "why not have the dinner and the reception both?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand," said Dryfoos.\r\n\r\n"Why, have a select little dinner for ten or twenty choice spirits of the\r\nmale persuasion, and then, about ten o\'clock, throw open your palatial\r\ndrawing-rooms and admit the females to champagne, salads, and ices. It is\r\nthe very thing! Come!"\r\n\r\n"What do you think of it, Mr. March?" asked Dryfoos, on whose social\r\ninexperience Fulkerson\'s words projected no very intelligible image, and\r\nwho perhaps hoped for some more light.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beautiful vision," said March, "and if it will take more time to\r\nrealize it I think I approve. I approve of anything that will delay Mr.\r\nFulkerson\'s advertising orgie."\r\n\r\n"Then," Fulkerson pursued, "we could have the pleasure of Miss Christine\r\nand Miss Mela\'s company; and maybe Mrs. Dryfoos would look in on us in\r\nthe course of the evening. There\'s no hurry, as Mr. March suggests, if we\r\ncan give the thing this shape. I will cheerfully adopt the idea of my\r\nhonorable colleague."\r\n\r\nMarch laughed at his impudence, but at heart he was ashamed of Fulkerson\r\nfor proposing to make use of Dryfoos and his house in that way. He\r\nfancied something appealing in the look that the old man turned on him,\r\nand something indignant in Conrad\'s flush; but probably this was only his\r\nfancy. He reflected that neither of them could feel it as people of more\r\nworldly knowledge would, and he consoled himself with the fact that\r\nFulkerson was really not such a charlatan as he seemed. But it went\r\nthrough his mind that this was a strange end for all Dryfoos\'s\r\nmoney-making to come to; and he philosophically accepted the fact of his\r\nown humble fortunes when he reflected how little his money could buy for\r\nsuch a man. It was an honorable use that Fulkerson was putting it to in\r\n\'Every Other Week;\' it might be far more creditably spent on such an\r\nenterprise than on horses, or wines, or women, the usual resources of the\r\nbrute rich; and if it were to be lost, it might better be lost that way\r\nthan in stocks. He kept a smiling face turned to Dryfoos while these\r\nirreverent considerations occupied him, and hardened his heart against\r\nfather and son and their possible emotions.\r\n\r\nThe old man rose to put an end to the interview. He only repeated, "I\r\nguess those clams will keep till fall."\r\n\r\nBut Fulkerson was apparently satisfied with the progress he had made; and\r\nwhen he joined March for the stroll homeward after office hours, he was\r\nable to detach his mind from the subject, as if content to leave it.\r\n\r\n"This is about the best part of the year in New York," he said; In some\r\nof the areas the grass had sprouted, and the tender young foliage had\r\nloosened itself from the buds on a sidewalk tree here and there; the\r\nsoft air was full of spring, and the delicate sky, far aloof, had the\r\nlook it never wears at any other season. "It ain\'t a time of year to\r\ncomplain much of, anywhere; but I don\'t want anything better than the\r\nmonth of May in New York. Farther South it\'s too hot, and I\'ve been in\r\nBoston in May when that east wind of yours made every nerve in my body\r\nget up and howl. I reckon the weather has a good deal to do with the\r\nlocal temperament. The reason a New York man takes life so easily with\r\nall his rush is that his climate don\'t worry him. But a Boston man must\r\nbe rasped the whole while by the edge in his air. That accounts for his\r\nsharpness; and when he\'s lived through twenty-five or thirty Boston Mays,\r\nhe gets to thinking that Providence has some particular use for him, or\r\nhe wouldn\'t have survived, and that makes him conceited. See?"\r\n\r\n"I see," said March. "But I don\'t know how you\'re going to work that idea\r\ninto an advertisement, exactly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, pahaw, now, March! You don\'t think I\'ve got that on the brain all\r\nthe time?"\r\n\r\n"You were gradually leading up to \'Every Other Week\', somehow."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I wasn\'t. I was just thinking what a different creature a\r\nMassachusetts man is from a Virginian. And yet I suppose they\'re both as\r\npure English stock as you\'ll get anywhere in America. Marsh, I think\r\nColonel Woodburn\'s paper is going to make a hit."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got there! When it knocks down the sale about one-half, I shall\r\nknow it\'s made a hit."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid," said Fulkerson. "That thing is going to attract\r\nattention. It\'s well written--you can take the pomposity out of it, here\r\nand there and it\'s novel. Our people like a bold strike, and it\'s going\r\nto shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moral\r\ngrounds as the only solution of the labor problem. You see, in the first\r\nplace, he goes for their sympathies by the way he portrays the actual\r\nrelations of capital and labor; he shows how things have got to go from\r\nbad to worse, and then he trots out his little old hobby, and proves that\r\nif slavery had not been interfered with, it would have perfected itself\r\nin the interest of humanity. He makes a pretty strong plea for it."\r\n\r\nMarch threw back his head and laughed. "He\'s converted you! I swear,\r\nFulkerson, if we had accepted and paid for an article advocating\r\ncannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluous poor,\r\nyou\'d begin to believe in it."\r\n\r\nFulkerson smiled in approval of the joke, and only said: "I wish you\r\ncould meet the colonel in the privacy of the domestic circle, March.\r\nYou\'d like him. He\'s a splendid old fellow; regular type. Talk about\r\nspring!\r\n\r\n"You ought to see the widow\'s little back yard these days. You know that\r\nglass gallery just beyond the dining-room? Those girls have got the\r\npot-plants out of that, and a lot more, and they\'ve turned the edges of\r\nthat back yard, along the fence, into a regular bower; they\'ve got sweet\r\npeas planted, and nasturtiums, and we shall be in a blaze of glory about\r\nthe beginning of June. Fun to see \'em work in the garden, and the bird\r\nbossing the job in his cage under the cherry-tree. Have to keep the\r\nmiddle of the yard for the clothesline, but six days in the week it\'s a\r\nlawn, and I go over it with a mower myself. March, there ain\'t anything\r\nlike a home, is there? Dear little cot of your own, heigh? I tell you,\r\nMarch, when I get to pushing that mower round, and the colonel is smoking\r\nhis cigar in the gallery, and those girls are pottering over the flowers,\r\none of these soft evenings after dinner, I feel like a human being. Yes,\r\nI do. I struck it rich when I concluded to take my meals at the widow\'s.\r\nFor eight dollars a week I get good board, refined society, and all the\r\nadvantages of a Christian home. By-the-way, you\'ve never had much talk\r\nwith Miss Woodburn, have you, March?"\r\n\r\n"Not so much as with Miss Woodburn\'s father."\r\n\r\n"Well, he is rather apt to scoop the conversation. I must draw his fire,\r\nsometime, when you and Mrs. March are around, and get you a chance with\r\nMiss Woodburn."\r\n\r\n"I should like that better, I believe," said March.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shouldn\'t wonder if you did. Curious, but Miss Woodburn isn\'t at\r\nall your idea of a Southern girl. She\'s got lots of go; she\'s never idle\r\na minute; she keeps the old gentleman in first-class shape, and she don\'t\r\nbelieve a bit in the slavery solution of the labor problem; says she\'s\r\nglad it\'s gone, and if it\'s anything like the effects of it, she\'s glad\r\nit went before her time. No, sir, she\'s as full of snap as the liveliest\r\nkind of a Northern girl. None of that sunny Southern languor you read\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"I suppose the typical Southerner, like the typical anything else, is\r\npretty difficult to find," said March. "But perhaps Miss Woodburn\r\nrepresents the new South. The modern conditions must be producing a\r\nmodern type."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s what she and the colonel both say. They say there ain\'t\r\nanything left of that Walter Scott dignity and chivalry in the rising\r\ngeneration; takes too much time. You ought to see her sketch the\r\nold-school, high-and-mighty manners, as they survive among some of the\r\nantiques in Charlottesburg. If that thing could be put upon the stage it\r\nwould be a killing success. Makes the old gentleman laugh in spite of\r\nhimself. But he\'s as proud of her as Punch, anyway. Why don\'t you and\r\nMrs. March come round oftener? Look here! How would it do to have a\r\nlittle excursion, somewhere, after the spring fairly gets in its work?"\r\n\r\n"Reporters present?"\r\n\r\n"No, no! Nothing of that kind; perfectly sincere and disinterested\r\nenjoyment."\r\n\r\n"Oh, a few handbills to be scattered around: \'Buy "Every Other Week",\' \'Look\r\nout for the next number of "Every Other Week,"\' "\'Every Other Week\' at all\r\nthe news-stands.\' Well, I\'ll talk it over with Mrs. March. I suppose\r\nthere\'s no great hurry."\r\n\r\nMarch told his wife of the idyllic mood in which he had left Fulkerson at\r\nthe widow\'s door, and she said he must be in love.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course! I wonder I didn\'t think of that. But Fulkerson is such\r\nan impartial admirer of the whole sex that you can\'t think of his liking\r\none more than another. I don\'t know that he showed any unjust partiality,\r\nthough, in his talk of \'those girls,\' as he called them. And I always\r\nrather fancied that Mrs. Mandel--he\'s done so much for her, you know; and\r\nshe is such a well-balanced, well-preserved person, and so lady-like and\r\ncorrect----"\r\n\r\n"Fulkerson had the word for her: academic. She\'s everything that\r\ninstruction and discipline can make of a woman; but I shouldn\'t think\r\nthey could make enough of her to be in love with."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. The academic has its charm. There are moods in which\r\nI could imagine myself in love with an academic person. That regularity\r\nof line; that reasoned strictness of contour; that neatness of pose; that\r\nslightly conventional but harmonious grouping of the emotions and\r\nmorals--you can see how it would have its charm, the Wedgwood in human\r\nnature? I wonder where Mrs. Mandel keeps her urn and her willow."\r\n\r\n"I should think she might have use for them in that family, poor thing!"\r\nsaid Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that reminds me," said her husband, "that we had another talk with\r\nthe old gentleman, this afternoon, about Fulkerson\'s literary, artistic,\r\nand advertising orgie, and it\'s postponed till October."\r\n\r\n"The later the better, I should think," said Mrs. March, who did not\r\nreally think about it at all, but whom the date fixed for it caused to\r\nthink of the intervening time. "We have got to consider what we will do\r\nabout the summer, before long, Basil."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not yet, not yet," he pleaded; with that man\'s willingness to abide\r\nin the present, which is so trying to a woman. "It\'s only the end of\r\nApril."\r\n\r\n"It will be the end of June before we know. And these people wanting the\r\nBoston house another year complicates it. We can\'t spend the summer\r\nthere, as we planned."\r\n\r\n"They oughtn\'t to have offered us an increased rent; they have taken an\r\nadvantage of us."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it matters," said Mrs. March. "I had decided not to go\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"Had you? This is a surprise."\r\n\r\n"Everything is a surprise to you, Basil, when it happens."\r\n\r\n"True; I keep the world fresh, that way."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t have been any change to go from one city to another for the\r\nsummer. We might as well have stayed in New York."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I wish we had stayed," said March, idly humoring a conception of\r\nthe accomplished fact. "Mrs. Green would have let us have the gimcrackery\r\nvery cheap for the summer months; and we could have made all sorts of\r\nnice little excursions and trips off and been twice as well as if we had\r\nspent the summer away."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You know we couldn\'t spend the summer in New York."\r\n\r\n"I know I could."\r\n\r\n"What stuff! You couldn\'t manage."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I could. I could take my meals at Fulkerson\'s widow\'s; or at\r\nMaroni\'s, with poor old Lindau: he\'s got to dining there again. Or, I\r\ncould keep house, and he could dine with me here."\r\n\r\nThere was a teasing look in March\'s eyes, and he broke into a laugh, at\r\nthe firmness with which his wife said: "I think if there is to be any\r\nhousekeeping, I will stay, too; and help to look after it. I would try\r\nnot intrude upon you and your guest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we should be only too glad to have you join us," said March, playing\r\nwith fire.\r\n\r\n"Very well, then, I wish you would take him off to Maroni\'s, the next\r\ntime he comes to dine here!" cried his wife.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of making March\'s old friend free of his house had not\r\ngiven her all the pleasure that so kind a thing ought to have afforded so\r\ngood a woman. She received Lindau at first with robust benevolence, and\r\nthe high resolve not to let any of his little peculiarities alienate her\r\nfrom a sense of his claim upon her sympathy and gratitude, not only as a\r\nman who had been so generously fond of her husband in his youth, but a\r\nhero who had suffered for her country. Her theory was that his mutilation\r\nmust not be ignored, but must be kept in mind as a monument of his\r\nsacrifice, and she fortified Bella with this conception, so that the\r\nchild bravely sat next his maimed arm at table and helped him to dishes\r\nhe could not reach, and cut up his meat for him. As for Mrs. March\r\nherself, the thought of his mutilation made her a little faint; she was\r\nnot without a bewildered resentment of its presence as a sort of\r\noppression. She did not like his drinking so much of March\'s beer,\r\neither; it was no harm, but it was somehow unworthy, out of character\r\nwith a hero of the war. But what she really could not reconcile herself\r\nto was the violence of Lindau\'s sentiments concerning the whole political\r\nand social fabric. She did not feel sure that he should be allowed to say\r\nsuch things before the children, who had been nurtured in the faith of\r\nBunker Hill and Appomattox, as the beginning and the end of all possible\r\nprogress in human rights. As a woman she was naturally an aristocrat, but\r\nas an American she was theoretically a democrat; and it astounded, it\r\nalarmed her, to hear American democracy denounced as a shuffling evasion.\r\nShe had never cared much for the United States Senate, but she doubted if\r\nshe ought to sit by when it was railed at as a rich man\'s club. It\r\nshocked her to be told that the rich and poor were not equal before the\r\nlaw in a country where justice must be paid for at every step in fees and\r\ncosts, or where a poor man must go to war in his own person, and a rich\r\nman might hire someone to go in his. Mrs. March felt that this rebellious\r\nmind in Lindau really somehow outlawed him from sympathy, and\r\nretroactively undid his past suffering for the country: she had always\r\nparticularly valued that provision of the law, because in forecasting all\r\nthe possible mischances that might befall her own son, she had been\r\ncomforted by the thought that if there ever was another war, and Tom were\r\ndrafted, his father could buy him a substitute. Compared with such\r\nblasphemy as this, Lindau\'s declaration that there was not equality of\r\nopportunity in America, and that fully one-half the people were debarred\r\ntheir right to the pursuit of happiness by the hopeless conditions of\r\ntheir lives, was flattering praise. She could not listen to such things\r\nin silence, though, and it did not help matters when Lindau met her\r\narguments with facts and reasons which she felt she was merely not\r\nsufficiently instructed to combat, and he was not quite gentlemanly to\r\nurge. "I am afraid for the effect on the children," she said to her\r\nhusband. "Such perfectly distorted ideas--Tom will be ruined by them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let Tom find out where they\'re false," said March. "It will be good\r\nexercise for his faculties of research. At any rate, those things are\r\ngetting said nowadays; he\'ll have to hear them sooner or later."\r\n\r\n"Had he better hear them at home?" demanded his wife.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know, as you\'re here to refute them, Isabel," he teased,\r\n"perhaps it\'s the best place. But don\'t mind poor old Lindau, my dear. He\r\nsays himself that his parg is worse than his pidte, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ah, it\'s too late now to mind him," she sighed. In a moment of rash good\r\nfeeling, or perhaps an exalted conception of duty, she had herself\r\nproposed that Lindau should come every week and read German with Tom; and\r\nit had become a question first how they could get him to take pay for it,\r\nand then how they could get him to stop it. Mrs. March never ceased to\r\nwonder at herself for having brought this about, for she had warned her\r\nhusband against making any engagement with Lindau which would bring him\r\nregularly to the house: the Germans stuck so, and were so unscrupulously\r\ndependent. Yet, the deed being done, she would not ignore the duty of\r\nhospitality, and it was always she who made the old man stay to their\r\nSunday-evening tea when he lingered near the hour, reading Schiller and\r\nHeine and Uhland with the boy, in the clean shirt with which he observed\r\nthe day; Lindau\'s linen was not to be trusted during the week. She now\r\nconcluded a season of mournful reflection by saying, "He will get you\r\ninto trouble, somehow, Basil."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know how, exactly. I regard Lindau as a political\r\neconomist of an unusual type; but I shall not let him array me against\r\nthe constituted authorities. Short of that, I think I am safe."\r\n\r\n"Well, be careful, Basil; be careful. You know you are so rash."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I may continue to pity him? He is such a poor, lonely old\r\nfellow. Are you really sorry he\'s come into our lives, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; not that. I feel as you do about it; but I wish I felt easier\r\nabout him--sure, that is, that we\'re not doing wrong to let him keep on\r\ntalking so."\r\n\r\n"I suspect we couldn\'t help it," March returned, lightly. "It\'s one of\r\nwhat Lindau calls his \'brincibles\' to say what he thinks."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Marches had no longer the gross appetite for novelty which urges\r\nyouth to a surfeit of strange scenes, experiences, ideas; and makes\r\ntravel, with all its annoyances and fatigues, an inexhaustible delight.\r\nBut there is no doubt that the chief pleasure of their life in New York\r\nwas from its quality of foreignness: the flavor of olives, which, once\r\ntasted, can never be forgotten. The olives may not be of the first\r\nexcellence; they may be a little stale, and small and poor, to begin\r\nwith, but they are still olives, and the fond palate craves them. The\r\nsort which grew in New York, on lower Sixth Avenue and in the region of\r\nJefferson Market and on the soft exposures south of Washington Square,\r\nwere none the less acceptable because they were of the commonest Italian\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThe Marches spent a good deal of time and money in a grocery of that\r\nnationality, where they found all the patriotic comestibles and potables,\r\nand renewed their faded Italian with the friendly family in charge.\r\nItalian table d\'hotes formed the adventure of the week, on the day when\r\nMrs. March let her domestics go out, and went herself to dine abroad with\r\nher husband and children; and they became adepts in the restaurants where\r\nthey were served, and which they varied almost from dinner to dinner. The\r\nperfect decorum of these places, and their immunity from offence in any,\r\nemboldened the Marches to experiment in Spanish restaurants, where red\r\npepper and beans insisted in every dinner, and where once they chanced\r\nupon a night of \'olla podrida\', with such appeals to March\'s memory of a\r\nboyish ambition to taste the dish that he became poetic and then pensive\r\nover its cabbage and carrots, peas and bacon. For a rare combination of\r\ninternational motives they prized most the table d\'hote of a French lady,\r\nwho had taken a Spanish husband in a second marriage, and had a Cuban\r\nnegro for her cook, with a cross-eyed Alsation for waiter, and a slim\r\nyoung South-American for cashier. March held that something of the\r\ncatholic character of these relations expressed itself in the generous\r\nand tolerant variety of the dinner, which was singularly abundant for\r\nfifty cents, without wine. At one very neat French place he got a dinner\r\nat the same price with wine, but it was not so abundant; and March\r\ninquired in fruitless speculation why the table d\'hote of the Italians, a\r\nnotoriously frugal and abstemious people, should be usually more than you\r\nwanted at seventy-five cents and a dollar, and that of the French rather\r\nless at half a dollar. He could not see that the frequenters were greatly\r\ndifferent at the different places; they were mostly Americans, of subdued\r\nmanners and conjecturably subdued fortunes, with here and there a table\r\nfull of foreigners. There was no noise and not much smoking anywhere;\r\nMarch liked going to that neat French place because there Madame sat\r\nenthroned and high behind a \'comptoir\' at one side of the room, and everybody\r\nsaluted her in going out. It was there that a gentle-looking young\r\ncouple used to dine, in whom the Marches became effectlessly interested,\r\nbecause they thought they looked like that when they were young. The wife\r\nhad an aesthetic dress, and defined her pretty head by wearing her\r\nback-hair pulled up very tight under her bonnet; the husband had dreamy\r\neyes set wide apart under a pure forehead. "They are artists, August, I\r\nthink," March suggested to the waiter, when he had vainly asked about\r\nthem. "Oh, hartis, cedenly," August consented; but Heaven knows whether\r\nthey were, or what they were: March never learned.\r\n\r\nThis immunity from acquaintance, this touch-and go quality in their New\r\nYork sojourn, this almost loss of individuality at times, after the\r\nintense identification of their Boston life, was a relief, though Mrs.\r\nMarch had her misgivings, and questioned whether it were not perhaps too\r\nrelaxing to the moral fibre. March refused to explore his conscience; he\r\nallowed that it might be so; but he said he liked now and then to feel\r\nhis personality in that state of solution. They went and sat a good deal\r\nin the softening evenings among the infants and dotards of Latin\r\nextraction in Washington Square, safe from all who ever knew them, and\r\nenjoyed the advancing season, which thickened the foliage of the trees\r\nand flattered out of sight the church warden\'s Gothic of the University\r\nBuilding. The infants were sometimes cross, and cried in their weary\r\nmothers\' or little sisters\' arms; but they did not disturb the dotards,\r\nwho slept, some with their heads fallen forward, and some with their\r\nheads fallen back; March arbitrarily distinguished those with the\r\ndrooping faces as tipsy and ashamed to confront the public. The small\r\nItalian children raced up and down the asphalt paths, playing American\r\ngames of tag and hide-and-whoop; larger boys passed ball, in training for\r\npotential championships. The Marches sat and mused, or quarrelled\r\nfitfully about where they should spend the summer, like sparrows, he once\r\nsaid, till the electric lights began to show distinctly among the leaves,\r\nand they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone and the\r\nbenches filled with lovers. That was the signal for the Marches to go\r\nhome. He said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eye might\r\ntake in there at a glance was not, perhaps, oppressive, but the thought\r\nthat at the same hour the same thing was going on all over the country,\r\nwherever two young fools could get together, was more than he could bear;\r\nhe did not deny that it was natural, and, in a measure authorized, but\r\nhe declared that it was hackneyed; and the fact that it must go on\r\nforever, as long as the race lasted, made him tired.\r\n\r\nAt home, generally, they found that the children had not missed them, and\r\nwere perfectly safe. It was one of the advantages of a flat that they\r\ncould leave the children there whenever they liked without anxiety. They\r\nliked better staying there than wandering about in the evening with their\r\nparents, whose excursions seemed to them somewhat aimless, and their\r\npleasures insipid. They studied, or read, or looked out of the window at\r\nthe street sights; and their mother always came back to them with a pang\r\nfor their lonesomeness. Bella knew some little girls in the house, but in\r\na ceremonious way; Tom had formed no friendships among the boys at school\r\nsuch as he had left in Boston; as nearly as he could explain, the New\r\nYork fellows carried canes at an age when they would have had them broken\r\nfor them by the other boys at Boston; and they were both sissyish and\r\nfast. It was probably prejudice; he never could say exactly what their\r\ndemerits were, and neither he nor Bella was apparently so homesick as\r\nthey pretended, though they answered inquirers, the one that New York was\r\na hole, and the other that it was horrid, and that all they lived for was\r\nto get back to Boston. In the mean time they were thrown much upon each\r\nother for society, which March said was well for both of them; he did not\r\nmind their cultivating a little gloom and the sense of a common wrong; it\r\nmade them better comrades, and it was providing them with amusing\r\nreminiscences for the future. They really enjoyed Bohemianizing in that\r\nharmless way: though Tom had his doubts of its respectability; he was\r\nvery punctilious about his sister, and went round from his own school\r\nevery day to fetch her home from hers. The whole family went to the\r\ntheatre a good deal, and enjoyed themselves together in their desultory\r\nexplorations of the city.\r\n\r\nThey lived near Greenwich Village, and March liked strolling through its\r\nquaintness toward the waterside on a Sunday, when a hereditary\r\nSabbatarianism kept his wife at home; he made her observe that it even\r\nkept her at home from church. He found a lingering quality of pure\r\nAmericanism in the region, and he said the very bells called to worship\r\nin a nasal tone. He liked the streets of small brick houses, with here\r\nand there one painted red, and the mortar lines picked out in white, and\r\nwith now and then a fine wooden portal of fluted pillars and a bowed\r\ntransom. The rear of the tenement-houses showed him the picturesqueness\r\nof clothes-lines fluttering far aloft, as in Florence; and the new\r\napartment-houses, breaking the old sky-line with their towering stories,\r\nimplied a life as alien to the American manner as anything in continental\r\nEurope. In fact, foreign faces and foreign tongues prevailed in Greenwich\r\nVillage, but no longer German or even Irish tongues or faces. The eyes\r\nand earrings of Italians twinkled in and out of the alleyways and\r\nbasements, and they seemed to abound even in the streets, where long\r\nranks of trucks drawn up in Sunday rest along the curbstones suggested\r\nthe presence of a race of sturdier strength than theirs. March liked the\r\nswarthy, strange visages; he found nothing menacing for the future in\r\nthem; for wickedness he had to satisfy himself as he could with the\r\nsneering, insolent, clean-shaven mug of some rare American of the b\'hoy\r\ntype, now almost as extinct in New York as the dodo or the volunteer\r\nfireman. When he had found his way, among the ash-barrels and the groups\r\nof decently dressed church-goers, to the docks, he experienced a\r\nsufficient excitement in the recent arrival of a French steamer, whose\r\nsheds were thronged with hacks and express-wagons, and in a tacit inquiry\r\ninto the emotions of the passengers, fresh from the cleanliness of Paris,\r\nand now driving up through the filth of those streets.\r\n\r\nSome of the streets were filthier than others; there was at least a\r\nchoice; there were boxes and barrels of kitchen offal on all the\r\nsidewalks, but not everywhere manure-heaps, and in some places the stench\r\nwas mixed with the more savory smell of cooking. One Sunday morning,\r\nbefore the winter was quite gone, the sight of the frozen refuse melting\r\nin heaps, and particularly the loathsome edges of the rotting ice near\r\nthe gutters, with the strata of waste-paper and straw litter, and\r\negg-shells and orange peel, potato-skins and cigar-stumps, made him\r\nunhappy. He gave a whimsical shrug for the squalor of the neighboring\r\nhouses, and said to himself rather than the boy who was with him: "It\'s\r\ncurious, isn\'t it, how fond the poor people are of these unpleasant\r\nthoroughfares? You always find them living in the worst streets."\r\n\r\n"The burden of all the wrong in the world comes on the poor," said the\r\nboy. "Every sort of fraud and swindling hurts them the worst. The city\r\nwastes the money it\'s paid to clean the streets with, and the poor have\r\nto suffer, for they can\'t afford to pay twice, like the rich."\r\n\r\nMarch stopped short. "Hallo, Tom! Is that your wisdom?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s what Mr. Lindau says," answered the boy, doggedly, as if not\r\npleased to have his ideas mocked at, even if they were second-hand.\r\n\r\n"And you didn\'t tell him that the poor lived in dirty streets because\r\nthey liked them, and were too lazy and worthless to have them cleaned?"\r\n\r\n"No; I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'m surprised. What do you think of Lindau, generally speaking, Tom?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I don\'t like the way he talks about some things. I don\'t\r\nsuppose this country is perfect, but I think it\'s about the best there\r\nis, and it don\'t do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time."\r\n\r\n"Sound, my son," said March, putting his hand on the boy\'s shoulder and\r\nbeginning to walk on. "Well?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, he says that it isn\'t the public frauds only that the poor\r\nhave to pay for, but they have to pay for all the vices of the rich; that\r\nwhen a speculator fails, or a bank cashier defaults, or a firm suspends,\r\nor hard times come, it\'s the poor who have to give up necessaries where\r\nthe rich give up luxuries."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! And then?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then I think the crank comes in, in Mr. Lindau. He says there\'s no\r\nneed of failures or frauds or hard times. It\'s ridiculous. There always\r\nhave been and there always will be. But if you tell him that, it seems to\r\nmake him perfectly furious."\r\n\r\nMarch repeated the substance of this talk to his wife. "I\'m glad to know\r\nthat Tom can see through such ravings. He has lots of good common sense."\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon of the same Sunday, and they were sauntering up\r\nFifth Avenue, and admiring the wide old double houses at the lower end;\r\nat one corner they got a distinct pleasure out of the gnarled elbows that\r\na pollarded wistaria leaned upon the top of a garden wall--for its\r\nconvenience in looking into the street, he said. The line of these\r\ncomfortable dwellings, once so fashionable, was continually broken by the\r\nfacades of shops; and March professed himself vulgarized by a want of\r\nstyle in the people they met in their walk to Twenty-third Street.\r\n\r\n"Take me somewhere to meet my fellow-exclusives, Isabel," he demanded. "I\r\npine for the society of my peers."\r\n\r\nHe hailed a passing omnibus, and made his wife get on the roof with him.\r\n"Think of our doing such a thing in Boston!" she sighed, with a little\r\nshiver of satisfaction in her immunity from recognition and comment.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be afraid to do it in London or Paris?"\r\n\r\n"No; we should be strangers there--just as we are in New York. I wonder\r\nhow long one could be a stranger here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indefinitely, in our way of living. The place is really vast, so\r\nmuch larger than it used to seem, and so heterogeneous."\r\n\r\nWhen they got down very far up-town, and began to walk back by Madison\r\nAvenue, they found themselves in a different population from that they\r\ndwelt among; not heterogeneous at all; very homogeneous, and almost\r\npurely American; the only qualification was American Hebrew. Such a\r\nwell-dressed, well-satisfied, well-fed looking crowd poured down the\r\nbroad sidewalks before the handsome, stupid houses that March could\r\neasily pretend he had got among his fellow-plutocrats at last. Still he\r\nexpressed his doubts whether this Sunday afternoon parade, which seemed\r\nto be a thing of custom, represented the best form among the young people\r\nof that region; he wished he knew; he blamed himself for becoming of a\r\nfastidious conjecture; he could not deny the fashion and the richness and\r\nthe indigeneity of the spectacle; the promenaders looked New-Yorky; they\r\nwere the sort of people whom you would know for New-Yorkers\r\nelsewhere,--so well equipped and so perfectly kept at all points. Their\r\nsilk hats shone, and their boots; their frocks had the right distension\r\nbehind, and their bonnets perfect poise and distinction.\r\n\r\nThe Marches talked of these and other facts of their appearance, and\r\ncuriously questioned whether this were the best that a great material\r\ncivilization could come to; it looked a little dull. The men\'s faces were\r\nshrewd and alert, and yet they looked dull; the women\'s were pretty and\r\nknowing, and yet dull. It was, probably, the holiday expression of the\r\nvast, prosperous commercial class, with unlimited money, and no ideals\r\nthat money could not realize; fashion and comfort were all that they\r\ndesired to compass, and the culture that furnishes showily, that\r\ndecorates and that tells; the culture, say, of plays and operas, rather\r\nthan books.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the observers did the promenaders injustice; they might not have\r\nbeen as common-minded as they looked. "But," March said, "I understand\r\nnow why the poor people don\'t come up here and live in this clean,\r\nhandsome, respectable quarter of the town; they would be bored to death.\r\nOn the whole, I think I should prefer Mott Street myself."\r\n\r\nIn other walks the Marches tried to find some of the streets they had\r\nwandered through the first day of their wedding journey in New York, so\r\nlong ago. They could not make sure of them; but once they ran down to the\r\nBattery, and easily made sure of that, though not in its old aspect. They\r\nrecalled the hot morning, when they sauntered over the trodden weed that\r\ncovered the sickly grass-plots there, and sentimentalized the sweltering\r\npaupers who had crept out of the squalid tenements about for a breath of\r\nair after a sleepless night. Now the paupers were gone, and where the old\r\nmansions that had fallen to their use once stood, there towered aloft and\r\nabroad those heights and masses of many-storied brick-work for which\r\narchitecture has yet no proper form and aesthetics no name. The trees and\r\nshrubs, all in their young spring green, blew briskly over the guarded\r\nturf in the south wind that came up over the water; and in the well-paved\r\nalleys the ghosts of eighteenth-century fashion might have met each other\r\nin their old haunts, and exchanged stately congratulations upon its\r\nvastly bettered condition, and perhaps puzzled a little over the colossal\r\nlady on Bedloe\'s Island, with her lifted torch, and still more over the\r\ncurving tracks and chalet-stations of the Elevated road. It is an outlook\r\nof unrivalled beauty across the bay, that smokes and flashes with the\r\ninnumerable stacks and sails of commerce, to the hills beyond, where the\r\nmoving forest of masts halts at the shore, and roots itself in the groves\r\nof the many villaged uplands. The Marches paid the charming prospects a\r\nwilling duty, and rejoiced in it as generously as if it had been their\r\nown. Perhaps it was, they decided. He said people owned more things in\r\ncommon than they were apt to think; and they drew the consolations of\r\nproprietorship from the excellent management of Castle Garden, which they\r\npenetrated for a moment\'s glimpse of the huge rotunda, where the\r\nimmigrants first set foot on our continent. It warmed their hearts, so\r\neasily moved to any cheap sympathy, to see the friendly care the nation\r\ntook of these humble guests; they found it even pathetic to hear the\r\nproper authority calling out the names of such as had kin or acquaintance\r\nwaiting there to meet them. No one appeared troubled or anxious; the\r\nofficials had a conscientious civility; the government seemed to manage\r\ntheir welcome as well as a private company or corporation could have\r\ndone. In fact, it was after the simple strangers had left the government\r\ncare that March feared their woes might begin; and he would have liked\r\nthe government to follow each of them to his home, wherever he meant to\r\nfix it within our borders. He made note of the looks of the licensed\r\nrunners and touters waiting for the immigrants outside the government\r\npremises; he intended to work them up into a dramatic effect in some\r\nsketch, but they remained mere material in his memorandum-book, together\r\nwith some quaint old houses on the Sixth Avenue road, which he had\r\nnoticed on the way down. On the way up, these were superseded in his\r\nregard by some hip-roof structures on the Ninth Avenue, which he thought\r\nmore Dutch-looking. The perspectives of the cross-streets toward the\r\nriver were very lively, with their turmoil of trucks and cars and carts\r\nand hacks and foot passengers, ending in the chimneys and masts of\r\nshipping, and final gleams of dancing water. At a very noisy corner,\r\nclangorous with some sort of ironworking, he made his wife enjoy with him\r\nthe quiet sarcasm of an inn that called itself the Home-like Hotel, and\r\nhe speculated at fantastic length on the gentle associations of one who\r\nshould have passed his youth under its roof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFirst and last, the Marches did a good deal of travel on the Elevated\r\nroads, which, he said, gave you such glimpses of material aspects in the\r\ncity as some violent invasion of others\' lives might afford in human\r\nnature. Once, when the impulse of adventure was very strong in them, they\r\nwent quite the length of the West Side lines, and saw the city pushing\r\nits way by irregular advances into the country. Some spaces, probably\r\nheld by the owners for that rise in value which the industry of others\r\nprovidentially gives to the land of the wise and good, it left vacant\r\ncomparatively far down the road, and built up others at remoter points.\r\nIt was a world of lofty apartment houses beyond the Park, springing up in\r\nisolated blocks, with stretches of invaded rusticity between, and here\r\nand there an old country-seat standing dusty in its budding vines with\r\nthe ground before it in rocky upheaval for city foundations. But wherever\r\nit went or wherever it paused, New York gave its peculiar stamp; and the\r\nadventurers were amused to find One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street\r\ninchoately like Twenty-third Street and Fourteenth Street in its shops\r\nand shoppers. The butchers\' shops and milliners\' shops on the avenue\r\nmight as well have been at Tenth as at One Hundredth Street.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers were not often so adventurous. They recognized that in\r\ntheir willingness to let their fancy range for them, and to let\r\nspeculation do the work of inquiry, they were no longer young. Their\r\npoint of view was singularly unchanged, and their impressions of New York\r\nremained the same that they had been fifteen years before: huge, noisy,\r\nugly, kindly, it seemed to them now as it seemed then. The main\r\ndifference was that they saw it more now as a life, and then they only\r\nregarded it as a spectacle; and March could not release himself from a\r\nsense of complicity with it, no matter what whimsical, or alien, or\r\ncritical attitude he took. A sense of the striving and the suffering\r\ndeeply possessed him; and this grew the more intense as he gained some\r\nknowledge of the forces at work--forces of pity, of destruction, of\r\nperdition, of salvation. He wandered about on Sunday not only through the\r\nstreets, but into this tabernacle and that, as the spirit moved him, and\r\nlistened to those who dealt with Christianity as a system of economics as\r\nwell as a religion. He could not get his wife to go with him; she\r\nlistened to his report of what he heard, and trembled; it all seemed\r\nfantastic and menacing. She lamented the literary peace, the intellectual\r\nrefinement of the life they had left behind them; and he owned it was\r\nvery pretty, but he said it was not life--it was death-in-life. She liked\r\nto hear him talk in that strain of virtuous self-denunciation, but she\r\nasked him, "Which of your prophets are you going to follow?" and he\r\nanswered: "All-all! And a fresh one every Sunday." And so they got their\r\nlaugh out of it at last, but with some sadness at heart, and with a dim\r\nconsciousness that they had got their laugh out of too many things in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhat really occupied and compassed his activities, in spite of his\r\nstrenuous reveries of work beyond it, was his editorship. On its social\r\nside it had not fulfilled all the expectations which Fulkerson\'s radiant\r\nsketch of its duties and relations had caused him to form of it. Most of\r\nthe contributions came from a distance; even the articles written in New\r\nYork reached him through the post, and so far from having his valuable\r\ntime, as they called it, consumed in interviews with his collaborators,\r\nhe rarely saw any of them. The boy on the stairs, who was to fence him\r\nfrom importunate visitors, led a life of luxurious disoccupation, and\r\nwhistled almost uninterruptedly. When any one came, March found himself\r\nembarrassed and a little anxious. The visitors were usually young men,\r\nterribly respectful, but cherishing, as he imagined, ideals and opinions\r\nchasmally different from his; and he felt in their presence something\r\nlike an anachronism, something like a fraud. He tried to freshen up his\r\nsympathies on them, to get at what they were really thinking and feeling,\r\nand it was some time before he could understand that they were not really\r\nthinking and feeling anything of their own concerning their art, but were\r\nnecessarily, in their quality of young, inexperienced men, mere\r\nacceptants of older men\'s thoughts and feelings, whether they were\r\ntremendously conservative, as some were, or tremendously progressive, as\r\nothers were. Certain of them called themselves realists, certain\r\nromanticists; but none of them seemed to know what realism was, or what\r\nromanticism; they apparently supposed the difference a difference of\r\nmaterial. March had imagined himself taking home to lunch or dinner the\r\naspirants for editorial favor whom he liked, whether he liked their work\r\nor not; but this was not an easy matter. Those who were at all\r\ninteresting seemed to have engagements and preoccupations; after two or\r\nthree experiments with the bashfuller sort--those who had come up to the\r\nmetropolis with manuscripts in their hands, in the good old literary\r\ntradition--he wondered whether he was otherwise like them when he was\r\nyoung like them. He could not flatter himself that he was not; and yet he\r\nhad a hope that the world had grown worse since his time, which his wife\r\nencouraged.\r\n\r\nMrs. March was not eager to pursue the hospitalities which she had at\r\nfirst imagined essential to the literary prosperity of \'Every Other\r\nWeek\'; her family sufficed her; she would willingly have seen no one out\r\nof it but the strangers at the weekly table-d\'hote dinner, or the\r\naudiences at the theatres. March\'s devotion to his work made him\r\nreluctant to delegate it to any one; and as the summer advanced, and the\r\nquestion of where to go grew more vexed, he showed a man\'s base\r\nwillingness to shirk it for himself by not going anywhere. He asked his\r\nwife why she did not go somewhere with the children, and he joined her in\r\na search for non-malarial regions on the map when she consented to\r\nentertain this notion. But when it came to the point she would not go; he\r\noffered to go with her then, and then she would not let him. She said she\r\nknew he would be anxious about his work; he protested that he could take\r\nit with him to any distance within a few hours, but she would not be\r\npersuaded. She would rather he stayed; the effect would be better with\r\nMr. Fulkerson; they could make excursions, and they could all get off a\r\nweek or two to the seashore near Boston--the only real seashore--in\r\nAugust. The excursions were practically confined to a single day at Coney\r\nIsland; and once they got as far as Boston on the way to the seashore\r\nnear Boston; that is, Mrs. March and the children went; an editorial\r\nexigency kept March at the last moment. The Boston streets seemed very\r\nqueer and clean and empty to the children, and the buildings little; in\r\nthe horse-cars the Boston faces seemed to arraign their mother with a\r\ndown-drawn severity that made her feel very guilty. She knew that this\r\nwas merely the Puritan mask, the cast of a dead civilization, which\r\npeople of very amiable and tolerant minds were doomed to wear, and she\r\nsighed to think that less than a year of the heterogeneous gayety of New\r\nYork should have made her afraid of it. The sky seemed cold and gray; the\r\neast wind, which she had always thought so delicious in summer, cut her\r\nto the heart. She took her children up to the South End, and in the\r\npretty square where they used to live they stood before their alienated\r\nhome, and looked up at its close-shuttered windows. The tenants must have\r\nbeen away, but Mrs. March had not the courage to ring and make sure,\r\nthough she had always promised herself that she would go all over the\r\nhouse when she came back, and see how they had used it; she could pretend\r\na desire for something she wished to take away. She knew she could not\r\nbear it now; and the children did not seem eager. She did not push on to\r\nthe seaside; it would be forlorn there without their father; she was glad\r\nto go back to him in the immense, friendly homelessness of New York, and\r\nhold him answerable for the change, in her heart or her mind, which made\r\nits shapeless tumult a refuge and a consolation.\r\n\r\nShe found that he had been giving the cook a holiday, and dining about\r\nhither and thither with Fulkerson. Once he had dined with him at the\r\nwidow\'s (as they always called Mrs. Leighton), and then had spent the\r\nevening there, and smoked with Fulkerson and Colonel Woodburn on the\r\ngallery overlooking the back yard. They were all spending the summer in\r\nNew York. The widow had got so good an offer for her house at St. Barnaby\r\nfor the summer that she could not refuse it; and the Woodburns found New\r\nYork a watering-place of exemplary coolness after the burning Augusts and\r\nSeptembers of Charlottesburg.\r\n\r\n"You can stand it well enough in our climate, sir," the colonel\r\nexplained, "till you come to the September heat, that sometimes runs well\r\ninto October; and then you begin to lose your temper, sir. It\'s never\r\nquite so hot as it is in New York at times, but it\'s hot longer, sir." He\r\nalleged, as if something of the sort were necessary, the example of a\r\nfamous Southwestern editor who spent all his summers in a New York hotel\r\nas the most luxurious retreat on the continent, consulting the weather\r\nforecasts, and running off on torrid days to the mountains or the sea,\r\nand then hurrying back at the promise of cooler weather. The colonel had\r\nnot found it necessary to do this yet; and he had been reluctant to leave\r\ntown, where he was working up a branch of the inquiry which had so long\r\noccupied him, in the libraries, and studying the great problem of labor\r\nand poverty as it continually presented itself to him in the streets. He\r\nsaid that he talked with all sorts of people, whom he found monstrously\r\ncivil, if you took them in the right way; and he went everywhere in the\r\ncity without fear and apparently without danger. March could not find out\r\nthat he had ridden his hobby into the homes of want which he visited, or\r\nhad proposed their enslavement to the inmates as a short and simple\r\nsolution of the great question of their lives; he appeared to have\r\ncontented himself with the collection of facts for the persuasion of the\r\ncultivated classes. It seemed to March a confirmation of this impression\r\nthat the colonel should address his deductions from these facts so\r\nunsparingly to him; he listened with a respectful patience, for which\r\nFulkerson afterward personally thanked him. Fulkerson said it was not\r\noften the colonel found such a good listener; generally nobody listened\r\nbut Mrs. Leighton, who thought his ideas were shocking, but honored him\r\nfor holding them so conscientiously. Fulkerson was glad that March, as\r\nthe literary department, had treated the old gentleman so well, because\r\nthere was an open feud between him and the art department. Beaton was\r\noutrageously rude, Fulkerson must say; though as for that, the old\r\ncolonel seemed quite able to take care of himself, and gave Beaton an\r\nunqualified contempt in return for his unmannerliness. The worst of it\r\nwas, it distressed the old lady so; she admired Beaton as much as she\r\nrespected the colonel, and she admired Beaton, Fulkerson thought, rather\r\nmore than Miss Leighton did; he asked March if he had noticed them\r\ntogether. March had noticed them, but without any very definite\r\nimpression except that Beaton seemed to give the whole evening to the\r\ngirl. Afterward he recollected that he had fancied her rather harassed by\r\nhis devotion, and it was this point that he wished to present for his\r\nwife\'s opinion.\r\n\r\n"Girls often put on that air," she said. "It\'s one of their ways of\r\nteasing. But then, if the man was really very much in love, and she was\r\nonly enough in love to be uncertain of herself, she might very well seem\r\ntroubled. It would be a very serious question. Girls often don\'t know\r\nwhat to do in such a case."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said March, "I\'ve often been glad that I was not a girl, on that\r\naccount. But I guess that on general principles Beaton is not more in\r\nlove than she is. I couldn\'t imagine that young man being more in love\r\nwith anybody, unless it was himself. He might be more in love with\r\nhimself than any one else was."\r\n\r\n"Well, he doesn\'t interest me a great deal, and I can\'t say Miss Leighton\r\ndoes, either. I think she can take care of herself. She has herself very\r\nwell in hand."\r\n\r\n"Why so censorious?" pleaded March. "I don\'t defend her for having\r\nherself in hand; but is it a fault?"\r\n\r\nMrs. March did not say. She asked, "And how does Mr. Fulkerson\'s affair\r\nget on?"\r\n\r\n"His affair? You really think it is one? Well, I\'ve fancied so myself,\r\nand I\'ve had an idea of some time asking him; Fulkerson strikes one as\r\ntruly domesticable, conjugable at heart; but I\'ve waited for him to\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\n"I should think so."\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'s never opened on the subject yet. Do you know, I think\r\nFulkerson has his moments of delicacy."\r\n\r\n"Moments! He\'s all delicacy in regard to women."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps so. There is nothing in them to rouse his advertising\r\ninstincts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Dryfoos family stayed in town till August. Then the father went West\r\nagain to look after his interests; and Mrs. Mandel took the two girls to\r\none of the great hotels in Saratoga. Fulkerson said that he had never\r\nseen anything like Saratoga for fashion, and Mrs. Mandel remembered that\r\nin her own young ladyhood this was so for at least some weeks of the\r\nyear. She had been too far withdrawn from fashion since her marriage to\r\nknow whether it was still so or not. In this, as in so many other\r\nmatters, the Dryfoos family helplessly relied upon Fulkerson, in spite of\r\nDryfoos\'s angry determination that he should not run the family, and in\r\nspite of Christine\'s doubt of his omniscience; if he did not know\r\neverything, she was aware that he knew more than herself. She thought\r\nthat they had a right to have him go with them to Saratoga, or at least\r\ngo up and engage their rooms beforehand; but Fulkerson did not offer to\r\ndo either, and she did not quite see her way to commanding his services.\r\nThe young ladies took what Mela called splendid dresses with them; they\r\nsat in the park of tall, slim trees which the hotel\'s quadrangle\r\nenclosed, and listened to the music in the morning, or on the long piazza\r\nin the afternoon and looked at the driving in the street, or in the vast\r\nparlors by night, where all the other ladies were, and they felt that\r\nthey were of the best there. But they knew nobody, and Mrs. Mandel was so\r\nparticular that Mela was prevented from continuing the acquaintance even\r\nof the few young men who danced with her at the Saturday-night hops. They\r\ndrove about, but they went to places without knowing why, except that the\r\ncarriage man took them, and they had all the privileges of a proud\r\nexclusivism without desiring them. Once a motherly matron seemed to\r\nperceive their isolation, and made overtures to them, but then desisted,\r\nas if repelled by Christine\'s suspicion, or by Mela\'s too instant and\r\nhilarious good-fellowship, which expressed itself in hoarse laughter and\r\nin a flow of talk full of topical and syntactical freedom. From time to\r\ntime she offered to bet Christine that if Mr. Fulkerson was only there\r\nthey would have a good time; she wondered what they were all doing in New\r\nYork, where she wished herself; she rallied her sister about Beaton, and\r\nasked her why she did not write and tell him to come up there.\r\n\r\nMela knew that Christine had expected Beaton to follow them. Some banter\r\nhad passed between them to this effect; he said he should take them in on\r\nhis way home to Syracuse. Christine would not have hesitated to write to\r\nhim and remind him of his promise; but she had learned to distrust her\r\nliterature with Beaton since he had laughed at the spelling in a scrap of\r\nwriting which dropped out of her music-book one night. She believed that\r\nhe would not have laughed if he had known it was hers; but she felt that\r\nshe could hide better the deficiencies which were not committed to paper;\r\nshe could manage with him in talking; she was too ignorant of her\r\nignorance to recognize the mistakes she made then. Through her own\r\npassion she perceived that she had some kind of fascination for him; she\r\nwas graceful, and she thought it must be that; she did not understand\r\nthat there was a kind of beauty in her small, irregular features that\r\npiqued and haunted his artistic sense, and a look in her black eyes\r\nbeyond her intelligence and intention. Once he sketched her as they sat\r\ntogether, and flattered the portrait without getting what he wanted in\r\nit; he said he must try her some time in color; and he said things which,\r\nwhen she made Mela repeat them, could only mean that he admired her more\r\nthan anybody else. He came fitfully, but he came often, and she rested\r\ncontent in a girl\'s indefiniteness concerning the affair; if her thought\r\nwent beyond lovemaking to marriage, she believed that she could have him\r\nif she wanted him. Her father\'s money counted in this; she divined that\r\nBeaton was poor; but that made no difference; she would have enough for\r\nboth; the money would have counted as an irresistible attraction if there\r\nhad been no other.\r\n\r\nThe affair had gone on in spite of the sidelong looks of restless dislike\r\nwith which Dryfoos regarded it; but now when Beaton did not come to\r\nSaratoga it necessarily dropped, and Christine\'s content with it. She\r\nbore the trial as long as she could; she used pride and resentment\r\nagainst it; but at last she could not bear it, and with Mela\'s help she\r\nwrote a letter, bantering Beaton on his stay in New York, and playfully\r\nboasting of Saratoga. It seemed to them both that it was a very bright\r\nletter, and would be sure to bring him; they would have had no scruple\r\nabout sending it but for the doubt they had whether they had got some of\r\nthe words right. Mela offered to bet Christine anything she dared that\r\nthey were right, and she said, Send it anyway; it was no difference if\r\nthey were wrong. But Christine could not endure to think of that laugh of\r\nBeaton\'s, and there remained only Mrs. Mandel as authority on the\r\nspelling. Christine dreaded her authority on other points, but Mela said\r\nshe knew she would not interfere, and she undertook to get round her.\r\nMrs. Mandel pronounced the spelling bad, and the taste worse; she forbade\r\nthem to send the letter; and Mela failed to get round her, though she\r\nthreatened, if Mrs. Mandel would not tell her how to spell the wrong\r\nwords, that she would send the letter as it was; then Mrs. Mandel said\r\nthat if Mr. Beaton appeared in Saratoga she would instantly take them\r\nboth home. When Mela reported this result, Christine accused her of\r\nhaving mismanaged the whole business; she quarrelled with her, and they\r\ncalled each other names. Christine declared that she would not stay in\r\nSaratoga, and that if Mrs. Mandel did not go back to New York with her\r\nshe should go alone. They returned the first week in September; but by\r\nthat time Beaton had gone to see his people in Syracuse.\r\n\r\nConrad Dryfoos remained at home with his mother after his father went\r\nWest. He had already taken such a vacation as he had been willing to\r\nallow himself, and had spent it on a charity farm near the city, where\r\nthe fathers with whom he worked among the poor on the East Side in the\r\nwinter had sent some of their wards for the summer. It was not possible\r\nto keep his recreation a secret at the office, and Fulkerson found a\r\npleasure in figuring the jolly time Brother Conrad must have teaching\r\nfarm work among those paupers and potential reprobates. He invented\r\ndetails of his experience among them, and March could not always help\r\njoining in the laugh at Conrad\'s humorless helplessness under Fulkerson\'s\r\nburlesque denunciation of a summer outing spent in such dissipation.\r\n\r\nThey had time for a great deal of joking at the office during the season\r\nof leisure which penetrates in August to the very heart of business, and\r\nthey all got on terms of greater intimacy if not greater friendliness\r\nthan before. Fulkerson had not had so long to do with the advertising\r\nside of human nature without developing a vein of cynicism, of no great\r\ndepth, perhaps, but broad, and underlying his whole point of view; he\r\nmade light of Beaton\'s solemnity, as he made light of Conrad\'s humanity.\r\nThe art editor, with abundant sarcasm, had no more humor than the\r\npublisher, and was an easy prey in the manager\'s hands; but when he had\r\nbeen led on by Fulkerson\'s flatteries to make some betrayal of egotism,\r\nhe brooded over it till he had thought how to revenge himself in\r\nelaborate insult. For Beaton\'s talent Fulkerson never lost his\r\nadmiration; but his joke was to encourage him to give himself airs of\r\nbeing the sole source of the magazine\'s prosperity. No bait of this sort\r\nwas too obvious for Beaton to swallow; he could be caught with it as\r\noften as Fulkerson chose; though he was ordinarily suspicious as to the\r\nmotives of people in saying things. With March he got on no better than\r\nat first. He seemed to be lying in wait for some encroachment of the\r\nliterary department on the art department, and he met it now and then\r\nwith anticipative reprisal. After these rebuffs, the editor delivered him\r\nover to the manager, who could turn Beaton\'s contrary-mindedness to\r\naccount by asking the reverse of what he really wanted done. This was\r\nwhat Fulkerson said; the fact was that he did get on with Beaton and\r\nMarch contented himself with musing upon the contradictions of a\r\ncharacter at once so vain and so offensive, so fickle and so sullen, so\r\nconscious and so simple.\r\n\r\nAfter the first jarring contact with Dryfoos, the editor ceased to feel\r\nthe disagreeable fact of the old man\'s mastery of the financial\r\nsituation. None of the chances which might have made it painful occurred;\r\nthe control of the whole affair remained in Fulkerson\'s hands; before he\r\nwent West again, Dryfoos had ceased to come about the office, as if,\r\nhaving once worn off the novelty of the sense of owning a literary\r\nperiodical, he was no longer interested in it.\r\n\r\nYet it was a relief, somehow, when he left town, which he did not do\r\nwithout coming to take a formal leave of the editor at his office. He\r\nseemed willing to leave March with a better impression than he had\r\nhitherto troubled himself to make; he even said some civil things about\r\nthe magazine, as if its success pleased him; and he spoke openly to March\r\nof his hope that his son would finally become interested in it to the\r\nexclusion of the hopes and purposes which divided them. It seemed to\r\nMarch that in the old man\'s warped and toughened heart he perceived a\r\ndisappointed love for his son greater than for his other children; but\r\nthis might have been fancy. Lindau came in with some copy while Dryfoos\r\nwas there, and March introduced them. When Lindau went out, March\r\nexplained to Dryfoos that he had lost his hand in the war; and he told\r\nhim something of Lindau\'s career as he had known it. Dryfoos appeared\r\ngreatly pleased that \'Every Other Week\' was giving Lindau work. He said\r\nthat he had helped to enlist a good many fellows for the war, and had\r\npaid money to fill up the Moffitt County quota under the later calls for\r\ntroops. He had never been an Abolitionist, but he had joined the\r\nAnti-Nebraska party in \'55, and he had voted for Fremont and for every\r\nRepublican President since then.\r\n\r\nAt his own house March saw more of Lindau than of any other contributor,\r\nbut the old man seemed to think that he must transact all his business\r\nwith March at his place of business. The transaction had some\r\npeculiarities which perhaps made this necessary. Lindau always expected\r\nto receive his money when he brought his copy, as an acknowledgment of\r\nthe immediate right of the laborer to his hire; and he would not take it\r\nin a check because he did not approve of banks, and regarded the whole\r\nsystem of banking as the capitalistic manipulation of the people\'s money.\r\nHe would receive his pay only from March\'s hand, because he wished to be\r\nunderstood as working for him, and honestly earning money honestly\r\nearned; and sometimes March inwardly winced a little at letting the old\r\nman share the increase of capital won by such speculation as Dryfoos\'s,\r\nbut he shook off the feeling. As the summer advanced, and the artists and\r\nclasses that employed Lindau as a model left town one after another, he\r\ngave largely of his increasing leisure to the people in the office of\r\n\'Every Other Week.\' It was pleasant for March to see the respect with\r\nwhich Conrad Dryfoos always used him, for the sake of his hurt and his\r\ngray beard. There was something delicate and fine in it, and there was\r\nnothing unkindly on Fulkerson\'s part in the hostilities which usually\r\npassed between himself and Lindau. Fulkerson bore himself reverently at\r\ntimes, too, but it was not in him to keep that up, especially when Lindau\r\nappeared with more beer aboard than, as Fulkerson said, he could manage\r\nshipshape. On these occasions Fulkerson always tried to start him on the\r\ntheme of the unduly rich; he made himself the champion of monopolies, and\r\nenjoyed the invectives which Lindau heaped upon him as a slave of\r\ncapital; he said that it did him good.\r\n\r\nOne day, with the usual show of writhing under Lindau\'s scorn, he said,\r\n"Well, I understand that although you despise me now, Lindau--"\r\n\r\n"I ton\'t desbise you," the old man broke in, his nostrils swelling and\r\nhis eyes flaming with excitement, "I bity you."\r\n\r\n"Well, it seems to come to the same thing in the end," said Fulkerson.\r\n"What I understand is that you pity me now as the slave of capital, but\r\nyou would pity me a great deal more if I was the master of it."\r\n\r\n"How you mean?"\r\n\r\n"If I was rich."\r\n\r\n"That would tebendt," said Lindau, trying to control himself. "If you hat\r\ninheritedt your money, you might pe innocent; but if you hat mate it,\r\nefery man that resbectedt himself would haf to ask how you mate it, and\r\nif you hat mate moch, he would know--"\r\n\r\n"Hold on; hold on, now, Lindau! Ain\'t that rather un-American doctrine?\r\nWe\'re all brought up, ain\'t we, to honor the man that made his money, and\r\nlook down--or try to look down; sometimes it\'s difficult on the fellow\r\nthat his father left it to?"\r\n\r\nThe old man rose and struck his breast. "On Amerigan!" he roared, and, as\r\nhe went on, his accent grew more and more uncertain. "What iss Amerigan?\r\nDere iss no Ameriga any more! You start here free and brafe, and you\r\nglaim for efery man de right to life, liperty, and de bursuit of\r\nhabbiness. And where haf you entedt? No man that vorks vith his handts\r\namong you has the liperty to bursue his habbiness. He iss the slafe of\r\nsome richer man, some gompany, some gorporation, dat crindt him down to\r\nthe least he can lif on, and that rops him of the marchin of his earnings\r\nthat he knight pe habby on. Oh, you Amerigans, you haf cot it down goldt,\r\nas you say! You ton\'t puy foters; you puy lechislatures and goncressmen;\r\nyou puy gourts; you puy gombetitors; you pay infentors not to infent; you\r\natfertise, and the gounting-room sees dat de etitorial-room toesn\'t\r\ntink."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'ve got a little arrangement of that sort with March here," said\r\nFulkerson.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am sawry," said the old man, contritely, "I meant noting bersonal.\r\nI ton\'t tink we are all cuilty or gorrubt, and efen among the rich there\r\nare goodt men. But gabidal"--his passion rose again--"where you find\r\ngabidal, millions of money that a man hass cot togeder in fife, ten,\r\ntwenty years, you findt the smell of tears and ploodt! Dat iss what I\r\nsay. And you cot to loog oudt for yourself when you meet a rich man\r\nwhether you meet an honest man."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fulkerson, "I wish I was a subject of suspicion with you,\r\nLindau. By-the-way," he added, "I understand that you think capital was\r\nat the bottom of the veto of that pension of yours."\r\n\r\n"What bension? What feto?"--The old man flamed up again. "No bension of\r\nmine was efer fetoedt. I renounce my bension, begause I would sgorn to\r\ndake money from a gofernment that I ton\'t peliefe in any more. Where you\r\nhear that story?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said Fulkerson, rather embarrassed. "It\'s common\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a gommon lie, then! When the time gome dat dis iss a free gountry\r\nagain, then I dake a bension again for my woundts; but I would sdarfe\r\nbefore I dake a bension now from a rebublic dat iss bought oap by\r\nmonobolies, and ron by drusts and gompines, and railroadts andt oil\r\ngompanies."\r\n\r\n"Look out, Lindau," said Fulkerson. "You bite yourself mit dat dog some\r\nday." But when the old man, with a ferocious gesture of renunciation,\r\nwhirled out of the place, he added: "I guess I went a little too far that\r\ntime. I touched him on a sore place; I didn\'t mean to; I heard some talk\r\nabout his pension being vetoed from Miss Leighton." He addressed these\r\nexculpations to March\'s grave face, and to the pitying deprecation in the\r\neyes of Conrad Dryfoos, whom Lindau\'s roaring wrath had summoned to the\r\ndoor. "But I\'ll make it all right with him the next time he comes. I\r\ndidn\'t know he was loaded, or I wouldn\'t have monkeyed with him."\r\n\r\n"Lindau does himself injustice when he gets to talking in that way," said\r\nMarch. "I hate to hear him. He\'s as good an American as any of us; and\r\nit\'s only because he has too high an ideal of us--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, go on! Rub it in--rub it in!" cried Fulkerson, clutching his hair in\r\nsuffering, which was not altogether burlesque. "How did I know he had\r\nrenounced his \'bension\'? Why didn\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know it myself. I only knew that he had none, and I didn\'t ask,\r\nfor I had a notion that it might be a painful subject."\r\n\r\nFulkerson tried to turn it off lightly. "Well, he\'s a noble old fellow;\r\npity he drinks." March would not smile, and Fulkerson broke out: "Dog on\r\nit! I\'ll make it up to the old fool the next time he comes. I don\'t like\r\nthat dynamite talk of his; but any man that\'s given his hand to the\r\ncountry has got mine in his grip for good. Why, March! You don\'t suppose\r\nI wanted to hurt his feelings, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not, Fulkerson."\r\n\r\nBut they could not get away from a certain ruefulness for that time, and\r\nin the evening Fulkerson came round to March\'s to say that he had got\r\nLindau\'s address from Conrad, and had looked him up at his lodgings.\r\n\r\n"Well, there isn\'t so much bric-a-brac there, quite, as Mrs. Green left\r\nyou; but I\'ve made it all right with Lindau, as far as I\'m concerned. I\r\ntold him I didn\'t know when I spoke that way, and I honored him for\r\nsticking to his \'brinciples\'; I don\'t believe in his \'brincibles\'; and we\r\nwept on each other\'s necks--at least, he did. Dogged if he didn\'t kiss me\r\nbefore I knew what he was up to. He said I was his chenerous gong\r\nfriendt, and he begged my barton if he had said anything to wound me. I\r\ntell you it was an affecting scene, March; and rats enough round in that\r\nold barracks where he lives to fit out a first-class case of delirium\r\ntremens. What does he stay there for? He\'s not obliged to?"\r\n\r\nLindau\'s reasons, as March repeated them, affected Fulkerson as\r\ndeliciously comical; but after that he confined his pleasantries at the\r\noffice to Beaton and Conrad Dryfoos, or, as he said, he spent the rest of\r\nthe summer in keeping Lindau smoothed up.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if Lindau altogether liked this as well. Perhaps he missed\r\nthe occasions Fulkerson used to give him of bursting out against the\r\nmillionaires; and he could not well go on denouncing as the slafe of\r\ngabidal a man who had behaved to him as Fulkerson had done, though\r\nFulkerson\'s servile relations to capital had been in nowise changed by\r\nhis nople gonduct.\r\n\r\nTheir relations continued to wear this irksome character of mutual\r\nforbearance; and when Dryfoos returned in October and Fulkerson revived\r\nthe question of that dinner in celebration of the success of \'Every Other\r\nWeek,\' he carried his complaisance to an extreme that alarmed March for\r\nthe consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n"You see," Fulkerson explained, "I find that the old man has got an idea\r\nof his own about that banquet, and I guess there\'s some sense in it. He\r\nwants to have a preliminary little dinner, where we can talk the thing up\r\nfirst--half a dozen of us; and he wants to give us the dinner at his\r\nhouse. Well, that\'s no harm. I don\'t believe the old man ever gave a\r\ndinner, and he\'d like to show off a little; there\'s a good deal of human\r\nnature in the old man, after all. He thought of you, of course, and\r\nColonel Woodburn, and Beaton, and me at the foot of the table; and\r\nConrad; and I suggested Kendricks: he\'s such a nice little chap; and the\r\nold man himself brought up the idea of Lindau. He said you told him\r\nsomething about him, and he asked why couldn\'t we have him, too; and I\r\njumped at it."\r\n\r\n"Have Lindau to dinner?" asked March.\r\n\r\n"Certainly; why not? Father Dryfoos has a notion of paying the old fellow\r\na compliment for what he done for the country. There won\'t be any trouble\r\nabout it. You can sit alongside of him, and cut up his meat for him, and\r\nhelp him to things--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it won\'t do, Fulkerson! I don\'t believe Lindau ever had on a\r\ndress-coat in his life, and I don\'t believe his \'brincibles\' would let\r\nhim wear one."\r\n\r\n"Well, neither had Dryfoos, for the matter of that. He\'s as\r\nhigh-principled as old Pan-Electric himself, when it comes to a\r\ndress-coat," said Fulkerson. "We\'re all going to go in business dress;\r\nthe old man stipulated for that.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the dress-coat alone," March resumed. "Lindau and Dryfoos\r\nwouldn\'t get on. You know they\'re opposite poles in everything. You\r\nmustn\'t do it. Dryfoos will be sure to say something to outrage Lindau\'s\r\n\'brincibles,\' and there\'ll be an explosion. It\'s all well enough for\r\nDryfoos to feel grateful to Lindau, and his wish to honor him does him\r\ncredit; but to have Lindau to dinner isn\'t the way. At the best, the old\r\nfellow would be very unhappy in such a house; he would have a bad\r\nconscience; and I should be sorry to have him feel that he\'d been\r\nrecreant to his \'brincibles\'; they\'re about all he\'s got, and whatever we\r\nthink of them, we\'re bound to respect his fidelity to them." March warmed\r\ntoward Lindau in taking this view of him. "I should feel ashamed if I\r\ndidn\'t protest against his being put in a false position. After all, he\'s\r\nmy old friend, and I shouldn\'t like to have him do himself injustice if\r\nhe is a crank."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Fulkerson, with some trouble in his face. "I appreciate\r\nyour feeling. But there ain\'t any danger," he added, buoyantly. "Anyhow,\r\nyou spoke too late, as the Irishman said to the chicken when he swallowed\r\nhim in a fresh egg. I\'ve asked Lindau, and he\'s accepted with blayzure;\r\nthat\'s what he says."\r\n\r\nMarch made no other comment than a shrug.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," Fulkerson continued, "it \'ll go off all right. I\'ll engage\r\nto make it, and I won\'t hold anybody else responsible."\r\n\r\nIn the course of his married life March had learned not to censure the\r\nirretrievable; but this was just what his wife had not learned; and she\r\npoured out so much astonishment at what Fulkerson had done, and so much\r\ndisapproval, that March began to palliate the situation a little.\r\n\r\n"After all, it isn\'t a question of life and death; and, if it were, I\r\ndon\'t see how it\'s to be helped now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s not to be helped now. But I am surprised at Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, Fulkerson has his moments of being merely human, too."\r\n\r\nMrs. March would not deign a direct defence of her favorite. "Well, I\'m\r\nglad there are not to be ladies."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Dryfoos thought of having ladies, but it seems your\r\ninfallible Fulkerson overruled him. Their presence might have kept Lindau\r\nand our host in bounds."\r\n\r\nIt had become part of the Marches\' conjugal joke for him to pretend that\r\nshe could allow nothing wrong in Fulkerson, and he now laughed with a\r\nmocking air of having expected it when she said: "Well, then, if Mr.\r\nFulkerson says he will see that it all comes out right, I suppose you\r\nmust trust his tact. I wouldn\'t trust yours, Basil. The first wrong step\r\nwas taken when Mr. Lindau was asked to help on the magazine."\r\n\r\n"Well, it was your infallible Fulkerson that took the step, or at least\r\nsuggested it. I\'m happy to say I had totally forgotten my early friend."\r\n\r\nMrs. March was daunted and silenced for a moment. Then she said: "Oh,\r\npshaw! You know well enough he did it to please you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad he didn\'t do it to please you, Isabel," said her husband,\r\nwith affected seriousness. "Though perhaps he did."\r\n\r\nHe began to look at the humorous aspect of the affair, which it certainly\r\nhad, and to comment on the singular incongruities which \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' was destined to involve at every moment of its career. "I wonder if\r\nI\'m mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was ever like it.\r\nPerhaps all periodicals are like it. But I don\'t believe there\'s another\r\npublication in New York that could bring together, in honor of itself, a\r\nfraternity and equality crank like poor old Lindau, and a belated\r\nsociological crank like Woodburn, and a truculent speculator like old\r\nDryfoos, and a humanitarian dreamer like young Dryfoos, and a\r\nsentimentalist like me, and a nondescript like Beaton, and a pure\r\nadvertising essence like Fulkerson, and a society spirit like Kendricks.\r\nIf we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedly all the time,\r\nthe dinner would be the greatest success in the world, and we should come\r\nhome full of the highest mutual respect. But I suspect we can\'t manage\r\nthat--even your infallible Fulkerson couldn\'t work it--and I\'m afraid\r\nthat there\'ll be some listening that\'ll spoil the pleasure of the time."\r\n\r\nMarch was so well pleased with this view of the case that he suggested\r\nthe idea involved to Fulkerson. Fulkerson was too good a fellow not to\r\nlaugh at another man\'s joke, but he laughed a little ruefully, and he\r\nseemed worn with more than one kind of care in the interval that passed\r\nbetween the present time and the night of the dinner.\r\n\r\nDryfoos necessarily depended upon him for advice concerning the scope and\r\nnature of the dinner, but he received the advice suspiciously, and\r\ncontested points of obvious propriety with pertinacious stupidity.\r\nFulkerson said that when it came to the point he would rather have had\r\nthe thing, as he called it, at Delmonico\'s or some other restaurant; but\r\nwhen he found that Dryfoos\'s pride was bound up in having it at his own\r\nhouse, he gave way to him. Dryfoos also wanted his woman-cook to prepare\r\nthe dinner, but Fulkerson persuaded him that this would not do; he must\r\nhave it from a caterer. Then Dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at table,\r\nbut Fulkerson convinced him that this would be incongruous at a man\'s\r\ndinner. It was decided that the dinner should be sent in from\r\nFrescobaldi\'s, and Dryfoos went with Fulkerson to discuss it with the\r\ncaterer. He insisted upon having everything explained to him, and the\r\nreason for having it, and not something else in its place; and he treated\r\nFulkerson and Frescobaldi as if they were in league to impose upon him.\r\nThere were moments when Fulkerson saw the varnish of professional\r\npoliteness cracking on the Neapolitan\'s volcanic surface, and caught a\r\nglimpse of the lava fires of the cook\'s nature beneath; he trembled for\r\nDryfoos, who was walking rough-shod over him in the security of an\r\nAmerican who had known how to make his money, and must know how to spend\r\nit; but he got him safely away at last, and gave Frescobaldi a wink of\r\nsympathy for his shrug of exhaustion as they turned to leave him.\r\n\r\nIt was at first a relief and then an anxiety with Fulkerson that Lindau\r\ndid not come about after accepting the invitation to dinner, until he\r\nappeared at Dryfoos\'s house, prompt to the hour. There was, to be sure,\r\nnothing to bring him; but Fulkerson was uneasily aware that Dryfoos\r\nexpected to meet him at the office, and perhaps receive some verbal\r\nacknowledgment of the honor done him. Dryfoos, he could see, thought he\r\nwas doing all his invited guests a favor; and while he stood in a certain\r\nawe of them as people of much greater social experience than himself,\r\nregarded them with a kind of contempt, as people who were going to have a\r\nbetter dinner at his house than they could ever afford to have at their\r\nown. He had finally not spared expense upon it; after pushing Frescobaldi\r\nto the point of eruption with his misgivings and suspicions at the first\r\ninterview, he had gone to him a second time alone, and told him not to\r\nlet the money stand between him and anything he would like to do. In the\r\nabsence of Frescobaldi\'s fellow-conspirator he restored himself in the\r\ncaterer\'s esteem by adding whatever he suggested; and Fulkerson, after\r\ntrembling for the old man\'s niggardliness, was now afraid of a fantastic\r\nprofusion in the feast. Dryfoos had reduced the scale of the banquet as\r\nregarded the number of guests, but a confusing remembrance of what\r\nFulkerson had wished to do remained with him in part, and up to the day\r\nof the dinner he dropped in at Frescobaldi\'s and ordered more dishes and\r\nmore of them. He impressed the Italian as an American original of a novel\r\nkind; and when he asked Fulkerson how Dryfoos had made his money, and\r\nlearned that it was primarily in natural gas, he made note of some of his\r\neccentric tastes as peculiarities that were to be caressed in any future\r\nnatural-gas millionaire who might fall into his hands. He did not\r\nbegrudge the time he had to give in explaining to Dryfoos the relation of\r\nthe different wines to the different dishes; Dryfoos was apt to\r\nsubstitute a costlier wine where he could for a cheaper one, and he gave\r\nFrescobaldi carte blanche for the decoration of the table with pieces of\r\nartistic confectionery. Among these the caterer designed one for a\r\nsurprise to his patron and a delicate recognition of the source of his\r\nwealth, which he found Dryfoos very willing to talk about, when he\r\nintimated that he knew what it was.\r\n\r\nDryfoos left it to Fulkerson to invite the guests, and he found ready\r\nacceptance of his politeness from Kendricks, who rightly regarded the\r\ndinner as a part of the \'Every Other Week\' business, and was too sweet\r\nand kind-hearted, anyway, not to seem very glad to come. March was a\r\nmatter of course; but in Colonel Woodburn, Fulkerson encountered a\r\nreluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious of\r\nhaving, for motives of his own, rather strained a point in suggesting the\r\ncolonel to Dryfoos as a fit subject for invitation. There had been only\r\none of the colonel\'s articles printed as yet, and though it had made a\r\nsensation in its way, and started the talk about that number, still it\r\ndid not fairly constitute him a member of the staff, or even entitle him\r\nto recognition as a regular contributor. Fulkerson felt so sure of\r\npleasing him with Dryfoos\'s message that he delivered it in full family\r\ncouncil at the widow\'s. His daughter received it with all the enthusiasm\r\nthat Fulkerson had hoped for, but the colonel said, stiffly, "I have not\r\nthe pleasure of knowing Mr. Dryfoos." Miss Woodburn appeared ready to\r\nfall upon him at this, but controlled herself, as if aware that filial\r\nauthority had its limits, and pressed her lips together without saying\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," Fulkerson admitted. "But it isn\'t a usual case. Mr.\r\nDryfoos don\'t go in much for the conventionalities; I reckon he don\'t\r\nknow much about \'em, come to boil it down; and he hoped"--here Fulkerson\r\nfelt the necessity of inventing a little--"that you would excuse any want\r\nof ceremony; it\'s to be such an informal affair, anyway; we\'re all going\r\nin business dress, and there ain\'t going to be any ladies. He\'d have come\r\nhimself to ask you, but he\'s a kind of a bashful old fellow. It\'s all\r\nright, Colonel Woodburn."\r\n\r\n"I take it that it is, sir," said the colonel, courteously, but with\r\nunabated state, "coming from you. But in these matters we have no right\r\nto burden our friends with our decisions."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said Fulkerson, feeling that he had been\r\ndelicately told to mind his own business.\r\n\r\n"I understand," the colonel went on, "the relation that Mr. Dryfoos bears\r\nto the periodical in which you have done me the honor to print my papah,\r\nbut this is a question of passing the bounds of a purely business\r\nconnection, and of eating the salt of a man whom you do not definitely\r\nknow to be a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"Mah goodness!" his daughter broke in. "If you bah your own salt with his\r\nmoney--"\r\n\r\n"It is supposed that I earn his money before I buy my salt with it,"\r\nreturned her father, severely. "And in these times, when money is got in\r\nheaps, through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism, it\r\nbehooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered him is\r\nnot the profusion of a thief with his booty. I don\'t say that Mr.\r\nDryfoos\'s good-fortune is not honest. I simply say that I know nothing\r\nabout it, and that I should prefer to know something before I sat down at\r\nhis board."\r\n\r\n"You\'re all right, colonel," said Fulkerson, "and so is Mr. Dryfoos. I\r\ngive you my word that there are no flies on his personal integrity, if\r\nthat\'s what you mean. He\'s hard, and he\'d push an advantage, but I don\'t\r\nbelieve he would take an unfair one. He\'s speculated and made money every\r\ntime, but I never heard of his wrecking a railroad or belonging to any\r\nswindling company or any grinding monopoly. He does chance it in stocks,\r\nbut he\'s always played on the square, if you call stocks gambling."\r\n\r\n"May I think this over till morning?" asked the colonel.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly, certainly," said Fulkerson, eagerly. "I don\'t know as\r\nthere\'s any hurry."\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn found a chance to murmur to him before he went: "He\'ll\r\ncome. And Ah\'m so much oblahged, Mr. Fulkerson. Ah jost know it\'s all\r\nyou\' doing, and it will give papa a chance to toak to some new people,\r\nand get away from us evahlastin\' women for once."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why any one should want to do that," said Fulkerson, with\r\ngrateful gallantry. "But I\'ll be dogged," he said to March when he told\r\nhim about this odd experience, "if I ever expected to find Colonel\r\nWoodburn on old Lindau\'s ground. He did come round handsomely this\r\nmorning at breakfast and apologized for taking time to think the\r\ninvitation over before he accepted. \'You understand,\' he says, \'that if\r\nit had been to the table of some friend not so prosperous as Mr.\r\nDryfoos--your friend Mr. March, for instance--it would have been\r\nsufficient to know that he was your friend. But in these days it is a\r\nduty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to know\r\na rich man or not. The chances of making money disreputably are so great\r\nthat the chances are against a man who has made money if he\'s made a\r\ngreat deal of it.\'"\r\n\r\nMarch listened with a face of ironical insinuation. "That was very good;\r\nand he seems to have had a good deal of confidence in your patience and\r\nin your sense of his importance to the occasion--"\r\n\r\n"No, no," Fulkerson protested, "there\'s none of that kind of thing about\r\nthe colonel. I told him to take time to think it over; he\'s the\r\nsimplest-hearted old fellow in the world."\r\n\r\n"I should say so. After all, he didn\'t give any reason he had for\r\naccepting. But perhaps the young lady had the reason."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw, March!" said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Dryfoos family was concerned, the dinner might as well have\r\nbeen given at Frescobaldi\'s rooms. None of the ladies appeared. Mrs.\r\nDryfoos was glad to escape to her own chamber, where she sat before an\r\nautumnal fire, shaking her head and talking to herself at times, with the\r\nforeboding of evil which old women like her make part of their religion.\r\nThe girls stood just out of sight at the head of the stairs, and disputed\r\nwhich guest it was at each arrival; Mrs. Mandel had gone to her room to\r\nwrite letters, after beseeching them not to stand there. When Kendricks\r\ncame, Christine gave Mela a little pinch, equivalent to a little mocking\r\nshriek; for, on the ground of his long talk with Mela at Mrs. Horn\'s, in\r\nthe absence of any other admirer, they based a superstition of his\r\ninterest in her; when Beaton came, Mela returned the pinch, but\r\nawkwardly, so that it hurt, and then Christine involuntarily struck her.\r\n\r\nFrescobaldi\'s men were in possession everywhere they had turned the cook\r\nout of her kitchen and the waitress out of her pantry; the reluctant\r\nIrishman at the door was supplemented by a vivid Italian, who spoke\r\nFrench with the guests, and said, "Bien, Monsieur," and "toute suite,"\r\nand "Merci!" to all, as he took their hats and coats, and effused a\r\nhospitality that needed no language but the gleam of his eyes and teeth\r\nand the play of his eloquent hands. From his professional dress-coat,\r\nlustrous with the grease spotted on it at former dinners and parties,\r\nthey passed to the frocks of the elder and younger Dryfoos in the\r\ndrawing-room, which assumed informality for the affair, but did not put\r\ntheir wearers wholly at their ease. The father\'s coat was of black\r\nbroadcloth, and he wore it unbuttoned; the skirts were long, and the\r\nsleeves came down to his knuckles; he shook hands with his guests, and\r\nthe same dryness seemed to be in his palm and throat, as he huskily asked\r\neach to take a chair. Conrad\'s coat was of modern texture and cut, and\r\nwas buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience within its\r\nlapels; he met March with his entreating smile, and he seemed no more\r\ncapable of coping with the situation than his father. They both waited\r\nfor Fulkerson, who went about and did his best to keep life in the party\r\nduring the half-hour that passed before they sat down at dinner. Beaton\r\nstood gloomily aloof, as if waiting to be approached on the right basis\r\nbefore yielding an inch of his ground; Colonel Woodburn, awaiting the\r\nmoment when he could sally out on his hobby, kept himself intrenched\r\nwithin the dignity of a gentleman, and examined askance the figure of old\r\nLindau as he stared about the room, with his fine head up, and his empty\r\nsleeve dangling over his wrist. March felt obliged to him for wearing a\r\nnew coat in the midst of that hostile luxury, and he was glad to see\r\nDryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him, as if he wished to\r\nshow him particular respect, though it might have been because he was\r\nless afraid of him than of the others. He heard Lindau saying, "Boat, the\r\nname is Choarman?" and Dryfoos beginning to explain his Pennsylvania\r\nDutch origin, and he suffered himself, with a sigh of relief, to fall\r\ninto talk with Kendricks, who was always pleasant; he was willing to talk\r\nabout something besides himself, and had no opinions that he was not\r\nready to hold in abeyance for the time being out of kindness to others.\r\nIn that group of impassioned individualities, March felt him a refuge and\r\ncomfort--with his harmless dilettante intention of some day writing a\r\nnovel, and his belief that he was meantime collecting material for it.\r\n\r\nFulkerson, while breaking the ice for the whole company, was mainly\r\nengaged in keeping Colonel Woodburn thawed out. He took Kendricks away\r\nfrom March and presented him to the colonel as a person who, like\r\nhimself, was looking into social conditions; he put one hand on\r\nKendricks\'s shoulder, and one on the colonel\'s, and made some flattering\r\njoke, apparently at the expense of the young fellow, and then left them.\r\nMarch heard Kendricks protest in vain, and the colonel say, gravely: "I\r\ndo not wonder, sir, that these things interest you. They constitute a\r\nproblem which society must solve or which will dissolve society," and he\r\nknew from that formula, which the colonel had, once used with him, that\r\nhe was laying out a road for the exhibition of the hobby\'s paces later.\r\n\r\nFulkerson came back to March, who had turned toward Conrad Dryfoos, and\r\nsaid, "If we don\'t get this thing going pretty soon, it \'ll be the death\r\nof me," and just then Frescobaldi\'s butler came in and announced to\r\nDryfoos that dinner was served. The old man looked toward Fulkerson with\r\na troubled glance, as if he did not know what to do; he made a gesture to\r\ntouch Lindau\'s elbow. Fulkerson called out, "Here\'s Colonel Woodburn, Mr.\r\nDryfoos," as if Dryfoos were looking for him; and he set the example of\r\nwhat he was to do by taking Lindau\'s arm himself. "Mr. Lindau is going to\r\nsit at my end of the table, alongside of March. Stand not upon the order\r\nof your going, gentlemen, but fall in at once." He contrived to get\r\nDryfoos and the colonel before him, and he let March follow with\r\nKendricks. Conrad came last with Beaton, who had been turning over the\r\nmusic at the piano, and chafing inwardly at the whole affair. At the\r\ntable Colonel Woodburn was placed on Dryfoos\'s right, and March on his\r\nleft. March sat on Fulkerson\'s right, with Lindau next him; and the young\r\nmen occupied the other seats.\r\n\r\n"Put you next to March, Mr. Lindau," said Fulkerson, "so you can begin to\r\nput Apollinaris in his champagne-glass at the right moment; you know his\r\nlittle weakness of old; sorry to say it\'s grown on him."\r\n\r\nMarch laughed with kindly acquiescence in Fulkerson\'s wish to start the\r\ngayety, and Lindau patted him on the shoulder. "I know hiss veakness. If\r\nhe liges a class of vine, it iss begause his loaf ingludes efen hiss\r\nenemy, as Shakespeare galled it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but Shakespeare couldn\'t have been thinking of champagne," said\r\nKendricks.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, sir," Colonel Woodburn interposed, with lofty courtesy,\r\n"champagne could hardly have been known in his day."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, colonel," returned the younger man, deferentially. "He\r\nseemed to think that sack and sugar might be a fault; but he didn\'t\r\nmention champagne."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he felt there was no question about that," suggested Beaton, who\r\nthen felt that he had not done himself justice in the sally.\r\n\r\n"I wonder just when champagne did come in," said March.\r\n\r\n"I know when it ought to come in," said Fulkerson. "Before the soup!"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed, and gave themselves the air of drinking champagne out\r\nof tumblers every day, as men like to do. Dryfoos listened uneasily; he\r\ndid not quite understand the allusions, though he knew what Shakespeare\r\nwas, well enough; Conrad\'s face expressed a gentle deprecation of joking\r\non such a subject, but he said nothing.\r\n\r\nThe talk ran on briskly through the dinner. The young men tossed the ball\r\nback and forth; they made some wild shots, but they kept it going, and\r\nthey laughed when they were hit. The wine loosed Colonel Woodburn\'s\r\ntongue; he became very companionable with the young fellows; with the\r\nfeeling that a literary dinner ought to have a didactic scope, he praised\r\nScott and Addison as the only authors fit to form the minds of gentlemen.\r\n\r\nKendricks agreed with him, but wished to add the name of Flaubert as a\r\nmaster of style. "Style, you know," he added, "is the man."\r\n\r\n"Very true, sir; you are quite right, sir," the colonel assented; he\r\nwondered who Flaubert was.\r\n\r\nBeaton praised Baudelaire and Maupassant; he said these were the masters.\r\nHe recited some lurid verses from Baudelaire; Lindau pronounced them a\r\ndisgrace to human nature, and gave a passage from Victor Hugo on Louis\r\nNapoleon, with his heavy German accent, and then he quoted Schiller.\r\n"Ach, boat that is a peaudifool! Not zo?" he demanded of March.\r\n\r\n"Yes, beautiful; but, of course, you know I think there\'s nobody like\r\nHeine!"\r\n\r\nLindau threw back his great old head and laughed, showing a want of teeth\r\nunder his mustache. He put his hand on March\'s back. "This poy--he was a\r\npoy den--wars so gracy to pekin reading Heine that he gommence with the\r\ntictionary bevore he knows any Grammar, and ve bick it out vort by vort\r\ntogeder."\r\n\r\n"He was a pretty cay poy in those days, heigh, Lindau?" asked Fulkerson,\r\nburlesquing the old man\'s accent, with an impudent wink that made Lindau\r\nhimself laugh. "But in the dark ages, I mean, there in Indianapolis. Just\r\nhow long ago did you old codgers meet there, anyway?" Fulkerson saw the\r\nrestiveness in Dryfoos\'s eye at the purely literary course the talk had\r\ntaken; he had intended it to lead up that way to business, to \'Every\r\nOther Week;\' but he saw that it was leaving Dryfoos too far out, and he\r\nwished to get it on the personal ground, where everybody is at home.\r\n\r\n"Ledt me zee," mused Lindau. "Wass it in fifty-nine or zixty, Passil? Idt\r\nwass a year or dwo pefore the war proke oudt, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Those were exciting times," said Dryfoos, making his first entry into\r\nthe general talk. "I went down to Indianapolis with the first company\r\nfrom our place, and I saw the red-shirts pouring in everywhere. They had\r\na song,\r\n\r\n  "Oh, never mind the weather, but git over double trouble,\r\n   For we\'re bound for the land of Canaan."\r\n\r\nThe fellows locked arms and went singin\' it up and down four or five\r\nabreast in the moonlight; crowded everybody else off the sidewalk."\r\n\r\n"I remember, I remember," said Lindau, nodding his head slowly up and\r\ndown. "A coodt many off them nefer gome pack from that landt of Ganaan,\r\nMr. Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Mr. Lindau. But I reckon it was worth it--the country\r\nwe\'ve got now. Here, young man!" He caught the arm of the waiter who was\r\ngoing round with the champagne bottle. "Fill up Mr. Lindau\'s glass,\r\nthere. I want to drink the health of those old times with him. Here\'s to\r\nyour empty sleeve, Mr. Lindau. God bless it! No offence to you, Colonel\r\nWoodburn," said Dryfoos, turning to him before he drank.\r\n\r\n"Not at all, sir, not at all," said the colonel. "I will drink with you,\r\nif you will permit me."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll all drink--standing!" cried Fulkerson. "Help March to get up,\r\nsomebody! Fill high the bowl with Samian Apollinaris for Coonrod! Now,\r\nthen, hurrah for Lindau!"\r\n\r\nThey cheered, and hammered on the table with the butts of their\r\nknife-handles. Lindau remained seated. The tears came into his eyes; he\r\nsaid, "I thank you, chendlemen," and hiccoughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'d \'a\' went into the war myself," said Dryfoos, "but I was raisin\' a\r\nfamily of young children, and I didn\'t see how I could leave my farm. But\r\nI helped to fill up the quota at every call, and when the volunteering\r\nstopped I went round with the subscription paper myself; and we offered\r\nas good bounties as any in the State. My substitute was killed in one of\r\nthe last skirmishes--in fact, after Lee\'s surrender--and I\'ve took care\r\nof his family, more or less, ever since."\r\n\r\n"By-the-way, March," said Fulkerson, "what sort of an idea would it be to\r\nhave a good war story--might be a serial--in the magazine? The war has\r\nnever fully panned out in fiction yet. It was used a good deal just after\r\nit was over, and then it was dropped. I think it\'s time to take it up\r\nagain. I believe it would be a card."\r\n\r\nIt was running in March\'s mind that Dryfoos had an old rankling shame in\r\nhis heart for not having gone into the war, and that he had often made\r\nthat explanation of his course without having ever been satisfied with\r\nit. He felt sorry for him; the fact seemed pathetic; it suggested a\r\ndormant nobleness in the man.\r\n\r\nBeaton was saying to Fulkerson: "You might get a series of sketches by\r\nsubstitutes; the substitutes haven\'t been much heard from in the war\r\nliterature. How would \'The Autobiography of a Substitute\' do? You might\r\nfollow him up to the moment he was killed in the other man\'s place, and\r\ninquire whether he had any right to the feelings of a hero when he was\r\nonly hired in the place of one. Might call it \'The Career of a Deputy\r\nHero.\'"\r\n\r\n"I fancy," said March, "that there was a great deal of mixed motive in\r\nthe men who went into the war as well as in those who kept out of it. We\r\ncanonized all that died or suffered in it, but some of them must have\r\nbeen self-seeking and low-minded, like men in other vocations." He found\r\nhimself saying this in Dryfoos\'s behalf; the old man looked at him\r\ngratefully at first, he thought, and then suspiciously.\r\n\r\nLindau turned his head toward him and said: "You are righdt, Passil; you\r\nare righdt. I haf zeen on the fieldt of pattle the voarst eggsipitions of\r\nhuman paseness--chelousy, fanity, ecodistic bridte. I haf zeen men in the\r\nface off death itself gofferned by motifes as low as--as pusiness\r\nmotifes."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fulkerson, "it would be a grand thing for \'Every Other Week\'\r\nif we could get some of those ideas worked up into a series. It would\r\nmake a lot of talk."\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn ignored him in saying, "I think, Major Lindau--"\r\n\r\n"High brifate; prefet gorporal," the old man interrupted, in rejection of\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\nHendricks laughed and said, with a glance of appreciation at Lindau,\r\n"Brevet corporal is good."\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn frowned a little, and passed over the joke. "I think Mr.\r\nLindau is right. Such exhibitions were common to both sides, though if\r\nyou gentlemen will pardon me for saying so, I think they were less\r\nfrequent on ours. We were fighting more immediately for existence. We\r\nwere fewer than you were, and we knew it; we felt more intensely that if\r\neach were not for all, then none was for any."\r\n\r\nThe colonel\'s words made their impression. Dryfoos said, with authority,\r\n"That is so."\r\n\r\n"Colonel Woodburn," Fulkerson called out, "if you\'ll work up those ideas\r\ninto a short paper--say, three thousand words--I\'ll engage to make March\r\ntake it."\r\n\r\nThe colonel went on without replying: "But Mr. Lindau is right in\r\ncharacterizing some of the motives that led men to the cannon\'s mouth as\r\nno higher than business motives, and his comparison is the most forcible\r\nthat he could have used. I was very much struck by it."\r\n\r\nThe hobby was out, the colonel was in the saddle with so firm a seat that\r\nno effort sufficed to dislodge him. The dinner went on from course to\r\ncourse with barbaric profusion, and from time to time Fulkerson tried to\r\nbring the talk back to \'Every Other Week.\' But perhaps because that was\r\nonly the ostensible and not the real object of the dinner, which was to\r\nbring a number of men together under Dryfoos\'s roof, and make them the\r\nwitnesses of his splendor, make them feel the power of his wealth,\r\nFulkerson\'s attempts failed. The colonel showed how commercialism was the\r\npoison at the heart of our national life; how we began as a simple,\r\nagricultural people, who had fled to these shores with the instinct,\r\ndivinely implanted, of building a state such as the sun never shone upon\r\nbefore; how we had conquered the wilderness and the savage; how we had\r\nflung off, in our struggle with the mother-country, the trammels of\r\ntradition and precedent, and had settled down, a free nation, to the\r\npractice of the arts of peace; how the spirit of commercialism had stolen\r\ninsidiously upon us, and the infernal impulse of competition had\r\nembroiled us in a perpetual warfare of interests, developing the worst\r\npassions of our nature, and teaching us to trick and betray and destroy\r\none another in the strife for money, till now that impulse had exhausted\r\nitself, and we found competition gone and the whole economic problem in\r\nthe hands of monopolies--the Standard Oil Company, the Sugar Trust, the\r\nRubber Trust, and what not. And now what was the next thing? Affairs\r\ncould not remain as they were; it was impossible; and what was the next\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nThe company listened for the main part silently. Dryfoos tried to grasp\r\nthe idea of commercialism as the colonel seemed to hold it; he conceived\r\nof it as something like the dry-goods business on a vast scale, and he\r\nknew he had never been in that. He did not like to hear competition\r\ncalled infernal; he had always supposed it was something sacred; but he\r\napproved of what Colonel Woodburn said of the Standard Oil Company; it\r\nwas all true; the Standard Oil has squeezed Dryfoos once, and made him\r\nsell it a lot of oil-wells by putting down the price of oil so low in\r\nthat region that he lost money on every barrel he pumped.\r\n\r\nAll the rest listened silently, except Lindau; at every point the colonel\r\nmade against the present condition of things he said more and more\r\nfiercely, "You are righdt, you are righdt." His eyes glowed, his hand\r\nplayed with his knife-hilt. When the colonel demanded, "And what is the\r\nnext thing?" he threw himself forward, and repeated: "Yes, sir! What is\r\nthe next thing?"\r\n\r\n"Natural gas, by thunder!" shouted Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nOne of the waiters had profited by Lindau\'s posture to lean over him and\r\nput down in the middle of the table a structure in white sugar. It\r\nexpressed Frescobaldi\'s conception of a derrick, and a touch of nature\r\nhad been added in the flame of brandy, which burned luridly up from a\r\nsmall pit in the centre of the base, and represented the gas in\r\ncombustion as it issued from the ground. Fulkerson burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter with the words that recognized Frescobaldi\'s personal tribute to\r\nDryfoos. Everybody rose and peered over at the thing, while he explained\r\nthe work of sinking a gas-well, as he had already explained it to\r\nFrescobaldi. In the midst of his lecture he caught sight of the caterer\r\nhimself, where he stood in the pantry doorway, smiling with an artist\'s\r\nanxiety for the effect of his masterpiece.\r\n\r\n"Come in, come in, Frescobaldi! We want to congratulate you," Fulkerson\r\ncalled to him. "Here, gentlemen! Here\'s Frescobaldi\'s health."\r\n\r\nThey all drank; and Frescobaldi, smiling brilliantly and rubbing his\r\nhands as he bowed right and left, permitted himself to say to Dryfoos:\r\n"You are please; no? You like?"\r\n\r\n"First-rate, first-rate!" said the old man; but when the Italian had\r\nbowed himself out and his guests had sunk into their seats again, he said\r\ndryly to Fulkerson, "I reckon they didn\'t have to torpedo that well, or\r\nthe derrick wouldn\'t look quite so nice and clean."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Fulkerson answered, "and that ain\'t quite the style--that little\r\nwiggly-waggly blue flame--that the gas acts when you touch off a good\r\nvein of it. This might do for weak gas"; and he went on to explain:\r\n\r\n"They call it weak gas when they tap it two or three hundred feet down;\r\nand anybody can sink a well in his back yard and get enough gas to light\r\nand heat his house. I remember one fellow that had it blazing up from a\r\npipe through a flower-bed, just like a jet of water from a fountain. My,\r\nmy, my! You fel--you gentlemen--ought to go out and see that country, all\r\nof you. Wish we could torpedo this well, Mr. Dryfoos, and let \'em see how\r\nit works! Mind that one you torpedoed for me? You know, when they sink a\r\nwell," he went on to the company, "they can\'t always most generally\r\nsometimes tell whether they\'re goin\' to get gas or oil or salt water.\r\nWhy, when they first began to bore for salt water out on the Kanawha,\r\nback about the beginning of the century, they used to get gas now and\r\nthen, and then they considered it a failure; they called a gas-well a\r\nblower, and give it up in disgust; the time wasn\'t ripe for gas yet. Now\r\nthey bore away sometimes till they get half-way to China, and don\'t seem\r\nto strike anything worth speaking of. Then they put a dynamite torpedo\r\ndown in the well and explode it. They have a little bar of iron that they\r\ncall a Go-devil, and they just drop it down on the business end of the\r\ntorpedo, and then stand from under, if you please! You hear a noise, and\r\nin about half a minute you begin to see one, and it begins to rain oil\r\nand mud and salt water and rocks and pitchforks and adoptive citizens;\r\nand when it clears up the derrick\'s painted--got a coat on that\'ll wear\r\nin any climate. That\'s what our honored host meant. Generally get some\r\nvisiting lady, when there\'s one round, to drop the Go-devil. But that day\r\nwe had to put up with Conrad here. They offered to let me drop it, but I\r\ndeclined. I told \'em I hadn\'t much practice with Go-devils in the\r\nnewspaper syndicate business, and I wasn\'t very well myself, anyway.\r\nAstonishing," Fulkerson continued, with the air of relieving his\r\nexplanation by an anecdote, "how reckless they get using dynamite when\r\nthey\'re torpedoing wells. We stopped at one place where a fellow was\r\nhandling the cartridges pretty freely, and Mr. Dryfoos happened to\r\ncaution him a little, and that ass came up with one of \'em in his hand,\r\nand began to pound it on the buggy-wheel to show us how safe it was. I\r\nturned green, I was so scared; but Mr. Dryfoos kept his color, and kind\r\nof coaxed the fellow till he quit. You could see he was the fool kind,\r\nthat if you tried to stop him he\'d keep on hammering that cartridge, just\r\nto show that it wouldn\'t explode, till he blew you into Kingdom Come.\r\nWhen we got him to go away, Mr. Dryfoos drove up to his foreman. \'Pay\r\nSheney off, and discharge him on the spot,\' says he. \'He\'s too safe a man\r\nto have round; he knows too much about dynamite.\' I never saw anybody so\r\ncool."\r\n\r\nDryfoos modestly dropped his head under Fulkerson\'s flattery and, without\r\nlifting it, turned his eyes toward Colonel Woodburn. "I had all sorts of\r\nmen to deal with in developing my property out there, but I had very\r\nlittle trouble with them, generally speaking."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ah! you foundt the laboring-man reasonable--dractable--tocile?"\r\nLindau put in.\r\n\r\n"Yes, generally speaking," Dryfoos answered. "They mostly knew which side\r\nof their bread was buttered. I did have one little difficulty at one\r\ntime. It happened to be when Mr. Fulkerson was out there. Some of the men\r\ntried to form a union--"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Fulkerson. "Let me tell that! I know you wouldn\'t do\r\nyourself justice, Mr. Dryfoos, and I want \'em to know how a strike can be\r\nmanaged, if you take it in time. You see, some of those fellows got a\r\nnotion that there ought to be a union among the working-men to keep up\r\nwages, and dictate to the employers, and Mr. Dryfoos\'s foreman was the\r\nringleader in the business. They understood pretty well that as soon as\r\nhe found it out that foreman would walk the plank, and so they watched\r\nout till they thought they had Mr. Dryfoos just where they wanted\r\nhim--everything on the keen jump, and every man worth his weight in\r\ndiamonds--and then they came to him, and--told him to sign a promise to\r\nkeep that foreman to the end of the season, or till he was through with\r\nthe work on the Dryfoos and Hendry Addition, under penalty of having them\r\nall knock off. Mr. Dryfoos smelled a mouse, but he couldn\'t tell where\r\nthe mouse was; he saw that they did have him, and he signed, of course.\r\nThere wasn\'t anything really against the fellow, anyway; he was a\r\nfirst-rate man, and he did his duty every time; only he\'d got some of\r\nthose ideas into his head, and they turned it. Mr. Dryfoos signed, and\r\nthen he laid low."\r\n\r\nMarch saw Lindau listening with a mounting intensity, and heard him\r\nmurmur in German, "Shameful! shameful!"\r\n\r\nFulkerson went on: "Well, it wasn\'t long before they began to show their\r\nhand, but Mr. Dryfoos kept dark. He agreed to everything; there never was\r\nsuch an obliging capitalist before; there wasn\'t a thing they asked of\r\nhim that he didn\'t do, with the greatest of pleasure, and all went merry\r\nas a marriage-bell till one morning a whole gang of fresh men marched\r\ninto the Dryfoos and Hendry Addition, under the escort of a dozen\r\nPinkertons with repeating rifles at half-cock, and about fifty fellows\r\nfound themselves out of a job. You never saw such a mad set."\r\n\r\n"Pretty neat," said Kendricks, who looked at the affair purely from an\r\naesthetic point of view. "Such a coup as that would tell tremendously in\r\na play."\r\n\r\n"That was vile treason," said Lindau in German to March. "He\'s an\r\ninfamous traitor! I cannot stay here. I must go."\r\n\r\nHe struggled to rise, while March held him by the coat, and implored him\r\nunder his voice: "For Heaven\'s sake, don\'t, Lindau! You owe it to\r\nyourself not to make a scene, if you come here." Something in it all\r\naffected him comically; he could not help laughing.\r\n\r\nThe others were discussing the matter, and seemed not to have noticed\r\nLindau, who controlled himself and sighed: "You are right. I must have\r\npatience."\r\n\r\nBeaton was saying to Dryfoos, "Pity your Pinkertons couldn\'t have given\r\nthem a few shots before they left."\r\n\r\n"No, that wasn\'t necessary," said Dryfoos. "I succeeded in breaking up\r\nthe union. I entered into an agreement with other parties not to employ\r\nany man who would not swear that he was non-union. If they had attempted\r\nviolence, of course they could have been shot. But there was no fear of\r\nthat. Those fellows can always be depended upon to cut one another\'s\r\nthroats in the long run."\r\n\r\n"But sometimes," said Colonel Woodburn, who had been watching throughout.\r\nfor a chance to mount his hobby again, "they make a good deal of trouble\r\nfirst. How was it in the great railroad strike of \'77?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess there was a little trouble that time, colonel," said\r\nFulkerson. "But the men that undertake to override the laws and paralyze\r\nthe industries of a country like this generally get left in the end."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, generally; and up to a certain point, always. But it\'s the\r\nexceptional that is apt to happen, as well as the unexpected. And a\r\nlittle reflection will convince any gentleman here that there is always a\r\ndanger of the exceptional in your system. The fact is, those fellows have\r\nthe game in their own hands already. A strike of the whole body of the\r\nBrotherhood of Engineers alone would starve out the entire Atlantic\r\nseaboard in a week; labor insurrection could make head at a dozen given\r\npoints, and your government couldn\'t move a man over the roads without\r\nthe help of the engineers."\r\n\r\n"That is so," said Kendrick, struck by the dramatic character of the\r\nconjecture. He imagined a fiction dealing with the situation as something\r\nalready accomplished.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t some fellow do the Battle of Dorking act with that thing?"\r\nsaid Fulkerson. "It would be a card."\r\n\r\n"Exactly what I was thinking, Mr. Fulkerson," said Kendricks.\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed. "Telepathy--clear case of mind transference. Better\r\nsee March, here, about it. I\'d like to have it in \'Every Other Week.\' It\r\nwould make talk."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it might set your people to thinking as well as talking," said\r\nthe colonel.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Dryfoos, setting his lips so tightly together that his\r\nimperial stuck straight outward, "if I had my way, there wouldn\'t be any\r\nBrotherhood of Engineers, nor any other kind of labor union in the whole\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"What!" shouted Lindau. "You would sobbress the unionss of the\r\nvoarking-men?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I would."\r\n\r\n"And what would you do with the unionss of the gabidalists--the\r\ndrosts--and gompines, and boolss? Would you dake the righdt from one and\r\ngif it to the odder?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I would," said Dryfoos, with a wicked look at him.\r\n\r\nLindau was about to roar back at him with some furious protest, but March\r\nput his hand on his shoulder imploringly, and Lindau turned to him to say\r\nin German: "But it is infamous--infamous! What kind of man is this? Who\r\nis he? He has the heart of a tyrant."\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn cut in. "You couldn\'t do that, Mr. Dryfoos, under your\r\nsystem. And if you attempted it, with your conspiracy laws, and that kind\r\nof thing, it might bring the climax sooner than you expected. Your\r\ncommercialized society has built its house on the sands. It will have to\r\ngo. But I should be sorry if it went before its time."\r\n\r\n"You are righdt, sir," said Lindau. "It would be a bity. I hobe it will\r\nlast till it feelss its rottenness, like Herodt. Boat, when its hour\r\ngomes, when it trope to bieces with the veight off its own\r\ngorrubtion--what then?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not to be supposed that a system of things like this can drop to\r\npieces of its own accord, like the old Republic of Venice," said the\r\ncolonel. "But when the last vestige of commercial society is gone, then\r\nwe can begin to build anew; and we shall build upon the central idea,\r\nnot of the false liberty you now worship, but of responsibility\r\n--responsibility. The enlightened, the moneyed, the cultivated class shall\r\nbe responsible to the central authority--emperor, duke, president; the\r\nname does not matter--for the national expense and the national defence,\r\nand it shall be responsible to the working-classes of all kinds for homes\r\nand lands and implements, and the opportunity to labor at all times.\r\n\r\n"The working-classes shall be responsible to the leisure class for the\r\nsupport of its dignity in peace, and shall be subject to its command in\r\nwar. The rich shall warrant the poor against planless production and the\r\nruin that now follows, against danger from without and famine from\r\nwithin, and the poor--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" shouted Lindau. "The State shall do that--the whole beople.\r\nThe men who voark shall have and shall eat; and the men that will not\r\nvoark, they shall sdarfe. But no man need sdarfe. He will go to the\r\nState, and the State will see that he haf voark, and that he haf foodt.\r\nAll the roadts and mills and mines and landts shall be the beople\'s and\r\nbe ron by the beople for the beople. There shall be no rich and no boor;\r\nand there shall not be war any more, for what bower wouldt dare to addack\r\na beople bound togeder in a broderhood like that?"\r\n\r\n"Lion and lamb act," said Fulkerson, not well knowing, after so much\r\nchampagne, what words he was using.\r\n\r\nNo one noticed him, and Colonel Woodburn said coldly to Lindau, "You are\r\ntalking paternalism, sir."\r\n\r\n"And you are dalking feutalism!" retorted the old man.\r\n\r\nThe colonel did not reply. A silence ensued, which no one broke till\r\nFulkerson said: "Well, now, look here. If either one of these millenniums\r\nwas brought about, by force of arms, or otherwise, what would become of\r\n\'Every Other Week\'? Who would want March for an editor? How would Beaton\r\nsell his pictures? Who would print Mr. Kendricks\'s little society verses\r\nand short stories? What would become of Conrad and his good works?" Those\r\nnamed grinned in support of Fulkerson\'s diversion, but Lindau and the\r\ncolonel did not speak; Dryfoos looked down at his plate, frowning.\r\n\r\nA waiter came round with cigars, and Fulkerson took one. "Ah," he said,\r\nas he bit off the end, and leaned over to the emblematic masterpiece,\r\nwhere the brandy was still feebly flickering, "I wonder if there\'s enough\r\nnatural gas left to light my cigar." His effort put the flame out and\r\nknocked the derrick over; it broke in fragments on the table. Fulkerson\r\ncackled over the ruin: "I wonder if all Moffitt will look that way after\r\nlabor and capital have fought it out together. I hope this ain\'t ominous\r\nof anything personal, Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take the risk of it," said the old man, harshly.\r\n\r\nHe rose mechanically, and Fulkerson said to Frescobaldi\'s man, "You can\r\nbring us the coffee in the library."\r\n\r\nThe talk did not recover itself there. Landau would not sit down; he\r\nrefused coffee, and dismissed himself with a haughty bow to the company;\r\nColonel Woodburn shook hands elaborately all round, when he had smoked\r\nhis cigar; the others followed him. It seemed to March that his own\r\ngood-night from Dryfoos was dry and cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMarch met Fulkerson on the steps of the office next morning, when he\r\narrived rather later than his wont. Fulkerson did not show any of the\r\nsigns of suffering from the last night\'s pleasure which painted\r\nthemselves in March\'s face. He flirted his hand gayly in the air, and\r\nsaid, "How\'s your poor head?" and broke into a knowing laugh. "You don\'t\r\nseem to have got up with the lark this morning. The old gentleman is in\r\nthere with Conrad, as bright as a biscuit; he\'s beat you down. Well, we\r\ndid have a good time, didn\'t we? And old Lindau and the colonel, didn\'t\r\nthey have a good time? I don\'t suppose they ever had a chance before to\r\ngive their theories quite so much air. Oh, my! how they did ride over us!\r\nI\'m just going down to see Beaton about the cover of the Christmas\r\nnumber. I think we ought to try it in three or four colors, if we are\r\ngoing to observe the day at all." He was off before March could pull\r\nhimself together to ask what Dryfoos wanted at the office at that hour of\r\nthe morning; he always came in the afternoon on his way up-town.\r\n\r\nThe fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with which March\r\nhad parted from him the night before, but Fulkerson\'s cheerfulness seemed\r\nto gainsay them; afterward March did not know whether to attribute this\r\nmood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times in Fulkerson, or\r\nto a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving him alone to the old\r\nman, who mounted to his room shortly after March had reached it.\r\n\r\nA sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face; his jaw was set so firmly\r\nthat he did not seem able at once to open it. He asked, without the\r\nceremonies of greeting, "What does that one-armed Dutchman do on this\r\nbook?"\r\n\r\n"What does he do?" March echoed, as people are apt to do with a question\r\nthat is mandatory and offensive.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, what does he do? Does he write for it?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you mean Lindau," said March. He saw no reason for refusing to\r\nanswer Dryfoos\'s demand, and he decided to ignore its terms. "No, he\r\ndoesn\'t write for it in the usual way. He translates for it; he examines\r\nthe foreign magazines, and draws my attention to anything he thinks of\r\ninterest. But I told you about this before--"\r\n\r\n"I know what you told me, well enough. And I know what he is. He is a\r\nred-mouthed labor agitator. He\'s one of those foreigners that come here\r\nfrom places where they\'ve never had a decent meal\'s victuals in their\r\nlives, and as soon as they get their stomachs full, they begin to make\r\ntrouble between our people and their hands. There\'s where the strikes\r\ncome from, and the unions and the secret societies. They come here and\r\nbreak our Sabbath, and teach their atheism. They ought to be hung! Let\r\n\'em go back if they don\'t like it over here. They want to ruin the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\nMarch could not help smiling a little at the words, which came fast\r\nenough now in the hoarse staccato of Dryfoos\'s passion. "I don\'t know\r\nwhom you mean by they, generally speaking; but I had the impression that\r\npoor old Lindau had once done his best to save the country. I don\'t\r\nalways like his way of talking, but I know that he is one of the truest\r\nand kindest souls in the world; and he is no more an atheist than I am.\r\nHe is my friend, and I can\'t allow him to be misunderstood."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what he is," Dryfoos broke out, "I won\'t have him round. He\r\ncan\'t have any more work from this office. I want you to stop it. I want\r\nyou to turn him off."\r\n\r\nMarch was standing at his desk, as he had risen to receive Dryfoos when\r\nhe entered. He now sat down, and began to open his letters.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear?" the old man roared at him. "I want you to turn him off."\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Mr. Dryfoos," said March, succeeding in an effort to speak\r\ncalmly, "I don\'t know you, in such a matter as this. My arrangements as\r\neditor of \'Every Other Week\' were made with Mr. Fulkerson. I have always\r\nlistened to any suggestion he has had to make."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care for Mr. Fulkerson! He has nothing to do with it," retorted\r\nDryfoos; but he seemed a little daunted by March\'s position.\r\n\r\n"He has everything to do with it as far as I am concerned," March\r\nanswered, with a steadiness that he did not feel. "I know that you are\r\nthe owner of the periodical, but I can\'t receive any suggestion from you,\r\nfor the reason that I have given. Nobody but Mr. Fulkerson has any right\r\nto talk with me about its management."\r\n\r\nDryfoos glared at him for a moment, and demanded, threateningly: "Then\r\nyou say you won\'t turn that old loafer off? You say that I have got to\r\nkeep on paying my money out to buy beer for a man that would cut my\r\nthroat if he got the chance?"\r\n\r\n"I say nothing at all, Mr. Dryfoos," March answered. The blood came into\r\nhis face, and he added: "But I will say that if you speak again of Mr.\r\nLindau in those terms, one of us must leave this room. I will not hear\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nDryfoos looked at him with astonishment; then he struck his hat down on\r\nhis head, and stamped out of the room and down the stairs; and a vague\r\npity came into March\'s heart that was not altogether for himself. He\r\nmight be the greater sufferer in the end, but he was sorry to have got\r\nthe better of that old man for the moment; and he felt ashamed of the\r\nanger into which Dryfoos\'s anger had surprised him. He knew he could not\r\nsay too much in defence of Lindau\'s generosity and unselfishness, and he\r\nhad not attempted to defend him as a political economist. He could not\r\nhave taken any ground in relation to Dryfoos but that which he held, and\r\nhe felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive instructions\r\nor commands from him. Yet somehow he was not satisfied with the whole\r\naffair, and not merely because his present triumph threatened his final\r\nadvantage, but because he felt that in his heart he had hardly done\r\njustice to Dryfoos\'s rights in the matter; it did not quite console him\r\nto reflect that Dryfoos had himself made it impossible. He was tempted to\r\ngo home and tell his wife what had happened, and begin his preparations\r\nfor the future at once. But he resisted this weakness and kept\r\nmechanically about his work, opening the letters and the manuscripts\r\nbefore him with that curious double action of the mind common in men of\r\nvivid imaginations. It was a relief when Conrad Dryfoos, having\r\napparently waited to make sure that his father would not return, came up\r\nfrom the counting-room and looked in on March with a troubled face.\r\n\r\n"Mr. March," he began, "I hope father hasn\'t been saying anything to you\r\nthat you can\'t overlook. I know he was very much excited, and when he is\r\nexcited he is apt to say things that he is sorry for."\r\n\r\nThe apologetic attitude taken for Dryfoos, so different from any attitude\r\nthe peremptory old man would have conceivably taken for himself, made\r\nMarch smile. "Oh no. I fancy the boot is on the other leg. I suspect I\'ve\r\nsaid some things your father can\'t overlook, Conrad." He called the young\r\nman by his Christian name partly to distinguish him from his father,\r\npartly from the infection of Fulkerson\'s habit, and partly from a\r\nkindness for him that seemed naturally to express itself in that way.\r\n\r\n"I know he didn\'t sleep last night, after you all went away," Conrad\r\npursued, "and of course that made him more irritable; and he was tried a\r\ngood deal by some of the things that Mr. Lindau said."\r\n\r\n"I was tried a good deal myself," said March. "Lindau ought never to have\r\nbeen there."\r\n\r\n"No." Conrad seemed only partially to assent.\r\n\r\n"I told Mr. Fulkerson so. I warned him that Lindau would be apt to break\r\nout in some way. It wasn\'t just to him, and it wasn\'t just to your\r\nfather, to ask him."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson had a good motive," Conrad gently urged. "He did it\r\nbecause he hurt his feelings that day about the pension."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it was a mistake. He knew that Lindau was inflexible about his\r\nprinciples, as he calls them, and that one of his first principles is to\r\ndenounce the rich in season and out of season. I don\'t remember just what\r\nhe said last night; and I really thought I\'d kept him from breaking out\r\nin the most offensive way. But your father seems very much incensed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said Conrad.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I don\'t agree with Lindau. I think there are as many good,\r\nkind, just people among the rich as there are among the poor, and that\r\nthey are as generous and helpful. But Lindau has got hold of one of those\r\npartial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth, and--"\r\n\r\n"Partial truth!" the young man interrupted. "Didn\'t the Saviour himself\r\nsay, \'How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of\r\nGod?\'"\r\n\r\n"Why, bless my soul!" cried March. "Do you agree with Lindau?"\r\n\r\n"I agree with the Lord Jesus Christ," said the young man, solemnly, and a\r\nstrange light of fanaticism, of exaltation, came into his wide blue eyes.\r\n"And I believe He meant the kingdom of heaven upon this earth, as well as\r\nin the skies."\r\n\r\nMarch threw himself back in his chair and looked at him with a kind of\r\nstupefaction, in which his eye wandered to the doorway, where he saw\r\nFulkerson standing, it seemed to him a long time, before he heard him\r\nsaying: "Hello, hello! What\'s the row? Conrad pitching into you on old\r\nLindau\'s account, too?"\r\n\r\nThe young man turned, and, after a glance at Fulkerson\'s light, smiling\r\nface, went out, as if in his present mood he could not bear the contact\r\nof that persiflant spirit.\r\n\r\nMarch felt himself getting provisionally very angry again. "Excuse me,\r\nFulkerson, but did you know when you went out what Mr. Dryfoos wanted to\r\nsee me for?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no, I didn\'t exactly," said Fulkerson, taking his usual seat on a\r\nchair and looking over the back of it at March. "I saw he was on his car\r\nabout something, and I thought I\'d better not monkey with him much. I\r\nsupposed he was going to bring you to book about old Lindau, somehow."\r\nFulkerson broke into a laugh.\r\n\r\nMarch remained serious. "Mr. Dryfoos," he said, willing to let the simple\r\nstatement have its own weight with Fulkerson, and nothing more, "came in\r\nhere and ordered me to discharge Lindau from his employment on the\r\nmagazine--to turn him off, as he put it."\r\n\r\n"Did he?" asked Fulkerson, with unbroken cheerfulness. "The old man is\r\nbusiness, every time. Well, I suppose you can easily get somebody else to\r\ndo Lindau\'s work for you. This town is just running over with\r\nhalf-starved linguists. What did you say?"\r\n\r\n"What did I say?" March echoed. "Look here, Fulkerson; you may regard\r\nthis as a joke, but I don\'t. I\'m not used to being spoken to as if I were\r\nthe foreman of a shop, and told to discharge a sensitive and cultivated\r\nman like Lindau, as if he were a drunken mechanic; and if that\'s your\r\nidea of me--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hello, now, March! You mustn\'t mind the old man\'s way. He don\'t mean\r\nanything by it--he don\'t know any better, if you come to that."\r\n\r\n"Then I know better," said March. "I refused to receive any instructions\r\nfrom Mr. Dryfoos, whom I don\'t know in my relations with \'Every Other\r\nWeek,\' and I referred him to you."\r\n\r\n"You did?" Fulkerson whistled. "He owns the thing!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care who owns the thing," said March. "My negotiations were with\r\nyou alone from the beginning, and I leave this matter with you. What do\r\nyou wish done about Lindau?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, better let the old fool drop," said Fulkerson. "He\'ll light on his\r\nfeet somehow, and it will save a lot of rumpus."\r\n\r\n"And if I decline to let him drop?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, now, March; don\'t do that," Fulkerson began.\r\n\r\n"If I decline to let him drop," March repeated, "what will you do?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be dogged if I know what I\'ll do," said Fulkerson. "I hope you\r\nwon\'t take that stand. If the old man went so far as to speak to you\r\nabout it, his mind is made up, and we might as well knock under first as\r\nlast."\r\n\r\n"And do you mean to say that you would not stand by me in what I\r\nconsidered my duty--in a matter of principle?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, March," said Fulkerson, coaxingly, "I mean to do the\r\nright thing. But Dryfoos owns the magazine--"\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t own me," said March, rising. "He has made the little mistake\r\nof speaking to me as if he did; and when"--March put on his hat and took\r\nhis overcoat down from its nail--"when you bring me his apologies, or\r\ncome to say that, having failed to make him understand they were\r\nnecessary, you are prepared to stand by me, I will come back to this\r\ndesk. Otherwise my resignation is at your service."\r\n\r\nHe started toward the door, and Fulkerson intercepted him. "Ah, now, look\r\nhere, March! Don\'t do that! Hang it all, don\'t you see where it leaves\r\nme? Now, you just sit down a minute and talk it over. I can make you\r\nsee--I can show you--Why, confound the old Dutch beer-buzzer! Twenty of\r\nhim wouldn\'t be worth the trouble he\'s makin\'. Let him go, and the old\r\nman \'ll come round in time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we\'ve understood each other exactly, Mr. Fulkerson," said\r\nMarch, very haughtily. "Perhaps we never can; but I\'ll leave you to think\r\nit out."\r\n\r\nHe pushed on, and Fulkerson stood aside to let him pass, with a dazed\r\nlook and a mechanical movement. There was something comic in his rueful\r\nbewilderment to March, who was tempted to smile, but he said to himself\r\nthat he had as much reason to be unhappy as Fulkerson, and he did not\r\nsmile. His indignation kept him hot in his purpose to suffer any\r\nconsequence rather than submit to the dictation of a man like Dryfoos; he\r\nfelt keenly the degradation of his connection with him, and all his\r\nresentment of Fulkerson\'s original uncandor returned; at the same time\r\nhis heart ached with foreboding. It was not merely the work in which he\r\nhad constantly grown happier that he saw taken from him; but he felt the\r\nmisery of the man who stakes the security and plenty and peace of home\r\nupon some cast, and knows that losing will sweep from him most that most\r\nmen find sweet and pleasant in life. He faced the fact, which no good man\r\ncan front without terror, that he was risking the support of his family,\r\nand for a point of pride, of honor, which perhaps he had no right to\r\nconsider in view of the possible adversity. He realized, as every\r\nhireling must, no matter how skillfully or gracefully the tie is\r\ncontrived for his wearing, that he belongs to another, whose will is his\r\nlaw. His indignation was shot with abject impulses to go back and tell\r\nFulkerson that it was all right, and that he gave up. To end the anguish\r\nof his struggle he quickened his steps, so that he found he was reaching\r\nhome almost at a run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nHe must have made more clatter than he supposed with his key at the\r\napartment door, for his wife had come to let him in when he flung it\r\nopen. "Why, Basil," she said, "what\'s brought you back? Are you sick?\r\nYou\'re all pale. Well, no wonder! This is the last of Mr. Fulkerson\'s\r\ndinners you shall go to. You\'re not strong enough for it, and your\r\nstomach will be all out of order for a week. How hot you are! and in a\r\ndrip of perspiration! Now you\'ll be sick." She took his hat away, which\r\nhung dangling in his hand, and pushed him into a chair with tender\r\nimpatience. "What is the matter? Has anything happened?"\r\n\r\n"Everything has happened," he said, getting his voice after one or two\r\nhusky endeavors for it; and then he poured out a confused and huddled\r\nstatement of the case, from which she only got at the situation by\r\nprolonged cross-questioning.\r\n\r\nAt the end she said, "I knew Lindau would get you into trouble."\r\n\r\nThis cut March to the heart. "Isabel!" he cried, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know," she retorted, and the tears began to come. "I don\'t wonder\r\nyou didn\'t want to say much to me about that dinner at breakfast. I\r\nnoticed it; but I thought you were just dull, and so I didn\'t insist. I\r\nwish I had, now. If you had told me what Lindau had said, I should have\r\nknown what would have come of it, and I could have advised you--"\r\n\r\n"Would you have advised me," March demanded, curiously, "to submit to\r\nbullying like that, and meekly consent to commit an act of cruelty\r\nagainst a man who had once been such a friend to me?"\r\n\r\n"It was an unlucky day when you met him. I suppose we shall have to go.\r\nAnd just when we had got used to New York, and begun to like it. I don\'t\r\nknow where we shall go now; Boston isn\'t like home any more; and we\r\ncouldn\'t live on two thousand there; I should be ashamed to try. I\'m sure\r\nI don\'t know where we can live on it. I suppose in some country village,\r\nwhere there are no schools, or anything for the children. I don\'t know\r\nwhat they\'ll say when we tell them, poor things."\r\n\r\nEvery word was a stab in March\'s heart, so weakly tender to his own; his\r\nwife\'s tears, after so much experience of the comparative lightness of\r\nthe griefs that weep themselves out in women, always seemed wrung from\r\nhis own soul; if his children suffered in the least through him, he felt\r\nlike a murderer. It was far worse than he could have imagined, the way\r\nhis wife took the affair, though he had imagined certain words, or\r\nperhaps only looks, from her that were bad enough. He had allowed for\r\ntrouble, but trouble on his account: a svmpathy that might burden and\r\nembarrass him; but he had not dreamed of this merely domestic, this\r\npetty, this sordid view of their potential calamity, which left him\r\nwholly out of the question, and embraced only what was most crushing and\r\ndesolating in the prospect. He could not bear it. He caught up his hat\r\nagain, and, with some hope that his wife would try to keep him, rushed\r\nout of the house. He wandered aimlessly about, thinking the same\r\nexhausting thoughts over and over, till he found himself horribly hungry;\r\nthen he went into a restaurant for his lunch, and when he paid he tried\r\nto imagine how he should feel if that were really his last dollar.\r\n\r\nHe went home toward the middle of the afternoon, basely hoping that\r\nFulkerson had sent him some conciliatory message, or perhaps was waiting\r\nthere for him to talk it over; March was quite willing to talk it over\r\nnow. But it was his wife who again met him at the door, though it seemed\r\nanother woman than the one he had left weeping in the morning.\r\n\r\n"I told the children," she said, in smiling explanation of his absence\r\nfrom lunch, "that perhaps you were detained by business. I didn\'t know\r\nbut you had gone back to the office."\r\n\r\n"Did you think I would go back there, Isabel?" asked March, with a\r\nhaggard look. "Well, if you say so, I will go back, and do what Dryfoos\r\nordered me to do. I\'m sufficiently cowed between him and you, I can\r\nassure you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," she said. "I approve of everything you did. But sit down,\r\nnow, and don\'t keep walking that way, and let me see if I understand it\r\nperfectly. Of course, I had to have my say out."\r\n\r\nShe made him go all over his talk with Dryfoos again, and report his own\r\nlanguage precisely. From time to time, as she got his points, she said,\r\n"That was splendid," "Good enough for him!" and "Oh, I\'m so glad you said\r\nthat to him!" At the end she said:\r\n\r\n"Well, now, let\'s look at it from his point of view. Let\'s be perfectly\r\njust to him before we take another step forward."\r\n\r\n"Or backward," March suggested, ruefully. "The case is simply this: he\r\nowns the magazine."\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"And he has a right to expect that I will consider his pecuniary\r\ninterests--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, those detestable pecuniary interests! Don\'t you wish there wasn\'t\r\nany money in the world?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; or else that there was a great deal more of it. And I was perfectly\r\nwilling to do that. I have always kept that in mind as one of my duties\r\nto him, ever since I understood what his relation to the magazine was."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can bear witness to that in any court of justice. You\'ve done it\r\na great deal more than I could, Basil. And it was just the same way with\r\nthose horrible insurance people."\r\n\r\n"I know," March went on, trying to be proof against her flatteries, or at\r\nleast to look as if he did not deserve praise; "I know that what Lindau\r\nsaid was offensive to him, and I can understand how he felt that he had a\r\nright to punish it. All I say is that he had no right to punish it\r\nthrough me."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mrs. March, askingly.\r\n\r\n"If it had been a question of making \'Every Other Week\' the vehicle of\r\nLindau\'s peculiar opinions--though they\'re not so very peculiar; he might\r\nhave got the most of them out of Ruskin--I shouldn\'t have had any ground\r\nto stand on, or at least then I should have had to ask myself whether his\r\nopinions would be injurious to the magazine or not."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see," Mrs. March interpolated, "how they could hurt it much\r\nworse than Colonel Woodburn\'s article crying up slavery."\r\n\r\n"Well," said March, impartially, "we could print a dozen articles\r\npraising the slavery it\'s impossible to have back, and it wouldn\'t hurt\r\nus. But if we printed one paper against the slavery which Lindau claims\r\nstill exists, some people would call us bad names, and the counting-room\r\nwould begin to feel it. But that isn\'t the point. Lindau\'s connection\r\nwith \'Every Other Week\' is almost purely mechanical; he\'s merely a\r\ntranslator of such stories and sketches as he first submits to me, and it\r\nisn\'t at all a question of his opinions hurting us, but of my becoming an\r\nagent to punish him for his opinions. That is what I wouldn\'t do; that\'s\r\nwhat I never will do."\r\n\r\n"If you did," said his wife, "I should perfectly despise you. I didn\'t\r\nunderstand how it was before. I thought you were just holding out against\r\nDryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone with you, and because you\r\nwouldn\'t recognize his authority. But now I\'m with you, Basil, every\r\ntime, as that horrid little Fulkerson says. But who would ever have\r\nsupposed he would be so base as to side against you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said March, thoughtfully, "that we had a right to expect\r\nanything else. Fulkerson\'s standards are low; they\'re merely business\r\nstandards, and the good that\'s in him is incidental and something quite\r\napart from his morals and methods. He\'s naturally a generous and\r\nright-minded creature, but life has taught him to truckle and trick, like\r\nthe rest of us."\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t taught you that, Basil."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be so sure. Perhaps it\'s only that I\'m a poor scholar. But I don\'t\r\nknow, really, that I despise Fulkerson so much for his course this\r\nmorning as for his gross and fulsome flatteries of Dryfoos last night. I\r\ncould hardly stomach it."\r\n\r\nHis wife made him tell her what they were, and then she said, "Yes, that\r\nwas loathsome; I couldn\'t have believed it of Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he only did it to keep the talk going, and to give the old man a\r\nchance to say something," March leniently suggested. "It was a worse\r\neffect because he didn\'t or couldn\'t follow up Fulkerson\'s lead."\r\n\r\n"It was loathsome, all the same," his wife insisted. "It\'s the end of Mr.\r\nFulkerson, as far as I\'m concerned."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t tell you before," March resumed, after a moment, "of my little\r\ninterview with Conrad Dryfoos after his father left," and now he went on\r\nto repeat what had passed between him and the young man.\r\n\r\n"I suspect that he and his father had been having some words before the\r\nold man came up to talk with me, and that it was that made him so\r\nfurious."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but what a strange position for the son of such a man to take! Do\r\nyou suppose he says such things to his father?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; but I suspect that in his meek way Conrad would say what\r\nhe believed to anybody. I suppose we must regard him as a kind of crank."\r\n\r\n"Poor young fellow! He always makes me feel sad, somehow. He has such a\r\npathetic face. I don\'t believe I ever saw him look quite happy, except\r\nthat night at Mrs. Horn\'s, when he was talking with Miss Vance; and then\r\nhe made me feel sadder than ever."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t envy him the life he leads at home, with those convictions of\r\nhis. I don\'t see why it wouldn\'t be as tolerable there for old Lindau\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Well, now," said Mrs. March, "let us put them all out of our minds and\r\nsee what we are going to do ourselves."\r\n\r\nThey began to consider their ways and means, and how and where they\r\nshould live, in view of March\'s severance of his relations with \'Every\r\nOther Week.\' They had not saved anything from the first year\'s salary;\r\nthey had only prepared to save; and they had nothing solid but their two\r\nthousand to count upon. But they built a future in which they easily\r\nlived on that and on what March earned with his pen. He became a free\r\nlance, and fought in whatever cause he thought just; he had no ties, no\r\nchains. They went back to Boston with the heroic will to do what was most\r\ndistasteful; they would have returned to their own house if they had not\r\nrented it again; but, any rate, Mrs. March helped out by taking boarders,\r\nor perhaps only letting rooms to lodgers. They had some hard struggles,\r\nbut they succeeded.\r\n\r\n"The great thing," she said, "is to be right. I\'m ten times as happy as\r\nif you had come home and told me that you had consented to do what\r\nDryfoos asked and he had doubled your salary."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that would have happened in any event," said March, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Well, no matter. I just used it for an example."\r\n\r\nThey both experienced a buoyant relief, such as seems to come to people\r\nwho begin life anew on whatever terms. "I hope we are young enough yet,\r\nBasil," she said, and she would not have it when he said they had once\r\nbeen younger.\r\n\r\nThey heard the children\'s knock on the door; they knocked when they came\r\nhome from school so that their mother might let them in. "Shall we tell\r\nthem at once?" she asked, and ran to open for them before March could\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThey were not alone. Fulkerson, smiling from ear to ear, was with them.\r\n"Is March in?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Mr. March is at home, yes," she said very haughtily. "He\'s in his\r\nstudy," and she led the way there, while the children went to their\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n"Well, March," Fulkerson called out at sight of him, "it\'s all right! The\r\nold man has come down."\r\n\r\n"I suppose if you gentlemen are going to talk business--" Mrs. March\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we don\'t want you to go away," said Fulkerson. "I reckon March has\r\ntold you, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve told her," said March. "Don\'t go, Isabel. What do you mean,\r\nFulkerson?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s just gone on up home, and he sent me round with his apologies. He\r\nsees now that he had no business to speak to you as he did, and he\r\nwithdraws everything. He\'d \'a\' come round himself if I\'d said so, but I\r\ntold him I could make it all right."\r\n\r\nFulkerson looked so happy in having the whole affair put right, and the\r\nMarches knew him to be so kindly affected toward them, that they could\r\nnot refuse for the moment to share his mood. They felt themselves\r\nslipping down from the moral height which they had gained, and March made\r\na clutch to stay himself with the question, "And Lindau?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Fulkerson, "he\'s going to leave Lindau to me. You won\'t have\r\nanything to do with it. I\'ll let the old fellow down easy."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean," asked March, "that Mr. Dryfoos insists on his being\r\ndismissed?"\r\n\r\n"Why, there isn\'t any dismissing about it," Fulkerson argued. "If you\r\ndon\'t send him any more work, he won\'t do any more, that\'s all. Or if he\r\ncomes round, you can--He\'s to be referred to me."\r\n\r\nMarch shook his head, and his wife, with a sigh, felt herself plucked up\r\nfrom the soft circumstance of their lives, which she had sunk back into\r\nso quickly, and set beside him on that cold peak of principle again. "It\r\nwon\'t do, Fulkerson. It\'s very good of you, and all that, but it comes to\r\nthe same thing in the end. I could have gone on without any apology from\r\nMr. Dryfoos; he transcended his authority, but that\'s a minor matter. I\r\ncould have excused it to his ignorance of life among gentlemen; but I\r\ncan\'t consent to Lindau\'s dismissal--it comes to that, whether you do it\r\nor I do it, and whether it\'s a positive or a negative thing--because he\r\nholds this opinion or that."\r\n\r\n"But don\'t you see," said Fulkerson, "that it\'s just Lindau\'s opinions\r\nthe old man can\'t stand? He hasn\'t got anything against him personally. I\r\ndon\'t suppose there\'s anybody that appreciates Lindau in some ways more\r\nthan the old man does."\r\n\r\n"I understand. He wants to punish him for his opinions. Well, I can\'t\r\nconsent to that, directly or indirectly. We don\'t print his opinions, and\r\nhe has a perfect right to hold them, whether Mr. Dryfoos agrees with them\r\nor not."\r\n\r\nMrs. March had judged it decorous for her to say nothing, but she now\r\nwent and sat down in the chair next her husband.\r\n\r\n"Ah, dog on it!" cried Fulkerson, rumpling his hair with both his hands.\r\n"What am I to do? The old man says he\'s got to go."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t consent to his going," said March.\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t stay if he goes."\r\n\r\nFulkerson rose. "Well, well! I\'ve got to see about it. I\'m afraid the old\r\nman won\'t stand it, March; I am, indeed. I wish you\'d reconsider. I--I\'d\r\ntake it as a personal favor if you would. It leaves me in a fix. You see\r\nI\'ve got to side with one or the other."\r\n\r\nMarch made no reply to this, except to say, "Yes, you must stand by him,\r\nor you must stand by me."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! Hold on awhile! I\'ll see you in the morning. Don\'t take any\r\nsteps--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there are no steps to take," said March, with a melancholy smile.\r\n"The steps are stopped; that\'s all." He sank back into his chair when\r\nFulkerson was gone and drew a long breath. "This is pretty rough. I\r\nthought we had got through it."\r\n\r\n"No," said his wife. "It seems as if I had to make the fight all over\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a good thing it\'s a holy war."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear the suspense. Why didn\'t you tell him outright you wouldn\'t\r\ngo back on any terms?"\r\n\r\n"I might as well, and got the glory. He\'ll never move Dryfoos. I suppose\r\nwe both would like to go back, if we could."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose so."\r\n\r\nThey could not regain their lost exaltation, their lost dignity. At\r\ndinner Mrs. March asked the children how they would like to go back to\r\nBoston to live.\r\n\r\n"Why, we\'re not going, are we?" asked Tom, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"I was just wondering how you felt about it, now," she said, with an\r\nunderlook at her husband.\r\n\r\n"Well, if we go back," said Bella, "I want to live on the Back Bay. It\'s\r\nawfully Micky at the South End."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I should go to Harvard," said Tom, "and I\'d room out at\r\nCambridge. It would be easier to get at you on the Back Bay."\r\n\r\nThe parents smiled ruefully at each other, and, in view of these grand\r\nexpectations of his children, March resolved to go as far as he could in\r\nmeeting Dryfoos\'s wishes. He proposed the theatre as a distraction from\r\nthe anxieties that he knew were pressing equally on his wife. "We might\r\ngo to the \'Old Homestead,\'" he suggested, with a sad irony, which only\r\nhis wife felt.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, let\'s!" cried Bella.\r\n\r\nWhile they were getting ready, someone rang, and Bella went to the door,\r\nand then came to tell her father that it was Mr. Lindau. "He says he\r\nwants to see you just a moment. He\'s in the parlor, and he won\'t sit\r\ndown, or anything."\r\n\r\n"What can he want?" groaned Mrs. March, from their common dismay.\r\n\r\nMarch apprehended a storm in the old man\'s face. But he only stood in the\r\nmiddle of the room, looking very sad and grave. "You are Going oudt," he\r\nsaid. "I won\'t geep you long. I haf gome to pring pack dose macassines\r\nand dis mawney. I can\'t do any more voark for you; and I can\'t geep the\r\nmawney you haf baid me a\'ready. It iss not hawnest mawney--that hass been\r\noarned py voark; it iss mawney that hass peen mate py sbeculation, and\r\nthe obbression off lapor, and the necessity of the boor, py a man--Here\r\nit is, efery tollar, efery zent. Dake it; I feel as if dere vas ploodt on\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Why, Lindau," March began, but the old man interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"Ton\'t dalk to me, Passil! I could not haf believedt it of you. When you\r\nknow how I feel about dose tings, why tidn\'t you dell me whose mawney you\r\nbay oudt to me? Ach, I ton\'t plame you--I ton\'t rebroach you. You haf\r\nnefer thought of it; boat I have thought, and I should be Guilty, I must\r\nshare that man\'s Guilt, if I gept hiss mawney. If you hat toldt me at the\r\npeginning--if you hat peen frank with me boat it iss all righdt; you can\r\ngo on; you ton\'t see dese tings as I see them; and you haf cot a family,\r\nand I am a free man. I voark to myself, and when I ton\'t voark, I sdarfe\r\nto myself. But I geep my handts glean, voark or sdarfe. Gif him hiss\r\nmawney pack! I am sawry for him; I would not hoart hiss feelings, boat I\r\ncould not pear to douch him, and hiss mawney iss like boison!"\r\n\r\nMarch tried to reason with Lindau, to show him the folly, the injustice,\r\nthe absurdity of his course; it ended in their both getting angry, and in\r\nLindau\'s going away in a whirl of German that included Basil in the guilt\r\nof the man whom Lindau called his master.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mrs. March. "He is a crank, and I think you\'re well rid of\r\nhim. Now you have no quarrel with that horrid old Dryfoos, and you can\r\nkeep right on."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said March, "I wish it didn\'t make me feel so sneaking. What a\r\nlong day it\'s been! It seems like a century since I got up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, a thousand years. Is there anything else left to happen?"\r\n\r\n"I hope not. I\'d like to go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Why, aren\'t you going to the theatre?" wailed Bella, coming in upon her\r\nfather\'s desperate expression.\r\n\r\n"The theatre? Oh yes, certainly! I meant after we got home," and March\r\namused himself at the puzzled countenance of the child. "Come on! Is Tom\r\nready?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nFulkerson parted with the Marches in such trouble of mind that he did not\r\nfeel able to meet that night the people whom he usually kept so gay at\r\nMrs. Leighton\'s table. He went to Maroni\'s for his dinner, for this\r\nreason and for others more obscure. He could not expect to do anything\r\nmore with Dryfoos at once; he knew that Dryfoos must feel that he had\r\nalready made an extreme concession to March, and he believed that if he\r\nwas to get anything more from him it must be after Dryfoos had dined. But\r\nhe was not without the hope, vague and indefinite as it might be, that he\r\nshould find Lindau at Maroni\'s, and perhaps should get some concession\r\nfrom him, some word of regret or apology which he could report to\r\nDryfoos, and at lest make the means of reopening the affair with him;\r\nperhaps Lindau, when he knew how matters stood, would back down\r\naltogether, and for March\'s sake would withdraw from all connection with\r\n\'Every Other Week\' himself, and so leave everything serene. Fulkerson\r\nfelt capable, in his desperation, of delicately suggesting such a course\r\nto Lindau, or even of plainly advising it: he did not care for Lindau a\r\ngreat deal, and he did care a great deal for the magazine.\r\n\r\nBut he did not find Lindau at Maroni\'s; he only found Beaton. He sat\r\nlooking at the doorway as Fulkerson entered, and Fulkerson naturally came\r\nand took a place at his table. Something in Beaton\'s large-eyed solemnity\r\nof aspect invited Fulkerson to confidence, and he said, as he pulled his\r\nnapkin open and strung it, still a little damp (as the scanty,\r\noften-washed linen at Maroni\'s was apt to be), across his knees, "I was\r\nlooking for you this morning, to talk with you about the Christmas\r\nnumber, and I was a good deal worked up because I couldn\'t find you; but\r\nI guess I might as well have spared myself my emotions."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked Beaton, briefly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know as there\'s going to be any Christmas number."\r\n\r\n"Why?" Beaton asked again.\r\n\r\n"Row between the financial angel and the literary editor about the chief\r\ntranslator and polyglot smeller."\r\n\r\n"Lindau?"\r\n\r\n"Lindau is his name."\r\n\r\n"What does the literary editor expect after Lindau\'s expression of his\r\nviews last night?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he expected, but the ground he took with the old man\r\nwas that, as Lindau\'s opinions didn\'t characterize his work on the\r\nmagazine, he would not be made the instrument of punishing him for them\r\nthe old man wanted him turned off, as he calls it."\r\n\r\n"Seems to be pretty good ground," said Beaton, impartially, while he\r\nspeculated, with a dull trouble at heart, on the effect the row would\r\nhave on his own fortunes. His late visit home had made him feel that the\r\nclaim of his family upon him for some repayment of help given could not\r\nbe much longer delayed; with his mother sick and his father growing old,\r\nhe must begin to do something for them, but up to this time he had spent\r\nhis salary even faster than he had earned it. When Fulkerson came in he\r\nwas wondering whether he could get him to increase it, if he threatened\r\nto give up his work, and he wished that he was enough in love with\r\nMargaret Vance, or even Christine Dryfoos, to marry her, only to end in\r\nthe sorrowful conviction that he was really in love with Alma Leighton,\r\nwho had no money, and who had apparently no wish to be married for love,\r\neven. "And what are you going to do about it?" he asked, listlessly.\r\n\r\n"Be dogged if I know what I\'m going to do about it," said Fulkerson.\r\n"I\'ve been round all day, trying to pick up the pieces--row began right\r\nafter breakfast this morning--and one time I thought I\'d got the thing\r\nall put together again. I got the old man to say that he had spoken to\r\nMarch a little too authoritatively about Lindau; that, in fact, he ought\r\nto have communicated his wishes through me; and that he was willing to\r\nhave me get rid of Lindau, and March needn\'t have anything to do with it.\r\nI thought that was pretty white, but March says the apologies and regrets\r\nare all well enough in their way, but they leave the main question where\r\nthey found it."\r\n\r\n"What is the main question?" Beaton asked, pouring himself out some\r\nChianti. As he set the flask down he made the reflection that if he would\r\ndrink water instead of Chianti he could send his father three dollars a\r\nweek, on his back debts, and he resolved to do it.\r\n\r\n"The main question, as March looks at it, is the question of punishing\r\nLindau for his private opinions; he says that if he consents to my\r\nbouncing the old fellow it\'s the same as if he bounced him."\r\n\r\n"It might have that complexion in some lights," said Beaton. He drank off\r\nhis Chianti, and thought he would have it twice a week, or make Maroni\r\nkeep the half-bottles over for him, and send his father two dollars. "And\r\nwhat are you going to do now?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I don\'t know," said Fulkerson, ruefully. After a moment he\r\nsaid, desperately, "Beaton, you\'ve got a pretty good head; why don\'t you\r\nsuggest something?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you let March go?" Beaton suggested.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I couldn\'t," said Fulkerson. "I got him to break up in Boston and\r\ncome here; I like him; nobody else could get the hang of the thing like\r\nhe has; he\'s--a friend." Fulkerson said this with the nearest approach he\r\ncould make to seriousness, which was a kind of unhappiness.\r\n\r\nBeaton shrugged. "Oh, if you can afford to have ideals, I congratulate\r\nyou. They\'re too expensive for me. Then, suppose you get rid of Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed forlornly. "Go on, Bildad. Like to sprinkle a few ashes\r\nover my boils? Don\'t mind me!"\r\n\r\nThey both sat silent a little while, and then Beaton said, "I suppose you\r\nhaven\'t seen Dryfoos the second time?"\r\n\r\n"No. I came in here to gird up my loins with a little dinner before I\r\ntackled him. But something seems to be the matter with Maroni\'s cook. I\r\ndon\'t want anything to eat."\r\n\r\n"The cooking\'s about as bad as usual," said Beaton. After a moment he\r\nadded, ironically, for he found Fulkerson\'s misery a kind of relief from\r\nhis own, and was willing to protract it as long as it was amusing, "Why\r\nnot try an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Get that other old fool to go to Dryfoos for you!"\r\n\r\n"Which other old fool? The old fools seem to be as thick as flies."\r\n\r\n"That Southern one."\r\n\r\n"Colonel Woodburn?"\r\n\r\n"Mmmmm."\r\n\r\n"He did seem to rather take to the colonel!" Fulkerson mused aloud.\r\n\r\n"Of course he did. Woodburn, with his idiotic talk about patriarchal\r\nslavery, is the man on horseback to Dryfoos\'s muddy imagination. He\'d\r\nlisten to him abjectly, and he\'d do whatever Woodburn told him to do."\r\nBeaton smiled cynically.\r\n\r\nFulkerson got up and reached for his coat and hat. "You\'ve struck it, old\r\nman." The waiter came up to help him on with his coat; Fulkerson slipped\r\na dollar in his hand. "Never mind the coat; you can give the rest of my\r\ndinner to the poor, Paolo. Beaton, shake! You\'ve saved my life, little\r\nboy, though I don\'t think you meant it." He took Beaton\'s hand and\r\nsolemnly pressed it, and then almost ran out of the door.\r\n\r\nThey had just reached coffee at Mrs. Leighton\'s when he arrived and sat\r\ndown with them and began to put some of the life of his new hope into\r\nthem. His appetite revived, and, after protesting that he would not take\r\nanything but coffee, he went back and ate some of the earlier courses.\r\nBut with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward, he did not\r\nconceal from Miss Woodburn, at least, that he was eager to get her apart\r\nfrom the rest for some reason. When he accomplished this, it seemed as if\r\nhe had contrived it all himself, but perhaps he had not wholly contrived\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad to get a chance to speak to you alone," he said at once; and\r\nwhile she waited for the next word he made a pause, and then said,\r\ndesperately, "I want you to help me; and if you can\'t help me, there\'s no\r\nhelp for me."\r\n\r\n"Mah goodness," she said, "is the case so bad as that? What in the woald\r\nis the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a bad case," said Fulkerson. "I want your father to help me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thoat you said me!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I want you to help me with your father. I suppose I ought to go to\r\nhim at once, but I\'m a little afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"And you awe not afraid of me? I don\'t think that\'s very flattering, Mr.\r\nFulkerson. You ought to think Ah\'m twahce as awful as papa."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do! You see, I\'m quite paralyzed before you, and so I don\'t feel\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a pretty lahvely kyand of paralysis. But--go on."\r\n\r\n"I will--I will. If I can only begin."\r\n\r\n"Pohaps Ah maght begin fo\' you."\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t. Lord knows, I\'d like to let you. Well, it\'s like this."\r\n\r\nFulkerson made a clutch at his hair, and then, after another hesitation,\r\nhe abruptly laid the whole affair before her. He did not think it\r\nnecessary to state the exact nature of the offence Lindau had given\r\nDryfoos, for he doubted if she could grasp it, and he was profuse of his\r\nexcuses for troubling her with the matter, and of wonder at himself for\r\nhaving done so. In the rapture of his concern at having perhaps made a\r\nfool of himself, he forgot why he had told her; but she seemed to like\r\nhaving been confided in, and she said, "Well, Ah don\'t see what you can\r\ndo with you\' ahdeals of friendship except stand bah Mr. Mawch."\r\n\r\n"My ideals of friendship? What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t you suppose we know? Mr. Beaton said you we\' a pofect Bahyard\r\nin friendship, and you would sacrifice anything to it."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?" said Fulkerson, thinking how easily he could sacrifice\r\nLindau in this case. He had never supposed before that he was chivalrous\r\nin such matters, but he now began to see it in that light, and he\r\nwondered that he could ever have entertained for a moment the idea of\r\nthrowing March over.\r\n\r\n"But Ah most say," Miss Woodburn went on, "Ah don\'t envy you you\' next\r\ninterview with Mr. Dryfoos. Ah suppose you\'ll have to see him at once\r\naboat it."\r\n\r\nThe conjecture recalled Fulkerson to the object of his confidences. "Ah,\r\nthere\'s where your help comes in. I\'ve exhausted all the influence I have\r\nwith Dryfoos--"\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, you don\'t expect Ah could have any!"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed at the comic dismay with which she conveyed the\r\npreposterous notion; and Fulkerson said, "If I judged from myself, I\r\nshould expect you to bring him round instantly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, Mr. Fulkerson," she said, with mock meekness.\r\n\r\n"Not at all. But it isn\'t Dryfoos I want you to help me with; it\'s your\r\nfather. I want your father to interview Dryfoos for me, and I--I\'m afraid\r\nto ask him."\r\n\r\n"Poo\' Mr. Fulkerson!" she said, and she insinuated something through her\r\nburlesque compassion that lifted him to the skies. He swore in his heart\r\nthat the woman never lived who was so witty, so wise, so beautiful, and\r\nso good. "Come raght with me this minute, if the cyoast\'s clea\'." She\r\nwent to the door of the diningroom and looked in across its gloom to the\r\nlittle gallery where her father sat beside a lamp reading his evening\r\npaper; Mrs. Leighton could be heard in colloquy with the cook below, and\r\nAlma had gone to her room. She beckoned Fulkerson with the hand\r\noutstretched behind her, and said, "Go and ask him."\r\n\r\n"Alone!" he palpitated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a cyowahd!" she cried, and went with him. "Ah suppose you\'ll\r\nwant me to tell him aboat it."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wish you\'d begin, Miss Woodburn," he said. "The fact is, you\r\nknow, I\'ve been over it so much I\'m kind of sick of the thing."\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn advanced and put her hand on her father\'s shoulder. "Look\r\nheah, papa! Mr. Fulkerson wants to ask you something, and he wants me to\r\ndo it fo\' him."\r\n\r\nThe colonel looked up through his glasses with the sort of ferocity\r\nelderly men sometimes have to put on in order to keep their glasses from\r\nfalling off. His daughter continued: "He\'s got into an awful difficulty\r\nwith his edito\' and his proprieto\', and he wants you to pacify them."\r\n\r\n"I do not know whethah I understand the case exactly," said the colonel,\r\n"but Mr. Fulkerson may command me to the extent of my ability."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t understand it aftah what Ah\'ve said?" cried the girl. "Then Ah\r\ndon\'t see but what you\'ll have to explain it you\'self, Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Woodburn has been so luminous about it, colonel," said\r\nFulkerson, glad of the joking shape she had given the affair, "that I can\r\nonly throw in a little side-light here and there."\r\n\r\nThe colonel listened as Fulkerson went on, with a grave diplomatic\r\nsatisfaction. He felt gratified, honored, even, he said, by Mr.\r\nFulkerson\'s appeal to him; and probably it gave him something of the high\r\njoy that an affair of honor would have brought him in the days when he\r\nhad arranged for meetings between gentlemen. Next to bearing a challenge,\r\nthis work of composing a difficulty must have been grateful. But he gave\r\nno outward sign of his satisfaction in making a resume of the case so as\r\nto get the points clearly in his mind.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid, sir," he said, with the state due to the serious nature of\r\nthe facts, "that Mr. Lindau had given Mr. Dryfoos offence by some of his\r\nquestions at the dinner-table last night."\r\n\r\n"Perfect red rag to a bull," Fulkerson put in; and then he wanted to\r\nwithdraw his words at the colonel\'s look of displeasure.\r\n\r\n"I have no reflections to make upon Mr. Landau," Colonel Woodburn\r\ncontinued, and Fulkerson felt grateful to him for going on; "I do not\r\nagree with Mr. Lindau; I totally disagree with him on sociological\r\npoints; but the course of the conversation had invited him to the\r\nexpression of his convictions, and he had a right to express them, so far\r\nas they had no personal bearing."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Fulkerson, while Miss Woodburn perched on the arm of\r\nher father\'s chair.\r\n\r\n"At the same time, sir, I think that if Mr. Dryfoos felt a personal\r\ncensure in Mr. Lindau\'s questions concerning his suppression of the\r\nstrike among his workmen, he had a right to resent it."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," Fulkerson assented.\r\n\r\n"But it must be evident to you, sir, that a high-spirited gentleman like\r\nMr. March--I confess that my feelings are with him very warmly in the\r\nmatter--could not submit to dictation of the nature you describe."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," said Fulkerson; and, with that strange duplex action of the\r\nhuman mind, he wished that it was his hair, and not her father\'s, that\r\nMiss Woodburn was poking apart with the corner of her fan.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lindau," the colonel concluded, "was right from his point of view,\r\nand Mr. Dryfoos was equally right. The position of Mr. March is perfectly\r\ncorrect--"\r\n\r\nHis daughter dropped to her feet from his chair-arm. "Mah goodness! If\r\nnobody\'s in the wrong, ho\' awe you evah going to get the mattah\r\nstraight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you see," Fulkerson added, "nobody can give in."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me," said the colonel, "the case is one in which all can give\r\nin."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which \'ll begin," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\nThe colonel rose. "Mr. Lindau must begin, sir. We must begin by seeing\r\nMr. Lindau, and securing from him the assurance that in the expression of\r\nhis peculiar views he had no intention of offering any personal offence\r\nto Mr. Dryfoos. If I have formed a correct estimate of Mr. Lindau, this\r\nwill be perfectly simple."\r\n\r\nFulkerson shook his head. "But it wouldn\'t help. Dryfoos don\'t care a rap\r\nwhether Lindau meant any personal offence or not. As far as that is\r\nconcerned, he\'s got a hide like a hippopotamus. But what he hates is\r\nLindau\'s opinions, and what he says is that no man who holds such\r\nopinions shall have any work from him. And what March says is that no man\r\nshall be punished through him for his opinions, he don\'t care what they\r\nare."\r\n\r\nThe colonel stood a moment in silence. "And what do you expect me to do\r\nunder the circumstances?"\r\n\r\n"I came to you for advice--I thought you might suggest----?"\r\n\r\n"Do you wish me to see Mr. Dryfoos?"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s about the size of it," Fulkerson admitted. "You see,\r\ncolonel," he hastened on, "I know that you have a great deal of influence\r\nwith him; that article of yours is about the only thing he\'s ever read in\r\n\'Every Other Week,\' and he\'s proud of your acquaintance. Well, you\r\nknow"--and here Fulkerson brought in the figure that struck him so much\r\nin Beaton\'s phrase and had been on his tongue ever since--"you\'re the\r\nman on horseback to him; and he\'d be more apt to do what you say than if\r\nanybody else said it."\r\n\r\n"You are very good, sir," said the colonel, trying to be proof against\r\nthe flattery, "but I am afraid you overrate my influence." Fulkerson let\r\nhim ponder it silently, and his daughter governed her impatience by\r\nholding her fan against her lips. Whatever the process was in the\r\ncolonel\'s mind, he said at last: "I see no good reason for declining to\r\nact for you, Mr. Fulkerson, and I shall be very happy if I can be of\r\nservice to you. But"--he stopped Fulkerson from cutting in with\r\nprecipitate thanks--"I think I have a right, sir, to ask what your course\r\nwill be in the event of failure?"\r\n\r\n"Failure?" Fulkerson repeated, in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I will not conceal from you that this mission is one not\r\nwholly agreeable to my feelings."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I understand that, colonel, and I assure you that I appreciate, I--"\r\n\r\n"There is no use trying to blink the fact, sir, that there are certain\r\naspects of Mr. Dryfoos\'s character in which he is not a gentleman. We\r\nhave alluded to this fact before, and I need not dwell upon it now: I may\r\nsay, however, that my misgivings were not wholly removed last night."\r\n\r\n"No," Fulkerson assented; though in his heart he thought the old man had\r\nbehaved very well.\r\n\r\n"What I wish to say now is that I cannot consent to act for you, in this\r\nmatter, merely as an intermediary whose failure would leave the affair in\r\nstate quo."\r\n\r\n"I see," said Fulkerson.\r\n\r\n"And I should like some intimation, some assurance, as to which party\r\nyour own feelings are with in the difference."\r\n\r\nThe colonel bent his eyes sharply on Fulkerson; Miss Woodburn let hers\r\nfall; Fulkerson felt that he was being tested, and he said, to gain time,\r\n"As between Lindau and Dryfoos?" though he knew this was not the point.\r\n\r\n"As between Mr. Dryfoos and Mr. March," said the colonel.\r\n\r\nFulkerson drew a long breath and took his courage in both hands. "There\r\ncan\'t be any choice for me in such a case. I\'m for March, every time."\r\n\r\nThe colonel seized his hand, and Miss Woodburn said, "If there had been\r\nany choice fo\' you in such a case, I should never have let papa stir a\r\nstep with you."\r\n\r\n"Why, in regard to that," said the colonel, with a literal application\r\nof the idea, "was it your intention that we should both go?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know; I suppose it was."\r\n\r\n"I think it will be better for me to go alone," said the colonel; and,\r\nwith a color from his experience in affairs of honor, he added: "In these\r\nmatters a principal cannot appear without compromising his dignity. I\r\nbelieve I have all the points clearly in mind, and I think I should act\r\nmore freely in meeting Mr. Dryfoos alone."\r\n\r\nFulkerson tried to hide the eagerness with which he met these agreeable\r\nviews. He felt himself exalted in some sort to the level of the colonel\'s\r\nsentiments, though it would not be easy to say whether this was through\r\nthe desperation bred of having committed himself to March\'s side, or\r\nthrough the buoyant hope he had that the colonel would succeed in his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid to talk with Dryfoos about it," he said.\r\n\r\n"There is no question of courage," said the colonel. "It is a question of\r\ndignity--of personal dignity."\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t let that delay you, papa," said his daughter, following him\r\nto the door, where she found him his hat, and Fulkerson helped him on\r\nwith his overcoat. "Ah shall be jost wald to know ho\' it\'s toned oat."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you let me go up to the house with you?" Fulkerson began. "I\r\nneedn\'t go in--"\r\n\r\n"I prefer to go alone," said the colonel. "I wish to turn the points over\r\nin my mind, and I am afraid you would find me rather dull company."\r\n\r\nHe went out, and Fulkerson returned with Miss Woodburn to the\r\ndrawing-room, where she said the Leightons were. They, were not there,\r\nbut she did not seem disappointed.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Fulkerson," she said, "you have got an ahdeal of friendship,\r\nsure enough."\r\n\r\n"Me?" said Fulkerson. "Oh, my Lord! Don\'t you see I couldn\'t do anything\r\nelse? And I\'m scared half to death, anyway. If the colonel don\'t bring\r\nthe old man round, I reckon it\'s all up with me. But he\'ll fetch him. And\r\nI\'m just prostrated with gratitude to you, Miss Woodburn."\r\n\r\nShe waved his thanks aside with her fan. "What do you mean by its being\r\nall up with you?"\r\n\r\n"Why, if the old man sticks to his position, and I stick to March, we\'ve\r\nboth got to go overboard together. Dryfoos owns the magazine; he can stop\r\nit, or he can stop us, which amounts to the same thing, as far as we\'re\r\nconcerned."\r\n\r\n"And then what?" the girl pursued.\r\n\r\n"And then, nothing--till we pick ourselves up."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that Mr. Dryfoos will put you both oat of your places?"\r\n\r\n"He may."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Mawch takes the risk of that jost fo\' a principle?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon."\r\n\r\n"And you do it jost fo\' an ahdeal?"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do to own it. I must have my little axe to grind, somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Well, men awe splendid," sighed the girl. "Ah will say it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'re not so much better than women," said Fulkerson, with a\r\nnervous jocosity. "I guess March would have backed down if it hadn\'t been\r\nfor his wife. She was as hot as pepper about it, and you could see that\r\nshe would have sacrificed all her husband\'s relations sooner than let him\r\nback down an inch from the stand he had taken. It\'s pretty easy for a man\r\nto stick to a principle if he has a woman to stand by him. But when you\r\ncome to play it alone--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fulkerson," said the girl, solemnly, "Ah will stand bah you in this,\r\nif all the woald tones against you." The tears came into her eyes, and\r\nshe put out her hand to him.\r\n\r\n"You will?" he shouted, in a rapture. "In every way--and always--as long\r\nas you live? Do you mean it?" He had caught her hand to his breast and\r\nwas grappling it tight there and drawing her to him.\r\n\r\nThe changing emotions chased one another through her heart and over her\r\nface: dismay, shame, pride, tenderness. "You don\'t believe," she said,\r\nhoarsely, "that Ah meant that?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I hope you do mean it; for if you don\'t, nothing else means\r\nanything."\r\n\r\nThere was no space, there was only a point of wavering. "Ah do mean it."\r\n\r\nWhen they lifted their eyes from each other again it was half-past ten.\r\n"No\' you most go," she said.\r\n\r\n"But the colonel--our fate?"\r\n\r\n"The co\'nel is often oat late, and Ah\'m not afraid of ouah fate, no\' that\r\nwe\'ve taken it into ouah own hands." She looked at him with dewy eyes of\r\ntrust, of inspiration.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s going to come out all right," he said. "It can\'t come out wrong\r\nnow, no matter what happens. But who\'d have thought it, when I came into\r\nthis house, in such a state of sin and misery, half an hour ago--"\r\n\r\n"Three houahs and a half ago!" she said. "No! you most jost go. Ah\'m\r\ntahed to death. Good-night. You can come in the mawning to see--papa." She\r\nopened the door and pushed him out with enrapturing violence, and he ran\r\nlaughing down the steps into her father\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"Why, colonel! I was just going up to meet you." He had really thought he\r\nwould walk off his exultation in that direction.\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to say, Mr. Fulkerson," the colonel began, gravely,\r\n"that Mr. Dryfoos adheres to his position."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right," said Fulkerson, with unabated joy. "It\'s what I\r\nexpected. Well, my course is clear; I shall stand by March, and I guess\r\nthe world won\'t come to an end if he bounces us both. But I\'m\r\neverlastingly obliged to you, Colonel Woodburn, and I don\'t know what to\r\nsay to you. I--I won\'t detain you now; it\'s so late. I\'ll see you in the\r\nmorning. Good-ni--"\r\n\r\nFulkerson did not realize that it takes two to part. The colonel laid\r\nhold of his arm and turned away with him. "I will walk toward your place\r\nwith you. I can understand why you should be anxious to know the\r\nparticulars of my interview with Mr. Dryfoos"; and in the statement which\r\nfollowed he did not spare him the smallest. It outlasted their walk and\r\ndetained them long on the steps of the \'Every Other Week\' building. But\r\nat the end Fulkerson let himself in with his key as light of heart as if\r\nhe had been listening to the gayest promises that fortune could make.\r\n\r\nBy the time he met March at the office next morning, a little, but only a\r\nvery little, misgiving saddened his golden heaven. He took March\'s hand\r\nwith high courage, and said, "Well, the old man sticks to his point,\r\nMarch." He added, with the sense of saying it before Miss Woodburn: "And\r\nI stick by you. I\'ve thought it all over, and I\'d rather be right with\r\nyou than wrong with him."\r\n\r\n"Well, I appreciate your motive, Fulkerson," said March. "But\r\nperhaps--perhaps we can save over our heroics for another occasion.\r\nLindau seems to have got in with his, for the present."\r\n\r\nHe told him of Lindau\'s last visit, and they stood a moment looking at\r\neach other rather queerly. Fulkerson was the first to recover his\r\nspirits. "Well," he said, cheerily, "that let\'s us out."\r\n\r\n"Does it? I\'m not sure it lets me out," said March; but he said this in\r\ntribute to his crippled self-respect rather than as a forecast of any\r\naction in the matter.\r\n\r\n"Why, what are you going to do?" Fulkerson asked. "If Lindau won\'t work\r\nfor Dryfoos, you can\'t make him."\r\n\r\nMarch sighed. "What are you going to do with this money?" He glanced at\r\nthe heap of bills he had flung on the table between them.\r\n\r\nFulkerson scratched his head. "Ah, dogged if I know: Can\'t we give it to\r\nthe deserving poor, somehow, if we can find \'em?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose we\'ve no right to use it in any way.  You must give it to\r\nDryfoos."\r\n\r\n"To the deserving rich? Well, you can always find them. I reckon you\r\ndon\'t want to appear in the transaction! I don\'t, either; but I guess I\r\nmust." Fulkerson gathered up the money and carried it to Conrad. He\r\ndirected him to account for it in his books as conscience-money, and he\r\nenjoyed the joke more than Conrad seemed to do when he was told where it\r\ncame from.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was able to wear off the disagreeable impression the affair\r\nleft during the course of the fore-noon, and he met Miss Woodburn with\r\nall a lover\'s buoyancy when he went to lunch. She was as happy as he when\r\nhe told her how fortunately the whole thing had ended, and he took her\r\nview that it was a reward of his courage in having dared the worst. They\r\nboth felt, as the newly plighted always do, that they were in the best\r\nrelations with the beneficent powers, and that their felicity had been\r\nespecially looked to in the disposition of events. They were in a glow of\r\nrapturous content with themselves and radiant worship of each other; she\r\nwas sure that he merited the bright future opening to them both, as much\r\nas if he owed it directly to some noble action of his own; he felt that\r\nhe was indebted for the favor of Heaven entirely to the still incredible\r\naccident of her preference of him over other men.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn, who was not yet in the secret of their love, perhaps\r\nfailed for this reason to share their satisfaction with a result so\r\nunexpectedly brought about. The blessing on their hopes seemed to his\r\nignorance to involve certain sacrifices of personal feeling at which he\r\nhinted in suggesting that Dryfoos should now be asked to make some\r\nabstract concessions and acknowledgments; his daughter hastened to deny\r\nthat these were at all necessary; and Fulkerson easily explained why. The\r\nthing was over; what was the use of opening it up again?\r\n\r\n"Perhaps none," the colonel admitted. But he added, "I should like the\r\nopportunity of taking Mr. Lindau\'s hand in the presence of Mr. Dryfoos\r\nand assuring him that I considered him a man of principle and a man of\r\nhonor--a gentleman, sir, whom I was proud and happy to have known."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ah\'ve no doabt," said his daughter, demurely, "that you\'ll have\r\nthe chance some day; and we would all lahke to join you. But at the same\r\ntahme, Ah think Mr. Fulkerson is well oat of it fo\' the present."\r\n\r\n\r\nPG EDITOR\'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Anticipative reprisal\r\n    Buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience\r\n    Courtship\r\n    Got their laugh out of too many things in life\r\n    Had learned not to censure the irretrievable\r\n    Had no opinions that he was not ready to hold in abeyance\r\n    Ignorant of her ignorance\r\n    It don\'t do any good to look at its drawbacks all the time\r\n    Justice must be paid for at every step in fees and costs\r\n    Life has taught him to truckle and trick\r\n    Man\'s willingness to abide in the present\r\n    No longer the gross appetite for novelty\r\n    No right to burden our friends with our decisions\r\n    Travel, with all its annoyances and fatigues\r\n    Typical anything else, is pretty difficult to find\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH PART\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSuperficially, the affairs of \'Every Other Week\' settled into their\r\nwonted form again, and for Fulkerson they seemed thoroughly reinstated.\r\nBut March had a feeling of impermanency from what had happened, mixed\r\nwith a fantastic sense of shame toward Lindau. He did not sympathize with\r\nLindau\'s opinions; he thought his remedy for existing evils as wildly\r\nimpracticable as Colonel Woodburn\'s. But while he thought this, and while\r\nhe could justly blame Fulkerson for Lindau\'s presence at Dryfoos\'s\r\ndinner, which his zeal had brought about in spite of March\'s protests,\r\nstill he could not rid himself of the reproach of uncandor with Lindau.\r\nHe ought to have told him frankly about the ownership of the magazine,\r\nand what manner of man the man was whose money he was taking. But he said\r\nthat he never could have imagined that he was serious in his preposterous\r\nattitude in regard to a class of men who embody half the prosperity of\r\nthe country; and he had moments of revolt against his own humiliation\r\nbefore Lindau, in which he found it monstrous that he should return\r\nDryfoos\'s money as if it had been the spoil of a robber. His wife agreed\r\nwith him in these moments, and said it was a great relief not to have\r\nthat tiresome old German coming about. They had to account for his\r\nabsence evasively to the children, whom they could not very well tell\r\nthat their father was living on money that Lindau disdained to take, even\r\nthough Lindau was wrong and their father was right. This heightened Mrs.\r\nMarch\'s resentment toward both Lindau and Dryfoos, who between them had\r\nplaced her husband in a false position. If anything, she resented\r\nDryfoos\'s conduct more than Lindau\'s. He had never spoken to March about\r\nthe affair since Lindau had renounced his work, or added to the\r\napologetic messages he had sent by Fulkerson. So far as March knew,\r\nDryfoos had been left to suppose that Lindau had simply stopped for some\r\nreason that did not personally affect him. They never spoke of him, and\r\nMarch was too proud to ask either Fulkerson or Conrad whether the old man\r\nknew that Lindau had returned his money. He avoided talking to Conrad,\r\nfrom a feeling that if he did he should involuntarily lead him on to\r\nspeak of his differences with his father. Between himself and Fulkerson,\r\neven, he was uneasily aware of a want of their old perfect friendliness.\r\nFulkerson had finally behaved with honor and courage; but his provisional\r\nreluctance had given March the measure of Fulkerson\'s character in one\r\ndirection, and he could not ignore the fact that it was smaller than he\r\ncould have wished.\r\n\r\nHe could not make out whether Fulkerson shared his discomfort or not. It\r\ncertainly wore away, even with March, as time passed, and with Fulkerson,\r\nin the bliss of his fortunate love, it was probably far more transient,\r\nif it existed at all. He advanced into the winter as radiantly as if to\r\nmeet the spring, and he said that if there were any pleasanter month of\r\nthe year than November, it was December, especially when the weather was\r\ngood and wet and muddy most of the time, so that you had to keep indoors\r\na long while after you called anywhere.\r\n\r\nColonel Woodburn had the anxiety, in view of his daughter\'s engagement,\r\nwhen she asked his consent to it, that such a dreamer must have in regard\r\nto any reality that threatens to affect the course of his reveries. He\r\nhad not perhaps taken her marriage into account, except as a remote\r\ncontingency; and certainly Fulkerson was not the kind of son-in-law that\r\nhe had imagined in dealing with that abstraction. But because he had\r\nnothing of the sort definitely in mind, he could not oppose the selection\r\nof Fulkerson with success; he really knew nothing against him, and he\r\nknew, many things in his favor; Fulkerson inspired him with the liking\r\nthat every one felt for him in a measure; he amused him, he cheered him;\r\nand the colonel had been so much used to leaving action of all kinds to\r\nhis daughter that when he came to close quarters with the question of a\r\nson-in-law he felt helpless to decide it, and he let her decide it, as if\r\nit were still to be decided when it was submitted to him. She was\r\ncompetent to treat it in all its phases: not merely those of personal\r\ninterest, but those of duty to the broken Southern past, sentimentally\r\ndear to him, and practically absurd to her. No such South as he\r\nremembered had ever existed to her knowledge, and no such civilization as\r\nhe imagined would ever exist, to her belief, anywhere. She took the world\r\nas she found it, and made the best of it. She trusted in Fulkerson; she\r\nhad proved his magnanimity in a serious emergency; and in small things\r\nshe was willing fearlessly to chance it with him. She was not a\r\nsentimentalist, and there was nothing fantastic in her expectations; she\r\nwas a girl of good sense and right mind, and she liked the immediate\r\npracticality as well as the final honor of Fulkerson. She did not\r\nidealize him, but in the highest effect she realized him; she did him\r\njustice, and she would not have believed that she did him more than\r\njustice if she had sometimes known him to do himself less.\r\n\r\nTheir engagement was a fact to which the Leighton household adjusted\r\nitself almost as simply as the lovers themselves; Miss Woodburn told the\r\nladies at once, and it was not a thing that Fulkerson could keep from\r\nMarch very long. He sent word of it to Mrs. March by her husband; and his\r\nengagement perhaps did more than anything else to confirm the confidence\r\nin him which had been shaken by his early behavior in the Lindau episode,\r\nand not wholly restored by his tardy fidelity to March. But now she felt\r\nthat a man who wished to get married so obviously and entirely for love\r\nwas full of all kinds of the best instincts, and only needed the guidance\r\nof a wife, to become very noble. She interested herself intensely in\r\nbalancing the respective merits of the engaged couple, and after her call\r\nupon Miss Woodburn in her new character she prided herself upon\r\nrecognizing the worth of some strictly Southern qualities in her, while\r\nmaintaining the general average of New England superiority. She could not\r\nreconcile herself to the Virginian custom illustrated in her having been\r\nchristened with the surname of Madison; and she said that its pet form of\r\nMad, which Fulkerson promptly invented, only made it more ridiculous.\r\n\r\nFulkerson was slower in telling Beaton. He was afraid, somehow, of\r\nBeaton\'s taking the matter in the cynical way; Miss Woodburn said she\r\nwould break off the engagement if Beaton was left to guess it or find it\r\nout by accident, and then Fulkerson plucked up his courage. Beaton\r\nreceived the news with gravity, and with a sort of melancholy meekness\r\nthat strongly moved Fulkerson\'s sympathy, and made him wish that Beaton\r\nwas engaged, too.\r\n\r\nIt made Beaton feel very old; it somehow left him behind and forgotten;\r\nin a manner, it made him feel trifled with. Something of the\r\nunfriendliness of fate seemed to overcast his resentment, and he allowed\r\nthe sadness of his conviction that he had not the means to marry on to\r\ntinge his recognition of the fact that Alma Leighton would not have\r\nwanted him to marry her if he had. He was now often in that martyr mood\r\nin which he wished to help his father; not only to deny himself Chianti,\r\nbut to forego a fur-lined overcoat which he intended to get for the\r\nwinter, He postponed the moment of actual sacrifice as regarded the\r\nChianti, and he bought the overcoat in an anguish of self-reproach. He\r\nwore it the first evening after he got it in going to call upon the\r\nLeightons, and it seemed to him a piece of ghastly irony when Alma\r\ncomplimented his picturesqueness in it and asked him to let her sketch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can sketch me," he said, with so much gloom that it made her\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"If you think it\'s so serious, I\'d rather not."\r\n\r\n"No, no! Go ahead! How do you want me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, fling yourself down on a chair in one of your attitudes of studied\r\nnegligence; and twist one corner of your mustache with affected absence\r\nof mind."\r\n\r\n"And you think I\'m always studied, always affected?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t ask you what you said."\r\n\r\n"And I won\'t tell you what I think."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I know what you think."\r\n\r\n"What made you ask, then?" The girl laughed again with the satisfaction\r\nof her sex in cornering a man.\r\n\r\nBeaton made a show of not deigning to reply, and put himself in the pose\r\nshe suggested, frowning.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s it. But a little more animation--\r\n\r\n  "\'As when a great thought strikes along the brain,\r\n   And flushes all the cheek.\'"\r\n\r\nShe put her forehead down on the back of her hand and laughed again. "You\r\nought to be photographed. You look as if you were sitting for it."\r\n\r\nBeaton said: "That\'s because I know I am being photographed, in one way.\r\nI don\'t think you ought to call me affected. I never am so with you; I\r\nknow it wouldn\'t be of any use."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Beaton, you flatter."\r\n\r\n"No, I never flatter you."\r\n\r\n"I meant you flattered yourself."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. Imagine."\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean. You think I can\'t be sincere with anybody."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"That you can\'t--try." Alma gave another victorious laugh.\r\n\r\nMiss Woodburn and Fulkerson would once have both feigned a great interest\r\nin Alma\'s sketching Beaton, and made it the subject of talk, in which\r\nthey approached as nearly as possible the real interest of their lives.\r\nNow they frankly remained away in the dining-room, which was very cozy\r\nafter the dinner had disappeared; the colonel sat with his lamp and paper\r\nin the gallery beyond; Mrs. Leighton was about her housekeeping affairs,\r\nin the content she always felt when Alma was with Beaton.\r\n\r\n"They seem to be having a pretty good time in there," said Fulkerson,\r\ndetaching himself from his own absolute good time as well as he could.\r\n\r\n"At least Alma does," said Miss Woodburn.\r\n\r\n"Do you think she cares for him?"\r\n\r\n"Quahte as moch as he desoves."\r\n\r\n"What makes you all down on Beaton around here? He\'s not such a bad\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"We awe not all doan on him. Mrs. Leighton isn\'t doan on him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess if it was the old lady, there wouldn\'t be much question\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and Alma said, "They seem to be greatly amused with\r\nsomething in there."\r\n\r\n"Me, probably," said Beaton. "I seem to amuse everybody to-night."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you always?"\r\n\r\n"I always amuse you, I\'m afraid, Alma."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him as if she were going to snub him openly for using her\r\nname; but apparently she decided to do it covertly. "You didn\'t at first.\r\nI really used to believe you could be serious, once."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you believe it again? Now?"\r\n\r\n"Not when you put on that wind-harp stop."\r\n\r\n"Wetmore has been talking to you about me. He would sacrifice his best\r\nfriend to a phrase. He spends his time making them."\r\n\r\n"He\'s made some very pretty ones about you."\r\n\r\n"Like the one you just quoted?"\r\n\r\n"No, not exactly. He admires you ever so much. He says" She stopped,\r\nteasingly.\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"He says you could be almost anything you wished, if you didn\'t wish to\r\nbe everything."\r\n\r\n"That sounds more like the school of Wetmore. That\'s what you say, Alma.\r\nWell, if there were something you wished me to be, I could be it."\r\n\r\n"We might adapt Kingsley: \'Be good, sweet man, and let who will be\r\nclever.\'" He could not help laughing. She went on: "I always thought that\r\nwas the most patronizing and exasperating thing ever addressed to a human\r\ngirl; and we\'ve had to stand a good deal in our time. I should like to\r\nhave it applied to the other \'sect\' a while. As if any girl that was a\r\ngirl would be good if she had the remotest chance of being clever."\r\n\r\n"Then you wouldn\'t wish me to be good?" Beaton asked.\r\n\r\n"Not if you were a girl."\r\n\r\n"You want to shock me. Well, I suppose I deserve it. But if I were\r\none-tenth part as good as you are, Alma, I should have a lighter heart\r\nthan I have now. I know that I\'m fickle, but I\'m not false, as you think\r\nI am."\r\n\r\n"Who said I thought you were false?"\r\n\r\n"No one," said Beaton. "It isn\'t necessary, when you look it--live it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! I didn\'t know I devoted my whole time to the subject."\r\n\r\n"I know I\'m despicable. I could tell you something--the history of this\r\nday, even--that would make you despise me." Beaton had in mind his\r\npurchase of the overcoat, which Alma was getting in so effectively, with\r\nthe money he ought to have sent his father. "But," he went on, darkly,\r\nwith a sense that what he was that moment suffering for his selfishness\r\nmust somehow be a kind of atonement, which would finally leave him to the\r\nguiltless enjoyment of the overcoat, "you wouldn\'t believe the depths of\r\nbaseness I could descend to."\r\n\r\n"I would try," said Alma, rapidly shading the collar, "if you\'d give me\r\nsome hint."\r\n\r\nBeaton had a sudden wish to pour out his remorse to her, but he was\r\nafraid of her laughing at him. He said to himself that this was a very\r\nwholesome fear, and that if he could always have her at hand he should\r\nnot make a fool of himself so often. A man conceives of such an office as\r\nthe very noblest for a woman; he worships her for it if he is\r\nmagnanimous. But Beaton was silent, and Alma put back her head for the\r\nright distance on her sketch. "Mr. Fulkerson thinks you are the sublimest\r\nof human beings for advising him to get Colonel Woodburn to interview Mr.\r\nDryfoos about Lindau. What have you ever done with your Judas?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t done anything with it. Nadel thought he would take hold of it\r\nat one time, but he dropped it again. After all, I don\'t suppose it could\r\nbe popularized. Fulkerson wanted to offer it as a premium to subscribers\r\nfor \'Every Other Week,\' but I sat down on that."\r\n\r\nAlma could not feel the absurdity of this, and she merely said, "\'Every\r\nOther Week\' seems to be going on just the same as ever."\r\n\r\n"Yes, the trouble has all blown over, I believe. Fulkerson," said Beaton,\r\nwith a return to what they were saying, "has managed the whole business\r\nvery well. But he exaggerates the value of my advice."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," Alma suggested, vaguely. "Or, no! Excuse me! He couldn\'t,\r\nhe couldn\'t!" She laughed delightedly at Beaton\'s foolish look of\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nHe tried to recover his dignity in saying, "He\'s \'a very good fellow, and\r\nhe deserves his happiness."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Alma, perversely. "Does any one deserve happiness?"\r\n\r\n"I know I don\'t," sighed Beaton.\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t get it."\r\n\r\n"I certainly don\'t get it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but that isn\'t the reason."\r\n\r\n"What is?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the secret of the universe," She bit in her lower lip, and looked\r\nat him with eyes, of gleaming fun.\r\n\r\n"Are you never serious?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"With serious people always."\r\n\r\n"I am serious; and you have the secret of my happiness--" He threw\r\nhimself impulsively forward in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Oh, pose, pose!" she cried.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t pose," he answered, "and you have got to listen to me. You know\r\nI\'m in love with you; and I know that once you cared for me. Can\'t that\r\ntime--won\'t it--come back again? Try to think so, Alma!"\r\n\r\n"No," she said, briefly and seriously enough.\r\n\r\n"But that seems impossible. What is it I\'ve done what have you against\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. But that time is past. I couldn\'t recall it if I wished. Why\r\ndid you bring it up? You\'ve broken your word. You know I wouldn\'t have\r\nlet you keep coming here if you hadn\'t promised never to refer to it."\r\n\r\n"How could I help it? With that happiness near us--Fulkerson--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s that? I might have known it!"\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t that--it\'s something far deeper. But if it\'s nothing you\r\nhave against me, what is it, Alma, that keeps you from caring for me now\r\nas you did then? I haven\'t changed."\r\n\r\n"But I have. I shall never care for you again, Mr. Beaton; you might as\r\nwell understand it once for all. Don\'t think it\'s anything in yourself,\r\nor that I think you unworthy of me. I\'m not so self-satisfied as that; I\r\nknow very well that I\'m not a perfect character, and that I\'ve no claim\r\non perfection in anybody else. I think women who want that are fools;\r\nthey won\'t get it, and they don\'t deserve it. But I\'ve learned a good\r\ndeal more about myself than I knew in St. Barnaby, and a life of work, of\r\nart, and of art alone that\'s what I\'ve made up my mind to."\r\n\r\n"A woman that\'s made up her mind to that has no heart to hinder her!"\r\n\r\n"Would a man have that had done so?"\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t believe you, Alma. You\'re merely laughing at me. And,\r\nbesides, with me you needn\'t give up art. We could work together. You\r\nknow how much I admire your talent. I believe I could help it--serve it;\r\nI would be its willing slave, and yours, Heaven knows!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any slave--nor any slavery. I want to be free always. Now\r\ndo you see? I don\'t care for you, and I never could in the old way; but I\r\nshould have to care for some one more than I believe I ever shall to give\r\nup my work. Shall we go on?" She looked at her sketch.\r\n\r\n"No, we shall not go on," he said, gloomily, as he rose.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you blame me," she said, rising too.\r\n\r\n"Oh no! I blame no one--or only myself. I threw my chance away."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you see that; and I\'m glad you did it. You don\'t believe me, of\r\ncourse. Why do men think life can be only the one thing to women? And if\r\nyou come to the selfish view, who are the happy women? I\'m sure that if\r\nwork doesn\'t fail me, health won\'t, and happiness won\'t."\r\n\r\n"But you could work on with me--"\r\n\r\n"Second fiddle. Do you suppose I shouldn\'t be woman enough to wish my\r\nwork always less and lower than yours? At least I\'ve heart enough for\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heart enough for anything, Alma. I was a fool to say you hadn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I think the women who keep their hearts have an even chance, at least,\r\nof having heart--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, there\'s where you\'re wrong!"\r\n\r\n"But mine isn\'t mine to give you, anyhow. And now I don\'t want you ever\r\nto speak to me about this again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s no danger!" he cried, bitterly. "I shall never willingly see\r\nyou again."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as you like, Mr. Beaton. We\'ve had to be very frank, but I don\'t\r\nsee why we shouldn\'t be friends. Still, we needn\'t, if you don\'t like."\r\n\r\n"And I may come--I may come here--as--as usual?"\r\n\r\n"Why, if you can consistently," she said, with a smile, and she held out\r\nher hand to him.\r\n\r\nHe went home dazed, and feeling as if it were a bad joke that had been\r\nput upon him. At least the affair went so deep that it estranged the\r\naspect of his familiar studio. Some of the things in it were not very\r\nfamiliar; he had spent lately a great deal on rugs, on stuffs, on\r\nJapanese bric-a-brac. When he saw these things in the shops he had felt\r\nthat he must have them; that they were necessary to him; and he was\r\npartly in debt for them, still without having sent any of his earnings to\r\npay his father. As he looked at them now he liked to fancy something\r\nweird and conscious in them as the silent witnesses of a broken life. He\r\nfelt about among some of the smaller objects on the mantel for his pipe.\r\nBefore he slept he was aware, in the luxury of his despair, of a remote\r\nrelief, an escape; and, after all, the understanding he had come to with\r\nAlma was only the explicit formulation of terms long tacit between them.\r\nBeaton would have been puzzled more than he knew if she had taken him\r\nseriously. It was inevitable that he should declare himself in love with\r\nher; but he was not disappointed at her rejection of his love; perhaps\r\nnot so much as he would have been at its acceptance, though he tried to\r\nthink otherwise, and to give himself airs of tragedy. He did not really\r\nfeel that the result was worse than what had gone before, and it left him\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nBut he did not go to the Leightons again for so long a time that Mrs.\r\nLeighton asked Alma what had happened. Alma told her.\r\n\r\n"And he won\'t come any more?" her mother sighed, with reserved censure.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think he will. He couldn\'t very well come the next night. But he\r\nhas the habit of coming, and with Mr. Beaton habit is everything--even\r\nthe habit of thinking he\'s in love with some one."\r\n\r\n"Alma," said her mother, "I don\'t think it\'s very nice for a girl to let\r\na young man keep coming to see her after she\'s refused him."\r\n\r\n"Why not, if it amuses him and doesn\'t hurt the girl?"\r\n\r\n"But it does hurt her, Alma. It--it\'s indelicate. It isn\'t fair to him;\r\nit gives him hopes."\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma, it hasn\'t happened in the given case yet. If Mr. Beaton\r\ncomes again, I won\'t see him, and you can forbid him the house."\r\n\r\n"If I could only feel sure, Alma," said her mother, taking up another\r\nbranch of the inquiry, "that you really knew your own mind, I should be\r\neasier about it."\r\n\r\n"Then you can rest perfectly quiet, mamma. I do know my own mind; and,\r\nwhat\'s worse, I know Mr. Beaton\'s mind."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean that he spoke to me the other night simply because Mr.\r\nFulkerson\'s engagement had broken him all up."\r\n\r\n"What expressions!" Mrs. Leighton lamented.\r\n\r\n"He let it out himself," Alma went on. "And you wouldn\'t have thought it\r\nwas very flattering yourself. When I\'m made love to, after this, I prefer\r\nto be made love to in an off-year, when there isn\'t another engaged\r\ncouple anywhere about."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him that, Alma?"\r\n\r\n"Tell him that! What do you mean, mamma? I may be indelicate, but I\'m not\r\nquite so indelicate as that."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean you were indelicate, really, Alma, but I wanted to warn\r\nyou. I think Mr. Beaton was very much in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, so did he!"\r\n\r\n"And you didn\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, for the time being. I suppose he\'s very much in earnest with\r\nMiss Vance at times, and with Miss Dryfoos at others. Sometimes he\'s a\r\npainter, and sometimes he\'s an architect, and sometimes he\'s a sculptor.\r\nHe has too many gifts--too many tastes."\r\n\r\n"And if Miss Vance and Miss Dryfoos--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do say Sculpture and Architecture, mamma! It\'s getting so dreadfully\r\npersonal!"\r\n\r\n"Alma, you know that I only wish to get at your real feeling in the\r\nmatter."\r\n\r\n"And you know that I don\'t want to let you--especially when I haven\'t got\r\nany real feeling in the matter. But I should think--speaking in the\r\nabstract entirely--that if either of those arts was ever going to be in\r\nearnest about him, it would want his exclusive devotion for a week at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know," said Mrs. Leighton, "that he was doing anything now at\r\nthe others. I thought he was entirely taken up with his work on \'Every\r\nOther Week.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is! he is!"\r\n\r\n"And you certainly can\'t say, my dear, that he hasn\'t been very\r\nkind--very useful to you, in that matter."\r\n\r\n"And so I ought to have said yes out of gratitude? Thank you, mamma! I\r\ndidn\'t know you held me so cheap."\r\n\r\n"You know whether I hold you cheap or not, Alma. I don\'t want you to\r\ncheapen yourself. I don\'t want you to trifle with any one. I want you to\r\nbe honest with yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well, come now, mamma! Suppose you begin. I\'ve been perfectly honest\r\nwith myself, and I\'ve been honest with Mr. Beaton. I don\'t care for him,\r\nand I\'ve told him I didn\'t; so he may be supposed to know it. If he comes\r\nhere after this, he\'ll come as a plain, unostentatious friend of the\r\nfamily, and it\'s for you to say whether he shall come in that capacity or\r\nnot. I hope you won\'t trifle with him, and let him get the notion that\r\nhe\'s coming on any other basis."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton felt the comfort of the critical attitude far too keenly to\r\nabandon it for anything constructive. She only said, "You know very well,\r\nAlma, that\'s a matter I can have nothing to do with."\r\n\r\n"Then you leave him entirely to me?"\r\n\r\n"I hope you will regard his right to candid and open treatment."\r\n\r\n"He\'s had nothing but the most open and candid treatment from me, mamma.\r\nIt\'s you that wants to play fast and loose with him. And, to tell you the\r\ntruth, I believe he would like that a good deal better; I believe that,\r\nif there\'s anything he hates, it\'s openness and candor." Alma laughed,\r\nand put her arms round her mother, who could not help laughing a little,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe winter did not renew for Christine and Mela the social opportunity\r\nwhich the spring had offered. After the musicale at Mrs. Horn\'s, they\r\nboth made their party-call, as Mela said, in due season; but they did not\r\nfind Mrs. Horn at home, and neither she nor Miss Vance came to see them\r\nafter people returned to town in the fall. They tried to believe for a\r\ntime that Mrs. Horn had not got their cards; this pretence failed them,\r\nand they fell back upon their pride, or rather Christine\'s pride. Mela\r\nhad little but her good-nature to avail her in any exigency, and if Mrs.\r\nHorn or Miss Vance had come to call after a year of neglect, she would\r\nhave received them as amiably as if they had not lost a day in coming.\r\nBut Christine had drawn a line beyond which they would not have been\r\nforgiven; and she had planned the words and the behavior with which she\r\nwould have punished them if they had appeared then. Neither sister\r\nimagined herself in anywise inferior to them; but Christine was\r\nsuspicious, at least, and it was Mela who invented the hypothesis of the\r\nlost cards. As nothing happened to prove or to disprove the fact, she\r\nsaid, "I move we put Coonrod up to gittun\' it out of Miss Vance, at some\r\nof their meetun\'s."\r\n\r\n"If you do," said Christine, "I\'ll kill you."\r\n\r\nChristine, however, had the visits of Beaton to console her, and, if\r\nthese seemed to have no definite aim, she was willing to rest in the\r\npleasure they gave her vanity; but Mela had nothing. Sometimes she even\r\nwished they were all back on the farm.\r\n\r\n"It would be the best thing for both of you," said Mrs. Dryfoos, in\r\nanswer to such a burst of desperation. "I don\'t think New York is any\r\nplace for girls."\r\n\r\n"Well, what I hate, mother," said Mela, "is, it don\'t seem to be any\r\nplace for young men, either." She found this so good when she had said it\r\nthat she laughed over it till Christine was angry.\r\n\r\n"A body would think there had never been any joke before."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see as it\'s a joke," said Mrs. Dryfoos. "It\'s the plain truth."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t mind her, mother," said Mela. "She\'s put out because her old\r\nMr. Beaton ha\'r\'t been round for a couple o\' weeks. If you don\'t watch\r\nout, that fellow \'ll give you the slip yit, Christine, after all your\r\npains."\r\n\r\n"Well, there ain\'t anybody to give you the slip, Mela," Christine clawed\r\nback.\r\n\r\n"No; I ha\'n\'t ever set my traps for anybody." This was what Mela said for\r\nwant of a better retort; but it was not quite true. When Kendricks came\r\nwith Beaton to call after her father\'s dinner, she used all her cunning\r\nto ensnare him, and she had him to herself as long as Beaton stayed;\r\nDryfoos sent down word that he was not very well and had gone to bed. The\r\nnovelty of Mela had worn off for Kendricks, and she found him, as she\r\nfrankly told him, not half as entertaining as he was at Mrs. Horn\'s; but\r\nshe did her best with him as the only flirtable material which had yet\r\ncome to her hand. It would have been her ideal to have the young men stay\r\ntill past midnight, and her father come down-stairs in his stocking-feet\r\nand tell them it was time to go. But they made a visit of decorous\r\nbrevity, and Kendricks did not come again. She met him afterward, once,\r\nas she was crossing the pavement in Union Square to get into her coupe,\r\nand made the most of him; but it was necessarily very little, and so he\r\npassed out of her life without having left any trace in her heart, though\r\nMela had a heart that she would have put at the disposition of almost any\r\nyoung man that wanted it. Kendricks himself, Manhattan cockney as he was,\r\nwith scarcely more outlook into the average American nature than if he\r\nhad been kept a prisoner in New York society all his days, perceived a\r\nproperty in her which forbade him as a man of conscience to trifle with\r\nher; something earthly good and kind, if it was simple and vulgar. In\r\nrevising his impressions of her, it seemed to him that she would come\r\neven to better literary effect if this were recognized in her; and it\r\nmade her sacred, in spite of her willingness to fool and to be fooled, in\r\nher merely human quality. After all, he saw that she wished honestly to\r\nlove and to be loved, and the lures she threw out to that end seemed to\r\nhim pathetic rather than ridiculous; he could not join Beaton in laughing\r\nat her; and he did not like Beaton\'s laughing at the other girl, either.\r\nIt seemed to Kendricks, with the code of honor which he mostly kept to\r\nhimself because he was a little ashamed to find there were so few others\r\nlike it, that if Beaton cared nothing for the other girl--and Christine\r\nappeared simply detestable to Kendricks--he had better keep away from\r\nher, and not give her the impression he was in love with her. He rather\r\nfancied that this was the part of a gentleman, and he could not have\r\npenetrated to that aesthetic and moral complexity which formed the\r\nconsciousness of a nature like Beaton\'s and was chiefly a torment to\r\nitself; he could not have conceived of the wayward impulses indulged at\r\nevery moment in little things till the straight highway was traversed and\r\nwell-nigh lost under their tangle. To do whatever one likes is finally to\r\ndo nothing that one likes, even though one continues to do what one will;\r\nbut Kendricks, though a sage of twenty-seven, was still too young to\r\nunderstand this.\r\n\r\nBeaton scarcely understood it himself, perhaps because he was not yet\r\ntwenty-seven. He only knew that his will was somehow sick; that it spent\r\nitself in caprices, and brought him no happiness from the fulfilment of\r\nthe most vehement wish. But he was aware that his wishes grew less and\r\nless vehement; he began to have a fear that some time he might have none\r\nat all. It seemed to him that if he could once do something that was\r\nthoroughly distasteful to himself, he might make a beginning in the right\r\ndirection; but when he tried this on a small scale, it failed, and it\r\nseemed stupid. Some sort of expiation was the thing he needed, he was\r\nsure; but he could not think of anything in particular to expiate; a man\r\ncould not expiate his temperament, and his temperament was what Beaton\r\ndecided to be at fault. He perceived that it went deeper than even fate\r\nwould have gone; he could have fulfilled an evil destiny and had done\r\nwith it, however terrible. His trouble was that he could not escape from\r\nhimself; and, for the most part, he justified himself in refusing to try.\r\nAfter he had come to that distinct understanding with Alma Leighton, and\r\nexperienced the relief it really gave him, he thought for a while that if\r\nit had fallen out otherwise, and she had put him in charge of her\r\ndestiny, he might have been better able to manage his own. But as it was,\r\nhe could only drift, and let all other things take their course. It was\r\nnecessary that he should go to see her afterward, to show her that he was\r\nequal to the event; but he did not go so often, and he went rather\r\noftener to the Dryfooses; it was not easy to see Margaret Vance, except\r\non the society terms. With much sneering and scorning, he fulfilled the\r\nduties to Mrs. Horn without which he knew he should be dropped from her\r\nlist; but one might go to many of her Thursdays without getting many\r\nwords with her niece. Beaton hardly knew whether he wanted many; the girl\r\nkept the charm of her innocent stylishness; but latterly she wanted to\r\ntalk more about social questions than about the psychical problems that\r\nyoung people usually debate so personally. Son of the working-people as\r\nhe was, Beaton had never cared anything about such matters; he did not\r\nknow about them or wish to know; he was perhaps too near them. Besides,\r\nthere was an embarrassment, at least on her part, concerning the\r\nDryfooses. She was too high-minded to blame him for having tempted her to\r\nher failure with them by his talk about them; but she was conscious of\r\navoiding them in her talk. She had decided not to renew the effort she\r\nhad made in the spring; because she could not do them good as\r\nfellow-creatures needing food and warmth and work, and she would not try\r\nto befriend them socially; she had a horror of any such futile\r\nsentimentality. She would have liked to account to Beaton in this way for\r\na course which she suspected he must have heard their comments upon, but\r\nshe did not quite know how to do it; she could not be sure how much or\r\nhow little he cared for them. Some tentative approaches which she made\r\ntoward explanation were met with such eager disclaim of personal interest\r\nthat she knew less than before what to think; and she turned the talk\r\nfrom the sisters to the brother, whom it seemed she still continued to\r\nmeet in their common work among the poor.\r\n\r\n"He seems very different," she ventured.\r\n\r\n"Oh, quite," said Beaton. "He\'s the kind of person that you might suppose\r\ngave the Catholics a hint for the cloistral life; he\'s a cloistered\r\nnature--the nature that atones and suffers for. But he\'s awfully dull\r\ncompany, don\'t you think? I never can get anything out of him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s very much in earnest."\r\n\r\n"Remorselessly. We\'ve got a profane and mundane creature there at the\r\noffice who runs us all, and it\'s shocking merely to see the contact of\r\nthe tyro natures. When Fulkerson gets to joking Dryfoos--he likes to put\r\nhis joke in the form of a pretence that Dryfoos is actuated by a selfish\r\nmotive, that he has an eye to office, and is working up a political\r\ninterest for himself on the East Side--it\'s something inexpressible."\r\n\r\n"I should think so," said Miss Vance, with such lofty disapproval that\r\nBeaton felt himself included in it for having merely told what caused it.\r\nHe could not help saying, in natural rebellion, "Well, the man of one\r\nidea is always a little ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"When his idea is right?" she demanded. "A right idea can\'t be\r\nridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I only said the man that held it was. He\'s flat; he has no relief,\r\nno projection."\r\n\r\nShe seemed unable to answer, and he perceived that he had silenced her to\r\nhis own disadvantage. It appeared to Beaton that she was becoming a\r\nlittle too exacting for comfort in her idealism. He put down the cup of\r\ntea he had been tasting, and said, in his solemn staccato: "I must go.\r\nGood-bye!" and got instantly away from her, with an effect he had of\r\nhaving suddenly thought of something imperative.\r\n\r\nHe went up to Mrs. Horn for a moment\'s hail and farewell, and felt\r\nhimself subtly detained by her through fugitive passages of conversation\r\nwith half a dozen other people. He fancied that at crises of this strange\r\ninterview Mrs. Horn was about to become confidential with him, and\r\nconfidential, of all things, about her niece. She ended by not having\r\npalpably been so. In fact, the concern in her mind would have been\r\ndifficult to impart to a young man, and after several experiments Mrs.\r\nHorn found it impossible to say that she wished Margaret could somehow be\r\ninterested in lower things than those which occupied her. She had watched\r\nwith growing anxiety the girl\'s tendency to various kinds of\r\nself-devotion. She had dark hours in which she even feared her entire\r\nwithdrawal from the world in a life of good works. Before now, girls had\r\nentered the Protestant sisterhoods, which appeal so potently to the young\r\nand generous imagination, and Margaret was of just the temperament to be\r\ninfluenced by them. During the past summer she had been unhappy at her\r\nseparation from the cares that had engrossed her more and more as their\r\nstay in the city drew to an end in the spring, and she had hurried her\r\naunt back to town earlier in the fall than she would have chosen to come.\r\nMargaret had her correspondents among the working-women whom she\r\nbefriended. Mrs. Horn was at one time alarmed to find that Margaret was\r\nactually promoting a strike of the button-hole workers. This, of course,\r\nhad its ludicrous side, in connection with a young lady in good society,\r\nand a person of even so little humor as Mrs. Horn could not help seeing\r\nit. At the same time, she could not help foreboding the worst from it;\r\nshe was afraid that Margaret\'s health would give way under the strain,\r\nand that if she did not go into a sisterhood she would at least go into a\r\ndecline. She began the winter with all such counteractive measures as she\r\ncould employ. At an age when such things weary, she threw herself into\r\nthe pleasures of society with the hope of dragging Margaret after her;\r\nand a sympathetic witness must have followed with compassion her course\r\nfrom ball to ball, from reception to reception, from parlor-reading to\r\nparlor-reading, from musicale to musicale, from play to play, from opera\r\nto opera. She tasted, after she had practically renounced them, the\r\nbitter and the insipid flavors of fashionable amusement, in the hope that\r\nMargaret might find them sweet, and now at the end she had to own to\r\nherself that she had failed. It was coming Lent again, and the girl had\r\nonly grown thinner and more serious with the diversions that did not\r\ndivert her from the baleful works of beneficence on which Mrs. Horn felt\r\nthat she was throwing her youth away. Margaret could have borne either\r\nalone, but together they were wearing her out. She felt it a duty to\r\nundergo the pleasures her aunt appointed for her, but she could not\r\nforego the other duties in which she found her only pleasure.\r\n\r\nShe kept up her music still because she could employ it at the meetings\r\nfor the entertainment, and, as she hoped, the elevation of her\r\nworking-women; but she neglected the other aesthetic interests which once\r\noccupied her; and, at sight of Beaton talking with her, Mrs. Horn caught\r\nat the hope that he might somehow be turned to account in reviving\r\nMargaret\'s former interest in art. She asked him if Mr. Wetmore had his\r\nclasses that winter as usual; and she said she wished Margaret could be\r\ninduced to go again: Mr. Wetmore always said that she did not draw very\r\nwell, but that she had a great deal of feeling for it, and her work was\r\ninteresting. She asked, were the Leightons in town again; and she\r\nmurmured a regret that she had not been able to see anything of them,\r\nwithout explaining why; she said she had a fancy that if Margaret knew\r\nMiss Leighton, and what she was doing, it might stimulate her, perhaps.\r\nShe supposed Miss Leighton was still going on with her art? Beaton said,\r\nOh yes, he believed so.\r\n\r\nBut his manner did not encourage Mrs. Horn to pursue her aims in that\r\ndirection, and she said, with a sigh, she wished he still had a class;\r\nshe always fancied that Margaret got more good from his instruction than\r\nfrom any one else\'s.\r\n\r\nHe said that she was very good; but there was really nobody who knew half\r\nas much as Wetmore, or could make any one understand half as much. Mrs.\r\nHorn was afraid, she said, that Mr. Wetmore\'s terrible sincerity\r\ndiscouraged Margaret; he would not let her have any illusions about the\r\noutcome of what she was doing; and did not Mr. Beaton think that some\r\nillusion was necessary with young people? Of course, it was very nice of\r\nMr. Wetmore to be so honest, but it did not always seem to be the wisest\r\nthing. She begged Mr. Beaton to try to think of some one who would be a\r\nlittle less severe. Her tone assumed a deeper interest in the people who\r\nwere coming up and going away, and Beaton perceived that he was\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nHe went away with vanity flattered by the sense of having been appealed\r\nto concerning Margaret, and then he began to chafe at what she had said\r\nof Wetmore\'s honesty, apropos of her wish that he still had a class\r\nhimself. Did she mean, confound her? that he was insincere, and would let\r\nMiss Vance suppose she had more talent than she really had? The more\r\nBeaton thought of this, the more furious he became, and the more he was\r\nconvinced that something like it had been unconsciously if not\r\nconsciously in her mind. He framed some keen retorts, to the general\r\neffect that with the atmosphere of illusion preserved so completely at\r\nhome, Miss Vance hardly needed it in her art studies. Having just\r\ndetermined never to go near Mrs. Horn\'s Thursdays again, he decided to go\r\nonce more, in order to plant this sting in her capacious but somewhat\r\ncallous bosom; and he planned how he would lead the talk up to the point\r\nfrom which he should launch it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he felt the need of some present solace, such as only\r\nunqualified worship could give him; a cruel wish to feel his power in\r\nsome direction where, even if it were resisted, it could not be overcome,\r\ndrove him on. That a woman who was to Beaton the embodiment of\r\nartificiality should intimate, however innocently--the innocence made it\r\nall the worse--that he was less honest than Wetmore, whom he knew to be\r\nso much more honest, was something that must be retaliated somewhere\r\nbefore his self-respect could be restored. It was only five o\'clock, and\r\nhe went on up-town to the Dryfooses\', though he had been there only the\r\nnight before last. He asked for the ladies, and Mrs. Mandel received him.\r\n\r\n"The young ladies are down-town shopping," she said, "but I am very glad\r\nof the opportunity of seeing you alone, Mr. Beaton. You know I lived\r\nseveral years in Europe."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beaton, wondering what that could have to do with her\r\npleasure in seeing him alone. "I believe so?" He involuntarily gave his\r\nwords the questioning inflection.\r\n\r\n"You have lived abroad, too, and so you won\'t find what I am going to ask\r\nso strange. Mr. Beaton, why do you come so much to this house?" Mrs.\r\nMandel bent forward with an aspect of ladylike interest and smiled.\r\n\r\nBeaton frowned. "Why do I come so much?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Why do I--Excuse me, Mrs. Mandel, but will you allow me to ask why you\r\nask?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly. There\'s no reason why I shouldn\'t say, for I wish you to\r\nbe very frank with me. I ask because there are two young ladies in this\r\nhouse; and, in a certain way, I have to take the place of a mother to\r\nthem. I needn\'t explain why; you know all the people here, and you\r\nunderstand. I have nothing to say about them, but I should not be\r\nspeaking to you now if they were not all rather helpless people. They do\r\nnot know the world they have come to live in here, and they cannot help\r\nthemselves or one another. But you do know it, Mr. Beaton, and I am sure\r\nyou know just how much or how little you mean by coming here. You are\r\neither interested in one of these young girls or you are not. If you are,\r\nI have nothing more to say. If you are not--" Mrs. Mandel continued to\r\nsmile, but the smile had grown more perfunctory, and it had an icy gleam.\r\n\r\nBeaton looked at her with surprise that he gravely kept to himself. He\r\nhad always regarded her as a social nullity, with a kind of pity, to be\r\nsure, as a civilized person living among such people as the Dryfooses,\r\nbut not without a humorous contempt; he had thought of her as Mandel, and\r\nsometimes as Old Mandel, though she was not half a score of years his\r\nsenior, and was still well on the sunny side of forty. He reddened, and\r\nthen turned an angry pallor. "Excuse me again, Mrs. Mandel. Do you ask\r\nthis from the young ladies?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," she said, with the best temper, and with something in\r\nher tone that convicted Beaton of vulgarity, in putting his question of\r\nher authority in the form of a sneer. "As I have suggested, they would\r\nhardly know how to help themselves at all in such a matter. I have no\r\nobjection to saying that I ask it from the father of the young ladies. Of\r\ncourse, in and for myself I should have no right to know anything about\r\nyour affairs. I assure you the duty of knowing isn\'t very pleasant." The\r\nlittle tremor in her clear voice struck Beaton as something rather nice.\r\n\r\n"I can very well believe that, Mrs. Mandel," he said, with a dreamy\r\nsadness in his own. He lifted his eyes and looked into hers. "If I told\r\nyou that I cared nothing about them in the way you intimate?"\r\n\r\n"Then I should prefer to let you characterize your own conduct in\r\ncontinuing to come here for the year past, as you have done, and tacitly\r\nleading them on to infer differently." They both mechanically kept up the\r\nfiction of plurality in speaking of Christine, but there was no doubt in\r\nthe mind of either which of the young ladies the other meant. A good many\r\nthoughts went through Beaton\'s mind, and none of them were flattering. He\r\nhad not been unconscious that the part he had played toward this girl was\r\nignoble, and that it had grown meaner as the fancy which her beauty had\r\nat first kindled in him had grown cooler. He was aware that of late he\r\nhad been amusing himself with her passion in a way that was not less than\r\ncruel, not because he wished to do so, but because he was listless and\r\nwished nothing. He rose in saying: "I might be a little more lenient than\r\nyou think, Mrs. Mandel; but I won\'t trouble you with any palliating\r\ntheory. I will not come any more."\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and Mrs. Mandel said, "Of course, it\'s only your action that I\r\nam concerned with."\r\n\r\nShe seemed to him merely triumphant, and he could not conceive what it\r\nhad cost her to nerve herself up to her too easy victory. He left Mrs.\r\nMandel to a far harder lot than had fallen to him, and he went away\r\nhating her as an enemy who had humiliated him at a moment when he\r\nparticularly needed exalting. It was really very simple for him to stop\r\ngoing to see Christine Dryfoos, but it was not at all simple for Mrs.\r\nMandel to deal with the consequences of his not coming. He only thought\r\nhow lightly she had stopped him, and the poor woman whom he had left\r\ntrembling for what she had been obliged to do embodied for him the\r\nconscience that accused him of unpleasant things.\r\n\r\n"By heavens! this is piling it up," he said to himself through his set\r\nteeth, realizing how it had happened right on top of that stupid insult\r\nfrom Mrs. Horn. Now he should have to give up his place on \'Every Other\r\nWeek; he could not keep that, under the circumstances, even if some\r\npretence were not made to get rid of him; he must hurry and anticipate\r\nany such pretence; he must see Fulkerson at once; he wondered where he\r\nshould find him at that hour. He thought, with bitterness so real that it\r\ngave him a kind of tragical satisfaction, how certainly he could find him\r\na little later at Mrs. Leighton\'s; and Fulkerson\'s happiness became an\r\nadded injury.\r\n\r\nThe thing had, of course, come about just at the wrong time. There never\r\nhad been a time when Beaton needed money more, when he had spent what he\r\nhad and what he expected to have so recklessly. He was in debt to\r\nFulkerson personally and officially for advance payments of salary. The\r\nthought of sending money home made him break into a scoffing laugh, which\r\nhe turned into a cough in order to deceive the passers. What sort of face\r\nshould he go with to Fulkerson and tell him that he renounced his\r\nemployment on \'Every Other Week;\' and what should he do when he had\r\nrenounced it? Take pupils, perhaps; open a class? A lurid conception of a\r\nclass conducted on those principles of shameless flattery at which Mrs.\r\nHorn had hinted--he believed now she had meant to insult him--presented\r\nitself. Why should not he act upon the suggestion? He thought with\r\nloathing for the whole race of women--dabblers in art. How easy the thing\r\nwould be: as easy as to turn back now and tell that old fool\'s girl that\r\nhe loved her, and rake in half his millions. Why should not he do that?\r\nNo one else cared for him; and at a year\'s end, probably, one woman would\r\nbe like another as far as the love was concerned, and probably he should\r\nnot be more tired if the woman were Christine Dryfoos than if she were\r\nMargaret Vance. He kept Alma Leighton out of the question, because at the\r\nbottom of his heart he believed that she must be forever unlike every\r\nother woman to him.\r\n\r\nThe tide of his confused and aimless reverie had carried him far\r\ndown-town, he thought; but when he looked up from it to see where he was\r\nhe found himself on Sixth Avenue, only a little below Thirty-ninth\r\nStreet, very hot and blown; that idiotic fur overcoat was stifling. He\r\ncould not possibly walk down to Eleventh; he did not want to walk even to\r\nthe Elevated station at Thirty-fourth; he stopped at the corner to wait\r\nfor a surface-car, and fell again into his bitter fancies. After a while\r\nhe roused himself and looked up the track, but there was no car coming.\r\nHe found himself beside a policeman, who was lazily swinging his club by\r\nits thong from his wrist.\r\n\r\n"When do you suppose a car will be along?" he asked, rather in a general\r\nsarcasm of the absence of the cars than in any special belief that the\r\npoliceman could tell him.\r\n\r\nThe policeman waited to discharge his tobacco-juice into the gutter. "In\r\nabout a week," he said, nonchalantly.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked Beaton, wondering what the joke could be.\r\n\r\n"Strike," said the policeman. His interest in Beaton\'s ignorance seemed\r\nto overcome his contempt of it. "Knocked off everywhere this morning\r\nexcept Third Avenue and one or two cross-town lines." He spat again and\r\nkept his bulk at its incline over the gutter to glance at a group of men\r\non the corner below: They were neatly dressed, and looked like something\r\nbetter than workingmen, and they had a holiday air of being in their best\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n"Some of the strikers?" asked Beaton.\r\n\r\nThe policeman nodded.\r\n\r\n"Any trouble yet?"\r\n\r\n"There won\'t be any trouble till we begin to move the cars," said the\r\npoliceman.\r\n\r\nBeaton felt a sudden turn of his rage toward the men whose action would\r\nnow force him to walk five blocks and mount the stairs of the Elevated\r\nstation. "If you\'d take out eight or ten of those fellows," he said,\r\nferociously, "and set them up against a wall and shoot them, you\'d save a\r\ngreat deal of bother."\r\n\r\n"I guess we sha\'n\'t have to shoot much," said the policeman, still\r\nswinging his locust. "Anyway, we shant begin it. If it comes to a fight,\r\nthough," he said, with a look at the men under the scooping rim of his\r\nhelmet, "we can drive the whole six thousand of \'em into the East River\r\nwithout pullin\' a trigger."\r\n\r\n"Are there six thousand in it?"\r\n\r\n"About."\r\n\r\n"What do the infernal fools expect to live on?"\r\n\r\n"The interest of their money, I suppose," said the officer, with a grin\r\nof satisfaction in his irony. "It\'s got to run its course. Then they\'ll\r\ncome back with their heads tied up and their tails between their legs,\r\nand plead to be taken on again."\r\n\r\n"If I was a manager of the roads," said Beaton, thinking of how much he\r\nwas already inconvenienced by the strike, and obscurely connecting it as\r\none of the series with the wrongs he had suffered at the hands of Mrs.\r\nHorn and Mrs. Mandel, "I would see them starve before I\'d take them\r\nback--every one of them."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the policeman, impartially, as a man might whom the\r\ncompanies allowed to ride free, but who had made friends with a good many\r\ndrivers and conductors in the course of his free riding, "I guess that\'s\r\nwhat the roads would like to do if they could; but the men are too many\r\nfor them, and there ain\'t enough other men to take their places."\r\n\r\n"No matter," said Beaton, severely. "They can bring in men from other\r\nplaces."\r\n\r\n"Oh, they\'ll do that fast enough," said the policeman.\r\n\r\nA man came out of the saloon on the corner where the strikers were\r\nstanding, noisy drunk, and they began, as they would have said, to have\r\nsome fun with him. The policeman left Beaton, and sauntered slowly down\r\ntoward the group as if in the natural course of an afternoon ramble. On\r\nthe other side of the street Beaton could see another officer sauntering\r\nup from the block below. Looking up and down the avenue, so silent of its\r\nhorse-car bells, he saw a policeman at every corner. It was rather\r\nimpressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe strike made a good deal of talk in the office of \'Every Other Week\'\r\nthat is, it made Fulkerson talk a good deal. He congratulated himself\r\nthat he was not personally incommoded by it, like some of the fellows who\r\nlived uptown, and had not everything under one roof, as it were. He\r\nenjoyed the excitement of it, and he kept the office boy running out to\r\nbuy the extras which the newsmen came crying through the street almost\r\nevery hour with a lamentable, unintelligible noise. He read not only the\r\nlatest intelligence of the strike, but the editorial comments on it,\r\nwhich praised the firm attitude of both parties, and the admirable\r\nmeasures taken by the police to preserve order. Fulkerson enjoyed the\r\ninterviews with the police captains and the leaders of the strike; he\r\nequally enjoyed the attempts of the reporters to interview the road\r\nmanagers, which were so graphically detailed, and with such a fine\r\nfeeling for the right use of scare-heads as to have almost the value of\r\ndirect expression from them, though it seemed that they had resolutely\r\nrefused to speak. He said, at second-hand from the papers, that if the\r\nmen behaved themselves and respected the rights of property, they would\r\nhave public sympathy with them every time; but just as soon as they began\r\nto interfere with the roads\' right to manage their own affairs in their\r\nown way, they must be put down with an iron hand; the phrase "iron hand"\r\ndid Fulkerson almost as much good as if it had never been used before.\r\nNews began to come of fighting between the police and the strikers when\r\nthe roads tried to move their cars with men imported from Philadelphia,\r\nand then Fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courage of the police. At the\r\nsame time, he believed what the strikers said, and that the trouble was\r\nnot made by them, but by gangs of roughs acting without their approval.\r\nIn this juncture he was relieved by the arrival of the State Board of\r\nArbitration, which took up its quarters, with a great many scare-heads,\r\nat one of the principal hotels, and invited the roads and the strikers to\r\nlay the matter in dispute before them; he said that now we should see the\r\nworking of the greatest piece of social machinery in modern times. But it\r\nappeared to work only in the alacrity of the strikers to submit their\r\ngrievance. The roads were as one road in declaring that there was nothing\r\nto arbitrate, and that they were merely asserting their right to manage\r\ntheir own affairs in their own way. One of the presidents was reported to\r\nhave told a member of the Board, who personally summoned him, to get out\r\nand to go about his business. Then, to Fulkerson\'s extreme\r\ndisappointment, the august tribunal, acting on behalf of the sovereign\r\npeople in the interest of peace, declared itself powerless, and got out,\r\nand would, no doubt, have gone about its business if it had had any.\r\nFulkerson did not know what to say, perhaps because the extras did not;\r\nbut March laughed at this result.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good deal like the military manoeuvre of the King of France and\r\nhis forty thousand men. I suppose somebody told him at the top of the\r\nhill that there was nothing to arbitrate, and to get out and go about his\r\nbusiness, and that was the reason he marched down after he had marched up\r\nwith all that ceremony. What amuses me is to find that in an affair of\r\nthis kind the roads have rights and the strikers have rights, but the\r\npublic has no rights at all. The roads and the strikers are allowed to\r\nfight out a private war in our midst as thoroughly and precisely a\r\nprivate war as any we despise the Middle Ages for having tolerated--as\r\nany street war in Florence or Verona--and to fight it out at our pains\r\nand expense, and we stand by like sheep and wait till they get tired.\r\nIt\'s a funny attitude for a city of fifteen hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants."\r\n\r\n"What would you do?" asked Fulkerson, a good deal daunted by this view of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n"Do? Nothing. Hasn\'t the State Board of Arbitration declared itself\r\npowerless? We have no hold upon the strikers; and we\'re so used to being\r\nsnubbed and disobliged by common carriers that we have forgotten our hold\r\non the roads and always allow them to manage their own affairs in their\r\nown way, quite as if we had nothing to do with them and they owed us no\r\nservices in return for their privileges."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good deal so," said Fulkerson, disordering his hair. "Well,\r\nit\'s nuts for the colonel nowadays. He says if he was boss of this town\r\nhe would seize the roads on behalf of the people, and man \'em with\r\npolicemen, and run \'em till the managers had come to terms with the\r\nstrikers; and he\'d do that every time there was a strike."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t that rather savor of the paternalism he condemned in Lindau?"\r\nasked March.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. It savors of horse sense."\r\n\r\n"You are pretty far gone, Fulkerson. I thought you were the most engaged\r\nman I ever saw; but I guess you\'re more father-in-lawed. And before\r\nyou\'re married, too."\r\n\r\n"Well, the colonel\'s a glorious old fellow, March. I wish he had the\r\npower to do that thing, just for the fun of looking on while he waltzed\r\nin. He\'s on the keen jump from morning till night, and he\'s up late and\r\nearly to see the row. I\'m afraid he\'ll get shot at some of the fights; he\r\nsees them all; I can\'t get any show at them: haven\'t seen a brickbat\r\nshied or a club swung yet. Have you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I find I can philosophize the situation about as well from the\r\npapers, and that\'s what I really want to do, I suppose. Besides, I\'m\r\nsolemnly pledged by Mrs. March not to go near any sort of crowd, under\r\npenalty of having her bring the children and go with me. Her theory is\r\nthat we must all die together; the children haven\'t been at school since\r\nthe strike began. There\'s no precaution that Mrs. March hasn\'t used. She\r\nwatches me whenever I go out, and sees that I start straight for this\r\noffice."\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed and said: "Well, it\'s probably the only thing that\'s\r\nsaved your life. Have you seen anything of Beaton lately?"\r\n\r\n"No. You don\'t mean to say he\'s killed!"\r\n\r\n"Not if he knows it. But I don\'t know--What do you say, March? What\'s the\r\nreason you couldn\'t get us up a paper on the strike?"\r\n\r\n"I knew it would fetch round to \'Every Other Week,\' somehow."\r\n\r\n"No, but seriously. There\'ll be plenty of newspaper accounts. But you\r\ncould treat it in the historical spirit--like something that happened\r\nseveral centuries ago; De Foe\'s Plague of London style. Heigh? What made\r\nme think of it was Beaton. If I could get hold of him, you two could go\r\nround together and take down its aesthetic aspects. It\'s a big thing,\r\nMarch, this strike is. I tell you it\'s imposing to have a private war, as\r\nyou say, fought out this way, in the heart of New York, and New York not\r\nminding it a bit. See? Might take that view of it. With your\r\ndescriptions and Beaton\'s sketches--well, it would just be the greatest\r\ncard! Come! What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"Will you undertake to make it right with Mrs. March if I\'m killed and\r\nshe and the children are not killed with me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it would be difficult. I wonder how it would do to get Kendricks\r\nto do the literary part?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt he\'d jump at the chance. I\'ve yet to see the form of\r\nliterature that Kendricks wouldn\'t lay down his life for."\r\n\r\n"Say!" March perceived that Fulkerson was about to vent another\r\ninspiration, and smiled patiently. "Look here! What\'s the reason we\r\ncouldn\'t get one of the strikers to write it up for us?"\r\n\r\n"Might have a symposium of strikers and presidents," March suggested.\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m in earnest. They say some of those fellows--especially the\r\nforeigners--are educated men. I know one fellow--a Bohemian--that used to\r\nedit a Bohemian newspaper here. He could write it out in his kind of\r\nDutch, and we could get Lindau to translate it."\r\n\r\n"I guess not," said March, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Why not? He\'d do it for the cause, wouldn\'t he? Suppose you put it up on\r\nhim the next time you see him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see Lindau any more," said March. He added, "I guess he\'s\r\nrenounced me along with Mr. Dryfoos\'s money."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! You don\'t mean he hasn\'t been round since?"\r\n\r\n"He came for a while, but he\'s left off coming now. I don\'t feel\r\nparticularly gay about it," March said, with some resentment of\r\nFulkerson\'s grin. "He\'s left me in debt to him for lessons to the\r\nchildren."\r\n\r\nFulkerson laughed out. "Well, he is the greatest old fool! Who\'d \'a\'\r\nthought he\'d \'a\' been in earnest with those \'brincibles\' of his? But I\r\nsuppose there have to be just such cranks; it takes all kinds to make a\r\nworld."\r\n\r\n"There has to be one such crank, it seems," March partially assented.\r\n"One\'s enough for me."\r\n\r\n"I reckon this thing is nuts for Lindau, too," said Fulkerson. "Why, it\r\nmust act like a schooner of beer on him all the while, to see \'gabidal\'\r\nembarrassed like it is by this strike. It must make old Lindau feel like\r\nhe was back behind those barricades at Berlin. Well, he\'s a splendid old\r\nfellow; pity he drinks, as I remarked once before."\r\n\r\nWhen March left the office he did not go home so directly as he came,\r\nperhaps because Mrs. March\'s eye was not on him. He was very curious\r\nabout some aspects of the strike, whose importance, as a great social\r\nconvulsion, he felt people did not recognize; and, with his temperance in\r\neverything, he found its negative expressions as significant as its more\r\nviolent phases. He had promised his wife solemnly that he would keep away\r\nfrom these, and he had a natural inclination to keep his promise; he had\r\nno wish to be that peaceful spectator who always gets shot when there is\r\nany firing on a mob. He interested himself in the apparent indifference\r\nof the mighty city, which kept on about its business as tranquilly as if\r\nthe private war being fought out in its midst were a vague rumor of\r\nIndian troubles on the frontier; and he realized how there might once\r\nhave been a street feud of forty years in Florence without interfering\r\nmaterially with the industry and prosperity of the city. On Broadway\r\nthere was a silence where a jangle and clatter of horse-car bells and\r\nhoofs had been, but it was not very noticeable; and on the avenues,\r\nroofed by the elevated roads, this silence of the surface tracks was not\r\nnoticeable at all in the roar of the trains overhead. Some of the\r\ncross-town cars were beginning to run again, with a policeman on the rear\r\nof each; on the Third Avenge line, operated by non-union men, who had not\r\nstruck, there were two policemen beside the driver of every car, and two\r\nbeside the conductor, to protect them from the strikers. But there were\r\nno strikers in sight, and on Second Avenue they stood quietly about in\r\ngroups on the corners. While March watched them at a safe distance, a car\r\nladen with policemen came down the track, but none of the strikers\r\noffered to molest it. In their simple Sunday best, March thought them\r\nvery quiet, decent-looking people, and he could well believe that they\r\nhad nothing to do with the riotous outbreaks in other parts of the city.\r\nHe could hardly believe that there were any such outbreaks; he began more\r\nand more to think them mere newspaper exaggerations in the absence of any\r\ndisturbance, or the disposition to it, that he could see. He walked on to\r\nthe East River.\r\n\r\nAvenues A, B, and C presented the same quiet aspect as Second Avenue;\r\ngroups of men stood on the corners, and now and then a police-laden car\r\nwas brought unmolested down the tracks before them; they looked at it and\r\ntalked together, and some laughed, but there was no trouble.\r\n\r\nMarch got a cross-town car, and came back to the West Side. A policeman,\r\nlooking very sleepy and tired, lounged on the platform.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll be glad when this cruel war is over," March suggested,\r\nas he got in.\r\n\r\nThe officer gave him a surly glance and made him no answer.\r\n\r\nHis behavior, from a man born to the joking give and take of our life,\r\nimpressed March. It gave him a fine sense of the ferocity which he had\r\nread of the French troops putting on toward the populace just before the\r\ncoup d\'etat; he began to feel like the populace; but he struggled with\r\nhimself and regained his character of philosophical observer. In this\r\ncharacter he remained in the car and let it carry him by the corner where\r\nhe ought to have got out and gone home, and let it keep on with him to\r\none of the farthermost tracks westward, where so much of the fighting was\r\nreported to have taken place. But everything on the way was as quiet as\r\non the East Side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the car stopped with so quick a turn of the brake that he was\r\nhalf thrown from his seat, and the policeman jumped down from the\r\nplatform and ran forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDryfoos sat at breakfast that morning with Mrs. Mandel as usual to pour\r\nout his coffee. Conrad had gone down-town; the two girls lay abed much\r\nlater than their father breakfasted, and their mother had gradually grown\r\ntoo feeble to come down till lunch. Suddenly Christine appeared at the\r\ndoor. Her face was white to the edges of her lips, and her eyes were\r\nblazing.\r\n\r\n"Look here, father! Have you been saying anything to Mr. Beaton?"\r\n\r\nThe old man looked up at her across his coffee-cup through his frowning\r\nbrows. "No."\r\n\r\nMrs. Mandel dropped her eyes, and the spoon shook in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Then what\'s the reason he don\'t come here any more?" demanded the girl;\r\nand her glance darted from her father to Mrs. Mandel. "Oh, it\'s you, is\r\nit? I\'d like to know who told you to meddle in other people\'s business?"\r\n\r\n"I did," said Dryfoos, savagely. "I told her to ask him what he wanted\r\nhere, and he said he didn\'t want anything, and he stopped coming. That\'s\r\nall. I did it myself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you did, did you?" said the girl, scarcely less insolently than she\r\nhad spoken to Mrs. Mandel. "I should like to know what you did it for?\r\nI\'d like to know what made you think I wasn\'t able to take care of\r\nmyself. I just knew somebody had been meddling, but I didn\'t suppose it\r\nwas you. I can manage my own affairs in my own way, if you please, and\r\nI\'ll thank you after this to leave me to myself in what don\'t concern\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t concern me? You impudent jade!" her father began.\r\n\r\nChristine advanced from the doorway toward the table; she had her hands\r\nclosed upon what seemed trinkets, some of which glittered and dangled\r\nfrom them. She said, "Will you go to him and tell him that this\r\nmeddlesome minx, here, had no business to say anything about me to him,\r\nand you take it all back?"\r\n\r\n"No!" shouted the old man. "And if--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I want of you!" the girl shouted in her turn. "Here are your\r\npresents." With both hands she flung the jewels-pins and rings and\r\nearrings and bracelets--among the breakfast-dishes, from which some of\r\nthem sprang to the floor. She stood a moment to pull the intaglio ring\r\nfrom the finger where Beaton put it a year ago, and dashed that at her\r\nfather\'s plate. Then she whirled out of the room, and they heard her\r\nrunning up-stairs.\r\n\r\nThe old man made a start toward her, but he fell back in his chair before\r\nshe was gone, and, with a fierce, grinding movement of his jaws,\r\ncontrolled himself. "Take--take those things up," he gasped to Mrs.\r\nMandel. He seemed unable to rise again from his chair; but when she asked\r\nhim if he were unwell, he said no, with an air of offence, and got\r\nquickly to his feet. He mechanically picked up the intaglio ring from the\r\ntable while he stood there, and put it on his little finger; his hand was\r\nnot much bigger than Christine\'s. "How do you suppose she found it out?"\r\nhe asked, after a moment.\r\n\r\n"She seems to have merely suspected it," said Mrs. Mandel, in a tremor,\r\nand with the fright in her eyes which Christine\'s violence had brought\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"Well, it don\'t make any difference. She had to know, somehow, and now\r\nshe knows." He started toward the door of the library, as if to go into\r\nthe hall, where his hat and coat hung.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dryfoos," palpitated Mrs. Mandel, "I can\'t remain here, after the\r\nlanguage your daughter has used to me--I can\'t let you leave me--I--I\'m\r\nafraid of her--"\r\n\r\n"Lock yourself up, then," said the old man, rudely. He added, from the\r\nhall before he went out, "I reckon she\'ll quiet down now."\r\n\r\nHe took the Elevated road. The strike seemed a vary far-off thing, though\r\nthe paper he bought to look up the stockmarket was full of noisy\r\ntypography about yesterday\'s troubles on the surface lines. Among the\r\nmillions in Wall Street there was some joking and some swearing, but not\r\nmuch thinking, about the six thousand men who had taken such chances in\r\ntheir attempt to better their condition. Dryfoos heard nothing of the\r\nstrike in the lobby of the Stock Exchange, where he spent two or three\r\nhours watching a favorite stock of his go up and go down under the\r\nbetting. By the time the Exchange closed it had risen eight points, and\r\non this and some other investments he was five thousand dollars richer\r\nthan he had been in the morning. But he had expected to be richer still,\r\nand he was by no means satisfied with his luck. All through the\r\nexcitement of his winning and losing had played the dull, murderous rage\r\nhe felt toward the child who had defied him, and when the game was over\r\nand he started home his rage mounted into a sort of frenzy; he would\r\nteach her, he would break her. He walked a long way without thinking, and\r\nthen waited for a car. None came, and he hailed a passing coupe.\r\n\r\n"What has got all the cars?" he demanded of the driver, who jumped down\r\nfrom his box to open the door for him and get his direction.\r\n\r\n"Been away?" asked the driver. "Hasn\'t been any car along for a week.\r\nStrike."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Dryfoos. He felt suddenly giddy, and he remained staring\r\nat the driver after he had taken his seat.\r\n\r\nThe man asked, "Where to?"\r\n\r\nDryfoos could not think of his street or number, and he said, with\r\nuncontrollable fury: "I told you once! Go up to West Eleventh, and drive\r\nalong slow on the south side; I\'ll show you the place."\r\n\r\nHe could not remember the number of \'Every Other Week\' office, where he\r\nsuddenly decided to stop before he went home. He wished to see Fulkerson,\r\nand ask him something about Beaton: whether he had been about lately, and\r\nwhether he had dropped any hint of what had happened concerning\r\nChristine; Dryfoos believed that Fulkerson was in the fellow\'s\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThere was nobody but Conrad in the counting-room, whither Dryfoos\r\nreturned after glancing into Fulkerson\'s empty office. "Where\'s\r\nFulkerson?" he asked, sitting down with his hat on.\r\n\r\n"He went out a few moments ago," said Conrad, glancing at the clock. "I\'m\r\nafraid he isn\'t coming back again today, if you wanted to see him."\r\n\r\nDryfoos twisted his head sidewise and upward to indicate March\'s room.\r\n"That other fellow out, too?"\r\n\r\n"He went just before Mr. Fulkerson," answered Conrad.\r\n\r\n"Do you generally knock off here in the middle of the afternoon?" asked\r\nthe old man.\r\n\r\n"No," said Conrad, as patiently as if his father had not been there a\r\nscore of times and found the whole staff of "Every Other Week" at work\r\nbetween four and five. "Mr. March, you know, always takes a good deal of\r\nhis work home with him, and I suppose Mr. Fulkerson went out so early\r\nbecause there isn\'t much doing to-day. Perhaps it\'s the strike that makes\r\nit dull."\r\n\r\n"The strike--yes! It\'s a pretty piece of business to have everything\r\nthrown out because a parcel of lazy hounds want a chance to lay off and\r\nget drunk." Dryfoos seemed to think Conrad would make some answer to\r\nthis, but the young man\'s mild face merely saddened, and he said nothing.\r\n"I\'ve got a coupe out there now that I had to take because I couldn\'t get\r\na car. If I had my way I\'d have a lot of those vagabonds hung. They\'re\r\nwaiting to get the city into a snarl, and then rob the houses--pack of\r\ndirty, worthless whelps. They ought to call out the militia, and fire\r\ninto \'em. Clubbing is too good for them." Conrad was still silent, and\r\nhis father sneered, "But I reckon you don\'t think so."\r\n\r\n"I think the strike is useless," said Conrad.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you do, do you? Comin\' to your senses a little. Gettin\' tired\r\nwalkin\' so much. I should like to know what your gentlemen over there on\r\nthe East Side think about the strike, anyway."\r\n\r\nThe young fellow dropped his eyes. "I am not authorized to speak for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed! And perhaps you\'re not authorized to speak for yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Father, you know we don\'t agree about these things. I\'d rather not\r\ntalk--"\r\n\r\n"But I\'m goin\' to make you talk this time!" cried Dryfoos, striking the\r\narm of the chair he sat in with the side of his fist. A maddening thought\r\nof Christine came over him. "As long as you eat my bread, you have got to\r\ndo as I say. I won\'t have my children telling me what I shall do and\r\nsha\'n\'t do, or take on airs of being holier than me. Now, you just speak\r\nup! Do you think those loafers are right, or don\'t you? Come!"\r\n\r\nConrad apparently judged it best to speak. "I think they were very\r\nfoolish to strike--at this time, when the Elevated roads can do the\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Oh, at this time, heigh! And I suppose they think over there on the East\r\nSide that it \'d been wise to strike before we got the Elevated." Conrad\r\nagain refused to answer, and his father roared, "What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I think a strike is always bad business. It\'s war; but sometimes there\r\ndon\'t seem any other way for the workingmen to get justice. They say that\r\nsometimes strikes do raise the wages, after a while."\r\n\r\n"Those lazy devils were paid enough already," shrieked the old man.\r\n\r\n"They got two dollars a day. How much do you think they ought to \'a\' got?\r\nTwenty?"\r\n\r\nConrad hesitated, with a beseeching look at his father. But he decided to\r\nanswer. "The men say that with partial work, and fines, and other things,\r\nthey get sometimes a dollar, and sometimes ninety cents a day."\r\n\r\n"They lie, and you know they lie," said his father, rising and coming\r\ntoward him. "And what do you think the upshot of it all will be, after\r\nthey\'ve ruined business for another week, and made people hire hacks, and\r\nstolen the money of honest men? How is it going to end?"\r\n\r\n"They will have to give in."\r\n\r\n"Oh, give in, heigh! And what will you say then, I should like to know?\r\nHow will you feel about it then? Speak!"\r\n\r\n"I shall feel as I do now. I know you don\'t think that way, and I don\'t\r\nblame you--or anybody. But if I have got to say how I shall feel, why, I\r\nshall feel sorry they didn\'t succeed, for I believe they have a righteous\r\ncause, though they go the wrong way to help themselves."\r\n\r\nHis father came close to him, his eyes blazing, his teeth set. "Do you\r\ndare so say that to me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. I can\'t help it. I pity them; my whole heart is with those poor\r\nmen."\r\n\r\n"You impudent puppy!" shouted the old man. He lifted his hand and struck\r\nhis son in the face. Conrad caught his hand with his own left, and, while\r\nthe blood began to trickle from a wound that Christine\'s intaglio ring\r\nhad made in his temple, he looked at him with a kind of grieving wonder,\r\nand said, "Father!"\r\n\r\nThe old man wrenched his fist away and ran out of the house. He\r\nremembered his address now, and he gave it as he plunged into the coupe.\r\nHe trembled with his evil passion, and glared out of the windows at the\r\npassers as he drove home; he only saw Conrad\'s mild, grieving, wondering\r\neyes, and the blood slowly trickling from the wound in his temple.\r\n\r\nConrad went to the neat-set bowl in Fulkerson\'s comfortable room and\r\nwashed the blood away, and kept bathing the wound with the cold water\r\ntill it stopped bleeding. The cut was not deep, and he thought he would\r\nnot put anything on it. After a while he locked up the office and started\r\nout, he hardly knew where. But he walked on, in the direction he had\r\ntaken, till he found himself in Union Square, on the pavement in front of\r\nBrentano\'s. It seemed to him that he heard some one calling gently to\r\nhim, "Mr. Dryfoos!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nConrad looked confusedly around, and the same voice said again, "Mr.\r\nDryfoos!" and he saw that it was a lady speaking to him from a coupe\r\nbeside the curbing, and then he saw that it was Miss Vance.\r\n\r\nShe smiled when he gave signs of having discovered her, and came up to\r\nthe door of her carriage. "I am so glad to meet you. I have been longing\r\nto talk to somebody; nobody seems to feel about it as I do. Oh, isn\'t it\r\nhorrible? Must they fail? I saw cars running on all the lines as I came\r\nacross; it made me sick at heart. Must those brave fellows give in? And\r\neverybody seems to hate them so--I can\'t bear it." Her face was estranged\r\nwith excitement, and there were traces of tears on it. "You must think me\r\nalmost crazy to stop you in the street this way; but when I caught sight\r\nof you I had to speak. I knew you would sympathize--I knew you would feel\r\nas I do. Oh, how can anybody help honoring those poor men for standing by\r\none another as they do? They are risking all they have in the world for\r\nthe sake of justice! Oh, they are true heroes! They are staking the bread\r\nof their wives and children on the dreadful chance they\'ve taken! But no\r\none seems to understand it. No one seems to see that they are willing to\r\nsuffer more now that other poor men may suffer less hereafter. And those\r\nwretched creatures that are coming in to take their places--those\r\ntraitors--"\r\n\r\n"We can\'t blame them for wanting to earn a living, Miss Vance," said\r\nConrad.\r\n\r\n"No, no! I don\'t blame them. Who am I, to do such a thing? It\'s\r\nwe--people like me, of my class--who make the poor betray one another.\r\nBut this dreadful fighting--this hideous paper is full of it!" She held\r\nup an extra, crumpled with her nervous reading. "Can\'t something be done\r\nto stop it? Don\'t you think that if some one went among them, and tried\r\nto make them see how perfectly hopeless it was to resist the companies\r\nand drive off the new men, he might do some good? I have wanted to go and\r\ntry; but I am a woman, and I mustn\'t! I shouldn\'t be afraid of the\r\nstrikers, but I\'m afraid of what people would say!" Conrad kept pressing\r\nhis handkerchief to the cut in his temple, which he thought might be\r\nbleeding, and now she noticed this. "Are you hurt, Mr. Dryfoos? You look\r\nso pale."\r\n\r\n"No, it\'s nothing--a little scratch I\'ve got."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, you look pale. Have you a carriage? How will you get home? Will\r\nyou get in here with me and let me drive you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Conrad, smiling at her excitement. "I\'m perfectly well--"\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t think I\'m foolish and wicked for stopping you here and\r\ntalking in this way? But I know you feel as I do!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I feel as you do. You are right--right in every way--I mustn\'t keep\r\nyou--Good-bye." He stepped back to bow, but she put her beautiful hand\r\nout of the window, and when he took it she wrung his hand hard.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, thank you! You are good and you are just! But no one can do\r\nanything. It\'s useless!"\r\n\r\nThe type of irreproachable coachman on the box whose respectability had\r\nsuffered through the strange behavior of his mistress in this interview\r\ndrove quickly off at her signal, and Conrad stood a moment looking after\r\nthe carriage. His heart was full of joy; it leaped; he thought it would\r\nburst. As he turned to walk away it seemed to him as if he mounted upon\r\nthe air. The trust she had shown him, the praise she had given him, that\r\ncrush of the hand: he hoped nothing, he formed no idea from it, but it\r\nall filled him with love that cast out the pain and shame he had been\r\nsuffering. He believed that he could never be unhappy any more; the\r\nhardness that was in his mind toward his father went out of it; he saw\r\nhow sorely he had tried him; he grieved that he had done it, but the\r\nmeans, the difference of his feeling about the cause of their quarrel, he\r\nwas solemnly glad of that since she shared it. He was only sorry for his\r\nfather. "Poor father!" he said under his breath as he went along. He\r\nexplained to her about his father in his reverie, and she pitied his\r\nfather, too.\r\n\r\nHe was walking over toward the West Side, aimlessly at first, and then at\r\ntimes with the longing to do something to save those mistaken men from\r\nthemselves forming itself into a purpose. Was not that what she meant\r\nwhen she bewailed her woman\'s helplessness? She must have wished him to\r\ntry if he, being a man, could not do something; or if she did not, still\r\nhe would try, and if she heard of it she would recall what she had said\r\nand would be glad he had understood her so. Thinking of her pleasure in\r\nwhat he was going to do, he forgot almost what it was; but when he came\r\nto a street-car track he remembered it, and looked up and down to see if\r\nthere were any turbulent gathering of men whom he might mingle with and\r\nhelp to keep from violence. He saw none anywhere; and then suddenly, as\r\nif at the same moment, for in his exalted mood all events had a\r\ndream-like simultaneity, he stood at the corner of an avenue, and in the\r\nmiddle of it, a little way off, was a street-car, and around the car a\r\ntumult of shouting, cursing, struggling men. The driver was lashing his\r\nhorses forward, and a policeman was at their heads, with the conductor,\r\npulling them; stones, clubs, brickbats hailed upon the car, the horses,\r\nthe men trying to move them. The mob closed upon them in a body, and then\r\na patrol-wagon whirled up from the other side, and a squad of policemen\r\nleaped out and began to club the rioters. Conrad could see how they\r\nstruck them under the rims of their hats; the blows on their skulls\r\nsounded as if they had fallen on stone; the rioters ran in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nOne of the officers rushed up toward the corner where Conrad stood, and\r\nthen he saw at his side a tall, old man, with a long, white beard, who\r\nwas calling out at the policemen: "Ah, yes! Glup the strikerss--gif it to\r\nthem! Why don\'t you co and glup the bresidents that insoalt your lawss,\r\nand gick your Boart of Arpidration out-of-toors? Glup the strikerss--they\r\ncot no friendts! They cot no money to pribe you, to dreat you!"\r\n\r\nThe officer lifted his club, and the old man threw his left arm up to\r\nshield his head. Conrad recognized Lindau, and now he saw the empty\r\nsleeve dangle in the air over the stump of his wrist. He heard a shot in\r\nthat turmoil beside the car, and something seemed to strike him in the\r\nbreast. He was going to say to the policeman: "Don\'t strike him! He\'s an\r\nold soldier! You see he has no hand!" but he could not speak, he could\r\nnot move his tongue. The policeman stood there; he saw his face: it was\r\nnot bad, not cruel; it was like the face of a statue, fixed,\r\nperdurable--a mere image of irresponsible and involuntary authority. Then\r\nConrad fell forward, pierced through the heart by that shot fired from\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\nMarch heard the shot as he scrambled out of his car, and at the same\r\nmoment he saw Lindau drop under the club of the policeman, who left him\r\nwhere he fell and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing the rioters.\r\nThe fighting round the car in the avenue ceased; the driver whipped his\r\nhorses into a gallop, and the place was left empty.\r\n\r\nMarch would have liked to run; he thought how his wife had implored him\r\nto keep away from the rioting; but he could not have left Lindau lying\r\nthere if he would. Something stronger than his will drew him to the spot,\r\nand there he saw Conrad, dead beside the old man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nIn the cares which Mrs. March shared with her husband that night she was\r\nsupported partly by principle, but mainly by the potent excitement which\r\nbewildered Conrad\'s family and took all reality from what had happened.\r\nIt was nearly midnight when the Marches left them and walked away toward\r\nthe Elevated station with Fulkerson. Everything had been done, by that\r\ntime, that could be done; and Fulkerson was not without that satisfaction\r\nin the business-like despatch of all the details which attends each step\r\nin such an affair and helps to make death tolerable even to the most\r\nsorely stricken. We are creatures of the moment; we live from one little\r\nspace to another; and only one interest at a time fills these. Fulkerson\r\nwas cheerful when they got into the street, almost gay; and Mrs. March\r\nexperienced a rebound from her depression which she felt that she ought\r\nnot to have experienced. But she condoned the offence a little in\r\nherself, because her husband remained so constant in his gravity; and,\r\npending the final accounting he must make her for having been where he\r\ncould be of so much use from the first instant of the calamity, she was\r\ntenderly, gratefully proud of all the use he had been to Conrad\'s family,\r\nand especially his miserable old father. To her mind, March was the\r\nprincipal actor in the whole affair, and much more important in having\r\nseen it than those who had suffered in it. In fact, he had suffered\r\nincomparably.\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Fulkerson. "They\'ll get along now. We\'ve done all we\r\ncould, and there\'s nothing left but for them to bear it. Of course it\'s\r\nawful, but I guess it \'ll come out all right. I mean," he added, "they\'ll\r\npull through now."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said March, "that nothing is put on us that we can\'t bear.\r\nBut I should think," he went on, musingly, "that when God sees what we\r\npoor finite creatures can bear, hemmed round with this eternal darkness\r\nof death, He must respect us."\r\n\r\n"Basil!" said his wife. But in her heart she drew nearer to him for the\r\nwords she thought she ought to rebuke him for.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know," he said, "we school ourselves to despise human nature. But\r\nGod did not make us despicable, and I say, whatever end He meant us for,\r\nHe must have some such thrill of joy in our adequacy to fate as a father\r\nfeels when his son shows himself a man. When I think what we can be if we\r\nmust, I can\'t believe the least of us shall finally perish."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I reckon the Almighty won\'t scoop any of us," said Fulkerson, with a\r\npiety of his own.\r\n\r\n"That poor boy\'s father!" sighed Mrs. March. "I can\'t get his face out of\r\nmy sight. He looked so much worse than death."\r\n\r\n"Oh, death doesn\'t look bad," said March. "It\'s life that looks so in its\r\npresence. Death is peace and pardon. I only wish poor old Lindau was as\r\nwell out of it as Conrad there."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Lindau! He has done harm enough," said Mrs. March. "I hope he will\r\nbe careful after this."\r\n\r\nMarch did not try to defend Lindau against her theory of the case, which\r\ninexorably held him responsible for Conrad\'s death.\r\n\r\n"Lindau\'s going to come out all right, I guess," said Fulkerson. "He was\r\nfirst-rate when I saw him at the hospital to-night." He whispered in\r\nMarch\'s ear, at a chance he got in mounting the station stairs: "I didn\'t\r\nlike to tell you there at the house, but I guess you\'d better know. They\r\nhad to take Lindau\'s arm off near the shoulder. Smashed all to pieces by\r\nthe clubbing."\r\n\r\nIn the house, vainly rich and foolishly unfit for them, the bereaved\r\nfamily whom the Marches had just left lingered together, and tried to get\r\nstrength to part for the night. They were all spent with the fatigue that\r\ncomes from heaven to such misery as theirs, and they sat in a torpor in\r\nwhich each waited for the other to move, to speak.\r\n\r\nChristine moved, and Mela spoke. Christine rose and went out of the room\r\nwithout saying a word, and they heard her going up-stairs. Then Mela\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I reckon the rest of us better be goun\' too, father. Here, let\'s git\r\nmother started."\r\n\r\nShe put her arm round her mother, to lift her from her chair, but the old\r\nman did not stir, and Mela called Mrs. Mandel from the next room. Between\r\nthem they raised her to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t there anybody agoin\' to set up with it?" she asked, in her hoarse\r\npipe. "It appears like folks hain\'t got any feelin\'s in New York. Woon\'t\r\nsome o\' the neighbors come and offer to set up, without waitin\' to be\r\nasked?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right, mother. The men \'ll attend to that. Don\'t you\r\nbother any," Mela coaxed, and she kept her arm round her mother, with\r\ntender patience.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mely, child! I can\'t feel right to have it left to hirelin\'s so.\r\nBut there ain\'t anybody any more to see things done as they ought. If\r\nCoonrod was on\'y here--"\r\n\r\n"Well, mother, you are pretty mixed!" said Mela, with a strong tendency\r\nto break into her large guffaw. But she checked herself and said: "I know\r\njust how you feel, though. It keeps acomun\' and agoun\'; and it\'s so and\r\nit ain\'t so, all at once; that\'s the plague of it. Well, father! Ain\'t\r\nyou goun\' to come?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' to stay, Mela," said the old man, gently, without moving. "Get\r\nyour mother to bed, that\'s a good girl."\r\n\r\n"You goin\' to set up with him, Jacob?" asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n"Yes, \'Liz\'beth, I\'ll set up. You go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will, Jacob. And I believe it \'ll do you good to set up. I\r\nwished I could set up with you; but I don\'t seem to have the stren\'th I\r\ndid when the twins died. I must git my sleep, so\'s to--I don\'t like very\r\nwell to have you broke of your rest, Jacob, but there don\'t appear to be\r\nanybody else. You wouldn\'t have to do it if Coonrod was here. There I go\r\nag\'in! Mercy! mercy!"\r\n\r\n"Well, do come along, then, mother," said Mela; and she got her out of\r\nthe room, with Mrs. Mandel\'s help, and up the stairs.\r\n\r\nFrom the top the old woman called down, "You tell Coonrod--" She stopped,\r\nand he heard her groan out, "My Lord! my Lord!"\r\n\r\nHe sat, one silence in the dining-room, where they had all lingered\r\ntogether, and in the library beyond the hireling watcher sat, another\r\nsilence. The time passed, but neither moved, and the last noise in the\r\nhouse ceased, so that they heard each other breathe, and the vague,\r\nremote rumor of the city invaded the inner stillness. It grew louder\r\ntoward morning, and then Dryfoos knew from the watcher\'s deeper breathing\r\nthat he had fallen into a doze.\r\n\r\nHe crept by him to the drawing-room, where his son was; the place was\r\nfull of the awful sweetness of the flowers that Fulkerson had brought,\r\nand that lay above the pulseless breast. The old man turned up a burner\r\nin the chandelier, and stood looking on the majestic serenity of the dead\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe could not move when he saw his wife coming down the stairway in the\r\nhall. She was in her long, white flannel bed gown, and the candle she\r\ncarried shook with her nervous tremor. He thought she might be walking in\r\nher sleep, but she said, quite simply, "I woke up, and I couldn\'t git to\r\nsleep ag\'in without comin\' to have a look." She stood beside their dead\r\nson with him, "well, he\'s beautiful, Jacob. He was the prettiest baby!\r\nAnd he was always good, Coonrod was; I\'ll say that for him. I don\'t\r\nbelieve he ever give me a minute\'s care in his whole life. I reckon I\r\nliked him about the best of all the children; but I don\'t know as I ever\r\ndone much to show it. But you was always good to him, Jacob; you always\r\ndone the best for him, ever since he was a little feller. I used to be\r\nafraid you\'d spoil him sometimes in them days; but I guess you\'re glad\r\nnow for every time you didn\'t cross him. I don\'t suppose since the twins\r\ndied you ever hit him a lick." She stooped and peered closer at the face.\r\n"Why, Jacob, what\'s that there by his pore eye?" Dryfoos saw it, too, the\r\nwound that he had feared to look for, and that now seemed to redden on\r\nhis sight. He broke into a low, wavering cry, like a child\'s in despair,\r\nlike an animal\'s in terror, like a soul\'s in the anguish of remorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe evening after the funeral, while the Marches sat together talking it\r\nover, and making approaches, through its shadow, to the question of their\r\nown future, which it involved, they were startled by the twitter of the\r\nelectric bell at their apartment door. It was really not so late as the\r\nchildren\'s having gone to bed made it seem; but at nine o\'clock it was\r\ntoo late for any probable visitor except Fulkerson. It might be he, and\r\nMarch was glad to postpone the impending question to his curiosity\r\nconcerning the immediate business Fulkerson might have with him. He went\r\nhimself to the door, and confronted there a lady deeply veiled in black\r\nand attended by a very decorous serving-woman.\r\n\r\n"Are you alone, Mr. March--you and Mrs. March?" asked the lady, behind\r\nher veil; and, as he hesitated, she said: "You don\'t know me! Miss\r\nVance"; and she threw back her veil, showing her face wan and agitated in\r\nthe dark folds. "I am very anxious to see you--to speak with you both.\r\nMay I come in?"\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, Miss Vance," he answered, still too much stupefied by\r\nher presence to realize it.\r\n\r\nShe promptly entered, and saying, with a glance at the hall chair by the\r\ndoor, "My maid can sit here?" followed him to the room where he had left\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. March showed herself more capable of coping with the fact. She\r\nwelcomed Miss Vance with the liking they both felt for the girl, and with\r\nthe sympathy which her troubled face inspired.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t tire you with excuses for coming, Mrs. March," she said, "for it\r\nwas the only thing left for me to do; and I come at my aunt\'s\r\nsuggestion." She added this as if it would help to account for her more\r\non the conventional plane, and she had the instinctive good taste to\r\naddress herself throughout to Mrs. March as much as possible, though what\r\nshe had to say was mainly for March. "I don\'t know how to begin--I don\'t\r\nknow how to speak of this terrible affair. But you know what I mean. I\r\nfeel as if I had lived a whole lifetime since it happened. I don\'t want\r\nyou to pity me for it," she said, forestalling a politeness from Mrs.\r\nMarch. "I\'m the last one to be thought of, and you mustn\'t mind me if I\r\ntry to make you. I came to find out all of the truth that I can, and when\r\nI know just what that is I shall know what to do. I have read the\r\ninquest; it\'s all burned into my brain. But I don\'t care for that--for\r\nmyself: you must let me say such things without minding me. I know that\r\nyour husband--that Mr. March was there; I read his testimony; and I\r\nwished to ask him--to ask him--" She stopped and looked distractedly\r\nabout. "But what folly! He must have said everything he knew--he had to."\r\nHer eyes wandered to him from his wife, on whom she had kept them with\r\ninstinctive tact.\r\n\r\n"I said everything--yes," he replied. "But if you would like to know--"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I had better tell you something first. I had just parted with\r\nhim--it couldn\'t have been more than half an hour--in front of\r\nBrentano\'s; he must have gone straight to his death. We were talking, and\r\nI--I said, Why didn\'t some one go among the strikers and plead with them\r\nto be peaceable, and keep them from attacking the new men. I knew that he\r\nfelt as I did about the strikers: that he was their friend. Did you\r\nsee--do you know anything that makes you think he had been trying to do\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," March began, "I didn\'t see him at all till--till I saw him\r\nlying dead."\r\n\r\n"My husband was there purely by accident," Mrs. March put in. "I had\r\nbegged and entreated him not to go near the striking anywhere. And he had\r\njust got out of the car, and saw the policeman strike that wretched\r\nLindau--he\'s been such an anxiety to me ever since we have had anything\r\nto do with him here; my husband knew him when he was a boy in the West.\r\nMr. March came home from it all perfectly prostrated; it made us all\r\nsick! Nothing so horrible ever came into our lives before. I assure you\r\nit was the most shocking experience."\r\n\r\nMiss Vance listened to her with that look of patience which those who\r\nhave seen much of the real suffering of the world--the daily portion of\r\nthe poor--have for the nervous woes of comfortable people. March hung his\r\nhead; he knew it would be useless to protest that his share of the\r\ncalamity was, by comparison, infinitesimally small.\r\n\r\nAfter she had heard Mrs. March to the end even of her repetitions, Miss\r\nVance said, as if it were a mere matter of course that she should have\r\nlooked the affair up, "Yes, I have seen Mr. Lindau at the hospital--"\r\n\r\n"My husband goes every day to see him," Mrs. March interrupted, to give\r\na final touch to the conception of March\'s magnanimity throughout.\r\n\r\n"The poor man seems to have been in the wrong at the time," said Miss\r\nVance.\r\n\r\n"I could almost say he had earned the right to be wrong. He\'s a man of\r\nthe most generous instincts, and a high ideal of justice, of equity--too\r\nhigh to be considered by a policeman with a club in his hand," said\r\nMarch, with a bold defiance of his wife\'s different opinion of Lindau.\r\n"It\'s the policeman\'s business, I suppose, to club the ideal when he\r\nfinds it inciting a riot."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t blame Mr. Lindau; I don\'t blame the policeman; he was as\r\nmuch a mere instrument as his club was. I am only trying to find out how\r\nmuch I am to blame myself. I had no thought of Mr. Dryfoos\'s going\r\nthere--of his attempting to talk with the strikers and keep them quiet; I\r\nwas only thinking, as women do, of what I should try to do if I were a\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"But perhaps he understood me to ask him to go--perhaps my words sent him\r\nto his death."\r\n\r\nShe had a sort of calm in her courage to know the worst truth as to her\r\nresponsibility that forbade any wish to flatter her out of it. "I\'m\r\nafraid," said March, "that is what can never be known now." After a\r\nmoment he added: "But why should you wish to know? If he went there as a\r\npeacemaker, he died in a good cause, in such a way as he would wish to\r\ndie, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the girl; "I have thought of that. But death is awful; we\r\nmust not think patiently, forgivingly of sending any one to their death\r\nin the best cause."--"I fancy life was an awful thing to Conrad Dryfoos,"\r\nMarch replied. "He was thwarted and disappointed, without even pleasing\r\nthe ambition that thwarted and disappointed him. That poor old man, his\r\nfather, warped him from his simple, lifelong wish to be a minister, and\r\nwas trying to make a business man of him. If it will be any consolation\r\nto you to know it, Miss Vance, I can assure you that he was very unhappy,\r\nand I don\'t see how he could ever have been happy here."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t," said the girl, steadily. "If people are born into this world,\r\nit\'s because they were meant to live in it. It isn\'t a question of being\r\nhappy here; no one is happy, in that old, selfish way, or can be; but he\r\ncould have been of great use."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he was of use in dying. Who knows? He may have been trying to\r\nsilence Lindau."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lindau wasn\'t worth it!" cried Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nMiss Vance looked at her as if she did not quite understand. Then she\r\nturned to March. "He might have been unhappy, as we all are; but I know\r\nthat his life here would have had a higher happiness than we wish for or\r\naim for." The tears began to run silently down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"He looked strangely happy that day when he left me. He had hurt himself\r\nsomehow, and his face was bleeding from a scratch; he kept his\r\nhandkerchief up; he was pale, but such a light came into his face when he\r\nshook hands--ah, I know he went to try and do what I said!" They were all\r\nsilent, while she dried her eyes and then put her handkerchief back into\r\nthe pocket from which she had suddenly pulled it, with a series of vivid,\r\nyoung-ladyish gestures, which struck March by their incongruity with the\r\noccasion of their talk, and yet by their harmony with the rest of her\r\nelegance. "I am sorry, Miss Vance," he began, "that I can\'t really tell\r\nyou anything more--"\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," she said, controlling herself and rising quickly. "I\r\nthank you--thank you both very much." She turned to Mrs. March and shook\r\nhands with her and then with him. "I might have known--I did know that\r\nthere wasn\'t anything more for you to tell. But at least I\'ve found out\r\nfrom you that there was nothing, and now I can begin to bear what I must.\r\nHow are those poor creatures--his mother and father, his sisters? Some\r\nday, I hope, I shall be ashamed to have postponed them to the thought of\r\nmyself; but I can\'t pretend to be yet. I could not come to the funeral; I\r\nwanted to."\r\n\r\nShe addressed her question to Mrs. March, who answered: "I can\r\nunderstand. But they were pleased with the flowers you sent; people are,\r\nat such times, and they haven\'t many friends."\r\n\r\n"Would you go to see them?" asked the girl. "Would you tell them what\r\nI\'ve told you?"\r\n\r\nMrs. March looked at her husband.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what good it would do. They wouldn\'t understand. But if it\r\nwould relieve you--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wait till it isn\'t a question of self-relief," said the girl.\r\n"Good-bye!"\r\n\r\nShe left them to long debate of the event. At the end Mrs. March said,\r\n"She is a strange being; such a mixture of the society girl and the\r\nsaint."\r\n\r\nHer husband answered: "She\'s the potentiality of several kinds of\r\nfanatic. She\'s very unhappy, and I don\'t see how she\'s to be happier\r\nabout that poor fellow. I shouldn\'t be surprised if she did inspire him\r\nto attempt something of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Well, you got out of it very well, Basil. I admired the way you managed.\r\nI was afraid you\'d say something awkward."\r\n\r\n"Oh, with a plain line of truth before me, as the only possible thing, I\r\ncan get on pretty well. When it comes to anything decorative, I\'d rather\r\nleave it to you, Isabel."\r\n\r\nShe seemed insensible of his jest. "Of course, he was in love with her.\r\nThat was the light that came into his face when he was going to do what\r\nhe thought she wanted him to do."\r\n\r\n"And she--do you think that she was--"\r\n\r\n"What an idea! It would have been perfectly grotesque!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nTheir affliction brought the Dryfooses into humaner relations with the\r\nMarches, who had hitherto regarded them as a necessary evil, as the\r\nodious means of their own prosperity. Mrs. March found that the women of\r\nthe family seemed glad of her coming, and in the sense of her usefulness\r\nto them all she began to feel a kindness even for Christine. But she\r\ncould not help seeing that between the girl and her father there was an\r\nunsettled account, somehow, and that it was Christine and not the old man\r\nwho was holding out. She thought that their sorrow had tended to refine\r\nthe others. Mela was much more subdued, and, except when she abandoned\r\nherself to a childish interest in her mourning, she did nothing to shock\r\nMrs. March\'s taste or to seem unworthy of her grief. She was very good to\r\nher mother, whom the blow had left unchanged, and to her father, whom it\r\nhad apparently fallen upon with crushing weight. Once, after visiting\r\ntheir house, Mrs. March described to March a little scene between Dryfoos\r\nand Mela, when he came home from Wall Street, and the girl met him at the\r\ndoor with a kind of country simpleness, and took his hat and stick, and\r\nbrought him into the room where Mrs. March sat, looking tired and broken.\r\nShe found this look of Dryfoos\'s pathetic, and dwelt on the sort of\r\nstupefaction there was in it; he must have loved his son more than they\r\never realized. "Yes," said March, "I suspect he did. He\'s never been\r\nabout the place since that day; he was always dropping in before, on his\r\nway up-town. He seems to go down to Wall Street every day, just as\r\nbefore, but I suppose that\'s mechanical; he wouldn\'t know what else to\r\ndo; I dare say it\'s best for him. The sanguine Fulkerson is getting a\r\nlittle anxious about the future of \'Every Other Week.\' Now Conrad\'s gone,\r\nhe isn\'t sure the old man will want to keep on with it, or whether he\'ll\r\nhave to look up another Angel. He wants to get married, I imagine, and he\r\ncan\'t venture till this point is settled."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very material point to us too, Basil," said Mrs. March.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course. I hadn\'t overlooked that, you may be sure. One of the\r\nthings that Fulkerson and I have discussed is a scheme for buying the\r\nmagazine. Its success is pretty well assured now, and I shouldn\'t be\r\nafraid to put money into it--if I had the money."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t let you sell the house in Boston, Basil!"\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t want to. I wish we could go back and live in it and get the\r\nrent, too! It would be quite a support. But I suppose if Dryfoos won\'t\r\nkeep on, it must come to another Angel. I hope it won\'t be a literary\r\none, with a fancy for running my department."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess whoever takes the magazine will be glad enough to keep you!"\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? Well, perhaps. But I don\'t believe Fulkerson would let\r\nme stand long between him and an Angel of the right description."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, I believe he would. And you\'ve never seen anything, Basil,\r\nto make you really think that Mr. Fulkerson didn\'t appreciate you to the\r\nutmost."\r\n\r\n"I think I came pretty near an undervaluation in that Lindau trouble. I\r\nshall always wonder what put a backbone into Fulkerson just at that\r\ncrisis. Fulkerson doesn\'t strike me as the stuff of a moral hero."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, he was one," said Mrs. March, "and that\'s quite enough for\r\nme."\r\n\r\nMarch did not answer. "What a noble thing life is, anyway! Here I am,\r\nwell on the way to fifty, after twenty-five years of hard work, looking\r\nforward to the potential poor-house as confidently as I did in youth. We\r\nmight have saved a little more than we have saved; but the little more\r\nwouldn\'t avail if I were turned out of my place now; and we should have\r\nlived sordidly to no purpose. Some one always has you by the throat,\r\nunless you have some one else in your grip. I wonder if that\'s the\r\nattitude the Almighty intended His respectable creatures to take toward\r\none another! I wonder if He meant our civilization, the battle we fight\r\nin, the game we trick in! I wonder if He considers it final, and if the\r\nkingdom of heaven on earth, which we pray for--"\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Lindau to-day?" Mrs. March asked.\r\n\r\n"You inferred it from the quality of my piety?" March laughed, and then\r\nsuddenly sobered. "Yes, I saw him. It\'s going rather hard with him, I\'m\r\nafraid. The amputation doesn\'t heal very well; the shock was very great,\r\nand he\'s old. It\'ll take time. There\'s so much pain that they have to\r\nkeep him under opiates, and I don\'t think he fully knew me. At any rate,\r\nI didn\'t get my piety from him to-day."\r\n\r\n"It\'s horrible! Horrible!" said Mrs. March. "I can\'t get over it! After\r\nlosing his hand in the war, to lose his whole arm now in this way! It\r\ndoes seem too cruel! Of course he oughtn\'t to have been there; we can say\r\nthat. But you oughtn\'t to have been there, either, Basil."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wasn\'t exactly advising the police to go and club the railroad\r\npresidents."\r\n\r\n"Neither was poor Conrad Dryfoos."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t deny it. All that was distinctly the chance of life and death.\r\nThat belonged to God; and no doubt it was law, though it seems chance.\r\nBut what I object to is this economic chance-world in which we live, and\r\nwhich we men seem to have created. It ought to be law as inflexible in\r\nhuman affairs as the order of day and night in the physical world that if\r\na man will work he shall both rest and eat, and shall not be harassed\r\nwith any question as to how his repose and his provision shall come.\r\nNothing less ideal than this satisfies the reason. But in our state of\r\nthings no one is secure of this. No one is sure of finding work; no one\r\nis sure of not losing it. I may have my work taken away from me at any\r\nmoment by the caprice, the mood, the indigestion of a man who has not the\r\nqualification for knowing whether I do it well, or ill. At my time of\r\nlife--at every time of life--a man ought to feel that if he will keep on\r\ndoing his duty he shall not suffer in himself or in those who are dear to\r\nhim, except through natural causes. But no man can feel this as things\r\nare now; and so we go on, pushing and pulling, climbing and crawling,\r\nthrusting aside and trampling underfoot; lying, cheating, stealing; and\r\nthen we get to the end, covered with blood and dirt and sin and shame,\r\nand look back over the way we\'ve come to a palace of our own, or the\r\npoor-house, which is about the only possession we can claim in common\r\nwith our brother-men, I don\'t think the retrospect can be pleasing."\r\n\r\n"I know, I know!" said his wife. "I think of those things, too, Basil.\r\nLife isn\'t what it seems when you look forward to it. But I think people\r\nwould suffer less, and wouldn\'t have to work so hard, and could make all\r\nreasonable provision for the future, if they were not so greedy and so\r\nfoolish."\r\n\r\n"Oh, without doubt! We can\'t put it all on the conditions; we must put\r\nsome of the blame on character. But conditions make character; and people\r\nare greedy and foolish, and wish to have and to shine, because having and\r\nshining are held up to them by civilization as the chief good of life. We\r\nall know they are not the chief good, perhaps not good at all; but if\r\nsome one ventures to say so, all the rest of us call him a fraud and a\r\ncrank, and go moiling and toiling on to the palace or the poor-house. We\r\ncan\'t help it. If one were less greedy or less foolish, some one else\r\nwould have and would shine at his expense. We don\'t moil and toil to\r\nourselves alone; the palace or the poor-house is not merely for\r\nourselves, but for our children, whom we\'ve brought up in the\r\nsuperstition that having and shining is the chief good. We dare not teach\r\nthem otherwise, for fear they may falter in the fight when it comes their\r\nturn, and the children of others will crowd them out of the palace into\r\nthe poor-house. If we felt sure that honest work shared by all would\r\nbring them honest food shared by all, some heroic few of us, who did not\r\nwish our children to rise above their fellows--though we could not bear\r\nto have them fall below--might trust them with the truth. But we have no\r\nsuch assurance, and so we go on trembling before Dryfooses and living in\r\ngimcrackeries."\r\n\r\n"Basil, Basil! I was always willing to live more simply than you. You\r\nknow I was!"\r\n\r\n"I know you always said so, my dear. But how many bell-ratchets and\r\nspeaking-tubes would you be willing to have at the street door below? I\r\nremember that when we were looking for a flat you rejected every building\r\nthat had a bell-ratchet or a speaking-tube, and would have nothing to do\r\nwith any that had more than an electric button; you wanted a hall-boy,\r\nwith electric buttons all over him. I don\'t blame you. I find such things\r\nquite as necessary as you do."\r\n\r\n"And do you mean to say, Basil," she asked, abandoning this unprofitable\r\nbranch of the inquiry, "that you are really uneasy about your place? that\r\nyou are afraid Mr. Dryfoos may give up being an Angel, and Mr. Fulkerson\r\nmay play you false?"\r\n\r\n"Play me false? Oh, it wouldn\'t be playing me false. It would be merely\r\nlooking out for himself, if the new Angel had editorial tastes and wanted\r\nmy place. It\'s what any one would do."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t do it, Basil!"\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t I? Well, if any one offered me more salary than \'Every Other\r\nWeek\' pays--say, twice as much--what do you think my duty to my suffering\r\nfamily would be? It\'s give and take in the business world, Isabel;\r\nespecially take. But as to being uneasy, I\'m not, in the least. I\'ve the\r\nspirit of a lion, when it comes to such a chance as that. When I see how\r\nreadily the sensibilities of the passing stranger can be worked in New\r\nYork, I think of taking up the role of that desperate man on Third Avenue\r\nwho went along looking for garbage in the gutter to eat. I think I could\r\npick up at least twenty or thirty cents a day by that little game, and\r\nmaintain my family in the affluence it\'s been accustomed to."\r\n\r\n"Basil!" cried his wife. "You don\'t mean to say that man was an impostor!\r\nAnd I\'ve gone about, ever since, feeling that one such case in a million,\r\nthe bare possibility of it, was enough to justify all that Lindau said\r\nabout the rich and the poor!"\r\n\r\nMarch laughed teasingly. "Oh, I don\'t say he was an impostor. Perhaps he\r\nreally was hungry; but, if he wasn\'t, what do you think of a civilization\r\nthat makes the opportunity of such a fraud? that gives us all such a bad\r\nconscience for the need which is that we weaken to the need that isn\'t?\r\nSuppose that poor fellow wasn\'t personally founded on fact: nevertheless,\r\nhe represented the truth; he was the ideal of the suffering which would\r\nbe less effective if realistically treated. That man is a great comfort\r\nto me. He probably rioted for days on that quarter I gave him; made a\r\ndinner very likely, or a champagne supper; and if \'Every Other Week\'\r\nwants to get rid of me, I intend to work that racket. You can hang round\r\nthe corner with Bella, and Tom can come up to me in tears, at stated\r\nintervals, and ask me if I\'ve found anything yet. To be sure, we might be\r\narrested and sent up somewhere. But even in that extreme case we should\r\nbe provided for. Oh no, I\'m not afraid of losing my place! I\'ve merely a\r\nsort of psychological curiosity to know how men like Dryfoos and\r\nFulkerson will work out the problem before them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nIt was a curiosity which Fulkerson himself shared, at least concerning\r\nDryfoos. "I don\'t know what the old man\'s going to do," he said to March\r\nthe day after the Marches had talked their future over. "Said anything to\r\nyou yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, not a word."\r\n\r\n"You\'re anxious, I suppose, same as I am. Fact is," said Fulkerson,\r\nblushing a little, "I can\'t ask to have a day named till I know where I\r\nam in connection with the old man. I can\'t tell whether I\'ve got to look\r\nout for something else or somebody else. Of course, it\'s full soon yet."\r\n\r\n"Yes," March said, "much sooner than it seems to us. We\'re so anxious\r\nabout the future that we don\'t remember how very recent the past is."\r\n\r\n"That\'s something so. The old man\'s hardly had time yet to pull himself\r\ntogether. Well, I\'m glad you feel that way about it, March. I guess it\'s\r\nmore of a blow to him than we realize. He was a good deal bound up in\r\nCoonrod, though he didn\'t always use him very well. Well, I reckon it\'s\r\napt to happen so oftentimes; curious how cruel love can be. Heigh? We\'re\r\nan awful mixture, March!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s the marvel and the curse, as Browning says."\r\n\r\n"Why, that poor boy himself," pursued Fulkerson, "had streaks of the mule\r\nin him that could give odds to Beaton, and he must have tried the old man\r\nby the way he would give in to his will and hold out against his\r\njudgment. I don\'t believe he ever budged a hairs-breadth from his\r\noriginal position about wanting to be a preacher and not wanting to be a\r\nbusiness man. Well, of course! I don\'t think business is all in all; but\r\nit must have made the old man mad to find that without saying anything,\r\nor doing anything to show it, and after seeming to come over to his\r\nground, and really coming, practically, Coonrod was just exactly where he\r\nfirst planted himself, every time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, people that have convictions are difficult. Fortunately, they\'re\r\nrare."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so? It seems to me that everybody\'s got convictions. Beaton\r\nhimself, who hasn\'t a principle to throw at a dog, has got convictions\r\nthe size of a barn. They ain\'t always the same ones, I know, but they\'re\r\nalways to the same effect, as far as Beaton\'s being Number One is\r\nconcerned. The old man\'s got convictions or did have, unless this thing\r\nlately has shaken him all up--and he believes that money will do\r\neverything. Colonel Woodburn\'s got convictions that he wouldn\'t part with\r\nfor untold millions. Why, March, you got convictions yourself!"\r\n\r\n"Have I?" said March. "I don\'t know what they are."\r\n\r\n"Well, neither do I; but I know you were ready to kick the trough over\r\nfor them when the old man wanted us to bounce Lindau that time."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said March; he remembered the fact; but he was still uncertain\r\njust what the convictions were that he had been so stanch for.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we could have got along without you," Fulkerson mused aloud.\r\n"It\'s astonishing how you always can get along in this world without the\r\nman that is simply indispensable. Makes a fellow realize that he could\r\ntake a day off now and then without deranging the solar system a great\r\ndeal. Now here\'s Coonrod--or, rather, he isn\'t. But that boy managed his\r\npart of the schooner so well that I used to tremble when I thought of his\r\ngetting the better of the old man and going into a convent or something\r\nof that kind; and now here he is, snuffed out in half a second, and I\r\ndon\'t believe but what we shall be sailing along just as chipper as usual\r\ninside of thirty days. I reckon it will bring the old man to the point\r\nwhen I come to talk with him about who\'s to be put in Coonrod\'s place. I\r\ndon\'t like very well to start the subject with him; but it\'s got to be\r\ndone some time."\r\n\r\n"Yes," March admitted. "It\'s terrible to think how unnecessary even the\r\nbest and wisest of us is to the purposes of Providence. When I looked at\r\nthat poor young fellow\'s face sometimes--so gentle and true and pure--I\r\nused to think the world was appreciably richer for his being in it. But\r\nare we appreciably poorer for his being out of it now?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t reckon we are," said Fulkerson. "And what a lot of the raw\r\nmaterial of all kinds the Almighty must have, to waste us the way He\r\nseems to do. Think of throwing away a precious creature like Coonrod\r\nDryfoos on one chance in a thousand of getting that old fool of a Lindau\r\nout of the way of being clubbed! For I suppose that was what Coonrod was\r\nup to. Say! Have you been round to see Lindau to-day?"\r\n\r\nSomething in the tone or the manner of Fulkerson startled March. "No! I\r\nhaven\'t seen him since yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said Fulkerson. "I guess I saw him a little while\r\nafter you did, and that young doctor there seemed to feel kind of worried\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n"Or not worried, exactly; they can\'t afford to let such things worry\r\nthem, I suppose; but--"\r\n\r\n"He\'s worse?" asked March.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he didn\'t say so. But I just wondered if you\'d seen him to-day."\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go now," said March, with a pang at heart. He had gone\r\nevery day to see Lindau, but this day he had thought he would not go, and\r\nthat was why his heart smote him. He knew that if he were in Lindau\'s\r\nplace Lindau would never have left his side if he could have helped it.\r\nMarch tried to believe that the case was the same, as it stood now; it\r\nseemed to him that he was always going to or from the hospital; he said\r\nto himself that it must do Lindau harm to be visited so much. But he knew\r\nthat this was not true when he was met at the door of the ward where\r\nLindau lay by the young doctor, who had come to feel a personal interest\r\nin March\'s interest in Lindau.\r\n\r\nHe smiled without gayety, and said, "He\'s just going."\r\n\r\n"What! Discharged?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no. He has been failing very fast since you saw him yesterday, and\r\nnow--" They had been walking softly and talking softly down the aisle\r\nbetween the long rows of beds. "Would you care to see him?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor made a slight gesture toward the white canvas screen which in\r\nsuch places forms the death-chamber of the poor and friendless. "Come\r\nround this way--he won\'t know you! I\'ve got rather fond of the poor old\r\nfellow. He wouldn\'t have a clergyman--sort of agnostic, isn\'t he? A good\r\nmany of these Germans are--but the young lady who\'s been coming to see\r\nhim--"\r\n\r\nThey both stopped. Lindau\'s grand, patriarchal head, foreshortened to\r\ntheir view, lay white upon the pillow, and his broad, white beard flowed\r\nupon the sheet, which heaved with those long last breaths. Beside his bed\r\nMargaret Vance was kneeling; her veil was thrown back, and her face was\r\nlifted; she held clasped between her hands the hand of the dying man; she\r\nmoved her lips inaudibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the experience of the whole race from time immemorial, when\r\ndeath comes to any one we know we helplessly regard it as an incident of\r\nlife, which will presently go on as before. Perhaps this is an\r\ninstinctive perception of the truth that it does go on somewhere; but we\r\nhave a sense of death as absolutely the end even for earth only if it\r\nrelates to some one remote or indifferent to us. March tried to project\r\nLindau to the necessary distance from himself in order to realize the\r\nfact in his case, but he could not, though the man with whom his youth\r\nhad been associated in a poetic friendship had not actually reentered the\r\nregion of his affection to the same degree, or in any like degree. The\r\nchanged conditions forbade that. He had a soreness of heart concerning\r\nhim; but he could not make sure whether this soreness was grief for his\r\ndeath, or remorse for his own uncandor with him about Dryfoos, or a\r\nforeboding of that accounting with his conscience which he knew his wife\r\nwould now exact of him down to the last minutest particular of their\r\njoint and several behavior toward Lindau ever since they had met him in\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nHe felt something knock against his shoulder, and he looked up to have\r\nhis hat struck from his head by a horse\'s nose. He saw the horse put his\r\nfoot on the hat, and he reflected, "Now it will always look like an\r\naccordion," and he heard the horse\'s driver address him some sarcasms\r\nbefore he could fully awaken to the situation. He was standing bareheaded\r\nin the middle of Fifth Avenue and blocking the tide of carriages flowing\r\nin either direction. Among the faces put out of the carriage windows he\r\nsaw that of Dryfoos looking from a coupe. The old man knew him, and said,\r\n"Jump in here, Mr. March"; and March, who had mechanically picked up his\r\nhat, and was thinking, "Now I shall have to tell Isabel about this at\r\nonce, and she will never trust me on the street again without her,"\r\nmechanically obeyed. Her confidence in him had been undermined by his\r\nbeing so near Conrad when he was shot; and it went through his mind that\r\nhe would get Dryfoos to drive him to a hatter\'s, where he could buy a new\r\nhat, and not be obliged to confess his narrow escape to his wife till the\r\nincident was some days old and she could bear it better. It quite drove\r\nLindau\'s death out of his mind for the moment; and when Dryfoos said if\r\nhe was going home he would drive up to the first cross-street and turn\r\nback with him, March said he would be glad if he would take him to a\r\nhat-store. The old man put his head out again and told the driver to take\r\nthem to the Fifth Avenue Hotel. "There\'s a hat-store around there\r\nsomewhere, seems to me," he said; and they talked of March\'s accident as\r\nwell as they could in the rattle and clatter of the street till they\r\nreached the place. March got his hat, passing a joke with the hatter\r\nabout the impossibility of pressing his old hat over again, and came out\r\nto thank Dryfoos and take leave of him.\r\n\r\n"If you ain\'t in any great hurry," the old man said, "I wish you\'d get in\r\nhere a minute. I\'d like to have a little talk with you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," said March, and he thought: "It\'s coming now about what\r\nhe intends to do with \'Every Other Week.\' Well, I might as well have all\r\nthe misery at once and have it over."\r\n\r\nDryfoos called up to his driver, who bent his head down sidewise to\r\nlisten: "Go over there on Madison Avenue, onto that asphalt, and keep\r\ndrivin\' up and down till I stop you. I can\'t hear myself think on these\r\npavements," he said to March. But after they got upon the asphalt, and\r\nbegan smoothly rolling over it, he seemed in no haste to begin. At last\r\nhe said, "I wanted to talk with you about that--that Dutchman that was at\r\nmy dinner--Lindau," and March\'s heart gave a jump with wonder whether he\r\ncould already have heard of Lindau\'s death; but in an instant he\r\nperceived that this was impossible. "I been talkin\' with Fulkerson about\r\nhim, and he says they had to take the balance of his arm off."\r\n\r\nMarch nodded; it seemed to him he could not speak. He could not make out\r\nfrom the close face of the old man anything of his motive. It was set,\r\nbut set as a piece of broken mechanism is when it has lost the power to\r\nrelax itself. There was no other history in it of what the man had passed\r\nthrough in his son\'s death.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," Dryfoos resumed, looking aside at the cloth window-strap,\r\nwhich he kept fingering, "as you quite understood what made me the\r\nmaddest. I didn\'t tell him I could talk Dutch, because I can\'t keep it up\r\nwith a regular German; but my father was Pennsylvany Dutch, and I could\r\nunderstand what he was saying to you about me. I know I had no business\r\nto understood it, after I let him think I couldn\'t but I did, and I\r\ndidn\'t like very well to have a man callin\' me a traitor and a tyrant at\r\nmy own table. Well, I look at it differently now, and I reckon I had\r\nbetter have tried to put up with it; and I would, if I could have\r\nknown--" He stopped with a quivering lip, and then went on: "Then, again,\r\nI didn\'t like his talkin\' that paternalism of his. I always heard it was\r\nthe worst kind of thing for the country; I was brought up to think the\r\nbest government was the one that governs the least; and I didn\'t want to\r\nhear that kind of talk from a man that was livin\' on my money. I couldn\'t\r\nbear it from him. Or I thought I couldn\'t before--before--" He stopped\r\nagain, and gulped. "I reckon now there ain\'t anything I couldn\'t bear."\r\nMarch was moved by the blunt words and the mute stare forward with which\r\nthey ended. "Mr. Dryfoos, I didn\'t know that you understood Lindau\'s\r\nGerman, or I shouldn\'t have allowed him he wouldn\'t have allowed\r\nhimself--to go on. He wouldn\'t have knowingly abused his position of\r\nguest to censure you, no matter how much he condemned you." "I don\'t care\r\nfor it now," said Dryfoos. "It\'s all past and gone, as far as I\'m\r\nconcerned; but I wanted you to see that I wasn\'t tryin\' to punish him for\r\nhis opinions, as you said."\r\n\r\n"No; I see now," March assented, though he thought his position still\r\njustified. "I wish--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know as I understand much about his opinions, anyway; but I\r\nain\'t ready to say I want the men dependent on me to manage my business\r\nfor me. I always tried to do the square thing by my hands; and in that\r\nparticular case out there I took on all the old hands just as fast as\r\nthey left their Union. As for the game I came on them, it was dog eat\r\ndog, anyway."\r\n\r\nMarch could have laughed to think how far this old man was from even\r\nconceiving of Lindau\'s point of view, and how he was saying the worst of\r\nhimself that Lindau could have said of him. No one could have\r\ncharacterized the kind of thing he had done more severely than he when he\r\ncalled it dog eat dog.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a great deal to be said on both sides," March began, hoping to\r\nlead up through this generality to the fact of Lindau\'s death; but the\r\nold man went on:\r\n\r\n"Well, all I wanted him to know is that I wasn\'t trying to punish him for\r\nwhat he said about things in general. You naturally got that idea, I\r\nreckon; but I always went in for lettin\' people say what they please and\r\nthink what they please; it\'s the only way in a free country."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, Mr. Dryfoos, that it would make little difference to Lindau\r\nnow--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he bears malice for it," said Dryfoos, "but what I want\r\nto do is to have him told so. He could understand just why I didn\'t want\r\nto be called hard names, and yet I didn\'t object to his thinkin\' whatever\r\nhe pleased. I\'d like him to know--"\r\n\r\n"No one can speak to him, no one can tell him," March began again, but\r\nagain Dryfoos prevented him from going on.\r\n\r\n"I understand it\'s a delicate thing; and I\'m not askin\' you to do it.\r\nWhat I would really like to do--if you think he could be prepared for it,\r\nsome way, and could stand it--would be to go to him myself, and tell him\r\njust what the trouble was. I\'m in hopes, if I done that, he could see how\r\nI felt about it."\r\n\r\nA picture of Dryfoos going to the dead Lindau with his vain regrets\r\npresented itself to March, and he tried once more to make the old man\r\nunderstand. "Mr. Dryfoos," he said, "Lindau is past all that forever,"\r\nand he felt the ghastly comedy of it when Dryfoos continued, without\r\nheeding him.\r\n\r\n"I got a particular reason why I want him to believe it wasn\'t his ideas\r\nI objected to--them ideas of his about the government carryin\' everything\r\non and givin\' work. I don\'t understand \'em exactly, but I found a\r\nwritin\'--among--my son\'s--things" (he seemed to force the words through\r\nhis teeth), "and I reckon he--thought--that way. Kind of a diary--where\r\nhe--put down--his thoughts. My son and me--we differed about a good--many\r\nthings." His chin shook, and from time to time he stopped. "I wasn\'t very\r\ngood to him, I reckon; I crossed him where I guess I got no business to\r\ncross him; but I thought everything of--Coonrod. He was the best boy,\r\nfrom a baby, that ever was; just so patient and mild, and done whatever\r\nhe was told. I ought to \'a\' let him been a preacher! Oh, my son! my son!"\r\nThe sobs could not be kept back any longer; they shook the old man with a\r\nviolence that made March afraid for him; but he controlled himself at\r\nlast with a series of hoarse sounds like barks. "Well, it\'s all past and\r\ngone! But as I understand you from what you saw, when Coonrod\r\nwas--killed, he was tryin\' to save that old man from trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! It seemed so to me."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do, then! I want you to have him come back and write for the\r\nbook when he gets well. I want you to find out and let me know if there\'s\r\nanything I can do for him. I\'ll feel as if I done it--for my--son. I\'ll\r\ntake him into my own house, and do for him there, if you say so, when he\r\ngets so he can be moved. I\'ll wait on him myself. It\'s what Coonrod \'d\r\ndo, if he was here. I don\'t feel any hardness to him because it was him\r\nthat got Coonrod killed, as you might say, in one sense of the term; but\r\nI\'ve tried to think it out, and I feel like I was all the more beholden\r\nto him because my son died tryin\' to save him. Whatever I do, I\'ll be\r\ndoin\' it for Coonrod, and that\'s enough for me." He seemed to have\r\nfinished, and he turned to March as if to hear what he had to say.\r\n\r\nMarch hesitated. "I\'m afraid, Mr. Dryfoos--Didn\'t Fulkerson tell you that\r\nLindau was very sick?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. But he\'s all right, he said."\r\n\r\nNow it had to come, though the fact had been latterly playing fast and\r\nloose with March\'s consciousness. Something almost made him smile; the\r\nwillingness he had once felt to give this old man pain; then he consoled\r\nhimself by thinking that at least he was not obliged to meet Dryfoos\'s\r\nwish to make atonement with the fact that Lindau had renounced him, and\r\nwould on no terms work for such a man as he, or suffer any kindness from\r\nhim. In this light Lindau seemed the harder of the two, and March had the\r\nmomentary force to say--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dryfoos--it can\'t be. Lindau--I have just come from him--is dead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n"How did he take it? How could he bear it? Oh, Basil! I wonder you could\r\nhave the heart to say it to him. It was cruel!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, cruel enough, my dear," March owned to his wife, when they talked\r\nthe matter over on his return home. He could not wait till the children\r\nwere out of the way, and afterward neither he nor his wife was sorry that\r\nhe had spoken of it before them. The girl cried plentifully for her old\r\nfriend who was dead, and said she hated Mr. Dryfoos, and then was sorry\r\nfor him, too; and the boy listened to all, and spoke with a serious sense\r\nthat pleased his father. "But as to how he took it," March went on to\r\nanswer his wife\'s question about Dryfoos--"how do any of us take a thing\r\nthat hurts? Some of us cry out, and some of us don\'t. Dryfoos drew a kind\r\nof long, quivering breath, as a child does when it grieves--there\'s\r\nsomething curiously simple and primitive about him--and didn\'t say\r\nanything. After a while he asked me how he could see the people at the\r\nhospital about the remains; I gave him my card to the young doctor there\r\nthat had charge of Lindau. I suppose he was still carrying forward his\r\nplan of reparation in his mind--to the dead for the dead. But how\r\nuseless! If he could have taken the living Lindau home with him, and\r\ncared for him all his days, what would it have profited the gentle\r\ncreature whose life his worldly ambition vexed and thwarted here? He\r\nmight as well offer a sacrifice at Conrad\'s grave. Children," said March,\r\nturning to them, "death is an exile that no remorse and no love can\r\nreach. Remember that, and be good to every one here on earth, for your\r\nlonging to retrieve any harshness or unkindness to the dead will be the\r\nvery ecstasy of anguish to you. I wonder," he mused, "if one of the\r\nreasons why we\'re shut up to our ignorance of what is to be hereafter\r\nisn\'t because if we were sure of another world we might be still more\r\nbrutal to one another here, in the hope of making reparation somewhere\r\nelse. Perhaps, if we ever come to obey the law of love on earth, the\r\nmystery of death will be taken away."\r\n\r\n"Well"--the ancestral Puritanism spoke in Mrs. March--"these two old men\r\nhave been terribly punished. They have both been violent and wilful, and\r\nthey have both been punished. No one need ever tell me there is not a\r\nmoral government of the universe!"\r\n\r\nMarch always disliked to hear her talk in this way, which did both her\r\nhead and heart injustice. "And Conrad," he said, "what was he punished\r\nfor?"\r\n\r\n"He?"--she answered, in an exaltation--"he suffered for the sins of\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well, if you put it in that way, yes. That goes on continually.\r\nThat\'s another mystery."\r\n\r\nHe fell to brooding on it, and presently he heard his son saying, "I\r\nsuppose, papa, that Mr. Lindau died in a bad cause?"\r\n\r\nMarch was startled. He had always been so sorry for Lindau, and admired\r\nhis courage and generosity so much, that he had never fairly considered\r\nthis question. "Why, yes," he answered; "he died in the cause of\r\ndisorder; he was trying to obstruct the law. No doubt there was a wrong\r\nthere, an inconsistency and an injustice that he felt keenly; but it\r\ncould not be reached in his way without greater wrong."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s what I thought," said the boy. "And what\'s the use of our\r\never fighting about anything in America? I always thought we could vote\r\nanything we wanted."\r\n\r\n"We can, if we\'re honest, and don\'t buy and sell one another\'s votes,"\r\nsaid his father. "And men like Lindau, who renounce the American means as\r\nhopeless, and let their love of justice hurry them into sympathy with\r\nviolence--yes, they are wrong; and poor Lindau did die in a bad cause, as\r\nyou say, Tom."\r\n\r\n"I think Conrad had no business there, or you, either, Basil," said his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t defend myself," said March. "I was there in the cause of\r\nliterary curiosity and of conjugal disobedience. But Conrad--yes, he had\r\nsome business there: it was his business to suffer there for the sins of\r\nothers. Isabel, we can\'t throw aside that old doctrine of the Atonement\r\nyet. The life of Christ, it wasn\'t only in healing the sick and going\r\nabout to do good; it was suffering for the sins of others. That\'s as\r\ngreat a mystery as the mystery of death. Why should there be such a\r\nprinciple in the world? But it\'s been felt, and more or less dumbly,\r\nblindly recognized ever since Calvary. If we love mankind, pity them, we\r\neven wish to suffer for them. That\'s what has created the religious\r\norders in all times--the brotherhoods and sisterhoods that belong to our\r\nday as much as to the mediaeval past. That\'s what is driving a girl like\r\nMargaret Vance, who has everything that the world can offer her young\r\nbeauty, on to the work of a Sister of Charity among the poor and the\r\ndying."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" cried Mrs. March. "How--how did she look there, Basil?" She\r\nhad her feminine misgivings; she was not sure but the girl was something\r\nof a poseuse, and enjoyed the picturesqueness, as well as the pain; and\r\nshe wished to be convinced that it was not so.\r\n\r\n"Well," she said, when March had told again the little there was to tell,\r\n"I suppose it must be a great trial to a woman like Mrs. Horn to have her\r\nniece going that way."\r\n\r\n"The way of Christ?" asked March, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Christ came into the world to teach us how to live rightly in it,\r\ntoo. If we were all to spend our time in hospitals, it would be rather\r\ndismal for the homes. But perhaps you don\'t think the homes are worth\r\nminding?" she suggested, with a certain note in her voice that he knew.\r\n\r\nHe got up and kissed her. "I think the gimcrackeries are." He took the\r\nhat he had set down on the parlor table on coming in, and started to put\r\nit in the hall, and that made her notice it.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been getting a new hat!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," he hesitated; "the old one had got--was decidedly shabby."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s right. I don\'t like you to wear them too long. Did you\r\nleave the old one to be pressed?"\r\n\r\n"Well, the hatter seemed to think it was hardly worth pressing," said\r\nMarch. He decided that for the present his wife\'s nerves had quite all\r\nthey could bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nIt was in a manner grotesque, but to March it was all the more natural\r\nfor that reason, that Dryfoos should have Lindau\'s funeral from his\r\nhouse. He knew the old man to be darkly groping, through the payment of\r\nthese vain honors to the dead, for some atonement to his son, and he\r\nimagined him finding in them such comfort as comes from doing all one\r\ncan, even when all is useless.\r\n\r\nNo one knew what Lindau\'s religion was, and in default they had had the\r\nAnglican burial service read over him; it seems so often the refuge of\r\nthe homeless dead. Mrs. Dryfoos came down for the ceremony. She\r\nunderstood that it was for Coonrod\'s sake that his father wished the\r\nfuneral to be there; and she confided to Mrs. March that she believed\r\nCoonrod would have been pleased. "Coonrod was a member of the \'Piscopal\r\nChurch; and fawther\'s doin\' the whole thing for Coonrod as much as for\r\nanybody. He thought the world of Coonrod, fawther did. Mela, she kind of\r\nthought it would look queer to have two funerals from the same house,\r\nhand-runnin\', as you might call it, and one of \'em no relation, either;\r\nbut when she saw how fawther was bent on it, she give in. Seems as if she\r\nwas tryin\' to make up to fawther for Coonrod as much as she could. Mela\r\nalways was a good child, but nobody can ever come up to Coonrod."\r\n\r\nMarch felt all the grotesqueness, the hopeless absurdity of Dryfoos\'s\r\nendeavor at atonement in these vain obsequies to the man for whom he\r\nbelieved his son to have died; but the effort had its magnanimity, its\r\npathos, and there was a poetry that appealed to him in the reconciliation\r\nthrough death of men, of ideas, of conditions, that could only have gone\r\nwarring on in life. He thought, as the priest went on with the solemn\r\nliturgy, how all the world must come together in that peace which,\r\nstruggle and strive as we may, shall claim us at last. He looked at\r\nDryfoos, and wondered whether he would consider these rites a sufficient\r\ntribute, or whether there was enough in him to make him realize their\r\nfutility, except as a mere sign of his wish to retrieve the past. He\r\nthought how we never can atone for the wrong we do; the heart we have\r\ngrieved and wounded cannot kindle with pity for us when once it is\r\nstilled; and yet we can put our evil from us with penitence, and somehow,\r\nsomewhere, the order of loving kindness, which our passion or our\r\nwilfulness has disturbed, will be restored.\r\n\r\nDryfoos, through Fulkerson, had asked all the more intimate contributors\r\nof \'Every Other Week\' to come. Beaton was absent, but Fulkerson had\r\nbrought Miss Woodburn, with her father, and Mrs. Leighton and Alma, to\r\nfill up, as he said. Mela was much present, and was official with the\r\narrangement of the flowers and the welcome of the guests. She imparted\r\nthis impersonality to her reception of Kendricks, whom Fulkerson met in\r\nthe outer hall with his party, and whom he presented in whisper to them\r\nall. Kendricks smiled under his breath, as it were, and was then mutely\r\nand seriously polite to the Leightons. Alma brought a little bunch of\r\nflowers, which were lost in those which Dryfoos had ordered to be\r\nunsparingly provided.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of satisfaction to Mela to have Miss Vance come, and\r\nreassuring as to how it would look to have the funeral there; Miss Vance\r\nwould certainly not have come unless it had been all right; she had come,\r\nand had sent some Easter lilies.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t Christine coming down?" Fulkerson asked Mela.\r\n\r\n"No, she ain\'t a bit well, and she ain\'t been, ever since Coonrod died. I\r\ndon\'t know, what\'s got over her," said Mela. She added, "Well, I should\r\n\'a\' thought Mr. Beaton would \'a\' made out to \'a\' come!"\r\n\r\n"Beaton\'s peculiar," said Fulkerson. "If he thinks you want him he takes\r\na pleasure in not letting you have him."\r\n\r\n"Well, goodness knows, I don\'t want him," said the girl.\r\n\r\nChristine kept her room, and for the most part kept her bed; but there\r\nseemed nothing definitely the matter with her, and she would not let them\r\ncall a doctor. Her mother said she reckoned she was beginning to feel the\r\nspring weather, that always perfectly pulled a body down in New York; and\r\nMela said if being as cross as two sticks was any sign of spring-fever,\r\nChristine had it bad. She was faithfully kind to her, and submitted to\r\nall her humors, but she recompensed herself by the freest criticism of\r\nChristine when not in actual attendance on her. Christine would not\r\nsuffer Mrs. Mandel to approach her, and she had with her father a sullen\r\nsubmission which was not resignation. For her, apparently, Conrad had not\r\ndied, or had died in vain.\r\n\r\n"Pshaw!" said Mela, one morning when she came to breakfast, "I reckon if\r\nwe was to send up an old card of Mr. Beaton\'s she\'d rattle down-stairs\r\nfast enough. If she\'s sick, she\'s love-sick. It makes me sick to see\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMela was talking to Mrs. Mandel, but her father looked up from his plate\r\nand listened. Mela went on: "I don\'t know what\'s made the fellow quit\r\ncomun\'. But he was an aggravatun\' thing, and no more dependable than\r\nwater. It\'s just like Air. Fulkerson said, if he thinks you want him\r\nhe\'ll take a pleasure in not lettun\' you have him. I reckon that\'s what\'s\r\nthe matter with Christine. I believe in my heart the girl \'ll die if she\r\ndon\'t git him."\r\n\r\nMela went on to eat her breakfast with her own good appetite. She now\r\nalways came down to keep her father company, as she said, and she did her\r\nbest to cheer and comfort him. At least she kept the talk going, and she\r\nhad it nearly all to herself, for Mrs. Mandel was now merely staying on\r\nprovisionally, and, in the absence of any regrets or excuses from\r\nChristine, was looking ruefully forward to the moment when she must leave\r\neven this ungentle home for the chances of the ruder world outside.\r\n\r\nThe old man said nothing at table, but, when Mela went up to see if she\r\ncould do anything for Christine, he asked Mrs. Mandel again about all the\r\nfacts of her last interview with Beaton.\r\n\r\nShe gave them as fully as she could remember them, and the old man made\r\nno comment on them. But he went out directly after, and at the \'Every\r\nOther Week\' office he climbed the stairs to Fulkerson\'s room and asked\r\nfor Beaton\'s address. No one yet had taken charge of Conrad\'s work, and\r\nFulkerson was running the thing himself, as he said, till he could talk\r\nwith Dryfoos about it. The old man would not look into the empty room\r\nwhere he had last seen his son alive; he turned his face away and hurried\r\nby the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nThe course of public events carried Beaton\'s private affairs beyond the\r\nreach of his simple first intention to renounce his connection with\r\n\'Every Other Week.\' In fact, this was not perhaps so simple as it seemed,\r\nand long before it could be put in effect it appeared still simpler to do\r\nnothing about the matter--to remain passive and leave the initiative to\r\nDryfoos, to maintain the dignity of unconsciousness and let recognition\r\nof any change in the situation come from those who had caused the change.\r\nAfter all, it was rather absurd to propose making a purely personal\r\nquestion the pivot on which his relations with \'Every Other Week\' turned.\r\nHe took a hint from March\'s position and decided that he did not know\r\nDryfoos in these relations; he knew only Fulkerson, who had certainly had\r\nnothing to do with Mrs. Mandel\'s asking his intentions. As he reflected\r\nupon this he became less eager to look Fulkerson up and make the magazine\r\na partner of his own sufferings. This was the soberer mood to which\r\nBeaton trusted that night even before he slept, and he awoke fully\r\nconfirmed in it. As he examined the offence done him in the cold light of\r\nday, he perceived that it had not come either from Mrs. Mandel, who was\r\nvisibly the faltering and unwilling instrument of it, or from Christine,\r\nwho was altogether ignorant of it, but from Dryfoos, whom he could not\r\nhurt by giving up his place. He could only punish Fulkerson by that, and\r\nFulkerson was innocent. Justice and interest alike dictated the passive\r\ncourse to which Beaton inclined; and he reflected that he might safely\r\nleave the punishment of Dryfoos to Christine, who would find out what had\r\nhappened, and would be able to take care of herself in any encounter of\r\ntempers with her father.\r\n\r\nBeaton did not go to the office during the week that followed upon this\r\nconclusion; but they were used there to these sudden absences of his,\r\nand, as his work for the time was in train, nothing was made of his\r\nstaying away, except the sarcastic comment which the thought of him was\r\napt to excite in the literary department. He no longer came so much to\r\nthe Leightons, and Fulkerson was in no state of mind to miss any one\r\nthere except Miss Woodburn, whom he never missed. Beaton was left, then,\r\nunmolestedly awaiting the course of destiny, when he read in the morning\r\npaper, over his coffee at Maroni\'s, the deeply scare-headed story of\r\nConrad\'s death and the clubbing of Lindau. He probably cared as little\r\nfor either of them as any man that ever saw them; but he felt a shock, if\r\nnot a pang, at Conrad\'s fate, so out of keeping with his life and\r\ncharacter. He did not know what to do; and he did nothing. He was not\r\nasked to the funeral, but he had not expected that, and, when Fulkerson\r\nbrought him notice that Lindau was also to be buried from Dryfoos\'s\r\nhouse, it was without his usual sullen vindictiveness that he kept away.\r\nIn his sort, and as much as a man could who was necessarily so much taken\r\nup with himself, he was sorry for Conrad\'s father; Beaton had a peculiar\r\ntenderness for his own father, and he imagined how his father would feel\r\nif it were he who had been killed in Conrad\'s place, as it might very\r\nwell have been; he sympathized with himself in view of the possibility;\r\nand for once they were mistaken who thought him indifferent and merely\r\nbrutal in his failure to appear at Lindau\'s obsequies.\r\n\r\nHe would really have gone if he had known how to reconcile his presence\r\nin that house with the terms of his effective banishment from it; and he\r\nwas rather forgivingly finding himself wronged in the situation, when\r\nDryfoos knocked at the studio door the morning after Lindau\'s funeral.\r\nBeaton roared out, "Come in!" as he always did to a knock if he had not a\r\nmodel; if he had a model he set the door slightly ajar, and with his\r\npalette on his thumb frowned at his visitor and told him he could not\r\ncome in. Dryfoos fumbled about for the knob in the dim passageway\r\noutside, and Beaton, who had experience of people\'s difficulties with it,\r\nsuddenly jerked the door open. The two men stood confronted, and at first\r\nsight of each other their quiescent dislike revived. Each would have been\r\nwilling to turn away from the other, but that was not possible. Beaton\r\nsnorted some sort of inarticulate salutation, which Dryfoos did not try\r\nto return; he asked if he could see him alone for a minute or two, and\r\nBeaton bade him come in, and swept some paint-blotched rags from the\r\nchair which he told him to take. He noticed, as the old man sank\r\ntremulously into it, that his movement was like that of his own father,\r\nand also that he looked very much like Christine. Dryfoos folded his\r\nhands tremulously on the top of his horn-handled stick, and he was rather\r\nfinely haggard, with the dark hollows round his black eyes and the fall\r\nof the muscles on either side of his chin. He had forgotten to take his\r\nsoft, wide-brimmed hat off; and Beaton felt a desire to sketch him just\r\nas he sat.\r\n\r\nDryfoos suddenly pulled himself together from the dreary absence into\r\nwhich he fell at first. "Young man," he began, "maybe I\'ve come here on a\r\nfool\'s errand," and Beaton rather fancied that beginning.\r\n\r\nBut it embarrassed him a little, and he said, with a shy glance aside, "I\r\ndon\'t know what you mean." "I reckon," Dryfoos answered, quietly, "you\r\ngot your notion, though. I set that woman on to speak to you the way she\r\ndone. But if there was anything wrong in the way she spoke, or if you\r\ndidn\'t feel like she had any right to question you up as if we suspected\r\nyou of anything mean, I want you to say so."\r\n\r\nBeaton said nothing, and the old man went on.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t very well up in the ways of the world, and I don\'t pretend to\r\nbe. All I want is to be fair and square with everybody. I\'ve made\r\nmistakes, though, in my time--" He stopped, and Beaton was not proof\r\nagainst the misery of his face, which was twisted as with some strong\r\nphysical ache. "I don\'t know as I want to make any more, if I can help\r\nit. I don\'t know but what you had a right to keep on comin\', and if you\r\nhad I want you to say so. Don\'t you be afraid but what I\'ll take it in\r\nthe right way. I don\'t want to take advantage of anybody, and I don\'t ask\r\nyou to say any more than that."\r\n\r\nBeaton did not find the humiliation of the man who had humiliated him so\r\nsweet as he could have fancied it might be. He knew how it had come\r\nabout, and that it was an effect of love for his child; it did not matter\r\nby what ungracious means she had brought him to know that he loved her\r\nbetter than his own will, that his wish for her happiness was stronger\r\nthan his pride; it was enough that he was now somehow brought to give\r\nproof of it. Beaton could not be aware of all that dark coil of\r\ncircumstance through which Dryfoos\'s present action evolved itself; the\r\nworst of this was buried in the secret of the old man\'s heart, a worm of\r\nperpetual torment. What was apparent to another was that he was broken by\r\nthe sorrow that had fallen upon him, and it was this that Beaton\r\nrespected and pitied in his impulse to be frank and kind in his answer.\r\n\r\n"No, I had no right to keep coming to your house in the way I did,\r\nunless--unless I meant more than I ever said." Beaton added: "I don\'t say\r\nthat what you did was usual--in this country, at any rate; but I can\'t\r\nsay you were wrong. Since you speak to me about the matter, it\'s only\r\nfair to myself to say that a good deal goes on in life without much\r\nthinking of consequences. That\'s the way I excuse myself."\r\n\r\n"And you say Mrs. Mandel done right?" asked Dryfoos, as if he wished\r\nsimply to be assured of a point of etiquette.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did right. I\'ve nothing to complain of."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all I wanted to know," said Dryfoos; but apparently he had not\r\nfinished, and he did not go, though the silence that Beaton now kept gave\r\nhim a chance to do so. He began a series of questions which had no\r\nrelation to the matter in hand, though they were strictly personal to\r\nBeaton. "What countryman are you?" he asked, after a moment.\r\n\r\n"What countryman?" Beaton frowned back at him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, are you an American by birth?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I was born in Syracuse."\r\n\r\n"Protestant?"\r\n\r\n"My father is a Scotch Seceder."\r\n\r\n"What business is your father in?"\r\n\r\nBeaton faltered and blushed; then he answered:\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the monument business, as he calls it. He\'s a tombstone cutter."\r\nNow that he was launched, Beaton saw no reason for not declaring, "My\r\nfather\'s always been a poor man, and worked with his own hands for his\r\nliving." He had too slight esteem socially for Dryfoos to conceal a fact\r\nfrom him that he might have wished to blink with others.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s right," said Dryfoos. "I used to farm it myself. I\'ve got a\r\ngood pile of money together, now. At first it didn\'t come easy; but now\r\nit\'s got started it pours in and pours in; it seems like there was no end\r\nto it. I\'ve got well on to three million; but it couldn\'t keep me from\r\nlosin\' my son. It can\'t buy me back a minute of his life; not all the\r\nmoney in the world can do it!"\r\n\r\nHe grieved this out as if to himself rather than to Beaton, who, scarcely\r\nventured to say, "I know--I am very sorry--"\r\n\r\n"How did you come," Dryfoos interrupted, "to take up paintin\'?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said Beaton, a little scornfully. "You don\'t take\r\na thing of that kind up, I fancy. I always wanted to paint."\r\n\r\n"Father try to stop you?"\r\n\r\n"No. It wouldn\'t have been of any use. Why--"\r\n\r\n"My son, he wanted to be a preacher, and I did stop him or I thought I\r\ndid. But I reckon he was a preacher, all the same, every minute of his\r\nlife. As you say, it ain\'t any use to try to stop a thing like that. I\r\nreckon if a child has got any particular bent, it was given to it; and\r\nit\'s goin\' against the grain, it\'s goin\' against the law, to try to bend\r\nit some other way. There\'s lots of good business men, Mr. Beaton, twenty\r\nof \'em to every good preacher?"\r\n\r\n"I imagine more than twenty," said Beaton, amused and touched through his\r\ncuriosity as to what the old man was driving at by the quaint simplicity\r\nof his speculations.\r\n\r\n"Father ever come to the city?"\r\n\r\n"No; he never has the time; and my mother\'s an invalid."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Brothers and sisters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; we\'re a large family."\r\n\r\n"I lost two little fellers--twins," said Dryfoos, sadly. "But we hain\'t\r\never had but just the five. Ever take portraits?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beaton, meeting this zigzag in the queries as seriously as\r\nthe rest. "I don\'t think I am good at it."\r\n\r\nDryfoos got to his feet. "I wish you\'d paint a likeness of my son. You\'ve\r\nseen him plenty of times. We won\'t fight about the price, don\'t you be\r\nafraid of that."\r\n\r\nBeaton was astonished, and in a mistaken way he was disgusted. He saw\r\nthat Dryfoos was trying to undo Mrs. Mandel\'s work practically, and get\r\nhim to come again to his house; that he now conceived of the offence\r\ngiven him as condoned, and wished to restore the former situation. He\r\nknew that he was attempting this for Christine\'s sake, but he was not the\r\nman to imagine that Dryfoos was trying not only to tolerate him, but to\r\nlike him; and, in fact, Dryfoos was not wholly conscious himself of this\r\nend. What they both understood was that Dryfoos was endeavoring to get at\r\nBeaton through Conrad\'s memory; but with one this was its dedication to a\r\npurpose of self sacrifice, and with the other a vulgar and shameless use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do it," said Beaton. "I couldn\'t think of attempting it."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Dryfoos persisted. "We got some photographs of him; he didn\'t\r\nlike to sit very well; but his mother got him to; and you know how he\r\nlooked."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do it--I couldn\'t. I can\'t even consider it. I\'m very sorry.\r\nI would, if it were possible. But it isn\'t possible."\r\n\r\n"I reckon if you see the photographs once--"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that, Mr. Dryfoos. But I\'m not in the way of that kind of thing\r\nany more."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give any price you\'ve a mind to name--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t the money!" cried Beaton, beginning to lose control of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe old man did not notice him. He sat with his head fallen forward, and\r\nhis chin resting on his folded hands. Thinking of the portrait, he saw\r\nConrad\'s face before him, reproachful, astonished, but all gentle as it\r\nlooked when Conrad caught his hand that day after he struck him; he heard\r\nhim say, "Father!" and the sweat gathered on his forehead. "Oh, my God!"\r\nhe groaned. "No; there ain\'t anything I can do now."\r\n\r\nBeaton did not know whether Dryfoos was speaking to him or not. He\r\nstarted toward him. "Are you ill?"\r\n\r\n"No, there ain\'t anything the matter," said the old man. "But I guess\r\nI\'ll lay down on your settee a minute." He tottered with Beaton\'s help to\r\nthe aesthetic couch covered with a tiger-skin, on which Beaton had once\r\nthought of painting a Cleopatra; but he could never get the right model.\r\nAs the old man stretched himself out on it, pale and suffering, he did\r\nnot look much like a Cleopatra, but Beaton was struck with his\r\neffectiveness, and the likeness between him and his daughter; she would\r\nmake a very good Cleopatra in some ways. All the time, while these\r\nthoughts passed through his mind, he was afraid Dryfoos would die. The\r\nold man fetched his breath in gasps, which presently smoothed and\r\nlengthened into his normal breathing. Beaton got him a glass of wine, and\r\nafter tasting it he sat up.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to excuse me," he said, getting back to his characteristic\r\ngrimness with surprising suddenness, when once he began to recover\r\nhimself. "I\'ve been through a good deal lately; and sometimes it ketches\r\nme round the heart like a pain."\r\n\r\nIn his life of selfish immunity from grief, Beaton could not understand\r\nthis experience that poignant sorrow brings; he said to himself that\r\nDryfoos was going the way of angina pectoris; as he began shuffling off\r\nthe tiger-skin he said: "Had you better get up? Wouldn\'t you like me to\r\ncall a doctor?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m all right, young man." Dryfoos took his hat and stick from him, but\r\nhe made for the door so uncertainly that Beaton put his hand under his\r\nelbow and helped him out, and down the stairs, to his coupe.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you better let me drive home with you?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What?" said Dryfoos, suspiciously.\r\n\r\nBeaton repeated his question.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'m able to go home alone," said Dryfoos, in a surly tone, and\r\nhe put his head out of the window and called up "Home!" to the driver,\r\nwho immediately started off and left Beaton standing beside the\r\ncurbstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nBeaton wasted the rest of the day in the emotions and speculations which\r\nDryfoos\'s call inspired. It was not that they continuously occupied him,\r\nbut they broke up the train of other thoughts, and spoiled him for work;\r\na very little spoiled Beaton for work; he required just the right mood\r\nfor work. He comprehended perfectly well that Dryfoos had made him that\r\nextraordinary embassy because he wished him to renew his visits, and he\r\neasily imagined the means that had brought him to this pass. From what he\r\nknew of that girl he did not envy her father his meeting with her when he\r\nmust tell her his mission had failed. But had it failed? When Beaton came\r\nto ask himself this question, he could only perceive that he and Dryfoos\r\nhad failed to find any ground of sympathy, and had parted in the same\r\ndislike with which they had met. But as to any other failure, it was\r\ncertainly tacit, and it still rested with him to give it effect. He could\r\ngo back to Dryfoos\'s house, as freely as before, and it was clear that he\r\nwas very much desired to come back. But if he went back it was also clear\r\nthat he must go back with intentions more explicit than before, and now\r\nhe had to ask himself just how much or how little he had meant by going\r\nthere. His liking for Christine had certainly not increased, but the\r\ncharm, on the other hand, of holding a leopardess in leash had not yet\r\npalled upon him. In his life of inconstancies, it was a pleasure to rest\r\nupon something fixed, and the man who had no control over himself liked\r\nlogically enough to feel his control of some one else. The fact cannot\r\nother wise be put in terms, and the attraction which Christine Dryfoos\r\nhad for him, apart from this, escapes from all terms, as anything purely\r\nand merely passional must. He had seen from the first that she was a cat,\r\nand so far as youth forecasts such things, he felt that she would be a\r\nshrew. But he had a perverse sense of her beauty, and he knew a sort of\r\nlife in which her power to molest him with her temper could be reduced to\r\nthe smallest proportions, and even broken to pieces. Then the\r\nconsciousness of her money entered. It was evident that the old man had\r\nmentioned his millions in the way of a hint to him of what he might\r\nreasonably expect if he would turn and be his son-in-law. Beaton did not\r\nput it to himself in those words; and in fact his cogitations were not in\r\nwords at all. It was the play of cognitions, of sensations, formlessly\r\ntending to the effect which can only be very clumsily interpreted in\r\nlanguage. But when he got to this point in them, Beaton rose to\r\nmagnanimity and in a flash of dramatic reverie disposed of a part of\r\nDryfoos\'s riches in placing his father and mother, and his brothers and\r\nsisters, beyond all pecuniary anxiety forever. He had no shame, no\r\nscruple in this, for he had been a pensioner upon others ever since a\r\nSyracusan amateur of the arts had detected his talent and given him the\r\nmoney to go and study abroad. Beaton had always considered the money a\r\nloan, to be repaid out of his future success; but he now never dreamt of\r\nrepaying it; as the man was rich, he had even a contempt for the notion\r\nof repaying him; but this did not prevent him from feeling very keenly\r\nthe hardships he put his father to in borrowing money from him, though he\r\nnever repaid his father, either. In this reverie he saw himself\r\nsacrificed in marriage with Christine Dryfoos, in a kind of admiring\r\nself-pity, and he was melted by the spectacle of the dignity with which\r\nhe suffered all the lifelong trials ensuing from his unselfishness. The\r\nfancy that Alma Leighton came bitterly to regret him, contributed to\r\nsoothe and flatter him, and he was not sure that Margaret. Vance did not\r\nsuffer a like loss in him.\r\n\r\nThere had been times when, as he believed, that beautiful girl\'s high\r\nthoughts had tended toward him; there had been looks, gestures, even\r\nwords, that had this effect to him, or that seemed to have had it; and\r\nBeaton saw that he might easily construe Mrs. Horn\'s confidential appeal\r\nto him to get Margaret interested in art again as something by no means\r\nnecessarily offensive, even though it had been made to him as to a master\r\nof illusion. If Mrs. Horn had to choose between him and the life of good\r\nworks to which her niece was visibly abandoning herself, Beaton could not\r\ndoubt which she would choose; the only question was how real the danger\r\nof a life of good works was.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of these two girls, one so charming and the other so\r\ndivine, it became indefinitely difficult to renounce them for Christine\r\nDryfoos, with her sultry temper and her earthbound ideals. Life had been\r\nso flattering to Beaton hitherto that he could not believe them both\r\nfinally indifferent; and if they were not indifferent, perhaps he did not\r\nwish either of them to be very definite. What he really longed for was\r\ntheir sympathy; for a man who is able to walk round quite ruthlessly on\r\nthe feelings of others often has very tender feelings of his own, easily\r\nlacerated, and eagerly responsive to the caresses of compassion. In this\r\nframe Beaton determined to go that afternoon, though it was not Mrs.\r\nHorn\'s day, and call upon her in the hope of possibly seeing Miss Vance\r\nalone. As he continued in it, he took this for a sign and actually went.\r\nIt did not fall out at once as he wished, but he got Mrs. Horn to talking\r\nagain about her niece, and Mrs. Horn again regretted that nothing could\r\nbe done by the fine arts to reclaim Margaret from good works.\r\n\r\n"Is she at home? Will you let me see her?" asked Beacon, with something\r\nof the scientific interest of a physician inquiring for a patient whose\r\nsymptoms have been rehearsed to him. He had not asked for her before.\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," said Mrs. Horn, and she went herself to call Margaret,\r\nand she did not return with her. The girl entered with the gentle grace\r\npeculiar to her; and Beaton, bent as he was on his own consolation, could\r\nnot help being struck with the spiritual exaltation of her look. At sight\r\nof her, the vague hope he had never quite relinquished, that they might\r\nbe something more than aesthetic friends, died in his heart. She wore\r\nblack, as she often did; but in spite of its fashion her dress received a\r\nnun-like effect from the pensive absence of her face. "Decidedly,"\r\nthought Beaton, "she is far gone in good works."\r\n\r\nBut he rose, all the same, to meet her on the old level, and he began at\r\nonce to talk to her of the subject he had been discussing with her aunt.\r\nHe said frankly that they both felt she had unjustifiably turned her back\r\nupon possibilities which she ought not to neglect.\r\n\r\n"You know very well," she answered, "that I couldn\'t do anything in that\r\nway worth the time I should waste on it. Don\'t talk of it, please. I\r\nsuppose my aunt has been asking you to say this, but it\'s no use. I\'m\r\nsorry it\'s no use, she wishes it so much; but I\'m not sorry otherwise.\r\nYou can find the pleasure at least of doing good work in it; but I\r\ncouldn\'t find anything in it but a barren amusement. Mr. Wetmore is\r\nright; for me, it\'s like enjoying an opera, or a ball."\r\n\r\n"That\'s one of Wetmore\'s phrases. He\'d sacrifice anything to them."\r\n\r\nShe put aside the whole subject with a look. "You were not at Mr.\r\nDryfoos\'s the other day. Have you seen them, any of them, lately?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been there for some time, no," said Beaton, evasively. But he\r\nthought if he was to get on to anything, he had better be candid. "Mr.\r\nDryfoos was at my studio this morning. He\'s got a queer notion. He wants\r\nme to paint his son\'s portrait."\r\n\r\nShe started. "And will you--"\r\n\r\n"No, I couldn\'t do such a thing. It isn\'t in my way. I told him so. His\r\nson had a beautiful face an antique profile; a sort of early Christian\r\ntype; but I\'m too much of a pagan for that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Yes," Beaton continued, not quite liking her assent after he had invited\r\nit. He had his pride in being a pagan, a Greek, but it failed him in her\r\npresence, now; and he wished that she had protested he was none. "He was\r\na singular creature; a kind of survival; an exile in our time and place.\r\nI don\'t know: we don\'t quite expect a saint to be rustic; but with all\r\nhis goodness Conrad Dryfoos was a country person. If he were not dying\r\nfor a cause you could imagine him milking." Beaton intended a contempt\r\nthat came from the bitterness of having himself once milked the family\r\ncow.\r\n\r\nHis contempt did not reach Miss Vance. "He died for a cause," she said.\r\n"The holiest."\r\n\r\n"Of labor?"\r\n\r\n"Of peace. He was there to persuade the strikers to be quiet and go\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been quite sure," said Beaton. "But in any case he had no\r\nbusiness there. The police were on hand to do the persuading."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you talk so!" cried the girl. "It\'s shocking! Oh, I know\r\nit\'s the way people talk, and the worst is that in the sight of the world\r\nit\'s the right way. But the blessing on the peacemakers is not for the\r\npolicemen with their clubs."\r\n\r\nBeaton saw that she was nervous; he made his reflection that she was\r\naltogether too far gone in good works for the fine arts to reach her; he\r\nbegan to think how he could turn her primitive Christianity to the\r\naccount of his modern heathenism. He had no deeper design than to get\r\nflattered back into his own favor far enough to find courage for some\r\nsort of decisive step. In his heart he was trying to will whether he\r\nshould or should not go back to Dryfoos\'s house. It could not be from the\r\ncaprice that had formerly taken him; it must be from a definite purpose;\r\nagain he realized this. "Of course; you are right," he said. "I wish I\r\ncould have answered that old man differently. I fancy he was bound up in\r\nhis son, though he quarrelled with him, and crossed him. But I couldn\'t\r\ndo it; it wasn\'t possible." He said to himself that if she said "No,"\r\nnow, he would be ruled by her agreement with him; and if she disagreed\r\nwith him, he would be ruled still by the chance, and would go no more to\r\nthe Dryfooses\'. He found himself embarrassed to the point of blushing\r\nwhen she said nothing, and left him, as it were, on his own hands. "I\r\nshould like to have given him that comfort; I fancy he hasn\'t much\r\ncomfort in life; but there seems no comfort in me."\r\n\r\nHe dropped his head in a fit attitude for compassion; but she poured no\r\npity upon it.\r\n\r\n"There is no comfort for us in ourselves," she said. "It\'s hard to get\r\noutside; but there\'s only despair within. When we think we have done\r\nsomething for others, by some great effort, we find it\'s all for our own\r\nvanity."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Beaton. "If I could paint pictures for righteousness\' sake, I\r\nshould have been glad to do Conrad Dryfoos for his father. I felt sorry\r\nfor him. Did the rest seem very much broken up? You saw them all?"\r\n\r\n"Not all. Miss Dryfoos was ill, her sister said. It\'s hard to tell how\r\nmuch people suffer. His mother seemed bewildered. The younger sister is a\r\nsimple creature; she looks like him; I think she must have something of\r\nhis spirit."\r\n\r\n"Not much spirit of any kind, I imagine," said Beaton. "But she\'s amiably\r\nmaterial. Did they say Miss Dryfoos was seriously ill?"\r\n\r\n"No. I supposed she might be prostrated by her brother\'s death."\r\n\r\n"Does she seem that kind of person to you, Miss Vance?" asked Beaton.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I haven\'t tried to see so much of them as I might, the\r\npast winter. I was not sure about her when I met her; I\'ve never seen\r\nmuch of people, except in my own set, and the--very poor. I have been\r\nafraid I didn\'t understand her. She may have a kind of pride that would\r\nnot let her do herself justice."\r\n\r\nBeaton felt the unconscious dislike in the endeavor of praise. "Then she\r\nseems to you like a person whose life--its trials, its chances--would\r\nmake more of than she is now?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say that. I can\'t judge of her at all; but where we don\'t know,\r\ndon\'t you think we ought to imagine the best?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Beaton. "I didn\'t know but what I once said of them might\r\nhave prejudiced you against them. I have accused myself of it." He always\r\ntook a tone of conscientiousness, of self-censure, in talking with Miss\r\nVance; he could not help it.\r\n\r\n"Oh no. And I never allowed myself to form any judgment of her. She is\r\nvery pretty, don\'t you think, in a kind of way?"\r\n\r\n"Very."\r\n\r\n"She has a beautiful brunette coloring: that floury white and the\r\ndelicate pink in it. Her eyes are beautiful."\r\n\r\n"She\'s graceful, too," said Beaton. "I\'ve tried her in color; but I\r\ndidn\'t make it out."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve wondered sometimes," said Miss Vance, "whether that elusive quality\r\nyou find in some people you try to paint doesn\'t characterize them all\r\nthrough. Miss Dryfoos might be ever so much finer and better than we\r\nwould find out in the society way that seems the only way."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps," said Beaton, gloomily; and he went away profoundly discouraged\r\nby this last analysis of Christine\'s character. The angelic\r\nimperviousness of Miss Vance to properties of which his own wickedness\r\nwas so keenly aware in Christine might have made him laugh, if it had not\r\nbeen such a serious affair with him. As it was, he smiled to think how\r\nvery differently Alma Leighton would have judged her from Miss Vance\'s\r\npremises. He liked that clear vision of Alma\'s even when it pierced his\r\nown disguises. Yes, that was the light he had let die out, and it might\r\nhave shone upon his path through life. Beaton never felt so poignantly\r\nthe disadvantage of having on any given occasion been wanting to his own\r\ninterests through his self-love as in this. He had no one to blame but\r\nhimself for what had happened, but he blamed Alma for what might happen\r\nin the future because she shut out the way of retrieval and return. When\r\nhe thought of the attitude she had taken toward him, it seemed\r\nincredible, and he was always longing to give her a final chance to\r\nreverse her final judgment. It appeared to him that the time had come for\r\nthis now, if ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nWhile we are still young we feel a kind of pride, a sort of fierce\r\npleasure, in any important experience, such as we have read of or heard\r\nof in the lives of others, no matter how painful. It was this pride, this\r\npleasure, which Beaton now felt in realizing that the toils of fate were\r\nabout him, that between him and a future of which Christine Dryfoos must\r\nbe the genius there was nothing but the will, the mood, the fancy of a\r\ngirl who had not given him the hope that either could ever again be in\r\nhis favor. He had nothing to trust to, in fact, but his knowledge that he\r\nhad once had them all; she did not deny that; but neither did she conceal\r\nthat he had flung away his power over them, and she had told him that\r\nthey never could be his again. A man knows that he can love and wholly\r\ncease to love, not once merely, but several times; he recognizes the fact\r\nin regard to himself, both theoretically and practically; but in regard\r\nto women he cherishes the superstition of the romances that love is once\r\nfor all, and forever. It was because Beaton would not believe that Alma\r\nLeighton, being a woman, could put him out of her heart after suffering\r\nhim to steal into it, that he now hoped anything from her, and she had\r\nbeen so explicit when they last spoke of that affair that he did not hope\r\nmuch. He said to himself that he was going to cast himself on her mercy,\r\nto take whatever chance of life, love, and work there was in her having\r\nthe smallest pity on him. If she would have none, then there was but one\r\nthing he could do: marry Christine and go abroad. He did not see how he\r\ncould bring this alternative to bear upon Alma; even if she knew what he\r\nwould do in case of a final rejection, he had grounds for fearing she\r\nwould not care; but he brought it to bear upon himself, and it nerved him\r\nto a desperate courage. He could hardly wait for evening to come, before\r\nhe went to see her; when it came, it seemed to have come too soon. He had\r\nwrought himself thoroughly into the conviction that he was in earnest,\r\nand that everything depended upon her answer to him, but it was not till\r\nhe found himself in her presence, and alone with her, that he realized\r\nthe truth of his conviction. Then the influences of her grace, her\r\ngayety, her arch beauty, above all, her good sense, penetrated his soul\r\nlike a subtle intoxication, and he said to himself that he was right; he\r\ncould not live without her; these attributes of hers were what he needed\r\nto win him, to cheer him, to charm him, to guide him. He longed so to\r\nplease her, to ingratiate himself with her, that he attempted to be light\r\nlike her in his talk, but lapsed into abysmal absences and gloomy\r\nrecesses of introspection.\r\n\r\n"What are you laughing at?" he asked, suddenly starting from one of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n"What you are thinking of."\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing to laugh at. Do you know what I\'m thinking of?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell, if it\'s dreadful."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I dare say you wouldn\'t think it\'s dreadful," he said, with\r\nbitterness. "It\'s simply the case of a man who has made a fool of himself\r\nand sees no help of retrieval in himself."\r\n\r\n"Can any one else help a man unmake a fool of himself?" she asked, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Yes. In a case like this."\r\n\r\n"Dear me! This is very interesting."\r\n\r\nShe did not ask him what the case was, but he was launched now, and he\r\npressed on. "I am the man who has made a fool of himself--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"And you can help me out if you will. Alma, I wish you could see me as I\r\nreally am."\r\n\r\n"Do you, Mr. Beacon? Perhaps I do."\r\n\r\n"No; you don\'t. You formulated me in a certain way, and you won\'t allow\r\nfor the change that takes place in every one. You have changed; why\r\nshouldn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Has this to do with your having made a fool of yourself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Then I don\'t see how you have changed."\r\n\r\nShe laughed, and he too, ruefully. "You\'re cruel. Not but what I deserve\r\nyour mockery. But the change was not from the capacity of making a fool\r\nof myself. I suppose I shall always do that more or less--unless you help\r\nme. Alma! Why can\'t you have a little compassion? You know that I must\r\nalways love you."\r\n\r\n"Nothing makes me doubt that like your saying it, Mr. Beaton. But now\r\nyou\'ve broken your word--"\r\n\r\n"You are to blame for that. You knew I couldn\'t keep it!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m to blame. I was wrong to let you come--after that. And so I\r\nforgive you for speaking to me in that way again. But it\'s perfectly\r\nimpossible and perfectly useless for me to hear you any more on that\r\nsubject; and so-good-bye!"\r\n\r\nShe rose, and he perforce with her. "And do you mean it?" he asked.\r\n"Forever?"\r\n\r\n"Forever. This is truly the last time I will ever see you if I can help\r\nit. Oh, I feel sorry enough for you!" she said, with a glance at his\r\nface. "I do believe you are in earnest. But it\'s too late now. Don\'t let\r\nus talk about it any more! But we shall, if we meet, and so,--"\r\n\r\n"And so good-bye! Well, I\'ve nothing more to say, and I might as well say\r\nthat. I think you\'ve been very good to me. It seems to me as if you had\r\nbeen--shall I say it?--trying to give me a chance. Is that so?" She\r\ndropped her eyes and did not answer.\r\n\r\n"You found it was no use! Well, I thank you for trying. It\'s curious to\r\nthink that I once had your trust, your regard, and now I haven\'t it. You\r\ndon\'t mind my remembering that I had? It\'ll be some little consolation,\r\nand I believe it will be some help. I know I can\'t retrieve the past now.\r\nIt is too late. It seems too preposterous--perfectly lurid--that I could\r\nhave been going to tell you what a tangle I\'d got myself in, and to ask\r\nyou to help untangle me. I must choke in the infernal coil, but I\'d like\r\nto have the sweetness of your pity in it--whatever it is."\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand. "Whatever it is, I do pity you; I said that."\r\n\r\n"Thank you." He kissed the hand she gave him and went.\r\n\r\nHe had gone on some such terms before; was it now for the last time? She\r\nbelieved it was. She felt in herself a satiety, a fatigue, in which his\r\ngood looks, his invented airs and poses, his real trouble, were all alike\r\nrepulsive. She did not acquit herself of the wrong of having let him\r\nthink she might yet have liked him as she once did; but she had been\r\nhonestly willing to see whether she could. It had mystified her to find\r\nthat when they first met in New York, after their summer in St. Barnaby,\r\nshe cared nothing for him; she had expected to punish him for his\r\nneglect, and then fancy him as before, but she did not. More and more she\r\nsaw him selfish and mean, weak-willed, narrow-minded, and hard-hearted;\r\nand aimless, with all his talent. She admired his talent in proportion as\r\nshe learned more of artists, and perceived how uncommon it was; but she\r\nsaid to herself that if she were going to devote herself to art, she\r\nwould do it at first-hand. She was perfectly serene and happy in her\r\nfinal rejection of Beaton; he had worn out not only her fancy, but her\r\nsympathy, too.\r\n\r\nThis was what her mother would not believe when Alma reported the\r\ninterview to her; she would not believe it was the last time they should\r\nmeet; death itself can hardly convince us that it is the last time of\r\nanything, of everything between ourselves and the dead. "Well, Alma," she\r\nsaid, "I hope you\'ll never regret what you\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure I shall not regret it. If ever I\'m low-spirited about\r\nanything, I\'ll think of giving Mr. Beaton his freedom, and that will\r\ncheer me up."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t you expect to get married? Do you intend to be an old maid?"\r\ndemanded her mother, in the bonds of the superstition women have so long\r\nbeen under to the effect that every woman must wish to get married, if\r\nfor no other purpose than to avoid being an old maid.\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma," said Alma, "I intend being a young one for a few years\r\nyet; and then I\'ll see. If I meet the right person, all well and good; if\r\nnot, not. But I shall pick and choose, as a man does; I won\'t merely be\r\npicked and chosen."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t help yourself; you may be very glad if you are picked and\r\nchosen."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense, mamma! A girl can get any man she wants, if she goes\r\nabout it the right way. And when my \'fated fairy prince\' comes along, I\r\nshall just simply make furious love to him and grab him. Of course, I\r\nshall make a decent pretence of talking in my sleep. I believe it\'s done\r\nthat way more than half the time. The fated fairy prince wouldn\'t see the\r\nprincess in nine cases out of ten if she didn\'t say something; he would\r\ngo mooning along after the maids of honor."\r\n\r\nMrs. Leighton tried to look unspeakable horror; but she broke down and\r\nlaughed. "Well, you are a strange girl, Alma."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. But one thing I do know, mamma, and that is\r\nthat Prince Beaton isn\'t the F. F. P. for me. How strange you are, mamma!\r\nDon\'t you think it would be perfectly disgusting to accept a person you\r\ndidn\'t care for, and let him go on and love you and marry you? It\'s\r\nsickening."\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, Alma. It\'s only because I know you did care for him\r\nonce--"\r\n\r\n"And now I don\'t. And he didn\'t care for me once, and now he does. And so\r\nwe\'re quits."\r\n\r\n"If I could believe--"\r\n\r\n"You had better brace up and try, mamma; for as Mr. Fulkerson says, it\'s\r\nas sure as guns. From the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he\'s\r\nloathsome to me; and he keeps getting loathsomer. Ugh! Goodnight!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess she\'s given him the grand bounce at last," said Fulkerson\r\nto March in one of their moments of confidence at the office. "That\'s\r\nMad\'s inference from appearances--and disappearances; and some little\r\nhints from Alma Leighton."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that I have any criticisms to offer," said March. "It\r\nmay be bad for Beaton, but it\'s a very good thing for Miss Leighton. Upon\r\nthe whole, I believe I congratulate her."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. I always kind of hoped it would turn out the other\r\nway. You know I always had a sneaking fondness for the fellow."\r\n\r\n"Miss Leighton seems not to have had."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity she hadn\'t. I tell you, March, it ain\'t so easy for a girl\r\nto get married, here in the East, that she can afford to despise any\r\nchance."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that rather a low view of it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a common-sense view. Beaton has the making of a first-rate fellow\r\nin him. He\'s the raw material of a great artist and a good citizen. All\r\nhe wants is somebody to take him in hand and keep him from makin\' an ass\r\nof himself and kickin\' over the traces generally, and ridin\' two or three\r\nhorses bareback at once."\r\n\r\n"It seems a simple problem, though the metaphor is rather complicated,"\r\nsaid March. "But talk to Miss Leighton about it. I haven\'t given Beaton\r\nthe grand bounce."\r\n\r\nHe began to turn over the manuscripts on his table, and Fulkerson went\r\naway. But March found himself thinking of the matter from time to time\r\nduring the day, and he spoke to his wife about it when he went home. She\r\nsurprised him by taking Fulkerson\'s view of it.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s a pity she couldn\'t have made up her mind to have him. It\'s\r\nbetter for a woman to be married."\r\n\r\n"I thought Paul only went so far as to say it was well. But what would\r\nbecome of Miss Leighton\'s artistic career if she married?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, her artistic career!" said Mrs. March, with matronly contempt of it.\r\n\r\n"But look here!" cried her husband. "Suppose she doesn\'t like him?"\r\n\r\n"How can a girl of that age tell whether she likes any one or not?"\r\n\r\n"It seems to me you were able to tell at that age, Isabel. But let\'s\r\nexamine this thing. (This thing! I believe Fulkerson is characterizing my\r\nwhole parlance, as well as your morals.) Why shouldn\'t we rejoice as much\r\nat a non-marriage as a marriage? When we consider the enormous risks\r\npeople take in linking their lives together, after not half so much\r\nthought as goes to an ordinary horse trade, I think we ought to be glad\r\nwhenever they don\'t do it. I believe that this popular demand for the\r\nmatrimony of others comes from our novel-reading. We get to thinking that\r\nthere is no other happiness or good-fortune in life except marriage; and\r\nit\'s offered in fiction as the highest premium for virtue, courage,\r\nbeauty, learning, and saving human life. We all know it isn\'t. We know\r\nthat in reality marriage is dog cheap, and anybody can have it for the\r\nasking--if he keeps asking enough people. By-and-by some fellow will wake\r\nup and see that a first-class story can be written from the anti-marriage\r\npoint of view; and he\'ll begin with an engaged couple, and devote his\r\nnovel to disengaging them and rendering them separately happy ever after\r\nin the denouement. It will make his everlasting fortune."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you write it, Basil?" she asked. "It\'s a delightful idea. You\r\ncould do it splendidly."\r\n\r\nHe became fascinated with the notion. He developed it in detail; but at\r\nthe end he sighed and said: "With this \'Every Other Week\' work on my\r\nhands, of course I can\'t attempt a novel. But perhaps I sha\'n\'t have it\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nShe was instantly anxious to know what he meant, and the novel and Miss\r\nLeighton\'s affair were both dropped out of their thoughts. "What do you\r\nmean? Has Mr. Fulkerson said anything yet?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. He knows no more about it than I do. Dryfoos hasn\'t spoken,\r\nand we\'re both afraid to ask him. Of course, I couldn\'t ask him."\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s pretty uncomfortable, to be kept hanging by the gills so, as\r\nFulkerson says."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we don\'t know what to do."\r\n\r\nMarch and Fulkerson said the same to each other; and Fulkerson said that\r\nif the old man pulled out, he did not know what would happen. He had no\r\ncapital to carry the thing on, and the very fact that the old man had\r\npulled out would damage it so that it would be hard to get anybody else\r\nto put it. In the mean time Fulkerson was running Conrad\'s office-work,\r\nwhen he ought to be looking after the outside interests of the thing; and\r\nhe could not see the day when he could get married.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which it\'s worse for, March: you or me. I don\'t know, under\r\nthe circumstances, whether it\'s worse to have a family or to want to have\r\none. Of course--of course! We can\'t hurry the old man up. It wouldn\'t be\r\ndecent, and it would be dangerous. We got to wait."\r\n\r\nHe almost decided to draw upon Dryfoos for some money; he did not need\r\nany, but, he said maybe the demand would act as a hint upon him. One day,\r\nabout a week after Alma\'s final rejection of Beaton, Dryfoos came into\r\nMarch\'s office. Fulkerson was out, but the old man seemed not to have\r\ntried to see him.\r\n\r\nHe put his hat on the floor by his chair, after he sat down, and looked\r\nat March awhile with his old eyes, which had the vitreous glitter of old.\r\neyes stimulated to sleeplessness. Then he said, abruptly, "Mr. March, how\r\nwould you like to take this thing off my hands?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand, exactly," March began; but of course he understood\r\nthat Dryfoos was offering to let him have \'Every Other Week\' on some\r\nterms or other, and his heart leaped with hope.\r\n\r\nThe old man knew he understood, and so he did not explain. He said: "I am\r\ngoing to Europe, to take my family there. The doctor thinks it might do\r\nmy wife some good; and I ain\'t very well myself, and my girls both want\r\nto go; and so we\'re goin\'. If you want to take this thing off my hands, I\r\nreckon I can let you have it in \'most any shape you say. You\'re all\r\nsettled here in New York, and I don\'t suppose you want to break up, much,\r\nat your time of life, and I\'ve been thinkin\' whether you wouldn\'t like to\r\ntake the thing."\r\n\r\nThe word, which Dryfoos had now used three times, made March at last\r\nthink of Fulkerson; he had been filled too full of himself to think of\r\nany one else till he had mastered the notion of such wonderful good\r\nfortune as seemed about falling to him. But now he did think of\r\nFulkerson, and with some shame and confusion; for he remembered how, when\r\nDryfoos had last approached him there on the business of his connection\r\nwith \'Every Other Week,\' he had been very haughty with him, and told him\r\nthat he did not know him in this connection. He blushed to find how far\r\nhis thoughts had now run without encountering this obstacle of etiquette.\r\n\r\n"Have you spoken to Mr. Fulkerson?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I hain\'t. It ain\'t a question of management. It\'s a question of\r\nbuying and selling. I offer the thing to you first. I reckon Fulkerson\r\ncouldn\'t get on very well without you."\r\n\r\nMarch saw the real difference in the two cases, and he was glad to see\r\nit, because he could act more decisively if not hampered by an obligation\r\nto consistency. "I am gratified, of course, Mr. Dryfoos; extremely\r\ngratified; and it\'s no use pretending that I shouldn\'t be happy beyond\r\nbounds to get possession of \'Every Other Week.\' But I don\'t feel quite\r\nfree to talk about it apart from Mr. Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right!" said the old man, with quick offence.\r\n\r\nMarch hastened to say: "I feel bound to Mr. Fulkerson in every way. He\r\ngot me to come here, and I couldn\'t even seem to act without him."\r\n\r\nHe put it questioningly, and the old man answered:\r\n\r\n"Yes, I can see that. When \'ll he be in? I can wait." But he looked\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n"Very soon, now," said March, looking at his watch. "He was only to be\r\ngone a moment," and while he went on to talk with Dryfoos, he wondered\r\nwhy the old man should have come first to speak with him, and whether it\r\nwas from some obscure wish to make him reparation for displeasures in the\r\npast, or from a distrust or dislike of Fulkerson. Whichever light he\r\nlooked at it in, it was flattering.\r\n\r\n"Do you think of going abroad soon?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"What? Yes--I don\'t know--I reckon. We got our passage engaged. It\'s on\r\none of them French boats. We\'re goin\' to Paris."\r\n\r\n"Oh! That will be interesting to the young ladies."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I reckon we\'re goin\' for them. \'Tain\'t likely my wife and me would\r\nwant to pull up stakes at our age," said the old man, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"But you may find it do you good, Mr. Dryfoos," said March, with a\r\nkindness that was real, mixed as it was with the selfish interest he now\r\nhad in the intended voyage.\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe, maybe," sighed the old man; and he dropped his head\r\nforward. "It don\'t make a great deal of difference what we do or we don\'t\r\ndo, for the few years left."\r\n\r\n"I hope Mrs. Dryfoos is as well as usual," said March, finding the ground\r\ndelicate and difficult.\r\n\r\n"Middlin\', middlin\'," said the old man. "My daughter Christine, she ain\'t\r\nvery well."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said March. It was quite impossible for him to affect a more\r\nexplicit interest in the fact. He and Dryfoos sat silent for a few\r\nmoments, and he was vainly casting about in his thought for something\r\nelse which would tide them over the interval till Fulkerson came, when he\r\nheard his step on the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Hello, hello!" he said. "Meeting of the clans!" It was always a meeting\r\nof the clans, with Fulkerson, or a field day, or an extra session, or a\r\nregular conclave, whenever he saw people of any common interest together.\r\n"Hain\'t seen you here for a good while, Mr. Dryfoos. Did think some of\r\nrunning away with \'Every Other Week\' one while, but couldn\'t seem to work\r\nMarch up to the point."\r\n\r\nHe gave Dryfoos his hand, and pushed aside the papers on the corner of\r\nMarch\'s desk, and sat down there, and went on briskly with the nonsense\r\nhe could always talk while he was waiting for another to develop any\r\nmatter of business; he told March afterward that he scented business in\r\nthe air as soon as he came into the room where he and Dryfoos were\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\nDryfoos seemed determined to leave the word to March, who said, after an\r\ninquiring look at him, "Mr. Dryfoos has been proposing to let us have\r\n\'Every Other Week,\' Fulkerson."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s good; that suits yours truly; March & Fulkerson, publishers\r\nand proprietors, won\'t pretend it don\'t, if the terms are all right."\r\n\r\n"The terms," said the old man, "are whatever you want \'em. I haven\'t got\r\nany more use for the concern--" He gulped, and stopped; they knew what he\r\nwas thinking of, and they looked down in pity. He went on: "I won\'t put\r\nany more money in it; but what I\'ve put in a\'ready can stay; and you can\r\npay me four per cent."\r\n\r\nHe got upon his feet; and March and Fulkerson stood, too.\r\n\r\n"Well, I call that pretty white," said Fulkerson. "It\'s a bargain as far\r\nas I\'m concerned. I suppose you\'ll want to talk it over with your wife,\r\nMarch?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall," said March. "I can see that it\'s a great chance; but I\r\nwant to talk it over with my wife."\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s right," said the old man. "Let me hear from you tomorrow."\r\n\r\nHe went out, and Fulkerson began to dance round the room. He caught March\r\nabout his stalwart girth and tried to make him waltz; the office-boy came\r\nto the door and looked on with approval.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, you idiot!" said March, rooting himself to the carpet.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just throwing the thing into our mouths," said Fulkerson. "The\r\nwedding will be this day week. No cards! Teedle-lumpty-diddle!\r\nTeedle-lumpty-dee! What do you suppose he means by it, March?" he asked,\r\nbringing himself soberly up, of a sudden. "What is his little game? Or is\r\nhe crazy? It don\'t seem like the Dryfoos of my previous acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"I suppose," March suggested, "that he\'s got money enough, so that he\r\ndon\'t care for this--"\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! You\'re a poet! Don\'t you know that the more money that kind of\r\nman has got, the more he cares for money? It\'s some fancy of his--like\r\nhaving Lindau\'s funeral at his house--By Jings, March, I believe you\'re\r\nhis fancy!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, now! Don\'t you be a poet, Fulkerson!"\r\n\r\n"I do! He seemed to take a kind of shine to you from the day you wouldn\'t\r\nturn off old Lindau; he did, indeed. It kind of shook him up. It made him\r\nthink you had something in you. He was deceived by appearances. Look\r\nhere! I\'m going round to see Mrs. March with you, and explain the thing\r\nto her. I know Mrs. March! She wouldn\'t believe you knew what you were\r\ngoing in for. She has a great respect for your mind, but she don\'t think\r\nyou\'ve got any sense. Heigh?"\r\n\r\n"All right," said March, glad of the notion; and it was really a comfort\r\nto have Fulkerson with him to develop all the points; and it was\r\ndelightful to see how clearly and quickly she seized them; it made March\r\nproud of her. She was only angry that they had lost any time in coming to\r\nsubmit so plain a case to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Dryfoos might change his mind in the night, and then everything would\r\nbe lost. They must go to him instantly, and tell him that they accepted;\r\nthey must telegraph him.\r\n\r\n"Might as well send a district messenger; he\'d get there next week," said\r\nFulkerson. "No, no! It\'ll all keep till to-morrow, and be the better for\r\nit. If he\'s got this fancy for March, as I say, he ain\'t agoing to change\r\nit in a single night. People don\'t change their fancies for March in a\r\nlifetime. Heigh?"\r\n\r\nWhen Fulkerson turned up very early at the office next morning, as March\r\ndid, he was less strenuous about Dryfoos\'s fancy for March. It was as if\r\nMiss Woodburn might have blown cold upon that theory, as something unjust\r\nto his own merit, for which she would naturally be more jealous than he.\r\n\r\nMarch told him what he had forgotten to tell him the day before, though\r\nhe had been trying, all through their excited talk, to get it in, that\r\nthe Dryfooses were going abroad.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ho!" cried Fulkerson. "That\'s the milk in the cocoanut, is it? Well,\r\nI thought there must be something."\r\n\r\nBut this fact had not changed Mrs. March at all in her conviction that it\r\nwas Mr. Dryfoos\'s fancy for her husband which had moved him to make him\r\nthis extraordinary offer, and she reminded him that it had first been\r\nmade to him, without regard to Fulkerson. "And perhaps," she went on,\r\n"Mr. Dryfoos has been changed---softened; and doesn\'t find money all in\r\nall any more. He\'s had enough to change him, poor old man!"\r\n\r\n"Does anything from without change us?" her husband mused aloud. "We\'re\r\nbrought up to think so by the novelists, who really have the charge of\r\npeople\'s thinking, nowadays. But I doubt it, especially if the thing\r\noutside is some great event, something cataclysmal, like this tremendous\r\nsorrow of Dryfoos\'s."\r\n\r\n"Then what is it that changes us?" demanded his wife, almost angry with\r\nhim for his heresy.\r\n\r\n"Well, it won\'t do to say, the Holy Spirit indwelling. That would sound\r\nlike cant at this day. But the old fellows that used to say that had some\r\nglimpses of the truth. They knew that it is the still, small voice that\r\nthe soul heeds, not the deafening blasts of doom. I suppose I should have\r\nto say that we didn\'t change at all. We develop. There\'s the making of\r\nseveral characters in each of us; we are each several characters, and\r\nsometimes this character has the lead in us, and sometimes that. From\r\nwhat Fulkerson has told me of Dryfoos, I should say he had always had the\r\npotentiality of better things in him than he has ever been yet; and\r\nperhaps the time has come for the good to have its chance. The growth in\r\none direction has stopped; it\'s begun in another; that\'s all. The man\r\nhasn\'t been changed by his son\'s death; it stunned, it benumbed him; but\r\nit couldn\'t change him. It was an event, like any other, and it had to\r\nhappen as much as his being born. It was forecast from the beginning of\r\ntime, and was as entirely an effect of his coming into the world--"\r\n\r\n"Basil! Basil!" cried his wife. "This is fatalism!"\r\n\r\n"Then you think," he said, "that a sparrow falls to the ground without\r\nthe will of God?" and he laughed provokingly. But he went on more\r\nsoberly: "I don\'t know what it all means Isabel though I believe it means\r\ngood. What did Christ himself say? That if one rose from the dead it\r\nwould not avail. And yet we are always looking for the miraculous! I\r\nbelieve that unhappy old man truly grieves for his son, whom he treated\r\ncruelly without the final intention of cruelty, for he loved him and\r\nwished to be proud of him; but I don\'t think his death has changed him,\r\nany more than the smallest event in the chain of events remotely working\r\nthrough his nature from the beginning. But why do you think he\'s changed\r\nat all? Because he offers to sell me \'Every Other Week\' on easy terms? He\r\nsays himself that he has no further use for the thing; and he knows\r\nperfectly well that he couldn\'t get his money out of it now, without an\r\nenormous shrinkage. He couldn\'t appear at this late day as the owner, and\r\nsell it to anybody but Fulkerson and me for a fifth of what it\'s cost\r\nhim. He can sell it to us for all it\'s cost him; and four per cent. is no\r\nbad interest on his money till we can pay it back. It\'s a good thing for\r\nus; but we have to ask whether Dryfoos has done us the good, or whether\r\nit\'s the blessing of Heaven. If it\'s merely the blessing of Heaven, I\r\ndon\'t propose being grateful for it."\r\n\r\nMarch laughed again, and his wife said, "It\'s disgusting."\r\n\r\n"It\'s business," he assented. "Business is business; but I don\'t say it\r\nisn\'t disgusting. Lindau had a low opinion of it."\r\n\r\n"I think that with all his faults Mr. Dryfoos is a better man than\r\nLindau," she proclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'s certainly able to offer us a better thing in \'Every Other\r\nWeek,\'" said March.\r\n\r\nShe knew he was enamoured of the literary finish of his cynicism, and\r\nthat at heart he was as humbly and truly grateful as she was for the\r\ngood-fortune opening to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nBeaton was at his best when he parted for the last time with Alma\r\nLeighton, for he saw then that what had happened to him was the necessary\r\nconsequence of what he had been, if not what he had done. Afterward he\r\nlost this clear vision; he began to deny the fact; he drew upon his\r\nknowledge of life, and in arguing himself into a different frame of mind\r\nhe alleged the case of different people who had done and been much worse\r\nthings than he, and yet no such disagreeable consequence had befallen\r\nthem. Then he saw that it was all the work of blind chance, and he said\r\nto himself that it was this that made him desperate, and willing to call\r\nevil his good, and to take his own wherever he could find it. There was a\r\ngreat deal that was literary and factitious and tawdry in the mood in\r\nwhich he went to see Christine Dryfoos, the night when the Marches sat\r\ntalking their prospects over; and nothing that was decided in his\r\npurpose. He knew what the drift of his mind was, but he had always\r\npreferred to let chance determine his events, and now since chance had\r\nplayed him such an ill turn with Alma, he left it the whole\r\nresponsibility. Not in terms, but in effect, this was his thought as he\r\nwalked on up-town to pay the first of the visits which Dryfoos had\r\npractically invited him to resume. He had an insolent satisfaction in\r\nhaving delayed it so long; if he was going back he was going back on his\r\nown conditions, and these were to be as hard and humiliating as he could\r\nmake them. But this intention again was inchoate, floating, the stuff of\r\nan intention, rather than intention; an expression of temperament\r\nchiefly.\r\n\r\nHe had been expected before that. Christine had got out of Mela that her\r\nfather had been at Beaton\'s studio; and then she had gone at the old man\r\nand got from him every smallest fact of the interview there. She had\r\nflung back in his teeth the good-will toward herself with which he had\r\ngone to Beaton. She was furious with shame and resentment; she told him\r\nhe had made bad worse, that he had made a fool of himself to no end; she\r\nspared neither his age nor his grief-broken spirit, in which his will\r\ncould not rise against hers. She filled the house with her rage,\r\nscreaming it out upon him; but when her fury was once spent, she began to\r\nhave some hopes from what her father had done. She no longer kept her\r\nbed; every evening she dressed herself in the dress Beaton admired the\r\nmost, and sat up till a certain hour to receive him. She had fixed a day\r\nin her own mind before which, if he came, she would forgive him all he\r\nhad made her suffer: the mortification, the suspense, the despair. Beyond\r\nthis, she had the purpose of making her father go to Europe; she felt\r\nthat she could no longer live in America, with the double disgrace that\r\nhad been put upon her.\r\n\r\nBeaton rang, and while the servant was coming the insolent caprice seized\r\nhim to ask for the young ladies instead of the old man, as he had\r\nsupposed of course he should do. The maid who answered the bell, in the\r\nplace of the reluctant Irishman of other days, had all his hesitation in\r\nadmitting that the young ladies were at home.\r\n\r\nHe found Mela in the drawing-room. At sight of him she looked scared; but\r\nshe seemed to be reassured by his calm. He asked if he was not to have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing Miss Dryfoos, too; and Mela said she reckoned the\r\ngirl had gone up-stairs to tell her. Mela was in black, and Beaton noted\r\nhow well the solid sable became her rich red-blonde beauty; he wondered\r\nwhat the effect would be with Christine.\r\n\r\nBut she, when she appeared, was not in mourning. He fancied that she wore\r\nthe lustrous black silk, with the breadths of white Venetian lace about\r\nthe neck which he had praised, because he praised it. Her cheeks burned\r\nwith a Jacqueminot crimson; what should be white in her face was chalky\r\nwhite. She carried a plumed ostrich fan, black and soft, and after giving\r\nhim her hand, sat down and waved it to and fro slowly, as he remembered\r\nher doing the night they first met. She had no ideas, except such as\r\nrelated intimately to herself, and she had no gabble, like Mela; and she\r\nlet him talk. It was past the day when she promised herself she would\r\nforgive him; but as he talked on she felt all her passion for him revive,\r\nand the conflict of desires, the desire to hate, the desire to love, made\r\na dizzying whirl in her brain. She looked at him, half doubting whether\r\nhe was really there or not. He had never looked so handsome, with his\r\ndreamy eyes floating under his heavy overhanging hair, and his pointed\r\nbrown beard defined against his lustrous shirtfront. His mellowly\r\nmodulated, mysterious voice lulled her; when Mela made an errand out of\r\nthe room, and Beaton crossed to her and sat down by her, she shivered.\r\n\r\n"Are you cold?" he asked, and she felt the cruel mockery and exultant\r\nconsciousness of power in his tone, as perhaps a wild thing feels\r\ncaptivity in the voice of its keeper. But now, she said she would still\r\nforgive him if he asked her.\r\n\r\nMela came back, and the talk fell again to the former level; but Beaton\r\nhad not said anything that really meant what she wished, and she saw that\r\nhe intended to say nothing. Her heart began to burn like a fire in her\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n"You been tellun\' him about our goun\' to Europe?" Mela asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said Christine, briefly, and looking at the fan spread out on her\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nBeaton asked when; and then he rose, and said if it was so soon, he\r\nsupposed he should not see them again, unless he saw them in Paris; he\r\nmight very likely run over during the summer. He said to himself that he\r\nhad given it a fair trial with Christine, and he could not make it go.\r\n\r\nChristine rose, with a kind of gasp; and mechanically followed him to the\r\ndoor of the drawing-room; Mela came, too; and while he was putting on his\r\novercoat, she gurgled and bubbled in good-humor with all the world.\r\nChristine stood looking at him, and thinking how still handsomer he was\r\nin his overcoat; and that fire burned fiercer in her. She felt him more\r\nthan life to her and knew him lost, and the frenzy, that makes a woman\r\nkill the man she loves, or fling vitriol to destroy the beauty she cannot\r\nhave for all hers, possessed her lawless soul. He gave his hand to Mela,\r\nand said, in his wind-harp stop, "Good-bye."\r\n\r\nAs he put out his hand to Christine, she pushed it aside with a scream of\r\nrage; she flashed at him, and with both hands made a feline pass at the\r\nface he bent toward her. He sprang back, and after an instant of\r\nstupefaction he pulled open the door behind him and ran out into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n"Well, Christine Dryfoos!" said Mela, "Sprang at him like a wild-cat!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," Christine shrieked. "I\'ll tear his eyes out!" She flew\r\nup-stairs to her own room, and left the burden of the explanation to\r\nMela, who did it justice.\r\n\r\nBeaton found himself, he did not know how, in his studio, reeking with\r\nperspiration and breathless. He must almost have run. He struck a match\r\nwith a shaking hand, and looked at his face in the glass. He expected to\r\nsee the bleeding marks of her nails on his cheeks, but he could see\r\nnothing. He grovelled inwardly; it was all so low and coarse and vulgar;\r\nit was all so just and apt to his deserts.\r\n\r\nThere was a pistol among the dusty bric-a-brac on the mantel which he had\r\nkept loaded to fire at a cat in the area. He took it and sat looking into\r\nthe muzzle, wishing it might go off by accident and kill him. It slipped\r\nthrough his hand and struck the floor, and there was a report; he sprang\r\ninto the air, feeling that he had been shot. But he found himself still\r\nalive, with only a burning line along his cheek, such as one of\r\nChristine\'s finger-nails might have left.\r\n\r\nHe laughed with cynical recognition of the fact that he had got his\r\npunishment in the right way, and that his case was not to be dignified\r\ninto tragedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe Marches, with Fulkerson, went to see the Dryfooses off on the French\r\nsteamer. There was no longer any business obligation on them to be civil,\r\nand there was greater kindness for that reason in the attention they\r\noffered. \'Every Other Week\' had been made over to the joint ownership of\r\nMarch and Fulkerson, and the details arranged with a hardness on\r\nDryfoos\'s side which certainly left Mrs. March with a sense of his\r\nincomplete regeneration. Yet when she saw him there on the steamer, she\r\npitied him; he looked wearied and bewildered; even his wife, with her\r\ntwitching head, and her prophecies of evil, croaked hoarsely out, while\r\nshe clung to Mrs. March\'s hand where they sat together till the\r\nleave-takers were ordered ashore, was less pathetic. Mela was looking\r\nafter both of them, and trying to cheer them in a joyful excitement. "I\r\ntell \'em it\'s goun\' to add ten years to both their lives," she said. "The\r\nvoyage \'ll do their healths good; and then, we\'re gittun\' away from that\r\nmiser\'ble pack o\' servants that was eatun\' us up, there in New York. I\r\nhate the place!" she said, as if they had already left it. "Yes, Mrs.\r\nMandel\'s goun\', too," she added, following the direction of Mrs. March\'s\r\neyes where they noted Mrs. Mandel, speaking to Christine on the other\r\nside of the cabin. "Her and Christine had a kind of a spat, and she was\r\ngoun\' to leave, but here only the other day, Christine offered to make it\r\nup with her, and now they\'re as thick as thieves. Well, I reckon we\r\ncouldn\'t very well \'a\' got along without her. She\'s about the only one\r\nthat speaks French in this family."\r\n\r\nMrs. March\'s eyes still dwelt upon Christine\'s face; it was full of a\r\nfurtive wildness. She seemed to be keeping a watch to prevent herself\r\nfrom looking as if she were looking for some one. "Do you know," Mrs.\r\nMarch said to her husband as they jingled along homeward in the\r\nChristopher Street bob-tail car, "I thought she was in love with that\r\ndetestable Mr. Beaton of yours at one time; and that he was amusing\r\nhimself with her."\r\n\r\n"I can bear a good deal, Isabel," said March, "but I wish you wouldn\'t\r\nattribute Beaton to me. He\'s the invention of that Mr. Fulkerson of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Well, at any rate, I hope, now, you\'ll both get rid of him, in the\r\nreforms you\'re going to carry out."\r\n\r\nThese reforms were for a greater economy in the management of \'Every\r\nOther Week;\' but in their very nature they could not include the\r\nsuppression of Beaton. He had always shown himself capable and loyal to\r\nthe interests of the magazine, and both the new owners were glad to keep\r\nhim. He was glad to stay, though he made a gruff pretence of\r\nindifference, when they came to look over the new arrangement with him.\r\nIn his heart he knew that he was a fraud; but at least he could say to\r\nhimself with truth that he had not now the shame of taking Dryfoos\'s\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nMarch and Fulkerson retrenched at several points where it had seemed\r\nindispensable to spend, as long as they were not spending their own: that\r\nwas only human. Fulkerson absorbed Conrad\'s department into his, and\r\nMarch found that he could dispense with Kendricks in the place of\r\nassistant which he had lately filled since Fulkerson had decided that\r\nMarch was overworked. They reduced the number of illustrated articles,\r\nand they systematized the payment of contributors strictly according to\r\nthe sales of each number, on their original plan of co-operation: they\r\nhad got to paying rather lavishly for material without reference to the\r\nsales.\r\n\r\nFulkerson took a little time to get married, and went on his wedding\r\njourney out to Niagara, and down the St. Lawrence to Quebec over the line\r\nof travel that the Marches had taken on their wedding journey. He had the\r\npleasure of going from Montreal to Quebec on the same boat on which he\r\nfirst met March.\r\n\r\nThey have continued very good friends, and their wives are almost without\r\nthe rivalry that usually embitters the wives of partners. At first Mrs.\r\nMarch did not like Mrs. Fulkerson\'s speaking of her husband as the Ownah,\r\nand March as the Edito\'; but it appeared that this was only a convenient\r\nmethod of recognizing the predominant quality in each, and was meant\r\nneither to affirm nor to deny anything. Colonel Woodburn offered as his\r\ncontribution to the celebration of the copartnership, which Fulkerson\r\ncould not be prevented from dedicating with a little dinner, the story of\r\nFulkerson\'s magnanimous behavior in regard to Dryfoos at that crucial\r\nmoment when it was a question whether he should give up Dryfoos or give\r\nup March. Fulkerson winced at it; but Mrs. March told her husband that\r\nnow, whatever happened, she should never have any misgivings of Fulkerson\r\nagain; and she asked him if he did not think he ought to apologize to him\r\nfor the doubts with which he had once inspired her. March said that he\r\ndid not think so.\r\n\r\nThe Fulkersons spent the summer at a seaside hotel in easy reach of the\r\ncity; but they returned early to Mrs. Leighton\'s, with whom they are to\r\nboard till spring, when they are going to fit up Fulkerson\'s bachelor\r\napartment for housekeeping. Mrs. March, with her Boston scruple, thinks\r\nit will be odd, living over the \'Every Other Week\' offices; but there\r\nwill be a separate street entrance to the apartment; and besides, in New\r\nYork you may do anything.\r\n\r\nThe future of the Leightons promises no immediate change. Kendricks goes\r\nthere a good deal to see the Fulkersons, and Mrs. Fulkerson says he comes\r\nto see Alma. He has seemed taken with her ever since he first met her at\r\nDryfoos\'s, the day of Lindau\'s funeral, and though Fulkerson objects to\r\ndating a fancy of that kind from an occasion of that kind, he justly\r\nargues with March that there can be no harm in it, and that we are liable\r\nto be struck by lightning any time. In the mean while there is no proof\r\nthat Alma returns Kendricks\'s interest, if he feels any. She has got a\r\nlittle bit of color into the fall exhibition; but the fall exhibition is\r\nnever so good as the spring exhibition. Wetmore is rather sorry she has\r\nsucceeded in this, though he promoted her success. He says her real hope\r\nis in black and white, and it is a pity for her to lose sight of her\r\noriginal aim of drawing for illustration.\r\n\r\nNews has come from Paris of the engagement of Christine Dryfoos. There\r\nthe Dryfooses met with the success denied them in New York; many American\r\nplutocrats must await their apotheosis in Europe, where society has them,\r\nas it were, in a translation. Shortly after their arrival they were\r\ncelebrated in the newspapers as the first millionaire American family of\r\nnatural-gas extraction who had arrived in the capital of civilization;\r\nand at a French watering-place Christine encountered her fate--a nobleman\r\nfull of present debts and of duels in the past. Fulkerson says the old\r\nman can manage the debtor, and Christine can look out for the duellist.\r\n"They say those fellows generally whip their wives. He\'d better not try\r\nit with Christine, I reckon, unless he\'s practised with a panther."\r\n\r\nOne day, shortly after their return to town in the autumn from the brief\r\nsummer outing they permitted themselves, the Marches met Margaret Vance.\r\nAt first they did not know her in the dress of the sisterhood which she\r\nwore; but she smiled joyfully, almost gayly, on seeing them, and though\r\nshe hurried by with the sister who accompanied her, and did not stay to\r\nspeak, they felt that the peace that passeth understanding had looked at\r\nthem from her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, she is at rest, there can\'t be any doubt of that," he said, as he\r\nglanced round at the drifting black robe which followed her free,\r\nnun-like walk.\r\n\r\n"Yes, now she can do all the good she likes," sighed his wife. "I\r\nwonder--I wonder if she ever told his father about her talk with poor\r\nConrad that day he was shot?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I don\'t care. In any event, it would be right. She did\r\nnothing wrong. If she unwittingly sent him to his death, she sent him to\r\ndie for God\'s sake, for man\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes. But still--"\r\n\r\n"Well, we must trust that look of hers."\r\n\r\n\r\nPG EDITOR\'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\n    Affected absence of mind\r\n    Be good, sweet man, and let who will be clever\r\n    Comfort of the critical attitude\r\n    Conscience weakens to the need that isn\'t\r\n    Death is an exile that no remorse and no love can reach\r\n    Death is peace and pardon\r\n    Did not idealize him, but in the highest effect she realized him\r\n    Does any one deserve happiness\r\n    Does anything from without change us?\r\n    Europe, where society has them, as it were, in a translation\r\n    Favorite stock of his go up and go down under the betting\r\n    Hemmed round with this eternal darkness of death\r\n    Indispensable\r\n    Love of justice hurry them into sympathy with violence\r\n    Married for no other purpose than to avoid being an old maid\r\n    Nervous woes of comfortable people\r\n    Novelists, who really have the charge of people\'s thinking\r\n    People that have convictions are difficult\r\n    Rejoice as much at a non-marriage as a marriage\r\n    Respect for your mind, but she don\'t think you\'ve got any sense\r\n    Superstition of the romances that love is once for all\r\n    Superstition that having and shining is the chief good\r\n    To do whatever one likes is finally to do nothing that one likes\r\n    Took the world as she found it, and made the best of it\r\n    What we can be if we must\r\n    When you look it--live it\r\n    Would sacrifice his best friend to a phrase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s A Hazard Of New Fortunes, by William Dean Howells\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A HAZARD OF NEW FORTUNES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 4600.txt or 4600.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/6/0/4600/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
