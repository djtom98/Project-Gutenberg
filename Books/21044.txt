Like a new boy or\r\ngirl at a school, you will be faced with learning the names of a great\r\nmany youngsters, and to an extent, their characters.  However, by the\r\ntime you get half-way through the book you will be familiar enough with\r\nthe principal characters.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are numerous small dramas being acted out as the book\r\nproceeds, but the main one concerns a boat-race between two of the\r\nHouses.  Along the course there is a very tight bend.  The boat on the\r\noutside of the bend is slightly in the lead but will probably lose this\r\ndue to the inside boat having less far to travel to the next straight.\r\n\r\nAt a most crucial moment, when maximum power is being exerted by the cox\r\non the rudder-lines, one of them snaps, and the boat goes out of\r\ncontrol.  The cox shouts the instructions for an emergency stop, and to\r\nback water.  The other boat proceeds to the end of the course.  It can\r\nnow be seen that the rudder-line had been deliberately half cut through,\r\nso that it would snap at that tight bend on the river.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the book people are trying to work out who had done this\r\ndeed.  At one stage we think we know the answer.  We become quite\r\nconvinced we know the answer, in fact.  But we are wrong, and we do not\r\nfind out till almost the end of the book.  And it is to be hoped that at\r\nthat point the promised re-row takes place.\r\n\r\nThere is some confusion with names in respect of Merrison and Morrison,\r\nbut I suspect that to be a printer\'s error.  It is not of great\r\nimportance, since he is (or they are) not front-line characters in the\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe punctuation becomes very difficult in the reporting of the\r\nproceedings of the school parliament, because not only do you have the\r\ncurrent speaker, but interspersed with it are comments by the raconteur\r\nand by the noisier of the boys.  The printed book settled for a\r\nsimplified version here, but we have done our best to give you a\r\nversion that is more according to rule.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nTHE WILLOUGHBY CAPTAINS\r\n\r\nBY TALBOT BAINES REED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE OLD CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nSomething unusual is happening at Willoughby.  The Union Jack floats\r\nproudly over the old ivy-covered tower of the school, the schoolrooms\r\nare deserted, there is a band playing somewhere, a double row of\r\ncarriages is drawn up round the large meadow (familiarly called "The\r\nBig"), old Mrs Gallop, the orange and sherbert woman, is almost beside\r\nherself with business flurry, and boys are going hither and thither,\r\nsome of them in white ducks with favours on their sleeves, and others in\r\ntheir Sunday "tiles," with sisters and cousins and aunts in tow, whose\r\npresence adds greatly to the brightness of the scene.\r\n\r\nAmong these last-named holiday-making young Willoughbites no one parades\r\nmore triumphantly to-day than Master Cusack, of Welch\'s House, by the\r\nside of his father, Captain Cusack, R.N.  Cusack, ever since he came to\r\nWilloughby, has bored friend and foe with endless references to "the\r\ngov., captain in the R.N., you know," and now that he really has a\r\nchance of showing off his parent in the flesh his small head is nearly\r\nturned.  He puffs along like a small steam-tug with a glorious man-of-\r\nwar in tow, and is too anxious to exhibit his prize in "The Big" to do\r\neven the ordinary honours of the place to his relative.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cusack, R.N., the meekest and most amiable of men, resigns\r\nhimself pleasantly to the will of his dutiful conductor, only too\r\npleased to see the boy so happy, and pardonably gratified to know that\r\nhe himself is the special object of that young gentleman\'s jubilation.\r\nHe had come down, hoping for a quiet hour or two to see his boy and\r\ninspect Willoughby, but he finds that, instead, he is to be inspected\r\nhimself, and, though he wouldn\'t thwart the lad for the world, he would\r\njust as soon have dropped in at Willoughby on a rather less public\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nYoung Cusack, as is the manner of small tugs, assumes complete control\r\nof his parent and rattles away incessantly as he conducts him through\r\nthe grounds, past the school, towards the all-attracting "Big."\r\n\r\n"That\'s Welch\'s," he says, pointing to the right wing of the long Tudor\r\nbuilding before them--"that\'s Welch\'s on the right, and Parrett\'s in the\r\nmiddle, and the schoolhouse on the left.  Jolly rooks\' nests in the\r\nschoolhouse elms, only Paddy won\'t let us go after them."\r\n\r\n"Who is Paddy?" inquires the father.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the doctor, you know--Dr Patrick.  You\'ll see him down in `The\r\nBig,\' and his dame, and--"\r\n\r\n"And what\'s written up over the door there?" inquires Captain Cusack,\r\npointing up to the coat-of-arms above the great doorway.\r\n\r\n"Oh, some Latin bosh!  I don\'t know.  I say, we\'d better look sharp,\r\nfather, or they\'ll have started the open hurdles."\r\n\r\n"What are the open hurdles?" mildly inquires the somewhat perplexed\r\ncaptain, who has been at sea so long that he is really not up to all the\r\nmodern phrases.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know, it\'s the sports, and there are two open events, the\r\nhurdles and the mile, and we\'ve got Rawson, of the London Athletic, down\r\nagainst us in both; but I rather back Wyndham.  He made stunning time in\r\nthe March gallops, and he\'s in prime form now."\r\n\r\n"Is Wyndham a Willoughby boy?"\r\n\r\n"Rather.  He\'s our cock, you know, and this will be his last show-up.\r\nHullo! you fellows," he cries, as two other small boys approach at a\r\ntrot; "what\'s on?  Have the hurdles started?  By the way, this is my\r\nfather, you know; he came down."\r\n\r\nThe two small boys, who are arrayed in ducks and running-shoes, shake\r\nhands rather sheepishly with the imposing visitor and look shyly up and\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n"And are you running in any of the races, my men?" says Captain Cusack,\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have hit on a happier topic.  The two are at their ease at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, the junior hundred yards.  I say, Cusack, your gov--your\r\nfather\'s just in time for the final heat.  In the first I had a dead\r\nheat with Watkins, you know," continues he, addressing the captain.\r\n"Watkins was scratch, and I had five yards, and the ruck got ten.  It\r\nwas a beastly shame giving Filbert ten, though--wasn\'t it, Telson?--\r\nafter his running second to me in the March gallops; they ought to have\r\nstuck him where I was.  But I ran him down all the same, and dead-heated\r\nit with Watkins, and Telson here was a good second in his heat."\r\n\r\n"I was sure of a first, but that young ass Wace fouled me," puts in\r\nTelson.\r\n\r\n"And now it\'s dead-even which of us two wins.  We both get five yards on\r\nWatkins, and he\'ll be pumped with the long jump, and none of the others\r\nare hot men, so it\'s pretty well between us two, isn\'t it, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Rather, and I think I back you to do it, Parson, old man," rejoins the\r\ngenerous Telson.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," says Parson, dubiously; "you\'re a better man on the\r\nfinish, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"All depends on how I take off.  Gully\'s such a boshy starter, you know;\r\nalways puts me out.  Why can\'t they let Parrett do it?"\r\n\r\nAnd off they rattle, forgetting all about Cusack and his gallant father,\r\nand evidently convinced in their own minds that the flags and the\r\ncarriages and the rosettes and all the festivities are solely in honour\r\nof the final heat of the junior hundred yards, in which they two are to\r\ntake part.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cusack, with a smile on his face, watches them trot off, and\r\nasks his son, "Who are those two nice young fellows?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a couple of kids--not in our house," replies Master Cusack, by no\r\nmeans cordially.  "Jolly cheek of them talking to you like that,\r\nthough!"\r\n\r\n"Not at all," says the captain.  "I\'d like to see their race, Harry."\r\n\r\nBut Harry has no notion of throwing his father away upon the "junior\r\nhundred yards," and as they are now in "The Big," in the midst of the\r\nfestive assembly there congregated, he is easily able to shirk the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAn important event is evidently just over.  The company has crowded into\r\nthe enclosure, and boys, ladies, gentlemen, masters are all mixed up in\r\none great throng through which it is almost impossible for even so\r\ndexterous a tug as young Cusack to pilot his worthy relative.\r\n\r\nThe band is playing in the pavilion, distant cheers are audible in the\r\ndirection of the tents, a shrill uproar is going on in the corner where\r\nthe junior hundred yards is about to begin, and all around them is such\r\na buzz of talking and laughing that Captain Cusack is fairly bewildered.\r\n\r\nHe would like to be allowed to pay his respects to the Doctor and Mrs\r\nPatrick, and to his boy\'s master, and would very much like to witness\r\nthe exploits of those two redoubtable chums Telson and Parson; but he is\r\nnot his own master, and has to do what he is told.  Young Cusack is\r\nshouting every minute to acquaintances in the crowd that he has got his\r\nfather here.  But every one is so wedged up that the introductions\r\nchiefly consist of a friendly nodding and waving of the hand at the\r\ncrowd indefinitely from the gallant father, who would not for the world\r\nbe anything but gracious to his son\'s friends, but who cannot for the\r\nlife of him tell which of the score of youthful faces darting sidelong\r\nglances in their direction is the particular one he is meant to be\r\nsaluting.  At last in the press they stumble upon one boy at close\r\nquarters, whom Cusack the younger captures forthwith.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Pil, I was looking for you.  Here\'s the--my father, I mean--R.N.,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"How are you, captain?" says the newcomer.  He had heard Captain Cusack\r\nwas coming over, and had mentally rehearsed several times what it seemed\r\nto him would be the most appropriate salutation under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe captain says he is very well, and likes the look of Mr "Pil" (whose\r\nreal name is Pilbury), and looks forward to a little pleasant chat with\r\nhis son\'s friend.  But this hope is doomed to be a disappointment, for\r\nPil is in a hurry.\r\n\r\n"Just going to get the house tubs ready," he says; "I\'ll be back in time\r\nfor the mile."\r\n\r\n"Then is the hurdles over?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" exclaims Pil, in astonishment.  "Why, where have you been?  Of\r\ncourse you know who won?"\r\n\r\n"No," says Cusack, eagerly--"who?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Wyndham!  You never saw such a race!  At the fourth hurdle from\r\nhome Wyndham, Bloomfield, Game, Tipper, and Rawson were the only ones\r\nleft in.  Game and Tipper muffed the jump, and it was left to the other\r\nthree.  Bloomfield had cut out grandly.  He was a yard or two ahead,\r\nthen Wyndham, and the London man lying out, ten yards behind.  He had\r\nbeen going pretty easily, but he lammed it on for the next hurdle, and\r\npulled up close.  The three went over almost even, and then Bloomfield\r\nwas out of it.  My eye, Cusack! you should have seen the finish after\r\nthat!  The London fellow fancied he was going to win in a canter, but\r\nold Wyndham stuck to him like a leech, and after the last fence ran him\r\nclean down--the finest thing you ever saw--and won by a yard.  Wasn\'t it\r\nprime?  Ta, ta!  I\'m off now; see you again at the mile;" and off he\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nThe glorious victory of Willoughby at the hurdles has evidently been as\r\nmuch of a surprise as it has been a triumph, and everyone is full of\r\nhope now that the result of the "mile" may be equally satisfactory.  In\r\nthe midst of all the excitement and enthusiasm it suddenly occurs to the\r\nbusiness-like Master Cusack that he had better secure a good position\r\nfor the great race without delay, and accordingly he pilots his father\r\nout of the crush, and makes for a spot near the winning-post, where the\r\ncrowd at the cords has a few gaps; and here, by a little unscrupulous\r\nshoving, he contrives to wedge himself in, with his father close behind,\r\nat about the very best spot on the course, with a full view of the last\r\ntwo hundred yards, and only a few feet from the finish.\r\n\r\nIt is half an hour before the race is due, and, by way of beguiling the\r\ntime, Cusack shouts to one and another of his acquaintances opposite,\r\nand introduces his father to the crowd generally.  The course has not\r\nyet been cleared, so there is plenty of variety as the stream of\r\npassers-by drifts along.  Among the last, looking about anxiously for a\r\nplace to stand and watch the big race, are Telson and Parson, arm-in-\r\narm.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cusack hails them cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Well, who won, my boys? who won?"\r\n\r\nThe dejected countenances of the two heroes is answer enough.\r\n\r\n"Watkins won," says Parson, speaking in a subdued voice.  "The fact is,\r\nmy shoe-lace came undone just when I was putting it on at the end."\r\n\r\n"And the swindle is," puts in Telson, "that just as I was spurting for\r\nthe last twenty yards Watkins took my water.  I could have fouled him,\r\nyou know, but I didn\'t care to."\r\n\r\n"Fact is," says Parson, insinuating himself under the cords, greatly to\r\nthe indignation of some other small boys near, "it\'s a chowse letting\r\nWatkins enter for the juniors.  I\'m certain he\'s not under thirteen--is\r\nhe, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of him!" says Telson, who has also artfully squeezed himself\r\ninto the front rank hard by; "besides, he\'s a Limpet, and Limpets have\r\nno right to run as juniors."\r\n\r\n"What is a Limpet?" asks Captain Cusack of his son.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what else you call him," says young Cusack, rather\r\nsurlily, for he is very wroth at the way Telson has sneaked himself into\r\na rather better position than his own; "he\'s--he\'s a Limpet, you know."\r\n\r\n"Limpets," says a gentleman near, "are the boys in the middle school."\r\n\r\n"Rather a peculiar name," suggests the captain.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it means an inhabitant of Limbo, the Willoughby name for the\r\nmiddle school, because the boys there are supposed to be too old to have\r\nto fag, and too young to be allowed to have fags."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" laughs Captain Cusack, "a capital name;" and he and the\r\ngentleman get up a conversation about their own school days which\r\nbeguiles the time till the bell sounds for the great race of the day.\r\n\r\nThe starting-point is a little below where our friends are standing, and\r\nthe race is just three times round the course and a few yards at the end\r\nup to the winning-post.  Only four runners are starting, three of whom\r\nhave already distinguished themselves in the hurdle-race.  Wyndham, the\r\nschool captain, is that tall, handsome fellow with the red stripe in\r\nfront of his jersey, who occupies the inside "berth" on the starting-\r\nline.  Next to him is Ashley; also wearing the school stripe; and\r\nbetween Ashley and the other schoolboy, Bloomfield, is Rawson, the\r\ndreaded Londoner, a practised athlete, whose whiskered face contrasts\r\nstrangely with the smooth, youthful countenances of his competitors.\r\n\r\n"Ashley\'s to cut out the running for Willoughby this time," says Telson,\r\n"and he\'ll do it too; he\'s fresh."\r\n\r\nSo he is.  At the signal to start he rushes off as if the race was a\r\nquarter of a mile instead of a mile, and the Londoner, perplexed by his\r\ntactics, starts hard also, intending to keep him in hand.  Bloomfield\r\nand Wyndham, one on each side of the track, began rather more easily,\r\nand during the first lap allow themselves to drop twelve or fifteen\r\nyards behind.  The Londoner quickly takes in the situation, but\r\nevidently doesn\'t quite know whether to keep up to Ashley or lie up like\r\nthe others.  If he does the latter, the chances are the fresh man may\r\nget ahead beyond catching, and possibly win the race; and if he does the\r\nformer--well, has he the wind to hold out when the other two begin to\r\n"put it on"?  He thinks he has, so he keeps close up to Ashley.\r\n\r\nThe cheers, of course, all round the field are tremendous, and nowhere\r\nmore exciting than where Telson and Parson are located.  As the runners\r\npass them at the end of the first lap the excitement of these youths\r\nbreaks forth into terrific shouts.\r\n\r\n"Well run, Ashley; keep it up!  He\'s blowing!  Put it on there, Wyndham;\r\nnow\'s your time, Bloomfield!"  And before the cries have left their lips\r\nthe procession has passed, and the second lap has begun.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the second lap Ashley shows signs of flagging, and\r\nBloomfield is quickening his pace.\r\n\r\n"Huzza!" yells Parson; "Bloomfield\'s going to take it up now.  Jolly\r\nwell-planned cut-out, eh, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" shrieks Telson.  "Here they come!  Whiskers is ahead.  Now,\r\nWilloughby--well run indeed!  Lam it on, Bloomfield, you\'re gaining.\r\nKeep it up, Ashley.  Now, Wyndham; now!"\r\n\r\nAshley drops gradually to the rear, and before the final lap is half\r\nover has retired from the race, covered with glory for his useful piece\r\nof work.  But anxious eyes are turned to the other three.  The Londoner\r\nholds his own, and Bloomfield\'s rush up seems to have come to nothing.\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile from home an ominous silence drops upon the\r\ncrowd, and for a few moments Willoughby is too disheartened to cheer.\r\nThen at last there rises a single wild cheer somewhere.  What is it?\r\nThe positions are still the same, and-- No!  _Both_ Wyndham and\r\nBloomfield are gaining; and as the discovery is made there goes up such\r\na shout that the rooks in the elms start away from their nests in a\r\npanic.\r\n\r\nNever was seen such a gallant spurt in that old meadow.  Foot by foot\r\nthe two Willoughby boys pull up and lessen the hateful distance which\r\ndivides them from the leader.  He of course sees his danger, and answers\r\nspurt for spurt.  For a few yards he neither gains nor loses, then,\r\njoyful sight, he loses!\r\n\r\n"Look at them now!" cries Telson, as they approach--"look at them both.\r\nThey\'re both going to win!  Ah, well run, Willoughby--splendidly run;\r\nyou\'re going like mad--keep it up!  Huzzah! level.  Keep it up!\r\nWyndham\'s ahead; so\'s Bloomfield.  Both ahead!  Well run both.  Keep it\r\nup now.  Hurrah!"\r\n\r\nAmid such shouts the race ends.  Wyndham first, Bloomfield a yard\r\nbehind, and the Londoner, dead beat, a yard behind Bloomfield.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder if the old school goes mad as it swarms over the cords and\r\ndashes towards the winner?  Telson actually forgets Parson, Cusack\r\ndeserts even his own father in the jubilation of the moment, each\r\nstriving to get within cheering distance of the heroes of the day as\r\nthey are carried shoulder-high round the ground amid the shouts and\r\napplause of the whole multitude.\r\n\r\nSo ended, in a victory unparalleled in its glorious annals, the May Day\r\nraces of 19-- at Willoughby; and there was not a fellow in the school,\r\nwhether athlete or not, whose bosom did not glow with pride at the\r\nresult.  That the school would not disgrace herself everyone had been\r\nperfectly certain, for was not Willoughby one of the crack athletic\r\nschools of the country, boasting of an endless succession of fine\r\nrunners, and rowers, and cricketers?  But to score thus off a picked\r\nLondon athlete, beating him in two events, and in one of them doubly\r\nbeating him, was a triumph only a very few had dared to anticipate, and\r\neven they were considerably astonished to find their prophecy come true.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the person least excited by the entire day\'s events was the hero\r\nof the day himself.  Wyndham, the old captain, as he now was--for this\r\nwas his last appearance at the old school--was not the sort of fellow to\r\nget his head turned by anything if he could help it.  He hated scenes of\r\nany sort, and therefore took a specially long time over his bath, which\r\nhis fag had prepared for him with the most lavish care.  Boys waylaid\r\nhis door and the schoolhouse gate for a full hour ready to cheer him\r\nwhen he came out; but he knew better than to gratify them and finally\r\nthey went off and lionised Bloomfield instead, who bore his laurels with\r\nrather less indifference.\r\n\r\nThe old captain, however, could not wholly elude the honours destined\r\nfor him.  Dinner in the big hall that afternoon was crowded to\r\noverflowing.  And when at its close the doctor stood up and, in\r\naccordance with immemorial custom, proposed the health of the old\r\ncaptain, who, he said, was not only head classic, but _facile princeps_\r\nin all the manly sports for which Willoughby was famed, you would have\r\nthought the old roof was coming down with the applause.  Poor Wyndham\r\nwould fain have shirked his duty, had he been allowed to do it.  But\r\nWilloughby would as soon have given up a week of the summer holiday as\r\nhave gone without the captain\'s speech.\r\n\r\nAs he rose to his feet deafening cries of "Well run, sir; well run!"\r\ndrowned any effort he could have made at speaking; and he had to stand\r\ntill, by dint of sheer threats of violence, the monitors had reduced the\r\ncompany to order.  Then he said, cheers interrupting him at every third\r\nword, "I\'m much obliged to the doctor for speaking so kindly about me.\r\nYou fellows know the old school will get on very well after I\'ve gone.\r\n(No! no!)  Willoughby always does get on, and any one who says, `No!\r\nno!\' ought to know better."\r\n\r\nThe applause at this point was overpowering; and the few guilty ones\r\ntried hard, by joining in it, to cover their shame.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had a jolly time here, and am proud of being a Willoughby captain.\r\nI shouldn\'t be a bit proud if I didn\'t think it was the finest school\r\ngoing.  And the reason it\'s the finest school is because the fellows\r\nthink first of the school and next of themselves.  As long as they do\r\nthat Willoughby will be what she is now.  Thank you, doctor, and you,\r\nfellows."\r\n\r\nThese were the last words of the old captain.  He left Willoughby next\r\nday, and few of the boys knew what they had lost till he had gone.\r\n\r\nHow he was missed, and how these parting words of his came often to ring\r\nin the ears of the old school during the months that were to follow,\r\nthis story will show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nFOUR HOURS IN A FAG\'S LIFE.\r\n\r\nWilloughby wore its ordinary work-a-day look on the morning following\r\nthe eventful May races.  And yet any one who had seen the old school\r\njust then would have admitted that a more picturesque place could hardly\r\nhave been found.  It was one of those lovely early summer days when\r\neverything looks beautiful, and when only schoolboys can have the heart\r\nto lie in bed.  The fresh scent of the sea came up with the morning air\r\nacross the cliff-bound uplands; and far away, from headland to headland\r\nof Craydle Bay, the waters glowed and sparkled in the sunlight.  Inland,\r\ntoo, along by the river, the woods were musical with newly-awakened\r\nbirds, and the downs waved softly with early hay.  And towering above\r\nall, amid its stately elms, and clad from end to end with ivy, stood the\r\nold school itself, glowing in morning brightness, as it had stood for\r\ntwo centuries past, and as those who know and love it hope it may yet\r\nstand for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nBut though any one else could hardly have failed to be impressed with\r\nthe loveliness of such a morning in such a spot, on Master Frederick\r\nParson, head monitor\'s fag of Parrett\'s House, as he kicked the\r\nbedclothes pensively off his person, and looked at the watch under his\r\npillow, the beauties of nature were completely lost.  Parson was in a\r\nbad frame of mind that morning.  Everything seemed against him.  He\'d\r\nbeen beaten in the junior hundred yards yesterday, so had Telson.  Just\r\ntheir luck.  They\'d run in every race for the last two years, and never\r\nwon so much as a shilling penknife yet.  More than that; just because he\r\nhad walked across the quadrangle to see Telson home after supper last\r\nnight (Telson belonged to the SchoolHouse) he had been caught by a\r\nmonitor and given eight French verbs to write out for being out-of-\r\ndoors, after lock-up.  What harm, Parson would like to know, was there\r\nin seeing a friend across the quad?  Coates, the monitor, probably had\r\nno friend--he didn\'t deserve to have one--or he wouldn\'t have been down\r\non Parson for a thing like that.\r\n\r\nThen, further than that, he (Parson) had not looked at his Caesar, and\r\nWarton had promised to report him to the doctor next time he showed up\r\nwithout preparation.  Bother Warton! bother the doctor! bother Caesar!\r\nwhat did they all want to conspire together for against a wretched\r\njunior\'s peace?  He\'d have to cram up the Caesar from Telson\'s crib\r\nsomehow, only the nuisance was Bloomfield had fixed on this particular\r\nmorning for a turn on the river with Game, and Parson would of course\r\nhave to steer for them.  Just his luck again!  He didn\'t mind steering\r\nfor Bloomfield, of course, and if he must fag he\'d as soon fag for him\r\nas anybody, especially now that he would be captain of the eleven and of\r\nthe boats; but how, Parson wanted to know, was he to do his Caesar and\r\nhis French verbs, and steer Bloomfield and Game up the river at one and\r\nthe same time?  He couldn\'t take the books in the boat.\r\n\r\nWell, he supposed he\'d have to get reported; and probably "Paddy" would\r\ngive it him on the hands.  He was always getting it on the hands, far\r\noftener than Telson, who was Riddell\'s fag, and never had to go and\r\nsteer boats up the river.  In fact, Riddell, he knew, looked over\r\nTelson\'s lessons for him--catch Bloomfield doing as much for Parson!\r\n\r\nAll these considerations tended greatly to impair the temper of Master\r\nParson this beautiful morning.  But the worst grievance of all was that\r\nhe had to get up that moment and call Bloomfield, or else he\'d get a\r\nlicking.  That would be worse any day than getting it on the hands from\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\nSo he kicked off the clothes surlily, and put one foot out of bed.  But\r\nthe other was a long time following.  For Parson was fagged.  He\'d\r\ndreamt all night of that wretched hundred yards, and wasn\'t a bit\r\nrefreshed; and if he had been refreshed, he\'d got those eight French\r\nverbs and the Caesar on his mind, and he could have done them\r\ncomfortably in bed.  But--\r\n\r\nA sudden glance at the watch in his hand cut short all further\r\nmeditation.  Parson is out of his bed and into his flannels in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, and scuttling down the passage to his senior\'s room\r\nas if the avenger of blood was at his heels.\r\n\r\nBloomfield, if truth must be told, is as disinclined to get up as his\r\nfag has been; and Parson has almost to use personal violence before he\r\ncan create an impression on his lord and master.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the time?" demands the senior.\r\n\r\n"Six--that is, a second or two past," replies Parson.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you call me punctually?" asks Bloomfield, digging his nose\r\ncomfortably into the pillow.  "What do you mean by a second or two?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s only seven past," says Parson, in an injured tone.\r\n\r\n"Very well; go and see if Game\'s up."\r\n\r\nParson skulks off to rouse Game, knowing perfectly well that Bloomfield\r\nwill be sound asleep again before he is out of the door, which turns out\r\nto be the case.  After super-human efforts to extract from Game an\r\nassurance that he\'s getting up that moment, and Parson needn\'t wait, the\r\nluckless fag returns to find his master snoring like one of the seven\r\nsleepers.  The same process has to be repeated.  Shouts and shakes, and\r\nan occasional sly pinch, have no effect.  Parson is tempted to leave his\r\ngraceless lord to his fate, and betake himself to his French verbs; but\r\na dim surmise as to the consequences prevents him.  At last he braces\r\nhimself up for one desperate effort.  With a mighty tug he snatches the\r\nclothes off the bed, and, dragging with all his might at the arm of the\r\nobstinate hero, yells out, "I say, Bloomfield, it\'s half-past six, and\r\nyou wanted to be up at six.  Get up!"\r\n\r\nThe effect of these combined efforts is that Bloomfield sits up in bed,\r\nrubbing his eyes, and demands, "Half-past six!  Why didn\'t you call me\r\nat six, you young cad, eh?"\r\n\r\n"So I did."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell crams.  If you\'d called me at six I should have been up,\r\nshouldn\'t I?" exclaimed Bloomfield.  "I tell you I did call you,"\r\nretorts the fag.\r\n\r\n"Look here," says Bloomfield, becoming alarmingly wide-awake, "I don\'t\r\nwant any of your cheek.  Go and see if Game\'s up, and then see if the\r\nboat\'s ready.  The tub-pair, mind; look sharp!"\r\n\r\n"Please, Bloomfield," says Parson, meekly, "do you mind if I get Parks\r\nto cox you?  I\'ve not looked at my Caesar yet, and I\'ve got eight French\r\nverbs to do besides for Coates."\r\n\r\n"Do you hear me?  Go and see if Game\'s up," replies Bloomfield.  "If you\r\nchoose not to do your work overnight, and get impositions for breaking\r\nrules into the bargain, it\'s not my lookout, is it?"\r\n\r\n"But I only went--" begins the unfortunate Parson.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll went you with the flat of a bat if you don\'t cut," shouts\r\nBloomfield.  Whereat his fag vanishes.\r\n\r\nGame, of course, is fast asleep, but on him Parson has no notion of\r\nbestowing the pains he had devoted to Bloomfield.  Finding the sleeper\r\ndeaf to all his calls, he adopts the simple expedient of dipping the end\r\nof a towel in water and laying it neatly across the victim\'s face,\r\nshouting in his ear at the same time, "Game, I say, Bloomfield\'s waiting\r\nfor you down at the boats."  Having delivered himself of which, he\r\nretreats rather hastily, and only just in time.\r\n\r\nThe row up the river that morning was rather pleasant than otherwise.\r\nWhen once they were awake the morning had its effect on the spirits of\r\nall three boys.  Even Parson, sitting lazily in the stern, listening to\r\nthe Sixth Form gossip of the two rowers, forgot about his Caesar and\r\nFrench verbs, and felt rather glad he had turned out after all.\r\n\r\nThe chief object of the present expedition was not pleasure by any means\r\nas far as Bloomfield and Game were concerned.  It was one of a series of\r\ntraining practices in anticipation of the school regatta, which was to\r\ncome off on the second of June, in which the rival four-oars of the\r\nthree houses were to compete for the championship of the river.  The\r\nsecond of June was far enough ahead at present, but an old hand like\r\nBloomfield knew well that the time was all too short to lick his crew\r\ninto shape.  Parrett\'s boat, by all ordinary calculation, ought to win,\r\nfor they had a specially good lot of men this year; and now Wyndham had\r\nleft, the schoolhouse boat would be quite an orphan.  Bloomfield himself\r\nwas far away the best oar left in Willoughby, and if he could only get\r\nGame to work off a little of his extra fat, and bully Tipper into\r\nreaching better forward, and break Ashley of his trick of feathering\r\nunder water, he had a crew at his back which it would be hard indeed to\r\nbeat.  This morning he was taking Game in hand, and that substantial\r\nathlete was beginning to find out that "working off one\'s extra fat" in\r\na tub-pair on a warm summer morning is not all sport.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if Tipper and Ashley will show, up," said Bloomfield, who was\r\nrowing bow for the sake of keeping a better watch on his pupil.  "They\r\npromised they would.  Ashley, you know--(do keep it up, Game, you\'re\r\nsurely not blowed yet)--Ashley\'s about as much too light as you are too\r\nfat--(try a little burst round the corner now; keep us well out, young\r\n\'un)--but if he\'ll only keep his blade square till he\'s out of the\r\nwater--(there you go again!  Of course you\'re hot; that\'s what I brought\r\nyou out for.  How do you suppose you\'re to boil down to the proper\r\nweight unless you do perspire a bit?)--he\'ll make a very decent bow.\r\nAh, there are Porter and Fairbairn in the schoolhouse tub--(you needn\'t\r\nstop rowing, Game; keep it up, man; show them how you can spurt).  I\r\nnever thought they\'d try Porter in their boat.  They might as well try\r\nRiddell.  Just shows how hard-up they must be for men.  How are you?" he\r\ncried, as the schoolhouse tub went clumsily past, both rowers looking\r\ndecidedly nervous under the critical eye of the captain of Parrett\'s.\r\n\r\nPoor Game, who had been kept hard at it for nearly a mile, now fairly\r\nstruck, and declared he couldn\'t keep it up any longer, and as he had\r\nreally done a very good spell of work, Bloomfield consented to land at\r\nthe Willows and bathe; after which he and Game would run back, and young\r\nParson might scull home the tub.\r\n\r\nWhich delightful plan Master Parson by no means jumped at.  He had\r\ncalculated on getting at least a quarter of an hour for his Caesar\r\nbefore morning chapel if they returned as they had come.  But now, if he\r\nwas expected to lug that great heavy boat back by himself, not only\r\nwould he not get that, but the chances were he would get locked out for\r\nchapel altogether, and it would be no excuse that he had had to act as\r\ngalley-slave for Bloomfield or anybody else.\r\n\r\n"Look alive!" cries Bloomfield from the bank, where he is already\r\nstripped for his header.  "And, by the way, on your way up go round to\r\nChalker\'s and tell him only to stick up one set of cricket nets in our\r\ncourt; don\'t forget, now.  Be quick; you\'ve not too much time before\r\nchapel."\r\n\r\nSaying which, he takes a running dive from the bank and leaves the\r\nluckless Parson to boil over inwardly as he digs his sculls spitefully\r\ninto the water and begins his homeward journey.\r\n\r\nWas life worth living at this rate?  If he didn\'t tell Chalker about the\r\nnets that imbecile old groundsman would be certain to stick up half a\r\ndozen sets, and there\'d be no end of a row.  That was 7:30 striking now,\r\nand he had to be in the chapel at five minutes to eight, and Chalker\'s\r\nhut was a long five minutes from the boat-house.  And then those eight\r\nFrench verbs and that Caesar--\r\n\r\nIt was no use thinking about them, and Parson lashed out with his\r\nsculls, caring little if that hulking tub went to the bottom.  He\'d\r\nrather like it, in fact, for he wanted a swim.  He hadn\'t even had time\r\nto tub that morning, and it was certain there\'d be no time now till\r\ngoodness knew when--not till after second school, and then probably he\'d\r\nbe spending a pleasant half-hour in the doctor\'s study.\r\n\r\nAt this point he became aware of another boat making down on him, manned\r\nby three juniors, who were making up in noise and splashing what they\r\nlacked in style and oarsmanship.\r\n\r\nParson knew them yards away.  They were rowdies of Welch\'s house, and he\r\ngroaned inwardly at the prospect before him.  The boy steering was our\r\nold acquaintance Pilbury, and as his boat approached he shouted out\r\ncheerily, "Hullo, there, Parson! mind your eye!  We\'ll race you in--give\r\nyou ten yards and bump you in twenty!  Pull away, you fellows!  One,\r\ntwo, three, gun!  Off you go!  Oh, well rowed, my boat!  Now you\'ve got\r\nhim!  Wire in, now!  Smash him up! scrunch him into the bank!  Hooroo!\r\ntwo to one on us!  Lay on to it, you fellows; he can\'t go straight!  Six\r\nmore strokes and you\'re into him!  One, two, three--ha, ha! he\'s funking\r\nit!--four, five--now a good one for the last--six!  Hooroo! bump to us!\r\nWelch\'s for ever!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the hostile boat came full tilt on to the stern of the\r\nParrett\'s tub, and the outraged Parson found himself next moment\r\nsprawling on his back, with the nose of his boat firmly wedged into the\r\nclay bank of the river, while his insulting adversaries sped gaily away\r\ndown stream, making the morning hideous with their shouts and laughter.\r\n\r\nThis little incident, as may be supposed, did not tend to compose the\r\nfluttered spirits of the unhappy Frederick.  To say nothing of the\r\nindignity of being deliberately run down and screwed into the bank by a\r\ncrew of young "Welchers," the loss of time involved in extricating his\r\nboat from the muddy obstacle which held her by the nose, put all chance\r\nof getting in in time to go round to Chalker\'s before chapel out of the\r\nquestion.  Indeed, it looked very like a shut-out from chapel too, and\r\nthat meant no end of a row.\r\n\r\nBy a super-human effort he got his boat clear, and sculled down hard\r\nall, reaching the boat-house at seven minutes to eight.  He had just\r\npresence of mind enough to shout the message for Chalker to the boat-\r\nboy, with a promise of twopence if he delivered it at once; and then\r\nwith a desperate rush he just succeeded in reaching the chapel and\r\nsqueezing himself in at the door as the bell ceased ringing.\r\n\r\nChapel was not, under the circumstances, a very edifying service to\r\nParson that morning.  His frame of mind was not devotional, and his\r\nfeelings of bottled-up wrath at what was past, and dejected anticipation\r\nof what was to come, left between them no room for interest in or\r\nmeaning for the words in which his schoolfellows were joining.  The only\r\nsatisfaction morning prayers brought to him was that, for ten minutes at\r\nleast, no one could harry him; and that at least was something to be\r\ngrateful for.\r\n\r\nMorning chapel at Willoughby was supposed to be at 7:15, and was at 7:15\r\nall the months of the year except May, June, and July, when, in\r\nconsideration of the early-morning rowing and bathing, it was postponed\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour--a concession made up for by the sacrifice\r\nof the usual half-hour\'s interval between breakfast and first lesson.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was all against Parson, who, if the half-hour had been\r\nstill available, could at least have skimmed through his Caesar, and\r\nperhaps have begged a friend to help him with the French verbs, and\r\npossibly even have had it out with Pilbury for his morning\'s diversion.\r\nAs it was, there was no opportunity for the performance of any one of\r\nthese duties, and at the sound of the pitiless bell he slunk into first\r\nlesson, feeling himself a doomed man.\r\n\r\nHis one hope was Telson.  Telson sat next him in class, and, he knew\r\nwell, would help him if he could.\r\n\r\n"Telson," he groaned, directly he found himself beside his faithful\r\nally, "I\'ve not looked at it!"\r\n\r\nTelson whistled.  "There\'ll be a row," he muttered, consolingly; "it\'s a\r\njolly hard bit."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you got the crib?"\r\n\r\nTelson looked uncomfortable.  "Riddell caught me with it and made me\r\ngive it up."\r\n\r\n"What on earth business has Riddell with your cribs, I\'d like to know?"\r\nexclaimed Parson, indignant, not at all on the question of morality, but\r\nbecause the last straw on which he had relied for scrambling through his\r\nCaesar had failed him.\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t take it, but he advised me to give it up."\r\n\r\n"And you were fool enough to give in to him?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he made out it wasn\'t honourable to use cribs," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"Grandmother!" snarled Parson.  "Why, Telson, I didn\'t think you\'d have\r\nbeen such a soft!"\r\n\r\n"No more did I, but somehow--oh!  I\'m awfully sorry, old man; I\'ll try\r\nand get it back."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t much matter," said Parson, resignedly.  "I\'m in for it hot to-\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll prompt you all I can," said the repentant Telson.\r\n\r\n"Thanks; I\'d do the same to you if I could," replied Parson.\r\n\r\n"It is a long lane that has no turning," as the proverb says, and\r\nParson, after all, was destined to enjoy one brief glimpse of the smiles\r\nof fortune that day.  The first boy put up to translate stumbled over a\r\nsomewhat intricate point of syntax.  Now Mr Warton, the master--as the\r\nmanner of many masters is--was writing a little book on Latin Syntax,\r\nand this particular passage happened to be a superb example of a certain\r\nstyle of construction which till this moment had escaped his notice.\r\nDelighted with the discovery, he launched out into a short lecture on\r\nthe subject generally, citing all the examples he had already got in his\r\nbook, and comparing them with other forms of construction to be found\r\nscattered through the entire range of Latin classical literature.\r\n\r\nHow Parson and Telson enjoyed that lecture!  They listened to it with\r\nrapt attention with hearts full of gratitude and faces full of sympathy.\r\nThey did not understand a word of it, but a chapter out of "Midshipman\r\nEasy" could not have delighted them more; and when they saw that the\r\nclock had slowly worked round from nine to ten they would not have\r\ninterrupted it for the world.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Mr Warton, taking out his watch, "I see time\'s up.  We\'ve\r\nhad more Syntax than Caesar to-day.  Never mind, it\'s a point worth\r\nremarking, and sure to be useful as you get on in Latin.  The class is\r\ndismissed."\r\n\r\nLittle he knew the joy his words carried to two small hearts in his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n"Jolly good luck that!" said Parson, as he strolled out into the passage\r\narm-in-arm with his friend.  "Now if I can only get those beastly verbs\r\ndone before Coates asks for them!  I say, Telson, do you know the dodge\r\nfor sticking three nibs on one pen and writing three lines all at one\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\n"Tried it once," said Telson, "but it didn\'t pay.  It took longer to\r\nkeep sticking them in when they fell out, and measuring them to write on\r\nthe lines, than to write the thing twice over the ordinary way.  I\'ll\r\nwrite out part, old man."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Telson, you\'re an awful brick.  I suppose Riddell wouldn\'t\r\nthink it wicked of you to write another fellow\'s impot, would he?"\r\n\r\n"I half fancy he would; but I won\'t tell him.  Hullo! though, here comes\r\nCoates."\r\n\r\nA monitor wearing his "mortar-board" approached.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s your imposition, Parson?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry," said Parson, "but it\'s not quite done yet, Coates."\r\n\r\n"How much is done?" demanded Coates.\r\n\r\n"Not any yet," said Parson, with some confusion.  "I was just going to\r\nbegin.  Wasn\'t I, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t do," said Coates; "you were up the river this morning, I saw you.\r\nIf you can go up the river you can do your impositions.  Better come\r\nwith me to the captain."\r\n\r\nComing with a monitor to the captain meant something unpleasant.  The\r\ndiscipline of Willoughby, particularly in outside matters, was left\r\nalmost entirely in the hands of the monitors, who with the captain,\r\ntheir head, were responsible as a body to the head master for the order\r\nof the school.  It was very rarely that a case had to go beyond the\r\nmonitors, whose authority was usually sufficient to enable them to deal\r\nsummarily with all ordinary offenders.\r\n\r\nIt was by no means the first time that Parson, who was reputed by almost\r\nevery one but himself and Telson to be an incorrigible scamp, had been\r\nhaled away to this awful tribunal, and he was half regretting that he\r\nhad not met his fate over the Caesar after all, and so escaped his\r\npresent position, when another monitor appeared down the passage and met\r\nthem.  It was Ashley.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!  Coates," said he, "I wish you\'d come to my study and help me\r\nchoose half a dozen trout-flies, there\'s a good fellow.  I\'ve had a book\r\nup from the town, and I don\'t know which are the best to use."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Coates, "I\'ll be there directly.  I\'m just going to\r\ntake this youngster to the captain."\r\n\r\n"Who is the captain?" said Ashley.  "Wyndham\'s gone, and no one\'s been\r\nnamed yet that I know of.  I suppose it\'s Bloomfield."\r\n\r\n"Eh?  I never thought of that.  No, I expect it\'ll be a schoolhouse\r\nfellow.  Always is, isn\'t it.  Parson, you can go.  Bring me twelve\r\nFrench verbs written out to my study before chapel to-morrow.  Come on,\r\nAshley."\r\n\r\nAnd Parson departed, consoled in spirit, to announce to Telson and the\r\nlower school generally that Willoughby was at present without a captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE VACANT CAPTAINCY.\r\n\r\nWho was to be the new captain of Willoughby?  This was a question it had\r\noccurred to only a very few to ask until Wyndham had finally quitted the\r\nschool.  Fellows had grown so used to the old order of things, which had\r\ncontinued now for two years, that the possibility of their bowing to any\r\nother chief than "Old Wynd" had scarcely crossed their minds.  But the\r\nquestion being once asked, it became very interesting indeed.\r\n\r\nThe captains of Willoughby had been by long tradition what is known as\r\n"all-round men."  There was something in the air of the place that\r\nseemed specially favourable to the development of muscle and classical\r\nproficiency at the same time, and the consequence was that the last\r\nthree heads of the school had combined in one person the senior classic\r\nand the captains of the clubs.  Wyndham had been the best of these;\r\nindeed he was as much ahead of his fellows in the classical school as he\r\nwas in the cricket-field and on the river, which was saying not a\r\nlittle.  His predecessors had both also been head boys in classics; and\r\nalthough neither of them actually the best men of their time in\r\nathletics, they had been sufficiently near the best to entitle them to\r\nthe place of honour, which made the Willoughby captain supreme, not only\r\nin school, but out of it.  So that in the memory of the present\r\n"generation"--a school generation being reckoned as five years--the\r\nWilloughby captain had always been cock of the school in every sense in\r\nwhich such a distinction was possible.\r\n\r\nBut now all of a sudden the school woke up to the fact that this\r\ndelightful state of things was not everlasting.  Wyndham had left and\r\nhis mantle had fallen from him in two pieces.\r\n\r\nThe new head classic was Riddell, a comparatively unknown boy in the\r\nschool, who had come there a couple of years ago from a private school,\r\nand about whom the most that was known was that he was physically weak\r\nand timid, rarely taking part in any athletic exercises, having very few\r\nchums, interfering very little with anybody else, and reputed "pi."--as\r\nthe more irreverent among the Willoughbites were wont to stigmatise any\r\nfellow who made a profession of goodness.  Such was the boy on whom,\r\naccording to strict rule, the captaincy of Willoughby would devolve, and\r\nit need hardly be said that the discovery spread consternation wherever\r\nit travelled.\r\n\r\nAmong the seniors the idea was hardly taken seriously.\r\n\r\n"The doctor would never be so ridiculous," said Ashley to Coates, as\r\nthey talked the matter over in the study of the former.  "We might as\r\nwell shut up the school."\r\n\r\n"The worst of it is, I don\'t see how he can help it," replied Coates.\r\n\r\n"Help it!  Of course he can help it if he likes.  There\'s no written law\r\nthat head classics are to be captains, if they can\'t hold a bat or run a\r\nhundred yards, is there?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose there is.  But who else is there?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Bloomfield, of course.  He\'s just the fellow for it, and the\r\nfellows all look up to him."\r\n\r\n"But Bloomfield\'s low down in the sixth," said Coates.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to do with it?  Felton was a muff at rowing, but he was\r\nmade captain of the boats all the same while he was cock of the school."\r\n\r\nAt this point another monitor entered.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Tipper," said Ashley, "what do you think Coates here is saying?  He\r\nsays Riddell is to be the new captain."\r\n\r\nTipper burst into a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n"That would be a joke!  Think of Riddell stroking the school eight at\r\nHenley, eh! or kicking off for us against Rockshire!  I suppose Coates\r\nthinks because Riddell\'s a schoolhouse boy he\'s bound to be the man.\r\nNever fear.  You\'ll see Parrett\'s come to the front at last, my boy!"\r\n\r\n"Why, are _you_ to be the new captain?" asked Coates, with a slight\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\nTipper was not pleased with this little piece of sarcasm.  He was a good\r\ncricketer and a fine runner, but in school everybody knew him to be as\r\npoor a scholar as a fellow could be to be in the sixth at all.\r\n\r\n"I dare say even I would be as good as any schoolhouse fellow you could\r\npick out," said he.  "But if you want to know, Bloomfield\'s the man."\r\n\r\n"Just what I was saying," said Ashley.  "But Coates says he\'s not far\r\nenough up in the school."\r\n\r\n"All bosh," said Tipper.  "What difference does it make if a fellow\'s\r\nfirst or twentieth in the school, as long as he\'s cock of everything\r\noutside!  I don\'t see how the doctor can hesitate a moment between the\r\ntwo."\r\n\r\nThis was the conclusion come to at almost all the conclaves which met\r\ntogether during the day to discuss the burning question.  It was the\r\nconclusion moreover to which Bloomfield himself came as he talked the\r\nmatter over with a few of his friends after third school.\r\n\r\n"You see," said he, "it\'s not that I care about the thing for its own\r\nsake.  It would be a precious grind, I know, to have to be responsible\r\nfor everything that goes on, and to have to lick all the kids that want\r\na hiding.  But for all that, I\'d sooner do it than let the school run\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"What I hope," said some one, "is that even if Paddy doesn\'t see it\r\nhimself, Riddell will, and will have the sense to back out of it.  I\r\nfancy he wouldn\'t be sorry."\r\n\r\n"Not he," said Bloomfield.  "I heard him say once he pitied Wyndham all\r\nthe bother he had, especially when he was wanting to stew for the\r\nexams."\r\n\r\n"Has any one seen Riddell lately?" asked Game.  "It wouldn\'t be a bad\r\nthing for some of us to see him, and put it to him, that the school\r\nwould go to the dogs to a dead certainty if he was captain."\r\n\r\n"Rather a blunt way of putting it," said Porter, laughing.  "I\'d break\r\nit to him rather more gently than that."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know what I mean," replied Game, who was of the downright\r\norder.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Bloomfield, who, despite his protestations, was\r\nevidently not displeased at the notion of his possible honours, "I don\'t\r\nprofess to be much of a swell in school; but--I don\'t know--I fancy I\r\ncould keep order rather better than he could.  The fellows know me."\r\n\r\n"They ought to, if they don\'t," said Wibberly, who was a toady.\r\n\r\n"Fancy Riddell having to lick a junior," said Game.  "Why he\'d faint at\r\nthe very idea."\r\n\r\n"Probably take him off to his study and have a prayer-meeting with\r\nFairbairn and a few more of that lot upon the top of him," said Gilks, a\r\nschoolhouse monitor, and not a nice-looking fellow.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'d sooner get a hiding from old Bloomfield than that," laughed\r\nWibberly.\r\n\r\n"I hope," said Game, "snivelling\'s not going to be the order of the day.\r\nI can\'t stand it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'ve any right to call Riddell a sniveller," said\r\nPorter.  "He may be a muff at sports, but I don\'t fancy he\'s a sneak.\r\nAnd I don\'t see that it\'s against him, either, if he does go in for\r\nbeing what he professes to be."\r\n\r\n"Hear! hear!--quite a sermon from Porter," cried Wibberly.\r\n\r\n"Porter\'s right," said Bloomfield.  "No one says it was against him.\r\nAll I say is that I don\'t expect the fellows will mind him as much as\r\nthey would a fellow who--well, who\'s better known, you know."\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Game, "I know it would seem precious rum being a monitor\r\nunder him."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Bloomfield, "I suppose it will be settled soon.  Meanwhile,\r\nGame, what do you say to another grind in the tub?  You didn\'t half work\r\nthis morning, you beggar."\r\n\r\nGame groaned resignedly, and said "All right;" and hue and cry was\r\nforthwith made for Master Parson\'s services at the helm.\r\n\r\nBut Master Parson, as it happened, was not to be found.  He was neither\r\nin the school nor in his house, and a search through the grounds failed\r\nto unearth him.  He had not been seen since his escape from the\r\nmonitorial fangs after morning school.  The natural thing, of course, on\r\nnot finding him at home in his own quarters, was to look for him in\r\nTelson\'s.  But he was not there, nor, strange to say, was Telson\r\nhimself.  And, what was still more odd, when search came to be made,\r\nBosher, another fag of Parrett\'s house, was missing, and so was Lawkins,\r\nand Pringle, and King, and Wakefield, and one or two others of the same\r\nglorious company.  After a fruitless search, the oarsmen had finally to\r\ngo down to the river without a fag at all, and impound the boat-boy to\r\nsteer for them.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Parson\'s miraculous release from the hands of the law that\r\nmorning, and the reason which led to it, had suggested both to himself\r\nand the faithful Telson that the present was rather a rare opportunity\r\nfor them in the annals of Willoughby.  If there was no captain, there\r\nwas no one to give them a licking (for the worst an ordinary monitor\r\ncould do was to give an imposition), and that being so, it would surely\r\nbe a waste of precious opportunity if they failed to signalise the event\r\nby some little celebration.  And, as it happened, there was a little\r\ncelebration which badly wanted celebrating, and for which only a chance\r\nlike the present could have been considered favourable.  In other words,\r\nthere was a rather long score which the juniors of Parrett\'s were\r\nanxious to settle up with the juniors of Welch\'s.  The debt was of long\r\nstanding, having begun as far back as the middle of the Lent term, when\r\nthe Welchers had played upon some of Parrett\'s with a hose from behind\r\ntheir own door, and culminating in the unprovoked outrage upon the\r\nluckless Parson on the river that very morning.\r\n\r\nNow if there was one thing more than another the young Parretts prided\r\nthemselves in, it was their punctuality in matters of business; and it\r\nhad troubled them sorely that circumstances over which they had no\r\ncontrol (in other words, the fear of Wyndham) should have prevented\r\ntheir settling scores with the Welchers at an earlier date.\r\n\r\nNow, however, an opportunity was come, and, like all honest men, they\r\ndetermined at once to avail themselves of it.\r\n\r\nSo the reason why Bloomfield and Game could find no fags in Parrett\'s\r\nhouse to steer for them was because all the fags of Parrett\'s house,\r\naided by Telson of the schoolhouse, were at that moment paying a\r\nbusiness call at Welch\'s, and having on the whole rather a lively time\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe juniors of Welch\'s were, take them altogether, a rather more rowdy\r\nlot than the juniors of either of the two other houses, or, indeed, than\r\nthose of both the other houses put together.  Somehow Welch\'s was always\r\nthe rowdy house of Willoughby.  The honours of the school, whether in\r\nclass or in field, always seemed to go in any direction but their own,\r\nand as, for five or six years at any rate, they had been unable to claim\r\nany one distinguished Willoughbite as a member of their house, they had\r\ncome to regard themselves somewhat in the light of Ishmaelites.\r\nEverybody\'s hand seemed to be against them, and they therefore didn\'t\r\nsee why their hand shouldn\'t be against every one.\r\n\r\nIt was this feeling which had prompted the assaults of which the\r\nyouthful Parretts had come to complain, and which the Welchers\r\ndistributed as impartially as possible among all their fellow\r\nWilloughbites.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Welch\'s was a bad house.  The fellows there rarely made\r\ncommon cause for any lawful purpose, certainly never for the credit of\r\nthe school.  They were split up into cliques and sets of all sorts, and\r\nthe rising generation among them were left to grow up pretty much as\r\nthey liked.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon in question an entertainment on a small scale was going\r\non in the study jointly occupied by Cusack and Pilbury.  Captain Cusack,\r\nR.N., when he had parted from his dutiful son the night before, had put\r\nfive shillings into his hand as a pleasant memento of his visit; and\r\nMaster Cusack, directly after second school that morning, had skulked\r\ndown into Shellport with his hat-box, and returned in due time with the\r\nsame receptacle packed almost to bursting with dough-nuts, herrings,\r\npeppermint-rock, and sherbet.  With these dainties to recommend him (and\r\nhis possession of them soon got wind) it need hardly be said he became\r\nall of a sudden the most popular youth in Welch\'s.  Fellows who would\r\nhave liked to kick him yesterday now found themselves loving him like\r\ntheir own brother, and the enthusiasm felt for him grew to such a pitch\r\nthat it really seemed as if not only his hat-box, but he himself, was in\r\ndanger.  However, by a little judicious manoeuvring he got safe into his\r\nstudy, and, after a hasty consultation with Pil, decided to ask Curtis,\r\nPhilpot, Morrison, and Morgan, their four most intimate friends, to do\r\nthem the pleasure of joining in a small "blow-out" after third school.\r\nThese four worthies, who, by a most curious coincidence, happened to be\r\nloafing outside Cusack\'s study-door at the very moment when Pilbury\r\nstarted off to find them, had much pleasure in accepting their friend\'s\r\nkind invitation; and the rest, finding themselves out of it, yapped off\r\ndisconsolately, agreeing inwardly that Cusack was the stingiest beast in\r\nall Willoughby.\r\n\r\nIf punctuality is a test of politeness, Curtis, Morgan, Philpot, and\r\nMorrison were that afternoon four of the politest young gentlemen in the\r\nland; for they were all inside Cusack\'s study almost before the bell\r\ndismissing third school had ceased to sound.\r\n\r\n"Jolly brickish of you, old man," said Morrison, complacently regarding\r\nthe unpacking of the magic hat-box.  "I\'ve not seen a dough-nut for\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"I got these at a new shop," said Cusack, trying to rescue some of the\r\nsherbet which had fallen in among the herrings.  "Gormon never has\r\nanything but red-currant jam in his.  These are greengage."\r\n\r\n"How jolly prime!" was the delighted exclamation.\r\n\r\n"Three-halfpence each, though," said Cusack, laying the herrings out in\r\na row on the table.  "I say, I wish we\'d got some forks or something to\r\ntoast these with."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t the slate do to stick them on?" suggested Curtis.\r\n\r\n"Might do, only Grange wrote out a lot of Euclid questions on it, and\r\nI\'ve got to show them to him answered to-morrow, and I\'d get in an awful\r\nrow if it was rubbed out."\r\n\r\n"Rather a bore.  I tell you what, though," exclaimed Philpot, struck\r\nwith the brilliant idea, "there\'s the pan in the chemistry-room they mix\r\nup the sulphur and phosphorus and that sort of thing in.  I\'ll cut and\r\nget that.  It\'s just the thing."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Cusack; "better give it a rub over in case it blows\r\nup, you know."\r\n\r\nPhilpot said "All right," and went, leaving the others to poke up the\r\nfire and get all ready for the reception of the pan.\r\n\r\nHe was a long while about it, certainly, considering that the chemistry-\r\nroom was only just at the end of the passage.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he\'s up to?" said Pilbury, when after about three minutes\r\nhe did not return.\r\n\r\n"I wish he\'d hurry up," said Curtis, whose special attraction was\r\ntowards the dough-nuts, which of course could not come on till after the\r\nherrings.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he\'s larking about with some of the chemicals.  I never\r\nknew such a fellow as he is for smells and blow-ups--"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll blow him up if he\'s not sharp," said Cusack, losing patience and\r\nlooking mournfully at the row of herrings on the table.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s begin without him," said Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"So we would if we had anything to do them on."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see if I can get a fork or two," said Morrison.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, and wake up Philpot while you\'re out."\r\n\r\nMorrison went, and the others kicked their heels impatiently and eyed\r\nthe good things hungrily as they waited.\r\n\r\nCusack tried toasting a herring on one of the small forks, but the heat\r\nof the fire was too great for him to hold his hand at such close\r\nquarters, and he gave it up in disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with everybody this afternoon?  Morrison was away\r\nages and did not return.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother it all!" exclaimed Cusack, whose patience was now fairly\r\nexhausted, "if they don\'t choose to come I\'m hung if they\'ll get\r\nanything now.  I\'ll go and get the pan myself."\r\n\r\nAnd off he went in high dudgeon, leaving his guests in charge of the\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n"If he can\'t get the pan or a toasting-fork," said Curtis,\r\ndisinterestedly, "wouldn\'t it be as well to have the dough-nuts now, and\r\nleave the herrings till supper, eh, Pil?  Pity for them to get stale."\r\n\r\nPilbury said nothing, but broke off a little piece of the peppermint-\r\nrock in a meditative manner, and drummed his feet on the floor.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," he broke out after a good three minutes\' waiting, "that\r\nblessed pan must be jolly heavy.  There\'s three of them sticking to it\r\nnow!"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, I hear him coming," said Curtis, going to the door.  He\r\nstepped out into the passage, Morgan following him.\r\n\r\nPilbury heard a sudden scuffling outside, and a sound of what did not\r\nseem like Welchers\' voices.  He hurried to the door to ascertain the\r\ncause, and as he did so he found himself caught roughly by the arm and\r\nslung violently against the opposite wall, while at the same moment\r\nTelson, Parson, Bosher, and half a dozen Parrett juniors rushed past him\r\ninto the empty study, slamming and locking and barricading the door\r\nbehind them!\r\n\r\nIt was all so quickly done that the luckless Welchers could hardly\r\nbelieve their own senses.  But when they heard the distant voice of\r\nPhilpot shouting that he was locked up in the chemistry-room, and of\r\nMorrison complaining that he couldn\'t get out of his own study, and of\r\nCusack demanding to be released from the lavatory; and when their\r\ncombined assault on the door produced nothing but defiant laughter\r\nmingled with the merry frizzing of the herrings before the fire, they\r\nknew it was no dream but a hideous fact.  They had presence of mind\r\nenough to release their incarcerated comrades and attempt another\r\nassault in force on the door.  But it came to nothing.  In vain they\r\nshouted, threatened, entreated, kicked.  They only received facetious\r\nanswers from inside, which aggravated their misery.\r\n\r\n"Go it, you fellows," shouted one voice, very like Parson\'s, only the\r\nmouth was so full that it was hard to say for certain.  "Jolly good\r\ndough-nuts these; have another, Bosher, you\'ve only had four.  I say,\r\nCusack, where did you catch these prime herrings?  Best I\'ve tasted\r\nsince I came here.  Afraid your slate\'s a little damaged; awfully sorry,\r\nyou ought to keep a toasting-fork--ha! ha!" and a chorus of laughter\r\ngreeted the sally.  Cusack groaned and fumed.\r\n\r\n"You pack of young cads," he howled through the key-hole.  "Come out of\r\nthere, do you hear? you thieves you.  I\'ll warm you, Parson, when I get\r\nhold of you."\r\n\r\n"Just what we\'re doing to the bloaters," cried Telson.  There was a\r\npause.  Then Pilbury cried in tones of feigned warning, "Here comes the\r\ndoctor!  We\'ll see what he says."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t do," shouted Parson from within.  "Won\'t wash, my boy.  Paddy\'s\r\ndown at Shellport.  Any more sherbet left, King?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and tell the captain, that\'s what I\'ll do," said Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t wash again," cried Parson.  "There\'s no captain to tell; I say,\r\nwe\'re leaving something for you, aren\'t we, you fellows?  There\'ll be\r\nall the heads of the herrings and the greengage stones-- jolly blow-out\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\nIt was no use attempting further parley, and the irate Welchers were\r\ncompelled to lurk furiously outside the door while the feast proceeded,\r\nand console themselves with the prospect of paying the enemy out when it\r\nwas all over.\r\n\r\nBut the skill which had accompanied the execution of the raid so far was\r\nnot likely to omit all precautions possible to make good a retreat.\r\nWhile most of the party were making all the noise they could, and\r\nsucceeding with jest and gibe in keeping the attention of those outside,\r\nthe barricade against the door had been quietly removed, and decks\r\ncleared for the sortie.\r\n\r\n"Now then, you fellows," cried Parson to his men, in a voice which those\r\noutside were intended to hear, "make yourselves comfortable.  Here\'s a\r\nstunning lot of peppermint-rock here, pass it round.  Needn\'t go home\r\nfor half an hour at least!"\r\n\r\nThe watchers outside groaned.  There was no help at hand; and for one of\r\nthem to go and seek it was only to increase the odds against them.  The\r\nonly thing was to wait patiently till the enemy did come out.  _Then_ it\r\nwould be their turn.  So they leaned up against the door and waited.\r\nThe revelry within became more and more boisterous, and the chances of a\r\nspeedy retreat more and more remote, when all of a sudden there was a\r\nsharp click and the door swung back hard on its hinges, precipitating\r\nCusack, Pilbury, and Curtis backwards into the room in among the very\r\nfeet of the besieged as, in a compact body, they rushed out.  Morrison,\r\nPhilpot, and Morgan did what little they could to oppose them but they\r\nwere simply run over and swept aside by the wily troop of Parretts, who\r\nwith shouts of derisive triumph gained the staircase with unbroken\r\nranks, and gave their pursuers the parting gratification of watching\r\nthem slide down the banisters one by one, and then lounge off arm-in-\r\narm, sated and jubilant, to their own quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAPTAIN\'S INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nOf course a row was made, or attempted to be made, about the daring\r\nexploit of the fags of Parrett\'s House narrated in the last chapter.\r\nThe matter was duly reported to the head monitor of Welch\'s by the\r\ninjured parties.  But the result only proved how very cunning the\r\noffenders had been in choosing this particular time for the execution of\r\ntheir raid.\r\n\r\nThe head of Welch\'s reported the matter to Bloomfield, as the head of\r\nParrett\'s.  But Bloomfield, who had plenty to do to punish offences\r\ncommitted in his own House, replied that the head of Welch\'s had better\r\nmention it to the captain of the school.  _He_ couldn\'t do anything.\r\nThe head of Welch\'s pointed out that there was no captain of the school\r\nat present.  What was he to do?\r\n\r\nBloomfield suggested that he had better "find out," and there the matter\r\nended.  Wherever the head Welcher took his complaint he got the same\r\nanswer; and it became perfectly clear that as long as Willoughby was\r\nwithout a captain, law and order was at a discount.\r\n\r\nHowever, such a state of things was not destined long to last.  A notice\r\nwent round from the doctor to the monitors the next day asking them to\r\nassemble directly after chapel the following morning in the library.\r\nEvery one knew what this meant; and when later on it was rumoured that\r\nRiddell had gone to the doctor\'s that evening to tea, it became pretty\r\nevident in which direction things were going.\r\n\r\n"Tea at the doctor\'s" was always regarded as rather a terrible ordeal by\r\nthose who occasionally came in for the honour.  Some would infinitely\r\nhave preferred a licking in the library, and others would have felt\r\ndecidedly more comfortable in the dock of a police-court.  Even the\r\noldest boys, whose conduct was exemplary, and whose conscience had as\r\nlittle to make it uneasy in the head master\'s presence as in the\r\npresence of the youngest fag in Willoughby, were always glad when the\r\nceremony was over.\r\n\r\nThe reason of all this was not in the doctor.  Dr Patrick was one of\r\nthe kindest and pleasantest of men.  He could not, perhaps, throw off\r\nthe Dominie altogether on such occasions, but he always tried hard, and\r\nif there had been no one more formidable than "Paddy" to deal with the\r\nmeal would have been comparatively pleasant and unalarming.\r\n\r\nBut there was a Mrs Patrick and a Mrs Patrick\'s sister, and before\r\nthese awful personages the boldest Willoughbite quailed and trembled.\r\nFrom the moment the unhappy guest entered the parlour these two (who\r\nwere always there) fastened their eyes on him and withered him.  They\r\nspoke ceremoniously in the language in which the grand old ladies used\r\nto speak in the old story-books.  If he chanced to speak, they sat erect\r\nin their chairs listening to him with all their ears, looking at him\r\nwith all their eyes, freezing him with all their faintest of smiles.  No\r\none could sit there under their inspection without feeling that every\r\nword and look and gesture was being observed, probably with a view to\r\nrecording it in a letter home; and the idea of being at one\'s ease with\r\nthem in the room was about as preposterous as the idea of sleeping\r\ncomfortably on a wasp\'s nest!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if truth were known, these good females meant well.  They had\r\ntheir own ideas of what boys should be (neither having any of their\r\nown), and fondly imagined that during these occasional ceremonies in the\r\ndoctor\'s parlour they were rendering valuable assistance in the "dear\r\nboy\'s" education by giving him some idea of the manners and charms of\r\npolite society!\r\n\r\nIt was in such genial company that Riddell, the head classic of\r\nWilloughby, was invited to bask for a short time on the evening of the\r\nday before the appointment of the new captain.  He had been there once\r\nbefore when his father and mother had come over to visit him.  And even\r\nwith their presence as a set-off, the evening had been one of the most\r\nawful experiences of his life.  But now that he was to go all alone to\r\npartake of state tea with those two, this shy awkward boy felt about as\r\ncheerful as if he had been walking helplessly into a lion\'s den.\r\n\r\n"Well, Riddell," said the doctor, pleasantly, as after long hesitation\r\nthe guest at last ventured to arrive, "how are you?  My dear, this is\r\nRiddell, whom I believe you have seen before.  Miss Stringer too I think\r\nyou met."\r\n\r\nRiddell coloured deeply and shivered inwardly as he advanced first to\r\none lady then to the other and solemnly shook hands.\r\n\r\n"I trust your parents are in good health, Mr Riddell," said Mrs\r\nPatrick in her most precise tones.\r\n\r\n"Very well indeed, thank you," replied Riddell; "that is," he added,\r\ncorrecting himself suddenly, "my mother is very poorly, thank you."\r\n\r\n"I regret to hear you say so," said Mrs Patrick, transfixing the\r\nunhappy youth with her eyes.  "I trust her indisposition is not of a\r\nserious character."\r\n\r\n"I hope she will, thank you, ma\'am," replied Riddell, who somehow\r\nfancied his hostess had said, or had been going to say, she hoped his\r\nmother would soon recover.\r\n\r\n"Er, I beg your pardon?" said Mrs Patrick, leaning slightly forward and\r\ninclining her head a little on one side.\r\n\r\n"I mean, I beg your pardon," said Riddell, suddenly perceiving his\r\nmistake and losing his head at the same time, "I mean, quite so, thank\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You mean," interposed Miss Stringer at this point, in a voice a note\r\ndeeper than her sister\'s, "that your mother\'s indisposition _is_ of a\r\nserious character?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not at all, I\'m sure," ejaculated the hapless Riddell.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear you say so, very," said Miss Stringer.\r\n\r\n"Very," said Mrs Patrick.\r\n\r\nAt this point Riddell had serious thoughts of bolting altogether, and\r\nmight have done so had not the servant just then created a diversion by\r\nbringing in the kettle.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Riddell," said the doctor, "and make yourself at home.  What\r\nare the prospects for the regatta this year?  Is the schoolhouse boat to\r\nwin?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry I can\'t say," replied Riddell.  "I believe Parrett\'s is the\r\nfavourite."\r\n\r\n"Mr Riddell means Mr Parrett\'s, I presume?" asked Mrs Patrick in her\r\nsweetest tones, looking hard at the speaker, and emphasising the "Mr"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," he said, "I\'m sorry."\r\n\r\n"We shall miss Wyndham," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you," replied Riddell, who at that moment was dodging\r\nvaguely in front of Miss Stringer as she stood solemnly waiting to get\r\npast him to the tea-table.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief when tea was at last ready, and when some other\r\noccupation was possible than that of looking at and being looked at by\r\nthese two ladies.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not very fond of athletics, Riddell?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," answered Riddell, steadily avoiding the eyes of the females.\r\n\r\n"I often think you\'d be better if you took more exercise," said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"Judging by Mr Riddell\'s looks," said Mrs Patrick, "it would certainly\r\nseem as if he hardly did himself justice physically."\r\n\r\nThis enigmatical sentence, which might have been a compliment or might\r\nhave been a rebuke or might have meant neither, Riddell found himself\r\nquite unable to reply to appropriately, and therefore, like a sensible\r\nman, took a drink of tea instead.  It was the first dawn of reviving\r\npresence of mind.\r\n\r\n"Apart from your own health altogether," continued the doctor, "I fancy\r\nyour position with the other boys would be better if you entered rather\r\nmore into their sports."\r\n\r\n"I often feel that, sir," said Riddell, with a touch of seriousness in\r\nhis tones, "and I wish I could do it."\r\n\r\n"I hope that there is no consideration as to health which debars you\r\nfrom this very desirable exercise, Mr Riddell," said Mrs Patrick.  "I\r\nbeg your pardon," said Riddell, who did not quite take it in.  Mrs\r\nPatrick never liked being asked to repeat her speeches.  She flattered\r\nherself they were lucid enough to need no second delivery.  She\r\ntherefore repeated her remark slowly and in precisely the same words and\r\ntone--\r\n\r\n"I hope that there is no consideration as to health which debars you\r\nfrom this very desirable exercise, Mr Riddell?"\r\n\r\nRiddell took half a moment to consider, and then replied, triumphantly,\r\n"I\'m quite well, thank you, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I am pleased to hear that," said Mrs Patrick, rather icily, for this\r\nlast observation had seemed to her a little rude.  "Very," chimed in\r\nMiss Stringer.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a silence, which Riddell devoutly hoped might last\r\ntill it was time to go.  Had the ladies not been there he would have\r\nliked very much to speak to the doctor about school matters, and the\r\ndoctor, but for the same cause, would have wished to talk to his head\r\nboy.  But it was evident this tea-table was not the place for such\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"I hear," said the doctor, after the pause had continued some time,\r\naddressing his sister-in-law, "there is likely to be an election in\r\nShellport before long; Sir Abraham is retiring."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, you surprise me," said Miss Stringer.  "It is unexpected," said\r\nthe doctor, "but it is thought there will be a sharp contest for the\r\nseat."\r\n\r\n"And are you a Liberal or a Conservative, Mr Riddell?" asked Mrs\r\nPatrick, thinking it time that unfortunate youth was again tempted into\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n"A Liberal, ma\'am," replied Riddell.  "Oh! boys are generally\r\nConservatives, are they not?"  She asked this question in a tone as if\r\nshe expected him to try to deceive her in his answer.  However, he\r\nevaded it by replying bashfully, "I hope not."\r\n\r\n"And pray," said Miss Stringer, putting down her cup, and turning full\r\non her victim, "will you favour us with your reasons for such a hope,\r\nMr Riddell?"\r\n\r\nPoor Riddell! he little thought what he had let himself in for.  If\r\nthere was one subject the two ladies were rabid on it was politics.\r\nThey proceeded to pounce upon, devour, and annihilate the unlucky head\r\nclassic without mercy.  They made him contradict himself twice or thrice\r\nin every sentence; they proved to him clearly that he knew nothing at\r\nall of what he was talking about, and generally gave him to understand\r\nthat he was an impertinent, conceited puppy for presuming to have an\r\nopinion of his own on such matters!\r\n\r\nRiddell came out of the ordeal very much as a duck comes out of the\r\nhands of the poulterer.  Luckily, by the time the discussion was over it\r\nwas time for him to go.  He certainly could not have held out much\r\nlonger.  As it was, he was good for nothing after it, and went to bed\r\nearly that night with a very bad headache.\r\n\r\nBefore he left, however, the doctor had accompanied him into the hall,\r\nand said, "There are a few things, Riddell, I want to speak to you\r\nabout.  Will you come to my study a quarter of an hour before morning\r\nchapel to-morrow?"\r\n\r\nHad the invitation been to breakfast in that horrible parlour Riddell\r\nwould flatly have declined it.  As it was he cheerfully accepted it, and\r\nonly wished the doctor had thought of it before, and spared him the\r\nmisery of that evening with the two Willoughby griffins!\r\n\r\nHe could hardly help guessing what it was the doctor had to say to him,\r\nor why it was he had been asked to tea that evening.  And he felt very\r\ndejected as he thought about it.  Like most of the other Willoughbites,\r\nthe idea of a new captain having to be appointed had never occurred to\r\nhim till Wyndham had finally left the school.  And when it did occur,\r\nand when moreover it began to dawn upon him that he himself was the\r\nprobable successor, horror filled his mind.  He couldn\'t do it.  He was\r\nnot cut out for it.  He would sooner leave Willoughby altogether.  The\r\nboys either knew nothing about him, or they laughed at him for his\r\nclumsiness, or they suspected him as a coward, or they despised him as a\r\nprig.  He had wit enough to know what Willoughby thought of him, and\r\nthat being so, how could he ever be its captain?\r\n\r\n"I would much rather you named some one else," said he to the doctor at\r\ntheir interview next morning.  "I know quite well I couldn\'t get on."\r\n\r\n"You have not tried yet," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve not the strength, and the boys don\'t like me," pleaded\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\n"You must make them like you, Riddell," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"How can I?  They will dislike me all the more if I am made captain.  I\r\nhave no influence with them, indeed I have not."\r\n\r\n"How do you know?" said the doctor again.  "Have you tried yet?"\r\n\r\n"I could never do what Wyndham did.  He was such a splendid captain."\r\n\r\n"Why?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I suppose because he was a splendid athlete, and threw himself into all\r\ntheir pursuits, and--and set a good example himself."\r\n\r\n"I think you are partly right and partly wrong," said the doctor.\r\n"There are several fine athletes in Willoughby who would make poor\r\ncaptains; and as for throwing oneself into school pursuits and setting a\r\ngood example, I don\'t think either is beyond your reach."\r\n\r\nRiddell felt very uncomfortable.  He began to feel that after all he\r\nmight be shirking a duty he ought to undertake.  But he made one more\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"There are so many others would do it better, sir, whom the boys look up\r\nto already," he said.  "Bloomfield, for instance, or--"\r\n\r\nThe doctor held up his hand.\r\n\r\n"We will not go into that, Riddell," he said.  "You must not suppose I\r\nand others have not considered the good of Willoughby in this matter.\r\nIt remains for you to consider it also.  As you grow older you will\r\nconstantly find duties confronting you which may be sorely against your\r\ninclination, but which as an honest man you will know are not to be\r\nshirked.  You have a chance of beginning now.  I don\'t pretend to say\r\nyou will find it easy or pleasant work, or that you are likely to\r\nsucceed, at first at any rate, as well as others have done.  But unless\r\nI am mistaken you will not give in on that account.  Of course you will\r\nneed to exert yourself.  You know what boys look for in a captain; it\'s\r\nnot mere muscle, or agility.  Get them by all means if you can; but what\r\nwill be worth far more than these will be sympathy.  If they discover\r\nyou are one with them, and that in your efforts to keep order you have\r\nthe welfare of the school chiefly at heart, they will come out, depend\r\nupon it, and meet you half-way.  It\'s worth trying, Riddell."\r\n\r\nRiddell said nothing, but his face was rather more hopeful as he looked\r\nup at the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Come," said the latter, "there\'s the bell for chapel.  It\'s time we\r\nwent in."\r\n\r\nRiddell entered chapel that morning in a strangely conflicting frame of\r\nmind.  The hope was still in his face, but the misgivings were still in\r\nhis heart, and the whole prospect before him seemed to be a dream.\r\n\r\nAs the slight shy boy walked slowly up the floor to his place among the\r\nSixth, the boys on either side eyed him curiously and eagerly, and a\r\nhalf-titter, half-sneer greeted his appearance.\r\n\r\nSome regarded him with a disfavour which amounted to positive dislike,\r\nothers with disdain and even contempt, and others thought of Wyndham and\r\nwondered what Willoughby was coming to.  Even among the Sixth many an\r\nunfriendly glance was darted at him as he took his seat, and many a\r\nwhispered foreboding passed from boy to boy.  Only a few watched him\r\nwith looks of sympathy, and of these scarcely one was hopeful.\r\n\r\nHappily for Riddell, he could not see half of all this; and when in a\r\nmoment the doctor entered and prayers began, he saw none of it.  For he\r\nwas one of a few at Willoughby to whom this early-morning service was\r\nsomething more than a mere routine, and who felt, especially at times\r\nlike this, that in those beautiful familiar words was to be found the\r\nbest of all preparations for the day\'s duties.\r\n\r\nTelson, as he stood down by the door, with his hands in his pockets,\r\nbeside his friend Parson, was void of all such reflections.  What was\r\nchiefly occupying his lordly mind at that moment was the discovery\r\nsuddenly made, that if Riddell was the new captain, he of course would\r\nbe captain\'s fag.  And he was not quite sure whether to be pleased or\r\nthe reverse at his new dignity.\r\n\r\n"You see," said he to his ally, in a whisper, "it\'s good larks marking\r\nthe fellows off every morning as they come into chapel, but then, don\'t\r\nyou twig that means I\'ve got to be here the moment the bell begins\r\nringing? and that\'s no joke."\r\n\r\n"No, unless you got leave to ring the bell, too," said Parson.  "Then of\r\ncourse they couldn\'t troop in till you were there.  I\'d come down and\r\nhelp with the bell, you know."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t do, I fancy," said Telson.  "Then, of course, it\'s swell\r\nenough work to have to go about and tell the monitors what they\'ve got\r\nto do, but I\'m not so sure if it\'s a good thing to mix altogether with\r\nmonitors--likely to spoil a chap, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Parson.  "Look out, Porter\'s looking."\r\n\r\nWhereupon this brief but edifying dialogue broke off for the present.\r\n\r\nThe monitors duly assembled in the doctor\'s library after chapel.  They\r\nall of them knew what was coming, and their general attitude did not\r\nseem promising for the new _regime_.  Each one possibly fancied he had\r\nthe interests of Willoughby at heart, and all but one or two felt\r\nconvinced that in putting Riddell into the position of captain the\r\ndoctor was committing a serious mistake.  Every one could have given\r\ngood reasons for thinking so, and would have asserted that they had no\r\npersonal ill-feeling towards the new captain, but for the sake of the\r\nschool they were sure he was not the fit person.  Whether each one felt\r\nequally sure that he himself would have filled the post better is a\r\nquestion it is not necessary to ask here.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was brief and to the point.\r\n\r\n"I dare say you know why I have called you together," he said.\r\n"Wyndham--whom every one here liked and respected, and who did a great\r\ndeal for the school"--("Hear, hear," from one or two voices)--"has left,\r\nand we shall all miss him.  The captain of the school has always for a\r\nlong time past been the head classical boy.  It is not a law of the\r\nMedes and Persians that it should be so, and if there seemed any special\r\nreason why the rule should be broken through there is nothing to prevent\r\nthat being done."\r\n\r\nAt this point one or two breathed rather more freely and the attention\r\ngenerally was intensified.  After all, this seemed like the preface to a\r\nmore favourable announcement.  But those who thought so found their\r\nmistake when the doctor proceeded.\r\n\r\n"In the present case there is no such reason, and Riddell here is fully\r\naware of the duties expected of him, and is prepared to perform them.  I\r\nlook to you to support him, and am confident if all work heartily\r\ntogether no one need be afraid for the continued success of Willoughby."\r\n\r\nThe doctor ended his speech amid the silence of his audience, which was\r\nnot broken as he turned and left the room.  At the same moment, to the\r\nrelief of no one more than of Riddell, the bell sounded for breakfast\r\nand the assembly forthwith broke up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAPTAIN IS DISCUSSED ON LAND AND WATER.\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s announcement was not long in taking effect.  As soon as\r\nthird school was over that afternoon the monitors assembled in the Sixth\r\nForm room to discuss the situation.  Fortunately for Riddell\'s peace of\r\nmind, he was not present; but nearly all the others, whether friendly or\r\notherwise, were there.\r\n\r\nGame, with his usual downrightness, opened the ball.\r\n\r\n"Well, you fellows," said he, "what are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s have a game of leapfrog while the fags aren\'t looking," said\r\nCrossfield, a schoolhouse monitor and a wag in a small way.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you to fool about," said Game, ill-temperedly.\r\n"You schoolhouse fellows think, as long as you get well looked after,\r\nWilloughby may go to the dogs."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Fairbairn.  "I don\'t think so."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'d like to make out that Riddell is made captain because\r\nhe\'s the best man for the place, and not because the doctor always\r\nfavours the schoolhouse," snarled Wibberly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s made captain because he\'s head classic," replied Fairbairn; "it\r\nhas nothing to do with his being a schoolhouse fellow."\r\n\r\n"All very well," said Tucker, of Welch\'s, "but it\'s a precious odd\r\nthing, all the same, that the captain is always picked out of the\r\nschoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"And it\'s a precious odd thing too," chimed in Crossfield, "that a head\r\nclassic was never to be got out of Welch\'s for love or money!"\r\n\r\nThis turned the laugh against the unlucky Tucker, who was notoriously a\r\nlong way off being head classic.\r\n\r\n"What I say is," said Game, "we want an all-round man for captain--a\r\nfellow like Bloomfield here, who\'s well up in the Sixth, and far away\r\nthe best fellow in the eleven and the boats.  Besides, he doesn\'t shut\r\nhimself up like Riddell, and give himself airs.  I can\'t see why the\r\ndoctor didn\'t name him.  The only thing against him seems to be that\r\nhe\'s not a schoolhouse gentleman."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the best thing about him in my opinion," said Ashley.\r\n\r\nIf Game and his friends had determined to do their best to gain friends\r\nfor the new captain, this constant bringing-up of the rivalry between\r\nParrett\'s house and the schoolhouse was the very way to do it.  Many of\r\nthe schoolhouse monitors had felt as sore as anybody about the\r\nappointments, but this sort of talk inclined not a few of them to take\r\nRiddell\'s side.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any row made on my account," said Bloomfield.  "If Paddy\r\nthinks Riddell\'s the best man, we have no choice in the matter."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t we, though!" said Wibberly.  "We aren\'t going to have a fellow\r\nput over our heads against our will--at any rate, not without having a\r\nword in the matter."\r\n\r\n"What can you do?" asked Coates.\r\n\r\n"We can resign, I suppose?" said Tucker.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" said Crossfield.  "And suppose Paddy took you at your word,\r\nmy boy?  Sad thing for Welch\'s that would be!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you choose to make a beast of yourself whenever I\r\nspeak," said Tucker, angrily; "I\'ve as much right--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up, Tucker, for goodness\' sake!" said Bloomfield; "don\'t begin by\r\nquarrelling."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, what does he want to cheek me for?" demanded Tucker.  "He\'s\r\na stuck-up schoolhouse prig, that\'s what he is!"\r\n\r\n"And if I only had the flow of costermonger\'s talk which some people\r\npossess--" began Crossfield.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to shut up or not?" demanded Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! you aren\'t captain yet, old man!" replied the irrepressible\r\nCrossfield; "but if you want to know, I am going to shut up now till I\r\nwant to speak again."\r\n\r\n"We might get up a petition to the doctor, anyhow," suggested Game,\r\nreturning to the subject; "he\'d have to take notice of that."\r\n\r\n"What will you say in the petition?" asked Porter.\r\n\r\n"Oh! easy enough that.  Say we don\'t consider Riddell fit to be captain,\r\nand we\'d sooner have some one else."\r\n\r\n"Better say we\'d sooner have Bloomfield at once," said Wibberly.\r\n\r\n"No; please don\'t mention my name," said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t the best thing be to send Riddell back with a label,\r\n`Declined, with thanks,\' pinned on his coat-tail?" suggested Crossfield.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and add, `Try again, Paddy,\'" said Coates, laughing.\r\n\r\n"And just mention no schoolhouse snobs are wanted," said Tucker.\r\n\r\n"And suggest, mildly, that a nice, clever, amiable, high-principled\r\nWelcher like Tom Tucker would be acceptable," added Crossfield.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Tucker, very red in the face, advancing towards his\r\ntormentor, "I\'ve stood your impudence long enough, you cad, and I won\'t\r\nstand any more."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, then," replied Crossfield, cheerfully, "plenty of forms."\r\n\r\n"Look here, you fellows," said Bloomfield again, "for goodness\' sake\r\nshut up.  Have it out afterwards if you like, but don\'t fight here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind where I have it out," growled Tucker, "but I\'ll teach him\r\nto cheek me, see if I don\'t."\r\n\r\nSo saying, much to the relief of every one, he turned on his heel and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nAfter this the discussion again got round to Riddell, and the question\r\nof a petition was revived.\r\n\r\n"It would be quite easy to draw something up that would say what we want\r\nto say and not give offence to any one," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"But what do you want to say?" asked Fairbairn.  "If you want to tell\r\nthe doctor he\'s wrong, and that we are the people to set him right, I\r\ndon\'t see how you can help offending him."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not what we want to say at all," said Game.  "We want to say\r\nthat the captain of Willoughby has always been a fellow who was good all\r\nround, and we think the new captain ought to be of the same sort for the\r\nsake of the school."\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear," said one or two of Parrett\'s house; "what could be better\r\nthan that?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Porter, "I don\'t see much difference between saying that\r\nand telling the doctor he doesn\'t know what he\'s about."\r\n\r\n"Of course _you_ say so--that\'s your schoolhouse prejudice," replied\r\nWibberly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing of the sort," said Fairbairn, warmly; "you know that as\r\nwell as I do, Wibberly."\r\n\r\n"I know it is," retorted Wibberly; "you\'d put up with anybody as long as\r\nhe wasn\'t a Parrett fellow."\r\n\r\nAnd so the wrangle went on; and at the end of it the company was as near\r\nagreeing as they had been at the beginning.\r\n\r\nFinally one or two of the schoolhouse fellows, such as Fairbairn,\r\nCoates, and Porter, withdrew, and the Parrett faction, having it then\r\npretty much their own way, drew up the following petition:\r\n\r\n"We the undersigned monitors respectfully hope you will reconsider your\r\ndecision as to the New Captain.  The captain has hitherto always been an\r\n`all-round man,\' and we think it would be best for the discipline of the\r\nschool to have a fellow of the same sort now.  We wish to say nothing\r\nagainst Riddell except that we do not think he is the best fellow for\r\nthe position.  We hope you will excuse us for stating our opinion."\r\n\r\nTo this extraordinary document all the monitors of Parrett\'s and Welch\'s\r\nhouses present put their names, as well as Gilks and one or two others\r\nof the schoolhouse, and after deciding not to present it till next day,\r\nby which time it was hoped other signatures might be procured, the\r\naugust assembly broke up.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Riddell had not, to say the least of it, opened\r\nauspiciously as far as his fellow-monitors were concerned.  And outside\r\nthat body, in Willoughby at large, things did not look much more\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in Parrett\'s house was of course one of unmingled wrath and\r\nmutiny.  When once the heads of the house were known to have declared so\r\nunmistakably against the new captain, it was not much to be wondered at\r\nthat the rank and file followed their lead in a still more demonstrative\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Parson and his friends, Telson (who, though a\r\nschoolhouse boy, seemed to live most of his life in Parrett\'s), King,\r\nWakefield, and Lawkins, had planned a little expedition up the river\r\nbetween third school and "call-over" that afternoon, and the present\r\nstate of affairs in the school formed a rather lively topic of\r\ndiscussion for these worthies as they pulled the Parrett\'s "Noah\'s\r\nArk"--by which complimentary title the capacious boat devoted to the use\r\nof the juniors of the house was known--lazily up on the tide towards\r\nBalsham.\r\n\r\nThe river was pretty full, as usual at that time of day, and as one form\r\nwhich the wrath of the youthful Parretts took was to insult, and if\r\nopportunity arose, to run down the craft of either of the other houses,\r\nthe discussion on the condition of Willoughby was relieved by more than\r\none lively incident.\r\n\r\n"Think of that chap being captain," said Parson, standing up on the back\r\nseat, with the rudder-lines in his hands so as to command a good view of\r\nthe stream ahead.  "He couldn\'t row as well as old Bosher there."\r\n\r\nAs "old Bosher" was at that moment engaged in super-human efforts to\r\nkeep his balance with one hand, and extricate his oar, which had\r\nfeathered two feet under the surface of the water, with the other, this\r\nillustration was particularly effective and picturesque.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s an awful cad," said Wakefield, who was rowing bow.  "He\r\nreported me to Wyndham last term for letting off crackers in bed."\r\n\r\n"What a beastly shame!" was the sympathising chorus.\r\n\r\n"And you know--" added King.\r\n\r\nBut as Bosher fell rather violently backward into his lap at this\r\ninstant, and let his oar go altogether, what King was going to say did\r\nnot come out.\r\n\r\nAfter a vast amount of manoeuvring, back-watering, shouting, and\r\nreaching to recover the lost oar, the voyage proceeded.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far when the racing-boat of their house, manned\r\nby Bloomfield, Game, Tipper, and Ashley, and coached from the bank by\r\nMr Parrett himself, spun past them in fine style and at a great rate.\r\nAs became loyal Parretts, the juniors pulled into the bank to let the\r\nfour-oar pass, and, not content with this act of homage, they\r\nvolunteered a round of vehement applause into the bargain.\r\n\r\n"Bravo!  Well rowed, our house!  Two to one on Parrett\'s!  Three cheers\r\nfor Bloomfield!  Three cheers for the captain!  Hooroo!"\r\n\r\nWith this gratifying salute the boat darted out of sight round the bend,\r\nleaving the juniors once more to continue on their festive way.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t old Bloomfield a stunner?" said Lawkins.  "He\'s the sort of\r\nfellow for captain!  Not that schoolhouse idiot, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Easy all there about the schoolhouse," shouted down Telson from his\r\nplace at stroke.  "I\'ll fight you if you say it again."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! let\'s land and have a mill!" cried King.  "I back you, Telson,\r\nold man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t mean to cheek you, Telson," said Lawkins, humbly.  "I\'ll\r\napologise, you know."\r\n\r\n"Jolly good job," said Telson, grandly, "or I\'d have licked you."\r\n\r\n"All the same," said Lawkins, "old Bloomfield\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Look out now!" suddenly broke in Parson, who had been gradually getting\r\nexcited where he stood; "there\'s the Welchers coming!  Pull hard, you\r\nfellows, or they\'ll cut us out.  Now then!  Row, Bosher, can\'t you, you\r\nold cow?  Yah! hoo!  Welchers ahoy!" he cried, raising his voice in\r\ntones of derisive defiance.  "Yah! boo! herrings and dough-nuts, jolly\r\ncowards, daren\'t wait for us!  Booh, funk-its!"\r\n\r\nWith such taunts the Hector of Parrett\'s endeavoured to incite the enemy\r\nto battle.  And the enemy, if truth must be told, needed very little\r\npersuasion, especially as the crew in question consisted of Cusack,\r\nPilbury, and the three other ill-starred victim of the raid of two days\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThey lay on their oars and waited for the foe to come up, Cusack\r\nshouting meanwhile, "Who\'d be afraid of a pack of thieves like you!  _I_\r\nwouldn\'t!  I dare you to land and fight us!  Dare you to run into us!\r\nDare you to stand still till we lick you!  Dare you to do anything but\r\nsteal other fellows\' grub!  Ye-ow!"\r\n\r\n"Now, you fellows," cried Parson, "put it on."\r\n\r\nA few strokes brought the two boats level, and then, as they lay side by\r\nside at oar\'s distance, ensued a notable and tremendous splashing match,\r\nwhich was kept up with terrific vigour on both sides, until not only was\r\nevery combatant splashed through, but the two boats themselves were\r\nnearly swamped.\r\n\r\nThen, after either side had insultingly claimed the victory, the boats\r\nseparated, and the dripping warriors parted with a final broadside.\r\n\r\n"There you are, take that, and go and tell the captain!" shouted Parson.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t dare do it if Bloomfield was captain," retorted the\r\nWelchers.  "We\'ll have him captain, then see how you\'ll smile!  Yah!\r\nbah!"\r\n\r\nAnd, amid terrific cat-calling on either side, the crews parted.\r\n\r\nThis last taunt was a sore one for the young Parretts.  It had never\r\noccurred to them that Bloomfield, if he were captain, might perhaps\r\nspoil their sport more than Riddell.  But it was only a passing\r\nannoyance.  After all they were Parretts, and Bloomfield was their man,\r\nwhether he spoiled their sport or not.  Telson had no objection to this\r\nsentiment as long as no one presumed "to cheek the schoolhouse" in\r\nuttering it.  Whenever that was done he insisted on his unalterable\r\ndetermination to fight the offender unless he swallowed his words, which\r\nthe offender usually did.\r\n\r\nThe tide was getting slack, and it was time for them to turn if they\r\nwere to be in for "call-over."  Just, however, as they were about to do\r\nso, a shout behind attracted them, and they became aware of another\r\nfour-oared boat approaching with the schoolhouse flag in the prow.  It\r\ncame along at a fair pace, but with nothing like the style which had\r\nmarked the Parretts\' boat.\r\n\r\nThe crew consisted of Fairbairn, Porter, Coates, and Gilks, with\r\nCrossfield steering: the first time a complete schoolhouse crew had\r\nappeared on the river this year.\r\n\r\nThe blood of the young Parretts was up, and the credit of their house\r\nwas in question.\r\n\r\n"Put it on now," said Parson to his men, as the schoolhouse boat came\r\nup.  "Show \'em what you can do!  Now then, slide into it!  Race \'em!"\r\n\r\nAnd the young heroes laid into their work and made Noah\'s Ark forge\r\nalong at an unwonted pace.  Parson busily encouraged them, varying his\r\nexhortations by occasional taunts addressed to the other boat.\r\n\r\n"Now then," he shouted, "two to one on us.  Come on, you there, jolly\r\nschoolhouse louts--"\r\n\r\n"Parson, I\'ll fight you if you say it again," interposed Telson by way\r\nof parenthesis.\r\n\r\n"Oh, beg pardon, old man.  Pull away, you fellows!  Parretts for ever!\r\nNo Riddell for us!  Three cheers for Bloomfield!  You\'re gaining, you\r\nfellows.  Oh, well pulled indeed our boat!"\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse boat had slackened speed, and paddling gently alongside,\r\nwas taking careful note of these audacious youngsters, who, puffing and\r\nplunging along, fully believed they were beating the picked four of the\r\nrival house by their own prowess.\r\n\r\nThe big boys seemed amused on the whole, and good-humouredly kept up the\r\nsemblance of a race for about half a mile, taking care to give the\r\nchallenging crew a wide berth.\r\n\r\nAt last, after about ten minutes had been spent in this way, and when\r\nthe young champions were all, except Parson, fairly exhausted,\r\nCrossfield took out his watch and said to his crew, winking as he did\r\nso, "Time we turned, you fellows; it\'s five o\'clock.  Easy all, pull bow\r\nside! back water, stroke!"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, the schoolhouse boat suddenly turned round and started\r\noff at a smart pace down stream, where it was soon out of reach of the\r\nparting taunts and opprobrious noises which Parson, for the credit of\r\nhis house, continued to hurl at its crew till they were beyond earshot.\r\n\r\nThen it suddenly began to occur to these elated young navigators that if\r\nit had been time for the four-oar to turn three minutes ago it was\r\npossibly time for them to turn also.\r\n\r\n"What did he say the time was?" asked King.\r\n\r\n"Five o\'clock!" said Lawkins.\r\n\r\n"Five o\'clock! and call-over is at 5:20!  We can\'t do it in the time!"\r\nexclaimed Parson, aghast.\r\n\r\n"My eye, what a row there\'ll be," groaned Telson.  "I\'ve been late for\r\ncall-over twice this week already, and I\'m certain to get reported now!"\r\n\r\n"So shall I be," said Bosher.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all a vile dodge of those schoolhouse cads," exclaimed King.  "I\r\nmean," said he (perceiving that Telson was about to make a remark), "of\r\nthose cads.  They did it on purpose to make us late.  I see it all now.\r\nAnd then they\'ll report us.  Ugh! did you ever know such blackguards?"\r\n\r\nThe discovery was too late to be any good--that is, as far as the hope\r\nof reaching Willoughby before call-over was concerned.  However, it\r\nwarned them the sooner they turned now the sooner they would get back at\r\nall.  So they turned viciously and started homewards.\r\n\r\nThe rowers were all too tired and enraged to talk much, and the journey\r\ndown stream was silent and gloomy.  They heard, about a mile from home,\r\nthe school bell ringing for call-over, and groaned inwardly when\r\npresently it ceased, and they knew their names were being called over\r\nand not one of them there to answer.  Parson alone made any attempt to\r\nkeep up the drooping spirits of his crew.\r\n\r\n"Never fear.  We\'ll pay them out, you see.  And if they do report us\r\nwe\'ll only get impots.  The beasts!  I wish we\'d run into them and\r\ndrowned them all! so I do."\r\n\r\nAt this point the speaker became aware of an outrigger skiff rapidly\r\napproaching them.  The rower of course had his back turned, and\r\nevidently not expecting anything ahead, was steering himself "over his\r\ntoes," as the term is--that is by some landmark behind the boat.  Who he\r\nwas Parson could not make out, but he wore a light-blue ribbon on his\r\nstraw, and that was enough.  Light-blue was the schoolhouse colour.\r\nHere was a chance of paying out of the enemy, anyhow!\r\n\r\nSo he ordered his men to "easy all" and allow the unconscious sculler to\r\ncome close up.  Then when he was within a few yards he started up, and\r\nwith a wild shout of, "Yah booh, cad!" gave the signal to his crew to\r\npull on, and brought his boat close alongside the skiff.  The rower,\r\nstartled by the sudden shout, turned quickly round.\r\n\r\nHorror of horrors!  It was Mr Parrett himself!\r\n\r\nThere was no time to do anything.  At the instant he turned, his left\r\nscull came into violent contact with the oars of the Noah\'s Ark, and was\r\njerked from his hand, and at the same time the light boat gave a violent\r\nlurch over and capsized, sending her occupant headlong into the river!\r\n\r\nThe small boys, pale with fright and dazed by the suddenness of the\r\naccident, sat for a moment unable to move or cry out.  Then by a sudden\r\nwild impulse Parson sprang boldly into the water, followed in a second\r\nor two first by Telson, then by Lawkins.  The other three held to the\r\noars and waited where they were.\r\n\r\nThe tide was running down at a good pace, and the river was fairly wide,\r\nbut there was not much danger to any of the immersed ones.  All\r\nWilloughby boys could swim, and as Mr Parrett had taught most of them\r\nto do so himself, he hardly stood in need of the help of his three\r\npupils.  A few strokes brought them all to the bank in safety.\r\n\r\nAn uncomfortable moment ensued.  Mr Parrett said nothing to the three\r\ndripping boys who stood before him, but called to the boys in the boat\r\nto row in, bringing the skiff with them.\r\n\r\nAll the while this was being done, Telson and Parson looked despairingly\r\nat one another, and darted scared looks at Mr Parrett.  He appeared not\r\nto notice them, but stood impatiently waiting for the boats.\r\n\r\n"Is the scull broken?" he called out as they approached.\r\n\r\n"No, sir," said Wakefield.\r\n\r\nThe skiff was put in close to the bank, and a brief examination showed\r\nthat it was not damaged.  Mr Parrett got into it, and without saying a\r\nword began to push off.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," cried Parson at this point, feeling that his last chance\r\nwas going, "I\'m so sorry.  We didn\'t know it was you, sir.  It was all\r\nmy fault."\r\n\r\n"No, sir," shouted Telson, "it was all my fault.  We\'re awfully sorry,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\nMr Parrett took no notice of these protestations, but said, quietly,\r\n"You\'d better get home quickly and change your things."\r\n\r\nSo saying he sculled off, with a face hardly less puzzled than the small\r\nscared faces which, after watching him go, turned dismally to their own\r\nunlucky Noah\'s Ark.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at the school some half-hour later, Parson, Telson,\r\nBosher, King, and Lawkins were informed that, having been reported for\r\nbeing absent at call-over, the captain wished to see them in his study\r\nafter breakfast the next morning.\r\n\r\nLater on that same evening another notice reached them that they were\r\nwanted in Mr Parrett\'s room at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nBREAKERS AHEAD.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett was a popular master at Willoughby.  He was an old Cambridge\r\n"blue," and it was to his influence and example that the school in\r\ngeneral, and Parrett\'s house in particular, were chiefly indebted for\r\ntheir excellence in all manly sports.  He was the most patient of\r\ntrainers, and the most long-suffering of "coaches."  Nearly all his\r\nspare time was given up to the public service.  Every afternoon you\r\nwould be sure to find him in his flannels running along the bank beside\r\nsome boat, or standing to be bowled at by aspiring young cricketers in\r\nthe meadow, or superintending a swimming party up at the Willows.\r\n\r\nBoys didn\'t give Mr Parrett credit for all the self-denial he really\r\nunderwent; for he had a way of seeming to enjoy even the drudgery of his\r\nself-imposed work, and it rarely occurred even to the most hopeless of\r\n"duffers" to imagine that all the trouble spent over him was anything\r\nbut a pleasure to the master who spent it.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett had his reward, however, in the good will of the boys\r\ngenerally, which he prized highly, and nowhere was he more popular than\r\namong the juniors of his own house.\r\n\r\nWhat was their dismay, therefore, at the accident of that unlucky\r\nafternoon, and with what doleful faces did they present themselves in a\r\nmelancholy procession at the door of his room at the appointed hour!\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Mr Parrett, who was still in his flannels, and had not\r\nquite done tea.  "Oh, you are the boys that I met on the river this\r\nafternoon.  All except one belonging to my house, I see."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," exclaimed Telson, who was the distinguished exception,\r\n"they\'re all Parretts except me, and it was all my fault, sir, and\r\nI\'m--"\r\n\r\n"No," interrupted Parson, "it was all my fault; I was steering."\r\n\r\n"It was all our faults," said Lawkins.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Mr Parrett, who could not help looking a little amused at\r\nthe eager faces of the young culprits.  "Perhaps it was my fault for not\r\nlooking where I was coming to."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir," said Parson, "that wouldn\'t have been any good.  We ran you\r\ndown on purpose."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said Mr Parrett, not quite sure whether he had heard correctly.\r\n\r\n"That is, we didn\'t know it was you, sir; we thought it was a\r\nschoolhouse--" (here Telson looked threatening)--"I mean we thought it\r\nwas some one else.  We wouldn\'t have done it if we thought it was you,\r\nsir--indeed we wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, that we wouldn\'t," chimed in the chorus.\r\n\r\n"And who did you think it was, pray?" inquired Mr Parrett.\r\n\r\n"A schoolhouse fellow," replied Parson, avoiding Telson\'s glances.\r\n\r\n"Which schoolhouse boy?" asked the master.\r\n\r\n"Any one, sir.  It didn\'t matter much which."\r\n\r\n"Indeed.  And what has the schoolhouse done to you?" said Mr Parrett,\r\nleaning back in his chair and pushing his plate away.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\'t an easy question, but Parson felt something ought to be said.\r\n\r\n"Some of them are rather cads, sir," he said.\r\n\r\n("Parson," whispered Telson.  "I\'ll fight you when you get outside.")\r\n\r\n"I mean, sir," said Parson, hurriedly, "that is--(I beg pardon, Telson,\r\nold man, I didn\'t mean)--they don\'t like us, and--"\r\n\r\n"And we don\'t like them," said Lawkins.\r\n\r\n"And you think they ought to like you?" asked Mr Parrett, severely.\r\n\r\nThis was a poser.  The Parrett juniors had never asked themselves the\r\nquestion before.\r\n\r\n"Now listen to me," said Mr Parrett.  "I\'m angry with you, and I\'m\r\ngoing to punish you.  I am not angry with you for capsizing me this\r\nafternoon.  You did it by mistake, you say, and no harm was done.  And\r\nI\'m not going to punish you for being out late, for that the captain\r\nwill do.  But boys who make nuisances of themselves and then complain\r\nthat other boys don\'t like them are not to be put up with in Willoughby.\r\nYou five have had a lesson already.  You might have caused a much worse\r\naccident than you did by your folly.  You may be thankful you did not.\r\nFor a week neither of you is to go on to the river at all, and after\r\nthat till the end of the term you will only be allowed to go with the\r\ncaptain\'s permission, or in the company of a senior.  You can go."\r\n\r\nThe party turned to obey, when Mr Parrett added, "Three of you, Telson,\r\nParson, and Lawkins, remain a moment."\r\n\r\nThe other two went off, leaving their three comrades standing at the end\r\nof the table, wondering what on earth was coming next.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett\'s manner changed as he turned to them.  He became\r\nembarrassed, and spoke almost nervously.\r\n\r\n"You three," he said, "jumped in after me this afternoon, did you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please, sir," said Telson; "Parson was first, sir."\r\n\r\nMr Parrett rose from his seat, and, without saying a word, shook hands\r\nwith each one of them, greatly to their astonishment and confusion.\r\n\r\n"You can go now," said the master, when the ceremony was concluded;\r\n"good-night, boys."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, sir," said they, and filed out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Parson and Telson, as they walked slowly back\r\nalong the passage, could find words suitable to the occasion.  Then\r\nTelson said, "Well, that was a rum thing of him to do!"\r\n\r\n"What did he mean?" asked Parson.\r\n\r\n"Goodness knows.  But, I say, it\'s a jolly soak being stopped the river,\r\nthough."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and having to get a `permit\' when the time is up.  I\'d sooner not\r\ngo on than beg a `permit\' of the captain."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what he\'ll say to us to-morrow," said Telson.  "He won\'t lick\r\nus, eh?"\r\n\r\n"He\'d better not," said Parson.  "You and I could lick him easy."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'ll give us a howling impot.  I say I\'m getting fagged of\r\nimpots.  I\'ve had four this week."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had three," sighed Telson.  "Heigho!  Willoughby\'s going to the\r\ndogs.  I\'ve a good mind to cut the whole concern."\r\n\r\nAnd so in rather desponding mood the two friends separated, and Telson\r\nhad an exciting chase across the quadrangle to avoid two monitors who\r\nwere prowling about there (as he concluded) for the express purpose of\r\n"potting" him.\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was mistaken.  The two monitors were Gilks of the\r\nschoolhouse and Silk of Welch\'s, who were taking the air this hot summer\r\nevening, and thinking and talking of anything but Master Telson.\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said Gilks, "I detest the fellow."\r\n\r\n"You detest such a lot of fellows, Gilks," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"I know I do," said Gilks, "but I hate Riddell more than the lot put\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\n"I should have thought he was rather an inoffensive duffer," suggested\r\nSilk.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the worst of it.  I\'d give anything to catch him out in\r\nanything that wasn\'t quite square, just to pay him out for his sickening\r\npriggishness.  Why," he exclaimed, with increasing anger in his tone,\r\n"what do you think he did the other day, long before he was captain, or\r\nhad any pretence to give himself airs?  He pulled me up before all the\r\nfellows for--well, for using--"\r\n\r\n"For swearing?" said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you like.  For swearing.  What business is it of his what I\r\nsay?  I should like to know."\r\n\r\n"Usen\'t Wyndham to be down on fellows for swearing too?" asked Silk.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he was," said Gilks (who had good reason to know); "but he had a\r\nright to do it.  This cub hasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"What did Riddell say?"\r\n\r\n"What did he say?  He said it didn\'t make what I said any better worth\r\nhearing for sticking in an oath, and that-- Oh, I don\'t know what\r\nprecious impudence he didn\'t give me."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha," said Silk, "it wasn\'t bad.  But I agree with you, the fellow\r\nis a prig--"\r\n\r\n"I know I mean to make a stand now," said Gilks.  "He shan\'t stick up\r\nhis sanctimonious nose over us all, now he\'s captain, if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"Why, what will you do?" asked Silk.\r\n\r\n"Do!  I\'ll punch his head the first time he dare lecture me."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Silk, "don\'t be such a fool.  You won\'t do a bit\r\nof good by that.  If you do want to pay him out, pay him out in his own\r\ncoin."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?" inquired Gilks.\r\n\r\n"I mean, keep a sharp lookout till you catch his holiness tripping."\r\n\r\n"But the beggar never does trip.  He\'s so vilely careful, he never gives\r\na chance," growled Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Awfully uncivil of him, when he knows how grateful we should be to\r\nhim," said Silk, laughing.  "Never mind, old man, keep in with him if\r\nyou can.  Something\'s sure to turn up.  He won\'t suspect you, as you\'re\r\nin the schoolhouse; and we ought to be able to manage to put a spoke in\r\nhis wheel somehow."\r\n\r\n"Wish you may do it," said Gilks.  "Anyhow, I dare say you are right;\r\nit\'s no use flaring up too soon, if there is a chance of doing him.  By\r\nthe way, Fairbairn\'s pretty nearly as bad as Riddell; they\'re a pair,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but Fairbairn\'s in the boat," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"So he is; and what\'s more, he\'s got a spite against me, and wants to\r\nturn me out of it."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"He says I don\'t do enough work.  I should like to know how a fellow is\r\nto work behind a sanctimonious ass like him?"\r\n\r\n"I hear the schoolhouse boat isn\'t a bad one, even without Wyndham,"\r\nsaid Silk.\r\n\r\n"Pretty fair.  But if I\'m in it I\'ll see it doesn\'t win," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"What a nice boy you are, to be sure!  I suppose you\'ve a bet on\r\nParrett\'s, like me?"\r\n\r\n"No, I haven\'t," said Gilks, "but I want it to win all the same, because\r\nof Bloomfield.  If Parrett\'s gets to the head of the river, there\'s all\r\nthe better chance of getting Bloomfield for captain next term; and\r\nthings would be far pleasanter then."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I don\'t suppose Bloomfield\'s very particular," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Not he.  You can make him do what you like.  He\'s not all the notions\r\nof his own that the Reverend Riddell has, hang him!"\r\n\r\n"Well, old man," said Silk, "as I said before, you\'re a nice boy, and a\r\nsweet companion for a tender youth like me.  Ha, ha!  Good-night.  Are\r\nyou one of the deputation that\'s going to present the petition in the\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Take my advice and back out of it.  It won\'t come to anything, and if\r\nyou\'re not mixed up in it our pious friends will think you are one of\r\nthem, and that\'ll pay.  Do you twig?  Good-night.  You _are_ a nice\r\nboy!"\r\n\r\nSo saying these two worthies separated.\r\n\r\nGilks acted on his friend\'s advice, and contrived to be absent after\r\nchapel next morning, when it was proposed to present the petition to the\r\ndoctor.  He managed to invent some excuse for his desertion which made\r\nit appear it was unavoidable.  Nevertheless it was a good deal\r\ncomplained of, because he had been the only representative of the\r\nschoolhouse who had promised to go with the others to the doctor.\r\n\r\nHowever it was decided not to postpone the ceremony any further.  As it\r\nwas, one or two were beginning to have their doubts as to its wisdom,\r\nand Game and those like him, who were the prime movers in the matter,\r\nbegan to fear the whole thing might fall through.\r\n\r\nSo, directly after morning chapel, the deputation, consisting of three,\r\nmarched boldly to the doctor\'s library and knocked at the door.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Dr Patrick.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised to see three monitors obey the invitation.  It was very\r\nrarely that a petition was presented from the school to the head master\r\nat Willoughby.  Once, some years ago, a petition signed by the entire\r\nschool, from the captain down to the junior fag, praying for a holiday\r\nin honour of an old Willoughbite having led the British troops to\r\nvictory in a great battle, had been presented and granted.  And once\r\nsince then, a petition from the monitors of each house requesting that\r\nthe head of each house might be allowed to use the cane when necessary,\r\ninstead of the captain of the school only, had been presented and\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nNow came a third petition, signed by certain monitors of two houses,\r\nasking the doctor to withdraw one captain and substitute another.\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked the head master.\r\n\r\n"A petition, sir," said Game, handing the momentous document in.\r\n\r\nThe doctor opened it and glanced at it with a puzzled look, which soon\r\ndarkened into a frown.\r\n\r\n"What is all this?" he asked, looking up.\r\n\r\nHis aspect was not promising.  Nevertheless it was necessary for some\r\none to speak, and Game therefore blurted out, "We don\'t think Riddell\r\nwill make a good captain, sir, and--" and here stopped.\r\n\r\n"And what, sir?" demanded the doctor.\r\n\r\n"And," said Game, in rather a faltering voice, "we thought you would not\r\nbe angry if we petitioned you about it."\r\n\r\n"Do you speak for yourself, Game," said the doctor, "or for others?"\r\n\r\n"For the monitors, sir; that is, for those who have signed that paper."\r\n\r\nThe doctor folded up the petition and handed it back to Game without\r\nreading it.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you have told me what it is all about," said he, sternly, "in\r\ntime to prevent my reading either the petition or the names attached.\r\nIt does not do you credit as monitors, and I hope you will soon see the\r\nmatter in the same light.  I did not expect it of you, but I regret it\r\nless on your account than on account of the school, to whom you have set\r\na bad example.  You may go."\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke in tones of unwonted anger, not unmixed with scorn.  He\r\nrarely "flared up," but when he did it was always uncomfortable for\r\nthose against whom his wrath was roused.\r\n\r\nThe deputation slunk off sheepishly, carrying their petition with them,\r\nand too glad to get out of the angry presence of the head master to\r\nthink of anything else.\r\n\r\nThe doctor may have been right, and probably was right in thus summarily\r\nextinguishing the petition and the petitioners.  But he had done it in a\r\nmanner which was hardly calculated to smooth matters.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the deputation reported their bad success to the monitors\r\nwho awaited them, the general feeling was far more one of anger at being\r\nsnubbed than of repentance for having done a foolish thing.\r\n\r\n"If Paddy had only taken the trouble to read the thing through," said\r\nAshley, "and honour us with one or two reasons for not doing what we\r\nasked, it wouldn\'t have been so bad."\r\n\r\n"As it is he\'s as good as told us to mind our own business and he\'ll\r\nmind his," said Tipper, little thinking how exactly he had described the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n"If we\'re not to be allowed to say a word about the management of the\r\nschool," said Game, "I don\'t see what right he has to expect us to do\r\nhis work for him, and keep order."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it won\'t do to resign or anything of that sort," said Ashley.\r\n"That would be like funking it altogether."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll soon find his mistake out, never fear," said another.  "He won\'t\r\nlisten to us, but he can\'t help believing his own eyes."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it can\'t go on for long," said Tipper.  "Riddell\'s bound to show\r\nthat he\'s not up to his work sooner or later, and I won\'t interfere to\r\nprevent it."\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile," said Game, who of all the malcontents was the most honest,\r\n"what\'s to become of Willoughby?  We must keep some sort of order,\r\nwhoever is captain."\r\n\r\n"Why, whatever authority can we have when the most we can do is to\r\nreport fellows to that milksop?" said Tipper.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what," said Ashley, "if we\'re compelled to _call_ Riddell\r\ncaptain, there\'s nothing to prevent us considering another fellow so."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked some one.\r\n\r\n"He means," said Game, "and it\'s not half a bad idea, that if Bloomfield\r\nwill help us to keep order, we can consider him captain whether he\'s\r\ncalled so or not.  If once the fellows know they\'ll get reported to him,\r\nwe shall have some sort of authority."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Bloomfield, who had not yet spoken, "I\'ll do my best\r\nto keep order and all that; but as I\'m not captain, it\'s no use to\r\npretend being it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll see about that," said Ashley.  "If you choose to work for the\r\nschool after what has happened, all I can say is you deserve to be\r\nbacked up, and I\'ll back you up for one."\r\n\r\n"So will I," said Wibberly.\r\n\r\nBloomfield could not resist flattery.  As soon as it was represented to\r\nhim that the hope of Willoughby centred in him, and that he was acting a\r\nbeautiful and Christian part in still taking an interest in its welfare\r\nafter the way he had been treated, he felt as if he really ought to meet\r\nhis admirers half-way.\r\n\r\n"Already a lot of the kids consider you as captain," said Game.  "Didn\'t\r\nyou hear a boatful of them cheering you yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bloomfield, "I heard that."\r\n\r\n"Very well, they\'re much more likely to keep order for you than for that\r\nother fellow.  We\'ll try it anyhow."\r\n\r\n"I know a lot of the schoolhouse monitors think just the same as we do,"\r\nsaid Tipper, "but they\'re so precious jealous for their house.  They\'d\r\nsooner stick to Riddell than allow a Parrett\'s fellow to be cock of the\r\nschool."\r\n\r\n"A Parrett\'s fellow is cock of the school all the same," said Wibberly.\r\n"I wish the regatta was over.  That will put things right."\r\n\r\n"Yes; when once Parrett\'s boat is at the head of the river the\r\nschoolhouse won\'t have much to crow for," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"For all that," replied Bloomfield, "they seem to be grinding a bit with\r\nthe crew they have got."\r\n\r\n"Let them grind," said Game, laughing.  "I\'d as soon back Welch\'s boat\r\nas theirs.  Fairbairn\'s the only man that does any work, and he\'s no\r\nform at all.  Why don\'t they put the new captain in the boat, I wonder?"\r\n\r\nThe bare idea was sufficient to set the company laughing, in the midst\r\nof which the assembly-dispersed.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Game to Ashley, as they went into the "Big," "to-\r\nnight is the opening meeting of the School Parliament.  I mean to\r\npropose Bloomfield for president; will you second it?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAPTAIN ENTERS ON HIS DUTIES.\r\n\r\nThe morning that witnessed the collapse of the famous Monitors\' Petition\r\nhad not been idly spent by the new captain.  He had made the worst\r\npossible preparation for his new duties by lying awake half the night,\r\nbrooding over his difficulties and working himself into a state of\r\nnervous misery very unlike what one would expect of the captain of a\r\ngreat public school.\r\n\r\nWhat worried him was not so much that he felt himself unpopular, or that\r\nhe knew all Willoughby was in arms against him.  That wasn\'t cheerful,\r\ncertainly, or precisely solacing to a fellow\'s self-esteem; but it was\r\nnot nearly so disheartening as the feeling that he himself was unequal\r\nto cope with the difficulties he would have to face.  How could he cope\r\nwith them?  He had never succeeded yet in keeping Telson, his own fag,\r\nin order.  How was he to expect to administer discipline to all the\r\nscapegraces of Willoughby?  It would be bad enough, even if the monitors\r\nas a body were working with him, but when he was left almost single-\r\nhanded, as seemed probable, what chance was there?  Whatever would he do\r\nsupposing a boy was reported to him for some offence, such as going out\r\nof bounds or--\r\n\r\nBy the way!  And here a horrible thought flashed across his mind.  He\r\nhad been so flurried last night with one thing and another that he had\r\nhardly noticed a message sent him after call-over by the Register Clerk.\r\nBut it occurred to him now that it was about some boys who had not\r\nanswered to their names.\r\n\r\nHe got out of bed with a groan and searched the mantelpiece for the\r\nnote.  Ah! here it was:\r\n\r\n"Co.  Fr. p.m., Telson (S.H.), Bosher, King, Lawkins, Parson (P), Abs.\r\nGo Capt. 81/2 Sa.  (Telson 2, Bosher 1, Parson 2.)"\r\n\r\nAfter a great deal of puzzling and cogitation Riddell managed to\r\ntranslate this lucid document into ordinary English as follows:\r\n\r\n"Call-Over, Friday evening, Telson (schoolhouse), Bosher, King, Lawkins,\r\nParson (Parrett\'s), absent.  To go to the captain at half-past eight on\r\nSaturday.  (Telson has already been absent twice this week, Bosher once,\r\nParson twice.)" And with the discovery the unhappy captain found his\r\nworst fears realised.\r\n\r\nWhatever would he do?  It was now half-past five.  In three hours they\r\nwould be here.  What would Wyndham have done?  Caned them, no doubt.\r\nRiddell had no cane.  Ruler?  He might break one of their ringers, or\r\nthey might resist; or worse still baffle him with some ingenious excuse\r\nwhich he would not know how to deal with.\r\n\r\nHe sat by his bed staring hopelessly at the paper and wishing himself\r\nanywhere but head of the school--and then as no new light appeared to\r\ndawn on the question, and as going back to bed would be a farce, he\r\nproceeded to dress.\r\n\r\nHe had just completed his toilet when he heard some one moving in the\r\nnext study.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Fairbairn getting up," he said to himself.  "I wonder if he\r\ncould help me?"\r\n\r\nHe thought he could.  And yet, under the nervous exterior of this boy\r\nthere lurked a certain pride which held him back from acting on the\r\nimpulse.  After all, if he was to do the work, why should he try to\r\nshunt part of his responsibility on to another?\r\n\r\nSo, though he went to his friend\'s study, he said nothing about the\r\nbatch of juniors from whom he expected a morning call.\r\n\r\nFairbairn was arraying himself in his boating things, and greeted his\r\nfriend cheerily.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Riddell, here\'s an early start for you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Riddell; "I couldn\'t sleep very well, so I thought I might\r\nas well get up."\r\n\r\n"Best thing for you.  But why haven\'t you your flannels on?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going out," said Riddell.  "Besides, I don\'t believe I have\r\nflannels," added he.\r\n\r\n"What, a Willoughby captain and no flannels!  You\'ll have to get a suit\r\nat once, do you hear?  But, I say, why don\'t you come down to the river\r\nwith Porter and me?  We\'re going to have a little practice spin, and you\r\ncould steer us.  It would do you more good than sticking indoors.  Come\r\nalong."\r\n\r\nRiddell protested he would rather not, and that he couldn\'t steer; but\r\nFairbairn pooh-poohed both objections, and finally carried off his man\r\nto the river, where his unwonted appearance in the stern of the\r\nschoolhouse pair-oar caused no little astonishment and merriment among\r\nthe various early visitors who usually frequented the waters of the\r\nCraydle.\r\n\r\nDespite these unflattering remarks, and despite the constant terror he\r\nwas in of piloting his boat into the bank, or running foul of other\r\nboats, Riddell decidedly enjoyed his little outing, the more so as the\r\nexercise and occupation drove away entirely for a time all thoughts of\r\nthe coming visit of the ill-behaved juniors.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as he returned to the school the prospect of this ordeal\r\nbegan again to haunt him, and spoilt morning chapel for him completely.\r\n\r\nAs he stood during the service in his captain\'s place he could not\r\nprevent his eye wandering hurriedly down the ranks of boys opposite and\r\nwondering how many of them he would be called upon to interview in his\r\nstudy before the term was over.  As he reached the end of the array his\r\neye rested on Telson close to the door, talking and laughing behind his\r\nhand with Parson, who listened in an unconcerned way, and looked about\r\nhim as if he felt himself to be the monarch of all he surveyed.  These\r\nwere two of the boys who would wait upon him in his study immediately\r\nafter prayers!  Riddell turned quite miserable at the idea.\r\n\r\nPrayers ended at last, and while the other monitors repaired to the\r\nSixth Form room to discuss the presentation of the petition as narrated\r\nin our last chapter, Riddell walked dejectedly to his study and prepared\r\nto receive company.\r\n\r\nNo one came for a long time, and Riddell was beginning to hope that,\r\nafter all, the dreaded interview was not to come off, or that there was\r\na mistake somewhere, and some one else was to deal with the culprits\r\ninstead of himself, when a scuttling of footsteps down the passage made\r\nhis blood run cold and his heart sink into his boots.\r\n\r\n"I _must_ be cool," he said to himself, fiercely, as a knock sounded at\r\nthe door, "or I shall make a fool of myself.  Come in."\r\n\r\nIn response to this somewhat tremulous invitation, Telson, Parson,\r\nBosher, Lawkins, King, trooped into his study, the picture of\r\nsatisfaction and assurance, and stood lounging about the room with their\r\nhands in their pockets as though curiosity was the sole motive of their\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nRiddell, while waiting for them, had hastily considered what he ought to\r\nsay or do.  But now, any ideas he ever had darted from his mind, and he\r\ngazed nervously at the small company.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said he at length, breaking silence by a tremendous effort, and\r\nconscious that he was looking as confused as he felt, "I suppose you are\r\nthe boy--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bosher, leaning complacently against the table and staring\r\nat a picture over the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"The boys who were late," said Riddell, stammering.  "Let me see."  Here\r\nhe took up the paper and began to read it over: "`Co.  Pri.  Telson\r\n(S.H.).\'  Ah, yes!  Telson.  You were late, weren\'t you?  Why were you\r\nlate?"\r\n\r\nA question like this was decidedly a novelty; Wyndham\'s formula had\r\ninvariably been, "Telson, hold out your hand," and then if Telson had\r\nanything to remark he was at liberty to do so.  But to be thus invited\r\nto make excuses was an unexpected treat which these cunning juniors were\r\nquite sharp enough to jump at.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know," began Telson, "it wasn\'t our fault.  We were up-stream\r\nin the Ark, and meant to be back all right, only the schoolhouse boat\r\noverhauled us, and we had to race them a bit--didn\'t we, you fellows?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Parson; "and a spanking race it was.  We held up to them\r\nall down the Willow Reach, and were just collaring them for the finish\r\nup to Balsham Weir, when the beasts pulled in and funked it."\r\n\r\n"And then, of course, we couldn\'t get back in time," said Lawkins.  "We\r\nwere jolly fagged--weren\'t we, you fellows?--and it was all a plant of\r\nthose schoolhouse cads."\r\n\r\n"Fight you!" said Telson, menacingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, beg pardon, old man, didn\'t mean.  They ran us up on purpose to\r\nmake us late.  You ask them.  It was a beastly low trick!"\r\n\r\n"And then coming back," continued Telson, "we ran down old Parrett in\r\nhis skiff and spilt him, and we had to fish him out--didn\'t we, you\r\nchaps?--and that made us late.  You ask Parrett; he\'s potted us for it,\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\nRiddell listened to all this in a bewildered way, not knowing what to\r\nmake of it.  If the boys\' story was correct, there certainly might be\r\nsome force in their excuse.  It would hardly be fair to punish them if\r\nthey were decoyed out of their way by some seniors.  And then, of\r\ncourse, this story about Mr Parrett; they would never make up a story\r\nlike that.  And if it was true--well, he did not see how they could have\r\ndone otherwise than stay and help him out of the water after capsizing\r\nhim into it.  It really seemed to him as if these boys did not deserve\r\nto be punished.  True, Telson and Parson had been twice late this week,\r\nbut that was not what they were reported for now.  The question was,\r\nwere they to be chastised for this third offence or not?\r\n\r\n"What did Mr Parrett do to you?" he asked presently.  "Oh," said\r\nParson, gaily, fully taking in the situation so far, "he was down on us\r\nhot.  He\'s stopped our going on the river a week, and then we\'ve got to\r\nget a permit till the end of the term.  Jolly hard lines it is,\r\nespecially race term.  I shan\'t be able to cox.  Parrett\'s boat at the\r\nregatta.  No more will young Telson cox the schoolhouse boat.  You ask\r\nParrett," said he, in tones of manly appeal.\r\n\r\n"Then you mean Mr Parrett has already punished you?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Rather," said Telson.  "I\'d sooner have had a licking any day than get\r\nstopped river-play.  Wouldn\'t you, Parson?"\r\n\r\n"I should think I would," said Parson.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Riddell, dubiously, "of course if Mr Parrett has already\r\npunished you--"\r\n\r\n"You ask him!" again said Parson.  "You ask him if he\'s not stopped our\r\nriver-play.  Ah five of us!  Mayn\'t go on at all for a week, and then\r\nwe\'ve got to get your permit.  Isn\'t that what he said, you chaps?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," chimed in the "chaps," in injured voices.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Riddell, "as that is so, I think you can--that is, I\r\nwish just to tell you--you--it mustn\'t occur again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right," said Parson, making for the door.\r\n\r\n"And I hope," began Riddell--\r\n\r\nBut what it was he hoped, his youthful audience did not remain to hear.\r\nThey had vanished with amazing celerity, and the captain, as he walked\r\npensively up to the door and shut it, could hear them marching jauntily\r\ndown the passage shouting and laughing over their morning\'s adventures.\r\n\r\nA moment\'s reflection satisfied Riddell that he had been "done" by these\r\nunscrupulous youngsters.  He had let them off on their own\r\nrepresentations, and without taking due care to verify their story.  And\r\nnow it would go out to all Willoughby that the new captain was a fool,\r\nand that any one who liked could be late for call-over if only he had\r\nthe ingenuity to concoct a plausible story when he was reported.  A nice\r\nbeginning this to his new reign!  Riddell saw it all clearly now, when\r\nit was too late.  Why ever had he not seen it as clearly at the time?\r\n\r\nWas it too late?  Riddell went to the door again and looked down the\r\npassage.  The young malefactors were out of sight, but their footsteps\r\nand voices were still audible.  Hadn\'t he better summon them back?  Had\r\nnot he better, at any cost to his own pride, own that he had made a\r\nmistake, rather than let the discipline of Willoughby run down?\r\n\r\nHe took a few hurried steps in the direction of the voices, and was even\r\nmaking up his mind to run, when it suddenly occurred to him, "What if,\r\nafter all, their story _had_ been true, and the calling of them back\r\nshould be a greater mistake even than the letting of them off?"\r\n\r\nThis awkward doubt drove him back once more to his study, where,\r\nshutting the door, he flung himself into his chair in a state of abject\r\ndespondency and shame.\r\n\r\nTwenty times he determined to go to the doctor at once, and refuse for\r\nan hour longer to play the farce of being captain of Willoughby.  And as\r\noften another spirit kept him back, and whispered to him that it was\r\nonly the cowards who gave in at a single failure.\r\n\r\nFrom these unpleasant reflections the summons to first school was a\r\nwelcome diversion, and he gladly shook off the captain for an hour, and\r\nfigured in his more congenial part of a scholar.  But even here he was\r\nnot allowed wholly to forget his new responsibilities.  Nearly all those\r\naround him were fellow-monitors, who had just come smarting from the\r\ndoctor\'s summary rejection of their petition; and Riddell could tell by\r\ntheir angry looks and ill-tempered words that he, however innocent, was\r\nthe object of their irritation.  He had never been a favourite before,\r\nbut it certainly was not pleasant to have to learn now by the most\r\nunmistakable signs that he was downrightly unpopular and disliked by\r\nthose from whom he should have had his warmest backing up.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, strange to say, it was this sense of his own unpopularity which\r\nmore than anything nerved him to a resolution to stick to his post, and,\r\ncome what would of it, do his best to discharge his new unwelcome tasks.\r\nIf only he could feel a little more sure of himself!  But how was it\r\nlikely he could feel sure of himself after his lamentable failure of the\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nBut the lamentable failure of the morning, as it happened, was nothing\r\nto other failures speedily to follow on this same unlucky day.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Riddell back in his study after first school, hoping for a\r\nlittle breathing space in which to recover his fluttered spirits, when\r\nGilks entered and said, "I say, there\'s a row going on in the Fourth.\r\nYou\'d better stop it, or the doctor will be down on us."\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he vanished, leaving the captain about as comfortable with\r\nthis piece of intelligence as he would have been with a bombshell\r\nsuddenly pitched into his study.\r\n\r\nA row in the Fourth! the headquarters of the Limpets, each one of whom\r\nwas a stronger man than he, and whom Wyndham himself had often been put\r\nto it to keep within bounds!\r\n\r\nWith an ominous shiver Riddell put on his cap and sallied out in the\r\ndirection of the Fourth.  A man about to throw himself over a precipice\r\ncould hardly have looked less cheerful!\r\n\r\nGilks\'s report had certainly been well founded, for long before the\r\ncaptain reached his destination the roar of battle sounded up the\r\npassage.  It may have been an ordinary Limpet row, or it may have been a\r\nspecial diversion got up (with the connivance of one or two unfriendly\r\nmonitors) for the special benefit of the new captain.  Be that as it\r\nmay, it was a disturbance calling for instant suppression, and the idea\r\nof Riddell going to suppress it was ridiculous even to himself.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door, unnoticed by the combatants within both on account\r\nof the noise and the dust.  It was impossible to tell what the fight was\r\nabout; the blood on both sides was evidently up, and the battle, it was\r\nclear, was anything but a mock one.  Riddell stood there for some time a\r\nbewildered and unrecognised spectator.  It would be useless for him to\r\nattempt to make himself heard above all the din, and worse than useless\r\nto attempt single-handed to interpose between the combatants.  The only\r\nthing to do seemed to be to wait till the battle was over.  But then,\r\nthought Riddell, what would be the use of interfering when it was all\r\nover?  His duty was to stop it, and stop it he must!\r\n\r\nWith which resolve, and taking advantage of a momentary lull in the\r\nconflict, he advanced with a desperate effort towards a boy who appeared\r\nto be the leader of one of the two parties, and who was gesticulating\r\nand shouting at the top of his voice to encourage his followers.  This\r\nchampion did not notice the captain as he approached, and when he did,\r\nhe mistook him for one of the enemy, and sprang at him like a young\r\ntiger, knocking him over just as the ranks once more closed, and the\r\nbattle began again.\r\n\r\nWhat might have been Riddell\'s fate it would be hard to say had not a\r\nloud shout of, "Man down there!  Hold hard!" suddenly suspended\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nSuch a cry was never disregarded at Willoughby, even by the most\r\ndesperate of combatants, and every one stood now impatiently where he\r\nwas, waiting for the obstruction to regain his feet.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle which the new captain of Willoughby presented, as with\r\nscared face and dust-covered garment he rose slowly from the floor, was\r\nstrange indeed.  It was a second or two before any one recognised him,\r\nand then the boys seemed not to be sure whether it was not his ghost, so\r\nmysteriously had he appeared in their midst, coming from no one knew\r\nwhere.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the true state of affairs gradually dawned on them, a loud\r\nshout of laughter rose on every hand, and the quarrel was at once\r\nforgotten in the merriment occasioned by this wonderful apparition.\r\n\r\nRiddell, pale and agitated, stood where he was as one in a dream, from\r\nwhich he was only aroused by voices shouting out amid the laughter,\r\n"Hullo! where did you come from?  What\'s the row?  Look at him!"\r\n\r\nAt the same time fellows crowded round him and offered to brush him\r\ndown, accompanying their violent services with bursts of equally violent\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\nWith a hard effort Riddell shook himself free and stepped out of the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n"Please let me go," he said.  "I just came to say there was too much\r\nnoise, and--"\r\n\r\nBut the laughter of the Limpets drowned the rest, in the midst of which\r\nhe retired miserably to the door and escaped.\r\n\r\nIn the passage outside he met Bloomfield, with Wibberly and Game,\r\nhurrying to the scene of the riot.  They scarcely deigned to recognise\r\nhim with anything more than a half-curious, half-contemptuous glance.\r\n\r\n"Some one must stop this row!" said Bloomfield to his companions as they\r\npassed.  "The doctor will be down on us."\r\n\r\n"You stop it, Bloomfield!" said Wibberly; "they\'ll shut up for _you_."\r\n\r\nThis was all the unfortunate Riddell heard, except that in a few moments\r\nthe uproar from the Fourth Form room suddenly ceased, and was not\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\n"What did Bloomfield do this morning when he came into your room?" asked\r\nRiddell that evening of Wyndham junior, a Limpet in whom, for his\r\nbrother\'s sake, the new captain felt a special interest, and whom he\r\ninvited as often as he liked to come and prepare his lessons with him.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Wyndham, who had been one of the combatants, "he gave Watkins\r\nand Cattermole a hiding, and swore he\'d allow no removes from the\r\nLimpets\' eleven to the school second this term if there was any more\r\nrow."\r\n\r\nThis reply by no means added to Riddell\'s comfort.\r\n\r\n"Gave Cattermole and Watkins a hiding."  Fancy _his_ attempting to give\r\nCattermole and Watkins a hiding!  And not only that, he had held out\r\nsome awful threat about Limpets\' cricket, which appeared to have a\r\nmagical effect.\r\n\r\nFancy the effect of _his_ threatening to exclude a Limpet from the\r\nsecond-eleven--when it was all he knew that the school had a second-\r\neleven!\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and perplexities which had loomed before him in the\r\nmorning were closing around him now in grim earnest!  The worst he had\r\nfeared had happened, and more than the worst.  It was now proved beyond\r\nall doubt that he was utterly incompetent.  Would it not be sheer\r\nmadness in him to attempt this impossible task a day longer?\r\n\r\nThe reader has no doubt asked the same question long ago.  Of _course_\r\nit\'s madness of him to attempt it.  A muff like Riddell never _could_ be\r\ncaptain of a school, and it\'s all bosh to suppose he could be.  But, my\r\ndear reader, a muff like Riddell _was_ the captain of a school; and\r\nwhat\'s more he didn\'t give it up even after the day\'s adventures just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nRiddell was not perfect.  I know it is an unheard-of thing for a good\r\nboy in a story-book not to be perfect, and that is one reason which\r\nconvinces me this story of mine must be an impossible one.  Riddell was\r\nnot perfect.  He had a fault.  Can you believe it--he had many faults?\r\nHe even had a besetting sin, and that besetting sin was pride.  Not the\r\nsort of pride that makes you consider yourself better than your\r\nneighbours.  Riddell really couldn\'t think that even had he wished it.\r\nBut his pride was of that kind which won\'t admit of anybody to help it,\r\nwhich would sooner knock its head to bits against a stone wall than own\r\nit can\'t get through it, and which can never bring itself to say "I am\r\nbeaten," even when it is clear to all the world it is beaten.\r\n\r\nPride had had a fall this day at any rate; but it had risen again more\r\nstubborn than ever; and if Riddell went to bed that night the most\r\nunhappy boy in Willoughby, he went there also resolving more than ever\r\nto remain its captain.\r\n\r\nOther events had happened that day which, one might suppose, should have\r\nconvinced him he was attempting an impossibility.  But these must be\r\nreserved for the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOUGHBY PARLIAMENT IN SESSION.\r\n\r\nThe "Parliament" at Willoughby was one of the very old institutions of\r\nthe school.  Old, white-headed Willoughbites, when talking of their\r\nremote schooldays, would often recall their exploits "on the floor of\r\nthe house," when Pilligrew (now a Cabinet Minister) brought in his\r\nfamous bill to abolish morning chapel in winter, and was opposed by\r\nJilson (now Ambassador to the Court at Whereisit) in a speech two hours\r\nlong; or when old Coates (a grandfather, by the way, of the present\r\nbearer of that name in the school) divided the house fifteen times in\r\none afternoon on the question of presenting a requisition to the head\r\nmaster to put more treacle into the suet puddings!  They were exciting\r\ndays, and the custom had gone on flourishing up to the present.\r\n\r\nThe Willoughby Parliament was an institution which the masters of the\r\nschool wisely connived at, while holding aloof themselves from its\r\nproceedings.  There was no restraint as to the questions to be discussed\r\nor the manner and time of the discussion, provided the rules of the\r\nschool were not infringed.  The management was entirely in the hands of\r\nthe boys, who elected their own officers, and paid sixpence a term for\r\nthe privilege of a seat in the august assembly.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were regulated by certain rules handed down by long\r\ntradition according to which the business of the House was modelled as\r\nclosely as possible on the procedure of the House of Commons itself.\r\nEvery boy was supposed to represent some place or other, and marvellous\r\nwas the scouring of atlases and geography books to discover\r\nconstituencies for the young members.  There was a Government and an\r\nOpposition, of course, only in the case of the former the "Ministers"\r\nwere elected by the votes of the whole assembly, at the beginning of\r\neach session.  They were designated by the titles of their office.\r\nThere was a Premier and a Home Secretary, and a First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, and so on, and great was the pride of a Willoughbite when he\r\nfirst heard himself referred to as the Right Honourable!\r\n\r\nEverything that came before the house had to come in the form of a bill\r\nor a resolution.  Any one anxious to bring up a subject (and there was\r\nnothing to prevent the junior fag bringing in a bill if he liked)\r\nusually handed in his motion early in the session, so as to stand a good\r\nchance of getting a date for his discussion.  Later on, when more\r\nsubjects were handed in than there were evenings to debate them, the\r\norder was decided by ballot, and due notice given every Friday of the\r\nbusiness for the next evening.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of these meetings was, of course, the questions.  Any\r\none was entitled to question the "Government" on matters affecting the\r\nschool, and the putting and answering of these questions was usually the\r\nmost entertaining part of an evening\'s business.  Naturally enough, it\r\nwas not always easy to decide to whose department many of the questions\r\nasked belonged, but tradition had settled this to some extent.  The Home\r\nSecretary had to answer questions about the monitors, the First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty about the boats, the Secretary of State for War about\r\nfights, and so on, while more doubtful questions were usually first\r\nasked of the Premier, who, if he didn\'t find it convenient to answer\r\nthem, was entitled to refer the inquirer to some other member of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the meetings of the Willoughby Parliament\r\nwere occasionally more noisy than dignified, and yet there existed a\r\ncertain sense of order and respect for the "authority of the House"\r\nwhich held the members in check, and prevented the meetings from\r\ndegenerating into riots.  Another reason for the same result existed in\r\nthe doctor, who sanctioned the Parliament only as long as it was\r\nconducted in an orderly manner, and did not offend against the rules of\r\nthe school.  And a final and more terrible reason still was in the fact\r\nthat the House had the power of expelling a member who was generally\r\nobnoxious.\r\n\r\nThe session at Willoughby always opened on the Saturday after the May\r\nsports, and notice had been duly given that Parliament would assemble\r\nthis year on the usual date, and that the first business would be the\r\nelection of a Speaker and a Government.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily understand that, under present circumstances, an\r\nunusual amount of interest and curiosity centred in the opening meeting\r\nof the school senate, and at the hour of meeting the big dining-hall,\r\narranged after the model of the great House of Commons, was, in spite of\r\nthe fact that it was a summer evening, densely packed by an excited\r\nassembly of members.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys as they entered had stopped a moment to read the "order\r\npaper," which was displayed in a prominent place beside the door.  It\r\nwas crowned with notices, the first three of which gave a good idea of\r\nthe prospect of a lively evening.\r\n\r\n1.  "That the captain of the school be elected Speaker of this House."\r\nProposed by T.  Fairbairn; seconded by E.  Coates.\r\n\r\n2.  "That Mr Bloomfield be elected Speaker of this House."  Proposed by\r\nG.  Game; seconded by R.  Ashley.\r\n\r\n3.  "That Francis Cusack, Esquire, member for the Isle of Wight, be\r\nelected Speaker of this House."  Proposed, A.  Pilbury, Esquire;\r\nseconded, L.  Philpot, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe humour of the last notice was eclipsed by the seriousness of the\r\nother two.  It had always been taken for granted that the captain of\r\nWilloughby was also the Speaker of the House, and a contested election\r\nfor that office was without precedent.  Now, however, the old rule was\r\nto be challenged; and as the members waited for the clock to strike six\r\nthey discussed the coming contest among themselves with a solemnity\r\nwhich could hardly have been surpassed in Westminster itself.\r\n\r\nThe clock sounded at last; every one was in his place.  The seniors sat\r\nranged on the front benches on either side of the table, and the others\r\ncrowded the benches behind them, impatiently waiting for the proceedings\r\nto commence.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom, Riddell, as captain of the school, rose, and\r\nbriefly proposed, "That Mr Isaacs, Senior Limpet, be requested to\r\npreside until after the election of a Speaker."\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the captain to move this resolution had always been\r\nthe signal for a loud ovation from the House.  But this year the cheers\r\nwere confined to a very small cluster of schoolhouse boys, and died away\r\nlanguidly in the general silence which prevailed elsewhere.  Riddell\'s\r\nmotion being seconded and carried, Mr Isaacs, a pallid unintelligent-\r\nlooking Limpet, rose and advanced to the chair at the end of the table\r\nusually occupied by the Chairman of Committees, and, knocking with a\r\nhammer once or twice, demanded silence.  This being secured, he called\r\nout, "Mr Fairbairn!" and sat down.\r\n\r\nFairbairn\'s speech was brief and to the point.\r\n\r\n"I beg to move that the captain of the school be elected Speaker of this\r\nHouse.  I don\'t know that I need say anything in support of this."\r\n("Oh, oh!" from a voice opposite.) "The captain always has been Speaker,\r\nand Mr Riddell has already taken an active part in the business of the\r\nhouse and knows what the Speaker\'s duties are.  We all miss old\r\nWyndham,"--(loud cheers)--"but I\'m sure Riddell will be a worthy\r\nsuccessor to him in the chair of this House."\r\n\r\nCoates having said, "I beg to second the motion," Mr Isaacs put it to\r\nthe meeting, and asked if there was any amendment.  Whereupon Game rose,\r\namid loud cheers from all quarters.\r\n\r\nGame, as has already been said, was an honest fellow.  He meant what he\r\nsaid, and generally said what he meant.  He was fully convinced in his\r\nown mind that Willoughby would go to the dogs under the new captain, and\r\ntherefore if Riddell had been his own twin-brother he would have\r\nprotested against him all the same.\r\n\r\n"I beg to move an amendment," he said, "and it is this: That Mr\r\nBloomfield be appointed Speaker of this House instead of Mr Riddell."\r\n(It will be noticed by the way that when Willoughby sat in Parliament\r\neverybody was "Mr") "And the reason I do so is because I consider Mr\r\nBloomfield ought to be captain of the school instead of Mr Riddell.\r\n(Loud Parrett cheers.)  I\'ve nothing to say against Mr Riddell--(cheers\r\nfrom the schoolhouse)--except that I don\'t consider he\'s the right man\r\nin the right place.  (Great applause.)  He\'s been made captain against\r\nour wishes,"--("Hear, hear," and "Oh, oh!")--"and we can\'t help it.  But\r\nwe\'re not obliged to have him captain here, and what\'s more, we don\'t\r\nmean to!  (Terrific cheers, especially from the juniors.)  Mr\r\nBloomfield\'s our man.  Only to-day he stopped a row in the Fourth in two\r\nminutes which Mr Riddell couldn\'t have stopped if he\'d stayed till\r\nnow."  (Laughter, and cries of "Give him a clothes-brush!") "The fellows\r\nall look up to Mr Bloomfield.  He ran grandly for the school at the\r\nsports the other day, and licked the London fellow.  (Here the\r\nenthusiasm became positively deafening.)  What\'s Mr Riddell done for\r\nthe school?  I should like to know.  We want a fellow who has done\r\nsomething for the school, and, I repeat, Mr Bloomfield\'s our man, and I\r\nhope you\'ll elect him Speaker."\r\n\r\nGame sat down amidst a tempest of applause, which brought a flush of\r\npleasure even to his serious face.\r\n\r\nMany curious eyes were turned to Riddell to see the effect of this\r\nuncomplimentary oration upon him.\r\n\r\nAt first he had looked nervous and uncomfortable, and had even whispered\r\nto Fairbairn, who sat next him, "Don\'t you think I\'d better go?"\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, no!" exclaimed Fairbairn.  "Don\'t be a fool,\r\nRiddell."\r\n\r\nThe caution had its weight.  Riddell saw he must brave it out; and that\r\nbeing settled, he felt more comfortable, and listened to all the\r\nunpleasant things that were said in a composed manner which greatly\r\nperplexed his adversaries.\r\n\r\nAshley, who seconded Game\'s motion, was hardly so fortunate in his\r\nremarks as his predecessor.\r\n\r\n"I second the motion, gentlemen," he said.  "It\'s time we made a stand\r\nagainst this sort of thing."  ("What sort of thing?" from voices on the\r\nschoolhouse side.) "Why, schoolhouse tyranny.  (Frantic Parrett cheers.)\r\nWhy is the whole credit of Willoughby to be sacrificed for the sake of\r\nyour precious schoolhouse?"  ("Question!"  "Order!" drowned by renewed\r\ncheers.) "Why, just because he\'s a schoolhouse fellow, is a muff to be\r\nstuck over us? and just because he\'s a Parrett\'s fellow, is a splendid\r\nfellow like Mr Bloomfield to be snubbed in the face of the whole\r\nschool?  (Loud cheers.)  It\'s time Willoughby found out that Parrett is\r\nthe cock house of the school."  ("Oh! oh!" from the Welchers.) "It\'s got\r\nthe best men in it.  (Parrett cheers.)  It\'s head of the river."  ("Oh\r\nno, not yet," from Fairbairn.) "Well, it will be very soon.  It\'s ahead\r\nin everything."  ("Except intelligence," from Crossfield.) "No, I don\'t\r\neven except intelligence.  (Loud cheers from Bosher, and laughter.)\r\nAnd, as a sign of its intelligence, I beg to second the motion."\r\n\r\nThis abrupt and somewhat vague termination to Ashley\'s spirited address\r\ndid not detract from the applause with which it was greeted by his own\r\npartisans, or from the wrath with which it was received by the\r\nschoolhouse boys.\r\n\r\nThe moment he sat down Crossfield sprang to his feet.  This was the\r\nsignal for loud schoolhouse cheers, and for general attention from all\r\nquarters, for Crossfield usually had something to say worth listening\r\nto.\r\n\r\n"Mr Limpet, sir,"--(loud laughter; Isaacs, who had been drawing niggers\r\non the paper before him, started, and blushed very much to find himself\r\nthus appealed to)--"I am sure we are all much obliged to the honourable\r\nmember who has just sat down for the `sign of intelligence\' he has just\r\nfavoured us with.  (Laughter.)  We\'ve been looking for it for a long\r\ntime--(laughter)--and it\'s come at last!  (Cheers and laughter.)  Sir,\r\nit would be a great pity to let such an occasion pass without notice.\r\nI\'m not sure that the doctor might not think it worth a half-holiday.  A\r\nsign of intelligence from the hon. gentleman!  And what is the sign,\r\nsir?  (Laughter.)  The hon. member seconds the motion."  ("Hear, hear!"\r\nfrom Parrett\'s.) "Gentlemen of the same party say `Hear, hear!\' as much\r\nas to say, `We, too, show signs of intelligence!\'  Do you really,\r\ngentlemen?  I could not have believed it.  (Loud laughter.)  Why does he\r\nsecond the motion?  Because he\'s a Parrett\'s boy, and Mr Bloomfield is\r\na Parrett\'s boy, and all Parrett\'s boys say a Parrett\'s boy ought to be\r\nthe head of the school!  Gentlemen, parrots aren\'t always to be trusted,\r\neven when they show signs of intelligence!  (Cheers and laughter.)\r\nDon\'t you believe all a parrot tells you about parrots.  (Laughter.)  I\r\nprefer the arguments of the gentleman who moved the amendment.  He says\r\nhe doesn\'t think Mr Riddell is fit to be captain.  (Cheers.)  I agree\r\nwith him--(tremendous Parrett\'s cheers, and consternation of\r\nschoolhouse)--I don\'t think Mr Riddell is fit to be captain.  He\r\ndoesn\'t think so himself."  ("Hear, hear!" from Riddell, and laughter.)\r\n"But the gentleman says Mr Bloomfield is the man.  (Loud cheers.)  I\r\ndon\'t agree with that at all.  Mr Riddell knows very little about\r\nsports, though I do hear he was seen coxing a schoolhouse boat this\r\nmorning.  (Derisive cheers.)  Mr Bloomfield knows almost as little\r\nabout classics!  (Loud laughter from the schoolhouse.)  Why, gentlemen,\r\ndo you mean to say you think a fellow who couldn\'t translate `Balbus\r\nhopped over a wall\' without looking up three words in a lexicon is fit\r\nto be a Willoughby captain?"  (Laughter from the juniors, and cries of\r\n"Time!" from Parretts.) "I say not.  Even though he\'s a Parrett\'s boy,\r\nand therefore can show a sign of intelligence!  (Laughter.)  No; what I\r\nsay is, whether we believe in him or not, Mr Riddell is captain; and\r\nuntil you can show me a less bad one, I\'ll vote for him."\r\n\r\nThis oration, delivered with great animation and amidst constant\r\nlaughter, helped to put the meeting in rather better humour, all except\r\nthe Parrett\'s fellows, who did not enjoy it at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, before any of them could make up his mind to reply, a shrill\r\nvoice was heard from the other end of the hall, "Sir!  It is time the\r\nWelchers had a word!"\r\n\r\nThis innocent announcement caused a loud burst of laughter, in which\r\nevery one joined, especially when it was discovered that the orator was\r\nnone other than the youthful Mr Pilbury himself!\r\n\r\nHe stood surrounded by a small cluster of admiring juniors, who glared\r\ndefiantly out on the assembly generally, and "backed up their man" till\r\nhe could hardly breathe.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well," screamed Pilbury.  (Loud cheers from Cusack and\r\nPhilpot.)  But here the chairman\'s hammer sounded and cries of "Order"\r\nchecked the orator\'s progress.\r\n\r\n"The hon. member," said Isaacs, "cannot propose his motion till the\r\nmotion before the House is disposed of."\r\n\r\nPilbury scowled fiercely at the speaker.\r\n\r\n"I _shall_ propose it," he cried, "and you\'d better shut up, old Ikey!"\r\n\r\nGame, amid much laughter, rose to order, and asked if these expressions\r\nwere parliamentary?\r\n\r\nIsaacs said, "Certainly not, and Mr Pilbury must withdraw them."\r\n\r\nMr Pilbury said "he\'d withdraw his grandmother," and attempted to\r\ncontinue his speech, when Fairbairn rose and suggested to the hon.\r\nmember that if he would only wait a bit the House would be delighted to\r\nhear him.  After this conciliatory advice Pilbury let himself be pulled\r\ndown into his seat by his admirers, and the debate on Game\'s amendment\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nIt was hot and exciting.  The arguments were mostly on the side of the\r\nschoolhouse, and the vehemence on the side of Parrett\'s.  Once or twice\r\na Welcher dropped in a speech, attacking both parties and once or twice\r\na schoolhouse boy spoke in favour of Bloomfield, or a Parrett\'s boy\r\nspoke in favour of Riddell.  At last, after about an hour\'s angry\r\ndebate, the House divided.  That is, all those in favour of Game\'s\r\namendment moved over to one side of the room, and those against it to\r\nthe other, and those who did not want to vote at all kept their seats in\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\nThere was no need to count the numbers of the rival parties as they\r\nstood.  Only about twenty-five stood beside Fairbairn and the\r\nschoolhouse, while nearly two hundred and fifty boys crowded the side of\r\nthe room along which Game and his followers took their stand.  The\r\ntriumph of the opponents to the new captain was complete, and the school\r\nhad given him and the head master a most emphatic reply to the late\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nRiddell would have much preferred to be allowed to withdraw of his own\r\naccord rather than remain to be beaten.  But his friends had all opposed\r\nthe idea as cowardly, and he had given in to them.  He now took his\r\ndefeat very placidly, and even joined in the laughter which greeted Mr\r\nIsaac\'s call.\r\n\r\n"Now, Mr Pilbury!"\r\n\r\nMr Pilbury was "off his speech."  If he had been allowed to proceed\r\nwhen he first rose, he had the steam up and could have let out, as he\r\ntold his friends; but now the spirit had been taken out of him.\r\nHowever, he was compelled to make an effort, and began as before, "Sir,\r\nit is time the Welchers had a word."\r\n\r\nHe didn\'t mean anything funny, he was certain, but everybody laughed.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t old Cusack here--" ("Order, order")--"What\'s the row?"\r\n\r\nIsaacs informed the hon. gentleman that members of that House were\r\nalways called "Mr"\r\n\r\n"Mr Cusack, then," said Pilbury, "it\'s just a dodge of Ikey to floor me\r\nin my speech.  Why shouldn\'t old Mr Cusack-- Eh, what say?"\r\n\r\nThis was addressed to Philpot, who was eagerly trying to prompt his\r\nally.\r\n\r\n"Go it, let out at them," he whispered.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t old Mr Cusack go it and let out--that is--all right,\r\nPhilpot, you pig, I\'ll pay you out, see if I don\'t.  Why shouldn\'t old\r\nMr Cusack, gentlemen--er--"\r\n\r\n"Do," suggested Cusack himself.\r\n\r\n"Do," shouted Pilbury, "do, gentlemen--do?  Why shouldn\'t--(all right,\r\nGus Telson, I see you chucking darts)--why shouldn\'t old Mr Cusack--"\r\n\r\n"Does any gentleman second the amendment?" asked Mr Isaacs, evidently\r\ngetting hungry and anxious to be released from his post.\r\n\r\n"Yes," shouted Philpot, "Mr Gentlemen, yes, I do--and--"\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit, you howling cad," exclaimed Pilbury, in excitement.  "I\'ve\r\nnot done yet!"\r\n\r\n"Mr Philpot!" said Mr Isaacs.\r\n\r\n"Philpot be blowed," cried the irate Pilbury, "wait till I\'m done."\r\n\r\n"Order, order," shouted members on all sides.\r\n\r\n"Moved by Mr Pilbury, seconded by Mr Philpot," began Isaacs.\r\n\r\n"Easy all," cried Philpot, "I\'ve not spoken yet."\r\n\r\n"Order, order," cried Isaacs.\r\n\r\n"Order yourself," retorted Philpot, "I\'ve got a right to speak."\r\n\r\n"So have I," said Pilbury, "and I was up first."\r\n\r\n"Forge away," said Philpot, "you\'ll be all right."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to do with you if I _am_ all right," snarled Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"You seem to think you\'re the only fellow can talk."\r\n\r\n"Ays to the right, noes to the left," said Isaacs, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nThe House instantly divided, and before either Pilbury or Philpot could\r\nmake up their minds about proceeding, the motion had been declared lost\r\nby a majority of three hundred odd to one.\r\n\r\nIn a great state of wrath the injured Welchers left the hall, making as\r\nmuch noise as they possibly could in doing so.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Isaacs put the question that Bloomfield be\r\nelected Speaker, and this was carried without a division, the\r\nschoolhouse fellows not caring to demand one.\r\n\r\nAmid loud and long-continued cheers the new Speaker took his seat, and\r\nas soon as silence could be restored, said, "I\'m much obliged to you all\r\nfor your vote.  I hope Willoughby won\'t go down.  I\'ll try to prevent it\r\nfor one.  (Loud cheers.)  I\'m very proud to be elected your Speaker, and\r\nfeel it quite as much honour as if I was captain of the school."  (Loud\r\ncries of "So you are!"--from Parrett\'s.) "In reference to what one\r\ngentleman said about me, I hope you won\'t believe it.  I\'m twelfth in\r\nclassics.  (Laughter from the schoolhouse and terrific applause from\r\nParrett\'s.)  That\'s all I have to say."\r\n\r\nThe remaining business of the afternoon was dull compared with what had\r\ngone before.  The elections for the various posts in the Government did\r\nnot excite very much enthusiasm, especially among the juniors, who\r\ndeserted the meeting soon after they began.  After what had occurred it\r\nis hardly to be wondered at that the partisans of Bloomfield and the\r\nParretts had the matter pretty much in their own hands, and used it to\r\ntheir own advantage.  When the list was finally declared, it was found\r\nthat only one schoolhouse fellow, Porter, had a place in the "Cabinet."\r\nHe was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Game was First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, Wibberly, War Secretary, Ashley, Home Secretary, and\r\nStrutter, a comparatively obscure boy, Premier.  All these, as well as\r\nthe other officers appointed, were Parrett\'s fellows, who may have\r\nflattered themselves their election was a simple recognition of merit in\r\neach case, but who, taken altogether, were a long way off being the most\r\ndistinguished boys of Willoughby.\r\n\r\nParliament did not adjourn till a late hour that evening, and no one was\r\nparticularly sorry when it did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA SCIENTIFIC AFTERNOON IN WELCH\'S.\r\n\r\n"Pil," said Cusack, a few days after the unfortunate end to that\r\ngentleman\'s "motion" in Parliament--"Pil, it strikes me we can do pretty\r\nmuch as we like these times.  What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," said Pil, meditatively; "I got a pot from Coates\r\nto-day for playing fives against the schoolhouse door."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; of course, if you fool about out of doors you\'ll get potted.\r\nWhat I mean is, indoors here there\'s no one to pull us up that I can\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I see what you mean," said Pil.  "Yes, you\'re about right there."\r\n\r\n"Gully, you know," continued Cusack--"Gully\'s no good as master of a\r\nhouse; he\'s always grubbing over his books.  Bless his heart! it doesn\'t\r\nmatter to him whether we cut one another\'s throats!"\r\n\r\n"Not it!  I dare say he\'d be rather glad if we did," replied Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s Tucker.  No fear of his reporting us, eh!"\r\n\r\n"Rather not! when he\'s always breaking rules himself, and slinking down\r\nto Shellport, and kicking up rows with the other chaps.  What do you\r\nthink I found in his brush-and-comb bag the other day?  Thirteen cigar-\r\nends!  He goes about collecting them in Shellport, I suppose, and\r\nfinishes them up on the quiet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a beast!" said Cusack.  "And old Silk\'s about as bad.  He\r\ndoesn\'t care a bit what we do as long as he enjoys himself.  Don\'t\r\nsuppose he\'d be down on us, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No fear!  He might pot us now and then for appearances\' sake, but he\r\nwouldn\'t report us, I guess."\r\n\r\n"And suppose he did," said Cusack; "the new captain\'s as big a muff as\r\nall the lot of them put together.  He\'s afraid to look at a chap.\r\nDidn\'t you hear what he did to the Parrett\'s kids the other day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; didn\'t I!" exclaimed Pilbury.  "He let them all off, and begged\r\ntheir pardons or something.  But I\'m jolly glad Parrett was down on\r\nthem.  He\'s stopped their river-play, and they won\'t be able to show up\r\nat the regatta."\r\n\r\n"I\'m jolly glad!" said Cusack; "chaps like them deserve to catch it,\r\ndon\'t they, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" replied Pilbury.\r\n\r\nA silence ensued, during which both heroes were doubtless meditating\r\nupon the unexampled iniquities of the Parrett juniors.\r\n\r\nPresently Pilbury observed somewhat dolefully, "Beastly slow, isn\'t it,\r\nCusack?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s beastly slow?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, everything!  No fun kicking up a row if there\'s no one to pull you\r\nup.  I\'m getting sick of rows."\r\n\r\nCusack stared at his friend with rather concerned looks.  He could not\r\nbe well, surely, or he would never come out with sentiments like those.\r\n\r\n"Fact is," continued Pilbury, contemplatively balancing himself on one\r\nfoot on the corner of the fender, "I\'ve half a notion to go in for being\r\nsteady this term, old man, just for a change."\r\n\r\nAs if to suit the action to the word, the fender suddenly capsized under\r\nhim, and shot him head first into the waistcoat of his friend.\r\n\r\nCusack solemnly restored him to his feet and replied, "Rather a rum\r\nstart, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Pilbury, examining his shin to see if it had been grazed by\r\nthe treacherous fender, "I don\'t see what else there is to do.  Any chap\r\ncan fool about.  I\'m fagged of fooling about; ain\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Cusack, doubtfully.  "It\'s not such a lark as it\r\nused to be, certainly."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to going it steady this term?" asked Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"Depends on what you mean by `steady.\'  If you mean never going out of\r\nbounds or using cribs, I\'m not game."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mean that, you know," said Pilbury.  "What I mean is,\r\nshutting up rows, and that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"What can a fellow do?" asked Cusack, dubiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, lots to do, you know," said Pilbury--"dominoes, you know, or\r\nspellicans.  I\'ve got a box at home."\r\n\r\n"Jolly slow always playing dominoes," said Cusack, "or spellicans."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, there\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Hold hard!" broke in Cusack, struck with a sudden idea.  "What\'s the\r\nname of the thing old Philpot\'s always at?"\r\n\r\n"What, chemistry?  Jolly good idea, old man!  Let\'s go in for that."\r\n\r\n"Not a bad lark," said Cusack--"lots of explosions and things.  Philpot\r\ntold me he could make Pharaoh\'s serpents, and smells like rotten eggs.\r\nWe\'ll get him to coach us, eh, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m game," said Pil, no less delighted than his friend at this happy\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAnd, full of their new idea of "going it steady," the two worthies\r\nforthwith sallied out and made hue and cry for Philpot.\r\n\r\nUnless Philpot in his leisure moments was engaged in some predatory\r\nexpedition, or happened to be serving a term of imprisonment in the\r\ndetention room, it was a pretty safe guess to look for him in the\r\nlaboratory, where as an ardent student of science he was permitted to\r\nresort, and within certain limits practise for himself.  Philpot himself\r\nbore the office of "second under bottle-washer" in Willoughby; that is,\r\nhe assisted the boy who assisted the chemistry fag who assisted the\r\nassistant master to the science master; and _on_ the strength of this\r\ndistinction he was allowed some special privileges in the way of\r\nimproving himself in his favourite branch of study.  He was on the whole\r\nrather a promising pupil, and had a very fair idea of the properties of\r\nthe several substances he was allowed to experiment with.  Indeed he had\r\nhad to pass an examination and perform some experiments in the presence\r\nof the master before he was allowed to enter the laboratory as a private\r\nstudent at all.  No one knew exactly how he distinguished himself on\r\nthat occasion, or how he succeeded with his experiments, but it was\r\nwell-known that, if he had succeeded then, he had never done so since;\r\nthat is, according to anybody\'s idea but his own.\r\n\r\nCusack and Pilbury found him busy blowing through a tube into a bottle\r\nof water, looking very like a purple cherub bursting at the cheeks.  He\r\nwas so engrossed with his task that he did not even notice their entry,\r\nindeed it was not till Pilbury had stepped behind him and clapped him\r\nsuddenly on either side of the face, making his cheeks explode like a\r\nsmall balloon, and spilling the contents of his bottle all over the\r\ntable, that he became aware that he had visitors.  "What a frightful\r\nidiot you are, Pilbury!" he exclaimed; "you\'ve spoilt that whole\r\nexperiment.  I wish you\'d shut up fooling and get out."\r\n\r\n"Awfully sorry, old man," said Pilbury, "but you did look so jolly\r\npuffed out, you know; didn\'t he, Cusack?"\r\n\r\n"Now you\'ve done, you\'d better hook it," said Philpot, "you\'ve not got\r\nleave to come here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t be riled," said Cusack; "the fact is, Pil and I came to see\r\nif you\'d put us up to a thing or two in this sort of business."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve gone on the steady, Phil, you know," explained Pilbury, in\r\nconciliatory tones, "and thought it would be rather jolly if we three\r\nworked up a little chemistry together."\r\n\r\n"We\'d watch you do the things at first, of course," said Cusack, "till\r\nwe twigged all the dodges."\r\n\r\n"And it would be jolly good practice for you, you know, in case ever old\r\nMix-\'em-up is laid up, and you have to lecture instead."\r\n\r\nPhilpot regarded his two would-be pupils doubtfully, but softened\r\nconsiderably as they went on.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to promise not to fool," said he, presently, "or there\'ll\r\nbe a row."\r\n\r\n"Oh, rather; we won\'t touch anything without asking, will we, Pil?"\r\nreplied Cusack.  "Awfully brickish of you, Philpot."\r\n\r\nPhilpot took the compliment very complacently, and the two students\r\nsettled themselves one on either side of the table and waited for\r\noperations to begin.\r\n\r\n"Wire in, old man," said Pilbury, encouragingly; "cut all the jaw, you\r\nknow, and start with the experiments.  Can\'t you give us a jolly flare-\r\nup to begin with?"\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Philpot, who had now quite recovered his humour, and\r\nwas pleased to find himself in the position of an instructor of youth,\r\n"wait a bit, then."\r\n\r\nHe reached down from a shelf a large saucer containing water, in which\r\nlay a round substance rather like the end of a stick of peppermint-rock.\r\nOn this Philpot began to operate with a pair of scissors, greatly to\r\nthe amusement of his spectators, for try all he would he couldn\'t get\r\nhold of it.\r\n\r\n"What are you trying to do?" said Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Cut a bit off," said Philpot, trying to stick the substance with a long\r\nbodkin, in order to hold it steady.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s not the way to cut it, you old dolt," said Pilbury.  "Here,\r\nI\'ll do it," and he advanced to the saucer.\r\n\r\n"What\'ll you do?"\r\n\r\n"Why, fish it out, of course, and cut it then."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not try.  It\'s phosphorus."\r\n\r\n"Is it, though--and what does it do?"\r\n\r\n"Burn you, rather, unless you keep it in water.  Ah, got him at last."\r\n\r\nSo saying Philpot triumphantly spiked the obstinate piece of phosphorus,\r\nand succeeded in cutting off a small piece.\r\n\r\n"Is that what makes the flare-up?" asked Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, wait a bit, till I get the jar."\r\n\r\n"What jar?" asked Pilbury.  "Here\'s one; will this do?"\r\n\r\n"Look out, I say!" exclaimed Philpot, in great excitement; "let it go,\r\nwill you?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the row?" asked Pilbury and Cusack, both in alarm.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s got my oxygen in it," cried Philpot, securing the bottle\r\nand gently lifting it on to the table, taking care to hold the glass\r\nplate that covered the mouth in its place.\r\n\r\n"Got his what in it?" asked Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Oxygen.  It took me an hour to get."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing in that empty jar," said Pilbury, laughing.  "Isn\'t\r\nthere, though?" said Philpot; "it\'s full."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say that jar\'s full of something," said Cusack.  "Look\r\nhere, don\'t you try to stuff us up.  What\'s the use of saying it\'s full\r\nwhen it\'s empty?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s full of gas, I tell you," said Philpot.  "Don\'t you talk till you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nThis rebuke somewhat silenced the two devotees of science, who, however,\r\ncontinued to regard the jar sceptically and rather contemptuously.\r\n\r\nPhilpot next dived into a drawer and drew from it a large cork, through\r\nwhich passed a long wire having a small cup at the lower end.\r\n\r\n"Now look out," he said.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to shovel the small piece of phosphorus into the little cup\r\nunder the cork, and drawing it out of the water, applied a light.  The\r\nphosphorus lit up immediately, and at the same instant he slipped the\r\nglass plate off the mouth of the oxygen jar, and clapped the cork, with\r\nthe wire and cup hanging down from it, in its place.  The effect was\r\nmagical.  The moment the phosphorus was introduced into the oxygen it\r\nflared up with a brilliancy that perfectly dazzled the spectators, and\r\nmade the entire jar look like one mass of light.\r\n\r\nThe two pupils were delighted; Philpot was complacently triumphant; when\r\nall of a sudden there was a loud report, the illumination suddenly\r\nceased, and the jar, broken to pieces, collapsed.\r\n\r\nPilbury and Cusack, who at the first alarm had retreated somewhat\r\nsuddenly to the door, returned as soon as they perceived there was no\r\ndanger, and were profuse in their praises of the experiment and the\r\nexperimenter.\r\n\r\n"Awfully prime, that was!" cried Cusack; "wasn\'t it, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"Stunning!" said Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"Jolly grind that jar bursting up, though," said Philpot, with a\r\ntroubled countenance.\r\n\r\n"Why, wasn\'t that part of the show-off?" asked Pilbury.  "Part of the\r\nshow-off!  No!" exclaimed Philpot.  "I thought it was the best part of\r\nit all," said Cusack.  "So did I.  No end of a bust up it was."\r\n\r\n"You see," said Philpot, solemnly, "what I ought to have done was to\r\ndilute the oxygen with a little air first, but you fellows flurried me\r\nso I forgot all about it."\r\n\r\n"Jolly glad you did, or we\'d have missed the bust up," said Cusack.  "I\r\nsay, can\'t we try now?  I know the way to do it quite well."\r\n\r\nBut this proposal Philpot flatly declined to accede to, and could only\r\nappease their disappointment by promising to perform one other\r\nexperiment for their benefit.\r\n\r\nThis was of rather an elaborate nature.  The operator first placed in a\r\nsaucer some stuff which he explained was iodine.  On to this he poured\r\nfrom a small bottle which smelt uncommonly like smelling-salts a small\r\nquantity of liquid, and then proceeded to stir the concoction up.\r\n\r\nThe two students were not to be restrained from offering their services\r\nat this point, and Philpot yielded.  After they had stirred to their\r\nhearts\' content, Philpot ordered them to desist and let it stand a bit.\r\n\r\nThis they consented to do, and occupied the interval in taking down and\r\nsmelling all the bottles within reach, with a hardihood that frightened\r\nthe wits out of poor Philpot.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said, when presently Pilbury suddenly dropped one bottle\r\nwith a crash to the floor, and began violently spitting and choking,\r\n"you promised you wouldn\'t touch anything, and I\'ll shut up if you go on\r\nfooling any more.  Serves you right, Pil, so it does."\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the unfortunate Pil recovered from the results\r\nof his unlucky experiment, and even when he did, the odours from the\r\nbroken bottle were so offensive that the windows had to be opened wide\r\nbefore the atmosphere of the room became tolerable.  It wouldn\'t have\r\ntaken so long, only it was deemed advisable to shut the door at the same\r\ntime to prevent the smell getting outside and telling tales to the\r\nschool at large.\r\n\r\nBy the time this pleasant diversion was disposed of the concoction in\r\nthe saucer had recovered from its stirring, and Philpot declared it was\r\nready to go ahead with.\r\n\r\nHe therefore placed another saucer upside down upon this one, and\r\ncarefully strained off between the two all the liquid, leaving only a\r\nblack powder in the saucer, which he announced was iodide of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n"Jolly rum name," said Cusack, "what does it do?"\r\n\r\n"You wait a bit," said Philpot, scooping the wet powder up with the end\r\nof a knife and spreading it out on small separate pieces of paper.\r\n\r\n"Fellow\'s born a chemist," said Pilbury, watching him admiringly;\r\n"that\'s just what old Joram does at the dispensary.  What\'s all the\r\nspread out for?"\r\n\r\n"To dry it," said Philpot.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you stick it on the shovel and hold it over the gas?"\r\nsuggested Cusack.  "Jolly fag waiting till it dries itself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it won\'t be long," said Philpot.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s it going to do when it\'s done?" asked Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Hope it\'ll flare-up like the other," said Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"It ought to," said Philpot.\r\n\r\n"Ought it?  Hurrah!  I say, Cusack, what a jolly clever beggar old Phil\r\nis, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said the admiring Cusack, perching himself on the side of the\r\ntable and swinging his legs to pass the time.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Philpot, condescendingly, "it only wants a little practice."\r\n\r\n"Rather; I mean to practise hard, don\'t you, Cusack?"\r\n\r\nCusack said, Yes he did, and proceeded to prowl round the laboratory in\r\na manner that made Philpot very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to all parties when the powders were at last pronounced\r\nto be dry.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Philpot, taking up one of the small papers gently on the\r\nflat of his hand, "we shall have to be careful."\r\n\r\n"That little lot won\'t make half a flare," suggested Pilbury; "let\'s\r\nhave two or three at once."\r\n\r\nSo saying he lifted up one of the other papers and emptied its contents\r\ninto the paper on Philpot\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Look out," said Philpot, "it\'ll blow up."\r\n\r\n"Eh, what?" cried Cusack, jumping off the table in his excitement at the\r\nglorious news.\r\n\r\nAs he did so Philpot uttered a cry, which was accompanied by a loud\r\ncrackling explosion, and a dense volume of blue smoke, which made the\r\nboys turn pale with terror.  For a moment neither of them could move or\r\nutter a sound except Philpot, who danced round and round the room in the\r\nsmoke howling and wringing his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen at last they did recover presence of mind enough to inquire of\r\ntheir preceptor if he was injured, it was in tones of terrible alarm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Phil, old man, are you hurt?  What was it?  We\'re so awfully sorry.\r\nIs your hand blown off?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Philpot, continuing to wring his injured hand, but otherwise\r\nconsiderably recovered, "it was your fault jumping off the table.  The\r\nbeastly stuff goes off almost if you look at it.  It\'s lucky it wasn\'t\r\nall dry, or I might have had my eyes out!"\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to find matters were no worse, and that in a very\r\nfew minutes Philpot\'s hand had recovered from the smart of the\r\nexplosion.  This accident, however, decided the young enthusiasts that\r\nfor the present they had perhaps had enough chemistry for one lesson.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, however, they had all sufficiently got over the shock of\r\nthe last afternoon\'s experiments to decide on a fresh venture, and these\r\nlessons continued, on and off, during the rest of the term.  It can\r\nhardly be said that by the end of the term Pilbury or Cusack knew any\r\nmore about chemistry than they had known this first day.  They\r\npersistently refused to listen to any of Philpot\'s "jaw," as they rudely\r\ntermed his attempts at explanation, and confined themselves to the\r\nexperiments.  However, though in many respects they wasted their time\r\nover their new pursuit, these volatile youths might have been a good\r\ndeal worse employed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if every Welcher had been no worse employed that house would\r\nnot have brought all the discredit on Willoughby which it did.  As it\r\nwas, everybody there seemed to follow his own sweet will without a\r\nsingle thought for the good of the school or the welfare of his fellows.\r\nThe heads of the house, Tucker and Silk, did not even attempt to set a\r\ngood example, and that being so, it was hardly to be expected those\r\nbelow them would be much interested to supply the deficiencies.\r\n\r\nOn the very afternoon when Pilbury and Cusack had been sitting at the\r\nfeet of the learned Philpot in the laboratory, Silk, a monitor, had,\r\nalong with Gilks, of the schoolhouse, a monitor too, gone down to\r\nShellport, against all rules, taking Wyndham junior, one of their\r\nspecial _proteges_, with them.\r\n\r\nThey appeared to be pretty familiar with the ins and outs of the big\r\ntown, and though on this occasion they occupied their time in no more\r\ndisgraceful a way than waiting on the harbour pier to see the mail\r\nsteamer come in, they yet felt, all three of them, as if they would by\r\nno means like to be seen by any one who knew them.\r\n\r\nAnd it appeared as if they were going to be spared this embarrassment,\r\nfor they encountered no one they knew till they were actually on their\r\nway home.\r\n\r\nThen, just as they were passing the station door, they met, to their\r\nhorror, a boy in a college cap just coming out with a parcel under his\r\narm.  To their astonishment, it proved to be no other than Riddell\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nRiddell, who had come down by a special "permit" from the doctor to get\r\na parcel--containing, by the way, his new boating flannels--at first\r\nlooked as astonished and uncomfortable as the three truants themselves.\r\nHe would sooner have had anything happen to him than such a meeting.\r\nHowever, as usual, his sense of duty came to his rescue.\r\n\r\nHe advanced to the group in a nervous manner, and, addressing Wyndham,\r\nsaid, hurriedly, "Please come to my room this evening, Wyndham," and\r\nthen, without waiting for a reply, or staying to notice the ominous\r\nlooks of the two monitors, he departed, and proceeded as fast as he\r\ncould back to Willoughby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nWYNDHAM JUNIOR AND HIS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nWyndham, the old captain, just before leaving Willoughby, had done his\r\nbest to interest Riddell in the welfare of his young brother, a Limpet\r\nin the Fourth.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d look after him now and then, Riddell," he said; "he\'s not\r\na bad fellow, I fancy, but he\'s not got quite enough ballast on board,\r\nand unless there\'s some one to look after him he\'s very likely to get\r\ninto bad hands."\r\n\r\nRiddell promised he would do his best, and the elder brother was most\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\n"I shall be ever so much easier _now_," he said, "and it\'s awfully good\r\nof you, Riddell.  I wouldn\'t care for the young \'un to go wrong, you\r\nknow.  Thanks very much, old man."\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that among the legacies which the old captain\r\nleft behind him at Willoughby, the one which fell to Riddell was a young\r\nbrother, slightly rickety in character and short of ballast.\r\n\r\nA parting request like Wyndham\'s would have been very hard for any\r\nfriend to refuse; but to Riddell the promise "to look after young\r\nWyndham" meant a great deal more than it would have done to many other\r\nfellows.  It was not enough for him to make occasional inquiries as to\r\nhis young _protege_, or even to try to shield him when he fell into\r\nscrapes.  Riddell\'s idea of looking after a rickety youngster included a\r\ngood deal more than this, and from the moment the old captain had left,\r\namid all his _own_ tribulations and adversities, the thought of young\r\nWyndham had saddled itself on Riddell\'s conscience with an uncomfortable\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThis was the reason why he made the boy free of his study, and gave up a\r\ngood deal of his own time in helping him with his work.  And it was the\r\nsame reason which prompted him on the afternoon spoken of in the last\r\nchapter, much against his inclination, to accost the three truants in\r\nShellport, and request Wyndham to come to his study.\r\n\r\n"You\'re in for a nice sermon, my boy," said Gilks, as the three walked\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n"I wish he hadn\'t seen us," said Wyndham, feeling uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t suppose he\'ll lick you?" said Silk, laughing.\r\n\r\n"No, but he\'ll be awfully vexed."\r\n\r\n"Vexed!" cried Gilks.  "Poor fellow!  How I\'d like to comfort him!  Take\r\nmy advice and forget all about going to his study.  He\'ll not be sorry,\r\nI can tell you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must go," said Wyndham.  "I don\'t want to offend him."\r\n\r\n"Kind of you," said Silk, laughing.  "Funny thing how considerate a\r\nfellow can be to another fellow who does his lessons for him."\r\n\r\nWyndham blushed, but said nothing.  He knew these two companions were\r\nnot the sort of boys his brother would have cared to have him associate\r\nwith, nor did he particularly like them himself.  But when two senior\r\nboys take the trouble to patronise a junior and make fun of his\r\n"peculiarities," as they called his scruples, it is hardly surprising\r\nthat the youngster comes out a good way to meet his patrons.\r\n\r\nWyndham, by the way, was rather more than a youngster.  He was a Limpet,\r\nand looked back on the days of fagging as a long-closed chapter of his\r\nhistory.  Had he been a junior like Telson or Pilbury, it would have\r\nbeen less likely either that Game and Silk would take such trouble to\r\ncultivate his acquaintance, or that he would submit himself so easily to\r\ntheir patronage.  As it was, he was his own master.  Nobody had a right\r\nto demand his services, neither had he yet attained to the\r\nresponsibilities of a monitor.  He could please himself, and therefore\r\nyielded himself unquestioningly to the somewhat flattering attentions of\r\nthe two seniors.\r\n\r\nNo, not quite unquestioningly.  Short as was the time since his brother\r\nhad left, it had been long enough for Riddell to let the boy see that he\r\nwished to be his friend.  He had never told him so in words, but Wyndham\r\ncould guess what all the kind interest which the new captain evinced in\r\nhim meant.  And it was the thought of this that kept alive the one or\r\ntwo scruples he still retained in joining himself to the society of\r\nGilks and Silk.\r\n\r\nAnd so he declined the invitation of these two friends to defy the\r\ncaptain\'s summons.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Gilks, "if you must put your head into the lion\'s mouth,\r\nyou must, mustn\'t he, Silk?  But I say, as you _are_ to get pulled up, I\r\ndon\'t see why you shouldn\'t have all the fun you can for your money.\r\nWhat do you say to a game of skittles at Beamish\'s?"\r\n\r\n"_What_ a nice boy you are!" said Silk, laughing; "the young \'un doesn\'t\r\nknow Beamish\'s."\r\n\r\n"Not know Beamish\'s!--at the Aquarium!" said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"No.  What is he?" inquired Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"He\'s the Aquarium!" said Gilks, laughing.\r\n\r\n"And do they play skittles in the Aquarium?" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n"Rather!" said Silk; "it amuses the fishes, you know."  Beamish\'s was,\r\nas Gilks had said, another name for the Shellport Aquarium--a\r\ndisreputable place of resort, whose only title to the name of Aquarium\r\nwas that it had in it, in an obscure corner which nobody ever explored,\r\na small tank, which might have contained fishes if there had been any\r\nput into it.  As it was, the last thing any one went to Beamish\'s for\r\nwas to study fishes, the other attractions of the place--the skittles,\r\nbowls, and refreshment bars--being far more popular.  These things in\r\nthemselves, of course, were not enough to make Beamish\'s a bad place.\r\nThat character was supplied by the company that were mostly in the habit\r\nof frequenting it, of which it is enough to say it was the very reverse\r\nof select.\r\n\r\nAt this time of day, however, the place was almost empty, and when,\r\nafter a good deal of chaff and persuasion, Wyndham was induced to take a\r\nlittle turn round the place, he was surprised to find it so quiet and\r\nunobjectionable.  The boys had a short game at skittles and a short game\r\nat bowls, and bought a few buns and an ice at the refreshment stall, and\r\nthen departed schoolwards.\r\n\r\nThey reached Willoughby in good time for call-over, no one except\r\nRiddell being aware of their pleasant expedition.  Still Wyndham, when\r\nit was all _over_, did not feel altogether comfortable.  Not that he\r\nthought what he had done was very bad, or that he had sinned in\r\ndeceiving the masters and breaking the rules of the school.  What\r\ntroubled him was that he knew Riddell would be vexed.\r\n\r\nHe repaired to the captain\'s study with his books as usual after evening\r\nchapel and found him busy over his work.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the boy entered, Riddell pushed the papers away rather\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"Well, Wyndham," said he, "I\'m glad you\'ve come."\r\n\r\nWyndham deposited his books and looked rather uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nRiddell had rather hoped the boy would refer to the subject first, but\r\nhe did not.  Riddell therefore said, "I was sorry to see you down in\r\nShellport this afternoon, Wyndham.  You hadn\'t a permit, had you?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hardly the thing, is it?" said the captain, quietly, after a\r\npause.\r\n\r\nHis voice, devoid of all anger or self-importance, made Wyndham still\r\nmore uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry," said he.  "I suppose I oughtn\'t to have gone.  I\r\nbeg your pardon, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Riddell, "don\'t do that, please."\r\n\r\n"You know," said Wyndham, "as those two took me, it didn\'t seem to be\r\nmuch harm.  We only went to see the steamer come in."\r\n\r\n"The thing is," said Riddell, "it was against the rules."\r\n\r\n"But Gilks and Silk are both monitors, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"They are," said the captain, with a touch of bitterness in his tone.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause, this time a long one.  Neither boy seemed\r\ninclined to return to the subject.  Wyndham opened his books and made a\r\npretence of beginning his work, and Riddell fidgeted with the papers\r\nbefore him.  In the mind of the latter a hurried debate was going on.\r\n\r\n"What had I better do?  I might send him up to the doctor and perhaps\r\nget him expelled.  It might be the best thing for him too, for if those\r\ntwo have got hold of him he\'s sure to go wrong.  I can\'t do anything to\r\nkeep him from them.  And yet, I promised old Wynd--I must try; I might\r\nhelp to keep him straight.  God help me!"\r\n\r\nIs the reader astonished that the captain of a great public school\r\nshould so far forget himself as to utter a secret prayer in his own\r\nstudy about such a matter as the correction of a young scapegrace?  It\r\n_was_ an unusual thing to do, certainly; and probably if Wyndham had\r\nknown what was passing in the captain\'s mind he would have thought more\r\npoorly of his brother\'s friend than he did.  But I am not quite sure,\r\nreader, whether Riddell was committing such an absurdity as some persons\r\nmight think; or whether you or I, or any other fellow in a similar\r\nposition, would be any the worse for forgetting ourselves in the same\r\nway.  What do you think?  It is worth thinking over, when you have time.\r\n\r\n"God help me," said Riddell to himself, and he felt his mind wonderfully\r\ncleared already as he said it.\r\n\r\nClearer, that is, as to what he ought to do, but still rather\r\nembarrassed as to how to do it.  But he meant to try.\r\n\r\n"I say, Wyndham," he said, in his quiet way.  "I want to ask your\r\nadvice."\r\n\r\n"What about?" asked Wyndham, looking up in surprise.  "About those\r\nfellows?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly.  It\'s more about myself," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"What about you?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s a fellow in the school I\'m awfully anxious to do some good\r\nto," began Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Rather a common failing of yours," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Wanting to do it is more common than doing it," said Riddell; "but I\r\ndon\'t know how to tackle this fellow, Wyndham."\r\n\r\n"Who is he?  Do I know him?" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sure that you know him particularly well," said the captain.\r\n"He\'s not a bad fellow; in fact he has a lot of good in him."\r\n\r\n"Is he a Limpet?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"But," continued Riddell, not noticing the question, "he\'s got a horrid\r\nfault.  He won\'t stand up for himself, Wyndham."\r\n\r\n"Oh," observed Wyndham, "there\'s a lot of them like that--regular\r\ncowards they are."\r\n\r\n"Exactly, this fellow\'s one of them.  He\'s always funking it."\r\n\r\nWyndham laughed.\r\n\r\n"I know who you mean--Tedbury, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s not his name," said Riddell.  "He\'s a nicer sort of fellow\r\nthan Tedbury.  There are one or two fellows that are always down on him,\r\ntoo.  They see he\'s no pluck, and so they think they can do what they\r\nlike with him."\r\n\r\n"Meekins gets a good deal mauled about by some of the others," said\r\nWyndham.\r\n\r\n"This fellow gets a good deal more damaged than Meekins," said the\r\ncaptain.  "In fact he gets so mauled his friends will soon hardly be\r\nable to recognise him."\r\n\r\nWyndham looked sharply at the speaker.  Riddell was quite grave and\r\nserious, and proceeded quietly, "The worst of it is, this fellow\'s quite\r\nwell able to stick up for himself if he likes, and could easily hold his\r\nown.  Only he\'s lazy, or else he likes getting damaged."\r\n\r\n"Are you making all this up?" demanded Wyndham colouring.\r\n\r\nRiddell took no notice of the inquiry, but continued rather more\r\nearnestly, "Now I\'d like your advice, Wyndham, old fellow.  I want to do\r\nthis fellow a good turn.  Which do you suppose would be the best turn to\r\ndo him; to pitch into the fellows that are always doing him harm? or to\r\ntry to persuade him to stick up for himself and not let them do just\r\nwhat they like with him, eh?"\r\n\r\nWyndham had seen it all before the question was ended, and hung down his\r\nhead in silence.\r\n\r\nRiddell did not disturb him, but waited quietly, and, if truth be told,\r\nanxiously, till he should reply.\r\n\r\nPresently the boy looked up with a troubled face, and said, "I know I\'m\r\nan awful fool, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not obliged to be," said the captain, cheerily.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try not to be, I really will," said Wyndham.  "Only--"\r\n\r\n"Only what?" asked Riddell, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"Only somehow I never think of it at the time."\r\n\r\n"I know," said Riddell, kindly.\r\n\r\n"Why only this afternoon," said Wyndham, drawn out by the sympathy of\r\nhis companion, "I tried to object to going down to the town, and they\r\nmade up some excuse, so that I would have seemed like a regular prig to\r\nhold out, and so I went.  I\'m awfully sorry now.  I know I\'m a coward,\r\nRiddell; I ought to have stuck out."\r\n\r\n"I think you ought," said Riddell; "they would probably have laughed at\r\nyou, and possibly tried to bully you a bit.  But you can take care of\r\nyourself, I fancy, when it comes to that, eh?"\r\n\r\n"I can about the bullying," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"And so," said Riddell, "you really advise me to say to this fellow I\r\nwas telling you about, to stand up for himself and not let himself be\r\nled about by any one?"\r\n\r\n"Except you, Riddell," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"No," said Riddell, "not even me.  _I_ can\'t profess to tell you all you\r\nought to do."\r\n\r\n"I should like to know who can, if you can\'t?" said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"I think we both know," said Riddell, gravely.\r\n\r\nThe conversation ended here.  For an hour and a half after that each boy\r\nwas busy over his work, and neither spoke a word.  Their thoughts may\r\nnot all have been in the books before them; in fact it may safely be\r\nsaid they were not.  But they were thoughts that did not require words.\r\nOnly when Wyndham rose to go, and wished his friend good-night, Riddell\r\nindirectly referred to the subject of their talk.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Wyndham, Isaacs has given up the school librarianship; I\r\nsuppose you know.  How would you like to take it?"\r\n\r\n"What has a fellow got to do?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"You have to issue the new books every Monday and collect the old ones\r\nevery Saturday.  There are about one hundred boys subscribe, and they\r\norder the new book when they give up the old, so it\'s simple enough."\r\n\r\n"Takes a lot of time, doesn\'t it?" said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"No, not very much, I believe.  Isaacs shirked it a good deal, and you\'d\r\nhave to keep the lists rather better than he did.  But I fancy you\'d\r\nenjoy it rather; and," he added, "it will be an excuse for seeing less\r\nof some not very nice friends."\r\n\r\nWyndham said he would take the post, and went off happier in his own\r\nmind than he had been for a long time, and leaving Riddell happier too,\r\ndespite all his failures and vexations elsewhere, than he had been since\r\nhe became captain of Willoughby.\r\n\r\nBut, though happy, he could hardly be elated.  His effort that evening\r\nhad certainly been a success, but how long would its effects last?\r\n\r\nRiddell was not fool enough to imagine that his promise to old Wyndham\r\nwas now discharged by that one evening\'s talk.  He knew the boy well\r\nenough to be sure that the task was only just begun.  And his\r\nthankfulness at having made a beginning was tempered with many anxieties\r\nfor the future.  And he might well be anxious!\r\n\r\nFor a day or two Wyndham was an altered boy.  He surprised his masters\r\nby his attention in class, and his schoolfellows--all except Riddell--by\r\nthe steadiness of his behaviour.  He avoided his former companions, and\r\ndevoted himself with enthusiasm to his new duties as librarian, to which\r\nthe doctor, at Riddell\'s suggestion, had appointed him.\r\n\r\nThis alteration, approved of as it was in many quarters, was by no means\r\nappreciated by two boys at Willoughby.  It was not that they cared\r\ntwopence about the society of their young Limpet, or that they had any\r\nmoral objection to good behaviour and steady work.  What irritated Gilks\r\nand Silk over the business was that they saw in it the hand of an enemy,\r\nand felt that the present change in their _protege_ was due to Riddell\'s\r\ninfluence in opposition to their own.  The two monitors felt hurt at\r\nthis; it was like a direct snub aimed at them, and, considering the\r\nquarter from which it came, they did not like it at all.\r\n\r\n"This sort of thing won\'t do," said Gilks to his friend one day, shortly\r\nafter Riddell\'s talk with Wyndham.  "The young \'un\'s cut our\r\nacquaintance."\r\n\r\n"Hope we shall recover in time," said Silk, sneering.  "Yes; he\'s gone\r\ndecidedly `pi.\' the last week."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all that reverend prig\'s doing!" growled Gilks.  "I mean to spoil\r\nhis little game for him, though," added he.  "How\'ll you do it?" asked\r\nSilk.  "That\'s just it!  I wish I knew," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Oh! leave it to me, I\'ll get at him somehow.  I don\'t suppose he\'s too\r\nfar gone yet."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Silk took an early opportunity of meeting his young friend.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Wyndham," said he, casually; "don\'t see much of you now."\r\n\r\n"No," said Wyndham, shortly; "I\'m busy with the library."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I\'m afraid, though, you\'re rather glad of an excuse to cut Silks\r\nand me after the row we got you into last week."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t get me into any row," said Wyndham.  "What! didn\'t he lick\r\nyou for it?  Ah!  I see how it is.  He\'s afraid you\'d let out on him for\r\nbeing down too.  Rather a good dodge too.  Gilks and I half thought of\r\nreporting him, but we didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"He had a permit, hadn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--rather!  I don\'t doubt that.  Just like Brown\'s, the town\r\nboy\'s excuses.  Writes them himself."\r\n\r\n"I\'m certain Riddell wouldn\'t do such a thing," said Wyndham, warming.\r\n\r\n"I never said he would," replied Silk, seeing he was going a little too\r\nfar.  "You see, captains don\'t want permits.  There\'s no one to pull\r\nthem up.  But I say, I\'m awfully sorry about last week."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it doesn\'t matter," said Wyndham, who could not help being rather\r\ngratified to hear a monitor making apologies to him; "only I don\'t mean\r\nto go down again."\r\n\r\n"No, of course not; and if Gilks suggests it I\'ll back you up.  By the\r\nway," he added, in tones of feigned alarm, "I suppose you didn\'t tell\r\nhim about going to Beamish\'s, did you?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Wyndham, whose conscience had already reproached him several\r\ntimes for not having confessed the fact.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully glad of that," said Silk, apparently much relieved.\r\n"Whatever you do, keep that quiet."\r\n\r\n"Why?" said Wyndham, rather concerned.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, if that got out--well, I don\'t know what would happen."\r\n\r\n"Why, is it a bad place, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, not at all," laughed Silk with a mysterious wink.  "All serene\r\nfor follows like Gilks; but if it was known we\'d taken _you_ there, we\'d\r\nbe done for."\r\n\r\nWyndham began to feel he had had a narrow escape of "doing" for his two\r\npatrons without knowing it.\r\n\r\n"Promise you won\'t tell anybody," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Of course I won\'t," said Wyndham, rather scornful at the idea of\r\ntelling tales of a schoolfellow.\r\n\r\n"Thanks; and I\'ll take care and say nothing about you, and Gilks won\'t\r\neither, I know.  So it\'ll be all right.  I don\'t know what possessed the\r\nfellow to suggest going in there."\r\n\r\nAll this was somewhat perplexing to Wyndham.  He had never imagined\r\nBeamish\'s was such a terrible place, or that the penalty of being found\r\nthere was so severe.  He felt that he had had a fortunate escape, and\r\nwas glad Silk had put him up to it before he had let it out.\r\n\r\nHe became more friendly with his ally after this.  There is always a\r\nbond of attraction where a common danger threatens, and Wyndham felt\r\nthat, however determined he was not to be led away any more by these\r\nfriends of his, it was just as well to be civil to them.\r\n\r\nSo he even accepted an invitation to come and have tea in Silk\'s room\r\nthat evening, to look at a volume of "Punch" the latter had got from\r\nhome, and to talk over the coming boat-race.\r\n\r\nHad he overheard a hurried conversation which took place between Silk\r\nand Gilks shortly afterwards in the Sixth Form room he would have looked\r\nforward to that evening with anything but eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Hooked him, I fancy," said Silk.  "He\'s coming to tea this evening."\r\n\r\n"Good man.  How did you manage it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, and by the way," said Silk, "that going to Beamish\'s last week was\r\nno end of a crime.  If it\'s found out it\'s expulsion, remember.  He\r\nbelieves it all.  I\'ve told him we won\'t let out on him, and he\'s\r\npromised not to say a word about it.  Fancy we\'ve rather a pull on him\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a jolly clever fellow, Silk," said Gilks, admiringly.\r\n\r\n"May be, but I\'m not such a nice boy as you are, Gilks."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLHOUSE BOAT AT WORK.\r\n\r\nGiles and his ally knew their business well enough to see that they must\r\ngo to work "gingerly" to recover their lost Limpet.  Consequently when\r\nWyndham, according to promise, turned up to tea in Silk\'s study, nothing\r\nwas said or done in any way likely to offend his lately awakened\r\nscruples.\r\n\r\nThe tea was a good one, the volume of "Punch" was amusing, and the talk\r\nconfined itself almost altogether to school affairs, and chiefly to the\r\ncoming boat-race.\r\n\r\nThis last subject was one of intense interest to young Wyndham.  As\r\nbrother to the old captain, he was naturally eager to see his brother\'s\r\nboat retain its old position on the river; and as an ardent schoolhouse\r\nboy himself, he had a further reason for wishing the same result.\r\n\r\n"You know," said he, "I think our fellows are looking up, don\'t you,\r\nGilks?"\r\n\r\n"So fellows say," replied Gilks; "of course, being in the boat myself,\r\nit\'s hard to tell."\r\n\r\n"But doesn\'t the boat seem to be going better?" asked Wyndham.  "It\r\nlooks to be going a lot better from the bank."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say, young un," said Silk, "you ever expect the\r\nschoolhouse will beat Parrett\'s?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid they are rather strong," said Wyndham, regretfully.\r\n\r\n"Strong!" said Silk; "they\'re the finest crew Willoughby\'s turned out\r\nfor years.  Better even than the one your brother stroked last races."\r\n\r\n"And they mean winning, too," said Gilks, "from all I hear.  They\'re\r\nspecially set on it because they think they\'ve been snubbed over the\r\ncaptaincy, and mean to show they _are_ the cock house, though the doctor\r\nwon\'t own it."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Silk, "as I\'ve not much faith in the Welchers\' boat--in\r\nfact, I\'m not sure if they\'ll be able to get up a crew at all--I feel\r\ndelightfully impartial."\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll back us," said Wyndham, earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Of course, old Gilks is one of your crew," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"You know," said the boy, "I\'d give anything for our boat to win.  It\r\nwould be such a score for us, after all that has been said, wouldn\'t it,\r\nGilks?"\r\n\r\n"Well, fellows haven\'t been very complimentary about the schoolhouse\r\nlately, certainly," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"No, they certainly haven\'t," replied Wyndham.  "By the way, Gilks, what\r\nsort of cox does Riddell make?"\r\n\r\n"Rather an amusing one, from all I can hear," said Gilks.  "He\'s not\r\nsteered the four yet; but he\'s had some tub practice, and is beginning\r\nto find out that the natural place for a boat is between the banks\r\ninstead of on them."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Wyndham, "I heard Fairbairn say he promised very well.  He\'s\r\na light-weight, you know, and as the juniors are all stopped river-play,\r\nwe shall have to get a cox.  And if Riddell will do, it won\'t be a bad\r\nthing any way."\r\n\r\n"I\'m rather surprised they didn\'t try you for it," said Gilks.  "You\'re\r\nwell-known, you know, and used to the river."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'d rather Riddell did it if he can," said Wyndham.  "I know he\'s\r\nawfully anxious to get it up."\r\n\r\nThe talk went on like this, and trenched on no uncomfortable topic.  The\r\nonly reference to anything of the sort was when Silk said, just as\r\nWyndham was going, "Oh, Wyndham, I\'ve told Gilks here that you\'ve\r\npromised not to let out about Beamish\'s--"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gilks, "I wouldn\'t care for that to get about, young un."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course I won\'t say anything," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, no more will we; will we, Silk?" replied Gilks.\r\n\r\nSilk assented and their visitor departed.\r\n\r\n"Young fool!" said Gilks, when he and his friend were left alone.  "He\'s\r\nnot worth bothering about."\r\n\r\n"If it weren\'t for the other prig I\'d agree with you," said Silk.  "But\r\ndon\'t you think we can hit at his reverence occasionally through his\r\ndisciple?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say," said Gilks.  "The young prig had an innocent enough time\r\nof it to-night to suit even him.  How he does talk!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and isn\'t he hot about the race?  I say, Gilks, I hope there\'ll be\r\nno mistake about Parrett\'s winning.  I\'ve a lot of money on them."\r\n\r\n"Never fear," said Gilks.  "It\'ll be rather a rum thing if I, rowing in\r\nthe schoolhouse boat, can\'t put the drag on them somehow.  I don\'t\r\nexpect for a moment it will be wanted; but if it is, Gilks will be under\r\nthe painful necessity of catching a crab!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind how you do it as long as there\'s no mistake about it,"\r\nsaid Silk.  With which ungenerous admission Gilks produced a couple of\r\ncigar-ends from his pocket, and these two nice boys proceeded to spend a\r\ndissipated evening.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have guessed from what has already been said that the\r\ncoming boat-race was every day becoming a more and more exciting topic\r\nin Willoughby.  Under any circumstances the race was, along with the May\r\nsports and the cricket-match against Rockshire, one of the events of the\r\nyear.  But this year, ever since it had come somehow to be mixed up with\r\nthe squabble about the captaincy, and the jealousy between Parrett\'s and\r\nthe schoolhouse, it had become more important than ever.\r\n\r\nOld Wyndham had, of course, left the schoolhouse boat at the head of the\r\nriver, but there was scarcely a boy (even in the schoolhouse itself) who\r\nseriously expected it would remain there over the coming regatta.\r\n\r\nThe Parrett\'s fellows were already crowing in anticipation, and the\r\nvictory of Bloomfield\'s boat was only waited for as a final ground for\r\nresisting the authority of any captain but their own.  Their boat was\r\ncertainly one of the best which the school had turned out, and compared\r\nwith their competitors\' it seemed as if nothing short of a miracle could\r\nprevent its triumph.\r\n\r\nBut the schoolhouse fellows, little as they expected to win, were\r\nmeaning to make a hot fight of it.  They were on their mettle quite as\r\nmuch as their rivals.  Ever since Wyndham had left, the schoolhouse had\r\nbeen sneered at as having no pretensions left to any athletic\r\ndistinction.  They meant to put themselves right in this particular--if\r\nnot in victory, at any rate in a gallant attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd so the schoolhouse boat might be seen out early and late, doing\r\nhonest hard work, and doing it well too.  Strict training was the order\r\nof the day, and scarcely a day passed without some one of the crew\r\nadding to his usual labours a cross-country run, or a hard grind in the\r\nbig tub, to better his form.  These extraordinary exertions were a\r\nsource of amusement to their opponents, who felt their own superiority\r\nall the more by witnessing the efforts put forth to cope with it; and\r\neven in the schoolhouse there were not a few who regarded all the work\r\nas labour thrown away, and as only adding in prospect to the\r\nglorification of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHowever, Fairbairn was not the man to be moved by small considerations\r\nsuch as these.  He did not care what fellows said, or how much they\r\nlaughed, as long as Porter swung out well at the reach forward, and\r\nCoates straightened his back, and Gilks pulled his oar better through\r\nfrom beginning to end.  To secure these ends he himself was game for any\r\namount of work and trouble, and no cold water could damp either his\r\nardour or his hopefulness.\r\n\r\nBut the chief sensation with regard to the training of the schoolhouse\r\nboat was the sudden appearance of Riddell as its coxswain.  As the\r\nreader has heard, the new captain had already been out once or twice "on\r\nthe quiet" in the pair-oar, and during these expeditions he had learned\r\nall he knew of the art of navigation.  The idea of his steering the\r\nschoolhouse boat had never occurred either to himself or Fairbairn when\r\nhe first undertook these practices at the solicitation of his friend.\r\nBut after a lesson or two he showed such promise that the idea did\r\nstrike Fairbairn, who mentioned it to one or two of his set and asked\r\ntheir advice.\r\n\r\nThese judges were horrified naturally at the idea.  Riddell was too\r\nheavy, too clumsy, too nervous.  But Fairbairn was loth to give up his\r\nidea; so he went to Mr Parrett, and asked him if he would mind running\r\nwith the schoolhouse pair-oar during the next morning\'s spin, and\r\nwatching the steering of the new captain.  Mr Parrett did so; and was\r\nnot a little pleased with the performance, but advised Fairbairn to try\r\nhim in the four-oar before deciding.\r\n\r\nFairbairn, delighted, immediately broached the subject to his friend.\r\nPoor Riddell was astounded at such a notion.\r\n\r\n_He_ cox the schoolhouse boat in the regatta!\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said he to Fairbairn.  "I\'m not a very exalted\r\npersonage in Willoughby as it is--but this would be the finishing\r\nstroke!"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean--that it\'s _infra dig._ to cox the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" said Riddell, "anything but that.  But it might be _infra dig._\r\nfor the boat to be steered into the bank in the middle of the race."\r\n\r\n"Humbug, if that\'s your only reason.  Anyhow, old man, come down and try\r\nyour hand in the four to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nRiddell protested that the idea was absurd, and that he wouldn\'t hear of\r\nit.  But Fairbairn reasoned him down.  He hadn\'t steered them into the\r\nbank since the second morning--he hadn\'t tried steering the four-oar,\r\nhow did he know he couldn\'t do it?  Mr Parrett had advised the trial\r\nstrongly, and so on.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "the only question is your weight.  You\'d have to run off\r\na bit of that, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Riddell, "as to that, you can take as many pounds off me as\r\nyou like; but--"\r\n\r\n"None of your buts, old man," said Fairbairn.  "I say, if we only were\r\nto win, with you as cox, what a score it would be!"\r\n\r\n"None of your `ifs,\' old man," said Riddell, laughing.  "But I\'ll come\r\nto-morrow, if you are determined to have your way."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am," said Fairbairn.\r\n\r\nThis conversation took place the evening that young Wyndham was taking\r\ntea with Silk and Gilks in the study of the former.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that the new captain was to be taken out to steer the\r\nschoolhouse boat mysteriously got wind before the evening was over, and\r\nspread over the school like wildfire.  Consequently, when Riddell\r\narrived at the boat-house in the morning, he was surprised and horrified\r\nto find that nearly all Willoughby was awake and down at the river banks\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\nIt was embarrassing certainly, and when presently the crew got into\r\ntheir seats and a start was made, it became evident the new coxswain was\r\nanything but at home in his new position.  The boat was a long time\r\ngetting clear of the landing stage owing to his persistently mistaking\r\nin his flurry his right hand for his left, and then when it did get out\r\ninto mid-stream the same reason prevented him from discovering that the\r\nreason why the boat would turn round instead of going straight was\r\nbecause he had his right cord pulled hard the whole time.\r\n\r\nThis spectacle, as may be imagined, afforded intense gratification to\r\nthe curious onlookers, and many and hilarious were the shouts which fell\r\non the ears of the unlucky captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well coxed there!" one voice cried.\r\n\r\n"Well steered in a circle!" shouted another.\r\n\r\n"Mind you don\'t knock the bank down," yelled a third.\r\n\r\n"Pull your right there!"\r\n\r\n"Try him without the rudder.  See if he don\'t steer better that way."\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these uncomplimentary shouts the boat slowly wended its\r\nerratic course up the river, amidst crowds of boys on either bank.\r\n\r\n"Riddell, old man," said Fairbairn, leaning forward from his place at\r\nstroke, "what\'s the row?"\r\n\r\nIt only needed a friendly voice to recall the captain to himself.  By an\r\neffort he forgot about the crowds and turned a deaf ear to the shouts,\r\nand straightening himself, and taking the lines steadily in his hands,\r\nlooked up quietly at his friend.  Richard was himself again.\r\n\r\n"Now then!" cried Fairbairn to his men behind, "row all!" and he led\r\nthem off with a long steady stroke.\r\n\r\nFor a little distance the boat travelled well.  Riddell kept a good\r\ncourse, and the whole crew worked steadily.  The scoffers on the bank\r\nwere perplexed, and their jeers died away feebly.  This was not a crew\r\nof muffs assuredly.  Those first twenty or thirty yards were rowed in a\r\nstyle not very far short of the Parrett\'s standard, and Parson himself,\r\nthe best cox of Parrett\'s house, could hardly have taken the boat down\r\nthat reach in a better course.\r\n\r\nThere was something ominous in this.  But, to the great relief of the\r\nunfriendly critics, this showy lead was not maintained.  Before a\r\nhundred yards were completed something seemed to go wrong in the boat.\r\nIt rolled heavily and wavered in its course.  What was wrong?\r\n\r\nThe fault was certainly not in Fairbairn, who kept doggedly to work in\r\nperfectly even style.  Nor, to all appearance, was it in Riddell.  He\r\nwas evidently puzzled by the sudden unsteadiness of the boat, but no one\r\ncould lay it to his charge.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that digging behind?" cried Fairbairn over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nNone of the other three owned the soft impeachment, and the boat seemed\r\nto right itself of its own accord.\r\n\r\nFairbairn, whose temper was never improved by perplexities, quickened\r\nhis stroke, and gave his men a spell of hard work for a bit to punish\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to have a good effect, and once again the onlookers were\r\nstartled to see how steadily and fast the boat was travelling.  But once\r\nagain the mysterious disturbance interrupted their progress.\r\n\r\nThis time Fairbairn stopped short, and turning round demanded angrily\r\nwho it was who was playing the fool, for an effect like this could only\r\nbe put down to such a course.  Porter, Coates, and Gilks all repudiated\r\nthe suggestion, and once more, amid the ironical cheers of the\r\nonlookers, Fairbairn resumed his work and lashed viciously out with his\r\noar.\r\n\r\nThis last protest of his seemed to have had the desired effect, for\r\nduring the rest of the journey up to the Willows the boat travelled\r\nfairly well, though it was evident plenty of work was needed before the\r\ncrew could be considered in proper racing trim.  But no sooner had they\r\nturned and started for the home journey than once again the rolling\r\nsuddenly became manifest.  Fairbairn rowed on a stroke or two without\r\napparently noticing it, then turning sharply round in the middle of a\r\nstroke he discovered the reason.\r\n\r\nThe blade of Gilks\'s oar was about a foot under the surface, and he\r\nhimself was lurching over his seat, with the handle of the oar up to\r\nabout his chin.\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you mean by it?" demanded Fairbairn, angrily.\r\n\r\n"Mean by what?" asked Gilks.\r\n\r\n"By playing the fool like that; that\'s what I mean," retorted Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"Who was playing the fool?" snarled Gilks.  "How can I help catching a\r\ncrab when he\'s constantly turning the boat\'s head in the middle of a\r\nstroke?"\r\n\r\n"All rot!" said Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"All very well for you at stroke," said Gilks, viciously.  "You come and\r\nrow bow and see if you don\'t feel it.  I\'d like to know who could keep\r\nhis oar straight with such steering."\r\n\r\n"If you\'d row half as well as he steers," said Fairbairn, "you\'d row a\r\nprecious sight better than you do!  You\'d better take care, Gilks."\r\n\r\n"Take care of what, you fool?" demanded Gilks, whose temper was now\r\nfairly gone.\r\n\r\n"Ready all, you fellows!" cried Fairbairn, stretching forward.\r\n\r\nThis brief conversation had been heard only by those in the boat, but\r\nits purport had been gathered by those on the bank who had watched the\r\nangry looks and heard the angry voices of the speakers.\r\n\r\n"Bravo! fight it out!" cried some one, and the news that there was a\r\nquarrel in the schoolhouse boat added greatly to the zest of the\r\ncritics\' enjoyment.\r\n\r\nFairbairn\'s caution--whether purposely, or because he could not help\r\nit--was lost upon the offending bow oar.  The boat had scarcely started\r\nagain when Gilks caught another crab, which for the moment nearly upset\r\nthe crew.  Fairbairn rowed on, with thunder in his face, regardless of\r\nthe incident, and Riddell kept as straight a course as he could, despite\r\nthe unsteadiness.  In due time the unsatisfactory practice came to an\r\nend, and the crew stood together again on the steps of the boat-house.\r\n\r\nGilks seemed to expect, and every one else expected, that Fairbairn\r\nwould once more take the defaulter to task for his performance that\r\nmorning, and Fairbairn did not disappoint him; though he dealt with the\r\nmatter in a rather unexpected manner.\r\n\r\n"I shall want the tub-pair after third school," said he to the boatman.\r\n"Riddell, will you come and cox.  Crossfield and me?"\r\n\r\n"Who--Crossfield?" asked Coates.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall try him for bow."\r\n\r\n"You mean to say," exclaimed Gilks, taking the matter in, "you\'re going\r\nto turn me out of the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Fairbairn, coolly.\r\n\r\n"What for?" demanded Gilks, threateningly.\r\n\r\n"Because," replied Fairbairn, taking Riddell\'s arm and walking slowly\r\noff--"because we can do better without you."\r\n\r\nGilks stared at him a moment as though he meditated flying at him.  If\r\nhe did, he thought better of it, and turned away, muttering to himself\r\nthat he would pay them all out, let them see if he did not.\r\n\r\nThreats of this sort were not unheard-of things from Gilks, and no one\r\nwas greatly disturbed by them.  On the whole, Fairbairn\'s decision was\r\napproved of by most of the schoolhouse partisans, particularly those who\r\nhad watched the proceedings of the morning.  A few thought Gilks might\r\nhave been accorded a second chance, but the majority argued that if a\r\nfellow caught crabs like that in a practice he would probably do it in\r\nthe race, and they did not want the risk of that.\r\n\r\nAs to his excuse about the steering, every one who knew anything about\r\nthat knew it meant nothing, and Gilks did not repeat it.\r\n\r\nAs he reached the school Silk met him with angry looks.\r\n\r\n"Is it true what I hear," said he, "that you\'re out of the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," growled Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Why, you idiot! whatever have you done this for?"\r\n\r\n"I did nothing.  They wanted to get rid of me, and they did."\r\n\r\n"Yes, because you hadn\'t the ordinary sense to keep up appearances till\r\nthe race, and must begin to practise your tricks a month beforehand!"\r\nsaid Silk, greatly enraged, for him.\r\n\r\n"All very well," said Gilks, sullenly.  "I should have liked to see you\r\nrowing your best with that puppy steering; thinking he\'s doing it so\r\nwonderfully, the prig!"\r\n\r\n"And just because you hadn\'t the patience to hold out a week or two you\r\ngo and spoil everything.  I didn\'t think you were such a fool, upon my\r\nword."\r\n\r\nGilks was cowed by the wrath of his friend.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t help it," he said.  "I\'m awfully sorry."\r\n\r\n"It\'s done us completely now," said Silk.  "For all we know they may\r\nwin.  Who\'s to take your place?"\r\n\r\n"Crossfield."\r\n\r\n"Just the man I was afraid.  He\'s the best man they could have picked\r\nout.  I tell you what, Gilks, you\'d better go and apologise and see if\r\nyou can\'t get back into the boat.  Who could have believed you\'d be such\r\na fool!  Go at once, for goodness\' sake."\r\n\r\nGilks, who saw his own mistake fully as well as his friend, obeyed.  He\r\nfound Fairbairn in his study with Riddell.  The former seemed not at all\r\nsurprised to see him.\r\n\r\n"Fairbairn," said Gilks, "I hope you\'ll let me stay in the boat.  I\'m\r\nsorry I played the fool this morning."\r\n\r\n"Then you _were_ playing the fool?" demanded Fairbairn, to whom Riddell\r\nhad just been confiding that perhaps, after all, there had been some\r\nfault in the steering to account for it.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gilks, sullenly.\r\n\r\n"Then," said Fairbairn, hotly, "you may be a fool, but I won\'t be such a\r\nbig one as to let you stay in the boat another day!"\r\n\r\nGilks glared a moment at the speaker.  Evidently it would be no use to\r\nargue or plead further; and, smarting with rage and humiliation, none\r\nthe less keen that Riddell had been present and heard all, he turned\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be sorry for this, you two," he growled.  "Humbugs!"\r\n\r\n"Well rid of him," said Fairbairn, as soon as he had gone.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I don\'t think much of him," said Riddell, thinking as much of\r\nyoung Wyndham and his temptations as of the schoolhouse boat.\r\n\r\n"Well, old man," said Fairbairn, after a pause, "you steered awfully\r\nwell when you once began.  Whatever made you so shaky at first?"\r\n\r\n"My usual complaint," said Riddell, smiling.  "I was thinking what other\r\npeople were thinking."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Fairbairn, "unless you can give that up you may as well shut\r\nup shop altogether."\r\n\r\n"Well, if I must do one or the other, I think I\'ll keep the shop open,"\r\nsaid Riddell, cheerily.  "By the way," added he, looking at his watch\r\nand sighing, "I have to see some juniors in my study in two minutes.\r\nGood-bye."\r\n\r\n"Be sure you\'re down for the tub practice this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be there," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nBLOOMFIELD IN TRIBULATION.\r\n\r\nBloomfield was beginning to discover already that the new dignity to\r\nwhich he had been raised by his own partisans at Willoughby was anything\r\nbut a bed of roses.  Vain and easily led as he was, he was not a bad\r\nfellow by any means; and when the mutiny against the new captain first\r\nbegan, he flattered himself that by allowing himself to be set up in\r\nopposition he was really doing a service to Willoughby, and securing the\r\nschool against a great many disasters which were certain to ensue if\r\nRiddell was left supreme.\r\n\r\nBut in these lofty hopes he was getting to be a trifle disappointed.  In\r\nhis own house, of course, especially among those over whom he was wont\r\nto rule in athletic sports, his authority was paramount.  But these,\r\nafter all, constituted only a small section of Willoughby.  Over the\r\nrest of the school his influence was strangely overlooked, and even the\r\nterrors of his arm failed to bring his subjects to obedience.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well at first, when the one idea was indignation against\r\nthe doctor\'s new appointment.  But as soon as the malcontents discovered\r\nthat they had raised one more tyrant over their own heads, they began to\r\nfind out their mistake, and did their best to correct it.  They argued\r\nthat as they had elected Bloomfield themselves they weren\'t bound to\r\nobey him unless they chose; and when it came to the point of having to\r\ngive up their own will in obedience to his, they remembered he was not\r\nthe real captain of Willoughby and had no right to order them!\r\n\r\nSo poor Bloomfield did not find things quite as comfortable as he had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nOne of the first rebuffs he got was administered by no less stately a\r\nhand than that of Master Telson of the schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nThis young gentleman ever since his last unfortunate expedition in\r\n"Noah\'s Ark" had been somewhat under a cloud.  His forced absence from\r\nthe river for a whole week had preyed upon his spirits.  And when at the\r\nend of that period he did revisit his old haunts, armed with a captain\'s\r\npermit, it was only to discover that whatever small chance he ever had\r\nof coxing his house\'s boat at the coming regatta, had vanished under the\r\nnew arrangement which had brought Riddell into the boat.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say that this disappointment, keen as it was, had no\r\neffect on his loyalty.  He was as ready as ever to fight any one who\r\nspoke ill of the schoolhouse.  But it certainly had given him a jar,\r\nwhich resulted in rather strained relations with some of his old allies\r\nin Parrett\'s.\r\n\r\nOf course nothing could shake his devotion to Parson.  That was secure\r\nwhatever happened, but towards the other heroes of Parrett\'s,\r\nparticularly the seniors, he felt unfriendly.  He conceived he must have\r\nbeen the victim of a plot to prevent his steering the schoolhouse boat.\r\nIt was the only reason he could think of for his ill-luck; and though he\r\nnever tried to argue it out, it was pretty clear to his own mind some\r\none was at the bottom of it.  And if that was so, who more likely than\r\nBloomfield and Game and that lot, who had everything to gain by his\r\nbeing turned out of the rival boat?\r\n\r\nThis was the state of mind of our aggrieved junior one afternoon not\r\nlong before the regatta, as he strolled dismally across the "Big" on his\r\nway to the river.  Parson was not with him.  He was down coxing his\r\nboat, and the thought of this only reminded Telson of his own bad luck,\r\nand added to his ill-temper.\r\n\r\nHe was roused from his moody reflections by the approach of two boys,\r\nwho hailed him cheerily.\r\n\r\n"What cheer, Telson, old man?" cried King.  "How jolly blue you look!\r\nWhat\'s the row?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing," replied Telson.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve just been down to see the boats.  Awful spree to see old Riddell\r\nsteering! isn\'t it, Bosher?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bosher; "but he\'s better than he was."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, they won\'t lick us," said King.  "You should have seen our\r\nboat!  Bless you, those schoolhouse louts--"\r\n\r\n"King, I\'ll fight you!" said Telson, suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! beg pardon, old man, I didn\'t--eh--what?"\r\n\r\nThis last remark was caused by the fact that Telson was taking off his\r\ncoat.  King, utterly taken aback by these ominous preparations,\r\nprotested his sorrow, apologised, and generally humiliated himself\r\nbefore the offended schoolhouse junior.\r\n\r\nBut Telson had been looking out for a cause of quarrel, and now one had\r\ncome, he was just in the humour for going through with the business.\r\n"Do you funk it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; not that, old man," said King, still friendly, and very slowly\r\nunbuttoning his jacket; "but I\'ll apologise, Telson, you know."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want any apologising; I want to fight," said Telson.  "I\'ll take\r\nyoung Bosher too."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Bosher, rather alarmed, "I don\'t want to fight."\r\n\r\n"I knew you were a beastly funk!" said Telson, scornfully.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not," said Bosher, meekly.\r\n\r\n"Get out of the way!" cried the majestic Telson, brushing past him\r\ntowards King, who now stood with his coat off and a very apologetic\r\nface, ready for the young bantam\'s disposal.\r\n\r\nTelson and King fought there and then.  It was not a very sanguinary\r\ncontest, nor was it particularly scientific.  It did Telson good, and it\r\ndid not do King much harm.  The only awkward thing about it was that\r\nneither side knew exactly when to stop.  Telson claimed the victory\r\nafter every round, and King respectfully disputed the statement.  Telson\r\nthereupon taunted his adversary with "funking it," and went at him\r\nagain, very showy in action, but decidedly feeble in execution.  King,\r\nby keeping one arm over his face and working the other gently up and\r\ndown in front of his body, was able to ward off most of the blows aimed,\r\nand neither aspired nor aimed to hit out himself.\r\n\r\nThe "fight" might have lasted a week had not Game, coming up that way\r\nfrom the boats, caught sight of it.  As it was neither an exciting\r\ncombat nor a profitable one, the Parrett\'s monitor considered it a good\r\ncase for interfering, as well as for calling in the authority of the\r\npopular captain.\r\n\r\n"King and Telson," he said, stepping between the combatants, "stop it,\r\nand come to Bloomfield\'s study after chapel.  You know fighting in the\r\n`Big\' is against rules."\r\n\r\n"What are we to go to Bloomfield for?" demanded Telson, whose temper was\r\nstill disturbed.\r\n\r\n"For breaking rules," said Game, as he walked on.\r\n\r\n"Shall you go?" said Telson to King as the two slowly put on their\r\ncoats.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose so, or he\'ll give us a licking."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t go; he\'s not the captain," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"I say, you\'ll catch it if you don\'t," said King, with apprehension in\r\nhis looks.  "They\'re always down on you if you don\'t go to the captain\r\nwhen you\'re told."\r\n\r\n"I tell you he\'s not the captain," replied Telson, testily, "and I\r\nshan\'t go.  If they want to report me they\'ll have to do it to Riddell."\r\n\r\nWith which virtuous decision he went his way, slightly solaced in his\r\nmind by the fight, and still more consoled by the prospects of a row\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nTelson was quite cute enough to see he had a strong position to start\r\nwith, and if only he played his cards well he might score off the enemy\r\nwith credit.\r\n\r\nHe therefore declined an invitation to Parson\'s to partake of shrimps\r\nand jam at tea, and kept himself in his own house till the time\r\nappointed for reporting himself to the captain.  Then, instead of going\r\nto Bloomfield, he presented himself before Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the captain, in his usual half-apologetic tone.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Telson, "I\'m reported, please, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"What for?  Who reported you?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Game--for fighting," replied Telson.\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t told me of it.  You\'d better come in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Oh! it\'s all right," said Telson.  "I was fighting King in the `Big\'\r\nthis afternoon."\r\n\r\nRiddell looked perplexed.  This was the first case of a boy voluntarily\r\ndelivering himself up to justice, and he hardly knew what to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had found out thus much by this time--that it didn\'t so much\r\nmatter what he did as long as he did something.\r\n\r\n"You know it\'s against rules," said he, as severely as he could, "and\r\nit\'s not the first time you\'ve done it.  You must do fifty lines of\r\nVirgil, and stop in the house on Monday and Tuesday."\r\n\r\n"All right!  Thanks," said Telson, rapidly departing, and leaving\r\nRiddell quite bewildered by the apparent gratitude of his fag.\r\n\r\nTelson betook himself quietly to his study and began to write his lines.\r\nIt was evident from the restless way in which he looked up at every\r\nfootstep outside he did not expect to remain long undisturbed at this\r\nharmless occupation.  Nor was he disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn about ten minutes King entered and said, "I say, Telson, you\'re in\r\nfor it!  You\'re to go to Bloomfield directly."\r\n\r\n"What\'s he given you?"\r\n\r\n"A licking!" said King; "and stopped my play half a week.  But I say,\r\nyou\'d better go--sharp!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed King, in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Cut it," said Telson; "I\'m busy."\r\n\r\n"He sent me to fetch you," said King.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I tell you I\'m not coming?  I\'ll lick you, King, if you don\'t cut\r\nit!"\r\n\r\nKing did "cut it" in a considerable state of alarm at the foolhardiness\r\nof his youthful comrade.\r\n\r\nBut Telson knew his business.  No sooner had King gone than he took up\r\nhis Virgil and paper, and repaired once more to Riddell\'s study.\r\n\r\n"Please, Riddell," said he, meekly, "do you mind me writing my lines\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said Riddell, whose study was always open house to his\r\nyouthful fag.\r\n\r\nTelson said "Thank you," and immediately deposited himself at the table,\r\nand quietly continued his work, awaiting the result of King\'s message.\r\n\r\nThe result was not long in coming.\r\n\r\n"Telson!" shouted a voice down the passage in less than five minutes.\r\n\r\nTelson went to the door and shouted back, "What\'s the row?"\r\n\r\n"Where are you?" said the voice.\r\n\r\n"Here," replied Telson, shutting the door and resuming his work.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" asked Riddell of his fag.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, unless it\'s Game," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"Now then, Telson," cried the voice again, "come here."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t--I\'m busy!" shouted Telson back from where he sat.  At the same\r\nmoment the door opened, and Game entered in a great state of wrath.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a Parrett monitor "on duty" in the schoolhouse was\r\nalways a strange spectacle; and Game, when he discovered into whose\r\nstudy he had marched, was a trifle embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Game?" asked Riddell, civilly.\r\n\r\n"I want Telson," said Game, who, by the way, had scarcely spoken to the\r\nnew captain since his appointment.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" said Telson, boldly.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you come when you were sent for?" demanded Game.\r\n\r\n"Who sent for me?"\r\n\r\n"Bloomfield."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not Bloomfield\'s fag," retorted Telson.  "I\'m Riddell\'s."\r\n\r\n"What did I tell you this afternoon?" said Game, beginning to suspect\r\nthat he had fallen into a trap.\r\n\r\n"Told me to go to the captain after chapel."\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean by not going?"\r\n\r\n"I did go--I went to Riddell."\r\n\r\n"I told you to go to Bloomfield," said Game, growing hot.\r\n\r\n"Bloomfield\'s not the captain," retorted Telson, beginning to enjoy\r\nhimself.  "Riddell\'s captain."\r\n\r\n"You were fighting in the `Big,\'" said Game, looking uneasily at Riddell\r\nwhile he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I know I was.  Riddell\'s potted me for it, haven\'t you, Riddell?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve given Telson fifty lines, and stopped his play two days," said\r\nRiddell, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I\'m writing the lines now," said Telson, dipping his pen in\r\nthe ink, and scarcely smothering a laugh.\r\n\r\nGame, now fully aware of his rebuff, was glad of an opportunity of\r\ncovering his defeat by a diversion.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he, walking up to Telson, "I didn\'t come here to be\r\ncheeked by you, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s cheeking you?" said Telson.  "I\'m not."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are," said Game.  "I\'m not going to be humbugged about by\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to humbug you about," replied the junior, defiantly.\r\n\r\n"I think there\'s a mistake, you know," said Riddell, thinking it right\r\nto interpose.  "I\'ve given him lines for fighting in the `Big,\' and\r\nthere\'s really no reason for his going to Bloomfield."\r\n\r\n"I told him to come to Bloomfield, and he ought to have come."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you had any right to tell him to go to Bloomfield,"\r\nreplied Riddell, with a boldness which astonished himself.  "I\'m\r\nresponsible for stopping fights."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to tell me my business," retorted Game, hotly; "who\r\nare you?"\r\n\r\nGame could have thrashed the captain as easily as he could Telson, and\r\nthe thought flashed through Riddell\'s mind as he paused to reply.  He\r\nwould much have preferred saying nothing, but somehow the present seemed\r\nto be a sort of crisis in his life.  If he gave in now, the chance of\r\nasserting himself in Willoughby might never return.\r\n\r\n"I\'m the captain," he replied, steadily, "and as long as I am captain\r\nI\'m responsible for the order of the school, and I prefer to do my own\r\nwork!"\r\n\r\nThere was something in his look and tone as he uttered these inoffensive\r\nwords which took Game aback and even startled Telson.  It was not at all\r\nlike what fellows had been used to from Riddell, certainly very unlike\r\nthe manner he was generally credited with.  But neither Telson nor Game\r\nwere half so amazed at this little outburst as was the speaker himself.\r\nHe was half frightened the moment he had uttered it.  Now he was in for\r\nit with a vengeance!  It would go out to all Willoughby, he knew, that\r\nhe meant to stand by his guns.  What an awful failure, if, after all, he\r\nshould not be able to keep his word!\r\n\r\nGame, with a forced smile which ill accorded with his inward\r\nastonishment, left the study without another word, heedless even of the\r\nlaugh which Telson could no longer repress.\r\n\r\nOf course many perverted stories of their adventure immediately got\r\nabroad in Willoughby.  Telson\'s highly-coloured version made it appear\r\nthat a pitched battle had been fought between Game and the new captain,\r\nresulting in the defeat of the former chiefly through Telson\'s\r\ninstrumentality and assistance.  As, however, this narrative did not\r\nappear in the same dress two hours running, it was soon taken for what\r\nit was worth, and most fellows preferred to believe the Parretts\'\r\nversion of the story, which stated that Riddell had announced his\r\nintention of keeping order in Willoughby without the help of the\r\nmonitors, and had had the cheek to tell Bloomfield to mind his own\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of Parrett\'s house on hearing such a story may be\r\nimagined.  It was even past a joke.  Bloomfield seriously offered to\r\nresign all pretensions to authority and let things take their course.\r\n\r\n"It makes me seem," he said, "as if I wanted to stick myself up.  If\r\nhe\'s so sure of keeping order by himself, I don\'t see what use it is my\r\npretending to do it too."\r\n\r\n"It would serve him right if you did so," said Game.  "But it would be\r\nso awfully like giving in now, after you have once begun."\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter decided the question.  But Bloomfield all the\r\nsame was considerably impressed by what had happened.\r\n\r\nHe knew in his heart that his only title to the position he assumed was\r\nthe whim of his schoolfellows.  He was a usurper, in fact, and however\r\nmuch he tried to persuade himself he was acting solely for the good of\r\nWilloughby, he knew those motives were only half sincere.  And in spite\r\nof all his efforts, the school was as rowdy as ever.  If he did thrash a\r\nbatch of juniors one day, or stop some disorderly Limpets of their play,\r\nit never seemed to make much impression.  Whereas the one or two rioters\r\nwhom Riddell had ventured to tackle had somehow distinctly reformed\r\ntheir habits.  How was it?\r\n\r\nBloomfield, as he thought the thing over, was not quite happy.  He had\r\nbeen happier far last term when, under old Wyndham, he had exerted\r\nhimself loyally for the good of the school.  Was he not exerting himself\r\nnow?  Why should he be unhappy?  It was not because he felt himself\r\nbeaten--he scorned the idea--or that he felt unequal to the task before\r\nhim.  That too was preposterous.  And yet, he felt, he certainly needed\r\nsomething.  If only now he were first classic as well as captain of the\r\nclubs, what a pull he would have!\r\n\r\nAnd as this thought occurred to him, he also recalled Crossfield\'s\r\nfamous speech at the last Parliament and the laughter which had greeted\r\nit.  Could he translate "Balbus hopped over a wall" without the\r\ndictionary?  Ah!  He thought sometimes he would try, just to prove how\r\nslanderous Crossfield\'s insinuation had been.  The result of all these\r\ncogitations was that Bloomfield began to discover he was not quite such\r\nan "all-round" man as his friends had told him.  And that being so, had\r\nnot he better qualify himself like an honest man for his post?\r\n\r\nHe did not like to confide the idea to his friends for fear of their\r\nlaughter, but for a week or two at least he actually read rather hard on\r\nthe sly.  The worst of it was, that till the examinations next term\r\nthere could be nothing to show for it.  For the Sixth did not change\r\ntheir places every day as the lower forms did.  There was no chance of\r\nleaping to the top at a bound by some lucky answer, or even of advancing\r\na single desk.  And therefore, however hard he worked this term, he\r\nwould never rise above eighteenth classic in the eyes of the school, and\r\nthat was not--well, he would have liked to be a little higher for the\r\nsake of Willoughby!\r\n\r\nThe outlook was not encouraging.  Even Wibberly, the toady, and Silk,\r\nthe Welcher, were better men than he was at classics.\r\n\r\nSuppose, instead of spending his energy over classics, he were to get up\r\none or two rousing speeches for the Parliament, which should take the\r\nshine out of every one else and carry the school by storm?  It was not a\r\nbad idea.  But the chance would not come.  No one could get up a fine\r\nspeech on such a hackneyed subject as "That Rowing is a finer Sport than\r\nCricket," or that "The Study of Science in Public Schools should be\r\nAbolished!"  And when he did attempt to prepare an oration on the\r\nsubject of Compulsory Football, the first friend he showed it to pointed\r\nout so many faults in the composition of the first sentence that\r\nprudence prompted him to put the effusion in the fire.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his friends and admirers kept him busy.  Their delight seemed\r\nto be to seize on all the youngsters they could by any pretext lay hands\r\non and hale them to appear before him.  By this means they imagined they\r\nwere making his authority known and dealing a serious blow at the less\r\nobtrusive captain in the schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nPoor Bloomfield had to administer justice right and left for every\r\nimaginable offence, and was so watched and prompted by officious\r\nadmirers that he was constantly losing his head and making himself\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nHe gave one boy a thrashing for being found with a paper dart in his\r\nhand, because Game had reported him; and to another, who had stolen a\r\nbook, he gave only twenty lines, because he was in the second-eleven.\r\nCusack and Welcher, who was caught climbing the schoolhouse elms one\r\nMonday, he sentenced to an hour\'s detention; and Pilbury, whom he caught\r\nin the same act on Tuesday, he deprived of play for a week--that is, he\r\nsaid he was not to leave his house for a week.  But Pilbury turned up\r\nthe very next day in the "Big," under the very nose of the Parrett\r\ncaptain, who did not even observe his presence.\r\n\r\nIt was this sort of thing which, as the term dragged on, made Bloomfield\r\nmore and more uncomfortable with his position.  It was all very well for\r\nGame, and Ashley, and Wibberly to declare that but for him Willoughby\r\nwould have gone to the dogs--it was all very well of them to make game\r\nof and caricature Riddell and his failures.  Seeing is believing; and\r\nBloomfield, whose heart was honest, and whose common sense, when left to\r\nitself, was not altogether feeble, could not help making the unpleasant\r\ndiscovery that he was not doing very much after all for Willoughby.\r\n\r\nBut the boat-race was now coming on.  There, at any rate, was a sphere\r\nin which he need fear no rival.  With Parrett\'s boat at the head of the\r\nriver, and he its stroke, he would at any rate have one claim on the\r\nobedience of Willoughby which nobody could gainsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTELSON AND PARSON GO TO AN EVENING PARTY.\r\n\r\nIt was the Saturday before the boat-race, and the excitement of\r\nWilloughby was working up every hour.  Boys who were generally in the\r\nhabit of lying in bed till the chapel bell began to ring had been up at\r\nsix for a week past, to look at the practices on the river.  Parliament\r\nhad adjourned till after the event, and even the doings of the rival\r\ncaptains indoors were forgotten for a while in prospect of the still\r\nmore exciting contest out of doors.\r\n\r\nEverybody--even the Welchers, who at the last moment had given up any\r\nattempt to form a crew, and "scratched"--found it hard to think or talk\r\nof any other subject, and beyond the school bounds, in Shellport itself,\r\na rumour of the coming race had got wind and attracted many outsiders to\r\nthe river banks.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the prospect of the coming race which this Saturday\r\nafternoon was agitating the mind of Master Henry Brown.\r\n\r\nBrown was a Limpet, belonging to the schoolhouse, who occupied the\r\ndistinguished position of being the only day-boarder in Willoughby.  His\r\nparents lived in Shellport, and thus had the benefit of the constant\r\nsociety of their dear Harry; while the school, on the other hand, was\r\ndeprived of that advantage for a portion of every day in the term.\r\n\r\nIt was probably to make up for this deprivation that Mr and Mrs Brown\r\nmade it a practice of giving an evening party once a term, to which the\r\ndoctor and his ladies were always invited, and also any two of dear\r\nHarry\'s friends he liked to name.\r\n\r\nIn this way the fond parents not only felt they were doing a polite and\r\nneighbourly act to their son\'s schoolmaster and schoolfellows, but that\r\nthey were also the means of bringing together teacher and pupil in an\r\neasy unconstrained manner which would hardly be possible within the\r\nwalls of the school itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the prospect of one of these delightful entertainments that was\r\nexhilarating Brown this Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be confessed the excitement was due to very opposite\r\nemotions in the breast of the day-boarder.  The doctor and his ladies\r\nwere coming!  On the last two occasions they had been unfortunately\r\nprevented, which had been a great blow to Brown\'s "pa and ma" but a\r\nrelief to Brown himself.  And now the prospect of meeting these awful\r\ndignitaries face to face in his own house put him in a small panic.  But\r\non the other hand, he knew there would be jellies, and savoury pie, and\r\nstrawberries, and tipsy-cake, at home that night.  He had seen them\r\narrive from the confectioner\'s that morning, and, Limpet as he was,\r\nBrown smiled inwardly as he meditated thereon.  This was a second ground\r\nfor excitement.  And a third, equal to either of the other two, was that\r\nParson and Telson were invited and were coming!\r\n\r\nHe had tried one or two other fellows first.  He had sounded Coates on\r\nthe subject, but he unfortunately was engaged.  He had pressed Wyndham\r\nto come, but Wyndham was busy that evening with the library.  He had\r\nappealed to one or two other schoolhouse Limpets, but all, on hearing\r\nthat the doctor and Co. were to be present, respectfully declined.\r\n\r\nFinally Brown dropped upon Telson, and condescendingly proposed to him\r\nto be present as one of his two friends.\r\n\r\nTelson thought the matter over and fancied it promised well.  He liked\r\nthe sound of the jellies and the tipsy-cake, and just at present he knew\r\nof no special reason for "funking" the doctor.  As for the doctor\'s\r\nladies, Telson had never seen them, so they did not weigh particularly\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n"Who else is going?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know yet," said Brown, rather grandly.  "I\'ve one or two\r\nfellows in my mind."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you ask young Parson?" suggested Telson, innocently.\r\n\r\n"Parson? he\'s not a schoolhouse kid."\r\n\r\n"I know he\'s not, but he and I are very chummy, you know.  I wouldn\'t\r\nmind coming if he went."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see," said Brown, mightily, but secretly relieved to know of some\r\none likely to come as his second "friend."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Telson.  "I\'ve not promised, mind, if he can\'t come."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you have!" replied Brown, severely, as he left the room.\r\n\r\nIn due time he found Parson and broached the subject to him.\r\n\r\nParson viewed the matter in very much the same light as Telson had.  He\r\nliked the "tuck-in" better than the company.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to him it was odd that Brown should come all the way\r\nfrom the schoolhouse to invite him, a Parrett\'s junior, to his feast;\r\nnor did it occur to him either that the invitation put him under any\r\nobligation to his would-be host.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what I\'ll do," said he, in a business-like manner, much as\r\nif Brown had asked him to clean out his study for him, "if you ask\r\nTelson to come too, I\'m game."\r\n\r\nBrown half doubted whether these two allies had not been consulting\r\ntogether on the subject, so startling was the similarity of their\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n"Oh!  Telson\'s coming," he said, in as offhand a way as he could.\r\n\r\n"He is!  Then I\'m on, old man; rather!" exclaimed the delighted Parson.\r\n\r\n"All right!  Six-thirty, mind, and chokers!" said Brown, not a little\r\nrelieved to have scraped up two friends for the festive occasion.  At\r\nthe appointed time--or rather before the appointed time, for they\r\narrived at twenty minutes past six--our two heroes, arrayed in their\r\nSunday jackets and white ties, presented themselves at the house of\r\ntheir host.  They had "put it on" considerably in order to get ahead of\r\nthe doctor\'s party; for they considered that--as Parson expressed\r\nit--"it would be a jolly lot less blushy work" to be there before the\r\nhead master arrived.  There was no doubt about their success in this\r\nlittle manoeuvre, for when the servant opened the door the hall was full\r\nof rout seats, and a man, uncommonly like the greengrocer, in a dress\r\ncoat, was busily unpacking plates out of a small hamper.\r\n\r\nInto this scene of confusion Parson and Telson were ushered, and here\r\nthey were left standing for about five minutes, interested spectators,\r\ntill the hall was cleared and the domestic had leisure to go and tell\r\nMaster Harry of their arrival.\r\n\r\nMaster Harry was dressing, and sent down word they had better go into\r\nthe shoe-room till he came down.  Which they did, and amused themselves\r\nduring the interval with trying on Mr Brown\'s Wellingtons, and tying\r\ntogether the laces of all Harry\'s boots they could discover.\r\n\r\nIn due time Harry appeared in grand array.  "How jolly early you are!"\r\nwas his hospitable greeting.  "You said six-thirty, didn\'t you?" said\r\nTelson.  "Yes; it\'s only just that now.  Nobody will be here for a\r\nquarter of an hour yet.  You had better come in and see ma."\r\n\r\nThe two guests obeyed cheerfully.  Ma was in the drawing-room, busily\r\nadjusting the sashes of the three juvenile Misses Brown, with her mouth\r\nfull of pins.  So all she could do was to smile pleasantly at her two\r\nvisitors and nod her head as they each came up and held out their hands\r\nto be shaken.\r\n\r\n"Better sit down," suggested Brown.\r\n\r\nParson and Telson thereupon retreated to the sofa, on the edge of which\r\nthey sat for another five or ten minutes, looking about them\r\ncomplacently, and not attempting to break the silence of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe silence, however, was soon broken by a loud double knock at the hall\r\ndoor, which was the signal for Mr Brown, senior, to bolt into the room\r\nin a guilty way with one cuff not quite buttoned, and stand on the\r\nhearthrug with as free-and-easy an air as if he had been waiting there a\r\nquarter of an hour at least.  Knock followed knock in quick succession,\r\nand after the usual amount of fluttering in the hall, the greengrocer\r\nflung open the drawing-room door and ushered in Dr and Mrs Patrick,\r\nMiss Stringer, and half a dozen other arrivals.\r\n\r\nOur two heroes, sitting side by side, unnoticed on the edge of the sofa,\r\nhad full opportunity to take stock of the various guests, most of whom\r\nwere strangers to them.\r\n\r\nAs every one appeared to be about the doctor\'s age, things promised\r\nslowly for Parson and Telson, whose interest in Brown\'s party decidedly\r\nlanguished when finally they found themselves swept off their perch and\r\nhelplessly wedged into a corner by an impenetrable phalanx of skirts.\r\n\r\nBut this was nothing compared with a discovery they made at the same\r\ntime that they had missed their tea!  There was a merry rattle of cups\r\nand spoons in a room far off, through the half-open door of which they\r\ncould catch glimpses of persons drinking tea, and of Brown handing round\r\nbiscuits and cake.  The sight of this was too much to be borne.  It was\r\nat least worth an effort to retrieve their fatal mistake.\r\n\r\n"I say," said Telson, looking for his friend round the skirts of a\r\nstately female, "hadn\'t we better go and help Brown, Parson?"\r\n\r\nLuckless youth!  The lady in question, hearing the unexpected voice at\r\nher side, backed a little and caught sight of the speaker.\r\n\r\n"What, dear?" she said, benevolently, taking his hand and sitting down\r\non the sofa; "and who are you, my little man?"\r\n\r\n"My little man" was fairly trapped; there was no escaping this seizure.\r\nParson got away safely to the tea-room, and the sight of him dodging\r\nabout among the cakes and cups only added to the misery of the hapless\r\nTelson.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, my little dear?" said the lady, who was no other than Miss\r\nStringer herself.\r\n\r\nTelson, fortunately for him, was ignorant of the fact--as ignorant,\r\nindeed, as Miss Stringer was of the fact that the little dear she was\r\naddressing was a Willoughbite.\r\n\r\n"Telson, ma\'am," said Telson, following Parson with longing eyes.\r\n\r\n"Johnny?" said the lady.\r\n\r\n"No--Augustus," replied the proud bearer of the name.\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer surveyed him benevolently.  He was a nice-looking boy, was\r\nTelson--and the lady thought so too.\r\n\r\n"And will you give me a kiss, Augustus dear?" she said, with her most\r\nwinning smile.\r\n\r\nWhat could Augustus do?  A hundred desperate alternatives darted through\r\nhis mind.  He would bolt into the tea-room; he would shout for help; he\r\nwould show fight; he would-- But while he was making up his mind what he\r\nwould do, he found himself being kissed on the cheek in the most\r\nbarefaced manner, before everybody, by this extraordinary female; and,\r\nmore than that, being actually set down on the sofa beside her!  He only\r\nhoped Parson or Brown had not seen it.\r\n\r\nWell for Miss Stringer she did not guess the wrath that boiled in the\r\nbosom of her small companion!\r\n\r\n"And do you live here, dear?" inquired she, pleased to have this\r\nopportunity of studying the juvenile human nature in which she was so\r\nmuch interested.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," said Telson, surlily; then, suddenly recollecting he was\r\nin polite though disagreeable company, he added, "ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"And where do you go to school, pray?" inquired the spinster.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Willoughby," replied Telson, who had gradually given up all hope of\r\ntea, and was making up his mind to his fate.\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer gave a little start at this piece of information, and was\r\non the point of betraying her identity, but she forbore.  "After all,"\r\nthought she, "he might be more constrained if I were to enlighten him on\r\nthat subject."\r\n\r\n"So you go to Willoughby," she said, with interest.  "And how do you\r\nlike it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, well enough," said Telson, relenting somewhat towards his companion\r\nas she showed no further signs of kissing him.  "Nice lot of fellows,\r\nyou know, on the whole."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?  Let me see, who is the head master?" inquired the lady.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Paddy--that old boy there by the fire.  And that\'s Mrs Paddy there\r\nwith the curls."\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer appeared to receive another shock at this piece of\r\ninformation, which, however, Telson, flattered by her evident interest\r\nin his remarks, did not take to heart.\r\n\r\n"And," said she, presently, with a slight nervousness in her voice, "I\r\nhope you like them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," blurted out Telson, "Paddy\'s not so bad, but the dame\'s an old\r\nbeast, you know--at least, so fellows say.  I say," added he, "don\'t you\r\ntell her I said so!"\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer regarded him with a peculiar smile, which the boy at once\r\ntook to mean a promise.  So he rattled on.  "And she\'s got a sister, or\r\nsomebody hangs about the place, worse than any of them.  Why, when old\r\nWynd--"\r\n\r\n"And," said Miss Stringer, suddenly--"and which house are you in--in the\r\nschoolhouse?"\r\n\r\n"Hullo, then! you know Willoughby?" demanded Telson sharply.\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer looked confused, as well she might, but replied, "Ah! all\r\npublic schools have a schoolhouse, have they not?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said Telson.  "Yes, I\'m a schoolhouse fellow.  I\'m the\r\ncaptain\'s fag, you know--old Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Mr Riddell is the captain, then?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!  Do you know him?"\r\n\r\nPoor Miss Stringer!  How sad it is, to be sure, when once we go astray.\r\nShe, the Griffin of Willoughby, was as much at the mercy of this honest\r\nunconscious fag as if he had caught her in the act of picking a pocket.\r\nFor how could she reveal herself now?\r\n\r\n"I--I think I met him once," she said.\r\n\r\n"Where? at his home, was it?" asked Telson, who seemed to be urged by a\r\nmost fiendish curiosity on the subject.\r\n\r\n"No," faltered the lady; "it was--er--I think it was at Dr Patrick\'s."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said Telson.  "He was up there to tea, I know, just\r\nbefore he was made captain.  But I didn\'t know any one else was there\r\nexcept Paddy and his hyenas."\r\n\r\n"His what, sir!" exclaimed Miss Stringer, in a voice which nearly\r\nstartled Telson off the sofa.\r\n\r\n"I mean, you know, the fellows--?"\r\n\r\n"And where do you live at home?" asked Miss Stringer, determined to\r\nsteer clear of this awkward topic.\r\n\r\n"Oh, London," said Telson; "do you know London?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--it is indeed a wonderful place," said Miss Stringer, "and\r\nwhereabouts does your father live?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my governor\'s in India," began Telson.\r\n\r\n"Your who?" said Miss Stringer, with a feeble attempt at severity.\r\n\r\n"My dad, you know; and I live with my grandfather.  Jolly old boy.  He\r\nwas at Willoughby when he was a boy.  Did you know him then?  I expect\r\nhe\'ll recollect you, you know."\r\n\r\n"I do not think," said Miss Stringer, with a very ruffled countenance,\r\n"that your grandfather and I ever met."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know.  He recollects most of the old people down here, you\r\nknow.  I say, there\'s Parson beckoning; he\'s my chum, you know.  I\r\nexpect he wants me to help with some of the things."\r\n\r\nAnd so saying off he went, leaving Miss Stringer, so to speak, fairly\r\ndoubled up, and in a state of mind which may be more easily imagined\r\nthan described.\r\n\r\nEvery one observed how singularly silent and retiring Miss Stringer was\r\nall that evening.  Some attributed it to the heat of the room, others\r\nfeared she might not be well, others guessed she found the Browns\'\r\nentertainment very slow; but no one, least of all Telson himself, had a\r\nsuspicion of the true reason.\r\n\r\nThat young gentleman and his ally, after finding out that there was not\r\nmuch chance of their services being required to "look after the\r\nthings"--the greengrocer being quite able to deal with the business\r\nsingle-handed--found themselves once more stranded in the drawing-room,\r\nand gradually getting edged back by the skirts, when an unlooked-for\r\ndistinction rescued them from their perilous situation.\r\n\r\nThe distinction was none other than a sign of recognition from the\r\ndoctor and a friendly signal to approach.\r\n\r\nLike a pair of small well-trained circus ponies the two friends obeyed\r\nthe summons and climbed over the intervening skirts.\r\n\r\n"Well, Telson and Parson," said the doctor, shaking hands, "I\'d no idea\r\nyou were here--how are you?"\r\n\r\n"We got a captain\'s permit.  Quite well, thank you, sir."\r\n\r\n"My dear, these are two of our boys, Telson and Parson."\r\n\r\nMrs Patrick regarded the two boys in her usual precise way, and said,--\r\n\r\n"Among so many boys under our roof, I find it impossible to remember\r\nevery face.  And which is Master Telson?"\r\n\r\n"This is Telson," said Parson.  "He\'s in the schoolhouse, you know--"\r\n\r\n"I do not know," said Mrs Patrick, severely.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" said Parson, with genuine astonishment.  "He\'s captain\'s\r\nfag, you know."\r\n\r\n"I must repeat I do not know," reiterated Mrs Patrick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, he\'s only been that a little time, since the sports, you\r\nknow, when old Wyndham left.  I say, ma\'am, are you going to be at the\r\nrace on Wednesday?"\r\n\r\nMrs Patrick looked somewhat baffled as she replied,--\r\n\r\n"I think it very possible."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a jolly good race," said Telson.  "Old Parson is coxing\r\nParrett\'s, and it looks like a win for them.  Only we aren\'t so bad, and\r\nnow Gilks is out of the boat and Riddell\'s settled as cox we ought to\r\nmake a race of it.  Fairbairn\'s quite as long a reach as Bloomfield,\r\nonly he doesn\'t kick his stretcher so hard--does he, Parson?"\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Parson.  "That\'s where we get the pull of you;\r\nbesides, I\'m a lighter weight than Riddell, though he\'s boiled down a\r\ngood bit since he went into training."\r\n\r\n"Good deal depends on who gets the inside berth," said Telson,\r\ndelightfully oblivious of the bewildered Mrs Paddy\'s presence.  "It\'s a\r\njolly long swing round Willow Point for the outsiders--half a length at\r\nleast."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it\'s just as bad round the corner at the finish the other\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Ah! talking about the race, I see," said the doctor, returning to the\r\ngroup at this point.  "So, Telson, Riddell\'s to steer your boat after\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Telson; "it\'s settled now."\r\n\r\n"So that the schoolhouse boat is still the captain\'s boat, eh?  Ah!\r\nParson, though, I suppose, wants the Parrett\'s boat to win."\r\n\r\n"Parson coxes for Parrett\'s," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"Parrett--I mean Mr Parrett--stopped my river-play a week, sir," said\r\nParson, by way of explaining the circumstance; "but I\'ve had captain\'s\r\nleave to row out since, so they kept me in the boat."\r\n\r\nThis sporting conversation went on for some time longer, Mrs Patrick\r\nnot venturing again to join in.  At last the doctor broke up the\r\nconference of his own accord, and our two heroes, once more adrift, went\r\nout for a lounge in the hall, as they explained, to cool themselves, but\r\nreally to be at hand for a bolt into the supper-room whenever the happy\r\nmoment should arrive.\r\n\r\nIt did arrive after what seemed to be a week\'s suspense and then the\r\nhardships and perils of the evening were fully compensated for.  The two\r\nfriends got into a snug corner, "far from the madding crowd," where, to\r\nput it mildly, they spent a very busy half-hour.  They managed it well.\r\nNeither boy helped himself--he wouldn\'t be so greedy; but each helped\r\nthe other.  When Telson saw Parson\'s plate getting empty of sandwiches,\r\nhe most attentively fetched him a clean one with a trifle on it; and\r\nwhen Telson had finally got through his jellies (for he had more than\r\none) it was Parson\'s brotherly hand which assisted him to an ice!\r\n\r\nAs they sat there they positively wished Brown\'s "pa and ma" gave a\r\nparty once a week!\r\n\r\nBut all good things come to an end, and so did this grand party.  Guests\r\nbegan to depart, and among the earliest were the doctor and his ladies.\r\nThe doctor came up to the boys, and said, kindly, "We\'re driving up; you\r\ntwo had better come with us, there\'s plenty of room on the box.  Now, my\r\nlove--now, Miss Stringer."\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer!  Telson nearly fainted as he saw who it was who answered\r\nto the name.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s walk up," he said, entreatingly, to Parson.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind, only Paddy--"\r\n\r\n"Now then, boys," cried the doctor, "there\'s room for one inside.\r\nTelson, will you come?"\r\n\r\nTelson bounded up on to the box without another word, and Parson beside\r\nhim, and the fly drove off.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Parson, old man, I\'m a gone coon!" exclaimed Telson, in tones of\r\nabject misery, as soon as they were clear of the Browns\' premises.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Stringer!"\r\n\r\n"What about her?  Isn\'t she a cad, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and _I told her so_," groaned Telson; "I didn\'t know who she was,\r\nand I said--"\r\n\r\n"Hullo, I say, look there!" exclaimed Parson, suddenly catching his\r\nfriend by the arm.\r\n\r\nThey were passing the Aquarium, which at that moment was disgorging its\r\nvisitors.  Among those who emerged exactly as the doctor\'s fly passed\r\nwere three boys, whom Telson and Parson recognised in a moment.\r\n\r\nThey were Silk and Gilks and another younger boy, who seemed to shrink\r\nfrom observation, and whose head was turned another way as the fly\r\npassed.  The three, immediately on gaining the street, started to run\r\ntowards Willoughby ahead of the fly.\r\n\r\nThe two boys on the box pulled their caps over their eyes, and said not\r\na word till the truants were clear.  Then Telson said, "That was young\r\nWyndham!"\r\n\r\n"I know.  I wonder if Paddy saw them?"\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t think so.  And they didn\'t see us.  I say, will they get in\r\nbefore us?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a shave if they do.  What a row there\'ll be if they don\'t!"\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing that almost immediately after this short dialogue\r\nTelson\'s cap fell off into the road, and the fly had to be pulled up\r\nwhile he and Parson got down and looked for it.  It was a dark night,\r\nand the cap took some time to find.  When finally it was recovered, and\r\nprogress was resumed, full five minutes had been lost over the search,\r\nby which time the truants had got a clear half-mile to the good, and\r\nwere safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE BOAT-RACE.\r\n\r\nThe few days that intervened between the Saturday of Brown\'s party and\r\nthe Wednesday of the great race were days of restless suspense in\r\nWilloughby.  Even Welch\'s caught the contagion, and regretted at the\r\nlast hour that they had withdrawn from the all-important contest.  As to\r\nthe other two Houses, there never had been a year when the excitement\r\nran so high or the rivalry grew so keen.  Somehow the entire politics of\r\nWilloughby appeared to be mixed up in the contest, and it seemed as if\r\nthe result of this one struggle was to decide everything.\r\n\r\nThe crews had worked hard up to the last, watched morning and evening by\r\nanxious spectators from the bank.  The trials had been carefully noted\r\nand times compared, the variations in style had been eagerly criticised,\r\nthe weights of the rowers had become public property, and in short every\r\ndetail likely to influence the result was a subject of almost painful\r\ninterest to the eager partisans on either side.\r\n\r\nAnd every hour seemed to promise a closer race.  Not that Parrett\'s had\r\nfallen off.  On the contrary, they still remained what they had been all\r\nalong, the smartest and strongest crew that Willoughby had ever put upon\r\nthe river.  But the schoolhouse boat had made wonderful strides.  It was\r\nlong since it had ceased to be the laughingstock of the hostile juniors,\r\nand it was some time since its appearance and work had begun to cause a\r\nshade of uneasiness in the minds of a few of the rival house.\r\nFairbairn, far from Bloomfield\'s match in physique or style, had yet\r\ndisplayed an amount of steady, determined work which had astonished most\r\nfellows, and inspired with confidence not only his partisans on the\r\nbank, but the three oarsmen at his back.  By dint of patient, untiring\r\npractice he had worked his crew up to a pitch of training scarcely hoped\r\nfor, and every day the schoolhouse boat had gained in style and speed.\r\n\r\nHad the race been a fortnight or three weeks later few boys would have\r\ncared to prophesy definitely as to the result.  As it was, though\r\nParrett\'s was morally bound to win, it was clear the race would be a\r\nfierce one, and hardly fought every foot.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general opinion in Willoughby that Tuesday evening after\r\nthe last practice had come to an end, and when the boats were finally\r\nhoused for the night only to reappear next day in racing trim.\r\n\r\nYoung Wyndham, as he sat in Riddell\'s study with his books before him,\r\ncould as soon have done a stroke of work as fly over the schoolhouse\r\nelms.  Indeed, it was such a farce for him even to make the attempt that\r\nhe shut up his books and gave up the idea.\r\n\r\n"I say, Riddell," he said, presently, addressing the captain, who,\r\nthough excited too after his own fashion, was poring determinedly over\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n"Well?" asked he, looking up.\r\n\r\n"I say, _do_ you think there\'s any chance of our boat winning?"\r\n\r\nThe boy asked the question so anxiously that one might have supposed his\r\nwhole happiness in life depended on the answer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very hard to say," said Riddell.  "I think we have some chance, at\r\nany rate."\r\n\r\n"You did the course in as good time as Parrett\'s yesterday, didn\'t you?"\r\nsaid Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but we had a better tide," said Riddell.\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s face clouded, for he knew it was true.\r\n\r\n"You _must_ win, I say," said he, almost fiercely.\r\n\r\nRiddell smiled.\r\n\r\n"I mean to oblige you if I can, for one," said he.\r\n\r\n"If they win," said Wyndham, "it\'ll be--"\r\n\r\nBut what it would be the youthful enthusiast lacked words to express.\r\n\r\nRiddell turned again to his writing.\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you better finish your work?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t!" exclaimed Wyndham.  "Who could work just before the\r\nrace?"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he got up and gathered together his things.\r\n\r\nRiddell was sorry for this.  He had hoped the boy would stay.  Amid all\r\nhis fresh duties the new captain had kept his eye on his old friend\'s\r\nbrother, and of late he had seen things which made him uneasy.  Wyndham\r\nwas on friendly terms again with his two undesirable patrons, and\r\nsimultaneously his work in the library and his visits to Riddell\'s own\r\nstudy had become less regular.  It all meant something, Riddell knew;\r\nand he knew, too, that that something was not any good.  He made one\r\nattempt to detain the boy.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t going?" he said kindly.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  It\'s really no use grinding, to-night, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you stop and keep me company, though?" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n"You\'re working," said the boy.  "I\'ll come to-morrow.  Good-night."\r\n\r\nAnd he went, leaving Riddell very uncomfortable.  Why should he be so\r\neager to go?  Why should he always seem so restless now whenever he was\r\nin that study?  Why should he always avoid any reference to--\r\n\r\nAh! here he was back again.  A gleam of hope shot through Riddell\'s\r\nbreast as he saw the door open and Wyndham re-enter.  Perhaps, after\r\nall, the boy was going to stay and give him a chance.  But no, Wyndham\r\nhad come back for his knife, which Riddell had borrowed for sharpening a\r\npencil.  That was all he wanted; and having recovered it he departed\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nRiddell spent the rest of that evening in low spirits.  He had been\r\nbaulked, and worse than that, he felt other hands were playing their\r\ngame more successfully, and that amongst them all young Wyndham was\r\ngoing wrong.\r\n\r\nSo the eve of the great boat-race was anything but a cheerful evening\r\nfor the new captain.\r\n\r\nBut with the morning even Riddell could hardly harbour any thoughts\r\noutside the event of the day.  Morning school that Wednesday was a farce\r\nall over Willoughby.  Even the doctor seemed absent-minded, while one or\r\ntwo of the junior masters gave up the attempt in despair.\r\n\r\nThe race was fixed for three o\'clock, when the tide would be running up\r\nat its fastest, and long before that hour every advantageous point of\r\nview on the banks was secured by eager spectators.  These were by no\r\nmeans all Willoughby boys, for the school boat-race was always more or\r\nless of an event in Shellport itself, whose inhabitants flocked in large\r\nnumbers to the scene of the contest.\r\n\r\nCarnages lined the banks on either side for a considerable distance, and\r\nas usual the doctor\'s party assembled in great force on Willow Point.\r\nThe towing-path was jealously kept clear for the schoolboys, who trooped\r\ndown in force the moment after lunch, and took possession of their\r\nplaces along the course.  Some crowded at the starting-point.  These\r\nwere chiefly the more athletic heroes of the school, whose flannels and\r\nrunning-shoes bespoke their intention of following the race on foot.\r\nOthers, less actively inclined, massed at various critical points along\r\nthe course, some at the finish, but more opposite Willow Point, which\r\nbeing just three-quarters of the way down, and almost within view of the\r\ngoal, was generally considered the most advantageous point of view of\r\nthe whole race.\r\n\r\nAt this point, in a snug corner above the path, with a fine view of the\r\nsharp bend of the river, and of the reaches up and down stream which met\r\nthere, sat Gilks and Silk.  They knew probably as well as any one that\r\nthe crisis of the race was pretty sure to be played out at Willow\r\nCorner, and not a few late comers looked up at their commanding perch\r\nwith envy.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the young \'un?" said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Running with the race," said Gilks.  "I couldn\'t dissuade him.  He\'s\r\ngone daft over the thing."\r\n\r\nSilk laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'ll be a blow to him, then.  Young fool.  I say, he was at\r\nhis father confessor\'s last night.  I wonder if he\'ll let out about\r\nSaturday night?"\r\n\r\n"Not he.  That is," said Gilks, viciously, "I don\'t think he will."\r\n\r\n"Well, it might be warmish for him if he did."\r\n\r\n"Very warmish," said Gilks, with a scowl, which it was just as well for\r\nWyndham\'s comfort he did not see.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, during which Gilks whistled to himself, and Silk\r\nregarded his ally with a smile.\r\n\r\n"You are a nice boy!" he broke out presently.  And the laugh which\r\ngreeted this very unoriginal observation closed the conversation for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, down at the boat-house things were getting very lively.\r\n\r\nTelson, Philpot, Pilbury, Cusack, King, and other of our juvenile\r\nfriends, who, with their usual modesty, proposed to run along with the\r\nrace, and now formed part of the crowd which awaited the start, kept up\r\na boisterous chorus of shouts, some of defiance, some of derision, some\r\nof applause, addressed alternately to foe and friend.\r\n\r\nThe young Welchers especially, having no personal interest in the race,\r\nfelt themselves delightfully free to make themselves objectionable to\r\nall parties, and took full advantage of the circumstance.\r\n\r\nThey howled at everybody and everything.  Whenever King and Bosher\r\ngreeted the appearance of the Parrett\'s boat with a friendly cheer they\r\nhooted; and no sooner did Telson sing out to welcome the crew of his\r\nhouse, but they caterwauled derisively in the same direction.\r\n\r\n"Jolly lot _they_ know about rowing!" yelled Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you give them some lessons?" retorted Telson, hotly.\r\n\r\n"Boo--hoo!  Who got kicked out his boat!  Young muller, couldn\'t steer a\r\ntub."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tub you, young Pilbury, see if I don\'t, presently," replied\r\nTelson.\r\n\r\n"Never mind them," shouted King, "can\'t even make up a boat; pack of\r\nfunks, all of them!"\r\n\r\n"Hullo! who are you?" cried Philpot, rounding on these new assailants.\r\n"We\'d have a boat, never fear, if there was any chance of fair play."\r\n\r\n"Lot of fair play you\'d want, to turn the boat round and round and catch\r\ncrabs every other second!"\r\n\r\n"There are our fellows!" cried Wyndham, raising a loud cheer as\r\nFairbairn, Coates, Porter, Crossfield, and Riddell appeared on the\r\nlanding stage.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! schoolhouse, hurrah!"\r\n\r\n"Ye-ow, look at them--there\'s a lot!" hooted the Welchers.\r\n\r\n"There\'s old Parson!" yelled Telson, Bosher, and King, as the youthful\r\nhero in question strutted magnificently down to the landing.\r\n\r\n"What cheer, stuck-up jackass?" howled the Welchers, with an insulting\r\nlaugh; "why don\'t you grin?"\r\n\r\nThis remark was suggested by Parson grandly waving his handkerchief and\r\nsmiling to his admiring friends.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to quit these friends and make our way to the boats\r\nthemselves, which now lie waiting for their crews to embark.\r\n\r\nThis is always a tedious process for onlookers.  The shifting of\r\nstretchers, the getting-out of oars, the arrangement of rudder strings,\r\nand the delicate trimming of the boat, may be interesting enough to the\r\ncrews themselves, but only feed the impatience of onlookers.\r\n\r\nAnd as usual hitches are bound to occur.  Coates has got the oar\r\nbelonging to Crossfield.  And when this mistake has been remedied,\r\nBloomfield in the other boat suddenly discovers that his stretcher is a\r\nlittle weak, and insists on waiting till a new one is brought.\r\n\r\nFinally everything is ready, and the two boats slowly swing out into\r\nmid-stream.  The schoolhouse boat has won the toss, for it takes up the\r\ninside berth, amid the triumphant cheers of its partisans.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! you\'re inside," they cry.\r\n\r\n"Mind you put them into the bank," is the derisive echo of the enemy.\r\n\r\n"Now, Fairbairn; now, you fellows," cries Wyndham\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Now, boss Riddell--mind your eye.  Pull your left when you want to go\r\nright," shout the facetious Welchers.\r\n\r\nRiddell had long got past the stage of being flurried by shouts from the\r\nbank.  He feels nervous undoubtedly, but he does not look it, as he\r\nquietly tries his rudder-lines and settles himself on his seat.\r\n\r\nFairbairn is as cool as ever.  To look at him he might be just starting\r\nfor a quiet saunter up-stream.  And the crew behind him are equally\r\ncomposed, as they lie on their oars waiting for the start.\r\n\r\nBut the Parrett\'s crew, as they come smartly up and take their outside\r\nberth, receive an ovation far beyond that of their rivals.  They are\r\nundoubtedly the popular crew, as well as the favourites.\r\n\r\nEvery man in the boat has done something for Willoughby in times past,\r\nand as the boys see their heroes ready now for a fresh triumph, they\r\nforget all about their little tyrannies indoors, and cheer them like\r\nmad.\r\n\r\n"Bravo Parrett\'s.  Bravo, Bloomfield!  Hurrah, captain!  You\'re to win."\r\n\r\nEven the Welchers for the moment join in the popular clamour.\r\n\r\n"Go it, you cripples!" cries Cusack, encouragingly; "no milksop\r\ncaptains.  Two to one on Bloomfield!"\r\n\r\nAll this time the boats are lying in position.  Mr Parrett on the\r\nlittle steam-launch behind surveys them critically, and satisfies\r\nhimself that all is square.  Then he advances to the prow of his boat\r\nand shouts the usual question.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he gives the word, and the two boats dart forward like\r\narrows from a bow, and the race has begun.\r\n\r\nGilks and Silk up above Willow Corner heard the shout which greeted the\r\nstart, and turned anxiously towards the direction from which it came.\r\n\r\n"They\'re off now!" said Silk, trying to appear more unconcerned than he\r\nreally was.\r\n\r\n"Yes; no mistake about it!" said Gilks, whose anxiety was certainly not\r\nless than that of his friend.\r\n\r\n"How long before we see them?"\r\n\r\n"Three minutes; they ought to get into the School Reach by then."\r\n\r\nNeither spoke for a minute.  Then Silk said, "What a row the fellows are\r\nmaking!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Gilks; "there\'s a bigger crowd than I ever saw down this\r\nyear."\r\n\r\nAnother silence.  And then presently in the far distance, at the end of\r\nthe School Reach, they could see first the smoke of Mr Parrett\'s\r\nlaunch, then a black moving crowd on the bank, and finally two white\r\nspecks on the water.\r\n\r\n"There they are!" said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Can you tell which is which?" asked Silk.\r\n\r\n"No, not yet."\r\n\r\nAn anxious minute followed.  The doctor and his party on the point\r\nopposite left their tent and came down to the water\'s edge; spectators\r\nwho had been getting tired of waiting now freshened up and made final\r\nand desperate attempts to improve their position, while those who meant\r\nto fall in with the runners buttoned their jackets and turned up their\r\ntrouser ends.\r\n\r\n"Schoolhouse inside!" exclaimed Gilks, suddenly, as the sun momentarily\r\ncaught the blue oars of the inside boat.\r\n\r\nThis was all that could be ascertained for the moment.  From where they\r\nsat the blue and the red flags seemed to be coming towards them exactly\r\nabreast.\r\n\r\nThe crowd advanced with a roar, above which it was impossible to hear\r\nthe name of the leading crew.  But presently, as the two boats\r\napproached the corner, a slight turn inwards enabled them to answer the\r\nquestion for themselves.\r\n\r\n"We lead!" exclaimed Silk.\r\n\r\nSilk was a Welcher and Gilks a schoolhouse boy, but "we" meant\r\nParrett\'s.\r\n\r\nYes, the red flag was ahead, though only a little.\r\n\r\n"How long before they\'re at the point?"\r\n\r\n"Half a minute.  I say, how splendidly the schoolhouse are steering,\r\nthough!"\r\n\r\nSilk laughed.  "More than Parrett\'s are!  Young Parson\'s taking them\r\nround rather sharp, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"No; he always turns in like that; it\'s better than the long sweep.  Now\r\nlook out!"\r\n\r\nDuring this brief dialogue the two boats had come on towards the corner.\r\nAs far as Gilks and Silk could see at present Parrett\'s led by about\r\nhalf a length, which advantage, however, it stood to lose owing to its\r\noutside position at the corner.  Parson, however, knew what he was about\r\neven better than Riddell, who had kept a magnificent course down the\r\nreach, but who now seemed afraid to take full advantage of the sharp\r\ncorner.  The Parrett\'s coxswain, on the other hand, with his half-length\r\nto the good, began turning his boat\'s head early, even at the risk of\r\nrunning dangerously close on his rival\'s water, and so saved as much as\r\npossible of the lost ground.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious moment, for as the boats came round that corner so the\r\nrace usually depended.  The crowd on the banks well knew the crisis, and\r\nshouted out their warnings and encouragements to the rival coxswains\r\nwith redoubled eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Now then, Riddell! round you go!  Pull your right!"\r\n\r\n"Steered indeed, Parrett\'s!  Bravo, Parson!"\r\n\r\nThe corner was half-turned, the boats lay nearly level, each coxswain\r\npulling hard with his right line, when suddenly there was a shock in the\r\nParrett\'s boat, followed by a loud shout from Parson, and next moment\r\nthe boat was shooting helplessly straight towards the bank, from which\r\nit was only saved by a prompt order to "Backwater all!" from Bloomfield.\r\n\r\nWhat could it be?  The shouts on the bank died away into sudden\r\nstillness, and fellows forgot even to keep up with the schoolhouse boat,\r\nwhich, followed by the steam-launch, rowed steadily on towards the\r\nwinning-post.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?  The answer soon became known, when Parson, standing in his\r\nboat, waved the broken end of a rudder-line above his head.  At the\r\ncritical point of the race this had failed, and in consequence all the\r\nefforts of the rowers were useless, and--and the schoolhouse boat was\r\nHead of the River!\r\n\r\nThe rage, excitement, and disappointment at such an unlooked-for\r\ntermination to the great struggle was beyond description, as the reader\r\nmay imagine.  A general rush was made for the unlucky boat, and shouts\r\nand recriminations and taunts and condolences bore witness to the mixed\r\nfeelings of the spectators.\r\n\r\nSome demanded a fresh race there and then, some suggested foul play,\r\nothers urged the boat to row on and make the best race they could of it,\r\nothers boldly claimed the victory for Parrett\'s, since they led at the\r\nmoment of the accident.\r\n\r\nAmidst all this tumult the unlucky boat slowly backed into mid-stream,\r\nand turned towards home, Parson steering no longer by rudder but by word\r\nof mouth.  As it did so, a distant report announced that the schoolhouse\r\nboat had reached the winning-post; whereat the Parrett partisans set up\r\na loud defiant shout, which they maintained during the entire homeward\r\nprogress of their ill-starred boat.\r\n\r\nAmong the few who remained on the scene of the accident were Gilks and\r\nSilk, both pale and agitated.\r\n\r\nThe latter, as has been said, was painfully interested in the result of\r\nthe race.  To him the defeat of Parrett\'s meant more than the mere\r\ndisappointment of a hope or the humiliation by a rival.  It meant the\r\nloss of a good deal more money than he possessed, and the miscarriage of\r\na good deal which he had expected with absolute confidence to win.  No\r\nwonder then that his face was white and his voice trembling as he\r\nrounded on his friend.\r\n\r\n"You fool!" exclaimed he, with an oath.\r\n\r\nIt was rather hard surely on Gilks, who may have encouraged his friend\r\nto rely on the victory of the Parrett\'s boat, but who certainly was as\r\nmuch astounded and mortified by the accident as he was.\r\n\r\n"There must be another race," said he, hurriedly.  "They can\'t take this\r\nas decisive, I tell you.  They _must_ have another."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t have said so if the right boat had won," said Silk, with a\r\nsneer.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t make it out," said Gilks, looking very miserable.\r\n\r\n"Fools never can," snarled Silk, turning on his heel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nFOUL PLAY.\r\n\r\nWilloughby reassembled after the eventful boat-race in a state of fever.\r\nThe great event which was to settle everything had settled nothing, and\r\nthe suspense and excitement which was to have been set at rest remained\r\nstill as unsatisfied as ever, and intensified by a feeling of rage and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nAs boys dropped in in groups from the course, and clustered round the\r\nschool gate, one might have supposed by their troubled faces that\r\ninstead of a rudder-line having broken both crews had been capsized and\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThe Parrett\'s partisans particularly were loud in their clamour for a\r\nnew race, and many of them freely insinuated foul play as the cause of\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse, on the other hand, indignantly repelled the charge, and\r\ndared their opponents defiantly to meet them again.  And amidst all this\r\nwrangling and bickering, the Welchers dispensed their taunts and\r\ninvectives with even-handed impartiality, and filled in just what was\r\nwanted to make the scene one of utter confusion and Babel.\r\n\r\n"I tell you we\'d have beaten them hollow," shouted Wibberly to the\r\ncompany in general.\r\n\r\n"No you wouldn\'t!" retorted Wyndham; "we were ahead and our men were as\r\nfresh as yours, every bit!"\r\n\r\n"Ya--boo--cheats!  Told you there\'d be no fair play with such a pack,"\r\nshouted the Welchers.\r\n\r\n"Look here, who are you calling a cheat?" said Wyndham, very red in the\r\nface, edging up to the speaker.\r\n\r\n"You, if you like," shouted Pilbury and Cusack.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll knock your heads together when I catch you," said Wyndham, with\r\nlofty disgust, not intending to put himself out for two juniors.\r\n\r\nA loud laugh greeted the threat.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, fellows were running up every moment.  Some who had been\r\nwaiting for the boats at the winning-post had only just heard the news,\r\nand came in red-hot with excitement to learn particulars.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all a vile dodge," howled Wibberly, "to get their boat to the head\r\nof the river."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet anything the precious captain\'s at the bottom of it," shouted\r\nanother.  "He\'d stick at nothing, I know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and you\'ll see, now they\'ll funk another race!"\r\n\r\n"Who\'ll funk another race?" roared the hot-headed Wyndham.  "I\'ll row\r\nyou myself, you asses, the lot of you."\r\n\r\nAnother derisive laugh followed at the speaker\'s expense.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not our fault if your line broke," cried a schoolhouse boy.  "It\'s\r\nyour lookout.  You should have seen it was right before you started."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  You wouldn\'t have been so anxious for a new race if it was our\r\nline had broken," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we would.  We\'re not afraid of you!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are."\r\n\r\n"No, we aren\'t.  You\'re a set of cheats.  Couldn\'t win by fair means, so\r\nyou\'ve tried foul."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll fight any one who says so," retorted Wyndham.\r\n\r\nHow long the wrangle might have gone on, and to what riot it might have\r\nled, cannot be told.  It was at its hottest, and a general fight seemed\r\nimminent, when a diversion was caused by the sudden appearance of Parson\r\nrunning at full speed up the path from the river.\r\n\r\nThere was something unusual in the looks and manner of the Parretts\'\r\ncoxswain, which even his misadventure that afternoon was not sufficient\r\nto account for.  He bore tidings of some sort, it was evident, and by\r\ncommon consent the clamour of the crowd was suspended as he approached.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to hail him at shouting distance was Telson.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up, old man?" he cried.\r\n\r\nParson rushed on a dozen yards or so before he answered.  Then he\r\nyelled, in a voice half-choked with excitement, "The line was cut!  It\'s\r\nfoul play!"\r\n\r\nThe howl which arose from the agitated crowd at this amazing piece of\r\nnews--amazing even to those who had most freely raised the cry of foul\r\nplay--was one the like of which Willoughby never heard before or since.\r\nMingled rage, scorn, incredulity, derision, all found vent in that one\r\nshout--and then suddenly died into silence as Parson began again.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve looked at the place where it broke," he gasped.  "It\'s a clean\r\ncut half-way through.  I knew it was foul play!"\r\n\r\nOnce again the shout drowned his voice.\r\n\r\n"Who did it?" shrieked a voice, before Parson could resume.\r\n\r\nParson glared round wrathfully for the speaker.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," he replied.  "Sorry for him if I did!"\r\n\r\nThis valiant invective from the honest little fag failed even to appear\r\nludicrous in the midst of the general excitement.  Further words were\r\nnow interrupted by the appearance of the Parretts\' crew coming slowly up\r\nthe walk.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for a general cheer and rush in their direction, in\r\nthe midst of which the defeated heroes with difficulty struggled up to\r\nthe school.  Wrath and indignation were on all their faces.  In reply to\r\nthe hundred inquiries showered upon them they said nothing, but forced\r\ntheir way through the press sullenly, heedless of the cheers of their\r\nsympathisers or the silence of their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe crowd slowly fell back to let them pass, and watched them disappear\r\ninto the school.  Then they turned again towards the path from the\r\nriver, and waited with grim purpose.\r\n\r\nThe news announced by Parson and confirmed by the black looks of the\r\ninjured crew had fallen like a thunderbolt, and for the moment\r\nWilloughby was stunned.  The boys could not--would not--believe that one\r\nof their number could be guilty of such an act.  And yet, how could they\r\ndisbelieve it?\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes there was a cry of "Here they are!" and at the same\r\nmoment the schoolhouse crew appeared on the walk.  They, victors though\r\nthey were, looked troubled and dispirited as they approached, talking\r\neagerly among themselves, and unconcerned apparently about the crowd\r\nwhich in ominous silence awaited them.\r\n\r\nThey certainly did not look like guilty persons, and it is most probable\r\nnot even the wildest libeller in Willoughby would have cared positively\r\nto charge any one of them with the dishonourable deed.\r\n\r\nBut for all that, they had won in consequence of that deed, and that was\r\nquite sufficient to set three-fourths of the crowd against them.\r\n\r\nAs they came up a loud groan and cries of "Cheats!  Foul play!" suddenly\r\narose.  Startled by the unexpected demonstration, the five heroes looked\r\nup with flushed faces.\r\n\r\n"Cheats!  Cowards!" reiterated the hostile section, beginning at the\r\nsame time to surge towards them.\r\n\r\nForemost among these was Tucker of Welch\'s house and Wibberly of\r\nParrett\'s, who, as the crowd behind pressed forward, were carried with\r\ntheir abusive taunts on their lips into the midst of the schoolhouse\r\ngroup.  The latter, as may be imagined, were in anything but the humour\r\nfor an assault of this sort, and their leaders instantly resented it in\r\na _very_ practical manner.\r\n\r\n"Where are you coming to?" demanded Fairbairn, flinging Wibberly from\r\nhim into the arms of his followers.\r\n\r\nBefore Wibberly could recover his balance the crowd had closed in by a\r\nsudden impulse, and with a loud shout had set upon the crew.\r\n\r\n"Have them over, Parrett\'s!" shouted a voice, as Wibberly staggered back\r\na second time before Fairbairn\'s stalwart arm, while at the same moment\r\nTucker received a similar rebuff from Crossfield.\r\n\r\nThe summons was promptly answered, and a dash was made on the five\r\nschoolhouse boys with a view to carrying out the threat literally, when\r\nWyndham\'s voice shouted, "Rescue here! schoolhouse, come on!"\r\n\r\nInstantly the whole crowd seemed to resolve itself by magic into two\r\nparties, and a short but desperate battle ensued.\r\n\r\nThe fire had been waiting for weeks for a match, and now the flare-up\r\nhad come.  Nobody knew whom he hit out at or by whom he was attacked\r\nthat forenoon.  The pent-up irritation of half a term found vent in that\r\nfamous battle in which the schoolhouse boys fought their way inch by\r\ninch up to the door of their house.\r\n\r\nLuckily for them, the most formidable of their rivals were not upon the\r\nfield of action, and in due time the compact phalanx of seniors, aided\r\nby Wyndham and his band of recruits, forced their way through superior\r\nnumbers, and finally burst triumphantly through and gained their\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nBut the victory was hardly bought, for the slaughter had been great.\r\n\r\nCoates had a black eye, and Porter\'s jacket was torn from his back.\r\nRiddell had twice been knocked down and trodden on, while Wyndham,\r\nTelson, and others of the rescuing party were barely recognisable\r\nthrough dust and bruises.  On the other side the loss had been even\r\ngreater.  Tucker and Wibberly, the only two monitors engaged, were\r\ncompletely doubled up, while the number of maimed and disabled Limpets\r\nand juniors was nearly beyond counting.\r\n\r\nSo ended the great battle at the school gate, and it ended only just in\r\ntime, for as the schoolhouse boys finally gained their quarters, and the\r\nenemy picked itself up and turned surlily schoolwards, the doctor and\r\nhis party arrived on the scene and gave a finishing touch to the rout.\r\n\r\nThat evening was a sore one for Willoughby.  Sore not only in respect of\r\nbruised bodies and swollen faces, but still more in the sense of\r\ndisappointment, suspicion, and foul play.\r\n\r\nAmong the most violent of the Parrett\'s the whole mystery of the thing\r\nwas perfectly clear.  These philosophers could see it all from beginning\r\nto end, and were astonished any one else should be so dull as not to see\r\nit too.\r\n\r\n"Of course, it\'s a regularly arranged thing," said Wibberly, whose face\r\nwas enveloped in a handkerchief and whose lips were unusually thick.\r\n"They\'ve vowed all along to keep their boat at the head of the river,\r\nand they\'ve managed it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said another.  "They knew what they had to expect if Bloomfield\r\ngot there.  I can see it all."\r\n\r\n"But you don\'t mean to say," said Strutter, "the Premier," "that you\r\nthink any one of those fellows would do such a thing as cut our rope?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Wibberly.  "I don\'t see why they shouldn\'t.  I\r\ndon\'t fancy they\'d stick at a trifle, the cads!"\r\n\r\n"If Gilks had been in the boat," said another, "I could have believed it\r\nof him, but he was as anxious for us to win as we were ourselves."\r\n\r\n"No wonder; he and his friend Silk have been betting right and left on\r\nus, I hear."\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose there\'s bound to be a new race," said Strutter.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," replied Wibberly.  "I\'d be just as well pleased if\r\nBloomfield refused.  The vile cheats!"\r\n\r\nBloomfield, be it said to his credit, was no party to these reckless\r\naccusations.  Mortified as he was beyond description, and disappointed\r\nby the collapse of his ambition, he yet scouted the idea of any one of\r\nhis five rivals being guilty of so dirty a trick as the cutting of his\r\nboat\'s rudder-line.  At the same time he was as convinced as any one\r\nthat foul play had been at the bottom of the accident, and the\r\nperpetrator of the mean act was undoubtedly a schoolhouse boy.  What\r\nmortified him most was that he did not feel as positive by any means as\r\nothers that his boat, without the accident, would have won the race.  He\r\nhad been astonished and even disheartened by the performance of the\r\nrival crew, who had stuck to him in a manner he had not looked for, and\r\nwhich had boded seriously for the final result.\r\n\r\nIt was this reflection, more even than the thought of the broken line,\r\nwhich troubled him that evening.  Could it be possible that his luck was\r\ndeserting him?\r\n\r\nHis companions were troubled by no such suggestion.  Indignation was the\r\nuppermost feeling in their breasts.  Whoever had done the deed, it was a\r\nvile action, and till the culprit was brought to justice the whole\r\nschoolhouse was responsible in their eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wonder a single one of them can hold up his head," exclaimed Game.\r\n\r\n"I hope to goodness Bloomfield won\'t demand a fresh race.  _I_ won\'t row\r\nif he does," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"And the worst of it is they\'ll try to make out now they would have won\r\nin any case.  I heard one of them say so myself this very afternoon."\r\n\r\n"Let them say what they like," said Ashley.  "Nobody will believe them."\r\n\r\nPerhaps these hot-headed heroes, had they been able to overhear a\r\nconversation that was going on at that very time in the captain\'s study,\r\nwould have discovered that at any rate it was not the immediate\r\nintention of the schoolhouse to insist that the victory was theirs.\r\n\r\nRiddell had recovered somewhat from his rough handling that afternoon,\r\nbut he looked pale and dejected as, along with his friend Fairbairn, he\r\nsat and discussed for the twentieth time the event of the day.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite evident we must offer them a fresh race," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so," said Fairbairn.  "It\'s hard lines, for I expect it\r\nwon\'t be easy to get our men up to the mark again after they are once\r\nrun down."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t help that," said Riddell.  "It\'s the least we can do."\r\n\r\n"Of course.  But I don\'t see, Riddell, old man, that we are bound to\r\nhang down our heads over this business.  Whoever did it did as mean a\r\ntrick to us as ever he did to them.  I\'d like to have him a minute or\r\ntwo, even if he was my own brother."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Riddell, "to my mind it seems like a disgrace to the whole\r\nhouse, and the least we can do is to offer to row again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, rather; that\'s settled.  I say," added Fairbairn, "I\'d give\r\nanything to get at the bottom of it.  I saw the boats locked up last\r\nnight, and I was there when they were taken out this morning.  I can\'t\r\nimagine how it was done."\r\n\r\n"It seemed a clean cut, didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; about three-quarters of the way through.  Whoever did it must have\r\nbeen up to his business, for he only touched the right cord on which all\r\nthe strain comes at the corner."\r\n\r\n"It must have been done between five o\'clock yesterday and this\r\nmorning," said Riddell.  "If the cut had been there yesterday the line\r\nwould have given at the corner to a certainty."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; it must have been done in the night."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t the boatman know anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"No; I asked him.  He says no one opened the door after the boats had\r\ngone in except himself and the boat-boy."\r\n\r\n"It\'s horribly mysterious," said Riddell.  "But, I say, hadn\'t we better\r\noffer the new race at once?"\r\n\r\n"All serene."\r\n\r\n"Had we better write?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\n"No; why?  What\'s the use of looking ashamed?" said Fairbairn; "let\'s go\r\nto them.  Bloomfield\'s sure to be in his study."\r\n\r\nThe two boys went accordingly, and found the Parrett\'s captain in his\r\nstudy along with Game and Ashley.  It was rarely indeed that the\r\nschoolhouse seniors penetrated uninvited into the headquarters of their\r\nrivals.  But on this occasion they had a right cause at heart and honest\r\nconsciences to back them.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident at a glance they had fallen on unfriendly society.\r\nGame, quite apart from his state of mind with regard to the accident,\r\nhad not forgotten his repulse at the hands of the new captain a week or\r\ntwo ago, nor had Bloomfield quite got over the indirect snub he had\r\nreceived on the same occasion.\r\n\r\nRiddell himself had almost forgotten the circumstance, and attributed\r\nthe unencouraging aspect of the rival seniors entirely to the day\'s\r\nmisadventure.\r\n\r\n"Excuse us coming over," said he, feeling that a beginning must be made\r\nto the interview, "but we wanted to tell you how sorry our fellows are\r\nabout the race."\r\n\r\n"Have you found out who did it?" asked Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"No," said Riddell, "and we can\'t even guess."\r\n\r\n"But what we came for specially," broke in Fairbairn at this point, "was\r\nto say we are quite ready to row you again any day you like."\r\n\r\nThere was a touch of defiance in the tone of the schoolhouse stroke\r\nwhich was particularly irritating to the Parrett\'s boys.\r\n\r\n"Of course, we would row you--" began Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"But we don\'t mean to," broke in Game, "till this ugly business is\r\ncleared up."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"You know what we mean," said Game, warmly.  "As soon as you find out\r\nwho cut our line we\'ll go out on the river again."\r\n\r\n"Yes; we don\'t mean to row you till that\'s done," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"How on earth are we to find out who cut your line any more than you?"\r\nsaid Fairbairn, losing his temper.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt he must be a schoolhouse fellow," said Bloomfield, who\r\nbut for his friends would have been disposed to accept the challenge.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he is," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t row again till we know who he is," repeated Ashley.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose _we_ know who he is?" demanded Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"You\'re the proper people to find out, that\'s all I know," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"Then you mean to say you won\'t row again?" asked Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"No, if it comes to that," said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Why," said Game, "the same thing might happen again."\r\n\r\n"If you\'d looked to your lines before you started," said Fairbairn,\r\nhotly, "it wouldn\'t have happened."\r\n\r\n"We shall certainly make a point of looking at them again when next we\r\nrow you," said Ashley, with a sneer.\r\n\r\nFairbairn seemed inclined to retort, but a look from Riddell deterred\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Then you won\'t row again?" he repeated once more.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then we claim to-day\'s race," said Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"You can claim what you like," said Game.\r\n\r\n"And our boat remains at the head of the river."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t matter to us where it remains," replied Ashley.  "You may\r\nthink what you like and we\'ll think what we like."\r\n\r\nIt was evidently useless to attempt further parley, and the two\r\nschoolhouse boys accordingly retired, bitterly disappointed to be\r\nthwarted of their only chance of righting themselves and their house in\r\nthe eyes of Willoughby.\r\n\r\nIt soon got to be known there was to be no second race, and, as usual,\r\nall sorts of stories accompanied the rumour.  The enemies of the\r\nschoolhouse said openly that they had refused Bloomfield\'s demand for a\r\nnew race, and intended to stick to their ill-gotten laurels in spite of\r\neverybody.  On the other side it was as freely asserted that Parrett\'s\r\nhad funked it; and some went even so far to hint that the snapping of\r\nthe rope happened fortunately for the boat, and saved it under cover of\r\nan accident from the disgrace of a defeat.  The few who knew the real\r\nstory considered Bloomfield was quite right in refusing another race\r\ntill the culprit of the first should be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nBut the two fellows on whom the announcement fell most severely were\r\nGilks and Silk.  For if the race of that day was to stand, the\r\nschoolhouse boat had definitely won the race, and consequently they were\r\nboth losers to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThey had counted almost certainly on a second race, but now that this\r\nhad been decided against, their wrath and dismay knew no bounds.  They\r\nspent the evening in vituperations and angry discussion, and ended it in\r\nwhat was very little short of a downright quarrel.  Indeed, if young\r\nWyndham had not opportunely arrived on the scene shortly before bedtime\r\nand created a diversion, the quarrel might have come to blows.\r\n\r\nWyndham burst into the room suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Has either of you seen my knife?" he enquired; "I\'ve lost it."\r\n\r\n"Have you?" inquired Silk.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I fancy I left it here last night.  I say, have you heard\r\nParrett\'s won\'t accept a new race?"\r\n\r\n"I wonder why?" asked Silk.\r\n\r\n"Because they say they won\'t have out their boat again till the fellow\'s\r\nfound who cut the lines."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t blame them--do you, Gilks?" said Silk.  "I suppose\r\nthere\'s no idea who he is?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," said Wyndham; "I wish to goodness there was.  Some fool, I\r\nexpect, who\'s been betting against Parrett\'s."\r\n\r\n"I could show you a fool who\'s been betting on Parrett\'s," said Silk,\r\n"and who\'s decidedly up a tree now!  I say, young \'un, I suppose you\r\ncouldn\'t lend me a sov. till the end of the term?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve only got half-a-sov. in the world," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll try and make that do, thanks," said Silk.\r\n\r\nWyndham pulled out his purse rather ruefully and handed him the coin.\r\n\r\n"Mind you let me have it back, please," he said, "as I\'m saving up for a\r\nracket.  And I say," added he, leaving, "if you do come across my knife,\r\nlet\'s have it, will you?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nBOSHER, HIS DIARY.\r\n\r\nProbably no two boys in all Willoughby were more excited over the result\r\nof the famous boat-race than Parson and his dear friend Telson.  And it\r\nis hardly necessary to state that this agitation arose from totally\r\nconflicting reasons.\r\n\r\nParson\'s indignation found solace in the most sweeping and vehement\r\ninvectives his vocabulary could afford against the unknown author of the\r\ndastardly outrage upon his rudder-line.  By an easy effort of\r\nimagination he included the whole schoolhouse, root and branch, in his\r\nanathemas, and by a very trifling additional effort he discovered that\r\nthe objects of his censure were guilty, every one of them, not only of\r\nthis particular crime, but of every crime in the Newgate Calendar, from\r\npicking pockets to murder.  He fully agreed with the decision of his\r\nchiefs to have nothing more to do with such a graceless crew till the\r\ninjury was atoned for; and meanwhile he felt himself at perfect\r\nliberty--nay, it was his painful duty--to insult, abuse, and maltreat,\r\nas occasion offered, every one unlucky enough to wear the schoolhouse\r\nribbon on his cap.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, it may be imagined his friend Telson (who, by the\r\nway, had barely recovered from the shock of Brown\'s party) found himself\r\nin a very delicate position.  For in the whole of his code of honour two\r\npoints were paramount with him.  One was loyalty to the schoolhouse, the\r\nother was loyalty to Parson.  How these two duties could be carried out\r\nnow, at one and the same time, was a source of much anxiety to the\r\nperplexed Augustus.\r\n\r\nHe too was as indignant about the whole affair as his friend.  But his\r\nwrath was aimed first of all against those who dared to insinuate that\r\nany schoolhouse boy could have been guilty of the evil deed, and next\r\nagainst the Parretts\' authorities for refusing Riddell\'s and Fairbairn\'s\r\noffer of a new race.\r\n\r\nHe and his friend had a long and painful discussion of the whole\r\nquestion an evening or two later in the study of the latter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well," said he, "to say it\'s a schoolhouse chap has done\r\nit--"\r\n\r\n"I tell you a schoolhouse chap _must_ have done it," said Parson.  "Who\r\nelse would do such a dirty trick?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll fight you, old man, if you go on like that," observed the\r\nschoolhouse fag.\r\n\r\n"Oh, beg pardon," said Parson, apologetically.  "I mean who else could\r\nhave done it, you know?"\r\n\r\n"A Welcher might," suggested Telson.\r\n\r\n"What would be the good to him?  They hadn\'t a boat.  Besides, they all\r\ngo against Riddell, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I mean to say," said Telson, falling back on to the next\r\ngrievance, "your fellows ought to row us again.  We\'d have rowed you\r\nagain like a shot if our line had smashed.  _We_ don\'t funk you."\r\n\r\n"And do you think we funk you?  A pack of--I mean," added Parson,\r\npulling up in time, "do you think we funk you?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you row us again, then?"\r\n\r\n"Because there\'s no honour in the thing while your fellows go in for\r\nbeastly low dodges like that," replied Parson.\r\n\r\n"I tell you," said Telson, finding it very difficult to keep in with his\r\nfriend, "we did not do it.  I say we didn\'t do it; there!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of your saying that when you know no one but a\r\nschoolhouse fellow _could_ have done it?" demanded his friend.\r\n\r\n"I tell you we didn\'t do it," repeated Telson, "and you\'ve got to prove\r\nwe did before you say we did," added he, with triumphant emphasis.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to prove you didn\'t," replied Parson, not to be beaten in\r\nthis line of argument.\r\n\r\n"How can I prove we didn\'t when--when we didn\'t do it?" cried Telson,\r\nmaking up in noise for what he lacked in logic.\r\n\r\n"I knew you couldn\'t prove it!" said Parson, triumphant in his turn.  "I\r\nknew it was one of your blackguard--"\r\n\r\n"All right, old man, I _shall_ fight you," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean, old man, really," said Parson.  "What I mean to say\r\nis--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care what you say," said Telson.  "What I say is, we did _not_\r\ndo it!"\r\n\r\n"All very well," replied Parson, "but I\'m certain you did."\r\n\r\n"How are you certain, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Because, I tell you," said Parson, slowly and incisively, "it couldn\'t\r\nhave been done by any one else."\r\n\r\n"How do you know it couldn\'t?" asked Telson warmly.\r\n\r\n"There you are!  If you didn\'t do it you\'d be able to prove it, but you\r\ncan\'t, you see."\r\n\r\nAnd so this edifying argument went on, or rather round, very much after\r\nthe style of a dog trying to catch his tail, and at its close Parson and\r\nTelson stood as far from solving the mystery as ever.\r\n\r\nThis slight difference of opinion, however, could hardly fail to result\r\nin a little mutual irritation, and for the first time in their\r\nfriendship the two boys felt as if they did not love one another exactly\r\nlike brethren.  It was therefore no small relief when further argument\r\nwas abruptly cut short by the entrance of King, looking particularly\r\ncheerful and important.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, you two!" exclaimed he.  "Guessed I\'d find you here.  Such a\r\nlark!"\r\n\r\n"What is it?" asked the two friends, delighted with any diversion.\r\n\r\n"Why," exclaimed the delighted King, "you know Bosher?"\r\n\r\n"What about him?  What\'s he done?"\r\n\r\n"Guess."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not he that cut the rudder-line, is it?" asked Telson.\r\n\r\n"No, of course not.  But, just fancy, he keeps a diary!"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the other two, laughing, "old Bosher keep a diary!\r\nHow do you know that?"\r\n\r\nKing looked very mysterious, and then said, laughing, "I say, what would\r\nyou give for a squint at it?"\r\n\r\n"Have you got it, then?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said King, producing a small notebook from his pocket.  "I\r\nfound it in the Big just now."\r\n\r\nThe notion of Bosher keeping a diary had been amusing enough, but the\r\nchance of looking at such a production was irresistible.\r\n\r\nThe boys did make one languid protest, more, however, to relieve their\r\nconsciences than to dissuade one another from the meanness of looking\r\ninto another boy\'s diary.\r\n\r\n"Rather low, perhaps," said Telson, "to look at a fellow\'s notes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said King.  "If a fellow keeps a diary he must expect it\r\nto be looked at if he leaves it about.  I know I should."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, so should I too," said Parson.  "Besides, you know, of\r\ncourse we wouldn\'t tell any one else."\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Telson.  "But you know, Parson," he added, seriously,\r\n"it\'s just possible he might have something about the rudder-line in it,\r\nand it would be a great thing to clear that up, wouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"So it would," said Parson, seating himself at the table.\r\n\r\nTelson and King did the same, and Bosher\'s diary was forthwith opened.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance Bosher was the most unlikely boy in all Willoughby to\r\nkeep a diary.  He was not usually credited with overmuch intelligence,\r\nand certainly not with much sentiment, and the few remarks he did\r\noccasionally offer on things in general were never very weighty.  He was\r\na good-tempered, noisy, able-bodied fag, who was at any one\'s service,\r\nand who in all his exploits did about as much work for as little glory\r\nas any boy in the school.\r\n\r\nThe present discovery certainly revealed him in a new and startling\r\nlight, and it was with a feeling somewhat akin to awe that the three\r\nboys who called themselves his friends set themselves to the task of\r\ninspecting his private--his very private diary.\r\n\r\nThe small volume dated from the beginning of the term, and the first\r\nentry the trio examined may be taken as a fair specimen of its general\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n"`May 20.  The twentieth of May.  I awake at 5:37, and got up at 5:43.\r\nMy motive is to see the boats.  It was a beautiful and fine morning.\r\nThe early birds were singing gladly wore my flannels for running along\r\nwith the boat.\'"\r\n\r\nBosher was a little shaky occasionally in his punctuation, which will\r\nexplain any apparent incoherence in the above and following sentences.\r\n\r\n"`I sang as I dressed except while washing The Minstrel Boy.  Started\r\nout at 6:2--met Parson in the Big.  Parson thinks too much of himself.\'"\r\n\r\n"Sharp chap, Bosher," said King.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pull his nose when I see him," said Parson, who, however, did not\r\nappear very deeply affronted so far.\r\n\r\nThe reading continued.\r\n\r\n"`Parson ran on and left me alone.  Now that I am alone let me muse on\r\nmy past life and hope it will be better only the schoolhouse boat was\r\nout.  I think they or our boat will win.  Nice seeing them row Gilks\r\ncatches a crab\'" (this was previous to Gilks\'s ejection from the boat).\r\n"`Entered chapel at 1 to 8.  King was there eating toffee.\'"\r\n\r\n"Hullo, King, _you\'re_ all right.  When this diary\'s published some day,\r\nyou\'ll figure all serene," said Telson, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit," said King, "your turn\'s coming."\r\n\r\n"`At breakfast sit opposite Telson.  He eats vulgar.  Thou shouldest not\r\ntalk with thy mouth full, Telson, I prithee.\'"\r\n\r\nThe readers fairly broke down at this point.  Telson had to admit that\r\nhis turn _had_ come, and relieved himself by announcing that he would\r\n_prithee_ his candid chronicler some day in a way which would astonish\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"`Meditations at breakfast,\' continued the diary.  `The world is very\r\nbig.  I am small in the world.  I will ambition twenty lines for gross\r\nconduct with Harrison--throwing bread I repent entirely.  Parson wanted\r\nme to do his "Caesar" for him.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a whacker!" exclaimed Parson.\r\n\r\n"`I declined, owing to not knowing--\'"\r\n\r\n"I can believe that!" added Parson.\r\n\r\n"`Both detained for gross conduct not knowing verbs my home is far away.\r\nLet out at 12:28.\'"\r\n\r\n"What rot it is!" exclaimed Parson, looking up.  "What a howling young\r\nass he must be to put it all down!"\r\n\r\n"I guess he didn\'t expect we\'d see it," said Telson.  "But, I say, we\r\ncan\'t read it all.  Let\'s see what he says about the boat-race."\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to, and the eventful day was turned to.\r\n\r\n"`Rose at 7:3,\'" began Telson, reading--"oh, we don\'t want that.  Let\'s\r\nsee, `Attended chapel at half a minute to eight.  Half a minute more I\r\nhad been too late.  That had been bad alas had I been bad it had been\r\nbad for me next to Wyndham in chapel.  Wyndham hath lost his knife he\r\nrequested me had I seen it.  I answered nay I had not.  He said--\' Oh,\r\nwhat frightful bosh it is, I say!"\r\n\r\n"So it is; but it would be a spree to see what he says about the race."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll be pages on, at the rate he goes at," said Telson, whipping\r\nover a few leaves.  "Let\'s see.  `Gross conduct with King talking in\r\nclass King meanly tells Parrett he is a beastly sneak.\'"\r\n\r\n"What does he say?" exclaimed King.  "I told Parrett he was a beastly\r\nsneak?  What crams the fellow tells!  Fancy me saying that to Parrett!\r\nAll I said was I wasn\'t talking!"\r\n\r\n"Why, I see it," said Parson.  "He\'s left out a semi-colon or something;\r\nthe `he\'s a beastly sneak\' means _you_, old man.  `King meanly tells\r\nParrett.  He [that is, King] is a beastly sneak.\'  That makes it all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Does it?" cried the indignant King--"does it make it all right!  I\'ll\r\nmake it all right for him, I can promise him.  I never sneaked of him in\r\nmy life!"\r\n\r\n"Wire in, old man, and get to the race," urged Parson impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Here, this looks like it," said Telson, reading.  "`Being the boat-race\r\nno afternoon school I am pleased.  A vast mass on the towpath I being in\r\nflannels waited twenty-three minutes for the start.  Meditating as I\r\nstood, how vast is the world.\'  (Hullo! he had that before; that seems\r\nto be his usual meditation.) `How vast is the world.  I am small in the\r\nworld Parson is a conceited ass.\'"\r\n\r\nParson turned very red in the face, of course, at this unexpected turn,\r\nwhich, however, his two companions greatly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n"`Parson is a conceited ass--\'"\r\n\r\n"I say, you needn\'t go over it twice," expostulated the injured youth.\r\n\r\n"`A conceited ass,\'" continued Telson, his voice wavering with\r\nsuppressed laughter.  "`He thinks he is a great man but he\'s little in\r\nthe world and fond of gross conduct.  He and Telson are the conceitedest\r\nasses in Willoughby.\'"\r\n\r\nThis double shot fairly broke down the gravity both of reader and\r\naudience, and it was some little time before the diary could proceed.\r\nThe account of the race which followed was evidently not original.  It\r\nappeared to be copied verbatim from an account of the last University\r\nBoat-race, with a few interpolations intended to adapt it to the present\r\ncircumstances.  It began thus:\r\n\r\n"`Punctually at half-past eight ["eight" scratched out and "three"\r\nsubstituted] Mr Searle [altered to Mr Parrett] gave the signal to go,\r\nand at the word the _sixteen_ oars dashed simultaneously into the water.\r\nThe Oxonians were the first to show a lead, and at the Creek ["Creek"\r\nscratched out and nothing substituted] were a foot to the good.  The\r\nCraydle is a pleasing river with banks running up from the sea to slopes\r\nup the Concrete Wall this advantage was fully maintained ["maintained"\r\naltered to "lost"]--\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, skip all that," said Parson impatiently; "go on to the part about\r\nWillow Corner."\r\n\r\n"`About a mile from home the Oxford stroke ["stroke" altered to\r\n"Bloomfield"] spurted, and the dark blue flag ["dark blue" altered to\r\n"schoolhouse"] once more shot ahead.  Gross steering by Parson, who I\r\nallude to above, who steers his boat into the bank and breaks rudder-\r\nline.  It is ascertained Fairbairn and others are suspected.  After this\r\na ding-dong race ensued to the finish where eventually the dark [altered\r\nto "light"] blues won by a foot [altered to "mile"] Parrett\'s having\r\ngiven in owing to Parson who is alluded to above.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, this is a drop too much," exclaimed the wrathful Parson,\r\nrising.  "I\'ll pay him out for this, see if I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be an ass, Parson," said Telson.  "Sit down, can\'t you?  You\'ve\r\nno business to look at his diary at all, you know, if it comes to that."\r\n\r\nParson sat down with a wrathful countenance, and Telson proceeded.\r\n\r\n"We shall not see a new race as I hear Riddell and Bloomfield declining.\r\nI spoke to Parson who completely repents.  He suspects Telson who he\r\nascertains is the one to do it.  It is gross.  How many things go wrong.\r\nWyndham hath not found his knife he requested me had I seen it.  I\r\nanswered nay, not so.  I have composed these verses which I will set\r\ndown here as they may recall the past:--\r\n\r\n"`My name is Norval [altered to "Bosher"], on the Grampian [altered to\r\n"Willoughby"] hills.  My father [altered to "Doctor Patrick"] feeds his\r\nflocks [altered to "boys"]\'."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Telson, as he closed the thrilling narrative, and tossed it\r\nback to King, "I never thought Bosher was up to much, but I didn\'t know\r\nhe was a downright lunatic."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said King.  "It\'s not so bad.  I tried to keep a\r\ndiary once, but I could never find anything to say."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess Bosher\'s not hard-up in that line," said Telson,\r\nlaughing.  "But, I say, we ought to give it to him back somehow."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give it to him back pretty hot!" exclaimed Parson.  "I vote we\r\nburn the boshy thing."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can\'t do that.  You\'d better smuggle it back into his study\r\nsomehow, King, without his knowing."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said King, pocketing the book.  "Hallo! who\'s this\r\ncoming?"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a sound of hurrying footsteps in the passage\r\noutside, and immediately afterwards the door opened and revealed none\r\nother than the sentimental author of Bosher\'s diary himself.\r\n\r\nJust at present, and luckily for him, he did not appear to be in a\r\nsentimental mood; his face was a little scared and mysterious-looking as\r\nhe hurriedly stepped into the room and shut the door after him.\r\n\r\n"Look out, I say!" he exclaimed, "the Welchers are coming!"\r\n\r\nThis magic announcement dispelled in a moment whatever resentment may\r\nhave lurked in the minds of any of the three students on account of the\r\ndiary.  In the presence of a common danger like this, with the common\r\nenemy, so to speak, at the very door, they were all friends and brothers\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n"Where?  How do you know?" demanded the three.\r\n\r\n"I was looking for a book I had lost," said Bosher, "in the Big near our\r\ndoor, and I heard Cusack tell Pilbury to wait till he went and saw if\r\nthe coast was clear.  So they\'ll be here directly."\r\n\r\n"Jolly lucky you heard them," said Parson.  "What shall we do, you\r\nfellows?"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight interval for reflection, and then Telson said, "Fancy\r\nthe jug dodge is about the best.  They won\'t be up to it, eh?"\r\n\r\nThis proposal seemed to meet with general approval, and as time was\r\nprecious Parson\'s tin jug, full of water, was forthwith hoisted adroitly\r\nover the door, and delicately adjusted with nail and twine so that the\r\nopening of the door should be the signal for its tilting over and\r\ndisgorging its contents on the head of the luckless intruder.  It was\r\nsuch an old method of warfare that the conspirators really felt half\r\nashamed to fall back upon it, only time was short and the enemy might\r\ncome any moment.  As an additional precaution, also, a piece of the\r\ntwine was stretched across the doorway about three inches from the\r\nground, with the considerate purpose of tripping up the expected\r\nvisitors.  And to complete the preparations, each of the besieged armed\r\nhimself with an appropriate weapon wherewith to greet the intruders, and\r\nthus accoutred sat down and waited the event with serene minds.\r\n\r\nThe event was not long in coming.  Before many minutes a stealthy\r\nfootstep was heard outside, which it was easy to guess belonged to the\r\nspy of the attacking party.  Parson motioned to the others to be silent,\r\nand seated himself at his table, with a book before him, in full view of\r\nthe key-hole.  The little manoeuvre evidently told, for the footsteps\r\nwere heard stealthily hurrying away, and the watchers knew the main body\r\nwould soon be here.\r\n\r\nIt seemed no time before the approaching sounds gladdened their\r\nexpectant ears.  The invaders were evidently walking in step and trying\r\nto imitate the heavy walk of some senior, so as to give no suspicion of\r\ntheir purpose.\r\n\r\nThe besieged smiled knowingly at one another, glanced up at the\r\nsuspended jug, and then softly rising with their weapons at the ready,\r\ncalmly awaited the assault.\r\n\r\nWhoever knew a set of Parrett\'s juniors caught napping?  The Welchers\r\nwould have to be a precious deal more cunning than this if they expected\r\nto score off them.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps advanced and reached the door.  There was a brief pause,\r\nthe handle turned, Parson gave the signal, and next moment--Mr Parrett\r\nentered the study!\r\n\r\nAs he opened the door the jug overhead, true to its mechanism, tilted\r\nforward and launched a deluge of water over the head and shoulders of\r\nthe ill-starred master, just as he tripped forward over the string and\r\nfell prone into the apartment, while at the same instant, accompanied by\r\na loud howl, one sponge, two slippers, and a knotted towel flew into his\r\nface and completed his demolition.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr Parrett\'s reflections may have been during the few seconds\r\nwhich immediately followed no one ever found out.  But, whatever they\r\nwere, it is safe to say they were as nothing compared with the horror\r\nand terror of the youthful malefactors as they looked on and saw what\r\nthey had done.\r\n\r\nWith a cry almost piteous in its agony, they rushed towards him and\r\nlifted him, dripping and bruised as he was, to his feet, gazing at him\r\nwith looks of speechless supplication, and feeling crushed with all the\r\nguilt of actual murderers.\r\n\r\nIt spoke volumes for Mr Parrett\'s self-control that, instead of sitting\r\nand gaping foolishly at the scene of the disaster, or instead of\r\nsuddenly hitting out right and left, as others would have done, he took\r\nout his handkerchief and proceeded quietly to dry his face while he\r\ncollected his scattered thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt length he said, "Are these elaborate preparations usually kept up\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, sir!" cried Parson, in tones of misery.  "Indeed, sir, we never\r\nexpected you.  We expected--"\r\n\r\nHis speech was cut short by a fresh noise outside--this time the real\r\nenemy, who, little guessing what was going on within, halted a moment\r\noutside before commencing proceedings.  Then, with a simultaneous war-\r\nwhoop, they half-opened the door, and, without entering themselves,\r\nprojected into the centre of the room--a bottle!  Pilbury and Cusack had\r\nnot studied natural science for nothing!\r\n\r\nThe strange projectile smashed to atoms as it fell, and at the same\r\ninstant there arose a stench the like of which the nose of Willoughby\r\nhad never known before.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett and the boys choked and made a dash for the door, but the\r\nenemy were hanging on to the handle in full force, and it was at least\r\ntwo minutes before the almost suffocated Parson could gasp, "Open the\r\ndoor! do you hear?  Mr Parrett\'s here; let him out."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t wash, my boy!" cried a mocking voice--"won\'t wash!  Wait a bit,\r\nwe\'ve got another bottle for you when you\'re quite ready!"\r\n\r\n"Let me out, boys!" cried Mr Parrett as well as he could for choking\r\nand holding his nose.\r\n\r\n"Tell you it won\'t wash, my boy!" cried the insulting voice outside.\r\n"Try again!  Have a little more sulphuretted hydrogen.  Jolly stuff,\r\nisn\'t it?  Hold on, you fellows, while I chuck it in!"\r\n\r\nThe idea of another bottle was more than any one could endure.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett groaned and cleared his throat for another summons, but\r\nParson was before him.\r\n\r\n"I say," cried he, in positively piteous tones, "we give in.  I\'ll\r\napologise, anything--do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Eh--go down on your knees, then," cried the enemy.\r\n\r\n"I am," said Parson.\r\n\r\n"Is he? the rest of you? is he on his knees? both of them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is," cried Bosher.  "Honour bright."\r\n\r\n"Well then, say `I\'m a beastly cad, and a funk, and a sneak, and I\r\nknuckle under and will never do it any more.\'"\r\n\r\n"I\'m a beastly cad," gasped Parson, choking with shame, anger, and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, "and a funk, and a sneak, and I knuckle under and\r\nwill never do it any more."\r\n\r\n"Now all the rest of you say it!"\r\n\r\nTelson, Bosher, and King obeyed, one after the other.\r\n\r\n"Is that all of you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Parson, terrified at the prospect of Mr Parrett having to\r\ngo through the ordeal.  "Telson, Bosher, King, and I are the only boys\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"All serene," cried the jubilant voice outside, "open the door, you\r\nfellows!"\r\n\r\nWe draw a veil over the scene which followed!\r\n\r\nMr Parrett hurried out of the room the moment the door was open, merely\r\nturning to say, "Come to me all of you at seven to-night!"\r\n\r\nAnd then with his handkerchief still over his mouth he hurried off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE IN STORE.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes, as the disconcerted and terrified youngsters stood in\r\na small band at Parson\'s study-door and watched Mr Parrett slowly\r\nretreat down the passage, it seemed as if the final crisis in the career\r\nof every one present had arrived.\r\n\r\nIt would have been bad enough to be caught in the midst of a simple free\r\nfight and sent up to the doctor.  But the case was far more terrible\r\nthan that!  For Mr Parrett had been fearfully and wonderfully mixed up\r\nin the whole affair.  A few weeks ago the Parrett\'s juniors had done\r\ntheir best to drown him; now they had done their best to drown him and\r\nbreak his neck and crack his skull all at one onslaught; and as if that\r\nwasn\'t enough, the Welchers had stepped in at the same moment and added\r\npoison and suffocation to the other crimes of which the unlucky master\r\nwas the victim.\r\n\r\nOf course he would think it from the beginning to end one elaborate and\r\nfiendish plot against his life.  It would not matter to him which boys\r\ncommitted one assault and which another.  He had figured as the victim\r\nof all parties, and all parties, there could be no doubt, would now be\r\nincluded under one terrific sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of this common doom, schoolhouse, Parretts, and Welchers\r\nfor the first time that term showed symptoms of a passing brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThey stood rooted to the spot and speechless for at least two minutes\r\nafter the ill-starred master had vanished, then Telson--usually the\r\nfirst to recover his wits--whistled drearily and low, "Whew! we will\r\ncatch it!"\r\n\r\n"Think we\'ll be expelled?" said Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t wonder," said Parson, retreating slowly into his study,\r\nfollowed by the rest.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll send us up to the doctor, certain," said King.\r\n\r\nThere was a long unpleasant pause, at the end of which Cusack said,\r\n"Well, it\'s no use staying here.  Come on, you fellows."\r\n\r\n"May as well stay," suggested Parson.  "We\'d better all turn up\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nSo it was decided not to break up the party, and that evening the\r\nunwonted spectacle of Telson, Parretts, and Welchers, sitting amicably\r\ntogether in one study, might have been noted as one of the greatest\r\nwonders of that wonderful term.\r\n\r\nOf course boys could not sit and talk of nothing.  And of course it was\r\nhardly to be expected they would confine their conversation altogether\r\nto a review of their misdeeds.  The talk gradually became general, and\r\noccasionally even animated.\r\n\r\n"Guess Pil and I will have to shut up chemistry after this," said\r\nCusack.\r\n\r\nPilbury smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n"What do you call the beastly stuff?" asked Telson.\r\n\r\n"Sulphuretted hydrogen," said Cusack, briskly.  "First of all you take\r\na--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up shop!  We don\'t want a chemistry lecture," broke in Parson.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause, then Philpot asked, "I say, is it true then,\r\nthere\'s not going to be a new race?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Parson; "what\'s the use when we can\'t be sure of\r\nfair play?"\r\n\r\n"Jolly right too," said Cusack, delighted to agree with his old enemy\r\nfor once; "those schoolhouse cads are cheats, every one of them?"\r\n\r\n"All right!" exclaimed Telson jumping up; "I\'ll fight you, young Cusack,\r\nfor that!"\r\n\r\nCusack was somewhat taken aback by this unexpected outbreak, but was\r\ninclined, nevertheless, to accept the challenge.  Parson, however,\r\ninterfered peremptorily.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said, "we\'re in quite enough row for one day, without\r\nwanting any more.  So shut up, you fellows, do you hear?"\r\n\r\n"Make him apologise, then," said Telson, wrathfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all serene.  Nobody was hurting you," said Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Do you apologise, or do you not?" demanded Telson.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say I didn\'t, did I?"\r\n\r\nThis was as much as the irascible schoolhouse fag could expect, so he\r\nsat down again.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Pilbury, anxious to make things _quite_ pleasant again,\r\n"a lot of the fellows say the schoolhouse would have won in any case."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to know who says that," demanded Parson, whose turn it now was\r\nto be angry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, everybody in our house.  They looked like winning, you know, from\r\nthe very start, didn\'t they, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a lot you and your friend Pil know about rowing," sneered Parson.\r\n\r\n"Know as much as you do!"\r\n\r\n"Pity if you know such a lot you can\'t put a boat on the river."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what we\'ll do," said Cusack.  "Pil and I will row any two of\r\nyour lot; there now.  Funk it, eh?"\r\n\r\nParson looked hard at the speaker, and then glanced at Telson.  Telson\r\nglanced back at Parson, and then eyed the Welchers grimly.\r\n\r\n"You\'d promise fair play?" asked Parson.\r\n\r\n"Of course we would; we always do."\r\n\r\n"You\'d _give_ us fair play, then?" demanded Parson.\r\n\r\n"Yes, honour bright."\r\n\r\n"All serene.  Telson and I will row you; eh, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" said Telson, "and give them a start too."\r\n\r\n"All very well, you fellows," said King, "but suppose we\'re all expelled\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\nThis unpleasant suggestion took away most of the interest in the\r\nproposed race, and it was decided to defer further arrangements till the\r\nfate of the parties should be decided.\r\n\r\nAfter this the party waited gloomily till seven o\'clock came, and then,\r\nin decidedly low spirits, rose in a body and repaired to Mr Parrett\'s\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nHad they been aware of the actual state of that amiable athlete\'s mind\r\nfrom the moment they last saw him, handkerchief in mouth, hurrying down\r\nthe passage, till now, their trepidation would have been considerably\r\nrelieved.  The first thing Mr Parrett had done on regaining his room\r\nafter that "bad quarter of an hour" with his juniors was to throw\r\nhimself into a chair and laugh heartily.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, his sense of humour was inconveniently acute for the\r\nmaster of a public school, so that what would strike other masters as a\r\nheinous offence, occurred to him more as a ludicrous chapter of\r\naccidents.  And to Mr Parrett\'s mind a more ludicrous chapter of\r\naccidents had rarely occurred in his history.  He saw the whole matter\r\nat once, and the more he thought about it the funnier it all seemed.\r\nAnd yet, funny as it was, it was a painful necessity that discipline\r\nmust be maintained, and that however much he enjoyed the joke he must be\r\nsevere on the jokers.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the group of youthful culprits slowly filed into his\r\nroom, his voice was stern and his countenance betrayed no symptoms of\r\nthe amusement which lurked beneath.\r\n\r\n"Now, you boys," said he, surveying the anxious array carefully, "what\r\nhave you to say for yourselves?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," began Parson, Telson, and Cusack, all at a breath.\r\n\r\n"Stop," said Mr Parrett; "only one at a time.  You, Parson, what have\r\nyou to say?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said Parson, "we\'re all awfully sorry.  It was quite an\r\naccident, really."\r\n\r\n"What was an accident?" demanded Mr Parrett.\r\n\r\n"Why, you getting mauled about like--"\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Parson," said Mr Parrett, pinching himself to keep himself\r\ngrave, "was it an accident that your water-can was hung over the door\r\nand the string stretched across the bottom of it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, sir; not that, but--"\r\n\r\n"Was it an accident that you had missiles in your hands and threw them\r\nin the direction of the door as it was opened?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then, sir, what was the accident?"\r\n\r\n"You were the accident, please, sir," said Parson, sadly.\r\n\r\n"I guessed so.  And for whom were these preparations intended, pray?"\r\n\r\n"For the Welchers, sir," began Parson, longing to launch out into a full\r\nexplanation; "and please, sir--"\r\n\r\nBut again the master pulled him up short, and, turning to Cusack and his\r\nbrother Welchers, said, "And you--_your_ preparations were for--?"\r\n\r\n"For the Parretts, sir," broke in Cusack.\r\n\r\n"Just so," said Mr Parrett, deliberately.  "And now just listen to me.\r\nThis is not the first time I have had to speak to some of you for this\r\nvery conduct."\r\n\r\nParson, Telson, Bosher, and the other Parretts looked very dejected at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n"And it is by no means the first time this term that all of you have\r\nbeen guilty of similar disturbances.  Most of you here look frightened\r\nand uneasy enough now.  I wish I could believe it was because you know\r\nyou have been doing wrong and disgracing the school, instead of merely\r\nbecause I happened to have suffered by your bad conduct.  But such\r\nconduct must be put a stop to.  For the remainder of the term each one\r\nof you will lose one hour\'s play a day except Saturdays."\r\n\r\nA shudder, half of anguish, half of relief, went round the small\r\nassembly at this first clause of Mr Parrett\'s sentence.  The next\r\nclause was still more severe.\r\n\r\n"For the remainder of this term, too, none of you will be allowed to go\r\ninto any house except your own, under any pretence, without _my_ leave,\r\nor the Doctor\'s."\r\n\r\nTelson and Parson looked at one another and groaned inwardly.  They\r\ncould hardly realise what this cruel sentence involved, but they knew it\r\nmeant that life would hardly be worth living for the next six weeks.\r\n\r\n"And," continued Mr Parrett, "I have one more thing to say.  Some of\r\nyou here are in my house, and every one of you, I see, is in my form in\r\nThird School.  You are most of you idle boys, and, as you know, there\r\nare plenty in the same Form better behaved and more industrious than\r\nyourselves."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, sir," said Parson, frankly.\r\n\r\n"What I shall do during the remainder of the term is this," said Mr\r\nParrett.  "If I hear of any other case of disturbance between the boys\r\nof different houses, in which any one of you are implicated, I intend to\r\npunish the entire Form, and stop every boy\'s play for one day.  It rests\r\nwith you, therefore, to decide whether such a thing shall take place or\r\nnot.  But if you give me reason, I shall most certainly do it!"\r\n\r\nMr Parrett spoke severely, and looked as good as his word.  He had\r\ncarefully weighed his words beforehand, and he knew tolerably well the\r\nboys with whom he had to deal.  They were noisy boys, and troublesome\r\nboys, and cheeky boys, and idle boys, but they were honest on the whole,\r\nand the master calculated pretty shrewdly on the effect which this last\r\ndecision would have on their conduct.\r\n\r\nAs long as it was a mere question of getting his own particular self\r\ninto a row, not one of these boys fixed any precise limit to his\r\ndisorderly instincts; but when it came to getting a whole lot of other\r\nboys into the row too, a new and very embarrassing difficulty arose\r\nwhich was fairly insurmountable.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett dismissed the boys sternly, and then, trusting he had done\r\nright, and trusting still more to be able to turn the better qualities\r\nof his noisy young pupils to some good purpose, he went straight to the\r\ndoctor and told him what he had done.\r\n\r\nDr Patrick fully approved of the decision of his colleague, and while\r\non the subject opened his mind to him on the question of the discipline\r\nof Willoughby generally.\r\n\r\n"Have you been able to judge at all of the order of the school lately,\r\nParrett?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Mr Parrett, "I\'m not sure that it is as good as it\r\nshould be.  Of course, it was an experiment making Riddell captain,\r\nparticularly as he is not generally popular."\r\n\r\n"His unpopularity arises from no cause in himself," said the doctor; "if\r\nit did I would not have put him in the post.  But he will live it down--\r\nin fact, he is doing so now, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"I think he is," said Mr Parrett.  "The great difficulty is to get him\r\nto assert himself."\r\n\r\n"I trust," said the doctor, after a pause, "there is no truth in the\r\nreport that Bloomfield and the monitors of your house are trying to set\r\nup a counter authority to Riddell\'s."\r\n\r\n"It is true," said Mr Parrett; "and it is the secret of most of the bad\r\norder in the school.  But I am not sure, sir, whether it is a matter you\r\nwould do well to notice.  It is one of the difficulties which Riddell\r\nhas to live down, and which bring him out more than anything else.  He\r\nhas made his mark already on the usurpers."\r\n\r\n"You are quite right," said the doctor.  "I would rather leave a\r\ndifficulty like that to right itself.  And I dare say the reason Riddell\r\nis so slow in asserting himself, as you say, is that in his own house he\r\nreally has not much to do."\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Mr Parrett.\r\n\r\nThe doctor paused for a moment and then started on an apparently fresh\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid Welch\'s house is no better than it was."\r\n\r\n"How can it be?" said Mr Parrett.  "It has not a single senior of\r\ninfluence or even character in it."\r\n\r\n"And more than that," added the doctor, "it contains a few boys--one or\r\ntwo only, I hope--whose influence is distinctly bad."\r\n\r\nMr Parrett nodded.\r\n\r\n"A change of some sort must be made," said the doctor.  "It has occurred\r\nto me, Parrett, quite recently, that Riddell might do better there."\r\n\r\nMr Parrett opened his eyes wide.\r\n\r\n"You are astonished," said the doctor.  "So was I when I first thought\r\nof it.  But Riddell is a safe man, if slow, and his influence is just\r\nwhat is wanted in Welch\'s.  Besides, Fairbairn would make an excellent\r\nhead for the schoolhouse.  What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Without doubt Riddell, as far as character goes, is the best boy you\r\ncould choose.  I\'m not quite sure, though, whether he has sufficient\r\nforce."\r\n\r\n"But, as you say, his force answers to his difficulties.  At any rate I\r\nam disposed to try him.  A few weeks will show how he gets on.  I have\r\nnot much fear myself."\r\n\r\nAnd so the head master and his lieutenant separated.\r\n\r\nLittle dreaming of the changes in store for them, Silk and Gilks were\r\nsitting together in the study of the latter, furtively consuming cigar-\r\nends and looking decidedly glum as they conversed together in low and\r\nmysterious and not very amicable tones.\r\n\r\n"Think he\'ll do it?" said Silk.\r\n\r\n"He had a letter from home this morning," replied Gilks, "I know,\r\nbecause he sat next to me at breakfast while he was reading it."\r\n\r\n"Did you see what it said," inquired Silk, as naturally as if looking\r\nover another fellow\'s letters were an ordinary proceeding.\r\n\r\n"No, but it was from his brother, and it had a post-office order in it."\r\n\r\n"It had? that\'s lucky.  How much was it for?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t see," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Where is he now?" asked Silk, after a pause.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  Probably in his Holiness\'s study--or, no, it\'s library\r\nnight--he\'ll be there."\r\n\r\n"What a nuisance that library is.  The young beggar\'s always pottering\r\nabout there," said Silk.  "Think he\'ll look us up before bedtime?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better know," said Silk.  "He must come, and you\'d better see he\r\ndoes."\r\n\r\nThis last was spoken in a somewhat menacing voice, and Gilks sulkily\r\nreplied, "What are you in such a hurry to-night for?  The morning will\r\ndo, won\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Silk, "it won\'t, there; and if it did, I choose to see him\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what makes you so precious disagreeable," growled Gilks.\r\n"I don\'t want to be ordered about by you, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nSilk sneered.  "I\'m under great obligations to you, I know," he said.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Gilks, who winced visibly under the satire, "however could\r\nI help it?  It wasn\'t my fault, I tell you.  I\'m awfully sorry you lost\r\non the race, but--"\r\n\r\n"But you\'d better look alive and do what I tell you," said Silk,\r\nviciously.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, to say the least of it, that in so short a time the\r\nWelcher should have so completely got the upper hand of his confederate\r\nthat the latter departed meekly without another word on his errand.\r\n\r\nHe found Wyndham, as he had expected, in the library, busy getting\r\ntogether the books for distribution next day.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said Gilks, with a show of cordiality; "here you are again.\r\nYou seem to live here."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," said Wyndham, looking not very pleased to be interrupted;\r\n"but I always have to get ready an evening before the day, or the\r\nfellows kick up such a jolly row when they\'re kept waiting."\r\n\r\n"How long shall you be?" asked Gilks.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  Why?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Only Silk wants to speak to you."\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s face clouded.  He had come fresh from Riddell\'s study an hour\r\nago.  His brother\'s friend had been as kind as ever.  In a hundred ways\r\nhe had shown it without sermon or lecture, and Wyndham had felt stung\r\nwith a sense of his own ingratitude and dishonesty as he accepted the\r\nhelp and goodness of his mentor.\r\n\r\nNow, consequently, this summons to present himself before Silk was more\r\nthan usually distasteful.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t come, tell him.  It will take me all the evening to finish\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better go, though," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t.  Why had I better go?" asked Wyndham, looking uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"It\'s something important he wants you for.  You\'d better go, young un."\r\n\r\nWyndham flung down the book in his hand with a baffled air, and\r\nmuttering, "I hate the fellow!" walked miserably off.  Gilks called him\r\nback for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I say," he said, "don\'t you be such a fool as to rile Silk, young un.\r\nHe could make it precious awkward for you and me too if it came to a\r\nrow.  Take my advice and keep in with him."\r\n\r\nWyndham answered nothing, but went off moodily to Silk.  "Ah, Wyndham,"\r\nsaid the latter, cordially, as his young _protege_ entered, "I was just\r\nwondering if you\'d give me a look up."\r\n\r\n"Gilks came and said you wanted me; that\'s why I came," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Awfully good of you," said Silk.  "Of course I wanted you.  The fact\r\nis, young un," said he, becoming a little mysterious, "there\'s rather an\r\nawkward thing turned up.  I hope it won\'t come to anything, I\'m sure,\r\nbut it doesn\'t do to be too sure."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" demanded Wyndham, looking alarmed.  "I mean," said\r\nSilk, slowly, "that last time you took Gilks and me down to Beamish\'s--"\r\n\r\n"_I_ took you!" exclaimed Wyndham.  "_You_ took me--you made me go."\r\n\r\nSilk laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, the last time we three went to Beamish\'s, if you like--the\r\nSaturday before the race; last Saturday, in fact--somebody saw us, or\r\nrather saw you."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Wyndham, turning pale.  "Who was it?"\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do you any good to know," said Silk, "but it seems to be a\r\nfact."\r\n\r\n"Who was it? a master or a monitor, or who?" asked the boy, anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Neither.  I don\'t fancy you know the fellow at all; I do, though."\r\n\r\nSilk, as he concocted this lie, would probably have been as astonished\r\nas any one to discover that the escapade in question had really been\r\nwitnessed by two boys from the box of the doctor\'s own fly!\r\n\r\n"You know him?" said Wyndham.  "Will he let out, do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say.  I think I could prevent him," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please do," said the troubled boy, full of exaggerated terror at\r\nthe consequences of detection.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see," said Silk, not very assuringly.\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Wyndham.  "You surely won\'t leave me in the lurch, Silk?"\r\n\r\nSilk looked benevolently at his young friend.\r\n\r\n"It depends," said he, coolly.\r\n\r\n"Depends!  On what?  Oh, Silk, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t alarm yourself," said Silk, smiling.  Then he added,\r\nconfidentially, "The fact is, young un, I\'m hard-up.  I lost a lot of\r\nmoney on the race, owing to that--that is, because Parrett\'s lost.  The\r\nthing is, can you lend me a couple of sovereigns, Wyndham?"\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s face clouded for a moment, but he replied quickly, "Yes, I\r\ncan, Silk, if you\'ll promise to see it doesn\'t get out about last\r\nSaturday."\r\n\r\n"Of course I will.  You don\'t suppose I\'m such a cad as all that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Wyndham, looking more cheerful, and taking out his purse.\r\n\r\nHe drew from it a post-office order.\r\n\r\n"It\'s for three pounds," he said.  "I was going to change it to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll do that," said Silk.  "I\'m going into town early.  You have\r\nsigned it, I see.  There\'ll be a sov. to give you out of it, won\'t\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, please; and the two pounds, and the ten shillings the other day,"\r\nfaltered the boy.\r\n\r\n"You shall have them back, never fear," said Silk, pocketing the order.\r\n\r\nWyndham, in spite of this assurance, did fear considerably, as he\r\nreturned with empty purse to his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAPTAIN TURNED WELCHER.\r\n\r\nRiddell, who probably felt the sting of the boat-race mishap more\r\nsensitively than any boy in Willoughby, was pacing the playground in a\r\ndispirited mood a morning or two after, when Dr Patrick suddenly\r\nconfronted him.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Riddell," said the latter, cheerily, "I\'m glad I have met you.  I\r\nwant to have a talk.  Let me see," said he, pulling out his watch,\r\n"there\'s hardly time now, though.  Will you come and have tea with me\r\nthis evening?"\r\n\r\nRiddell turned pale at the bare suggestion, and would probably have\r\ninvented some wild excuse to get off the dreaded honour had not the\r\ndoctor continued, "I\'m sorry Mrs Patrick and her sister are from home;\r\nthey take a great interest in you, I can assure you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all," cried Riddell, whom the bare mention of those ladies\'\r\nnames was sufficient to confuse hopelessly.\r\n\r\n"Come at seven o\'clock, will you?" said the doctor, pleasantly, not\r\nnoticing his head boy\'s perturbation.\r\n\r\nRiddell continued his walk in a state of considerable perplexity.  For\r\nsome moments he could not get beyond the fact that Mrs Patrick and Miss\r\nStringer were from home, and the relief of that reflection was\r\nunspeakable.  But what could the doctor want him for?  Was it to tell\r\nhim he did not consider him equal to the duties of captain, and to\r\nrelieve him of his office?  Riddell devoutly wished it might be so.  And\r\nyet he hardly fancied from the head master\'s manner this was to be the\r\nsubject of their interview.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was to cross-examine him as to the boat-race.  That wretched\r\nboat-race!  Riddell had hardly had a minute\'s peace since that\r\nafternoon.  The burden of the whole affair seemed to rest upon him.  The\r\ntaunts of the disappointed Parretts, which glanced harmless off minds\r\nlike Fairbairn\'s and Porter\'s, wounded him to the quick, and, until the\r\nmystery should be solved, Riddell felt almost like a guilty party\r\nhimself.  He rather hoped the doctor did want to talk about this.  It\r\nwould be a relief to unburden his mind, at any rate.  But even these\r\ntroubles were slight compared with Riddell\'s concern about his old\r\nfriend\'s brother.  In spite of all his efforts young Wyndham was going\r\nwrong.  He was getting more irregular in his visits to Riddell\'s study,\r\nand when he did come he was more reserved and secret, and less inclined\r\nto confide in his friend than before.  It was easy to guess the reason,\r\nand Riddell felt baffled and dispirited as he thought about it.  To save\r\nyoung Wyndham from his bad friends would be worth to him more even than\r\nto secure the order of Willoughby, or to discover the perpetrator of the\r\nboat-race outrage.\r\n\r\nIn this troubled state of mind Riddell passed the day till the time\r\narrived for him to present himself at the doctor\'s.\r\n\r\nHe entered warily and suspiciously, as though not quite sure whether,\r\nafter all, the two ladies might be lying in ambush somewhere for him.\r\nBut no, there was no deception, only the doctor was there, and he,\r\nunrestrained by the presence of his usual bodyguard, was most friendly\r\nand cordial.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Riddell, glad to see you.  Sit down.  You find me a bachelor, you\r\nsee, for once in a way."\r\n\r\nRiddell was soon at his ease.  The doctor chatted pleasantly over their\r\ntea about various Willoughby topics, giving his opinion on some and\r\nasking the captain\'s opinion on others, and so delicately showing his\r\nsympathy for the boy in his difficulties and his approval of his efforts\r\nfor the good of the school, that Riddell was quite won over, and\r\nprepared for the serious matter which the doctor presently broached.\r\n"Yes," said the latter, in reply to some reference by Riddell to the\r\nWelchers.  "Yes, I am a good deal concerned about Welch\'s house,\r\nRiddell.  I dare say you can understand why."\r\n\r\n"I think so, sir.  They don\'t seem to pull together there somehow, or\r\nhave the sympathy with the good of the school."\r\n\r\n"Precisely.  That\'s just what it is," said the doctor, delighted to find\r\nhis head boy so exactly understanding the nature of the house over which\r\nhe was to be installed.  "They seem to be `each man for himself, and\r\nnone for the State,\' I fear."\r\n\r\n"I think so," said Riddell.  "They hold aloof from most of the school\r\ndoings, unless there\'s a chance of a row.  They had no boat on the river\r\nthis year, and I don\'t think they will have a man in the eleven against\r\nRockshire.  And they seem to have no ambition to work for the school."\r\n\r\nThe doctor mused a bit, and then said, with a half-sigh, as if to\r\nhimself, "And I wish that were the worst of it."  Then turning to\r\nRiddell, he said, "I am glad to hear your opinion of Welch\'s house,\r\nRiddell, and to find that you seem to understand what is wrong there.\r\nWhat should you say to taking charge of that house in future?"\r\n\r\nThis was breaking the news suddenly, with a vengeance, and Riddell\r\nfairly gaped at the head master as he sat back in his chair, and\r\nwondered if he had heard aright.\r\n\r\n"What, sir!" at length he gasped; "_I_ take charge of Welch\'s!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy," said the doctor, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I could never do it, sir!" exclaimed Riddell, pale at the very\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\n"Try," said the head master.  "It may not be so impossible as you\r\nthink."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not popular, sir," faltered Riddell, "and I\'ve no influence.\r\nIndeed, it would only make things worse.  Try some one else, sir.  Try\r\nFairbairn."\r\n\r\n"I shall want Fairbairn to be the head of the schoolhouse," said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it would be a mistake, sir," repeated Riddell.  "If there was\r\nany chance of my succeeding I would try, but--"\r\n\r\n"But," said the doctor, "you have not tried.  Listen, Riddell; I know I\r\nam not inviting you to a bed of roses.  It is a come-down, I know, for\r\nthe captain of the school and the head of the schoolhouse to go down to\r\nWelch\'s, especially such a Welch\'s as ours is at present.  But the post\r\nof danger, you know, is the post of honour.  I leave it to you.  You\r\nneed not go unless you wish.  I shall not think worse of you if you\r\nconscientiously feel you should not go.  Think it over.  Count all the\r\ncost.  You have already made a position for yourself in the schoolhouse.\r\nYou will have to quit that, of course, and start afresh and single-\r\nhanded in the new house, and it is not likely that those who defy the\r\nrules of the school will take at first to a fellow who comes to enforce\r\nthem.  Think it all over, I say, and decide with open eyes."\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s words had a strange inspiriting effect on this shy and\r\ndiffident boy.  The recital of all the difficulties in the way was the\r\nmost powerful argument to a nature like his, and when at length the\r\ndoctor wished him good-night and told him to take till the following day\r\nto decide, Riddell was already growing accustomed to the prospect of his\r\nnew duty.\r\n\r\nFor all that, the day that ensued was anxious and troubled.  Not so much\r\non account of Welch\'s.  On that point his mind was pretty nearly made\r\nup.  It seemed a call of duty, and therefore it was a call of honour,\r\nwhich Riddell dare not disobey.  But to leave the schoolhouse just now,\r\nwhen it lay under the reproach caused by the boat-race accident; and\r\nworse still, to leave it just when young Wyndham seemed to be drifting\r\nfrom his moorings and yielding with less and less effort to the\r\ntemptations of bad companions--these were troubles compared with which\r\nthe perils and difficulties of his new task were but light.\r\n\r\nFor a long time that night Riddell sat in his study and pondered over\r\nthe doctor\'s offer, and looked at it in all its aspects, and counted up\r\nall the cost.\r\n\r\nThen like a wise man he took counsel of a Friend.  Ah! you say, he\r\ntalked it over with Fairbairn, or Porter, or the acute Crossfield--or,\r\nperhaps, he wrote a letter to old Wyndham?  No, reader, Riddell had a\r\nFriend at Willoughby dearer even than old Wyndham, and nearer than\r\nFairbairn, or Porter, or Crossfield, and that night when all the school\r\nwas asleep, little dreaming what its captain did, he went to that Friend\r\nand told Him all his difficulties about Welch\'s, and his anxieties about\r\nyoung Wyndham, and even his unhappiness about the boat-race; and in\r\ndoing so found himself wonderfully cheered and ready to face the new\r\nduty, and even hopeful of success.\r\n\r\nNext morning he went to the doctor and told him he was ready to enter on\r\nhis new duties.  Dr Patrick was not the man to flatter his head boy or\r\nto inspire him with undue hopes; but he was undoubtedly gratified by the\r\ndecision, and Riddell felt encouraged in the consciousness of his\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nAt call-over that evening the Welchers had the pleasure of being\r\ninformed by the doctor of the new arrangements proposed for their\r\nwelfare, and, it need hardly be said, were considerably moved thereby.\r\n\r\nAt first they were disposed to regard the affair as a joke and a capital\r\npiece of fun.  But when that evening Riddell put in an appearance at\r\nsupper, in their house, and when Telson was intercepted bringing over\r\nhis late master\'s goods and chattels to the study next but one to that\r\nof Silk, they began to take the matter in rather more seriously.\r\n\r\nFor the first time for a long while Welch\'s house seemed to be of one\r\nmind--a mind made up of equal mixtures of resentment and amazement and\r\namusement.  Probably, had they been more accustomed to thinking\r\ntogether, they would have summoned a monster meeting, as Parrett\'s would\r\nhave done, to discuss the situation.  As it was, they resolved\r\nthemselves into several small groups, each of which dealt with the topic\r\nof the hour in its own way.\r\n\r\nThe juniors of course had a good deal to say on the subject.  Pilbury,\r\nCusack, Philpot, Morgan, and a few other kindred spirits held a council\r\nof war in the study of the two former immediately after supper.\r\n\r\n"Rum start this, eh, Pil!" said Cusack, by way of opening proceedings.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Pil, confidentially, "I\'m not surprised.  He made such\r\na regular mess of it in the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know what\'s the good of his coming here, then," said Philpot;\r\n"our fellows aren\'t a bit quieter than the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\nNo one was bold enough to dispute this peculiarly modest description of\r\nthe order of Welch\'s house.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he\'s been kicked out of the captaincy as well?" asked\r\nCusack, who was apparently convinced in his own mind that the new move\r\nwas a degradation for Riddell.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Morgan; "Paddy said something about it being a good\r\nthing for us to get the captain of the school as head of our house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah--a jolly good thing," said Pilbury; "jolly lookout for us if\r\nhe\'s stuck here to pull us up whenever we have a lark."\r\n\r\n"Bless you, _he_ can\'t pull a fellow up!" said somebody.  "They said he\r\nused to now and then in the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"Not he.  He\'s afraid to look at a chap."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Cusack, "rather a spree to fetch him, eh, you fellows, and\r\nsee how he does.  Eh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m game," said Pilbury; "what shall we do?  Smash in his study-door?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Cusack, "no use doing that.  Let\'s give him `Bouncer\' to\r\nstart with."\r\n\r\n"That ought to startle him up," said Philpot, laughing, "if he\'s not\r\nused to it."\r\n\r\n"Rather--open the door a bit, Morgan.  Now, you fellows, are you all\r\ngame?  All together."\r\n\r\nAnd with that the party struck up at the top of their voices the famous\r\nold Willoughby chorus, of which the first verse runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  "Oh, Bouncer was a Willoughby chap, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  Upon his head he wore his cap, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  Below his cap he wore his head,\r\n  His eyes were black and his hair was red,\r\n  And he carried his bat for a cool _hundred_,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!"\r\n\r\nThis poetic record of the virtues and accomplishments of their legendary\r\nschool hero gave ample scope, as the reader may surmise, for spirited\r\ndeclamation; and on the present occasion more Welchers than Riddell were\r\nstartled by the sudden and vehement outburst of the patriotic hymn.\r\nIndeed, as it appeared to be a point of honour with the vocalists to\r\npitch no two voices in the same key, the effect was even alarming, and\r\nsuggested the sudden letting loose of a menagerie.\r\n\r\nThe singers waited meekly for a few seconds to see whether their efforts\r\nhad met with the success they deserved.  But as a dead silence reigned,\r\nand no one came, they considerately determined to give their audience\r\nanother chance; and therefore launched forthwith into the second verse,\r\nwhich was delivered with even more dramatic power than the first:\r\n\r\n  "Old Bouncer stood six foot and an inch, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  And four foot round his chest was a pinch, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  Twelve stone two was his fighting weight,\r\n  And he stroked our boat for the champion plate,\r\n  And ran his mile in four thirty-eight,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!"\r\n\r\nThis time the heroic efforts of the melodious juniors had their reward.\r\nBefore the last line was reached the door of the new captain\'s study\r\nopened, and Riddell appeared in the passage.  His first appearance in\r\nhis new capacity was naturally a matter of curiosity on every hand; and\r\nas he approached the scene of the noise he became aware that almost\r\nevery occupant of the passage was standing at his door, watching\r\ncuriously for what was to happen.\r\n\r\nHe certainly did not look, as he walked nervously down the corridor, the\r\nsort of fellow to quell a riot; and any one might have prophesied that\r\nhe was not likely to come off any better now than he did when he once\r\nwent on a similar errand to the stronghold of the Limpets.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the weeks that had elapsed since then had not been thrown away\r\non Riddell.  Would the reader like to hear what his thoughts were as he\r\nneared the scene of his trial?\r\n\r\n"What had I better do?  If I get in a rage I shall only make a fool of\r\nmyself; if I report them to the doctor I shall be shirking my own work;\r\nif I remonstrate mildly and do no more, my chances in Welch\'s are done\r\nfor, and these fellows who are on the lookout for my failure will get\r\ntheir crow.  I _must_ get on the right side of these youngsters if I\r\ncan, so here goes!"\r\n\r\nWith this reflection he reached the door just as the third verse of\r\n"Bouncer" commenced, the performers having carefully turned their backs\r\nso as to appear wholly unconscious of a visitor.  Verse three referred\r\naltogether to the intellectual attainments of the wonderful Bouncer.\r\n\r\n  "Bouncer was the cock of the school, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  And Socrates to him was a fool, sir,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!\r\n  He could cross the `asses\' bridge in the dark,\r\n  And `Hic Haec Hoc\' he thought a lark.\r\n  And swallowed irregular verbs like a shark,\r\n  Bouncer!  Bouncer!  Bouncer!"\r\n\r\nBefore this spirit-stirring recital had reached its climax one or two of\r\nthe performers had found it impossible to resist a look round to see how\r\nthe captain took it.  So that the "surprise" at finding him standing\r\nthere at its conclusion fell rather flat.\r\n\r\nMuch to the disappointment of the spectators outside, moreover, Riddell\r\nshut the door behind him.  The juniors eyed him curiously.  Contrary to\r\ntheir expectation, he neither looked frightened nor confused, but his\r\nface was as cheery as his voice as he said, "You see, I couldn\'t resist\r\nyour beautiful music."\r\n\r\nWas he in jest or earnest?  Did he really mean he had enjoyed the\r\nchorus, or was he poking fun at them?  They could not quite tell.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Cusack, not quite as defiantly, however, as he could have\r\nwished, "that\'s a song we sing among ourselves, isn\'t it, you fellows?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Riddell, before "the fellows" could chime in, "it\'s good fun\r\nbelonging to a musical set--especially for songs like this, that appear\r\nto have several tunes all sung at once!  You should give a concert."\r\n\r\nThe boys looked more perplexed than ever.  It sounded like chaff, and\r\nyet they could scarcely believe it was.  So they smiled vacantly at one\r\nanother, and began to feel the situation a little awkward.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," continued Riddell, feeling his way carefully--"I suppose\r\nbetween nine and ten is the usual time for singing in Welch\'s?  I\r\nfancied it was before supper!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Pilbury, "we do as we like here."\r\n\r\n"Do you, really?" replied the captain.  "How jolly that must be!"\r\n\r\nCusack and Pilbury could hardly tell why they laughed at this very\r\ninnocent observation, but they did, and Riddell was quick enough to see\r\nhis advantage.\r\n\r\n"You know, I\'d be very sorry to interfere with the beautiful music," he\r\nsaid; "but do you think you could get to like not to sing after supper?"\r\n\r\nThe boys stared as if they were not quite sure yet how to take it.\r\nHowever, the captain made himself clear without further delay.  "The\r\nfact is," said he, a trifle nervously, but in his friendliest\r\ntones--"the fact is--I don\'t know what you think, but I\'d be awfully\r\nglad if you fellows would back me up for a week or two in Welch\'s.  Of\r\ncourse, you know, the doctor\'s put me here, and I don\'t suppose you\'re\r\nmuch alarmed by the move, eh?  You needn\'t be."\r\n\r\n"We aren\'t," said Morgan, in a decidedly mild attempt at heroism.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of that," said the captain; whereat the rest of the company\r\nlaughed at the unlucky Morgan, who had quite expected the joke to go the\r\nother way.  "You know," continued Riddell, sitting upon the table and\r\ntalking as familiarly as though he were in his own study, "I\'d rather\r\nlike if among us we could pull Welch\'s up a bit before the end of the\r\nterm.  It seems rather a shame, for instance, we didn\'t have a boat on\r\nthe river these races, and that there\'s not a single Welcher in the\r\nfirst eleven."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beastly shame!" said Philpot.  "Bloomfield\'s down on us, you\r\nknow; he\'s got a spite against us."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I don\'t know," said Riddell.  "I fancy if we\'d got some good\r\nenough men he\'d be only too glad to put them in.  After all, the glory\r\nof the school is the chief thing."\r\n\r\n"Tucker and Silk will never practise," said Cusack.  "I know _I_ would\r\nif I\'d got the chance."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t see why you shouldn\'t start the House Cricket Club this\r\nyear, at any rate," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what Tucker and Silk won\'t do.  We wanted them to do it,\r\ndidn\'t we, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" said Pil; "and they told us to mind our own business."\r\n\r\n"Suppose we start it ourselves?" suggested the captain; "I\'m a Welcher\r\nnow, you know.  I don\'t see why, because Tucker and Silk object, the\r\nwhole house should be done out of its cricket."\r\n\r\n"No more do I," said Philpot.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll kick up a jolly row with us, though," said Morgan.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so," said Riddell.  "At any rate, that\'s no reason why\r\nthere shouldn\'t be a club."\r\n\r\n"All serene!" said Cusack, warming up to the notion, and quite\r\nforgetting "Bouncer."\r\n\r\n"I say, Riddell, couldn\'t we start it now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," said Riddell; "why not?  I propose Cusack be the\r\nsecretary."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say!" cried that youth, blushing, half with pleasure and half\r\nwith embarrassment; "you\'d better be that, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Riddell, laughing, "I don\'t know the fellows so well as\r\nyou.  If you were secretary, and Pilbury or Philpot treasurer, I\'d be\r\npresident, or something of that sort, if you like."\r\n\r\nThe idea of the new club took like wildfire, and an enthusiastic\r\nconsultation followed.  It was resolved to summon a meeting next day of\r\nall who took an interest in the sport, and to arrange for a trial match\r\nat once.  Riddell went as warmly into the details as any one, and took\r\nevery opportunity of working up the patriotic spirit of his younger\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n"You know," said he, "I don\'t see at all why we shouldn\'t be able to get\r\ntogether a team for the junior elevens if we practise hard."\r\n\r\n"The nuisance is," said Cusack, "we\'re stopped an hour a day\'s play all\r\nthis term."\r\n\r\n"What for?" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\nThe melancholy story of Mr Parrett and the sulphuretted hydrogen was\r\nrecounted.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity," said he, gravely.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if Paddy would mind giving us a licking instead," suggested\r\nPilbury, whose hands were of the horny kind.\r\n\r\nEven the others whose palms were less seasoned seemed willing to fall in\r\nwith this alternative, but Riddell discouraged it.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, "he\'s not likely to do that.  But I tell you what I\'ll\r\ndo.  I\'ll see him and Parrett and tell them about the club, and\r\nundertake that you\'ll be steady the rest of the term if they\'ll let you\r\noff.  Do you think I\'d be safe in saying so?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!  I\'ll promise, for one," cried Cusack.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll try," said Pilbury.\r\n\r\n"So will we," said the others.\r\n\r\nSo it was settled.  And when next day Riddell in triumph was able to\r\nannounce that the doctor and Mr Parrett had agreed to withdraw the\r\nprohibition, in consideration of the captain\'s promise on their behalf,\r\ngreat was the jubilation.\r\n\r\nGreater still was Riddell\'s own satisfaction in feeling that he had at\r\nleast made a good start towards getting on the right side of the juniors\r\nof his new house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\n"IS WILLOUGHBY DEGENERATE?"\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the new captain\'s move in attempting to win over\r\nthe juniors of Welch\'s only served to increase the irritation of those\r\nseniors who had hitherto reigned supreme in the house.\r\n\r\nBut Riddell had taken this into his calculation, and was therefore not\r\ngreatly astonished when immediately after the enthusiastic cricket\r\nmeeting just referred to, Silk followed him to his study in a by no\r\nmeans amiable frame of mind.\r\n\r\nSilk was not given to losing his temper, but on the present occasion he\r\nwas decidedly ruffled.  And no wonder.\r\n\r\nAny fellow would be ruffled who suddenly found himself deposed from his\r\nauthority in the manner in which Silk had been.  Had he been one of the\r\nmost conscientious and painstaking of monitors, he might well have been\r\nexcused flaring up a little, and, indeed, would have shown a poor spirit\r\nhad he not done so.\r\n\r\nBut Silk, as the reader knows, was neither painstaking nor\r\nconscientious.  He did not care a rap about Welch\'s, still less about\r\nWilloughby.  As long as he could please himself and annoy his enemies,\r\nhe did not care what became of his house or the boys in it.  It was only\r\nwhen any one ventured to dispute his authority as head of the house that\r\nhe attached any value to his office.  In fact, it was the story of the\r\nDog in the Manger carried out in school life--he would not be troubled\r\ndoing his duty to Welch\'s, and he would not if he could help it let any\r\none else do it for him.\r\n\r\nRiddell, if truth must be told, was not at all sorry to have an early\r\nopportunity of coming to an explanation with Silk.\r\n\r\nSilk was one of the very few boys in Willoughby whom the captain\r\npositively disliked, and that being so Riddell was troubled with none of\r\nthe half-apologetic nervousness which he usually felt in the presence of\r\nhis other fellow-seniors.  He looked upon Silk both as an enemy to\r\nWilloughby and as the evil genius of young Wyndham, and therefore was by\r\nno means disposed to beg his pardon or consult his pleasure in the new\r\norder of things at Welch\'s.\r\n\r\n"I hear the juniors have been saying something to you about starting the\r\ncricket club," said Silk, in tones which were the reverse of\r\nconciliatory.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Riddell; "or, rather, I suggested it to them."\r\n\r\n"You did!  All I can say is, it\'s like your impudence.  Welch\'s is come\r\nto a pretty pass if _you\'re_ sent here to look after our athletics."\r\n\r\nRiddell did not feel called upon to reply to this, and Silk therefore\r\ncontinued, "Don\'t you know Tucker and I have been captains of the clubs\r\nhere for the last two years?"\r\n\r\n"I was told so."\r\n\r\n"Then what business have you to interfere?"\r\n\r\n"There was no house club at all this year."\r\n\r\n"A lot _you_ care about the cricket.  I know well enough it\'s just a\r\ncanting dodge for snubbing Tucker and me before the fellows, nothing\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"You\'re quite mistaken," replied Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course!  You\'d like to make out that you care a fig about\r\ncricket.  You who couldn\'t even bowl a ball from one end of the wickets\r\nto the other!"\r\n\r\nThere seemed nothing particular to reply to in this, so Riddell remained\r\nsilent.  This only irritated Silk the more, who felt that he was by no\r\nmeans getting the best of it.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better stop this sort of thing at once," he said, viciously.\r\n"You\'re sent here to look after the morals of the house, not to\r\ninterfere with what doesn\'t concern you.  Tucker and I can look after\r\nthe cricket without you."\r\n\r\n"Are you and Tucker going to start the old club again, then?" asked\r\nRiddell quietly.\r\n\r\n"Whatever business of yours is it whether we are or aren\'t?  Find out."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m trying to do.  If you are, I\'ll advise the other\r\nfellows to join it and not have two clubs."\r\n\r\n"_You_ advise the fellows!" sneered Silk; "they don\'t want a schoolhouse\r\nprig like you to advise them."\r\n\r\nIt was evidently no use trying to conciliate a fellow like this, and\r\nRiddell began to get tired of the interview.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to offend you or anybody," said he boldly; "but if you and\r\nTucker won\'t take the trouble to start the club, I don\'t see that all\r\nthe house is to be done out of their cricket in consequence.  The\r\nfellows have little enough to keep them together as it is."\r\n\r\n"You are a nice _little thing_ to keep them together with, I must say,"\r\nsnarled Silk, "and you\'ve made a good start by setting the juniors\r\nagainst their seniors."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done nothing of the sort," replied Riddell, quietly; "and if\r\nyou\'ll excuse me, I\'ve some work to do, and there\'s really not much use\r\ntalking on the subject."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he turned, and began taking his books down from the shelf.\r\n\r\nSilk, whose irritation had been gradually getting beyond bounds, was\r\npleased to regard this action as a direct insult to himself, and flared\r\nup accordingly.\r\n\r\n"Look here, you snivelling, stuck-up, hypocritical prig, you!" exclaimed\r\nhe, advancing and seizing the captain roughly by the arm, "we\'d better\r\ncome to an understanding at once.  If you think you\'re going to cheek us\r\njust as you please here, you\'re mistaken, I tell you.  What do you mean\r\nby it?"\r\n\r\n"By what?" inquired Riddell, mildly, but quite composedly.\r\n\r\nSilk\'s only reply was a passionate blow in the captain\'s face, which\r\nsent him staggering to the other side of the room.\r\n\r\nIt was a critical moment.  Riddell was no coward, nor was he one of\r\nthose sickly individuals who, not satisfied to be struck on one cheek\r\nonly, invite a repetition of the assault on the other side.  Physically\r\nweak and nervous as he was, he had sufficient British instinct to move\r\nhim to stand up for himself.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as he stood there a moment irresolute, it flashed across him\r\nthat whatever the cost he must not enter upon a fight with Silk.\r\n\r\nOf course he would be called a coward, and nothing he could say could\r\nprove he wasn\'t.  He was no match for Silk, and consequently his refusal\r\nto defend himself would be called fear.\r\n\r\n"And yet," thought he, "if I fight, my chance in Welch\'s is gone, even\r\nif I were able to beat him.  The fellows will have no more respect for\r\nme than any other rowdy, and will soon enough make my thrashing an\r\nexcuse for mutiny."\r\n\r\nIt was a hard position for any boy, and the courage required to hold him\r\nback cost Riddell more effort than had he blindly rushed into the fray\r\nand given himself up to be thrashed.\r\n\r\n"Will you fight?" shouted Silk, advancing.\r\n\r\n"No," said Riddell, as coolly as he could.\r\n\r\n"Wretched coward!" exclaimed the bully, "of course you won\'t.  Then take\r\nwhat you deserve.  I\'ll give you the biggest hiding you ever had in your\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nHe would probably have carried out his threat, and Riddell would\r\nprobably before half a minute have given up all further idea of non-\r\nresistance, when an opportune diversion occurred in the person of\r\nTelson, who appeared with the remainder of his late senior\'s possessions\r\nfrom the schoolhouse.\r\n\r\n"I say, Riddell," he exclaimed, almost before the door was open, "here\'s\r\na jolly go!  I\'ve got to be that beast Gilks\'s fag, and-- Hullo! what\'s\r\nup?"\r\n\r\nThis remark was caused by Silk\'s suddenly turning on his heel and\r\nhurrying from the study without putting into execution his threat.\r\n\r\n"What was he up to?" asked Telson, as the door was shut.  "He was going\r\nto exterminate me, so he said," replied Riddell, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I wish he\'d tried, and you\'d given him a jolly licking," said Telson.\r\n"He\'s a cad.  I wonder what young Wyndham or any one sees to like in\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Wyndham likes him, then?" asked the captain.  "They always seem jolly\r\nthick," said the fag.  "By the way, Riddell, were you ever at\r\nBeamish\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Beamish\'s?  No!" exclaimed Riddell.  "Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Telson, "I only wanted to know what sort of place it was."\r\n\r\n"Not a good one.  There\'s a pretty strong rule against it in the school.\r\nBad job for any one caught going there."\r\n\r\n"I know, I\'m not going; I only wanted to know what sort of place it was.\r\nBut I\'m off, I\'ve got a motion on in Parliament to-morrow.  I say,\r\nRiddell, I wish you hadn\'t left the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\nAnd off went the junior, leaving Riddell somewhat perplexed by his\r\nchatter, but considerably consoled nevertheless to think that there was\r\nany one in the schoolhouse, or anywhere, who was sorry to lose him.\r\n\r\nHowever, the same reason which took Telson away left Riddell also little\r\ntime to spend in vague reflections.  He, too, had a speech to prepare\r\nfor Parliament to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe meeting promised to be an important one in many respects.  It was\r\nthe first after the boat-race, and consequently party feeling was likely\r\nto make use of the opportunity to let off a little of its steam.  Then,\r\nof course, it was the captain\'s first public appearance as the head of\r\nWelch\'s, and that was sure to excite a good deal of curiosity and\r\ninterest.  And last, but not least, the subject for the evening was a\r\ndebate on the question, "That Willoughby is Degenerate," to be opened in\r\nthe affirmative by Ashley, and in the negative by Porter, and on this\r\nburning question the debate as well as the division promised to be\r\npretty interesting.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual lively time before the regular business was reached\r\nover "Questions," of which there were a good many on the notice-paper.\r\nBut it will be best to report the meeting in the usual Parliamentary\r\nstyle, as it would have appeared on the records of the House, had any\r\nrecord been kept at Willoughby:\r\n\r\nMr Bloomfield took the chair at three o\'clock.\r\n\r\nMr Merrison (Welcher) gave notice that at the next meeting he would\r\nmove--"That this House gives its support to the Liberal candidate in the\r\ncoming election at Shellport, and does all in its power to kick out the\r\nRadical."  (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nMr Pringle (Parrett\'s) asked the Home Secretary what day the summer\r\nholidays were to begin.\r\n\r\nMr Ashley replied that he was not in a position to inform the hon.\r\nmember, but probably in about six weeks.\r\n\r\nMr Wyndham, jun.  (schoolhouse), wished to ask why Parrett\'s would not\r\nrow another race when the schoolhouse had offered it?  (Great\r\nschoolhouse cheers.)\r\n\r\nMr Game (First Lord of the Admiralty), amid equally loud cheers on\r\nParrett\'s side, replied that as soon as the schoolhouse found out who\r\nhad been mean enough to cut the Parrett\'s rudder-line, and gave him up\r\nto justice, they would see about it.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr Wibberly begged to ask the schoolhouse stroke whether he\r\nhad any information to give the House on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr Fairbairn.--The information I have to give the House is that Mr\r\nRiddell and I, directly after the race, went to Mr Bloomfield and said\r\nwe were sorry for the accident--(ironical laughter from Parrett\'s)--and\r\noffered to row them again any day they liked, and the offer was\r\ndeclined.  (Schoolhouse cheers.)\r\n\r\nMr Tipper.--I should like to know if the schoolhouse fellows are making\r\nany efforts to discover the culprit by whose assistance they won the\r\nrace.  (Tremendous Parrett\'s cheers.)\r\n\r\nMr Fairbairn.--I can\'t say we are.  (Derisive cheers of "Of course\r\nnot!" from Parrett\'s.)  The hon. gentlemen opposite seem to know so much\r\nabout it, that I think they had better find the culprit themselves.\r\n("Hear, hear," from the schoolhouse.)\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at this stage became rather noisy, every one being\r\nanxious to express his opinion on the question.  It was not till after\r\nthe President had threatened to "adjourn the House" that silence was at\r\nlength restored.\r\n\r\nBloomfield took the sensible course, also, of announcing that, as quite\r\nenough questions had been asked about the race, he should not allow any\r\nmore on that subject.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr Tucker, the Welcher, rose and put a question on another\r\nmatter.  He wanted to know the reason why Mr Riddell had become a\r\nWelcher; whether it was true that he had been turned out of the\r\nschoolhouse for being incompetent; and whether he had been kicked out of\r\nthe captaincy as well.\r\n\r\nMr Crossfield said he had been requested to reply.  And first he must\r\ncongratulate the hon. member on having succeeded in asking a question\r\nwhich any one could understand.  (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nIn reply, he understood Mr Riddell had been sent to Welch\'s in order to\r\nstudy the virtues of a fellow called Tucker, who was--\r\n\r\nMr Tucker, rising: Mr Chairman, I didn\'t put my question in order to\r\nbe insulted by Crossfield or any one.  (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr Crossfield.--I apologise to the hon. gentleman.  I will not insult\r\nhim by supposing he has any virtues.  I should say Mr Riddell has gone\r\nto take a few lessons in the art of keeping a house in order, which no\r\none can so well teach him as Mr Tucker.  (Loud laughter.)  In reply to\r\nthe gentleman\'s second question--\r\n\r\nMr Tucker.--I don\'t want any more.  (Laughter.)\r\n\r\nMr Crossfield.--In reply to the gentleman\'s second question, I am sorry\r\nto inform him that his impressions are about as correct and intelligent\r\nas they usually are.  (Renewed cheers and laughter, in the midst of\r\nwhich Tucker subsided in a state of mind hardly amiable.)\r\n\r\nAs soon as silence was restored, Mr Porter wished to ask the captain of\r\nthe eleven whether the team to play against Rockshire was yet settled.\r\n\r\nMr Bloomfield.--Not quite.  Nine names are fixed--Game, Tipper, Ashley,\r\nWibberly, and myself from Parrett\'s house, and Fairbairn, Porter,\r\nCoates, and Crossfield from the schoolhouse.  (Cheers and counter-\r\ncheers, and loud cries of "What about the Welchers?") What about the\r\nWelchers?  That\'s what everybody wants to know!  (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nHereupon Mr Cusack rose in his place and asked if the House was aware\r\nthat the Welchers\' cricket club was started again; that he was the\r\nsecretary; and old Mr Pil the treasurer, and Mr Riddell the president,\r\nthat the subscription was two shillings and sixpence in advance, and\r\nthat-- But here the enthusiastic secretary\'s announcement was drowned in\r\nthe general laughter of the assembly, led by the Parrett\'s juniors, who\r\nroared as if they\'d never heard such a joke in their lives.  "Won\'t be a\r\njoke when we smash you in one innings," shouted Cusack, standing on his\r\nseat to give emphasis to the challenge.  "Ho, ho! when\'s that to be?"\r\n\r\n"When you like," cried the Welchers.  "Do you funk it?"\r\n\r\n"Unless those juniors there hold their row," interposed Bloomfield, "I\r\nshall have them turned out of the meeting."  Whereat the little breeze\r\ncalmed down.\r\n\r\nThe President then called upon Mr Ashley to move the resolution\r\nstanding in his name, which he did in a rather feeble speech.\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t think it necessary to say much to prove that the school\r\nis degenerate.  Look at the clubs!  They aren\'t nearly as good as they\r\nwere in old Wyndham\'s time.  Parrett\'s clubs, thanks to Mr Bloomfield,\r\nkeep up; but where are the others?  Then the rows.  (Hear, hear.)  I\'m\r\nsure there have been more rows in the school this term than all the rest\r\nof the year put together.  The juniors seem to do what they\r\nlike,"--("Hear, hear," from Telson, Parson, and Co.)--"and no one seems\r\nto know who has a right to keep any one else in order.  Now, why is all\r\nthis?  (Loud cheers from Bosher.)  You know as well as I do.  The\r\ncaptain of the school always used to be a fellow the boys could look up\r\nto.  Old Wyndham and the captain before him were something like fellows.\r\n(Loud Parrett\'s cheers.) _They_ weren\'t afraid to look any one in the\r\nface--(cheers)--and _they_ didn\'t, when they got tired of one\r\nhouse--(cheers)--ask the doctor to move them to another.  (Terrific\r\napplause from the Parrett\'s and Welchers.)  Why, if this boat-race\r\naffair had happened in old Wyndham\'s time, do you suppose he wouldn\'t\r\nhave made it right, and found out the fellow, even if it was his own\r\nbrother?  (Loud cheers, amidst which young Wyndham blushed a great deal\r\nat this unexpected piece of notoriety.)  I\'m not going to say any more."\r\n("Hear, hear," from Fairbairn.)\r\n\r\nMr Porter rose to open the debate on the other side.  He wasn\'t going\r\nto give in that Willoughby was going down.  It was unpatriotic.\r\n(Cheers.)  He meant to say if the school did go down it was the fellows\'\r\nown fault, and not all to be blamed on one boy.  Mr Riddell would\r\nprobably answer for himself--(laughter)--but he (Mr Porter) was pretty\r\nsure the school would not degenerate under him.  The fellows seemed to\r\nthink the only thing in the world was brute strength.  He had no\r\nobjection to brute strength--(cheers and laughter)--in fact he fancied\r\nhe had a little of his own--("Hear, hear," from Telson whose ears Porter\r\nhad boxed only that morning)--but Willoughby wanted something better\r\nthan that; and he meant to say there were plenty of fellows in the\r\nschool who didn\'t make much noise, but who did as much to keep up the\r\nschool as all the rowdies put together.  And when things have quieted\r\ndown, as he hoped they would, these fellows would get more thanks than\r\nthey did now.  (Cheers from a few, who apparently considered this last\r\nallusion referred specially to them.)\r\n\r\nPorter was not a good speaker, and the little he did say was a good deal\r\nbungled.  Still there was a manly ring about his speech which pleased\r\nthe better disposed section of his audience, some of whom did not even\r\nbelong to the same house.\r\n\r\nSilk followed.  The Welcher monitor was clever to a certain degree, and\r\nalthough he never chose to devote his cleverness to good purposes, he\r\nusually managed to get himself listened to when he chose to take the\r\ntrouble.  And at present, his peculiar position as the deposed head of\r\nWelch\'s gave a certain interest to what he had to say.  Bitter enough it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"What chance is there of the school not going down, I should like to\r\nknow," said he, "when cant is the order of the day?  (Hear, hear.)  Of\r\ncourse the school is going down.  What interests can any one have in his\r\nhouse when some one comes and begins by setting the juniors against the\r\nseniors and then turning up the whites of his eyes and saying, `What a\r\nshocking state of disorder the house is in?\'  Why, before `the little\r\nstranger\'--(loud laughter)--came to Welch\'s, the seniors and juniors\r\nnever fell out," ("Hear, hear," from several quarters), "but now there\'s\r\na regular mutiny.  And what\'s bad for one house is bad for the school.\r\nI don\'t care who\'s head of Welch\'s.  He\'s welcome to the honour if he\r\nlikes, but let him act above-board, that\'s what I say, and not snivel\r\nand look pious while all the time he\'s doing a dirty trick."  (Cheers\r\nfrom Tucker and one or two more, which, however, instantly died out when\r\nCrossfield rose.)\r\n\r\nCrossfield was the plague of the senior Welchers\' lives!\r\n\r\n"I was much affected by the beautiful speech of the gentleman who has\r\njust sat down," he began.  "It is always so sweet to hear conscious\r\ninnocence asserting itself.  After the gentleman\'s noble efforts for the\r\ngood of his house (laughter)--and the splendid example he has set of\r\nrectitude--(laughter)--and high moral principle--(laughter)--it is truly\r\ntouching to find him put on one side for an interloper who is villainous\r\nenough to tell the juniors they need not walk in his saintly footsteps!\r\n(Laughter.)  But that is not what I wanted to say, and as the gentleman\r\nappears to be overcome by his emotions--(Silk was at that moment angrily\r\nleaving the room)--I don\'t think we need trouble any more about him.\r\n(Cheers and laughter.)  All I wished to say was this: I always\r\nunderstood from the gentlemen of Parrett\'s that Mr Bloomfield was\r\ncaptain of Willoughby," (Loud cries of "So he is!"), "and that nobody\r\ncared a straw for Mr Riddell."  ("No more they do!").  "Then, I don\'t\r\nthink Mr Ashley is very complimentary to Mr Bloomfield when he says\r\nthe fault of all the mischief is that the captain is not an all-round\r\nman.  For all that he\'s quite correct.  Mr Bloomfield is a well-meaning\r\nman, no doubt, but he certainly is not an all-round man."  (Uproar.)\r\n\r\nRiddell then rose, and his rising was the signal for a great\r\ndemonstration of party feeling.  Parrett\'s of course went against him,\r\nand a large section of Welch\'s, but the schoolhouse, aided by Cusack,\r\nPilbury, and Co., backed him up.  He spoke nervously but boldly.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to have to support the motion of Mr Ashley.  I agree with\r\nhim that Willoughby is not what it was, and not what it should be.\r\n(Cheers.)  And I also agree with him in thinking that the school might\r\nhave a good deal better captain than it has."  (Cries of "No!" from the\r\nschoolhouse.) "However, I do not want to say a word about myself.  What\r\nI do want to say is this--it\'s one thing to discover that we are\r\ndegenerate, and another to try to put ourselves right again.  And are we\r\nlikely to do that as long as we are all at sixes and sevens, pulling\r\ndifferent ways, caring far more about our own gratifications than the\r\ngood of the whole school?  I don\'t think so, and I don\'t believe Mr\r\nBloomfield does either.  Every fellow worth the name of a Willoughbite\r\nmust be sorry to see things as they are.  (Hear, hear.)  Why should they\r\nremain so?  Surely the good of the school is more important than\r\nsquabbling about who is captain and which is the best house.  Of course,\r\nwe all back up our own house, and, as a Welcher now, I mean to try if\r\nour house can\'t give a good account of itself before the term\'s over.\r\n(Loud cheers from Pilbury, Cusack, Philpot, etcetera.)  And if each\r\nhouse pulls itself up, not at the expense of a rival house--(Hear,\r\nhear)--but for the glory of the school--(Hear, hear)--we shan\'t have to\r\ncomplain of Willoughby being degenerate much longer.  You remember what\r\nold Wyndham said the night before he left.  As long as the fellows think\r\nfirst of the school and then of themselves Willoughby will be all right.\r\nDepend upon it he was right.  We cheered him loud enough then, why not\r\ntake his advice still?"  (Loud cheers.)\r\n\r\nThis spirited address roused the applause of all the better-minded\r\nsection, whose cheers were not wholly unmingled with self-reproach.\r\nBloomfield himself, it was plain, felt its force, and as to the more\r\nvehement members of Parrett\'s, it considerably damped their ardour.\r\n\r\n"Old man," said Fairbairn that evening to his friend the captain, "you\r\nstruck a really good blow for the school this afternoon.  I don\'t know\r\nhow you managed to pitch on just the right thing to say, as you did.\r\nThings will come all right, take my word for it.  They\'re beginning\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nAlas, there is many a slip \'twixt the cup and the lip, as Willoughby had\r\nyet to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nIS WILLOUGHBY MAD?\r\n\r\nThings did not mend all at once at Willoughby.  No one expected they\r\nwould.  And within a few days after the "debate in Parliament" it seemed\r\nas if the school had finally abandoned all ideas of order and\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that more than once mention had been made of an\r\napproaching election for the free and enlightened borough of Shellport,\r\nwhich was occupying the attention not only of the town, and of the\r\ndoctor and his ladies, but also of the boys themselves.  And the cheers\r\nwith which Morrison\'s notice of motion, mentioned in the last chapter,\r\nwas received, showed plainly enough how things were going.\r\n\r\nBy long tradition Willoughby had been a Whig school.  Fellows did not\r\nexactly know what Whig meant, but they knew it was the opposite of Tory\r\non one side and Radical on the other, and they went accordingly.  On the\r\npresent occasion, moreover, they had a sort of personal interest in the\r\nevent, for the Whig candidate, Sir George Pony, had been discovered to\r\nbe a sort of second uncle a few times removed of Pringle, one of the\r\nParrett\'s fags, whereas the Radical, Mr Cheeseman, was a nobody!\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons Willoughby felt it had a great stake in the\r\ncontest, and tacitly determined to make its voice heard.\r\n\r\nSmall election meetings were held by the more enthusiastic politicians\r\nof the school, for the purpose of giving vent to their anti-radical\r\nsympathies.  At these one boy was usually compelled to represent the\r\nWhig and another to figure as the unpopular Radical.  And the cheering\r\nof the one and the hooting of the other was an immense consolation to\r\nthe young patriots; and when, as usually happened, the meeting proceeded\r\nto poll for the candidates, and it was announced that the Whig had got\r\n15,999 votes (there were just 16,000 inhabitants in Shellport), and the\r\nRadical only one (polled by himself), the applause would become simply\r\ndeafening.\r\n\r\nEven the seniors, in a more dignified way, took up the Whig cause, and\r\nwore the Whig colours; and woe betide the rash boy who sported the\r\nopposition badge!\r\n\r\nThe juniors were hardly the boys to let an occasion like this slip, and\r\nmany and glorious were the demonstrations in which they engaged.  They\r\nbroke out into a blaze of yellow, and insisted on wearing their colours\r\neven in bed.  Pringle was a regular hero, and cheered whenever he showed\r\nhis face; whereas Brown, the town boy, whose father was suspected of\r\nbeing a Radical, was daily and almost hourly mobbed till his life became\r\na burden to him.  All other distinctions and quarrels were forgotten in\r\nthis enthusiastic and glorious outburst of patriotic feeling.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the election a mass meeting of juniors and Limpets of\r\nall houses and ages, summoned by proclamation, was held in a corner of\r\nthe playground, "to hear addresses by the candidates, and elect a member\r\nfor Shellport."  Pringle, of course, was to figure as his distant uncle,\r\nand upon the unhappy Bosher had fallen the lot of assuming the unpopular\r\n_role_ of Mr Cheeseman.  The meeting, though only professing to be a\r\njuniors\' assembly, attracted a good many seniors also, whose curiosity\r\nand sense of humour were by no means disappointed at the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe chairman, Parson, standing on the top of two cricket-boxes, with a\r\nyellow band round his hat, a yellow rosette on each side of his jacket,\r\nand a yellow tie round his neck, said they were met to choose a member,\r\nand knew who was their man.  (Loud cheers for "Pringle.") "They didn\'t\r\nwant any Radical cads--(cheers)--and didn\'t know what they wanted down\r\nhere."  (Cheers.) (Bosher: "_I_ don\'t want to be a Radical, you\r\nknow.")--(Loud cries of "Shut up!"  "Turn him out!") He\'d like to know\r\nwhat that young ass Curtis was grinning at?  He\'d have him turned out if\r\nhe had any of his cheek.  He always suspected Curtis was a Radical.\r\n(Curtis: "No, I\'m not--I\'m for Pony.") There, he knew he was, because\r\nRadicals always told crams!  Whereat Parson resumed the level ground.\r\nPringle, who had about as much idea of public speaking as he had of\r\nChinese, was then hoisted up on to the platform amid terrific applause.\r\n\r\nHe smiled vacantly, and nodded his head, and waved his hand, and\r\noccasionally, when he caught sight of some particularly familiar friend,\r\nbrought it up vertically near his nose.\r\n\r\n"Silence!  Shut up!  Hold your row for Pony!" yelled the chairman.\r\n\r\n"Go ahead, Pringle!" cried the candidate\'s supporters.\r\n\r\n"Speak out!" shouted the crowd.\r\n\r\n"All right," said the unhappy orator, "what have I got to say, though?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, anything--fire ahead.  Any bosh will do."\r\n\r\nPringle ruminated a bit, then, impelled to it by the cheers of his\r\naudience, he shouted, for lack of anything better to say, all he could\r\nremember of his English history lesson of that morning.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen--(cheers)--the first thing Edward III did on ascending the\r\ncrown--(terrific applause, in which the seniors present joined)--was to\r\nbehead the two favourite ministers--(prolonged cheers)--of his mother."\r\n(Applause, amidst which Pringle suddenly disappeared from view, and\r\nMorrison, the Limpet, mounted the cricket-box.  Morrison was a\r\npolitician after Willoughby\'s own heart.)\r\n\r\n"I beg to move that Sir George Pony is a fit and proper member for\r\nWilloughby," he screamed.  "I think the Radicals ought all to be hung.\r\n(Cheers.)  They\'re worse than the Tories.  (Counter-cheers.)  One\'s\r\nabout as bad as the other.  (United cheers.)  We\'re all Whigs here.\r\n(Applause.)  I say down with everybody that isn\'t.  (Cheers.)  If the\r\nRadical gets in I don\'t mind if the Constitution gets smashed."  ("Nor\r\ndo we!") "It will serve them right for allowing the Radicals in."\r\n(Mighty applause.)\r\n\r\nI am not going to continue the report of this animated and intellectual\r\nmeeting.  It lasted till call-over, was renewed again directly after\r\ntea, and continued long after the speakers and audience were in bed.\r\nBosher got dreadfully mobbed, besides being hit on the ear with a stone\r\nand hunted several times round the playground by the anti-Radicals.\r\n\r\nAltogether Willoughby had gone a little "off its head," so to speak, on\r\nthe subject of the election.  Riddell found himself powerless to control\r\nthe excitement, and the other monitors were most of them too much\r\ninterested in the event themselves to be of much service.  The practice\r\nfor the Rockshire match, as well as the play of the newly-started\r\nWelchers\' club, was for the time completely suspended; and it was\r\nevident that until the election was over there was no prospect of seeing\r\nthe school in its right mind again.\r\n\r\nThe day before the event was a busy and anxious one for the captain.\r\nAll day long fellows came applying to him on the wildest of pretexts for\r\n"permits" the following afternoon to go into town.  Pilbury, Cusack, and\r\nPhilpot wanted to get their hair cut.  King and Wakefield had to get\r\nmeasured for boots, and to-morrow afternoon was the only time they could\r\nfix for the ceremony.  Parson and Telson suddenly recollected that they\r\nhad never called to pay their respects at Brown\'s after the pleasant\r\nevening they had spent there a few weeks ago.  Strutter, Tedbury, and a\r\nfew other Limpets were anxious to study geology that afternoon at the\r\nTown Museum, Pringle wanted to see how his "uncle" was getting on,\r\netcetera, etcetera.\r\n\r\nAll which ingenious pretexts the captain very naturally saw through and\r\nfirmly declined, much to the mortification of the applicants--who many\r\nof them returned to the charge with fresh and still more ingenious\r\narguments for making an exception in their particular case.  But all to\r\nno effect.  About midday the captain\'s study was empty, and the\r\nfollowing notice pasted on the door told its own story.\r\n\r\nNotice.\r\n\r\n_By the Doctor\'s order, no permits will be allowed to-morrow.  Call-over\r\nwill be at four instead of five_.\r\n\r\nA.  Riddell, Capt.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the authorities were determined that Willoughby should\r\ntake no part in the election, and to make things quite sure had fixed\r\ncall-over for the very hour when the poll would be closing.  Of course\r\npoor Riddell came in for all the blame of this unpopular announcement,\r\nand had a bad time of it in consequence.  It was at first reported that\r\nthe captain was a Radical, and that that was the reason of the\r\nprohibition, but this story was contradicted by his appearance that same\r\nevening with a yellow ribbon in his buttonhole.  It was next insinuated\r\nthat as he had not been allowed to go down himself he was determined no\r\none else should, and Willoughby, having once taken up the idea,\r\nconvinced itself this was the truth.  However, when a good many of the\r\ndisappointed applicants went to Bloomfield, and were met by him with a\r\nsimilar refusal, it began to dawn upon them that after all the doctor\r\nmight be at the bottom of this plot to thwart them of their patriotic\r\ndesires, and this discovery, though it by no means allayed their\r\ndiscontent, appeared to keep their resentment within some sort of\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nThe juniors, disappointed in the hope of publicly displaying their anti-\r\nradical sentiments before all Shellport, looked about for consolation\r\nindoors that evening, and found it in a demonstration against the\r\nunlucky Bosher, who, against his will, had been forced to personate the\r\nRadical at the recent meeting, and now found it impossible to retrieve\r\nhis reputation.  He was hissed all round the playground, and finally had\r\nto barricade himself in his study to escape further persecution.  But\r\neven there he was not safe.  The youthful Whigs forced their way into\r\nhis stronghold, and after much vituperation and reproach, proceeded to\r\nstill more violent measures.  "Howling young Radical cad!" exclaimed\r\nTelson, who, carried away by the excitement of the hour, had forgotten\r\nall Mr Parrett\'s prohibitions, and had come to visit his old allies;\r\n"you ought to be ashamed of yourself."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I\'m Yellow," pleaded the unhappy Bosher.  "They forced me to be\r\nCheeseman at the meeting, but it wasn\'t my fault."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell crams," cried the others.  "It\'s bad enough to be a Radical\r\nwithout trying to deceive us."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not trying to deceive you, really I\'m not," protested Bosher.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be anything you like.  I hate the Radicals.  Oh, I say, don\'t be\r\ncads, you fellows.  Let me be a Whig, do!"\r\n\r\n"No," cried the virtuous Parson.  "We\'ll have no Radical cads on our\r\nside."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not a Radical cad," cried Bosher; "at least not a Radical."\r\n\r\nAt that moment King made a sudden grab at a small black book which lay\r\non the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you fellows," cried he, "here\'s a lark.  Here\'s his diary."\r\n\r\nA mighty Whig cheer followed the discovery, amidst which Bosher\'s wild\r\nprotests and entreaties were quite drowned.\r\n\r\n"His diary!" exclaimed Parson.  "That\'ll show if he\'s a Radical or not.\r\nHand it over, King.  That\'ll show up his jolly gross conduct, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried Bosher.  "Give it up, you fellows; it\'s mine.  Don\'t be\r\ncads, I say; it\'s private."  And he made a wild dash for his treasure.\r\n\r\nBut it was no use.  Parson gravely addressed his prisoner.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young Bosher, it\'s no use making a row.  We must look at the\r\ndiary to see if you\'re really a Radical or not.  It\'s our painful duty,\r\nso you\'d better be quiet.  We\'re sorry to have to do it, you know, but\r\nit can\'t be helped.  If we find nothing Radical in the diary we\'ll let\r\nyou off."\r\n\r\nIt was no use protesting, and poor Bosher had to submit with the best\r\ngrace he could to hear his inmost thoughts read out in public.\r\n\r\n"Here, Telson, old man," said Parson, "you read it.  Speak out, mind.\r\nBetter go backwards; start at yesterday."\r\n\r\nTelson took the precious volume solemnly and began, frequently\r\ninterrupted by the protests of the author, and more frequently by the\r\nlaughter of his audience.\r\n\r\n"`Thursday, the 4th day of the week.\'" ("I always thought it was the\r\nfifth," observed Cusack).--"Rose at 6:13.  Time forbad to shave down in\r\nthe Big.  N.B.--The world is big, I am small in the world, I sawest\r\nRiddell who is now in Welch\'s playing cricket with the little boys.\r\nPilbury sported too, ugly in the face.  (Here all but Pilbury seemed\r\ngreatly amused.)  Also Cusack, who thinks a great deal,"--("Hear, hear,"\r\nfrom Cusack)--"about himself.  (Laughter.)  I attend an election at 10:2\r\nin the Big.  Parson taketh the chair.  Parson is a f--l and two\r\nbetween."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" broke in the outraged Parson.  "I knew he was a Radical cad.  All\r\nright, Bosher, my boy; you\'ll catch it!  Steam away, Telson!"\r\n\r\n"`It was a gross meeting, Pringle being much stuck-up.  He maketh a\r\nspeech.  Meditations while Pringle is making a speech.  The grass is\r\nvery green.  (Great laughter at Pringle\'s expense.)  I will aspire up\r\nTelson thinketh he is much, but thou ist not oh, Telson, much at all I\r\nspoke boldly and to the point.  I am the Radical.\'"\r\n\r\n"There you are!" exclaimed Parson, triumphantly: "didn\'t I tell you so?\r\nBosher!  What do you mean by telling such howling crams, Bosher?"\r\n\r\n"I only meant--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!  Fire away, Telson!"\r\n\r\n"`I am the Radical.  I desire to smash everything the little Welchers\r\nmake noises.  Meditations: let me be noble dinner at 3:1 stew.  The\r\nturnips are gross.  I request leave of Riddell to go to the town to-\r\nmorrow but he sayeth no.  I am roused\'--that\'s all of yesterday."\r\n\r\n"About enough too!" exclaimed the wrathful Parson.  "Just read the day\r\nbefore, before we start hiding him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, please don\'t lick me!" cried the unhappy author: "I\'ll apologise,\r\nyou know, Parson, Telson; please don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"`Wednesday--rose at 8:13.  Sang as I shaved the Vicar of Bray.  I shall\r\nnow describe my fellows which are all ugly and gross.  Parson is the\r\nworst.\'"\r\n\r\n"Eh?" exclaimed the wrathful owner of that name.\r\n\r\n"`Parson is the worst,\'" read Telson, with evident glee, "`and--and--\'\r\noh, let\'s see," he added, hurriedly turning over the page.\r\n\r\n"No, no; read fair; do you hear?" cried Parson.  "No skipping."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll crack your skull, Bosher," said Telson, indignantly, handing the\r\ndiary across to Parson and pointing to the passage.\r\n\r\n"`--And Telson is the most conceited ignorant schoolhouse frog I ever\r\nsaw at breakfast got thirty lines for gross conduct with the abominable\r\nKing.\'"\r\n\r\n"There!" exclaimed Telson, in a red heat; "what does he mean by it?  Of\r\ncourse, I don\'t care for myself; it\'s about the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that he says about me?" said King.\r\n\r\n"`The abominable King,\'" cried Telson, reading with great relish;\r\n"`thirty lines for gross conduct with the abominable King.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, this is too much, you fellows," cried King.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit too much.  Just finish that day, Telson," said Parson,\r\nhanding back the diary.\r\n\r\n"Please give it up," pleaded Bosher, but he was immediately sat upon by\r\nhis outraged companions, and forced to listen to the rest of the\r\nchronicle.\r\n\r\n"`Wyndham hath not found his knife.  I grieve for Wyndham thinking\r\nCusack and the little Welchers to be the thiefs.  I smile when Cusack\r\ngoes to prison in the Parliament a gross speech is made by Riddell I\r\nreply in noble speech for the Radicals.\'"\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do, that\'s enough; he _is_ a Radical then; he says so himself!"\r\ncried Telson, shutting up the book, and flinging it across the room at\r\nBosher, who was standing near the door and just dodged it in time.  A\r\nregular scramble ensued to secure the "gross" volume, in the midst of\r\nwhich the unhappy author, seeing his chance, slipped from the room, and\r\nbolted for his life down the passage.\r\n\r\nHis persecutors did not trouble to pursue him, and a sudden rumour\r\nshortly afterwards that Mr Parrett was prowling about sent Telson and\r\nthe few Welchers slinking back to their quarters.  And so ended the eve\r\nof the great election.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Riddell and those interested in the discipline of the\r\nschool were surprised to see that the excitement was apparently abated,\r\ninstead of, as might have been expected, increased.  The attendance at\r\nmorning chapel and call-over was most punctual, and between breakfast\r\nand first school only two boys came to him to ask for permits to go into\r\ntown.  One of these was young Wyndham, whom Riddell had seen very little\r\nof since leaving the schoolhouse.\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s desire to go down into town had, as it happened, no connection\r\nat all with the election.  He was as much interested in that, of course,\r\nas the rest of Willoughby, but the reason he wanted to go to Shellport\r\nthis afternoon was to see an old home chum of his, from whom he had just\r\nheard that he would be passing in the train through Shellport that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nGreat, therefore, was his disappointment when Riddell told him that no\r\npermits were allowed that afternoon.\r\n\r\n"What?" exclaimed the boy.  "I\'ve not seen Evans for a year, and he\'ll\r\nthink it so awfully low, after writing to me, if I don\'t show up at the\r\nstation."\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry, Wyndham," said Riddell, who had heard so many wild\r\npretexts for getting leave during the last two days that he even doubted\r\nhow far Wyndham\'s might be true or not; "the doctor says no one is to go\r\ndown, and I can\'t give any permits."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you all I want is to see Evans--there\'s no harm in that."\r\n\r\n"Of course not, and you should get the permit at once if any were\r\nallowed."\r\n\r\n"You could give me one if you chose."\r\n\r\n"But if I gave to one I should have to give to all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that you need tell everybody," said Wyndham, nettled.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry it can\'t be done, Wyndham; I can\'t make any exceptions," said\r\nthe captain, firmly.\r\n\r\n"You could well enough if you chose," said Wyndham, sorely disappointed\r\nand aggrieved.  "The fact is, I don\'t know why, I believe you\'ve got a\r\nspite against me of late."\r\n\r\n"You know I haven\'t, Wyndham," said Riddell, kindly.\r\n\r\nWyndham did know, and at any other time would have felt reproached by\r\nthe consciousness of his own injustice.  But he was just now so bitterly\r\ndisappointed that he smothered every other feeling, and answered\r\nangrily, "Yes, you have, and I don\'t care if you have; I suppose it\'s\r\nbecause I\'m friends with Silk.  I can tell you Silk\'s a good deal more\r\nbrickish to me than you are!"\r\n\r\nPoor Riddell!  This, then, was the end of his hopes of winning over his\r\nold friend\'s brother.  The words struck him like a knife.  He would\r\nalmost sooner break all the rules in the school, so he felt that moment,\r\nthan drive this one boy to throw in his lot with fellows like Silk!\r\n\r\n"Wyndham!" he said, almost appealingly.\r\n\r\nBut Wyndham was gone, and the chance was lost.\r\n\r\nThe rest of that day passed miserably for the captain.  An ominous\r\nsilence and order seemed to hang over morning school.  No further\r\napplicants molested him.  No case of disorder was reported during the\r\nmorning, and at dinner the boys were so quiet they might have been in\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nJust after morning school, and before dinner, as he crossed the\r\nplayground, Wyndham passed him, talking and laughing with Silk; and\r\nneither of them noticed him.\r\n\r\nThe captain retired to his study, dejected and miserable, and, as his\r\nonly comfort, buried himself in his books.  For an hour at least before\r\nthe early call-over he might forget his trouble in hard work.\r\n\r\nBut before that hour was half-over Riddell closed his book with a start\r\nand a sense of something unusual.  This unearthly stillness all over the\r\nplace--he never remembered anything of the sort before.  Not a sound\r\nrose from the neighbouring studies, and when he looked out the\r\nplayground was as deserted as if it had been the middle of the summer\r\nholidays.  What did it all mean?\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the truth flashed upon him.  What could it mean, but that\r\nWilloughby had mutinied, and, in open defiance of his authority, gone\r\ndown without leave to Shellport!\r\n\r\nHe hurried out of his room.  There was scarcely a sound in the house.\r\nHe went into the playground--only one boy, Gilks, was prowling about\r\nthere, half-mad with toothache, and either unable or unwilling to give\r\nhim any information.  He looked in at Parrett\'s, no one was there, and\r\neven the schoolhouse seemed desolate.\r\n\r\nThe captain returned to his study and waited in anything but a placid\r\nframe of mind.  He felt utterly humbled and crestfallen.  It had really\r\nseemed of late as if he was making some headway in his uphill task of\r\nruling Willoughby, but this was a shock he had never expected.  It\r\nseemed to point to a combination all over the school to thwart him, and\r\nin face of such a feeling further effort seemed hopeless.\r\n\r\nRiddell imagined too much.  Would it have pained him to know that three-\r\nquarters of those who, politics-mad, had thus broken bounds that\r\nafternoon had never so much as given him a thought in the matter, and in\r\nfact had gone off, not to defy him, but simply to please themselves?\r\n\r\nThe bell for call-over rang, and Riddell went despondingly to the big\r\nhall.  Only about a score of fellows, including Bloomfield, Porter,\r\nFairbairn, Coates, and Wibberly (who, by the way, always did as\r\nBloomfield did), answered to their names amid a good deal of wonder and\r\na little laughter.\r\n\r\nBloomfield, who had also regarded the afternoon\'s business as a test of\r\nhis authority, looked as crestfallen as the real captain, and for the\r\nfirst time that term he and Riddell approached one another with a common\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be an awful row about this," said he.\r\n\r\n"There will," said Riddell; "will you report your fellows, or shall I\r\nsend up the whole list to the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"You send up all the names," said Bloomfield, "that is, unless Fairbairn\r\nwants to report the schoolhouse himself."\r\n\r\n"No," said Fairbairn, "you send up the list, Riddell."\r\n\r\nAnd so Riddell\'s captaincy received its first undisputed acknowledgment\r\nthat term, and he sent up his formidable list to the doctor, and with\r\nmingled curiosity, impatience, and despondency waited the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CAPTAIN TO THE RESCUE.\r\n\r\nThere was something more than toothache the matter with Gilks that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nThe fact was his spirits were a good deal worse than his teeth.  Things\r\nhad been going wrong with him for some time, ever since the day he was\r\npolitely turned out of the schoolhouse boat.  He had lost caste among\r\nhis fellows, and what little influence he ever had among the juniors had\r\nalso vanished.\r\n\r\nStill, if that had been all, Gilks would scarcely have been moping up at\r\nWilloughby among the virtuous few that afternoon, while the rest of the\r\nschool were running mad down in Shellport.\r\n\r\nHe had a greater trouble than this.  Silk, in whose genial friendship he\r\nhad basked for so many months, had not treated him well.  Indeed, it was\r\na well-known fact in Willoughby that between these two precious friends\r\nthere had been some sort of unpleasantness bordering on a row; and it\r\nwas also reported that Gilks had come off worst in the affair.\r\n\r\nThis was the secret of that unfortunate youth\'s toothache--he had been\r\njilted by his familiar friend.  Who would not feel sad under the\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\nAnd yet Gilks\'s frame of mind was, so to speak, a good deal more black\r\nthan blue.  As he paced up and down the playground, rather like a wolf\r\nin a cage waiting for dinner, he was far more exercised to devise some\r\nway of making his faithless friend smart for his cruelty than to win\r\nback his affection.\r\n\r\nWhen two good fellows fall out it is bad enough, but when two bad\r\nfellows fall out it may be even worse, for whereas in the former case\r\none of the two is probably in the right, in the latter both are pretty\r\ncertain to be in the wrong.\r\n\r\nNo one knew exactly what the quarrel had been about, or what, if any,\r\nwere its merits, or whether it was a breaking off of all friendship or\r\nmerely a passing breeze.  Whatever it was, it was enough to give Gilks\r\nthe "toothache" on this particular afternoon and keep him at Willoughby.\r\n\r\nThe hour that elapsed after call-over dragged heavily for every one.\r\nThe three heads of houses, after their brief consultation, went their\r\nseveral ways--at least Bloomfield went his, while Riddell and Fairbairn\r\nsolaced themselves in one another\'s society.\r\n\r\n"What is the use of keeping up this farce?" exclaimed Riddell, when they\r\nwere back in his study.  "_Isn\'t_ it a farce?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it.  I don\'t think much of this affair at all.  Of course\r\nthere\'ll be a row, but it seems to me a case of temporary lunacy that we\r\ncan\'t be responsible for."\r\n\r\n"But the doctor holds me responsible."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure he won\'t be down on you for this."\r\n\r\n"And then, isn\'t it just a proof to the whole school that I\'ve no more\r\nauthority than the smallest junior?  Look at that miserable notice there\r\non the door.  Who has cared a rap about it?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you\'re always flying off to despair whenever you get\r\nthe chance.  The same thing might have happened to any captain."\r\n\r\n"I wish some one else was captain," said Riddell.  "The fellows will\r\nmind what I say less than ever now.  I\'m sure I would gladly give it up\r\nto Bloomfield."\r\n\r\n"All bosh.  You know you wouldn\'t.  And when you\'ve got your head back\r\nyou\'ll laugh at yourself for thinking it.  Besides, wasn\'t Bloomfield\r\nevery bit as much cut up about it as you or me?  But," added Fairbairn,\r\n"to change the subject, do you see much of young Wyndham now you\'ve left\r\nus?"\r\n\r\n"Not much.  What about him?" asked Riddell, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Only I fancy he\'s not all straight," said Fairbairn.  "He\'s fallen into\r\nbad hands I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"That\'s an old story," said Riddell; "but what has he done?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing particular.  I caught him coming home one night late, long\r\nafter call-over.  I ought to have reported him for it, but I thought I\'d\r\ntell you first.  It\'s a pity for him, for he\'s not a bad fellow."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give anything to get him away from Silk!" said Riddell.  "It seems\r\na sort of infatuation with him, for he knows well enough Silk means him\r\nno good, and yet he\'s thick with him.  And now I expect he\'ll cut me\r\naltogether since I refused him a permit to the town this afternoon."\r\n\r\n"He\'s gone down all the same," said Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and not alone either," replied Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" exclaimed Fairbairn just then, as a sudden sound broke the\r\nunwonted stillness of the deserted school, "that sounds like some of the\r\nfellows coming back."\r\n\r\nHe was right.  As the two seniors stood leaning out of the window, the\r\nsounds which at first had been little more than a distant murmur\r\nincreased to a roar.\r\n\r\nWilloughby was evidently returning in force, and anything but\r\npeacefully.\r\n\r\nCries of "Now then, school!"\r\n\r\n"Hack it through, there!"\r\n\r\n"Down with the Radicals!"\r\n\r\n"Pony for ever!" mingled with yells and cheers and coarser shouts of\r\n"Down with the schoolboys!" indicated clearly enough that a lively\r\nbattle was in progress, and that Willoughby was fighting its way home.\r\n\r\nThe whole town seemed to be coming at their heels, and more than once a\r\npitched battle had to be decided before any progress could be made.  But\r\nslowly and surely the discipline of the schoolboys, animated by the\r\nfamiliar words of command of the football-field, asserted itself above\r\nthe ill-conditioned force of their assailants, and at every forward step\r\nthe triumphant shout of "Pony for ever!" rose with a mighty cheer, which\r\ndeafened all opposition cries.\r\n\r\nIn due time the playground gate was reached, amid tremendous cheering,\r\nand next moment, driving before them some of their demoralised\r\nopponents, the vanguard of the school burst in.\r\n\r\nEven Riddell and Fairbairn, as they looked down on the scene, could\r\nhardly forbear a little natural pride on witnessing this triumphant\r\ncharge home of their truant schoolfellows.\r\n\r\nThat the battle had been sore and desperate was evident by the limping\r\ngait, the torn clothes, and the damaged faces of some of the combatants\r\nas they swarmed in in an irresistible tide, amid the applause of their\r\ncomrades and the howls of the baffled enemy, who raged vainly without\r\nlike so many wild beasts robbed of their prey.\r\n\r\nAmong the last to fight their way in were Game, Ashley, Tipper, and a\r\nfew other seniors, who, truants as they were, had yet, to their credit,\r\nassumed the place of danger in the rear, where the crowd pressed\r\nthickest and with most violence.  A sorry spectacle were some of these\r\nheroes when finally they plunged into the playground and then turned at\r\nbay at the gate.\r\n\r\n"All in!" shouted a voice, and immediately a rush was made to close the\r\ngates and prevent further entrance, when a loud cry of "Hold on,\r\nWilloughby!  Rescue here!" held them back.\r\n\r\nRiddell started at the sound, and next moment had vaulted from the low\r\nwindow to the ground, closely followed by Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"Rescue! rescue!  Man down!" cried the school within.\r\n\r\n"Keep them in!--shut them in!" cried the roughs without.\r\n\r\n"It\'s young Wyndham!" said Riddell, rushing wildly to the front; "he\'ll\r\nbe murdered!"\r\n\r\n"Scrag him!--scrag the schoolboy!" yelled the roughs, making a rush in\r\nthe direction of the cries.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was to be lost; in another minute it might be too late to\r\ndo any good, and, with a tremendous shout of "Rescue, Willoughby!" the\r\nschool turned as wildly to get out of the playground as it had just now\r\nstruggled to get in.\r\n\r\nThe captain and Fairbairn were the first to get through the gate,\r\nfollowed closely by the other seniors.  Riddell was conscious of seeing\r\nyoung Wyndham lying a few yards off among the feet of the roughs, and of\r\nbeing himself carried forward to within reach of him; then of a blow\r\nfrom behind, which sent him forward, half-stunned, right on to the top\r\nof his young friend.\r\n\r\nAfter that Riddell was only dimly conscious of what passed, and it was\r\nnot until he found himself once more in the playground, being helped\r\nalong by Fairbairn towards the house, that he took in the fact that the\r\nrescue had been accomplished, and that the battle was at an end.\r\n\r\n"Did they get Wyndham in all right?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Was he much damaged?"\r\n\r\n"Very little.  You got it worse than he did."\r\n\r\n"Some fellow got behind me and sent me over," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Some fellow did," said Fairbairn, fiercely, "and I know who."\r\n\r\n"Who?"\r\n\r\n"Silk."\r\n\r\n"What! are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"I was as close to you at the time as I am now--I\'m quite sure."\r\n\r\n"The coward!  Did any one else see it?"\r\n\r\n"No, I think not."\r\n\r\nThe two walked on in silence to Welch\'s house, and once more reached the\r\nstudy they had so abruptly quitted.\r\n\r\n"Are you badly hurt?" asked Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit; my shin is a little barked, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"What a bulldog you can be when you like, old man," said Fairbairn,\r\nlaughing.  "I never saw any one go into battle so gamely.  Why, the\r\nwhole glory of the rescue belongs to you."\r\n\r\n"What bosh!  You had to rescue me as well as Wyndham.  But I\'m thankful\r\nhe\'s safe."\r\n\r\n"You\'re awfully sweet about that precious youngster," said Fairbairn.\r\n"I hope he\'ll be grateful to you, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nRiddell said nothing, and shortly afterwards Fairbairn said he must go.\r\nAs he was leaving Riddell called him back.\r\n\r\n"I say, Fairbairn," said he, in his half-nervous way, "you needn\'t say\r\nanything about Silk, there\'s a good fellow; it wouldn\'t do any good."\r\n\r\n"He deserves a good thrashing," said Fairbairn, wrathfully.\r\n\r\n"Never mind; don\'t say anything about it, please."\r\n\r\nAnd Fairbairn promised and went.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a novel sensation for the captain to find himself figuring\r\nin the eyes of Willoughby as a "bulldog."  He knew he was about the last\r\nperson to deserve the proud title, and yet such are the freaks of\r\nfortune, the exaggerated stories of the rescue, differing as they did in\r\nnearly every other particular, agreed in this, that he had performed\r\nprodigies of valour in the engagement, and had, in fact, rescued Wyndham\r\nsingle-handed.\r\n\r\nMore than one fellow dropped in during the evening to inquire how he\r\nwas, and to confirm his new reputation.\r\n\r\nPilbury and Cusack were among the first.\r\n\r\n"Is it true your leg\'s broken?" cried the latter, as he entered the\r\nstudy, in tones of unfeigned concern.\r\n\r\n"No, of course not," replied the captain, laughing.  "What made you\r\nthink so?"\r\n\r\n"The fellows said so.  Pil and I were too far behind to back you up, you\r\nknow, or we would have, wouldn\'t we, Pil?"\r\n\r\n"Rather," replied Pil.\r\n\r\n"Why," said the captain, catching sight of the bruised and ragged\r\ncondition of these young men of war--"why, you\'ve been knocked about a\r\ngreat deal more than I have."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Cusack, "that was in the run up from Shellport, you know.  We\r\ndid get it a little hot at first until we pulled together and came up in\r\na body."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Pilbury, "it was a jolly fine show-up for Pony.  He\'s\r\nsure to get in; the Radicals were nowhere."\r\n\r\n"And what are you going to say to the doctor in the morning?" asked\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\n"Eh? oh, I suppose we shall catch it.  Never mind, there\'ll be lots to\r\nkeep us company.  And we\'ve given Pony a stunning leg-up."\r\n\r\nAnd so the two heroes, highly delighted with themselves, and still far\r\ntoo excited to feel ashamed of their mutinous conduct, departed to talk\r\nover the day\'s doings with the rest of their set, and rejoice in the\r\nglorious "leg-up" they had given to the Whig candidate.\r\n\r\nOther fellows looked in, and bit by bit Riddell picked up the whole\r\nhistory of that eventful afternoon.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear whether the wholesale breaking of bounds had been a\r\npreconcerted act or a spontaneous and infectious impulse on the part of\r\nthe whole school.  Whichever it was, directly dinner was over and the\r\nmonitors had retired to their houses, a general stampede had been made\r\nfor Shellport, and almost before many of the truants knew where they\r\nwere they were in the thick of the election crowd.\r\n\r\nAt first each set vented its loyalty in its own peculiar way.  Some\r\nstood in the streets and cheered everything yellow they could discover;\r\nothers crowded round the polling places and groaned the Radicals; some\r\nwent off to look for the candidates themselves, and when at last Sir\r\nGeorge Pony appeared on the scene in his carriage his enthusiastic young\r\nsupporters set up a cheer enough to frighten the good old gentleman out\r\nof his wits, and, but for the active interference of the police, would\r\nhave insisted on taking out the horses and dragging the triumphal car\r\nthemselves round the town.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time these juvenile demonstrations were allowed to\r\npass with good-humoured forbearance by the town; but when presently,\r\nemboldened by their immunity, the schoolboys proceeded not only to hoot\r\nbut occasionally to molest the opposite side, the young Shellporters\r\nbegan to resent the invasion.  A few scuffles ensued, and the temper of\r\nboth parties rose.  The schoolboys waxed more and more outrageous, and\r\nthe town boys more and more indignant, so that just about the time when\r\nthe poll was closing, and when call-over was being sounded up at the\r\nschool, a free fight had begun in the streets of Shellport.\r\n\r\nAt the first alarm the school had rallied from all sides, and\r\nconcentrated its forces on the enemy, who seemed determined to dispute\r\nevery inch of the ground between the town and the school.\r\n\r\nHow that battle ended, and how finally the schoolboys got home, we have\r\nalready seen.\r\n\r\nRiddell did not feel it his duty under present circumstances to read his\r\nvisitors a lecture on the wickedness of breaking bounds.  He said it was\r\na wonder they had all got up as safely as they had, and that no more\r\ndamage had been done.  As to the penalties, he advised them to turn up\r\nat call-over in the morning and hear all about that from the doctor.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, just as Riddell was dressed, there was a knock at\r\nhis door, and young Wyndham entered.\r\n\r\nHe looked dejected and uncomfortable, but otherwise appeared to have\r\nrecovered from the effects of yesterday\'s ill-usage.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he, going up to the captain and holding out his hand, "I\'m\r\nawfully sorry I was such a cad to you yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit, old fellow," said Riddell, seizing his hand, and glowing\r\nwith pleasure at this unexpected visit.  "Everybody was a bit riled, and\r\nno wonder."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve no excuse, I know, after all your brickishness to me, and now,\r\nafter your helping me out as you did in the scrimmage yesterday, I\'m\r\nawfully ashamed of being such a low cad."\r\n\r\nThis was evidently no put-on apology for the occasion, and Wyndham, as\r\nhe spoke, looked as penitent as his words.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense!" said Riddell, who could never stand being apologised to,\r\nand always felt more uncomfortable at such times than the apologiser.\r\n"But I say, were you much hurt?"\r\n\r\n"No, not much.  I got down among their feet somehow and couldn\'t get up.\r\nBut if you hadn\'t turned up when you did I might have got it hot."\r\n\r\n"It was Fairbairn pulled us both out, I think," said Riddell, "for I was\r\ndown too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hear you got an awful hack."\r\n\r\n"Nothing much at all."\r\n\r\n"I say, Riddell," said Wyndham, nervously, after a pause, "I mean to\r\nbreak with Silk; I wish I\'d never taken up with him.  I shouldn\'t have\r\ngone down to the town at all yesterday if it hadn\'t been for him."\r\n\r\n"I think you\'d be ever so much better without him," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"I know I would.  Do you recollect lecturing me about sticking up for\r\nmyself that night last month?  I\'ve been uncomfortable about chumming\r\nwith him ever since, but somehow he seemed to have a pull on me."\r\n\r\n"What sort of pull?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the boy, becoming still more uncomfortable, and afraid of\r\nbreaking his promise to say nothing about Beamish\'s, "a good many things\r\nof one sort or another.  I\'ve gone wrong, I know."\r\n\r\nWyndham would have given much to be free to make a full confession of\r\nall his "going wrong" to the sympathetic Riddell, but, heartily weary as\r\nhe was of Silk and Gilks, he had promised them to keep their secrets,\r\nand young Wyndham, whatever his faults, was honest.\r\n\r\nRiddell was quick enough to see that there was something of the sort,\r\nand did not press to know more.  It was too good news to hear from the\r\nboy\'s own lips that he was determined to break loose from these bad\r\nfriends, to need to know any more.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how it is," said Wyndham, after another pause.  "It seems\r\nso much easier for some fellows to keep square than for others.  I\'ve\r\nmade up my mind I\'d do right a dozen times this term, but it\'s never\r\ncome off."\r\n\r\n"It\'s hard work, I know," said Riddell, sympathisingly.\r\n\r\n"Yet it seems easy enough to you.  I say, I wish you\'d look sharp after\r\nme for a week or so, Riddell, till I get a good start."\r\n\r\nRiddell laughed.\r\n\r\n"A lot of good that would do you!  The best person to look sharp after\r\nyoung Wyndham is young Wyndham himself."\r\n\r\n"Of course I know," said the boy, "but I\'ve sort of lost confidence in\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t any of us stand by ourselves," said the captain.  "I know I\r\ncan\'t.  But the help is easy to get, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nI need not repeat all the talk that took place that morning between the\r\ntwo boys.  What they said was meant for no ears but their own.  How one\r\nin his quiet manly way tried to help the younger boy, and how the other\r\nwith all sorts of fears and hopes listened and took courage, was known\r\nonly to the two friends themselves, and to One other from Whom no\r\nsecrets--not even the secrets of a schoolboy--are hid.\r\n\r\nThe bell for call-over put an end to their talk, and with lighter hearts\r\nthan most in Willoughby they walked across to the Great Hall and heard\r\nthe doctor\'s sentence on the truants of yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt was not very formidable.  No half-holiday next Wednesday, and for the\r\nseniors a hundred lines of Greek to write out; for the Limpets a hundred\r\nlines of Latin, and for the juniors fifty lines of Latin.  The doctor\r\nhad evidently taken a lenient view of the case, regarding the escapade\r\nmore as a case of temporary insanity than of determined disobedience.\r\nHowever, he relieved his mind by a good round lecture, to which the\r\nschool listened most resignedly.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one part of the punishment which fell heavily on a\r\nfew of those present.  Among the truants had been no less than five\r\nmonitors--Game, Tipper, Ashley, Silk, and Tucker.\r\n\r\n"It would be a farce," said the doctor, severely, "after what has\r\nhappened, to allow you to retain the posts of confidence you have held\r\nin the school.  Your blame is all the greater in proportion as your\r\ninfluence was greater too.  For the remainder of this term you cease to\r\nbe monitors.  It depends entirely on yourselves whether next term you\r\nare reinstated."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA MYSTERIOUS LETTER.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be expected that the political excitement of Willoughby\r\nwould altogether disappear until the result of the election was made\r\nknown.  And for some reason or other a whole day had to elapse before\r\nthe tidings found their way up to the school.\r\n\r\nAfter what had happened no one had the hardihood to ask leave to go down\r\ninto the town, and none of the butcher\'s or baker\'s boys that Parson and\r\nTelson intercepted in the grounds could give any information.  The hopes\r\nof Willoughby centred on Brown, the town boy, whose arrival the next\r\nmorning was awaited with as much excitement and impatience as if he had\r\nbeen a general returning home from a victorious campaign.\r\n\r\nFully aware of his importance, and feeling popularity to be too unusual\r\na luxury to be lightly given up, he behaved himself at first with\r\naggravating reserve.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s in!" shouted Parson from the school gate, the moment Brown\r\nappeared about a quarter of a mile down the road.\r\n\r\nBrown, of course, could not hear.\r\n\r\nThe question was repeated with greater vehemence as he approached, until\r\nat last he had no excuse for not hearing.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear, you old badger, who\'s in?" yelled Parson and Telson.\r\n\r\n"Look here, you kids," said Brown, loftily, "who are you calling a\r\nbadger?  I\'ll knock your cheeky heads together if you don\'t look out."\r\n\r\n"Oh I say, who\'s in! can\'t you speak?" reiterated the youths, who at\r\nthis moment possessed only one idea between them.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?  Who\'s got in?" repeated some Limpets, who were as eager\r\nevery bit to hear as the juniors.\r\n\r\n"In where?" replied the aggravating Brown, shouldering his way in at the\r\ngate and intoxicated with his own importance.  "What are you talking\r\nabout?"\r\n\r\n"Why, who\'s been elected for Shellport?  Is Pony in?" shouted the boys,\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n"Pony!" rejoined Brown, half-contemptuously, "do you suppose they\'d have\r\nan old stick like him!"\r\n\r\n"What," exclaimed Merrison.  "Is Cheeseman in after all, then?"\r\n\r\n"Eh?"\r\n\r\n"Is Cheeseman in, can\'t you hear?"\r\n\r\n"I never said he was," replied Brown, majestically.\r\n\r\nThis was rather too much, and a simultaneous rush was made for the\r\npompous town boy, and the secret forcibly extracted in double quick\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n"Now," cried one of the Limpets, giving his arm a premonitory screw,\r\n"out with it, or I\'m sorry for you."\r\n\r\n"Here, let go my arm, you cad, I say; oh! you hurt! let go, I--oh! oh!\r\nCheeseman\'s in!"\r\n\r\nThe arm was flung away in disgust as a simultaneous groan greeted the\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n"How much by?" demanded the inquisitors, once more preparing to apply\r\nthe screw.\r\n\r\nBut Brown had had quite enough of it, and answered glibly, "Eight\r\nhundred and twenty-five majority!"\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible blow, and in the general dismay which followed,\r\nBrown was temporarily overlooked.\r\n\r\n"Eight hundred and twenty-five!" exclaimed Merrison.  "Why, it\'s an\r\nawful licking.  Every one was sure Pony would be five hundred ahead."\r\n\r\n"It\'s foul play and bribery, depend on it," said another.\r\n\r\n"Or they\'ve counted wrong."\r\n\r\n"Or Brown is telling lies!"\r\n\r\nNow, if Brown had been a wise boy he would have taken advantage of the\r\nexcitement which immediately followed his announcement to retreat\r\nquietly and rapidly up to the school, and he reproached himself greatly\r\nthat he had not.  For the ill-temper of the assembly was only too ready\r\nto fix on some object upon which to vent itself, and this last\r\nsuggestion, coupled with the suspicion that Brown\'s father had been one\r\nof the backers of the Radical candidate, brought the town boy once more\r\ninto most uncomfortable notoriety.\r\n\r\nHe was hunted almost for his life round the playground and up to the\r\nschool.  It was no use for him to protest that he was out-and-out\r\nyellow, that his father had been on Pony\'s committee.  He was far too\r\nvaluable a scapegoat to be let off; and when at last he managed to bolt\r\nheadlong into the school and seek shelter in the master\'s cloak-room, it\r\nis safe to say that though he himself felt rather the worse for the\r\nadventure, Willoughby on the whole felt rather better.\r\n\r\nIn due time the news was confirmed, and the school settled rather\r\nviciously down to its ordinary work.  It was almost a relief when first\r\nschool was over, and all those who had impositions to write were ordered\r\nto keep their places and begin their tasks.\r\n\r\nWhat venom of wrath and disappointment could they not put into those\r\nunlucky lines!  If the paper had only been the skin of the Radical\r\nCheeseman, and the pens needles, _how_ they would have delighted in\r\ntheir penalty!\r\n\r\nScarcely had they begun work, however, when the school messenger came\r\nround unexpectedly to summon the whole school to assemble in the Great\r\nHall.  What could it be?  Was it another lecture? or had the doctor\r\nrepented of letting them off so easy?  Or was there to be another change\r\nin the captaincy? or what?\r\n\r\nThe hall soon filled, and every one waited impatiently for the doctor.\r\nHe arrived presently, with a letter in his hand and a somewhat important\r\nlook on his face.\r\n\r\n"The last time I spoke in this room," said he, "I had to discharge the\r\npainful duty of punishing the whole school for a serious and inexcusable\r\nact of insubordination."\r\n\r\n"Why do they always call it a _painful_ duty?" inquired the artless\r\nTelson of his ally; "I\'m sure it doesn\'t hurt _them_."\r\n\r\n"Silence! whoever is speaking!" said the doctor, sternly.  "I hope what\r\nwas said then will not be forgotten.  An act of that kind could not\r\npossibly be allowed to pass without punishment, and any repetition of it\r\nwould entail the severest measures.  However, I say no more of that at\r\npresent.  I have called you together to read to you a letter I have just\r\nreceived from the newly-elected Member for Shellport, Mr Cheeseman."\r\n\r\nAs the doctor pronounced this unpopular name, one hardy junior, quite\r\nmistaking the gravity of the occasion, began a low hiss.\r\n\r\nBefore the infection could spread the doctor suddenly laid down the\r\nletter, and with a voice of thunder demanded, "Who is that?  Stand up,\r\nsir, in your place!"\r\n\r\nThe luckless form of the youthful Lawkins, pale and scared, rose from a\r\nback bench.\r\n\r\n"Leave the room, sir!" said the doctor, wrathfully, "and write out your\r\nimposition double, and come to me after third school!"\r\n\r\nPoor Lawkins retired, and the assembly, being warned by his awful\r\nexample, heard the doctor out without further interruption.\r\n\r\n"Mr Cheeseman writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n"`Dear Dr Patrick,--I hope I need no apology for writing to you on a\r\nmatter affecting the boys under your charge.  A large number of these\r\nyoung politicians, as you are aware, took a somewhat active part in the\r\nrecent election, in which it was not my good fortune to be their\r\nfavourite candidate.  I understand that their crusade into the town was\r\nnot only without your permission, but in direct opposition to your\r\nwishes; and I conclude, that being so, the offenders have merited the\r\npunishment due for such escapades.  The election, as you know, is now\r\ndecided, and I am anxious that one of my first acts in my new capacity\r\nshould be one of intercession with you to take as lenient a view as you\r\ncan of this schoolboy freak; and if you should find it consistent with\r\nyour duty to remit any penalty that may have been inflicted, I shall be\r\nas grateful to you as no doubt your boys will be.\'\r\n\r\n"`I am, dear doctor,\'\r\n\r\n"`Yours faithfully,\'\r\n\r\n"`A.  Cheeseman.\'"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laid down the letter amidst ominous silence, which even the\r\nfeeble cheers of Bosher, Brown, and a few others barely disturbed.\r\n\r\n"In consideration of this generous letter," he continued, "I have\r\ndecided to remit the impositions I gave on Saturday, and also to\r\nwithdraw the prohibition about the half-holiday.  The matter of the\r\nmonitors I cannot reconsider.  I may suggest that, after what has\r\nhappened, it would be a graceful act on the part of the boys to send Mr\r\nCheeseman a letter of thanks, at any rate, if not of apology.  You are\r\nnow dismissed."\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that the majority of the boys were at a loss how to\r\ntake this strange and unexpected announcement.  True, they hated the\r\nRadicals, but they also hated impositions and detention, and the\r\nprobability is that, if left to themselves, they would quietly have\r\navailed themselves of Mr Cheeseman\'s clemency.\r\n\r\nBut to the small band of hot-headed enthusiasts the very notion of being\r\nunder an obligation to the Radical was repulsive.  They could scarcely\r\nwait till the doctor had departed before they vehemently denounced the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Merrison, "if that\'s not what you call adding insult to\r\ninjury, I don\'t know what you do!  I know _I_ mean to write every letter\r\nof my impot if it was a thousand lines instead of a hundred!"\r\n\r\n"So shall I; and I\'ll not stir out of doors all Wednesday afternoon\r\neither," said another.\r\n\r\n"Of course not; no honourable fellow would."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he thinks he\'s going to bribe us, the cad.  Perhaps he hopes\r\nwe\'ll give _him_ a leg-up next election?"\r\n\r\n"I vote we put on a spurt with the impots and get them all done\r\ntogether," said another.  "Paddy shall see which way we go, at any\r\nrate."\r\n\r\nAnd so, sorely to the disappointment of some of the juniors, who had\r\nbeen rejoicing prematurely in the removal of their penalties, the order\r\nwent round in all the houses that every boy was expected in honour to\r\nfinish his imposition by next day, and also to remain in on Wednesday\r\nafternoon, as a protest against "Radical cheek," and this was an appeal\r\nno loyal Whig could resist.\r\n\r\nIt was at least an unusual spectacle in Willoughby to see nearly the\r\nwhole school insisting on performing a task which no one required of\r\nthem; each boy not only doing it himself, but seeing that his neighbour\r\ndid it too!\r\n\r\nSeveral of the small boys and a few lazy seniors protested, but they\r\nwere coerced with most terrific threats.\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday half-holiday was spent in determined seclusion, scarcely a\r\nboy showing his face in the playground.  Even those who had not broken\r\nbounds on election-day, and who, therefore, in no case came under the\r\npenalty, felt quite out of it, and half ashamed of themselves in the\r\npresence of this general burst of political devotion; and it was\r\nrumoured that one or two of the weakest-minded of these actually stayed\r\nin and wrote out the imposition too!\r\n\r\nThe following morning was an impressive one in the annals of Willoughby.\r\nThe doctor, as he stood in the Great Hall speaking to Mr Parrett after\r\nmorning prayers, was, much to his amazement, waylaid by the school in a\r\nbody.  Every boy carried in his hand a sheet of paper, and wore on his\r\nface a most self-satisfied expression.\r\n\r\n"What is all this?" inquired the doctor, sharply, a little bit\r\nfrightened, perhaps, at this sudden and mysterious invasion of his\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\nMerrison was pushed forward by the crowd, and advancing paper in hand,\r\nreplied for the company generally.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said he, "we\'ve brought the impositions."\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"The impositions, sir.  We didn\'t want to be let off, so we stayed in\r\nyesterday afternoon, all of us, and wrote them."\r\n\r\nFrom the tones in which Merrison uttered this explanation one might have\r\nsupposed he expected the doctor to fall on his neck and shed tears of\r\njoy over the lofty virtue of his pupils.\r\n\r\nDr Patrick was quick enough to take in the state of affairs at once,\r\nand was wise enough to make the best of the situation.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said he, coolly, taking Morrison\'s proffered imposition and\r\nglancing his eyes down it.  "I am glad to see you desire to make amends\r\nfor what occurred on Saturday.  You can leave the impositions on this\r\ntable."\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, it\'s not that," said Merrison, hurriedly, alarmed at being\r\nsuspected of anything like contrition.  "It\'s not that; we--"\r\n\r\n"You can leave the impositions on the table," said the doctor, sternly,\r\nturning at the same time to continue his conversation with Mr Parrett,\r\nwhich the arrival of the visitors had interrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad blow for Willoughby, this!  They had expected better\r\nthings.  They had meant their act of self-devotion to be a crushing\r\ndefiance to the Radical, and even a mild rebuke to the doctor himself.\r\nBut it had turned out neither.\r\n\r\nSlowly and sorrowfully they filed past the table and laid their\r\nsacrifices thereon, and then departed, dejected and crestfallen.  The\r\ndoctor, with his back turned, never noticed them, and no one had the\r\nhardihood to attempt further to attract his attention.\r\n\r\nSo ended the election episode at Willoughby.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve enjoyed yourselves," said Crossfield to Tedbury the\r\nLimpet, that afternoon.  "Jolly time you\'ve had of it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all that young ass Morrison\'s doing," growled Tedbury.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Crossfield, laughing; "I\'m sure it\'s done you all\r\ngood.  You all wanted something of the sort, and you\'ll be better of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You\'re always trying to make a fool of me, Crossfield," said Tedbury,\r\nwrathfully.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, there\'s not much chance of that.  You are far too good\r\na hand at making a fool of yourself to put any one else to the trouble.\r\nTa, ta.  Shall you be down at the cricket practice again now?"\r\n\r\nThis last was a pertinent question.  For in the midst of all the late\r\npolitical excitement cricket had decidedly languished at the school, and\r\nthe Rockshire match as well as the house matches were getting alarmingly\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the first afternoon after Willoughby had returned to its\r\nsenses a general rush took place once more to the Big, and it was\r\nevident during the week which followed that the fellows intended to make\r\nup for lost time.\r\n\r\nNowhere was this activity more observed than in the newly-revived\r\nWelchers\' club, presided over by the captain, and enlivened by the\r\ncountenances of that ardent trio, Cusack, Pilbury, and Philpot.\r\n\r\nDuring the week preceding the election they had worked with unabated\r\nenthusiasm.  You might have seen practice going on any morning at half-\r\npast six in the Welchers\' corner of the Big.  The other houses at first\r\nregarded it as a good joke, and the earliest practices of the new club\r\nwere usually performed in the presence of a large and facetious\r\naudience, who appeared to derive infinite delight from every ball that\r\nwas bowled and every run that was made.  But the Welchers were not to be\r\nsnuffed out.  Riddell watched over the fortunes of the new club with\r\nmost paternal interest, losing no opportunity of firing its enthusiasm,\r\nand throwing himself heart and soul into its work.  Indeed, as a\r\ncricketer the captain came out in quite a new light, which astonished\r\neven himself.\r\n\r\nHe had always taken for granted he was utterly incapable of any athletic\r\nachievement, but, with the steady practice now entailed upon him, it\r\nbegan to dawn, not only upon himself, but other people, that as a\r\nfielder--at slip or cover-slip--he was decidedly useful, while as a\r\nbatsman he exhibited a certain style of his own that usually brought\r\ntogether a few runs for his side.\r\n\r\nBut even his own success was less than that of the club generally.\r\nEvery member of that small fraternity was intent on the glory of the\r\nclub, and worked hammer and tongs to secure it.  Mr Parrett, kindly\r\njack-of-all-trades as he was, was easily persuaded by Riddell to come\r\ndown occasionally and bowl them a few balls, and give them a few hints\r\nas to style generally.  And every time he came down he was more\r\nencouraging.  Even Bloomfield and a few of the First Eleven magnates\r\nthought it worth their while to saunter round once or twice and watch\r\nthe practice of this promising club.\r\n\r\nIt may be judged that, in proportion as the young Welchers found\r\nthemselves succeeding, their enthusiasm for their club and its president\r\nincreased.  The club grew daily.  Some Limpets joined it, and even a few\r\nseniors.  There was some talk of a first eleven to play in the house\r\nmatches, while by this time the second-eleven was an accomplished fact,\r\nits members thirsting for the day when they should match their prowess\r\nagainst the Parretts or schoolhouse juniors.\r\n\r\nThe election, as I have said, had rudely interrupted all this healthy\r\npreparation, and for a moment it seemed to Riddell as if all his new\r\nhold on his boys had disappeared.  But that event once over, great was\r\nhis relief to find that they returned to the sport with unabated and\r\neven increased ardour.\r\n\r\nThat week Welch\'s had out for the first time two sets of wickets, and\r\neven thus could hardly keep going all who wanted to play.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Bloomfield, one afternoon, as, with his friend\r\nAshley, he was quietly looking on, while pretending not to do so, "say\r\nwhat you will, Riddell doesn\'t do badly at slip.  Watch this over."\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Mr Parrett was bowling down some rather swift balls to\r\nthe boy who was batting, with a little break from the off, which the\r\nbatsman seemed unable to play in any manner but by sending them among\r\nthe slips.  So that, during the over, Riddell, blissfully unconscious of\r\nthe critical eyes that were upon him, had a busy time of it.  And so\r\nwell did he pick the balls up that the two spies stayed to watch another\r\nover, and after that another, at the close of which Bloomfield said,\r\n"Upon my word, it\'s not half bad.  And a slip\'s the very man we want to\r\nmake up the eleven for Rockshire."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Ashley, in tones almost of alarm, "you\'re surely\r\nnot thinking of putting a fellow like that into the eleven."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care much who goes in so long as he can play," said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"But fancy the fellow\'s bumptiousness if he gets stuck into the team!\r\nHe\'s bad enough as it is," said Ashley.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got the schoolhouse fellows to look at," said Bloomfield, "_come_\r\nalong.  If they\'ve any one better we\'ll take him, but we _must_ get hold\r\nof the best man."\r\n\r\nSo off they went, and the Welchers\' practice continued gaily till the\r\nbell for call-over sounded.\r\n\r\n"Riddell," said Cusack, who had become captain\'s fag since the migration\r\nto Welch\'s, "there\'s a letter for you."\r\n\r\n"Where?" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n"On your table.  I saw it there when I was sticking away your pens just\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"You may as well bring it," said Riddell; "I am going to the library."\r\n\r\nSo Cusack went off, and presently reappeared in the library with the\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nRiddell was busy at the moment searching through the catalogue, and\r\nconsequently let the letter lie unopened for some little time beside\r\nhim.  In due time, however, he turned and took it up.\r\n\r\nIt was a strangely directed letter, at any rate--not in ordinary\r\nhandwriting, but in printed characters, evidently to disguise the\r\nauthorship.\r\n\r\nRiddell hastily tore open the envelope of this mysterious missive and\r\nread the contents, which were also written like printing, in characters\r\nquite unrecognisable.\r\n\r\nThe letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n"Riddel,--If you want to get to the bottom of that boat-race affair, you\r\nhad better see what Tom the boat-boy has to say.  That\'s all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTOM THE BOAT-BOY EARNS FOUR-AND-SIXPENCE.\r\n\r\nRiddell, as he read over and over again the mysterious document in his\r\nhand, hardly knew what to make of it.\r\n\r\nIt looked like a clue, certainly.  But who had sent it?  Was it a friend\r\nor an enemy; and if the latter, might it not just as likely be a hoax as\r\nnot?\r\n\r\nHe examined the disguised writing letter for letter, but failed to\r\nrecognise in it the hand of any one he knew.  He called back Cusack and\r\ncross-examined him as to how and when the letter was brought to his\r\nstudy; but Cusack could tell him nothing.  All he knew was that when he\r\nwent in to look after Riddell\'s tea that afternoon, it was lying there\r\non the table.  He couldn\'t say how long it had been there.  He hadn\'t\r\nbeen in the room since dinner, nor had Riddell.\r\n\r\nCusack was very curious to know what the letter was about concerning\r\nwhich the captain seemed so much excited; but Riddell declined to\r\ngratify him on this point, and put the paper away in his pocket and\r\nreturned to his work.\r\n\r\n"No," said he to himself, "if it\'s a hoax there\'s no object in making it\r\npublic property, and still less reason if there\'s anything in it."\r\n\r\nOf one thing he was determined--he must go down to-morrow morning and\r\nhave an interview with Tom the boat-boy.  The thing _might_ all be a\r\nhoax, but if there was the remotest chance of its being otherwise it was\r\nclearly his duty to do what he could to find out the miscreant who had\r\nbrought such disgrace upon Willoughby.  So he spent a somewhat uneasy\r\nevening, and even appeared absent-minded when young Wyndham, now a\r\nconstant visitor to his study, paid his usual evening call.\r\n\r\n"I say," said the boy, with beaming face, as he entered, "isn\'t it\r\nprime, Riddell?  Bloomfield\'s going to try me in the second-eleven, he\r\nsays.  You know I\'ve been grinding at cricket like a horse lately, and\r\nhe came down and watched me this afternoon, and I was in, and made no\r\nend of a lucky score off Dobson\'s bowling.  And then Bloomfield said\r\nhe\'d bowl me an over.  My eye! what a funk I was in.  I could hardly\r\nhold the bat.  But I straightened up somehow, and his first ball went\r\nby.  The next was frightfully swift, and dead on, but it broke a bit to\r\nthe leg, and I was just in time to get at it and send it right away\r\nbetween long-leg and long-stop in the elms--a safe five if we\'d been\r\nrunning.  And old Bloomfield laughed and said he couldn\'t wait till the\r\nball was sent up, and said I could turn up at the second-eleven Big\r\npractice to-morrow and see how I got on there.  I say, isn\'t it prime,\r\nRiddell?  I tell you, I shall stand on my head if I get into the team."\r\n\r\nRiddell had only partially heard this jubilant speech, for at that\r\nmoment Tom the boat-boy was more in his thoughts even than Wyndham the\r\nLimpet.  However, he had heard enough to gather from it that his young\r\n_protege_ was in a vast state of joy and content, and as usual he was\r\nready with any amount of sympathy.\r\n\r\n"It will be splendid if you do get in," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  They\'ve only got eight places actually fixed, I hear, so I\'ve\r\nthree chances.  I say, Riddell, I like Bloomfield, do you know?  I think\r\nhe\'s an awfully good captain."\r\n\r\nRiddell could not help smiling at this artless outburst from the young\r\ncandidate for cricket honours, and replied, "I like him too, for he came\r\nand watched our practice too, here at Welch\'s."\r\n\r\n"Did he bowl you any balls?" demanded Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"No, happily," said Riddell; "but some one told me he told somebody else\r\nthat I might possibly squeeze into the eleven against Rockshire if I\r\npractised hard."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Wyndham, in most uncomplimentary astonishment.  "_You_\r\nin the first eleven!  I say, it must be a mistake."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid they\'ll think it a mistake," said Riddell, laughing; "but I\r\ncertainly have heard something of the sort."\r\n\r\n"Why, you usen\'t to play at all in our house," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"No more I did; but since I came here I\'ve been going in for it rather\r\nmore, though I never dreamt of such rapid promotion."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Wyndham, quite patronisingly, "I\'m jolly glad to hear it;\r\nbut I wish you were in the schoolhouse instead of Welch\'s.  By the way,\r\nhow are the `kids\' in your house getting on?"\r\n\r\n"The `kids\' are getting on very well, I fancy," said the captain.\r\n"They\'ve a match with the Parrett\'s juniors fixed already, and mean to\r\nchallenge the schoolhouse too, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"I say, that\'s coming it rather strong," said Wyndham, half\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a fact, though," said Riddell, "and what\'s more, I have it on\r\nParrett\'s authority that they are getting to play very well together,\r\nand any eleven that plays them will have to look out for itself if it is\r\nto beat them."\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho!  I guess our fellows will be able to manage that.  Of course,\r\nyou know, if I\'m in the second-eleven, I shan\'t be able to play with my\r\nhouse juniors."\r\n\r\n"That will be a calamity!" said Riddell, laughing, as he began to get\r\nout his books and settle himself for the evening\'s work.\r\n\r\nDespite all the boy\'s juvenile conceit and self-assurance, Riddell\r\nrejoiced to find him grown enthusiastic about anything so harmless as\r\ncricket.  Wyndham had been working hard the last week or so in a double\r\nsense--working hard not only at cricket, but in striving to act up to\r\nthe better resolutions which, with Riddell\'s help, he had formed.  And\r\nhe had succeeded so far in both.  Indeed, the cricket had helped the\r\ngood resolutions, and the good resolutions had helped the cricket.  As\r\nlong as every spare moment was occupied with his congenial sport, and a\r\nplace in the second-eleven was a prize within reach, he had neither time\r\nnor inclination to fall back on the society of Silk or Gilks, or any of\r\ntheir set.  And as long as the good resolutions continued to fire his\r\nbreast, he was only too glad to find refuge from temptation in the\r\nsteady pursuit of so honourable an ambition as cricket.\r\n\r\nHe was, if truth must be told, more enthusiastic about his cricket than\r\nabout his studies, and that evening it was a good while before Wyndham\r\ncould get his mind detached from bats and balls and concentrated on\r\nLivy.\r\n\r\nRiddell himself, too, found work more than ordinarily difficult that\r\nnight, but his thoughts were wandering on far less congenial ground than\r\ncricket.\r\n\r\nSupposing that letter did mean something, how ought he to act?  It was\r\nno pleasant responsibility to have thrown on his shoulders the duty of\r\nbringing a criminal to justice, and possibly of being the means of his\r\nexpulsion.  And yet the honour of Willoughby was at stake, and no\r\nsqueamishness ought to interfere with that.  He wished, true or untrue,\r\nthat the wretched letter had been left anywhere but in his study.\r\n\r\n"I say," said young Wyndham, after about an hour\'s spell of work, and\r\nstrangely enough starting the very topic with which Riddell\'s mind was\r\nfull--"I say, I think that boat-race business is blowing over, do you\r\nknow?  You don\'t hear nearly so much about it now."\r\n\r\n"The thing is, ought it to blow over?" said the captain, gravely.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course!  Besides, after all it may have been an accident.  I\r\nbroke a bit of cord the other day, and it looked just as if it had been\r\npartly cut through.  Anyhow, it\'s just as much the Parretts business as\r\nours, and they aren\'t doing anything, I know."\r\n\r\n"It would be a good deal more satisfactory to have it cleared up," said\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\n"It would do just as well to have a new race, and settle the thing right\r\noff--even if they were to lick us."\r\n\r\nWyndham went soon afterwards.  Riddell was too much occupied with his\r\nown perplexities to think much just then of the boy\'s views on this\r\nburning question.  And after all, had he thought of them, he would\r\nprobably have guessed, as the reader may have done, that Wyndham\'s\r\npresent cricket mania made him dread any reopening of the old soreness\r\nbetween Parrett\'s and the schoolhouse, which would be sure to result,\r\namong other things, in his exclusion, as a member of the latter\r\nfraternity, from the coveted place in the second-eleven.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the captain was up early, and on his way to the boat-\r\nhouse.  Ever since the race the river had been almost deserted, at any\r\nrate in the early mornings.\r\n\r\nConsequently when Riddell arrived at the boat-house he found no one up.\r\nAfter a good deal of knocking he managed to rouse the boatman.\r\n\r\n"I want Tom," he said, "to steer me up to the Willows."\r\n\r\n"You might have let me known you\'d want the gig yesterday," said the\r\nman, rather surlily; "I\'d have left it out for you overnight."\r\n\r\nHad it been Bloomfield or Fairbairn, or any other of the boating heroes\r\nof Willoughby, Blades the boatman would have sung a very different song.\r\nBut a boatman does not know anything about senior classics.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find a boat moored by the landing there," said that functionary;\r\n"and give a call for young Alf, he\'ll do to steer you."\r\n\r\nBut this would not suit Riddell at all.  "No," said he; "I want Tom,\r\nplease, and tell him to be quick."\r\n\r\nThe man went off surlily, and Riddell was left to kick his heels for\r\ntwenty minutes in a state of very uncomfortable suspense.\r\n\r\nAt length, to his relief, Tom, a knowing youth of about fourteen,\r\nappeared, with a cushion over one shoulder and a pair of sculls over the\r\nother, and the embarkation was duly effected.\r\n\r\nTom was a privileged person at Willoughby.  In consideration of not\r\nobjecting to an occasional licking, he was permitted to be as impudent\r\nand familiar as he pleased to the young gentlemen in whose service he\r\nlaboured.  Being a professional waterman, he considered it his right to\r\npatronise everybody.  Even old Wyndham last season had received most\r\nfatherly encouragement from this irreverent youngster, while any one who\r\ncould make no pretensions to skill with the oars was simply at his\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThis being so, Riddell had made up his mind for a trying time of it, and\r\nwas not disappointed.\r\n\r\n"What! so you\'re a-goin\' in for scullin\' then?" demanded the young\r\nwaterman as the boat put off.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I want to try my hand," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"_You\'ll_ never do no good at it, I can tell yer, before yer begins,"\r\nsaid the boy.\r\n\r\nSo it seemed.  What with inexperience of the sculls, and nervousness\r\nunder the eye of this ruthless young critic, and uneasiness as to the\r\noutcome of this strange interview, Riddell made a very bad performance.\r\n\r\n"Ya-ow!  I thought it would come to that!" jeered Tom when, after a few\r\nstrokes, the captain got his sculls hopelessly feathered under water and\r\ncould not get them up again.  "There you are!  That comes of diggin\'!\r\nAlways the way with you chaps!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose, instead of going on like that," said Riddell, getting up the\r\nblades of his sculls with a huge effort, "you show me the way to do it\r\nproperly!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of showing you?  You could never learn, I can see it by\r\nthe looks of you!"\r\n\r\nAfter this particularly complimentary speech Riddell rowed ploddingly on\r\nfor a little distance, Tom whistling shrilly in the stern all the way in\r\na manner most discouraging for conversation.\r\n\r\nBut Riddell was determined, come what would, he would broach the\r\nunpleasant subject.  Consequently, after some further progress up-\r\nstream, he rested on his oars, and said, "I\'ve not been out on the water\r\nsince the day of the boat-race."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you, though?" said Tom.\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n"That was a queer thing, the rudder-line breaking that day," said\r\nRiddell, looking hard at his young companion.\r\n\r\nTom apparently did not quite like it.  Either it seemed as if Riddell\r\nthought _he_ knew something about the affair, or else his conscience was\r\nnot quite easy.\r\n\r\n"In course it was," replied he, surlily.  "I knows nothink about it."\r\n\r\nRiddell, for a quiet, nervous boy, was shrewd for his age, and there was\r\nsomething in Tom\'s constrained and uncomfortable manner as he made this\r\ndisclaimer that convinced him that after all the mysterious letter _had_\r\nsomething in it.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold step to take, he knew, and it might end in a failure, but\r\nhe would chance it at any rate.\r\n\r\n"You do know something about it, Tom!" said he, sternly, and with a\r\nsearching look at the young waterman.\r\n\r\nTom did!  He didn\'t say so!  Indeed he violently denied that he did, and\r\nbroke out into a state of most virtuous indignation.\r\n\r\n"Well I ever, if that ain\'t a nice thing to say to a chap.  I tell you,\r\nI knows nothink about it.  The idea!  What \'ud I know anythink about it\r\nfor?  I tell you you\'re out, governor.  You\'re come to the wrong shop--\r\ndo you hear?"\r\n\r\nRiddell did hear; and watching the boy\'s manner as he hurried out these\r\nprotests, he was satisfied that he was on the right tack.\r\n\r\nIt had never occurred to him before.  Perhaps the culprit was Tom\r\nhimself; perhaps it was he who, for some reason of his own, had cut the\r\nline and caused all the mischief.\r\n\r\nIf that were so, what a relief and what a satisfaction it would be!\r\nRiddell felt that if Tom himself were the wrong-doer he could almost\r\nembrace him, so great would be his joy at knowing that no Willoughby boy\r\nwas guilty of the crime.  But it was too good a notion to be true, and\r\nTom soon dispelled it.\r\n\r\n"I tell you," continued he, vehemently, but looking down so as to avoid\r\nthe captain\'s eye.  "I tell you I aren\'t done it, there.  It\'s no use\r\nyour trying to fix it on me.  Do you suppose I wouldn\'t know if I\'d done\r\nit?  You blame the right parties, governor, do you hear?  I _ain\'t_ done\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I never said you did," replied Riddell, feeling he had by this time got\r\nthe upper hand in the argument, "but you know who did."\r\n\r\n"There you go.  How do I know?  I don\'t know, and I ain\'t done it."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me," said Riddell, "the lines could have been cut\r\nand you not know it?  Don\'t you sleep in the boat-house?"\r\n\r\n"In course I do--but I ain\'t done it, there!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a young fool, Tom," said Riddell, sternly.  "What I want to\r\nknow is who did do it."\r\n\r\n"How do you suppose I know?" demanded the boy.\r\n\r\n"Who did do it?" again repeated Riddell.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, there!" retorted Tom.  "I never see his face."\r\n\r\n"Then some one did come to the boat-house that night?" said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"How do I know?  Suppose they did?"\r\n\r\n"Suppose they did?  I want to know who it was."\r\n\r\n"I tell you I don\'t know.  It was pitch dark, and I ain\'t seen his face,\r\nthere; and what\'s more, I don\'t know the chap."\r\n\r\n"But you let him into the boat-house?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," said Tom, whose strong point was evidently not in\r\nstanding cross-examination.  "That\'s where you\'re wrong again.  You\'re\r\nall wrong."\r\n\r\n"You knew he was there, at any rate," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t.  You\'re wrong agin.  You don\'t know what you\'re talkin\'\r\nabout.  How could I know he was there, when I worn\'t there myself?"\r\n\r\n"What! did he get in while you were away?"\r\n\r\n"In course he did.  Do you suppose I goes to bed like you kids at eight\r\no\'clock?  No fear.  Why, I don\'t get my supper at Joe Blades\'s till\r\nten."\r\n\r\n"Then you found some one in the boat-house when you went there, after\r\nsupper, to go to bed?"\r\n\r\n"There you are, all wrong agin.  How do you suppose I\'d find him when he\r\ngot out of the window?"\r\n\r\n"Then he came in and went out by the window?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Why, you don\'t suppose he could come down the chimbley, do you?"\r\nretorted Tom, scornfully, "and there\'s no way else."\r\n\r\n"You had the key of the door all the time, of course," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"In course.  Do you suppose we leaves the boat\'us open for anybody as\r\nlikes to come in without leave?"\r\n\r\n"Then it was seeing the window open made you know some one had been in?"\r\ncontinued the captain.\r\n\r\n"Wrong agin!  Why, you aren\'t been right once yet."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean you really saw some one there?"\r\n\r\n"How _could_ I see him when he was a-hoppin\' out of the winder just as I\r\ncomes in?  I tell you I didn\'t see him.  You couldn\'t have sor him\r\neither, not with all your learnin\'."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ve no idea who it was?"\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t I? that\'s all you know."\r\n\r\n"Why, you say you never saw him.  Did you hear his voice?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Has some one told you?  Has he come and told you himself?"\r\n\r\n"No, he ain\'t.  Wrong agin."\r\n\r\n"Did he leave anything behind that you would know him by, then?"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up sharply at Riddell, who saw that he had made a point,\r\nand followed it up.\r\n\r\n"What did he leave behind?  His cap?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"His cap!  Do you suppose chaps cut strings with their caps?  Why, you\r\nmust be a flat."\r\n\r\n"His knife, was it?" exclaimed Riddell, excitedly.  "Was it his knife?"\r\n\r\n"There you go; you\'re so clever.  I as good as tell yer, and then you go\r\non as if you guessed it yourself!  You ain\'t got as much learnin\' as you\r\nthink, governor."\r\n\r\n"But was it his knife he left behind?" inquired Riddell, too eager to\r\nattend to the sarcasms of his companion.\r\n\r\n"What could it \'a been, unless it might be a razor.  You don\'t cut ropes\r\nwith your thumb-nails, do you?  Of course it was his knife."\r\n\r\n"And have you got it still, Tom?"\r\n\r\nHere Tom began to get shy.  As long as it was only information that the\r\ncaptain wanted to get at he didn\'t so much mind being cross-examined,\r\nbut directly it looked as if his knife was in peril he bristled up.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do," said he gruffly; "my knife\'s nothink to do with you."\r\n\r\n"I know it isn\'t, and I don\'t want to take it from you.  I only want to\r\nlook at it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; all very fine.  And you mean to make out as it\'s yourn and you\r\nwas the chap I saw hoppin\' out of the winder, do yer?  I know better.\r\nHe weren\'t your cut, so you needn\'t try to make that out."\r\n\r\n"Of course it wasn\'t I," said Riddell, horrified even at the bare\r\nsuspicion, still more at the idea of any one confessing to such a crime\r\nfor the sake of getting a paltry knife.\r\n\r\nStill Tom was obdurate and would not produce his treasure.  In vain\r\nRiddell assured him that he made no claim to it, and, even if the knife\r\nwere his own, would not dream of depriving the boy of it now.  Tom\r\nlistened to it all with an incredulous scowl, and Riddell was beginning\r\nto despair of ever setting eyes on the knife, when the boy solved the\r\ndifficulty of his own accord.\r\n\r\n"What do you want to look at it for?" he demanded.  "Only to see if I\r\nknew whose it was once."\r\n\r\n"Well, I ain\'t a-goin\' to let yer see it unless you lay a half-a-crown\r\ndown on that there seat.  There!  I ain\'t a-going to be done by you or\r\nany of your scholars."\r\n\r\nRiddell gladly put down the money and had the satisfaction at last of\r\nseeing Tom fumble in his pockets for the precious weapon.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time coming to light, and meanwhile the boy kept a\r\nsuspicious eye on the money, evidently not quite sure whether, after\r\nall, he was safe.\r\n\r\nAt length from the deepest depth of his trouser pocket his hand emerged,\r\nbringing with it the knife.\r\n\r\nHad Tom not been so intent on the half-crown which lay on the seat he\r\nwould have been amazed at the sudden pallor which overspread the\r\ncaptain\'s face and the half-suppressed gasp which he gave as his eyes\r\nfell on--_young Wyndham\'s knife_!\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking it.  Riddell knew it well.  Wyndham when first he\r\npossessed it was never tired of flourishing it proudly before all his\r\nacquaintances, and finding some pretext for using it or lending it every\r\nfive minutes of the day.\r\n\r\nRiddell had often had it pressed upon him.  Yes, and now, with a shock\r\nthat was almost sickening, he recollected that he had had it in his hand\r\nthat very night before the boat-race.\r\n\r\nAnd with the thought there rushed in upon him the whole memory of that\r\nevening.  How excited, how restless the boy had been, how impossible he\r\nhad found it to work, how wildly he had talked about the coming race,\r\nand how he had set his mind on the schoolhouse boat winning.  Riddell\r\nremembered every word of it now, and how Wyndham\'s excitement had\r\nbaulked him of his desire for a serious talk that evening.  And then he\r\nremembered how abruptly the boy had left him, returning hurriedly a\r\nmoment after for his knife--this very knife which less than two hours\r\nafterwards had been dropped on the boat-house floor in the culprit\'s\r\nhurried retreat by the window!\r\n\r\nRiddell felt literally sick as it all rushed through his mind at the\r\nsight of the knife in Tom\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen it enough?" demanded the youth, still eyeing the half-\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n"Yes," murmured Riddell.  And surely he never uttered a truer word.\r\n\r\nTom, startled by his voice, looked up.\r\n\r\n"Hullo," said he, "what\'s up?  One would think you\'d never saw a knife\r\nafore!"\r\n\r\nRiddell tried feebly to smile and recover himself.\r\n\r\n"Tell you what," said Tom, struck with a brilliant idea--"tell you what,\r\ngovernor.  You lay another two bob on the top of that there half-a-crown\r\nand it\'s your\'s.  Come!"\r\n\r\nRiddell mechanically took out his purse and produced the florin.  It was\r\nalmost the last coin that remained of his pocket-money for that term,\r\nbut he was too miserable even to think of that.\r\n\r\nTom grabbed at the money eagerly, and deposited the knife in Riddell\'s\r\nhand in exchange.\r\n\r\nThen, with a load on his heart such as he had never felt before, the\r\ncaptain turned the boat\'s head and rowed slowly back to Willoughby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE ROCKSHIRE MATCH.\r\n\r\nRiddell was not destined to have much leisure during the next few days\r\nfor indulging his misery or making up his mind in what direction his\r\nduty lay.\r\n\r\nAs he reached the school after his memorable excursion on the river, he\r\nwas met by Fairbairn, who had evidently been on the lookout for him.\r\n\r\n"Why, where have you been? and what\'s wrong?" he exclaimed, as he\r\nobserved his friend\'s dejected looks.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been a turn on the river," replied Riddell, making a desperate\r\neffort to recover his wits and look cheerful.\r\n\r\n"You look every bit as if you were just starting there to drown\r\nyourself," said Fairbairn; "but, I say, I\'ve got a message for you."\r\n\r\n"From whom?" inquired Riddell, who had had quite enough "messages"\r\nduring the last few days to last him for the rest of the term.\r\n\r\n"You\'d scarcely guess--from Bloomfield.  The thing is, he has two places\r\nyet to fill up in the eleven for Saturday, and he wants you to play for\r\none."\r\n\r\nDespite his trouble, Riddell could hardly conceal a smile of pleasure at\r\nthis honour, which, though not exactly unexpected, he had hardly\r\nrealised till now.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say," said he, "I\'m certain there are lots of better fellows."\r\n\r\n"You may be quite sure if there had been Bloomfield would have picked\r\nthem up," said Fairbairn.  "As it happens, we want a slip, and I heard\r\nBloomfield say himself that you are awfully good there.  You seem to\r\nhave hidden your light under a bushel, old man, while in the\r\nschoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"I may have been lucky while Bloomfield was watching," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"All gammon.  You needn\'t fancy he\'s doing this to compliment you, old\r\nman.  Game and that lot are awfully down on him about it.  They\'d like\r\nto make up the team entirely of Parretts, but it seems they can\'t do\r\nwithout us for once!  Of course you\'ll play."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Riddell; "he\'s captain of the eleven; I must."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah.  Well, you\'ll have to turn up at the Big practices, of course,\r\nduring the next three days.  There\'s one at three this afternoon and\r\nanother at 6:30, and if you like to come down for an hour after first\r\nschool I\'ll give you some balls at the nets."\r\n\r\nThis was Tuesday.  The Rockshire match was to come off on Saturday, and\r\nbetween now and then, as Riddell well knew, every spare moment he could\r\ncall his own would have to be devoted to cricket.\r\n\r\nPersonally, with the burden of the secret of young Wyndham\'s knife upon\r\nhim, he would have been glad enough of some excuse for avoiding the\r\nhonour even of a place in the first eleven.  But there was no such\r\nexcuse.  On the contrary, his duty pointed clearly to his making the\r\nbest of the opportunity.  As captain of the school, even a humble place\r\nin the first eleven would be an undoubted gain to his influence; while\r\nto Welch\'s--demoralised Welch\'s--the knowledge that once more one of\r\ntheir number was "playing for the school" might be of real service.\r\n\r\nTill Saturday, at any rate, he must try to banish the hideous nightmare\r\nfrom his mind, and give himself up wholly to the calls of cricket.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to resolve to give up one\'s mind to a pursuit than it is to\r\ndo it, and for the first day or two Riddell found himself but a\r\nhalfhearted cricketer.  However, as the eventful day drew near things\r\ngrew more serious, not to say critical.\r\n\r\nIt was a nervous occasion for the captain the first time he presented\r\nhimself at a Big practice, and he could not help feeling that the eyes\r\nwhich watched his performance were more than ordinarily critical, and\r\nmany of them less than ordinarily friendly.\r\n\r\nStill he managed not to disgrace himself, and on the next occasion,\r\nhaving partially recovered his presence of mind, he was able to do\r\nhimself even more justice.  Every one had to admit that Riddell was a\r\nlong way off being a fine cricketer--he would have been the first to\r\nadmit it himself--but for all that, what with a quick eye, and much\r\nperseverance, and sound judgment, he possessed more than one of the\r\nqualities which go to make up a useful member of any team.\r\n\r\n"He ought to do," said Bloomfield to Game on the Friday evening after\r\nthe last of the practices.  "He stood up to Fairbairn\'s bowling not at\r\nall badly."\r\n\r\n"Shouldn\'t wonder," said Game, whose prejudice was stronger than his\r\njudgment, "if Fairbairn bowled down easy to him on purpose; they\'re\r\nawfully thick, you know."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t bowl down to him easy," replied Bloomfield; "and he cut me\r\nfor two twice running."\r\n\r\nGame could not answer this argument, and was bound to admit a worse man\r\nmight have been put into the odd place.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pity, though; they\'ll be so jolly cocky, all that set, there\'ll\r\nbe no enduring it.  I only hope our fellows will do most of the scoring\r\nto-morrow, and not leave them a chance of saying they won the match for\r\nus."\r\n\r\nBloomfield laughed.  "Not much fear of that," said he; "but if they did,\r\nI suppose you\'d sooner beat Rockshire with their help than be thrashed?"\r\n\r\nGame was not quite sure, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nOne might have supposed that an occasion like the present, when the\r\npicked eleven Willoughby was to play the picked eleven of Rockshire,\r\nthat there would have been no place left for party rivalry, or any\r\nfeeling but one of patriotic ardour for the victory of the old school.\r\nBut so deeply was the disease of party spirit rooted in Willoughby that\r\neven this match came to be looked on quite as much as a struggle between\r\nrival houses as between the school and an outside team.\r\n\r\nThe discovery was made that the eleven consisted of five schoolhouse\r\nplayers, five Parrett\'s players, and one Welcher.  More than that, the\r\ningenious noted the fact that the two best bowlers of the eleven were\r\nBloomfield and Fairbairn, one from each house, who could also both field\r\nas wicket-keepers when not bowling.  And the two second bowlers were\r\nGame and Porter, also one from each house.  This minute analysis might\r\ndoubtless have been continued down to the cover-points.  At any rate, it\r\nwas manifest the two houses were very evenly divided, both as regarded\r\nmerit and place, and it would therefore be easy to see which contributed\r\nmost to the service of the school.\r\n\r\nThe Rockshire men arrived by the ten o\'clock train, and were met as\r\nusual by the Willoughby omnibus at the station.  As they alighted and\r\nproceeded to stroll in a long procession across the Big to their tent,\r\nthey were regarded with much awe and curiosity by the small boys\r\nassembled to witness their advent, some of whom were quite at a loss to\r\nunderstand how boys like themselves could ever expect not to be beaten\r\nby great whiskered heroes like these.  Even the young Welchers, who had\r\ncontrived to be practising close to the line of march, felt awed in\r\ntheir presence, and made a most hideous hash of the little exhibition\r\nwith which they had intended to astonish their visitors.\r\n\r\nThe self-confident ease of these Rockshire men was even a trifle\r\ndiscouraging for a few of the school heroes themselves, who looked on\r\nnervously as their rivals coolly went up and inspected the wickets and\r\ncriticised the pitch, and then proceeded, laughing among themselves,\r\ntowards the pavilion.  Things like this are more or less terrifying, and\r\nan old team that comes down to play a young one ought to be more\r\nconsiderate.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the school team that all its members were not as\r\nshy and diffident as others, or the operation of tossing for innings and\r\nother matters of form would never have been got through.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett, however, as an old \'Varsity blue, was as great a hero in\r\nthe sight of Rockshire as Rockshire was in the sight of Willoughby, and\r\nwith his aid the preliminaries were all arranged, and Willoughby went\r\nout first to field.\r\n\r\nThe Big was never so crowded with boys, masters, or the outside public,\r\nas it was on this bright June day.  The exploits of the school at the\r\nrecent election may have had something to do with the number of\r\ntownsfolk who flocked up to see the game, but apart from that the\r\nRockshire match was always one of the great events of the season.\r\n\r\nLast year, thanks to old Wyndham\'s prowess, the school had won; but\r\nbefore that, back almost to the days of the mythical Bouncer, the fates\r\nhad been the other way; and this year, good as the team was, no one had\r\nthe hardihood to predict with any confidence a victory for the boys.\r\n\r\nJust as Riddell was leaving the tent to take his place in the field,\r\nyoung Wyndham came up and clapped him cheerily on the back.\r\n\r\n"Go in and win, I say," he cried, gaily.  "I back you, old man."\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the two had met since Riddell\'s interview with Tom\r\nthe boat-boy, and the sight of his old friend\'s brother, and the sound\r\nof his voice just now, gave the captain a shock which for the moment\r\nalmost unmanned him.\r\n\r\nHe turned pale as he looked at the boy, and thought of that knife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say," said Wyndham, noticing his perturbation, "pull yourself\r\ntogether, old man; you\'ll get on all serene.  I was funky the first time\r\nI showed up for the second-eleven, you know, but it\'s all right now!"\r\n\r\n"Now, Riddell!" cried Bloomfield, impatiently, from the wickets; and off\r\nthe captain hurried to his post, with a load of trouble at his heart,\r\nand feeling anything but a jubilant athlete.\r\n\r\nWyndham, little dreaming what was passing through his patron\'s mind,\r\nsettled himself cross-legged at the door of the scorer\'s tent, and\r\nthought of nothing for the next few hours but the match.\r\n\r\nThe two Rockshire men, upon whom devolved the duty of "opening the\r\nball," strolled slowly up to the wickets, and a minute later the match\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the first few overs were uneventful.  The bowlers were trying\r\nwhat the batsmen were made of, and the batsmen were trying what the\r\nbowlers were made of.  Riddell was thankful for his part that no ball\r\ncame his way, and the spectators generally seemed to regard two maiden\r\novers as a sort of necessary infliction at the opening of any big match.\r\n\r\nBut when Bloomfield took the ball again it was evident things were to\r\ngrow a little brisker.  His first ball was very neatly patted towards\r\nsquare-leg for two, amid the cheers which always greet "the first\r\nblood," and his next ball slipped past the long-stop for a bye.  Wyndham\r\nand some other enthusiasts sighed, as if those three runs had settled\r\nthe fate of Willoughby.  But his sigh was abruptly turned into a cheer\r\nwhen next moment the Rockshire man\'s wicket tumbled all of a heap, and\r\none of the foe was out for three.\r\n\r\nWilloughby began to breathe again.  When they had seen those two\r\nportentous heroes go in, the prospect of their ever going out had seemed\r\nfearfully remote.  But now, if one man was got rid of for only three\r\nruns, why should not ten men go for only thirty?  At which arithmetical\r\ndiscovery the school immediately leapt from the depths of despondency to\r\nthe heights of confidence, and considered the match as good as won\r\nbefore it was fairly begun.\r\n\r\nHowever, during the next half-hour they had time to seek the happy mean\r\nbetween the two extremes.  The newcomer was a tough customer, and should\r\ncertainly have gone in first.  For he was one of those aggravating\r\nbatsmen who keep a steady bat at everything, who never aspire to a slog,\r\nnever walk out to a slow, never step back to a yorker, are never too\r\nsoon for a lob, or too late for a shooter--in fact, who play the safe\r\nplodding game in the face of all temptation.\r\n\r\nThe one comfort was, he did not make many runs.  Still, this sort of\r\nbusiness is demoralising for bowlers and slow for the field, and a\r\nchange of bowlers was consequently decided upon after about half an\r\nhour\'s play, when the score was at twenty-one.\r\n\r\nGame and Porter were the two new hands, the latter being the first to\r\nofficiate with a very neat maiden over, loudly cheered from the school\r\ntent.  Game who followed, was not so fortunate.  The Rockshire man who\r\nhad gone in first cut him hard for three on his second ball--the first\r\nhard hit of the match.  And this the steady man followed up with a quiet\r\ntwo neatly placed between point and mid-off.  Then came another ball,\r\nwhich the same player turned off sharply into the slips.\r\n\r\nIt was a fairly difficult ball to field, but Riddell picked it up\r\nsmartly and returned it to the wickets in time to prevent a run being\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n"Well fielded indeed, sir!" cried Wyndham\'s voice from the tent.  Little\r\nthought he how strangely those words of encouragement missed their mark.\r\nRiddell had just been forgetting his trouble and warming up to the\r\ngame, and now they came once more to remind him of that hated knife and\r\nTom the boat-boy\'s story.\r\n\r\nThe next ball the Rockshire man also "slipped," but this time, though it\r\nwas within easier reach, and for a first-rate fielder was even a\r\npossible catch, Riddell missed it, and two runs were made.  "Look out\r\nthere!" cried Bloomfield severely.  "Well tried, sir!" cried some one,\r\nsarcastically.  "Well missed, sir!" cried some one else, with painful\r\ntruthfulness.  Riddell saw the crisis.  Another miss like that, a few\r\nmore taunts like those, and he might as well retire from the field.\r\n\r\nNot for the first time in his life he pulled himself together with a\r\nvehement effort and shook off every thought but the one duty that\r\nclaimed him.\r\n\r\nAnd only just in time.\r\n\r\nThe last ball of the over was played again into slip, this time very\r\nsmartly.  The school shivered as they saw it whiz straight for the weak\r\npoint.  But they might have spared themselves their agitation, for\r\nRiddell had it--all but a catch--before the shiver was over, and had\r\nreturned it to Fairbairn at the wickets promptly enough to make the\r\nRockshire man feel he had had a narrow escape of a run-out.\r\n\r\n"Fielded, sir!" said Bloomfield, as the players crossed over; and this\r\ncommendation was more encouraging than all the shouts of the schoolhouse\r\npartisans.\r\n\r\nPorter\'s next over disposed of the first Rockshire man, amid great\r\nschool rejoicing, which was only tempered by the reflection among the\r\nParretts that it was a wicket to the credit of the schoolhouse half of\r\nthe eleven.\r\n\r\nThen followed a succession of short but smart innings, during which the\r\nRockshire score crawled up to seventy, despite of a further change of\r\nbowlers and very careful all-round fielding by the school.\r\n\r\nAll this time the steady man hung on obstinately; nothing seemed to\r\npuzzle him or tempt him out of his caution.\r\n\r\nAt length, in sheer desperation, Coates was put on to bowl; anything\r\nseemed better than this hopeless deadlock.  And so it turned out.\r\nCoates\'s first ball came down temptingly towards the off stump.  Any\r\nenterprising player would have cut it for a safe four, but this cautious\r\nhand, who seemed to smell a rat in everything, was evidently determined\r\nnot to be taken in by first appearances, and turned it off, half\r\ncontemptuously, to his favourite quarter among the slips, thinking\r\npossibly he might punish the next rather more freely.  But the next was\r\nnot to come for him.  Coates\'s ball was rising a bit as the batsman\r\ntouched it, and though he did not hit it up, it yet spun a foot or so\r\nabove the ground, an easy catch, straight into Riddell\'s hand, who held\r\nit fast, much to his own surprise, and greatly to the jubilation of all\r\nWilloughby.\r\n\r\n"Well caught, sir!  Caught, indeed!  Played up, Riddell!" were the cries\r\nwhich on all hands greeted the achievement, Wyndham\'s call being longest\r\nand loudest of them all.\r\n\r\nBut this time Riddell suffered no harm from the sound of that familiar\r\nvoice.  He had steeled himself against it for a few hours at least, and\r\nit was to him but one out of many.\r\n\r\nRockshire\'s first innings terminated shortly with no further event of\r\nnote.  The last wicket fell for ninety-two, a respectable total, of\r\nwhich fifty-nine had been made off the Parretts\' batsmen, and thirty-\r\nthree off the schoolhouse.  Indeed, the advantage of the schoolhouse did\r\nnot end there.  Out of three catches--not counting Riddell\'s--they had\r\nmade two, while of the five wickets which had been taken by the bowling,\r\nthey claimed three against their rivals\' two.\r\n\r\nGreat was the dismay of Parrett\'s as these results were made known.\r\nThey buoyed themselves up greatly, however, with the prospect of the\r\nbatting, where it would be strange indeed if they did not score better\r\nthan the schoolhouse.  And after all, it is the runs that win a match.\r\n\r\nBloomfield himself, be it said to his credit, allowed no petty\r\nconsiderations of party rivalry to influence him in sending in the best\r\nmen at the right time.  However much in some ways he might lend himself\r\nto the whims of his more energetic comrades, in a matter like the\r\nRockshire match, where he was in sole command, and responsible for the\r\nglory of the school, he acted with the sole object of winning the match.\r\n\r\nIt would have been easy to send in Fairbairn and Porter last, when they\r\nwould have no chance of scoring; or Coates, who was a rash hitter, and\r\nnever was safe until the back of the bowling had been somewhat broken,\r\nmight have been sent in first.\r\n\r\nBut such an arrangement Bloomfield knew would be fatal for the chances\r\nof the school, and it therefore never entered his head to contrive it.\r\nAnd his fairness in this respect was fully justified, for the school put\r\ntogether a hundred and twelve runs--just twenty more than their\r\nopponents--a performance which not even the most sanguine Willoughbite\r\nhad dared to anticipate.  Towards this total Riddell, who had gone in\r\nlast and carried his bat, had contributed seven, not a little to his own\r\nsurprise and the delight of the onlooking Welchers.  But the most\r\nremarkable thing about the innings was that, contrary to all\r\ncalculation, the five schoolhouse fellows had contributed no less than\r\nsixty-four runs to the total, while the Parretts\' united score only\r\namounted to forty-one.\r\n\r\nThe second innings of Rockshire differed very little from the first.\r\nThe steady man went in first, and bothered every bowler the school could\r\nbring against him; and, having had one lesson, he took good care not to\r\ngive himself another, and rather avoided slip for the future.  So that\r\nRiddell had a quiet time of it, fielding the few balls that came to him\r\nsteadily and promptly, but otherwise not figuring prominently in the\r\ndownfall of any wicket.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past four before Rockshire finally retired with a total for\r\ntheir second innings of ninety-nine, leaving the school boys with eighty\r\nruns to obtain to win.\r\n\r\nIt was not a formidable total after their first-innings performance, but\r\nat the outset a calamity happened enough to depress the hopes of any\r\nWilloughbite.\r\n\r\nBloomfield had gone in first with every intention of breaking the ice\r\neffectually for his side.  What, therefore, was the consternation of\r\neverybody when, after neatly blocking the first ball, he was clean\r\nbowled for a duck\'s-egg by the second!  Willoughby literally howled with\r\ndisappointment, and gave itself up to despair as it saw its captain and\r\nchampion retreating slowly back to the tent, trailing his bat behind\r\nhim, and not daring to look up at the hideous "0" on the telegraph\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nBut hope was at hand, though Parrett\'s was not to supply it.  Coates and\r\nCrossfield, who were now together, made a most unexpected and stubborn\r\nstand.  They even scored freely, and the longer they held together the\r\nharder it was to part them.  The reviving hopes of the Rockshire\r\npartisans gradually died out before this awkward combination, and Game\r\nand Ashley and Tipper, as they sat and watched this spirited performance\r\nby the two schoolhouse boys, felt their triumph for the school utterly\r\nswamped in the still more signal victory which the despised house was\r\nachieving over them.\r\n\r\nThe score, amid terrific cheering, went up to fifty-two before a\r\nseparation could be effected.  Then Coates was caught at long-leg, and\r\nretired, covered with glory, in favour of Tipper.\r\n\r\nAlas for Parrett\'s!  Tipper, in whom their forlorn hopes rested, was run\r\nout during his first over, while attempting to snatch a bye!\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious moment while Bloomfield was deciding whom next to send\r\nin.  There was still thirty runs to make, but unless he took care the\r\nwhole innings might be muddled away in the getting of them.\r\n\r\n"You go in, Fairbairn," said the captain.\r\n\r\nThe Parretts felt their fate to be sealed hopelessly.  Had Game been\r\nsent in he might still have done something for Parrett\'s, but now his\r\nchance might never come.\r\n\r\nIt did not come.  Fairbairn joined Crossfield, and the two did just what\r\nthey liked with the bowling.  As the score shot up from fifty to sixty\r\nand from sixty to seventy, the school became perfectly hoarse with\r\ncheering.  Even most of the partisans of Parrett\'s, sorely as the match\r\nwas going against them, could not help joining in the applause now that\r\nthe prospect of the school winning by seven wickets had become a\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nUp went the score--another three for Fairbairn--another two for\r\nCrossfield--seventy-five--then next moment a terrific cheer greeted a\r\nfour by Fairbairn, which brought the numbers equal; and before the\r\nfigures were well registered another drive settled the question, and\r\nWilloughby had beaten Rockshire by seven wickets!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\n"AM I MY BROTHER\'S KEEPER?"\r\n\r\nThe evening of the Rockshire match was one of strangely conflicting\r\nemotions in Willoughby.\r\n\r\nIn the schoolhouse the jubilation was beyond bounds, and the victory of\r\nthe school was swallowed up in the glorious exploits of the five\r\nschoolhouse heroes, who had, so their admirers declared, as good as won\r\nthe match among them, and had vindicated themselves from the reproach of\r\ndegeneracy, and once for all wiped away the hateful stigma of the boat-\r\nrace.  The night was spent till bedtime in one prolonged cheer in honour\r\nof their heroes, who were glad enough to hide anywhere to escape the\r\nmobbing they came in for whenever they showed their faces.\r\n\r\nIn Parrett\'s house the festivities were of a far more subdued order.  As\r\nWilloughbites they were, of course, bound to rejoice in the victory of\r\nthe old school.  But at what cost did they do it?  For had not that very\r\nvictory meant also the overthrow of their reign in Willoughby.  No\r\nreasoning or excusing could do away with the fact that after all their\r\nboasting, and all their assumed superiority, they had taken considerably\r\nless than half the wickets, secured considerably less than a third of\r\nthe catches, and scored considerably less than a quarter of the runs by\r\nwhich the match had been won.  Their captain had been bowled for a\r\nduck\'s-egg.  Their best bowlers had been knocked about by the very\r\nbatsmen whom the schoolhouse bowlers had dispatched with ease.\r\n\r\nIt was vain to attempt to account for it, to assert that the schoolhouse\r\nhad had the best of the luck: that the light had favoured them; or that\r\njust when they happened to bowl the Rockshire men had got careless.\r\nEven such stick-at-nothing enthusiasts as Parson, Bosher, and Co.,\r\ncouldn\'t make a case of it, and were forced to admit with deep\r\nmortification that the glory had departed from Parrett\'s, at any rate\r\nfor a season.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most patriotic rejoicings that evening were in Welch\'s\r\nhouse.  They cared but little about the rivalry between Parrett\'s, and\r\nthe schoolhouse, and were therefore free to exult as Willoughbites pure\r\nand simple, bestowing, of course, a special cheer on their own man,\r\nRiddell, who, though not having performed prodigies, had yet done honest\r\nwork for his eleven, and at any rate made one smart catch.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Fairbairn, who along with Coates and Porter had\r\nescaped from the violent applause of the schoolhouse and sought refuge\r\nthat evening in the captain\'s study--"I tell you what, I\'m getting\r\nperfectly sick of this everlasting schoolhouse against Parrett\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"So am I," said Porter.  "As if they need go into the sulks because our\r\nfellows did better than they did!"\r\n\r\n"They\'ve brought it on themselves, anyhow," said Coates, "and it may do\r\nthem good to have to sing small for once."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid if it had been the other way our fellows would have been\r\njust as much cut up as theirs are," said Fairbairn.  "Upon my word I\r\nhalf envy you, Riddell, old man, being a Welcher."\r\n\r\nRiddell smiled.\r\n\r\n"Our fellows certainly consider themselves free to abuse or cheer all\r\nround, without the least partiality.  Listen to them now."\r\n\r\nAnd certainly the hubbub that was going on was a trifle outrageous, even\r\nfor Welchers.\r\n\r\nIndeed it was so outrageous that Riddell was obliged to ask his visitors\r\nto excuse him for a moment while he went and quieted them.\r\n\r\nAs he opened the door of the preparation-room, where the house was\r\nassembled, a louder cheer than ever arose in his honour; and then those\r\nwho waited in the study heard a general lull in the noise, which\r\ncontinued in subdued animation after he had left the scene and returned\r\nto his friends.\r\n\r\nThis casual illustration of the captain\'s influence in his new house was\r\nquite a revelation to the three schoolhouse monitors.\r\n\r\n"Why, what do you do to them to shut them up like that?" asked Coates,\r\nwith something like envy in his tones.  "It takes half an hour\'s bawling\r\nto stop a row like that in our house, and a licking or two into the\r\nbargain; doesn\'t it, you fellows?"\r\n\r\nRiddell laughed.\r\n\r\n"They are cricket-mad at present," said he, "and I suppose they\'re\r\nafraid of having their match against Parrett\'s stopped."\r\n\r\nIt was a modest way, no doubt, of accounting for their obedience to his\r\nauthority; but whatever the reason might be, it was certain the captain\r\nhad no further occasion to interfere that evening.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one comfort about this match," said Fairbairn, after a pause,\r\n"we probably shall not hear any more of that wretched boat-race now."\r\n\r\nWhatever induced him to start this most unfortunate topic at this time\r\nof all others?\r\n\r\nRiddell, who amid all the excitement of the match had contrived\r\npartially to forget the burden that lay on his spirit, started\r\nuncomfortably at the words, and his face changed to one of undisguised\r\ntrouble.  The others could hardly help noticing it.\r\n\r\n"No, we\'re never likely to get at the bottom of it," said Porter; "so\r\nthe sooner it drops the better."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very odd, all the same," said Fairbairn, "that there\'s not been a\r\nsingle hint as to who did it.  I wonder if, perhaps, we were wrong in\r\ntaking for granted it was more than an accident."\r\n\r\nThis last question was addressed to Riddell, who replied, nervously and\r\nuneasily, "No, that is, yes.  It can\'t have been.  I\'m sure it wasn\'t an\r\naccident."\r\n\r\nHis three friends looked perplexed by his sudden confusion and change of\r\nmanner, and Porter had the presence of mind to change the subject.\r\n\r\n"I hear there\'s a jolly row on between Silk and Gilks," said he.  "No\r\none knows exactly why."\r\n\r\n"I heard it was a bet," said Coates.\r\n\r\n"At any rate they\'ve had a split," said Porter.\r\n\r\n"They never did much good while they were in partnership," said Coates.\r\n"Young Wyndham got rather drawn in by them, I heard."\r\n\r\n"Rather!" said Fairbairn.  "He was precious near going to the dogs\r\naltogether if old Riddell here hadn\'t pulled him up."\r\n\r\nRiddell seemed to lack spirit to join in the conversation, which\r\ncontinued without him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the young \'un cuts them dead now," said Porter, "but he\'s a bit\r\nafraid of them still, I fancy."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they could let out upon him about some scrape or other," said\r\nCoates, "and that\'s what gives them a pull."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, it\'s a good job he has pulled up," said Fairbairn, "for he\'s\r\nnot a bad youngster.  He\'s got into the second-eleven just lately, and\r\nis tremendously proud of it.  He\'s vowed he\'ll get old Wyndham to come\r\ndown and umpire in the match with Templeton second-eleven next month."\r\n\r\nAll this talk was anything but pleasant for poor Riddell.  Little did\r\nthe speakers dream of the connection between the boat-race and young\r\nWyndham; in fact, the latter topic, as he knew quite well, had been\r\nstarted on purpose to get over the awkwardness which his own confusion\r\nabout the former had caused.\r\n\r\nBut to Riddell, with that knife burning in his pocket, it was all one\r\nprolonged torture, so that he was heartily glad when at length his\r\nfriends rose to depart.\r\n\r\nHe excused himself from walking across the quadrangle with them, and\r\nsaid good-night in a spiritless way, very different from the cheery\r\nmanner in which he had welcomed them an hour ago.\r\n\r\n"I never saw such a rum fellow as Riddell," said Coates, as the three\r\nstrolled over.  "Did you see how cut up he got when something was said\r\nabout the boat-race?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s a little cracked on that subject," said Fairbairn.  "I do believe,\r\nuntil the culprit is found out, he considers himself responsible for the\r\nwhole affair."\r\n\r\n"Well, to judge by his looks he might have been the culprit himself,"\r\nsaid Porter, laughing.  "Hullo, here\'s young Wyndham."\r\n\r\n"Where are you off to?" asked Fairbairn, with due monitorial solemnity,\r\nof that flighty youth; "don\'t you know it\'s nearly eight?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you mind my going across to Riddell\'s?" asked the boy; "he\'ll\r\nthink I\'ve cut him if I don\'t show up.  I\'ve not been to his room for\r\nhalf a week."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a curious thing he has survived it so long," said Fairbairn,\r\nlaughing.  "Mind you are back by 8:30, though, for I\'ll have lock-up\r\npunctual to-night, while there\'s so much row going on."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Fairbairn," said Wyndham.  "I say, what a stunning score our\r\nhouse knocked up in the second innings.  Why, we--"\r\n\r\n"Cut off," cried Fairbairn, "and tell Riddell all about it.  Come on,\r\nyou fellows."\r\n\r\nWyndham hurried on full of the prospect of a talk over the match with\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\nJust at the door of Welch\'s, however, he met Silk.\r\n\r\nThe two had scarcely met since the day of the election, when Wyndham, to\r\nspite Riddell, had joined himself to this bad friend, and yielded to his\r\npersuasion to go down, against leave, to Shellport.\r\n\r\n"Oh, young \'un," said Silk, in friendly tones, "you turned up?  I\'d\r\nalmost given you up for good."\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to Riddell\'s," said Wyndham, determined for once to stand by\r\nhis colours and have nothing more to do with this tempter.\r\n\r\nSilk\'s face fell, as it always did when Riddell\'s name was mentioned.\r\nHe had imagined the boy was coming to see him, and it did not please him\r\nto find himself mistaken.\r\n\r\n"Are you?" said he.  "Come along to my study first, though; I want to\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t come, thank you," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t!  Why ever not?" exclaimed Silk.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to come, that\'s why," said Wyndham, doggedly, and\r\nattempting to move past.\r\n\r\nBut this by no means suited Silk.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I tell you you _must_ come," demanded he, stepping in front of\r\nthe boy with a menacing air.\r\n\r\n"Please let me go by," repeated Wyndham, making another attempt.\r\n\r\n"Not till you tell me what you mean by saying you won\'t do as I tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I mean that I\'m not going to your study," said young Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Silk, standing back to let him pass.\r\n\r\nThere was something in his tone and manner as he said the words which\r\nmade Wyndham uneasy.  He had made up his mind at all costs he would\r\nbreak with Silk; yet now he could not help remembering he was at the\r\nfellow\'s mercy.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of going on, he stood where he was, and said, rather less\r\ndefiantly, "Can\'t you say what you\'ve got to say here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course.  I can easily tell the whole school of your--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, please!" cried the boy in alarm; "you promised you wouldn\'t\r\ntell any one.  I\'ll come to your study."\r\n\r\nSilk, with a triumphant sneer, turned and led the way, followed by his\r\nchafing victim, who devoutly wished he had never thought of coming to\r\nsee Riddell at all.\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the study, Silk turned and said, "All I want to say\r\nis, that, I don\'t choose for you to be going such a lot to Riddell.  I\r\ndon\'t like him, and you\'d better keep away."\r\n\r\n"Why?" faltered Wyndham.  "It doesn\'t do you any harm."\r\n\r\n"How do I know you don\'t blab all my secrets to him, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wouldn\'t do it for anything.  I promised you and Gilks."\r\n\r\n"Bah! what\'s the use of that?  You go and tell him everything you do\r\nyourself, and of course he knows it means us as well as you."\r\n\r\n"No, he doesn\'t--really.  I\'ve never said a word to him about--about\r\nBeamish\'s."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good job you haven\'t; and you\'d better not, I can tell you."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t choose to have my concerns talked about to anybody," said Silk,\r\n"I suppose it was he put you up to cutting me."\r\n\r\n"No--that is," said Wyndham, "yes, he did advise me not to be so much\r\nwith Gilks and you."\r\n\r\n"He did?" exclaimed Silk, in a rage.  "I thought so; and you--"\r\n\r\nFortunately at this moment Tucker and one or two other of the noisy\r\nWelchers broke into the room; and in the diversion so created Wyndham\r\nwas thankful to slip away.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the end of his good resolutions and the hopes they had\r\nfostered!  He was as much in the power of this bad friend as ever--nay,\r\nmore, for had he not that very evening been forced to renew the one\r\npromise which kept him from confiding everything to Riddell?\r\n\r\nHe proceeded dejectedly to the captain\'s study, his cricket enthusiasm\r\nstrangely damped, and the load of his old short-comings heavy upon him.\r\n\r\nRiddell, who was pacing the room moodily, stopped in a half-startled way\r\nas his visitor entered.\r\n\r\n"Do you want me?" he said.\r\n\r\n"No," said Wyndham.  "I only just came across to see you, because I\r\nthought you\'d wonder what had become of me."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Riddell, trying to compose himself, "with all this cricket\r\npractice there\'s not been much chance of seeing one another."\r\n\r\n"No," replied Wyndham, whom the very mention of cricket was enough to\r\nexcite.  "I say, wasn\'t it an awfully fine licking we gave them?  Our\r\nfellows are crowing like anything, and, you know, if it hadn\'t been for\r\nyour catch it might have been a much more narrow affair."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well! it\'s all over now," said Riddell; "so I suppose you\'ll come\r\nand see me oftener?"\r\n\r\n"I hope so.  Of course, there\'s the second-eleven practices still going\r\non for the Templeton match, but I\'ll turn up here all the same."\r\n\r\nRiddell took a turn or two in silence.  What was he to do?  A word from\r\nhim, he felt, could ruin this boy before all Willoughby, and possibly\r\ndisgrace him for life.\r\n\r\nHe, Riddell, as captain of the school, seemed to have a clear duty in\r\nthe matter.  Had the culprit been any _one else_--had it been Silk, for\r\ninstance, or Gilks--would he have hung back?  He knew he would not,\r\npainful as the task would be.  The honour of the school was in question,\r\nand he had no right to palter with that.\r\n\r\nYet how could he deal thus with young Wyndham?--his friend\'s brother,\r\nthe fellow he cared for most in Willoughby, over whose struggles he had\r\nwatched so anxiously, and for whom, now, better resolves and honest\r\nambitions were opening up so cheery a prospect.  How could he do it?\r\n\r\nWas there no chance that after all he might be mistaken?  Alas! that\r\ncruel knife and the memory of that evening crushed out the hope.  What\r\ncould he do?  To do nothing would be simply adding his own crime to that\r\nof another.  If only the boy would confess voluntarily!  Could that have\r\npossibly been the object which brought him there that evening?  The last\r\ntime they had talked together, even in the midst of his contrition, he\r\nhad been strangely reserved about something in the past.  Might not this\r\nbe the very secret he had now come to confide?\r\n\r\n"How have you been getting on the last week?" he asked, gravely.  "Have\r\nyou been able to keep pretty straight?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hope so," said Wyndham.  "You see, this cricket doesn\'t give a\r\nfellow much chance of going wrong."\r\n\r\n"No; but of course one needs to do more than merely not go wrong," said\r\nthe captain.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose when any of us _has_ done wrong we ought to try to make up\r\nfor it somehow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course," said Wyndham, feeling a little uncomfortable.\r\n"The worst of it is, you can\'t always do that except by keeping right in\r\nfuture."\r\n\r\n"Supposing you had owed some fellow a sovereign last term, you would\r\nconsider that all you had to do was not to owe him any more this term?"\r\nsaid Riddell.\r\n\r\n"No; of course not!  I\'d have to pay him, I know," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Well, what I mean," said the captain, "is that--that--why, the fact is,\r\nWyndham," said he, "I\'m afraid you have still some old scores you ought\r\nto clear up."\r\n\r\nWyndham looked hard at the captain, and coloured.\r\n\r\n"I see what you mean," he said, in a low voice.  "I know you\'re right.\r\nI wish I could do it."\r\n\r\n"You wish!" exclaimed Riddell.  "Wishing will not do it."\r\n\r\nWyndham looked hard at him once more, and answered, in agitated tones.\r\n\r\n"I say, Riddell.  Do you know about it, then?"\r\n\r\n"I think I do."\r\n\r\nAt that moment a bell began to sound across the quadrangle.\r\n\r\n"That\'s lock-up; I must go!" exclaimed Wyndham, wildly.  "For goodness\'\r\nsake, don\'t tell any one, Riddell!  Oh what a fool I have been!"\r\n\r\nAnd next moment he was gone.\r\n\r\nRiddell continued to pace the room, half stupefied with bewilderment and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake, don\'t tell any one!"  The cry rang in his ears till\r\nit drove him nearly mad.\r\n\r\nPoor Wyndham!  What must his state of mind be?  What must it have been\r\nall this time, with that miserable secret lurking there and poisoning\r\nhis whole life?  And yet the chance had been given him, and he had clung\r\nto the secret still, and in the face of discovery had no other cry than\r\nthis, "For goodness\' sake, don\'t tell any one!"\r\n\r\nThat evening, so jubilant all over Willoughby, was one of the most\r\nwretched Riddell ever spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nAN EXPLOSION OF "SKYROCKETS."\r\n\r\nParson, Bosher, King, and the other Parrett\'s juniors were in bad\r\nspirits.  It was not so much the Rockshire match that was preying on the\r\nbrotherhood, grievous as that blow had been.  Nor were they at the\r\npresent suffering under any particular infliction, or smarting under any\r\nspecial sense of injustice.  Their healths and digestions were all\r\ntolerably good, and the mutual friendship in which they had been wont to\r\nrejoice showed no signs of immediate dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, they didn\'t know exactly what was the matter with\r\nthemselves.  They could not pretend that it was remorse for the little\r\namount of work they had done during the term, for they stoutly denied\r\nthat they had done little.  On the contrary, they insisted that they\r\nwere being crammed to a shameful extent.\r\n\r\nNor was their conscience reproaching them for their past transgressions.\r\nOf course, they could not help admitting that they had occasionally got\r\ninto rows lately, but, as every one knew, it was never _their_ fault.\r\nIt had always been owing to some accident or piece of bad luck, and it\r\nwas quite enough to get punished for it, without being expected to\r\nreproach themselves for it.\r\n\r\nNo.  When they came to think of it they didn\'t see that they had\r\nanything to reproach themselves with.  On the whole, they were more to\r\nbe pitied than blamed.  They invariably meant well, but they never got\r\nany credit for their good intentions, while they were everlastingly\r\ngetting into trouble on account of their ill-luck!\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter was, these virtuous young gentlemen were\r\nsuffering from that most painful of maladies--dulness.\r\n\r\nThey had nothing to do--that is, they had nothing to do but work and\r\nplay cricket.  The latter was all very well, but even cricket, when it\r\nmeans three practices a day presided over by a strict senior, gets to be\r\na little wearisome.\r\n\r\nAs for the work--they groaned as they thought of it.  It hadn\'t been so\r\nbad at the beginning of the term, when Bosher\'s crib to the Caesar and\r\nWakefield\'s key to Colenso\'s arithmetic had lent them their genial aid.\r\nBut ever since Mr Parrett, in the vindictiveness of his heart, had\r\nsuddenly started Eutropius in the place of Caesar, and Todhunter in the\r\nplace of Colenso, life had barely been worth living.\r\n\r\nIt was this last grievance which was the special topic of discussion at\r\nan informal tea-party held, about a week after the Rockshire match, in\r\nParson\'s study.\r\n\r\nThe company solaced their wounded feelings with unlimited bloater-paste\r\nand red-currant jam, and under the soothing influence of these\r\ncondiments, aided by the watery contents of Parson\'s teapot, their\r\nsorrows found relief in words.\r\n\r\n"I bet anything he pitched on Eutropius," said Parson, with his cup to\r\nhis lips, "because he knows nobody ever wrote a crib to him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose any one could make him out enough," said King.  "It\'s\r\nawful rot."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and Ashley says it\'s awfully bad Latin."\r\n\r\nParson laughed satirically.\r\n\r\n"Jolly lot they care what sort of Latin it is as long as they can do us\r\nover it."\r\n\r\n"I believe," said Bosher, "Gilks has a key to Todhunter."\r\n\r\n"He has?  Young Telson had better collar it, then," said King, whose\r\nopinions on the laws of property as regarded cribs were lax.\r\n\r\n"Bah!  What\'s the use of bothering?" cried Parson, pouring himself out\r\nhis eighth cup of tea.  "If he pulls me up for not doing the beastly\r\nthings I shall tell him they\'re too hard, straight out."\r\n\r\n"Tell him it\'s jolly gross conduct," cried a voice at the door, followed\r\nimmediately by Telson, who, contrary to all rules, had slipped across to\r\npay a friendly visit.\r\n\r\nHe was welcomed with the usual rejoicing, and duly installed at the\r\nfestive board.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right if I am caught," said he.  "Gilks sent me a message to\r\nWibberly, and I just dropped in here on the way.  I say, who\'s going to\r\nlick, you or Welch\'s?"\r\n\r\n"Welch\'s!" exclaimed the company, in general contempt.  "It\'s like their\r\ncheek to challenge us.  We mean to give them a lesson."\r\n\r\n"Mind you do," said Telson, "or it\'ll be jolly rough on Parrett\'s.  No\r\nend of a poor show you made at the Rockshire."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Telson," said Parson, gravely, "suppose we don\'t talk about\r\nthat.  We were just wondering if Gilks had got a key to Todhunter\r\nsomewhere."\r\n\r\nTelson laughed.\r\n\r\n"Wonder if he hadn\'t!  He\'s got more cribs than school books, I think."\r\n\r\n"I say," said King, most persuasively, "could you collar it, do you\r\nthink, old man!"\r\n\r\n"Eh?  No," said Telson; "I draw the line at that sort of thing, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said King, evidently in a state of desperate mental\r\nagitation, "could you ever find out the answer for Number 13 in Exercise\r\n8, and let me know it in the morning?  I\'d be awfully obliged."\r\n\r\nTelson said he would see, whereat King was most profuse in his\r\ngratitude, and Telson received several other commissions of a similar\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThese little matters of business being satisfactorily settled, the\r\ncompany proceeded to the discussion of more general topics.\r\n\r\n"Fearful slow term this," said Parson, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Telson, spreading a piece of bread with about a quarter-of-\r\nan-inch layer of jam; "we\'re somehow done out of everything this term."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  We can\'t go out on the river; we can\'t go into town; we can\'t go\r\nand have a lark in Welch\'s; you can\'t come over to see us--"\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s a howling shame!" said Telson.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t do anything, in fact," continued Parson (now at cup Number 9).\r\n"Why, we haven\'t had a spree for weeks."\r\n\r\n"You seemed to think my diary was a spree," said Bosher, meekly.\r\n\r\nThere was a general laugh at this.\r\n\r\n"By the way, have you got it here?"\r\n\r\n"No fear!  I\'ll take good care you don\'t see it again, you cads!"\r\n\r\n"Eh?  By the way, that reminds me we never paid Bosher out for being a\r\nRadical, you fellows," said Parson.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no--oh, yes, you did!" cried Bosher.  "I apologise, you fellows.\r\nI\'ll let you see the diary, you know, some day.  Really, I\'m not a\r\nRadical."\r\n\r\nFortunately for Bosher, the political excitement at Willoughby had quite\r\nworn away, so that no one now felt it his duty to execute the sentence\r\nof the law upon him and, after being made to apologise on his knees to\r\neach of the company in turn, he was solemnly let off.\r\n\r\n"You see," said Parson, returning to the point, "we\'ve been up before\r\nParrett twice this term; that\'s the mischief.  We might have chanced a\r\nspree of some sort, only if we get pulled up again he may expel us."\r\n\r\nThere was some force in this argument, and it was generally agreed it\r\nwould be better for Willoughby that the risk of a calamity like this\r\nshould not be incurred.\r\n\r\n"Fact is," said Telson, cutting another slice of bread, "Willoughby\'s\r\ngoing to the dogs as hard as it can.  The seniors in our house are down\r\non you if you do anything.  I even got pulled up the other day for\r\nhaving a duel with young Payne with elastics.  Awful spree it was!  We\r\ngave one another six yards, and six shots each.  I got on to his face\r\nfour times, and once on his ear, and he only hit me twice.  One of mine\r\nwas right in his eye, and there was a shindy made, and I got sixty lines\r\nfrom Fairbairn."\r\n\r\n"What a frightful shame!" cried the company.  "Yes," said King; "and\r\nit\'s just as bad here.  The new monitors pull you up for everything.\r\nYou can\'t even chuck boots about in the passage but they are down on\r\nyou.  It was bad enough when Game and that lot were monitors, but ever\r\nsince they\'ve been turned out and the new chaps stuck in it\'s worse."\r\n\r\n"And they say it\'s just as bad in Welch\'s," said Wakefield.  "You know,"\r\nsaid Parson, profoundly, pouring himself out a fresh cup--"you know, if\r\nRiddell and Bloomfield ever took it into their heads to pull together,\r\nwe\'d have an awful time of it."\r\n\r\nThe bare possibility of such a calamity was enough to sober even the\r\nwildest spirit present.\r\n\r\n"These seniors are a nuisance," said Telson, after a pause; "and the\r\nworst of it is, we can\'t well pay them out."\r\n\r\n"Not in school, or in the Big either," said King.  "We might stick\r\nnettles in their beds, you know," suggested Bosher, "or something of\r\nthat sort."\r\n\r\n"Rather low, that," said Parson, "and not much fun."\r\n\r\n"Would leeches be better?" said Bosher, who had lately been giving\r\nhimself to scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nIt was considered leeches might not be bad, but there was rather too\r\nmuch uncertainty about their mode of action.  That was a sort of thing\r\nmore in Cusack\'s and the Welchers\' line than the present company\'s.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what," said Telson, struck with an idea, "we might get at\r\nthem in Parliament; they\'re always so jolly fond of talking about fair\r\nplay there, and every one being equal.  Do you know, I think we might\r\nhave a little fling there!"\r\n\r\n"Not at all a bad idea," said Parson, admiringly--"jolly fine idea!  We\r\ncan do what those cads do in the newspapers--obstruct the business!\r\nRattling idea!"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and fancy Messrs. Telson, Parson, Bosher, and Co. being\r\nsuspended," said King.\r\n\r\n"They couldn\'t do it, I tell you," said Bosher; "we\'d kick up a shine\r\nabout freedom of speech, and all that.  Anyhow, it would be rather a\r\nspree, whether we were kicked out or not.  We\'d be a `party\' you know!"\r\n\r\nThe idea took, and an animated consultation took place.  Parson, for a\r\njunior, was very well up in the "rules of the House," and at his\r\nsuggestion the notice-paper for to-morrow\'s assembly was got hold of and\r\nfilled with "amendments."\r\n\r\n"Call them amendments," said he, "and they can\'t say anything."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all serene," said Telson, who had implicit confidence in his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"For instance, here you are," said Parson.  "`Mr Coates to move that\r\nClassics is a nobler study than Mathematics.\'  Amendment proposed:\r\n`Instead of "nobler" say "viler."\'  Proposed by Bosher, further\r\namendment: `Instead of "nobler" say "beastlier."\'  Proposed by\r\nTelson--(`Hear, hear,\' from Telson)--further amendment: `Instead of\r\n"nobler" say "more idiotic."\'  You see it can easily be worked, and when\r\nwe\'ve done with `nobler\' we can start on the `is\' and amend it to `are,\'\r\ndo you twig?  There\'ll have to be a division over each.  I say it\'ll be\r\nan awful lark!"\r\n\r\nLittle dreaming of the delightful treat in store for it, Willoughby\r\nassembled next afternoon, expecting nothing better than a dull debate on\r\nthe well-worn question of classics _versus_ mathematics.  They were\r\ndestined to experience more than one surprise before the meeting was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nRiddell, who had spent a dismal day, not knowing what to do or think,\r\nand vainly hoping that Wyndham might by his own free confession solve\r\nthe bitter problem, came to the meeting.  It was the least wretched\r\nthing he could do.  Anything was better than sitting alone and brooding\r\nover his secret.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he received a cheer as he entered and took his\r\naccustomed place.  Willoughby was grateful to him for that catch in the\r\nRockshire match.  How, at any other time, the captain would have\r\nrejoiced over that cheer!  But now he hardly heard it.\r\n\r\nAll the other heroes of the match received a similar ovation in\r\nproportion to the service they had done, and when, just at the last\r\nmoment, Fairbairn, Coates, and Crossfield came in together, the "House"\r\nrose at them and cheered tremendously.\r\n\r\nThe business was preceded by the usual questions, none of which,\r\nhowever, were very important.  After the captain\'s performance last\r\nweek, and perhaps still more after his speech in the House a week or two\r\nago, honourable men had shown themselves less active in "baiting" him\r\nand asking him offensive questions, and on this occasion he was only\r\ninterrogated once, and that was by Cusack, who wanted to know whether\r\nthey were not going to get a whole holiday in honour of the Rockshire\r\nmatch?  The captain replied that he had heard nothing about it.\r\n\r\nBosher was put up to ask Bloomfield whether he considered Eutropius fit\r\nreading for young boys?  Loud cheers from all the small boys in question\r\ngreeted the inquiry, in the midst of which Bloomfield cunningly replied\r\nthat the honourable member had better give notice of the question for\r\nnext time.\r\n\r\nThen rose Telson, with all the dignity of office, and solemnly inquired\r\nof Mr Stutter, the Premier, whether he was aware that a new party had\r\nlately been formed in the House, consisting of Messrs. Telson, Parson,\r\nBosher, King, and Wakefield, called the "Skyrockets," whose object was\r\nto look after the interests of the juniors all over the school, and who\r\nwould be glad to receive fresh members at one shilling a head?\r\n\r\nStutter, who was scarcely heard in the uproar which followed this\r\nsensational announcement, meekly replied that he had not heard a word\r\nabout it, an answer which, for some reason or other, provoked almost as\r\nmuch laughter as the question.\r\n\r\n"All very well for them to grin," growled Telson, who had expected a\r\nsomewhat different reception to his important question: "wait till we\r\nstart on the amendments."\r\n\r\nThe opportunity soon arrived.  Coates being called upon to open the\r\ndebate, let off the speech he had prepared, and if he did not convince\r\nthe House that classics was a nobler study than mathematics, he at least\r\nshowed that he had convinced himself.\r\n\r\nThe "Skyrockets" had barely the patience to hear him out, and the moment\r\nhe had done, Parson started to his feet, and shouted, "Mr Chairman and\r\ngentlemen, I beg to move an amendment--"\r\n\r\nHere Bloomfield, whom the sight of the notice-paper had prepared for\r\nwhat was coming, interposed, "When I am ready for the honourable member\r\nI will call on him.  The motion is not yet seconded."\r\n\r\n"No, no!  That won\'t wash, will it, you fellows?" cried Parson,\r\nexcitedly, planting himself firmly in his place, and evidently seeing\r\nthrough the deep designs of the enemy.  "Bother seconding!  I mean to\r\nmove my amendment, if I stick here all night!  (Terrific Skyrocket\r\ncheers.)  We kids have been snubbed long enough, and we\'re going to make\r\na stand!"  ("Question," "Order.") "All very well for you to sing out\r\n`Order\'--"\r\n\r\nThe Chairman:\r\n\r\n"Will the honourable member--"\r\n\r\n"No, he won\'t!" screamed Parson, with the steam well up; "and he\'s not\r\ngoing to!  I\'ve got a right to be heard--we\'ve all got a right to be\r\nheard, and we\'re going to be heard, what\'s more!  (Tremendous cheers\r\nfrom the club.)  We\'re all equal here, aren\'t we, you chaps?"\r\n("Rather!")\r\n\r\nHere Fairbairn rose to order, but Parson was too quick for him.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" he cried, "we don\'t want any of your jaw!  We\'re not going to\r\nbe shut up by you!  We\'re a party, I tell you, and we\'re bound to stick\r\nout!"  ("Hear, hear," from Bosher.) "We expected you\'d be trying to sit\r\non us, but we made up our minds we won\'t be sat on!  (Prolonged cheers.)\r\nI\'ve not begun my speech yet--(laughter)--and I don\'t mean to till you\r\nhold your rows!"\r\n\r\nHere there were loud cries of "Order" from various parts of the House,\r\nwhich, however, only served to inspirit the speaker, who proceeded at\r\nthe top of his voice, "It\'s no use your going on like that.  (I say, you\r\nchaps," added he, turning round to his companions, "back me up, I\'m\r\ngetting husky.)  You think we\'re a lot of fools--"\r\n\r\n("We\'re a lot of fools!" chimed in the chorus, by way of backing up\r\ntheir orator.)\r\n\r\n"But we\'re not as green as we look!"\r\n\r\n("Green as we look!")\r\n\r\n"You all seem to think it funny!"\r\n\r\n("Think it funny!")\r\n\r\n"But you needn\'t think you\'ll shut _us_ up!"\r\n\r\n("Shut us up!")\r\n\r\nHere another attempt was made on the part of the chairman to reduce the\r\nmeeting to order.  Above the laughter and cheering and hooting he cried\r\nat the top of his voice, "Unless you stop your foolery, Parson, I\'ll\r\nhave you turned out!"\r\n\r\n"Will you?  Who\'s going to stop my foolery?" yelled Parson.\r\n\r\n("Stop my foolery?") howled the chorus.\r\n\r\n"Try it on, that\'s all!  You don\'t think we funk you!"\r\n\r\n("We funk you!")\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose we don\'t know what we\'re doing?"\r\n\r\n("We don\'t know what we\'re doing?")\r\n\r\n"Look out, you fellows!  Hold on!"\r\n\r\nThis last remark was caused by a rush upon the devoted band, with a view\r\nto carry out the edict of the chairman.\r\n\r\nParson went on with his oration till he was secured, hand and foot, and\r\ncarried forcibly to the door, and even then continued to address the\r\nhouse, struggling and kicking between every syllable.  His backers,\r\nequally determined, clung on to the forms and desks, and continued to\r\nshout and scream and caterwaul till they were one by one ejected.\r\n\r\nEven then they maintained their noble stand for freedom of speech by\r\nhowling through the key-hole and kicking at the door, till finally a\r\nselect band of volunteers was dispatched "to clear the approaches to the\r\nHouse" and drive the Skyrockets to their own distant studies, where they\r\norganised a few brawls on their own account, and ended the afternoon\r\nvery hoarse, very tired, but by no means cast down.\r\n\r\n"Jolly spree, wasn\'t it?" said Parson, when it was all over, fanning\r\nhimself with a copybook and readjusting his collar.\r\n\r\n"Stunning!" said Telson; "never thought they\'d stand it so long.  No end\r\nof a speech, that of yours!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Parson, complacently; "most of it impromptu, too!  Managed\r\nto spin it out, I fancy!"\r\n\r\n"Rather," said King, admiringly.  "I began to make mine after you\'d got\r\nkicked out, but couldn\'t get out much of it."\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is it was a jolly lark.  I feel quite hungry after\r\nit," said Telson.  "Any of that jam left, old man?"\r\n\r\nAnd so these heroes appropriately celebrated their glorious field-day\r\nwith a no less glorious banquet, which amply compensated for all the\r\nlittle inconveniences they had had to endure in the course of the\r\nafternoon\'s entertainment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, rather more serious work was going on in the Great Hall.\r\n\r\nThe Skyrockets being ejected, the house proceeded in a somewhat humdrum\r\nfashion to discuss the relative merits of classics and mathematics.\r\nSeveral of the seniors and a few Limpets had prepared speeches, which\r\nthey duly delivered.  Contrary to the expectation of most present,\r\nRiddell took no part in the discussion.  As head classic, a speech from\r\nhim had been quite counted on; but not even the calls of the one side or\r\nthe taunts of the other could get him on to his feet.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, he only half heard what was going on.  His thoughts were\r\nfar away, busied with a far more serious inward debate than that on the\r\nnotice-paper.\r\n\r\nAt length he could remain idle no longer.  He must go and find out\r\nWyndham, or see the doctor, or pay another visit to Tom the boat-boy--\r\nanything rather than this suspense and misery and inaction.\r\n\r\nHe took advantage of a more than ordinarily dreary speech from Tedbury\r\nto rise and make his retreat quietly from the room.\r\n\r\nBut before he had reached the door Tedbury\'s voice abruptly ceased and\r\nWibberly\'s was heard saying, "Mr Chairman, I see Mr Riddell is leaving\r\nthe meeting.  Will you allow me to ask him a question before he goes?"\r\n\r\nThere was something strange about this interruption, and also in the\r\nmanner in which the question was asked, which drew the sudden attention\r\nof the House, and all eyes were turned on the captain.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and turned in his usual nervous, half-inquiring way,\r\napparently not quite sure what had been said or who had spoken.\r\n\r\n"Mr Wibberly," said Bloomfield, "wishes to ask a question of Mr\r\nRiddell."\r\n\r\n"It is merely this," said Wibberly, rapidly, and giving no time for any\r\nobjection to be raised on the point of order.  "I wish to ask Mr\r\nRiddell whether he has found out yet who cut the rudder-line of\r\nParrett\'s boat at the boat-race, or whether he suspects anybody, and, if\r\nso, whom?"\r\n\r\nAt this unlooked-for question a hubbub immediately arose.  Several\r\nschoolhouse fellows protested against the proceedings being interrupted\r\nin this way, and even Bloomfield exclaimed across the table, "For\r\ngoodness\' sake, Wibberly, don\'t bring up that wretched subject again."\r\n\r\nBut those who had watched Riddell had seen him turn suddenly pale at the\r\nquestion, and for a moment make as though he would rush from the room.\r\nBut he stopped himself, and turned like a hunted deer on the questioner.\r\n\r\nA dead silence fell on the assembly, as Wibberly coolly said, "I will\r\nrepeat the questions.  Has Mr Riddell found out who cut the rudder-\r\nlines? or does he suspect any one? and, if so, who is it?"\r\n\r\nEvery eye turned on Riddell.  The brief pause had given him time to\r\ncollect himself and fight out the inward battle; and now he answered\r\nsteadily, "I do suspect some one.  But until I am perfectly sure I shall\r\nnot say who it is."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he quietly left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nEVERYTHING GONE WRONG.\r\n\r\nRiddell was fairly committed to his task now.  Like the good old general\r\nwho burned his ships when he landed on the enemy\'s shores, he had cut\r\noff from himself the slightest possibility of a retreat, and must now\r\neither go right through with the matter or confess himself a miserable\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nThe consciousness of this nerved him with unlooked-for courage, and he\r\nwalked from the Parliament that afternoon a very different being from\r\nthe boy who had entered it.  He had entered it cowed, irresolute,\r\nwretched; he left it indeed still wretched, but with his spirit roused\r\nand his mind made up.  His duty lay clear before him, and whatever it\r\ncost he must do it.\r\n\r\nWhether Wibberly was himself the writer of the mysterious letter, or\r\nwhether some one had prompted him to ask the question, or whether his\r\nasking it just at this time was a mere coincidence, he did not trouble\r\nto decide.\r\n\r\nHe felt rather grateful to him than otherwise for having asked it, just\r\nas one is occasionally grateful to the thunder-clap for clearing the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe first thing without doubt was to find Wyndham, and come to a clear\r\nunderstanding as to whether or not he was the culprit; and the captain\r\nlost no time in attempting to put this resolve into practice.\r\n\r\nIt would not do, he knew, immediately after the scene in the Parliament,\r\nwhen everybody would be on the tip-toe of curiosity, to be seen holding\r\na secret interview with any particular boy.  He therefore decided wisely\r\nto wait till the usual time when Wyndham was in the habit of coming to\r\nhis study to do his lessons.  Meanwhile, to make sure of his coming, he\r\nsent him a message by Cusack to tell him to be sure and turn up.\r\n\r\nCusack, little suspecting the importance of this simple message,\r\ndelivered it glibly, and being of course brimful of the excitement of\r\nthe hour, he remained a little to regale Wyndham with a history of the\r\nafternoon\'s events.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say," said he, "you weren\'t at Parliament this afternoon.  There\r\nwas no end of a shine on."\r\n\r\n"Was there?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Rather.  What do you think, those young Parrett\'s cads came down in a\r\nbody and kicked up the biggest row you ever saw--said they were a club,\r\nand made no end of beasts of themselves, and got kicked out at last, and\r\nserve them right too."\r\n\r\n"They\'re always fooling about at something," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"That they are.  They want a good taking down, and we mean to do it next\r\nweek in the junior house match."\r\n\r\n"Ah," said Wyndham, who amid all his recent troubles could never forget\r\nthat he was a second-eleven man.  "Ah, I heard the juniors\' match was to\r\ncome off.  What day is it to be?"\r\n\r\n"Thursday."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must come and have a look at you.  Is Welch\'s going to win?"\r\n\r\n"Going to try, and I fancy we\'re pretty fair.  They\'ve been lazy, you\r\nknow, in Parrett\'s, and so we get a pull there.  Oh, but I was saving\r\nthat row with the kids wasn\'t all this afternoon.  Just at the end that\r\ncad Wibberly got up and asked Riddell some more about the boat-race--\r\nthey\'re always hammering away at that, and what do you think Riddell\r\nsaid--guess!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," said Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Why he said he knew who the chap was who had cut the strings, or\r\nfancied he did!"\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" exclaimed Wyndham, excitedly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he won\'t say.  And of course there\'s an awful row on.  They\r\nsay they\'ll make him tell, or kick him out of the school or something.\r\nThey\'re in no end of a rage."\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t he tell who it is?" asked Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he says he\'s not sure, or something like that.  But I dare say\r\nhe\'ll tell you all about it this evening.  You\'re to be sure and turn\r\nup, he says, at preparation time."\r\n\r\nAnd off went this vivacious messenger, leaving Wyndham in a considerable\r\nstate of astonishment and perturbation.\r\n\r\nWhat did Riddell want him for?  He had not seen him since that evening,\r\na week ago, when he had so nearly confessed to him about Beamish\'s.  He\r\nhardly liked not to go now, although he knew it would be hard to avoid\r\nletting out the wretched secret which he had promised Gilks and Silk to\r\nkeep.\r\n\r\nBesides, uneasy as he was about this, he could not help feeling excited\r\nabout what Cusack had just told him of the boat-race affair.  And most\r\nlikely, when he came to consider, Riddell would be so full of that that\r\nhe might perhaps not say any more about Beamish\'s.  So Wyndham decided\r\nto go, and in due time presented himself with his books at the captain\'s\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nHe could see at once that Riddell was in one of his serious moods, and\r\nhis heart sank, for he had no doubt what was coming, and felt that,\r\nunless he were to break his promise, matters were sure to be made worse.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve come," said Riddell; "you went off so suddenly the\r\nother evening."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Wyndham; "the lock-up bell rang, and I was bound to be in my\r\nhouse before it stopped."\r\n\r\n"You know what I want to see you about now, Wyndham?" said the captain,\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied the boy, doggedly; "I suppose I do."\r\n\r\nThere was a long, uncomfortable pause, at the end of which Riddell said,\r\n"Surely, Wyndham, you are not going to leave it to me to clear up this\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked the boy, burying his face in his hands, and\r\nutterly unnerved by the tones of his friend\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"I mean this," said Riddell, as firmly as he could, "that there are only\r\ntwo courses open.  Either you must confess what you have done, of your\r\nown accord, or it will be my duty to do it for you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how it\'s your duty to tell everybody," said the boy.  "I\r\nshould get expelled to a dead certainty!"\r\n\r\n"It must either be one or the other," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Riddell!" exclaimed the boy, springing to his feet, "don\'t say\r\nthat!  I know I\'ve been a cad, and let myself be led into it; but surely\r\nit\'s not so bad as all that!  You\'ve always been a brick to me, I know,\r\nand I\'ve not been half grateful enough.  But do let us off this time!\r\nplease do!  I can\'t tell you anything; I would gladly, only I\'ve\r\npromised.  You wouldn\'t have me break my promise?  If you tell of me I\r\nshall be expelled I know I shall!  Do help me out this time!"\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said Riddell, who was not proof against this sort of\r\nappeal from any one, least of all from one he loved.\r\n\r\nThe boy was quick in the energy of his despair to follow up his\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n"I\'d make it good any other way--any way you like--but don\'t have me\r\nexpelled, Riddell.  Think of them all at home, what a state they would\r\nbe in!  I know I deserve it; but can\'t you get me out of it?"\r\n\r\n"If you were to go to the doctor and tell him everything--" began\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s just what I can\'t do!" exclaimed Wyndham.  "I\'d do it like a\r\nshot if it was only myself in it.  I don\'t know how you found it all\r\nout, I\'m sure; but I can\'t go and tell the doctor, even if it was to get\r\nme off being expelled."\r\n\r\nIt was no use going on like this.  Riddell was getting unmanned every\r\nmoment, and Wyndham by these wild appeals was only prolonging the agony.\r\n\r\n"Wyndham, old fellow," said the captain, in tones full of sympathy and\r\npity, "if I had dreamt all this was to happen I would never have come to\r\nWilloughby at all.  I know what troubles you have had this term, and how\r\nbravely you have been trying to turn over a new leaf.  I\'d give anything\r\nto be able to help you out of this, but I tell you plainly I don\'t see\r\nhow to do it.  If you like, I\'ll go with you to the doctor, and--"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" exclaimed Wyndham, wildly, "I can\'t do that!  I can\'t do\r\nthat!"\r\n\r\n"Then," said Riddell, gravely, "I must go to him by myself."\r\n\r\nWyndham looked up and tried to speak, and then fairly broke down.\r\n\r\n"If the honour of the whole school were not involved--"\r\n\r\nWyndham looked up in a startled way.  "The honour of the school?  What\r\nhas it got to do with my going to--"\r\n\r\nWhat strange fatality was there about Riddell\'s study-door that it\r\nalways opened at the most inopportune times?\r\n\r\nJust as Wyndham began to speak it opened again, and Bloomfield, of all\r\npersons, appeared.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to you, Riddell," he said.\r\n\r\nThe words were uttered before he had noticed that the captain was not\r\nalone, or that his visitor was young Wyndham, in a state of great\r\ndistress--hardly greater than that of Riddell himself.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he did perceive it he drew back, and said, "I beg your\r\npardon; I didn\'t know any one was here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go," said Wyndham, hurriedly, going to the door, and hardly\r\nlifting his eyes from the ground as he passed.\r\n\r\nBloomfield could hardly help noticing his strange appearance, or\r\nwondering at it.\r\n\r\n"Anything wrong with young Wyndham?" said he, not sorry to have some way\r\nof breaking the ice.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in trouble," said the captain.  "Won\'t you sit down?"\r\n\r\nIt was a very long time since the head of Parrett\'s and the captain of\r\nthe school had met in this polite way.  But Bloomfield for some time\r\npast had shown signs of coming round to see that the position which had\r\nbeen forced upon him, and which he had been very ready at first to\r\naccept, was not a satisfactory one.  And, greatly to the disgust of some\r\nof his fellow-monitors, he had shown this more than once by friendly\r\nadvances towards his rival.  But, so far, he had never got to the length\r\nof calling upon him in his study.\r\n\r\nRiddell was scarcely surprised to see him, although he was quite\r\nunprepared for the very amicable way in which he began.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to interrupt you," said Bloomfield, "but I\'ve been intending\r\nto come over the last day or two."\r\n\r\n"It\'s very good of you," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said Bloomfield, a little nervously, "ever since that\r\ndebate in Parliament some weeks ago, when you spoke about all pulling\r\ntogether, I\'ve felt that our fellows haven\'t done as much as they ought\r\nin that way--I know I haven\'t."\r\n\r\nRiddell did not exactly know what to say.  He could not say that the\r\nParrett\'s fellows _had_ "pulled together" for the good of the school, so\r\nhe said nothing.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting rather sick of it," continued Bloomfield, digging his hands\r\nin his pockets.\r\n\r\n"So am I," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Bloomfield, "it was that wretched boat-race affair\r\nwhich made things as bad as they were.  Our fellows wouldn\'t have kept\r\nit up so long if that hadn\'t happened."\r\n\r\nRiddell began to get more and more uneasy.  He had expected this was\r\ncoming, and there was no escaping it.\r\n\r\n"It was an awfully ugly business, of course," continued Bloomfield; "and\r\nthough no one suspected fellows like you and Fairbairn of such a thing,\r\nour fellows, you know, were pretty sure some one was at the bottom of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nRiddell could not help thinking, in the midst of his uneasiness, how\r\nvery sagacious the Parrett\'s fellows had been to make the discovery!\r\n\r\n"And now," said Bloomfield, looking up, and feeling relieved to have his\r\nspeech nearly done--"now that you\'ve found out who it is, and it\'s all\r\ngoing to be cleared up, I think things ought to come all right."\r\n\r\nIt was a painful situation for the captain of Willoughby.  The bribe\r\nwhich Bloomfield offered for his secret was what had been the wish of\r\nhis heart the whole term.  If he accepted it now there would be an end\r\nto all the wretched squabbles which had worked such mischief in the\r\nschool the last few months, and the one object of his ambition as head\r\nof the school would be realised.\r\n\r\nSurely, now, he could hold back no longer.  His duty, his interest, the\r\nhonour of the school, all demanded his secret of him; whereas if he held\r\nit back things would be worse than ever before.  And yet he hesitated.\r\n\r\nThat last wild half-finished exclamation of Wyndham\'s lingered in his\r\nmind and perplexed him.  Suppose there should be some mistake?  With\r\nthat knife in his pocket, and the poor boy\'s whole conduct and demeanour\r\nto corroborate its story, he could scarcely hope it.  But _suppose_\r\nthere was a doubt, or even the shadow of a doubt, what right had he to\r\naccuse him, or even to breathe his name?\r\n\r\n"I hope it will be cleared up before long," said he.\r\n\r\n"Why, you said you knew who it was!" said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I said I suspected somebody."\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" asked Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you," replied Riddell.  "I\'m not sure; I may be wrong."\r\n\r\n"But surely you\'re not going to keep a thing like this to yourself!"\r\nexclaimed Bloomfield, warmly; "it concerns everybody in the school.\r\nI\'ve a right, at any rate, as stroke of the Parrett\'s boat, to know who\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"Of course, you have; and if I was quite sure I was right I would tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"But you can tell me whom you suspect," said Bloomfield, who had not\r\nanticipated this difficulty.  "No, I cannot," replied the captain.  "In\r\nconfidence, at any rate," said Bloomfield.  "No, not till I am sure.  I\r\nreally cannot."\r\n\r\nBloomfield\'s manner changed.  This rebuff was not what he had expected.\r\nHe had come here partly out of curiosity partly from a desire to be\r\nfriendly, and partly owing to the eagerness of his companions to have an\r\nexplanation.  He had never doubted but that he would succeed; nay, even\r\nthat Riddell would be glad to meet him more than half-way.  But now it\r\nseemed this was not to be, and Bloomfield lost his temper.\r\n\r\n"You mean to say," said he, angrily, "you\'re going to keep it to\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, till I am sure."\r\n\r\n"Till you are sure!  What are you going to do to make it sure, I\'d like\r\nto know?"\r\n\r\n"Everything I can."\r\n\r\n"You know, I suppose, what everybody says about you and the whole\r\nconcern?" said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help what they say," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"They say that if you chose you could tell straight out like an\r\nhonest man who it is."\r\n\r\nRiddell looked quickly up at the speaker, and Bloomfield felt half\r\nashamed of the taunt directly it escaped his lips.\r\n\r\n"I say that\'s what the fellows think," said he, "and it\'s in your own\r\ninterest to clear yourself.  They think you are shielding some one."\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s face changed colour rapidly, and Bloomfield was quick\r\nenough to see it.\r\n\r\n"It\'s hardly what fellows had been led to expect of you," said he, with\r\na touch of sarcasm in his voice.  "Anyhow it knocks on the head any idea\r\nof our pulling together as I had hoped.  I certainly shall do nothing\r\ntowards it as long as this ugly business is going on."\r\n\r\n"Bloomfield, I\'ve told you--" began Riddell.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve told me a great deal," said Bloomfield, "but you can\'t deny that\r\nyou are sheltering the cad, whoever he is, under the pretext of not\r\nbeing quite sure."\r\n\r\nRiddell said nothing, and Bloomfield, seeing nothing could come of this\r\naltercation, left the room.\r\n\r\nAt the door, however, a thought struck him.  Could that agitated scene\r\nbetween Riddell and young Wyndham, which he had interrupted by his\r\narrival, have had anything to do with this mystery?\r\n\r\nHe recollected now what a state of distress both had been in; and, now\r\nhe thought of it, surely he had heard Wyndham\'s voice saying something\r\nin tones of very eager appeal at the moment the door was open.  Besides\r\nWyndham had been very "down" for a week past.  Bloomfield had noticed it\r\nat the cricket practices; and more than one fellow had spoken of it in\r\nhis hearing.  He knew too how thick the boy was with the captain, and\r\nwith what almost brotherly concern Riddell watched over all his\r\ninterests; every one in Willoughby knew it.\r\n\r\nBloomfield was only a moderately clever youth, but he knew enough to put\r\ntwo and two together; and, as he stood there at the door, the state of\r\nthe case flashed across his mind.  He might get at the secret after all!\r\n\r\n"You forget that other people can suspect besides you, Riddell," he\r\nsaid, turning back.  "Suppose I was to suspect that precious young\r\nfriend of yours who stood blubbering here just now?"\r\n\r\nIt was well for the captain that his back was turned as Bloomfield said\r\nthis, otherwise the least doubt as to the correctness of his guess would\r\nhave been instantly dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe last strait in which Riddell found himself was worse than any that\r\nhad gone before.  For he could not deny, and to say nothing would be the\r\nsame as assenting.  The secret was out, and what could he do?  The only\r\nthing seemed to be to appeal to Bloomfield\'s generosity, to explain all\r\nto him, and to implore him, for a day or two at least, to keep sacred\r\nthe confidence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet--it was the old question--suppose he were wrong, and suppose\r\nafter all Wyndham were not the culprit, what grievous wrong would he be\r\ndoing him by admitting even his suspicion!  He composed himself with an\r\neffort, and turning, replied, "Excuse me, Bloomfield, I\'ve told you I\r\ncan say nothing at present, and it is really useless to say any more\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\nBloomfield departed, perplexed and angry.  His anger was partly because\r\nhe could not help feeling that Riddell was in the right; and his\r\nperplexity was to know what to think of it all, and whether his guess\r\nabout young Wyndham was near the mark or not.\r\n\r\n"Well," inquired Game, who with one or two of the most ardent Parretts\r\nwas eagerly waiting his return.  "Have you got it out of him?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Bloomfield, "he won\'t tell me."\r\n\r\n"The cad!" exclaimed Game.  "Why ever not?"\r\n\r\n"He says he\'s not sure, that\'s why," said Bloomfield; "but it\'s my\r\nprivate opinion he\'s shielding some one or other."\r\n\r\n"Of course he is," said Ashley.  "I shouldn\'t wonder if he\'s known who\r\nit is all along."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said Tipper, "he ought to be made to clear it up, or else pay\r\nup for it.  I know I\'ll cut him dead next time I see him."\r\n\r\n"So shall we," replied one or two others.\r\n\r\n"He won\'t afflict himself much about that," said Bloomfield; "if I were\r\nsure he didn\'t want to shirk it I\'d be inclined to give him a day or two\r\nbefore doing anything."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?  Of course he wants to shirk it," said Game, "and\r\nthinks it will blow over if it goes long enough.  I\'ll take precious\r\ngood care it doesn\'t, though."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour," said Ashley, "I never expected Willoughby would _come_\r\nto this pass.  It was bad enough to have a coward and a fool as captain,\r\nbut it\'s rather too much when he turns out to be a cheat too!"\r\n\r\n"And to think that he ever got stuck in the first eleven," said Tipper.\r\n"I told you, Bloomfield, he\'d be no credit to you."\r\n\r\n"He caught out that best man of theirs," said Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Bah!  I\'d sooner have lost the match twice over," exclaimed Game, "than\r\nwin it with his help!"\r\n\r\nAnd so these estimable young gentlemen, satisfied that they alone were\r\nthe glory and support of Willoughby, disposed in their own minds of\r\ntheir wicked captain, and thanked their lucky stars they were made of\r\nnobler stuff and loftier principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nWYNDHAM MAKES A FINAL VENTURE.\r\n\r\nIf any proof had been needed that young Wyndham was "down," as the\r\nParrett\'s fellows termed it, the fact that he did not put in appearance\r\nat the second-eleven practice next day supplied it.\r\n\r\nBloomfield, who in ordinary course had strolled round to watch the play,\r\nnoticed his absence, and drew his own conclusions from it.\r\n\r\nTo Bloomfield\'s credit be it said that, whatever his own suspicions may\r\nhave been, he had been as reluctant as Riddell himself, as long as any\r\ndoubt existed, to name Wyndham publicly as the culprit for whom all\r\nWilloughby was on the lookout.  He had been very angry with Riddell for\r\nhis reserve, but when it came to the point of publishing his own\r\nsuspicions or not, his better feeling prevented him, and led him to copy\r\nthe captain\'s example.\r\n\r\nFor Riddell\'s reply to the suggestion of Wyndham\'s name had neither\r\nconfirmed or denied its correctness.  He had merely declined to say\r\nanything about the matter, so that as far as Bloomfield was concerned it\r\nwas no more than a guess, and that being so, he too was wise enough to\r\nkeep it to himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that he noticed Wyndham\'s unwonted absence from the cricket\r\npractice, he felt more than ever convinced something was wrong in that\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nAnd so there was.\r\n\r\nWyndham, with a drawn sword, so to speak, over his head, was fit for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nHe dared not go back to Riddell.  As long as his tongue was tied any\r\nexplanation was impossible, and unless he could explain, it was worse\r\nthan useless to talk to the captain.\r\n\r\nEqually out of the question was a confession to the doctor, or a letter\r\nexplaining all to his brother.  The only thing was either to make up his\r\nmind to his fate, or else, by getting Silk and Gilks to release him from\r\nhis promise, to get his tongue free to make a full confession of his own\r\ndelinquencies, and throw himself entirely on the doctor\'s mercy.\r\n\r\nThis last chance seemed feeble enough.  But a drowning man will clutch\r\nat a straw, and so Wyndham, as his last hope, faced the unpromising task\r\nof working on the generosity of his two old patrons.\r\n\r\nHe began with Gilks.  Gilks was in his own house, and had always seemed\r\nto be the least vicious, as he was also the least clever of the two.\r\nBesides, of late it was notorious Gilks and Silk were no longer the\r\nfriends they had been.  There was a mystery about their recent quarrel;\r\nbut as Gilks had been down in the mouth ever since, while Silk showed no\r\nsigns of dejection, it was safe to assume the former had come off second\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nWyndham therefore selected Gilks for his first attempt as being on the\r\nwhole the less formidable of the two.\r\n\r\nHe found him in his study listlessly turning over the pages of a novel,\r\nwhich evidently must either have been a very stupid one or else not\r\nnearly as engrossing as the reader\'s own reflections.\r\n\r\nHe looked up with some surprise to see Wyndham, who since he had\r\nsomewhat ostentatiously cut his and Silk\'s acquaintance some weeks ago,\r\nhad never been near him.\r\n\r\n"What do you want here?" he demanded, not very encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'ve not much reason to be friendly with me," began the boy,\r\n"but I want to speak to you, if I may."\r\n\r\n"What about?" said Gilks, roughly.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy seemed suddenly to realise the hopeless nature of the task\r\nhe had undertaken, and he nearly broke down completely as he answered,\r\n"I\'m in awful trouble, Gilks."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to do with me?" asked Gilks.\r\n\r\nWyndham struggled hard to shake off the weakness that had come over him,\r\nand replied, "It\'s about those visits to--to Beamish\'s.  They--that is,\r\nRiddell--I don\'t know how or who told him--but he seems to have found\r\nout about it."\r\n\r\n"Riddell!" cried Gilks, scornfully; "who cares for him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but," continued Wyndham, tremulously, "he means to report me for\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"What? report you?  I thought you and he were such dear pious friends,"\r\nsneered Gilks.\r\n\r\n"We are friends; but he says it is his duty to do it."\r\n\r\nGilks laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n"Of course, it is!  It only needs for a thing to be mean and low, and it\r\nwill always be his duty to do it.  Bah! the hypocrite!"\r\n\r\nWyndham was proof against this invective.  Nay, bitterly as the\r\ncaptain\'s sense of duty affected him, he could not help a passing\r\nfeeling of indignation on his friend\'s behalf at Gilk\'s words.\r\n\r\nBut he was prudent enough to keep his feelings to himself.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said he, "if he does report me for it, I shall be\r\nexpelled."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure of that," replied Gilks, "but what\'s all this got to do\r\nwith me?"\r\n\r\nWyndham looked up in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why," said he rather nervously.  "Of course you know, we, that is you\r\nand I and Silk, are all sort of in the same boat over this affair.  That\r\nis, if it all came out.  But I fancy Riddell only suspects me."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he does," said Gilks, "it\'s all the less any concern of mine."\r\n\r\n"I promised, you know," said Wyndham, "to you and Silk to say nothing\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Of course you did," said Gilks, "and you\'d better stick to it, or it\'ll\r\nbe the worse for you!"\r\n\r\n"I think," continued the boy, "and Riddell says so--if I were to go and\r\ntell the Doctor about it, only about myself, you know, he might perhaps\r\nnot expel me."\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Wyndham, "of course I couldn\'t do it after promising you\r\nand Silk.  But I thought if I promised not to say anything about you and\r\nmake out that it was all my fault, you wouldn\'t mind my telling Paddy."\r\n\r\nGilks looked at the boy in perplexity.  This was a code of morality\r\ndecidedly beyond him, and for a moment he looked as if he half doubted\r\nwhether it was not a jest.\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you mean, you young muff?" he exclaimed.  "I mean, may\r\nI go and tell him that I went those two times to Beamish\'s?  I promise\r\nto say nothing about you."  Gilks laughed once more.\r\n\r\n"What do I care what you go and tell him?" he said.  "If you want to get\r\nexpelled as badly as all that I don\'t want to prevent you, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Then I really may?" exclaimed poor Wyndham, scarcely believing his own\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"Of course, if you keep me out of it, what on earth do I care what you\r\ntell him?  You may tell him you murdered somebody there for all I care."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thanks, thanks," cried Wyndham with a positively beaming face.  "I\r\ngive you my word I won\'t even mention you or Silk."\r\n\r\n"As long as you don\'t mention me, that\'s all _I_ care for," said Gilks;\r\n"and upon my word," added he, with a sigh half to himself, "I don\'t much\r\ncare whether you do or not!"\r\n\r\nWyndham was too delighted and relieved to pay any heed to this last\r\ndreary remark, and gratefully took his leave, feeling that though the\r\nbattle was anything but won yet he was at least a good deal nearer hope\r\nthan he had been an hour ago.\r\n\r\nBut he very soon checked the reviving flow of his spirits as the\r\nprospect of an interview with Silk began to loom out ahead.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen Silk since the evening of the Rockshire match, when, as\r\nthe reader will remember the meeting was anything but a pleasant one,\r\nand, but for the timely arrival of a third party, might have ended\r\nseverely for the younger boy.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of this did not certainly add to the hopefulness of his\r\npresent undertaking; but young Wyndham was a boy of such a sanguine\r\ntemper, and such elastic spirits, that he could not help hoping\r\nsomething would turn up in his favour even now.  He had got on far\r\nbetter than he had dared to hope with Gilks, why not also with Silk?\r\n\r\nBesides, when all was said, it was his only chance, and therefore,\r\nwhether he hoped anything or nothing, he must try it.\r\n\r\nHe wandered about during the hour between first and second school with\r\nthe idea of coming across his man in the quadrangle or the playground.\r\nHe could not make up his mind to beard the lion in his den; indeed at\r\npresent he had every reason to fight shy of Welch\'s.\r\n\r\nSecond and third school passed before he was able to renew his search,\r\nand this time he was successful.\r\n\r\nJust as he was beginning to give up hope, and was meditating a show-up\r\nfor appearance\'s sake at the cricket practice, he caught sight of Silk\r\nlolling on a bench in a distant corner of the Big.\r\n\r\nHis heart sunk as he made the discovery, but it was no time for\r\nconsulting his inclinations.\r\n\r\nHe moved timidly over in the direction of the bench, taking care to\r\napproach it from behind, so as to be spared the discomfort of a long\r\ninspection on the way.\r\n\r\nSilk blissfully unconscious of the visit in store, was peacefully\r\nperforming a few simple addition sums on the back of an envelope, and\r\ncalculating how with six shillings he should be able to pay debts\r\namounting to twenty-six, when Wyndham\'s shadow suddenly presented itself\r\nbetween him and his figures and gave him quite a start.\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said he, in his usual friendly style, and to all appearances quite\r\nforgetful of the incidents of his last interview with this visitor.\r\n"Ah, Wyndham, so you\'ve come back?"\r\n\r\n"I wanted to see you very particularly," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Plenty of room on the seat," said Silk.\r\n\r\nWyndham, feeling far more uncomfortable at this civility than he had\r\ndone at Gilk\'s roughness, sat down.\r\n\r\n"Nice weather," said Silk, mockingly, after the pause had lasted some\r\nlittle time.\r\n\r\n"I want to ask you a favour--a great favour," said Wyndham, feeling that\r\na beginning must be made.\r\n\r\n"Very kind of you," replied Silk, going on with his sums, and whistling\r\nsoftly to himself.\r\n\r\nWyndham did not feel encouraged.  He had half a mind to back out of the\r\nventure even now, but desperation urged him on.\r\n\r\n"You know I promised you never to say a word about Beamish\'s," he\r\nfaltered, at length.\r\n\r\n"So you did," replied Silk, drily.\r\n\r\n"Would you mind letting me off that promise?"\r\n\r\n"What?" exclaimed Silk, putting down his paper and pencil and staring at\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"I mean only as far as I\'m concerned," said Wyndham, hurriedly, trying\r\nto avert a storm.\r\n\r\n"As far as you are concerned!  What on earth are you talking about?"\r\nexclaimed the other.\r\n\r\n"I want to confess to the doctor that I went those two times," said the\r\nboy.  "I wouldn\'t mention your name or Gilk\'s.  I only want to tell him\r\nabout myself."\r\n\r\n"Have you gone mad, or what?" cried Silk, utterly perplexed, as Gilks\r\nhad been, to understand the boy\'s meaning.\r\n\r\nWyndham explained to him as best he could how the matter stood.  How\r\nRiddell appeared to have discovered his delinquencies, and was resolved\r\nto report him.  Of the certain result of such an exposure, and of the\r\none hope he had, by voluntarily confessing all to the doctor, of\r\naverting his expulsion.\r\n\r\nSilk listened to it all with a sneer, and when it was done, replied,\r\n"And you mean to say you\'ve got the impudence to come to me to help to\r\nget you out of a scrape?"\r\n\r\n"Please, Silk," said the boy, "I would be so grateful."\r\n\r\n"Bah!" snarled Silk, "have you forgotten, then, the nice row you kicked\r\nup in my study a week ago? and the way you\'ve treated me all this term?\r\nbecause if you have, I haven\'t."\r\n\r\n"I know it\'s a lot to ask," pleaded the boy.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a precious lot too much," said Silk; "and no one who hadn\'t got\r\nyour cheek would do it!"\r\n\r\nAnd he took up his paper and pencil again, and turned his back on the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you do it, then?" once more urged Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Not likely!" rejoined Silk.  "If you want favours you\'d better go to\r\nyour precious friend Riddell; and you can go as soon as you like.  I\r\ndon\'t want you here!"\r\n\r\n"If you\'d only do it," said Wyndham, "I\'d--"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear what I say?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d never ask you for the money you borrowed," said the boy quickly.\r\n\r\nSilk laughed as he turned once more on his victim, and said, "Wouldn\'t\r\nyou really?  How awfully considerate!  Upon my word, the generosity of\r\nsome people is quite touching.  Let\'s see, how much was it?"\r\n\r\n"Thirty shillings," said Wyndham, "and the change out of the post-office\r\norder, two pounds."\r\n\r\n"Which makes," said Silk, putting the figures down on his paper, "three\r\npounds ten, doesn\'t it? and you think what you ask is worth three pounds\r\nten, do you?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s worth far more to me," said the boy, "because it\'s the only thing\r\ncan save me from being expelled."\r\n\r\nSilk mused a bit over his figures, and then replied, "And what would\r\nhappen if I didn\'t pay you back?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t say a word about it," cried the boy, eagerly, "if only you\'d\r\nlet me off the promise!"\r\n\r\n"And suppose I told you I consider the promise worth just double what\r\nyou do?"\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s face fell for a moment; he had not dared to write home about\r\nthe loss of his last pocket-money, and saw very little chance of raising\r\nthe wind for so large an amount again.  Yet it seemed his only hope.\r\n\r\n"Would that make it all right?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I might think about it," said Silk, with a sweet smile--"under\r\nconditions."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how I can manage it," said Wyndham; "but I\'ll try.  And\r\nyou won\'t mind, then, my going to the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"What! do you suppose I\'m fool enough to let you do it before I have the\r\nmoney?" exclaimed Silk.  "You must have a nice opinion of me!"\r\n\r\nIt was no use urging further; Wyndham saw he had got all he could hope\r\nfor.  It was little better than nothing, for before he could get the\r\nmoney--if he got it at all--the explosion might have come, and he would\r\nbe expelled.  If only Riddell, now, would wait a little longer!\r\n\r\nAs the thought crossed his mind he became aware that the captain was\r\nslowly approaching the bench on which he and Silk were sitting.  It was\r\nanything but pleasant for the boy, after all that had happened, to be\r\ndiscovered thus, in close companionship with the very fellow he had\r\npromised to avoid, and whom he had all along acknowledged to be the\r\ncause of his troubles.\r\n\r\nHis instinct was to spring from his place and either escape or meet\r\nRiddell.  But Silk saw the intention in time and forbade it.\r\n\r\n"No," said he, with a laugh; "don\'t run away as if you were ashamed of\r\nit.  Stay where you are; let him see you keep good company now and\r\nthen."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must go!" exclaimed the boy; "he\'ll think all sorts of things.\r\nHe\'ll think I\'m such a hypocrite after what I promised him.  Oh, do let\r\nme go!"\r\n\r\nHis agitation only increased the amusement of his tormentor, who, with a\r\nview to give the captain as vivid an impression as possible, laid his\r\nhand affectionately on the boy\'s arm and beamed most benignantly upon\r\nhim.  It was no use for Wyndham to resist.  After all, suspicious as it\r\nmight appear, he was doing nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, what _would_ Riddell think?\r\n\r\nThe captain was pacing the Big in a moody, abstracted manner, and at\r\nfirst appeared not to notice either the bench or its occupants.\r\nWyndham, as he sat and trembled in Silk\'s clutches, wildly hoped\r\nsomething might cause him to turn aside or back.  But no, he came\r\nstraight on, and in doing so suddenly caught sight of the two boys.\r\n\r\nHe started and flushed quickly, and for a moment it looked as if he were\r\ninclined to make a wild dash to rescue the younger boy from the\r\ncompanionship in which he found him.  But another glance changed that\r\nintention, if intention it had been.\r\n\r\nHis face fell, and he walked past with averted eyes, apparently\r\nrecognising neither boy, and paying no heed to Wyndham\'s feebly\r\nattempted salute.\r\n\r\nBefore he was out of hearing Silk broke into a loud laugh.  "Upon my\r\nword, it\'s as good as a play!" cried he.  "You did it splendidly, young\r\n\'un!  Looked as guilty as a dog, every bit!  He\'ll give you up for lost\r\nnow, with a vengeance!"\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s misery would have moved the pity of any one but Silk.  The new\r\nhopes which had risen within him had been cruelly dashed by this unhappy\r\naccident, and he felt no further care as to what happened to him.\r\nRiddell would have lost all faith in him now; he would appear little\r\nbetter than an ungrateful hypocrite and impostor.  The last motive for\r\nsparing him would be swept away, and--so the boy thought--the duty of\r\nreporting him would now become a satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe tore himself from the seat, and exclaimed, "Let me go, you brute!"\r\n\r\nSilk looked at him in astonishment; then, relapsing into a smile, said,\r\n"Oh, indeed! a brute, am I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are!"\r\n\r\n"And, let\'s see; I forget what the little favour was you wanted the\r\nbrute to do for you?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to do _no_ favour!" cried Wyndham, passionately.\r\n\r\n"No?  Not even to allow you to go to the doctor and tell him about\r\nBeamish\'s?"\r\n\r\n"No; not even that!  I wouldn\'t do it now.  He may now find out what he\r\nlikes."\r\n\r\n"It might interest him if I went and told him a few things about you?"\r\nsaid Silk.\r\n\r\n"Go! as soon as you like--and tell him anything you like," cried\r\nWyndham.  "I don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t even care to have back your three pound ten?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the boy, "not even if you ever thought of paying it back."\r\n\r\nSilk all this time had been growing furious.  The last thing he had\r\nexpected was that this boy, whom he supposed to be utterly in his power,\r\nshould thus rise in revolt and shake off every shred of his old\r\nallegiance.  But he found he had gone too far for once, and this last\r\ndefiant taunt of his late victim cut him to the quick.\r\n\r\nHe sprang from the seat and made a wild dash at the boy, but Wyndham was\r\ntoo quick for him, and escaped, leaving his adversary baffled as he had\r\nnever been before, and almost doubting whether he had not been and still\r\nwas dreaming.\r\n\r\nWyndham ran as fast as he could in the direction of the school, and\r\nwould have probably gone _on_ running till he reached his own study, had\r\nnot the sight of Riddell slowly going the same way ahead of him suddenly\r\nchecked his progress.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he almost ran over him before he perceived who it was.  For\r\nRiddell just at that moment had halted in his walk, and stooped to pick\r\nup a book that lay on the path.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Wyndham saw who it was, he swerved hurriedly in another\r\ndirection, and got to his destination by a roundabout way, feeling as he\r\nreached it about as miserable and hopeless as it was possible for a boy\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nA SELECT PARTY AT THE DOCTOR\'S.\r\n\r\nYoung Wyndham, had he only known what was in the captain\'s mind as he\r\nwalked that afternoon across the Big, would probably have thought twice\r\nbefore he went such a long way round to avoid him.\r\n\r\nSilk\'s little piece of pantomime had not had the effect the author\r\nintended.  In the quick glance which Riddell had given towards the bench\r\nand its occupants he had taken in pretty accurately the real state of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said he to himself; "he\'s surely in trouble enough\r\nwithout being laid hold of by that cad.  Silk thinks I shall fancy he\r\nhas captured my old favourite.  Let him!  But if he has captured him he\r\ndoesn\'t seem very sure of him, or he wouldn\'t hold him down on the seat\r\nlike that.  I wonder what brings them together here? and I wonder if I\r\nhad better go and interfere?  No, I think I won\'t just now."\r\n\r\nAnd so he walked on, troubled enough to be sure, but not concluding\r\nquite as much from what he saw as Wyndham feared or Silk hoped.\r\n\r\nAs he walked on fellows glared at him from a distance, and others\r\npassing closer cut him dead.  A few of the most ardent Parrett\'s juniors\r\ntook the liberty of hissing him and one ventured to call out, pointedly,\r\n"Who cut the rudder-lines?"\r\n\r\nRiddell, however, though he winced under these insults, took little\r\nnotice of them.  He was as determined as ever to wait the confirmation\r\nof his suspicions before he unmasked the culprit, and equally convinced\r\nthat duty and honour both demanded that he should lose not a moment in\r\ncoming to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of these reflections that the small book which\r\nWyndham had seen him pick up caught his eye.  He picked it up\r\nmechanically, and after noticing that it appeared to be a notebook, and\r\nhad no owner\'s name in the beginning, carried it with him, and forgot\r\nall about it till he reached his study.\r\n\r\nEven here it was some time before it again attracted his attention, as\r\nits importance was wholly eclipsed by the contents of a note which he\r\nfound lying on his table, and which ran as follows:\r\n\r\n"Dear Riddell,--Will you join us at tea this evening at seven?  I expect\r\nFairbairn and Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Yours faithfully,--\r\n\r\n"R.  Patrick."\r\n\r\nRiddell groaned.  Had he not had trouble, and humiliation, and misery\r\nenough?  What had he done to deserve this crowning torture?  Tea with\r\nthe Griffins!\r\n\r\nHe sat down and wrote, as in politeness bound, that he would have much\r\npleasure in accepting the doctor\'s kind invitation, and, sending the\r\nnote off by Cusack, resigned himself to the awful prospect, which for a\r\ntime shut out everything else.\r\n\r\nHowever, he had no right, he felt, to be idle.  He must finish his work\r\nnow, so as to be free for the evening\'s "entertainment," and for the\r\nother equally grave duties which lay before him.\r\n\r\nBut somehow he could not work; his mind was too full to be able to\r\nsettle steadily on any one thing, and finally he pushed away the books\r\nand gave up the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt was at that moment that the small black book he had found caught his\r\neye.\r\n\r\nHe took it up, intending, if possible, to ascertain whose property it\r\nwas, and, failing that, to send Cusack to "cry" it round the school.\r\n\r\nBut the first thing that met his eye on the front page roused his\r\ncuriosity.  It was evidently a quotation:\r\n\r\n  "Pass me not, oh! reader, by,\r\n  Read my pages tenderly (`tenderly\' altered to `on the sly\');\r\n  All that\'s writ is writ for thee,\r\n  Open now and you shall see."\r\n\r\nAfter such a cordial invitation, even Riddell could hardly feel much\r\nqualm about dipping farther into this mysterious manuscript.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a diary, which, but for the announcement at the\r\nbeginning, one would have been inclined to regard as a private document.\r\nAnd the first entry Riddell encountered was certainly of that\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n"Friday, the fifth day of the week.--My birthday.  Rose at 6:591/2.  I am\r\nold.  I am 24 (and ten off) some one had taken my soap.  Meditations As\r\nI dressed me.  The world is very large I am small in the world I will\r\naspire as I go to chapel I view Riddell who toucheth his hat.  Gross\r\nconduct of my father sending me only half a crown breakfast at 7:33.\r\nDisturbance with the evil Telson whereby I obtained lines."\r\n\r\nThis was quite enough for one day, and Riddell, greatly mystified,\r\nturned a few pages farther on to see if the narrative became more lucid\r\nas it progressed.\r\n\r\n"I am now a skyrocket.  Meditations on being a skyrocket.  The world is\r\nvery large, etcetera.  Gross meeting of Parliament Riddell the little\r\ncaptain sitteth on his seat.  I made a noble speech gross conduct of\r\nParson, who is kicked out.  Eloquence of Bloomfield who crieth Order\r\nunder the form I see Telson hanging on.  I hang too and am removed\r\nspeaking nobly.  Large tea at Parson\'s the cake being beastly.  Riddell\r\nit seems hath cut the rudder-lines.  I indignate and cut him with a\r\nrazor I remove two corns from my nether foot."\r\n\r\nMore in this strain followed, and lower down the diary proceeded:\r\n\r\n"Wyndham the junior thinketh much of himself he is ugly in the face and\r\nin the second-eleven.  I have writ a poem on Wyndham.\r\n\r\n  "`I do not like thee, Dr Fell (altered to "Wyndham junior")\r\n  The reason why I cannot tell (altered to "say");\r\n  But this I know, and know full well (altered to "ill")\r\n  I do not like thee, Dr Fell (altered to "Wyndham junior").\'\r\n\r\n"I over hear much of Wyndham the gross Telson and the evil Parson not\r\nknowing I am by the little boys say they have seen the ugly Wyndham come\r\nfrom Beamish\'s.  Oh evil Wyndham being taken by Silk and Gilks.  No one\r\nknows and Wyndham is to be expelled.  I joy much Riddell knoweth it.\r\nTelson telleth Parson that Riddell is gross expelling for Beamish\'s and\r\nWyndham weepeth in private.  I smile at the practice Mr Parrett bowleth\r\nme balls.  I taketh them and am out."\r\n\r\nIf Bosher could have seen the effect of this elegant extract upon the\r\ncaptain he would probably have "joyed" with infinite self-satisfaction.\r\nRiddell\'s colour changed as he read and re-read and re-read again these\r\nfew lines of idiotic jargon.\r\n\r\nHe lay down the book half a dozen times, and as often took it up again,\r\nand scrutinised the entry, and as he did so quick looks of perplexity,\r\nor joy, or shame, even of humour, chased one another across his face.\r\n\r\nThe truth with all its new meaning slowly dawned upon him.  It had been\r\nreserved to Bosher\'s diary, of all agencies in the world, to explain\r\neverything, and cast a flood of light upon what had hitherto been\r\nincomprehensible!\r\n\r\nOf course he could see it all now.  If this diary was to be believed--\r\nbut was it?  Might it not be a hoax purposely put in his way to delude\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nYet he could not believe that this laboriously written record could have\r\nbeen compiled for his sole benefit; and this one entry which he had lit\r\nupon by mere chance was only one of hundreds of stupid, absurd entries,\r\nmost of which meant nothing at all, and which seemed more like the\r\nsymptoms of a disease than the healthy productions of a sane boy.\r\n\r\nIn this one case, however, there seemed to be some method in the\r\nauthor\'s madness, and he had given a clue so important that Riddell, in\r\npondering over it that evening and calculating its true value, was very\r\nnearly being late for the doctor\'s tea at seven o\'clock.\r\n\r\nHowever, he came to himself just in time to decorate his person, and\r\nhurry across the quadrangle before the clock struck.\r\n\r\nOn his way over he met Parson and Telson, walking arm-in-arm.  Although\r\nthe same spectacle had met his eyes on an average twice every day that\r\nterm, and was about the commonest "show" in Willoughby, the sight of the\r\nfaithful pair at this particular time when the revelations of Bosher\'s\r\ndiary were tingling in his ears impressed the captain.  Indeed, it\r\nimpressed him so much that, at the imminent risk of being late for the\r\ndoctor\'s tea, he pulled up to speak to them.\r\n\r\nParson, as became a loyal Parrett, made as though he would pass on, but\r\nTelson held him back.\r\n\r\n"I say, you two," said Riddell, "will you come to breakfast with me to-\r\nmorrow morning after chapel?"\r\n\r\nAnd without so much as waiting for a reply, he bolted off, leaving his\r\ntwo would-be guests a trifle concerned as to his sanity.\r\n\r\nThe clock was beginning to strike as Riddell knocked at the doctor\'s\r\ndoor, and began at length to realise what he was in for.\r\n\r\nHe did not know whether to be thankful or not that Bloomfield and\r\nFairbairn would be there to share his misery.  They would be but two\r\nextra witnesses to his sufferings, and their tribulations were hardly\r\nlikely to relieve his.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was one comfort.  He might have a chance before the\r\nevening was over of telling Bloomfield that he now had every reason to\r\nbelieve his suspicions about the culprit had been wrong.\r\n\r\nHow thankful he was he had held out against the temptation to name poor\r\nWyndham two days ago!\r\n\r\n"Well, Riddell, how are you?" said the doctor, in his usual genial\r\nfashion.  "I think you have met these ladies before.  Mr Riddell--my\r\ndear--Miss Stringer.  These gentlemen you have probably seen before\r\nalso.  Ha! ha!"\r\n\r\nRiddell saluted the ladies very much as he would have saluted two mad\r\ndogs, and nodded the usual Willoughby nod to his two fellow-monitors,\r\nwho having already got over the introductions had retreated to a safe\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nA common suffering is the surest bond of sympathy, and Riddell\r\npositively beamed on his rival in recognition of his salute.\r\n\r\n"I trust your mother," said Mrs Patrick, "whose indisposition we were\r\nregretting on the last occasion when you were here, is now better?"\r\n\r\n"Very well indeed, I hope," replied the captain, hardly knowing what he\r\nsaid.  "Thank you."\r\n\r\n"And I trust, Mr Riddell," chimed in Miss Stringer, "that you were\r\ngratified by the result of the election."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," replied Riddell, beginning to shake in his shoes.\r\n\r\n"Indeed?  If I remember right you professed yourself to be a Liberal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--that is--the Radical got in," faltered Riddell, wondering why in\r\ncommon charity no one came to his rescue.\r\n\r\n"And pray, Mr Riddell," continued Miss Stringer, ruthlessly, "can you\r\ntell us the difference between a Liberal and a Radical?  I have often\r\nlonged to know--and you I have no doubt are an authority?"\r\n\r\nRiddell at this point seriously meditated a forced retreat, and there is\r\nno saying what desperate act he might have committed had not the doctor\r\nprovidentially come to the rescue.\r\n\r\n"The election altogether," said he, laughing, "is rather a sore point in\r\nthe school.  I told you, my dear, about the manner in which Mr\r\nCheeseman\'s letter was received?"\r\n\r\n"You did," replied Mrs Patrick, who for some few moments had had her\r\neyes upon Bloomfield, with a view to draw him out.\r\n\r\n"Now do you really suppose, Mr Bloomfield, that the boys in your house,\r\nfor instance, attached any true importance at all to the issue of the\r\ncontest?"\r\n\r\nBloomfield, who had not been aware till this question was half over that\r\nit had been addressed to him, started and said--the most fatal\r\nobservation he could have made--\r\n\r\n"Eh?  I beg your pardon, that is."\r\n\r\n"I inquired," said Mrs Patrick, fixing him with her eye, "whether you\r\nreally supposed that the boys in your house, for instance, attached any\r\ntrue importance at all to the issue of the contest?"\r\n\r\nBloomfield received this ponderous question meekly, and made a feeble\r\neffort to turn it over in his mind, and then dreading to hear it\r\nrepeated once more, answered, "Oh, decidedly, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"In what respect?" inquired the lady, settling herself down on the\r\nsettee, and awaiting, with raised eyebrows, her victim\'s answer.\r\n\r\nPoor Bloomfield was no match for this deliberate style of tactics.\r\n\r\n"They were all yellow," he replied, feebly.\r\n\r\n"All what, sir?" demanded Mrs Patrick.\r\n\r\n"All Whig, I mean," he said.\r\n\r\n"Exactly.  What I mean to know is, do they any of them appreciate the\r\ndistinction between a Whig (or, as Mr Riddell terms it, a Liberal)--"\r\n\r\nRiddell winced.\r\n\r\n"--Between a Whig and a Radical?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly not," replied Bloomfield, wildly.  "And yet you say that\r\nthey decidedly attached a true importance to the issue of the contest?\r\nThat is very extraordinary!"\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs Patrick rose majestically to take her seat at the table,\r\nleaving Bloomfield writhing and turned mentally inside out, to recover\r\nas best he could from this interesting political discussion!\r\n\r\n"The Rockshire match was a great triumph," said the doctor, cheerily, as\r\nthe company established itself at the festive board--"and a surprise\r\ntoo, surely--was it not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Fairbairn, who, seeing that Bloomfield was not yet in a\r\ncondition to discourse, felt it incumbent on him to reply--"we never\r\nexpected to win by so much."\r\n\r\n"It was quite an event," said the doctor, "the heads of the three houses\r\nall playing together in the same eleven."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied Fairbairn, "Bloomfield here was most impartial."\r\n\r\nBloomfield said something which sounded like "Not at all."\r\n\r\n"I was especially glad to see the Welchers coming out again," said the\r\ndoctor, with a friendly nod to Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Fairbairn, who appeared to be alarmingly at his ease; "and\r\nWelch\'s did good service too; that catch of Riddell\'s saved us a wicket\r\nor two, didn\'t it, Bloomfield?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Was Rockshire a specially weak team this year?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so, sir," replied Fairbairn, politely handing the toast\r\nto Miss Stringer as he spoke; "but they evidently weren\'t so well\r\ntogether as our men."\r\n\r\n"And what, Mr Fairbairn," asked Miss Stringer at this point, in her\r\nmost stately tones--"what, pray, is the exact meaning of the expression\r\n`well together,\' as applied to a company of youths?"\r\n\r\nBloomfield and Riddell groaned inwardly for their comrade.  They had\r\nseen what was coming, and had marked his rash approach to the mouth of\r\nthe volcano with growing apprehension.  They had been helpless to hold\r\nhim back, and now his turn was come--he had met his fate.\r\n\r\nSo, at least, they imagined.  What, then, was their amazement when he\r\nturned not a hair at the question, but replied, stirring his tea\r\ncomplacently as he did so, "You see, each of the Rockshire men may have\r\nbeen a good cricketer, and yet if they had not been used to playing\r\ntogether, as our fellows have been, we should have a decided pull on\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer regarded the speaker critically.  She had not been used to\r\nhave her problems so readily answered, and appeared to discover a\r\nsuspicion of rudeness in the boy\'s speech which called for a set-down.\r\n\r\n"I do not understand what you mean by a `pull,\' Mr Fairbairn," said\r\nshe, sternly.\r\n\r\n"Why," replied Fairbairn, who was really interested in the subject, and\r\nquite pleased to be drawn out on so congenial a topic, "it\'s almost as\r\nimportant to get to know the play of your own men as to know the play of\r\nyour opponents.  For instance, when we all know Bloomfield\'s balls break\r\na bit to the off, we generally know whereabouts in the field to expect\r\nthem if they are taken; and when Porter goes on with slows every one\r\nknows to stand in close and look out for catches."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bloomfield, gaining sudden courage by the example of his\r\ncomrade, "that\'s just where Rockshire were weak.  They were always\r\nshifting about their field and bowlers.  I\'m certain they had scarcely\r\nplayed together once."\r\n\r\n"And," added Riddell, also taking heart of grace, and entering into the\r\nhumour of the situation--"and they seemed to save up their good bowlers\r\nfor the end, instead of beginning with them.  All our hitting men got\r\nthe easy bowling, and the others, who were never expected to score in\r\nany case, were put out by the good."\r\n\r\n"In this respect, you see," continued Fairbairn, addressing Miss\r\nStringer, "a school eleven always get the pull of a scratch team."\r\n\r\nMiss Stringer, who during this conversation had been growing manifestly\r\nuncomfortable, vouchsafed no reply, but, turning to her sister, said,\r\nwith marked formality, "My dear, were the Browns at home when you called\r\nthis afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"I regret to say they were out," replied Mrs Patrick, with a withering\r\nglance round the table.\r\n\r\n"Of course, it depends, too," said Bloomfield, replying to Fairbairn\'s\r\nlast question and giving him an imperceptible sly kick under the table,\r\n"on whether it\'s early or late in the season.  If we were to play them\r\nin August they would know their own play as well as we know ours."\r\n\r\n"Only," chimed in Riddell, "these county teams don\'t stick to the same\r\nelevens as regularly as a school does."\r\n\r\n"My dear, have you done your tea?" inquired Mrs Patrick\'s voice across\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Shall I ring?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Allow me," said Fairbairn, rising hastily, and nearly knocking over\r\nMiss Stringer in his eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe spinster, who had already received in her own opinion sufficient\r\naffront for one evening, put the worst construction possible on this\r\naccident, and answered with evident ill-temper, "You are very clumsy,\r\nsir!"\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, indeed!" said Fairbairn.  "I hope you are not hurt?"\r\n\r\n"Be silent, sir!"\r\n\r\nFairbairn, quite taken aback by this unexpected exclamation, did not\r\nknow what to say, and looked round inquiringly at the doctor, as much as\r\nto ask if the lady was often taken this way.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, however, volunteered no explanation, but looked\r\nuncomfortable and coughed.\r\n\r\n"If you will excuse me," said Miss Stringer to her sister, with a forced\r\nseverity of tone, "I will go to my room."\r\n\r\n"You are not well, I fear," said Mrs Patrick.  "I will go with you";\r\nand next moment the enemy was gone, and the doctor and his boys were\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDr Patrick, who, to tell the truth, seemed scarcely less relieved than\r\nhis visitors, made no attempt to apologise for Miss Stringer\'s sudden\r\nindisposition, and embarked at once on a friendly talk about school\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThis had been his only object in inviting the boys.  He had nothing\r\nmomentous to say, and no important change to propose.  Indeed, his\r\nobject appeared to be more to get them to talk among themselves on\r\nmatters of common interest to the school, and to let them see that his\r\nsympathy was with them in their efforts for the public good.\r\n\r\nNo reference was made to the state of affairs in Parrett\'s, or to the\r\nrivalries of the two captains.  That the doctor knew all about these\r\nmatters no one doubted, but he took the wise course of leaving them to\r\nright themselves, and at the same time of making it very clear what his\r\nopinions were of the effect of disunion and divided interest in a great\r\npublic school.\r\n\r\nAltogether the evening was profitably and pleasantly spent, and when at\r\nlength the boys took their leave it was with increased respect for the\r\nhead master and one another.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, greatly to their relief, did not return to the scene.\r\n\r\n"Miss Stringer," said Fairbairn, as the three walked together across the\r\nquadrangle, "doesn\'t seem to appreciate cricket."\r\n\r\nThe others laughed.\r\n\r\n"I say," said Bloomfield, "you put your foot into it awfully!  She\r\nthought you were chaffing her all the time."\r\n\r\n"Did she?  What a pity!" replied Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"Of course, we were bound to help you out when you were once in,"\r\ncontinued Bloomfield.  "But I don\'t fancy we three will be asked up\r\nthere again in a hurry."\r\n\r\nThey came to the schoolhouse gate, and Fairbairn said good-night.\r\nRiddell and Bloomfield walked on together towards Parrett\'s.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bloomfield!" said the captain, nervously, "I just wanted to tell\r\nyou that I believe I have been all wrong in my guess about the boat-race\r\naffair.  The boy I suspected, I now fancy, had nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"You are still determined to keep it all to yourself, then?" asked\r\nBloomfield, somewhat coldly.\r\n\r\n"Of course," replied the captain.\r\n\r\nAt this point they reached Parrett\'s.  Neither boy had any inclination\r\nto pursue the unpleasant topic--all the more unpleasant because it was\r\nthe one bar to a friendship which both desired.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," said Bloomfield, stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Good-night," replied the captain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nNEW LIGHTS ON OLD QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nFairbairn was startled next morning while engaged over his toilet by a\r\nsudden visit from the captain.\r\n\r\nWhat could be wrong to bring him there at this hour, with a face full of\r\nanxiety and a voice full of concern, as he inquired, "Will you do me a\r\nfavour, old man?"\r\n\r\nFairbairn knew his friend had been in trouble for some time past, and\r\nwas sore beset on many hands.  He had not attempted to intrude into his\r\nsecrets or to volunteer any aid.  For he knew Riddell would ask him if\r\nhe wanted it.  In proof of which here he was.\r\n\r\n"Of course, I will," replied he, "if I can."\r\n\r\n"Do you happen to have a pot of jam you could lend me?"\r\n\r\nFairbairn fairly staggered at this unexpected request.  He had imagined\r\nhe was to be asked at the very least to accompany his friend on some\r\nmatter of moment to the doctor\'s study, or to share some tremendous\r\nsecret affecting the honour of Willoughby.  And to be asked now for the\r\nloan of a pot of jam was too great a shock for his gravity, and he burst\r\nout laughing.\r\n\r\n"A pot of jam!" he exclaimed.  "Whatever do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, any sort you\'ve got," said the captain, eagerly; "and I suppose you\r\nhaven\'t got a pie of any sort, or some muffins?"\r\n\r\nFairbairn gaped at his visitor with something like apprehension as he\r\ncame out with this extraordinary request.  The captain\'s voice was\r\ngrave, and _no_ suspicion of a jest lurked in his face.  Could he\r\npossibly have succumbed to the mental strain of the past term, and taken\r\nleave of his wits?\r\n\r\n"What _are_ you talking about, Riddell?" asked Fairbairn, in tones\r\nalmost of pity.  "Has anything happened to you?"\r\n\r\nRiddell looked at the speaker inquisitively for a moment, then broke out\r\ninto a laugh.\r\n\r\n"What an ass I am!  I forgot to tell you what I wanted them for.  The\r\nfact is, I asked two kids to breakfast this morning, and I just\r\nremembered I had nothing but tea and toast to offer them; and it\'s too\r\nearly to get anything in.  I\'d be awfully obliged if you could help me\r\nout with it."\r\n\r\nFairbairn\'s merriment broke out afresh as the truth revealed itself, and\r\nit was some time before he could attend to business.  He then offered\r\nRiddell anything he could find in his cupboard, and the captain\r\nthereupon gratefully availed himself of the offer to secure a pot of\r\nred-currant jam, a small pot of potted meat, two or three apples, and a\r\nconsiderable section of a plum cake.  All these he promised to replace\r\nwithout delay, and triumphantly hurried back with them in his pocket and\r\nunder his jacket, in time to deposit them on his table before the bell\r\nbegan to ring for chapel.  He also sent Cusack round to the school\r\nlarder to order three new laid eggs and some extra butter to be\r\ndelivered at once.\r\n\r\nThese grand preparations being duly made, he breathed again, and went\r\nhopefully to chapel.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, he had been very near reckoning without his host, or I\r\nshould say his guests.  For Parson and Telson had been some time before\r\nthey could make up their minds to accept the hurried invitation of the\r\nprevious evening.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a row," Telson had said, as the captain disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Of course it is.  I\'m not going," said Parson.\r\n\r\n"Wonder what about?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that Skyrocket affair, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Do you think he\'ll give us impots if we don\'t go?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t know--most likely."\r\n\r\n"Rum, his asking us to breakfast, though," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"All a dodge, I expect," said Parson.  "By the way, what sort of\r\nbreakfasts does he go in for?"\r\n\r\n"Not bad when he likes," said Telson, with the authority of an old fag.\r\n\r\n"Bacon?" asked Parson.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"Jam?" inquired Parson.\r\n\r\n"Generally," replied Telson.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Then Parson said, "Fancy we\'d better turn up.  It\'s\r\nonly civil, when he asked us."\r\n\r\n"All serene," said Telson; "if it is a row, of course it will come off\r\nin any case.  And we may as well get our breakfast somewhere."\r\n\r\nWith which philosophical resolve the matter had been settled, and the\r\namiable pair parted to meet next morning after chapel.\r\n\r\nRiddell spared himself the embarrassment of waiting to escort his guests\r\nto the festive board, and hurried off in advance to see that the\r\npreparations were duly made in their honour.\r\n\r\nHe caught Cusack wistfully eyeing the unwonted array of good things on\r\nthe table, and evidently speculating as to who the favoured guests were\r\nto be.  It was with some difficulty that the captain got him sent off to\r\nhis own breakfast in the big hall, half bribed thereto by the promise of\r\na reversion of the coming feast.\r\n\r\nThen, feeling quite exhausted by his morning\'s excitement, he sat down\r\nand awaited his visitors.\r\n\r\nThey arrived in due time; still, to judge of their leisurely approach\r\nand their languid knock, a little suspicious of the whole affair.  But\r\nthe moment the door opened, and their eyes fell on the table, their\r\nmanner changed to one of the most amiable briskness.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," said Riddell, who, in the presence of the greater\r\nattractions on the table, ran considerable risk of being overlooked\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," cried the boys, suddenly roused by his voice to a sense\r\nof their social duty.\r\n\r\n"Awfully brickish of you to ask us round," said Telson.\r\n\r\n"Rather," chimed in Parson.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you came," said the captain.  "We may as well have breakfast.\r\nTelson, have you forgotten how to boil eggs?"\r\n\r\nTelson said emphatically he had not, and proceeded forthwith to give\r\npractical proof of his cunning, while Parson volunteered his aid in\r\ncutting up the bread, and buttering the toast.\r\n\r\nIn due time the preliminaries were all got through, and the trio sat\r\ndown to partake of the reward of their toil.\r\n\r\nRiddell could not thank his stars sufficiently that he had thought of\r\nembellishing his feast with the few luxuries from Fairbairn\'s cupboard.\r\nNothing could exceed the good-humour of the two juniors as one delicacy\r\nafter another unfolded its charms and invited their attention.  They\r\naccompanied their exertions with a running fire of chat and chaff, which\r\nleft Riddell very little to do except gently to steer the conversation\r\nround towards the point for which this merry meeting was designed.\r\n\r\n"Frightful job to get old Parson to turn up," said Telson, taking his\r\nfourth go-in of potted meat; "he thought you were going to row him about\r\nthat shindy in the Parliament!"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," rejoined Parson, pushing up his cup for more tea.  "It\r\nwas you said that about blowing up us Skyrockets."\r\n\r\n"What a howling cram," said Telson.  "I never make bad jokes.  You know,\r\nRiddell, it was Parson stuck us up to that business.  He\'s always at the\r\nbottom of the rows."\r\n\r\nParson laughed at this compliment.\r\n\r\n"You mean I always _get_ into the rows," said he.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, I don\'t suppose the Skyrockets will show up again this term,"\r\nsaid Telson.\r\n\r\n"They certainly did not get much encouragement last time," said Riddell,\r\nlaughing.  "You know I don\'t think you fellows do yourselves justice in\r\nthings like that.  Fellows get to think the only thing you\'re good at is\r\na row."\r\n\r\n"Fact is," said Parson, "Telson thought we\'d been so frightfully snubbed\r\nthis term, we kids, that he said we ought to stick up for ourselves."\r\n\r\n"I said that?" cried Telson.  "Why, you know it was you said it!"\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Parson, "wasn\'t there to be a special meeting of the\r\nHouse to-day, for something or other?"\r\n\r\nTelson looked rather uncomfortable, and then said, "Yes, I heard so.  I\r\nfancy it\'s about you, somehow," added he, addressing Riddell.\r\n\r\n"About me?" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n"Yes--to kick you out, or something," said Telson; "but Parson and I\r\nmean to go and vote against it."\r\n\r\nThis was news to Riddell, and rather astonishing news too.\r\n\r\n"To kick me out?" he asked.  "What for?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, you know," said Parson.  "It\'s some bosh about that boat-race\r\naffair.  Some of the chaps think you are mixed up in it, but of course\r\nit\'s all a cram.  I\'ve told them so more than once."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all those Parrett\'s cads," said Telson, taking up the matter from\r\na schoolhouse point of view.  "They\'re riled about the race, and about\r\nthe cricket-match, and everything else, and try to make out every one\'s\r\ncheating."\r\n\r\n"Well, some one must have been cheating," said Parson, a trifle warmly,\r\n"when he cut my rudder-lines; and he\'s not likely to be one of _our_\r\nfellows--much more likely to be a schoolhouse cad!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll fight you, you know, Parson!" put in Telson.\r\n\r\nRiddell saw it was time to interfere.  The conversation was drifting\r\ninto an unprofitable channel, from which it would scarcely work its way\r\nout unassisted.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted was to find out whether there was any truth in the\r\nexplanation which the diary afforded of young Wyndham\'s conduct, and he\r\nwas a long way from that yet.\r\n\r\n"Have some more cake, Telson," said he, by way of changing the subject.\r\n\r\nTelson cheerfully accepted the invitation, while Parson, to spare his\r\nhost the trouble of pressing him to take an apple, helped himself.\r\n\r\nThen when they were well started once more the captain said, "Who\'s\r\ngoing to win the juniors\' match, Parson?  Our fellows quite think they\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Parson, contemptuously; "I heard they had cheek enough to\r\nsay so.  But they\'ll be disappointed for once."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Riddell, "they\'ve been practising pretty steadily of late.\r\nThey\'re not to be despised.  Whatever has become of the juniors\' eleven\r\nin the schoolhouse, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t make out," replied Telson; "they\'re an awful set of louts this\r\nyear; only one or two good men in the lot.  I don\'t think they can\r\nscrape up an eleven."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the captain, seeing his chance; "you\'ve lost a good many good\r\nfellows.  Wyndham, for one, has got up into the second-eleven, I hear."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Parson; "and jolly cocky he is about it, too!"\r\n\r\n"He\'s not been down at the practices lately, though," said Telson,\r\ncolouring slightly, and for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n"Why?  Is he seedy?" said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Eh!  No; I don\'t think so.  Wyndham\'s not seedy, is he, should you\r\nthink, Parson?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Parson, exchanging uncomfortable glances with his ally; "not\r\nexactly seedy."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a pity if he doesn\'t get playing in the Templeton match," said\r\nRiddell.\r\n\r\nWould the fish bite?  If the diary had spoken true, these two boys were\r\nat present very full of Wyndham\'s affair, and a trifle indignant with\r\nthe captain himself for his supposed intention of reporting that youth\'s\r\ntransgression at headquarters.  If that were so, Riddell considered it\r\npossible that, after their honest fashion, they might take upon\r\nthemselves to give him a piece of their mind, which was exactly what he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said Telson, "Parson and I both think he\'s down in the\r\nmouth."\r\n\r\n"Indeed?" asked the captain, busily buttering a fresh slice of toast.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Haven\'t you seen it?" asked Parson.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in a funk about something or other," said Telson.\r\n\r\nIt was getting near now!\r\n\r\n"What about, do you know?" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know," said Telson.  "About being expelled, you know."\r\n\r\n"Expelled!  What for?" asked Riddell; and the boy\'s reply gave him a\r\nsatisfaction quite out of proportion to its merits.\r\n\r\n"About Beamish\'s, you know," said Telson, confidentially; "he thinks\r\nyou\'re going to report him."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s bound to get expelled if you do," said Parson.\r\n\r\n"And how do you know about it?" asked the captain, quietly.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you know, Parson and I spotted them--that is, Gilks and Silk and\r\nhim--that night of Brown\'s party.  But we never told anybody, and don\'t\r\nmean to, so I don\'t know how it came out."\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said Parson, "if he\'s to be expelled, Silk and Gilks ought to\r\ncatch it too.  I bet anything they took him there.  Thanks! a little\r\npiece."\r\n\r\nThis last sentence was in reply to an invitation to take some more cake.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of this diversion, Riddell, with thankful heart, continued\r\nto steer the talk out again into the main channel of school affairs, of\r\nwhich the affair of Wyndham junior was but one of many.\r\n\r\nBefore the meal was over it had got as far Eutropius, and he fairly won\r\nhis guests\' hearts by announcing that he did not consider that\r\nhistorian\'s Latin nearly as good as Caesar\'s, an opinion which they\r\nendorsed with considerable heat.\r\n\r\nAll good things come to an end at last, and so did this breakfast, the\r\nend of which found the boys in as great good-humour as at the beginning.\r\nThey thanked the captain most profusely for his hospitality, which they\r\nnever doubted was meant as a recognition of their own sterling merits,\r\nand of the few attempts they had lately made to behave themselves; and,\r\nafter inviting him to come to a concert they were about to give on the\r\nevening of the juniors\' match, took their departure.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Riddell, as they were going, "do either of you know\r\nto whom this book belongs?  I found it in the playground yesterday."\r\n\r\nA merry laugh greeted the appearance of Bosher\'s diary, which the pair\r\nrecognised as a very old friend.\r\n\r\n"It\'s old Bosher\'s diary," said Telson.  "He\'s always dropping it about.\r\nI believe he does it on purpose.  I say, isn\'t it frightful bosh?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t very clear in parts," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Did he call you `evil,\' or `gross,\' or `ugly in the face,\' in the part\r\nyou looked at?" asked Telson; "because, if so, we may as well lick him\r\nfor you."\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t do that," said Riddell; "you had better give it him back,\r\nthough, and advise him from me not to drop it about more than he can\r\nhelp.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nWith a great weight off his mind, Riddell went down to first school that\r\nday a thankful though a humbled man.\r\n\r\nWhat a narrow escape he had had of doing the boy he cared for most in\r\nWilloughby a grievous injustice.  Indeed, by suspecting him privately he\r\nhad done him injustice enough as it was, for which he could not too soon\r\natone.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his relief about the boat-race he could scarcely bring\r\nhimself to regard seriously the boy\'s real offence, bad as that had\r\nbeen; and, indeed, it was not until Wyndham himself referred to it that\r\nafternoon that its gravity occurred to him.\r\n\r\nJust as the special meeting of the Parliament (convened by private\r\ninvitation of Game and Ashley to a select few of their own way of\r\nthinking) was assembling, Wyndham, in compliance with a message from the\r\ncaptain, strolled out into the Big towards the _very_ bench where\r\nyesterday he had had his memorable talk with Silk.\r\n\r\nRiddell was waiting there for him, and as the boy approached, his\r\nwretched, haggard looks smote the captain\'s heart with remorse.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely the spirit to return Riddell\'s salute as he seated\r\nhimself beside him on the bench and waited for what was to come.\r\n\r\n"Old fellow," said Riddell, "don\'t look so wretched.  Things mayn\'t be\r\nso bad as you think."\r\n\r\n"How could they be anything else?" said Wyndham, dolefully.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll listen to me, and not look so frightfully down," said the\r\ncaptain, "I\'ll tell you."\r\n\r\nWyndham made a feeble attempt to rouse himself, and turned to hear what\r\nthe captain had to say.\r\n\r\n"You wonder," said Riddell, "how I came to know about that visit to\r\nBeamish\'s.  Would it astonish you to hear that till this time yesterday\r\nI never knew about it at all?"\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Wyndham, incredulously; "you were talking to me about\r\nit two or three days before."\r\n\r\n"So you thought.  You thought when I said it was my duty to report it,\r\nand that the honour of the school was involved in it, and all that, that\r\nI was talking about that scrape at Beamish\'s."\r\n\r\n"Of course you were," said Wyndham.  "What else could you have been\r\ntalking about?  I confessed it to you myself."\r\n\r\n"And you couldn\'t see what the honour of the school had to do with your\r\ngoing to Beamish\'s, could you?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Well, no.  Perhaps it has, but I didn\'t see it at the time."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said the captain, "and if I had been thinking of\r\nBeamish\'s I should never have said such a stupid thing."\r\n\r\n"Why, what _do_ you mean?" said Wyndham, puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Why, this.  In all our talks you never once mentioned Beamish\'s.  You\r\nconcluded what I suspected you of was this, and I concluded that the\r\nscrape you were confessing was the one I suspected you of."\r\n\r\n"What do you suspect me of, then?" inquired Wyndham, "if it wasn\'t\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m ashamed to say," said the captain, "I suspected you of having cut\r\nthe lines of Parrett\'s rudder at the boat-race."\r\n\r\nWyndham, in the shock of this announcement, broke out into an almost\r\nhysterical laugh.\r\n\r\n"Suspected me of cutting the rudder-lines!" he gasped.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Riddell, sorrowfully.  "I\'m ashamed to say it."\r\n\r\n"Why, however could you?" exclaimed the boy, in strange bewilderment.\r\n\r\nRiddell quietly told him the whole story.  Of the mysterious letter, of\r\nhis visit to Tom the boat-boy, of the knife, of the recollection of\r\nWyndham\'s movements on the night in question, and then of his supposed\r\nadmission of his guilt.\r\n\r\nWyndham listened to it all with breathless attention and wonder, and\r\nwhen it was all done sighed as he replied, "Why, Riddell, it\'s like a\r\nstory, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"It is," said the captain, "and rather a pitiful story as far as I am\r\nconcerned."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit," replied the boy, as sympathetically as if Riddell was the\r\nperson to be pitied and he was the person who had wronged him.  "It was\r\nall a misunderstanding.  How on earth could you have helped suspecting\r\nme?  Any one would have done the same.\r\n\r\n"But," added he, after a pause, "what ought I to do about Beamish\'s?  Of\r\ncourse that was no end of a scrape, and the mischief is, I promised\r\nthose two cads never to say a word about it.  By the way, you saw me\r\nwith Silk on this bench yesterday afternoon?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Riddell; "you didn\'t seem to be enjoying yourself."\r\n\r\n"I should think I wasn\'t.  I\'d been trying to get him to let me off that\r\npromise, and he had offered to do it for seven pounds, under condition.\r\nI might have closed with him if you hadn\'t come past just then.  He held\r\nme down to rile you, and I got so wild I rounded on him and made him in\r\na frightful rage, and it\'s very likely now he may tell Paddy if you\r\ndon\'t."\r\n\r\n"Not he," said Riddell.  "You\'re well out of his clutches, old man, and\r\nit strikes me the best way you can atone for that affair is by keeping\r\nout of it for the future, and having no more to do with fellows like\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"What on earth should I have done," said the boy, "without you to look\r\nafter me?  I\'d have gone to the dogs, to a dead certainty."\r\n\r\n"It seems I can look after you rather too much sometimes," said the\r\ncaptain.  "Ah, there\'s Silk coming this way.  We needn\'t stop, here to\r\ngive him a return match.  Come on."\r\n\r\nAnd the two friends rose and strolled off happily arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nWELCH\'S VERSUS PARRETT\'S JUNIORS.\r\n\r\n"Of course," said Riddell, as he and Wyndham strolled down by the river\r\nthat afternoon, "now that your mystery is all cleared up we are as far\r\noff as ever finding out who really cut the rudder-lines."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  My knife is the only clue, and that proves nothing, for I was\r\nalways leaving it about, or lending it, or losing it.  I don\'t suppose I\r\nkept it one entire week in my pocket all the time I had it.  And, for\r\nthe matter of that, it\'s not at all impossible I may have dropped it in\r\nthe boat-house myself some time.  I often used to change my jacket\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nRiddell had half expected Wyndham would be able to afford some clue as\r\nto who had borrowed or taken the knife at that particular time.  He was\r\nrather relieved to find that he could not.\r\n\r\n"Tom the boat-boy," said he, "distinctly says that the fellow who was\r\ngetting out of the window dropped the knife as he did so.  Of course\r\nthat may be his fancy.  Anyhow, I don\'t want the knife any more, so you\r\nmay as well take it."\r\n\r\nSo saying he produced the knife from his pocket, and handed it to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want the beastly thing," cried Wyndham, taking it and pitching\r\nit into the middle of the river.  "Goodness knows it\'s done mischief\r\nenough!  But, I say, whoever wrote that note must have known something\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Of course," said the captain, "but he evidently intends the thing to be\r\nfound out without his help."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Wyndham, cheerily, "give yourself a little rest, old\r\nman, and come down and see the second-eleven practise.  I\'ve been too\r\nmuch up a tree to turn up lately, but I mean to do so this evening.  I\r\nsay, won\'t it be jolly if my brother can come down to umpire in the\r\nmatch."\r\n\r\n"It _will_," said Riddell, and the pair forthwith launched out into a\r\ndiscussion of the virtues of Wyndham senior, in which one was scarcely\r\nmore enthusiastic than the other.\r\n\r\nOn their way back to the Big they met Parson and Telson, trotting down\r\nto the bathing sheds.\r\n\r\nThe faces of these two young gentlemen looked considerably perplexed as\r\nthey saw the captain and his supposed victim walking arm-in-arm.\r\nHowever, with the delightful simplicity of youth they thought it must be\r\nall right somehow, and having important news of some sort to relate,\r\nthey made no scruple about intruding on the interview.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, Riddell," began Telson, "we\'ve just come from the\r\nParliament.  No end of a row.  Last time was nothing to it!"\r\n\r\n"What happened?" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n"Why, you know," said Parson, "it was Game and Ashley\'s affair summoning\r\nthis meeting.  They sent round a private note or something telling the\r\nfellows there would be a special meeting, signed by Game, First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, and Ashley, Home Secretary.  A lot of the fellows were\r\ntaken in by it and turned up, and of course they had taken good care not\r\nto summon anybody that was sweet on you.  So it was a packed meeting.\r\nAt least they thought so.  But Telson and I showed up, and the whole lot\r\nof the Skyrockets, and gave them a lively time of it."\r\n\r\n"You see," said Telson, eagerly taking up the narrative, "they didn\'t\r\nguess we\'d cut up rough, because we\'ve been in rows of that sort once or\r\ntwice before."\r\n\r\nWyndham broke out laughing at this point.\r\n\r\n"Have you, really?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Well," continued Telson, too full of his story to heed the\r\ninterruption, "they stuck Game in the chair, and he made a frightfully\r\nrambling speech about you and that boat-race business.  He said you knew\r\nwho the chap was, and were sheltering him and all that, and that you\r\nwere as bad every bit as if you\'d done it yourself, and didn\'t care a\r\nhang about the honour of the school, and a whole lot of bosh of that\r\nsort.  We sung out `Oh, oh,\' and `Question,\' once or twice, but, you\r\nknow, we were saving ourselves up.  So Ashley got up and said he was\r\nawfully astonished to hear about it--howling cram, of course, for he\r\nknew about it as much as any one did--and he considered it a disgrace to\r\nthe school, and the only thing to do was to kick you out, and he\r\nproposed it."\r\n\r\n"Then the shindy began," said Parson.  "We sent young Lawkins off to\r\ntell Crossfield what was going on, and directly Ashley sat down old\r\nTelson got up and moved an amendment.  They tried to cry him down, but\r\nthey couldn\'t do it, could they?"\r\n\r\n"Rather not," said Telson, proudly.  "I stuck there like a leech, and\r\nthe fellows all yelled too, so that nobody could hear any one speak.  We\r\nkept on singing out `Hole in the corner!  Hole in the corner!\' for about\r\ntwenty minutes, and there weren\'t enough of them to turn us out.  Then\r\nthey tried to get round us by being civil, but we were up to that dodge.\r\nParson went on after me, and then old Bosher, and then King, and then\r\nWakefield, and when he\'d done I started again."\r\n\r\n"You should have seen how jolly wild they got!" cried Parson.  "A lot of\r\nthe fellows laughed, and joined us too.  Old Game and Ashley were\r\nregularly mad!  They came round and bawled in our ears that they gave us\r\na thousand lines each, and we\'d be detained all the rest of the term.\r\nBut we didn\'t hear it; and when they tried to get at us we hit out with\r\nrulers, and they couldn\'t do it.  You never saw such a lark!"\r\n\r\n"And presently Crossfield turned up," said Telson.  "My eye! you should\r\nhave seen how yellow and green they looked when he dropped in and walked\r\nup to his usual place!  We shut up for a bit as soon as he came--and,\r\nyou know, I fancy they\'d have sooner we kept it up.  They were bound to\r\nsay something when the row stopped.  So Game tried to rush the thing\r\nthrough, and get the fellows to vote before Crossfield knew what was up.\r\nBut he wasn\'t to be done that way."\r\n\r\n"`I didn\'t quite hear what the motion was?\' says he, as solemn as a\r\njudge.\r\n\r\n"`Oh! it\'s about the honour of the school.  Riddell--\'\r\n\r\n"`Excuse me, Mr Deputy-Chairman and ex-monitor,\' says Crossfield, and\r\nthere was a regular laugh at that hit, because, of course, Game had no\r\nmore right in the chair, now he\'s not a monitor, than I had.  `If it\'s\r\nanything to do with the honour of the school, of course it couldn\'t be\r\nin better hands than yours, who have summoned the meeting on the sly,\r\nand taken such care to select a nice little party!\'\r\n\r\n"They tried to stop him at that.\r\n\r\n"`You can\'t stop the business now.  We were just going to take the vote\r\nwhen you came in,\' said Game.\r\n\r\n"`Exactly!\' says Crossfield, propping himself up comfortably against the\r\nback of the form as if he was going to stay all night; `that\'s just why\r\nI came, and that\'s just why Bloomfield, and Porter, and Coates, and\r\nFairbairn, and a few other gentlemen who have a sort of mild interest in\r\nthe honour of the school--although it\'s nothing, of course, to yours--\r\nare coming on too.  They\'ll be here before I\'ve done my speech.  By the\r\nway, one of you kids,\' said he, with a wink our way, `might go and fetch\r\nRiddell; he\'d like to be here too.\'\r\n\r\n"We shoved young Wakefield out of the door to make believe to go and\r\nfetch you.  But they\'d had quite enough of it, and shut up the meeting\r\nall of a sudden.\r\n\r\n"`I adjourn the meeting!\' cried Game, as red as a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\n"`All right! that will suit me just as well,\' says Crossfield, grinning.\r\n`Is it to any particular day, or shall we get notice as before?\'\r\n\r\n"Of course they didn\'t stop to answer, and so we gave no end of a cheer\r\nfor old Crossfield, and then came on here."\r\n\r\nAnd having delivered themselves of this full, true, and particular\r\naccount of the afternoon\'s adventures, these two small heroes continued\r\ntheir trot down to the river to refresh their honest limbs after the\r\nday\'s labours.\r\n\r\nTheir version of the proceedings was very little exaggerated, and, as\r\nCrossfield and several others who were present each entertained his own\r\nparticular circle of friends with the same story, the whole affair\r\nbecame a joke against the luckless Game and Ashley.\r\n\r\nEven their own house did not spare them, and as for Bloomfield, he\r\nevinced his displeasure in a way which surprised the two heroes.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this foolery you\'ve been up to, you two?" said he, coming\r\ninto the preparation-room after tea, where most of the senior Parretts\r\nwere assembled.\r\n\r\nIt was not flattering certainly to the two in question to have their\r\nnoble protest for the honour of the school thus designated, and Game\r\nanswered, rather sheepishly, "We\'ve been up to no foolery!"\r\n\r\n"You may not call it foolery," said Bloomfield, who was in anything but\r\na good temper, "but I do!  Making the whole house ridiculous!  Goodness\r\nknows there\'s been quite enough done in that way without wanting your\r\nhelp to do more!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of going on like that?" said Ashley.  "You don\'t suppose\r\nwe did it to amuse ourselves, do you?"\r\n\r\n"If you didn\'t amuse yourselves you amused every one else," growled\r\nBloomfield.  "Everybody\'s laughing at us."\r\n\r\n"We felt something ought to be done about Riddell--" began Game.\r\n\r\n"Felt!  You\'d no business to feel, if that\'s the best you can show for\r\nit," said Bloomfield.  "_You\'ll_ never set things right!"\r\n\r\n"Look here," said Game, quickly, losing his temper; "you know well\r\nenough it was meant for the best, and you needn\'t come and kick up a row\r\nlike this before everybody!  If you don\'t care to have Riddell shown up,\r\nit is no reason why we shouldn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"A precious lot you\'ve shown him up!  If you\'d wanted to get every one\r\non his side, you couldn\'t have done better.  You don\'t suppose any one\r\nwould be frightened out of his skin by anything a couple of asses who\'d\r\nbeen kicked out of the monitorship had to say?"\r\n\r\nBloomfield certainly had the habit of expressing himself warmly at\r\ntimes, and on the present occasion he may have done so rather more\r\nwarmly than the case deserved.  But he was put out and angry at the\r\nridiculous performance of the Parrett\'s boys, in which he felt the\r\nentire house was more or less compromised.\r\n\r\nAs to Riddell, Bloomfield still kept his own private opinion of him, but\r\nthe difference between him and his more ardent comrades was that he had\r\nthe sense to keep what he thought to himself.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he gave deep offence now to Game and Ashley, who retired in\r\nhigh dudgeon and greatly crestfallen to proclaim their wrongs to a small\r\nand sympathetic knot of admirers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most serious blow these officious young gentlemen had\r\nreceived--hardly second to their snubbing by the Parretts\' captain--had\r\nbeen the mutiny of their own juniors, on whose cooperation they had\r\ncalculated to a dead certainty.\r\n\r\nTo find Parson, Bosher, King, and Co. standing up in defence of Riddell\r\nagainst _them_ was a phenomenon so wonderful, when they came to think of\r\nit, that they were inclined to imagine they themselves were the only\r\nsane boys left out of a house of lunatics.  And this was the only\r\nconsolation that mixed with the affair at all.\r\n\r\nAs to these juniors, they had far more to think about.  In three days\r\nthe match with Welch\'s would be upon them, and a panic ensued on the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThey had been contemptuously confident of their superior prowess, and it\r\nwas not until one or two of them had actually been down to inspect the\r\nplay of the rival team, and Bloomfield had come down to one of their own\r\npractices and declared publicly that they were safe to be beaten hollow,\r\nthat they regarded the coming contest seriously.\r\n\r\nThen they went to work in grim earnest.  Having broken with Game, on\r\nwhom they had usually depended for "instruction and reproof," they\r\nboldly claimed the services of Bloomfield, and even pressed the willing\r\nMr Parrett into the service.\r\n\r\nMr Parrett pulled a very long face the first afternoon he came down to\r\nlook at them.  He had been coaching the Welchers for a week or two past,\r\nand therefore knew pretty well what their opponents ought to be.  And he\r\nwas bound to admit that the young Parretts were very much below the\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nThey had a few good men.  Parson was a fair bat, and King bowled\r\nmoderately; but the "tail" of the eleven was in a shocking condition.\r\nEverything that could be done during the next few days was done.  But\r\ncricket is not a study which can be "crammed" up, like Virgil or Euclid;\r\nand, despite the united efforts of Bloomfield and Mr Parrett, and a few\r\nother authorities, the team was pronounced to be a "shady" one at best\r\nas it took its place on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nRiddell had kept his men steadily at it to the last.  With a generosity\r\nvery few appreciated, he forbore to claim Mr Parrett\'s assistance at\r\nall during the last few days of practice, but he got Fairbairn and one\r\nor two of the schoolhouse seniors instead, and with their help kept up\r\nthe courage and hopes of the young Welchers, wisely taking care,\r\nhowever, by a little occasional judicious snubbing, to prevent them from\r\nbecoming too cocky or sure of the result.\r\n\r\nIt was quite an event to see the Welchers\' flag hoisted once more on the\r\ncricket-ground.  Indeed, it was such an event that the doctor himself\r\ncame down to watch the play, while the muster of schoolboys was almost\r\nas large as at a senior house match.\r\n\r\nAmong all the spectators, none were more interested in the event than\r\nthe seniors, who had taken upon themselves the responsibility of\r\n"coaching" their respective teams.\r\n\r\nRiddell was quite excited and nervous as he watched his men go out to\r\nfield, while Bloomfield, though he would have been the last to own it,\r\nfelt decidedly fidgety for the fate of his young champions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Parretts, who went in first, began better than any one\r\nexpected.  Parson and King went boldly--not to say rashly--to work from\r\nthe outset, and knocked the bowling about considerably before a lucky\r\nball from Philpot got round the bat of the former and demolished his\r\nwicket.\r\n\r\nWakefield followed, and he too managed to put a few runs together; but\r\nas soon as his wicket fell a dismal quarter of an hour followed for the\r\nParretts.  Boy after boy, in all the finery of spotless flannel and pads\r\nand gloves, swaggered up to the wicket, and, after taking "middle" in\r\nmagnificent style, and giving a lordly glance round the field, as though\r\nto select the best point for placing their strokes, lifted their bats\r\nmiserably at the first ball that came, and had no chance of lifting it\r\nat another.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy spectacle, and far more calculated to excite pity\r\nthan amusement.  Bloomfield chafed and growled for some time, and then,\r\nunable to stand it any longer, went off in disgust, leaving the young\r\nreprobates to their fate.\r\n\r\nScarcely less remarkable than the collapse of Parrett\'s was the\r\nsteadiness of Welch\'s in the field.  Although they had little to do,\r\nthey did what there was to do neatly and well, and, unlike many junior\r\nelevens, did it quietly.  The junior matches at Willoughby had usually\r\nbeen more famous for noise than cricket, but on this occasion the order\r\nof things was reversed, and Riddell, as he looked on and heard the\r\ncompliments from all quarters bestowed on his young heroes, might be\r\nexcused if he felt rewarded for all the labour and patience of the past\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nIt offended him not at all to hear this good result attributed generally\r\nto Mr Parrett\'s instructions.  He knew it was true.  Mr Parrett\r\nhimself took care to disclaim any but a small amount of merit in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a wonder to me," said he to Fairbairn, in the hearing of a good\r\nmany seniors, who were wont to treat anything he had to say on athletic\r\nmatters as authoritative--"it\'s a wonder to me how Riddell, who is only\r\na moderate player himself, has turned out such a first-rate eleven.\r\nHe\'s about the best cricket coach we have had, and I have seen several\r\nin my time.  He has worked on their enthusiasm without stint, and next\r\nbest to that, he has not so much hammered into them what they ought to\r\ndo, as he has hammered out of them what they ought not to do.  Three\r\nfellows out of five never think of that."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure they don\'t," said Fairbairn.\r\n\r\n"See how steady they were all the innings, too!" continued Mr Parrett.\r\n"Three coaches out of five wouldn\'t lay that down as the first rule of\r\ncricket; but it is, especially with youngsters.  Be steady first, and be\r\nexpert next.  That\'s the right order, and Riddell has discovered it.  I\r\nwould even back a steady eleven of moderate players against a rickety\r\neleven of good ones.  In fact, a boy can\'t be a cricketer at all, or\r\nanything else, unless he\'s steady.  Now, you see, unless I am mistaken,\r\nthey will give quite as good an account of themselves at the wickets as\r\nthey did on the field."\r\n\r\nAnd off strolled the honest Mr Parrett, bat in hand, to umpire, leaving\r\nhis hearers not a little impressed with the force of his views on the\r\nfirst principles of cricket.\r\n\r\nThe master\'s prophecy was correct.  The Welchers, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that they had only twenty-five runs to get to equal their rivals\'\r\nfirst innings, played a steady and careful innings, in which they just\r\ntrebled the Parretts\' score.  The bowling against them was not strong\r\ncertainly, but they took no liberties with it.  Indeed, both the captain\r\nand Mr Parrett had so ruthlessly denounced and snubbed anything like\r\n"fancy hitting," that their batting was inclined to err on the side of\r\nthe over-cautious, and more runs might doubtless have been made by a\r\nlittle freer swing of the bats.  However, the authorities were well\r\nsatisfied.  Cusack carried his bat for eighteen, much to his own\r\ngratification; and of his companions, Pilbury, Philpot, and Walker each\r\nmade double figures.\r\n\r\nIt required all Riddell\'s authority, in the face of this splendid\r\nachievement, to keep his men from jeopardising their second innings in\r\nthe field by yielding prematurely to elation.\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake don\'t hulloa till you\'re out of the wood!" he said;\r\n"they may catch up on you yet.  Seventy-five isn\'t such a big score\r\nafter all.  If you don\'t look out you\'ll muddle your chance away, and\r\nthen how small you\'ll look!"\r\n\r\nWith such advice to hold them in check, they went out as soberly as\r\nbefore to field, and devoted their whole energies to the task of\r\ndisposing of their enemies\' wickets for the fewest possible runs.\r\n\r\nAnd they succeeded quite as well as before.  Indeed, the second innings\r\nof the Parretts was a feeble imitation of their first melancholy\r\nperformance.  Parson, King, and Wakefield were the only three who made\r\nany stand, and even they fared worse than before.  All the side could\r\nput together was twenty-one runs, and about this, even, they had great\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that the Welchers had won the match by an innings\r\nand twenty-nine runs, great was the amazement of all Willoughby, and\r\ngreater still was the mortification of the unlucky Parretts.  No more\r\nwas said about the grand concert in which they intended to celebrate\r\ntheir triumph.  They evidently felt they had not much to be proud of,\r\nand, consequently, avoiding a public entry into their house, they slunk\r\nin quietly, and, shutting out the distant sounds of revelry and\r\nrejoicing in the victorious house, mingled their tears over a\r\nsympathetic pot of tea, to which even Telson was not invited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA CLIMAX TO EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nAmong the few Willoughbites who took no interest at all in the juniors\'\r\nmatch was Gilks.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be wondered at that he, a schoolhouse boy, should not\r\nconcern himself much about a contest between the fags of Welch\'s and\r\nParrett\'s.  And yet, if truth were known, it would have been just the\r\nsame had the match been the greatest event of the season, for Gilks,\r\nfrom some cause or other, was in no condition to care about anything.\r\n\r\nHe wandered about listlessly that afternoon, avoiding the crowded Big,\r\nand bending his steps rather to the unfrequented meadows by the river.\r\nWhat he was thinking about as he paced along none of the very few boys\r\nwho met him that afternoon could guess, but that it was nothing pleasant\r\nwas very evident.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this very term Gilks had been one of the noisiest\r\nand liveliest fellows in Willoughby.  Although his principles had never\r\nbeen lofty, his spirits always used to be excellent, and those who knew\r\nhim best could scarcely recognise now in the anxious, spiritless monitor\r\nthe companion whose shout and laugh had been so familiar only a few\r\nmonths ago.\r\n\r\nAmong those who met him this afternoon was Wibberly.  Wibberly, like\r\nGilks, felt very little interest in the juniors\' match.  He was one of\r\nthe small party who yesterday had come in for such a smart snubbing from\r\nBloomfield, and the only way to show his sense of the ingratitude of\r\nsuch treatment, especially towards an old toady like himself, was to\r\nprofess no interest in an event which was notoriously interesting the\r\nParretts\' captain.\r\n\r\nSo Wibberly strolled down that afternoon to the river, and naturally met\r\nGilks.\r\n\r\nThe two were not by any means chums--indeed, they were scarcely to be\r\ncalled friends.  But they had one considerable bond of sympathy in a\r\ncommon dislike for the schoolhouse, and still more for Riddell.  Gilks,\r\nas the reader knows, was anything but a loyal schoolhouse man, and ever\r\nsince he became a monitor had cast in his lot with the rival house.  So\r\nthat he was generally considered, and considered himself to be, quite as\r\nmuch of a Parrett as a "schoolhouser."\r\n\r\n"So you are not down looking at the little boys?" said Wibberly.\r\n\r\n"No," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Awful rot," said Wibberly, "making all that fuss about them!"\r\n\r\n"Pleases them and doesn\'t hurt us," replied Gilks.\r\n\r\n"In my opinion it\'s all a bit of vanity on the part of Riddell.  He\'d\r\nlike to make every one think he has been coaching his kids, and this is\r\njust a show-off."\r\n\r\n"Well, let him show off; who cares?" growled Gilks.\r\n\r\n"All very well.  He ought to be hooted round the school instead of\r\nflashing it there in the Big, the hypocritical cad!"\r\n\r\n"Well, why don\'t you go and do it?" said Gilks; "you\'d get plenty to\r\njoin you."\r\n\r\n"Would I?  No, I wouldn\'t.  Even Bloomfield\'s taking his part--he\'s\r\ngammoned him somehow."\r\n\r\n"Well, that doesn\'t prevent your going and hooting him, does it?" said\r\nGilks, with a sneer.  "You\'ve a right to enjoy yourself as well as any\r\none else."\r\n\r\n"What! have you come round to worship his holiness too?" asked Wibberly,\r\nwho had at least expected some sympathy from Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Not exactly!" said Gilks, bitterly; "but I\'ve come round to letting the\r\ncad alone.  What\'s the good of bothering?"\r\n\r\n"And you mean to say you\'d let him go on knowing who the fellow is who\r\ncut the rudder-lines of our boat, and not make him say who it is?"\r\n\r\n"I expect that\'s all stuff about his knowing at all," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Not it!  Between you and me, I fancy he\'s had a tip from somewhere."\r\n\r\n"He has?  Bah! don\'t you believe it.  He\'d like to make believe he knows\r\nall about it.  It would pay, you know."\r\n\r\n"But every one thinks he knows."\r\n\r\n"Not he!  He would have told the fellow\'s name long ago.  Whatever\r\nobject would he have in keeping it back?"\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I don\'t know.  He says some gammon about not being quite sure.\r\nBut he\'s had time enough to be sure by now."\r\n\r\nGilks walked on in silence for a little, and then inquired, "And suppose\r\nyou did get to know who it was, what would be the use?"\r\n\r\n"The use!" exclaimed Wibberly, in amazement.  "Why, what do you mean?\r\nBy Jove, I\'m sorry for the fellow when he turns up.  He\'ll soon find out\r\nthe use of it."\r\n\r\nGilks said nothing, but walked on evidently out of humour, and Wibberly\r\nhaving nothing better to do accompanied him.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said the latter, presently, seeing his companion was not\r\ndisposed to continue the former conversation, "what\'s up between you and\r\nSilk?  Is it true you\'ve had a row?"\r\n\r\nGilks growled out something which sounded very like an oath, and\r\nreplied, "Yes."\r\n\r\n"What about?" inquired the inquisitive Wibberly, who seemed to have the\r\nknack of hitting upon unwelcome topics.\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t do you any good to know," growled Gilks.\r\n\r\n"I heard it was some betting row, or something of that sort," said\r\nWibberly.\r\n\r\n"Eh?--yes--something of that sort," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Wibberly, "I never cared much for Silk.  He always seemed\r\nto know a little too much for me.  I wouldn\'t break my heart if I were\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to," said Gilks, but in a tone which belied the words, and\r\neven struck Wibberly by its wretchedness.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he, "you\'re awfully down in the mouth these times.  What\'s\r\nwrong?"\r\n\r\n"What makes you think anything\'s wrong?  I\'m all right, I tell you,"\r\nsaid Gilks, half angrily.\r\n\r\nWibberly was half inclined to say that he would not have thought it if\r\nhe had not been told so, but judging from his companion\'s looks that\r\nthis little pleasantry would not be appreciated, he forbore and walked\r\non in silence.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief when Wibberly at length discovered that it was time for\r\nhim to be going back.  Gilks wanted nobody\'s company, and was glad to be\r\nleft alone.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he would gladly have escaped even from his own company, which to\r\njudge by his miserable looks as he walked on alone was less pleasant\r\nthan any.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry now he had not gone to watch the juniors, where at least he\r\nwould have heard something less hateful than his own thoughts, and seen\r\nsomething less hateful than the dreary creations of his own troubled\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use of keeping it up?" said he, bitterly, to himself.  "I\r\ndon\'t care!  Things can\'t be worse than they are.  Down in the mouth!\r\nHe\'d be down in the mouth if he were!--the fool!  I\'ve a good mind to--\r\nAnd yet I daren\'t face it.  What\'s the use of trusting to a fellow like\r\nSilk!  Bah! how I hate him.  He\'ll betray me as soon as ever it suits\r\nhim, and--and--oh, I don\'t care.  Let him!"\r\n\r\nGilks had reached this dismal climax in his reflections, when he\r\nsuddenly became aware that the object of his meditations was approaching\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSilk had his own reasons for not joining the throng that was looking on\r\nat the juniors\' match.  It may have been mere lack of interest, or it\r\nmay have been a special desire to take this walk.  Whichever it was, his\r\npresence now was about as unwelcome an apparition as Gilks could have\r\nencountered, and the smile on the intruder\'s face showed pretty clearly\r\nthat he was aware of the fact.\r\n\r\n"What are you prowling about here for?" said he as he came up, with all\r\nthe insolence of a warder addressing a convict.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a right to walk here if I choose," replied Gilks, sulkily; "what\r\nare you here for?"\r\n\r\n"To find you.  I want to speak to you," replied Silk.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to speak to you," replied Gilks, moving on.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" replied Silk, with a sneer.  "You\'ll have to do it whether\r\nyou want or not, my boy."\r\n\r\nThere was something about the Welcher which had the effect of cowing his\r\ncompanion, and Gilks, fuming inwardly, and with a face as black as\r\nthunder, said, "Well--say what you\'ve got to say, and be done with it."\r\n\r\nSilk laughed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  I\'ll take my time, not yours.  Which way are you going?"\r\n\r\n"No way at all," said Gilks, standing still.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  I\'m going this way.  Come with me."\r\n\r\nAnd he began to walk on, Gilks sullenly following.\r\n\r\n"You saw Wyndham the other day?" said Silk.\r\n\r\n"Suppose I did?"\r\n\r\n"What did he want?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--some foolery or other.  I didn\'t listen to him."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t tell lies.  What did he want, I say?"\r\n\r\n"How should I know?" retorted Gilks.\r\n\r\n"What did he want? do you hear?" repeated the other.\r\n\r\n"He wanted me to let him blab about something--about Beamish\'s it was."\r\n\r\n"And did you tell him he might?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I said he might blab about me too for all I cared.  And so he\r\nmay.  I wish to goodness he would."\r\n\r\n"And whatever business had you to tell him he might say a word about\r\nit?" demanded Silk, angrily.\r\n\r\n"What business?  A good deal more business than you\'ve got to ask me\r\nquestions."\r\n\r\n"Do you know what he\'s done?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t; and I don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you care?" snarled Silk, fast losing his temper; "that foolery of\r\nyours has spoiled everything."\r\n\r\n"So much the better.  _I_ don\'t care."\r\n\r\n"But _I_ care!" exclaimed Silk, furiously, "and I\'ll see you care too,\r\nyou fool!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s happened, then?" asked Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Why, Riddell--"\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake don\'t start on him!" cried Gilks, viciously; "he\'s\r\nnothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he?  That\'s all you know, you blockhead!  He suspected Wyndham\r\nof that boat-race business.  I can\'t make out how, but he did.  And the\r\nyoung fool all along thought it was Beamish\'s he was in a row about.\r\nBut Riddell wouldn\'t have known it to this day if you hadn\'t given the\r\nyoung idiot leave to go and blab, and so clear it up."\r\n\r\n"Let him blab.  I wish he\'d clear up everything," growled, or rather\r\ngroaned, Gilks.\r\n\r\n"Look here!" said Silk, stopping short in his walk and rounding on his\r\nvictim.  "I\'ve had quite enough of this, and you\'d better shut up.  You\r\nknow I could make you sorry for it if I chose."\r\n\r\nGilks said nothing, but walked on sullenly.\r\n\r\n"And the worse thing about it," continued Silk, "is that now Wyndham and\r\nRiddell are as thick as brothers, and the young toady\'s sure to tell him\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"And suppose he does?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s no suppose about it.  I don\'t choose to have it, I tell you."\r\n\r\n"How can you help it?" said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"We must get hold of the young \'un again," said Silk, "and you\'ll have\r\nto manage it."\r\n\r\n"Who?--I?" said Gilks, with a bitter laugh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you.  And don\'t talk so loud, do you hear?  You\'ll have to manage\r\nit, and I think I can put you up to a way for getting hold of him."\r\n\r\n"You can spare yourself the trouble," said Gilks, stopping short and\r\nfolding his arms doggedly.  "I won\'t do it."\r\n\r\n"What!" cried Silk, in a passion.\r\n\r\nIt was the second time in one week that Silk had been thus defied--each\r\ntime by a boy whom he had imagined to be completely in his power.\r\nWyndham\'s mutiny had not wholly surprised him, but from Gilks he had\r\nnever expected it.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t do it, there!" said Gilks, now fairly at bay and determined\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nSilk glared at him for a moment, then laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?  You know what you are saying?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said Gilks.\r\n\r\n"And you know what I shall do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you\'ll tell--"\r\n\r\nSilk\'s face fell.  He was beginning to discover that once more he had\r\noverdone his part, and that the ground was taken from under him.  But he\r\nmade one last effort to recover himself.\r\n\r\n"I say, Gilks," said he, half coaxing, half warning, "don\'t be a fool.\r\nDon\'t ruin yourself.  I didn\'t mean to be offensive.  You know it\'s as\r\nmuch in your interest as mine.  If we can get hold of young Wyndham\r\nagain--"\r\n\r\n"If you want him, get him yourself, I\'m not going to do it," once more\r\nsaid Gilks, with pale face and clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nSilk\'s manner changed once more.  His face became livid, and his eyes\r\nflashed, as he sprang at Gilks, and with a sudden blow, exclaimed, "Take\r\nthat, then!"\r\n\r\nIt was as good as proclaiming that the game was over.  As Gilks\'s guilty\r\nconfidant he had retained to the last some sort of influence; but now,\r\nwith that blow, the last shred of his superiority had gone, and he stood\r\nthere beaten before ever the fight began.\r\n\r\nGilks had expected the blow, but had not been prepared for its\r\nsuddenness.  It struck him full on the cheek, and for a moment staggered\r\nhim--but only for a moment.  Wasting no words, he returned it\r\nvehemently, and next moment the fight had begun.\r\n\r\nThat fight was not the growth of a day or a week.  For many weeks it had\r\nbeen getting nearer and nearer, sometimes by rapid strides, sometimes by\r\nimperceptible steps; but always getting nearer, until now it had\r\nsuddenly reached its climax; and the cry, "A fight--Gilks and Silk!"\r\nspread like wildfire over Willoughby.\r\n\r\nThe Welchers, in the heyday of their triumph, heard it above even the\r\nchorus of the glorious Bouncer; and hearing it, forsook their revelry\r\nand hurried towards it.  The Parretts quitted their melancholy teapot,\r\nand rushed with one accord to the spot.  And ere they reached it Telson\r\nwas there, and many a schoolhouse Limpet, and Game, and Ashley, and\r\nWibberly, from Parrett\'s; and Tucker, and I know not what crowds from\r\nWelch\'s.  And they crowded round, and took sides, and speculated on the\r\nresult, and cheered impartially every hit.\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to describe that fight.  It was no different from\r\ntwenty other fights that same term, except from the one fact that the\r\ncombatants were seniors.  No one cared an atom about the quarrels or its\r\nmerits.  It was quite enough that it was an even match--that there was\r\nplenty of straight hitting and smart parrying, and that it lasted over a\r\nquarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonder it lasted so long.  Not that the men could not stay, but\r\nbecause no monitor with power to stop it appeared on the scene.  Indeed,\r\nthe only monitor present was Gilks himself, and he took no steps to end\r\nthe conflict.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, while the result was still undecided, a cry of\r\n"_Cave_!" was raised.\r\n\r\n"Look out, here\'s Riddell!" cried some small boy.\r\n\r\nA round was just beginning, and neither combatant evinced any desire to\r\ndesist on account of the captain\'s approach.\r\n\r\nRiddell was not alone, Fairbairn was with him, and, being naturally\r\nattracted by the crowd and shouting, they both hurried up in time to see\r\nthe end of the round.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was over they pushed their way in among the crowd and\r\nentered the ring.\r\n\r\n"Stop the fight!" said Riddell.\r\n\r\nThe two combatants glared at him angrily, and Gilks replied, "Who says\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"I say so," said Riddell, quietly.\r\n\r\nThe days were long gone by when the captain issued his orders in an\r\napologetic voice and a diffident manner.  He had learned enough during\r\nthis term to discover the value of a little self-confidence, and had\r\nprofited by the discovery.  Willoughby was far more docile to an order\r\nthan to a request, and on the present occasion neither Gilks nor Silk\r\nseemed disposed to argue the matter.\r\n\r\nThey put on their jackets sulkily, and, without further words to one\r\nanother or to the monitors, betook their battered selves to their\r\nseveral quarters.\r\n\r\nWilloughby, perceiving that the matter was at an end, also dispersed and\r\nreturned to its several quarters.  The Welchers resumed their\r\ninterrupted revel with unabated rejoicing; the melancholy Parretts\r\ncalled for more hot water to eke out the consolations of their teapot;\r\nthe Limpets turned in again to their preparation, and the seniors to\r\ntheir studies--every one criticising the fight, and wondering how it\r\nwould have ended, but scarcely one troubling himself much about its\r\nmerit, and less still about its consequences.\r\n\r\nOne of these consequences the principals in the engagement were not long\r\nin learning.  A message arrived for each, before the evening was over,\r\nthat they were reported to the doctor, and were to go to his room at\r\nnine next morning.\r\n\r\nSilk did not get the message till late, as he had been absent most of\r\nthe evening in Tucker\'s study, who was an expert at repairing the damage\r\nincurred in a pugilistic encounter.\r\n\r\nWhen about bedtime he returned to his own study and found the captain\'s\r\nnote lying on the table, he broke out into a state of fury which, to say\r\nthe least of it, it was well there was no one at hand to witness.\r\n\r\nLate as the hour was, he went at once to Riddell\'s study.\r\n\r\nRiddell was half-undressed as his visitor entered.  "What do you want?"\r\nhe inquired.\r\n\r\n"I want you!  Do you mean to say you\'ve reported me to the doctor?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  It was a fight.  I\'m bound to report it."\r\n\r\n"_Bound_ to report it.  You snivelling humbug!  Have you sent the name\r\nup yet?"\r\n\r\n"Why do you want to know?" said Riddell, who had ceased to be in bodily\r\nfear of Silk for some time past.\r\n\r\n"Because I want to know.  Have you sent it up?"\r\n\r\n"I have."\r\n\r\n"All right, you\'ll be sorry for it," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"I _am_ sorry for it," replied the captain.\r\n\r\nSilk saw at a glance that the captain was not to be bullied, and changed\r\nhis tone.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you know," said he, "we shall both be expelled?"\r\n\r\n"The doctor doesn\'t usually expel for fighting," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Of course not.  But you remember getting a note from me a little time\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"From you?  No; I never had a note from you."\r\n\r\n"What, not one telling you to go down and see Tom the boat-boy?"\r\n\r\n"Was that from you?" exclaimed Riddell, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Of course it was.  And of course you know now what I mean."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t.  I could discover nothing," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"You mean to say you don\'t know who cut the rudder-lines?"\r\n\r\n"No; who?"\r\n\r\n"Gilks!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nA TREATY OF PEACE.\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s first impulse on receiving from Silk this astounding piece\r\nof information was to go at once to the schoolhouse and confront Gilks\r\nwith his accuser.\r\n\r\nBut his second impulse was to doubt the whole story and look upon it as\r\na mere fabrication got up in the vague hope of preventing him from\r\nreporting the fight to the doctor.\r\n\r\nIt was absurd to suppose Gilks had cut the rudder-lines.  Not that it\r\nwas an action of which he would be incapable.  On that score the\r\naccusation was likely enough.  But then, Riddell remembered, Gilks,\r\nthough a schoolhouse boy, had all along been a strong partisan of the\r\nParretts\' boat, and, ever since he had been turned out of his own boat,\r\nhad made no secret of his hope that Parrett\'s might win.  He had even,\r\nif rumours spoke truly, lost money on the race.  How was it likely,\r\nthen, he would do such an absurd thing as cut the rudder-lines of the\r\nvery boat he wanted to win, and on whose success he had even made a bet?\r\n\r\nIt was much more likely that Silk had made this wild charge for the sake\r\nof embarrassing the captain, and leading him to reconsider his\r\ndetermination to report the fight.\r\n\r\nAnd what followed partly confirmed this idea.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t want to get both Gilks and me expelled?" said Silk, with a\r\nhalf-whine very different from his late bullying tones.\r\n\r\n"The doctor never expels fellows for fighting."\r\n\r\n"But he will when he finds out all this other business," said Silk.\r\n\r\n"I really can\'t help that," said the captain, not quite seeing how the\r\ntwo offences were involved one with another.\r\n\r\n"It\'s bound to come out," continued Silk, "and Gilks will bring me into\r\nit too.  I say, can\'t you get back the names?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"You were glad enough to hush it all up when you thought it was young\r\nWyndham had done it," said Silk.\r\n\r\nThe captain winced, and Silk was quick enough to see it.\r\n\r\n"You profess to be fair and honest.  Do you call it fair to shelter one\r\nfellow because he\'s your friend, and tell about another because he\r\nisn\'t?  Eh, Riddell?"\r\n\r\nIt was not a bad move on Silk\'s part.  The question thrust home, and had\r\nhe been content to leave the matter there, it might have been some time\r\nbefore the captain, with his own scrupulous way of regarding things,\r\nwould have detected its fallacies.  But, not for the first time, Silk\r\noverdid it.\r\n\r\n"Besides," said he, seeing he had made an impression, and foolishly\r\nthinking to follow it up--"besides, young Wyndham\'s a long way from\r\nbeing out of the wood himself yet.  Of course I don\'t want to do it, but\r\nI could make it rather awkward for him if I chose."\r\n\r\nThe captain fired up scornfully, but Silk did not notice it, and\r\ncontinued, "You wouldn\'t like to see him expelled, would you?  If I were\r\nto tell all I know about him, he would be, to a certainty."\r\n\r\nRiddell, on whom these incautious words had acted with a result wholly\r\ndifferent from what was intended, could scarcely contain himself to talk\r\ncoolly as he replied, "Please leave my room.  I don\'t want you here."\r\nSilk looked round in a startled way at the words, and his face changed\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n"What?" he demanded.  "Please leave my room," replied the captain.  "Not\r\ntill you promise to get back the names."\r\n\r\n"I shall do nothing of the sort."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t?  You know the consequence?"  Riddell said nothing.  "I shall\r\ntell of Wyndham," said Silk.  "Please leave my room," once more said the\r\ncaptain.  Silk glared at him, and took a step forward as though he meant\r\nto try one last method for extorting the promise.\r\n\r\nBut Riddell stood his ground boldly, and the spirit of the bully\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be sorry for it," snarled the latter.  Riddell said nothing, but\r\nwaited patiently for him to go.  Seeing that nothing more was to be\r\ngained, and baffled on all points--even on the point where he made sure\r\nof having his enemy, Silk turned on his heel and went, slamming the door\r\nviciously behind him.\r\n\r\nRiddell had rarely felt such a sense of relief as he experienced on\r\nbeing thus left to himself.\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of Silk\'s disclosure and the strange way in which it had\r\nbeen followed up had disconcerted him.  But now he had time to think\r\ncalmly over the whole affair.\r\n\r\nAnd two things seemed pretty clear.  One was that, strange as it seemed,\r\nthere must be something in Silk\'s story.  He could hardly have invented\r\nit and stuck to it in the way he had for no other purpose than\r\nembarrassing the captain; and the pressure he had applied to get Riddell\r\nto withdraw the names before the doctor saw them, confirmed this idea.\r\n\r\nThe other point made clear was that his duty, at whatever cost, even at\r\nthe cost of young Wyndham himself, was to report the fight and make no\r\nterms with the offenders.  If the result was what Silk threatened, he\r\ncould only hope the doctor would deal leniently with the boy.\r\n\r\nOne other thing was clear too.  He must see both Wyndham and Bloomfield\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nWith which resolve, and not without a prayer for wisdom better than his\r\nown to act in this crisis, he retired to bed.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning, before almost any sign of life showed itself in\r\nWilloughby, the captain was up and dressed.\r\n\r\nThe magic that so often attends on a night\'s sleep had done its work on\r\nhim, and as he walked across the quadrangle that fresh summer morning\r\nhis head was clear and his mind made up.\r\n\r\nThe outer door of the schoolhouse was still unopened, and he paced\r\noutside, as it seemed to him, for half an hour before he could get in.\r\n\r\nHe went at once to Wyndham\'s study, and found that young athlete\r\narraying himself in his cricket flannels.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Riddell!" cried he, as the captain entered; "have you come to\r\nsee the practice?  We\'re going to play a scratch match with some of the\r\nseniors.  You play too, will you?"\r\n\r\nThe captain did not reply to this invitation, and his serious face\r\nconvinced Wyndham something must be wrong.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up, I say?" he inquired, looking concerned.\r\n\r\n"Nothing very pleasant," said Riddell.  "You heard of the fight last\r\nnight?"\r\n\r\n"Eh? between Silk and Gilks?  Yes.  I half guessed it would come to\r\nthat.  They\'ve been quarrelling a lot lately."\r\n\r\n"I reported them, and they are to go to the doctor\'s after breakfast,"\r\nsaid Riddell.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll catch it, I expect," said Wyndham.  "Paddy\'s sure to be down on\r\nthem because they\'re seniors."\r\n\r\n"They expect to catch it.  At least, Silk says so.  He came to me last\r\nnight and tried to get me to withdraw the names.  And when I said I\r\ncouldn\'t be threatened to tell about you, and get you into a row."\r\n\r\nWyndham\'s face changed colour.\r\n\r\n"What?  I say, do you think he really will?" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s very likely," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Of course, you can\'t withdraw the names?" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no right to do it--no, I can\'t," replied the captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course.  But I say, what had I better do?" faltered the boy.  "I\r\nhoped that bother was all over."\r\n\r\n"I would advise you to go to the doctor before chapel and tell him\r\nyourself."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"How can I?  I promised I wouldn\'t, and Silk wouldn\'t let me off when I\r\nasked him."\r\n\r\n"But he is going to tell of you, he says.  You had much better let the\r\ndoctor hear it from you than from him."\r\n\r\n"If only I could!" exclaimed the boy; "but how can I?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to persuade you to break a promise," said the captain,\r\n"but I\'m sorry for it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'m sure to get expelled," said the boy, dismally; "they\'re\r\nsure to make it as bad against me as they can."\r\n\r\nRiddell reflected a little, and then said, "Perhaps it\'s only a threat,\r\nand no more.  At any rate, if the doctor is told he is sure to give you\r\na chance of telling him everything, so don\'t give up hope, old man."\r\n\r\nPoor Wyndham did not look or feel very hopeful certainly as he thought\r\nover the situation.\r\n\r\n"Thanks for telling me about it, anyhow," said he.  "I say, shall you be\r\nthere to hear what they say?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  I don\'t think so.  But if you are sent for let me know,\r\nand I\'ll go with you."\r\n\r\nWith this grain of comfort the captain went, leaving Wyndham anything\r\nbut disposed to show up at the cricket practice.  Indeed, for a little\r\nwhile he gave up all thought of going out, and it was not till a\r\nmessenger arrived to tell him he was keeping everybody waiting that he\r\nscrewed himself up to the effort and went.\r\n\r\nRiddell meanwhile, with the other half of his mission still to execute,\r\nwent over to Parrett\'s.  Parson was lounging about at the door, with a\r\ntowel over his arm, waiting, as any one might have guessed, for Telson.\r\n\r\n"Has Bloomfield gone out?" asked the captain of this youthful hero.\r\n\r\nParson, who ever since the famous breakfast in Riddell\'s room had looked\r\nupon the captain with eyes of favour, replied, "No, I don\'t think so,\r\nI\'ll go and see if you like."\r\n\r\n"Thanks.  If he\'s in, tell him I want to speak to him."\r\n\r\n"All serene.  Hold my towel, do you mind?  It\'s Bosher\'s, and he may try\r\nto collar it if he sees me.  And tell Telson I\'ll be back in a second."\r\n\r\nAnd off he went, leaving the captain in charge of Bosher\'s towel.\r\n\r\nHe soon returned with a message that Bloomfield was getting up, and\r\nwould be out in a minute or two.\r\n\r\n"I say," said he, after the two had waited impatiently some time, each\r\nfor his own expected schoolfellow, "did you see much of the fight last\r\nnight?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Riddell, "I didn\'t see it at all."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hard lines.  I got there late, as I went to tell Telson.  Gilks\r\nused his right too much, you know.  We both thought so.  He keeps no\r\nguard to speak of, and-- Hullo! where on earth have you been all this\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\nThis last exclamation was in honour of Telson, who appeared on the scene\r\nat that moment, and with whom the speaker joyfully departed, leaving\r\nRiddell only half informed as to the scientific defects in Gilks\'s style\r\nof boxing.\r\n\r\nIn due time Bloomfield appeared, not a little curious to know the object\r\nof this early interview.\r\n\r\nRiddell, too, was embarrassed, for the last time they met they had\r\nparted on anything but cordial terms.  However, that had nothing to do\r\nwith his duty now.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning," he said, in reply to Bloomfield\'s nod.  "Do you mind\r\ntaking a turn?  I want to tell you something."\r\n\r\nBloomfield obeyed, and that morning any one who looked out might have\r\nwitnessed the unusual spectacle of the Willoughby captains walking\r\ntogether round the quadrangle in eager conversation.\r\n\r\n"You heard of the fight?" said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Yes; what about it?" inquired Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve reported it.  And last night Silk came to me and asked me to get\r\nback the names."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t do it, will you?" asked Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"No.  But the reason why Silk wanted it was because he was afraid of\r\nsomething else coming out.  He says it was Gilks who cut the rudder-\r\nlines."\r\n\r\n"What!  Gilks?" exclaimed Bloomfield, standing still in astonishment.\r\n"It can\'t be!  Gilks was one of us.  He backed our boat all along!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I can\'t make out," said the captain; "and I wanted to\r\nsee what you think had better be done."\r\n\r\n"Have you asked Gilks?" inquired Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"No.  I thought perhaps the best thing was to wait till they had been up\r\nto the doctor.  They may let out about it to him, if there\'s anything in\r\nit.  If they don\'t, we should see what Gilks says."\r\n\r\n"If it had been your lines that were cut," said Bloomfield, "I could\r\nhave believed it.  He had a spite against all your fellows, and\r\nespecially you, since he was kicked out of the boat.  But he had betted\r\nover a sovereign on us, I know."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have believed it at all," said Riddell, "if Silk hadn\'t\r\nsent me an anonymous note a week or two ago.  Here it is, by the way."\r\n\r\nBloomfield read the note.\r\n\r\n"Did you go and see the boat-boy?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and all I could get out of him was that some one had got into the\r\nboat-house that night, and scrambled out of the window just in time to\r\navoid being seen.  But the fellow, whoever he was, dropped a knife,\r\nwhich I managed to get from Tom, and which turned out to be one young\r\nWyndham had lost."\r\n\r\n"Young Wyndham!  Then it was true you suspected him?"\r\n\r\n"It was true."\r\n\r\nAnd then the captain told his companion the story of the complication of\r\nmisunderstandings which had led him almost to the point of denouncing\r\nthe boy as the culprit; at the end of which Bloomfield said, in a more\r\nfriendly tone than he had yet assumed, "It was a shave, certainly.\r\nYoung Wyndham ought to be grateful to you.  He\'d have found it not so\r\neasy to clear himself if you\'d reported him at once."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it would have been hard," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"I\'m rather ashamed of myself now for trying to make you do it," said\r\nBloomfield.\r\n\r\n"Oh, not at all," said Riddell, dreading as he always did this sort of\r\ntalk.  "But, I say, what do you think ought to be done?"\r\n\r\n"I think we\'d better wait, as you say, till they\'ve been to Paddy.  Then\r\nif nothing has come out, you ought to see Gilks."\r\n\r\n"I think so, but I wish you\'d be there too.  As captain of the clubs,\r\nyou\'ve really more to do with it than I have."\r\n\r\n"You\'re captain of the school, though," said Bloomfield, "but I\'ll be\r\nthere too, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said Riddell.\r\n\r\nAnd the two walked on discussing the situation, and drifting from it\r\ninto other topics in so natural a way that it occurred to neither of\r\nthem at the time to wonder how they two, of all boys, should have so\r\nmuch in common.\r\n\r\n"I shall be awfully glad when it\'s all cleared up," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"So shall I.  If it is cleared up the credit of it will belong to you, I\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Not much credit in getting a fellow expelled," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow, it was to your credit sticking by young Wyndham as you did."\r\n\r\n"I was going to report him for it, though, the very day the matter was\r\nexplained."\r\n\r\n"Well, all the more credit for making up your mind to an unpleasant duty\r\nlike that when you might have shirked it."\r\n\r\nThe bell for chapel began to ring at this point.\r\n\r\n"There goes the bell," said Bloomfield.  "I say, how should you like to\r\nask me to breakfast with you?  I\'d ask you to my room, only our fellows\r\nwould be so inquisitive."\r\n\r\nRiddell jumped at the hint with the utmost delight, and to all the\r\nmarvels of that wonderful term was added this other, of the two\r\nWilloughby captains breakfasting _tete-a-tete_, partaking of coffee out\r\nof the same pot and toast cut off the same loaf.\r\n\r\nThey talked far more than they ate or drank.  It was more like the talk\r\nof two friends who had just met after a long separation, than of two\r\nschoolfellows who had sat shoulder to shoulder in the same class-room\r\nfor weeks.  Bloomfield confided all his troubles, and failures, and\r\ndisappointments, and Riddell confessed his mistakes, and\r\ndiscouragements, and anxieties.  And the Parrett\'s captain marvelled to\r\nthink how he could have gone on all this term without finding out what a\r\nmuch finer fellow the captain of the school was than himself.  And\r\nRiddell reproached himself inwardly for never having made more serious\r\nefforts to secure the friendship of this honest, kind-hearted athlete,\r\nand gradually these secret thoughts oozed out in words.\r\n\r\nBloomfield, as was only natural and only right, took to himself most of\r\nthe blame, although Riddell chivalrously insisted on claiming as much as\r\never he could.  And when at last this wonderful meal ended, a revolution\r\nhad taken place in Willoughby which the unsuspecting school, as it\r\nbreakfasted elsewhere, little dreamed of.\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour we _have_ been fools," said Bloomfield: "that is, I\r\nhave.  But we\'ll astonish the fellows soon, I fancy.  Do you know I\'ve a\r\ngood mind to break bounds or have a fight with some one just to make you\r\ngive me an impot!"\r\n\r\n"As long as you don\'t do anything which calls for personal\r\nchastisement," said the captain, laughing, "I\'ll promise to oblige you."\r\n\r\n"I say," said Bloomfield, as the bell for first school was beginning to\r\nring, "I\'m glad we--that is I--have come to our senses before old\r\nWyndham comes down.  His young brother has persuaded him to come and\r\numpire for the school in the Templeton match."\r\n\r\nRiddell\'s face became troubled.\r\n\r\n"I hope young Wyndham may be here himself.  You know, Silk threatened\r\nthat unless I withdrew the names he would tell the doctor about that\r\naffair of Beamish\'s and get Wyndham expelled to spite me."\r\n\r\nBloomfield laughed.\r\n\r\n"Not he.  It\'s all brag, depend on it.  But why on earth doesn\'t the\r\nyoung \'un go and make a clean breast to the doctor, before he gets to\r\nknow of it any other way?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the worst of it.  They made him promise he wouldn\'t say a\r\nword about it to any one, and he\'s such an honest young beggar that even\r\nthough Silk tells of him, he won\'t tell of Silk."\r\n\r\n"That\'s awkward," said Bloomfield, musing.  "Did he tell you about it,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"No.  His mouth was shut, you see.  If I hadn\'t found out about it from\r\nParson and Telson, who saw the three of them coming out, I shouldn\'t\r\nhave known it till now."\r\n\r\nBloomfield\'s face brightened.\r\n\r\n"Then you found it out quite independently?" asked he.\r\n\r\n"To be sure."\r\n\r\n"All right.  Then the best thing you can do is to report him for it at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"What?" exclaimed Riddell, aghast, "report him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  And then you can go to Paddy and tell him all about it, and\r\nexplain how he was led into it, and he\'s sure not to be very down on\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," said Riddell, struck with the idea, "I do believe you\r\nare right.  It\'s the very best thing I could do.  What a donkey I was\r\nnever to think of it before."\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that young Wyndham was forthwith to be reported for\r\nhis transgression, and as the time had now arrived when all the school\r\nbut Gilks and Silk were due in class, the two captains hurried off to\r\ntheir places, each feeling that he had discovered a friend; and in that\r\nfriend a hope for Willoughby, of which he had scarcely even dreamed till\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nA BUSY DAY FOR THE DOCTOR.\r\n\r\nRiddell had not been many minutes in class before a message came from\r\nthe doctor summoning him to the library.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival there he found, to his surprise, Silk standing alone in\r\nthe middle of the room, while the doctor was quietly writing at his\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Riddell," said the doctor, as the captain entered, "you reported two\r\nboys to me.  Only one is here."\r\n\r\n"I told Gilks he was to be here at nine o\'clock, sir," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"You had better go and see why he is not here."\r\n\r\nRiddell obeyed, and found on inquiry at the schoolhouse that Gilks was\r\non the sick-list, and had obtained leave from the matron to remain in\r\nbed till after dinner.\r\n\r\nThe captain had his private doubts as to the seriousness of the\r\ninvalid\'s case, especially as, of the two, he was the less damaged in\r\nyesterday\'s fight.  However, he had no right to question the matron\'s\r\ndecision, and returned accordingly to report the matter to the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the doctor, who also evidently considered it a curious\r\ncoincidence that Gilks should be taken unwell the very morning when his\r\npresence was required in the library; "he had better have come.  You say\r\nhe is to be up after dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then let him know he is to come here at four o\'clock, and you, Silk,\r\ncome too at that hour."\r\n\r\nSilk, who had evidently screwed himself up for the present interview,\r\nlooked disappointed.\r\n\r\n"I should like just to say, sir--" began he, with a glance at Riddell.\r\n\r\nBut the doctor interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Not now, Silk.  Go to your class now, and come here at four o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not about--"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear me, sir?" said the doctor, sternly.\r\n\r\nSilk went.\r\n\r\nThe captain was about to follow his example, when it occurred to him he\r\nmight not have so favourable an opportunity again that day for acting on\r\nBloomfield\'s advice respecting Wyndham.\r\n\r\n"Can you spare a few minutes, sir?" said he, turning back.\r\n\r\n"Yes, what is it?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about young Wyndham, sir."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Nothing wrong, I hope.  He has seemed a good deal steadier than he\r\nwas, of late."\r\n\r\n"So he is, sir.  But this is about something he did some time ago."\r\n\r\nThe doctor settled himself judicially in his chair, and waited for the\r\ncaptain\'s report.\r\n\r\n"He got into bad company early in the term, sir, and was tempted down\r\ninto the town without leave, and once let himself be taken to Beamish\'s\r\nAquarium."\r\n\r\nThe doctor gave a grunt of displeasure, which sounded rather ominous.\r\n\r\n"How long ago was this?"\r\n\r\n"A few days before the boat-race, sir.  It has been weighing on his mind\r\never since."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you of it?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No, I found it out accidentally.  When I spoke to him about it he\r\nadmitted it and seemed very sorry."\r\n\r\n"And why did he not come to me himself at once?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it, sir," said the captain.  "I advised him to do it, and\r\nhe told me he had promised the--the companions with whom he went never\r\nto mention the matter to anybody, and this prevented his coming.  He\r\neven went to them, and begged them to let him off the promise so that he\r\nmight come and confess to you, but he did not succeed."\r\n\r\n"Did he ask you, then, to come and tell me?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir.  But he is in constant dread of your hearing about it from any\r\none else, so that I thought it would be the best thing to tell you of it\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded his head.\r\n\r\n"He does not know, of course, of your doing this?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, sir."\r\n\r\n"And who were the companions who you say took him to this place?"\r\n\r\nRiddell coloured up and felt very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind me not telling you, sir?" he said.  "Wyndham only wanted\r\nyou to know about his part in it.  I\'ll tell you if you wish," added he,\r\n"but I\'d rather not if you do not mind."\r\n\r\n"You need not do so at present," said the doctor, greatly to the\r\ncaptain\'s relief, "but you had better send Wyndham to me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Riddell, turning to go, but lingering for one final\r\nword.  "I hope, sir--you--that is, if you can--you will take a lenient\r\nview of it.  Young Wyndham\'s very steady now."\r\n\r\n"I must see Wyndham before I can decide," said the doctor, "but you have\r\nacted rightly in the matter--quite rightly."\r\n\r\nThe captain went to find Wyndham, hoping for the best, but decidedly\r\nanxious.\r\n\r\nThat young gentleman was engaged in the agonies of Euclid when the\r\nschool messenger entered, and announced that the doctor wanted to see\r\nhim at once.  His face fell, and his heart beat fast as he heard the\r\nsummons.  It needed not much effort to guess what it all meant.  Gilks\r\nand Silk had of course been up before the doctor, and the latter had\r\ncarried out the threat of which Riddell had told him; and now he was\r\nsummoned to hear his fate!\r\n\r\nAt the schoolhouse door he found Riddell waiting for him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Riddell, I say!" exclaimed he, in tones of misery, "I\'ve to go to\r\nthe doctor at once.  Silk has told about me.  I say, do come with me."\r\n\r\n"Silk hasn\'t told about you at all," said the captain; "I\'ve reported\r\nyou myself."\r\n\r\n"You!" cried Wyndham, in tones of mingled amazement and reproach; "oh,\r\nwhy?"\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t you sooner have had me do it than Silk?" asked Riddell.\r\n\r\nThe boy saw his meaning at once, and as usual flew from one extreme to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course!  What a brute I was not to see it.  Thanks awfully, old\r\nman.  What awful grief I should have come to if it hadn\'t been for you!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know at all what view the doctor takes of the matter," said the\r\ncaptain, gravely; "you had better not expect too much."\r\n\r\nWyndham groaned.\r\n\r\n"If only I\'m not expelled!" said he.  "I suppose you can\'t come too?"\r\n\r\n"No.  The doctor wants to see you alone, I think."\r\n\r\n"Well, here goes.  By the way, of course, you didn\'t mention the other\r\nfellows\' names?" he added.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he said this made Riddell feel doubly glad that the\r\ndoctor had not insisted on his telling.\r\n\r\n"No--I didn\'t," he said.\r\n\r\nAnd off went Wyndham, dismally, to the doctor\'s study.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious morning for the captain.  Wyndham had not returned\r\nbefore first school was over, and Riddell felt he could not rest till he\r\nknew his fate.\r\n\r\nHe told Bloomfield of his morning\'s proceedings, but even this new\r\nfriend\'s encouragement failed to shake off the suspense that weighed\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nPresently when he could wait patiently no longer, it occurred to him\r\nWyndham might possibly have gone back to his study unobserved, and be\r\nwaiting there for him.  So he went across to the schoolhouse to find\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut nearly all the studies in the schoolhouse, Wyndham\'s included, were\r\nempty, as they almost always were at this hour of the day during summer;\r\nand the captain was about to return, more uncomfortable than ever, to\r\nthe Big, when a door at the end of the passage opened, and some one\r\ncalled his name.\r\n\r\nIt was Gilks, who, as he was dressed, had evidently recovered from his\r\nindisposition earlier than was expected.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned as the captain looked round; and Riddell, inwardly wondering\r\nwhen his work as a police-officer would cease, and he would be able to\r\nretire again into private life, turned and entered his study.\r\n\r\nGilks shut the door carefully behind him.  He had a haggard look about\r\nhim which may have been the result of his ailment, or may have been\r\ncaused by mental trouble, but which certainly was not the expression to\r\nwhich the captain had been used.\r\n\r\n"I\'m to go to the doctor at four?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  He put it off, as you were reported on the sick-list."\r\n\r\n"Of course he thinks I was shamming?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"I was--and I wasn\'t.  I couldn\'t make out what to do, that was it, so I\r\nstayed in bed.  Was Silk there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did he say anything?"\r\n\r\n"No; the doctor told him to come again at four."\r\n\r\nGilks took one or two uncomfortable turns up and down the room, and then\r\nsaid, "I may as well tell you, it\'s no use keeping it back any longer,\r\nfor it\'s sure to come out.  I was the fellow who cut the rudder-line.\r\nDid you know that?"\r\n\r\n"I had heard it."\r\n\r\n"Who told you--Silk?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I thought so.  I knew he would.  And he\'ll tell Paddy this afternoon.\r\nI don\'t care if he does."\r\n\r\n"I scarcely believed it when he said so," said Riddell.\r\n\r\n"Eh?  I suppose you thought it was rather too low even for me.  So it\r\nwould have been once," he said, bitterly.\r\n\r\n"But you backed the Parrett\'s boat all along," said Riddell.  "Oh, that.\r\nIf that\'s all that puzzled you it\'s easily explained.  Perhaps if you\r\nwere doing a thing like that in the dark, expecting to be caught out\r\nevery moment, you might make a mistake too."\r\n\r\n"Then you meant to cut _our_ lines?" asked the captain, seeing the whole\r\nmystery explained at last.\r\n\r\n"Of course I did; and so I should have done if the rudders hadn\'t been\r\nshifted, and Parrett\'s put into the schoolhouse boat."  He took a few\r\nmore turns, and then continued, "You may fancy what a pleasant state of\r\nmind I\'ve been in since.  I daresay you\'ll be glad to hear I\'ve been\r\nmiserable day and night."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry for you," said Riddell, so sympathetically that the\r\nunhappy boy started.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be if you knew it was all to spite you.  I was as bad as\r\nSilk in that, though it was his idea about cutting the lines.  The\r\naccident turned out well for us in one way--nobody suspected either of\r\nus.  But Silk has led me the life of a dog ever since.  I\'ve not known\r\nwhat minute it might all come out.  He was always holding it over my\r\nhead, and I had to do anything he told me.  I can tell you I\'ve thought\r\nof bolting more than once, or telling Paddy."\r\n\r\n"It must have been a dreadful time for you," said Riddell.  "So it was.\r\nBut I\'m glad it\'s all over now.  I shall be glad to be expelled.  I\'ve\r\nbeen ashamed to look any one in the face for weeks.  I used to be happy\r\nenough before I knew Silk, but I don\'t expect ever to be happy again\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nThere was a tremble in his voice as he said this, which went to the\r\ncaptain\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I hope it\'s not so bad as that," said he, quietly.  "Everybody here\r\nhates me, and they\'ll hate me all the more now," said Gilks.  "You and\r\nyoung Wyndham are the only fellows that have been good to me, and I\'ve\r\ndone both of you nothing but mischief."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Riddell, "the fellows will soon forgive.  They would, I\r\nknow, if they guessed how you have suffered already."\r\n\r\n"You are right.  I have suffered," said Gilks.  Another long pause\r\nfollowed, during which the minds of both were full.\r\n\r\nThe one sensation in the captain\'s heart was pity.  He forgot all about\r\nthe crime in commiseration of the wretchedness of the criminal.  Yet he\r\nknew it was useless to hold out any hope of a reprieve, even if that had\r\nbeen to be desired.  All he could do was to let the poor fellow know at\r\nleast that he was not friendless; and this sign of sympathy Gilks\r\ngratefully appreciated.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why you should trouble yourself about me," he said, after\r\nsome further talk.  "You owe me less than anybody.  I\'ve been nothing\r\nless than a brute to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Riddell; "but, do you know, I think it would be well to\r\ngo to the doctor at once?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to go at once.  Do you think he\'ll let me go off this afternoon,\r\nI say?  I wouldn\'t dare to face the fellows.  I\'ve got most of my things\r\npacked up."\r\n\r\n"I expect he would.  But you stay till the morning.  You can have my\r\nstudy.  It\'s quieter than this."\r\n\r\nPerhaps no more hospitable invitation had been issued in Willoughby, and\r\nGilks knew it.  And it was too welcome not to be accepted gratefully.\r\n\r\nThe captain soon afterwards departed, leaving the penitent behind him,\r\nsubdued and softened, not by any sermon or moral lecture, which at such\r\na time Riddell felt would be only out of place, but by sheer force of\r\nkindness--that virtue which costs so little, yet achieves so much.\r\n\r\nIn this new excitement the captain had for the moment forgotten young\r\nWyndham, but he was soon reminded of that afflicted youth\'s existence on\r\nreaching the Big.\r\n\r\nHe was there, waiting impatiently.  A glance sufficed to show that at\r\nany rate the worst had not happened, but Wyndham\'s face was such a\r\nmixture of relief and woe that the captain felt some misgivings as he\r\ninquired eagerly what was the news.\r\n\r\n"He was frightfully kind," said Wyndham, "and talked to me like a\r\nfather.  I never felt so ashamed of myself.  I\'m certain it\'s what you\r\nsaid made him let me off so easy--that is, so what he means for easy.\r\nHe said nothing about expelling, even when I couldn\'t tell him the names\r\nof those two fellows.  But he\'s gated me till the end of the term!  I\r\nmay only go out for the half-hour after first school, and half an hour\r\nafter half-past five.  And you know what that means," he added, with a\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\n"What?" asked Riddell, too rejoiced that his friend was safe to be over-\r\ncurious as to the exact consequence of his sentence.\r\n\r\n"Why!" exclaimed Wyndham, "it\'s all up with the second-eleven!"\r\n\r\nIt was a blow undoubtedly--perhaps the next hardest blow to expulsion--\r\nbut so much less hard that not even the boy himself could for long\r\nregard it as a crushing infliction.\r\n\r\nHe had had his lesson, and after the suspense of the last few weeks he\r\nwas ready to expiate his transgression manfully, if sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," said he, after pouring out all his disappointment into the\r\ncaptain\'s sympathetic ear, "it\'s not as bad as being sent off home.  And\r\nif it hadn\'t been for you that\'s what might have happened.  I say, and\r\nthink of my brother coming down to umpire, too!  What a fool I shall\r\nlook!  Never mind; it can\'t be helped.  I\'m sure to get into the eleven\r\nnext season.  I say, by the way, I\'ve no right to be standing out here.\r\nI shall have to go in."\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the story of young Wyndham\'s transgressions.\r\n\r\nRiddell had to officiate at yet one more investigation that eventful\r\nday.\r\n\r\nScarcely had Wyndham disappeared when a message reached him that the\r\ndoctor wished to see him again.\r\n\r\nWith no doubt this time as to the purport of the summons, he obeyed.\r\n\r\nHe found Gilks standing in the doctor\'s presence, where Silk had stood\r\nan hour or so earlier.\r\n\r\n"Riddell," said the doctor, whose face was grave, and whose voice was\r\nmore than unusually solemn, "Gilks here has just been making a very\r\nserious statement about an accident that happened early in the term--the\r\nbreaking of the line at the boat-race, which he confesses was his doing.\r\nI wish you to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Gilks told me of it just before he came to you, sir," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"I never expected to hear such a confession from a Willoughby boy," said\r\nthe doctor.  "The honour of the whole school has suffered by this\r\ndisgraceful action, and if I were to allow it to pass without the\r\nseverest possible punishment I should not be doing my duty.  Gilks has\r\ndone the one thing possible to him to show his remorse for what has\r\noccurred.  He has confessed it voluntarily, but I have told him he must\r\nleave the school to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nGilks remained where he was, with his eyes on the ground, while the\r\ndoctor was speaking, and attempted no plea to mitigate the sentence\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n"I find," continued the doctor, "that if he tells the truth he has not\r\nbeen the only, and perhaps not the principal, culprit.  He says he did\r\nwhat he did at the suggestion of Silk.  Perhaps you will send for Silk\r\nnow, Riddell."\r\n\r\nRiddell went off to discharge the errand.  When he returned Gilks looked\r\nup and said, nervously, "Need I stay, sir?  I don\'t want to see Silk."\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him doubtfully, and replied, "Yes, you must stay."\r\n\r\nA long, uncomfortable pause followed, during which no one spoke or\r\nstirred.  At length the silence was broken by a knock on the door, and\r\nSilk entered.\r\n\r\nHe glanced hurriedly round, and seemed to take in the position of\r\naffairs with moderate readiness, though he was evidently not quite sure\r\nwhether Gilks or the captain was his accuser.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, however, soon made that clear.\r\n\r\n"Silk," he said, "Gilks accuses you of being a party to the cutting of\r\nthe rudder-links of one of the boats in the race last May.  Repeat your\r\nstory, Gilks."\r\n\r\n"He needn\'t do it," said Silk, "I\'ve heard it already."\r\n\r\n"He says you suggested it," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a lie," said Silk sullenly; "I never heard of it till\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"You know you did," said Gilks.  "When I was turned out of the boat, and\r\ncouldn\'t baulk the race that way, it was you suggested cutting the\r\nlines, and I was glad enough to do it."\r\n\r\n"So you were," snarled Silk, incautiously--"precious glad."\r\n\r\n"Then you did suggest it?" said the doctor, sharply.\r\n\r\nSilk saw his mistake, and tried to cover it, but his confusion only made\r\nthe case against him worse.\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t--he told me about it afterwards--that is, I heard about\r\nit--I never suggested it.  He said he knew how to get at the boats, and\r\nI said--"\r\n\r\n"Then you did speak about it beforehand?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No--that is--we only said--"\r\n\r\n"Silk," said the doctor, sternly, "you\'re not speaking the truth.  Let\r\nme implore you not to make your fault greater by this denial."\r\n\r\nSilk gave in.  He knew that his case was hopeless, and that when Gilks\r\nhad said all, Riddell could corroborate it with what had been said last\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Well--yes, I did know of it," said he, doggedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor; "I\'m glad at least you do not persist in denying\r\nit.  You must quit Willoughby, Silk; I shall telegraph to your father\r\nthis afternoon.  You must be ready to leave by this time to-morrow."\r\n\r\nSilk hesitated for a moment, then with a look round at Riddell, he said,\r\n"Before I go, sir, I think you ought to know that Wyndham junior--"\r\n\r\n"What about him?" asked the doctor, coldly.\r\n\r\n"He is in the habit, as Riddell here knows, of frequenting low places of\r\namusement in Shellport.  I have not mentioned it before; but now I am\r\nleaving, and Riddell is not likely to tell you of it, I think you ought\r\nto know of it, sir."\r\n\r\n"The matter has already been reported," said the doctor, almost\r\ncontemptuously.  "You can go, Silk."\r\n\r\nThe game was fairly played out at last, and Silk slunk off, followed\r\nshortly afterwards by the captain and Gilks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nA TRANSFORMATION SCENE.\r\n\r\nWilloughby little dreamed that night, as it went to bed, of the\r\nrevolutions and changes of the day which had just passed.\r\n\r\nIt knew that Silk and Gilks had been reported for fighting, and\r\nnaturally concluded that they had also been punished.  It had heard,\r\ntoo, a rumour of young Wyndham\'s having been "gated" for breaking\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nBut beyond that it knew nothing.  Nothing of the treaty of peace between\r\nthe two captains, of the discovery of the boat-race mystery, of the\r\ndouble expulsion that was impending.\r\n\r\nAnd still less did it dream of the unwonted scene which was taking place\r\nthat evening in the captain\'s study.\r\n\r\nRiddell and Gilks sat and talked far into the night.\r\n\r\nI am not going to describe that talk.  Let the reader imagine it.\r\n\r\nLet him imagine all that a sympathetic and honest fellow like Riddell\r\ncould say to cheer and encourage a broken-down penitent like Gilks.  And\r\nlet him imagine all that that forlorn, expelled boy, who had only just\r\ndiscovered that he had a friend in Willoughby, would have to say on this\r\nlast night at the old school.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to him to unburden his mind, and Riddell encouraged him\r\nto do it.  He told all the sad history of the failures, and follies, and\r\nsins which had reached their catastrophe that day; and the captain, on\r\nhis side, in his quiet manly way, strove all he could to infuse some\r\nhope for the future, and courage to bear his present punishment.\r\n\r\nWhether he succeeded or not he could hardly tell; but when the evening\r\nended, and the two finally betook themselves to bed in anticipation of\r\nGilks\'s early start in the morning, it was with a feeling of comfort and\r\nrelief on both sides.\r\n\r\n"If only I had known you before!" said Gilks.  "I don\'t know why you\r\nshould be so kind to me.  And now it\'s too late to be friends."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Riddell, cheerily.  "We needn\'t stop being friends\r\nbecause you\'re going away."\r\n\r\n"Needn\'t we!--will you write to me now and then?" asked Gilks, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Of course I will, and you must do the same.  I\'ll let you know all the\r\nnews here."\r\n\r\nGilks sighed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the news here won\'t be very pleasant for me to hear," said\r\nhe.  "What a fury the fellows will be in when they hear about it.  I\r\nsay, Riddell, if you get a chance tell them how ashamed and miserable I\r\nwas, will you?"\r\n\r\n"I will, I promise you," replied Riddell.\r\n\r\n"And, I say, will you say something to young Wyndham?  Tell him how I\r\nhate myself for all the mischief I did to him, and how thankful I am he\r\nhad you to keep him straight when I was trying to lead him all wrong.\r\nWill you tell him that?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try," said the captain, with a smile, "part of it.  But we ought\r\nto be turning in now, or we shall not be up in time."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Gilks.  "Good-night, Riddell."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, old fellow."\r\n\r\nBloomfield was up early next morning.  He had only received the evening\r\nbefore the melancholy notification of the fact that young Wyndham, owing\r\nto circumstances over which he had no control, would be unable to play\r\nin the second-eleven match next week; and he had it on his mind\r\nconsequently to find a successor without delay.\r\n\r\nProbably, on the principle that the early bird gets the worm, he\r\ndetermined to be out in good time this morning.  But for once in a way\r\nthe bird was too early for the worm, and Bloomfield prowled about for a\r\ngood quarter of an hour before the aspiring youth of Willoughby mustered\r\nat the wickets.\r\n\r\nIt was during this early prowl, while the hands of the clock were\r\nbetween half-past six and seven, that he received something like a shock\r\nfrom seeing the captain alight at the school gate from the town omnibus.\r\n\r\n"Why, whatever\'s up?  Where have you been?" inquired Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I have just been to see poor Gilks off," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"What! then it was true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I hadn\'t time to tell you yesterday.  He\'s been expelled."\r\n\r\n"The cad!" cried Bloomfield.  "It\'s lucky for him he was able to slink\r\noff unnoticed."\r\n\r\n"Oh! don\'t be too down on him," said the captain.  "You\'d have been\r\nsorry for him if you\'d have seen how cut up and ashamed he was.  After\r\nall, he was little better than a tool in somebody else\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"Silk\'s you mean?" said Bloomfield.  "And I suppose he gets off scot-\r\nfree?"\r\n\r\n"No; he is expelled too.  He had to confess that he suggested the whole\r\nthing, and he is to go this morning."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a comfort!  But why on earth did they cut our lines instead of\r\nyours?"\r\n\r\n"That was a blunder.  Gilks, in his flurry, got hold of the wrong\r\nrudder.  I really think that\'s why it wasn\'t found out long ago."\r\n\r\n"Very likely.  But what a nice pair of consciences they must have had\r\never since!  I suppose the doctor will announce that they\'ve been\r\nexpelled?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  But I hope he won\'t be too hard on Gilks if he does.  I\r\nnever saw a fellow so broken-down and sorry.  He quite broke down just\r\nnow at the station as he was starting."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said Bloomfield.  "The fellows won\'t take the trouble to\r\nabuse him much now he\'s gone."\r\n\r\nAt this point two Parrett\'s juniors came past.  They were Lawkins and\r\nPringle, two of the noisiest and most impudent of their respectable\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nAmong their innocent amusements, that of hooting the captain had long\r\nbeen a favourite, and at the sight of him now, as they concluded, in\r\naltercation with their own hero, they thought they detected a\r\nmagnificent opening for a little demonstration.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!  Booh!  Fiddle de Riddell!" cried Pringle, jocosely, from a safe\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n"Who cut the rudder-lines?  Cheat!  Kick him out!" echoed Lawkins.\r\n\r\nThe captain, who was accustomed to elegant compliments of this kind from\r\nthe infant lips of Willoughby, took about as much notice of them now as\r\nhe usually did.  In other words, he took no notice at all.\r\n\r\nBut Bloomfield turned wrathfully, and shouted to the two boys, "Come\r\nhere, you two!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; we\'ll come to _you_!" cried Lawkins.\r\n\r\n"You\'re our captain; we\'ll obey _you_!" said Pringle, with a withering\r\nlook at Riddell.\r\n\r\n"What\'s that you said just now?" demanded Bloomfield.\r\n\r\n"I only said, `Kick him out!\'" said Lawkins, somewhat doubtfully, as he\r\nnoticed the black looks on the Parrett\'s captain\'s face.\r\n\r\nBloomfield made a grab at the two luckless youths, and shook them very\r\nmuch as a big dog shakes her refractory puppies.\r\n\r\n"And what do you mean by it, you young cubs!" demanded he, in a rage.\r\n\r\n"Why, we weren\'t speaking to _you_," whined the juniors.\r\n\r\n"No, you weren\'t; but I\'m speaking to you!  Take that, for being howling\r\nyoung cads, both of you!" and he knocked their two ill-starred heads\r\ntogether with a vigour which made the epithet "howling" painfully\r\naccurate.  "Now beg Riddell\'s pardon at once!" said he.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed with most abject eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Mind I don\'t catch you calling my friends names like that any more,"\r\nsaid Bloomfield.  "Riddell\'s captain here, and if you don\'t look out for\r\nyourselves you\'ll find yourselves in the wrong box, I can tell you!  And\r\nyou can tell the rest of your pack, unless they want a hiding from me,\r\nthey\'d better not cheek the captain!"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he allowed the two terrified youngsters to depart; which they\r\ndid, shaking in their shoes and marvelling inwardly what wonder was to\r\nhappen next.\r\n\r\nThe morning passed, and before it was over, while all the school was\r\nbusy in class, Silk left Willoughby.  His father had arrived by an early\r\ntrain, and after a long interview with the doctor had returned taking\r\nhis boy with him.  No one saw him before he went, and for none of those\r\nwhom he had wronged and misled did he leave behind any message of regret\r\nor contrition.  He simply dropped out of Willoughby life, lamented by\r\nnone, and missed only by a few who had suffered under his influence and\r\nwere now far better without him.\r\n\r\nAfter morning classes the doctor summoned the school to the great hall,\r\nand there briefly announced the changes that had taken place.\r\n\r\n"Two boys," said he, "are absent to-day--absent because they have left\r\nWilloughby for good.  Now that they are gone, I need not dwell on the\r\nharm they have done, except to warn any boys present, who may be tempted\r\nto follow in their steps, of the disgrace and shame which always follow\r\nvice and dishonesty."\r\n\r\nThere was a great stir and looking round as the doctor reached this\r\npoint.  He had not yet announced the names, though most present were\r\nable to guess them.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not you two, then?" whispered Telson across the bench to where\r\nCusack and Pilbury sat in mutual perplexity.\r\n\r\n"Two things at least are comforting in what has passed," continued the\r\ndoctor.  "One is that by the confession of these two boys a very\r\nunpleasant mystery, which affected the honour of the whole school, has\r\nbeen cleared up; I mean, of course, the accident at the boat-race early\r\nin the term."\r\n\r\nIt was then, that!  Willoughby bristled up with startled eagerness to\r\nhear the rest, and even Telson found no joke ready to hand.\r\n\r\n"The other consolation is that one of the boys, Gilks--"\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden half-suppressed exclamation as the name was\r\nannounced, which disconcerted the doctor for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Gilks," pursued he, "expressed deep contrition for what he had done,\r\nand wished, when leaving, that the school should know of his shame and\r\nsorrow.  He left here a softened and, I hope, a changed boy; and I feel\r\nsure this appeal to the generosity of his old schoolfellows will secure\r\nfor him what he most desires--your forgiveness."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, and every face was grave, as the doctor concluded,\r\n"I wish I could say as much of his companion, and I fear, leader in\r\nwrong--Silk."\r\n\r\nThere was another start, but less of surprise than assent this time.\r\nFor when Gilks had been named as one culprit every one knew the name of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n"I have no message for you from him," said the doctor, with a voice in\r\nwhich a faint tremble was discernible; "but on his behalf we may at\r\nleast hope that in new scenes, and under more favourable conditions, he\r\nmay be able to recover the character he lost here.  An event like this\r\ncarries its own lesson.  Do not be too ready to blame them, but let\r\ntheir example be humbly taken by each one of you as a warning against\r\nthe first approach of temptation, from which none of us is free, and\r\nwhich by God\'s help only can any of us hope ever to resist or overcome."\r\n\r\nThe doctor\'s words did not fail to make a deep impression on those\r\npresent.  There were not a few whose consciences told them that after\r\nall the difference between them and the expelled boys was not very\r\ngreat, and it had needed a warning like this to arouse them.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day a subdued atmosphere hung over Willoughby.  A good\r\nmany boys thought more than was their wont, and even the noisiest shrunk\r\nfrom indulging their high spirits to their customary extent.\r\n\r\nBut the chief feeling that day was one of relief.  Not that two bad boys\r\nhad been expelled, but because the hateful boat-race mystery had been\r\nfinally cleared up, and with it the reproach on the honour of Willoughby\r\nhad been removed.  As long as it had hung like a black cloud over the\r\nterm, boys had lacked spirit and encouragement to rally for the good of\r\nthe school.  House had been divided against house, set against set,\r\ncaptain against captain, and the order and discipline of the school had\r\ngone down to a miserable pitch.\r\n\r\nAgainst all these opposing influences the new captain, as we have seen,\r\nhad struggled gallantly, and not wholly without success; but even his\r\ninfluence could not disperse all the suspicions, and heartburnings, and\r\njealousies that centred round that unlucky race.  Now, however, the\r\nclearing up of that mystery, and, still more, the new alliance, rumours\r\nof which were spreading fast, between the two captains, opened new hopes\r\nfor the old school.\r\n\r\nThere were not a few who at first treated the rumours of the new\r\nalliance with sceptical derision, but they had soon cause to discover\r\nthat it was more than a joke.\r\n\r\nStutter and Wibberly, two of the sceptics, happened to be caught that\r\nvery afternoon by Bloomfield in the act of "skulking" dinner--that is,\r\nof answering to their names at the call-over, and then slipping off\r\nunobserved to enjoy a rather more elaborate clandestine meal in their\r\nown study.  It was not a very uncommon offence, or perhaps a very\r\nterrible one, but it was an offence which monitors were bound to report.\r\n\r\n"Where are you off to?" demanded Bloomfield, encountering these two\r\ndeserters.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s all right," said Wibberly, "we\'ve been called over.  We\'re\r\nonly going to Stutter\'s study."\r\n\r\n"Go back at once," said Bloomfield, "and go to the captain after six."\r\n\r\nWibberly laughed.\r\n\r\n"You\'re joking surely," said he; "you usen\'t to mind the extra feeds now\r\nand then."\r\n\r\n"If I shirked my duty once it\'s no reason I should do it for ever.  Go\r\nback, do you hear? at once."\r\n\r\n"What, won\'t you let us go this time?" said Wibberly, quite bewildered\r\nby this unexpected sternness on the part of his old patron.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear what I say?" thundered Bloomfield.  "Do you want to be\r\nlicked into the bargain?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Wibberly, with a last fond thought of Stutter\'s\r\ngood bill of fare.  "But, I say, you needn\'t give us lines, Bloomfield."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve nothing to do with giving you lines.  That\'s the captain\'s\r\naffair."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?  Do you mean to say you\'ll report us to Riddell?"\r\n\r\n"Of course.  He\'s the captain."\r\n\r\n"Oh, look here!" cried Wibberly, quite convinced now that the rumours\r\nwere no joke.  "We\'ll go back, and we\'ll do lines for you, but for\r\ngoodness\' sake don\'t send us up to him."\r\n\r\n"We had no warning, you see," said Stutter, "that things were changed."\r\n\r\n"Go back, then," said Bloomfield, "and make up your minds unless you\r\nkeep rules you\'ll get treated just the same as any other rowdies.  I\r\nwon\'t report you this time, but you\'d better take care what you do."\r\n\r\nThis little incident made a remarkable impression, not only on the two\r\nboys immediately concerned, but on the school generally.  For it soon\r\ngot noised about, and no public proclamation could have made the state\r\nof Bloomfield\'s mind clearer.\r\n\r\nBut a day or two later the last glimmer of doubt was removed by the\r\nproceedings which took place in that august assembly, the Willoughby\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nHonourable members assembled in large numbers, as they always did after\r\nany special school excitement, and even had this inducement been\r\nlacking, the significant sentence, "Resignation of Mr Bloomfield--\r\nElection of President," on the notice-board would have sufficed to pack\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nRiddell had implored Bloomfield not to take this step, or at least to\r\ndefer it to the beginning of the next term.  But he might as well have\r\npleaded with a lamp-post.  The Parrett\'s captain was inexorable.\r\n\r\n"No," said he; "if it was the last day of the term I\'d do it.  It would\r\nserve me right if I was kicked round the school for sticking there so\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nBefore the business began Crossfield rose and asked to be allowed to put\r\na question.  This was the signal for a general buzz of anticipation\r\nwhich was not lessened by the sight of Messrs. Game and Ashley looking\r\nvery uncomfortable where they sat.\r\n\r\n"I should like to ask Mr Game, whom I see present, if he will kindly\r\nreport to the House the proceedings of the last special meeting, which\r\nhe summoned in the interests of the honour of the school.  I hope the\r\ngentleman will speak out, as we are all anxious to hear him."\r\n\r\nGame blushed up to the roots of his hair, and dug his hands in his\r\npocket, and tried to look as unconcerned as possible at the laughter\r\nwhich greeted this innocent question.\r\n\r\nAs he made no offer to reply, Crossfield thereupon regaled the House\r\nwith a highly facetious report of that famous meeting, amid much\r\nlaughter and cheers, not a few of which were directed to the heroic\r\n"Skyrockets."  This little diversion being at an end, it was suggested\r\nby the Chair that perhaps the matter might now drop, which, greatly to\r\nthe relief of the discomfited ex-monitors, it accordingly did, and after\r\na few other questions the orders of the day were reached.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Bloomfield, rising and speaking nervously, but\r\nresolutely, "you will see by the notice-paper that I am going to resign\r\nthe office of President of the Willoughby Parliament.  (No, no.)\r\nGentlemen, there\'s a proverb which says, `It\'s never too late to mend.\'\r\nThat\'s the principle on which I am doing this now.  I\'ve been in this\r\nchair under false pretences.  (No, no.)  I was elected here under false\r\npretences.  (No, no.)  I was a fool to let myself be elected, and I\'m\r\nashamed of myself now.  Gentlemen, I am _not_ the captain of Willoughby!\r\nI never was; and I had no more right to be than any fag present.  (Loud\r\ncheers from Parson, Telson, Cusack, and others.)  The only thing I can\r\ndo now, gentlemen, to show how ashamed I am, is to resign.  And I do\r\nresign.  For goodness\' sake, gentlemen, let\'s be done with the folly\r\nthat\'s been working the very mischief in Willoughby all this term.  I\r\nknow I\'ve been as bad as any one, so I\'ve no right to abuse any one.\r\nBut we\'ve time to pull ourselves right yet.  It wants three clear weeks\r\nto the holidays.  (Groans from Bosher.)  In three weeks, if we choose,\r\nwe can make the old school what it was the day old Wyndham left.\r\n(Cheers.)  We\'ve had more than folly among us this term.  We\'ve had foul\r\nplay--thank goodness no one here was concerned in that.  We don\'t want\r\nto kick fellows that are down, but now they\'ve gone our chance of\r\npulling up is all the better, and we\'ll do it.  (Cheers.)  I said the\r\nonly thing I could do to atone for my folly was to resign.  No,\r\ngentlemen, there is something else I can do, and will do.  I propose\r\nthat the captain of Willoughby be elected our President!  (Cheers.)\r\nHe\'s a jolly good fellow, gentlemen--(cheers)--and I can tell you this\r\n(and I\'m not given to romancing), if it hadn\'t been for him, gentlemen,\r\nthere would have been scarcely anything of Willoughby left to pick up."\r\n\r\nBloomfield, whose spirited address had carried his audience by storm, as\r\nonly a genuine, hearty outburst can, sat down amid tremendous cheers.\r\nThe school had fast been coming round to his way of thinking, but it had\r\nwanted some one to give it utterance.  Riddell, in his speech a week or\r\ntwo ago, had hit the right nail on the head, and now Bloomfield had\r\ndriven it home.\r\n\r\nWhen presently the applause subsided, young Wyndham was discovered, all\r\nexcitement and eagerness, trying to be heard.\r\n\r\n"I want to second that!" he cried, in a voice that positively trembled.\r\n"I\'m only a Limpet, and I\'ve been in lots of rows, but you none of you\r\nknow what a brick he is.  Gentlemen, he\'s worth the lot of us put\r\ntogether!  I mean it.  If you only knew what he\'s done for me, you\'d say\r\nso.  I\'m in a row now."  ("Hear! hear!" from Cusack.) "I\'m detained all\r\nthe rest of the term.  (Cheers from Bosher.)  I can\'t play in the\r\nsecond-eleven next week--(loud laughter)--but, gentlemen, I don\'t care a\r\nhang now old Riddell\'s put where he ought to be, at the head of the\r\nschool--(applause)--and I\'m proud to be allowed to second it."\r\n\r\nThis was no ordinary meeting truly.  No sooner was Wyndham done, but\r\nTelson leapt on his form, and shouted,--\r\n\r\n"On behalf of the kids--(laughter)--I third that.  (Laughter.)  I don\'t\r\nknow what you\'re grinning at--(laughter)--but, I can tell you, we all\r\nmean to back him up.  (Loud cheers.)  That\'s all I\'ve got to say!"\r\n\r\nOther speeches followed, equally cordial, from Fairbairn and the\r\ncaptain\'s old schoolhouse friends, and even from some unexpected\r\nquarters where every one supposed the old partisanship still lurked.\r\n\r\nAmid much enthusiasm Riddell was elected President, and duly installed\r\nby his old rival.\r\n\r\nThen there were loud calls for "A speech!" from the captain.  It was\r\nlong before he could sufficiently overcome his nervousness to attempt\r\nit, but at last he said--or rather stammered--amidst the enthusiasm of\r\nthe meeting, "I am much obliged, gentlemen.  I wish Bloomfield had kept\r\nthe post.  I\'m afraid I sha\'n\'t make a good President.  Gentlemen, if we\r\ngo on as we have begun to-day the captain of Willoughby will have\r\nnothing to do.  The old school is looking up fast.  (Cheers.)  Now we\r\nare all pulling one way, I should like to see what can stop us!  But I\r\nreally can\'t make a speech now.  If you knew all I feel--but there, I\r\nshall only break down if I try to go on, so I\'d better stop."\r\n\r\nAnd thus Willoughby returned once more to her right mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nWILLOUGHBY HERSELF AGAIN.\r\n\r\nIt was the day of the Templeton match, and all Willoughby had once more\r\nturned out into the Big to watch the achievements of its heroes.\r\n\r\nYet it was not so much the cricket that fellows crowded out to see.  Of\r\ncourse, the contest between the second-eleven and Templeton was\r\nmoderately interesting.  But it was not of the first importance, and\r\nWilloughby might have survived had it been deprived of the pleasure of\r\nwitnessing it.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasure of witnessing old Wyndham umpiring for the old school\r\nin the very Big where his own mighty victories had been achieved, was\r\nquite another matter; and in honour of this event it was that Willoughby\r\nturned out in a body and watched the Templeton match.\r\n\r\nThe old captain had not much altered in the few weeks since he had left\r\nWilloughby.  His whiskers had not had time to grow, and he even wore the\r\nsame flannel jacket he had on at the athletic sports in May.  But in the\r\neyes of the boys he might have been no longer a man, but a demi-god,\r\nwith such awe and reverence did they behold him.\r\n\r\nHe had lately scored one hundred and five for the Colts of his county,\r\nand had even been selected to play in the eleven against M.C.C. next\r\nweek.  What he might not achieve when he went up to Oxford in the autumn\r\nno one could say, but that he would be stroke of the eight and captain\r\nof the fifteen, and carry off all the events in the next University\r\nathletics, no one at the school ventured to doubt for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe Templeton boys hardly knew what to make of all this demonstration in\r\nfavour of their opponents\' umpire, and it added considerably to their\r\nnervousness to hear loud cries of "Well umpired, sir!" when any one was\r\ngiven out.\r\n\r\nParson and Telson, having taken the precaution to send Bosher and\r\nLawkins early in the day to keep seats for them on the round bench under\r\nthe schoolhouse elms, viewed the match luxuriously, and not a little to\r\nthe envy of other juniors, who had to stand or sit on the ground where\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\n"Boshy play, you know," says Telson, helping himself to monkey-nuts out\r\nof Parson\'s hospitable pocket; "but it\'s stunning to see the way old\r\nWynd. gives middle.  Any one else would take double the time over it."\r\n\r\n"Right you are!  And he\'s awfully fair too.  See the neat way he gave\r\nForbes out leg before, just now!"\r\n\r\n"There\'s another two for Tedbury.  We\'ll cheer him next time.  Hullo,\r\nBosher, old man! you needn\'t be coming here.  There\'s no room; we\'re\r\nfull up."\r\n\r\n"You might let us sit down a bit," says Bosher; "I kept the seat from\r\nhalf-past ten to twelve for you."\r\n\r\n"Jolly muff not to sit down, then, when you had the chance.  Jolly gross\r\nconduct of the evil Bosher, eh, Telson?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!  He\'s small in the world, but he\'d better get out of the light,\r\nmy boy, or he\'ll catch it!"\r\n\r\nBosher subsides at this point, and the two friends resume their divided\r\ninterest in the match, and old Wyndham, and the monkey-nuts.\r\n\r\nPresently two familiar forms saunter past, arm-in-arm.\r\n\r\n"There go Riddell and Bloomfield," says Parson.  "Awfully chummy they\'ve\r\ngot, haven\'t they?  Different from what it used to be!"\r\n\r\n"So it is," says Parson.  "Not nearly as much chance of a lark.  But\r\nperhaps it\'s no harm; it keeps those Welcher kids quiet."\r\n\r\n"More than it\'s doing just now!  Look at the way young Cusack is\r\nbellowing over there!  He\'s as mad on this match as if he was in the\r\neleven."\r\n\r\n"So he expects to be, some day.  But they\'re not going to have it all\r\ntheir own way in Welch\'s again.  Our club\'s going ahead like blazes now,\r\nand we\'ve challenged them for a return match the day before break-up."\r\n\r\n"There\'s Tedbury out," says Telson.  "Twenty runs he\'s made--not a bad\r\nscore.  We\'d better cheer him, I say."\r\n\r\nAnd the two grandees suit the action to the word, and rejoice the heart\r\nof Tedbury as he retires to the tent, by their lusty applause.\r\n\r\nThe Willoughbites do not do badly as a whole.  A few of them, either\r\nthrough incompetence or terror at the presence of old Wyndham, fail to\r\nbreak their duck\'s-eggs, but the others among them put together the\r\nrespectable score of one hundred and five--the identical figures, by the\r\nway, which Wyndham scored off his own bat the other day in the Colts\'\r\nmatch of his county.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval there is a general incursion of spectators into the\r\nground, and a stampede by the more enthusiastic to the tent where the\r\ngreat umpire is known to be "on show" for a short time.\r\n\r\nAmongst others, Parson and Telson incautiously quit their seats, which\r\nare promptly "bagged" by Bosher and Lawkins, who have had their eyes on\r\nthem all the morning, and are determined now, at any rate, to take the\r\nreward of their patience, and hold them against all comers.\r\n\r\nThe crowd in the tent has not a long time wherein to feast its eyes on\r\nthe old captain, for Willoughby goes out to field almost at once, and\r\nTempleton\'s innings begins.  Whatever may have been the case with the\r\nschool, Templeton seems quite unable to perform under the eyes of the\r\ngreat "M.C.C." man, and wicket after wicket falls in rapid succession,\r\nuntil with the miserable total of fifty-one they finally retire for this\r\ninnings.\r\n\r\n"A follow-on," says Game, who from near the tent is patronisingly\r\nlooking on, in company with Ashley, Tipper, and Wibberly.  "I suppose\r\nthey ought to do them in one innings now?"\r\n\r\n"Ought to try," says Tipper.  "Some of these kids play fairly well."\r\n\r\n"They get well coached, that\'s what it is.  What with Bloomfield, and\r\nFairbairn, and Mr Parrett, they\'ve been drilled, and no mistake."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see," says Wibberly, "there are five Parretts in the eleven,\r\naren\'t there."\r\n\r\nAshley laughs.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t fancy any one thought of counting," says he.  "Perhaps we\'d\r\nbetter not, or it may turn out as bad for us as in the Rockshire match."\r\n\r\n"After all," says Tipper, "I\'m just as glad those rows are over.  We\'re\r\nnone the worse off now."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not," says Game, a little doubtfully; "and Bloomfield and\r\nhe are such friends.  It\'s just as well to keep in with the captain."\r\n\r\n"Not very difficult either," says Ashley.\r\n\r\n"He\'s friendly enough, and doesn\'t seem to have any grudge.  He told me\r\nhe hoped I\'d be on the monitors\' list again next term."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m having a shot at that too," says Game.  "Ah, it is a follow-on,\r\nthen.  There go our fellows to field again."\r\n\r\nJust as the second innings of Templeton is half-over, a melancholy\r\nfigure crosses the Big from the school and makes its way to the tent.\r\nIt is young Wyndham, whose half-hour\'s liberty has come round at last,\r\nand who now has come to witness the achievements of that second-eleven\r\nin which, alas! he may not play.\r\n\r\nHowever, he does not waste his time in growling, but cheers vociferously\r\nevery piece of good fielding, and his voice becomes an inspiriting\r\nfeature of the innings.  But you can see, by the way he is constantly\r\nlooking at his watch, that his liberty is limited, and that soon, like\r\nCinderella at midnight, he must vanish once more into obscurity.  He\r\nknows to half a second how long it takes him to run from the tent to the\r\nschoolhouse, and at one minute and twelve seconds to six, whatever he is\r\ndoing, he will bolt like mad to his quarters.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, his time is half-over the captain joins him.\r\n\r\n"Well, old man," says the latter, "I wish you were playing.  It\'s hard\r\nlines for you."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit--(Well thrown up, Gamble!)--not a bit hard lines," says the\r\nboy.  "Lucky for me I\'m here at all to see the match."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'ll be all right next term," says the captain.  "I say, it\r\nwould have done you good to see the cheer your brother got when he\r\nturned up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I heard it," said the boy.  "Fairbairn lets me stick in his study--\r\nthat window there, that looks right through the gap in the elms, so I\r\ncan see most of what\'s going on--(Now then, sir, pick it up there;\r\nfielded indeed!)"\r\n\r\nThe match is nearly over, and it looks as if Wyndham will be able to see\r\nthe end of it.  Nine wickets are down for forty-nine, and five runs must\r\nyet be scored to save Templeton from a single-innings defeat.\r\n\r\nThe last man begins ominously, for he makes two off his first ball.\r\nWilloughby presses round, breathless, to watch the next.  It whizzes\r\nover the wicket, but does no harm.  The next ball--one of Forbes\'s\r\nshooters--strikes on the batsman\'s pad.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that, umpire?" yells every one.\r\n\r\n"Not out!" says old Wyndham.\r\n\r\nThe next ball comes--but before it has left the bowler\'s hand young\r\nWyndham has begun to run.  Loud shouts and laughter follow his headlong\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n"Well run, sir; put it on!" scream Parson and Telson.\r\n\r\n"Stop thief!" howl Bosher and his friends.\r\n\r\n"He\'s gaining, there!  Pull yourself together!" cry Cusack and Pilbury.\r\n\r\nHeedless of these familiar cheers--for lately this has been a daily\r\nperformance--Wyndham saves his honour at two seconds to six, the\r\nidentical moment when Forbes\'s last ball sends the Templeton bails\r\nflying high over long-stop\'s head, and Willoughby is proclaimed winner\r\nof the match by one innings and three runs.\r\n\r\nA jovial party assembles an hour later for "high tea" in the captain\'s\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nFairbairn, Coates, Porter, and Crossfield are there, and Bloomfield and\r\nRiddell, and the two Wyndhams, and assuredly a cheerier party never sat\r\ndown in Willoughby.\r\n\r\n"I never expected to find you a Welcher," says old Wyndham to the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n"No?  A fellow\'s sure to find his level, you see, some day," replied\r\nRiddell, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but the thing is, Welch\'s is coming up to his level," says\r\nBloomfield, "instead of his going down to Welch\'s."\r\n\r\n"I should say," says young Wyndham, blushing a little to hear his own\r\nvoice before this imposing assembly, "all Willoughby\'s coming up to his\r\nlevel!"\r\n\r\n"The young \'un\'s right, though he is a Limpet," says Crossfield.  "I had\r\nmy doubts of old Riddell once, but I\'ve more doubts about myself than\r\nhim now."\r\n\r\n"You know, Wynd.," says Porter, "we\'re such a happy family, I shouldn\'t\r\nwonder if I forget before long what house I belong to."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you\'re reminded of that, my boy, before the house football\r\nmatches next term," says Fairbairn, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Yes," says the old captain, "you\'ll be a poor show if you don\'t stick\r\nup for your own house."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know," says Porter, "we\'ve had such a lot of sticking up\r\nfor our own houses this term, that I\'m rather sick of it."\r\n\r\n"Sticking up for ourselves, you mean," says Bloomfield, "that\'s where\r\none or two I could name went wrong."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," says Coates, "that sticking up for your house, and\r\nsticking up for your school, and sticking up for yourself, are none of\r\nthem bad things."\r\n\r\n"But," says old Wyndham, "unless you put them in the right order they\r\nmay do more harm than good."\r\n\r\n"And what do you say the right order is?" asks Crossfield.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course, Willoughby first, your house next, and yourself last."\r\n\r\n"In other words," says the captain, "if you stick up for Willoughby you\r\ncan save yourself any trouble about the other two, for they are both\r\nincluded in the good of the old school.  At least, that\'s my notion!"\r\n\r\nAnd with what better notion could we say good-bye to the Willoughby\r\nCaptains?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Willoughby Captains, by Talbot Baines Reed\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WILLOUGHBY CAPTAINS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21044.txt or 21044.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/0/4/21044/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
