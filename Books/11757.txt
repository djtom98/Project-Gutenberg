At Last!\r\n  _________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nHERE was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really\r\nsplendid. He was fat and bunchy, as a rabbit should be; his coat was\r\nspotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears\r\nwere lined with pink sateen. On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged\r\nin the top of the Boy\'s stocking, with a sprig of holly between his\r\npaws, the effect was charming.\r\n\r\nThere were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy\r\nengine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit\r\nwas quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him,\r\nand then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner, and there was a great\r\nrustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the\r\nexcitement of looking at all the new presents the Velveteen Rabbit was\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n                          Christmas Morning\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor,\r\nand no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy, and\r\nbeing only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite\r\nsnubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior, and looked down\r\nupon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended\r\nthey were real. The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and\r\nlost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an\r\nopportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit\r\ncould not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn\'t know that\r\nreal rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust\r\nlike himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and\r\nshould never be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed\r\nwooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have\r\nhad broader views, put on airs and pretended he was connected with\r\nGovernment. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel\r\nhimself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who\r\nwas kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.\r\n\r\nThe Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.\r\nHe was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the\r\nseams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled\r\nout to string bead necklaces. He was wise, for he had seen a long\r\nsuccession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and\r\nby-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they\r\nwere only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery\r\nmagic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that\r\nare old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n"What is REAL?" asked the Rabbit one day, when they were lying side by\r\nside near the nursery fender, before Nana came to tidy the room. "Does\r\nit mean having things that buzz inside you and a stick-out handle?"\r\n\r\n"Real isn\'t how you are made," said the Skin Horse. "It\'s a thing that\r\nhappens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just\r\nto play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real."\r\n\r\n"Does it hurt?" asked the Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes," said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. "When\r\nyou are Real you don\'t mind being hurt."\r\n\r\n"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up," he asked, "or bit\r\nby bit?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t happen all at once," said the Skin Horse. "You become. It\r\ntakes a long time. That\'s why it doesn\'t happen often to people who\r\nbreak easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.\r\nGenerally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved\r\noff, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very\r\nshabby. But these things don\'t matter at all, because once you are\r\nReal you can\'t be ugly, except to people who don\'t understand."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you are real?" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had\r\nnot said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the\r\nSkin Horse only smiled.\r\n\r\n                    The Skin Horse Tells His Story\r\n\r\n"The Boy\'s Uncle made me Real," he said. "That was a great many years\r\nago; but once you are Real you can\'t become unreal again. It lasts for\r\nalways."\r\n\r\nThe Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this\r\nmagic called Real happened to him. He longed to become Real, to know\r\nwhat it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his\r\neyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it\r\nwithout these uncomfortable things happening to him.\r\n\r\nThere was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery. Sometimes she\r\ntook no notice of the playthings lying about, and sometimes, for no\r\nreason whatever, she went swooping about like a great wind and hustled\r\nthem away in cupboards. She called this "tidying up," and the\r\nplaythings all hated it, especially the tin ones. The Rabbit didn\'t\r\nmind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft.\r\n\r\nOne evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn\'t find the china\r\ndog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry, and it was too\r\nmuch trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked\r\nabout her, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made\r\na swoop.\r\n\r\n"Here," she said, "take your old Bunny! He\'ll do to sleep with you!"\r\nAnd she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear, and put him into the Boy\'s\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThat night, and for many nights after, the Velveteen Rabbit slept in\r\nthe Boy\'s bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy\r\nhugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and\r\nsometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could\r\nscarcely breathe. And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in\r\nthe nursery, when all the house was silent, and his talks with the\r\nSkin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk\r\nto him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he\r\nsaid were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in. And they had\r\nsplendid games together, in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her\r\nsupper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when\r\nthe Boy dropped off to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close\r\nunder his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy\'s hands clasped\r\nclose round him all night long.\r\n\r\nAnd so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy-so happy\r\nthat he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting\r\nshabbier and shabbier, and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink\r\nrubbed off his nose where the Boy had kissed him.\r\n\r\nSpring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the\r\nBoy went the Rabbit went too. He had rides in the wheelbarrow, and\r\npicnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the\r\nraspberry canes behind the flower border. And once, when the Boy was\r\ncalled away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the\r\nlawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with\r\nthe candle because the Boy couldn\'t go to sleep unless he was there.\r\nHe was wet through with the dew and quite earthy from diving into the\r\nburrows the Boy had made for him in the flower bed, and Nana grumbled\r\nas she rubbed him off with a corner of her apron.\r\n\r\n                             Spring Time\r\n\r\n"You must have your old Bunny!" she said. "Fancy all that fuss for a\r\ntoy!"\r\n\r\nThe Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands.\r\n\r\n"Give me my Bunny!" he said. "You mustn\'t say that. He isn\'t a toy.\r\nHe\'s REAL!"\r\n\r\nWhen the little Rabbit heard that he was happy, for he knew that what\r\nthe Skin Horse had said was true at last. The nursery magic had\r\nhappened to him, and he was a toy no longer. He was Real. The Boy\r\nhimself had said it.\r\n\r\nThat night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred\r\nin his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his\r\nboot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a\r\nlook of wisdom and beauty, so that even Nana noticed it next morning\r\nwhen she picked him up, and said, "I declare if that old Bunny hasn\'t\r\ngot quite a knowing expression!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was a wonderful Summer!\r\n\r\nNear the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June\r\nevenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play. He took the\r\nVelveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered off to pick flowers,\r\nor play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a\r\nlittle nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy,\r\nfor he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be\r\ncomfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone,\r\nwatching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the\r\ngrass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThey were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new. They\r\nmust have been very well made, for their seams didn\'t show at all, and\r\nthey changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they\r\nwere long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy, instead of\r\nalways staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the\r\nground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses,\r\nwhile the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck\r\nout, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind\r\nthem up. But he couldn\'t see it. They were evidently a new kind of\r\nrabbit altogether.\r\n\r\n                             Summer Days\r\n\r\nThey stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the\r\ntime their noses twitched.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you get up and play with us?" one of them asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel like it," said the Rabbit, for he didn\'t want to explain\r\nthat he had no clockwork.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" said the furry rabbit. "It\'s as easy as anything," And he gave a\r\nbig hop sideways and stood on his hind legs.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe you can!" he said.\r\n\r\n"I can!" said the little Rabbit. "I can jump higher than anything!" He\r\nmeant when the Boy threw him, but of course he didn\'t want to say so.\r\n\r\n"Can you hop on your hind legs?" asked the furry rabbit.\r\n\r\nThat was a dreadful question, for the Velveteen Rabbit had no hind\r\nlegs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a\r\npincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other\r\nrabbits wouldn\'t notice.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to!" he said again.\r\n\r\nBut the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out\r\nhis neck and looked.\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t got any hind legs!" he called out. "Fancy a rabbit without\r\nany hind legs!" And he began to laugh.\r\n\r\n"I have!" cried the little Rabbit. "I have got hind legs! I am sitting\r\non them!"\r\n\r\n"Then stretch them out and show me, like this!" said the wild rabbit.\r\nAnd he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got\r\nquite dizzy.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like dancing," he said. "I\'d rather sit still!"\r\n\r\nBut all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly\r\nfeeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the\r\nworld to be able to jump about like these rabbits did.\r\n\r\nThe strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so\r\nclose this time that his long whiskers brushed the Velveteen Rabbit\'s\r\near, and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and\r\njumped backwards.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t smell right!" he exclaimed. "He isn\'t a rabbit at all! He\r\nisn\'t real!"\r\n\r\n"I am Real!" said the little Rabbit. "I am Real! The Boy said so!" And\r\nhe nearly began to cry.\r\n\r\nJust then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near\r\nthem, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two\r\nstrange rabbits disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Come back and play with me!" called the little Rabbit. "Oh, do come\r\nback! I know I am Real!"\r\n\r\nBut there was no answer, only the little ants ran to and fro, and the\r\nbracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The\r\nVelveteen Rabbit was all alone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" he thought. "Why did they run away like that? Why couldn\'t\r\nthey stop and talk to me?"\r\n\r\nFor a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping\r\nthat they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the\r\nsun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy\r\ncame and carried him home.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the\r\nBoy loved him just as much. He loved him so hard that he loved all his\r\nwhiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey, and his\r\nbrown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely\r\nlooked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy. To him he was always\r\nbeautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He\r\ndidn\'t mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic\r\nhad made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn\'t matter.\r\n\r\nAnd then, one day, the Boy was ill.\r\n\r\nHis face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little\r\nbody was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close.\r\nStrange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all\r\nnight and through it all the little Velveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden\r\nfrom sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was\r\nafraid that if they found him some one might take him away, and he\r\nknew that the Boy needed him.\r\n\r\nIt was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play, and the\r\nlittle Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long.\r\nBut he snuggled down patiently, and looked forward to the time when\r\nthe Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden\r\namongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the\r\nraspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he\r\nplanned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the\r\npillow and whispered them in his ear. And presently the fever turned,\r\nand the Boy got better. He was able to sit up in bed and look at\r\npicture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And\r\none day, they let him get up and dress.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open. They\r\nhad carried the Boy out on to the balcony, wrapped in a shawl, and the\r\nlittle Rabbit lay tangled up among the bedclothes, thinking.\r\n\r\nThe Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow. Everything was arranged,\r\nand now it only remained to carry out the doctor\'s orders. They talked\r\nabout it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with\r\njust his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be\r\ndisinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with\r\nin bed must be burnt.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" thought the little Rabbit. "To-morrow we shall go to the\r\nseaside!" For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted\r\nvery much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the\r\nsand castles.\r\n\r\nJust then Nana caught sight of him.\r\n\r\n"How about his old Bunny?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"That?" said the doctor. "Why, it\'s a mass of scarlet fever\r\ngerms!-Burn it at once. What? Nonsense! Get him a new one. He mustn\'t\r\nhave that any more!"\r\n\r\n                            Anxious Times\r\n\r\nAnd so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old\r\npicture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the\r\ngarden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire,\r\nonly the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it. He had the\r\npotatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he\r\npromised to come quite early and burn the whole lot.\r\n\r\nThat night the Boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new\r\nbunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny, all white plush with\r\nreal glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about\r\nit. For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was\r\nsuch a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\nAnd while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little\r\nRabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the\r\nfowl-house, and he felt very lonely. The sack had been left untied,\r\nand so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the\r\nopening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always\r\nbeen used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had\r\nworn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any\r\nprotection to him. Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry\r\ncanes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow\r\nhe had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those\r\nlong sunlit hours in the garden-how happy they were-and a great\r\nsadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each\r\nmore beautiful than the other, the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the\r\nquiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little\r\nants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he\r\nwas Real. He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all\r\nthat he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one\'s\r\nbeauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real\r\ntear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAnd then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a\r\nflower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower, not at all like\r\nany that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of\r\nemeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup.\r\nIt was so beautiful that the little Rabbit forgot to cry, and just lay\r\nthere watching it. And presently the blossom opened, and out of it\r\nthere stepped a fairy.\r\n\r\nShe was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of\r\npearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her\r\nhair, and her face was like the most perfect flower of all. And she\r\ncame close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and\r\nkissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying.\r\n\r\n"Little Rabbit," she said, "don\'t you know who I am?"\r\n\r\nThe Rabbit looked up at her, and it seemed to him that he had seen her\r\nface before, but he couldn\'t think where.\r\n\r\n"I am the nursery magic Fairy," she said. "I take care of all the\r\nplaythings that the children have loved. When they are old and worn\r\nout and the children don\'t need them any more, then I come and take\r\nthem away with me and turn them into Real."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t I Real before?" asked the little Rabbit.\r\n\r\n"You were Real to the Boy," the Fairy said, "because he loved you. Now\r\nyou shall be Real to every one."\r\n\r\n                           The Fairy Flower\r\n\r\nAnd she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him\r\ninto the wood.\r\n\r\nIt was light now, for the moon had risen. All the forest was\r\nbeautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver. In\r\nthe open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with\r\ntheir shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they\r\nall stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve brought you a new playfellow," the Fairy said. "You must be very\r\nkind to him and teach him all he needs to know in Rabbit-land, for he\r\nis going to live with you for ever and ever!"\r\n\r\nAnd she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass.\r\n\r\n"Run and play, little Rabbit!" she said.\r\n\r\nBut the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.\r\nFor when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly\r\nremembered about his hind legs, and he didn\'t want them to see that he\r\nwas made all in one piece. He did not know that when the Fairy kissed\r\nhim that last time she had changed him altogether. And he might have\r\nsat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn\'t\r\ntickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted\r\nhis hind toe to scratch it.\r\n\r\nAnd he found that he actually had hind legs! Instead of dingy\r\nvelveteen he had brown fur, soft and shiny, his ears twitched by\r\nthemselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass.\r\nHe gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great\r\nthat he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and\r\nwhirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at\r\nlast he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone.\r\n\r\nHe was a Real Rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          At Last! At Last!\r\n\r\nAutumn passed and Winter, and in the Spring, when the days grew warm\r\nand sunny, the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And\r\nwhile he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and\r\npeeped at him. One of them was brown all over, but the other had\r\nstrange markings under his fur, as though long ago he had been\r\nspotted, and the spots still showed through. And about his little soft\r\nnose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that\r\nthe Boy thought to himself:\r\n\r\n"Why, he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet\r\nfever!"\r\n\r\nBut he never knew that it really was his own Bunny, come back to look\r\nat the child who had first helped him to be Real.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE VELVETEEN RABBIT***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 11757.txt or 11757.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/7/5/11757\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n'
