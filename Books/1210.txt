Although certain vowels\r\nbecome nearly \xe2\x80\x9csilent\xe2\x80\x9d in some environments, this phenomenon can be\r\nsafely ignored for the purpose at hand.\r\n\r\nConsonants roughly approximate their corresponding sounds in English,\r\nexcept for r, which is actually somewhere between r and l (this is why\r\nthe Japanese have trouble distinguishing between English r and l), and\r\nf, which is much closer to h.\r\n\r\nThe spelling \xe2\x80\x9cKWAIDAN\xe2\x80\x9d is based on premodern Japanese pronunciation;\r\nwhen Hearn came to Japan, the orthography reflecting this pronunciation\r\nwas still in use. In modern Japanese the word is pronounced KAIDAN.\r\n\r\nThere are many ellipses in the text. Hearn often used them in this\r\nbook; they do not represent omissions by the digitizer.\r\n\r\nAuthor\xe2\x80\x99s original notes are in brackets, those by the digitizer are in\r\nparentheses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n KWAIDAN\r\n THE STORY OF MIMI-NASHI-H\xc5\x8c\xc3\x8fCHI\r\n OSHIDORI\r\n THE STORY OF O-TEI\r\n UBAZAKURA\r\n DIPLOMACY\r\n OF A MIRROR AND A BELL\r\n JIKININKI\r\n MUJINA\r\n ROKURO-KUBI\r\n A DEAD SECRET\r\n YUKI-ONNA\r\n THE STORY OF AOYAGI\r\n JIU-ROKU-ZAKURA\r\n THE DREAM OF AKINOSUK\xc3\x89\r\n RIKI-BAKA\r\n HI-MAWARI\r\n H\xc5\x8cRAI\r\n\r\n INSECT STUDIES\r\n BUTTERFLIES\r\n MOSQUITOES\r\n ANTS\r\n\r\n Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrations\r\n\r\n BLOWING HER BREATH UPON HIM\r\n BUTTERFLY DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of a new volume of Lafcadio Hearn\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite studies\r\nof Japan happens, by a delicate irony, to fall in the very month when\r\nthe world is waiting with tense expectation for news of the latest\r\nexploits of Japanese battleships. Whatever the outcome of the present\r\nstruggle between Russia and Japan, its significance lies in the fact\r\nthat a nation of the East, equipped with Western weapons and girding\r\nitself with Western energy of will, is deliberately measuring strength\r\nagainst one of the great powers of the Occident. No one is wise enough\r\nto forecast the results of such a conflict upon the civilization of the\r\nworld. The best one can do is to estimate, as intelligently as\r\npossible, the national characteristics of the peoples engaged, basing\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s hopes and fears upon the psychology of the two races rather than\r\nupon purely political and statistical studies of the complicated\r\nquestions involved in the present war. The Russian people have had\r\nliterary spokesmen who for more than a generation have fascinated the\r\nEuropean audience. The Japanese, on the other hand, have possessed no\r\nsuch national and universally recognized figures as Turgenieff or\r\nTolstoy. They need an interpreter.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether any oriental race has ever had an interpreter\r\ngifted with more perfect insight and sympathy than Lafcadio Hearn has\r\nbrought to the translation of Japan into our occidental speech. His\r\nlong residence in that country, his flexibility of mind, poetic\r\nimagination, and wonderfully pellucid style have fitted him for the\r\nmost delicate of literary tasks. He has seen marvels, and he has told\r\nof them in a marvelous way. There is scarcely an aspect of contemporary\r\nJapanese life, scarcely an element in the social, political, and\r\nmilitary questions involved in the present conflict with Russia which\r\nis not made clear in one or another of the books with which he has\r\ncharmed American readers.\r\n\r\nHe characterizes Kwaidan as \xe2\x80\x9cstories and studies of strange things.\xe2\x80\x9d A\r\nhundred thoughts suggested by the book might be written down, but most\r\nof them would begin and end with this fact of strangeness. To read the\r\nvery names in the table of contents is like listening to a Buddhist\r\nbell, struck somewhere far away. Some of his tales are of the long ago,\r\nand yet they seem to illumine the very souls and minds of the little\r\nmen who are at this hour crowding the decks of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s armored\r\ncruisers. But many of the stories are about women and children,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlovely materials from which the best fairy tales of the world have been\r\nwoven. They too are strange, these Japanese maidens and wives and\r\nkeen-eyed, dark-haired girls and boys; they are like us and yet not\r\nlike us; and the sky and the hills and the flowers are all different\r\nfrom ours. Yet by a magic of which Mr. Hearn, almost alone among\r\ncontemporary writers, is the master, in these delicate, transparent,\r\nghostly sketches of a world unreal to us, there is a haunting sense of\r\nspiritual reality.\r\n\r\nIn a penetrating and beautiful essay contributed to the \xe2\x80\x9cAtlantic\r\nMonthly\xe2\x80\x9d in February, 1903, by Paul Elmer More, the secret of Mr.\r\nHearn\xe2\x80\x99s magic is said to lie in the fact that in his art is found \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nmeeting of three ways.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo the religious instinct of India\xe2\x80\x94Buddhism in\r\nparticular,\xe2\x80\x94which history has engrafted on the a\xc3\xa6sthetic sense of\r\nJapan, Mr. Hearn brings the interpreting spirit of occidental science;\r\nand these three traditions are fused by the peculiar sympathies of his\r\nmind into one rich and novel compound,\xe2\x80\x94a compound so rare as to have\r\nintroduced into literature a psychological sensation unknown before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. More\xe2\x80\x99s essay received the high praise of Mr. Hearn\xe2\x80\x99s recognition\r\nand gratitude, and if it were possible to reprint it here, it would\r\nprovide a most suggestive introduction to these new stories of old\r\nJapan, whose substance is, as Mr. More has said, \xe2\x80\x9cso strangely mingled\r\ntogether out of the austere dreams of India and the subtle beauty of\r\nJapan and the relentless science of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_March_, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the following _Kwaidan_, or Weird Tales, have been taken from\r\nold Japanese books,\xe2\x80\x94such as the _Yas\xc5\x8d-Kidan_, _Bukky\xc5\x8d-Hyakkwa-Zensh\xc5\x8d_,\r\n_Kokon-Chomonsh\xc5\xab_, _Tama-Sudar\xc3\xa9_, and _Hyaku-Monogatari_. Some of the\r\nstories may have had a Chinese origin: the very remarkable \xe2\x80\x9cDream of\r\nAkinosuk\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, is certainly from a Chinese source. But the\r\nstory-teller, in every case, has so recolored and reshaped his\r\nborrowing as to naturalize it... One queer tale, \xe2\x80\x9cYuki-Onna,\xe2\x80\x9d was told\r\nme by a farmer of Ch\xc5\x8dfu, Nishitama-g\xc5\x8dri, in Musashi province, as a\r\nlegend of his native village. Whether it has ever been written in\r\nJapanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records\r\nused certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious\r\nforms... The incident of \xe2\x80\x9cRiki-Baka\xe2\x80\x9d was a personal experience; and I\r\nwrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a\r\nfamily-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.\r\n\r\nL. H.\r\n\r\nT\xc5\x8cKY\xc5\x8c, JAPAN, January 20th, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKWAIDAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF MIMI-NASHI-H\xc5\x8c\xc3\x8fCHI\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than seven hundred years ago, at Dan-no-ura, in the Straits of\r\nShimonos\xc3\xa9ki, was fought the last battle of the long contest between the\r\nHeik\xc3\xa9, or Taira clan, and the Genji, or Minamoto clan. There the Heik\xc3\xa9\r\nperished utterly, with their women and children, and their infant\r\nemperor likewise\xe2\x80\x94now remembered as Antoku Tenn\xc5\x8d. And that sea and shore\r\nhave been haunted for seven hundred years... Elsewhere I told you about\r\nthe strange crabs found there, called Heik\xc3\xa9 crabs, which have human\r\nfaces on their backs, and are said to be the spirits of the Heik\xc3\xa9\r\nwarriors[1]. But there are many strange things to be seen and heard\r\nalong that coast. On dark nights thousands of ghostly fires hover about\r\nthe beach, or flit above the waves,\xe2\x80\x94pale lights which the fishermen\r\ncall _Oni-bi_, or demon-fires; and, whenever the winds are up, a sound\r\nof great shouting comes from that sea, like a clamor of battle.\r\n\r\nIn former years the Heik\xc3\xa9 were much more restless than they now are.\r\nThey would rise about ships passing in the night, and try to sink them;\r\nand at all times they would watch for swimmers, to pull them down. It\r\nwas in order to appease those dead that the Buddhist temple, Amidaji,\r\nwas built at Akamagas\xc3\xa9ki[2]. A cemetery also was made close by, near\r\nthe beach; and within it were set up monuments inscribed with the names\r\nof the drowned emperor and of his great vassals; and Buddhist services\r\nwere regularly performed there, on behalf of the spirits of them. After\r\nthe temple had been built, and the tombs erected, the Heik\xc3\xa9 gave less\r\ntrouble than before; but they continued to do queer things at\r\nintervals,\xe2\x80\x94proving that they had not found the perfect peace.\r\n\r\nSome centuries ago there lived at Akamagas\xc3\xa9ki a blind man named H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi,\r\nwho was famed for his skill in recitation and in playing upon the\r\n_biwa_[3]. From childhood he had been trained to recite and to play;\r\nand while yet a lad he had surpassed his teachers. As a professional\r\n_biwa-h\xc5\x8dshi_ he became famous chiefly by his recitations of the history\r\nof the Heik\xc3\xa9 and the Genji; and it is said that when he sang the song\r\nof the battle of Dan-no-ura \xe2\x80\x9ceven the goblins [_kijin_] could not\r\nrefrain from tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the outset of his career, H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was very poor; but he found a good\r\nfriend to help him. The priest of the Amidaji was fond of poetry and\r\nmusic; and he often invited H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi to the temple, to play and recite.\r\nAfterwards, being much impressed by the wonderful skill of the lad, the\r\npriest proposed that H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi should make the temple his home; and this\r\noffer was gratefully accepted. H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was given a room in the\r\ntemple-building; and, in return for food and lodging, he was required\r\nonly to gratify the priest with a musical performance on certain\r\nevenings, when otherwise disengaged.\r\n\r\nOne summer night the priest was called away, to perform a Buddhist\r\nservice at the house of a dead parishioner; and he went there with his\r\nacolyte, leaving H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi alone in the temple. It was a hot night; and\r\nthe blind man sought to cool himself on the verandah before his\r\nsleeping-room. The verandah overlooked a small garden in the rear of\r\nthe Amidaji. There H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi waited for the priest\xe2\x80\x99s return, and tried to\r\nrelieve his solitude by practicing upon his biwa. Midnight passed; and\r\nthe priest did not appear. But the atmosphere was still too warm for\r\ncomfort within doors; and H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi remained outside. At last he heard\r\nsteps approaching from the back gate. Somebody crossed the garden,\r\nadvanced to the verandah, and halted directly in front of him\xe2\x80\x94but it\r\nwas not the priest. A deep voice called the blind man\xe2\x80\x99s name\xe2\x80\x94abruptly\r\nand unceremoniously, in the manner of a samurai summoning an inferior:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was too much startled, for the moment, to respond; and the voice\r\ncalled again, in a tone of harsh command,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Hai!_\xe2\x80\x9d(1) answered the blind man, frightened by the menace in the\r\nvoice,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am blind!\xe2\x80\x94I cannot know who calls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing to fear,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger exclaimed, speaking more\r\ngently. \xe2\x80\x9cI am stopping near this temple, and have been sent to you with\r\na message. My present lord, a person of exceedingly high rank, is now\r\nstaying in Akamagas\xc3\xa9ki, with many noble attendants. He wished to view\r\nthe scene of the battle of Dan-no-ura; and to-day he visited that\r\nplace. Having heard of your skill in reciting the story of the battle,\r\nhe now desires to hear your performance: so you will take your biwa and\r\ncome with me at once to the house where the august assembly is\r\nwaiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those times, the order of a samurai was not to be lightly disobeyed.\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi donned his sandals, took his biwa, and went away with the\r\nstranger, who guided him deftly, but obliged him to walk very fast. The\r\nhand that guided was iron; and the clank of the warrior\xe2\x80\x99s stride proved\r\nhim fully armed,\xe2\x80\x94probably some palace-guard on duty. H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nalarm was over: he began to imagine himself in good luck;\xe2\x80\x94for,\r\nremembering the retainer\xe2\x80\x99s assurance about a \xe2\x80\x9cperson of exceedingly\r\nhigh rank,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought that the lord who wished to hear the recitation\r\ncould not be less than a daimy\xc5\x8d of the first class. Presently the\r\nsamurai halted; and H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi became aware that they had arrived at a\r\nlarge gateway;\xe2\x80\x94and he wondered, for he could not remember any large\r\ngate in that part of the town, except the main gate of the Amidaji.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Kaimon!_\xe2\x80\x9d[4] the samurai called,\xe2\x80\x94and there was a sound of unbarring;\r\nand the twain passed on. They traversed a space of garden, and halted\r\nagain before some entrance; and the retainer cried in a loud voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithin there! I have brought H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi.\xe2\x80\x9d Then came sounds of feet\r\nhurrying, and screens sliding, and rain-doors opening, and voices of\r\nwomen in converse. By the language of the women H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi knew them to be\r\ndomestics in some noble household; but he could not imagine to what\r\nplace he had been conducted. Little time was allowed him for\r\nconjecture. After he had been helped to mount several stone steps, upon\r\nthe last of which he was told to leave his sandals, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand\r\nguided him along interminable reaches of polished planking, and round\r\npillared angles too many to remember, and over widths amazing of matted\r\nfloor,\xe2\x80\x94into the middle of some vast apartment. There he thought that\r\nmany great people were assembled: the sound of the rustling of silk was\r\nlike the sound of leaves in a forest. He heard also a great humming of\r\nvoices,\xe2\x80\x94talking in undertones; and the speech was the speech of courts.\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was told to put himself at ease, and he found a kneeling-cushion\r\nready for him. After having taken his place upon it, and tuned his\r\ninstrument, the voice of a woman\xe2\x80\x94whom he divined to be the _R\xc5\x8djo_, or\r\nmatron in charge of the female service\xe2\x80\x94addressed him, saying,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now required that the history of the Heik\xc3\xa9 be recited, to the\r\naccompaniment of the biwa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the entire recital would have required a time of many nights:\r\ntherefore H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi ventured a question:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs the whole of the story is not soon told, what portion is it\r\naugustly desired that I now recite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice made answer:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite the story of the battle at Dan-no-ura,\xe2\x80\x94for the pity of it is\r\nthe most deep.\xe2\x80\x9d[5]\r\n\r\nThen H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi lifted up his voice, and chanted the chant of the fight on\r\nthe bitter sea,\xe2\x80\x94wonderfully making his biwa to sound like the straining\r\nof oars and the rushing of ships, the whirr and the hissing of arrows,\r\nthe shouting and trampling of men, the crashing of steel upon helmets,\r\nthe plunging of slain in the flood. And to left and right of him, in\r\nthe pauses of his playing, he could hear voices murmuring praise: \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nmarvelous an artist!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNever in our own province was playing heard like\r\nthis!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNot in all the empire is there another singer like H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen fresh courage came to him, and he played and sang yet better than\r\nbefore; and a hush of wonder deepened about him. But when at last he\r\ncame to tell the fate of the fair and helpless,\xe2\x80\x94the piteous perishing\r\nof the women and children,\xe2\x80\x94and the death-leap of Nii-no-Ama, with the\r\nimperial infant in her arms,\xe2\x80\x94then all the listeners uttered together\r\none long, long shuddering cry of anguish; and thereafter they wept and\r\nwailed so loudly and so wildly that the blind man was frightened by the\r\nviolence and grief that he had made. For much time the sobbing and the\r\nwailing continued. But gradually the sounds of lamentation died away;\r\nand again, in the great stillness that followed, H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi heard the voice\r\nof the woman whom he supposed to be the R\xc5\x8djo.\r\n\r\nShe said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we had been assured that you were a very skillful player upon\r\nthe biwa, and without an equal in recitative, we did not know that any\r\none could be so skillful as you have proved yourself to-night. Our lord\r\nhas been pleased to say that he intends to bestow upon you a fitting\r\nreward. But he desires that you shall perform before him once every\r\nnight for the next six nights\xe2\x80\x94after which time he will probably make\r\nhis august return-journey. To-morrow night, therefore, you are to come\r\nhere at the same hour. The retainer who to-night conducted you will be\r\nsent for you... There is another matter about which I have been ordered\r\nto inform you. It is required that you shall speak to no one of your\r\nvisits here, during the time of our lord\xe2\x80\x99s august sojourn at\r\nAkamagas\xc3\xa9ki. As he is traveling incognito,[6] he commands that no\r\nmention of these things be made... You are now free to go back to your\r\ntemple.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi had duly expressed his thanks, a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand conducted\r\nhim to the entrance of the house, where the same retainer, who had\r\nbefore guided him, was waiting to take him home. The retainer led him\r\nto the verandah at the rear of the temple, and there bade him farewell.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dawn when H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi returned; but his absence from the\r\ntemple had not been observed,\xe2\x80\x94as the priest, coming back at a very late\r\nhour, had supposed him asleep. During the day H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was able to take\r\nsome rest; and he said nothing about his strange adventure. In the\r\nmiddle of the following night the samurai again came for him, and led\r\nhim to the august assembly, where he gave another recitation with the\r\nsame success that had attended his previous performance. But during\r\nthis second visit his absence from the temple was accidentally\r\ndiscovered; and after his return in the morning he was summoned to the\r\npresence of the priest, who said to him, in a tone of kindly reproach:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been very anxious about you, friend H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi. To go out, blind\r\nand alone, at so late an hour, is dangerous. Why did you go without\r\ntelling us? I could have ordered a servant to accompany you. And where\r\nhave you been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi answered, evasively,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me kind friend! I had to attend to some private business; and I\r\ncould not arrange the matter at any other hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe priest was surprised, rather than pained, by H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi\xe2\x80\x99s reticence: he\r\nfelt it to be unnatural, and suspected something wrong. He feared that\r\nthe blind lad had been bewitched or deluded by some evil spirits. He\r\ndid not ask any more questions; but he privately instructed the\r\nmen-servants of the temple to keep watch upon H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi\xe2\x80\x99s movements, and\r\nto follow him in case that he should again leave the temple after dark.\r\n\r\nOn the very next night, H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was seen to leave the temple; and the\r\nservants immediately lighted their lanterns, and followed after him.\r\nBut it was a rainy night, and very dark; and before the temple-folks\r\ncould get to the roadway, H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi had disappeared. Evidently he had\r\nwalked very fast,\xe2\x80\x94a strange thing, considering his blindness; for the\r\nroad was in a bad condition. The men hurried through the streets,\r\nmaking inquiries at every house which H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi was accustomed to visit;\r\nbut nobody could give them any news of him. At last, as they were\r\nreturning to the temple by way of the shore, they were startled by the\r\nsound of a biwa, furiously played, in the cemetery of the Amidaji.\r\nExcept for some ghostly fires\xe2\x80\x94such as usually flitted there on dark\r\nnights\xe2\x80\x94all was blackness in that direction. But the men at once\r\nhastened to the cemetery; and there, by the help of their lanterns,\r\nthey discovered H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi,\xe2\x80\x94sitting alone in the rain before the memorial\r\ntomb of Antoku Tenn\xc5\x8d, making his biwa resound, and loudly chanting the\r\nchant of the battle of Dan-no-ura. And behind him, and about him, and\r\neverywhere above the tombs, the fires of the dead were burning, like\r\ncandles. Never before had so great a host of _Oni-bi_ appeared in the\r\nsight of mortal man...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi San!\xe2\x80\x94H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi San!\xe2\x80\x9d the servants cried,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are bewitched!...\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi San!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the blind man did not seem to hear. Strenuously he made his biwa to\r\nrattle and ring and clang;\xe2\x80\x94more and more wildly he chanted the chant of\r\nthe battle of Dan-no-ura. They caught hold of him;\xe2\x80\x94they shouted into\r\nhis ear,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi San!\xe2\x80\x94H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi San!\xe2\x80\x94come home with us at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReprovingly he spoke to them:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo interrupt me in such a manner, before this august assembly, will\r\nnot be tolerated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereat, in spite of the weirdness of the thing, the servants could not\r\nhelp laughing. Sure that he had been bewitched, they now seized him,\r\nand pulled him up on his feet, and by main force hurried him back to\r\nthe temple,\xe2\x80\x94where he was immediately relieved of his wet clothes, by\r\norder of the priest. Then the priest insisted upon a full explanation\r\nof his friend\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing behavior.\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi long hesitated to speak. But at last, finding that his conduct\r\nhad really alarmed and angered the good priest, he decided to abandon\r\nhis reserve; and he related everything that had happened from the time\r\nof first visit of the samurai.\r\n\r\nThe priest said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi, my poor friend, you are now in great danger! How unfortunate\r\nthat you did not tell me all this before! Your wonderful skill in music\r\nhas indeed brought you into strange trouble. By this time you must be\r\naware that you have not been visiting any house whatever, but have been\r\npassing your nights in the cemetery, among the tombs of the Heik\xc3\xa9;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit was before the memorial-tomb of Antoku Tenn\xc5\x8d that our people\r\nto-night found you, sitting in the rain. All that you have been\r\nimagining was illusion\xe2\x80\x94except the calling of the dead. By once obeying\r\nthem, you have put yourself in their power. If you obey them again,\r\nafter what has already occurred, they will tear you in pieces. But they\r\nwould have destroyed you, sooner or later, in any event... Now I shall\r\nnot be able to remain with you to-night: I am called away to perform\r\nanother service. But, before I go, it will be necessary to protect your\r\nbody by writing holy texts upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore sundown the priest and his acolyte stripped H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi: then, with\r\ntheir writing-brushes, they traced upon his breast and back, head and\r\nface and neck, limbs and hands and feet,\xe2\x80\x94even upon the soles of his\r\nfeet, and upon all parts of his body,\xe2\x80\x94the text of the holy s\xc3\xbbtra called\r\n_Hannya-Shin-Ky\xc5\x8d_.[7] When this had been done, the priest instructed\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi, saying:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-night, as soon as I go away, you must seat yourself on the\r\nverandah, and wait. You will be called. But, whatever may happen, do\r\nnot answer, and do not move. Say nothing and sit still\xe2\x80\x94as if\r\nmeditating. If you stir, or make any noise, you will be torn asunder.\r\nDo not get frightened; and do not think of calling for help\xe2\x80\x94because no\r\nhelp could save you. If you do exactly as I tell you, the danger will\r\npass, and you will have nothing more to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dark the priest and the acolyte went away; and H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi seated\r\nhimself on the verandah, according to the instructions given him. He\r\nlaid his biwa on the planking beside him, and, assuming the attitude of\r\nmeditation, remained quite still,\xe2\x80\x94taking care not to cough, or to\r\nbreathe audibly. For hours he stayed thus.\r\n\r\nThen, from the roadway, he heard the steps coming. They passed the\r\ngate, crossed the garden, approached the verandah, stopped\xe2\x80\x94directly in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d the deep voice called. But the blind man held his breath, and\r\nsat motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d grimly called the voice a second time. Then a third\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94savagely:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi remained as still as a stone,\xe2\x80\x94and the voice grumbled:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo answer!\xe2\x80\x94that won\xe2\x80\x99t do!... Must see where the fellow is.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nThere was a noise of heavy feet mounting upon the verandah. The feet\r\napproached deliberately,\xe2\x80\x94halted beside him. Then, for long\r\nminutes,\xe2\x80\x94during which H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi felt his whole body shake to the beating\r\nof his heart,\xe2\x80\x94there was dead silence.\r\n\r\nAt last the gruff voice muttered close to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the biwa; but of the biwa-player I see\xe2\x80\x94only two ears!... So\r\nthat explains why he did not answer: he had no mouth to answer\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94there is nothing left of him but his ears... Now to my lord those\r\nears I will take\xe2\x80\x94in proof that the august commands have been obeyed, so\r\nfar as was possible\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nAt that instant H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi felt his ears gripped by fingers of iron, and\r\ntorn off! Great as the pain was, he gave no cry. The heavy footfalls\r\nreceded along the verandah,\xe2\x80\x94descended into the garden,\xe2\x80\x94passed out to\r\nthe roadway,\xe2\x80\x94ceased. From either side of his head, the blind man felt a\r\nthick warm trickling; but he dared not lift his hands...\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise the priest came back. He hastened at once to the\r\nverandah in the rear, stepped and slipped upon something clammy, and\r\nuttered a cry of horror;\xe2\x80\x94for he saw, by the light of his lantern, that\r\nthe clamminess was blood. But he perceived H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi sitting there, in the\r\nattitude of meditation\xe2\x80\x94with the blood still oozing from his wounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the startled priest,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this?... You have\r\nbeen hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s voice, the blind man felt safe. He burst\r\nout sobbing, and tearfully told his adventure of the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor, poor H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi!\xe2\x80\x9d the priest exclaimed,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9call my fault!\xe2\x80\x94my very\r\ngrievous fault!... Everywhere upon your body the holy texts had been\r\nwritten\xe2\x80\x94except upon your ears! I trusted my acolyte to do that part of\r\nthe work; and it was very, very wrong of me not to have made sure that\r\nhe had done it!... Well, the matter cannot now be helped;\xe2\x80\x94we can only\r\ntry to heal your hurts as soon as possible... Cheer up, friend!\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndanger is now well over. You will never again be troubled by those\r\nvisitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a good doctor, H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi soon recovered from his injuries.\r\nThe story of his strange adventure spread far and wide, and soon made\r\nhim famous. Many noble persons went to Akamagas\xc3\xa9ki to hear him recite;\r\nand large presents of money were given to him,\xe2\x80\x94so that he became a\r\nwealthy man... But from the time of his adventure, he was known only by\r\nthe appellation of _Mimi-nashi-H\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi:_ \xe2\x80\x9cH\xc5\x8d\xc3\xafchi-the-Earless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOSHIDORI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a falconer and hunter, named Sonj\xc5\x8d, who lived in the district\r\ncalled Tamura-no-G\xc5\x8d, of the province of Mutsu. One day he went out\r\nhunting, and could not find any game. But on his way home, at a place\r\ncalled Akanuma, he perceived a pair of _oshidori_[1] (mandarin-ducks),\r\nswimming together in a river that he was about to cross. To kill\r\n_oshidori_ is not good; but Sonj\xc5\x8d happened to be very hungry, and he\r\nshot at the pair. His arrow pierced the male: the female escaped into\r\nthe rushes of the further shore, and disappeared. Sonj\xc5\x8d took the dead\r\nbird home, and cooked it.\r\n\r\nThat night he dreamed a dreary dream. It seemed to him that a beautiful\r\nwoman came into his room, and stood by his pillow, and began to weep.\r\nSo bitterly did she weep that Sonj\xc5\x8d felt as if his heart were being\r\ntorn out while he listened. And the woman cried to him: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x94oh! why\r\ndid you kill him?\xe2\x80\x94of what wrong was he guilty?... At Akanuma we were so\r\nhappy together,\xe2\x80\x94and you killed him!... What harm did he ever do you? Do\r\nyou even know what you have done?\xe2\x80\x94oh! do you know what a cruel, what a\r\nwicked thing you have done?... Me too you have killed,\xe2\x80\x94for I will not\r\nlive without my husband!... Only to tell you this I came.\xe2\x80\x9d... Then\r\nagain she wept aloud,\xe2\x80\x94so bitterly that the voice of her crying pierced\r\ninto the marrow of the listener\xe2\x80\x99s bones;\xe2\x80\x94and she sobbed out the words\r\nof this poem:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    Hi kurur\xc3\xa9ba\r\nSaso\xc3\xabshi mono wo\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Akanuma no\r\nMakomo no kur\xc3\xa9 no\r\nHitori-n\xc3\xa9 zo uki!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_\xe2\x80\x9cAt the coming of twilight I invited him to return with me\xe2\x80\x94! Now to\r\nsleep alone in the shadow of the rushes of Akanuma\xe2\x80\x94ah! what misery\r\nunspeakable!\xe2\x80\x9d_][2]\r\n\r\nAnd after having uttered these verses she exclaimed:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you do not\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x94you cannot know what you have done! But to-morrow, when you go to\r\nAkanuma, you will see,\xe2\x80\x94you will see...\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, and weeping very\r\npiteously, she went away.\r\n\r\nWhen Sonj\xc5\x8d awoke in the morning, this dream remained so vivid in his\r\nmind that he was greatly troubled. He remembered the words:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nto-morrow, when you go to Akanuma, you will see,\xe2\x80\x94you will see.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nresolved to go there at once, that he might learn whether his dream was\r\nanything more than a dream.\r\n\r\nSo he went to Akanuma; and there, when he came to the river-bank, he\r\nsaw the female _oshidori_ swimming alone. In the same moment the bird\r\nperceived Sonj\xc5\x8d; but, instead of trying to escape, she swam straight\r\ntowards him, looking at him the while in a strange fixed way. Then,\r\nwith her beak, she suddenly tore open her own body, and died before the\r\nhunter\xe2\x80\x99s eyes...\r\n\r\nSonj\xc5\x8d shaved his head, and became a priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF O-TEI\r\n\r\n\r\nA long time ago, in the town of Niigata, in the province of Echizen,\r\nthere lived a man called Nagao Ch\xc5\x8dsei.\r\n\r\nNagao was the son of a physician, and was educated for his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession. At an early age he had been betrothed to a girl called\r\nO-Tei, the daughter of one of his father\xe2\x80\x99s friends; and both families\r\nhad agreed that the wedding should take place as soon as Nagao had\r\nfinished his studies. But the health of O-Tei proved to be weak; and in\r\nher fifteenth year she was attacked by a fatal consumption. When she\r\nbecame aware that she must die, she sent for Nagao to bid him farewell.\r\n\r\nAs he knelt at her bedside, she said to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNagao-Sama, (1) my betrothed, we were promised to each other from the\r\ntime of our childhood; and we were to have been married at the end of\r\nthis year. But now I am going to die;\xe2\x80\x94the gods know what is best for\r\nus. If I were able to live for some years longer, I could only continue\r\nto be a cause of trouble and grief for others. With this frail body, I\r\ncould not be a good wife; and therefore even to wish to live, for your\r\nsake, would be a very selfish wish. I am quite resigned to die; and I\r\nwant you to promise that you will not grieve... Besides, I want to tell\r\nyou that I think we shall meet again.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed we shall meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d Nagao answered earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in that\r\nPure Land (2) there will be no pain of separation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, nay!\xe2\x80\x9d she responded softly, \xe2\x80\x9cI meant not the Pure Land. I believe\r\nthat we are destined to meet again in this world,\xe2\x80\x94although I shall be\r\nburied to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNagao looked at her wonderingly, and saw her smile at his wonder. She\r\ncontinued, in her gentle, dreamy voice,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I mean in this world,\xe2\x80\x94in your own present life, Nagao-Sama...\r\nProviding, indeed, that you wish it. Only, for this thing to happen, I\r\nmust again be born a girl, and grow up to womanhood. So you would have\r\nto wait. Fifteen\xe2\x80\x94sixteen years: that is a long time... But, my promised\r\nhusband, you are now only nineteen years old.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nEager to soothe her dying moments, he answered tenderly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo wait for you, my betrothed, were no less a joy than a duty. We are\r\npledged to each other for the time of seven existences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d she questioned, watching his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear one,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt whether I should be able to know\r\nyou in another body, under another name,\xe2\x80\x94unless you can tell me of a\r\nsign or token.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the Gods and the Buddhas know how\r\nand where we shall meet. But I am sure\xe2\x80\x94very, very sure\xe2\x80\x94that, if you be\r\nnot unwilling to receive me, I shall be able to come back to you...\r\nRemember these words of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nShe ceased to speak; and her eyes closed. She was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNagao had been sincerely attached to O-Tei; and his grief was deep. He\r\nhad a mortuary tablet made, inscribed with her _zokumy\xc5\x8d;_[1] and he\r\nplaced the tablet in his _butsudan_,[2] and every day set offerings\r\nbefore it. He thought a great deal about the strange things that O-Tei\r\nhad said to him just before her death; and, in the hope of pleasing her\r\nspirit, he wrote a solemn promise to wed her if she could ever return\r\nto him in another body. This written promise he sealed with his seal,\r\nand placed in the _butsudan_ beside the mortuary tablet of O-Tei.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as Nagao was an only son, it was necessary that he should\r\nmarry. He soon found himself obliged to yield to the wishes of his\r\nfamily, and to accept a wife of his father\xe2\x80\x99s choosing. After his\r\nmarriage he continued to set offerings before the tablet of O-Tei; and\r\nhe never failed to remember her with affection. But by degrees her\r\nimage became dim in his memory,\xe2\x80\x94like a dream that is hard to recall.\r\nAnd the years went by.\r\n\r\nDuring those years many misfortunes came upon him. He lost his parents\r\nby death,\xe2\x80\x94then his wife and his only child. So that he found himself\r\nalone in the world. He abandoned his desolate home, and set out upon a\r\nlong journey in the hope of forgetting his sorrows.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the course of his travels, he arrived at Ikao,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmountain-village still famed for its thermal springs, and for the\r\nbeautiful scenery of its neighborhood. In the village-inn at which he\r\nstopped, a young girl came to wait upon him; and, at the first sight of\r\nher face, he felt his heart leap as it had never leaped before. So\r\nstrangely did she resemble O-Tei that he pinched himself to make sure\r\nthat he was not dreaming. As she went and came,\xe2\x80\x94bringing fire and food,\r\nor arranging the chamber of the guest,\xe2\x80\x94her every attitude and motion\r\nrevived in him some gracious memory of the girl to whom he had been\r\npledged in his youth. He spoke to her; and she responded in a soft,\r\nclear voice of which the sweetness saddened him with a sadness of other\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThen, in great wonder, he questioned her, saying:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElder Sister (3), so much do you look like a person whom I knew long\r\nago, that I was startled when you first entered this room. Pardon me,\r\ntherefore, for asking what is your native place, and what is your\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately,\xe2\x80\x94and in the unforgotten voice of the dead,\xe2\x80\x94she thus made\r\nanswer:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is O-Tei; and you are Nagao Ch\xc5\x8dsei of Echigo, my promised\r\nhusband. Seventeen years ago, I died in Niigata: then you made in\r\nwriting a promise to marry me if ever I could come back to this world\r\nin the body of a woman;\xe2\x80\x94and you sealed that written promise with your\r\nseal, and put it in the _butsudan_, beside the tablet inscribed with my\r\nname. And therefore I came back.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nAs she uttered these last words, she fell unconscious.\r\n\r\nNagao married her; and the marriage was a happy one. But at no time\r\nafterwards could she remember what she had told him in answer to his\r\nquestion at Ikao: neither could she remember anything of her previous\r\nexistence. The recollection of the former birth,\xe2\x80\x94mysteriously kindled\r\nin the moment of that meeting,\xe2\x80\x94had again become obscured, and so\r\nthereafter remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUBAZAKURA\r\n\r\n\r\nThree hundred years ago, in the village called Asamimura, in the\r\ndistrict called Onseng\xc5\x8dri, in the province of Iy\xc5\x8d, there lived a good\r\nman named Tokubei. This Tokubei was the richest person in the district,\r\nand the _muraosa_, or headman, of the village. In most matters he was\r\nfortunate; but he reached the age of forty without knowing the\r\nhappiness of becoming a father. Therefore he and his wife, in the\r\naffliction of their childlessness, addressed many prayers to the\r\ndivinity Fud\xc5\x8d My\xc5\x8d \xc5\x8c, who had a famous temple, called Saih\xc5\x8dji, in\r\nAsamimura.\r\n\r\nAt last their prayers were heard: the wife of Tokubei gave birth to a\r\ndaughter. The child was very pretty; and she received the name of\r\nTsuyu. As the mother\xe2\x80\x99s milk was deficient, a milk-nurse, called O-Sod\xc3\xa9,\r\nwas hired for the little one.\r\n\r\nO-Tsuyu grew up to be a very beautiful girl; but at the age of fifteen\r\nshe fell sick, and the doctors thought that she was going to die. In\r\nthat time the nurse O-Sod\xc3\xa9, who loved O-Tsuyu with a real mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove, went to the temple Saih\xc5\x8dji, and fervently prayed to Fud\xc5\x8d-Sama on\r\nbehalf of the girl. Every day, for twenty-one days, she went to the\r\ntemple and prayed; and at the end of that time, O-Tsuyu suddenly and\r\ncompletely recovered.\r\n\r\nThen there was great rejoicing in the house of Tokubei; and he gave a\r\nfeast to all his friends in celebration of the happy event. But on the\r\nnight of the feast the nurse O-Sod\xc3\xa9 was suddenly taken ill; and on the\r\nfollowing morning, the doctor, who had been summoned to attend her,\r\nannounced that she was dying.\r\n\r\nThen the family, in great sorrow, gathered about her bed, to bid her\r\nfarewell. But she said to them:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time that I should tell you something which you do not know. My\r\nprayer has been heard. I besought Fud\xc5\x8d-Sama that I might be permitted\r\nto die in the place of O-Tsuyu; and this great favor has been granted\r\nme. Therefore you must not grieve about my death... But I have one\r\nrequest to make. I promised Fud\xc5\x8d-Sama that I would have a cherry-tree\r\nplanted in the garden of Saih\xc5\x8dji, for a thank-offering and a\r\ncommemoration. Now I shall not be able myself to plant the tree there:\r\nso I must beg that you will fulfill that vow for me... Good-bye, dear\r\nfriends; and remember that I was happy to die for O-Tsuyu\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the funeral of O-Sod\xc3\xa9, a young cherry-tree,\xe2\x80\x94the finest that could\r\nbe found,\xe2\x80\x94was planted in the garden of Saih\xc5\x8dji by the parents of\r\nO-Tsuyu. The tree grew and flourished; and on the sixteenth day of the\r\nsecond month of the following year,\xe2\x80\x94the anniversary of O-Sod\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath,\xe2\x80\x94it blossomed in a wonderful way. So it continued to blossom for\r\ntwo hundred and fifty-four years,\xe2\x80\x94always upon the sixteenth day of the\r\nsecond month;\xe2\x80\x94and its flowers, pink and white, were like the nipples of\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s breasts, bedewed with milk. And the people called it\r\n_Ubazakura_, the Cherry-tree of the Milk-Nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been ordered that the execution should take place in the garden\r\nof the _yashiki_ (1). So the man was taken there, and made to kneel\r\ndown in a wide sanded space crossed by a line of _tobi-ishi_, or\r\nstepping-stones, such as you may still see in Japanese\r\nlandscape-gardens. His arms were bound behind him. Retainers brought\r\nwater in buckets, and rice-bags filled with pebbles; and they packed\r\nthe rice-bags round the kneeling man,\xe2\x80\x94so wedging him in that he could\r\nnot move. The master came, and observed the arrangements. He found them\r\nsatisfactory, and made no remarks.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the condemned man cried out to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonored Sir, the fault for which I have been doomed I did not\r\nwittingly commit. It was only my very great stupidity which caused the\r\nfault. Having been born stupid, by reason of my Karma, I could not\r\nalways help making mistakes. But to kill a man for being stupid is\r\nwrong,\xe2\x80\x94and that wrong will be repaid. So surely as you kill me, so\r\nsurely shall I be avenged;\xe2\x80\x94out of the resentment that you provoke will\r\ncome the vengeance; and evil will be rendered for evil.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nIf any person be killed while feeling strong resentment, the ghost of\r\nthat person will be able to take vengeance upon the killer. This the\r\nsamurai knew. He replied very gently,\xe2\x80\x94almost caressingly:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall allow you to frighten us as much as you please\xe2\x80\x94after you are\r\ndead. But it is difficult to believe that you mean what you say. Will\r\nyou try to give us some sign of your great resentment\xe2\x80\x94after your head\r\nhas been cut off?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly I will,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the samurai, drawing his long sword;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am now going\r\nto cut off your head. Directly in front of you there is a\r\nstepping-stone. After your head has been cut off, try to bite the\r\nstepping-stone. If your angry ghost can help you to do that, some of us\r\nmay be frightened... Will you try to bite the stone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will bite it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the man, in great anger,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI will bite it!\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwill bite\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThere was a flash, a swish, a crunching thud: the bound body bowed over\r\nthe rice sacks,\xe2\x80\x94two long blood-jets pumping from the shorn neck;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe head rolled upon the sand. Heavily toward the stepping-stone it\r\nrolled: then, suddenly bounding, it caught the upper edge of the stone\r\nbetween its teeth, clung desperately for a moment, and dropped inert.\r\n\r\nNone spoke; but the retainers stared in horror at their master. He\r\nseemed to be quite unconcerned. He merely held out his sword to the\r\nnearest attendant, who, with a wooden dipper, poured water over the\r\nblade from haft to point, and then carefully wiped the steel several\r\ntimes with sheets of soft paper... And thus ended the ceremonial part\r\nof the incident.\r\n\r\nFor months thereafter, the retainers and the domestics lived in\r\nceaseless fear of ghostly visitation. None of them doubted that the\r\npromised vengeance would come; and their constant terror caused them to\r\nhear and to see much that did not exist. They became afraid of the\r\nsound of the wind in the bamboos,\xe2\x80\x94afraid even of the stirring of\r\nshadows in the garden. At last, after taking counsel together, they\r\ndecided to petition their master to have a _S\xc3\xa9gaki_-service (2)\r\nperformed on behalf of the vengeful spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite unnecessary,\xe2\x80\x9d the samurai said, when his chief retainer had\r\nuttered the general wish... \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that the desire of a dying\r\nman for revenge may be a cause for fear. But in this case there is\r\nnothing to fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe retainer looked at his master beseechingly, but hesitated to ask\r\nthe reason of the alarming confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the reason is simple enough,\xe2\x80\x9d declared the samurai, divining the\r\nunspoken doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly the very last intention of the fellow could have\r\nbeen dangerous; and when I challenged him to give me the sign, I\r\ndiverted his mind from the desire of revenge. He died with the set\r\npurpose of biting the stepping-stone; and that purpose he was able to\r\naccomplish, but nothing else. All the rest he must have forgotten... So\r\nyou need not feel any further anxiety about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And indeed the dead man gave no more trouble. Nothing at all happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF A MIRROR AND A BELL\r\n\r\n\r\nEight centuries ago, the priests of Mugenyama, in the province of\r\nT\xc5\x8dt\xc5\x8dmi (1), wanted a big bell for their temple; and they asked the\r\nwomen of their parish to help them by contributing old bronze mirrors\r\nfor bell-metal.\r\n\r\n[Even to-day, in the courts of certain Japanese temples, you may see\r\nheaps of old bronze mirrors contributed for such a purpose. The largest\r\ncollection of this kind that I ever saw was in the court of a temple of\r\nthe J\xc5\x8ddo sect, at Hakata, in Ky\xc5\xabsh\xc5\xab: the mirrors had been given for the\r\nmaking of a bronze statue of Amida, thirty-three feet high.]\r\n\r\nThere was at that time a young woman, a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, living at\r\nMugenyama, who presented her mirror to the temple, to be used for\r\nbell-metal. But afterwards she much regretted her mirror. She\r\nremembered things that her mother had told her about it; and she\r\nremembered that it had belonged, not only to her mother but to her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s mother and grandmother; and she remembered some happy smiles\r\nwhich it had reflected. Of course, if she could have offered the\r\npriests a certain sum of money in place of the mirror, she could have\r\nasked them to give back her heirloom. But she had not the money\r\nnecessary. Whenever she went to the temple, she saw her mirror lying in\r\nthe court-yard, behind a railing, among hundreds of other mirrors\r\nheaped there together. She knew it by the _Sh\xc5\x8d-Chiku-Bai_ in relief on\r\nthe back of it,\xe2\x80\x94those three fortunate emblems of Pine, Bamboo, and\r\nPlumflower, which delighted her baby-eyes when her mother first showed\r\nher the mirror. She longed for some chance to steal the mirror, and\r\nhide it,\xe2\x80\x94that she might thereafter treasure it always. But the chance\r\ndid not come; and she became very unhappy,\xe2\x80\x94felt as if she had foolishly\r\ngiven away a part of her life. She thought about the old saying that a\r\nmirror is the Soul of a Woman\xe2\x80\x94(a saying mystically expressed, by the\r\nChinese character for Soul, upon the backs of many bronze mirrors),\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nshe feared that it was true in weirder ways than she had before\r\nimagined. But she could not dare to speak of her pain to anybody.\r\n\r\nNow, when all the mirrors contributed for the Mugenyama bell had been\r\nsent to the foundry, the bell-founders discovered that there was one\r\nmirror among them which would not melt. Again and again they tried to\r\nmelt it; but it resisted all their efforts. Evidently the woman who had\r\ngiven that mirror to the temple must have regretted the giving. She had\r\nnot presented her offering with all her heart; and therefore her\r\nselfish soul, remaining attached to the mirror, kept it hard and cold\r\nin the midst of the furnace.\r\n\r\nOf course everybody heard of the matter, and everybody soon knew whose\r\nmirror it was that would not melt. And because of this public exposure\r\nof her secret fault, the poor woman became very much ashamed and very\r\nangry. And as she could not bear the shame, she drowned herself, after\r\nhaving written a farewell letter containing these words:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am dead, it will not be difficult to melt the mirror and to\r\ncast the bell. But, to the person who breaks that bell by ringing it,\r\ngreat wealth will be given by the ghost of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You must know that the last wish or promise of anybody who dies in\r\nanger, or performs suicide in anger, is generally supposed to possess a\r\nsupernatural force. After the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s mirror had been melted, and\r\nthe bell had been successfully cast, people remembered the words of\r\nthat letter. They felt sure that the spirit of the writer would give\r\nwealth to the breaker of the bell; and, as soon as the bell had been\r\nsuspended in the court of the temple, they went in multitude to ring\r\nit. With all their might and main they swung the ringing-beam; but the\r\nbell proved to be a good bell, and it bravely withstood their assaults.\r\nNevertheless, the people were not easily discouraged. Day after day, at\r\nall hours, they continued to ring the bell furiously,\xe2\x80\x94caring nothing\r\nwhatever for the protests of the priests. So the ringing became an\r\naffliction; and the priests could not endure it; and they got rid of\r\nthe bell by rolling it down the hill into a swamp. The swamp was deep,\r\nand swallowed it up,\xe2\x80\x94and that was the end of the bell. Only its legend\r\nremains; and in that legend it is called the _Mugen-Kan\xc3\xa9_, or Bell of\r\nMugen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there are queer old Japanese beliefs in the magical efficacy of a\r\ncertain mental operation implied, though not described, by the verb\r\n_nazora\xc3\xabru_. The word itself cannot be adequately rendered by any\r\nEnglish word; for it is used in relation to many kinds of mimetic\r\nmagic, as well as in relation to the performance of many religious acts\r\nof faith. Common meanings of _nazora\xc3\xabru_, according to dictionaries,\r\nare \xe2\x80\x9cto imitate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto compare,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cto liken;\xe2\x80\x9d but the esoteric meaning is\r\n_to substitute, in imagination, one object or action for another, so as\r\nto bring about some magical or miraculous result_.\r\n\r\nFor example:\xe2\x80\x94you cannot afford to build a Buddhist temple; but you can\r\neasily lay a pebble before the image of the Buddha, with the same pious\r\nfeeling that would prompt you to build a temple if you were rich enough\r\nto build one. The merit of so offering the pebble becomes equal, or\r\nalmost equal, to the merit of erecting a temple... You cannot read the\r\nsix thousand seven hundred and seventy-one volumes of the Buddhist\r\ntexts; but you can make a revolving library, containing them, turn\r\nround, by pushing it like a windlass. And if you push with an earnest\r\nwish that you could read the six thousand seven hundred and seventy-one\r\nvolumes, you will acquire the same merit as the reading of them would\r\nenable you to gain... So much will perhaps suffice to explain the\r\nreligious meanings of _nazora\xc3\xabru_.\r\n\r\nThe magical meanings could not all be explained without a great variety\r\nof examples; but, for present purposes, the following will serve. If\r\nyou should make a little man of straw, for the same reason that Sister\r\nHelen made a little man of wax,\xe2\x80\x94and nail it, with nails not less than\r\nfive inches long, to some tree in a temple-grove at the Hour of the Ox\r\n(2),\xe2\x80\x94and if the person, imaginatively represented by that little straw\r\nman, should die thereafter in atrocious agony,\xe2\x80\x94that would illustrate\r\none signification of _nazora\xc3\xabru_... Or, let us suppose that a robber\r\nhas entered your house during the night, and carried away your\r\nvaluables. If you can discover the footprints of that robber in your\r\ngarden, and then promptly burn a very large moxa on each of them, the\r\nsoles of the feet of the robber will become inflamed, and will allow\r\nhim no rest until he returns, of his own accord, to put himself at your\r\nmercy. That is another kind of mimetic magic expressed by the term\r\n_nazora\xc3\xabru_. And a third kind is illustrated by various legends of the\r\nMugen-Kan\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nAfter the bell had been rolled into the swamp, there was, of course, no\r\nmore chance of ringing it in such wise as to break it. But persons who\r\nregretted this loss of opportunity would strike and break objects\r\nimaginatively substituted for the bell,\xe2\x80\x94thus hoping to please the\r\nspirit of the owner of the mirror that had made so much trouble. One of\r\nthese persons was a woman called Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab,\xe2\x80\x94famed in Japanese legend\r\nbecause of her relation to Kajiwara Kagesue, a warrior of the Heik\xc3\xa9\r\nclan. While the pair were traveling together, Kajiwara one day found\r\nhimself in great straits for want of money; and Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab, remembering the\r\ntradition of the Bell of Mugen, took a basin of bronze, and, mentally\r\nrepresenting it to be the bell, beat upon it until she broke it,\xe2\x80\x94crying\r\nout, at the same time, for three hundred pieces of gold. A guest of the\r\ninn where the pair were stopping made inquiry as to the cause of the\r\nbanging and the crying, and, on learning the story of the trouble,\r\nactually presented Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab with three hundred _ry\xc5\x8d_ (3) in gold.\r\nAfterwards a song was made about Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab\xe2\x80\x99s basin of bronze; and that\r\nsong is sung by dancing girls even to this day:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nUm\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab no ch\xc5\x8dzubachi tata\xc3\xaft\xc3\xa9\r\nO-kan\xc3\xa9 ga d\xc3\xa9ru naraba\r\nMina San mi-uk\xc3\xa9 wo\r\nS\xc5\x8dr\xc3\xa9 tanomimasu\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9c_If, by striking upon the wash-basin of Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab, I could make\r\nhonorable money come to me, then would I negotiate for the freedom of\r\nall my girl-comrades._\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this happening, the fame of the Mugen-Kan\xc3\xa9 became great; and many\r\npeople followed the example of Um\xc3\xa9ga\xc3\xab,\xe2\x80\x94thereby hoping to emulate her\r\nluck. Among these folk was a dissolute farmer who lived near Mugenyama,\r\non the bank of the \xc5\x8c\xc3\xafgawa. Having wasted his substance in riotous\r\nliving, this farmer made for himself, out of the mud in his garden, a\r\nclay-model of the Mugen-Kan\xc3\xa9; and he beat the clay-bell, and broke\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x94crying out the while for great wealth.\r\n\r\nThen, out of the ground before him, rose up the figure of a white-robed\r\nwoman, with long loose-flowing hair, holding a covered jar. And the\r\nwoman said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to answer your fervent prayer as it deserves\r\nto be answered. Take, therefore, this jar.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, she put the jar\r\ninto his hands, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nInto his house the happy man rushed, to tell his wife the good news. He\r\nset down in front of her the covered jar,\xe2\x80\x94which was heavy,\xe2\x80\x94and they\r\nopened it together. And they found that it was filled, up to the very\r\nbrim, with...\r\n\r\nBut no!\xe2\x80\x94I really cannot tell you with what it was filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJIKININKI\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce, when Mus\xc5\x8d Kokushi, a priest of the Zen sect, was journeying alone\r\nthrough the province of Mino (1), he lost his way in a\r\nmountain-district where there was nobody to direct him. For a long time\r\nhe wandered about helplessly; and he was beginning to despair of\r\nfinding shelter for the night, when he perceived, on the top of a hill\r\nlighted by the last rays of the sun, one of those little hermitages,\r\ncalled _anjitsu_, which are built for solitary priests. It seemed to be\r\nin ruinous condition; but he hastened to it eagerly, and found that it\r\nwas inhabited by an aged priest, from whom he begged the favor of a\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x99s lodging. This the old man harshly refused; but he directed Mus\xc5\x8d\r\nto a certain hamlet, in the valley adjoining where lodging and food\r\ncould be obtained.\r\n\r\nMus\xc5\x8d found his way to the hamlet, which consisted of less than a dozen\r\nfarm-cottages; and he was kindly received at the dwelling of the\r\nheadman. Forty or fifty persons were assembled in the principal\r\napartment, at the moment of Mus\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; but he was shown into a\r\nsmall separate room, where he was promptly supplied with food and\r\nbedding. Being very tired, he lay down to rest at an early hour; but a\r\nlittle before midnight he was roused from sleep by a sound of loud\r\nweeping in the next apartment. Presently the sliding-screens were\r\ngently pushed apart; and a young man, carrying a lighted lantern,\r\nentered the room, respectfully saluted him, and said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend Sir, it is my painful duty to tell you that I am now the\r\nresponsible head of this house. Yesterday I was only the eldest son.\r\nBut when you came here, tired as you were, we did not wish that you\r\nshould feel embarrassed in any way: therefore we did not tell you that\r\nfather had died only a few hours before. The people whom you saw in the\r\nnext room are the inhabitants of this village: they all assembled here\r\nto pay their last respects to the dead; and now they are going to\r\nanother village, about three miles off,\xe2\x80\x94for by our custom, no one of us\r\nmay remain in this village during the night after a death has taken\r\nplace. We make the proper offerings and prayers;\xe2\x80\x94then we go away,\r\nleaving the corpse alone. Strange things always happen in the house\r\nwhere a corpse has thus been left: so we think that it will be better\r\nfor you to come away with us. We can find you good lodging in the other\r\nvillage. But perhaps, as you are a priest, you have no fear of demons\r\nor evil spirits; and, if you are not afraid of being left alone with\r\nthe body, you will be very welcome to the use of this poor house.\r\nHowever, I must tell you that nobody, except a priest, would dare to\r\nremain here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMus\xc5\x8d made answer:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your kind intention and your generous hospitality, I am deeply\r\ngrateful. But I am sorry that you did not tell me of your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath when I came;\xe2\x80\x94for, though I was a little tired, I certainly was\r\nnot so tired that I should have found difficulty in doing my duty as a\r\npriest. Had you told me, I could have performed the service before your\r\ndeparture. As it is, I shall perform the service after you have gone\r\naway; and I shall stay by the body until morning. I do not know what\r\nyou mean by your words about the danger of staying here alone; but I am\r\nnot afraid of ghosts or demons: therefore please to feel no anxiety on\r\nmy account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man appeared to be rejoiced by these assurances, and\r\nexpressed his gratitude in fitting words. Then the other members of the\r\nfamily, and the folk assembled in the adjoining room, having been told\r\nof the priest\xe2\x80\x99s kind promises, came to thank him,\xe2\x80\x94after which the\r\nmaster of the house said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, reverend Sir, much as we regret to leave you alone, we must bid\r\nyou farewell. By the rule of our village, none of us can stay here\r\nafter midnight. We beg, kind Sir, that you will take every care of your\r\nhonorable body, while we are unable to attend upon you. And if you\r\nhappen to hear or see anything strange during our absence, please tell\r\nus of the matter when we return in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll then left the house, except the priest, who went to the room where\r\nthe dead body was lying. The usual offerings had been set before the\r\ncorpse; and a small Buddhist lamp\xe2\x80\x94_t\xc5\x8dmy\xc5\x8d_\xe2\x80\x94was burning. The priest\r\nrecited the service, and performed the funeral ceremonies,\xe2\x80\x94after which\r\nhe entered into meditation. So meditating he remained through several\r\nsilent hours; and there was no sound in the deserted village. But, when\r\nthe hush of the night was at its deepest, there noiselessly entered a\r\nShape, vague and vast; and in the same moment Mus\xc5\x8d found himself\r\nwithout power to move or speak. He saw that Shape lift the corpse, as\r\nwith hands, devour it, more quickly than a cat devours a rat,\xe2\x80\x94beginning\r\nat the head, and eating everything: the hair and the bones and even the\r\nshroud. And the monstrous Thing, having thus consumed the body, turned\r\nto the offerings, and ate them also. Then it went away, as mysteriously\r\nas it had come.\r\n\r\nWhen the villagers returned next morning, they found the priest\r\nawaiting them at the door of the headman\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling. All in turn\r\nsaluted him; and when they had entered, and looked about the room, no\r\none expressed any surprise at the disappearance of the dead body and\r\nthe offerings. But the master of the house said to Mus\xc5\x8d:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverent Sir, you have probably seen unpleasant things during the\r\nnight: all of us were anxious about you. But now we are very happy to\r\nfind you alive and unharmed. Gladly we would have stayed with you, if\r\nit had been possible. But the law of our village, as I told you last\r\nevening, obliges us to quit our houses after a death has taken place,\r\nand to leave the corpse alone. Whenever this law has been broken,\r\nheretofore, some great misfortune has followed. Whenever it is obeyed,\r\nwe find that the corpse and the offerings disappear during our absence.\r\nPerhaps you have seen the cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mus\xc5\x8d told of the dim and awful Shape that had entered the\r\ndeath-chamber to devour the body and the offerings. No person seemed to\r\nbe surprised by his narration; and the master of the house observed:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have told us, reverend Sir, agrees with what has been said\r\nabout this matter from ancient time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMus\xc5\x8d then inquired:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not the priest on the hill sometimes perform the funeral service\r\nfor your dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat priest?\xe2\x80\x9d the young man asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest who yesterday evening directed me to this village,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Mus\xc5\x8d. \xe2\x80\x9cI called at his _anjitsu_ on the hill yonder. He\r\nrefused me lodging, but told me the way here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe listeners looked at each other, as in astonishment; and, after a\r\nmoment of silence, the master of the house said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReverend Sir, there is no priest and there is no _anjitsu_ on the\r\nhill. For the time of many generations there has not been any\r\nresident-priest in this neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMus\xc5\x8d said nothing more on the subject; for it was evident that his kind\r\nhosts supposed him to have been deluded by some goblin. But after\r\nhaving bidden them farewell, and obtained all necessary information as\r\nto his road, he determined to look again for the hermitage on the hill,\r\nand so to ascertain whether he had really been deceived. He found the\r\n_anjitsu_ without any difficulty; and, this time, its aged occupant\r\ninvited him to enter. When he had done so, the hermit humbly bowed down\r\nbefore him, exclaiming:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am ashamed!\xe2\x80\x94I am very much ashamed!\xe2\x80\x94I am\r\nexceedingly ashamed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need not be ashamed for having refused me shelter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mus\xc5\x8d.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou directed me to the village yonder, where I was very kindly\r\ntreated; and I thank you for that favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can give no man shelter,\xe2\x80\x9d the recluse made answer;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand it is not\r\nfor the refusal that I am ashamed. I am ashamed only that you should\r\nhave seen me in my real shape,\xe2\x80\x94for it was I who devoured the corpse and\r\nthe offerings last night before your eyes... Know, reverend Sir, that I\r\nam a _jikininki_,[1]\xe2\x80\x94an eater of human flesh. Have pity upon me, and\r\nsuffer me to confess the secret fault by which I became reduced to this\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA long, long time ago, I was a priest in this desolate region. There\r\nwas no other priest for many leagues around. So, in that time, the\r\nbodies of the mountain-folk who died used to be brought here,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\nfrom great distances,\xe2\x80\x94in order that I might repeat over them the holy\r\nservice. But I repeated the service and performed the rites only as a\r\nmatter of business;\xe2\x80\x94I thought only of the food and the clothes that my\r\nsacred profession enabled me to gain. And because of this selfish\r\nimpiety I was reborn, immediately after my death, into the state of a\r\n_jikininki_. Since then I have been obliged to feed upon the corpses of\r\nthe people who die in this district: every one of them I must devour in\r\nthe way that you saw last night... Now, reverend Sir, let me beseech\r\nyou to perform a S\xc3\xa9gaki-service[2] for me: help me by your prayers, I\r\nentreat you, so that I may be soon able to escape from this horrible\r\nstate of existence\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the hermit uttered this petition than he disappeared; and\r\nthe hermitage also disappeared at the same instant. And Mus\xc5\x8d Kokushi\r\nfound himself kneeling alone in the high grass, beside an ancient and\r\nmoss-grown tomb of the form called _go-rin-ishi_,[3] which seemed to be\r\nthe tomb of a priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUJINA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Akasaka Road, in T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d, there is a slope called\r\nKii-no-kuni-zaka,\xe2\x80\x94which means the Slope of the Province of Kii. I do\r\nnot know why it is called the Slope of the Province of Kii. On one side\r\nof this slope you see an ancient moat, deep and very wide, with high\r\ngreen banks rising up to some place of gardens;\xe2\x80\x94and on the other side\r\nof the road extend the long and lofty walls of an imperial palace.\r\nBefore the era of street-lamps and jinrikishas, this neighborhood was\r\nvery lonesome after dark; and belated pedestrians would go miles out of\r\ntheir way rather than mount the Kii-no-kuni-zaka, alone, after sunset.\r\n\r\nAll because of a Mujina that used to walk there. (1)\r\n\r\nThe last man who saw the Mujina was an old merchant of the Ky\xc5\x8dbashi\r\nquarter, who died about thirty years ago. This is the story, as he told\r\nit:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOne night, at a late hour, he was hurrying up the Kii-no-kuni-zaka,\r\nwhen he perceived a woman crouching by the moat, all alone, and weeping\r\nbitterly. Fearing that she intended to drown herself, he stopped to\r\noffer her any assistance or consolation in his power. She appeared to\r\nbe a slight and graceful person, handsomely dressed; and her hair was\r\narranged like that of a young girl of good family. \xe2\x80\x9cO-joch\xc5\xab,\xe2\x80\x9d[1] he\r\nexclaimed, approaching her,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO-joch\xc5\xab, do not cry like that!... Tell me\r\nwhat the trouble is; and if there be any way to help you, I shall be\r\nglad to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d (He really meant what he said; for he was a very\r\nkind man.) But she continued to weep,\xe2\x80\x94hiding her face from him with one\r\nof her long sleeves. \xe2\x80\x9cO-joch\xc5\xab,\xe2\x80\x9d he said again, as gently as he\r\ncould,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cplease, please listen to me!... This is no place for a young\r\nlady at night! Do not cry, I implore you!\xe2\x80\x94only tell me how I may be of\r\nsome help to you!\xe2\x80\x9d Slowly she rose up, but turned her back to him, and\r\ncontinued to moan and sob behind her sleeve. He laid his hand lightly\r\nupon her shoulder, and pleaded:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cO-joch\xc5\xab!\xe2\x80\x94O-joch\xc5\xab!\xe2\x80\x94O-joch\xc5\xab!... Listen\r\nto me, just for one little moment!... O-joch\xc5\xab!\xe2\x80\x94O-joch\xc5\xab!\xe2\x80\x9d... Then that\r\nO-joch\xc5\xab turned around, and dropped her sleeve, and stroked her face\r\nwith her hand;\xe2\x80\x94and the man saw that she had no eyes or nose or\r\nmouth,\xe2\x80\x94and he screamed and ran away. (2)\r\n\r\nUp Kii-no-kuni-zaka he ran and ran; and all was black and empty before\r\nhim. On and on he ran, never daring to look back; and at last he saw a\r\nlantern, so far away that it looked like the gleam of a firefly; and he\r\nmade for it. It proved to be only the lantern of an itinerant\r\n_soba_-seller,[2] who had set down his stand by the road-side; but any\r\nlight and any human companionship was good after that experience; and\r\nhe flung himself down at the feet of the _soba_-seller, crying out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x94aa!!\xe2\x80\x94_aa!!!_\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Kor\xc3\xa9! kor\xc3\xa9!_\xe2\x80\x9d (3) roughly exclaimed the soba-man. \xe2\x80\x9cHere! what is the\r\nmatter with you? Anybody hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94nobody hurt me,\xe2\x80\x9d panted the other,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly... _Ah!\xe2\x80\x94aa!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x94Only scared you?\xe2\x80\x9d queried the peddler, unsympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cRobbers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot robbers,\xe2\x80\x94not robbers,\xe2\x80\x9d gasped the terrified man... \xe2\x80\x9cI saw... I saw\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x94by the moat;\xe2\x80\x94and she showed me... _Ah!_ I cannot tell you what\r\nshe showed me!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_H\xc3\xa9!_ (4) Was it anything like THIS that she showed you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nsoba-man, stroking his own face\xe2\x80\x94which therewith became like unto an\r\nEgg... And, simultaneously, the light went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROKURO-KUBI\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly five hundred years ago there was a samurai, named Isogai\r\nH\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafdaza\xc3\xabmon Tak\xc3\xa9tsura, in the service of the Lord Kikuji, of Ky\xc5\xabsh\xc5\xab.\r\nThis Isogai had inherited, from many warlike ancestors, a natural\r\naptitude for military exercises, and extraordinary strength. While yet\r\na boy he had surpassed his teachers in the art of swordsmanship, in\r\narchery, and in the use of the spear, and had displayed all the\r\ncapacities of a daring and skillful soldier. Afterwards, in the time of\r\nthe Eiky\xc5\x8d[1] war, he so distinguished himself that high honors were\r\nbestowed upon him. But when the house of Kikuji came to ruin, Isogai\r\nfound himself without a master. He might then easily have obtained\r\nservice under another daimy\xc5\x8d; but as he had never sought distinction\r\nfor his own sake alone, and as his heart remained true to his former\r\nlord, he preferred to give up the world. So he cut off his hair, and\r\nbecame a traveling priest,\xe2\x80\x94taking the Buddhist name of Kwairy\xc5\x8d.\r\n\r\nBut always, under the _koromo_[2] of the priest, Kwairy\xc5\x8d kept warm\r\nwithin him the heart of the samurai. As in other years he had laughed\r\nat peril, so now also he scorned danger; and in all weathers and all\r\nseasons he journeyed to preach the good Law in places where no other\r\npriest would have dared to go. For that age was an age of violence and\r\ndisorder; and upon the highways there was no security for the solitary\r\ntraveler, even if he happened to be a priest.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his first long journey, Kwairy\xc5\x8d had occasion to visit\r\nthe province of Kai. (1) One evening, as he was traveling through the\r\nmountains of that province, darkness overcame him in a very lonesome\r\ndistrict, leagues away from any village. So he resigned himself to pass\r\nthe night under the stars; and having found a suitable grassy spot, by\r\nthe roadside, he lay down there, and prepared to sleep. He had always\r\nwelcomed discomfort; and even a bare rock was for him a good bed, when\r\nnothing better could be found, and the root of a pine-tree an excellent\r\npillow. His body was iron; and he never troubled himself about dews or\r\nrain or frost or snow.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he lain down when a man came along the road, carrying an\r\naxe and a great bundle of chopped wood. This woodcutter halted on\r\nseeing Kwairy\xc5\x8d lying down, and, after a moment of silent observation,\r\nsaid to him in a tone of great surprise:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of a man can you be, good Sir, that you dare to lie down\r\nalone in such a place as this?... There are haunters about here,\xe2\x80\x94many\r\nof them. Are you not afraid of Hairy Things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d cheerfully answered Kwairy\xc5\x8d, \xe2\x80\x9cI am only a wandering\r\npriest,\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98Cloud-and-Water-Guest,\xe2\x80\x99 as folks call it:\r\n_Unsui-no-ryokaku_. (2) And I am not in the least afraid of Hairy\r\nThings,\xe2\x80\x94if you mean goblin-foxes, or goblin-badgers, or any creatures\r\nof that kind. As for lonesome places, I like them: they are suitable\r\nfor meditation. I am accustomed to sleeping in the open air: and I have\r\nlearned never to be anxious about my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be indeed a brave man, Sir Priest,\xe2\x80\x9d the peasant responded,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto lie down here! This place has a bad name,\xe2\x80\x94a very bad name. But, as\r\nthe proverb has it, _Kunshi ayayuki ni chikayorazu_ [\xe2\x80\x98The superior man\r\ndoes not needlessly expose himself to peril\xe2\x80\x99]; and I must assure you,\r\nSir, that it is very dangerous to sleep here. Therefore, although my\r\nhouse is only a wretched thatched hut, let me beg of you to come home\r\nwith me at once. In the way of food, I have nothing to offer you; but\r\nthere is a roof at least, and you can sleep under it without risk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke earnestly; and Kwairy\xc5\x8d, liking the kindly tone of the man,\r\naccepted this modest offer. The woodcutter guided him along a narrow\r\npath, leading up from the main road through mountain-forest. It was a\r\nrough and dangerous path,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes skirting precipices,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\r\noffering nothing but a network of slippery roots for the foot to rest\r\nupon,\xe2\x80\x94sometimes winding over or between masses of jagged rock. But at\r\nlast Kwairy\xc5\x8d found himself upon a cleared space at the top of a hill,\r\nwith a full moon shining overhead; and he saw before him a small\r\nthatched cottage, cheerfully lighted from within. The woodcutter led\r\nhim to a shed at the back of the house, whither water had been\r\nconducted, through bamboo-pipes, from some neighboring stream; and the\r\ntwo men washed their feet. Beyond the shed was a vegetable garden, and\r\na grove of cedars and bamboos; and beyond the trees appeared the\r\nglimmer of a cascade, pouring from some loftier height, and swaying in\r\nthe moonshine like a long white robe.\r\n\r\nAs Kwairy\xc5\x8d entered the cottage with his guide, he perceived four\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x94men and women\xe2\x80\x94warming their hands at a little fire kindled in\r\nthe _ro_[3] of the principle apartment. They bowed low to the priest,\r\nand greeted him in the most respectful manner. Kwairy\xc5\x8d wondered that\r\npersons so poor, and dwelling in such a solitude, should be aware of\r\nthe polite forms of greeting. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are good people,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to\r\nhimself; \xe2\x80\x9cand they must have been taught by some one well acquainted\r\nwith the rules of propriety.\xe2\x80\x9d Then turning to his host,\xe2\x80\x94the _aruji_, or\r\nhouse-master, as the others called him,\xe2\x80\x94Kwairy\xc5\x8d said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the kindness of your speech, and from the very polite welcome\r\ngiven me by your household, I imagine that you have not always been a\r\nwoodcutter. Perhaps you formerly belonged to one of the upper classes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSmiling, the woodcutter answered:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you are not mistaken. Though now living as you find me, I was\r\nonce a person of some distinction. My story is the story of a ruined\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94ruined by my own fault. I used to be in the service of a daimy\xc5\x8d;\r\nand my rank in that service was not inconsiderable. But I loved women\r\nand wine too well; and under the influence of passion I acted wickedly.\r\nMy selfishness brought about the ruin of our house, and caused the\r\ndeath of many persons. Retribution followed me; and I long remained a\r\nfugitive in the land. Now I often pray that I may be able to make some\r\natonement for the evil which I did, and to reestablish the ancestral\r\nhome. But I fear that I shall never find any way of so doing.\r\nNevertheless, I try to overcome the karma of my errors by sincere\r\nrepentance, and by helping, as far as I can, those who are\r\nunfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKwairy\xc5\x8d was pleased by this announcement of good resolve; and he said\r\nto the _aruji:_\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, I have had occasion to observe that men, prone to folly in\r\ntheir youth, may in after years become very earnest in right living. In\r\nthe holy s\xc3\xbbtras it is written that those strongest in wrong-doing can\r\nbecome, by power of good resolve, the strongest in right-doing. I do\r\nnot doubt that you have a good heart; and I hope that better fortune\r\nwill come to you. To-night I shall recite the s\xc3\xbbtras for your sake, and\r\npray that you may obtain the force to overcome the karma of any past\r\nerrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith these assurances, Kwairy\xc5\x8d bade the _aruji_ good-night; and his\r\nhost showed him to a very small side-room, where a bed had been made\r\nready. Then all went to sleep except the priest, who began to read the\r\ns\xc3\xbbtras by the light of a paper lantern. Until a late hour he continued\r\nto read and pray: then he opened a little window in his little\r\nsleeping-room, to take a last look at the landscape before lying down.\r\nThe night was beautiful: there was no cloud in the sky: there was no\r\nwind; and the strong moonlight threw down sharp black shadows of\r\nfoliage, and glittered on the dews of the garden. Shrillings of\r\ncrickets and bell-insects (3) made a musical tumult; and the sound of\r\nthe neighboring cascade deepened with the night. Kwairy\xc5\x8d felt thirsty\r\nas he listened to the noise of the water; and, remembering the bamboo\r\naqueduct at the rear of the house, he thought that he could go there\r\nand get a drink without disturbing the sleeping household. Very gently\r\nhe pushed apart the sliding-screens that separated his room from the\r\nmain apartment; and he saw, by the light of the lantern, five recumbent\r\nbodies\xe2\x80\x94without heads!\r\n\r\nFor one instant he stood bewildered,\xe2\x80\x94imagining a crime. But in another\r\nmoment he perceived that there was no blood, and that the headless\r\nnecks did not look as if they had been cut. Then he thought to\r\nhimself:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEither this is an illusion made by goblins, or I have been\r\nlured into the dwelling of a Rokuro-Kubi... (4) In the book _S\xc5\x8dshinki_\r\n(5) it is written that if one find the body of a Rokuro-Kubi without\r\nits head, and remove the body to another place, the head will never be\r\nable to join itself again to the neck. And the book further says that\r\nwhen the head comes back and finds that its body has been moved, it\r\nwill strike itself upon the floor three times,\xe2\x80\x94bounding like a\r\nball,\xe2\x80\x94and will pant as in great fear, and presently die. Now, if these\r\nbe Rokuro-Kubi, they mean me no good;\xe2\x80\x94so I shall be justified in\r\nfollowing the instructions of the book.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nHe seized the body of the aruji by the feet, pulled it to the window,\r\nand pushed it out. Then he went to the back-door, which he found\r\nbarred; and he surmised that the heads had made their exit through the\r\nsmoke-hole in the roof, which had been left open. Gently unbarring the\r\ndoor, he made his way to the garden, and proceeded with all possible\r\ncaution to the grove beyond it. He heard voices talking in the grove;\r\nand he went in the direction of the voices,\xe2\x80\x94stealing from shadow to\r\nshadow, until he reached a good hiding-place. Then, from behind a\r\ntrunk, he caught sight of the heads,\xe2\x80\x94all five of them,\xe2\x80\x94flitting about,\r\nand chatting as they flitted. They were eating worms and insects which\r\nthey found on the ground or among the trees. Presently the head of the\r\naruji stopped eating and said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that traveling priest who came to-night!\xe2\x80\x94how fat all his body is!\r\nWhen we shall have eaten him, our bellies will be well filled... I was\r\nfoolish to talk to him as I did;\xe2\x80\x94it only set him to reciting the s\xc3\xbbtras\r\non behalf of my soul! To go near him while he is reciting would be\r\ndifficult; and we cannot touch him so long as he is praying. But as it\r\nis now nearly morning, perhaps he has gone to sleep... Some one of you\r\ngo to the house and see what the fellow is doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother head\xe2\x80\x94the head of a young woman\xe2\x80\x94immediately rose up and flitted\r\nto the house, lightly as a bat. After a few minutes it came back, and\r\ncried out huskily, in a tone of great alarm:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat traveling priest is not in the house;\xe2\x80\x94he is gone! But that is not\r\nthe worst of the matter. He has taken the body of our aruji; and I do\r\nnot know where he has put it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this announcement the head of the aruji\xe2\x80\x94distinctly visible in the\r\nmoonlight\xe2\x80\x94assumed a frightful aspect: its eyes opened monstrously; its\r\nhair stood up bristling; and its teeth gnashed. Then a cry burst from\r\nits lips; and\xe2\x80\x94weeping tears of rage\xe2\x80\x94it exclaimed:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince my body has been moved, to rejoin it is not possible! Then I\r\nmust die!... And all through the work of that priest! Before I die I\r\nwill get at that priest!\xe2\x80\x94I will tear him!\xe2\x80\x94I will devour him!... _And\r\nthere he is_\xe2\x80\x94behind that tree!\xe2\x80\x94hiding behind that tree! See him!\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfat coward!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nIn the same moment the head of the aruji, followed by the other four\r\nheads, sprang at Kwairy\xc5\x8d. But the strong priest had already armed\r\nhimself by plucking up a young tree; and with that tree he struck the\r\nheads as they came,\xe2\x80\x94knocking them from him with tremendous blows. Four\r\nof them fled away. But the head of the aruji, though battered again and\r\nagain, desperately continued to bound at the priest, and at last caught\r\nhim by the left sleeve of his robe. Kwairy\xc5\x8d, however, as quickly\r\ngripped the head by its topknot, and repeatedly struck it. It did not\r\nrelease its hold; but it uttered a long moan, and thereafter ceased to\r\nstruggle. It was dead. But its teeth still held the sleeve; and, for\r\nall his great strength, Kwairy\xc5\x8d could not force open the jaws.\r\n\r\nWith the head still hanging to his sleeve he went back to the house,\r\nand there caught sight of the other four Rokuro-Kubi squatting\r\ntogether, with their bruised and bleeding heads reunited to their\r\nbodies. But when they perceived him at the back-door all screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\npriest! the priest!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and fled, through the other doorway, out into the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nEastward the sky was brightening; day was about to dawn; and Kwairy\xc5\x8d\r\nknew that the power of the goblins was limited to the hours of\r\ndarkness. He looked at the head clinging to his sleeve,\xe2\x80\x94its face all\r\nfouled with blood and foam and clay; and he laughed aloud as he thought\r\nto himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a _miyag\xc3\xa9!_[4]\xe2\x80\x94the head of a goblin!\xe2\x80\x9d After which he\r\ngathered together his few belongings, and leisurely descended the\r\nmountain to continue his journey.\r\n\r\nRight on he journeyed, until he came to Suwa in Shinano; (6) and into\r\nthe main street of Suwa he solemnly strode, with the head dangling at\r\nhis elbow. Then woman fainted, and children screamed and ran away; and\r\nthere was a great crowding and clamoring until the _torit\xc3\xa9_ (as the\r\npolice in those days were called) seized the priest, and took him to\r\njail. For they supposed the head to be the head of a murdered man who,\r\nin the moment of being killed, had caught the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve in his\r\nteeth. As for Kwairy\xc5\x8d, he only smiled and said nothing when they\r\nquestioned him. So, after having passed a night in prison, he was\r\nbrought before the magistrates of the district. Then he was ordered to\r\nexplain how he, a priest, had been found with the head of a man\r\nfastened to his sleeve, and why he had dared thus shamelessly to parade\r\nhis crime in the sight of people.\r\n\r\nKwairy\xc5\x8d laughed long and loudly at these questions; and then he said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSirs, I did not fasten the head to my sleeve: it fastened itself\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94much against my will. And I have not committed any crime. For\r\nthis is not the head of a man; it is the head of a goblin;\xe2\x80\x94and, if I\r\ncaused the death of the goblin, I did not do so by any shedding of\r\nblood, but simply by taking the precautions necessary to assure my own\r\nsafety.\xe2\x80\x9d... And he proceeded to relate the whole of the\r\nadventure,\xe2\x80\x94bursting into another hearty laugh as he told of his\r\nencounter with the five heads.\r\n\r\nBut the magistrates did not laugh. They judged him to be a hardened\r\ncriminal, and his story an insult to their intelligence. Therefore,\r\nwithout further questioning, they decided to order his immediate\r\nexecution,\xe2\x80\x94all of them except one, a very old man. This aged officer\r\nhad made no remark during the trial; but, after having heard the\r\nopinion of his colleagues, he rose up, and said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us first examine the head carefully; for this, I think, has not\r\nyet been done. If the priest has spoken truth, the head itself should\r\nbear witness for him... Bring the head here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the head, still holding in its teeth the _koromo_ that had been\r\nstripped from Kwairy\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, was put before the judges. The old\r\nman turned it round and round, carefully examined it, and discovered,\r\non the nape of its neck, several strange red characters. He called the\r\nattention of his colleagues to these, and also bade them observe that\r\nthe edges of the neck nowhere presented the appearance of having been\r\ncut by any weapon. On the contrary, the line of leverance was smooth as\r\nthe line at which a falling leaf detaches itself from the stem... Then\r\nsaid the elder:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite sure that the priest told us nothing but the truth. This is\r\nthe head of a Rokuro-Kubi. In the book _Nan-h\xc5\x8d-\xc3\xaf-butsu-shi_ it is\r\nwritten that certain red characters can always be found upon the nape\r\nof the neck of a real Rokuro-Kubi. There are the characters: you can\r\nsee for yourselves that they have not been painted. Moreover, it is\r\nwell known that such goblins have been dwelling in the mountains of the\r\nprovince of Kai from very ancient time... But you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\nturning to Kwairy\xc5\x8d,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat sort of sturdy priest may you be? Certainly\r\nyou have given proof of a courage that few priests possess; and you\r\nhave the air of a soldier rather than a priest. Perhaps you once\r\nbelonged to the samurai-class?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have guessed rightly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Kwairy\xc5\x8d responded. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore becoming a\r\npriest, I long followed the profession of arms; and in those days I\r\nnever feared man or devil. My name then was Isogai H\xc3\xa9\xc3\xafdaza\xc3\xabmon\r\nTak\xc3\xa9tsura of Ky\xc5\xabsh\xc5\xab: there may be some among you who remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of that name, a murmur of admiration filled the\r\ncourt-room; for there were many present who remembered it. And Kwairy\xc5\x8d\r\nimmediately found himself among friends instead of judges,\xe2\x80\x94friends\r\nanxious to prove their admiration by fraternal kindness. With honor\r\nthey escorted him to the residence of the daimy\xc5\x8d, who welcomed him, and\r\nfeasted him, and made him a handsome present before allowing him to\r\ndepart. When Kwairy\xc5\x8d left Suwa, he was as happy as any priest is\r\npermitted to be in this transitory world. As for the head, he took it\r\nwith him,\xe2\x80\x94jocosely insisting that he intended it for a _miyag\xc3\xa9_.\r\n\r\nAnd now it only remains to tell what became of the head.\r\n\r\nA day or two after leaving Suwa, Kwairy\xc5\x8d met with a robber, who stopped\r\nhim in a lonesome place, and bade him strip. Kwairy\xc5\x8d at once removed\r\nhis _koromo_, and offered it to the robber, who then first perceived\r\nwhat was hanging to the sleeve. Though brave, the highwayman was\r\nstartled: he dropped the garment, and sprang back. Then he cried\r\nout:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x94what kind of a priest are you? Why, you are a worse man than\r\nI am! It is true that I have killed people; but I never walked about\r\nwith anybody\xe2\x80\x99s head fastened to my sleeve... Well, Sir priest, I\r\nsuppose we are of the same calling; and I must say that I admire\r\nyou!... Now that head would be of use to me: I could frighten people\r\nwith it. Will you sell it? You can have my robe in exchange for your\r\n_koromo;_ and I will give you five _ry\xc5\x8d_ for the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKwairy\xc5\x8d answered:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall let you have the head and the robe if you insist; but I must\r\ntell you that this is not the head of a man. It is a goblin\xe2\x80\x99s head. So,\r\nif you buy it, and have any trouble in consequence, please to remember\r\nthat you were not deceived by me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a nice priest you are!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the robber. \xe2\x80\x9cYou kill men, and\r\njest about it!... But I am really in earnest. Here is my robe; and here\r\nis the money;\xe2\x80\x94and let me have the head... What is the use of joking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kwairy\xc5\x8d. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not joking. The only joke\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nthere be any joke at all\xe2\x80\x94is that you are fool enough to pay good money\r\nfor a goblin\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d And Kwairy\xc5\x8d, loudly laughing, went upon his way.\r\n\r\nThus the robber got the head and the _koromo;_ and for some time he\r\nplayed goblin-priest upon the highways. But, reaching the neighborhood\r\nof Suwa, he there leaned the true story of the head; and he then became\r\nafraid that the spirit of the Rokuro-Kubi might give him trouble. So he\r\nmade up his mind to take back the head to the place from which it had\r\ncome, and to bury it with its body. He found his way to the lonely\r\ncottage in the mountains of Kai; but nobody was there, and he could not\r\ndiscover the body. Therefore he buried the head by itself, in the grove\r\nbehind the cottage; and he had a tombstone set up over the grave; and\r\nhe caused a S\xc3\xa9gaki-service to be performed on behalf of the spirit of\r\nthe Rokuro-Kubi. And that tombstone\xe2\x80\x94known as the Tombstone of the\r\nRokuro-Kubi\xe2\x80\x94may be seen (at least so the Japanese story-teller\r\ndeclares) even unto this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEAD SECRET\r\n\r\n\r\nA long time ago, in the province of Tamba (1), there lived a rich\r\nmerchant named Inamuraya Gensuk\xc3\xa9. He had a daughter called O-Sono. As\r\nshe was very clever and pretty, he thought it would be a pity to let\r\nher grow up with only such teaching as the country-teachers could give\r\nher: so he sent her, in care of some trusty attendants, to Ky\xc5\x8dto, that\r\nshe might be trained in the polite accomplishments taught to the ladies\r\nof the capital. After she had thus been educated, she was married to a\r\nfriend of her father\xe2\x80\x99s family\xe2\x80\x94a merchant named Nagaraya;\xe2\x80\x94and she lived\r\nhappily with him for nearly four years. They had one child,\xe2\x80\x94a boy. But\r\nO-Sono fell ill and died, in the fourth year after her marriage.\r\n\r\nOn the night after the funeral of O-Sono, her little son said that his\r\nmamma had come back, and was in the room upstairs. She had smiled at\r\nhim, but would not talk to him: so he became afraid, and ran away. Then\r\nsome of the family went upstairs to the room which had been O-Sono\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand they were startled to see, by the light of a small lamp which had\r\nbeen kindled before a shrine in that room, the figure of the dead\r\nmother. She appeared as if standing in front of a _tansu_, or chest of\r\ndrawers, that still contained her ornaments and her wearing-apparel.\r\nHer head and shoulders could be very distinctly seen; but from the\r\nwaist downwards the figure thinned into invisibility;\xe2\x80\x94it was like an\r\nimperfect reflection of her, and transparent as a shadow on water.\r\n\r\nThen the folk were afraid, and left the room. Below they consulted\r\ntogether; and the mother of O-Sono\xe2\x80\x99s husband said: \xe2\x80\x9cA woman is fond of\r\nher small things; and O-Sono was much attached to her belongings.\r\nPerhaps she has come back to look at them. Many dead persons will do\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x94unless the things be given to the parish-temple. If we present\r\nO-Sono\xe2\x80\x99s robes and girdles to the temple, her spirit will probably find\r\nrest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that this should be done as soon as possible. So on the\r\nfollowing morning the drawers were emptied; and all of O-Sono\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nornaments and dresses were taken to the temple. But she came back the\r\nnext night, and looked at the _tansu_ as before. And she came back also\r\non the night following, and the night after that, and every night;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe house became a house of fear.\r\n\r\nThe mother of O-Sono\xe2\x80\x99s husband then went to the parish-temple, and told\r\nthe chief priest all that had happened, and asked for ghostly counsel.\r\nThe temple was a Zen temple; and the head-priest was a learned old man,\r\nknown as Daigen Osh\xc5\x8d. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be something about which she\r\nis anxious, in or near that _tansu_.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut we emptied all the drawers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nreplied the woman;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing in the _tansu_.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDaigen Osh\xc5\x8d, \xe2\x80\x9cto-night I shall go to your house, and keep watch in that\r\nroom, and see what can be done. You must give orders that no person\r\nshall enter the room while I am watching, unless I call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter sundown, Daigen Osh\xc5\x8d went to the house, and found the room made\r\nready for him. He remained there alone, reading the s\xc3\xbbtras; and nothing\r\nappeared until after the Hour of the Rat.[1] Then the figure of O-Sono\r\nsuddenly outlined itself in front of the _tansu_. Her face had a\r\nwistful look; and she kept her eyes fixed upon the _tansu_.\r\n\r\nThe priest uttered the holy formula prescribed in such cases, and then,\r\naddressing the figure by the _kaimy\xc5\x8d_[2] of O-Sono, said:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI have come\r\nhere in order to help you. Perhaps in that _tansu_ there is something\r\nabout which you have reason to feel anxious. Shall I try to find it for\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d The shadow appeared to give assent by a slight motion of the\r\nhead; and the priest, rising, opened the top drawer. It was empty.\r\nSuccessively he opened the second, the third, and the fourth drawer;\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nsearched carefully behind them and beneath them;\xe2\x80\x94he carefully examined\r\nthe interior of the chest. He found nothing. But the figure remained\r\ngazing as wistfully as before. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can she want?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the priest.\r\nSuddenly it occurred to him that there might be something hidden under\r\nthe paper with which the drawers were lined. He removed the lining of\r\nthe first drawer:\xe2\x80\x94nothing! He removed the lining of the second and\r\nthird drawers:\xe2\x80\x94still nothing. But under the lining of the lowermost\r\ndrawer he found\xe2\x80\x94a letter. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the thing about which you have been\r\ntroubled?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. The shadow of the woman turned toward him,\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nfaint gaze fixed upon the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I burn it for you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\nShe bowed before him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be burned in the temple this very\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d he promised;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand no one shall read it, except myself.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfigure smiled and vanished.\r\n\r\nDawn was breaking as the priest descended the stairs, to find the\r\nfamily waiting anxiously below. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to them:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will not appear again.\xe2\x80\x9d And she never did.\r\n\r\nThe letter was burned. It was a love-letter written to O-Sono in the\r\ntime of her studies at Ky\xc5\x8dto. But the priest alone knew what was in it;\r\nand the secret died with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYUKI-ONNA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a village of Musashi Province (1), there lived two woodcutters:\r\nMosaku and Minokichi. At the time of which I am speaking, Mosaku was an\r\nold man; and Minokichi, his apprentice, was a lad of eighteen years.\r\nEvery day they went together to a forest situated about five miles from\r\ntheir village. On the way to that forest there is a wide river to\r\ncross; and there is a ferry-boat. Several times a bridge was built\r\nwhere the ferry is; but the bridge was each time carried away by a\r\nflood. No common bridge can resist the current there when the river\r\nrises.\r\n\r\nMosaku and Minokichi were on their way home, one very cold evening,\r\nwhen a great snowstorm overtook them. They reached the ferry; and they\r\nfound that the boatman had gone away, leaving his boat on the other\r\nside of the river. It was no day for swimming; and the woodcutters took\r\nshelter in the ferryman\xe2\x80\x99s hut,\xe2\x80\x94thinking themselves lucky to find any\r\nshelter at all. There was no brazier in the hut, nor any place in which\r\nto make a fire: it was only a two-mat[1] hut, with a single door, but\r\nno window. Mosaku and Minokichi fastened the door, and lay down to\r\nrest, with their straw rain-coats over them. At first they did not feel\r\nvery cold; and they thought that the storm would soon be over.\r\n\r\nThe old man almost immediately fell asleep; but the boy, Minokichi, lay\r\nawake a long time, listening to the awful wind, and the continual\r\nslashing of the snow against the door. The river was roaring; and the\r\nhut swayed and creaked like a junk at sea. It was a terrible storm; and\r\nthe air was every moment becoming colder; and Minokichi shivered under\r\nhis rain-coat. But at last, in spite of the cold, he too fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe was awakened by a showering of snow in his face. The door of the hut\r\nhad been forced open; and, by the snow-light (_yuki-akari_), he saw a\r\nwoman in the room,\xe2\x80\x94a woman all in white. She was bending above Mosaku,\r\nand blowing her breath upon him;\xe2\x80\x94and her breath was like a bright white\r\nsmoke. Almost in the same moment she turned to Minokichi, and stooped\r\nover him. He tried to cry out, but found that he could not utter any\r\nsound. The white woman bent down over him, lower and lower, until her\r\nface almost touched him; and he saw that she was very beautiful,\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nher eyes made him afraid. For a little time she continued to look at\r\nhim;\xe2\x80\x94then she smiled, and she whispered:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI intended to treat you like\r\nthe other man. But I cannot help feeling some pity for you,\xe2\x80\x94because you\r\nare so young... You are a pretty boy, Minokichi; and I will not hurt\r\nyou now. But, if you ever tell anybody\xe2\x80\x94even your own mother\xe2\x80\x94about what\r\nyou have seen this night, I shall know it; and then I will kill you...\r\nRemember what I say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] BLOWING HER BREATH UPON HIM\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these words, she turned from him, and passed through the doorway.\r\nThen he found himself able to move; and he sprang up, and looked out.\r\nBut the woman was nowhere to be seen; and the snow was driving\r\nfuriously into the hut. Minokichi closed the door, and secured it by\r\nfixing several billets of wood against it. He wondered if the wind had\r\nblown it open;\xe2\x80\x94he thought that he might have been only dreaming, and\r\nmight have mistaken the gleam of the snow-light in the doorway for the\r\nfigure of a white woman: but he could not be sure. He called to Mosaku,\r\nand was frightened because the old man did not answer. He put out his\r\nhand in the dark, and touched Mosaku\xe2\x80\x99s face, and found that it was ice!\r\nMosaku was stark and dead...\r\n\r\nBy dawn the storm was over; and when the ferryman returned to his\r\nstation, a little after sunrise, he found Minokichi lying senseless\r\nbeside the frozen body of Mosaku. Minokichi was promptly cared for, and\r\nsoon came to himself; but he remained a long time ill from the effects\r\nof the cold of that terrible night. He had been greatly frightened also\r\nby the old man\xe2\x80\x99s death; but he said nothing about the vision of the\r\nwoman in white. As soon as he got well again, he returned to his\r\ncalling,\xe2\x80\x94going alone every morning to the forest, and coming back at\r\nnightfall with his bundles of wood, which his mother helped him to\r\nsell.\r\n\r\nOne evening, in the winter of the following year, as he was on his way\r\nhome, he overtook a girl who happened to be traveling by the same road.\r\nShe was a tall, slim girl, very good-looking; and she answered\r\nMinokichi\xe2\x80\x99s greeting in a voice as pleasant to the ear as the voice of\r\na song-bird. Then he walked beside her; and they began to talk. The\r\ngirl said that her name was O-Yuki;[2] that she had lately lost both of\r\nher parents; and that she was going to Yedo (2), where she happened to\r\nhave some poor relations, who might help her to find a situation as a\r\nservant. Minokichi soon felt charmed by this strange girl; and the more\r\nthat he looked at her, the handsomer she appeared to be. He asked her\r\nwhether she was yet betrothed; and she answered, laughingly, that she\r\nwas free. Then, in her turn, she asked Minokichi whether he was\r\nmarried, or pledged to marry; and he told her that, although he had\r\nonly a widowed mother to support, the question of an \xe2\x80\x9chonorable\r\ndaughter-in-law\xe2\x80\x9d had not yet been considered, as he was very young...\r\nAfter these confidences, they walked on for a long while without\r\nspeaking; but, as the proverb declares, _Ki ga ar\xc3\xa9ba, m\xc3\xa9 mo kuchi hodo\r\nni mono wo iu:_ \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the wish is there, the eyes can say as much as\r\nthe mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d By the time they reached the village, they had become very\r\nmuch pleased with each other; and then Minokichi asked O-Yuki to rest\r\nawhile at his house. After some shy hesitation, she went there with\r\nhim; and his mother made her welcome, and prepared a warm meal for her.\r\nO-Yuki behaved so nicely that Minokichi\xe2\x80\x99s mother took a sudden fancy to\r\nher, and persuaded her to delay her journey to Yedo. And the natural\r\nend of the matter was that Yuki never went to Yedo at all. She remained\r\nin the house, as an \xe2\x80\x9chonorable daughter-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO-Yuki proved a very good daughter-in-law. When Minokichi\xe2\x80\x99s mother came\r\nto die,\xe2\x80\x94some five years later,\xe2\x80\x94her last words were words of affection\r\nand praise for the wife of her son. And O-Yuki bore Minokichi ten\r\nchildren, boys and girls,\xe2\x80\x94handsome children all of them, and very fair\r\nof skin.\r\n\r\nThe country-folk thought O-Yuki a wonderful person, by nature different\r\nfrom themselves. Most of the peasant-women age early; but O-Yuki, even\r\nafter having become the mother of ten children, looked as young and\r\nfresh as on the day when she had first come to the village.\r\n\r\nOne night, after the children had gone to sleep, O-Yuki was sewing by\r\nthe light of a paper lamp; and Minokichi, watching her, said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo see you sewing there, with the light on your face, makes me think\r\nof a strange thing that happened when I was a lad of eighteen. I then\r\nsaw somebody as beautiful and white as you are now\xe2\x80\x94indeed, she was very\r\nlike you.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nWithout lifting her eyes from her work, O-Yuki responded:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me about her... Where did you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Minokichi told her about the terrible night in the ferryman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhut,\xe2\x80\x94and about the White Woman that had stooped above him, smiling and\r\nwhispering,\xe2\x80\x94and about the silent death of old Mosaku. And he said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsleep or awake, that was the only time that I saw a being as\r\nbeautiful as you. Of course, she was not a human being; and I was\r\nafraid of her,\xe2\x80\x94very much afraid,\xe2\x80\x94but she was so white!... Indeed, I\r\nhave never been sure whether it was a dream that I saw, or the Woman of\r\nthe Snow.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nO-Yuki flung down her sewing, and arose, and bowed above Minokichi\r\nwhere he sat, and shrieked into his face:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was I\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94I! Yuki it was! And I told you then that I would kill you\r\nif you ever said one word about it!... But for those children asleep\r\nthere, I would kill you this moment! And now you had better take very,\r\nvery good care of them; for if ever they have reason to complain of\r\nyou, I will treat you as you deserve!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nEven as she screamed, her voice became thin, like a crying of\r\nwind;\xe2\x80\x94then she melted into a bright white mist that spired to the\r\nroof-beams, and shuddered away through the smoke-hole.... Never again\r\nwas she seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF AOYAGI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the era of Bummei [1469-1486] there was a young samurai called\r\nTomotada in the service of Hatak\xc3\xa9yama Yoshimun\xc3\xa9, the Lord of Noto (1).\r\nTomotada was a native of Echizen (2); but at an early age he had been\r\ntaken, as page, into the palace of the daimy\xc5\x8d of Noto, and had been\r\neducated, under the supervision of that prince, for the profession of\r\narms. As he grew up, he proved himself both a good scholar and a good\r\nsoldier, and continued to enjoy the favor of his prince. Being gifted\r\nwith an amiable character, a winning address, and a very handsome\r\nperson, he was admired and much liked by his samurai-comrades.\r\n\r\nWhen Tomotada was about twenty years old, he was sent upon a private\r\nmission to Hosokawa Masamoto, the great daimy\xc5\x8d of Ky\xc5\x8dto, a kinsman of\r\nHatak\xc3\xa9yama Yoshimun\xc3\xa9. Having been ordered to journey through Echizen,\r\nthe youth requested and obtained permission to pay a visit, on the way,\r\nto his widowed mother.\r\n\r\nIt was the coldest period of the year when he started; and, though\r\nmounted upon a powerful horse, he found himself obliged to proceed\r\nslowly. The road which he followed passed through a mountain-district\r\nwhere the settlements were few and far between; and on the second day\r\nof his journey, after a weary ride of hours, he was dismayed to find\r\nthat he could not reach his intended halting-place until late in the\r\nnight. He had reason to be anxious;\xe2\x80\x94for a heavy snowstorm came on, with\r\nan intensely cold wind; and the horse showed signs of exhaustion. But\r\nin that trying moment, Tomotada unexpectedly perceived the thatched\r\nroom of a cottage on the summit of a near hill, where willow-trees were\r\ngrowing. With difficulty he urged his tired animal to the dwelling; and\r\nhe loudly knocked upon the storm-doors, which had been closed against\r\nthe wind. An old woman opened them, and cried out compassionately at\r\nthe sight of the handsome stranger: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, how pitiful!\xe2\x80\x94a young gentleman\r\ntraveling alone in such weather!... Deign, young master, to enter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTomotada dismounted, and after leading his horse to a shed in the rear,\r\nentered the cottage, where he saw an old man and a girl warming\r\nthemselves by a fire of bamboo splints. They respectfully invited him\r\nto approach the fire; and the old folks then proceeded to warm some\r\nrice-wine, and to prepare food for the traveler, whom they ventured to\r\nquestion in regard to his journey. Meanwhile the young girl disappeared\r\nbehind a screen. Tomotada had observed, with astonishment, that she was\r\nextremely beautiful,\xe2\x80\x94though her attire was of the most wretched kind,\r\nand her long, loose hair in disorder. He wondered that so handsome a\r\ngirl should be living in such a miserable and lonesome place.\r\n\r\nThe old man said to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonored Sir, the next village is far; and the snow is falling thickly.\r\nThe wind is piercing; and the road is very bad. Therefore, to proceed\r\nfurther this night would probably be dangerous. Although this hovel is\r\nunworthy of your presence, and although we have not any comfort to\r\noffer, perhaps it were safer to remain to-night under this miserable\r\nroof... We would take good care of your horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTomotada accepted this humble proposal,\xe2\x80\x94secretly glad of the chance\r\nthus afforded him to see more of the young girl. Presently a coarse but\r\nample meal was set before him; and the girl came from behind the\r\nscreen, to serve the wine. She was now reclad, in a rough but cleanly\r\nrobe of homespun; and her long, loose hair had been neatly combed and\r\nsmoothed. As she bent forward to fill his cup, Tomotada was amazed to\r\nperceive that she was incomparably more beautiful than any woman whom\r\nhe had ever before seen; and there was a grace about her every motion\r\nthat astonished him. But the elders began to apologize for her, saying:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, our daughter, Aoyagi,[1] has been brought up here in the\r\nmountains, almost alone; and she knows nothing of gentle service. We\r\npray that you will pardon her stupidity and her ignorance.\xe2\x80\x9d Tomotada\r\nprotested that he deemed himself lucky to be waited upon by so comely a\r\nmaiden. He could not turn his eyes away from her\xe2\x80\x94though he saw that his\r\nadmiring gaze made her blush;\xe2\x80\x94and he left the wine and food untasted\r\nbefore him. The mother said: \xe2\x80\x9cKind Sir, we very much hope that you will\r\ntry to eat and to drink a little,\xe2\x80\x94though our peasant-fare is of the\r\nworst,\xe2\x80\x94as you must have been chilled by that piercing wind.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, to\r\nplease the old folks, Tomotada ate and drank as he could; but the charm\r\nof the blushing girl still grew upon him. He talked with her, and found\r\nthat her speech was sweet as her face. Brought up in the mountains as\r\nshe might have been;\xe2\x80\x94but, in that case, her parents must at some time\r\nbeen persons of high degree; for she spoke and moved like a damsel of\r\nrank. Suddenly he addressed her with a poem\xe2\x80\x94which was also a\r\nquestion\xe2\x80\x94inspired by the delight in his heart:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cTadzun\xc3\xa9tsuru,\r\nHana ka tot\xc3\xa9 koso,\r\n    Hi wo kuras\xc3\xa9,\r\nAk\xc3\xa9nu ni otoru\r\nAkan\xc3\xa9 sasuran?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9c_Being on my way to pay a visit, I found that which I took to be a\r\nflower: therefore here I spend the day... Why, in the time before dawn,\r\nthe dawn-blush tint should glow\xe2\x80\x94that, indeed, I know not._\xe2\x80\x9d][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, she answered him in these verses:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIzuru hi no\r\nHonom\xc3\xa9ku iro wo\r\n    Waga sod\xc3\xa9 ni\r\nTsutsumaba asu mo\r\nKimiya tomaran.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9c_If with my sleeve I hid the faint fair color of the dawning\r\nsun,\xe2\x80\x94then, perhaps, in the morning my lord will remain._\xe2\x80\x9d][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Tomotada knew that she accepted his admiration; and he was\r\nscarcely less surprised by the art with which she had uttered her\r\nfeelings in verse, than delighted by the assurance which the verses\r\nconveyed. He was now certain that in all this world he could not hope\r\nto meet, much less to win, a girl more beautiful and witty than this\r\nrustic maid before him; and a voice in his heart seemed to cry out\r\nurgently, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the luck that the gods have put in your way!\xe2\x80\x9d In short\r\nhe was bewitched\xe2\x80\x94bewitched to such a degree that, without further\r\npreliminary, he asked the old people to give him their daughter in\r\nmarriage,\xe2\x80\x94telling them, at the same time, his name and lineage, and his\r\nrank in the train of the Lord of Noto.\r\n\r\nThey bowed down before him, with many exclamations of grateful\r\nastonishment. But, after some moments of apparent hesitation, the\r\nfather replied:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonored master, you are a person of high position, and likely to rise\r\nto still higher things. Too great is the favor that you deign to offer\r\nus;\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the depth of our gratitude therefor is not to be spoken or\r\nmeasured. But this girl of ours, being a stupid country-girl of vulgar\r\nbirth, with no training or teaching of any sort, it would be improper\r\nto let her become the wife of a noble samurai. Even to speak of such a\r\nmatter is not right... But, since you find the girl to your liking, and\r\nhave condescended to pardon her peasant-manners and to overlook her\r\ngreat rudeness, we do gladly present her to you, for an humble\r\nhandmaid. Deign, therefore, to act hereafter in her regard according to\r\nyour august pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEre morning the storm had passed; and day broke through a cloudless\r\neast. Even if the sleeve of Aoyagi hid from her lover\xe2\x80\x99s eyes the\r\nrose-blush of that dawn, he could no longer tarry. But neither could he\r\nresign himself to part with the girl; and, when everything had been\r\nprepared for his journey, he thus addressed her parents:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough it may seem thankless to ask for more than I have already\r\nreceived, I must again beg you to give me your daughter for wife. It\r\nwould be difficult for me to separate from her now; and as she is\r\nwilling to accompany me, if you permit, I can take her with me as she\r\nis. If you will give her to me, I shall ever cherish you as parents...\r\nAnd, in the meantime, please to accept this poor acknowledgment of your\r\nkindest hospitality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he placed before his humble host a purse of gold _ry\xc5\x8d_. But\r\nthe old man, after many prostrations, gently pushed back the gift, and\r\nsaid:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKind master, the gold would be of no use to us; and you will probably\r\nhave need of it during your long, cold journey. Here we buy nothing;\r\nand we could not spend so much money upon ourselves, even if we\r\nwished... As for the girl, we have already bestowed her as a free\r\ngift;\xe2\x80\x94she belongs to you: therefore it is not necessary to ask our\r\nleave to take her away. Already she has told us that she hopes to\r\naccompany you, and to remain your servant for as long as you may be\r\nwilling to endure her presence. We are only too happy to know that you\r\ndeign to accept her; and we pray that you will not trouble yourself on\r\nour account. In this place we could not provide her with proper\r\nclothing,\xe2\x80\x94much less with a dowry. Moreover, being old, we should in any\r\nevent have to separate from her before long. Therefore it is very\r\nfortunate that you should be willing to take her with you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that Tomotada tried to persuade the old people to accept\r\na present: he found that they cared nothing for money. But he saw that\r\nthey were really anxious to trust their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s fate to his hands;\r\nand he therefore decided to take her with him. So he placed her upon\r\nhis horse, and bade the old folks farewell for the time being, with\r\nmany sincere expressions of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonored Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the father made answer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is we, and not you, who have\r\nreason for gratitude. We are sure that you will be kind to our girl;\r\nand we have no fears for her sake.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n[_Here, in the Japanese original, there is a queer break in the natural\r\ncourse of the narration, which therefrom remains curiously\r\ninconsistent. Nothing further is said about the mother of Tomotada, or\r\nabout the parents of Aoyagi, or about the daimy\xc5\x8d of Noto. Evidently the\r\nwriter wearied of his work at this point, and hurried the story, very\r\ncarelessly, to its startling end. I am not able to supply his\r\nomissions, or to repair his faults of construction; but I must venture\r\nto put in a few explanatory details, without which the rest of the tale\r\nwould not hold together... It appears that Tomotada rashly took Aoyagi\r\nwith him to Ky\xc5\x8dto, and so got into trouble; but we are not informed as\r\nto where the couple lived afterwards._]\r\n\r\n...Now a samurai was not allowed to marry without the consent of his\r\nlord; and Tomotada could not expect to obtain this sanction before his\r\nmission had been accomplished. He had reason, under such circumstances,\r\nto fear that the beauty of Aoyagi might attract dangerous attention,\r\nand that means might be devised of taking her away from him. In Ky\xc5\x8dto\r\nhe therefore tried to keep her hidden from curious eyes. But a retainer\r\nof Lord Hosokawa one day caught sight of Aoyagi, discovered her\r\nrelation to Tomotada, and reported the matter to the daimy\xc5\x8d. Thereupon\r\nthe daimy\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x94a young prince, and fond of pretty faces\xe2\x80\x94gave orders that\r\nthe girl should be brought to the place; and she was taken thither at\r\nonce, without ceremony.\r\n\r\nTomotada sorrowed unspeakably; but he knew himself powerless. He was\r\nonly an humble messenger in the service of a far-off daimy\xc5\x8d; and for\r\nthe time being he was at the mercy of a much more powerful daimy\xc5\x8d,\r\nwhose wishes were not to be questioned. Moreover Tomotada knew that he\r\nhad acted foolishly,\xe2\x80\x94that he had brought about his own misfortune, by\r\nentering into a clandestine relation which the code of the military\r\nclass condemned. There was now but one hope for him,\xe2\x80\x94a desperate hope:\r\nthat Aoyagi might be able and willing to escape and to flee with him.\r\nAfter long reflection, he resolved to try to send her a letter. The\r\nattempt would be dangerous, of course: any writing sent to her might\r\nfind its way to the hands of the daimy\xc5\x8d; and to send a love-letter to\r\nany inmate of the place was an unpardonable offense. But he resolved to\r\ndare the risk; and, in the form of a Chinese poem, he composed a letter\r\nwhich he endeavored to have conveyed to her. The poem was written with\r\nonly twenty-eight characters. But with those twenty-eight characters he\r\nwas about to express all the depth of his passion, and to suggest all\r\nthe pain of his loss:\xe2\x80\x94[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nK\xc5\x8dshi \xc5\x8d-son gojin wo ou;\r\nRyokuju namida wo tar\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 rakin wo hitataru;\r\nKomon hitotabi irit\xc3\xa9 fukaki koto umi no gotoshi;\r\nKor\xc3\xa9 yori shor\xc5\x8d kor\xc3\xa9 rojin\r\n\r\n[_Closely, closely the youthful prince now follows after the gem-bright\r\nmaid;\xe2\x80\x94\r\nThe tears of the fair one, falling, have moistened all her robes.\r\nBut the august lord, having once become enamored of her\xe2\x80\x94the depth of\r\nhis longing is like the depth of the sea.\r\nTherefore it is only I that am left forlorn,\xe2\x80\x94only I that am left to\r\nwander along._]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day after this poem had been sent, Tomotada was\r\nsummoned to appear before the Lord Hosokawa. The youth at once\r\nsuspected that his confidence had been betrayed; and he could not hope,\r\nif his letter had been seen by the daimy\xc5\x8d, to escape the severest\r\npenalty. \xe2\x80\x9cNow he will order my death,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Tomotada;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not\r\ncare to live unless Aoyagi be restored to me. Besides, if the\r\ndeath-sentence be passed, I can at least try to kill Hosokawa.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nslipped his swords into his girdle, and hastened to the palace.\r\n\r\nOn entering the presence-room he saw the Lord Hosokawa seated upon the\r\ndais, surrounded by samurai of high rank, in caps and robes of\r\nceremony. All were silent as statues; and while Tomotada advanced to\r\nmake obeisance, the hush seemed to him sinister and heavy, like the\r\nstillness before a storm. But Hosokawa suddenly descended from the\r\ndais, and, while taking the youth by the arm, began to repeat the words\r\nof the poem:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_K\xc5\x8dshi \xc5\x8d-son gojin wo ou_.\xe2\x80\x9d... And Tomotada, looking up,\r\nsaw kindly tears in the prince\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nThen said Hosokawa:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you love each other so much, I have taken it upon myself to\r\nauthorize your marriage, in lieu of my kinsman, the Lord of Noto; and\r\nyour wedding shall now be celebrated before me. The guests are\r\nassembled;\xe2\x80\x94the gifts are ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a signal from the lord, the sliding-screens concealing a further\r\napartment were pushed open; and Tomotada saw there many dignitaries of\r\nthe court, assembled for the ceremony, and Aoyagi awaiting him in\r\nbrides\xe2\x80\x99 apparel... Thus was she given back to him;\xe2\x80\x94and the wedding was\r\njoyous and splendid;\xe2\x80\x94and precious gifts were made to the young couple\r\nby the prince, and by the members of his household.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor five happy years, after that wedding, Tomotada and Aoyagi dwelt\r\ntogether. But one morning Aoyagi, while talking with her husband about\r\nsome household matter, suddenly uttered a great cry of pain, and then\r\nbecame very white and still. After a few moments she said, in a feeble\r\nvoice: \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for thus rudely crying out\xe2\x80\x94but the pain was so\r\nsudden!... My dear husband, our union must have been brought about\r\nthrough some Karma-relation in a former state of existence; and that\r\nhappy relation, I think, will bring us again together in more than one\r\nlife to come. But for this present existence of ours, the relation is\r\nnow ended;\xe2\x80\x94we are about to be separated. Repeat for me, I beseech you,\r\nthe _Nembutsu_-prayer,\xe2\x80\x94because I am dying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what strange wild fancies!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the startled husband,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nonly a little unwell, my dear one!... lie down for a while, and rest;\r\nand the sickness will pass.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d she responded\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am dying!\xe2\x80\x94I do not imagine it;\xe2\x80\x94I know!...\r\nAnd it were needless now, my dear husband, to hide the truth from you\r\nany longer:\xe2\x80\x94I am not a human being. The soul of a tree is my soul;\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nheart of a tree is my heart;\xe2\x80\x94the sap of the willow is my life. And some\r\none, at this cruel moment, is cutting down my tree;\xe2\x80\x94that is why I must\r\ndie!... Even to weep were now beyond my strength!\xe2\x80\x94quickly, quickly\r\nrepeat the _Nembutsu_ for me... quickly!... Ah!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith another cry of pain she turned aside her beautiful head, and tried\r\nto hide her face behind her sleeve. But almost in the same moment her\r\nwhole form appeared to collapse in the strangest way, and to sink down,\r\ndown, down\xe2\x80\x94level with the floor. Tomotada had sprung to support\r\nher;\xe2\x80\x94but there was nothing to support! There lay on the matting only\r\nthe empty robes of the fair creature and the ornaments that she had\r\nworn in her hair: the body had ceased to exist...\r\n\r\nTomotada shaved his head, took the Buddhist vows, and became an\r\nitinerant priest. He traveled through all the provinces of the empire;\r\nand, at holy places which he visited, he offered up prayers for the\r\nsoul of Aoyagi. Reaching Echizen, in the course of his pilgrimage, he\r\nsought the home of the parents of his beloved. But when he arrived at\r\nthe lonely place among the hills, where their dwelling had been, he\r\nfound that the cottage had disappeared. There was nothing to mark even\r\nthe spot where it had stood, except the stumps of three willows\xe2\x80\x94two old\r\ntrees and one young tree\xe2\x80\x94that had been cut down long before his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nBeside the stumps of those willow-trees he erected a memorial tomb,\r\ninscribed with divers holy texts; and he there performed many Buddhist\r\nservices on behalf of the spirits of Aoyagi and of her parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJIU-ROKU-ZAKURA\r\n\r\n\r\nUso no yona,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nJiu-roku-zakura\r\nSaki ni keri!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Wak\xc3\xa9g\xc5\x8dri, a district of the province of Iyo (1), there is a very\r\nancient and famous cherry-tree, called _Jiu-roku-zakura_, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nCherry-tree of the Sixteenth Day,\xe2\x80\x9d because it blooms every year upon\r\nthe sixteenth day of the first month (by the old lunar calendar),\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nonly upon that day. Thus the time of its flowering is the Period of\r\nGreat Cold,\xe2\x80\x94though the natural habit of a cherry-tree is to wait for\r\nthe spring season before venturing to blossom. But the\r\n_Jiu-roku-zakura_ blossoms with a life that is not\xe2\x80\x94or, at least, that\r\nwas not originally\xe2\x80\x94its own. There is the ghost of a man in that tree.\r\n\r\nHe was a samurai of Iyo; and the tree grew in his garden; and it used\r\nto flower at the usual time,\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, about the end of March or\r\nthe beginning of April. He had played under that tree when he was a\r\nchild; and his parents and grandparents and ancestors had hung to its\r\nblossoming branches, season after season for more than a hundred years,\r\nbright strips of colored paper inscribed with poems of praise. He\r\nhimself became very old,\xe2\x80\x94outliving all his children; and there was\r\nnothing in the world left for him to love except that tree. And lo! in\r\nthe summer of a certain year, the tree withered and died!\r\n\r\nExceedingly the old man sorrowed for his tree. Then kind neighbors\r\nfound for him a young and beautiful cherry-tree, and planted it in his\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x94hoping thus to comfort him. And he thanked them, and pretended\r\nto be glad. But really his heart was full of pain; for he had loved the\r\nold tree so well that nothing could have consoled him for the loss of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt last there came to him a happy thought: he remembered a way by which\r\nthe perishing tree might be saved. (It was the sixteenth day of the\r\nfirst month.) Along he went into his garden, and bowed down before the\r\nwithered tree, and spoke to it, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cNow deign, I beseech you, once\r\nmore to bloom,\xe2\x80\x94because I am going to die in your stead.\xe2\x80\x9d (For it is\r\nbelieved that one can really give away one\xe2\x80\x99s life to another person, or\r\nto a creature or even to a tree, by the favor of the gods;\xe2\x80\x94and thus to\r\ntransfer one\xe2\x80\x99s life is expressed by the term _migawari ni tatsu_, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nact as a substitute.\xe2\x80\x9d) Then under that tree he spread a white cloth,\r\nand divers coverings, and sat down upon the coverings, and performed\r\n_hara-kiri_ after the fashion of a samurai. And the ghost of him went\r\ninto the tree, and made it blossom in that same hour.\r\n\r\nAnd every year it still blooms on the sixteenth day of the first month,\r\nin the season of snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM OF AKINOSUK\xc3\x89\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the district called To\xc3\xafchi of Yamato Province, (1) there used to\r\nlive a g\xc5\x8dshi named Miyata Akinosuk\xc3\xa9... [Here I must tell you that in\r\nJapanese feudal times there was a privileged class of\r\nsoldier-farmers,\xe2\x80\x94free-holders,\xe2\x80\x94corresponding to the class of yeomen in\r\nEngland; and these were called g\xc5\x8dshi.]\r\n\r\nIn Akinosuk\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s garden there was a great and ancient cedar-tree, under\r\nwhich he was wont to rest on sultry days. One very warm afternoon he\r\nwas sitting under this tree with two of his friends, fellow-g\xc5\x8dshi,\r\nchatting and drinking wine, when he felt all of a sudden very\r\ndrowsy,\xe2\x80\x94so drowsy that he begged his friends to excuse him for taking a\r\nnap in their presence. Then he lay down at the foot of the tree, and\r\ndreamed this dream:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHe thought that as he was lying there in his garden, he saw a\r\nprocession, like the train of some great daimy\xc5\x8d descending a hill near\r\nby, and that he got up to look at it. A very grand procession it proved\r\nto be,\xe2\x80\x94more imposing than anything of the kind which he had ever seen\r\nbefore; and it was advancing toward his dwelling. He observed in the\r\nvan of it a number of young men richly appareled, who were drawing a\r\ngreat lacquered palace-carriage, or _gosho-guruma_, hung with bright\r\nblue silk. When the procession arrived within a short distance of the\r\nhouse it halted; and a richly dressed man\xe2\x80\x94evidently a person of\r\nrank\xe2\x80\x94advanced from it, approached Akinosuk\xc3\xa9, bowed to him profoundly,\r\nand then said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonored Sir, you see before you a _k\xc3\xa9rai_ [vassal] of the Koku\xc5\x8d of\r\nTokoyo.[1] My master, the King, commands me to greet you in his august\r\nname, and to place myself wholly at your disposal. He also bids me\r\ninform you that he augustly desires your presence at the palace. Be\r\ntherefore pleased immediately to enter this honorable carriage, which\r\nhe has sent for your conveyance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon hearing these words Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 wanted to make some fitting reply;\r\nbut he was too much astonished and embarrassed for speech;\xe2\x80\x94and in the\r\nsame moment his will seemed to melt away from him, so that he could\r\nonly do as the _k\xc3\xa9rai_ bade him. He entered the carriage; the _k\xc3\xa9rai_\r\ntook a place beside him, and made a signal; the drawers, seizing the\r\nsilken ropes, turned the great vehicle southward;\xe2\x80\x94and the journey\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time, to Akinosuk\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s amazement, the carriage stopped in\r\nfront of a huge two-storied gateway (_r\xc5\x8dmon_), of a Chinese style,\r\nwhich he had never before seen. Here the _k\xc3\xa9rai_ dismounted, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ngo to announce the honorable arrival,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he disappeared. After some\r\nlittle waiting, Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 saw two noble-looking men, wearing robes of\r\npurple silk and high caps of the form indicating lofty rank, come from\r\nthe gateway. These, after having respectfully saluted him, helped him\r\nto descend from the carriage, and led him through the great gate and\r\nacross a vast garden, to the entrance of a palace whose front appeared\r\nto extend, west and east, to a distance of miles. Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 was then\r\nshown into a reception-room of wonderful size and splendor. His guides\r\nconducted him to the place of honor, and respectfully seated themselves\r\napart; while serving-maids, in costume of ceremony, brought\r\nrefreshments. When Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 had partaken of the refreshments, the two\r\npurple-robed attendants bowed low before him, and addressed him in the\r\nfollowing words,\xe2\x80\x94each speaking alternately, according to the etiquette\r\nof courts:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is now our honorable duty to inform you... as to the reason of your\r\nhaving been summoned hither... Our master, the King, augustly desires\r\nthat you become his son-in-law;... and it is his wish and command that\r\nyou shall wed this very day... the August Princess, his\r\nmaiden-daughter... We shall soon conduct you to the presence-chamber...\r\nwhere His Augustness even now is waiting to receive you... But it will\r\nbe necessary that we first invest you... with the appropriate garments\r\nof ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d[2]\r\n\r\nHaving thus spoken, the attendants rose together, and proceeded to an\r\nalcove containing a great chest of gold lacquer. They opened the chest,\r\nand took from it various robes and girdles of rich material, and a\r\n_kamuri_, or regal headdress. With these they attired Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 as\r\nbefitted a princely bridegroom; and he was then conducted to the\r\npresence-room, where he saw the Koku\xc5\x8d of Tokoyo seated upon the\r\n_daiza_,[3] wearing a high black cap of state, and robed in robes of\r\nyellow silk. Before the _daiza_, to left and right, a multitude of\r\ndignitaries sat in rank, motionless and splendid as images in a temple;\r\nand Akinosuk\xc3\xa9, advancing into their midst, saluted the king with the\r\ntriple prostration of usage. The king greeted him with gracious words,\r\nand then said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have already been informed as to the reason of your having been\r\nsummoned to Our presence. We have decided that you shall become the\r\nadopted husband of Our only daughter;\xe2\x80\x94and the wedding ceremony shall\r\nnow be performed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the king finished speaking, a sound of joyful music was heard; and a\r\nlong train of beautiful court ladies advanced from behind a curtain to\r\nconduct Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 to the room in which his bride awaited him.\r\n\r\nThe room was immense; but it could scarcely contain the multitude of\r\nguests assembled to witness the wedding ceremony. All bowed down before\r\nAkinosuk\xc3\xa9 as he took his place, facing the King\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, on the\r\nkneeling-cushion prepared for him. As a maiden of heaven the bride\r\nappeared to be; and her robes were beautiful as a summer sky. And the\r\nmarriage was performed amid great rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the pair were conducted to a suite of apartments that had\r\nbeen prepared for them in another portion of the palace; and there they\r\nreceived the congratulations of many noble persons, and wedding gifts\r\nbeyond counting.\r\n\r\nSome days later Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 was again summoned to the throne-room. On\r\nthis occasion he was received even more graciously than before; and the\r\nKing said to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the southwestern part of Our dominion there is an island called\r\nRaish\xc5\xab. We have now appointed you Governor of that island. You will\r\nfind the people loyal and docile; but their laws have not yet been\r\nbrought into proper accord with the laws of Tokoyo; and their customs\r\nhave not been properly regulated. We entrust you with the duty of\r\nimproving their social condition as far as may be possible; and We\r\ndesire that you shall rule them with kindness and wisdom. All\r\npreparations necessary for your journey to Raish\xc5\xab have already been\r\nmade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 and his bride departed from the palace of Tokoyo,\r\naccompanied to the shore by a great escort of nobles and officials; and\r\nthey embarked upon a ship of state provided by the king. And with\r\nfavoring winds they safety sailed to Raish\xc5\xab, and found the good people\r\nof that island assembled upon the beach to welcome them.\r\n\r\nAkinosuk\xc3\xa9 entered at once upon his new duties; and they did not prove\r\nto be hard. During the first three years of his governorship he was\r\noccupied chiefly with the framing and the enactment of laws; but he had\r\nwise counselors to help him, and he never found the work unpleasant.\r\nWhen it was all finished, he had no active duties to perform, beyond\r\nattending the rites and ceremonies ordained by ancient custom. The\r\ncountry was so healthy and so fertile that sickness and want were\r\nunknown; and the people were so good that no laws were ever broken. And\r\nAkinosuk\xc3\xa9 dwelt and ruled in Raish\xc5\xab for twenty years more,\xe2\x80\x94making in\r\nall twenty-three years of sojourn, during which no shadow of sorrow\r\ntraversed his life.\r\n\r\nBut in the twenty-fourth year of his governorship, a great misfortune\r\ncame upon him; for his wife, who had borne him seven children,\xe2\x80\x94five\r\nboys and two girls,\xe2\x80\x94fell sick and died. She was buried, with high pomp,\r\non the summit of a beautiful hill in the district of Hanry\xc5\x8dk\xc5\x8d; and a\r\nmonument, exceedingly splendid, was placed upon her grave. But\r\nAkinosuk\xc3\xa9 felt such grief at her death that he no longer cared to live.\r\n\r\nNow when the legal period of mourning was over, there came to Raish\xc5\xab,\r\nfrom the Tokoyo palace, a _shisha_, or royal messenger. The _shisha_\r\ndelivered to Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 a message of condolence, and then said to him:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are the words which our august master, the King of Tokoyo,\r\ncommands that I repeat to you: \xe2\x80\x98We will now send you back to your own\r\npeople and country. As for the seven children, they are the grandsons\r\nand granddaughters of the King, and shall be fitly cared for. Do not,\r\ntherefore, allow your mind to be troubled concerning them.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn receiving this mandate, Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 submissively prepared for his\r\ndeparture. When all his affairs had been settled, and the ceremony of\r\nbidding farewell to his counselors and trusted officials had been\r\nconcluded, he was escorted with much honor to the port. There he\r\nembarked upon the ship sent for him; and the ship sailed out into the\r\nblue sea, under the blue sky; and the shape of the island of Raish\xc5\xab\r\nitself turned blue, and then turned grey, and then vanished forever...\r\nAnd Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 suddenly awoke\xe2\x80\x94under the cedar-tree in his own garden!\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was stupefied and dazed. But he perceived his two\r\nfriends still seated near him,\xe2\x80\x94drinking and chatting merrily. He stared\r\nat them in a bewildered way, and cried aloud,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkinosuk\xc3\xa9 must have been dreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d one of them exclaimed, with a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you see, Akinosuk\xc3\xa9, that was strange?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Akinosuk\xc3\xa9 told his dream,\xe2\x80\x94that dream of three-and-twenty years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsojourn in the realm of Tokoyo, in the island of Raish\xc5\xab;\xe2\x80\x94and they were\r\nastonished, because he had really slept for no more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nOne g\xc5\x8dshi said:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, you saw strange things. We also saw something strange while\r\nyou were napping. A little yellow butterfly was fluttering over your\r\nface for a moment or two; and we watched it. Then it alighted on the\r\nground beside you, close to the tree; and almost as soon as it alighted\r\nthere, a big, big ant came out of a hole and seized it and pulled it\r\ndown into the hole. Just before you woke up, we saw that very butterfly\r\ncome out of the hole again, and flutter over your face as before. And\r\nthen it suddenly disappeared: we do not know where it went.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it was Akinosuk\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s soul,\xe2\x80\x9d the other g\xc5\x8dshi said;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccertainly I\r\nthought I saw it fly into his mouth... But, even if that butterfly\r\n_was_ Akinosuk\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s soul, the fact would not explain his dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ants might explain it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the first speaker. \xe2\x80\x9cAnts are\r\nqueer beings\xe2\x80\x94possibly goblins... Anyhow, there is a big ant\xe2\x80\x99s nest\r\nunder that cedar-tree.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us look!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Akinosuk\xc3\xa9, greatly moved by this suggestion. And\r\nhe went for a spade.\r\n\r\nThe ground about and beneath the cedar-tree proved to have been\r\nexcavated, in a most surprising way, by a prodigious colony of ants.\r\nThe ants had furthermore built inside their excavations; and their tiny\r\nconstructions of straw, clay, and stems bore an odd resemblance to\r\nminiature towns. In the middle of a structure considerably larger than\r\nthe rest there was a marvelous swarming of small ants around the body\r\nof one very big ant, which had yellowish wings and a long black head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there is the King of my dream!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Akinosuk\xc3\xa9; \xe2\x80\x9cand there is\r\nthe palace of Tokoyo!... How extraordinary!... Raish\xc5\xab ought to lie\r\nsomewhere southwest of it\xe2\x80\x94to the left of that big root... Yes!\xe2\x80\x94here it\r\nis!... How very strange! Now I am sure that I can find the mountain of\r\nHanry\xc5\x8dk\xc5\x8d, and the grave of the princess.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nIn the wreck of the nest he searched and searched, and at last\r\ndiscovered a tiny mound, on the top of which was fixed a water-worn\r\npebble, in shape resembling a Buddhist monument. Underneath it he\r\nfound\xe2\x80\x94embedded in clay\xe2\x80\x94the dead body of a female ant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIKI-BAKA\r\n\r\n\r\nHis name was Riki, signifying Strength; but the people called him\r\nRiki-the-Simple, or Riki-the-Fool,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cRiki-Baka,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because he had been\r\nborn into perpetual childhood. For the same reason they were kind to\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x94even when he set a house on fire by putting a lighted match to a\r\nmosquito-curtain, and clapped his hands for joy to see the blaze. At\r\nsixteen years he was a tall, strong lad; but in mind he remained always\r\nat the happy age of two, and therefore continued to play with very\r\nsmall children. The bigger children of the neighborhood, from four to\r\nseven years old, did not care to play with him, because he could not\r\nlearn their songs and games. His favorite toy was a broomstick, which\r\nhe used as a hobby-horse; and for hours at a time he would ride on that\r\nbroomstick, up and down the slope in front of my house, with amazing\r\npeals of laughter. But at last he became troublesome by reason of his\r\nnoise; and I had to tell him that he must find another playground. He\r\nbowed submissively, and then went off,\xe2\x80\x94sorrowfully trailing his\r\nbroomstick behind him. Gentle at all times, and perfectly harmless if\r\nallowed no chance to play with fire, he seldom gave anybody cause for\r\ncomplaint. His relation to the life of our street was scarcely more\r\nthan that of a dog or a chicken; and when he finally disappeared, I did\r\nnot miss him. Months and months passed by before anything happened to\r\nremind me of Riki.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has become of Riki?\xe2\x80\x9d I then asked the old woodcutter who supplies\r\nour neighborhood with fuel. I remembered that Riki had often helped him\r\nto carry his bundles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRiki-Baka?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, Riki is dead\xe2\x80\x94poor fellow!...\r\nYes, he died nearly a year ago, very suddenly; the doctors said that he\r\nhad some disease of the brain. And there is a strange story now about\r\nthat poor Riki.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Riki died, his mother wrote his name, \xe2\x80\x98Riki-Baka,\xe2\x80\x99 in the palm of\r\nhis left hand,\xe2\x80\x94putting \xe2\x80\x98Riki\xe2\x80\x99 in the Chinese character, and \xe2\x80\x98Baka\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\n_kana_ (1). And she repeated many prayers for him,\xe2\x80\x94prayers that he\r\nmight be reborn into some more happy condition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, about three months ago, in the honorable residence of\r\nNanigashi-Sama (2), in Kojimachi (3), a boy was born with characters on\r\nthe palm of his left hand; and the characters were quite plain to\r\nread,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_RIKI-BAKA_\xe2\x80\x99!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo the people of that house knew that the birth must have happened in\r\nanswer to somebody\xe2\x80\x99s prayer; and they caused inquiry to be made\r\neverywhere. At last a vegetable-seller brought word to them that there\r\nused to be a simple lad, called Riki-Baka, living in the Ushigom\xc3\xa9\r\nquarter, and that he had died during the last autumn; and they sent two\r\nmen-servants to look for the mother of Riki.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose servants found the mother of Riki, and told her what had\r\nhappened; and she was glad exceedingly\xe2\x80\x94for that Nanigashi house is a\r\nvery rich and famous house. But the servants said that the family of\r\nNanigashi-Sama were very angry about the word \xe2\x80\x98Baka\xe2\x80\x99 on the child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x98And where is your Riki buried?\xe2\x80\x99 the servants asked. \xe2\x80\x98He is\r\nburied in the cemetery of Zend\xc5\x8dji,\xe2\x80\x99 she told them. \xe2\x80\x98Please to give us\r\nsome of the clay of his grave,\xe2\x80\x99 they requested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she went with them to the temple Zend\xc5\x8dji, and showed them Riki\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave; and they took some of the grave-clay away with them, wrapped up\r\nin a _furoshiki_[1]].... They gave Riki\xe2\x80\x99s mother some money,\xe2\x80\x94ten\r\nyen.\xe2\x80\x9d... (4)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did they want with that clay?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d the old man answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know that it would not do to let the\r\nchild grow up with that name on his hand. And there is no other means\r\nof removing characters that come in that way upon the body of a child:\r\n_you must rub the skin with clay taken from the grave of the body of\r\nthe former birth_.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHI-MAWARI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the wooded hill behind the house Robert and I are looking for\r\nfairy-rings. Robert is eight years old, comely, and very wise;\xe2\x80\x94I am a\r\nlittle more than seven,\xe2\x80\x94and I reverence Robert. It is a glowing\r\nglorious August day; and the warm air is filled with sharp sweet scents\r\nof resin.\r\n\r\nWe do not find any fairy-rings; but we find a great many pine-cones in\r\nthe high grass... I tell Robert the old Welsh story of the man who went\r\nto sleep, unawares, inside a fairy-ring, and so disappeared for seven\r\nyears, and would never eat or speak after his friends had delivered him\r\nfrom the enchantment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey eat nothing but the points of needles, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoblins,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert answers.\r\n\r\nThis revelation leaves me dumb with astonishment and awe... But Robert\r\nsuddenly cries out:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a Harper!\xe2\x80\x94he is coming to the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd down the hill we run to hear the harper... But what a harper! Not\r\nlike the hoary minstrels of the picture-books. A swarthy, sturdy,\r\nunkempt vagabond, with black bold eyes under scowling black brows. More\r\nlike a bricklayer than a bard,\xe2\x80\x94and his garments are corduroy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWonder if he is going to sing in Welsh?\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs Robert.\r\n\r\nI feel too much disappointed to make any remarks. The harper poses his\r\nharp\xe2\x80\x94a huge instrument\xe2\x80\x94upon our doorstep, sets all the strong ringing\r\nwith a sweep of his grimy fingers, clears his throat with a sort of\r\nangry growl, and begins,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nBelieve me, if all those endearing young charms,\r\n    Which I gaze on so fondly to-day...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accent, the attitude, the voice, all fill me with repulsion\r\nunutterable,\xe2\x80\x94shock me with a new sensation of formidable vulgarity. I\r\nwant to cry out loud, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to sing that song!\xe2\x80\x9d For I have\r\nheard it sung by the lips of the dearest and fairest being in my little\r\nworld;\xe2\x80\x94and that this rude, coarse man should dare to sing it vexes me\r\nlike a mockery,\xe2\x80\x94angers me like an insolence. But only for a moment!...\r\nWith the utterance of the syllables \xe2\x80\x9cto-day,\xe2\x80\x9d that deep, grim voice\r\nsuddenly breaks into a quivering tenderness indescribable;\xe2\x80\x94then,\r\nmarvelously changing, it mellows into tones sonorous and rich as the\r\nbass of a great organ,\xe2\x80\x94while a sensation unlike anything ever felt\r\nbefore takes me by the throat... What witchcraft has he learned? what\r\nsecret has he found\xe2\x80\x94this scowling man of the road?... Oh! is there\r\nanybody else in the whole world who can sing like that?... And the form\r\nof the singer flickers and dims;\xe2\x80\x94and the house, and the lawn, and all\r\nvisible shapes of things tremble and swim before me. Yet instinctively\r\nI fear that man;\xe2\x80\x94I almost hate him; and I feel myself flushing with\r\nanger and shame because of his power to move me thus...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe made you cry,\xe2\x80\x9d Robert compassionately observes, to my further\r\nconfusion,\xe2\x80\x94as the harper strides away, richer by a gift of sixpence\r\ntaken without thanks... \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think he must be a gipsy. Gipsies are\r\nbad people\xe2\x80\x94and they are wizards... Let us go back to the wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe climb again to the pines, and there squat down upon the sun-flecked\r\ngrass, and look over town and sea. But we do not play as before: the\r\nspell of the wizard is strong upon us both... \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is a goblin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI venture at last, \xe2\x80\x9cor a fairy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robert,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9conly a gipsy. But\r\nthat is nearly as bad. They steal children, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do if he comes up here?\xe2\x80\x9d I gasp, in sudden terror at the\r\nlonesomeness of our situation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare,\xe2\x80\x9d answers Robert\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot by daylight, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n[Only yesterday, near the village of Takata, I noticed a flower which\r\nthe Japanese call by nearly the same name as we do: _Himawari_, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nSunward-turning;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and over the space of forty years there thrilled back\r\nto me the voice of that wandering harper,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAs the Sunflower turns on her god, when he sets,\r\nThe same look that she turned when he rose.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I saw the sun-flecked shadows on that far Welsh hill; and Robert\r\nfor a moment again stood beside me, with his girl\xe2\x80\x99s face and his curls\r\nof gold. We were looking for fairy-rings... But all that existed of the\r\nreal Robert must long ago have suffered a sea-change into something\r\nrich and strange... _Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay\r\ndown his life for his friend_....]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH\xc5\x8cRAI\r\n\r\n\r\nBlue vision of depth lost in height,\xe2\x80\x94sea and sky interblending through\r\nluminous haze. The day is of spring, and the hour morning.\r\n\r\nOnly sky and sea,\xe2\x80\x94one azure enormity... In the fore, ripples are\r\ncatching a silvery light, and threads of foam are swirling. But a\r\nlittle further off no motion is visible, nor anything save color: dim\r\nwarm blue of water widening away to melt into blue of air. Horizon\r\nthere is none: only distance soaring into space,\xe2\x80\x94infinite concavity\r\nhollowing before you, and hugely arching above you,\xe2\x80\x94the color deepening\r\nwith the height. But far in the midway-blue there hangs a faint, faint\r\nvision of palace towers, with high roofs horned and curved like\r\nmoons,\xe2\x80\x94some shadowing of splendor strange and old, illumined by a\r\nsunshine soft as memory.\r\n\r\n...What I have thus been trying to describe is a kak\xc3\xa9mono,\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, a Japanese painting on silk, suspended to the wall of my\r\nalcove;\xe2\x80\x94and the name of it is SHINKIR\xc5\x8c, which signifies \xe2\x80\x9cMirage.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthe shapes of the mirage are unmistakable. Those are the glimmering\r\nportals of H\xc5\x8drai the blest; and those are the moony roofs of the Palace\r\nof the Dragon-King;\xe2\x80\x94and the fashion of them (though limned by a\r\nJapanese brush of to-day) is the fashion of things Chinese, twenty-one\r\nhundred years ago...\r\n\r\nThus much is told of the place in the Chinese books of that time:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nIn H\xc5\x8drai there is neither death nor pain; and there is no winter. The\r\nflowers in that place never fade, and the fruits never fail; and if a\r\nman taste of those fruits even but once, he can never again feel thirst\r\nor hunger. In H\xc5\x8drai grow the enchanted plants _So-rin-shi_, and\r\n_Riku-g\xc5\x8d-aoi_, and _Ban-kon-t\xc5\x8d_, which heal all manner of sickness;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthere grows also the magical grass _Y\xc5\x8d-shin-shi_, that quickens the\r\ndead; and the magical grass is watered by a fairy water of which a\r\nsingle drink confers perpetual youth. The people of H\xc5\x8drai eat their\r\nrice out of very, very small bowls; but the rice never diminishes\r\nwithin those bowls,\xe2\x80\x94however much of it be eaten,\xe2\x80\x94until the eater\r\ndesires no more. And the people of H\xc5\x8drai drink their wine out of very,\r\nvery small cups; but no man can empty one of those cups,\xe2\x80\x94however\r\nstoutly he may drink,\xe2\x80\x94until there comes upon him the pleasant\r\ndrowsiness of intoxication.\r\n\r\nAll this and more is told in the legends of the time of the Shin\r\ndynasty. But that the people who wrote down those legends ever saw\r\nH\xc5\x8drai, even in a mirage, is not believable. For really there are no\r\nenchanted fruits which leave the eater forever satisfied,\xe2\x80\x94nor any\r\nmagical grass which revives the dead,\xe2\x80\x94nor any fountain of fairy\r\nwater,\xe2\x80\x94nor any bowls which never lack rice,\xe2\x80\x94nor any cups which never\r\nlack wine. It is not true that sorrow and death never enter\r\nH\xc5\x8drai;\xe2\x80\x94neither is it true that there is not any winter. The winter in\r\nH\xc5\x8drai is cold;\xe2\x80\x94and winds then bite to the bone; and the heaping of snow\r\nis monstrous on the roofs of the Dragon-King.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are wonderful things in H\xc5\x8drai; and the most\r\nwonderful of all has not been mentioned by any Chinese writer. I mean\r\nthe atmosphere of H\xc5\x8drai. It is an atmosphere peculiar to the place;\r\nand, because of it, the sunshine in H\xc5\x8drai is _whiter_ than any other\r\nsunshine,\xe2\x80\x94a milky light that never dazzles,\xe2\x80\x94astonishingly clear, but\r\nvery soft. This atmosphere is not of our human period: it is enormously\r\nold,\xe2\x80\x94so old that I feel afraid when I try to think how old it is;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit is not a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. It is not made of air at\r\nall, but of ghost,\xe2\x80\x94the substance of quintillions of quintillions of\r\ngenerations of souls blended into one immense translucency,\xe2\x80\x94souls of\r\npeople who thought in ways never resembling our ways. Whatever mortal\r\nman inhales that atmosphere, he takes into his blood the thrilling of\r\nthese spirits; and they change the sense within him,\xe2\x80\x94reshaping his\r\nnotions of Space and Time,\xe2\x80\x94so that he can see only as they used to see,\r\nand feel only as they used to feel, and think only as they used to\r\nthink. Soft as sleep are these changes of sense; and H\xc5\x8drai, discerned\r\nacross them, might thus be described:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_\xe2\x80\x94Because in H\xc5\x8drai there is no knowledge of great evil, the hearts of\r\nthe people never grow old. And, by reason of being always young in\r\nheart, the people of H\xc5\x8drai smile from birth until death\xe2\x80\x94except when the\r\nGods send sorrow among them; and faces then are veiled until the sorrow\r\ngoes away. All folk in H\xc5\x8drai love and trust each other, as if all were\r\nmembers of a single household;\xe2\x80\x94and the speech of the women is like\r\nbirdsong, because the hearts of them are light as the souls of\r\nbirds;\xe2\x80\x94and the swaying of the sleeves of the maidens at play seems a\r\nflutter of wide, soft wings. In H\xc5\x8drai nothing is hidden but grief,\r\nbecause there is no reason for shame;\xe2\x80\x94and nothing is locked away,\r\nbecause there could not be any theft;\xe2\x80\x94and by night as well as by day\r\nall doors remain unbarred, because there is no reason for fear. And\r\nbecause the people are fairies\xe2\x80\x94though mortal\xe2\x80\x94all things in H\xc5\x8drai,\r\nexcept the Palace of the Dragon-King, are small and quaint and\r\nqueer;\xe2\x80\x94and these fairy-folk do really eat their rice out of very, very\r\nsmall bowls, and drink their wine out of very, very small cups...._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Much of this seeming would be due to the inhalation of that ghostly\r\natmosphere\xe2\x80\x94but not all. For the spell wrought by the dead is only the\r\ncharm of an Ideal, the glamour of an ancient hope;\xe2\x80\x94and something of\r\nthat hope has found fulfillment in many hearts,\xe2\x80\x94in the simple beauty of\r\nunselfish lives,\xe2\x80\x94in the sweetness of Woman...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Evil winds from the West are blowing over H\xc5\x8drai; and the magical\r\natmosphere, alas! is shrinking away before them. It lingers now in\r\npatches only, and bands,\xe2\x80\x94like those long bright bands of cloud that\r\ntrain across the landscapes of Japanese painters. Under these shreds of\r\nthe elfish vapor you still can find H\xc5\x8drai\xe2\x80\x94but not everywhere...\r\nRemember that H\xc5\x8drai is also called Shinkir\xc5\x8d, which signifies\r\nMirage,\xe2\x80\x94the Vision of the Intangible. And the Vision is fading,\xe2\x80\x94never\r\nagain to appear save in pictures and poems and dreams...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT STUDIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nWould that I could hope for the luck of that Chinese scholar known to\r\nJapanese literature as \xe2\x80\x9cR\xc5\x8dsan\xe2\x80\x9d! For he was beloved by two\r\nspirit-maidens, celestial sisters, who every ten days came to visit him\r\nand to tell him stories about butterflies. Now there are marvelous\r\nChinese stories about butterflies\xe2\x80\x94ghostly stories; and I want to know\r\nthem. But never shall I be able to read Chinese, nor even Japanese; and\r\nthe little Japanese poetry that I manage, with exceeding difficulty, to\r\ntranslate, contains so many allusions to Chinese stories of butterflies\r\nthat I am tormented with the torment of Tantalus... And, of course, no\r\nspirit-maidens will even deign to visit so skeptical a person as\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nI want to know, for example, the whole story of that Chinese maiden\r\nwhom the butterflies took to be a flower, and followed in multitude,\xe2\x80\x94so\r\nfragrant and so fair was she. Also I should like to know something more\r\nconcerning the butterflies of the Emperor Gens\xc5\x8d, or Ming Hwang, who\r\nmade them choose his loves for him... He used to hold wine-parties in\r\nhis amazing garden; and ladies of exceeding beauty were in attendance;\r\nand caged butterflies, set free among them, would fly to the fairest;\r\nand then, upon that fairest the Imperial favor was bestowed. But after\r\nGens\xc5\x8d K\xc5\x8dtei had seen Y\xc5\x8dkihi (whom the Chinese call Yang-Kwei-Fei), he\r\nwould not suffer the butterflies to choose for him,\xe2\x80\x94which was unlucky,\r\nas Yokihi got him into serious trouble... Again, I should like to know\r\nmore about the experience of that Chinese scholar, celebrated in Japan\r\nunder the name S\xc5\x8dsh\xc5\xab, who dreamed that he was a butterfly, and had all\r\nthe sensations of a butterfly in that dream. For his spirit had really\r\nbeen wandering about in the shape of a butterfly; and, when he awoke,\r\nthe memories and the feelings of butterfly existence remained so vivid\r\nin his mind that he could not act like a human being... Finally I\r\nshould like to know the text of a certain Chinese official recognition\r\nof sundry butterflies as the spirits of an Emperor and of his\r\nattendants...\r\n\r\nMost of the Japanese literature about butterflies, excepting some\r\npoetry, appears to be of Chinese origin; and even that old national\r\na\xc3\xa6sthetic feeling on the subject, which found such delightful\r\nexpression in Japanese art and song and custom, may have been first\r\ndeveloped under Chinese teaching. Chinese precedent doubtless explains\r\nwhy Japanese poets and painters chose so often for their _geimy\xc5\x8d_, or\r\nprofessional appellations, such names as _Ch\xc5\x8dmu_ (\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly-Dream),\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_Ich\xc5\x8d_ (\xe2\x80\x9cSolitary Butterfly),\xe2\x80\x9d etc. And even to this day such _geimy\xc5\x8d_\r\nas _Ch\xc5\x8dhana_ (\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly-Blossom\xe2\x80\x9d), _Ch\xc5\x8dkichi_ (\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly-Luck\xe2\x80\x9d), or\r\n_Ch\xc5\x8dnosuk\xc3\xa9_ (\xe2\x80\x9cButterfly-Help\xe2\x80\x9d), are affected by dancing-girls. Besides\r\nartistic names having reference to butterflies, there are still in use\r\nreal personal names (_yobina_) of this kind,\xe2\x80\x94such as Koch\xc5\x8d, or Ch\xc5\x8d,\r\nmeaning \xe2\x80\x9cButterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d They are borne by women only, as a rule,\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nthere are some strange exceptions... And here I may mention that, in\r\nthe province of Mutsu, there still exists the curious old custom of\r\ncalling the youngest daughter in a family _Tekona_,\xe2\x80\x94which quaint word,\r\nobsolete elsewhere, signifies in Mutsu dialect a butterfly. In classic\r\ntime this word signified also a beautiful woman...\r\n\r\nIt is possible also that some weird Japanese beliefs about butterflies\r\nare of Chinese derivation; but these beliefs might be older than China\r\nherself. The most interesting one, I think, is that the soul of a\r\n_living_ person may wander about in the form of a butterfly. Some\r\npretty fancies have been evolved out of this belief,\xe2\x80\x94such as the notion\r\nthat if a butterfly enters your guest-room and perches behind the\r\nbamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. That\r\na butterfly may be the spirit of somebody is not a reason for being\r\nafraid of it. Nevertheless there are times when even butterflies can\r\ninspire fear by appearing in prodigious numbers; and Japanese history\r\nrecords such an event. When Ta\xc3\xafra-no-Masakado was secretly preparing\r\nfor his famous revolt, there appeared in Ky\xc5\x8dto so vast a swarm of\r\nbutterflies that the people were frightened,\xe2\x80\x94thinking the apparition to\r\nbe a portent of coming evil... Perhaps those butterflies were supposed\r\nto be the spirits of the thousands doomed to perish in battle, and\r\nagitated on the eve of war by some mysterious premonition of death.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Japanese belief, a butterfly may be the soul of a dead\r\nperson as well as of a living person. Indeed it is a custom of souls to\r\ntake butterfly-shape in order to announce the fact of their final\r\ndeparture from the body; and for this reason any butterfly which enters\r\na house ought to be kindly treated.\r\n\r\nTo this belief, and to queer fancies connected with it, there are many\r\nallusions in popular drama. For example, there is a well-known play\r\ncalled _Tond\xc3\xa9-d\xc3\xa9ru-Koch\xc5\x8d-no-Kanzashi;_ or, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flying Hairpin of\r\nKoch\xc5\x8d.\xe2\x80\x9d Koch\xc5\x8d is a beautiful person who kills herself because of false\r\naccusations and cruel treatment. Her would-be avenger long seeks in\r\nvain for the author of the wrong. But at last the dead woman\xe2\x80\x99s hairpin\r\nturns into a butterfly, and serves as a guide to vengeance by hovering\r\nabove the place where the villain is hiding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course those big paper butterflies (_o-ch\xc5\x8d_ and _m\xc3\xa9-ch\xc5\x8d_) which\r\nfigure at weddings must not be thought of as having any ghostly\r\nsignification. As emblems they only express the joy of living union,\r\nand the hope that the newly married couple may pass through life\r\ntogether as a pair of butterflies flit lightly through some pleasant\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x94now hovering upward, now downward, but never widely separating.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nA small selection of _hokku_ (1) on butterflies will help to illustrate\r\nJapanese interest in the a\xc3\xa6sthetic side of the subject. Some are\r\npictures only,\xe2\x80\x94tiny color-sketches made with seventeen syllables; some\r\nare nothing more than pretty fancies, or graceful suggestions;\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\nreader will find variety. Probably he will not care much for the verses\r\nin themselves. The taste for Japanese poetry of the epigrammatic sort\r\nis a taste that must be slowly acquired; and it is only by degrees,\r\nafter patient study, that the possibilities of such composition can be\r\nfairly estimated. Hasty criticism has declared that to put forward any\r\nserious claim on behalf of seventeen-syllable poems \xe2\x80\x9cwould be absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut what, then, of Crashaw\xe2\x80\x99s famous line upon the miracle at the\r\nmarriage feast in Cana?\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly fourteen syllables\xe2\x80\x94and immortality. Now with seventeen Japanese\r\nsyllables things quite as wonderful\xe2\x80\x94indeed, much more wonderful\xe2\x80\x94have\r\nbeen done, not once or twice, but probably a thousand times... However,\r\nthere is nothing wonderful in the following _hokku_, which have been\r\nselected for more than literary reasons:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    Nugi-kakuru[2]\r\nHaori sugata no\r\n    Koch\xc5\x8d kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Like a_ haori _being taken off\xe2\x80\x94that is the shape of a butterfly!_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Torisashi no\r\nSao no jama suru\r\n    Koch\xc5\x8d kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Ah, the butterfly keeps getting in the way of the bird-catcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npole!_[3]]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tsurigan\xc3\xa9 ni\r\nTomarit\xc3\xa9 nemuru\r\n    Koch\xc5\x8d kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Perched upon the temple-bell, the butterfly sleeps:_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    N\xc3\xa9ru-uchi mo\r\nAsobu-yum\xc3\xa9 wo ya\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Kusa no ch\xc5\x8d!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Even while sleeping, its dream is of play\xe2\x80\x94ah, the butterfly of the\r\ngrass!_[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oki, oki yo!\r\nWaga tomo ni sen,\r\n    N\xc3\xa9ru-koch\xc5\x8d!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Wake up! wake up!\xe2\x80\x94I will make thee my comrade, thou sleeping\r\nbutterfly._[5]]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Kago no tori\r\nCh\xc5\x8d wo urayamu\r\n    Metsuki kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Ah, the sad expression in the eyes of that caged bird!\xe2\x80\x94envying the\r\nbutterfly!_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch\xc5\x8d tond\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94\r\nKaz\xc3\xa9 naki hi to mo\r\n    Mi\xc3\xabzari ki!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Even though it did not appear to be a windy day_,[6] _the fluttering\r\nof the butterflies\xe2\x80\x94!_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rakkwa \xc3\xa9da ni\r\nKa\xc3\xabru to mir\xc3\xa9ba\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Koch\xc5\x8d kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_When I saw the fallen flower return to the branch\xe2\x80\x94lo! it was only a\r\nbutterfly!_[7]]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Chiru-hana ni\xe2\x80\x94\r\nKarusa araso\xc3\xbc\r\n    Koch\xc5\x8d kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_How the butterfly strives to compete in lightness with the falling\r\nflowers!_[8]]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch\xc5\x8dch\xc5\x8d ya!\r\nOnna no michi no\r\n    Ato ya saki!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See that butterfly on the woman\xe2\x80\x99s path,\xe2\x80\x94now fluttering behind her,\r\nnow before!_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ch\xc5\x8dch\xc5\x8d ya!\r\nHana-nusubito wo\r\n    Tsuk\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9-yuku!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Ha! the butterfly!\xe2\x80\x94it is following the person who stole the\r\nflowers!_]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aki no ch\xc5\x8d\r\nTomo nak\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9ba ya;\r\n    Hito ni tsuku\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Poor autumn butterfly!\xe2\x80\x94when left without a comrade_ (of its own\r\nrace), _it follows after man_ (or \xe2\x80\x9ca person\xe2\x80\x9d)!]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Owar\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 mo,\r\nIsoganu furi no\r\n    Ch\xc5\x8dcho kana!\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Ah, the butterfly!

The\r\noriginal, of which I have attempted only a free translation, can be\r\nfound in the curious old book _Mushi-Isam\xc3\xa9_ (\xe2\x80\x9cInsect-Admonitions\xe2\x80\x9d); and\r\nit assumes the form of a discourse to a butterfly. But it is really a\r\ndidactic allegory,\xe2\x80\x94suggesting the moral significance of a social rise\r\nand fall:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, under the sun of spring, the winds are gentle, and flowers pinkly\r\nbloom, and grasses are soft, and the hearts of people are glad.\r\nButterflies everywhere flutter joyously: so many persons now compose\r\nChinese verses and Japanese verses about butterflies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this season, O Butterfly, is indeed the season of your bright\r\nprosperity: so comely you now are that in the whole world there is\r\nnothing more comely. For that reason all other insects admire and envy\r\nyou;\xe2\x80\x94there is not among them even one that does not envy you. Nor do\r\ninsects alone regard you with envy: men also both envy and admire you.\r\nS\xc5\x8dsh\xc5\xab of China, in a dream, assumed your shape;\xe2\x80\x94Sakoku of Japan, after\r\ndying, took your form, and therein made ghostly apparition. Nor is the\r\nenvy that you inspire shared only by insects and mankind: even things\r\nwithout soul change their form into yours;\xe2\x80\x94witness the barley-grass,\r\nwhich turns into a butterfly.[13]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore you are lifted up with pride, and think to yourself: \xe2\x80\x98In\r\nall this world there is nothing superior to me!\xe2\x80\x99 Ah! I can very well\r\nguess what is in your heart: you are too much satisfied with your own\r\nperson. That is why you let yourself be blown thus lightly about by\r\nevery wind;\xe2\x80\x94that is why you never remain still,\xe2\x80\x94always, always\r\nthinking, \xe2\x80\x98In the whole world there is no one so fortunate as I.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut now try to think a little about your own personal history. It is\r\nworth recalling; for there is a vulgar side to it. How a vulgar side?\r\nWell, for a considerable time after you were born, you had no such\r\nreason for rejoicing in your form. You were then a mere cabbage-insect,\r\na hairy worm; and you were so poor that you could not afford even one\r\nrobe to cover your nakedness; and your appearance was altogether\r\ndisgusting. Everybody in those days hated the sight of you. Indeed you\r\nhad good reason to be ashamed of yourself; and so ashamed you were that\r\nyou collected old twigs and rubbish to hide in, and you made a\r\nhiding-nest, and hung it to a branch,\xe2\x80\x94and then everybody cried out to\r\nyou, \xe2\x80\x98Raincoat Insect!\xe2\x80\x99 (_Mino-mushi_.)[14] And during that period of\r\nyour life, your sins were grievous. Among the tender green leaves of\r\nbeautiful cherry-trees you and your fellows assembled, and there made\r\nugliness extraordinary; and the expectant eyes of the people, who came\r\nfrom far away to admire the beauty of those cherry-trees, were hurt by\r\nthe sight of you. And of things even more hateful than this you were\r\nguilty. You knew that poor, poor men and women had been cultivating\r\n_daikon_ (2) in their fields,\xe2\x80\x94toiling under the hot sun till their\r\nhearts were filled with bitterness by reason of having to care for that\r\n_daikon;_ and you persuaded your companions to go with you, and to\r\ngather upon the leaves of that _daikon_, and on the leaves of other\r\nvegetables planted by those poor people. Out of your greediness you\r\nravaged those leaves, and gnawed them into all shapes of\r\nugliness,\xe2\x80\x94caring nothing for the trouble of those poor folk... Yes,\r\nsuch a creature you were, and such were your doings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now that you have a comely form, you despise your old comrades,\r\nthe insects; and, whenever you happen to meet any of them, you pretend\r\nnot to know them [literally, \xe2\x80\x98You make an I-don\xe2\x80\x99t-know face\xe2\x80\x99]. Now you\r\nwant to have none but wealthy and exalted people for friends... Ah! You\r\nhave forgotten the old times, have you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that many people have forgotten your past, and are charmed\r\nby the sight of your present graceful shape and white wings, and write\r\nChinese verses and Japanese verses about you. The high-born damsel, who\r\ncould not bear even to look at you in your former shape, now gazes at\r\nyou with delight, and wants you to perch upon her hairpin, and holds\r\nout her dainty fan in the hope that you will light upon it. But this\r\nreminds me that there is an ancient Chinese story about you, which is\r\nnot pretty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the time of the Emperor Gens\xc5\x8d, the Imperial Palace contained\r\nhundreds and thousands of beautiful ladies,\xe2\x80\x94so many, indeed, that it\r\nwould have been difficult for any man to decide which among them was\r\nthe loveliest. So all of those beautiful persons were assembled\r\ntogether in one place; and you were set free to fly among them; and it\r\nwas decreed that the damsel upon whose hairpin you perched should be\r\naugustly summoned to the Imperial Chamber. In that time there could not\r\nbe more than one Empress\xe2\x80\x94which was a good law; but, because of you, the\r\nEmperor Gens\xc5\x8d did great mischief in the land. For your mind is light\r\nand frivolous; and although among so many beautiful women there must\r\nhave been some persons of pure heart, you would look for nothing but\r\nbeauty, and so betook yourself to the person most beautiful in outward\r\nappearance. Therefore many of the female attendants ceased altogether\r\nto think about the right way of women, and began to study how to make\r\nthemselves appear splendid in the eyes of men. And the end of it was\r\nthat the Emperor Gens\xc5\x8d died a pitiful and painful death\xe2\x80\x94all because of\r\nyour light and trifling mind. Indeed, your real character can easily be\r\nseen from your conduct in other matters. There are trees, for\r\nexample,\xe2\x80\x94such as the evergreen-oak and the pine,\xe2\x80\x94whose leaves do not\r\nfade and fall, but remain always green;\xe2\x80\x94these are trees of firm heart,\r\ntrees of solid character. But you say that they are stiff and formal;\r\nand you hate the sight of them, and never pay them a visit. Only to the\r\ncherry-tree, and the _kaido_[15], and the peony, and the yellow rose\r\nyou go: those you like because they have showy flowers, and you try\r\nonly to please them. Such conduct, let me assure you, is very\r\nunbecoming. Those trees certainly have handsome flowers; but\r\nhunger-satisfying fruits they have not; and they are grateful to those\r\nonly who are fond of luxury and show. And that is just the reason why\r\nthey are pleased by your fluttering wings and delicate shape;\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nwhy they are kind to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, in this spring season, while you sportively dance through the\r\ngardens of the wealthy, or hover among the beautiful alleys of\r\ncherry-trees in blossom, you say to yourself: \xe2\x80\x98Nobody in the world has\r\nsuch pleasure as I, or such excellent friends. And, in spite of all\r\nthat people may say, I most love the peony,\xe2\x80\x94and the golden yellow rose\r\nis my own darling, and I will obey her every least behest; for that is\r\nmy pride and my delight.\xe2\x80\x99... So you say. But the opulent and elegant\r\nseason of flowers is very short: soon they will fade and fall. Then, in\r\nthe time of summer heat, there will be green leaves only; and presently\r\nthe winds of autumn will blow, when even the leaves themselves will\r\nshower down like rain, _parari-parari_. And your fate will then be as\r\nthe fate of the unlucky in the proverb, _Tanomi ki no shita ni am\xc3\xa9\r\nfuru_ [Even through the tree upon which I relied for shelter the rain\r\nleaks down]. For you will seek out your old friend, the root-cutting\r\ninsect, the grub, and beg him to let you return into your old-time\r\nhole;\xe2\x80\x94but now having wings, you will not be able to enter the hole\r\nbecause of them, and you will not be able to shelter your body anywhere\r\nbetween heaven and earth, and all the moor-grass will then have\r\nwithered, and you will not have even one drop of dew with which to\r\nmoisten your tongue,\xe2\x80\x94and there will be nothing left for you to do but\r\nto lie down and die. All because of your light and frivolous heart\xe2\x80\x94but,\r\nah! how lamentable an end!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMost of the Japanese stories about butterflies appear, as I have said,\r\nto be of Chinese origin. But I have one which is probably indigenous;\r\nand it seems to me worth telling for the benefit of persons who believe\r\nthere is no \xe2\x80\x9cromantic love\xe2\x80\x9d in the Far East.\r\n\r\nBehind the cemetery of the temple of S\xc5\x8dzanji, in the suburbs of the\r\ncapital, there long stood a solitary cottage, occupied by an old man\r\nnamed Takahama. He was liked in the neighborhood, by reason of his\r\namiable ways; but almost everybody supposed him to be a little mad.\r\nUnless a man take the Buddhist vows, he is expected to marry, and to\r\nbring up a family. But Takahama did not belong to the religious life;\r\nand he could not be persuaded to marry. Neither had he ever been known\r\nto enter into a love-relation with any woman. For more than fifty years\r\nhe had lived entirely alone.\r\n\r\nOne summer he fell sick, and knew that he had not long to live. He then\r\nsent for his sister-in-law, a widow, and for her only son,\xe2\x80\x94a lad of\r\nabout twenty years old, to whom he was much attached. Both promptly\r\ncame, and did whatever they could to soothe the old man\xe2\x80\x99s last hours.\r\n\r\nOne sultry afternoon, while the widow and her son were watching at his\r\nbedside, Takahama fell asleep. At the same moment a very large white\r\nbutterfly entered the room, and perched upon the sick man\xe2\x80\x99s pillow. The\r\nnephew drove it away with a fan; but it returned immediately to the\r\npillow, and was again driven away, only to come back a third time. Then\r\nthe nephew chased it into the garden, and across the garden, through an\r\nopen gate, into the cemetery of the neighboring temple. But it\r\ncontinued to flutter before him as if unwilling to be driven further,\r\nand acted so queerly that he began to wonder whether it was really a\r\nbutterfly, or a _ma_[16]. He again chased it, and followed it far into\r\nthe cemetery, until he saw it fly against a tomb,\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s tomb. There\r\nit unaccountably disappeared; and he searched for it in vain. He then\r\nexamined the monument. It bore the personal name \xe2\x80\x9cAkiko,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) together\r\nwith an unfamiliar family name, and an inscription stating that Akiko\r\nhad died at the age of eighteen. Apparently the tomb had been erected\r\nabout fifty years previously: moss had begun to gather upon it. But it\r\nhad been well cared for: there were fresh flowers before it; and the\r\nwater-tank had recently been filled.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the sick room, the young man was shocked by the\r\nannouncement that his uncle had ceased to breathe. Death had come to\r\nthe sleeper painlessly; and the dead face smiled.\r\n\r\nThe young man told his mother of what he had seen in the cemetery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the widow, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it must have been Akiko!\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who was Akiko, mother?\xe2\x80\x9d the nephew asked.\r\n\r\nThe widow answered:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen your good uncle was young he was betrothed to a charming girl\r\ncalled Akiko, the daughter of a neighbor. Akiko died of consumption,\r\nonly a little before the day appointed for the wedding; and her\r\npromised husband sorrowed greatly. After Akiko had been buried, he made\r\na vow never to marry; and he built this little house beside the\r\ncemetery, so that he might be always near her grave. All this happened\r\nmore than fifty years ago. And every day of those fifty years\xe2\x80\x94winter\r\nand summer alike\xe2\x80\x94your uncle went to the cemetery, and prayed at the\r\ngrave, and swept the tomb, and set offerings before it. But he did not\r\nlike to have any mention made of the matter; and he never spoke of\r\nit... So, at last, Akiko came for him: the white butterfly was her\r\nsoul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten to mention an ancient Japanese dance, called the\r\nButterfly Dance (_Koch\xc5\x8d-Mai_), which used to be performed in the\r\nImperial Palace, by dancers costumed as butterflies. Whether it is\r\ndanced occasionally nowadays I do not know. It is said to be very\r\ndifficult to learn. Six dancers are required for the proper performance\r\nof it; and they must move in particular figures,\xe2\x80\x94obeying traditional\r\nrules for every step, pose, or gesture,\xe2\x80\x94and circling about each other\r\nvery slowly to the sound of hand-drums and great drums, small flutes\r\nand great flutes, and pandean pipes of a form unknown to Western Pan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration] BUTTERFLY DANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a view to self-protection I have been reading Dr. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s book,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMosquitoes.\xe2\x80\x9d I am persecuted by mosquitoes. There are several species\r\nin my neighborhood; but only one of them is a serious torment,\xe2\x80\x94a tiny\r\nneedly thing, all silver-speckled and silver-streaked. The puncture of\r\nit is sharp as an electric burn; and the mere hum of it has a\r\nlancinating quality of tone which foretells the quality of the pain\r\nabout to come,\xe2\x80\x94much in the same way that a particular smell suggests a\r\nparticular taste. I find that this mosquito much resembles the creature\r\nwhich Dr. Howard calls _Stegomyia fasciata_, or _Culex fasciatus:_ and\r\nthat its habits are the same as those of the _Stegomyia_. For example,\r\nit is diurnal rather than nocturnal and becomes most troublesome in the\r\nafternoon. And I have discovered that it comes from the Buddhist\r\ncemetery,\xe2\x80\x94a very old cemetery,\xe2\x80\x94in the rear of my garden.\r\n\r\nDr. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s book declares that, in order to rid a neighborhood of\r\nmosquitoes, it is only necessary to pour a little petroleum, or\r\nkerosene oil, into the stagnant water where they breed. Once a week the\r\noil should be used, \xe2\x80\x9cat the rate of once ounce for every fifteen square\r\nfeet of water-surface, and a proportionate quantity for any less\r\nsurface.\xe2\x80\x9d ...But please to consider the conditions in _my_\r\nneighborhood!\r\n\r\nI have said that my tormentors come from the Buddhist cemetery. Before\r\nnearly every tomb in that old cemetery there is a water-receptacle, or\r\ncistern, called _mizutam\xc3\xa9_. In the majority of cases this _mizutam\xc3\xa9_ is\r\nsimply an oblong cavity chiseled in the broad pedestal supporting the\r\nmonument; but before tombs of a costly kind, having no pedestal-tank, a\r\nlarger separate tank is placed, cut out of a single block of stone, and\r\ndecorated with a family crest, or with symbolic carvings. In front of a\r\ntomb of the humblest class, having no _mizutam\xc3\xa9_, water is placed in\r\ncups or other vessels,\xe2\x80\x94for the dead must have water. Flowers also must\r\nbe offered to them; and before every tomb you will find a pair of\r\nbamboo cups, or other flower-vessels; and these, of course, contain\r\nwater. There is a well in the cemetery to supply water for the graves.\r\nWhenever the tombs are visited by relatives and friends of the dead,\r\nfresh water is poured into the tanks and cups. But as an old cemetery\r\nof this kind contains thousands of _mizutam\xc3\xa9_, and tens of thousands of\r\nflower-vessels the water in all of these cannot be renewed every day.\r\nIt becomes stagnant and populous. The deeper tanks seldom get dry;\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrainfall at T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d being heavy enough to keep them partly filled during\r\nnine months out of the twelve.\r\n\r\nWell, it is in these tanks and flower-vessels that mine enemies are\r\nborn: they rise by millions from the water of the dead;\xe2\x80\x94and, according\r\nto Buddhist doctrine, some of them may be reincarnations of those very\r\ndead, condemned by the error of former lives to the condition of\r\n_Jiki-ketsu-gaki_, or blood-drinking pretas.... Anyhow the malevolence\r\nof the _Culex fasciatus_ would justify the suspicion that some wicked\r\nhuman soul had been compressed into that wailing speck of a body....\r\n\r\nNow, to return to the subject of kerosene-oil, you can exterminate the\r\nmosquitoes of any locality by covering with a film of kerosene all\r\nstagnant water surfaces therein. The larvae die on rising to breathe;\r\nand the adult females perish when they approach the water to launch\r\ntheir rafts of eggs. And I read, in Dr. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s book, that the actual\r\ncost of freeing from mosquitoes one American town of fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants, does not exceed three hundred dollars!...\r\n\r\nI wonder what would be said if the city-government of T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\naggressively scientific and progressive\xe2\x80\x94were suddenly to command that\r\nall water-surfaces in the Buddhist cemeteries should be covered, at\r\nregular intervals, with a film of kerosene oil! How could the religion\r\nwhich prohibits the taking of any life\xe2\x80\x94even of invisible life\xe2\x80\x94yield to\r\nsuch a mandate? Would filial piety even dream of consenting to obey\r\nsuch an order? And then to think of the cost, in labor and time, of\r\nputting kerosene oil, every seven days, into the millions of\r\n_mizutam\xc3\xa9_, and the tens of millions of bamboo flower-cups, in the\r\nT\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d graveyards!... Impossible! To free the city from mosquitoes it\r\nwould be necessary to demolish the ancient graveyards;\xe2\x80\x94and that would\r\nsignify the ruin of the Buddhist temples attached to them;\xe2\x80\x94and that\r\nwould mean the disparition of so many charming gardens, with their\r\nlotus-ponds and Sanscrit-lettered monuments and humpy bridges and holy\r\ngroves and weirdly-smiling Buddhas! So the extermination of the _Culex\r\nfasciatus_ would involve the destruction of the poetry of the ancestral\r\ncult,\xe2\x80\x94surely too great a price to pay!...\r\n\r\nBesides, I should like, when my time comes, to be laid away in some\r\nBuddhist graveyard of the ancient kind,\xe2\x80\x94so that my ghostly company\r\nshould be ancient, caring nothing for the fashions and the changes and\r\nthe disintegrations of Meiji (1). That old cemetery behind my garden\r\nwould be a suitable place. Everything there is beautiful with a beauty\r\nof exceeding and startling queerness; each tree and stone has been\r\nshaped by some old, old ideal which no longer exists in any living\r\nbrain; even the shadows are not of this time and sun, but of a world\r\nforgotten, that never knew steam or electricity or magnetism\r\nor\xe2\x80\x94kerosene oil! Also in the boom of the big bell there is a quaintness\r\nof tone which wakens feelings, so strangely far-away from all the\r\nnineteenth-century part of me, that the faint blind stirrings of them\r\nmake me afraid,\xe2\x80\x94deliciously afraid. Never do I hear that billowing peal\r\nbut I become aware of a striving and a fluttering in the abyssal part\r\nof my ghost,\xe2\x80\x94a sensation as of memories struggling to reach the light\r\nbeyond the obscurations of a million million deaths and births. I hope\r\nto remain within hearing of that bell... And, considering the\r\npossibility of being doomed to the state of a _Jiki-ketsu-gaki_, I want\r\nto have my chance of being reborn in some bamboo flower-cup, or\r\n_mizutam\xc3\xa9_, whence I might issue softly, singing my thin and pungent\r\nsong, to bite some people that I know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThis morning sky, after the night\xe2\x80\x99s tempest, is a pure and dazzling\r\nblue. The air\xe2\x80\x94the delicious air!\xe2\x80\x94is full of sweet resinous odors, shed\r\nfrom the countless pine-boughs broken and strewn by the gale. In the\r\nneighboring bamboo-grove I hear the flute-call of the bird that praises\r\nthe S\xc3\xbbtra of the Lotos; and the land is very still by reason of the\r\nsouth wind. Now the summer, long delayed, is truly with us: butterflies\r\nof queer Japanese colors are flickering about; semi (1) are wheezing;\r\nwasps are humming; gnats are dancing in the sun; and the ants are busy\r\nrepairing their damaged habitations... I bethink me of a Japanese\r\npoem:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    Yuku \xc3\xa9 naki:\r\nAri no sumai ya!\r\n    Go-getsu am\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Now the poor creature has nowhere to go!... Alas for the dwellings of\r\nthe ants in this rain of the fifth month!_]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut those big black ants in my garden do not seem to need any sympathy.\r\nThey have weathered the storm in some unimaginable way, while great\r\ntrees were being uprooted, and houses blown to fragments, and roads\r\nwashed out of existence. Yet, before the typhoon, they took no other\r\nvisible precaution than to block up the gates of their subterranean\r\ntown. And the spectacle of their triumphant toil to-day impels me to\r\nattempt an essay on Ants.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to preface my disquisitions with something from the\r\nold Japanese literature,\xe2\x80\x94something emotional or metaphysical. But all\r\nthat my Japanese friends were able to find for me on the\r\nsubject,\xe2\x80\x94excepting some verses of little worth,\xe2\x80\x94was Chinese. This\r\nChinese material consisted chiefly of strange stories; and one of them\r\nseems to me worth quoting,\xe2\x80\x94_faute de mieux_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the province of Taish\xc5\xab, in China, there was a pious man who, every\r\nday, during many years, fervently worshiped a certain goddess. One\r\nmorning, while he was engaged in his devotions, a beautiful woman,\r\nwearing a yellow robe, came into his chamber and stood before him. He,\r\ngreatly surprised, asked her what she wanted, and why she had entered\r\nunannounced. She answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a woman: I am the goddess whom you\r\nhave so long and so faithfully worshiped; and I have now come to prove\r\nto you that your devotion has not been in vain... Are you acquainted\r\nwith the language of Ants?\xe2\x80\x9d The worshiper replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am only a\r\nlow-born and ignorant person,\xe2\x80\x94not a scholar; and even of the language\r\nof superior men I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d At these words the goddess smiled, and\r\ndrew from her bosom a little box, shaped like an incense box. She\r\nopened the box, dipped a finger into it, and took therefrom some kind\r\nof ointment with which she anointed the ears of the man. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid to him, \xe2\x80\x9ctry to find some Ants, and when you find any, stoop down,\r\nand listen carefully to their talk. You will be able to understand it;\r\nand you will hear of something to your advantage... Only remember that\r\nyou must not frighten or vex the Ants.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the goddess vanished away.\r\n\r\nThe man immediately went out to look for some Ants. He had scarcely\r\ncrossed the threshold of his door when he perceived two Ants upon a\r\nstone supporting one of the house-pillars. He stooped over them, and\r\nlistened; and he was astonished to find that he could hear them\r\ntalking, and could understand what they said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us try to find a\r\nwarmer place,\xe2\x80\x9d proposed one of the Ants. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy a warmer place?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nthe other;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the matter with this place?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too damp and\r\ncold below,\xe2\x80\x9d said the first Ant; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a big treasure buried here;\r\nand the sunshine cannot warm the ground about it.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the two Ants\r\nwent away together, and the listener ran for a spade.\r\n\r\nBy digging in the neighborhood of the pillar, he soon found a number of\r\nlarge jars full of gold coin. The discovery of this treasure made him a\r\nvery rich man.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he often tried to listen to the conversation of Ants. But he\r\nwas never again able to hear them speak. The ointment of the goddess\r\nhad opened his ears to their mysterious language for only a single day.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I, like that Chinese devotee, must confess myself a very ignorant\r\nperson, and naturally unable to hear the conversation of Ants. But the\r\nFairy of Science sometimes touches my ears and eyes with her wand; and\r\nthen, for a little time, I am able to hear things inaudible, and to\r\nperceive things imperceptible.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nFor the same reason that it is considered wicked, in sundry circles, to\r\nspeak of a non-Christian people having produced a civilization\r\nethically superior to our own, certain persons will not be pleased by\r\nwhat I am going to say about ants. But there are men, incomparably\r\nwiser than I can ever hope to be, who think about insects and\r\ncivilizations independently of the blessings of Christianity; and I\r\nfind encouragement in the new _Cambridge Natural History_, which\r\ncontains the following remarks by Professor David Sharp, concerning\r\nants:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObservation has revealed the most remarkable phenomena in the lives of\r\nthese insects. Indeed we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that they\r\nhave acquired, in many respects, the art of living together in\r\nsocieties more perfectly than our own species has; and that they have\r\nanticipated us in the acquisition of some of the industries and arts\r\nthat greatly facilitate social life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI suppose that a few well-informed persons will dispute this plain\r\nstatement by a trained specialist. The contemporary man of science is\r\nnot apt to become sentimental about ants or bees; but he will not\r\nhesitate to acknowledge that, in regard to social evolution, these\r\ninsects appear to have advanced \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond man.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Herbert Spencer, whom\r\nnobody will charge with romantic tendencies, goes considerably further\r\nthan Professor Sharp; showing us that ants are, in a very real sense,\r\n_ethically_ as well as economically in advance of humanity,\xe2\x80\x94their lives\r\nbeing entirely devoted to altruistic ends. Indeed, Professor Sharp\r\nsomewhat needlessly qualifies his praise of the ant with this cautious\r\nobservation:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe competence of the ant is not like that of man. It is devoted to\r\nthe welfare of the species rather than to that of the individual, which\r\nis, as it were, sacrificed or specialized for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The obvious implication,\xe2\x80\x94that any social state, in which the\r\nimprovement of the individual is sacrificed to the common welfare,\r\nleaves much to be desired,\xe2\x80\x94is probably correct, from the actual human\r\nstandpoint. For man is yet imperfectly evolved; and human society has\r\nmuch to gain from his further individualization. But in regard to\r\nsocial insects the implied criticism is open to question. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nimprovement of the individual,\xe2\x80\x9d says Herbert Spencer, \xe2\x80\x9cconsists in the\r\nbetter fitting of him for social cooperation; and this, being conducive\r\nto social prosperity, is conducive to the maintenance of the race.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nother words, the value of the individual can be _only_ in relation to\r\nthe society; and this granted, whether the sacrifice of the individual\r\nfor the sake of that society be good or evil must depend upon what the\r\nsociety might gain or lose through a further individualization of its\r\nmembers... But as we shall presently see, the conditions of ant-society\r\nthat most deserve our attention are the ethical conditions; and these\r\nare beyond human criticism, since they realize that ideal of moral\r\nevolution described by Mr. Spencer as \xe2\x80\x9ca state in which egoism and\r\naltruism are so conciliated that the one merges into the other.\xe2\x80\x9d That\r\nis to say, a state in which the only possible pleasure is the pleasure\r\nof unselfish action. Or, again to quote Mr. Spencer, the activities of\r\nthe insect-society are \xe2\x80\x9cactivities which postpone individual well-being\r\nso completely to the well-being of the community that individual life\r\nappears to be attended to only just so far as is necessary to make\r\npossible due attention to social life,... the individual taking only\r\njust such food and just such rest as are needful to maintain its\r\nvigor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nI hope my reader is aware that ants practise horticulture and\r\nagriculture; that they are skillful in the cultivation of mushrooms;\r\nthat they have domesticated (according to present knowledge) five\r\nhundred and eighty-four different kinds of animals; that they make\r\ntunnels through solid rock; that they know how to provide against\r\natmospheric changes which might endanger the health of their children;\r\nand that, for insects, their longevity is exceptional,\xe2\x80\x94members of the\r\nmore highly evolved species living for a considerable number of years.\r\n\r\nBut it is not especially of these matters that I wish to speak. What I\r\nwant to talk about is the awful propriety, the terrible morality, of\r\nthe ant[1]. Our most appalling ideals of conduct fall short of the\r\nethics of the ant,\xe2\x80\x94as progress is reckoned in time,\xe2\x80\x94by nothing less\r\nthan millions of years!... When I say \xe2\x80\x9cthe ant,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean the highest\r\ntype of ant,\xe2\x80\x94not, of course, the entire ant-family. About two thousand\r\nspecies of ants are already known; and these exhibit, in their social\r\norganizations, widely varying degrees of evolution. Certain social\r\nphenomena of the greatest biological importance, and of no less\r\nimportance in their strange relation to the subject of ethics, can be\r\nstudied to advantage only in the existence of the most highly evolved\r\nsocieties of ants.\r\n\r\nAfter all that has been written of late years about the probable value\r\nof relative experience in the long life of the ant, I suppose that few\r\npersons would venture to deny individual character to the ant. The\r\nintelligence of the little creature in meeting and overcoming\r\ndifficulties of a totally new kind, and in adapting itself to\r\nconditions entirely foreign to its experience, proves a considerable\r\npower of independent thinking. But this at least is certain: that the\r\nant has no individuality capable of being exercised in a purely selfish\r\ndirection;\xe2\x80\x94I am using the word \xe2\x80\x9cselfish\xe2\x80\x9d in its ordinary acceptation. A\r\ngreedy ant, a sensual ant, an ant capable of any one of the seven\r\ndeadly sins, or even of a small venial sin, is unimaginable. Equally\r\nunimaginable, of course, a romantic ant, an ideological ant, a poetical\r\nant, or an ant inclined to metaphysical speculations. No human mind\r\ncould attain to the absolute matter-of-fact quality of the ant-mind;\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nhuman being, as now constituted, could cultivate a mental habit so\r\nimpeccably practical as that of the ant. But this superlatively\r\npractical mind is incapable of moral error. It would be difficult,\r\nperhaps, to prove that the ant has no religious ideas. But it is\r\ncertain that such ideas could not be of any use to it. The being\r\nincapable of moral weakness is beyond the need of \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnly in a vague way can we conceive the character of ant-society, and\r\nthe nature of ant-morality; and to do even this we must try to imagine\r\nsome yet impossible state of human society and human morals. Let us,\r\nthen, imagine a world full of people incessantly and furiously\r\nworking,\xe2\x80\x94all of whom seem to be women. No one of these women could be\r\npersuaded or deluded into taking a single atom of food more than is\r\nneedful to maintain her strength; and no one of them ever sleeps a\r\nsecond longer than is necessary to keep her nervous system in good\r\nworking-order. And all of them are so peculiarly constituted that the\r\nleast unnecessary indulgence would result in some derangement of\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThe work daily performed by these female laborers comprises\r\nroad-making, bridge-building, timber-cutting, architectural\r\nconstruction of numberless kinds, horticulture and agriculture, the\r\nfeeding and sheltering of a hundred varieties of domestic animals, the\r\nmanufacture of sundry chemical products, the storage and conservation\r\nof countless food-stuffs, and the care of the children of the race. All\r\nthis labor is done for the commonwealth\xe2\x80\x94no citizen of which is capable\r\neven of thinking about \xe2\x80\x9cproperty,\xe2\x80\x9d except as a _res publica;_\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nsole object of the commonwealth is the nurture and training of its\r\nyoung,\xe2\x80\x94nearly all of whom are girls. The period of infancy is long: the\r\nchildren remain for a great while, not only helpless, but shapeless,\r\nand withal so delicate that they must be very carefully guarded against\r\nthe least change of temperature. Fortunately their nurses understand\r\nthe laws of health: each thoroughly knows all that she ought to know in\r\nregard to ventilation, disinfection, drainage, moisture, and the danger\r\nof germs,\xe2\x80\x94germs being as visible, perhaps, to her myopic sight as they\r\nbecome to our own eyes under the microscope. Indeed, all matters of\r\nhygiene are so well comprehended that no nurse ever makes a mistake\r\nabout the sanitary conditions of her neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this perpetual labor no worker remains unkempt: each is\r\nscrupulously neat, making her toilet many times a day. But as every\r\nworker is born with the most beautiful of combs and brushes attached to\r\nher wrists, no time is wasted in the toilet-room. Besides keeping\r\nthemselves strictly clean, the workers must also keep their houses and\r\ngardens in faultless order, for the sake of the children. Nothing less\r\nthan an earthquake, an eruption, an inundation, or a desperate war, is\r\nallowed to interrupt the daily routine of dusting, sweeping, scrubbing,\r\nand disinfecting.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow for stranger facts:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThis world of incessant toil is a more than Vestal world. It is true\r\nthat males can sometimes be perceived in it; but they appear only at\r\nparticular seasons, and they have nothing whatever to do with the\r\nworkers or with the work. None of them would presume to address a\r\nworker,\xe2\x80\x94except, perhaps, under extraordinary circumstances of common\r\nperil. And no worker would think of talking to a male;\xe2\x80\x94for males, in\r\nthis queer world, are inferior beings, equally incapable of fighting or\r\nworking, and tolerated only as necessary evils. One special class of\r\nfemales,\xe2\x80\x94the Mothers-Elect of the race,\xe2\x80\x94do condescend to consort with\r\nmales, during a very brief period, at particular seasons. But the\r\nMothers-Elect do not work; and they _must_ accept husbands. A worker\r\ncould not even dream of keeping company with a male,\xe2\x80\x94not merely because\r\nsuch association would signify the most frivolous waste of time, nor\r\nyet because the worker necessarily regards all males with unspeakable\r\ncontempt; but because the worker is incapable of wedlock. Some workers,\r\nindeed, are capable of parthenogenesis, and give birth to children who\r\nnever had fathers. As a general rule, however, the worker is truly\r\nfeminine by her moral instincts only: she has all the tenderness, the\r\npatience, and the foresight that we call \xe2\x80\x9cmaternal;\xe2\x80\x9d but her sex has\r\ndisappeared, like the sex of the Dragon-Maiden in the Buddhist legend.\r\n\r\nFor defense against creatures of prey, or enemies of the state, the\r\nworkers are provided with weapons; and they are furthermore protected\r\nby a large military force. The warriors are so much bigger than the\r\nworkers (in some communities, at least) that it is difficult, at first\r\nsight, to believe them of the same race. Soldiers one hundred times\r\nlarger than the workers whom they guard are not uncommon. But all these\r\nsoldiers are Amazons,\xe2\x80\x94or, more correctly speaking, semi-females. They\r\ncan work sturdily; but being built for fighting and for heavy pulling\r\nchiefly, their usefulness is restricted to those directions in which\r\nforce, rather than skill, is required.\r\n\r\n[Why females, rather than males, should have been evolutionally\r\nspecialized into soldiery and laborers may not be nearly so simple a\r\nquestion as it appears. I am very sure of not being able to answer it.\r\nBut natural economy may have decided the matter. In many forms of life,\r\nthe female greatly exceeds the male in bulk and in energy;\xe2\x80\x94perhaps, in\r\nthis case, the larger reserve of life-force possessed originally by the\r\ncomplete female could be more rapidly and effectively utilized for the\r\ndevelopment of a special fighting-caste. All energies which, in the\r\nfertile female, would be expended in the giving of life seem here to\r\nhave been diverted to the evolution of aggressive power, or\r\nworking-capacity.]\r\n\r\nOf the true females,\xe2\x80\x94the Mothers-Elect,\xe2\x80\x94there are very few indeed; and\r\nthese are treated like queens. So constantly and so reverentially are\r\nthey waited upon that they can seldom have any wishes to express. They\r\nare relieved from every care of existence,\xe2\x80\x94except the duty of bearing\r\noffspring. Night and day they are cared for in every possible manner.\r\nThey alone are superabundantly and richly fed:\xe2\x80\x94for the sake of the\r\noffspring they must eat and drink and repose right royally; and their\r\nphysiological specialization allows of such indulgence _ad libitum_.\r\nThey seldom go out, and never unless attended by a powerful escort; as\r\nthey cannot be permitted to incur unnecessary fatigue or danger.\r\nProbably they have no great desire to go out. Around them revolves the\r\nwhole activity of the race: all its intelligence and toil and thrift\r\nare directed solely toward the well-being of these Mothers and of their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nBut last and least of the race rank the husbands of these Mothers,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nnecessary Evils,\xe2\x80\x94the males. They appear only at a particular season, as\r\nI have already observed; and their lives are very short. Some cannot\r\neven boast of noble descent, though destined to royal wedlock; for they\r\nare not royal offspring, but virgin-born,\xe2\x80\x94parthenogenetic\r\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x94and, for that reason especially, inferior beings, the chance\r\nresults of some mysterious atavism. But of any sort of males the\r\ncommonwealth tolerates but few,\xe2\x80\x94barely enough to serve as husbands for\r\nthe Mothers-Elect, and these few perish almost as soon as their duty\r\nhas been done. The meaning of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s law, in this extraordinary\r\nworld, is identical with Ruskin\xe2\x80\x99s teaching that life without effort is\r\ncrime; and since the males are useless as workers or fighters, their\r\nexistence is of only momentary importance. They are not, indeed,\r\nsacrificed,\xe2\x80\x94like the Aztec victim chosen for the festival of\r\nTezcatlipoca, and allowed a honeymoon of twenty days before his heart\r\nwas torn out. But they are scarcely less unfortunate in their high\r\nfortune. Imagine youths brought up in the knowledge that they are\r\ndestined to become royal bridegrooms for a single night,\xe2\x80\x94that after\r\ntheir bridal they will have no moral right to live,\xe2\x80\x94that marriage, for\r\neach and all of them, will signify certain death,\xe2\x80\x94and that they cannot\r\neven hope to be lamented by their young widows, who will survive them\r\nfor a time of many generations...!\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut all the foregoing is no more than a proem to the real \xe2\x80\x9cRomance of\r\nthe Insect-World.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By far the most startling discovery in relation to this astonishing\r\ncivilization is that of the suppression of sex. In certain advanced\r\nforms of ant-life sex totally disappears in the majority of\r\nindividuals;\xe2\x80\x94in nearly all the higher ant-societies sex-life appears to\r\nexist only to the extent absolutely needed for the continuance of the\r\nspecies. But the biological fact in itself is much less startling than\r\nthe ethical suggestion which it offers;\xe2\x80\x94_for this practical\r\nsuppression, or regulation, of sex-faculty appears to be voluntary!_\r\nVoluntary, at least, so far as the species is concerned. It is now\r\nbelieved that these wonderful creatures have learned how to develop, or\r\nto arrest the development, of sex in their young,\xe2\x80\x94by some particular\r\nmode of nutrition. They have succeeded in placing under perfect control\r\nwhat is commonly supposed to be the most powerful and unmanageable of\r\ninstincts. And this rigid restraint of sex-life to within the limits\r\nnecessary to provide against extinction is but one (though the most\r\namazing) of many vital economies effected by the race. Every capacity\r\nfor egoistic pleasure\xe2\x80\x94in the common meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cegoistic\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94has\r\nbeen equally repressed through physiological modification. No\r\nindulgence of any natural appetite is possible except to that degree in\r\nwhich such indulgence can directly or indirectly benefit the\r\nspecies;\xe2\x80\x94even the indispensable requirements of food and sleep being\r\nsatisfied only to the exact extent necessary for the maintenance of\r\nhealthy activity. The individual can exist, act, think, only for the\r\ncommunal good; and the commune triumphantly refuses, in so far as\r\ncosmic law permits, to let itself be ruled either by Love or Hunger.\r\n\r\nMost of us have been brought up in the belief that without some kind of\r\nreligious creed\xe2\x80\x94some hope of future reward or fear of future\r\npunishment\xe2\x80\x94no civilization could exist. We have been taught to think\r\nthat in the absence of laws based upon moral ideas, and in the absence\r\nof an effective police to enforce such laws, nearly everybody would\r\nseek only his or her personal advantage, to the disadvantage of\r\neverybody else. The strong would then destroy the weak; pity and\r\nsympathy would disappear; and the whole social fabric would fall to\r\npieces... These teachings confess the existing imperfection of human\r\nnature; and they contain obvious truth. But those who first proclaimed\r\nthat truth, thousands and thousands of years ago, never imagined a form\r\nof social existence in which selfishness would be _naturally_\r\nimpossible. It remained for irreligious Nature to furnish us with proof\r\npositive that there can exist a society in which the pleasure of active\r\nbeneficence makes needless the idea of duty,\xe2\x80\x94a society in which\r\ninstinctive morality can dispense with ethical codes of every sort,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsociety of which every member is born so absolutely unselfish, and so\r\nenergetically good, that moral training could signify, even for its\r\nyoungest, neither more nor less than waste of precious time.\r\n\r\nTo the Evolutionist such facts necessarily suggest that the value of\r\nour moral idealism is but temporary; and that something better than\r\nvirtue, better than kindness, better than self-denial,\xe2\x80\x94in the present\r\nhuman meaning of those terms,\xe2\x80\x94might, under certain conditions,\r\neventually replace them. He finds himself obliged to face the question\r\nwhether a world without moral notions might not be morally better than\r\na world in which conduct is regulated by such notions. He must even ask\r\nhimself whether the existence of religious commandments, moral laws,\r\nand ethical standards among ourselves does not prove us still in a very\r\nprimitive stage of social evolution. And these questions naturally lead\r\nup to another: Will humanity ever be able, on this planet, to reach an\r\nethical condition beyond all its ideals,\xe2\x80\x94a condition in which\r\neverything that we now call evil will have been atrophied out of\r\nexistence, and everything that we call virtue have been transmuted into\r\ninstinct;\xe2\x80\x94a state of altruism in which ethical concepts and codes will\r\nhave become as useless as they would be, even now, in the societies of\r\nthe higher ants.\r\n\r\nThe giants of modern thought have given some attention to this\r\nquestion; and the greatest among them has answered it\xe2\x80\x94partly in the\r\naffirmative. Herbert Spencer has expressed his belief that humanity\r\nwill arrive at some state of civilization ethically comparable with\r\nthat of the ant:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we have, in lower orders of creatures, cases in which the nature is\r\nconstitutionally so modified that altruistic activities have become one\r\nwith egoistic activities, there is an irresistible implication that a\r\nparallel identification will, under parallel conditions, take place\r\namong human beings. Social insects furnish us with instances completely\r\nto the point,\xe2\x80\x94and instances showing us, indeed, to what a marvelous\r\ndegree the life of the individual may be absorbed in subserving the\r\nlives of other individuals... Neither the ant nor the bee can be\r\nsupposed to have a sense of duty, in the acceptation we give to that\r\nword; nor can it be supposed that it is continually undergoing\r\nself-sacrifice, in the ordinary acceptation of that word... [The facts]\r\nshow us that it is within the possibilities of organization to produce\r\na nature which shall be just as energetic in the pursuit of altruistic\r\nends, as is in other cases shown in the pursuit of egoistic ends;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthey show that, in such cases, these altruistic ends are pursued in\r\npursuing ends which, on their other face, are egoistic. For the\r\nsatisfaction of the needs of the organization, these actions, conducive\r\nto the welfare of others, _must_ be carried on...\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo far from its being true that there must go on, throughout all the\r\nfuture, a condition in which self-regard is to be continually subjected\r\nby the regard for others, it will, contrari-wise, be the case that a\r\nregard for others will eventually become so large a source of pleasure\r\nas to overgrow the pleasure which is derivable from direct egoistic\r\ngratification... Eventually, then, there will come also a state in\r\nwhich egoism and altruism are so conciliated that the one merges in the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOf course the foregoing prediction does not imply that human nature\r\nwill ever undergo such physiological change as would be represented by\r\nstructural specializations comparable to those by which the various\r\ncastes of insect societies are differentiated. We are not bidden to\r\nimagine a future state of humanity in which the active majority would\r\nconsist of semi-female workers and Amazons toiling for an inactive\r\nminority of selected Mothers. Even in his chapter, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Population in\r\nthe Future,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Spencer has attempted no detailed statement of the\r\nphysical modifications inevitable to the production of higher moral\r\ntypes,\xe2\x80\x94though his general statement in regard to a perfected nervous\r\nsystem, and a great diminution of human fertility, suggests that such\r\nmoral evolution would signify a very considerable amount of physical\r\nchange. If it be legitimate to believe in a future humanity to which\r\nthe pleasure of mutual beneficence will represent the whole joy of\r\nlife, would it not also be legitimate to imagine other transformations,\r\nphysical and moral, which the facts of insect-biology have proved to be\r\nwithin the range of evolutional possibility?... I do not know. I most\r\nworshipfully reverence Herbert Spencer as the greatest philosopher who\r\nhas yet appeared in this world; and I should be very sorry to write\r\ndown anything contrary to his teaching, in such wise that the reader\r\ncould imagine it to have been inspired by Synthetic Philosophy. For the\r\nensuing reflections, I alone am responsible; and if I err, let the sin\r\nbe upon my own head.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the moral transformations predicted by Mr. Spencer,\r\ncould be effected only with the aid of physiological change, and at a\r\nterrible cost. Those ethical conditions manifested by insect-societies\r\ncan have been reached only through effort desperately sustained for\r\nmillions of years against the most atrocious necessities. Necessities\r\nequally merciless may have to be met and mastered eventually by the\r\nhuman race. Mr. Spencer has shown that the time of the greatest\r\npossible human suffering is yet to come, and that it will be\r\nconcomitant with the period of the greatest possible pressure of\r\npopulation. Among other results of that long stress, I understand that\r\nthere will be a vast increase in human intelligence and sympathy; and\r\nthat this increase of intelligence will be effected at the cost of\r\nhuman fertility. But this decline in reproductive power will not, we\r\nare told, be sufficient to assure the very highest of social\r\nconditions: it will only relieve that pressure of population which has\r\nbeen the main cause of human suffering. The state of perfect social\r\nequilibrium will be approached, but never quite reached, by mankind\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_Unless there be discovered some means of solving economic problems,\r\njust as social insects have solved them, by the suppression of\r\nsex-life_.\r\n\r\nSupposing that such a discovery were made, and that the human race\r\nshould decide to arrest the development of sex in the majority of its\r\nyoung,\xe2\x80\x94so as to effect a transferrence of those forces, now demanded by\r\nsex-life to the development of higher activities,\xe2\x80\x94might not the result\r\nbe an eventual state of polymorphism, like that of ants? And, in such\r\nevent, might not the Coming Race be indeed represented in its higher\r\ntypes,\xe2\x80\x94through feminine rather than masculine evolution,\xe2\x80\x94by a majority\r\nof beings of neither sex?\r\n\r\nConsidering how many persons, even now, through merely unselfish (not\r\nto speak of religious) motives, sentence themselves to celibacy, it\r\nshould not appear improbable that a more highly evolved humanity would\r\ncheerfully sacrifice a large proportion of its sex-life for the common\r\nweal, particularly in view of certain advantages to be gained. Not the\r\nleast of such advantages\xe2\x80\x94always supposing that mankind were able to\r\ncontrol sex-life after the natural manner of the ants\xe2\x80\x94would be a\r\nprodigious increase of longevity. The higher types of a humanity\r\nsuperior to sex might be able to realize the dream of life for a\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nAlready we find lives too short for the work we have to do; and with\r\nthe constantly accelerating progress of discovery, and the\r\nnever-ceasing expansion of knowledge, we shall certainly find more and\r\nmore reason to regret, as time goes on, the brevity of existence. That\r\nScience will ever discover the Elixir of the Alchemists\xe2\x80\x99 hope is\r\nextremely unlikely. The Cosmic Powers will not allow us to cheat them.\r\nFor every advantage which they yield us the full price must be paid:\r\nnothing for nothing is the everlasting law. Perhaps the price of long\r\nlife will prove to be the price that the ants have paid for it.\r\nPerhaps, upon some elder planet, that price has already been paid, and\r\nthe power to produce offspring restricted to a caste morphologically\r\ndifferentiated, in unimaginable ways, from the rest of the species...\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nBut while the facts of insect-biology suggest so much in regard to the\r\nfuture course of human evolution, do they not also suggest something of\r\nlargest significance concerning the relation of ethics to cosmic law?\r\nApparently, the highest evolution will not be permitted to creatures\r\ncapable of what human moral experience has in all areas condemned.\r\nApparently, the highest possible strength is the strength of\r\nunselfishness; and power supreme never will be accorded to cruelty or\r\nto lust. There may be no gods; but the forces that shape and dissolve\r\nall forms of being would seem to be much more exacting than gods. To\r\nprove a \xe2\x80\x9cdramatic tendency\xe2\x80\x9d in the ways of the stars is not possible;\r\nbut the cosmic process seems nevertheless to affirm the worth of every\r\nhuman system of ethics fundamentally opposed to human egoism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF MIMI-NASHI-H\xc5\x8c\xc3\x8fCHI\r\n\r\n [1] See my _Kott\xc5\x8d_, for a description of these curious crabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Or, Shimonos\xc3\xa9ki.

Formerly the professional minstrels who recited\r\n the _Heik\xc3\xa9-Monogatari_, and other tragical histories, were called\r\n _biwa-h\xc5\x8dshi_, or \xe2\x80\x9clute-priests.\xe2\x80\x9d The origin of this appellation is not\r\n clear; but it is possible that it may have been suggested by the fact\r\n that \xe2\x80\x9clute-priests\xe2\x80\x9d as well as blind shampooers, had their heads\r\n shaven, like Buddhist priests. The _biwa_ is played with a kind of\r\n plectrum, called _bachi_, usually made of horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) A response to show that one has heard and is listening attentively.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] A respectful term, signifying the opening of a gate.

For a brief account of such a service,\r\n see my _Japanese Miscellany_.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Literally, \xe2\x80\x9cfive-circle [or five-zone] stone.\xe2\x80\x9d A funeral monument\r\n consisting of five parts superimposed,\xe2\x80\x94each of a different\r\n form,\xe2\x80\x94symbolizing the five mystic elements: Ether, Air, Fire, Water,\r\n Earth.\r\n\r\nMUJINA\r\n\r\n(1) A kind of badger. Certain animals were thought to be able to\r\ntransform themselves and cause mischief for humans.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] O-joch\xc5\xab (\xe2\x80\x9chonorable damsel\xe2\x80\x9d), a polite form of address used in\r\n speaking to a young lady whom one does not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) An apparition with a smooth, totally featureless face, called a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnopperabo,\xe2\x80\x9d is a stock part of the Japanese pantheon of ghosts and\r\ndemons.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Soba is a preparation of buckwheat, somewhat resembling\r\n vermicelli.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) An exclamation of annoyed alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Well!\r\n\r\nROKURO-KUBI\r\n\r\n [1] The period of Eiky\xc5\x8d lasted from 1429 to 1441.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The upper robe of a Buddhist priest is thus called.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Present-day Yamanashi Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) A term for itinerant priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] A sort of little fireplace, contrived in the floor of a room, is\r\n thus described. The _ro_ is usually a square shallow cavity, lined\r\n with metal and half-filled with ashes, in which charcoal is lighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) Direct translation of \xe2\x80\x9csuzumushi,\xe2\x80\x9d a kind of cricket with a\r\ndistinctive chirp like a tiny bell, whence the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Now a rokuro-kubi is ordinarily conceived as a goblin whose neck\r\nstretches out to great lengths, but which nevertheless always remains\r\nattached to its body.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) A Chinese collection of stories on the supernatural.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] A present made to friends or to the household on returning from a\r\n journey is thus called. Ordinarily, of course, the _miyag\xc3\xa9_ consists\r\n of something produced in the locality to which the journey has been\r\n made: this is the point of Kwairy\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x99s jest.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) Present-day Nagano Prefecture.\r\n\r\nA DEAD SECRET\r\n\r\n(1) On the present-day map, Tamba corresponds roughly to the central\r\narea of Ky\xc5\x8dto Prefecture and part of Hyogo Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] The Hour of the Rat (_N\xc3\xa9-no-Koku_), according to the old Japanese\r\n method of reckoning time, was the first hour. It corresponded to the\r\n time between our midnight and two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning; for the\r\n ancient Japanese hours were each equal to two modern hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] _Kaimy\xc5\x8d_, the posthumous Buddhist name, or religious name, given\r\n to the dead. Strictly speaking, the meaning of the word is sila-name.\r\n (See my paper entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Literature of the Dead\xe2\x80\x9d in _Exotics and\r\n Retrospectives_.)\r\n\r\nYUKI-ONNA\r\n\r\n(1) An ancient province whose boundaries took in most of present-day\r\nT\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d, and parts of Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] That is to say, with a floor-surface of about six feet square.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] This name, signifying \xe2\x80\x9cSnow,\xe2\x80\x9d is not uncommon. On the subject of\r\n Japanese female names, see my paper in the volume entitled\r\n _Shadowings_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Also spelled Edo, the former name of T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF AOYAGI\r\n\r\n(1) An ancient province corresponding to the northern part of\r\npresent-day Ishikawa Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) An ancient province corresponding to the eastern part of\r\npresent-day Fukui Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] The name signifies \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Willow;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though rarely met with, it is\r\n still in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The poem may be read in two ways; several of the phrases having a\r\n double meaning. But the art of its construction would need\r\n considerable space to explain, and could scarcely interest the Western\r\n reader. The meaning which Tomotada desired to convey might be thus\r\n expressed:\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhile journeying to visit my mother, I met with a being\r\n lovely as a flower; and for the sake of that lovely person, I am\r\n passing the day here... Fair one, wherefore that dawn-like blush\r\n before the hour of dawn?\xe2\x80\x94can it mean that you love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Another reading is possible; but this one gives the signification\r\n of the _answer_ intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] So the Japanese story-teller would have us believe,\xe2\x80\x94although the\r\n verses seem commonplace in translation. I have tried to give only\r\n their general meaning: an effective literal translation would require\r\n some scholarship.\r\n\r\nJIU-ROKU-ZAKURA\r\n\r\n(1) Present-day Ehime Prefecture.\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM OF AKINOSUK\xc3\x89\r\n\r\n(1) Present-day Nara Prefecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] This name \xe2\x80\x9cTokoyo\xe2\x80\x9d is indefinite. According to circumstances it\r\n may signify any unknown country,\xe2\x80\x94or that undiscovered country from\r\n whose bourn no traveler returns,\xe2\x80\x94or that Fairyland of far-eastern\r\n fable, the Realm of H\xc5\x8drai. The term \xe2\x80\x9cKoku\xc5\x8d\xe2\x80\x9d means the ruler of a\r\n country,\xe2\x80\x94therefore a king. The original phrase, _Tokoyo no Koku\xc5\x8d_,\r\n might be rendered here as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Ruler of H\xc5\x8drai,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe King of\r\n Fairyland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The last phrase, according to old custom, had to be uttered by\r\n both attendants at the same time. All these ceremonial observances can\r\n still be studied on the Japanese stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] This was the name given to the estrade, or dais, upon which a\r\n feudal prince or ruler sat in state. The term literally signifies\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cgreat seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRIKI-BAKA\r\n\r\n(1) Kana: the Japanese phonetic alphabet.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) \xe2\x80\x9cSo-and-so\xe2\x80\x9d: appellation used by Hearn in place of the real name.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) A section of T\xc5\x8dky\xc5\x8d.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] A square piece of cotton-goods, or other woven material, used as a\r\n wrapper in which to carry small packages.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) Ten yen is nothing now, but was a formidable sum then.\r\n\r\n INSECT STUDIES\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n(1) Haiku.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] \xe2\x80\x9cThe modest nymph beheld her God, and blushed.\xe2\x80\x9d (Or, in a more\r\n familiar rendering: \xe2\x80\x9cThe modest water saw its God, and blushed.\xe2\x80\x9d) In\r\n this line the double value of the word _nympha_\xe2\x80\x94used by classical\r\n poets both in the meaning of fountain and in that of the divinity of a\r\n fountain, or spring\xe2\x80\x94reminds one of that graceful playing with words\r\n which Japanese poets practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] More usually written _nugi-kak\xc3\xa9ru_, which means either \xe2\x80\x9cto take\r\n off and hang up,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto begin to take off,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as in the above poem.\r\n More loosely, but more effectively, the verses might thus be rendered:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cLike a woman slipping off her haori\xe2\x80\x94that is the appearance of a\r\n butterfly.\xe2\x80\x9d One must have seen the Japanese garment described, to\r\n appreciate the comparison. The haori is a silk upper-dress,\xe2\x80\x94a kind of\r\n sleeved cloak,\xe2\x80\x94worn by both sexes; but the poem suggests a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n _haori_, which is usually of richer color or material. The sleeves are\r\n wide; and the lining is usually of brightly-colored silk, often\r\n beautifully variegated. In taking off the haori, the brilliant lining\r\n is displayed,\xe2\x80\x94and at such an instant the fluttering splendor might\r\n well be likened to the appearance of a butterfly in motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] The bird-catcher\xe2\x80\x99s pole is smeared with bird-lime; and the verses\r\n suggest that the insect is preventing the man from using his pole, by\r\n persistently getting in the way of it,\xe2\x80\x94as the birds might take warning\r\n from seeing the butterfly limed. _Jama suru_ means \xe2\x80\x9cto hinder\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cprevent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] Even while it is resting, the wings of the butterfly may be seen\r\n to quiver at moments,\xe2\x80\x94as if the creature were dreaming of flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] A little poem by Bash\xc5\x8d, greatest of all Japanese composers of\r\n _hokku_. The verses are intended to suggest the joyous feeling of\r\n spring-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Literally, \xe2\x80\x9ca windless day;\xe2\x80\x9d but two negatives in Japanese poetry\r\n do not necessarily imply an affirmative, as in English. The meaning\r\n is, that although there is no wind, the fluttering motion of the\r\n butterflies suggests, to the eyes at least, that a strong breeze is\r\n playing.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] Alluding to the Buddhist proverb: _Rakkwa \xc3\xa9da ni ka\xc3\xabrazu; ha-ky\xc5\x8d\r\n futatabi terasazu_ (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fallen flower returns not to the branch; the\r\n broken mirror never again reflects.\xe2\x80\x9d) So says the proverb\xe2\x80\x94yet it\r\n seemed to me that I saw a fallen flower return to the branch... No: it\r\n was only a butterfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Alluding probably to the light fluttering motion of falling\r\n cherry-petals.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] That is to say, the grace of their motion makes one think of the\r\n grace of young girls, daintily costumed, in robes with long fluttering\r\n sleeves... And old Japanese proverb declares that even a devil is\r\n pretty at eighteen: _Oni mo jiu-hachi azami no hana:_ \xe2\x80\x9cEven a devil at\r\n eighteen, flower-of-the-thistle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] Or perhaps the verses might be more effectively rendered thus:\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cHappy together, do you say? Yes\xe2\x80\x94if we should be reborn as\r\n field-butterflies in some future life: then we might accord!\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\n poem was composed by the celebrated poet Issa, on the occasion of\r\n divorcing his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Or, _Tar\xc3\xa9 no tama?_\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] Literally, \xe2\x80\x9cButterfly-pursuing heart I wish to have\r\n always;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, I would that I might always be able to find pleasure\r\n in simple things, like a happy child.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] An old popular error,\xe2\x80\x94probably imported from China.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] A name suggested by the resemblance of the larva\xe2\x80\x99s artificial\r\n covering to the _mino_, or straw-raincoat, worn by Japanese peasants.\r\n I am not sure whether the dictionary rendering, \xe2\x80\x9cbasket-worm,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\n quite correct;\xe2\x80\x94but the larva commonly called _minomushi_ does really\r\n construct for itself something much like the covering of the\r\n basket-worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) A very large, white radish. \xe2\x80\x9cDaikon\xe2\x80\x9d literally means \xe2\x80\x9cbig root.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] _Pyrus spectabilis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n [16] An evil spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) A common female name.\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES\r\n\r\n(1) Meiji: The period in which Hearn wrote this book. It lasted from\r\n1868 to 1912, and was a time when Japan plunged head-first into\r\nWestern-style modernization. By the \xe2\x80\x9cfashions and the changes and the\r\ndisintegrations of Meiji\xe2\x80\x9d Hearn is lamenting that this process of\r\nmodernization was destroying some of the good things in traditional\r\nJapanese culture.\r\n\r\nANTS\r\n\r\n(1) Cicadas.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] An interesting fact in this connection is that the Japanese word\r\n for ant, _ari_, is represented by an ideograph formed of the character\r\n for \xe2\x80\x9cinsect\xe2\x80\x9d combined with the character signifying \xe2\x80\x9cmoral rectitude,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cpropriety\xe2\x80\x9d (_giri_). So the Chinese character actually means \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n Propriety-Insect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK KWAIDAN: STORIES AND STUDIES OF STRANGE THINGS ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
